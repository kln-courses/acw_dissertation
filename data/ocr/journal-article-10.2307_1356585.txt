<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Four-Stage Sequence for the Levantine Neolithic, ca. 8500-3750 B.C. ANDREW M. T. MOORE University of Arizona Tucson, AZ 85721 Introduction The archaeological evidence for the Neolithic of the Levant is very great, far exceeding that avail- able from any other region of the Near East. It consists of several hundred sites of known loca- tion, the structures and artifacts found on them in surface survey and excavation, a more limited amount of economic data, and some radiocarbon dates. Several archaeologists have written general accounts of the Neolithic in which they have considered the evidence from the more important sites (for example Perrot 1968; Mellaart 1975), but this impressive amount of data has only re- cently begun to be studied in detail. My own research in this field has concentrated on the origins of argiculture and settled life in the Levant. In order to investigate the processes at work that brought about this new way of life, I have found it necessary to order systematically the data for the Neolithic of the Levant as a whole in a chronological scheme of stages, taking account of local differences in cultural remains. My detailed account of all the available evidence for the suc- cessive stages of Neolithic settlement has already been published (1978). The purpose of this article is to present the sequence of stages in a form convenient for reference and to explain its basis. I shall describe the characteristic features of each stage and illustrate them by referring to some of the ar- chaeological evidence from key sites. The discus- sion will take account of new evidence that has made necessary some revisions of the original scheme. After the initial transition from the Epipalaeo- lithic about 8500 B.c.,' major changes in the cul- tural configuration took place three times during the Neolithic, at about 7600, 6000 and 5000 B.c. Only minor changes in structures, artifacts, and other remains seem to have occurred at other times. For this reason it has seemed appropriate to me to divide the sequence into four stages, Neolithic 1 to 4 (Table 1). There are several major differences, not only in material remains but also in economy and settlement patterns, between Neolithic 1 and 2 together and Neolithic 3 and 4. It is useful, therefore, for certain interpretive pur- poses to think of Neolithic 1 and 2 as an Archaic Neolithic and Neolithic 3 and 4 as a Developed Neolithic. Each of the four stages of the Neolithic is defined principally by the distinctive nature of its archaeological remains. Circular or rectilinear house plans, for example, are characteristic of particular stages. The chipped stone industries of each stage, including techniques of manufacture, 1</page><page sequence="2">2 ANDREW M. T.

The four stages of the Neolithic of the Levant and their approximate chronology. range of tool types, and presence of certain type fossils, are especially diagnostic. So is the presence or absence of pottery and of particular features characteristic of certain wares. Burial customs, too, are a useful diagnostic feature. The full inventory of material remains from sites occupied in each of the four stages is so distinctive that it forms the basis of their defi- nition. However, the settlements of each stage also form characteristic patterns in the landscape. Further, there seem to have been significant modifications in economy from one stage to the next. Since Neolithic 1, 2, 3, and 4 may therefore be defined not only by particular material remains but also by a distinctive settlement pattern and economy, I prefer to call these successive divisions "stages" rather than "phases." The nature and duration of each stage have been, in the main, determined by examining the stratigraphic sequences and archaeological re- mains from a number of key sites. These are excavated settlements such as Abu Hureyra, Mureybat, and Jericho with long sequences of occupation spanning more than one'stage of the Neolithic and dated by radiocarbon determina- tions (Table 2). Sites with shorter sequences of occupation, perhaps dated by radiocarbon, and with good assemblages of material have been studied to give a fuller picture of each stage. The material from all other known sites, usually re- covered in surface survey, has been compared with that from the dated sites with full assem- blages, and, where reasonable typological com- parisons could be made, these sites have been assigned to one or another stage of the Neolithic. In this way it has been possible to prepare maps (figs. 3, 8, 14, 19) showing the distributions of all sites that one may reasonably suppose were used during each stage of the Neolithic. The distribution maps provide the clearest indi- cation of the changes in the pattern of settlement that took place during the successive stages of the Neolithic. These changes were related to modifica- tions that were taking place in the economy, environment, and other factors. It will be useful, therefore, to summarize some of the more general implications that may be derived from the data when ordered in this manner, since these are of great importance for our understanding of the genesis and development of a farming way of life in the Levant.

MOORE BASOR 246 those of the preceding stage, Epipalaeolithic 2, the stage known as the Natufian in Palestine. The phases of occupation at these sites that fall within Neolithic 1 are the Proto-Neolithic and Pre- Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) at Jericho (Kenyon 1969: 50); stratum II (Stekelis and Yizraely 1963: 10) and layers IV, III and II (Noy, Legge, and Higgs 1973: 86) at Nahal Oren; and phases IB, II and III at Mureybat (J. Cauvin 1977: 23-36). The characteristics of the material remains, particularly the chipped stone assemblages, from this stage are in general so little understood that they require relatively detailed discussion here. The houses at these and other Neolithic 1 sites were circular in plan. They were constructed of whatever materials were readily available, usually mudbrick or stone and timber. Thus the PPNA houses at Jericho were built of plano-convex ("hog-backed") mudbricks and wooden posts or wattle. Most had a single room from 4 to 6 m. in diameter, the floor of which was below ground level. The entrance was through a projecting porch and down a flight of steps (Kenyon 1957b: 102). Jericho is distinguished, of course, by its great size and the fact that it was enclosed by a stone wall, incorporating a tower, which apparently served a defensive purpose. The walls of the structures at Nahal Oren were built of stone. They also had a single room, often with a projecting doorway, and varied from 2 to 4 m. in diameter (Stekelis and Yizraely 1963: fig. 3). These buildings were ranged along terraces and some were set back into the slopes of the hill. The houses of phases IB and II at Mureybat were of the same general kind (J. Cauvin 1977: 23, 26). They were circular with floors at or below ground level. Their walls were made of mud and stone, sometimes reinforced with wooden posts. Although similar houses continued to be built in phase III, several circular huts of this phase were larger with interior divisions (J. Cauvin 1977: fig. 10). Contemporary with these were some rectilinear structures (van Loon 1968: 269), the first indication of a fundamental change in archi- tecture that took place at the end of Neolithic 1. These circular Neolithic 1 buildings were the latest in a tradition which stretched back through the huts of CAin Mallaha to those at c En-gev I and III and, perhaps, earlier still. They are a good indication of the basic cultural continuity from Epipalaeolithic to Neolithic in the Levant. There was some similarity in burial customs throughout the Levant in Neolithic 1. The dead at several sites were buried within the confines of the settlement, under the floors of houses or some- times in the open spaces between them. This practice began at Jericho in the PPNA. Here the dead were buried in a contracted position in graves about 1 m. deep under the house floors (Kenyon 1957b: 106). This custom was a con- tinuation of the Natufian tradition at sites in Palestine but an innovation, apparently, at Mureybat in north Syria. The most distinctive feature of the burial rite was the detachment and separate interment of skulls, of which the most elaborate examples were found at Jericho. In one instance seven skulls were set upright around an eighth, and in another several groups of three skulls each were buried close - together (Kenyon 1956: 75). This custom began late in the PPNA at Jericho and at Mureybat is not attested before phase III (J. Cauvin 1977: 36; van Loon 1968: 275). The chipped stone assemblages found on Neo- lithic 1 sites are distinctive both from those of Neolithic 2 and the preceding Epipalaeolithic. Nonetheless, there is good evidence from Jericho, Nahal Oren, Mureybat, and elsewhere that they were derived from those of the second, final stage of the Epipalaeolithic. The typical features of Neo- lithic 1 assemblages are the small size of both tools and waste, the restricted range of tool types, and the absence until late in this stage of the large blade tools characteristic of subsequent stages of the Neolithic. The main features of the flint assemblages from the Proto-Neolithic and PPNA levels at Jericho are essentially the same, so they may be described together.2 Tools were made on flakes and irregular blades struck from small prismatic and pyramidal cores; crested blades were a common by-product. Only late in the PPNA were longer blades struck from double-ended cores. The technique of squamous pressure-flaking also began to be used then. The most abundant tools were burins, scrapers and nibbled blades (fig. 1). Burins were made on both flakes and blades but were restricted in type. Most were angle burins on preparation or truncation, but single- and multiple-blow burins and a few dihedrals were also used. The scrapers included several varieties on flakes and also end- scrapers on blades. Some borers and sickle blades were present throughout, but Khiamian points were found only in the PPNA levels. The Khiamian point (fig. 2: a, b) is a type-fossil unique to Neolithic 1. It was probably an arrowhead and</page><page sequence="5">1982 FOUR-STAGE SEQUENCE FOR THE LEVANTINE NEOLITHIC 5 1 111 a 7- C b 0 5 cm Fig. 1.

Another innovation in these levels was flaked adzes and picks (fig. 1: e). These were frequently resharpened, a few with a true tranchet blow, so that edge-rejuvenation flakes were quite common. Microliths were virtually absent in these levels at Jericho. This industry was similar in several respects to that of the Natufian at Jericho. They shared the same techniques of flake and blade production and also the same types of scrapers, sickle blades, and borers. This suggests that the Neolithic 1 industry here developed directly from the Natuf- ian. It is also clear that development towards an industry dominated by blade production and large blade tools, typical of Neolithic 2, was taking place late in the PPNA at Jericho. The assemblage from layers IV, III, and II at Nahal Oren was similar in both techniques of manufacture and tool types to that from Jericho in the Proto-Neolithic and PPNA.3 The only significant difference was the presence of a micro- lithic element consisting of lunates and micro- borers; their occurrence here and their almost complete absence at Jericho may be the result.of</page><page sequence="6">6 ANDREW M.

The chipped stone assemblages from phases IB, II, and III at Mureybat are better known thanks to several recent publications by J. and M.-C. Cauvin. Here I want only to indicate the main similarities and differences between the Mureybat material and that from the other key Neolithic 1 sites. Throughout the sequence most tools were made on small blades and flakes struck from prismatic cores, as at Jericho and Nahal Oren. Microliths, principally lunates and microborers, were more abundant at Mureybat than elsewhere in phases IB and II (J. Cauvin 1977: 23, 26); but these virtually ceased to be made in phase III (J. Cauvin 1977: 34). Khiamian points were made (fig. 2:b) in both phases IB and II (M.-C. Cauvin 1974a: 317) but disappeared in phase III. Other varieties of notched and tanged arrowheads (fig. 2:d) were numerous in phase II and dominated the assemblage of phase III (J. Cauvin 1977: 28, 34). These arrowheads were much more common at Mureybat than at other Neolithic 1 sites. A distinctive heavy tool, a flaked adze with rounded cutting edge and narrow butt for hafting (fig. 2:e), was perhaps the counterpart of the flaked adzes found on other Neolithic 1 sites. This industry developed from that of phase IA at Mureybat, a phase which marks the end of Epipalaeolithic 2 on the Euphrates. In phase III certain technological and typologi- cal innovations occurred that, as at Jericho, marked the transition to an industry based on large blade tools. Double-ended cores were used to produce long blades from which large sickle blades and tanged arrowheads were made (J. Cau- vin 1977: 34). Some of these tools were retouched with squamous pressure-flaking. One other key site that should be mentioned in this review of Neolithic 1 flint assemblages is Tell Aswad in the Damascus basin. This large site, covering about 5.4 hectares, was first occupied relatively late in Neolithic 1 (phase 1A) but con- tinued to be inhabited well into Neolithic 2 (phases IB and II). The flint assemblage of phase IA was more evolved than those of most other Neolithic 1 sites, although it did resemble that of Mureybat III (M.-C. Cauvin 1974b: 435). Sickle blades, arrow- heads, and other tools were made on blades struck off prismatic, pyramidal, and double-ended cores. The arrowheads had tangs defined by notches and, in some instances, pairs of notches along the blade like examples from Mureybat. The nature of this assemblage and the dates for phase IA at Tell Aswad indicate that it falls within Neolithic 1, albeit at the end of the stage. One of the distinctive features of Neolithic life in the Levant was the regular exchange over long distances of desirable raw materials such as obsidian. The exchange of obsidian started at the outset of Neolithic 1 and so may be regarded as diagnostic of this stage. A little obsidian was found in both the Proto-Neolithic and PPNA levels at Jericho and in layers III and II at Nahal Oren. It was also found at Mureybat in phases IA and IB and subsequently (J. Cauvin 1977: 21, 23). Six pieces from the PPNA levels at Jericho analyzed by Renfrew and his associates proved to have come from Qiftlik (source 2b; Renfrew, Dixon, and Cann 1966: table 1). One piece from the Proto-Neolithic and two more from the PPNA have recently been analyzed at Bradford Univer- sity; all three also came from Qiftlik. Most of the obsidian from Tell Aswad IA analyzed at Bradford originated from the Qiftlik source, but one piece was from Lake Van. Thus it would appear that while much of the obsidian reaching the Levant came from central Anatolia, a little was also being obtained from a Vannic source. Other Neolithic 1 artifacts are restricted in range. Ground stone tools have been found on all the main sites, though not in great variety. They included simple stone rubbers and querns, usually of the hollow type. Simple stone bowls and dishes were also known. An important innovation was the manufacture of ground stone axes at Jericho, Mureybat, and some other sites. Bone tools were another common find, though again there was no great variety of types. They consisted for the most part of fine points, pins and needles. Objects of adornment were, by contrast, scarce. A few beads and pendants of stone, bone, and shell have been recovered but little else. Anthropomorphic figurines have been found at Mureybat (J. Cauvin 1977: figs. 15-17), Nahal Oren (Stekelis and Yizraely 1963: 9), and at some other sites. The discovery of several little containers and figurines made of baked clay in phase III at Mureybat (J. Cauvin 1974: 200) is of considerable interest in itself but does not really affect our understanding of the nature of Neolithic 1 culture and economy. I have outlined the principle cultural character- istics of Neolithic 1 and will summarize them here.</page><page sequence="8">8 ANDREW M. T. MOORE BASOR 246 Buildings were circular in plan and normally had a single room with a sunken floor. Burials were usually within the settlement, and late in the stage the custom was begun of separating skulls from the rest of the skeleton. The chipped stone industry employed a particular series of techniques to pro- duce a restricted range of small tools, conspicuous among which were flaked adzes, Khiamian points, and other notched arrowheads. Ground stone axes also began to be made in this stage. The exchange of obsidian started at the beginning of Neolithic 1, opening up contacts with Anatolia. There is strong evidence to suggest that the origins of these traditions lay in Epipalaeolithic 2, enough to indicate that the population of the Levant remained the same from Epipalaeolithic to Neolithic. Towards the end of Neolithic 1 the cultural configuration changed, and new cultural traits characteristic of Neolithic 2 were developed. My estimate of the duration of Neolithic 1 is based on radiocarbon dates from Jericho, Murey- bat, and Tell Aswad. Most of the early samples from Jericho were analyzed by the British Museum and the University of Philadelphia laboratories. Material, often from the same phases, was dated about 500 or 600 years older by the British Museum than by the Philadelphia laboratories. Thus the earliest Neolithic 1 dates, from a phase of the Jericho PPNA postdating the construction of the oldest town wall, and the tower, were given as 8350 ? 500 B.c. (BM-250; Barker, Burleigh, and Meeks 1969: 290) and 8300 ? 200 B.c. (BM-105; Barker and Mackey 1963: 107) by the British Museum, compared with 7825 ? 110 B.c. (P-378; Stuckenrath 1963: 84) by Philadelphia. These discrepancies have never been properly explained; given the fact that all the samples were excavated many years ago, any date obtained from them is probably not very exact. The Jericho dates are all from PPNA samples, and the Proto-Neolithic settlement was founded some time before. In these circumstances it would seem reasonable to suggest that the Proto-Neolithic settlement might have been founded about 8500 B.c. at the beginning of Neolithic 1.4 The Mureybat dates present fewer problems, but even here there are discrepancies between dates from different laboratories for each phase. J. Cauvin has recently published a full list of all the dates obtained so far (1977: 47). From these he estimates that phase I lasted from 8500 to 8200 B.c., the division between IA and IB coming at 8300 B.c. In arriving at these estimates he has accepted a mutually consistent series of dates from the Monaco and Philadelphia laboratories but has ignored three from Louvain that are several centuries older. If one took these dates into account, then the transition from IA to IB would have occurred earlier. In any case, the Mureybat dates suggest that on the Euphrates Neolithic 1 began at or soon after 8500 B.c., as in Palestine. The dates for phases III and IV at Mureybat indicate fairly clearly that the transition from Neolithic 1 to Neolithic 2 occurred about 7600 B.c. (J. Cauvin 1977: 48). Good supporting evi- dence for this estimate has recently become avail- able from Abu Hureyra. The earliest date for the aceramic Neolithic levels near the bottom of Trench B at this site is 7424 ? 72 B.c. (BM-1122). There was about 1 m. of deposit below the level from which the sample for dating was obtained, so I estimate that the site was first occupied about 7500 B.c. or a little before. The typology of the flints from the bottom of this trench and other contemporary deposits on the site indicates that it was founded only shortly after Neolithic 2 began. This evidence must be regarded as provisonal until more dates are available -and-study of the flint assemblages has been completed, butit-agrees well with the new information from Mureybat. I had earlier argued that the transition from Neo- lithic 1 to Neolithic 2 took place about 7000 B.c. (Moore 1978: 260), but that estimate must now be revised. The preliminary results from the excavation of Tell Aswad had suggested that phase I belonged in Neolithic 1 and phase II in Neolithic 2, the transi- tion occurring about 6900 B.c. The excavator has recently indicated that phase I should be divided into two sub-phases, IA and IB (Contenson 1976: 199), and it seems that, although IA should still be attributed to Neolithic 1, IB now belongs in Neo- lithic 2. The estimated date for this transition at Tell Aswad is 7600 B.c. Thus the evidence from Tell Aswad accords with that from Abu Hureyra and Mureybat. The preceding description of the main classes of artifacts found on Neolithic 1 sites will have made it apparent that there was a considerable degree of general cultural uniformity throughout the Levant during this stage. From this and other evidence, such as the exchange of obsidian, one can infer that the inhabitants of each locality maintained</page><page sequence="9">1982 FOUR-STAGE SEQUENCE FOR THE LEVANTINE NEOLITHIC 9 close contact with their neighbors. Yet there are differences in material remains between groups of sites in different areas that indicate the presence of local cultural traditions. The most conspicuous example of this is the Harifian of the Negev and Sinai. The type-site of the Harifian is Abu Salem in the Har Harif (Marks and Scott 1976), but other smaller Harifian sites are located further north in the Halutza dunes and to the west in the Jebel Meghara. Circular and oval huts were found at Abu Salem, which was occupied in the latter half of the 9th millennium B.c. (Marks 1975: 361). The chipped stone industry here and at other Harifian sites was microlithic with a type-fossil, the Harif point (fig. 2:c). This seems to have been the Harifian equivalent of the Khiamian point, since- the distribution of both type-fossils is almost mutually exclusive. The HIarifian was contemporary with early Neolithic 1 occurrences elsewhere in the Levant. The structures at Abu Salem resembled those at Nahal Oren while the H.arifian chipped stone industry shared a number of technological and typological traits with Neolithic 1 assemblages elsewhere. There is thus good reason to regard the Harifian as a variant of the Neolithic 1 cultural complex (Moore 1978: 117). A detailed examination of the archaeological remains from Neolithic 1 sites in other areas does reveal more local idiosyncracies in artifacts, par- ticularly in details of building construction, the proportions of flint tools found, and the presence or absence of distinctive types such as the various notched arrowheads from Mureybat. I would suggest that four such groups of sites with local cultural traditions can be distinguished within Neolithic 1: the Harifian in the south; a Palestinian group (Jericho, Nahal Oren, El Khiam); a third group centered on the Damascus basin (Tell Aswad); and a fourth on the middle Euphrates (Mureybat). We shall see that these local traditions persisted throughout the subsequent development of the Neolithic. The distribution map of Neolithic 1 sites (fig. 3) indicates that they were situated at relatively low elevations in open country. The economy was based in part on the cultivation of cereals and pulses but also on gathering of wild plants and selective exploitation of wild animals. Thus the location of Neolithic 1 sites reflects a need for arable land and pasture. A second major point to note is that relatively few sites were occupied during this stage compared with the preceding one, Epipalaeolithic 2. This may be explained partly by the fact that with the advent of agriculture people were becoming more sedentary. They no longer needed to move from site to site during the year, as they had during earlier stages when the economy had been based on hunting and gathering. Moreover, Neolithic 1 sites were substantially larger than those of the preceding stage, which suggests that people were becoming concentrated on fewer, larger sites. The development of agriculture made it possible for substantially larger groups of people to remain together on one site for much or all of the year. Neolithic 2, 7600-6000 B.c. Two key sites in Syria were occupied, apparently continuously, from Neolithic 1 to Neolithic 2; these were Mureybat and Tell Aswad. At Mureybat the transition took place between phases III and IV and at Tell Aswad from phase IA to phase IB. In Palestine, Neolithic 2 settlements have been found stratified above Neolithic 1 remains at Jericho, Nahal Oren, and El Khiam. Jericho, however, was abandoned between the PPNA (Neolithic 1) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB, Neolithic 2) (Kenyon 1979: 30). There is no evidence of such a stratigraphic break at either Nahal Oren or El Khiam, but since there was only a modest accumulation of deposit at these sites (Noy, Legge, and Higgs 1973: 78; Perrot 1951), it is likely that each was occupied intermittently. Far more Neolithic 2 than Neolithic 1 sites are known throughout the Levant, among the more important of which are Abu Hureyra, Ras Shamra, Tell Labweh, Tell Ramad, Munhatta, and Beidha. Abu Hureyra was occupied throughout Neo- lithic 2 and for the earlier centuries of Neolithic 3. The Neolithic settlement was founded about 7500 B.c., as we have seen; and it may have continued to be inhabited until about 5500 B.c. The dates for the aceramic Neolithic (Neolithic 2) phase of occupation are approximately 7500 to 6000 B.c. and for the ceramic Neolithic (Neo- lithic 3) phase 6000 to 5500 B.c. Abu Hureyra has yielded some of the clearest evidence for the ma- terial remains characteristic of Neolithic 2 sites, so I shall use this as illustration here.5 The houses and other structures at Abu Hureyra were rectilinear with several rooms. They were built of mudbrick and apparently roofed with</page><page sequence="10">10 ANDREW M. T. MOORE BASOR 246 \ EUPHRATES o DAMASCUS S BASIN I 0 * PALESTINE ". . .'.."

The plaster was colored black or red and burnished to give a shiny finish. The interior walls of the rooms were whitewashed, and occasionally designs were painted on the walls and floors. The main features of this mode of construction recurred on most Neolithic 2 settlement sites throughout the Levant, although building materials and details of finish varied from one area to another. This kind of building, employing mudbrick to con- struct basically rectangular houses, is still used in many villages of the Levant today. The evidence of Mureybat III indicates that the change from circular to rectilinear buildings took place in north Syria late in Neolithic 1. Certainly rectilinear houses were built at Abu Hureyra from the outset of Neolithic 2. The change seems to have happened at the beginning of Neolithic 2 in Palestine, since the structures both of Nahal Oren I and PPNB Jericho were rectilinear. At Beidha in Transjordan the transition occurred early in the 7th millennium B.C. on the evidence of the well dated sequence there (Kirkbride 1966: 72; Mortensen 1970: 13). The dead at Abu Hureyra were buried under the house floors or in spaces between the build- ings. Some individuals were buried alone in a crouched position, accompanied on occasion by a few grave goods. Others were deposited incomplete in collective graves after the flesh had decayed. Frequently, the skulls were detached and buried separately. Red ochre was sometimes scattered over the skeletons and painted on the skulls. Similar burial customs were practiced by the inhabitants of Neolithic 2 sites throughout the Levant. One significant variant of the custom of according skulls special treatment has been recorded at Jericho, Tell Ramad, and Beisamun. At Jericho the faces of the skulls had been reconstituted with plaster and the features modelled naturalistically (Kenyon 1957a: 62). The two examples from Beisamun had been treated in the same way (Ferembach and Lechevallier 1973: 224), as had several from Tell Ramad (Ferembach 1969: 67 ff). Two clay figures were associated with a group of plastered skulls at Tell Ramad (Contenson 1967: 21), and it is thought that the skulls may have been mounted on them. The chipped stone industry of Abu Hureyra and other sites in Neolithic 2 was based on the production of large blades from conical and double-ended cores (fig. 4:b). The most common blade tools at Abu Hureyra were tanged arrow- heads, end-scrapers, burins, and knives (figs. 5, 6). Borers and sickle blades (figs. 5: b, c; 4: a) were also made, but the latter were rare. These tools were usually retouched abruptly, but in the later aceramic phase of occupation squamous pressure- flaking became quite common. Scrapers were the main class of flake tool throughout. There was an increase in the variety of tools made from the early to the late aceramic phase. The general characteristics of the Abu Hureyra assemblage were repeated on Neolithic 2 sites throughout the Levant, but a careful examination of the material from these other sites reveals local idiosyncracies in technology, in proportions of tools, and even in certain types of tools. Pressure- flaking was used less commonly on the Euphrates sites than on those in the southern Levant. Flaked and polished axes made of flint and other stones were rare on sites such as Abu Hureyra, situated in the steppe, but were common at Tell Ramad, Labweh, Munhatta, and Abu-ghosh (fig. 7a), all sites situated in the Mediterranean forest zone. These tools were needed to clear woodland and shape timber in the forest zone but were of little use in the steppe where timber was scarce. Sickle blades were rare at Abu Hureyra and Buqras yet abundant on most settlements in the western Le- vant. Certain tool types such as tanged and winged arrowheads and tranchet axes (fig. 7:b, al, a2) have been found on sites in Palestine but not further north. Such differences as these are helpful in defining local traditions of artifact manufacture. Obsidian was used in small quantities through- out the aceramic Neolithic settlement at Abu Hureyra; it formed 3.7% of the total chipped stone recovered from these levels in Trench B. A sample of 100 pieces from this trench has been analyzed in the Bradford program. The material was obtained from at least six sources in Anatolia, although most came from four of these, Ig and another source near Lake Van, Bing61, and Qiftlik. The obsidian from these sources occurred in different proportions in each phase, but in general more was obtained from the eastern Anatolian sources than from (iftlik. Obsidian has also been analyzed from Tell Aswad and Ghoraife in the Damascus basin as part of the Bradford program. This obsidian came from three sources, and again Vannic obsidian was used as much as, or more than, obsidian from Ciftlik. It has been suggested</page><page sequence="12">12 ANDREW M. T.

(Renfrew, Dixon, and Cann 1968: 326) that most of the obsidian used in the Levant during Neo- lithic 2 came from the Aksaray region, but the preliminary results of the Bradford analyses indicate that this view should be revised. Obsidian was regularly used in small quantities on most sites throughout Neolithic 2, and con- siderably greater amounts of this material reached the Levant during this stage than in Neolithic 1. Demand also increased for other exotic raw materials from distant sources. At Abu Hureyra jadeite, serpentine, and agate were obtained from the Taurus, steatite from the Zagros, turquoise and malachite from Sinai and the Wadi Arabah, and cowrie shells from the Mediterranean. Con- siderably greater quantities of other raw materials</page><page sequence="15">1982 FOUR-STAGE SEQUENCE FOR THE LEVANTINE NEOLITHIC 15 were obtained from sources a few dozen kilometers away, among them bitumen, basalt, colored lime- stones, and gypsum. These kinds of regular local and long distance exchange reached a climax in the Levant during Neolithic 2. The other classes of artifacts found at Abu Hureyra were much more varied than on any Neolithic 1 site. Among these were stone bowls and dishes, some of them finely made of colored stones polished to a smooth finish. Similar stone bowls have been found on all the main Neolithic 2 settlement sites in the Levant. Another major class of artifacts found at Abu Hureyra was the bone tools. These include needles, pins, a fish- hook, and a hook and eye. Stone rubbers and saddle querns were made in greater quantities than before, a reflection of the increasing impor- tance of agriculture in this stage. At Tell Ramad, Jericho, and some other sites in Palestine, the querns were a distinctive open-ended kind that was sometimes stepped. The inhabitants of the late aceramic Neolithic settlement at Abu Hureyra made large containers out of white plaster, similar to the white ware or "vaisselle blanche" found on other sites. These containers included rectangular tubs and circular jars. Similar heavy, thick-walled vessels and smaller bowls have been found at Buqras, Tell Ramad, and Labweh. White ware does not occur, however, in Palestine. Ornamental artifacts were relatively common in the aceramic Neolithic levels at Abu Hureyra, particularly in the late aceramic. The most colorful were beads and pendants, made of a variety of imported stones as well as bone and shell. Clay was also used to make beads, as well as a modest quantity of anthropomorphic and animal figu- rines. Clay figurines have been found in greater numbers at other Neolithic 2 sites such as Tell Ramad (Contenson 1971: 281). The greater variety and quantity of artifacts made at Abu Hureyra and elsewhere indicate that an expansion of crafts took place during this stage. Some of these objects--the stone bowls, jewelry, and white ware, for example-were prob- ably being made by specialist craftsmen. Special- ists were also probably responsible for producing the large quantities of mudbrick and lime for plaster required in house construction. These activities all emphasize the growing diversity of culture in Neolithic 2. The main cultural characteristics of Neolithic 2 may be summarized as follows. Buildings were rectilinear and had several rooms. They were usually constructed of mudbrick or stone and timber, and their interiors were sometimes deco- rated. The dead were buried within settlements either in single graves or in secondary collective burials. The skulls were often removed from the skeletons and given special treatment. Most chipped stone tools were made on large blades. Typically they included tanged arrow- heads, sickle blades, burins, borers, and knives. Flake scrapers were quite common at most sites. The use of squamous pressure-flaking to retouch tools increased considerably as the stage pro- gressed. Flaked and polished stone axes were frequently used on sites in the forest zone. An innovation in Syria and Lebanon was white ware; this was made during the later centuries of Neo- lithic 2 and early in Neolithic 3 before it was superseded by pottery. Throughout Neolithic 2 there was an increase in the diversity of equipment: new kinds of objects were invented and older types made in greater variety. The demand for raw materials from sources both within and beyond the Levant also grew. Neolithic 2 began about 7600 B.C. and lasted until about 6000 B.C., when a number of changes took place in culture, economy, and distribution of sites. The main cultural innovation was the introduction of pottery, which can be quite pre- cisely dated in Syria. The latest radiocarbon date for the aceramic Neolithic phase at Abu Hureyra is 6240 ? 77 B.C. (BM-1424). The transition to the ceramic Neolithic phase took place shortly after, probably about 6000 B.C. The latest Neolithic 2 phase at Buqras is level II, which has a date of 6010 ? 55 B.c. (GrN-4819). The phase above, level III, which contains pottery, has a date of 5990 ? 60 B.C. (GrN-4820; Vogel and Waterbolk 1967: 128). Thus the change also took place here about 6000 B.C. The radiocarbon dates for Tell Ramad suggest that the transition from Neolithic 2 to 3 occurred a century or two later there. The last Neolithic 2 phase, level II, has dates of 5970 + 50 B.c. (GrN- 4427), 5950 ? 50 B.c. (GrN-4822), and 6260 ? 50 B.C. (GrN-4426; Vogel and Waterbolk 1967: 129). The level III settlement occupied early in Neo- lithic 3 has a date of 5930 ? 55 B.c. (GrN-4823). These dates would suggest that the transition took place about 5900 B.c. or even a little later.</page><page sequence="16">16 ANDREW M. T. MOORE BASOR 246 There are no radiocarbon dates for sites in Palestine occupied during the later 7th millen- nium B.C. Jericho was abandoned in the mid-7th millennium B.C. and Munhatta, on typological grounds, somewhat later. Nearly all other Neo- lithic 2 sites in Palestine and neighboring areas appear to have been abandoned by the end of Neolithic 2 (Moore 1978: 376-80). In Neolithic 2, as in Neolithic 1, there was a general similarity in culture throughout the Le- vant. This said, we can also recognize a persis- tence in three areas (fig. 8) of local traditions that were evident in Neolithic 1. Thus one can define a Middle Euphrates group of sites (Abu Hureyra, Buqras, El Kum) whose flint industry had some distinctive local attributes. There is a West Syrian group (Tell Ramad, Tell Labweh, Ras Shamra), where again there were some variations in flint assemblages. The building plans and method of construction on these sites also differed somewhat from others in different areas in Neolithic 2. The third group of sites is in Palestine (Jericho, Nahal Oren, Munhatta). This group is distinguished by variations in its flint industry and in the plans of buildings, by certain distinctive aspects of burial customs, and by the absence of white ware. Two subgroups of sites related to the Palestinian group may also be defined: sites in the Negev and Sinai (Nahal Divshon, Mushabi VI, Wadi Sa'al) and sites on the Transjordan plateau (Beidha, Wadi Dhobai B, Abu Suwan). The remains on these sites were fairly similar to those in Palestine, so far as one can tell from the relatively little evi- dence available, but certain differences can be discerned, particularly in flint assemblages and architecture. It will be evident that sites within the three main groups-Middle Euphrates, West Syrian and Palestinian-are in approximately the same areas as the three groups distinguished in Neolithic 1- Middle Euphrates, Damascus basin, and Pales- tinian. There is also much evidence, some of it outlined above, to indicate that cultural traditions were continuous from one stage to the next in these areas. Many more sites were inhabited during Neo- lithic 2 (fig. 8) than in Neolithic 1; these sites were also considerably larger. This evidence strongly suggests that the population of the Levant in- creased substantially in Neolithic 2. This may be interpreted as a delayed response to the gradual spread of agriculture first evident in Neolithic 1. The economy in Neolithic 2 was based on the cultivation of cereals and pulses and also on herding of sheep and goats. Some food was still obtained from wild plants and animals. The growth in population that accompanied this increased dependance on farming may have in- creased competition for access to the best arable land. This may explain another aspect of the site distribution, the expansion of settlement eastward into the steppe zone. Neolithic 2 was the only stage of the Neolithic during which this zone was regularly inhabited. The people who now lived in the steppe may have relied on pastoralism to a greater extent than those further to the west and north, since Neolithic 2 is the earliest stage for whicl there is unequivocal evidence for domesti- cated sheep and goats. Developed Neolithic Neolithic 3, 6000-5000 B.c. The inception of Neolithic 3 was marked by major adjustments in the pattern of settlement and economy, as well as by cultural change (Moore 1979: 70). Here I shall concentrate on the cultural characteristics of the new stage, again using as illustration the evidence from the key excavated sites. Abu Hureyra and Buqras continued to be occu- pied into Neolithic 3 but were later abandoned. At Ras Shamra the transition from Neolithic 2 to 3 took place from phase VC to VB; the later phase, VA, also belongs within Neolithic 3. Similar transitions happened at Tell Ramad between levels II and III and at Tell Labweh, where the rectangular building just below the surface in Trench A and the upper Neolithic pits in Trench B fall within Neolithic 3 (Kirkbride 1969: 46). Several important sites were founded during this stage, among them Byblos (ndolithique ancien) and Tell Judaidah (level XIV, phases A and B). Palestine was virtually deserted for the earlier centuries of Neolithic 3, but occupation was re- sumed later at Jericho (Pottery Neolithic A) and at Munhatta (phase 2B); Shacar Ha-Golan was also inhabited during Neolithic 3 (Moore 1978a: 374). The stage I earlier defined as Late Neolithic phase 1 in Palestine (Moore 1973: 51) is the equivalent of Neolithic 3 there. Buildings on Neolithic 3 sites in Syria and Lebanon continued to be constructed in a gener- ally similar manner to those of Neolithic 2. They</page><page sequence="17">1982 FOUR-STAGE SEQUENCE FOR THE LEVANTINE NEOLITHIC 17 were rectilinear, usually multi-roomed and con- structed of mudbrick, stone, and timber. The houses at Byblos were built of stone (Dunand 1973: 10) because this was the material most readily available, with floors of polished white lime plaster. The buildings at Ras Shamra had stone footings and in some instances a mudbrick superstructure (Contenson 1977: 3; Kuschke 1962: 260). The floors were either of trodden earth or plaster. The interiors of these houses were simpler than those of Neolithic 2 in that no coloring was applied to the floors and no designs painted on the walls. The structures found on Palestinian sites were of a different kind. The houses were usually pit dwellings, sometimes incorporating mudbrick or stone, with roofs of timber, branches, and reeds. The best examples of these have been found at Jericho (Kenyon 1960: 102), where they occurred all over the mound, but they are also known from Munhatta (Perrot 1968: col. 415), Beth-shan (Fitzgerald 1934: 124), Teluliot Batashi (Kaplan 1958a: *83), and other sites. These were too insubstantial to have been occupied for long periods, so there may have been less stability of occupation in Palestine than further north. Large pits, perhaps used as cooking hollows or for other purposes and later filled with domestic rubbish, have been found on a number of other Neolithic 3 sites further north. I have mentioned the pits at Labweh but they were a typical feature of Ramad III (Contenson and van Liere 1966: 168), Ras Shamra (Contenson 1962: 509), and the ceramic Neolithic at Abu Hureyra. Burial customs changed markedly in Neolithic 3. Some dead were buried within the settlement at Byblos, always between the buildings and no longer under house floors (Dunand 1973: 30). The bodies of adults were laid on their sides in a crouched position in shallow graves, while infants were buried in jars. The number of burials found, 33, is small considering the size of the settlement and the length of time it was occupied. This suggests that most of the dead were buried outside the settlement. This seems to have been the case at all other Neolithic 3 sites that have been exca- vated, since finds of burials within settlements are rare. The rite was much simpler now on the evidence from Byblos, with no more secondary burial and no separate treatment of skulls. The most obvious cultural change in Neolithic 3 was the introduction of pottery. This innovation occurred throughout Syria and Lebanon at or soon after 6000 B.c. When Palestine was resettled, inhabitants of sites there also used pottery. Neo- lithic 3 pottery was simple in design and manu- facture, as one would expect with the product of a new craft. This did not prevent the almost imme- diate development of local styles of decoration. The cAmfiq A and B pottery from Tell Judaidah illustrates how varied this pottery could be. Here and on other sites the main vessel shapes were hemispherical bowls and globular holemouth jars. Some jars had collar necks, and a few of the bowls in cAmliq B were carinated. These pots had either round or flat bases and some of the jars had lug handles. Three main wares were distinguished at Judai- dah. The most common was dark-faced burnished ware (Braidwood and Braidwood 1960: 49), a group of thick-walled pots whose surface color varied from buff through brown to black. Some had stabbed or incised decoration, and all were roughly burnished. In cAmjiq B a few were deco- rated with pattern burnish (fig. 9:c2). Some pots were also given a high burnish in this phase, a class I have called dark polished ware (Moore 1978: 301). The term "dark-faced burnished ware" has been used by archaeologists to describe almost all simple burnished pottery found on Neolithic 3 sites and in the process has lost much of its descriptive value. While it is true that much Neo- lithic 3 pottery of varied shape and surface decoration did have a burnished surface, there are too many differences in the pottery from one site to another for it to be described by a single, all- embracing term. The description "dark-faced burnished ware" should be reserved for the cAmllq sites, while the pottery from settlements in other areas is better described in its own terms. The second ware at Judaidah was coarse simple ware (Braidwood and Braidwood 1960: 47). The vessels in this group had thick walls and a soft fabric with much straw filler. Their surface color varied from light buff to orange and brown. The third was washed impressed ware (Braidwood and Braidwood 1960: 52), composed of vessels with varied surface color partly covered in thin red paint. Some vessels also carried shell-impressed decoration below the rim. The pottery found at Byblos in ndolithique ancien was even simpler, although the techniques of manufacture were much the same. Two shapes predominated, globular jars and hemispherical bowls (fig. 9). Many pots were decorated with</page><page sequence="18">18 ANDREW M. T.

MOORE BASOR 246 impressed or incised designs, the most character- istic of which were done with the back of a cardium shell. Painting was not used. The vessels were fired to a buff color and then lightly burnished. The pottery on Palestinian sites differed in fabric and decoration from that on sites further north, even if the shapes were generally similar. At Jericho (fig. 10) there were coarse, plain thick- walled vessels and a finer painted ware (Moore 1973: 52, 53). The surface of many of the pots was scraped or wiped, the latter technique leaving a rough, striated surface. Some of the decorated pots had a cream or red slip with reserved chevron and triangle patterns that were sometimes burnished. A few vessels had incised decoration. The chipped stone assemblages of Neolithic 3 sites were in the tradition of those of Neolithic 2, but there were modifications of both technology and typology. The emphasis on blade tools was as strong as ever, but most blades were now struck off pyramidal rather than double-ended cores. The typological range was somewhat reduced, but new sub-types of certain tools became prevalent. The incidence of squamous retouch increased. The two most common tools on most sites were arrowheads and sickle blades. Arrowheads were less common than in Neolithic 2, a trend probably connected with a decline in hunting. Conversely, the proportion of sickle blades increased, reflect- ing in part a greater dependence on cereal agricul- ture. The proportion of scrapers declined; since many of these were probably used to clean animal skins, this trend may also reflect the decreasing importance of hunting. Large flaked and polished axes, adzes, and chisels were more common than ever on many sites in the Mediterranean forest zone. This may be seen on sites throughout the region, from Tell Judaidah in the north, through Kubbah I and Byblos on the coast and Tell Labweh north in the Beqac, south to Ha-Goshrim and then Munhatta and Abu-ghosh. These trends are well illustrated in the assem- blage from neolithique ancien at Byblos. Sickle blades were particularly prominent (fig. 1 l:al): these were segmented and usually had a coarsely denticulated cutting edge (J. Cauvin 1968: 70). Both traits were typical of Neolithic 3 sickle blades on many other sites. Arrowheads were also numerous. Most were tanged and retouched quite extensively with squamous pressure-flaking. The three most common types (fig. I1 :b-d) were Byblos points and cAmfjq 1 and 2 points (J. Cauvin 1968: 47). cAm fq 1 and 2 points, first recognized at Tell Judaidah, started to be made late in Neolithic 2 but became much more common in Neolithic 3. Apart from flaked and polished axes and chisels (figs. 12, 13), the other main class of tools was the burins (J. Cauvin 1968: 89). Among the few other types were borers and scrapers. All these tools have been found in modest quantities on other 'Neolithic 3 sites. The technology and typology of the chipped stone from sites in Palestine did resemble that of assemblages on sites in Syria and Lebanon in several respects, but there were local differences, seen most clearly in the material from Jericho. Tools from this and other Palestinian sites were usually smaller than on settlements further north. Arro~vheads and sickle blades were plentiful, but, although many of the sickle blades were similar to those on sites in Syria and Lebanon, the arrow- heads were not. These were tanged but had marked shoulders or wings and a thin point (fig. I1 :e). Another tool found at Jericho and other Pales- tinian sites but rare further north was a bifacial knife on thin tabular flint (fig. 13:b). Obsidian continued to be exchanged in Neo- lithic 3, but there was a noticeable modification of the pattern of source exploitation. Analysis of obsidian from the ceramic Neolithic levels at Abu Hureyra has shown that almost half was now obtained from Ciftlik, while the rest still came from sources in eastern Anatolia. A little obsidian has also been analyzed from Tell Judaidah, Tab- bat el-Hammam, Byblos, and Munhatta (Renfrew, Dixon, and Cann 1966: table 1; Wright 1969: 26; Wright and Gordus 1969: 86). Nearly all this obsidian also came from Iiftlik. The other artifacts found on Neolithic 3 sites indicate strong cultural continuity from Neolithic 2. Crafts flourished even more than before, and a greater variety of objects was made. This is espe- cially obvious when ornamental objects are con- sidered. Beads and amulets of several types were used on most sites in Syria and Lebanon, though not in Palestine where the range of artifacts was relatively restricted. Seals, a very few of which have been discovered on Neolithic 2 sites, were found in small numbers at Tell Judaidah (Braid- wood and Braidwood 1960: 90, 94) and Byblos (Dunand 1973: 84). The range of bone tools on most Neolithic 3 sites was the same as in Neolithic 2. Stone rubbers and querns were more common than ever, another indication of the increasing importance of agri-</page><page sequence="21">1982 FOUR-STAGE SEQUENCE FOR THE LEVANTINE NEOLITHIC 21 el a2 a2 al al ee2 e2 b cl c2 dl 0 5 d2 I cm b Fig. 11.

White ware containers and a variety of both coarse and fine stone bowls continued to be made well into Neolithic 3, but then their manu- facture declined. This trend is probably related to the increased use of pottery, which in time super- seded both white ware and stone bowls. The traffic from sources in the Levant in raw materials such as limestone, basalt, and bitumen flourished as never before, but the pattern of long distance exchange fluctuated. On present evidence, more obsidian was obtained from the Cappa- docian than from the Lake Van sources in this stage. Steatite, serpentine, various greenstones, and carnelian from the Taurus and Zagros were still used, but turquoise and malachite rarely if at all. Sinai was now virtually uninhabited, and</page><page sequence="22">22 ANDREW M. T. MOORE BASOR 246 Ia ~8 a b 0 5 cm b "G c st r ;AS ? ? Fig. 12.

Cowries were no longer exchanged, while other marine shells were not traded inland. It seems that long distance contacts in Neolithic 3 declined somewhat. The distinctive cultural characteristics of Neo- lithic 3 may be briefly stated. Buildings were constructed, for the most part, on a rectilinear plan and had several rooms. In Palestine pit dwellings were preferred and pits used for other purposes were also a feature of sites further north. The dead</page><page sequence="23">1982 FOUR-STAGE SEQUENCE FOR THE LEVANTINE NEOLITHIC 23 b ?111 -14: iiv o 5 Cm al a2 Fig. 13. Neolithic 3 flint tools. Chisels:from: al. Byblos (after Cauvin); a2. Ha-Goshrim (after Perrot); a3. tabular flint knife from Jericho. were usually disposed of outside settlements, al- though a few continued to be buried within. An important innovation was the making of pottery, and from the outset there was much variation in surface decoration from site to site. Flint assemblages continued to be dominated by blade tools, usually made on blades from pyram- idal cores. The most numerous tools were seg- mented sickle blades and tanged arrowheads; cAmujq arrowheads were prominent among the latter in Syria and Lebanon. Heavy flaked axes, adzes, and chisels were a major component of assemblages from some sites in the forest zone. The range and variety of other artifacts in- creased in comparison with earlier stages. Both short and long distance exchange flourished, espe- cially with sources to the north of the Levant. Contacts with regions to the south and east appear to have diminished. Most of these cultural features indicate strong continuity from Neolithic 2 to 3. This was particu- larly marked in the building tradition and flint industries. There is also good evidence of strati- graphic continuity on some sites in both Syria and Lebanon. The same cannot be said of sites in Palestine, where the stratigraphic and cultural break was almost complete. Neolithic 3 began about 6000 B.c. and lasted for a millennium in much of the Levant. In north Syria its close was marked by the advent of the Halafian. This seems to have begun in the second half of the 6th millennium B.C. in the Halaf heartland east of the Euphrates. There is a date of 5620 ? 35 B.C. (GrN-2660) for the lowest Halaf level at Tell Halaf itself (Vogel and Waterbolk 1964: 355), and we have more recent dates from Arpachiyah of 5077 ? 83 B.c. (P-584) for level TT8 and 6114 ? 78 B.C. (P-585) for TT6 (Stucken- rath and Ralph 1965: 188). These dates are prob- ably not very accurate, but they give a general indication of when Halaf began in this area. West of the Euphrates the transition took place later, probably about 5000 B.c., since a date of 5234 ? 84 B.c. (P-457) has been obtained for phase VA at Ras Shamra (Contenson 1964: 47). In south Syria Neolithic 3 was succeeded with- out interruption by Neolithic 4. Samples from the lower levels at Tell Ard Tlaili in the Beqac have given three dates of 4920 ? 130 B.C. (K-1432), 4900 ? 130 B.C. (K-1433), and 4840 ? 130 B.C. (K-1434) (Mellaart 1975: 287). These levels have yielded both Halaf and early Neolithic 4 material. It would thus appear that Neolithic 3 ended shortly before the site was occupied, about 5000 B.C. There are no dates for the transition from Neolithic 3 to 4 in Palestine, but I would suggest that it may have taken place about 4800 B.C., since cultural changes in the 6th and 5th millennia B.C. tended to occur a little later here than farther north. I have indicated that Neolithic 3 developed from Neolithic 2 in much of the Levant. In Neolithic 3 there was a degree of similarity of culture through-</page><page sequence="24">24 ANDREW M. T.

This may be seen in building remains and other arti- facts, especially pottery and flints. There are clear distinctions between sites in north Syria, south Syria and Lebanon, and Pales- tine (fig. 14). The North Syrian group of sites, distinguished chiefly by its pottery, stretched from the coast eastward (Ras Shamra, Tell Judaidah, Judaidah Jabbul) across the Euphrates into the Jezireh (Tell Aswad [Balikh], Chagar Bazar), This group continues the traditions of the Middle Euphrates group and the more northerly of the West Syrian sites in Neolithic 2. Several of the Middle Euphrates sites (Abu Hureyra, Buqras, El Kum) were, of course, occupied until some time in Neolithic 3, while Ras Shamra farther west was inhabited throughout the new stage. The South Syrian group has its origins in the more southerly of the Neolithic 2 West Syrian sites. The pottery and other remains found on these sites (Byblos, Tabbat el-Hammam, Tell Labweh, Tell Ramad, Ha-Goshrim) differ in detail from material on sites in the North Syrian group. The artifacts are also more varied, an indication of increasing cultural diversity, so that it is possible to distinguish three subgroups within the South Syrian complex. These are sites on the Lebanese coast, in the Beqac, and the Damascus basin (Moore 1978: 328). I have already described the degree to which the Palestinian group of sites differed from those farther north in Neolithic 3. Within Palestine there was also some local diversity so that two sub- groups of sites can be defined, mainly on differ- ences in pottery decoration. One is in north (Munhatta, Shacar Ha-Golan, Megiddo) and the other in south Palestine (Jericho, Wadi Rabah, Lydda). A comparison of the distribution maps of sites occupied in Neolithic 2 and 3 (figs. 8, 14) indicates that a major relocation of settlement took place after 6000 B.c. The population abandoned the steppic interior almost completely and moved westward and northward to found new settlements in the Mediterranean forest and open woodland of the steppe edge. This change in the pattern of settlement took place for several reasons. I have discussed these in detail elsewhere (Moore 1979: 70; 1983, in press), but it will be useful to summarize them here in order to demonstrate what fundamental deductions can be made concerning adjustments in economy, settlement patterns, and culture once the basic archaeological material has been syste- matically ordered. The increase in population during Neolithic 2 placed an increasing strain on the already delicate economic balance sustaining settled life, a balance that relied on both simple farming and stock-breeding but also on continued hunting and gathering. About 6000 B.c. a change had to be made that involved a shift to almost complete dependence upon cultivation and herd- ing of not only sheep and goats but also of cattle and pigs. Such a way of life could be better carried out in the forest zones to the west and north where there was adequate rainfall to sustain a full agricultural economy. The new adjustment in economy and pattern of settlement coincided with a deterioration in envi- ronment that significantly affected the steppe zone. Rainfall decreased while the temperature rose towards its Holocene maximum.6 These climatic changes altered the vegetation by causing the forest zones to shrink. Man himself was also degrading the steppe vegetation in the areas that he had settled. Thus a change in environment, partly caused by man, contributed to this altera- tion in the Neolithic way of life. It should now be clear that the transition from Neolithic 2 to 3 marked not only a significant cultural change but also a major economic one. The adjustment was really from a pattern of existence that was first established at the outset of Neolithic 1 to one that characterized the remain- ing millennia of the Neolithic. For these reasons it is useful to regard Neolithic 1 and 2 together as an Archaic and Neolithic 3 and 4 as a Developed Neolithic. Neolithic 4, 5000-3750 B.c. Central and northern Syria passed into the Halaf cultural sphere at the end of Neolithic 3. There was a strong underlying element of con- tinuity in both artifacts and economy from Neo- lithic 3 to Halaf in these areas, but they now belonged within a culture that stretched eastward from the Mediterranean to the foothills of the Zagros. The pattern of uniform cultural develop- ment that had obtained throughout the Levant at least since the Epipalaeolithic was broken. In Syria south of the latitude of Homs, in Lebanon, and in Palestine a new cultural configu- ration developed after 5000 B.c. This stage I call Neolithic 4. The pattern of settlement remained much the same as in Neolithic 3, and several sites</page><page sequence="26">26 ANDREW M. T. MOORE BASOR 246 continued to be occupied during the transition to Neolithic 4, among them Byblos, Jericho, and Munhatta. There was also continuity in cultural traditions from Neolithic 3 to 4. Neolithic 4 in Palestine is the same as the stage I have called Late Neolithic phase 2 (Moore 1973: 57). Byblos continued to be inhabited throughout Neolithic 4. The sequence of occupation there has been divided into two phases, ndolithique moyen and ndolithique recent (Dunand 1973: 95, 127). Jericho was also occupied for the whole of this stage during the Pottery Neolithic B phase (Ken- yon 1979: 46). The Neolithic 4 occupation at Munhatta was in level 2A or the Wadi Rabah phase (Perrot 1968: col. 416). Other important sites occupied during Neolithic 4 were Muktara, Tell Ard Tlaili, Tell Ain Nfaikh, Sheikh Ali (strata Ib, Ic, and II; Prausnitz 1970: 98), and Wadi Rabah (structures B and C; Kaplan 1958b: 153). Houses in Neolithic 4 were built in much the same way as in Neolithic 3. Those of nmolithique moyen Byblos often had two rooms, one large and one small (Dunand 1973: 95 ff). The houses in ndolithique recent were much longer, although they still only had two or three rooms. House floors in both phases were made simply of trampled earth or chalk. Pit dwellings continued to be used in Palestine during Neolithic 4, but gradually these were sup- planted by rectilinear structures similar to those found on sites further north. The earliest Pottery Neolithic B dwellings at Jericho were circular pit houses with walls of plano-convex or bun bricks. Later both curved and rectilinear structures were built with stone foundations and bun brick walls. Finally, more substantial buildings were con- structed with stone walls (Kenyon 1979: 49). Quite well preserved multi-roomed rectilinear houses have been excavated at Munhatta and Sheikh Ali, while traces of others have been found at Wadi Rabah and cEin el-Jarba in phase IV (Kaplan 1969: 5). Burial practices in Neolithic 4 continued tradi- tions established in Neolithic 3. Few if any burials have been found at most sites, indicating that the dead were disposed of elsewhere as in the preced- ing stage. Some burials were found within the settlement in both ndolithique moyen and r'cent at Byblos. Most adults had been laid in a crouched position in simple earth graves and the bodies of children were buried in jars (Dunand 1973: 99, 100, 136), practices similar to those of ndolithique ancien. During ndolithique moyen there was a revival of the custom of secondary burial (Dunand 1973: 99), last seen in Neolithic 2. In several instances special attention was given to the skulls. There is some evidence of similar practices at cEin el-Jarba (Kaplan 1969: 5), but at Byblos they lapsed once more in nmolithique recent. Pottery in Neolithic 4 was better made than in Neolithic 3. Vessels were fashioned in a greater variety of shapes, while new kinds of decoration were employed. Some pots continued to be deco- rated with incised designs, but many of the finer vessels were coated with a red wash or slip that was often burnished. At Byblos flat-based dishes or plates (Dunand 1973: 104) and bowls with flared sides (fig. 15:b) were first made in this stage. Tall flat-based jars (fig. 15:a) gradually replaced the globular ones (Dunand 1973: 148); both these and other large pots had loop handles for lifting. In ndeolithique moyen several kinds of decoration were employed, including incised pat- terns, pattern burnish, and red or brown paint or slip. Most nmolithique recent vessels, how- ever, were covered with red paint or slip and burnished. The pottery from Jericho in Pottery Neolithic B consisted of a fine ware and a coarse ware only a little less crude than that of Pottery Neolithic A. The most common vessels in the fine ware were jars with hole-mouths or splayed necks (fig. 16:a). An innovation was the bow-rim jar, also found on several contemporary sites in the Beqac, among them Tell ed-Jisr, Tell Ain Nfaikh and Tell Ard Tlaili. There was also a greater variety of bowls and cups, some of which had splayed or carinated sides (fig. 16:b). Many of these vessels were decorated with red wash or slip, which was some- times carried over the rim. A few had incised decoration, in particular a band of herringbones just below the rim. Similar pottery has been found at Wadi Rabah, Munhatta 2A (fig. 17), Sheikh Ali, and other Neolithic 4 Palestinian sites. This material most closely resembles that from the Beqac sites to the north. Neolithic 4 chipped stone assemblages, while in the tradition of the Neolithic 3 industry, did show some further modification. Fewer types of tools were made, and the proportions of these differed from those of Neolithic 3 assemblages. In particu- lar, the proportions of arrowheads and scrapers declined, a further indication of the decreasing importance of hunting, while those of sickle blades grew. More heavy cutting tools such as axes and adzes were used, particularly on sites in</page><page sequence="27">1982 FOUR-STAGE SEQUENCE FOR THE LEVANTINE NEOLITHIC 27 ....:l /..... b b a o 20 cm cm Fig. 15. Neolithic 4 pottery from Byblos: a. jars; b. bowls (after Dunand). the uplands. Sickle blades were common at Byblos in both ndolithique moyen and r'cent (J. Cauvin 1968: 100, 128). They were segmented and usually had finely denticulated cutting edges (fig. 18:a). On the other hand, there were very few tanged arrow- heads in ndolithique moyen and none at all in ndolithique rdcent (J. Cauvin 1968: 127). The only arrowheads made in the latter phase were of the tranchet variety, a type also used on coastal sites in Palestine in both Neolithic 3 and 4. About 19% of the assemblage in both phases consisted of flaked and polished axes, adzes, and chisels (J. Cauvin 1968: 105, 135, 150). Most of these were either trapezoidal or rectangular in shape (fig. 18:b, c, d). In ndolithique rccent some of the axes and adzes had sliced sides (fig. 18:b). Flint assemblages similar to the material from Byblos have been found on many surface sites and settlement mounds in Lebanon, among them Naccache, Tell Arslan, Tell Ain Nfaikh, Tell ed- Jisr, and cAmQq I. Similar material has also been excavated at Muktara (J. Cauvin 1963) and Tell Ard Tlaili. The flint assemblages from Neolithic 4</page><page sequence="28">28 ANDREW M. T.

Neolithic 4 pottery from Pottery Neolithic B Jericho: a. jars; b. bowls; c. handle; d. mat-impressed base. sites in Palestine seem to have resembled those of Neolithic 3 sites in the same area, so far as one can tell on the evidence available at present. There are a number of Neolithic 4 sites in the uplands of southern Lebanon and northern Pales- tine from which distinctive flint assemblages have been recovered but few, if any, other finds. These are the "Heavy Neolithic" or "Campignian" sites (Copeland and Wescombe 1965: 43; J. Cauvin and M.-C. Cauvin 1968: 103). The flint assem- blages comprised some flint tools and consider- able quantities of waste, both of which were relatively large and coarse. Among the tools were axes, adzes, chisels, picks, and some scrapers. Arrowheads and sickle blades were rare or absent. The waste included flakes, thick blades, crested blades, "orange slices," and cores. The Heavy Neolithic type-site is Karaoun II in the southern Beqac, an area in which several others have been located. More are known from elsewhere in the Beqac (Kefraya, Mejdel Anjar I), from the Wadi Farah in Galilee (Turville-Petre</page><page sequence="29">1982 FOUR-STAGE SEQUENCE FOR THE LEVANTINE NEOLITHIC 29 .... iIlI "" """ " "" " " " 0 20  cm ........... ............

Neolithic 4 pottery from Munhatta: a. jars; b. bowls (after Perrot). 1927: 109), and from the seaward side of the mountains of Lebanon (Fadaous South, Mtaileb I). These sites are near sources of flint: the material from them and the unfinished state of some of the tools indicate that they were factory sites on which tools, mostly of a kind for working timber, were roughed out (J. Cauvin and M.-C. Cauvin 1968: 113). Obsidian continued to reach the Levant in small quantities during Neolithic 4. Four pieces have been analyzed from Byblos, of which three came from sources near Lake Van and one from Ciftlik (Renfrew, Dixon, and Cann 1966: table 1). Of three pieces analyzed from a site near Hazorea, two also came from Van and one from Ciftlik (Wright and Gordus 1969: 81). Thus obsidian from both eastern Anatolia and Cappadocia was still being used. Most other artifacts found on Neolithic 4 sites were similar to those made in Neolithic 3. Fewer stone vessels were manufactured, probably indi- cating the greater utility of pottery in this stage. Otherwise, traditional crafts continued to be prac- ticed much as before. An active trade continued in materials found within the Levant, such as basalt, limestone, and flint. Long distance trade, by contrast, declined further from the level of Neolithic 3. Greenstones, the raw material for small axes and chisels found on a number of sites, continued to be imported from sources in northwest Syria or the Taurus. Some obsidian from Anatolia also continued to be used in the Levant. The only other raw material obtained from distant sources was steatite, used to make a few objects at Byblos. Nothing was obtained from Sinai, probably because the area was still uninhabited, and regular exchange with regions far to the northeast ceased. We see here one result of the coming of Halaf; for the time being contacts between the Levant and other regions diminished. Although the Neolithic 4 sites I have mentioned are grouped within the same general cultural con- figuration, local traditions may also be defined that were quite as marked as those in Neolithic 3. Two of the same main groups of sites found in Neolithic 3 also occur in this stage, that is, a South Syrian group and a Palestinian group (fig. 19). Within the South Syrian group strong local traditions in chipped stone and pottery assemblages can be seen in sites on the Lebanese coast (Byblos, Tell Arslan, Muktara), in the Beqac (Tell Ard Tlaili, Tell Ain Nfaikh, Tell ed- Jisr), and in the Damascus basin (Tell Ramad, Tell al-Khazzami). These subgroups of sites con- tinue into a later stage local traditions that were evident in Neolithic 3. Three subgroups may be defined within the Palestinian group, principally on local idiosyn- cracies in pottery (Moore 1973: 57). The first is a South Palestine group, comprising sites in the southern Jordan valley, Judean hills, and the lowlands southwest to the Wadi Gaza (Jericho, Tell el-Farcah, Ziqim). The second is a North Palestine group, consisting of a few sites in the northern Jordan valley and valleys to the west (Munhatta, Sheikh Ali). The third is a West Pal- estine group, which includes sites in the Plain of Esdraelon, in the hills of western Galilee, and on the central coastal plain (Wadi Rabah, Hazorea sites, Kabri).

MOORE BASOR 246 (fig. 19) shows that many more sites were inhab- ited than in Neolithic 3. The change to an econ- omy based almost wholly on arable farming and stockbreeding permitted another sharp increase in population. Yet settlement remained confined to the Mediterranean forest zone, the area in which this kind of subsistence farming could most productively be pursued. The only significant alteration in the pattern of settlement was an expansion into the upland zone. These sites appear to have been used by transhumant pastoralists from valley-bottom settlements who took their animals into the hills to graze during the summer. This more intense exploitation of the uplands is probably linked to the increase in population and consequent denser pattern of settlement and arable farming on the lowlands. The transition from Neolithic 4 to the Chalco- lithic in Palestine took place about 3750 B.C. or a little later. There is a date of 3740 + 140 B.C. (Kaplan 1969: 27) for phase IV at cEin el-Jarba at the very end of Neolithic 4, while most dates for the Chalcolithic in Palestine fall within the second half of the 4th millennium (Perrot 1969: col. 439). There are no radiocarbon dates for the transition from Neolithic 4 to the Chalcolithic in Lebanon, but given the similarities between much of the material from the eneolithique at Byblos and other sites and the Ghassulian in Palestine, it is probable that the change took place at about the same time there. Commentary Several general comments may be made con- cerning the scheme outlined above. In the first place, it would appear that the major cultural changes from one stage to the next took place rapidly. They also seem to have happened at about the same time throughout Levant. Examples of this are the innovations in both typology and technology of the chipped stone industries from Neolithic 1 to 2 and the rapid spread of pottery manufacture to much of the Levant, though only later into Palestine, at the outset of Neolithic 3. It also seems, on the evidence we have at present, that many of these cultural changes took place in the transition from one stage to the next. They were followed by periods of consolidation in which each innovation was assimilated and its full poten- tial exploited. The rapidity of these cultural changes from one stage to the next and the fact that they seem to have occurred almost simul- taneously in much of the Levant emphasize both the cultural and geographical unity of the region during the Neolithic. I should add that these inferences depend very much on the coarse chro- nology that it is possible to construct at the moment. More chronological precision, particu- larly for developments within each stage, may require them to be modified. The broad cultural unity found in the Levant from one stage of the Neolithic to another and the apparent rapidity with which innovations were accepted indicate that local communities were in close contact with their neighbors. Neolithic so- cieties in the Levant seem to have been open to new developments, ready to accept cultural changes and technological innovations of clear value to them. These characteristics may be seen in all four stages, although local cultural tradi- tions did develop increasingly through time. The latter trend was the direct result of increases in population, particularly in Neolithic 2, and of more permanent settlement. These factors may have been partly responsible for the decline in long distance exchange evident throughout the Developed Neolithic. One further point should be made. The major cultural changes in each stage of the Neolithic seem to have been for the most part of local inspiration. The Levant throughout the Neolithic was relatively unaffected by cultural developments that took place in neighboring regions of the Near East.7 NOTES 'These and all other dates mentioned in this article are based on uncalibrated radiocarbon determinations calculated accord- ing to the standard half life. 2My description is based on my own study of the Jericho material. A full report on these assemblages will be published by Payne in the forthcoming volumes on the Jericho excava- tions. I would like to record my thanks to the late Dame Kathleen Kenyon, who supervised my doctoral thesis, for allowing me to study and comment upon the Neolithic material and records of her excavations at Jericho.</page><page sequence="33">1982 FOUR-STAGE SEQUENCE FOR THE LEVANTINE NEOLITHIC 33 'These observations are based on a study of the flints deposited in the British Museum from rectangle 500 of the recent excavations.

These new deter- minations will be published in Volume III of the Jericho excavations. They suggest that the PPNA phase at Jericho may have continued for much of the 8th millennium B.c. This may mean that the transition from Neolithic 1 to 2 took place later in Palestine than further north. I am indebted to Mr. R. Burleigh for this information, made available in advance of publication. 5More complete accounts of the results of the excavation may be found in Moore 1975, 1979. 6The idea of a period of desiccation in the Levant in the 5th millennium B.C. was advanced by J.
