<plain_text><page sequence="1">Inconsistency in Roman Epic: Studies in Catullus, Lucretius, Vergil, Ovid and Lucan. By James J. O'Hara. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (Roman Literature and Its Contexts). 2007. Pp. xiv, 165. In another fine volume from this notable series, O'Hara explores the topic of inconsis tency in five Latin epic poets; he is surely right to regard Catullus 64 and Lucretius (and indeed Ovid's Metamorphoses) as belonging to epos in ancient terms. O'Hara's main contentions are that major inconsistencies have interpretative value in indicating literary and/or ideological purposes, and that this is an established feature of the epic genre, often highlighted at a poem's beginning; this naturally favours the "unitarian" approach (inconsistencies express something key to the work) over the "analytical" one (they are oversights or transmission slippages). In his first chapter (8-32) he establishes that such inconsistencies go back not just to hellenistic precedent (e.g., the issue of whether the Argo is the first ship is already raised in Apollonius) but to Homer; he is not afraid to admit that some inconsistencies demand an analytical explanation (e.g., the dual verbs in the embassy of Iliad Book 9, clearly looking back to a two-person delegation at an earlier stage of composition), but lays down some important principles for the unitarian approach: the needs of the particular scene or dramatic episode are often more important than overall consistency, and accordingly we should not require ancient epics to show an anachronistic interest in deep and consistent characterisation (nor tragedies: he righdy alludes to the work of Tycho von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf), while the tendency of ancient epos to allude to alternative forms of its plots and myths is established from the earliest point (e.g., Helen is linked with both Troy and Egypt in the Odyssey, alluding to two separate versions of her travels). The chapter on Catullus 64 (33-54) looks at the oft-noted inconsistency that the Argo here seems to be the first ship (64.11) while the flashback passage of 64.51-264 clearly shows Theseus sailing (64.53). O'Hara ties this up nicely with the matching inconsistency on the matter of heroic virtue (the famous vestis is said to contain heroum virtutes but all we get is the deserting Theseus, and the great Achilles of the Fates' prophecy is a homicidal maniac?the wonderfully ironic quare of line 372 is righdy highlighted), and points to the irony created by the contrast between the internal narrator and audience and the knowing implied reader. One could indeed argue further that the poem highlights the problem of reliability at its very beginning by prominendy presenting the whole story as hearsay</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS/COMPTES RENDUS 409 (dicuntur, 64.2). This is all nicely done: I would have also welcomed some account of the poem's complex end, which contains further potential inconsistency with its opening (the "modern" vices listed of, e.g., fratricide and incest are of course famously prominent in the heroic period). The chapter on Lucretius (55-76) mainly considers the famously paradoxical opening of the poem, in which the goddess Venus is called on to intervene in Rome in an Epicurean work which otherwise regards divine non-intervention as axiomatic and indeed notes this prominently in the same proem (1.44-49, rightly retained in the text). O'Hara neatly links this with the traditional idea of the "anti-Lucretius in Lucretius," and makes the essential points for the modern reader: the conventional Roman reader is being moved from familiar and traditional material in the divine invocation to a new philosophical view of the world, and there are clear tensions between Epicurean serenity and rationality and poetic tradition and passion. One might usefully add that it is in order to package the revolutionary with the conventional that Lucretius adopts the familiar but already highly archaic style of the century-old school author Ennius, a complete contrast with the modern style of the contemporary Catullus 64. The chapter on the Aeneid (77-104) contains an excellent collection of the (many) inconsistent variant myths in the poem, and argues that these lead to an air of overall uncertainty as well as indicating some fundamental oppositions (e.g., both Ascanius and Silvius Aeneas are presented as the heirs of Aeneas, reflecting the key Trojan/Italian tension). As in the author's previous work on the Aeneid, concerns over inconsistency spill over into the poem's theology: for example, the argument that Jupiter is worrying since he can swear falsely by the Styx in Book 10 has some validity, but this is merely one of the moments where the poem presents us with the tension between a Stoic providential Jupiter and the Homeric Zeus, a tension famously highlighted at Aeneid 1.11, tantaene animis caelestibus iraef Here as elsewhere O'Hara is surely right that these are not just surface inconsistencies which would have been ironed out in a final version, though he admits that three of his five main texts (Lucretius, Virgil, and Lucan) are formally unfinished. The chapter on Ovid's Metamorphoses (104-130) begins by arguing that there is a formal inconsistency between Ovid's animus and the gods as the formal motor of the poem (1.1-2); not all will be so anxious about this, but the point is well linked with the general idea of debating human/divine causation for action (cf. Aeneid 9.184 185). The disjunction between the beneficent demiurge of Met. 1.5-88 and the amoral anthropomorphic gods otherwise present in the poem is a good point; this surely replays the Olympian/philosophical theological tension of the Aeneid just observed above. Though O'Hara laudably refrains from ascribing all mutability in the poem to its theme of metamorphosis, this is surely relevant to some of the features he sees, for example its openness to other genres (again a Virgilian feature). Mythic variants and chronological inconsistencies are again usefully collected. Once again he sees these slippages as rendering the poem uncertain on key ideological issues, for example,. Augustanism; here one might alternatively explain the contrast of the loyalism of 1.199-205 with the resistance of 15.871 as the result of the latter's post-exilic composition (he is laudably aware of this last issue: 128, n. 68). Political inconsistency is a key feature again in the chapter on Lucan (131-142). Here O'Hara takes on the familiar issue of the clash between the apparent Caesarian encomium of the poem's opening address to Nero and the plainly anti-Caesarian rhetoric of its later books; he acutely points out that as for Lucretius, Lucan's poem begins with a divine</page><page sequence="3">410 PHOENIX invocation which later developments throw into question (one could indeed say the same about the invocation of the semi-divine heroes at Catullus 64.42-43). He feels that the biographical explanation by which Lucan changes his view over time after quarrelling with Nero is unsatisfying, but it is plausible for many. Overall, he provides an excellent discussion of the most important Lucan scholarship of the last twenty years, finding Masters's link between the powerful actor Caesar and the creating poet Lucan especially attractive. In sum, this book will be key reading for scholars and students of these texts. As usual in O'Hara's work, we find rewarding, well-documented, and well-focused analyses which are not afraid to attack some fundamental and long-debated issues, and all will benefit from his keen intelligence, clear arguments, and instinct for the central points at stake in the interpretation of the works treated.
