<plain_text><page sequence="1">Restaging the Hurt: Henry James and the Artist as Masochist David McWhirter Was Henry James a "boy who could not become a man?" In arguing that James "fail[ed] to achieve manhood" in the terms defined by his culture, Alfred Habegger points to Henry James Senior's "determi- n[ation] that his sons would be different" and to "the power vacuum" left in the younger James's life by a "visionary, erratic, and ineffective" father who "lacked a professional or public role in a country that defined men by the way they earned a living away from home."1 A few years before he died, James would celebrate his father's "living interest in [his children] and his living superiority to all greed of authority, all over- reaching or overemphasising 'success,' at least in the heated short run."2 But as a boy, James must have seen this "superiority" as a disturbing sign of weakness and the path to manhood as perplexingly difficult. How does a son learn to identify with a father who refuses to exercise authority and whose "work" is divorced from any identifiable occupa- tion? On what grounds does he rebel against a parent who never chal- lenged his children's "complete freedom of inward, not less than [their] natural ingenuity of outward, experience" (A, 336), and who famously insisted that they just "be something, something unconnected with specific doing, something free and uncommitted, something finer in short than being that, whatever it was, might consist of" (A, 268)?3 Unable to achieve an appropriately masculine identity within the oedipal framework authorized by his culture, James could not help "feeling that as a boy [he] showed more poorly than girls" (A, 217)- a feeling he continually projected and explored in his self-doubting, pas- sive, feminized male protagonists. Of all these figures, perhaps none is more annoying than Nick Dormer, the would-be portrait painter of The Tragic Muse- a novel that is especially intriguing in its ambivalent handling of the oedipal scenario.4 Nick embodies James's fullest explo- ration of the cost and profit of the artist's vocation and his most direct Texas Studies in Literature and Language, Vol. 33, No. 4, Winter 1991 ®1991 by the University of Texas Press, P.O. Box 7819, Austin, TX 78713</page><page sequence="2">James and the Artist as Masochist 465 treatment of "the conflict between art and 'the world' " that he identifies in his preface for the novel as "one of the half-dozen great primary motives" for his fiction (AN, 79). Yet given the centrality of these themes for James, and his presumably strong identification with his artist-hero, his portrayal of Nick is surprisingly unsympathetic, espe- cially in its emphasis on Nick's embarrassed reluctance to commit him- self to his art. Indeed, as Nick struggles toward a recognition that his "little hobby" is in fact a serious "passion" (TM, 56), James portrays him as an increasingly evasive character whose only choice is to "let others choose for him" (TM, 178). Early in the novel Nick allows those "others"- his family and friends, his politically ambitious fiancée (Julia Dallow), and especially his dead but still powerfully present father- to launch him in a conventionally masculine political career. But this career, as Nick is acutely aware, is a sham. Elected to Parliament largely through Julia's exertions, he is, as his mother, Lady Agnes, remarks, " 'her member' " (TM, 165). Nick thus masquerades as the public man the others want him to be while furtively pursuing his "little hobby" in the privacy of his studio. But if Nick's hypocrisy is disturbing here, he becomes almost despic- able when- in a remarkable display of passive aggression- he manipu- lates Julia into acknowledging for him his "'inner-most preference'" for the artist's solitary pleasures (TM, 294). Nick hesitates to pursue the life-in-art he so patently desires in part because he has internalized his culture's conviction that art is somehow immoral; the view he mockingly attributes to his mother-" 'the only thing that can justify [art], the effort to carry it as far as one can,' " he explains, " 'she regards as just the dangerous, the criminal element' " (TM, 17)- is one Nick himself never wholly abandons. Because he understands his desire as "dangerous" and "criminal," Nick in effect forces Julia to break off their engagement, thus confirming and enforcing that desire for him; in other words, he makes her make the choice. Thus, in a key exchange that is almost pain- ful to read, it is Julia who must articulate for Nick the reality of the intensely passionate and eroticized absorption he experiences as he bends over his easel- an aesthetic bliss she has witnessed earlier in the day when she unexpectedly visited his studio. " 'That's what you like -doing what you were this morning,"' she exclaims: '"You love it, you revel in it; that's what you want, and it's the only thing you want!' " When she insists that his art is his " 'secret passion,' " Nick responds, as he does throughout the scene, by belittling the power and intensity Julia has glimpsed in the studio as '"an accident,' " no more than '"a little go at something serious"': '"Bless your soul, that wasn't art,' plead[s] Nick. 'The real thing . . . will never come into the house, soyez tranquille/ " In the face of Nick's pathetic disavowals, Julia assumes the</page><page sequence="3">466 David McWhirter decisive and (in James's terms) masculine role by acknowledging that their life together " 'would be a great deception' " and by telling Nick that he " 'must be a great artist.' " " 'I'm not afraid of the truth, but you are,'" she cries; '"don't pretend, don't pretend!'" Julia's definitive assertion-" 'you're an artist: you are, you are' " (TM, 294-98)- is thus received by Nick as a verdict of guilt, a sentence of doom, but also, unmistakably, as a longed-for liberation. James's staging of this initiation into art as a drama of passive victimi- zation, a scene of pleasurable punishment inflicted by an external authority, becomes even more resonant when we take into account the novelist's persistent association of Julia with the "oppressive" authority assigned to Nick's father (TM, 164). Bound by "a sort of paternal dedica- tion" to follow in his father's political footsteps- in a "long, supreme" deathbed interview, Nick's father has "la[id] upon him the great mission of carrying out the unachieved and reviving a silent voice" (TM, 63)- Nick's success in public life depends on an alliance of the forces inherent in Julia's money and his father's name. And when Lady Agnes pleads with her son to ensure that success by marrying Julia without further delay, she does not hesitate to invoke her husband's will: " 'Your father would have valued it for you beyond everything. Think a little what would have given him pleasure. . . . He's with you always. ... I ask for no sacrifice, and he would ask for none. We only ask that you don't commit the crime-' " (TM, 168). As if to salvage the missed op- portunity of his own boyhood, James initially appears to be shaping Nick's story along traditional oedipal lines: we expect that the son will achieve his mature identity as an artist by rebelling against the father's will and by learning to assert his own pleasure through an identification with and internalization of the father's masculine authority. But James in fact structures Nick's discovery of his vocation as a decisively negative oedipal resolution. For Nick does not actively choose to become an artist; rather, as we have seen, he arranges matters- with James's authorial complicity- so that he is pushed into the "crime" of art by Julia and the paternal authority she represents. If Nick wants to ex- perience "the beauty ... of having taken the world in the free, brave, personal way" which Gabriel Nash, the novel's Wildean aesthete, attributes to the artist (TM, 125), he can only achieve it, paradoxically, through a scenario of suffering rather than choice, of passivity and failure rather than freedom and bravery- a scenario that both expresses and confirms his conviction of his own guilt, disempowerment, and emasculation. To "take the world" in the "free" aesthetic way means to be taken by it. Like Kafka's Gregor Samsa, Nick abdicates all personal authority and invests others with the power to enforce his retreat into a realm- his</page><page sequence="4">James and the Artist as Masochist 467 secluded studio here substituting for Gregor' s locked room- where he can freely indulge his guilty, narcissistic pleasures, the "secret dissipa- tion" (TM, 260) of his art. "Stuck fast" in the doorway to his room ("left to himself," Kafka writes, "[he] could not have moved at all"), Gregor is both wounded and liberated "when from behind his father gave him a strong push which was literally a deliverance and he flew far into the room, bleeding freely."5 And if Kafka's tableau provides a useful ana- logue for Nick Dormer's "deliverance" into the bliss of art, it also bears a striking resemblance to the locus classicus of James's negative myth of the artist: the story of the "horrid even if an obscure hurt" suffered by the aspiring novelist as a young man on the brink of his own aesthetic initiation. As Leon Edel and others have made abundantly clear, the facts per- taining to this incident- James, "jammed into the acute angle between two high fences" while fighting a fire (a position that echoes Gregor' s entrapment in the doorway), appears to have injured his back (A, 415)- are less important than the psychological dynamics manifested in his appropriation of the event.6 I have argued elsewhere that James's fatalistic reconstruction of the episode allows him both to justify and to evade responsibility for the crucial life choices- his decision not to fight in the Civil War, his failure to pursue a romantic relationship with Minny Temple, his abandonment of America for Europe, as well as his commitment to an artistic career- that he was engaged in making at the time.7 By staging this scene as a "vast visitation" of "fortune's hand" that "sufficed to establish a relation- a relation to everything occurring round me not only for the next four years [the duration of the war] but for long afterward- that was at once extraordinarily intimate and quite awkwardly irrelevant" (A, 414-15), James once again links an artistic initiation with a destructive wounding at the hands of an all-powerful external authority: here "the dark power of Destiny" that Freud defines as "the last figure in the series [of punishing authority figures] that began with the parents."8 As he recounts the story in Notes of a Son and Brother, some fifty years after its occurrence, James is able to recognize his response to the accident as a series of "steps by which I came to think of my relation to my injury as a modus vivendi workable for the time" (A, 416). And even at the time, he surmises, he must have under- stood that his "obscure hurt" conveniently justified, "in the public eye," and thus in his own, the "season of some retirement" required "for an ordeal essentially intellectual": The beauty was . . . that studious retirement and preparatory hours did after all supply the supine attitude, did invest the ruefulness, did deck out the cynicism of lying down book in hand with a certain</page><page sequence="5">468 David McWhirter fine plausibility. This was at least a negative of combat, an organised, not a loose and empty one, something definitely and firmly parallel to action in the tented field. (A, 417) But if James thus attempts to recuperate the "crime" of his vocation as "at least a negative of combat," he does so by inviting a shattering con- firmation of his self-perceived failures as a heterosexual American man: "to have trumped up a lameness at such a juncture," he acknowledges, "could be made to pass in no light for graceful." "What was interesting from the first" about the injury, James remarks, "was my not doubting in the least its duration" (A, 415). And it is this "wish that the hurt might endure" (Edel, UY, 180) that most compellingly confirms the masochistic dynamic at work is the "ambiguous economy" (A, 422) of this carefully staged drama. In "The Economic Problem of Masochism" (1924), Freud describes a type of "moral masochism," "chiefly remarkable for having loosened its connection with what we recognize as sexuality," in which the masochist' s desired punishment no longer emanates directly from "the loved person," but from ap- parently "impersonal powers or ... circumstances" (SE, 19:165). Unsurprisingly, Freud insists that "only the fewest among us are able to look upon ['the dark power of Destiny'] as impersonal." The maso- chistic ego, disturbed by "an unconscious sense of guilt," seeks "punishment, whether from the super-ego or from [other] parental powers outside" the psyche; and the moral masochist clings to this "parental view of fate," thereby expiating his guilt over his self-con- ceived shortcomings through his suffering at what James calls "fortune's hand." The danger of masochistic desire is that it "creates a temptation" to fail, for failure invites the sought-after chastisement from the great parental power of Destiny. In order to provoke punishment from this last representative of the parents, the masochist must do what is inexpedient, must act against his own interests, must ruin the prospects which open out to him in the real world and must, perhaps, destroy his own real existence. (SE, 19:168-70) James's fatalistic appropriation of his injury is only the most con- spicuous instance of ids habitual stance toward what he once called "the cold Medusa-face of life" (N, 240) :9 "the soul of drama," he would write in his preface to The Wings of the Dove, is "a catastrophe deter- mined in spite of oppositions" (AN, 290). But if the over-determined drama of James's obscure hurt suggests his affinity with the moral masochist, we also need to recognize in it the contours of Freud's more</page><page sequence="6">James and the Artist as Masochist 469 primary "feminine" and "erotogenic" forms of masochism. "The maso- chist wants to be treated like a small and helpless child, but, particularly, like a naughty child," a wish that gives rise to fantasies that "place the subject in a characteristically female situation" (SE, 19:162). Freud is even more explicit about this point in "A Child Being Beaten" (1919), where he argues that masochistic men, in their "phantasies, as well as in the performances they go through for their realization, . . . invariably transfer themselves into the part of a woman; that is to say, their maso- chistic attitude coincides with a feminine one." Male masochism is thus related to the negative or "inverted" oedipal scenario we have already discerned in Nick Dormer, and to castration fantasies that permit the subject to achieve the "passive" or "feminine attitude towards his father" he desires (SE, 197-98). If we read the story of James's "obscure hurt" as a complex masochistic fantasy, as the expression of a wish that is inextricably bound up with guilt at his own impotence and feminiza- tion, it will come as no surprise that so many critics suspected for so long that his injury was in fact a genital wound: for the critics are only responding to the unmistakable tenor of the unconscious content James projected onto the studied obscurity of this "hurt." Indeed, if we accept Freud's mapping of the masochistic psyche (an "if" to which I shall return later in this essay), it seems impossible to avoid concluding that for James the price of entry into the palace of art was his incapacitation as a man. For James, as for Nick and Gregor, the liberation of and into aesthetic desire is effected by a castrating father. 1 As Paul John Eakin has remarked, James's "obscure hurt" is a signal instance of the pervasive modernist myth articulated by Edmund Wilson in his famous essay, "The Wound and the Bow": "the idea that genius and disease, like strength and mutilation, may be inextricably bound together."10 The frequency with which James restages his hurt, in the theater of his life as well as in the pages of his fiction, defines him as a crucial avatar not only of the problematical status of the artist in the "feminized" American culture analyzed by Ann Douglas11 but also of the masochistic self-authorizing strategies increasingly employed by high-modernist male writers in response to their real or perceived cultural and social marginalization. Habegger has argued that the modern writer's pose of "powerless elitism" is in fact an elaboration of James's self-justifying construction of the artist as "sissy"- a construc- tion necessitated by the novelist's "failure to achieve manhood in the culture where he passed his youth and most of his boyhood." Habeg- eer's portrait of the young Henry James, "crushed" and humiliated by</page><page sequence="7">470 David McWhirter the "crude complacency of power" (A, 128-29) displayed by other, successfully "initiated" boys, able to "solve[ ] his basic problem- how to find a possible male role"- only by "becoming] feminine," seems painfully accurate; yet what is most striking is that so many of the moments that confirm Habegger's view of James's "aborted masculine initiation" also serve, for the novelist, as productive aesthetic initia- tions.12 Thus in an often-quoted passage from A Small Boy and Others, James describes a devastating rejection at the hands of his older brother William in terms that anticipate his structuring of his obscure yet en- abling hurt: I remember that on my once offering him my company in condi- tions, those of some planned excursion, in which it wasn't desired, his putting the question of our difference to rest, with the minimum of explanation, by the responsible remark: "I play with boys who curse and swear!" I had sadly to recognise that I didn't, that I couldn't pretend to have come to that yet. ... It wasn't that I mightn't have been drawn to the boys in question, but that I simply wasn't qualified. All boys, I rather found, were difficult to play with. . . . They account but little, moreover, I make out, for W.J.'s eclipses; so that I take refuge easily enough in the memory of my own pursuits, absorbing enough at times to have excluded other views. I also plied the pencil, or to be more exact the pen- even if neither implement critically, rapidly or summarily. I was so often engaged at that period, it strikes me, in literary- or to be more precise in dramatic, accompanied by pictorial composition- that I must again and again have delightfully lost myself. (A, 147-48) James's masochistic dynamic is here adumbrated once again, as William's brutal, emasculating dismissal is made to provoke and authorize the first stirrings of Henry's artistic desire- a scenario that becomes all the more devastating and presumably, for Henry, all the more necessary, if we accept Richard Hall's argument that James was homoerotically fix- ated on his older brother.13 James continued to acknowledge William's "characteristic authority- his enjoyment of it coming," he recognizes, "from my character ... as much as from his own" (A, 15)- for most of his adult life; indeed, in 1910, just a few days after William's death, James would write that "from far back in dimmest childhood he had been my ideal Elder Brother, and I still, through all the years, saw in him, even as a small timorous boy yet, my protector, my backer, my authority and my pride" (L, IV:561). James's relationship with William, which figures so centrally in Edel' s biography, is mainly interesting to me here insofar as it contributes</page><page sequence="8">James and the Artist as Masochist 471 to an understanding of a larger pattern in the novelist's relationship with his audiences, an arena where James's penchant for restaging the hurt is very much in evidence. Introducing the boyhood episode dis- cussed above, James remarks, "I can't have been often for [William] a deprecated, still less an actively rebuffed suitor, because . . . such aggressions were so little in order for me" (A, 147). But James's vaunted passivity, like Nick Dormer's, is itself a form of aggression. And as a determined "suitor" for William's approval, James was once again inviting failure and defeat- unless we understand, as I think we should, that what James really wanted from William was the same wounding but liberating rejection that Nick succeeds in extracting from Julia. James must have recognized early on that this "ideal" authority figure could never provide him with the praise he ostensibly craved: again and again William would demonstrate that he was incapable, emotionally and intellectually, of approaching his novelist-brother's life-work with any real sympathy or understanding. What emerges most clearly from an examination of the intellectual relationship played out in the James brothers' correspondence is the painful history of Henry's repeatedly frustrated attempts to convince William of the value of what he once called his "particular divergence" (N, 438), and of the viability of his personal conception and practice of the art of fiction.14 From the first, William unerringly aims his criticisms at precisely those aspects of Henry's work that are most uniquely his. If he is annoyed by Henry's "tendency to return on an idea and over- refine it" (JF, 318), he is also "struck unfavorably by the tendency of the personages to reflect on themselves and give an acute critical scientific introspective classification of their own natures and states of mind" (JF, 323). "In my opinion," he tells his younger brother, "what you should cultivate is directness of style" (/F, 321). William occasionally apologizes for having "assumed a rather law-giving tone" (/F, 317), but continues to attack Henry for "not doing less elaborate things for wider audiences" (/F, 333)- an accusation that must have hit home, given James's own profound disappointment at his failure to achieve broader popularity. After 1895 William grows increasingly hostile to his brother's fictional technique. Responding to a volume of James's stories, entitled, significantly, Embarrassments, he opines that "this recent manner of yours of using such an excessively small bit of matter, and that so fanci- ful, to show a great deal of art by, seems to me to be full of peril, if you get deeper into it" (JF, 337). By the time of The Wings of the Dove, William arrives at a bluntness that recalls his childish "explanation" of why Henry "wasn't qualified" to play with him: "What shall I say of a book constructed on a method which so belies everything that I acknowledge as law?" (JF, 338). Indeed, much of what William has to say about his</page><page sequence="9">472 David McWhirter brother's work seems rooted in that original dismissal- "I play with boys who curse and swear." The aspects of Henry's art that strike William as most objectionable are inevitably those- his indirectness, elaboration, and resistance to "naming it straight" (JF, 341)- that mark Henry as feminized. William's comments on The American Scene sum up his reaction to his brother's entire career: "For gleams and innuendoes and felicitous verbal insinuations you are unapproachable, but the core of literature is solid. Give it to us once again!" (JF, 342). When James responds to these criticisms, his efforts to justify himself and his work in his brother's eyes are at best "timorous" and self-depre- cating. "I think," he writes to William after receiving his negative judg- ment of The Europeans, you take these things too rigidly and unimaginatively- too much as if an artistic experiment were a piece of conduct, to which one's life was somehow committed; but I think also that you're quite right in pronouncing the book "thin," and empty. ... I don't think how- ever you are always right by any means. ... I don't trust your judgment altogether (if you will permit me to say so) about details. (L, 11:193) James's "defense" of his work here- his insistence that his novel is merely an "experiment" rather than "a piece of conduct"- recalls Nick's cowardly denigration of his "little hobby." But if James seems to understand that William is fundamentally unsympathetic to what is best and most original in his work, his need for his older brother's im- primatur persists. Thus when William praises The Tragic Muse, the novelist is "plunged . . . into a glow of satisfaction" that lasts for weeks and "can only thank [him] tenderly for seeing so much good in the clumsy thing" (L, 111:300). And when the adored, "law-giving" Elder Brother pronounces The Bostonians a failure, Henry feels he has been subjected to "a very cold douche indeed." James at first asserts himself - The Bostonians, he tells his brother, is "the best fiction I have written, and I expected you, if you said anything about it, would intimate that you thought as much" (L, 111:70)- but a few months later ruefully bows to William's authority, accepting his negative judgment of the work in which he had taken such pride: "I concur absolutely in all you say, and am more conscious than any reader can be of the redundancy of the book in the way of descriptive psychology, etc. There is far too much of the sort of thing you animadvert upon" (L, 111:101). Not until after the turn of the century does James find it in him to tell William what he must have felt all along. After acknowledging that his brother's "reflections" on The Wings of the Dove "greatly interest" him,</page><page sequence="10">James and the Artist as Masochist 473 James goes on to express his doubt that he "can very explicitly meet them": One writes as one can- and also as one sees, judges, feels, thinks, and I feel and think so much on the ignoble state to which in this age of every cheapness I see the novel as a form, reduced, that there is doubtless greatly, with me, the element of what I would as well as of what I "can." At any rate my stuff, such as it is, is inevitable for me. ... But I should think you might well fail of joy in it- for I certainly feel that it is, in its way, more and more positive. (/F, 338)1S In this characteristic maneuver, James revalues the sign of his failure- William's disapproval- as the sign of a more profound and "positive" success: his brother's rejection of his work proves its superiority to the productions of "this age of every cheapness." And when William reacts to The Golden Bowl by begging Henry- only half facetiously- "to please Brother" by writing "a new book, with no twilight or mustiness in the plot, with great vigor and decisiveness in the action, no fencing in the dialogue, no psychological commentaries, and absolute straightness in the style" (/F, 339), he puts himself, so to speak, just where Henry has always wanted him. The younger brother fires off a response which suggests just how necessary and enabling these sought-after rejections could be: I mean . . . to try to produce some uncanny form of thing, in fiction, that will gratify you, as Brother- but let me say, dear William, that I shall greatly be humiliated if you do like it, and thereby lump it, in your affection, with things, of the current age, that I have heard you express admiration for and that I would sooner descend to a dishonoured grave than have written. . . . But it is, seriously, too late at night and I am too tired, for me to express myself on this question- beyond saying that I'm always sorry when I hear of your reading anything of mine, and always hope you won't- you seem to me so constitutionally unable to "enjoy" it, and so condemned to look at it from a point of view remotely alien to mine in writing it, and to the conditions out of which, as mine, it has inevitably sprung. ... I see nowhere about me done or dreamed of the things that alone for me constitute the interest of the doing of the novel- and yet it is in a sacrifice of them on their very own ground that the thing you suggest to me evidently consists. It shows how far apart and to what different ends we have had to work out (very naturally and properly!) our respective intellectual lives. (L, IV:382-83)</page><page sequence="11">474 David McWhirter One can only wonder how long James had been holding this outburst- and its stunning conversion of William's authoritative rejection into an authoritative justification of his own aesthetic dream- in reserve. By transforming the scene of wounding into a scene of deliverance, James reenacts the drama through which he has always staged and confirmed his achievement of artistic identity. William's taste in novels was decidedly conventional, and his resis- tance to James's work- especially to his later style- reflects quite accu- rately the general tenor of their public reception. Moreover, Henry's mixed reactions to his brother's criticism- his strange readiness to accept judgments that he instinctively recognized as unjustified- adumbrates his curiously ambivalent relationship with the reading public as a whole. The myth that James was serenely unconcerned with popular opinion of his work has been decisively laid to rest, most recently and exhaus- tively by Mareia Jacobson and Michael Anesko.16 For all his frequent and eloquent expressions of disdain for "a public the draggling after which simply leads one in the gutter," James obviously desired the kind of public acclaim that his complex, refined, and intensely personal art could never win him. Thus on the one hand he tells William that he has "no illusions of any kind" about his novels' chances for "circulation and 'popularity.' From these things I am quite divorced and never was happier than since the dissolution has been consecrated by (what seems to me) the highest authorities" (L, 111:300). But on the other hand he complains bitterly to Ho wells of his lack of success: "I have felt, for a long time past, that I have fallen upon evil days- every sign or symbol of one's being wanted, anywhere or by any one, have so utterly failed" (L, 111:511). One thinks here of Ray Limbert, the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful novelist in James's story, "The Next Time," who desperately wants to write a best seller; indeed, the denouement of this story- the public's wholesale rejection of Limbert's attempt at a potboiler allows him to achieve "a grand indifference ... a reckless consciousness of art" in which "the voice of the market had suddenly grown faint and far"17- suggests that what James really sought from this "highest authority" was the same thing he wanted from William: a ringing disapproval that would authorize the "reckless" and "crimi- nal" indulgence of his aesthetic desire. Read in this way, as yet another restaging of the strangely enabling hurt, James's ambivalent relationship to his audience can help to illumi- nate the deeply self-contradictory impulses evident in his appropriations of popular fictional genres and conventions. In her extended considera- tion of James's tendency to work both "within and against popular con- ventions," especially in the fictions of his so-called "middle period," Jacobson argues that the novelist consciously "used the conventions of</page><page sequence="12">James and the Artist as Masochist 475 contemporary fiction to appeal to his society at the same time as he examined it." "By modifying received conventions and so playing off his plots and characters against his readers' expectations," she asserts, James "expressed his critical [social] views within a framework that permitted him aesthetic distance."18 But if this argument seems hard to fault- James himself, in "The Art of Fiction," insisted that his com- mitment to realism demanded a break with the conventional closure of the happy ending his readers desired- James's persistence in setting up conventional expectations only to violate them also manifests the maso- chistic psychological dynamic explored in this essay. James, after all, did not simply ignore the conventions, as well he might have, given his hostility to what he once called "this age of trash triumphant."19 1 shall only note in passing that the celebrated discussion of realism and ro- mance in the Preface to The American springs from James's belated recognition that the Bellegardes' thwarting of Christopher Newman's marriage to Claire de Cintre- and hence his own faulty plotting of the novel- was a willful, almost perverse contravention of realistic norms. "I had dug in my path, alas," he remarks in a resonant sentence, "a hole into which I was destined to fall" (AN, 35). 20 James's capacity for provoking his audiences to reject his work is especially apparent in the plot he constructed for Guy Domville, the play that occasioned the famous opening-night debacle that constitutes the clearest repetition of the "obscure hurt."21 Are we really to believe, as Edel argues, that James actually thought his audience would find it "ugly and displeasing" (L, 111:411) if the play's hero were to marry the girl and inherit a fortune- that he ever dreamed that the average Lon- don playgoer would prefer Domville's rejection of the world for the monastery (7Ύ, 23-24)? James's self-destructive flirtation with the theater has been read as his most deliberate attempt to recapture his dwindling audience and to garner for himself the commercial success and popularity that, he had increasingly to recognize, his narrative fictions could not bring him. But if James was seeking a succès du monde when he flung his pen at the stage, his effort was typically self-defeat- ing, for what was largely implicit in his exchanges with William be- comes palpably obvious here. James knew from the first that success in the theatrical arena depended upon the opinion of an authority- "the vast English Philistine mob- the regular 'theatrical public' of Lon- don, which, of all the vulgar publics London contains, is the most brutally and densely vulgar" (L, 111:515)- which he could not hope or even really want to please. Indeed, in a letter to Robert Louis Stevenson written nearly four years before the Guy Domville fiasco, James shows his awareness of the masochistic prescription for failure implicit in his whole dramatic experiment:</page><page sequence="13">476 David McWhirter I am doing what I can to launch myself in the dramatic direction- and the strange part of the matter is that I am doing it more or less seriously, as if we had the Scène Anglaise which we haven't. And I secretly dream of supplying the vile want? Pas même- and my zeal in the matter is only matched by my indifference. What is serious in it is that ... I find the form opens out before me as if there were a kingdom to conquer- a kingdom forsooth of ignorant brutes of managers and dense cabotins of actors. All the same, I feel as if I had at last found my form- my real one- that for which pale fiction is an ineffectual substitute. God grant this unholy truth may not abide with me more than two or three years- time to dig out eight or ten rounded masterpieces and make withal enough money to enable me to retire in peace and plenty for the unmolested business of a little supreme writing, as distinguished from gouging- which is the Form above mentioned. (L, 111:336-37) This remarkable passage exemplifies the strange conjunction of lucidity and blindness that René Girard has seen as characteristic of masochistic desire.22 Fully aware that his true metier lies elsewhere, and knowing that in his own chosen sphere he is capable of "supreme" achievement, James deliberately embarks on a hopeless quest for a "success" defined by others, by "ignorant brutes" and "dense cabotins," and seeks a "triumph" that he recognizes in advance as unattainable and even unworthy of attainment. like Freud's moral masochist, James seems compelled to "do what is inexpedient," to "act against his own in- terests," and to "ruin the prospects which open out to him in the real world," that is, his prospects as a writer of fiction. And James would in the event defeat himself, for he persistently and predictably refused to make the kinds of artistic compromises required by the very "king- dom" that he set out to "conquer." Moreover, if Edel is correct in observing that the novelist's abandonment of the privacy of his study for the bustling world of the theater was partly motivated by a desire "to come into the open and into the life of practical action- as distinct from the life of imaginative action" (MY, 282)- then the entire episode once again serves to confirm James's impotent and feminized condition. Yet paradoxically, James's humiliation on the opening night of Guy Domville- these had been, he wrote, "the most horrible hours of my life" (Edel, 7Ύ, 84)- was a theatrical success, insofar as it constitutes his most elaborate restaging of his most fundamental drama, the scene of wound- ing that, as James himself recognized in advance, would authorize him "to retire in peace" to the "supreme writing" it definitively marked as his unavoidable fate. Though he told William that "the horrid hour" had left him "bruised" and "sickened" (L, 111:507), it had also brought a</page><page sequence="14">James and the Artist as Masochist 477 "deluge" of "reassurance and admiration"; and if, as he wrote to a friend, "the play [was] wounded, probably to death," he also knew that "fortunately it [was] not a vital member of yours, . . . very exhaus- tedly, preoccupiedly and responsively, Henry James" (L, 111:510-11). In a famous Notebook entry penned just a few weeks after he was hooted off the stage, James assumes his grandest, most masterly authorial manner in order to welcome the deliverance gained through the defeat he so assiduously sought and won: I take up my own old pen again- the pen of all my old unforgettable efforts and sacred struggles. To myself- today- I need say no more. Large and full and high the future still opens. It is now indeed that I may do the work of my life. And I will. (N, 109) 2 Rather than speculate about the sources of James's masochistic psy- chological economy- his complex familial environment, especially his relationships with William and with a father who in certain respects pre- figures his own disempowerment and feminization, as well as the issues surrounding his presumably homosexual orientation23- I have focused here on the links between James's masochism and his positioning of himself as an artist. The scene of wounding played out in the story of James's obscure hurt, like all the scenes that repeat it, is undoubtedly itself only a repetition of an older narrative buried in infantile or uncon- scious psychic material. But instead of attempting to explain why he adopts such a risky self-authorizing strategy- at bottom, I would sug- gest, we must accept it as quite simply, for James, necessary- I would like to return to my earlier suggestion that James, like Kafka, embodies a crucial manifestation of the modernist myth of the wound and the bow and also to use Jamesian masochism as a vehicle for reconsidering that myth in light of some pertinent developments in recent historicist and psychoanalytic criticism. In my study of the novels of James's so-called major phase, I argued that James's renunciatory, self-defeating protagonists and fatalistic plots, as well as his habitual association of the act of writing with pas- sivity and powerlessness, structure his career as a long, destructive "repetition compulsion," Freud's late term for the masochistic "com- pulsion to repeat" painful and unpleasurable experiences that ultimately led him to posit the existence of some mental force "beyond the pleasure principle" (SE, 18:22). I also argued that James ultimately came to understand and transcend this dynamic and that he belatedly achieved a more active, responsible acceptance of his personal and aesthetic</page><page sequence="15">478 David McWhirter choices, as well as a mature, enabling recognition of his characters' and his own ability to love- a view supported primarily through readings of The Wings of the Dove and The Golden Bowl, but also with reference to elements in James's late letters, prefaces, and autobiographical writings, some of them touched on in this essay, that signal his increasingly con- scious awareness of the cost, as well as the profit, inherent in his concep- tion of his art.24 Jamesian repetition, in other words, can finally be seen as an act "of the mind embracing its own pain for some vital purpose,"25 as a process through which James understands and moves beyond the economy of masochism. My intention here is not to abandon this mapping of Jamesian masochism; indeed, I want to suggest why it remains a productive and nonreductive approach to a complex set of issues that remain crucial, not only for James studies, but for our under- standing of modernism as well. But in order to defend my position, I first need to acknowledge its limitations in two key areas. First, my reliance on the late, metapsychological Freud of Beyond the Pleasure Principle involves a consequent deemphasis of certain other less "moral- ized" and potentially more transgressive writings on sexuality- an imbalance to which I shall return. More immediately, however, my argument elides the possibility that its narrative of the late Jamesian drama- a narrative I see as contributing to the dismantlement of the myth of "the Master"- may in fact serve to confirm and conserve that myth. For as I have already suggested here, it is precisely this reau- thorized "Master" who emerges from James's masochistic restagings of the hurt. Nearly thirty years ago, René Girard unmasked the self-debasing pose of the modern artist as one of the central "intellectual myths of our time." Beginning with the example of Valéry's Monsieur Teste, Girard shows how "the writer makes an anti-appeal to the public in the shape of anti-poetry, anti-novel, or anti-play," in order "to prove to the reader that one does not care about him": "the author still publishes his works, but to cover up this crime he does everything he can to avoid being read. For a long time he has claimed to be speaking only to himself; today he claims to be speaking without anything to say." But Girard insists that he is not telling the truth. The writer talks in order to seduce us just as he did in the past. He constantly watches our eyes to see in them the admiration aroused by his talent. It is objected that he does everything to make us loathe him. This may be true, but the reason is that he is no longer able to pay court to us openly. The modern writer thus "courts us negatively," confirming his originality by provoking his audience to reject his work- a form of inverted romantic</page><page sequence="16">James and the Artist as Masochist 479 pride that closely adumbrates James's masochistic relationship with his readers. Like Dostoyevski's Underground Man, the modernist "does everything to make us loathe him," but only in order to prove his unique- ness and superiority to the vulgar mob: "I am alone and they are every- one."26 Girard rightly insists that this form of moral masochism- where the desired punishment is inflicted on the ego rather than the body- actually perpetuates the psychological (oedipal) and moral logic that it purports to overturn. He also remarks that "the writer is mistaken if he thinks that he is [through this strategy] protesting against 'class oppression' and 'capitalist alienation.' "27 Recent historicist attacks on modernism as a profoundly reactionary movement that conceals its conservatism be- neath a facade of radical formal experimentation can thus be seen as a logical politicization of Girard's argument: modernism, for all its ap- parent transgressiveness, recuperates the bourgeois ideology it disdains. One of the most compelling instances of this argument, Frank Len- tricchia's study of the young Wallace Stevens, is especially relevant in the present context, for Lentricchia shows that for Stevens, as for James, "knowing that he was given pleasure by his verse- writing talent . . . meant to feel himself as the potential subverter of his official role as a young American male." "Renunciation of the worldly is the feminine way in Stevens' culture and it is also the way of the poet who (like him- self) defines his writing against the economic." In Lentricchia' s view, Stevens tried "to submerge" his anxieties about this "unmasterable situation" in " 'the gaiety of language' "; but his letters to Elsie reveal his persistent awareness that his writing embodies [an] unavoidable structural contradiction in bour- geois culture: as it brings forth feelings of pleasure ("it elates and satisfies me to do it") while engaging him in the sort of exertion synonymous with work ("a deuce of a job"), it triggers at the very moment of pleasure the negative judgment of his macho superego because this job can bring no economic support, cannot earn the characterization "work"- hence is really no job at all. His "absurd" habit of verse writing necessarily forces upon him a feeling at odds with his maleness- the feeling of the sexual other within.28 Working within a theoretical matrix defined by Jameson and Foucault, Lentricchia argues that Stevens inevitably subordinates his recognition of his own femininity to the task of reappropriating "the mantle of cultural authority . . . and centrality" denied to art by the economic and aes- thetic culture of Stevens's young manhood. The result is an "effort to phallicize poetic discourse" that defines "the canonical modernist issue</page><page sequence="17">480 David McWhirter of poetic authority: the cultural power- or, increasingly, for the poetic modernist- the cultural powerlessness of poetry in a society that mas- culinized the economic while feminizing the literary."29 In Lentricchia's terms, then, the modern male writer's femininity embodies not only the contradictions but also the recuperative hegemonic logic of bourgeois society- a position also taken by Christopher Newfield in his study of "the politics" of male masochism in Hawthorne's Arthur Dimmesdale.30 Habegger's reading of James, too, although resolutely nontheoretical, arrives at a similar conclusion: James's "aborted masculine initiation, however useful" to the novelist, "was finally a type of deformity [which] impaired his writing" by occasioning his abandonment of realism's capacity for critical social observation in favor of "a thorough alienation from society" which "made the novel available for the interests and strategies of modernism."31 In his more recent study of James's life- long antifeminism, Habegger moves even further in this direction, asserting that the novelist's sympathetic identification with his her- oines ultimately serves to authorize his powerful reassertion of the logic of patriarchy.32 Much of the best work- including Habegger's- in recent James studies provides compelling support for this view of "the Master" as a spokes- man (conscious or unconscious) for the patriarchal bourgeois culture his protomodern aestheticism appears to decry.33 Indeed, as I have suggested, it can be argued that James achieves this "reauthorization" precisely through his restagings of his own disempowerment and femi- nization- his paradoxically disabling and reenabling scenes of wounding. I would like to return, however, to Lentricchia's observation that writing "triggers at the very moment of pleasure the negative judgment of [Stevens's] macho superego," for it suggests a crucial difference between Stevens and James- a difference rooted in the latter' s masochism- that problematizes the whole issue of James's "mastery." In Freud's terms, Lentricchia's Stevens responds to his "unmasterable situation" through a "positive" oedipal resolution that reconciles duty and pleasure: that is, Stevens's harshly paternal superego demands an identification with the father, enacted not only in the poet's phallicization of poetic dis- course, but also in the containment of the "sexual other within" staged through his adoption of the "macho" image of the American business- man-the latter a path that James conspicuously declined to follow.34 Stevens's positioning of himself as artist and male subject does not depend, as James's does, on the authority of brothers, readers, and the "great paternal power of Destiny," but on the internalized moral authority of the superego. Freud distinguishes between a certain type of excessively sensitive "ultra-morality"- what he calls "an unconscious extension of morality"</page><page sequence="18">James and the Artist as Masochist 481 -and moral masochism on the grounds that "in the former, the accent falls on the heightened sadism of the super-ego to which the ego sub- mits; in the latter, its falls on the ego's own masochism which seeks punishment . . . from the parental powers outside." Observing that the superego's sadism "becomes for the most part glaringly conscious," while "the masochistic trend of the ego remains as a rule concealed from the subject," Freud is led to a radical conclusion about the moral masochist' s "unconscious sense of guilt": We now know that the wish, which so frequently appears in phan- tasies, to be beaten by the father stands very close to the other wish, to have a passive (feminine) sexual relation to him and is only a regressive distortion of it. If we insert this explanation into the content of moral masochism, its hidden meaning becomes clear to us. Conscience and morality have arisen through the overcoming, the desexualization, of the Oedipus complex; but through moral masochism morality becomes sexualized once more, the Oedipus complex is revived and the way is opened for a regression from morality to the Oedipus complex. In Freud's view, of course, "this is to the advantage neither of morality nor of the person concerned" (SE, 19:169). But this vision of a radically resexualized ego- especially when taken in conjunction with Freud's assertion, in "A Child Is Being Beaten," that "the nucleus of the un- conscious" forces unleashed by masochistic desire "is in each human being that side of him which belongs to the opposite sex" (SE, 17:201) -outlines a deeply transgressive model of identity, especially with regard to gender, and an understanding of masochism that is far removed from the recuperative "compulsion to repeat" delineated in Beyond the Pleasure Principle. "What belongs to the opposite sex is identical with the repressed" (SE, 17:202); and if the judgment of the superego repres- ses pleasure and enforces duty, the masochistic scene of wounding may be said to enforce pleasure- especially, for a writer, the pleasure of the text. Defined through the agency of the sadistic, paternal superego, identity becomes synonymous with "the destructive instinct, the instinct for mastery, or the will to power" (SE, 19:163); but the masochistic ego, by moving back to an original, unfixed, perhaps even preoedipal sexu- ality, finds authorization for an alternative, potentially liberating model of (male) identity. In this view- what Kaja Silverman describes as a " 'Utopian' rereading! ] of masochism"35- James's restagings of the hurt could be seen as a strategy that undoes the oedipal bonds, not in order to retie them, but in order to shatter them altogether. In Masochism: An Interpretation of Coldness and Cruelty, Gilles Deleuze</page><page sequence="19">482 David McWhirter pushes this antioedipal reading of masochism to its logical extreme by arguing that Freud's view of the underlying content of masochistic fantasies-"/ am being beaten [loved] by my father" (SE, 17:198)- is mis- taken. If the male masochist identifies with the (feminized) position of the mother in the scene of punishment, he does so, in Deleuze's read- ing, in order to "atone[ ] for ... his resemblance to the father and the father's likeness in him: the formula of masochism is the humiliated father." The masochist "generates a law" that "is not reborn in the father's image," a "symbolic order in which the father has been abolished for all time. . . . what is beaten, humiliated and ridiculed in him is the image and likeness of the father, and the possibility of the father's aggressive return. . . . The masochist thus liberates himself in prepara- tion for a rebirth in which the father will have no part."36 Deleuze's radical construction of masochism, which overlaps sugges- tively with recent valorizations of preoedipal sexuality in the work of Julia Kristeva and feminist object relations theorists,37 should also be read alongside Leo Bersani's elegant brief for "an esthetics of masochism," exemplified by, among others, Henry James. In Bersani's view, "maso- chism serves life" by virtue of its status as "the psychical strategy which partially defeats a biologically dysfunctional process of maturation," namely, the production of "the structured self" through the oedipal drama. "The Oedipal triangle immobilizes representations," inhibiting the "fantasmatic mobility" and "sexual indeterminacy" enjoyed in the preoedipal phase. Masochism- which for Bersani is in some sense equivalent to sexuality itself- produces a liberatory "shattering" of the oedipally structured self, undoing the culturally dominant, "paranoid" narrative in which "heterosexual genitality is the hierarchical stabiliza- tion of sexuality's component instincts," while "the perversions of adults . . . become intelligible as the sickness of uncompleted narratives."38 Bersani's recognition of "the traces of a prelinguistic shattering of the human subject" in the texts of writers like James and Mallarmé- "the most highly refined, most deliberately shaped forms of civilized dis- course"39- provides an important if not unproblematical antidote to the overdetermined modern artist constructed by such theorists as Jameson and Eagleton.40 The Henry James imprisoned by the bourgeois ideology that his texts inevitably confirm, like the provably misogynist author of James's novels, cannot efface our recognition of the writer in the text, a writer whose openness to "the sexual other within" and to the trans- gressive deconstruction of the stabilizing boundaries between self and other, fact and imagination, masculinity and feminity, is so strongly marked in the felt experience offered by those texts. But Bersani's cele- bration of the "uncompleted narratives" released in and through maso- chistic desire also poses a challenge to my own reading of James's belated</page><page sequence="20">James and the Artist as Masochist 483 "resumption of authority"41 and consequent drive toward completion, in his last fictions but also in his career as a whole. To see James as com- ing to terms with and moving beyond the self-made myths by which he lived and wrote for so many years is to risk re-mastering him by resolving those indeterminacies in the closure of the late Freudian "master-plot,"42 by "immobilizing," as Bersani would say, "the immensely productive play of representations" released through the masochistic shattering of the oedipally structured self.43 The reauthorized James who erected the monumental edifice of the New York Edition never ceased, after all, to define himself- even within the pages of that monument- as the embroiderer, the nurse, the mother of fictions. I would argue that the Jamesian text is marked by potentially liberating traces of the preoedipal, as well as by its creator's openness to "the sexual other within."44 But I cannot recognize, in James, a landscape where the father and his law are abolished, or an artist who "through the [masochistic] contract . . . reaches towards the most mythical and timeless realms, where [the mother alone] dwells."45 "Poetry," Virginia Woolf once remarked, "ought to have a mother as well as a father."46 But if masochism retrieves the transgressive potential of the mother tongue, it does so only in fantasies that evade the reality principle figured by father time. As Paul Ricoeur writes in his study of Freud, there is "an element of 'evil infinitude' in desire," a resistance to "the reconversion to the finite" that alone permits the enactment and realization of love.47 Clearly, Bersani would reject Ricoeur's characterization of desire's infinitude as "evil"; but something akin to Ricoeur's recognition is at work in a resonant passage where Bersani envisions a different if still "utopian" goal for his "esthetics of masochism," the possibility of a reworking of psychoanalytic theory in which the paternal figure would no longer play the role of the inhibiting law, but would rather provide the opportunity for a socializing of the traumatic loving initially experienced at the mother's breast. The father would then function as a duplicating generalization of that love, and not as its repudiation. This "de-Oedipalizing of the father"48- and the more liberating Freud it imagines- is what Ricoeur has in mind when he calls for a "likeness of the father in accordance with which the giving up of desire is no longer death but love."49 And it is this reimagined father who returns in Strether's reassertion of his paternity at the end of The Ambassadors, in Maggie Verver's responsible acceptance of the power and freedom that allow her to re-create her marriage, and in James's own authorial affirmation of enacted love in The Golden Bowl. If James's masochistic</page><page sequence="21">484 David McWhirter initiations effect a deliverance into desire that is ultimately realized and contained in love, that love need not be seen as a "will to power" that immobilizes desire, or as a closing off of desire's productive represen- tational play. 3 Like the many other high modernist writers who continue to fascinate even as they sometimes repel us, James worked against as well as within the ideology that structured his society and culture. In her suggestive study of "Masochism and Male Subjectivity," as well as in her related essay on James, Silverman charts a helpful middle course between tra- ditional and "utopian" theories of masochism, one that acknowledges the dangers as well as the liberatory potential of this "other" mascu- linity. The male masochist, she argues, by staging his own feminization, "acts out in an exaggerated, anthropomorphic and hence disruptive way the process whereby subjects are spoken"; and by magnifying "the losses and divisions upon which cultural identity is based, refusing to be sutured or recompensed," he "radiates a negativity inimical to the social order." Silverman recognizes that "masochism in all of its guises is as much a product of the existing symbolic order as a reaction against it," but also sees it as a transgressive process that makes possible the articulation of "new forms of male subjectivity." Indeed, "at certain moments," she suggests, "[masochistic] perversion may pose such a radical challenge to sexual difference as to enact precisely the scenario condemned by Bacon: one where women govern men, and slaves freemen."50 Silverman reads James's masochism as an experiment in "phallic divestiture" that constitutes an "authorial subjectivity . . . radically subversive of his assigned sexual position." But she ultimately believes that James's "aspir[ation] to knowledge only under the sign of maso- chism ... is more generative of trauma than of power."51 I would like to suggest, however, that the essence of James's "mastery" lies in his responsible acceptance of the terms of the "contract" he had made. James's struggle for self-knowledge- marked above all by his under- standing of how essentially unknowable the self remains- is manifested, as we have seen, even amid his most obscure ambiguities, even, and perhaps most movingly, in his painful but finally productive awareness of the symbiotic relationship between his wound and his bow. The most radically decentered subject, as Bersani admits, can speak only through the sublimated, containing forms of art. And it is James's hard- won capacity for the "ironic self-reflections" that produce those forms52 that marks his difference from that other exemplary modern</page><page sequence="22">James and the Artist as Masochist 485 American masochist, Ernest Hemingway. Edel has noted the "obscure" echo of James in The Sun Also Rises, where Hemingway's castrated pro- tagonist acknowledges "Henry" as his predecessor in the antilineage of modernist impotency and alienation.53 But "Papa" Hemingway refused the knowledge of his own sexual ambiguity and repeated his hurt until it killed his art and, finally, as Freud would say, "his own real existence." James, in contrast, attained his mastery by learning the ambivalent lessons embodied in the double scene of failed and liberatory initiation he so frequently restaged. To read James's mastery only as a recuperation of his culture's domi- nant ideology, or, alternatively, as the pathetic, compensatory fiction of a "boy who could not become a man," is to miss the potentially sub- versive power of James's authorial stance; it is, in effect, a way of rein- forcing the hegemony of the oedipally structured identity challenged in his texts. When he wrote his preface for The Tragic Muse, James was compelled to recognize that Nick Dormer was "not quite so interesting as he was fondly intended to be" (AN, 96), a discrepancy he attributes to the fact that "the case of the sacrifice for art can [never] be, with truth, with taste, with discretion involved, apparently and showily 'big.'" Indeed, "the most charming truth about the preference for art is that to parade abroad so thoroughly inward and so naturally embarrassed a matter is to falsify and vulgarise it" (AN, 82-83). James's subtly but surely gendered language here registers his acceptance of the truth Nick resists- the truth of the writer's sexually "embarrassed" and ambiguous position. To represent the artist as "showily 'big' " or strutting his stuff is to "falsify" that subversive embarrassment, to mistake the pen (and the penis) for a phallus. If "the better part of [Nick] is locked away from us, and the part we see has to pass for- well, what it passes for, so lamentedly, among his friends and relatives"- that is because any presentation of the artist in triumph must be flat in proportion as it really sticks to its subject. . . . For, to put the matter in an image, all we then- in his triumph- see of the charm-compeller is the back he turns to us as he bends over his work. "His" triumph, decently, is but the triumph of what he produces, and that is another affair. His romance is the romance he himself projects; he eats the cake of the very rarest privilege . . . therefore he mustn't "have" it, in the form of the privilege of the hero, at the same time. The privilege of the hero . . . places him in quite a different category, belongs to him only as to the artist deluded, diverted, frustrated or vanquished; when the "amateur" in him gains, for our admira- tion or compassion or whatever, all that the expert has to do with- out. (AN, 96-97)</page><page sequence="23">486 David McWhirter James's staging of the modern writer as anti-hero is undoubtedly a dangerous and costly strategy of self-authorization; but it is also a way of refusing to be "deluded" or "vanquished" by a culture obsessed with and governed by the "showily 'big.' " The "embarrassed" Jamesian artist thus outlines, however tentatively, the contours of a different kind of manhood. And the maimed ghost confronted by Spencer Brydon, the expatriate writer-protagonist of The Jolly Corner, is neither an image of the castrated man he has become through his abdication of culturally authorized masculinity, nor a representation of the successfully initiated, aggressive man "his father, or his culture, meant him to be."54 Rather, James's exorcised ghost, with its two missing fingers "reduced to stumps,"55 is the disabled writer he might have become under the sign of American patriarchy.

James's reference to the Medusa is suggestive in light of Freud's brief paper of 1922, "Medusa's Head." Freud sees "the hair upon Medusa's head"- "fre- quently represented in works of art in the form of snakes"- as well as the motif of "decapitation" as derivations of "the castration complex," but also points to the recuperative psychic economy of the myth: "the sight of the Medusa's head makes the spectator stiff with terror, turns him to stone. Observe that we have here once again the same origin from the castration complex and [a] transforma- tion of affect! For becoming stiff means an erection. Thus in the original situation it offers consolation to the spectator: he is still in possession of a penis, and the stiffening reassures him of the fact" (SE, 18:273-74). 10.

In an argument closely related to my own, Eakin considers "the possibility that the link between illness and creativity may have had for James early and late the force of cultural sanction," and shows how "sickness, solitude, and confinement . . . seem to operate as enabling conditions" for James's artistic process. Where Eakin sees "the force of cultural sanction" at work, I read James's masochistic self-authorizing strategy as, at least in part, a form of cultural subversion. In discussing "the myth of the sick artist," Eakin cites Lionel Trilling's "Art and Neurosis" as well as Wilson's essay; he also draws suggestive parallels to Jean Strouse's work on Alice James and to Howard M. Feinstein' s work on William James.

Eakin links both the "obscure hurt" and the Guy Domville disaster to James's famous dream set in the Galerie d'Apollon of the Louvre- "the most appalling yet most admirable nightmare" of his life. The dream stages a characteristically passive-aggressive scene: James takes possession of the glorious palace of art in a "sudden pursuit, through an open door," of an unspecified aggressor who had previously forced his retreat behind that door (A, 196-97; Eakin, 76-86). Michael Anesko notes striking cor- respondences between James's opening-night humiliation, a similar experience of the "glare of publicity" at a moot-court exhibition in his Harvard Law School days, and the eerily predictive end of The Bostonians, where Olive Chancellor takes the stage of the Boston Music Hall to face her own howling mob (see Anesko, "Friction with the Market," 18-19, 100). 22.

Freud discusses the relationship between male homosexuality and maso- chism in "A Child Is Being Beaten," where he argues that the basic content of masochistic fantasies-"/ am being beaten by my father" -contains a still deeper level of unconscious desire: "I am loved by my father." In boys, "the unconscious masochistic phantasy . . . starts from the inverted [oedipal] attitude, in which the father is taken as the object of love" (SE, 17:197-99).

Anesko's detailed examination of James's determination to master the professional and business aspects of authorship suggests, however, that James may have been pursuing a more subtle version of Stevens's strategy by attempt- ing to invest his writing with something of the status of real "man's work." James's professionalism may also be seen as a reaction to his embarrassment, as a boy, at his father's lack of a professional identity (see Anesko, "Friction with the Market," passim). Poetry and fiction are, of course, different cultural com- modities-a fact that may help to explain Stevens's and James's differing re- sponses to the contradictory position of the male writer. As Rachel Bowlby suggests, that position becomes especially complex in the case of the male novelist in modern consumer culture: "If culture, as a space marked off from business or working concerns, was also associated with femininity, that meant that being an artist might not sit well with a male identity. In the case of novels . . . women were the main consumers, the main readers. The male novelist, then, might be in something of an ideological bind: neither pure artist nor fully masculine, and unable to alter one side of the pairing without damaging the other. Practicality in relation to the market meant catering to feeble feminine taste, while ignoring it meant withdrawing altogether from the normal condi- tions of masculine achievement." Bowlby argues that in the case of poetry, in contrast, "questions of the market were relatively insignificant. Poetry, as a result, could be identified as a place kept pure, the locus of 'art for art's sake,' uncontaminated by the profit motive or by the vulgar requirements of the popu- lar market" (Just Looking: Consumer Culture in Dreiser, Gissing, and Zola [New York: Methuen, 1985], 9-11).</page><page sequence="27">490 David McWhirter 35.

Drawing on Lacan's distinction between the Imaginary and the Symbolic Order, Kristeva posits within language an interplay of "semiotic" (preoedipal) and symbolic (oedipally structured) processes; once the subject has passed through the oedipal phase, the "semiotic" is largely repressed, reappearing only in a variety of disruptive elements within the domi- nant "symbolic" structuring of language. Chodorow and Gilligan stress the importance of the preoedipal phase in shaping women's- as opposed to men's- identities, a discrepancy resulting from the cultural logic through which "mother- ing" is reproduced in Western society. 38.

See, for example, Jameson's argument that the "Jamesian aesthetic ... is part and parcel of a whole ideology" and "may be grasped as part of the more general containment strategy of a late nineteenth-century bourgeoise suffering from the aftereffects of reification. . . . Jamesian point of view, which comes into being as a protest and a defense against reification, ends up furnishing a powerful ideological instrument in the perpetuation of an increasingly subjec- tivized and psychologized world" (Frederic Jameson, The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act [Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1981], 221- 22). Eagleton goes even further: "The contradictions of James's spiritual aristo- crats, parasitic on a bourgeois material base which must be ceaselessly sup- pressed, are overdetermined by the contradictory form of James's own mode of insertion into bourgeois society [i.e., his family/economic historyl" (Terry Eagleton, Criticism and Ideology: A Study in Marxist Literary Theory [London: Verso, 1978], 143). 41.
