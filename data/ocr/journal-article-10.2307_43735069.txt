Correlations coefficients ranged from 0.35 to 0.85. Only 3 were better than the correlation with the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide. That suggests that the fluctuations of model values do not mirror "natural variation", a conclusion reinforced by the lack of association between one year's estimate and that for the previous year from observation, with that from models. Regression slopes of observation on model ranged from 0.26 to 1.16; that does not constitute strong support for the "green-house gas" explanation of global warming. Model outputs can be modified to predict global temperatures but then the model output is logically no different from the empirical relationship with atmospheric carbon dioxide, which is as good as the best of the models and is transparent. Keywords: Global temperature, climate models. INTRODUCTION Models fall into two broad categories; those that attempt to reproduce a complex structure albeit in a simplified form, and those that merely aim to estimate the value of a variable. Climate models are in the former category. Those models may provide insights into the way the climate system works without necessarily giving reliable estimates of the output variables (5), despite the assertion in 3 to the contrary. A purely empirical relationship may well be useful despite failing to reflect the complexity of the system. Interest rates are employed to control inflation although the mechanism is a matter of debate. Different climate models simulate successfully different facets of climate (1); some of these relationships have been investigated in detail (6). However, the overriding practical concern is with climate change, more specifically how warm the world is likely to become with different increases in levels of "greenhouse gases" in the atmosphere, assuming that greenhouse gases produced by man have been and will continue to be, the overriding reason for the world getting warmer. The relevant</page><page sequence="2">1060 Energy &amp; Environment • Vol. 22, No. 8, 2011 variable is the global mean annual near surface temperature. An increase in temperature will itself have important consequences and will cause other changes but what those will be is not certain. Comparison against time (3), suggests that time - year in this case - is a variable. It is not; 2010 can never be anything else. In consequence time-series analysis is unsatisfactory; it has indeed been likened to fortune telling. Further, change against time conflates change of an input with the consequences of change - the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide for example with the effect of the increase on annual temperature estimated by a model. "If the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide rises by say 10%, above its current level, what will be the effect on annual temperature?" is one question. "When will that be likely to occur?" is a separate question tackled through a different investigation. The projections of models have been investigated in many papers (eg 2). Attempts have been made to produce a "metric" for the performance of a model as a whole (1) but none for estimates of annual temperature on its own. The mean and range of the estimates from many models over time is presented graphically in 3 together with estimates of the same variable from observations. But graphical presentation does not constitute an adequate analysis. What is required is a statistical comparison of the estimate of annual temperature from observations with estimates from models; that is what this note attempts. In addition to the comparison of annual temperature, this note attempts to decide whether the models estimate "natural variation", that is variation that discounts the consequences of man's activities. Finally, the question of estimates of future global temperature is considered. MATERIALS AND METHODS The analysis covers the years from 1959 to 1999; 1959 because the measurement of levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas, started then at Mauna Loa, 1999 because that is the last year of all the model estimates of global mean annual temperature in the Climate of the 20th Century Experiment. The model outputs are available from the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) ) and the WCRP's Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM)1. The same data is to be found in more easily accessed form at Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut (KNMI) "Climate Explorer"2. The estimate from observations - CRUHad - is that produced by the Climate Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia in collaboration with the Hadley Centre of the UK Meteorological Office3. The record of annual concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)4. The output of 23 models has been analysed; there are several ensembles for most, making 70 estimates in all. The identification of model and ensemble is that given by PCMDI. 1 www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ climexpknmini 3 cruueaacuk/cru/data 4 www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends</page><page sequence="3">Temperature estimates from models and observations 1061 THE GLOBAL MEAN ANNUAL TEMPERATURE ESTIMATED BY MODELS AND FROM OBSERVATIONS "Greenhouse gas" model estimates may be used both to support the contention that man's activities, mainly through his production of greenhouse gases, is the cause of global warming, and to predict what further warming might be expected. The test is the degree to which the model estimates of global mean annual temperature have agreed with those from observations. That will be indicated by correlation and by regression. The correlation between the annual temperature from a model and from observation is positive for every model; it would be remarkable if none was since any variable that has increased over time - the Retail Price Index for example - would be positively correlated with annual temperature. The correlation coefficients (C C) range from 0.35 (Echam ens 3) to 0.85 (MIR ens 3). Coefficients above 0.6 are significant at the 0.05 probability level. The coefficients of 5 outputs are below 0.5, which is the 0.1 probability level for the existence of a correlation. However, the existence of a significant correlation depends on the sample size as much as on the closeness of the C C to unity. The slopes of the regression of the annual temperature from observation on that from models range from 0.26 to 1.16; the "expected" slope is of course unity. A 1 deg C increase in the observation estimate is as low as 0.86 and as high as 3.86 deg C in the models. The mean of the 70 slopes is 0.703 with a standard deviation (S D) of 0.225. The S D of the mean is 0.033 so there is no doubt at all that the mean slope of 70 outputs is different from unity. The calculation of the S D of the mean assumes that the individual model values are independent estimates. That is not quite true. The ensembles of a given model are, unsurprisingly, similar. Thus the C Cs of 9 ensembles of GISS-ER lie between 0.85 and 1.16. An example of an output that has a slope approaching unity and a relatively small variation about regression and one that has neither, is illustrated in Fig 1. Model output means differ from each other and from observation in their estimate of actual temperature by amounts greater than the rise in observed annual temperature during the last half-century. The mean for the period 1959 to 1999 from observation is 14.03 deg C. Model estimates range from 12.41 to 15.39 deg C. The use of anomalies discounts those differences.</page><page sequence="4">1062 Energy &amp; Environment • Vol. 22, No. 8, 2011 Figure 1.

A model run without forcing is assumed to be a measure of natural variation (7) although no support is given for that assumption. With the estimate from observations, the two are not easily separated. However, both the model and observations purport to measure the combined effect. Hence if a model does measure natural variation its year-to-year fluctuations should follow the fluctuations of the estimate from observations. The correlation coefficient measures closeness of association but is not easy to interpret. However, if a model's fluctuations do parallel those of observation, the correlation should be better than that between observation and the level of carbon dioxide that increased steadily year on year. In fact that is so for few models; the carbon dioxide correlation of 0.81 is bettered by only 3 of the 70 model estimates. For 67 models the output would follow the observation fluctuations more closely if no attempt at all were made to simulate "natural variation". 12 -, Out of phase in phase &lt; - ► 10- 8 - 6 - &gt;% o c V 4 A Z&gt; 4 A - Ū" £ LL 2 - iiiilllllllli'liHii 0 8 16 24 32 40 Frequency 95% probablity class M ► Figure 2.

A further test can be made by comparing the difference in the temperature estimate between one year and the next from a model with that from observation. If the model</page><page sequence="6">1064 Energy &amp; Environment • Vol. 22, No. 8, 2011 followed observation exactly, when the former shows an increase between a given year and the next, so would the latter, and of course similarly for a decrease. It is not reasonable to expect total agreement since when the observation change between one year and the next is small, a small difference in the model output might change coincidence into its opposite. Never the less, the sign of the year on year differences of observation and of model, should be the same more often than not. With no association the frequency of coincidence would follow the binomial distribution and that proves to be the case almost exactly (Fig 2); the 95% confidence limit calculated from the actual distribution is no different from that assuming equal likelihood of coincidence and its lack. Some models are indeed in phase relatively frequently but that cannot be regarded as other than chance without an explanation arising from an examination of the structure of those particular models. There is thus no evidence that the models do measure "natural variation" and every likelihood that they do not. "FORECASTS" OF ANNUAL TEMPERATURE This note aims to answer the question, "How much warmer is the world likely to become?" not "When will that be likely to occur?" The former is more accurately termed an extrapolation than a forecast since date is not involved. The extrapolation applies only to the estimate from observations; whether or not that estimate is an accurate measure of the global mean annual temperature lies outside the scope of this note. The problem is best approached by considering the regression of annual global temperature from observations on the annual level of atmospheric carbon dioxide, both expressed as anomalies. Multiplying by the slope converts carbon dioxide in parts per million (ppm) into deg C. This is simply a matter of scaling (Fig 3a). The slope is now unity +- 0.23 at the 95% probability level. "Forecast" temperatures for carbon dioxide levels of 380, 400 and 420ppm are 0.38 (0.29-0.46), 0.56 (0.42-0.69) and 0.74 (0.57-0.91) deg C above the CRUHad anomaly base. A 2 deg C rise in temperature would be likely to require a level of carbon dioxide of some 560ppm, but the rise might occur with as little as 430ppm or need as much as 690ppm. The model estimates need to be modified in order to be used similarly. Expressing the model outputs as anomalies requires adding to or subtracting from the model values, the difference between the model mean and the observation mean for the study period. Making the regression slope unity requires multiplication of the model value by the slope. Both those procedures are deliberately designed to make model fit observation. But then the model estimates of temperature (Fig 3b) are logically no different from that using the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide (Fig 3a). That the models are a complex set of algorithms intended to simulate reality is irrelevant. By forcing the output to fit the data, the relationship becomes empirical. Modification is required whether or not the difference between the means of model and observation is statistically significant. Firstly, even if the difference is not "significant" allowing for it is more likely than not to represent the true situation. Secondly, imprecise data are more likely to indicate that a difference is not significant. For example, MIRcgcm.3.2 ens 1 has a slope of 0.75 with a S D of 0.15, which is not</page><page sequence="7">Temperature estimates from models and observations 1065 Figure 3.

Also shown are the 95% confidence limits of the slopes. significantly different from unity at the 5% probability level, but CCSM3 ens 0 with a greater slope (0.76) would be judged to be significantly different because of its smaller S D (0.1). None the less a forecast based on CCSMN ens 0 would be the more reliable. The model output having the best correlation with observations (MIR ens 3) has a transformed variation about unity of +- 0.20 at the 95% level (Fig 3b). The same predicted temperatures as those calculated with levels of carbon dioxide of 380, 400 and 420ppm, occur with model output anomalies of 0.53, 0.79 and 1.05 deg C. The transformed 95% confidence limits are however somewhat better than those with carbon dioxide; 0.30-0.45, 0.45-0.67 and 0.59-0.89. Both model and carbon dioxide results are much influenced by the estimated temperature for 1998, the warmest year on record (Fig 3). Estimates of carbon dioxide levels are available for 2010 and the preceding years. Reworking to include the later figures gives estimates of temperature anomalies for carbon dioxide levels of 400 and 420ppm, of 0.52 (0.45-0.60) and 0.69 (0.59-0.79) deg C. The temperatures are a little lower than those calculated from the period ending in 1999. The longer period also produces a reduction in the 95% confidence limits to +- 0.16.</page><page sequence="8">1066 Energy &amp; Environment • Vol. 22, No. 8, 2011 DISCUSSION. Estimates can be made for a specific future annual temperature but the confidence limits are wide and increase rapidly with extrapolation. Thus if the carbon dioxide level were to reach 380ppm, the predicted 95% temperature anomaly limits are 0.13 and 0.75 deg C. The 380ppm carbon dioxide level was in fact reached in 2005, when the temperature anomaly from observations was 0.48 deg C, well within the confidence range. Since extrapolations of even the best models are only a little more reliable than extrapolation based on the level of carbon dioxide, it would sensible to use the latter. The aim of policy is to curb carbon dioxide emissions so a transparent and simple relationship is preferable to one that is complex and obscure. However, the critical question is whether greenhouse gases produced by man have caused the world to get warmer. But the hypothesis that they have, refers to a unique event occurring in historical time and hence does not fulfill the crucial scientific criterion of falsifiability (4). Furthermore, a probability of being true cannot be attached to the hypothesis since probability is defined as a frequency. To say that there is a 90% probability of man's actions having caused the world to get warmer would mean that, were the events of the last century or so to be repeated, once in 10 times the world would not warm. But essentially either man has caused the world to get warmer or he has not. It follows that whether or not the outputs of the "greenhouse gas" models support the hypothesis can be based on no more than disinterested evaluation. The relevant parameters examined in this note are the difference between the model estimate of mean annual temperature and that from observation for: (i) the difference averaged over the study period ie the correction in deg C to allow the model output to be expressed as an anomaly; (ii) the difference from unity of the slope of the regression; (iii) the variance about regression, and the correlation between output and observation - those are essentially the same since the former can be derived directly from the latter. Overall these combine to demonstrate the agreement or otherwise of the outputs from different models. There is no certain way to determine what values of those parameters would cast doubt on the hypothesis and what support it. But of the 70 outputs examined, for 24 the mean model temperature over the study period differs from that from observations by more than 1 deg C; that difference equals or exceeds the estimated rise in temperature over the same period, as indicated by the means for the decade starting in 1959 and the one ending in 2010. That result hardly constitutes strong support for the hypothesis. The regression slope measures the extent to which a model estimate of temperature change differs from that of observation, after discounting any difference between the mean values. One might reasonably expect a model estimate to be within 0.1 of unity but only 4 models pass that test; a further 4 come between 0.8 and 1.2 but the estimates of 25 are less than 0.5. A slope of 0.5 means that when the model estimates a temperature rise of 2 deg C, observation indicates a rise of only one. For extrapolation the difference of the regression slope from unity is unimportant; what matters is the reliability of the regression shown by the S D of the slope. That is</page><page sequence="9">Temperature estimates from models and observations 1067 not so for evaluating the "greenhouse gas" hypothesis. Unfortunately one cannot use the S D of the slope to test whether the slope differs significantly from unity since as has been pointed out already, the more inaccurate the model and the larger the S D, the less likely is the difference to be statistically significant. It is none-the-less instructive to consider outputs with similar high C Cs. and hence similarly small slope S Ds. Of the 7 outputs each from a different model with C Cs above 0.8, only 2 have slopes not significantly different from unity. That suggests a C C of less would not support the "greenhouse gas" hypothesis but only 10 out of 70 have greater. Those 3 elements taken together show large differences between the modified and unmodified model estimates of future temperature. Five examples- the 2 extreme cases illustrated in Fig 1, and 3 intermediate- give the following unmodified outputs for a modified estimate of a 1 deg C increase above the 1959-1999 observation mean:- 1.29, 2.40, 2.43, 3.48, 3.70. All but 1 of the 70 model outputs overestimate temperature rise, most be at least 50%. That is worrying in itself, but of equal concern is the existence of the differences. The models are based on the same physical principles (3), use the same input figures and furthermore use recent climate data in model development (5), so the large variation in outcome is puzzling. It may well be that a model whose output is very different from the observation estimate is simply a poor model. However, such models cannot be rejected simply because they do not give the desired answer; a rejection would require an examination of the workings of the model. The proposed criteria are tentative. The failure to meet those criteria does not show the "greenhouse gas" hypothesis to be false; to do so would require the world to cease to get warmer despite a steady increase in the production of greenhouse gases. But that may well have been the case during the most recent decade. The regression of the temperature estimate from observation on the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide has been negative between the end of the last century and 2010; the change in slope from the previous period (1959-1999) is statistically highly significant (p=0.001). The world has got no warmer despite the continued upward trend in the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, a decade is a relatively brief period, and runs of years both cooler and warmer than expected have occurred before. On the other hand, a decade without a rising temperature trend should not be summarily discounted. REFERENCES 1. Glecker P J, Taylor K E and Doutriaux C 2008.
