<plain_text><page sequence="1">WE DIDN'T MIND HIS SAYING SO Homage to Joseph Wood Krutch: Tragedy and the Ecological Imperative WILLIAM HOLTZ Many of our readers will recall that "If You Don't Mind My Saying So" was, from 1955 to 1970, the title of Joseph Wood Krutch's regular column for The American Scholar. When Mr. Krutch died, Hiram Haydn wrote: "Very few of us minded his saying so, and all of us wish that he could have continued doing just that. Skeptical of the benefits of technology, a fierce fighter for conservation and for an intelligent ap- proach to the problems of ecology, Joseph Wood Krutch has been, for many years, a lone but resonant voice, and we are proud to have given, him this platform from which to speak." William Holtz, who teaches at the University of Missouri, describes himself as an English professor with an interest in ecology. He delivered an earlier version of this essay at the 1973 Symposium in Nineteenth-C entury Studies at the University of Missouri- Columbia. The patron saint of ecologists, it has been suggested, ought to be Saint Francis, whose heretical Christian vision assimilated all of creation into a brotherhood with man. The saints of one sect are indeed apt to be here- tics from another, visionaries possessed of a keen sense of the disparity between a perceived order of fact and the internally consistent dogma of their coevals. Cer- tainly our contemporary ecologists draw their inspiration from a similar vision, al- though usually lacking the Christian com- ponent; and they are regarded with the ap- propriate suspicion by those whose dogmas are rooted in the exploitative habit of thought that has produced the various won- ders of our prosperity. This is not neces- sarily to claim sainthood for all of those presently engaged in the assault upon these dogmas and upon our technological cul- ture; we seem now to have reached the stage when heresy becomes respectable despite its polar conflicts with prevailing dogma. But the movement does have its pantheon, early prophets whose exemplary defections gleam from the past as solitary stars. Of equal stature with Saint Francis himself would be Thoreau, whose revision- ist bent was so radical as to be meta-eco- logical and whose ninteenth-century in- fluence was negligible compared to his importance today. Another candidate might be Aldo Leopold, the founder of modern wildlife management, who very early pro- tested the orientation of wildlife science to the uses of commercial enterprise - this in a series of essays that show Thoreau's im- print both in style and in the disciplined development of a minority perspective. Per- haps the most recent I would name is 267</page><page sequence="2">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR Rachel Carson, whose quiet eloquence could mildly disturb but not move the bureaucracy she labored in. This pantheon is by way of establishing the goodly company to which I would nominate a heretic from my own discipline, a scholar and writer whose career from youth to middle age traces a wholly ex- emplary progress for a professor of English. As a convert from an early, unpromising start in mathematics, he went from a pro- vincial university in 1915 to the Columbia University graduate school for a Ph.D. For most of his years he remained in New York City, serving first as a drama critic, then as professor at Columbia; and in a series of literary studies he established himself as one of the luminaries of our discipline. His published doctoral dissertation on Restora- tion drama is still a standard text, as is his study of Edgar Allan Poe; and other works on the drama, the novel and literary aesthe- tics were completed before he was forty. Then came a pair of admirable books on Samuel Johnson and on Henry David Thoreau, and then, curiously, a volume of nature essays. And very shortly after, an early retirement from the academic world, relocation from New York City to the Arizona desert, and an autumnal career, seemingly remote from his academic one, as a' philosophical naturalist, recording his thoughts about frogs, bats, mice and as- sorted creatures beneath his microscope. The early conversion from mathematics to literature we in the discipline of course ap- plaud. The later defection to the natural sciences we may find suspect in the ex- treme. More Lives Than One, Joseph Wood Krutch entitled his autobiography, taking his title from Thoreau. It is Krutch's prog- ress through these lives that I would as- sess here, with more than a little of the hagiographer's interest in conversion and prophecy, and this despite his ostensible desertion of my own discipline, which often defines itself in terms of a contrast between the cultures of science and the humanities. For this desertion is part of a larger prog- ress from faith to despair to faith renewed; and to the extent that this progress is grounded in literary study and ends in a vision that unifies the two cultures, his career not only justifies our study of litera- ture but calls into question our sometimes facile disdain of science. Within the frame- work of this greater progress, I would trace the continuity of Krutch's engagement with the problem of man's place in the natural order, an engagement more apparent in his later career than in his early literary con- cerns. Very early, however, we can discern the accent of prophecy and the germ of his final affirmation. I Where to find the source of Krutch's curious conversion? Perhaps in his youth- ful and lifelong fascination with the micro- scope; or perhaps in the fact that one of the earliest magazines he read as a youth was Scientific American. Absolutely pre- monitory, however, was his experience as reporter for the Nation at the celebrated Scopes Monkey Trial. From New York City, Krutch returned to his home state of Tennessee, and his liberal and rather polemical reportage from out of the dark- ness of his native province won him the editorial attention of his hometown news- paper, which nominated him as the prod- igal son least wanted to return. His writing was of a piece with his other work of that time - of a piece, even, with his doctoral dissertation, which, he says, was on the Restoration drama because it was witty and indecent - and of a piece with the whole of what passed for liberal, informed opin- ion in the centers of thought and culture just after World War I. The crusade Krutch identified himself with, he says, was one against "Puritanism, Provincialism, and the Genteel Tradition," and he and his contemporaries were secure in their faith that a brave new world was at hand, just beyond the "traditions, prohibitions, and inhibitions of a happily moribund past." Even in those years, however, a change was working in Krutch. By 1929, when he was thirty-five, the optimism of the decade was in its waning days, and in the interven- ing years since the Scopes trial he had begun to question the facile liberalism of 268</page><page sequence="3">HOMAGE TO JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH his and the nation's twenties. He came to see, quite simply, that the modern icono- clasm to which he was committed had de- stroyed the system of values implicit in the body of literary and humanistic documents to which he was also committed. The Mod- ern Temper (1929) was the sad and sudden flowering of this perception. Krutch's prime achievement in The Modern Temper was to demonstrate with persuasive force the loss of sustaining values that had been the price of modern knowledge: the loss of religious faith and of an earth-centered cosmology; the dimin- ished stature of man in the natural order; and the diminished range of his freedom in the face of deterministic forces - all familiar laments now. But Krutch's second and complementary achievement carried the true note of prophecy, as he defined an attitude toward knowledge and value that was existentialist in everything but name. The book was widely read and Krutch be- came identified rather more with the over- tone of despair than with the affirmation of a self-conscious humanism. A passage from a chapter entitled "The Tragic Fal- lacy" captures a sense of the whole and will lead us on to Krutch's later concerns: he describes how the vanished faiths en- tailed a secondary loss in our literary heri- tage - the loss of tragedy, since Shake- speare, except in a debased and attenuated vestige. For in order for high tragedy to flourish, he argues, man must conceive of himself and the universe in a significant reciprocal relationship. In this view, man lives in a world which he may not dominate but which is always aware of him. Occupying the exact center of a universe which would have no meaning except for him, and being so little below the angels that, if he be- lieves in God, he has no hesitation in imagining Him formed as he is formed and crowned with a crown like that which he or one of his fellows wears, he assumes that each of his acts rever- berates through the universe. His passions are important to him because he believes them im- portant throughout all time and all space; the very fact that he can sin (no modern can) means that this universe is watching his acts; and though he may perish, a God leans out from infinity to strike him down. What we can now recognize in Krutch's description of this world in which high tragedy occurs is a concept that another scholar would shortly articulate at length and with great subtlety. In 1933, A. Ó. Lovejoy, the renowned historian of ideä$&gt; presented his lectures entitled The Great Chain of Being, and the book of that title that followed soon established itself as the definitive analysis of a world hypothesis persisting from Plato to modern times. What Lovejoy described was a conception of the universe as a completely full hier- archy of all possible modes of existence ranging from Infinite Goodness (or Per- fection, or God) down to inert matter. Within this chain of being, each link par- took of existence ultimately and only by virtue of communion with divinity, as a kind of universal sympathy suffused itself throughout all creation - through the or- ders of angels down to man and through the natural world down to elemental rock. And although the hierarchy was absolute, constrained by the abstract notion of grades of perfection, yet within the hierarchy was an equally constraining egalitarianism, as each link in the chain was equally essential to the integrity of the whole. As Lovejoy demonstrated, this was an ex- tremely protean concept, balanced on the paradox of ultimate power constrained by absolute necessity, and susceptible of anti- thetical inferences. But nothing is clearer than its force as a conservative and stabiliz- ing model for thought right up until the nineteenth century; and when it is brought into conjunction with Krutch's remarks on tragedy, the habit of thought that Krùtch terms the "tragic fallacy" can be seen as nothing less than an ethical imperative implicit in a conservative and perhaps mythic interpretation of the model. Truly, if all creation is linked in a perfect ordter, any individual disruption of this order will reverberate throughout the universe; and for man to conceive of himself as embraced in a divine system is at once to perceive a scale by which to measure his own nature and a cosmic order that justifies his chas- tisement when through error or pride he aspires beyond his place, however uniquely 269</page><page sequence="4">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR privileged he is within it. Hamlet, groping through a world befouled with crime, thinks instinctively in these terms: This goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firma- ment, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why it appears no other thing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form, in mov- ing, how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me. And the storm that rages in King Lear is not only a figure of Lear's disordered in- tellect but also a measure of his stature, the immensity of his passion, as a universe, disordered by his willful crime, moves to purge the offending member and to re- establish a sound and wholesome order. Krutch's lifelong concern was to restore an ethical vision as richly humanistic as that of Shakespearean tragedy yet as faith- ful to modern canons of truth as the Chain of Being had been to Shakespeare's audi- ence. In Krutch's autobiography, there is a strong sense of crisis, insight and redirec- tion at two points in his career; the result in both instances was a book that seemed to write itself, rapidly, out of a fullness of conviction and intensity of feeling. The first was The Modern Temper; and to the extent that it entailed a deliberate em- bracing of human values sanctioned by art, history and tradition, it may better be termed a reversion than a conversion. Apparently it saved him from the later Marxist conversion of his contemporaries, as he became in both literary and social criticism a spokesman for a conservative humanism. Experience and Art (1932) de- veloped an aesthetic consonant with the cosmic pessimism of The Modern Temper; in it, he argued for the value of the arts in maintaining an imaginative environment hospitable to human nature, a kind of sanctuary within the inhospitable world revealed by the sciences. Was Europe a Success? (1934) developed a roughly anal- ogous argument for Western culture vis- à-vis the Marxist vision of the future. But throughout these middle years of his career he continued his youthful hobby of ama- teur microscopic investigations; he bought a rural home in Connecticut, commuting to New York; and in 1948, shortly after completing his study of Thoreau, there came a second book that, like The Mod- ern Temper, seemed to write itself as though flowing naturally from a hidden spring. It was a series of "nature" essays, based on his observations in his garden and through his microscope; and to just the extent that The Modern Temper crys- talized his early despair, so did The Twelve Seasons contain the essence of the qualified optimism of the closing decades of his career - "a kind of pantheism," as he later put it, "which was gradually coming to be an essential part of the faith . . . which would form the basis of an escape from the pessimism of The Modern Tem- per." From pessimism to pantheism in twenty years. The Twelve Seasons celebrates the arrival; but it is a pantheism essentially empirical rather than mystical or transcen- dental, a perception not of nature as mir- ror of the human spirit but of the human spirit as one of the wonders of nature. The keynote is sounded in the initial essay, in which he is concerned with spring, the historic rituals of rebirth and the absurd technical problems of placing Easter on the calendar each year. Far better, he sug- gests, to mark the day by the first sound of the spring peepers, the small frogs who voice their new life only when "the tem- perature has been above freezing often enough and long enough to bring them to life." Surely one day a year might be set aside on which to celebrate our ancient loyalties and to remember our ancient origins. And I know of none more suitable for that purpose than the Day of the Peepers. "Spring is come!" I say when I hear them, and, "The most ancient of 270</page><page sequence="5">HOMAGE TO JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH Christs has risenl" But I also add something which, for me at least, is even more important. "Don't forget," I whisper to the peepers, "we are all in this together." Implicit in this passage is Krutch's whole postretirement career as natural historian and scientific humanist, an attempt to locate man in the natural order without sacrificing the traditional norms of his hu- manity. And although it is easy and tempt- ing to identify Thoreau as the tutelary spirit in this conversion, we must consider also his involvement with Samuel Johnson. For Krutch's book on Johnson forms a nat- ural sequence with the earlier Modern Temper, the subsequent study of Thoreau, and the later works of philosophical nat- ural history. The question here is not so much Krutch's status as scholar in regard to these writers as it is the affinities that drew him to them. The relations are com- plex, but it can be said most simply that Johnson and Thoreau appear as exemplary figures in Krutch's own pantheon - trium- phant figures, that is, in whose careers he could discern versions of the dilemma vex- ing himself. II In his autobiography, Krutch specifically recalls discovering an identity of mood be- tween his Modern Temper and the somber note of Johnson's work, particularly his Rasselas. The study of Johnson still stands as one of the best general introductions, which is to say that Krutch's work is schol- arship rather than self-display, but the terms of his analysis and tonality of the whole mark his special interest. The work turns on the contrast of Johnson's pes- simism with his zest for life, and Johnson emerges implicitly as a transitional figure between an age confident of a supernatural order behind the empirical one and the modern age, confident of nothing save the empirical order. Johnson's pessimism was constitutional, even pathological, and was rationalized in an orthodox Christianity and in a body of conservative prejudices; his zest for life was equally an endowment, similarly distorted in his compulsive con- viviality, and apparently rationalized in a thoroughgoing empiricism that made ex- perience both the source and the test of knowledge. The central conflict lay in the problem of Christian faith, which John- son maintained with apparent tempera- mental difficulty, and on the basis of what- ever evidence he could find. Johnson's Rasselas is the most useful text at this point, in which Krutch finds em- bodied what he calls Johnson's "tragic sense of life." This moral tale, which tells of the discontented prince who flees his paradisiacal Happy Valley in order to know the miseries of mankind, stands as a paradigm of the relation between knowl- edge and experience; and it points to the very heart of Krutch's and Johnson's prob- lem. Rasselas, watching the goats graze nearby, articulates his malaise: Rasselas, who knew not that any one was near him, having for some time fixed his eyes upon the goats that were brousing among the rocks, began to compare their condition with his own. "What," said he, "makes the difference between man and all the rest of the animal creation? Every beast that strays beside me has the same corporal necessities with myself; he is hungry and crops the grass, he is thirsty and drinks the stream, his thirst and hunger are appeased, he is satisfied and sleeps; he rises again and is hungry, he is again fed and is at rest. I am hungry and thirsty like him, but when thirst and hunger cease I am not at rest; I am, like him, pained with want, but am not, like him, satisfied with fulness. The intermediate hours are tedious and gloomy; I long again to be hungry that I may again quicken my attention. The birds peck the berries or the corn, and fly away to the groves where they sit in seeming happiness on the branches, and waste their lives in tuning one unvaried series of sounds. I like- wise can call the lutanist and the singer, but the sounds that pleased me yesterday weary me today, and will grow yet more wearisome to- morrow. I can discover within me no power of perception which is not glutted with its proper pleasure, yet I do not feel myself delighted. Man has surely some latent sense for which this place affords no gratification, or he has some desires distinct from sense which must be satis- fied before he can be happy." After this he lifted up his head, and seeing the moon rising, walked towards the palace. As 271</page><page sequence="6">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR he passed through the fields, and saw the ani- mals around him, "Ye," said he, "are happy, and need not envy me that walk thus among you, burthened with myself; nor do I, ye gentle be- ings, envy your felicity; for it is not the felicity of man. I have many distresses from which ye are free; I fear pain when I do not feel it; I sometimes shrink at evils recollected, and some- times start at evils anticipated: surely the equity of providence has ballanced peculiar suf- ferings with peculiar enjoyments." The question, as Krutch puts it, is, "What activity is appropriate to man? In doing what does he fulfill his function and thus satisfy himself?" And, he continues, although "the passage . . . seems at least to hint the possibility that the existence of a need must imply the existence some- where of an answer to it," a later passage thematically related suggests that this dis- content is radical, that Rasselas's hope is forever doomed. Late in the narrative, Rasselas and his philosopher-guide contem- plate the pyramids of Egypt: ". . . for the pyramids no reason has ever been given adequate to the cost and labour of the work. The narrowness of the chambers proves that it could afford no retreat from enemies, and treasures might have been reposited at far less expence with equal security. It seems to have been erected only in compliance with that hunger of imagination which preys inces- santly upon life, and must be always appeased by some employment. Those who have already all that they can enjoy, must enlarge their de- sires. He that has built for use, till use is sup- plied, must begin to build for vanity, and ex- tend his plan to the utmost power of human performance, that he may not be soon reduced to form another wish. "I consider this mighty structure as a monu- ment of the insufficiency of human enjoyments. A king, whose power is unlimited, and whose treasures surmount all real and imaginary wants, is compelled to solace, by the erection of a pyramid, the satiety of dominion and taste- lessness of pleasures, and to amuse the tedious- ness of declining life, by seeing thousands labouring without end, and one stone, for no purpose, laid upon another. Whoever thou art, that, not content with a moderate condition, imaginest happiness in royal magnificence, and dreamest that command or riches can feed the appetite of novelty with perpetual gratifica- tions, survey the pyramids, and confess thy folly!" Here we can perceive Johnson's vision of man's middle state, and it is curiously yet symptomatically truncated. For al- though other writers of the eighteenth cen- tury were fond of contemplating man's medial position in the Great Chain, wiser than the brutes but below the angels, touched both by corruption and divinity, Johnson is constrained in this narrative to the merely middle state. Rasselas begins by defining himself in contrast with animal creation, and in his quest he must come to terms with these monumental trivialities, emblems of the futility of that same human aspiration, that "hunger of the imagina- tion," which sets him apart from the beasts. Indeed, he has not even the consolation of a truly middle state: bracketed on one side by his brute neighbors, he has literally no evidence for anything more. The only char- acter in the narrative to approach fulfill- ment is the mad astronomer, who has come to believe that his volition controls the weather - an absurd reduction of the sympathetic vibrations of the universe per- ceived by Lear or Hamlet, and specifically diagnosed by Johnson as the result of the "dangerous prevalence of the imagination." There are indications elsewhere that John- son considered the "hunger of the imagina- tion" to be strong evidence of the truth of Christianity; but the story of Rasselas has no religious component, and the prince's question hangs over this purely sublunary narrative unanswered, save by his sister's ironic insight that "none are happy but by the anticipation of change." What I intend to emphasize here is at once Johnson's characteristic tendencies of thought and the attractiveness of these for the author of The Modern Temper. For Johnson's hard-won religious faith, and the whole body of traditional values adher- ing to it, were what had fallen out of Krutch's world, while at the same time Johnson's enormous experiential vitality, his immersion in the world of sense and common sense, planted him squarely in 272</page><page sequence="7">HOMAGE TO JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH the mainstream of empirical thought that runs from Bacon to our own day. Krutch's study is consistent with more recent interpretations of Johnson that have stressed his consistent skepticism and em- piricism in almost all matters but religious ones, and it now seems clear that the many inconsistencies of his career stem from a powerful conflict between convictions sanc- tioned by both religion and tradition and convictions forced upon him by his tem- peramental receptivity to immediate ex- perience. Historically Johnson looms as a great conservative and the last interpreter of a neoclassical tradition with its roots in Aristotle and Horace. But in the actual play of mind revealed in his engagement with the literary texts, the ultimate test is not conformity to rule but the experience of the reader, and his criticism is as notable in detail for its radical independence as it is in its main outlines for its traditional values. His personal life reveals the capacity for doubt, for rigorous scrutiny of ideas, that was well known to his contemporaries. Hogarth perceived its boundaries quite clearly: "That man," he said, "is not con- tented with believing the Bible, but he fairly resolves, I think, to believe nothing but the Bible." Mrs. Thrale, who reports the saying, adds: "Mr. Johnson's incredu- lity amounted almost to a disease." And Johnson perceived these boundaries him- self. His belief in Christianity depended heavily on accepting the traditional Chris- tian evidences as evidence, rather than rest- ing easily on faith, and of the evidence for life after death, he could say, in terror and despite his conviction - "I like to have more." It is entirely characteristic, in this per- spective, that while the bulk of Johnson's writing expresses a sober morality grounded in religion, his prose style is penetrated with figures drawn from the new science and his dictionary is heavily freighted with words from the same source. It is likewise characteristic that Johnson's direct and im- mediate engagement with the miseries of man's middle state should make him the eighteenth century's severest critic of the concept of the Great Chain of Being, which for many of his contemporaries served to locate that middle state and to rationalize its miseries in terms of the perfection of the whole. For in a powerful review of a work by a dilettante named Soame Jenyns, John- son's logic, fueled by his passion, served to demolish the metaphysical system that might have afforded a less strenuously em- pirical mind a unifying structure for his essentially conservative commitments, and perhaps an ameliorating optimism to bal- ance the radical discontent that emerges in Rasselas. Jenyns had written A Free Erir quiry into the Nature and Origin of Evil, arguing in what had become a conven- tional way that man's perception of evil derives from his limited perspective in his middle state - that, in Pope's phrase, partial evil is universal good. Johnson disliked metaphysics generally, but Jenyns's version outraged him by its imaginative justifica- tion of specifically human miseries in the pleasure and utility of some hypothetically higher order of beings, an order whose character Jenyns unconsciously infers from the basest aspects of human nature. In Jenyns's words: Man is one link of that vast chain. ... If we look downwards, we see innumerable species of inferior Beings, whose happiness and lives are dependent on his will; we see him cloathed by their spoils, and fed by their miseries and destruction, inslaving some, tormenting others, and murdering millions for his luxury or diversion; is it not therefore analogous and highly probable, that the happiness and life of Man should be equally dependent on the wills of his superiors? We are here somewhere between a world penetrated by anthropomorphic powers and one ruled by blind determinism - be- tween the imaginations of Shakespeare and Hardy, we might say. Johnson's critique is essentially logical (that a superior order would necessarily be above such purely hu- man needs), but the real devastation of Jenyns's conception is accomplished in the controlled passion of Johnson's satire: He might have shown, that these "hunters, whose game is man," have many sports analo- 273</page><page sequence="8">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR gous to our own. As we drown whelps and kit- tens, they amuse themselves, now and then, with sinking a ship, and stand round the fields of Blenheim, or the walls of Prague, as we encircle a cockpit. As we shoot a bird flying, they take a man in the midst of his business or pleasure, and knock him down with an apoplexy. . . . Many a merry bout have these frolick beings at the vicissitudes of an ague, and good sport it is to see a man tumble with an epilepsy, and revive and tumble down again, and all this he knows not why. ... a set of beings, unseen and unheard, are hovering about us, trying experiments upon our sensibility, putting us in agonies, to see our limbs quiver; torturing us to madness, that they may laugh at our vagaries; sometimes obstructing the bile, that they may see how a man looks, when he is yellow; sometimes breaking a traveller's bones, to try how he will get home; sometimes wasting a man to a skeleton, and sometimes killing him fat, for the greater elegance of his hide. This was the Johnson whose native pes- simism, even despair, was so belied by his human sympathies that he kept in his household as family a collection of un- fortunates and misfits whose only claim on him was their necessity. This was likewise the Johnson whose compassion moved him to befriend ailing prostitutes from the street and to press pennies into the hands of sleeping beggar-children. And whose at- tachment to this middle state was so strong as to provoke a final, pitiful experiment on his deathbed, as, mistaking symptom for cause, he slashed his swollen legs with scis- sors to see if draining the fluid would pro- long his life. "I want length of life," he cried to the physician attending him, "and you fear giving me pain, which I care not for/' Again, the point here is not so much to interpret Johnson as to suggest that there are deep parallels between Johnson Ago- nistes and Krutch Agonistes. Central must have been Johnson's heroic achievement in maintaining at once a living belief in the traditional norms of humanity and a thoroughly modern sense of evidence. The erosion of the first of these by the second had been Krutch's theme in The Modern Temper, and that erosion is certainly the twentieth-century result of the Baconian current that swirled around Johnson's faiths. No doubt Johnson's own eager em- brace of experience for the sake of knowl- edge is the easiest aspect of his temper for us to understand, and although Johnson has no mention in the sweep of history Krutch covers in that early book, it is easy to see the attraction he would later have as a negative instance of a thesis Krutch had so reluctantly propounded - a man of im- mense skepticism, immense humanity, and immense commitment to sustaining values. And Krutch himself would soon find that the best cure for a spirit sick with the knowledge borne of experience was - more knowledge and more experience. Ill Krutch's interpretation of Thoreau de- lineates a similar exemplary struggle. For the base line of our observations, we can take a passage from Waiden that should by now have a familiar ring: As I came home through the woods with my string of fish, trailing my pole, it being now quite dark, I caught a glimpse of a woodchuck stealing across my path, and felt a strange thrill of savage delight, and I was strongly tempted to seize and devour him raw; not that I was hungry then, except for that wildness which he represented. Once or twice, however, while I lived at the pond, I found myself ranging the woods, like a half-starved hound, with a strange abandonment, seeking some kind of venison which I might devour, and no morsel could have been too savage for me. The wildest scenes had become unaccountably familiar. I found in myself, and still find, an instinct toward a higher, or as it is named, spiritual life, as do most men, and another toward a primitive rank and savage one, and I reverence them both. I love the wild not less than the good. From here we can look both ways, to- ward Rasselas contemplating the beasts in his valley and toward Krutch communing with his spring frogs in Connecticut. Clearly, for Johnson, man and the rest of creation were discontinuous, whereas Tho- reau perceived a continuity radiating in two directions from himself - down through 274</page><page sequence="9">HOMAGE TO JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH the woodchuck realm, upward through the realm of spirit. And whereas the whole point of Rasselas's quest seems to be that man's nature is not to be fulfilled in this world, Thoreau's whole argument in Waiden is that it can be, if only the re- sources of the Chain in both directions are tapped. Krutch's inferences are not so simple as either of these, but they are strongly marked by his experience with Thoreau, who, like Johnson, attracted Krutch by the creative tension between the doctrine he needed to live by and the raw experience that rendered this doctrine prob- lematical. But in the case of Thoreau, the struggle is nothing so simple as that be- tween religious orthodoxy and native skep- ticism, for the whole is suffused with the nineteenth-century romantic reinterpreta- tion of the world, and further qualified by the context of the transcendentalism that was the New England version of this change. Transcendentalism is not identical with pantheism, and it is possible to em- brace either without the other, but it is Thoreau's empirical working out of his own prophetic pantheism in a dialectic with the implicit dogma of Emerson's transcendentalism that forms our analogue with Samuel Johnson here. What Krutch discerns in Thoreau, par- ticularly in the notebooks from which Waiden was so painstakingly quarried, is another unwritten Waiden, a darker Wai- den, implicit in those observations that cluster about a pole distant from the Emer- sonian optimism. It is a commonplace to say that Thoreau put Emerson's ideas to the test of experience; and what Krutch perceives is a perceptible shift from an early Emersonian doctrine, in which the natural world is read as an allegory of human values, toward a concern for nat- ural fact as corrective or instructive to hu- man egoism. Krutch invokes a metaphor reminiscent of the lost certainties of The Modern Temper, describing Thoreau's oscillation between "Ptolemaic" and "Cop- ernican" conceptions of man's place in nature; and he perceives Thoreau moving toward a pantheism much less humanistic than that implied in Emerson's assertion that "the whole of nature is a metaphor of the human mind. The laws of moral nature answer to those of matter as face to face in a glass." Thoreau was capable of embracing this doctrine, but only intermittently, and only in a dialectic with a less anthropo- centric version of the relationship between nature and mind. Within the same year (1852) he could write not only that "the constant inquiry which nature puts is: Are you virtuous?" and that "the perception of beauty is a moral test," but also that I do not value any view of the universe into which man and the institutions of man enter very largely or absorb much attention. Man is but the place where I stand, and the prospect hence is infinite. . . . The universe is larger than enough for man's abode. Some rarely go outdoors, most are always at home at night, very few indeed have stayed out all night once in their lives, fewer still have gone behind the world of humanity, seen its institutions like toadstools by the wayside. Surely this is the Copernican pole of his thought, and at times he seems to orbit into an icy indifference that borders on the inhuman. "From the very beginning," Krutch writes, "he had tended in moments of stress, to seek consolation by identifying himself with the nature which is indifferent to us rather than with a nature which is part of us." At age twenty-four, he wrote concerning the death of his brother: "What right have I to grieve, who have not ceased to wonder? . . . Soon the ice will melt, and the blackbirds sing along the river which he frequented, as pleasantly as ever. The same everlasting serenity will appear on the face of God, and we will not be sorrow- ful if he is not." And some years later he could reply to one who queried him about happiness: Why! the stones are happy, Concord River is happy, and I am happy too. When I took up a fragment of walnut-shell this morning, I saw by its very grain and composition, its form and color, etc. that it was made for happiness. . . . Do you think that Concord River would have continued to flow these millions of years by Clamshell Hill and round Hunt's Island, if it had not been happy - if it had been miserable 275</page><page sequence="10">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR in its channel, tired of existence, and cursing its maker and the hour it sprang? As Krutch puts it, "to ask that man be happy like the Concord River is to ap- proach a sort of pantheism which seems on the point of breaking the last link with humanity." Krutch connects this drift toward cosmic detachment with a tendency, after 1855, toward a more and more laborious cata- loguing of natural phenomena, always to the end of "an emotional as well as an in- tellectual participation in natural pro- cesses," but apparently yielding this union less readily as his knowledge increased, and then on terms that render man's position in the natural order, however spiritualized, extremely problematical. What insights must come to one on his belly in the mud, watching a turtle hatch from its egg? "If Iliads are not composed in our day, snap- ping turtles are hatched and arrived at maturity." Krutch saw Thoreau as moving toward what might be called, by contrast with Emerson, earned insight: "away from the transcendental assumption that the meaning of nature can be reached by intui- tion and toward what is the fundamental scientific assumption - namely, that only through observation may one ultimately reach not merely dead facts but also those which understanding can make live." This is not to make Thoreau into a scientist, for he was himself largely antipathetic to the natural science of his day, which was in the main devoted to anatomy and taxon- omy. He for a time supplied specimens for the zoologists at Harvard, and noted, after killing a turtle for the sake of science, that he had a "murderer's experience in a de- gree." The most that can be said is that Thoreau's instincts for observation were those of a scientist, while the sciences he would have loved - ethology, for instance, and the modern, comprehensive vision of ecology - had not yet emerged. Nor had the kind of imaginative and philosophical ap- prehension of natural history that descends to Krutch through such writers as Bur- roughs, Muir and Julian Huxley. Thoreau stands as isolated in his way as was Johnson: divided from doctrinaire transcendentalism by his empirical percep- tion of the marginal human realm within the immensity of the natural, and divided from the certainty of science by its aridity of spirit. His immersion in the natural is the complement of Johnson's in the hu- man: he loved nature "because she is not man but a retreat from him." "He is con- straint, she is freedom to me. . . ." And the aim of this freedom is nothing more or less than knowledge: "How sweet is the perception of a new natural fact! Suggest- ing what worlds remain to be unveiled." Clearly, however, transcendentalist dogma was not adequate to assimilate the facts, and at his almost pathologically re- mote moments Thoreau seems on the brink of what we would call alienation; certainly he implies an awareness and an acceptance of a view of man's marginal place in the universe strikingly similar to that in The Modern Temper. Yet a faith remained, perhaps receiving subterranean nourish- ment from Concord Christianity, that the universe sanctioned an ethical stance. As Krutch concludes, "Thoreau seems never to have perceived quite clearly the dif- ference between saying that nature con- firms man's moral notions and saying, as he himself seems to become more and more inclined to say by implication, that what nature teaches is morality even when it conflicts with what either the individual or society has assumed." The equanimity with which Thoreau accepted his own early death has been often admired, as has his response to the query as to whether he had made his peace with his maker: "I was not aware we had ever quarreled." Presumably that decorum was grounded in a faith in the natural order that Krutch found as at- tractive as Johnson's warmer commitment to the human order. And it can be said that Johnson's temperamental commitment to the human condition cut him of! from an easy relationship with a larger order; whereas Thoreau's single-minded commit- ment to a larger order tended to cut him off from normal human concourse. The failures of each are as instructive as their characteristic triumphs. 276</page><page sequence="11">HOMAGE TO JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH IV Thoreau, however, did not have to as- similate into even his most Copernican vision the bad news that has vitiated hu- manistic thought since his time - Darwin, Marx, Freud, Pavlov. All of whom, in con- cert, have effectively robbed modern man of his faith in his priviledged place in the order of creation. The spiritual realm evaporates, the Chain of Being is termi- nated at man and drained of its cosmic import. Thoreau is leveled with his wood- chuck, which in turn is reduced to a stimu- lus-response mechanism, and the ground is laid for the despair that Krutch articu- lated in The Modern Temper. This is the zero point that he begins to move from with his essay on the spring peepers. "We are all in this together." A long way from Rasselas's assumptions about the unique position of man, or even Thoreau's. Out of this moment of insight came Krutch's postprofessional career and his systematic reassembly of a world man can live in. In the most general sense, this meant to give up the comprehensive hy- potheses of the various determinisms on which The Modern Temper had been based, and this for the best of reasons: be- cause they were, for all their range of cer- titude, inadequate to important areas of experience and destructive of unique hu- man potential. His argument in these years progressed along two fronts: the one best represented by two volumes of social criti- cism {The Measure of Man, 1953, and Human Nature and the Human Condi- tion, 1959), the other by his several vol- umes of nature essays (especially The De- sert Year, 1952, and The Great Chain of Life, 1956). The main thrust of the first pair was to define a uniquely privileged human nature and to rescue it from the social dogmas implicit in mechanistic bio- logy, statistical sociology, and stimulus- response psychology - dogmas that might be subsumed in the popular fallacy that "man is an animal and an animal is a ma- chine." His achievement is to meet these adversaries on their own grounds, to detect the unwarranted extensions of their claims, and to create in the margins between their legitimate competencies a basis for what he calls Minimal Man: the few things needed to justify in the natural order the traditional norms of human value. As complement to these wide-ranging essays are his nature books, continuations of the impulse tapped in The Twelve Sea- sons, and really the basis on which his social criticism is built. The best of these is The Great Chain of Life, which carries for- ward the premise arrived at in the earlier book, that "we are a part of Nature, never- theless, no matter what she may be. . . . Whatever we discover about her we are discovering also about ourselves." Few in these days could disagree, but this premise rests in turn upon another that separates Krutch from his opponents: that man has mistakenly conceived Nature upon the model of a machine, thus alienating him- self from the principle of life. The Great Chain of Life seeks to rectify this error, which has collapsed man and his values into mere conditioned behavior and has posited a blind evolutionary mechanism as the sole principle connecting man and the rest of creation. Krutch reexamines the whole question, working his way up the phylogenetic scale with his microscope, his field observations, and his keenly felt rapport with the natural order. What emerges most obviously is a purely biologi- cal basis for a solid core of human values; what emerges also, however, is a criticism of mechanist and behaviorist theories of evolution and biology for their failures to be empirical enough - that is, for loving the security of a hypothesis (or a dogma) too well to assess adequately the whole body of human experience. For Krutch does not at all object to assimilating man wholly to the phylogenetic scale, provided that one does not fall prey to "mechano- morphism," that is, the fallacy of inter- preting living entities upon the reductive model of a machine. For merely to be alive is to participate in a complex and wonder- ful enterprise, one much richer than the mere elaboration of survival mechanisms can explain; and life contemplated wholly and openly reveals evidence not only for 277</page><page sequence="12">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR the deepest-laid of traditional values but for an optimistic view of man's place in nature, a special glory and a special fu- ture attaching to that nature that is uniquely human. Neither so cosmically pes- simistic as Johnson nor so cosmically opti- mistic as Thoreau, yet as deeply attached to the human order as Johnson and to the natural order as Thoreau, Krutch offers in his own career the example of the restora- tive power of our literary heritage. For by this time, he is able to see our need for literature, and for the arts generally, in a more positive light than in the thoroughly existentialist Experience and Art of 1932. Now he sees it not merely as a symbolic alternative world to the natural order, but as a unique product of that order as man is a unique product, a refined adaptive in- strument for exploring the potential of that aspect of nature that is human. Cut off from that realm of experience, he warns, and nurturing ourselves solely on the se- ductive certainties of an arid naturalism, we run the risk of betraying ourselves and our destiny. I have mentioned that I find Krutch a prophetic figure, especially in The Modern Temper. At the time of his death in 1970, he had lived just to the verge of but not into the contemporary age of ecological awareness. Certainly he prefigured this awareness; no doubt he helped in some measure to bring it about. What is most interesting, however, is to contemplate the implicit prophecy of his later study when set against his particular concern for the death of tragedy in the modern world. Krutch had succeeded in finding a basis for human value in the natural order, but he had not wholly connected his philo- sophic and social concerns with his earlier literary ones. It takes only a little reflec- tion, however, to bring together his early essay on the intimate universe in which tragedy occurs with his late study of man's deep affinities with the scale of life below him, and to bring into alignment with these hierarchies not only the classical Great Chain of Being - which mediates among them all - but also the Darwinian evolutionary succession and the sensitive, mutually interdependent ecological hier- archy that we now know to be the basis of life on our small planet. It can be said that the latent paradox in the classical concep- tion - that is, the ascending degrees of per- fection as opposed to the equal importance of each degree to the whole - that this latent paradox operated in a very impor- tant way in that sea-change from the eigh- teenth into the nineteenth century; that gradually the concept of equality of in- dividual members and the fulfillment of individual aspiration came to predominate over the concept of subordination within the hierarchy. Thus, socially and politically, the great egalitarian revolutions; thus also the attractiveness of the Darwinian version of the Chain, which brought the hierarchy into the temporal world of process and change and sanctioned the many varieties of aggressive individualism. But at the same time as this egalitarian revolution was leveling differences within the human order, the human order itself was elevated to an unprecedented degree of power over the rest of nature. Man's technological mas- tery over his environment does not ap- proach the mad astronomer's dream of con- trolling the weather, but the self-regarding impulse is the same, and the difference is merely that we have devised techniques to realize only slightly less grandiose dreams. The result has been a purely human pat- tern of material aggrandizement that has swiftly and irretrievably debased the com- plexity, variety and beauty of the living world as a whole. In an older time, with an older notion of a stable hierarchy, man could conceive of an action of his own of such magnitude as to set the very cosmos reeling and mobilizing its forces to ex- punge his error; in the interval since then, man has come to think of the hierarchy as a kingdom that he can rule, subject to no law save his own will and a few blind forces that circumscribe the whole. The extinction of some species, the steady at- trition of others, the actual poisoning of the communal air and water, have been the more notable results of this pursuit of happiness. 278</page><page sequence="13">HOMAGE TO JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH Much has been made of "the ecology," a term that implies an absolute state. In point of fact, there must always be an ecological order so long as there is life, whether the order is lacking the passenger pigeon or man himself. Our knowledge of thermodynamics reveals that the most prob- able condition is absolute disorder, the entropie state toward which all things tend, and that nothing is more improbable than the complex organization that is life itself. From a limited human point of view, one order may seem as good as another. Few of us miss the buffalo or the long-grass prairie. But the world we now inhabit is demonstrably poorer because less com- plexly ordered, a few stages closer to the nullity and void we rush toward with steady acceleration. At our present inter- mediate stage, we must recognize that the concern for "the ecology" is implicitly a value judgment in favor of a complex over a reduced order. The inferences tend to be ethical, but the basic perception would seem to be aesthetic, while the order itself, as a body of empirical data, is certified as true by our science. What we are on the verge of realizing in our own time - knowl- edge forced upon us by purely empirical fact, knowledge certainly unknown to Shakespeare but darkly dreamed of - is that the whole order is one life, all parts mu- tually interdependent, within which we, from our privileged position, can offend and offend and offend. In such a universe - now a fact, rather than a metaphysical conception - our own modern version of tragedy becomes pos- sible. So long as man's concerns are merely human, focused on bending the rest of nature to his whims, tragedy, as Krutch suggests, is not possible, for there is no higher order man can conceive of offend- ing and no law governing his actions to- ward the order below him. But we can now perceive how possible it is to so dis- order the Chain of Life through our mon- strous egoism as to wreak immense havoc upon ourselves, either through spectacular disaster or slow attrition and degradation. No doubt the ethical insights of high tragedy, from Sophocles to Shakespeare, were the fruit of centuries of bitter experi- ence with man's capacity for folly, a cumu- lative wisdom absorbed by the writer from the very air his culture breathed. This new tragedy I speak of now has, of course, not been written: it exists only as a hypo- thetical correlate of the emerging wisdom regarding our place in the natural order, and if it comes to be written, we can only speculate on its characteristics. The greater problem is whether the wisdom can be wholly born, become part of the air our culture breathes, without the discipline, the empirical evidence, of our grandest capacity for folly. If this is possible, we may in fact be wise enough to live in our world without needing exemplary tales of our highest abilities to bring disaster upon our heads. If this is not possible, and if brute experience is all we can learn from, these new tragedies, of our children's chil- dren, or of those after them, may well be of such terrors as we cannot imagine. Or there may be the ultimate tragedy of all, unwritten, because there will be no author, no audience, no humanity - merely a de- based natural order whose leading citizen was not good enough to survive. 279</page></plain_text>
