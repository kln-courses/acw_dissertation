Pp. 1-248; 56 col. pls., 56 line drawings. 10 X 131/4 in. $20.00.-Amid the deluge of specialized books and papers on every imaginable aspect of avian biology, it is refreshing to find one that is frankly a picture book. Birds of the northern forest is one of these; I shall evaluate it on that basis. During the past decade, lovers of "bird art" have watched with interest the career of J. Fenwick Lansdowne, a young painter of great talent and promise. His carefully posed birds, subtle backgrounds, and studied compositions have few equals. Among the well-known moderns in bird painting, probably only Amuchastegui excels him in draftsmanship. Draftsmanship, however, is a two-edged blade. It can be a valued tool in the hands of a master, or it can rule the one who would control it, as it is has apparently ruled Mr. Lansdowne in painting the plates for this book. His preoccupa- tion with the details of draftsmanship, particularly its lineal aspects, has in my opinion produced serious faults of emphasis, form, and feather quality. Faults of emphasis are present in at least forty places throughout the book. A par- ticularly glaring example is found in plate 4, the Lesser Scaup. Here, Mr. Lansdowne shows the vermiculated back pattern of the adult male as becoming lighter in color posteriorly on the bird. In examining 15 well-preserved museum specimens of adult male Lesser Scaup, I found not one example of the posterior lightening of color the plate shows. In fact, the opposite is true-the vermiculations of the back pattern closest to the tail take on a "white on black" appearance. Both merganser plates dis- play a lack of contrast in pattern, particularly in the vermiculations of the flank feathers, which are more prominent in both species than Mr. Lansdowne has painted them. In another example none of the 33 Common Snipe specimens that I examined had a breast so markedly striped as that of the snipe in plate 14. A similar fault of overemphasis occurs in the pattern of the sandpipers' breast feathers in plates 15 and 16. Other plates that show faulty emphasis are those of the Hawk-Owl, the Olive- sided Flycatcher, the Winter Wren, the Solitary Vireo, and the Rusty Blackbird, to name the more obvious examples. In observing the faults of form and contour that I found in many of the plates in this book, I had the feeling that the artist may have seen but few of these species alive. This could explain the crook-necked Canada Goose, the peculiarly curved wing</page><page sequence="2">Jan. ] Reviews 153 1968 1 of the Boreal Owl, the oddly jutting contours of the Hawk-Owl's wing, and the doubly convex ventral surface of the Spruce Grouse's rectrices. The feathers of birds have at least one quality that Mr. Lansdowne, with a few notable exceptions (such as plates 22 and 42), has ignored. This quality is translu- cence. It is particularly evident where the feathers are thin, patterned and many layered, for the pattern of the feathers lying beneath shows through the layers above them, giving great depth to their appearance. The plates of the Lesser Yellow-legs, Hawk-Owl, Great Gray Owl, Long-eared Owl, Northern Three-toed Woodpecker, Her- mit Thrush, Gray-cheeked Thrush, Northern Shrike, Black-throated Blue Warbler, and Fox Sparrow show imperfect handling of feather translucence by the artist. Color faults are the most numerous of any in the book. These could have been caused by several things-unfaithful color reproduction, carelessness of the artist, and/ or the use of foxed or faded museum specimens as color guides. Whatever the cause, at least eight plates suffer badly from overall rustiness. The plates of the Hooded and Red-breasted mergansers are probably the worst examples; 35 other plates have color faults of various sorts and degrees: the Red-breasted Nuthatch is too green, the Purple Finch too red, the Hermit Thrush too brown, the male Pine Gros- beak too pale, and the Fox Sparrow too pale and washed out, to name a few examples. In at least four plates-those of the Black-backed Three-toed Woodpecker, the Mag- nolia Warbler, the Blackburnian Warbler, and the Evening Grosbeak-the yellow is simply not bright enough. Errors of measurement and proportion are scattered throughout the book. The Lesser Scaup plate shows the male with head and bill vastly out of proportion to the swim-length of the bird. The bills of the mergansers are too long and the eyes set too far back and too high on the head, with the result that the whole "fierce" appear- ance of the birds is lost. The toes on the Peregrine seem far too attenuated. In the Black-backed Three-toed Woodpecker plate, both birds have heads and bills too long in proportion to body length. The tarsi of the thrushes are much too thin, the feet of the Raven and of the Evening Grosbeaks are too small, and the heads of the fly- catchers, the Winter Wren, the Evening Grosbeak, and the female Purple Finch are noticeably too large. It seems to me that if one is to belong by choice to the feather- for-feather accuracy school, a centimeter rule and a pair of calipers might be handy things to have about. Certain other flaws mar the picture-book quality of Birds of the northern forest. The tarsometatarsi of ducks are laterally compressed and are smooth and glossy on live birds. Without exception, the tarsi and toes on Mr. Lansdowne's ducks are thick, rough, and dull. The eyes of some of the birds are also disturbing: those of the Common Loon, the Red-breasted Merganser, the Hawk-Owl, and the Great Gray Owl seem about to pop out of their sockets. Regarding the less definable objectives of "bird art," I believe that Mr. Lansdowne's consistently linear treatment of his subject sometimes causes him to lose the "feel" of a species. The plate of the Great Gray Owl is a case in point. This huge, mothlike creature with its almost incredibly soft and fluffy plumage has been reduced to a cut- paper copy of itself. Its back feathering, whether from artistic intent or poor color masking, has all the softness of a turtle's carapace. That Mr. Lansdowne can often capture the abstract quality of a species is amply demonstrated in several of the preliminary sketches preceding the finished plates. Whether or not these are "field sketches" in the literal sense of the word, I do not know, but with few exceptions they have more spontaneity, vigor, and life than the</page><page sequence="3">154 Reviews [AVuk5 finished plates. The Lincoln's Sparrow sketch for plate 56 is an especially fine example of the regression from vivacity to embalmment. On the good side Mr. Lansdowne's sense of composition is always sure and com- petent, sometimes bold and striking as in the Hawk-Owl plate, and sometimes exquisite as in the Ten.nessee Warbler plate. His draftsmanship, the pitfalls of which I have taken such pains to point out, is nonetheless excellent. Some particularly shining exam- ples are the siskin in the Northern Shrike plate, the whole of the Philadelphia Vireo plate, the flowers in the Peregrine plate, the satiny sheen of the Horned Grebe's plu- mage in plate 2, most of the Tennessee Warbler plate, and the female Myrtle Warbler in plate 42. Mr. John Livingston's text, which accompanies each plate, is reasonably informative to the beginning birder. Sometimes, as in the account of the Merlin, the writing is simple, straightforward, and pleasurable to read. More often, it is flawed by redun- dancies, anthropomorphism, and diatribe. I find in the account of the Solitary Sand- piper two especially graphic examples of anthropomorphism: "it has defied conven- tion by nesting in trees," and "they merely fall as gracefully as possible." Others: in the account of the Great Gray Owl facing plate 19 we are told that "an archaism" can "happily" disappear; regarding the mating behavior of the Winter Wren in the ac- count facing plate 30, "he will cheerfully turn polygamist;" and concerning the plu- mage of the Bay-breasted Warbler facing plate 45, we learn that the male has "impec- cable good taste. It even wears a pale stiff collar around its neck." Other remarks of similar ilk are scattered generously throughout the text. I will list no more of them, except for this last unclassifiable gem on the food habits of the Northern Waterthrush, facing plate 48, "In the heavy underbrush, it maintains a constant search for small aquatic animals." Mr. Livingston's literary style, I fear, is not my cup of tea. The technical aspects of the book-color plates, printing, layout, etc.-seem to be competently done. Twenty-three of the plates in my copy have the green run in the color process a fraction of a millimeter off-register, but this slight imperfection is noticeable only if one is looking for it and does not greatly spoil the overall fidelity of the printing. Errors of typography, grammar, and usage are relatively few. For- mat and typeset are generally attractive and the author-artist team and their printers and publishers are to be congratulated for having produced a quality publication at a comparatively moderate price. In conclusion, for the amateur birder, for the uncritical admirer of "bird art," and for the cocktail table, the Lansdowne-Livingston volume is a felicitous addition to the personal library. Those who want to see the "spirit" of the bird beneath the feathers must await Mr. Lansdowne's further development as an artist.-COLLEEN H. NELSON.</page></plain_text>
