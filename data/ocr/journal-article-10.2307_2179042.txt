DELBOS, Rev. de MWt., XXIX, 2, pp. 157-,76. I. The method of demonstration in Fichte's philosophy: No attempt is made to explain Fichte's doctrine in detail, but merely to outline his method and indicate its results. 'Deduction' is a misnomer for his method, which undoubtedly operates a prori, and is more exactly a progress from the abstract to the concrete. During this progressus the mind strives to find again, under the form of consciousness or practical realization, its true original self. Fichte insists that nothing is given in the mind except what the mind posits in itself, and that every given which is considered absolute is contradictory to the essence of mind. Consequently, we must follow the mind's action itself if we are to discover the conditions of knowledge. We must understand everything at its source, beginning with the First Principle (the absolutely unconditioned Ego). But as the 'I' is the only thing originally posited, the -original opposition must be the 'Not-I.' This second proposition, unconditioned in form, is conditioned in content, because it is determined by the 'I.' Similarly the 'I' implies the 'Not-I,' or in other words is determined by it. To reconcile the thesis (the 'I') with the antithesis (the 'Not-I'), we find the synthesis in the Absolute Ego which is posited as the union of the 'I' and the 'Not-I.' This reconciliation is possible only because the 'I' and the 'Not-I' limit each other reciprocally. To be limited means to be partially (not wholly) suppressed and thus to be divisible. It is only by this divisibility, by this faculty of being limited that the 'I' and the ' Not-I' can be combined in the unity of self-consciousness. In developing his system, Fichte not only invoked the synthetic power of reason suggested by io8</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. lo9 Kant, but he declares that the synthetic function is the peculiar and essen- tial function of mind. Its task is not only to unite the diverse, but also to resolve the oppositions -created by the advance of the mind itself. In its essential aspects, Fichte's method belongs to German speculative idealism, and we find it again extended and transformed in the thought of Schelling and Hegel. II. The method of demonstration in Schelling's philosophy: With Schelling, method qua method remains subordinate. His thought never fails to be poetic and intuitive even when necessarily demonstrative. He extends the operation of Fichte's method, first, by adding the philosophy of Nature to the philosophy of the Ego, and then by expounding the system of identity. Nature as -object we can learn to know through experience, but nature as subject, productive nature (natura naturals), we can know only by positing the supreme causes of natural phenomena. We must ad- mit, as an absolute presupposition, that it is the ensemble of phenomena that truly constitutes nature, and that this All is both product and productive. Thus we have a duality of principle at the very heart of creative nature's identity. Originally, knowledge comes only from experience, but this empirical knowledge becomes a priori when we recognize it as necessary. If we can know nature a priori, it is because nature itself is a priori. Nature being an organic whole, the 'organization rather than the materials it employs is the controlling principle of explanation. The whole ex- plains the parts, not vice versa. Nature is at once productive and know- able. But in order to be knowable, its productivity at each instant must be limited and checked. This limitation to nature's infinite activity is self-imposed. The possibility of nature depends upon this duality (a duality within identity)-on the one hand a productive and positive tendency, on the other a tendency that is anti-productive and negative. The products of nature mark a moment of rest in the creative activity, and in them creative nature for a time is *concentrated, so that infinite repro- duction is made possible-product begets product and becomes the principle of endless evolution. For Schelling, Nature is provided with that faculty of production which Fichte attributed to the Ego. What in nature seems like a 'thing,' like 'matter' or an 'atom' is in. reality the product of forces. Whatever exists is the result of action, and action is possible only where there is opposition and reconciliation-thesis, anti- thesis, synthesis. Unlike Fichte, Schelling seeks ultimately in beauty and art for the secret of that identity which exists in conscious and unconscious activity. L. S. CRAWFORD. The Rationality of the Belief in the Reality of God. EUGENE W. LYMAN. Journal of Religion, II, 5, pp. 449-465. The idea of God arises spontaneously in the midst of living religious</page><page sequence="3">110 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXII. experience. Its rationality depends on whether religion gives us access to reality. Unlike science, which only pursues facts, and ethics and aes- thetics, whose subject matter is values, religion has to study the fundamen- tal relations between facts and value. The idea of God shares this two- fold reference: it connotes reality, value, and some underlying principle of relation between these. God is a Cosmic Mind, who is working for the conservation and creation of value, and with whom man may be in rela- tions of conscious communion and co-operation. Is it rational to believe in the existence of such a being? Organized religious experience sup- ports the rationality of such belief, just as scientific experience supports the rationality of belief in natural and historical fields. Indeed the full meaning of religion is gained only through vital relation with a cosmic God who is creating and conserving values. The perceptive intuition of a divine presence and the synthetic intuition of a totality full of divine significance must be brought into relation with scientific judg- ments about reality and shown to be a coherent body of truth. This is the task of theology. The intuition of personality and of equality and solidarity belong together and enter into the intuition of God. The intuitions of prayer, reconciliation, truth, faith, beauty, har- mony, love, and sympathy must be organized into a systematic whole. In discussing the relation of religious and scientific reality, it is found that synthesis of knowledge in the sciences reveals a progress, an up- ward trend, which supports the rationality of believing in a real God, whose transcendent qualities give significance to man's efforts. We must not only communicate and co-operate with this Cosmic Mind, which works to conserve and create values, but also must try to conceive of its relations to the cosmos itself. The laws of physical nature and the whole mech- anism of inorganic reality are the groundwork for value-creating process, the activity of an infinite, all-pervading Power. This inspires faith in the ultimate spiritualization of the universe. MABEL V. WILSON. The Hindu Dharma. S. RADHAKRISHNAN. Int. J. E. XXXIII, I, pp. 1-22. Dharma is neither merely subjective nor external, but is accepted tradi- tion, and signifies all the influences that shape the individual and social destiny of man. It is the ethical and religious law regulating the life of the Hindu in every detail. It does not insist upon any set religious dogma, for truth is held to be not a matter of formula but of depth of spiritual experience, diversity of faith being part of the scheme of Provi- dence. The ends of life are four,-dharma, or duty, moksha, or liberation, artha, or wealth, and kama, or pleasure. Moksha or liberation, is the aspira- tion of Atman, the soul, to come to its own. Only through dharma, the right regulation of artha and kama, can the divine destiny of the soul be achieved. Man comes into being for a divine purpose. Though the actual</page><page sequence="4">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. III man is separated from the well-nigh impossible ideal, the ideal is not thereby distorted. Holiness is attained only - by slow stages through sacrifice and discipline. The highest life is that which translates into ac- tion the indwelling spirit of God; that which is the embodiment of self- denial, brotherly love and purity, of truth, beauty and goodness. The rules of dharma are relative to the four stages in the life of the Hindu, and to the caste to which the individual belongs. The caste system forms a real aristocracy; it is necessitated by the racial difference of Indian peoples; it takes account of the variance in natural gifts and abilities, and is thereby conducive to economic efficiency and to the attainment of moksha. When the classes fulfill their special functions, society is in accord with dharma and God is glorified therein. The caste system has resulted in the preservation and expansion of Aryan culture; even the lower classes being gradually civilized. The Orient has been mightily in- fluenced, both in religious life and in art, by the pervading "vision of the unity of all things in God" that has gone out from India. And as hitherto, has synthetized all the mighty influences she has met, so now it may be her privilege to harmonize "the mighty currents of the world's great religions that have met on her soil." EMMA E. COUGHLIN. The Heart of Hinduism. S. RADHAKRISHRAN. Hibbert Journal, XXI, I, pp. 5-19. Hinduism is at once a philosophy and a religion. The source of its beginning was the question of reality amidst the passing world, and the Hindu thinkers found the answer in Brahman, which, philosophically, is re- vealed as the indestructible Absolute, and religiously, is envisaged as the Divine Self-consciousness. The world is in a constant state of involution and evolution, and beings may be graded according to the degree to which they are manifestations of the Absolute. The stage of consciousness peculiar to a particular being determines the manner in which he is able to appreciate the Supreme. Accordingly creeds are relative to the stage of social development. Truly great teachers recognize this; Jesus justified the Law of Moses. The highest types of beings, the Buddhas, the Prophets, the Messiah, are veritable incarnations of God, and appear whenever a downward materialistic tendency dominates life. But these differ only in degree from the lower forms; the Hindu will accept the essentials of Christianity as soon as the Christian will admit that men may be saved otherwise than through the mediatorship of Jesus. The aim of life is not happiness, but the accomplishment of a purpose, the realization of the Spirit within; a difficult and slow task which may not be effected in one life span. Progress is governed by the law of Karma, or moral causation, for God is not outside man but is an organic part of his nature. Every act is historic of the past and is prophetic of the future. The manner in</page><page sequence="5">112 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIL which the individaul attacks the problem of life varies as to what mental aspect is dominant, but all elements of consciousness are necessary to the perfect being. Knowledge reveals truth, right desire instills love and right action molds life. True wisdom, which is intuitive, though supported by reason, is the great purifier of life. It is the painful slowness of the cognitive process that gives rise to the multiplicity of creeds and in the lower forms to superstition. Recognizing this the Hindus, in their puranas, have dressed truth in fable for the safety of the weak of mind, and have accepted all forms of worship as inevitable and adequate, if the true purpose is realized, until higher may supersede without disrup- tion. It is due to this broadmindedness that the Aryan people have been so successful in the assimilation of the natives of India. The ethical ideal is a life of purity, love and renunciation. But conscious of the breach between human nature and the ideal, the Hindu has devised a code of discipline, the dharma, to train the individual in right conduct. Ethical principles are not subjectively imposed by the conscience nor objectively forced, but are the living spirit of the people, a growing process in response to the development of society and supported by the general conscience. The caste rules do not imply rights but responsibilities, duties, the self- realization of the individual. For the development of the individual lies in the concentration of his personality at a particular point in society. The aim of the Hindu dharma is to make all men Brahmins, to effect a perfect society where all men are moved by love to the extinction of all hate and the resistance of evil by force. But the imperfection of man necessitates the graduated scheme in the social organization. Retalia- tion is deep-rooted in human nature so it is conceded to the militant class to use force where submission to evil is wrong and resistance by love is impossible. Thus it becomes a duty and an opportunity for self- realization. " Thou shalt not slay" either man or animal, however, is the goal to be sought, the only law worthy of man. Hinduism is a process, not a result; a broad-minded philosophical outlook on life. ORVAL PERRY. La Philosophie d'O. Hamelin. D. PARODI. Rev. de Met., XXIX, 2, pp. I77-I97. Hamelin's Ple'ments Principaux de la Representation presents a difficult and abstruse doctrine, but it is undoubtedly a work of rare metaphysical power and a monument of modern French thought. A disciple of Renou- vler, Hamelin always reflects the influence of the master. His philosophy is an unqualified rationalism, purified by that element of fideisme so im- portant in neo-criticism,-it is a philosophy of the understanding (not intuition), and of liberty. But liberty, for Hamelin, has definite limits. Nothing exists or is conceivable apart from thought. Fundamentally, subectivism cannot be distinguished from objectivism, or, in other words,</page><page sequence="6">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. I 13 the two terms are reconciled in idealism. We must find the common conditions of thought and of existence. Everything is intelligible both in the products of thought and in thought itself. The system of thought is the system of the world. How is it constituted? Hamelin's problem was to find a principle of union which at the same time was a principle of distinction and of originality,-a source of intelligibility, of fecundity, and of infinitely varied production. This principle Hamelin finds (fol- lowing Hegel) in correlation. For him, correlation is the first fact of knowledge and the supreme law of being. The world is a hierarchy of relations (rapports). There can be no concept of being without its op- posite, non-being, and from-this it appears that the notion of relation is more fundamental than the notion of being itself. Just as relation is the synthesis of being and not-being, it in turn creates a new antithesis, number, reconciled in the synthesis time. Similarly, we have the follow- ing triads: time, space, movement; movement, quality, change; change, specification, causality. From causality arises the antithesis, finality. These unite in a final synthesis, the notion of a whole, independent, self- sufficient, free and autonomous-able to choose among possibles, in order to assure its own preservation and development. It is, therefore, con- scious. "Ce qui explique la conscience c'est le besoin de choisir." This whole Hamelin calls the systeme agissante.' Consciousness is the pin- nacle of the entire system, inseparable from liberty, and is the necessary condition of liberty. Although liberty is a necessary element of the system, it is subordinate, for the system as a whole is essentially rational and determined intelligence. L. S. CRAWFORD. Ethics, Morality, and Metaphysical Assumptions. Louis ARNAUD REID. The Monist, XXXII, 4 pp. 48I-50I. If we assume that ethics and metaphysics are distinct disciplines four different relations can exist between them. Ethics may be a base for metaphysics, or be independent of it, or be based on metaphysics, or both may be mutually dependent and so overlap. The first relation will not be discussed fully. It is found exemplified in Sorley's Gifford Lectures, Moral Values and the Idea of God and in Kant's philosophy. But even in the latter, God freedom and immortality as practical postulates follow on Kant's examination and criticism of metaphysics. From different standpoints, the independence of ethics and metaphysics is urged by Ber- trand Russell, MacIver, Reid, Sidgwick and intuitionalists generally. Such attempts are subjectivist in tendency and fail to satisfy a consistent, rational, cosmic and eternal standard. Against the third relation it has been argued that there can be no transition between the 'ought' and the 'is.' This is disproved by those cases in which a moral state is an ac- tuality and when a duty depends on a fact. Moreover, only when meta-</page><page sequence="7">I 14 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXII. physics is taken in the mechanical sense of Decartes and Spinoza or in the naturalistic sense of Spencer and Stephen is it true that metaphysics is not normative or ethical. In fact, ethics and metaphysics have judg- ments of value in common. But these must not be exclusively ethical, because a metaphyisic must satisfy all parts of our nature, aesthetic and logical as well as ethical. Otherwise our view of the universe remains un- duly anthropomorphic. Since I adopt the grounding of ethics in metaphysics three questions are involved: What is my attitude to the Universe? What does that pre- suppose? How am I affected in character and conduct thereby? The universe is at least a good universe. But the term 'good' does not refer to animal satisfaction but to that experience in contemplative vein or as in a flash. "It is a glimpse of the universal through the particular, it is what men of religion have described as a vision of the ineffable in things of sense, and indeed it is religious experience of a kind, though it does not necessarily involve any formal theological creeds. It may be aroused by contact with natural objects, by intercourse with fellow human beings, humble or great, by joy in work, by creation, by discovery and by ad- venture, by things of the mind and by things of the body, by painting, music, poetry or any of the arts, by, in fact, any human experience what- ever short of what is gross or hideous or immoral. ... This may be re- vealed in human moral goodness or in contemplation of beauty in art or in nature but is not exactly either. It seems to be intrinsic value itself." Stich a revelation has a definite affective tone, and must definitely alter our life and outlook. " In spite of the existence of pain and the apparently non-moral, and even the anti-moral character of the evolutionary process in nature . . . the felt knowledge, even through pain, that Value is in the world can be a force revitalizing the whole texture of our moral life, the full realization of the importance of which must certainly, in its turn, most powerfully affect moral theory." WOOLF COHEN. Natural Piety. S. ALEXANDER. The Hibbert Journal,' XX, 4, pp. 609-62i. Natural piety is here taken to mean "the habit of knowing when to stop in asking questions of nature." It is the recognition that there are in nature ultimate mysteries which we should simply accept and not try to explain. Just as in purely human affairs there arise new creations, e.g., the distinctive style of Shakespeare, the democracy subsequent to the French Revolution, the conception of morality introduced by Jesus, which can be understood but not explained, so also in nature there are critical changes of quality, new syntheses, which are fundamentally inexplicable. We can note the conditions out of which these new qualities arise but we cannot tell why they should assume these qualities. We can simply accept them; and such acceptance is natural piety. But these new qualities</page><page sequence="8">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. II5 are not mere mechanical resultants of their lower conditions. Life, for ex- ample, is resoluble without remainder into physico-chemical processes; but these separate processes do not constitute life. It is important to recognize that besides elements there is the form of their combination, which form is as much a reality as the elements and gives them their sig- nificance. No appeal is needed to a vital force or even an elan vital. One has simply to note the emergence of the new quality of life and try to describe what is involved in its conditions. Life is continuous with chemical, physical, and mechanical action, but this continuity does not mean that the material vehicle of continuity is carried over into life. The general characters of all existence are carried over from the lower to the higher-viz., space, time, intensity, et cetera. Hence to make a sharp distinction between life and mechanism is to be guilty of exaggeration if not of confusion. One needs to take note of their differences after having noted the fundamental continuity. Mechanism is distinguished by routine; life, by fine adjustments to varying conditions. But material action is not so much that from which vital action diverges, as a first ap- proximation towards vital. A single principle is manifest in the transition from matter to life. The emergent qualities, however, are unpredictable. They can only be accepted, not accounted for. They forever remain mys- teries,-"a part of the mystery which encompasses us and which we have no right to ask to penetrate." The object of science is to discover the simpler conditions to which they are related. "The reverent temper which accepts them is the mood of natural piety." J. H. GRIFFITHS. La notion d'objet et l'evolution de la physique contemporaine. A. REY, Rev. Ph., XLVII, 9-i2, Pp. 20dI-242. From the point of view of objectivity modern physical science seems to be re-adopting as fundamental. the principles of Descartes, i.e., the motion of (conceptual) particles. Thus the principle of the degradation of energy, long a support for metaphysical speculation as to the end of the world, was based on an illusion of the senses, and is completely dissipated by the kinetic theory of gases. Secondly, the electron is simply a con- ceptual support for a group of objective, measurable relations. Thirdly, Planck's quantum theory is another step in the direction of atomic discon- tinuity, or 'atomicity of action.' Lastly, the theory of relativity promises to unite these various principles into one system, based entirely upon relationships inherent in the very nature of the conceptual object itself. In sum, the universe of relativity as defined by Cartesian co-ordinates, is one in which measurement is not restricted by any subjective idiosyn- crasies of the observer; the variations revealed in physical measurements belong wholly to the object measured. The theories of Weyl and Edding-</page><page sequence="9">i i6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXII. ton, by reconciling the present discrepancies between the quantum theory and the Einstein theory, lead to a still further unification and hence to a more complete objectivity. H. R. SMART. Are History and Science Different Kinds of Knowledge? A Symposium by R. G. COLLINGWOOD, A. E. TAYLOR, and F. C. S. SCHILLER. Mind, XXXI, I24, PP. 443-466. I, By R. G. Collingwood. From the point of view of logic must a dis- tinction be drawn between the two kinds of knowledge called respectively His- tory and Science? History has been distinguished from Science traditionally by the statement that it is knowledge of the particular, whereas science is knowledge of the universal. This paper attempts to show that the dis- tinction is illusory. It implies an untenable metaphysical dualism which sets up two kinds of entity, an abstract particular and an abstract uni- versal. It has tended at different times to degrade now one, now the other, of these two disciplines, with the present tendency towards degrad- ing science into a false form of knowledge and towards finding the true form in history. The common assumption that the distinctive mark of the scientist is generalization, is a mistaken one. Rather the true scientist's activity may be described alternatively as the understanding of sense-data by concepts, or the realizing of concepts in sensation. The scientist's aim, then, is to know the individual, not the abtsract particular.. Thus the analysis of science in epistemological terms is identical with the analysis of history. The fancied distinctions between the two are the result of comparing a view of science as an actual process of thought with history as a dead, finished article. II, By A. E. Taylor. History and science are different. Pure science never attempts to affirm anything but a formal logical implication between a proposition called a demonstrated proposition and a group of other propositions called premises for the conclusion; pure history, however, always tries to affirm the truth of a categorical proposition. Here, and not in the distinction between universal and individual, lies the root of the difficulty. Science is interested in viewing its subject-matter sub specie eternitatis. History is interested in the temporal; if it is not, it de- generates into politics and sociology. Our interest in men and ages of the past which have shaped our own destiny is not an interest in social types, but is rather like our interest in our personal friends and foes. III, By F. C. S. Schiller. Obviously, the question implies that his- tory and science cannot be wholly different. We must first discover why they become objects of human interest and to what ends they minister. The essential characteristics of science are prediction and control. For this, we must know the real as it is, as it will be, and as it has been. We</page><page sequence="10">No. '.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 117 ask therefore-how has the actual come to be as it is? This is the essential question for history. Science can calculate the past only with the aid of history. The two are of necessity co-operative. But every scientific truth hopes also to have a future. It is not a timeless formula, an eternal truth apart from experience. Its time relation is left blank only in order that the law may be applied at any time. Professor Taylor's 'pure' science is a pure fiction. He finds history and science irreconcilable as pure ab- stractions; he does not appear to deny the actual collaboration of actual science and actual history. But history and science do differ somewhat. The historian can haye no verification of his work except as his allega- tions are not grossly improbable. On the other hand, in science verifica- tion is possible through experiment, but no amount of verification suffices, even here, to prove a law absolutely true. The truth of both history and science is pragmatic, established in the same way as the rest of our knowl- edge. There are differences in the working of our method in history and science, but these are due to the materials dealt with. In the end the two stand and fall together. EDGAR H. HENDERSON.</page></plain_text>
