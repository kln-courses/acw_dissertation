<plain_text><page sequence="1">Milton's Imagery and the Visual Arts: Iconographic Tradition in the Epic Poems Roland Mushat Frye/Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1978. Pp. xxvi+408 + 269 plates. The study of Milton and the visual arts bifurcates into the usual "before" and "after" categories, and in the past decade the afters have flourished. Milton's influence upon English art has been studied at book length, and the examination of Miltonic illustration as a form of interpretation and criticism has taken on the proportions of a minor industry. Oddly, since it would seem a necessary founda- tion to the work of the afters, the impact of the visual arts upon Milton's poetry has been a subject largely neglected. There have been several attempts, with no more than mixed success, to claim Milton as a "baroque" stylist; but, as for a subject-matter approach, only J. B. Trapp's valuable essay on "The Iconography of the Fall" deserves mention.' Frye's large book, a Renaissance folio in size and heft, goes a long way toward redressing that imbalance. Handsomely produced and lavishly illustrated (with 269 plates, eight of them in color), it undoubtedly will be recognized as a standard authority. Frye has devoted a quarter-century's reflection and a decade's active re- search to his subject. This span of time will account for certain emphases; a younger scholar, farther from the shadow of T. S. Eliot, might have disregarded the old assertions that Milton lacks a visual imagination as self-evidently wrong. It may be well, however, to have the question thoroughly and conclusively re- viewed. Without question, Frye's time has been spent purposively. The gains are evident, particularly in the encyclopedic knowledge of two disciplines, in the massive bibliography, and in the writing, which evinces both ease and conviction. The express purpose of Frye's endeavor is "to recover the vocabulary of visual images which Milton and his readers may reasonably be expected to have known" (p. 4). He sets out to do so tacitly following Milton's own epic organiza- tion: first the demonic world, from the rebellion and expulsion to demonic trans- 1/See C. A.

Frye's strategy throughout is to establish the conventions of visual representation for a particular subject-the images that would have been common knowledge shared by Milton and his contemporary audience-thereby permitting him to determine whether Milton exploited the accepted visual con- vention, opted to follow a variant tradition, reverted to an earlier type of repre- sentation more suitable to his purposes, or simply diverged entirely from visual conventions. While Frye is alert to the special implications of paintings, sculpture, en- gravings, tapestries, and church windows that Milton might actually have seen, wisely he does not pursue one-to-one correspondences. In a few instances- Beccafumi's Michael and the Fallen Angels, Naccherino's carving of Adam, Eve and Satan, Raphael's God Creating the Animals, and Salviati's The Fall-Frye feels that he has recovered a sufficiently singular parallel in a detail or concept to postulate direct influence upon Milton; but he recognizes that the sounder case for deep influence will be based upon popular iconography rather than upon such happy accidents. By and large, I find Frye's demonstrations of divergence from precedent in the visual arts more persuasive and instructive than his arguments for close similarities. His belief that Diirer's engraving of Adam and Eve in The Fall is "the closest single artistic counterpart" to Milton's conception "of the majesty and dignity of unfallen man" (p. 270) is simply one man's opinion. Similarly, his high regard for the Medici tapestries ("Again and again the visual details of these tapestries accord most strikingly with those of Paradise Lost" [p. 108]) seems vitiated because it ignores the dominant figure of a resolutely anthropomorphic God-reminiscent of Santa Claus in a brocade dressing gown-that is strikingly at odds with Milton's purely symbolic visual presentation of the Father. Frye's account of the traditional demonic world, however, serves to heighten our awareness of how sharply, and deliberately, Milton was willing to break with prevailing visual conventions. The exclusion of physical torture from hell and the pastimes of the fallen angels and the decision to emphasize the spiritual rather than the physical deformity of Satan and his followers are, perhaps, the most significant instances. While, as Frye observes, the popular image of a grotesquely ugly fiend was far too simple for the conceptual scheme of Paradise Lost, no doubt Milton expected the personal attractiveness and even tragic dignity which he initially allows Satan to be refracted by the reader's awareness of the popular image. The loss of the visual vocabulary is concomitant with the cultural seculari- zation that has resulted in the occasional misinterpretation of Satan's role in the epic. Conversely, for a point upon which Milton straightforwardly exploits a satanic pictorial tradition, Frye demonstrates the strong visual precedent for Sa- tan's fall at the climax of the third wilderness temptation, an action in Paradise Regained for which there is no literary authority. The heavenly world, not surprisingly, proves more intractable than the de- monic to Frye's approach. Both the Godhead and its local habitation are, pre- cisely, ineffable; and Milton, observing the precedent of the Bible and its com- mentators, is orthodox in creating descriptions the primary function of which is to</page><page sequence="3">86 Modern Philology (August 1980) convey their indescribability.2 In consequence, while Frye has local suc- cesses-for example, on the tradition of angelic armor and on the golden compasses-in the main, visual representation of the divine verges upon the idolatry which the Protestant in Milton condemned and the poet circumvented. Unlike the seemingly conscious playing against the conventional image of Satan, the pictorial images of heaven, the Father, and the Son which Frye adduces simply do not appear relevant to Milton's poems. Paradise Regained is a case in point, since physical representation of the incarnate Son would have been doc- trinally permissible. But, as Frye admits, "Whether he is tall or short, massive or lean, blond or brunet, bearded or clean shaven, we simply do not learn from Milton" (p. 341). My caveat about divine imagery may suggest that most readers will not go as far as does Frye in concluding that the primary descriptions of the two epics "were largely derived from the traditions of sacred art" (p. 347). There are times in Frye's exposition when one could wish for greater awareness that the visual was only one of several traditions affecting Milton's imaginative choices in any given episode. This, however, is an enthusiast's failing, the more forgivable in that the classicists, theologians, hexameronists, historians of ideas, and others have had more than their day in court. More nagging problems are the tendencies throughout to respond to poetic descriptions too literally and to get too immersed in specific detail. Milton's sev- eral references to the Father "smiling" motivated a scrutiny of godly expressions, unavailingly: "There is no counterpart anywhere in art to Milton's smiling and laughing Deity" (p. 153). But the "laughter" and "derision" with which God responds to Satan's plotting take their point from Ps. 2:4 (which Milton translated) and do not function visually. A more endearing, but no more rewarding, quest for detail results in tracking Adam's "parted forelock" to portraits of Oliver Cromwell and John Milton. Granted, the focusing upon detail is an important means of preventing the paragone from dissolving into mere impressionism. It can also descend to the trivial, and it can lose sight of differences in the descriptive media. Attacks upon Milton's oxymoronic "vegetable gold" trigger a veritable barrage of golden fruits, flowers, and vegetables, and a satisfied conclusion: "If an examination of [the visual] evidence shows that 'vegetable gold' is an accurate or even widely accepted description of what is seen in nature, and if it is repeatedly associated with pictorial renderings of the fruit in Eden-then not only the original objections to Milton's description but also the replies in his defense become irrelevant" (p. 252). Frye's refutation smacks of an attitude common in creative- writing classes-"But that's just the way it happened!"-to which one must reply that fact does not guarantee effective fiction and urge the reading of Sidney's Defence for a grasp of the differences. Both critics and defenders of Milton's phrase are engaged with questions of semantic and poetic value; and they might well unite in finding Frye's factual "evidence" irrelevant. Milton's Imagery and the Visual Arts is the furthest thing from a tedious compilation of note cards. Every reader will have his own arguments with the book, inescapably be instructed by it, and be impressed not only by Frye's com- mand of his subject but also by the liveliness of his ideas. I am not persuaded, for 2/As Michael Murrin has argued persuasively in this journal.

But the association of the banquet which Satan sets before Christ in the wilderness with vanitas still-life paintings seems exactly right. Raymond B.
