<plain_text><page sequence="1">Peter Fritzeil Reading the Man of Sand County An Essay on A Sand County Almanac Published posthumously in 1 949, A Sand County Almanac by Aldo Leopold is widely cited as one of the most influential nature books ever published. Leopold's chapter entitled " The Land Ethic" largely set the philosophical foundation for what we now know as the conservation movement Part memoir, part record, part rumination, the book introduced the science of ecology into the social realm. -Ed. There are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot These essays are the delights and dilemmas of one who cannot Aldo Leopold, "Foreword" to A Sand County Almanac (vii y In reading the man of Sand County, as in writing about his figures of speech and thought, you must be careful not to take your "wild things" too much for granted. You must be careful not to assume, or not to assume too much, that your "wild things" are somehow out there to be known and experienced, if only you could free yourself from the here and now, if only you could free yourself from the present gaggle, so to speak - what you might think of as these man-made, artificial, and all-too-civilized considerations. In reading the man of Sand County, you must be careful not to assume too readily that your wild things are out there in some "wildlife management area" or some legis- latively circumscribed "Wilderness Area" or some "Nature Center," where things are natural (as they somehow are not here?). In reading the man of Sand County, you must be careful not to allow your popular, knee-jerk, public-televi- sion, "environmental" mind to get the better of you. You must be careful not to be too unconscious in your "en- vironmental consciousness," or in your thoughts of how liberating it would be to get out into nature for a while, to get away from it all and be free. You know the kind of unconscious consciousness the man of Sand County is trying to suggest, the kind of mind, if that is what it is, which doesn't register even a smile when it hears that "Nature is brought to you by Mobil" or, more recently, by the Park Foundation, Canon, Ford, and TIAA- 76 Fritzell CREF - and, of course, by "viewers like you." You know the kind of mind that registers no sense of incongruity when it reads that "we have lost touch with nature" - or worse, that we are somehow alienated from nature. Just where might such a mind otherwise find itself, do you think? In reading the man of Sand County, you must stay on your mental and perceptual toes, so to speak, and not let your mind wander too far. You must not skip the word dilemmas, and you must not misinterpret the word delights, as if it referred only, or even mainly, to the "delightful" experience of seeing or recalling a scurrying meadow mouse on a late January day. Perhaps, in fact, it will pay to consider the word essays - from the Old French essai, meaning a trial, a test - an attempt, an endeavor - a first tentative attempt at learning - an attempt to accomplish or perform (as a deed or task) - as a verb, to make an attempt; to under- take, or try to do. So that these essays, so understood, these written attempts, are the delights and dilemmas of one who cannot live without wild things, as he cannot live without essays, as no creature reading this sentence can live without wild things, however momentarily, however unknowingly. Like winds and sunsets, wild things were taken for granted until progress began to do away with them. Now we face the question whether a still higher 'standard of living' is worth its cost in things natural, wild, and free (vii). In reading the man of Sand County, you must be careful not to take too much for granted your progress and your "standard of living." But you must be careful as well not to take too much for granted your things natural, wild, and free. In fact, you must be careful not to take on faith - or not too much on faith - even your winds and sunsets. You must be careful, because in Sand County words often</page><page sequence="2">mean both what you rather habitually and unconsciously take them to mean, and something else additional, often something opposite and oppositional. You must be care- ful, because the man of Sand County is a man of two voices, at least - if not even three or four: For us of the minority, the opportunity to see geese is more important than television, and the chance to find a pasque-flower is a right as inalienable as free speech (vii). You must be careful, because the man of Sand County not only aligns himself with the apparent minority which prefers seeing geese to watching television, but he also aligns himself with an even smaller minority, the minority (of which he very much hopes you may become one, and thus participate in making it an overwhelming majority) of those who can see and understand their "inalienable rights" for what they are, finally - for what they are when they are viewed as functions of nitrate cycles, food-chains, and feedback loops. So that, even as the man of Sand County aligns himself with those who prefer watching geese to watching televi- sion, he also aligns himself with those who can see and ap- preciate their declarations of independence and their "free speech" - and, yes, even their Sand County Almanac's - as fundamentally and finally akin to birdsong and whalesong, to the territorial markings and howlings of wolves, to the buglings of cranes and the callings of geese, or to what you call geese. To make things worse, so to speak (You've only gotten to the second paragraph of the "Foreword," after all, and you're not through with it yet.), you must be even more careful in reading the man of Sand County - because, even as the man appeals to your understanding of that appar- ently clear minority which prefers watching geese to watch- ing television, even as he seems clearly to take his stand with that minority, he does so in the terms of the knee-jerk majority. He calls upon your conventional, knee-jerk, and very-much-American majority-understanding of the differ- ences between nature and culture, geese and television, natural and man-made, free and not-free, wild things and progress, pasque-flower and the American Bill of Rights. And he thus draws conventional, knee-jerk distinctions be- tween the very kinds of things he is otherwise suggesting are not nearly, or finally, so distinct as you habitually - and, thus, rather naturally - think they are. By now you are almost certainly asking "Why?" or, "So what's his point?" Why does the man of Sand County shift or alternate and interweave these voices, these opposed and even contradictory views of your geese and your televi- sion, your nature and your culture, your animal and your human? - why?, because he knows, as every good ecologist knows, that these distinctions - as between nature and cul- ture, or wild and civilized, or hemoglobin and chlorophyll, or even between geese and pasque-flower - are, finally, neither more nor less than distinctions drawn by your part of what you call your species, as you, like other organ- isms, seek some short-lived semblance of freedom from want and fear - because he knows that these distinctions, which you rather instinctively draw, are finally quite kin to the distinctions your geese make, and learn to make, and continue to try to make, between grasses rich in nutrients and those which are not, or between hominids who are, as we say, hunting geese, and hominids who are playing golf or appreciating nature (and who, thus, represent no immediate threat, perhaps) - because the man of Sand County knows that, finally, your conventional, knee-jerk dis- tinctions between healthy and unhealthy, between what is the case and what ought to be the case, are finally nothing more or less than devices which you use in your attempts to gain some brief semblance of control. So why does the man of Sand County alternate and inter- weave these opposed and contradictory views of his own kind and other kinds, of his own inscriptions and the mark- ings or callings of others? - because he knows, among other things, that no speech and no thing (no goose, no an- thropoid, no pasque-flower) is free, and no right inalienable - because he knows, in other words, that he is not free - but because he also knows that it is natural, and even nec- essary, for his kind and your kind, and doubtless all other kinds, to seek freedom - because he knows that you and he have little choice but to attempt, however pathetically, to distinguish that which is free from that which is not-free, that which is nutritious from that which is not, that which is human from that which is not, that which is useful or ac- curate from that which is not, that which is male from that which is female - because, however pathetic your attempts may be in the final analysis, your species and your kind, will soon be in fairly deep trouble if you do not make these distinctions regularly and effectively-because he knows, in other words, that these distinctions are, at once, artificial and natural, as all artifice is natural, as a spider's web is artificial and natural, as an architect's designs are likewise, as whalesong and calculus are artificial and natural - si- multaneously, as it were. You must be careful, then, in reading the man of Sand County - or better, perhaps, in attempting to read him - because, having appealed to your knee-jerk understand- ing that wild things are out there, free and distinct from televisions, books, and words - or having appealed to your conventional understanding that wild things were out there in the beginning, and that they are still out there to be found and appreciated, though in diminishing numbers and quality - he will, in the very next sentence, shift his Fritzell 77</page><page sequence="3">point of view rather radically - and suggest, at least, that wild things were not out there in the beginning at all, that they only came to be as wild things when progress made it possible for them to be known as wild things. These wild things, the man of Sand County now openly admits, had little human value until mechanization assured us of a good breakfast , and until science disclosed the drama of where they come from and how they live (vii). So that it now looks as if wild things are direct, if not necessary, func- tions of the very progress which the man of Sand County otherwise seems to be urging you to query, and to query seriously. So that it now seems as if the very progress which is destroying or limiting your opportunities to expe- rience wild things, is the very process that made possible those opportunities in the first place, that were it not for scientific progress, there would be no wild things to be valued or devalued. You must try to stay alert, so that you don't get caught napping - or worse, hibernating. So that when you read in "January," (or is it now June?) that - Each year, after the midwinter blizzards, there comes a night of thaw when the tinkle of dripping water is heard in the land - you must be careful not to take your midwinter blizzards or your night of thaw or the tinkle of your dripping water too metaphori- cally; and you must be prepared to consider quite literally the notion that this tinkle is heard in the land, here and now-because, if you are not so prepared, you will miss an important part of the strange stirrings this tinkle brings, not only to creatures abed for the night, but to some who have been asleep for the winter (3) - and perhaps even to others who may still be asleep. In reading the man of Sand County, you must be aware of your rather natural disposition to mental hibernation, so as not to get caught being as essentially unconscious as the apparently hibernating skunk who, curled up in his deep den, uncurls himself and ventures forth to prowl the wet world, dragging his belly in the snow. You must try to wake up from your preferred disposition to sleep in your mental den. You must be up to uncurling yourself and venturing forth to prowl, to follow the track of this skunk, the track that is likely to display an indifference to mundane affairs , an indif- ference uncommon at other seasons. In your mind's eye, at least, you must follow this track, this track that leads straight across-country, as if its maker had hitched his wagon to a star and dropped the reins. You must follow this track apparently indifferent to mundane affairs, though you must not yourself be too indifferent to these mundane affairs, or you'll miss the only slightly veiled analogy - the essential kinship, perhaps - between yourself as reading organism and the man of Sand County, if not also the skunk: I fol- 78 Fritzell low, curious to deduce his state of mind and appetite, and destination, if any (3). You must not miss the analogy and the affinity, or you will you lose track, as we say - or run the risk of losing track, the risk of losing track of where and what you are (ecologi- cally, as you might say); and you will miss the sense that January observation can be almost as simple and peaceful as snow , and almost as continuous as cold (4). Unless you stay on your ecological and evolutionary toes, unless you a keep an eye on where you are and what you're doing, you will miss a good deal, if not all, of the things that may be said to be revealed by this January thaw - by now you might even be inclined to say this meltdown - the rather revealing northern exposure that occurs when, rather abruptly - A meadow mouse, startled by my approach, darts damply across the skunk track. Why is he abroad in daylight? Probably because he feels grieved about the thaw. Today his maze of secret tunnels, laboriously chewed through the matted grass under the snow, are tunnels no more, but only paths exposed to public view and ridicule. In- deed the thawing sun has mocked the basic premises of the microti ne economic system! The mouse is a sober citizen who knows that grass grows in order that mice may store it as underground haystacks, and that snow falls in order that mice may build subways from stack to stack: supply, demand, and transport all neatly organized. To the mouse, snow means freedom from want and fear (4). Oh, it's easy enough to see that the organized, microtine, economic systems of mice (family name, Muridae; sub- family Microtinae, genus Microtus) have been exposed by this January thaw; and it's almost as easy to see that the organized, microtine, economic systems of humankind have likewise been exposed. What's not so easy to see, apparently, unless you keep your ecological mind's eye open, is that all the other organized, microtine systems of organisms are also being exposed - all of them - including the one which the man of Sand County is here trying to put together to expose all those others, and which you likewise are trying to put together, whether you know it or not. What's being exposed here - by the thawing sun? - is not simply or only the attempted economics of what we call the meadow mouse, nor simply or only the economic reasoning and systems of humankind, but any and all microtine systems under the sun, which one organism or another, one species or another, one part of one species or another, attempts to organize and sustain in order to achieve some semblance of freedom from want and fear. What's being exposed here are not simply the efforts or ex- periments of meadow mice and economic man, but all the organizing efforts of all the organisms, and all the kinds of</page><page sequence="4">organisms, including the efforts of ecologists, mathemati- cians, and philosophers of value, and including as well the efforts of any writing or reading organism. Reading, after all, like writing and speaking - like music theory and land- scape architecture, like the systematic collection of data and regression analysis - is a matter of trying to attain some momentary freedom from want and fear. So that the man of Sand County covers his own tracks, as it were. He acknowledges the final affinity between what he is trying to do as writer and what the meadow mouse is trying to do, as the economists and ethicists are trying to do, as likewise the architects, as likewise the herbs and shrubs. To the mouse, snow means freedom from want and fear - for a short time, perhaps. To the rough-legged hawk, an absence of snow, means freedom from want and fear - for a short time, perhaps (4). To the moose, a good year's growth of what you call short aspen, birch, balsam, dogwood, water lilies - sunny days and moderate tempera- tures - an insulating blanket of snow in winter, but not too much - not too many snowshoe hares or, alternatively, a good number of visiting snowy owls - not too many wolves or human beings - no parasites on the brain - mean free- dom from want and fear - for a brief time, perhaps. And what means freedom from want and fear, however mo- mentarily, to the man of Sand County? In the first part of his essays (very roughly, the first half), the opportunity to recall or imagine and think upon many, but by no means all, of the elements, processes, and relationships of what you might call a local ecosystem - including, especially, his own actions and functions in that system - to reflect upon the things that may be revealed by following a skunk's track, or the cutting of a good oak, or the life of one par- ticular banded chickadee. Each of these reflections - and as well the careful, crafting labor that goes into creating them - means for the man of Sand County some brief semblance of freedom from want and fear. In each of them, he finds and takes some solace - some content and, therefore, some contentment - includ- ing even the kind of contentment that irony and paradox may provide, if only for a short time. He takes and finds pleasure in creating little exemplary parables of his life in Sand County, little parabolic stories, that, in turn, create dilemmas of a kind, but dilemmas that are as often reas- suring as they are troubling. Most, if not all, of these parabolic dilemmas contain the seeds of their own logical or biological destruction, you might say. It's kind of like there's something that doesn't love a wall, that wants it down, and something else that's bound and determined to put it together, and to try to keep it together, as long as it possibly can. And so it goes with the man of Sand County - even as his mind reaches out from the parabolic details of that local ecosystem to geographically and historically more expansive reflections on Wisconsin, Illinois, and Iowa - Arizona and New Mexico - the quail of Chihuahua and Sonora, the cheat grass of Oregon and Utah - the rails, wrens, mink, and grebes of Manitoba marshes. In "Wisconsin," you find him saying: Thus always does his- tory, whether of marsh or market place, end In paradox. The ultimate value in these marshes is wildness, and the crane is wildness incarnate. But all conservation of wildness is self- defeating, for to cherish we must see and fondle, and when enough have seen and fondled, there is no wilderness left to cherish (101). When he gets to recalling Arizona and New Mexico, you find him declaring that, It must be poor life that achieves freedom from want and fear (126); and you sense his wit, perhaps, as you recognize that the life that achieves freedom from want and fear is not poor life, but non-life - the ultimate peace, perhaps, that comes to each of us in our time. Just as you must be careful in reading this man's cranes and mountains, so you must be careful in reading his Mani- toba grebes: A sense of history should be the most precious gift of science and the arts, but I suspect that the grebe, who has neither, knows more history than we do (161). You must be careful not to take your knee-jerk "anthropomorphisms" too much for granted, because the man of Sand County knows and depends upon your habits of branding as an- thropomorphic his grebes and his mountains, his meadow mice and his wolves; but the man of Sand County also knows that all human endeavor is anthropomorphic, more or less by definition - even (or, perhaps, especially) those human endeavors in which humans claim to escape their anthropomorphism. With a smile, perhaps, he wishes them luck. So what means freedom from want and fear for the man of Sand County? It means keeping an eye on himself and his needs or inclinations, insofar as he possibly can. It means rather constantly juxtaposing and interweaving two (or is it three?) conflicting and interdependent views of what you sometimes call nature, of human and non-human, of eco- logical systems and evolution, of culture and nature. A part of you, at this point, is doubtless saying or thinking something like, "well what's the solution?" or "which is it?" - "It's one or the other; it can't be both." "It's either A or not-A." Either this man is a creature capable of reason, or he's not. Either wild things are out there, or they're not. Either the mouse and the mountains are metaphors, or Fritzell 79</page><page sequence="5">they're not. Either the biotic pyramid is a mental image, or it tells, in fact, how things are out there and in here. Either the difference between pines and birches is in the trees, or it's not. Either evolution is a theory and, hence, an expression of human need, or it's not. Either ecologists are gathering true, factual knowledge of the ways things are, or they are doing nothing more than playing their roles in an ecosystem. Either humans can comprehend evolu- tion, or what they call their comprehensions of evolution are nothing more than attempted adaptations of evolving anthropoids. Either the uncertainty principle is a certain- sure proposition, or it's not. Either it's A or it's not-A. Well it isn't. It's not either A or not-A - not for, and not with, the man of Sand County. It's both-and - both A and not-A - or, more accurately, perhaps, both "Either-Or" and "Both-And" - virtually all of the time, or for as much time he has. "But how can he do it?," you ask. How can he live in such a condition, with such a divided state of mind? How can he develop and assert the essential rightness of the land- ethic - A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise (225) - which seems clearly to be his solution to the dilemma, his final word, his creed, his eco- logical mantra - if he really believes (or if he also believes) that all history consists of successive excursions from a single starting point, to which man returns again and again to orga- nize yet another search for a durable scale of values" (200)? How can he say in such an unqualified way, that [a] thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community (225), if he also knows that no biotic community has anything like a dependable integrity, that no biotic community is stable, but always shifting, changing, varying - and if he also knows that beauty and stability are in the eye of the beholder, so to speak - that beauty and stability for a meadow mouse are quite different from beauty and stability for a rough-legged hawk, and that beauty and stability for each of them are quite different, in turn, from what they are for himself, if, for no other reason, than that he can see a certain beauty, and even some integrity and stability, in the rough- legged hawk which drops like a feathered bomb into the marsh to catch and eat some worried mouse-engineer who could not wait until night to inspect the damage to his well-ordered world (4), and which mouse, he's rather certain-sure, does not much appreciate the beauty or stability in the ravishments of the hawk - and who (the man of Sand County, now) also knows, as he does, that beauty and integrity and stability for himself are quite different from what they are for Mr. Babbitt, or for the people of Chihuahua and Sonora? 80 Fritzell How can he so knowingly contradict himself? How can he say that an ethic, ecologically, is a limitation on freedom of ac- tion in the struggle for existence (202), if he also knows that there are no free actions in the struggle for existence, and never have been - and more, if he also knows, as he does, that any change or development in ethics or science is fi- nally neither more nor less than a change in the means or devices that he and others may use in attempting to adapt to the conditions in which they struggle to exist? How can he say that a land ethic affirms the right of soils and waters, plants and animals, to continued existence (204) - if he also believes and knows, as he does, that no plant and no animal, and no species of plant or animal, and no community of plants and animals and soils and waters, has anything thing like a right to continued exis- tence - and worse, perhaps, if he also knows, as he does, that the continued existence of the evolving whole, even its healthy existence, depends upon the mutation and even the extinction of numbers (and whole classes) of its pres- ent members? How can he say logically that man is, in fact , only a member of a biotic team (205), one of thousands of accretions to the height and complexity of the [biotic] pyramid (216), noth- ing more or less than a plain member and citizen of the evolving land-community, part and parcel of evolution and evolutionary change - and then say, in what is virtually his next breath, man-made changes are of a different order than evolutionary changes (218)? You must be careful in reading the man of Sand County, because even near the end of his essays, his statements often mean both what you rather habitually take them to mean, and something else additional, often something op- posite and oppositional. So that when he says, for exam- ple, that a land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it (204), you must be careful not to take your knee-jerk categories ("conqueror-bad," "plain citizen-good") too much for granted - because, within a sentence, the man of Sand County will modify and, in any case, complicate the usual feedback loops upon which your knee-jerk read- ing depends. In human history , he will say, we have learned (I hope) that the conqueror role is eventually self-defeating (204); and he will mean both what you rather instinctively take him to mean, and something else additional. He will mean, if you'll give him the phrasing, not that the conqueror's role is self-de- feating while the plain citizen's is not, but that both the conqueror's role and the plain citizen's are self-defeating, eventually. And he will thus shift ground on you, as it were,</page><page sequence="6">you who are trying to make sense, to conquer his meaning, to organize your own microtine sense of things. He will mean thus that your conqueror's role is self-defeat- ing, eventually and inevitably, and, with a witty shift of meaning (unless, by now, you are prepared for it) that all the efforts of all the plain citizens are likewise self-defeat- ing - which, of course, is a kind of proof in the pudding that the conqueror is, finally, a plain citizen - but the man of Sand County will also mean that every organism must act, and regularly, as if it were a conqueror, for its own sake, its specie's sake, and for the community's sake-that each citizen of the land-community must act, and regular- ly, as if it knows, ex cathedra, just what makes the community clock tick, just what and who is valuable, just what and who is worthless" - even if (or, rather, because), it always turns out that it knows neither, and this is why [its] conquests eventu- ally defeat themselves (204). So that even toward the end of his essays, even as he la- bors to shape his land-ethic, even as he puts together a lit- tle stack of evidentiary hay by thinking of how ethics have developed over time, and by considering the ecological and evolutionary functions of ethics - and by making another little stack with the concept of the biotic community and the mental image of the land-pyramid - and even as he develops the logical tunnels between those stacks, and between them and that final statement of his attempted creed - even as he puts together his system, if you will, he is able to see it, its premises, its evidences, and its ap- parent conclusion, as microtine, as what it is, finally - yet another in that series of successive excursions from a single starting point, to which man returns again and again to orga- nize yet another search for a durable scale of values (200). In the last analysis, the man of Sand County lives, then, and attempts to continue living in this condition, with its delights and its dilemmas, pretty much in the same way your meadow mouse does. Though he knows his paradox- es and his competing allegiances, his conflicting points of view - though he knows that it all comes to the same thing, finally (133) - he also knows that he's pretty much bound to go down attempting to organize, in however microtine a way, his life and what you call his thoughts, in a manner which he hopes will be economical enough, but not so sim- plistically economical as to seem untrue, or to expose him to unnecessary risks. Finally, then, he can do it, and he does it in this way, because, though he knows that there is something that doesn't love a wall, and that in due time will bring the wall down, he also knows that there is something else, of which he and his inscriptions are very much parts, something which not only loves a wall, but which knows that walls are essential to this living, walls being about the only things that can provide him or you with any semblance of free- dom from want and fear. So that, as you come toward the end of your time and space, you find yourself recalling what a certain professor of wildlife management said to a class of anthropoids in Wisconsin over half a century ago: "Every living thing rep- resents an equation of give and take. Man or mouse, oak or orchid, we take a livelihood from our land and our fel- lows, and give in return an endless succession of acts and thoughts, each of which changes us, our fellows, our land, and its capacity to yield us a further living. Ultimately we give ourselves."2 Notes Aldo Leopold, A Sand County Almanac. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1949). All quotations from A Sand County Almanac are italicized.
