<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Enchanted Room. By Maurya Simon. (Port Townsend, Washington: Copper Canyon Press, 1986. 101 pages, $9.00.) It seems characteristic of many young American poets, hungry to connect with everything, to rely heavily upon pathetic fallacies, personification, or anthropomorphism. Maurya Simon is no exception to this wrong-headedly anthropocentric approach to nature, as evidenced in most of the fifty-eight poems comprising The Enchanted Room , her first book. For example, in "Dividing Light," clouds "prowl the heavens," winter "closes its shutters," and spring "nuzzles against" the poet's hair; in "Red Tide," stars are "pinned to the . . . sky" and "beat their wings furiously . . in "Hermosa Beach, Revisited," ocean waves are "greedy" ; and in "Venice ,1959," the sunlight has "full lips." Such cartoon images might have been justified - as they are in, say, Robert Frost's "Once by the Pacific" - were the speakers' paranoia essen- tial to the conflicts in the poems; but Simon is the speaker in all these particu- lar poems, and mental derangement is not the point of focus.</page><page sequence="2">372 Western American Literature More troubling than the fallaciously presumptuous way Simon deals with inanimate objects is how she deals with other humans in her poems. How can an American poet, visiting India, presume to tell her readers that East Indian women, while walking upon hot coals, weep "in joy" or "in grief" - or that the old East Indian men watching the fire-walk "remember dancing above / the white ashes . . ." ("Firewalking") ? Of course presumption is essential to empathy; yet Simon's frequent presumptuousness overshadows her empathy throughout this collection. She presumes to know that an East Indian man's life will be predictable in the years following his son's death ("The Bearer's Son"), that institutionalized individuals "all long for a father or mother" ("Lost Souls in an Asylum"), that young men on the beach "wonder what genies they'll unleash / when polished by love's hand" ("On the Island of Krk, 1971"), that her recently married sister is "looking for something . . . she'll never find . . ." ("The Wedding"), that East Indian girls' "souls will cling / to their bones" when they fall asleep fearful of a Yeti ("Yeti"), that Sunday fishermen "think / as little about gravity / as they do about war and / the weightlessness of time" ("The Fishermen at Guasti Park"), and that a family killed in the firebombing of Dresden "learned . . . everything is possible . . ." ("Return to Dresden, 1945") . It might seem by a quick glance at Simon's poems she is attempting to leap her own ego- and ethnocentric limitations, but a more careful reading makes obvious the degree to which she actually extends those limitations right into the hearts, the minds, and the souls of individuals rightfully and digni- fiedly free of her presumptuous intrusions into their uniquely other essences.
