Behind this gradual breakdown of orthodoxy grew the various mystical movements which sought to bridge the gap be- tween man and the greater powers by means of ritual and the cult of the Uvx', by myth and cosmogony; this is in a sense a return to a more primitive attitude toward Nature. From both these sources grew the great current of ideas that is reflected in Pindar and the tragic poets; this is the full tide of Greek humanism. Yet a third stream of ideas meets us in the pre-Socratic philosophers. It is difficult to-day to suppose that they suddenly began, without precursors, to speculate about Nature; for it is recognized that their activity was only a continuation, in a new spirit, of the work of the earlier cosmogonists and cosmologists who had asked ques- tions about origins and materials and powers and relationships, and who were interested also in good and evil; moreover it is possi- ble to realize that they were the heirs also of poets and men of religion who had deified whatever living powers they could dis- cover in the world.2 The activity of the pre-Socratic philosophers, though more rational than that of their forerunners, came to an abrupt halt by the end of the fifth century, as the more humanistic and more practical philosophies carried the day; yet even to the Sophists and to the Academy they made valuable contributions, Hommel, H., "Das Problem des tbels im Altertum," N.

If we recall the preoccupation of the earlier Greek poets and of the mystics in the problem of Fate, Good, and Evil, it would be somewhat surprising if we were to find that their successors the pre-Socratic philosophers had lost all interest in the question, even if they limited the field of inquiry and changed the method. They were still concerned with divine powers, however much these powers might doff their anthropomorphic guise. Moreover non- anthropomorphic divinities were older than Homer, and stood also in Homer no less than did the individualized gods as the causes of existence and of change, and often, though not consist- ently, of Good. If the divine and living cause of all things was henceforth to be defined as one or more divine substances or forces, and was to be conceived no longer as being capricious or arbitrary but as being at least as regular in operation as human in- stitutions,' it would be reasonable to inquire whether the fixed and regularly operating divine cause of things could be described as good and as productive of Good, and what origin was to be as- signed to Evil. How far the pre-Socratic philosophers dealt with these questions it is the purpose of this paper to investigate. I The prime interest of the pre-Socratics, of course, was not so much ethical as physical, or perhaps one should say rather physical and metaphysical; that is, they sought an adequate description or theory of the 4bats or nature of all things. That "nature" is an appropriate translation of 4baLs will hardly be denied, though the exact denotation of the word remains a matter of controversy. 1 Cf. C. Huit, La Philosophie de la Nature chez les Anciens (Paris, 1901), p. 231; Scoon, pp. 7-24. The concept of the regularity of Nature lies behind most of the examples of the rhetorical figure 'AGbiatrov (cf. H. V. Canter, A. J. P. LI (I930), pp. 32-41), though in a reversed form: as, "sooner shall X happen (which Nature's laws make impossible) than shall Y occur." The figure is commoner in Latin than in Greek poetry; but it begins in Homer (II. A, 233- 244).</page><page sequence="4">88 William Chase Greene Burnet held that it meant simply "the 'stuff' of which anything is made." 1 I am inclined to agree with Heidel 2 that the term in- cludes also the idea of origin and of the causal nexus of all things in a whole.3 For by an adequate description of Nature the pre- Socratics meant more than an answer to the question " What is the world made of? "4 They sought to find the L0Tbr, as well as the 6rL. Now it is a commonplace that both Plato, speaking through the mouth of Socrates, and Aristotle went out of their way to declare that the pre-Socratics had no real idea of causality, and that in particular Anaxagoras, who at first seemed to promise better things, proved to have nothing better than a mechanical explana- tion.5 What both Plato and Aristotle really mean, as we shall see, is that the forerunners of Socrates did not conceive of Nature as teleological, as Socrates and as they themselves did, and moreover that without such a conception (Aristotle's final cause) there is no 1 E.

Cf. his "Law and Nature in Greek Ethics," in Essays and Addresses (New York, 1930); and his T.-P. p. 27. His view is supported on the whole by A. O. Lovejoy, "The Meaning of 4its in the Greek Physiologers," Phil. Rev. XVIII, 4 (July, 1909); n.b. p. 369, de- fining obats in pre-Socratic usage as "the intrinsic and permanent qualitative constitution of things, what things really are." Cf.

Cornford, Rel.-Phil. pp. 125-142. 3 Not sufficiently stressed, I think, is the fact that Aristotle in his ex parte account of the pre-Socratics and their explanations of aicrlat frequently sub- stitutes for obats the term apx7, which for him means both "beginning" and "cause"; and Aristotle is not disposed to grant his predecessors any more than he can help in the way of an explanation of causality. Cf. Plato, Phaedo, 95e9: the discussion involves an inquiry into causality (aEd IrEpL YEVEWO Kal 00ops rTjip acidTa 6arpay~arTcEraor0at), and reminds Socrates of his youthful interest in the investigations of his predecessors and contemporaries into the question of biOLs, that is, of causes (rEp 4ob-E so l-oplav .. ..

In terms of our problem, they attribute to the pre-Socratics a conception of Fate, but not of Good and Evil. We shall return from time to time to their criticism. Let us now pass in review those points in the remains of the pre- Socratic philosophers which are relevant to our problem. The cbwatL of Thales is alive and creative, and is in fact water, - an adaptation of the Homeric and Hesiodic Oceanus and Tethys, made doubly plausible by the observation of a coast-dweller. To call water the iX-q of the world, as Aristotle says that Thales and others did,1 introduces a later distinction between matter and spirit which did not yet exist, and is so far confusing; to argue that Thales was a "materialist" on this ground is positively mislead- ing.2 Aristotle supposed, on the other hand, that Thales believed that soul, a living, moving force such as animates the magnet and amber, is mingled in the whole, and conjectured that it was for this reason that Thales held that all things are full of gods.3 Just how much Aristotle made of this, is uncertain; Aitius and Cicero go so far as to attribute to Thales what is apparently a consider- ably later doctrine, that of a "world-soul." 4 At any rate, the 42vxi implies divinity, though not yet anything in the way of purpose or of moral goodness. The OEol, of which the world is "full," are powers, but no longer personalities. And if we ask whether Thales had any other notion of causality beyond the idea of Water as a living, cosmogenetic god, we can only refer, with some scepticism, to his apothegms, as recorded by Diogenes Laertius.5 These seem to me quite unprofessional utterances; and I should no more regard the saying laxvp6rarov &amp;PvayKct. KpaCrE? Ydp ra~cTWP as evidence for the " materialism" of Thales than I should 1 Met. A, 3, 983b6 (= DIIAI2). 2 Or that he was a "hylozoist," or a "monist," or a "physicist"; cf. Fuller, pp. 96 f. Less dangerous, though anachronistic, is Aristotle's description of Thales' Water as the apxi of all things (ref. in the previous note). 3 De Anima, 1, 5, 4IIa7 (= DIIA22). 4 DIIA23; cf. R. P. 14. Adam, p. 185, is inclined to accept as possible the idea of the world-soul in Thales, and compares the saying of Heraclitus, invit- ing friends to approach his fireside, "Even here there are gods" (D22A9). For a sceptical view, cf. Burnet, E. G. P. pp. 49 f. 6 D. L. I, 35 (= DIIAI, 35).</page><page sequence="6">90 William Chase Greene accept the saying KaXXLcaroV KO6YO" 72roLya-a Ydp OEoV as proof of his religious orthodoxy. But it is interesting to note in passing the reference to a&amp;dyKq7. Even if Thales used the term, as seems quite probable, in no technical sense, at least it suggests that he recog- nized no distinction between natural and supernatural events; and &amp;atyK-q Will soon become a leading idea for our observation. Water, gods, and necessity represent Thales' effective powers; and Aris- totle might well have granted him an efficient cause in addition to a material cause.1 For Anaximander the primary cosmogenetic substance is not limited, like the Water of Thales, to a single perceived substance, but is described, clearly in reaction against Thales, as 76 oarepov, ageless, unchanging, and divine, and containing within itself "the opposites" which are "separated out" of itself ;2 thus Anaximander accounts both for the emergence of what we call "things" and for an inexhaustible cause of the genesis of things. His "unlimited" is equivalent to the Chaos of the Orphics and of Hesiod,3 and it suggests the idea not only of a "primary substance" but of a process to account for genesis and change.4 Aristotle's treatment of Anaximander is not consistent. In the Physics he argues: (a) that belief in an "unlimited" rests not on sense-perception but on mental inferences and constructions;5 (b) that genesis without end does not require the existence of a oayc a lO71Trop which is unlimited,6- that is, that Anaximander need not assume an unlimited material substance, since within a limited sum of things endless change may take place; (c) in fact, the existence of an infinite substance, whether conceived as the uni- versal substance (-r -arelpopv ci4a) or, "as some say, in addition to the elements" (T6 ?rapa -r TTOLXEca), not only is not revealed to any of our senses, but, if assumed, would prevent the existence of anything else, - e.g., of fire (or, as we might say, in the spirit of 1 Met.

Nevertheless Aristotle holds (d) that Anaximander did believe in an c-rLpov which is iXrl;2 and he admits (e) furthermore3 that if it exists it is fair to regard it as an apx'-, and therefore as self-moving and as "embracing and governing all things"; it is indeed, as he remarks, "the divinity itself, being immortal and indestructible, as Anaximander and most of the vo-toX6yo' declare it to be." 4 In spite of all this, Aristotle studiously ignores Anaxi- mander in his discussion, in the first book of the Metaphysics, of the early philosophers who were "materialists."5 One can hardly avoid asking why, for it is a significant omission." It is not, I think, because he does not sometimes, at least, regard Anaximan- der as " materialist," but rather because he recognizes in him some- thing else besides which does not fit exactly into his own scheme. Indeed Aetius complains that Anaximander is at fault in not specifying just what r6 iarLpov is (whether air or water or earth or some other ~~'ua-ra), and also in relying on ViX- alone without any efficient cause (r6 7roLoDv a'&amp;rtov), without which there can be no EPVpy~Ea.7 In other words, Anaximander's ErL~pov is not palpable to sense (as Aristotle might agree), and it provides no efficient cause (as Aristotle ought not to agree, if he remembered what he wrote in the Physics)." So far we have restricted ourselves to the brELpov, which is pure 1 Phys. P, 3, 204bI2-205A8. Cf. Phys.

But Anaximander's scheme also represents finite beings as proceeding from it, and passing back into it, "according to necessity (Kard 7T XpECv), for they make reparation and satis- faction (&amp;L66pvat 6LK-q Ka TiaLt) to each other for their injustice (da&amp;LKas) according to the appointed time." 1 In T' XpE~W' we find a regulative principle or force which is roughly equivalent to Fate; it is as universal, as impersonal, as anything can be. But in the conception of things "making reparation and satisfaction to each other for their injustice," - "rather poetical terms," as Simplicius aptly remarks in quoting the passage, - we note the transference to the physical world of ideas that we regard as human.2 Here we find the beginning of the philosophical conception of Nature as upholding or as striving for a moral system; it consists in occa- sional retribution for "injustice," rather than in a continuously functioning power; yet the effect is comparable to the conservation of matter or of energy.3 The infringement of the simplicity of Tr 6,7ELpov may even be regarded as a principle of Evil, since it calls into being the egotistical, warring opposites, which tend to gain at each other's expense till they find a balance or are merged once more (like Orphic souls released from the KV'KXOS YEVYiOWS) in r6 2r1ELPpoV; the latter thus now acquires a moral character as the Good (like the Being of Parmenides, except that his Being suffers no change). 1 DI2B1; cf. Ag. 2 The reverse process is to be found in Solon's "Prayer to the Muses," where (11. 17-24) the poet declares that the vengeance of Zeus is as sure, though not so swift, as the clearing of clouds by a spring wind. 3 A. W. Benn, The Greek Philosophers2 (London, n.d.), p. 6, finds here "the ultimate identity of natural with moral law. There is no trace of Oriental pes- simism here, no slight on the desirability of existence in itself. Nor could Anaximander have meant that individual existence as such is an offence against the All-One, for then it could not have been expiated by another wrong. He meant that turn and turn about is a fair rule," etc. The point is well taken; but the "injustice" of which Anaximander speaks is not in being born, but in acting "selfishly." He is referring, of course, to fire and cold, etc. Cf. also Cornford, Rel.-Phil. pp. 7-12; 144-147; Scoon, p. 33, translating KT r&amp; TO xpewv "as is ordained," and seeing in it a final cause; Gundel, p. 7.</page><page sequence="9">Fate, Good, and Evil in Pre-Socratic Philosophy 93 It is Anaximander, too, who has some vague notions of the evo- lution of animals, of the survival of those (enveloped in a prickly husk) that were fitted to their environment, and of lower and higher animals.1 Here it is fair to see something in which Aristotle should have recognized formal causes, and even final causes, if it had suited his purpose to do so, and a world in which Fate furthers the Good but tolerates Evil. Thus early in the history of Greek phi- losophy has the Problem of Evil entered. It is only a passing thought, not to be developed till later. But there is sufficient evi- dence to show that Anaximander deserved a place in Aristotle's sketch of pre-Socratic philosophy, and that a relatively honorable one; can it be that Aristotle's omission betrays an uneasy con- science ?2 Anaximenes agreed with his friend Anaximander, as Simplicius remarks, that the underlying Pbatcs is one and unlimited (5r-ELpoc), but not that it is indeterminate (a'6porov); no, it is Air, ia7p or 7rP?eua, - for he used the terms indifferently, thus identifying the breath of life and atmospheric air, and linking Man and Nature.3 This reversion to a single determinate substance would have seemed to Anaximander unjust favoritism. But his Air is the supreme divinity, active, and creative of gods and of all other beings, by the correlated processes of rarefaction and condensa- tion;4 here we may recognize a step, through different degrees of density, to the conception of purely quantitative determinations, as opposed to the qualitative change of Anaximander.5 Aitius is doubtless correct in pointing out that Anaximenes provides a ma- terial, but not an efficient cause;6 we may add that the process of rarefaction and condensation describes a formal cause, but that i DI 2A3o. 2 Cf. further H.

The Milesian conception of o4'its as divine, though not personal, as self-moving, though regular, has not allowed the ideas of matter and power (or agent) to be separated; it is only when they have been separated that it is possible for Aristotle to criticize the Mile- sian philosophers for providing no efficient cause.' But of any final cause, or of grounds for interpreting the trend of the cosmos in terms of Good and Evil as well as of Power, we have found hardly a trace, save in Anaximander. The assumption has been that the description of what a thing is includes the description of its func- tion or purpose.2 II Xenophanes, greater as satirist and religious protestant than as constructive thinker, a rationalizer rather than a real scientist, is more important in the sequel than in himself, for he begins a new movement of enormous importance for our problem. His One God, not of mortal form, not toiling, not moving, not begotten, is, to begin with, the negation of popular mythology and even of the mystery gods, who are born; positively, he "sees all over, thinks all over, hears all over, and sways all things by the thought of his mind," " and is "throughout alike," 4 and "always alike," 5 and "spherical," 6 and "eternal."'7 That is, he is an abstraction from the powers and divinities of the cosmologists and mythologists. But in dealing with concrete phenomena (matters of opinion), Xe- nophanes falls back on two substances, Earth and Water," so that Aristotle is perhaps justified both in hailing him as the first uni- tarian and in dismissing him somewhat haughtily as vague and 1 Met.

"The functions of an archdeacon," he replied, with a twinkle, "are archi- diaconal functions." By the same token one might say that the activity of brts is physical activity; and until one has established an ulterior reXos one cannot talk of teleological causes, or of goodness. 3 D21B23-26; 31.

In fact, Xenophanes is not patient enough to be a scientist, proceeding from careful observations to a conclusion, but is a man carried away by a sudden moral and intellectual apergu, which he buttresses and defends from all that would weaken it. His motive, too, is not scientific, but religious, and is a reaction against previ- ous and contemporary religion, and against the "gods" of the Milesian philosophers; his own religion is to be pure and unde- filed. In his zeal to rescue his supreme principle from immorality and the imperfections of the transitory world, he lifts it high above the flux and cuts it loose from such physical qualifications as his predecessors have imposed on their "gods." By attributing to his One God an absolute perfection and making it the object of what amounts to religious adoration,2 he is compelled to describe it in chiefly negative terms and to reduce it to pure being; it is opposed to the changing and so far unreal world of phenomena, the subject-matter of popular science and religion, such as clouds and "gods," concerning which there can be only opinion.3 Xe- nophanes thus begins the antithesis, more obvious in Parmenides and Plato, between Reality and Appearance, which makes it hard to explain the relation between the One and the Many. Parmenides completes the severance, and denies the reality of Change and the Many; Plato and Aristotle build up their metaphysical schemes to bind them together, lest they be forever sundered; Xenophanes more light-heartedly evades the issue. His One God "sways all things by the thought of his mind," 4 and is "coherent with all things." 5 He is pure causality; but what he causes, or how, we are not told; for natural phenomena can be explained only by guesswork. So far as our problem is concerned, the One God of Xenophanes appears in the r1le both of Fate and of Good, and Evil must be sought in the shadowy world of appearance; this, 1 Met. A, 5, 986b22 (= D2IA30). 2 Cf. Hack, pp. 61-64; Burnet, T.-P. p. 35, misses the point when he denies that Xenophanes, whom he regards as a pantheist, "regarded this 'god' with any religious feeling." 1 D21B34-36. 4 D2IB25, thus anticipating Anaxagoras. 6 D21A35.</page><page sequence="12">96 William Chase Greene in the sequel, will be of increasing importance. For, whether he realized it or not, the first unitarian was dangerously near to being also the father of dualism. Dualism, of course, had already appeared in unphilosophic guise in the mystery religions, though it remained for Pythagoras and his followers to give it a scientific form. Much of their thought grew naturally from that of their predecessors. The Milesians, the Orphics, Pherecydes, the cults of Delian and Hyperborean Apollo, are enough to account for much that is generally regarded as characteristic of early Pythagoreanism - geometry, "the un- limited," "air," "purifications," WaX-yeveala, and bits of cosmo- logical doctrine.' The real originality of the Pythagoreans consists in the manner in which they added to the idea of the "unlimited" the idea of the "limit," and worked out their relations in the fields of mathematics and medicine and music. For Anaximander, the "unlimited" had been a god, and was endowed with some- thing like a moral quality, as the god from which all things come and to which they all return. The Pythagoreans, true to the Greek instinct which viewed with suspicion the vague and irresponsible unlimited, and admired the well-defined forms of sculpture and Greek landscape,2 made their principle of Evil out of T6 iE7repov, or of darkness, or of empty space, and deified Tr Wrepas, sometimes conceived also as Fire. Because mathematics is the most precise example of definite proportion accessible to the mind, mathematics is invaded by this moral distinction; even numbers, since they are capable of bisection, are mobile and unreliable and evil; odd num- bers, since they resist bisection, are reliable and good.3 The "One" is the divine parent of all other numbers, both odd and even, as the causal unity that underlies the many, much as 7-6 arepov of 1 Cf. Burnet, T.-P. pp. 39-44. It seems unnecessary here to enter into the question of the limits of earlier and later Pythagoreanism; we are here con- cerned chiefly with the former. I accept in the main the position of Burnet, E. G. P. pp. 93-112; 276-304; but for a different position, cf. also Scoon, PP. 44 f.; 134-150; 339-345.

If it is true that "we must not attach too much importance" to these identifications," nevertheless we find serious Pythagorean doctrine in the view, which pervades musical and medical theory alike, that the limit imposes itself on the unlimited in a fixed pro- portion or mean: the result in music is tuning, or "harmony"; in medicine, health. In either case, the process may be described as a Kpao-ts, or mingling, a "tempering" of opposed principles; it suggests not so much the "rarefaction and condensation" of Anaximenes (though this process includes quantitative degrees)4 as the avenging of "injustice" or encroachment which Anaxi- mander had described as taking place.5 The musical scale and the physician's prescription keep a just mean between the extremes of the unlimited. Here, then, is a second sense in which the Pythag- oreans find a Good: not only is the limit good, as opposed to the unlimited, but the resultant of the two is good, limit imposing it- self on the unlimited, as form.6 This takes place both in the orderly cosmos, of which the Pythagoreans were the first to have any real notion, and to elaborate an astronomical system, and in human souls, which likewise represent a tuning or harmony. It will require another step for later Pythagoreans and for Plato to elaborate this theory, and to raise the question whether all living souls, or only the souls of just men, are tuned; and, again, whether the soul existed before it entered the body and will outlive it, as the Orphics and the earlier Pythagoreans held, or whether the soul is merely the attunement of the body. x Cf.

Even the atoms of Leucip- pus, whose qualities depend upon their forms and relations, owe something to the Pythagoreans, however little the atomistic phi- losophy is otherwise related to them. It remains to ask whether the Pythagoreans, who may be said to dispute with Anaximenes the claim of having invented the formal cause, had any conception of a final cause. The answer is probably in the negative, except so far as their One or Limit, conceived of as an active, cosmogenetic god, not merely efficient and formal, but containing in itself an orderly, unfolding process, could be thought of as working toward a goal - the cosmos, and the good man.' Adequate evidence fails us here. But we should not forget that Pythagoreanism, dur- ing its earlier phase, was a religion as well as a science; and that the doctrine, which it shared with the mystery religions, of the soul and its vicissitudes through purification and successive re- births may be regarded as equivalent to a conception of a Fate that fixes the limits within which goodness may be achieved. To Necessity, either as Orphic goddess or as mechanical force, there is apparently no recourse. III In Heraclitus we meet another thinker whose whole philosophy is the elaboration of a single brilliant apergu. Poet at heart, preacher in his manner, scientist in his sympathies if not in his activities, he makes his influence felt in such diverse fields as the Hippocratic writings and the Stoic literature. For ordinary men 1 Aristotle complains, Met. A, 8, 99oa8, that the Pythagoreans do not ex- plain how motion can begin; but he also says, Met.

The one thing needful to be known is that the funda- mental reality is not substance, or a One and a Many, or two op- posite principles, but process, growth, continuity. Rather than try to derive the Many from the One, movement from the station- ary, or try to reconcile opposing principles, it is better to admit at the outset that conflict is the type of all reality. This fundamental process may be variously conceived: as flowing, as burning, as waxing and waning, as breathing, as the melting of day into night, as the tension of the taut bow or lyre. But there is identity in change; what burns is Fire, a living god like the '~Lts of the Milesians.4 Conversely, there is change in identity: Fire con- sumes, and must be fed; it could not exist except at the expense of its fuel, which may be exhausted; measures must be kindled as measures go out, that the Fire may be ever-living.5 The soul lives, sleeps, or dies, according to its degree of dryness or of mois- ture. Hence Anaximander's "separating out" of opposing princi- ples is not a sufficient formula: the "rarefaction and condensation" of Anaximenes suggests alternation, or, as Heraclitus phrases it, an "exchange (A&amp;popLi) of all things for Fire, and of Fire for all things," 6 like the exchange of gold and wares. Again, the process may be described as "the Way up and the Way down." 7 These two Ways are said to be "the same," 8 which appears to be another 1 Frag.

" The Sun will not overstep his measures (Mkrpa); if he does, the Erinyes, the handmaids of Justice (61Ktrl TiKoupoL), will find him out."2 Natural law is thus affirmed on the analogy not only of business law (A'4oLpi) but of the most ancient sanction of moral law. This law, then, is something at last which is time- less, something not carried along with the flux; if all else be rela- tive, this is absolute, whether one call it justice, or yw'd:-l,3 or rb o-oq4v,4 or "the thunderbolt that steers the course of all things,"5 or "the secret of Nature," 6 or "a secret tuning,"'7 as Heraclitus variously named it, or Xbyo', as did his Stoic followers. The strife that Anaximander called injustice is after all justice, and is a uni- versal law. Fools may seek to live in a private world of their own imagining; but the wise "must hold fast to what is common to all (rT iu'w rar?dVwv) as a city holds fast to its law (vbicy) and even more strongly. For all human laws are fed by the one divine law (bnr P,6s T70 BeOov). It prevails as much as it will, and suffices for all things, with something to spare."' So far everything in Heraclitus has conspired to support a view of the world in which things are mere moments in an orderly and inexorable process, and the debt of Cratylus and of Protagoras to Heraclitus is easy to understand. Only this process, a justice which is a law unto itself, has absolute worth; all else is relative, and persons and things and objectives have worth only as they are re- lated to this process. The next step is to affirm explicitly the in- difference of ordinary moral distinctions; Good and Evil are alike absorbed in what must be. From a partial point of view, to be sure, that of self-interest, Good and Evil certainly exist; and dif- ferent interests find different goods. "The sea is the purest and the impurest water. Fish can drink it, and it is good for them; to 1 B67. 2 B29; cf. 20; and J. E. Harrison, Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Re- ligion (Cambridge, Eng., 1903), pp. 216 f.

But from the point of view of the whole, these interests and value-judgments are invalid: "To God all things are fair and good and right, but men hold some things wrong and some right." 2 Thus, just as the "Way Up" and the "Way Down" are the same,3 and "War is common to all and strife is justice," 4 So "Good and Evil are one." 5 Not that good and evil are interchangeable terms, as Aristotle perversely under- stood him to mean;6 not that, as Pope light-heartedly puts it, "Whatever is, is right." 7 What Heraclitus means, and what he would have said if the logical distinction could have been stated in his day, is that members of a pair of correlatives, such as good and evil, or sickness and health, or justice and injustice, have signifi- cance only in relation to their opposites.8 Single members of a pair are incomplete and so far insignificant; a complete point of view embraces both members and welcomes them both as "good." If Heraclitus relegates good and evil, in the ordinary sense, to a position purely relative to the whole scheme of things, thus rating man and his interests very low, he attributes to natural law a " rightness" or "justice" of its own. Evil exists only in misguided men, or in temporary aberrations from Nature's equilibrium. There is here a foretaste of Stoic naturalism and Stoic ethics. To claim Heraclitus, moreover, as a forerunner of Spinoza, view- ing all things sub specie aeternitatis, or even of Hegel, with his insistence on the dialectical nature of thought, may be permissible. But there is hardly a warrant for seeing in Heraclitus, except in a limited sense, a Greek Nietzsche who has passed "beyond good and evil" to a "transvaluation of all values," despite the great 1 B52. 2 B6I.

It is Nietzsche, not Heraclitus, who might agree with Hamlet that " there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so"; it is Heraclitus, not Nietzsche, who finds order and reason and goodness, under many different names, immanent in the strife and flow of things. In the last analysis, Heraclitus is no rebellious individualist, no "superman," and no "weeping philos- opher." 3 If the Stoics owe much to the naturalism of Heraclitus, they owe much also to his treatment of Fate. The motive forces for cos- mogony are poetically described by him as xpIuyo(v-q and K6pos,4 or again as EL/PapLEVPl,5 which is for him apparently the same as a&amp;vyK1q, -fatalis necessitas, - or once more as Logos, or as Fire.6 Yet when it comes to human destiny, Heraclitus writes less as 1 F.

And perhaps as much because of a temperamental disposition as for any other reason, he gave prominence in his system to Change. The paradox troubled Parmenides, who preferred to cut the opposites apart once more; and being by temperament 5 inclined to prefer per- manence to change, he built his system upon the conception of an unchanging unity, the product of pure thought. Since motion and "coming to be," the world of the flux, defied his logic, he outlawed it to another realm; between the two worlds he boldly recognized an impassable gap. Being (object of thought) and Becoming (ob- ject of opinion) were thus divorced; or, in other words, metaphys- ics and physics were distinguished. The language and style of Parmenides' hexameter verse are in the tradition of Hesiod and the mystic myth-makers; his poem is an apocalypse, in which conventional religious abstractions play their part.8 After his prologue, Parmenides proceeds to 1 BI21: 'Hos o 'VOpwnrq aii&amp;o; cf.

Unlike the One God of Xenophanes, and un- like the Unlimited of Anaximander, the Being of Parmenides is sharply defined by an encompassing limit, and this is described in Pythagorean or Orphic language: "Justice (AlK1) does not loose her fetters and let anything come into being (yevPlaoat) or pass away (6XXvoOat), but holds it fast";4 it is immovable in the bonds of mighty chains, without beginning and without end;5 and it rests steadfast in the same place, "since hard Necessity ('AvayKr') keeps it in the bonds of the limit (7reparos E'v /EOoLot exe) that holds it fast on every side, so that it is not infinite."' And again, "there is not, and never shall be, anything beside what is, since Moira has chained it so as to be whole and immovable."7 If we are to speak of causes in the philosophic system of Parmenides, we may properly call his 'AV'&amp;TYK77 or MoLpa a formal, delimiting cause, and seek its pedigree in Pythagoreanism. Efficient and final causes are wanting; in fact, Parmenides rejects any efficient cause to call Being out of non-Being.8 Nor is there any tinge of ethics, of Good by Coxon, p. 144, citing H. Frankel, Parmenidesstudien (Berlin, 1930), pp. 158 f., with "Justice or Destiny," welcomes Parmenides (1. 22), since not potpa KaKi7 but 0~ILs rE LK7 7-E have brought him on his way (11. 26-28); he must (xpEc&amp;, 1. 28) learn all things, both the "heart of truth" and "the opinions of mortals in which there is no true belief at all" (11. 29 f.). 1 D28B2, 11. 5-8. 2 Met.

Yet per- haps we may detect, in AIKf7 and Molpa, if not an ethical concep- tion, at least a value-judgment grounded in an aesthetic instinct for symmetry; they represent not so much retribution or destiny (implying a time sequence) as "due measure"; and in fact the "form" prescribed by this formal cause is that of a sphere, the perfectly symmetrical solid. Yet it is important to note that the sphere is merely a simile: Being "has a furthest limit, is complete on all sides like the mass of a rounded sphere." 2 What Parmenides is talking about, and thinking about, is not a hard, solid, material sphere, but thought itself, firm, closely knit, self-contained, and complete, so that "it is all one to me where I begin; for I shall come back again there." I And if "it is the same thing that can be thought and that can be,"4 what better simile for the object of thought than that most perfect of images palpable both to senses and to reason, the sphere? So the Sphere, like the Fetters and Necessity, takes its place in the archaistic landscape of Parmenides' universe of discourse.5 At the risk of being accused of anachronism, one may point out that here, as elsewhere, Parmenides is the an- cestor of Leibniz; for him, as for Leibniz, this is the best of all possible worlds, because it is a rational world, and is the system in which the greatest quantum of perfection is realized that is possible among mutually compatible members. So far the Way of Truth. But what of phenomena, the world of flux? This is the province of the Way of Opinion. The relation of the latter part of the poem to the earlier remains a subject for 1 Gundel, p. 12, points out that Parmenides fuses Law and Divinity, Decree and Decreer (cf. A~tius, above, p. 104, n. 8), power and personality, and that he is nearer than Heraclitus to recognizing personality in the control of things. But Scoon remarks, p. 77, that though Parmenides is "guilty of the same con- fusion of thought, on the subject of natural regularity, as we found in Hera- clitus," he represents "a further step in the transition from the old Milesian notion of natural Justice and Injustice to the later idea of mechanical regular- ity, which predominates in the Atomist system." 2 D28B8, I, 43: EIKbKXOV av pralpys PaXLyKLOP 6yKoWL.

I need here only record my conviction that it is not 1 the former belief of Parmenides, derived chiefly from Pythag- orean sources, which he now recants, but is rather the sort of plausible account, common to (philosophic) mortals 2 and particu- larly among Pythagoreans, which he puts forth as the best that he can give. It is "a concession to appearances," as Aristotle phrases it." There can be no real knowledge of the world of phenomena, for it is not rational and cannot be deduced from Being; in fact, the doctrine of Being renders motion, change, and becoming incon- ceivable. Yet the world of the flux has for Parmenides a specious half-reality, so that one may have of it, if not knowledge, at any rate opinion. The parallel with Plato, particularly in the Timaeus, is fairly close: the world of Ideas on the one hand, the world of concrete phenomena on the other hand; and, as Plato puts it, "What Being is to Becoming, Truth is to Belief." 4 Hence Par- menides resorts, much as Plato does, to traditional opinions (partly Pythagorean) and the literary device of the myth (Orphic in origin). Again and again he declares that this doctrine is not true but is the best that he can offer with regard to such refractory material. He has marked, once and for all, the line between meta- physics and physics, and he has drawn the line well, even if he finds truth only in the realm of metaphysics. Modern physics, it may be noted, once so proud of its empirical methods, is tending to-day to creep over into metaphysics; but Parmenides would warn it that it has started from the wrong end, and furthermore that the line can never be passed with safety. For whereas Plato and Aristotle and Christian theology and Kant all recognize a dis- tinction between the realm of Being (Thought, Ideas) and concrete phenomena, they all seek to minimize it and to bring the two worlds into relation with each other. Only Parmenides was con- sistent, or honest, or stubborn enough to insist that the gap re- 1 As Burnet would have it, E. G. P. pp. 182-187. 2 D28BI, 1. 30: fporwv 63as; cf.

For though the Pythag- oreans, beginning with premisses as abstract as his, had incon- sistently evolved a physis and a cosmogony,' Parmenides held consistently that Being cannot be the apx~7 of Becoming.2 Never- theless, Parmenides wrote a cosmogony after all, pointing out that he was making an absolutely fresh start, and that his picture is not a true one.3 Into the details of this cosmogony we need not go; it is enough to observe that it involves the error of mortals in naming two "forms," which are two too many.4 That is, the dualism of pairs of opposites, Light and Night,' such as the Pythagoreans have used, is indeed the only condition on which change or motion is conceiva- ble, but since the first philosophy of Parmenides has proved that change and motion are inconceivable, this dualism is de trop. Aristotle notes that Parmenides, despite his principle "being com- pelled to accord with phenomena, and assuming that Being is one in definition (KaT r'T XOyov) but many in respect of sensation (KTar&amp; rT ad'lor-,w), posits in his turn two causes (alrtas) and two first principles (apxds), Hot and Cold, or in other words Fire and Earth. Of these he ranks Hot under Being and the other under Not-Being." 6 And elsewhere Aristotle remarks that none of the pre-Socratics "who maintained that the universe is a unity achieved any conception of an efficient cause, except perhaps Par- 1 Arist.

Yet just what the cause of it is, on Parmenides' showing, remains not clear. "He has left the appearances unexplained" (Cornford, Parm. p. iio). The presence of 'AdYK7yK in both parts of the poem is not enough to prove that she creates both worlds; for the world of opinion is false. Perhaps it may be permitted to an early philosopher, as to a modern one, to have a few holes or weak spots in his system. 3 D28B8, 1. 52: K60a7oop t/ i6 roi( d&amp;ra7rfX6p; cf. 11. 53 f.; and D28BI, 11. 30- 32. * D28B8, 1. 53: 1iop46s; cf.

It is tempting to suppose that Parmenides entertained among his opposites other pairs, such as the Pythagoreans in- cluded among their EvoErollaLt, and among them Good and Evil,4 or at least that for him, as for various oriental religions, Light and Night stood for Good and Evil, among other things, so that within the realm of Opinion, though not of Truth, the doctrine that this is the best (most rational) of all possible worlds 5 would give place to a moral dualism. But the point must, I fear, be regarded as doubtful.' The cosmogony continues in the prophetic manner of a myth with an account of the way in which on the illegitimate dualistic assumption things may be supposed to be arranged:7 the o#vts of the sky, and its contents, and their origin.8 Here at last is "physics," growth and decay, with a vengeance, and incidentally support for the view that b1as must include among its meanings that of growth. Although the thought is not that Being creates Becoming, there are certain analogies or echoes of the mystical language of the early part of the poem. "Thou shalt know the heavens that surround us, whence they arose, and how Necessity ('Ava'YK7) took them and bound them to keep the limits of the 1 Met. A, 3, 984b2-4.

As in the Way of Truth the firm structure of reality was bound by 'AVy K'1, or ALKrl, or Mopa, so even in the physical world of Opinion, Necessity holds the universe together within bonds, an efficient cause of almost personal character. To correspond with the Sphere with which Being is compared in the Way of Truth, we have in the cosmogony not a solid sphere but a system of "rings" or "crowns"; 2 one is reminded of the world in Plato's Timaeus created by the ~.ptLovpybs after the perfect pattern, and of time the copy of eternity; 3 or, one might say, of a clock that keeps time with its interlocking wheels and cogs. And somehow at the centre is the 5altwv who "directs (KUPEpva) the course of all things," and is the beginner of birth and generation, and who con- trived "Epws first of all the gods."4 Again we are on familiar ground; here is Eros, the creative life-force of the Orphics and of Hesiod.5 Whether the balapwv is simply 'AvYd7K'1 once more, or is Aphrodite, is a matter of inference." A~tius, doubtless recording the views of Theophrastus, reports that "the central circle of the mixed crowns is the cause of movement and becoming to all the rest, being the goddess who directs their course," and adds that Parmenides calls her "Justice" and "Necessity" and the "Holder of Lots."' The "Holder of Lots" who is also "Necessity" so strongly reminds one of the divinity in Plato's Myth of Er that one must suspect either influence or a common source, doubtless in Pythagorean litera- ture.8 If Simplicius has any warrant for his statement that the goddess in Parmenides "sends souls at one time from the light to the unseen world, at another from the unseen world to the light,"' 1 D28BIo, 11. 5-7; cf.

With regard to the few remaining fragments, extending his principles to physiology and the theory of knowledge, it is enough to note that health and intelligence, like differentiated and changing being in general, are explained on a dualistic theory of a balance of opposites.1 IV The river of Greek philosophy has now a number of affluents, and with Empedocles it hurries its pace. From Xenophanes and Parmenides he derives his craving for a unity to be explained by the exercise of the speculative reason; from Heraclitus, his recog- nition of change and observed phenomena; from Heraclitus and more remotely from the Orphics and Pythagoreans the conception of an alternation or periodicity, by which opposites are given play, and therefore a theory of metempsychosis, of cosmogony, and of history, in all of which 'Av&amp;ylK7- is operative. From the locked and frozen plenum of Parmenides he can find no release except by abandoning monism and thereby admitting change. Hence, in the ITEpt ic7Ews, the four "roots,"2 which are imperishable, without birth or death;3 and, to account for their union in a "mixture" " and their dissolution,5 the two forces, called "Love" (iLXLa) and "Strife'" (NEiKoS) respectively, which he describes as being also timeless.6 It is often said 7 that Empedocles was the first to dis- tinguish an efficient from a material cause; but we have found something like an efficient, or at least a living, cause more than once among his predecessors. Moreover it is commonly said 8 that Love and Strife are regarded by Empedocles as being quite as 1 D28BI6; 17. 2 D3IB6: r)Sclpara. 3 D3IB8; 9; 11; I2; cf. D31A44- D3IB8: t/[ty, cf.

In "Love" he provides a force of at- traction or cohesion, known to mortals as Joy and Aphrodite,' though she unites unlike bodies; and she is also a cosmic force.4 The cosmic process of change, of growth and decay, in the sys- tem of Empedocles suggests the Strife, or the "Way Up" and the "Way Down," of Heraclitus; it may be described as an alternation of opposing forces,5 like the double process of breathing or of the heart's action, or, better, as a cycle. After the period in which all the four diverse elements are mingled by Love in the perfect Sphere, there is supposed to be a period of disintegration (as in such degeneration myths as that of the Ages in Hesiod), during which the power of Love is waning, and that of Strife is waxing; this is apparently our age." There follows the triumph of Strife, and the separation of the "roots" out of the mixture, so that like is reunited with like. Then as outlawed Love returns and drives out Strife, the mixture is made again, by a process of "reversed evolu- tion," 7 till finally all the "roots" are reunited once more in the perfect Sphere.8 In addition to the material "roots" and the efficient forces of Love and Strife, Empedocles attempts, however vaguely, to provide an explanation of the way in which the world and its contents are 1 D3IBI7, 11. 19 f. 2 Met.

In the period when Love is in the ascendant once more, however, Empedocles admits an element of chance; 6alowv mingled with baLlwv and joined "as each might chance."' More striking still is the statement, in the account of sensation, that "all things have the power of thought 1 Arist. De Part. An. I, I, 642aI7 (= D31A78): Xb6yos rs yfL~w. Cf. Met. A, 9, 993ai5-24; here Aristotle says that Empedocles explained bone as existing by virtue of its X6yos (cf. the proportion in D3IB96), but that he did not gen- eralize the explanation as an account of the formal cause. This criticism is really unfair; granted that the statement of a final cause (what is good for a given thing) must include a definition of each given thing (its formal cause), Empedocles has at least provided a sample of such definition, as if a popular lec- turer on chemistry were to content himself with illustrating chemical structure by the formula of a single compound. (Cf. further Cherniss, pp. 233 f.) For a more generalized statement, there is the 4pip of D31BI34 (see above, 11. 1-3, and n. 2). Zeller nevertheless holds (II, pp. 143 f.) that Empedocles "had not ar- rived at the doctrine that all natural phenomena are regulated by law." Even if we limit ourselves to the fragments of Empedocles, however, it seems to me that the conception of law is clearly indicated; e.g., D3IB3o; 31; I34; 135. 2 D31BI34; cf.

The result of the first process may be described as the necessary evolution of differentiated species by the waning power of Love and the increasing action of Strife, and the survival, at least for a time, of the fit. In the period of "inverted evolution," moreover, some accidental, monstrous com- binations of limbs and heads perished, while those that were mutu- ally advantageous remained in union.2 These accounts, taken to- gether, not merely mark an advance on Anaximander's notion of man as a modification of lower forms by adaptation to environment, but even foreshadow certain elements in Darwin's conception of accidental variation, of struggle and survival.3 This can hardly be called a teleological view of evolution. In fact, Empedocles is criticized by Plato and Aristotle for this very reason: by Plato, because Empedocles explains everything by 4Qberts and -rxLr, and ava-yKt7, not by rTxvy or any 0e6b;4 by Aristotle, because the persist- ence of normal natural species (unlike such accidental monstrosi- ties as the human-headed oxen of Empedocles), being the neces- sary result of sufficient causes, argues a purpose in Nature which Aristotle fails to find recognized by Empedocles.5 But Empedocles is at any rate capable of explaining the structure of the eye, with the pupil protected by membranes, as having been contrived by Love, just as a man encloses the flame of a lantern with horn plates to protect it against the winds of a stormy night;6 this might well be termed purpose in Nature. It is only a short step from such a remark to complete moral dualism; and Aristotle in one passage interprets Empe- docles as having really meant to explain the cosmic process in this sense. "Since it was apparent that Nature also contains the oppo- site of what is good, i.e., not only order and beauty but disorder and ugliness, and that there are more bad and common things 1 D3IBIo3: "i67r-t TrXls. 2 Arist.

For if one follows and gives heed to the statements of Empedocles with a view to his meaning, and not to his lisping expression in words, it will be found that Love is the cause of Good, and Strife of Evil. Thus it would perhaps be correct to say that Empedocles in a sense spoke of Evil and Good as first principles, and was the first to do so, that is, if the cause of all good things is the Good itself [and of evil things, Evil itself]." 1 Here order and TO KaXbvv are as- sumed to be principles which a powerful force maintains; it is too much to say that Aristotle admits that it seeks to maintain them. Furthermore, they are opposed by another force, productive of disorder and ugliness, which Aristotle significantly holds to be preponderant, so that for Aristotle the philosophy of Empedocles should have a pessimistic tinge. Elsewhere, however, Aristotle interprets the Love and Strife of Empedocles as equivocal forces, without moral character: "Empedocles does indeed use causes to a greater degree than [Anaxagoras], but not sufficiently; nor does he attain to consistency in the use of them. At any rate, he often treats Love as separating and Strife as combining; for when the Universe (rb 7rav) is resolved into its elements by Strife, fire and each of the other elements are combined into unity (E Ev); and whenever they are all combined together again by Love into the One (EiS rT vE) the parts of each are necessarily separated again." 2 "He posits Strife as a kind of principle which is the cause of destruction; but none the less Strife would seem to pro- duce everything except the One, for everything except God pro- ceeds from it. ... It follows on his theory that Strife is no more the cause of destruction than it is of Being." ' This criticism raises a point of fundamental importance.

Apart from an instinctive aesthe- tic preference for the peacefulness and perfection of the Sphere, and a monistic inheritance from Xenophanes and Parmenides and from the mystics,' there seems to be no reason. Or again, why is either of these extreme states to be preferred to the two half-way stages, one when our world of "things" and species is evolving from the Sphere, thanks to Strife and Necessity, the other of "re- versed evolution"? The answer is simply that these "things" are perishable, and their differentiation and fitness for a temporary environment are of slight account for one who views things, as do Parmenides and Empedocles, sub specie aeternitatis. Empedocles is far removed from the point of view of the humanist whose moral standard of reference is man and his interests, and who regards man as the climax of the evolutionary series. He views our present world in the light of ancient degeneration myths as an impairment of primal perfection. And, finally, our world is for him a moment in the cycle of existence,2 that cycle from which the mystics ever sought release. Not Empedocles, but Heraclitus and Anaximander, regard Strife as justice, and Good and Evil as one." Not Empedo- cles, but the Atomists, regard with indifference the variety of the disintegrated world, and the forces that build up or that destroy as equivocal. For Empedocles both Love and Strife are indispen- sable, for without both there cannot be change or "otherness." But Love creates the one Sphere, and Strife breaks it apart; hence though both are in a sense divine, one is a god and the other is something like a devil.4 1 See above, p. 103, n. 5, on the instinct for monism, criticized by W. James. 2 D3IBI17, 1. 13. 3 For Anaximander, cf. Cornford, Rel.-Phil. p. 232: "In Anaximander's scheme the Reign of Justice came next after the primal state of fusion and before the existence of individual things. [See above, p. 92.] The motive of Empedocles' rearrangement is clear. To him Strife is an evil principle; it causes separation and, to the mystic, separation is evil, union is good. Hence the state of the world in which Strife triumphs is the lowest depth of evil, not, as it was for Anaximander, a Reign of Justice." 4 Scoon holds, p. 9I, that the Sphere is identical with Love, and with the cosmic mind which is described in language similar to that used of the Sphere (D3IB27-31; cf. 134), and is the supreme god of Empedocles. But the Sphere, though a god and though perfect, (i) is not immortal, and (2) cannot act, and</page><page sequence="32">116 William Chase Greene The theology of Empedocles, set forth chiefly in the KaeappuoL, is of no great originality, being chiefly a borrowing from the mysti- cal religions. Nevertheless he is at some pains to connect it with his philosophy, by placing man in the continuous cycle of Being; he may fairly be described as a pantheistic Orphic.1 So, for ex- ample, his horror of eating flesh is not based on any mere taboo, but on his vision of the unity of all Nature; flesh-eating is practi- cally cannibalism, since animals, men, and gods are all united in one family through the 7rvzEiua that penetrates the KO6cTOS.2 In his picture of the Golden Age, over which not Ares nor Zeus nor Posei- don ruled, but Kypris (= "Love"), there was no blood-sacrifice;3 and "all things were tame and gentle to man, both beasts and birds, and friendly feelings were kindled everywhere." 4 Empedocles himself is a god, though a fallen one, through that "oracle of Necessity" that condemns to exile from the abodes of the blessed for thrice ten thousand years such as have sinfully polluted their hands with blood or followed Strife and forsworn themselves.5 (3) is the product of Love's effect on the four "roots." The supreme god may more reasonably be sought in the q4piv of D3IBI34, however difficult it may be to connect this conception with the rest of Empedocles' philosophy. Hack, p. 96, identifies the supreme One God both with the cfp'Y and with the Sphere which "comes back to identity with itself at fixed periods under the agency of the divine power of Love" (p. 98). He well explains the temporary modifica- tion of the perfection as an attempt to mediate between Parmenides and Hera- clitus; this works well enough for the Sphere, but not, it seems to me, for the p~pw. Cf. further Cherniss, p. 36, n. 135; PP. 50 f.; 230-234; 360. 1 Adam would hardly assent to this description; cf. pp. 252 f. Cornford, Rel.-Phil. pp. 224-242, deals with the " consistency of Empedocles," showing that he " comes within an ace of succeeding" in reconciling " Orphic and Pytha- gorean doctrines of immortality . . . with Ionian physical science." He re- gards "his physical system as modelled on his religious beliefs and dictated by them," and therefore discusses first the Purifications and then the poem About Nature. The question of order seems to me at least debatable. 2 D3IBI35; 136 (with Sext. Emp.); 137. 3 D3IBI28. 4 D3IBI29. Lovejoy and Boas, Primitivism, p. 32, refer the pacifism and vegetarianism to "chronological primitivism" (the view that (p. i) "the most excellent condition of human life, or the best state of the world in general," fell in the past). They observe, p. 32, that "the supposition that men were once innocent of slaughter is connected with the Empedoclean cosmogony." 6 D3IBI15. See above, p. 112.</page><page sequence="33">Fate, Good, and Evil in Pre-Socratic Philosophy i 7 Through the cycle of Being he must pass wearily from one to another of the four elements, rejected by each in turn. The details of the apocalyptic landscape suggest Orphic parallels.' Yet there is hope for the soul of winning, after purifications and repeated metempsychosis, a return to blessedness and reunion with the gods.2 The wise, however, as we are told in both of the poems, are blessed in this life; 3 thus for religion, as for philosophy, the unity of all Being persists through diversity and change. It is only Empedocles' inherited conception of personal pre6xistence and im- mortality, and the importance attached to the personality, that will not fit into his philosophic system, as he does not seem to realize.4 This is an important exception, for freedom of the will and moral choice based on human values are involved in it. Apart from this, Empedocles was drifting toward pantheism, not without tendencies toward mechanism. Anaxagoras, like his Ionian predecessors, is at heart a physicist, concerned with the nature of being and of change. Unlike Em- pedocles, he has no distinct theology, no mysticism, no ethical system. As eager as Parmenides to find a unified, continuous reality, he is also as anxious as Heraclitus or Empedocles to ac- count for variety and change, though without destroying the con- tinuity. Thus whereas Empedocles has adopted a limited form of pluralism, with four "roots" absolutely distinct one from another, Anaxagoras boldly carries his pluralism so far as to assert that the "seeds" (oTrip/ara) are infinitely divisible,5 and that "there is a portion (oipa) of everything in everything,"' though the pro- portions vary and cause things to be named for some preponder- ant part. Thus no thing is absolutely separate from its "other,"7 i DII5; 120-123. 2 D3IBI45; 146. 3 D3IBI32, from the Purifications; cf. iio, from the poem On Nature. 4 Even Cornford, Rel.-Phil. p. 229, speaks of each soul as "an atomic in- dividual." Burnet, E. G. P. p. 250, remarks that "the cosmological system of Empedocles leaves no room for an immortal soul, which is presupposed by the Purifications." 5 D59B3. 6 D59BII; cf. 6; I2; and the "opposites" of Heraclitus. 7 D59B8; 12.</page><page sequence="34">118 William Chase Greene with one exception to be noted presently. Change is simply min- gling or separation (av &amp;er-ywa-at, 3taKplvEOa-at). Whereas Empedocles has had recourse to two opposing forces, Love and Strife, in alternate motion mingling or separating his "roots," Anaxagoras employs a single source, which he terms "Mind" (Noi3), of a rotary motion. Granted that there are two termini, union and dissolution, Empedocles uses what a modern traffic manager might call a "shuttle train" (with alternating engines), while Anaxagoras uses a "loop train." Even Empedo- cles, to be sure, thinks of the stages in his process as a cycle.' This Novs is the one exception to the statement that "there is a portion of everything in everything"; for the statement continues, "ex- cept Noi3; and there are some things in which there is Nois also,"2 by which remark Anaxagoras apparently intends to account for the difference between inanimate and animate things. Anaxag- oras takes some trouble to set apart No^s from the rest of his uni- verse, as the sole separable reality, and characterizes it as "infinite and self-ruled, and mixed with nothing, but alone, itself by itself," as "the thinnest of all things and the purest," and as having "all knowledge about everything and the greatest strength . . . and power over all things . . . that have life." Nevertheless many scholars find it hard to admit that he intended to make Nov3 an immaterial force." Now it seems clear that neither Anaxagoras nor any other Greek had yet reached the conception of "immate- rial, inextended consciousness"; but Anaxagoras does appear to be speaking of pure extension (like the Being of Parmenides), endowed (unlike the Being of Parmenides, but like the extended and thinking substance of Spinoza) with power to move. Thus "Novs set in order (&amp;EK6OaO-/O-E) all things that were to be, and all things that were and are not now, and the things that are, and the 1 D3IB35, 1. 10: KlKXOS. 2 D59BII; cf. 12. 3 So Burnet, E.

Like the stage on which a drama unfolds itself, it defines the action. Nor does it define the action merely in terms of space, but also throughout a time sequence,2 so that the r61le of Nois might be compared to the plot of a drama, manipulating its characters in time and space. This simile, if valid, would make of Nov3 an efficient and a formal cause, and would even suggest a final cause as well. Did Anaxagoras mean in Nois to provide a teleological explanation of all things? Here we reach a critical point in our investigation. Perhaps it will help if we ask why Anaxagoras chose Nois, rather than some other word, to express the source of motion. It is to be noted that he dispenses with several of the terms of his predecessors; he has no recourse to calLovei or OEoL, to Moipa or to elgappi-vr,3 or, finally, to a&amp;vyKr7 or rhX'q (forces generally reckoned as hostile to man). It looks as if he were deliberately avoiding both the deism of the cos- mogonists and the fatalistic or mechanistic explanations of Ionian philosophy. Yet he might, like Heraclitus and Empedocles, have used X67os, to suggest the regularity or pattern of Nature; or he might, like Anaximenes and the Pythagoreans, have been satisfied with /vx', to suggest a living and life-giving force. Indeed, accord- ing to Aristotle,4 he did use ivx', as an alternative term to Noos, for the moving principle. But he preferred, on the whole, to employ Novs, which in ordinary Greek usage implied intelligence, either percipient or purposive. Thus he united the conception of a living substance that knows with that of a power which, to a greater or less extent, in the cosmos or in man, moves all things, like the Love and Strife of Empedocles, or like the unmoved Mover of Aristotle.5 Does the use of the term Novs mean that Anaxagoras further- more thought that the KO'YCo of things was planned for a definite rtXos?

The latter alternative may be immediately dismissed. The pre-Socratics have so far tended to substitute for anthropo- morphic divinities other divinities which are pure causality; it would be indeed strange if Anaxagoras were to be found suddenly readmitting an anthropomorphic and even anthropocentric ex- planation of all things; and that is not his meaning. Nois, to be sure, suggests rationality, as contrasted with blind force, and is therefore an appropriate term to use of the cause of a world, so far as it is a cosmos that can be known. But it need not necessarily imply that the world was designed for the express good of any human individual, or of the human race. The world of Anaxagoras, in brief, is constructed on intelligible principles. Nevertheless it is not pure intelligence; "mind set in order all things," but did not create them. Like a physical or chemical formula, it does not create "things," but describes their constitution and behavior; furthermore, it is supposed by Anaxagoras also to move things; and if he meant also to suggest that it moved them for some pur- pose, the word Nois could be understood as conveying that idea as well. But that he did mean this, cannot be proved from the fragments or from the testimonia. And here, I think, is the reason for the disappointment of the Socrates of the Phaedo, and of Aristotle. The striking point to be noted in the criticisms of both Plato and Aristotle is the discrepancy between their admiration for Anaxagoras for having introduced the conception of Novs as cau- sality and their disillusionment when they discovered that he did not use his conception in support of the teleological conception of Nature which they themselves held. His was a "dusty answer" to their eager hopes. In the Phaedo 1 Socrates is represented as having been interested, in his youth, in rEpl oo-Ews lo opla, in learning TS atrtaF EIKIo&amp;U, &amp; nc TL "yLyvErat KaTTOV Kal &amp;aTL 7arodrXXvrat Kai b&amp;&amp; rTL a'L, and as having become so confused by the conflicting physical explanations of the day that he hailed with delight2 the report that Anaxagoras was saying that vo^s Eirnv 6 &amp;aKOO-WV 7TE 1 96a. 2 97b.</page><page sequence="37">Fate, Good, and Evil in Pre-Socratic Philosophy z21 Kal r~TdarV CTLOS, which he supposed would mean that vo^vs ordered each and every thing for the best (ir a &amp;v PlXTarra EXn), so that the investigation into causality would resolve itself into an inquiry into the Good, which would be the arTia and adVdytKr11 that account for the several natural phenomena. The disappointment which young Socrates is represented as having experienced is that he found, after all, that Anaxagoras "made no use of vois, nor as- cribed to it any causality in the ordering of things, but rather used airs and aethers and waters and many other absurdities,"2 as if one were to account for the fact that the aged Socrates is refusing to escape from prison by a theory of bones and muscles, rather than by reference to his idea of what is good and just,3 thus mis- taking for a real cause what is merely a sine qua non.4 Aristotle also praises Anaxagoras only to condemn. "It is un- natural to suppose," he writes, "that fire or earth should cause existing things to be or become well and beautifully disposed . . . nor would it be reasonable to ascribe so important a matter to accident and chance. Hence when someone said that it is the pres- ence of Mind which is the cause of order and all arrangement in Nature, just as in animals, he seemed like a sober man by contrast with the random talk of his predecessors." 5 Here, however, the agreement ends. For whereas Plato denies that Anaxagoras made any use of Mind, Aristotle accuses him of "availing himself of Mind as a deus ex machina for the production of order, and when he is at a loss to explain some necessary result (6Ld&amp; ri' airTav iE atVyK7s &amp;r7tT) then he drags in Mind; but in all other cases he makes anything rather than Mind the cause of what happens."6 When we turn to the scanty fragments of Anaxagoras, we are forced to admit that, so far as they go, they bear out the criticism of Plato better than that of Aristotle, but that neither critic is fair.

As a matter of fact, he never in the extant fragments uses the word atlrta. What he does (and this is the real reason for the animus of both his critics) is to begin the ordering of things with No's, which, if anything, is his deus ex machina, and then to continue his account of details with mechani- cal explanations, developed largely from Anaximenes, in which air in various forms appears frequently.2 But he never for a mo- ment supposes that he is explaining the details teleologically. One of his explanations is significant. He has argued that animal life differs from vegetable life in degree (bodily structure), but not in kind (all having the same Nois); I how then can he account for man's superior wisdom? Not by any better intelligence, but be- cause he has hands. Aristotle, who records the remark, curiously but not unexpectedly inverts the explanation: Nature has given man hands because he is the most intelligent creature.4 It should be clear now that the unfair criticism of Anaxagoras by Plato and Aristotle is due to the fact that he appeared to them in the light of a "lost leader," one who seemed to point onward to such a final cause, such an optimistic outlook, as they themselves entertained, but who left them in the lurch.5 Whereas what he meant to say, in effect, is this: "I believe that a single living God 6 1 D59BI2; Plato admits this elsewhere, Cratyl. 413c (= D59A55). 2 Cf. Burnet, E. G. P. pp. 269-272. 3 D59BII1; I2. 4 De Part. Animal. io, 687a7 (= D59AIo2). Cf. Cherniss, p. 260, n. I70. 5 C. Gbring, Uber den Begrif der Ursache in der griech. Phil. (Leipzig, 1879), pp. 6-9, finds the chief difference between Anaxagoras and the earlier (mechan- istic) treatment of Nature in his optimistic point of view; since design and beauty cannot be derived from dv6byKn, he invoked Nods, but without having any real conception of causality and without developing a real teleology. If he had not asked, with insufficient materials, about the L6&amp;OT as well as the irTL, which Aristotle generally admits to be the prior question (cf. Met. A, i, 98ia29; bI3; E. N. A, 4, 7, I095b6-8), he would have escaped Aristotle's criticism. I agree, though I find more traces of optimism and of inquiry into the 8Ltbr in the predecessors of Anaxagoras than Giring does. 6 D59A48.</page><page sequence="39">Fate, Good, and Evil in Pre-Socratic Philosophy 123 (who is Mind and Air and Aether) is the source of all power and motion and variety in the visible universe, and inspires all living things; lifeless things are something of a problem for me, and seem somehow to resist the power of Mind, but I am not ready to admit that they are absolutely unknowable. Now, having recited my creed, I will proceed to details, and deal with them as rationally as I can." Such men are dangerous; and that Anaxagoras should have been charged with impiety and forced to leave Athens is, everything considered, not surprising. Plato, even in his old age, refers, without naming them, to some philosophers who explain all things by Nature or chance, not by mind, or God, or art,' and to early astronomers who attributed mind to the universe, but who mistook the true order of things and therefore made the soul younger than the body and assigned causes to bodies, thus pro- ducing atheism and perplexity.2 If Empedocles is the model for the first of these portraits, clearly it is Anaxagoras whom the sec- ond depicts; his science is attacked in the name of religion. A brief glance at the pre-Socratic successors of Anaxagoras must suffice. Both Diogenes of Apollonia and Archelaus betray his in- fluence, no less in the attempt to develop the conception of Nois as a unifying force throughout the natural world than in the use of Air. Diogenes is indebted ultimately to Anaximenes for his con- ception of Air as the single divine substance of which all things are differentiations (7-epoLdo-Oat) for mutual "good or harm" (c'ajb~ rs . . . XPr);3 but from Anaxagoras he draws his identification of Air with Intelligence,4 which is the God5 which "steers all things and has power over all things, which reaches everywhere, and dis- penses everything, and is in everything," though in different modes (-rp6nrot); it is "an eternal and undying body" (-cr-O4a).6 Finally, however slight may be our evidence with regard to the teleological character of the Noi3s of Anaxagoras, Diogenes says explicitly that it is only by reason of N6bats that things "keep their 1 Laws, 889b (= D31A48). 2 Laws, 967b. 3 D64B2.

And he adds the significant remark, "And anyone who cares to reflect will find that everything else is disposed in the best possible manner (c~s dvvtrbv KadXXLo-ra)." Thus Diogenes proclaimed what young Socrates, according to the Phaedo, had longed to find proclaimed by Anaxagoras, and deserves in all probability to be called the first teleologist among Greek philoso- phers.2 Anaxagoras was exiled from Athens and censured by Plato; Diogenes enjoys the distinction of having been parodied by Aristophanes3 and imitated both by the "Hippocratean" trea- tise IHept vcrcAv4 and by Euripides.5 Of Archelaus of Athens, pupil of Anaxagoras and possibly quon- dam teacher of Socrates, it will suffice to note that he kept the Noi~s of his master and attributed it to animals as well as to men, but that in a desperate attempt to get Nois effectually at work in the world he "held that there was a certain mixture immanent even in NoOs," as well as in matter;6 in other respects he recurs to more primitive Ionian physics. V The Atomists, though not strictly pre-Socratic, must be briefly considered here, since their work is uninfluenced by the sophistic movements except in the ethical teaching of Democritus. They return to the concept of Fate or Necessity; but so far as they attempt a theory of Good and Evil they stand revealed as human- ists building a world of human values independent of their mechan- istic system. The only surviving fragment of Leucippus (from a work significantly entitled HEp1 Noi) runs as follows: "Naught happens at random (paT'rvt), but all things from a ground and of necessity (K XOb-ov E Kat 7r' av'yKr1rs)." 7 But whereas Parmenides has deified ad'Vy K and ELyapp~iv, Leucippus and Democritus re- 1 D64B2. 2 Cf.

Thus the whole cosmos is bound in a causal nexus, somehow rational, and dispenses both with Chance 2 and, with one slight exception to be noted presently,3 with Purpose. Aristotle, to be sure, attributes to the Atomists an account of animals and plants not tarb rvxqs, but using 4vatv voiv rT" Troto'- ToPV ~Epov, but implies that they inconsistently assign astronomi- cal movements, including the cosmic whirl (6tiv7) to rb abc6rbarov.4 This "cosmic whirl," however, which Diogenes Laertius says5 that Democritus identifies with "necessity," is automatic only in the sense that it is not directed by a final cause.6 Presently, dealing with Empedocles and Democritus, Aristotle remarks that on their premisses it does not rain in order to increase the grain, but by a law of necessity which makes cold water descend; the growth of the grain is an accident, or an incidental result (ov,34P6fKE).7 So, he continues, in the human body different types of teeth, for ex- ample, have different functions, but these functions are supposed by the Atomists (and Empedocles) to be accidental - that is, not intended. Thus whereas Aristotle himself would, quite differently, interpret these phenomena as the fulfilment of a purpose of Nature,s 1 Arist.

So Good and Evil enter where Nature leaves off, and all without any random or arbitrary interference of any divine or supernatural power. Necessity itself is hardly more than the absence of any interference with the mo- tion of the atoms; I all things are natural. We feel ourselves once more in the full current of Ionian physics, and recall the utterances of Thales ("all things are full of gods" 2), and of Heraclitus beside his fire ("here too are gods" 3), and the Hippocratean sayings: "The so-called 'sacred disease' is not more divine than others, but has a natural cause"; and "they are all divine and all human." 4 The atomistic system could not fail to come under Aristotle's general censure of systems that do not recognize a final cause; indeed he can find in it nothing more than a material cause,5 since he pays scant heed to the variety of the atoms, and utterly ignores their living character.6 He complains that the Atomists "say that motion is eternal; but what it is and why it is they do not say, nor do they explain why it is in one direction more than another." 7 But the Atomists doubtless supposed that they had supplied all the explanation that is necessary in assuming the "natural" motion of the atoms. Yet the Nois of Leucippus and the NoOs of Democritus (composed of atoms spherical in form) represent no important advance on Parmenides or Anaxagoras save as they ex- press the perpetual unfolding of the causative process. To turn, among the fragments of the encyclopedic works of Democritus, from the physical theory to his theory of conduct is to meet with something of a surprise; for the two seem quite 1 Cf.

His ethical system is a refined eudaemonism, in- culcating not the pursuit of happiness through external goods, but peace of mind or "cheerfulness" (E&amp;Ov/ily).2 An extraordi- nary number of gnomic maxims are preserved, mostly traditional in character, sometimes epigrammatic, and all of unexceptionable respectability. For our present purpose the interesting point to note is that Democritus takes for granted the freedom of the will I and man's responsibility in the achievement of Good or Evil; fate, gods, and chance play a very minor r6le.4 Intelligence is the great power that enables men to choose good rather than evil, or to con- vert evil into good.5 Such humanism has roots in the tradition of Greek poetry and of proverbial wisdom, and in sophistic criticism, rather than in physical speculation. VI In spite of the partly negative result of this inquiry into the r61es of Fate, Good, and Evil in the pre-Socratic philosophers, certain definite conclusions may be drawn. In general, the criti- cism of Plato and Aristotle is supported in so far as it denies that the predecessors of Socrates conceived of a final cause, yet these critics fail more than once to recognize the importance of certain other ideas, especially with regard to the living, divine causality which is implicit in each of the pre-Socratic systems." Such are the living, cosmogenetic god of Thales, an efficient cause, and Anaximander's conception of process and natural law, with moral implications in the survival of the fit, which Aristotle slights. Anaximenes provides both a material and a formal cause, though without ethical implications. The One God of Xenophanes is both Fate and Good; Evil is only in the world of appearance. The Pythagoreans and the mystics find Good in Limit or Proportion, with important applications not only in medicine and music but in ethics. Their religion defines the limits within which Good may 1 Scoon's attempt to connect them, pp. 225-227, is to me unconvincing; better is Bailey's account, pp. 186-214. 2 Cf. D68AI66.

Hack, pp. 144-154.</page><page sequence="44">128 William Chase Greene be realized; they discard external Fate as an all-sufficient cause. Heraclitus includes both Good and Evil, as correlatives, within a natural system which presents an analogy with primitive moral law; human good and evil, however, are related to a specifically human attitude and activity, as with the Atomists and the Stoics. The (monistic) Way of Truth of Parmenides defines a formal, but not an efficient, cause; Being is controlled by Justice, which is identified with Fate; his (dualistic) Way of Opinion deals with a mingling of opposites under the control of a divine power (alErov) who is Fate (or Justice, or Necessity). Empedocles reckons with controlled forces which though apparently equivocal are ultimately productive of Good and of Evil respectively; his religion is closely bound to his philosophy. The Novi of Anaxagoras is formal and efficient, but not final, as Plato and Aristotle point out; they criti- cize him the more severely because he superficially seems to promise more than his predecessors, yet has no better grounds for the optimism which he shares with Plato and Aristotle. Diogenes of Apollonia, however, is a full-fledged teleologist, a fact which Aristotle chooses to ignore. The Atomists are determinists within the limits of their physical philosophy; but Good and Evil are the province of a quite distinct and humanistic inquiry. More important, however, than any of the specific theories of the pre-Socratic philosophers is the fact that they unconsciously established the limits of the ethics of naturalism; this, too, Plato and Aristotle hardly sufficiently realized. For even those philoso- phers who had most conspicuously emphasized the conception of a divine, cosmogenetic principle had failed to show that the su- preme power in the world, - God, or Physis, or Fate, - has either the purpose or, except incidentally, the effect of causing Good or Evil. This is not surprising, for neither was their science based upon a sufficient empirical foundation nor had the analysis of human values gone further in their day than the naff though often beautiful conceptions of the poetic tradition from Homer to Theognis. What was needed next was, in the first place, the em- pirical pursuit of science, and, secondly, that criticism of human values on which a theory of Good and Evil must rest. And there remained the further question of man's relation to his environment.</page><page sequence="45">Fate, Good, and Evil in Pre-Socratic Philosophy I29 The sophistic movement was chiefly, though not exclusively, hu- manistic, and considered this question only casually. The scientific interests of Plato and Aristotle and the Stoics were given a teleo- logical coloring by the Socratic interpretation of Nature as anthro- pocentric, the work of a benevolent God. This is the outcome not of pre-Socratic speculation on physis but of a fusion of early Greek religion, chiefly mystical, with the a priori reasoning of such philos- ophers as Xenophanes and Parmenides and the Pythagoreans. It may be worth while to observe in conclusion that the problem of Good and Evil cannot be solved on purely a priori, metaphysical grounds, for it involves the recognition of standards of reference and of the interest of individuals. In order to say that the power in the universe is good, we must be in a position to say either that it is making the whole universe better (which manifestly can never be proved), or else that it is making better some part of the universe which we are entitled to regard as an adequate measuring rod. Practically we adopt as our measuring rod the interests of mankind, or of certain persons, and ask whether the power in the universe advances them; and since the answer is bound to be only partly in the affirmative we recognize Evil as well as Good. The problem of Evil thus has to be dismissed by metaphysics, and be- longs ultimately not to ethics (for the moral struggle is based on the premiss that there is Evil to be overcome) but to religion, where the relation of the individual to the goodness that is ex- perienced in the universe is the fundamental question. And since it involves also the frequent discrepancy between men's apparent deserts and their fortunes, there is matter, tragical or ironical, for the dramatist to explore. The treatment of Fate, Good, and Evil by the later philosophers and by Greek Tragedy I reserve for further investigation.</page></plain_text>
