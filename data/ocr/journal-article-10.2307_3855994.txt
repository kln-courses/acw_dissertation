<plain_text><page sequence="1">(I) EDITORIAL FOREWORD SINCE the appearance of the last volume of this Journal, the Society has acquired new premises-the first that have truly belonged to it-and the change from Hinde Street to Doughty Mews was affected during the autumn of I968. The move and the subse- quent decoration of the new rooms were carried out largely by the voluntary help of some of the Society's members, organized with great efficiency by our Secretary, Miss Mary Crawford. All who have inspected the premises agree that an excellent job has been done. We hope that with a home of its own the Society will flourish even more, and continue effectively to prosecute the purposes for which it was established. The last ceremonial act in the old rooms was the presentation to Professor Cerny of a specially bound copy of Volume 54 of the Journal on August 23, the day following his seventieth birthday. This happy ceremony took place in the presence of the Committee of the Society and of some of the scholars from home and abroad who had contributed essays to the volume. Fieldwork carried out by the Society's expeditions during 1968, and briefly reported in the Foreword to Volume 54, forms the subject of three reports in the present volume. During the current year, work has continued at Saqqara, and is in progress at Tell el-Fara'in at the time of writing this Foreword. In addition we were able to renew work at Qasr Ibrim in conditions which were by no means easy. On the last expedition Professor Plumley reports as follows: A further season's work at Qar Ibrim was begun on January 23, 969, and terminated on March 9. Three areas were excavated. To the south of the Great Church work was concentrated on the area immediately north of the partially excavated great stairway. This area was originally occupied by a number of buildings of various dates; but it is now evident that the great stairway once gave access to a massive stone structure which may have been the Residence of the Eparch or Deputy of the High King of Nubia, probably during the period c. 650o-II73 A.D. Beneath the so-called Residence lay the remains of walls of an earlier structure which may possibly date to the Meroitic Period. The surviving walls of this building rise to a height of approximately I *50 m. The exterior faces of these walls are mason-finished, and bear a number of symbols in relief. One of these symbols depicts an amphora in its stand; the others may be bunches of grapes. The purpose of this building is not yet clear, but the discovery of an ornamental bouquet of durra buried in a shallow pit under the level of a pavement which once surrounded this building at least suggests that it may have had some religious significance. From this area came further fragments of manuscripts written in Greek, Old Nubian, Coptic, and Arabic. A few of the texts are clearly liturgical, but most of the Old Nubian and the Arabic are letters. At least two of the Old Nubian letters are addressed to the Eparch, and possibly one or two of the earlier Arabic letters are also so addressed. Among other objects found in this area were two fine brass bowls, probably of early Mameluke date. The second area to be excavated was at the south angle of the great west fortifications of the Fortress. Here, as expected from the evidence of the short preliminary season in December I966, C 6475 B</page><page sequence="2">EDITORIAL FOREWORD the workmen uncovered the original south gate of the Fortress. There seems little doubt that this is Meroitic in origin, and that it was blocked up during the latest period of Meroitic occupation. Two blocks of stone, possibly lintel blocks, each bearing the prenomen and nomen of Taharqa, had been used to block the gateway. In the debris thrown down behind the blocking a large number of potsherds of Meroitic manufacture, and many fragments of papyri inscribed with cursive Meroitic, were found. Among the latter was one large piece of papyrus inscribed in Greek. Originally a flight of steps had led up to the gate, but this had been deliberately destroyed, probably when the blocking of the gate took place. The discovery of the Taharqa blocks encouraged the excavators to think that a temple of his time had possibly been sited not far from the blocked gate. An area a short distance to the north of the gateway was therefore investigated by means of a trench. As a result of this investigation the founda- tions of what must have been a gateway were uncovered, and an area exposed, the nature of which strongly supports the suggestion that here once stood a small temple or a large shrine. The area seems to have been systematically robbed, and it is possible that much of the great stone-work of the Church may have come from this area. The identification of a number of coins found in this area may eventually help to determine the approximate date of the final dismantling of the building which once stood here. As in many recent years, Saqqara has been the principal scene of our work in the field. Professor Emery has written the following short note on the season's work: On November 23, 968, we reopened our excavations on the site of the temple of Nectanebo II which was discovered last year. Our first task was the removal of the Christian settlement above the deliberately destroyed Pharaonic monuments which were revealed as a series of chapels built against the face of the escarpment. These chapels rest on the rubble-filled platform enclosed by the great brick enclosure, half of which has now been cleared down to the original ground level, revealing still older structures of an earlier but uncertain date. The character of these earlier buildings, which are probably contemporary with the enclosure wall, must remain unknown until further excavation is carried out. In the course of the removal of the fill of the enclosure we had expected to find the entrance to the mausoleum of Isis, Mother of Apis, but so far we have failed in our search. However, the comparative preponderance, in the inscribed material, of reference to Apis and the sacred cow leaves little doubt that the burial place is in the immediate vicinity. Throughout the clearance of the Nectanebo shrines and the fill of the enclosure numerous deposits of bronze, wood, and stone statuettes were found, the most remarkable of which was a group of three wooden shrines, hundreds of bronze statuettes, and a fine wooden figure of Osiris, in a stone-lined pit in the floor of one of the chapels. The objects, some of them wrapped in linen, were in an almost perfect state of preservation; but even more important were some Carian stelae which had been used to line the walls of the pit. Excavation behind one of the smaller chapels revealed two rough- stone retaining walls which led direct to the face of the escarpment, and a gate which did gave access to an amazing series of underground galleries in which were buried the cynocephalous baboons who, with the ibis, were sacred to Thoth and Imhotep. The animals were mummified, wrapped in linen, and placed in wooden chests which were then filled solid with gypsum plaster. The chests, with their solidified contents were then placed in sealed niches built in the sides of the galleries. These galleries, unlike those of the ibis, with which they are connected, are stone-lined and are rich in hieroglyphic and demotic graffiti, all of which have now been recorded. There was also a rich find of Carian stelae with texts in good preservation. The galleries are on two levels connected by a stairway, in the vicinity of which we discovered a two-thirds life-size statue of Isis nursing the infant Horus and two life-size statues of the sacred baboon. 2</page><page sequence="3">EDITORIAL FOREWORD The main upper gallery is terminated by a break into a Third-dynasty burial shaft. Because of the precarious condition of the rock and the shaft-filling, our attention was directed to the top of the escarpment with a view to finding the mouth of the shaft. By February 5 large-scale excavation revealed the top of the shaft and a great Third-dynasty tomb of unusual design with a superstructure measuring 52 m. X 19 m., thus being one of the largest in the archaic necropolis. A jar sealing, found with pottery in one of its ravaged magazines, bore the serekh of Neterkhet (Zoser). Work in its south burial shaft, which connects it with the baboon galleries, has had to be suspended until next season for technical reasons. On March 6 the excavations were closed down until next November when our first task will be directed to a detailed examination of this most interesting tomb and the area surrounding it. This has undoubtedly been the most successful season the Society has had since the present campaign began at Saqqara in I964, and future excavation in this area will probably be even more rewarding. The division of the antiquities discovered took place on March io and a generous share of the finds is now on its way to the United Kingdom. Reports on these two excavations and on the work at Tel el-Fara'in this year will appear in the next volume of the Journal. During the year Egyptology has suffered many sad losses. The Society particularly mourns the death of one of its honorary members, Mr. Warren Dawson, a former Treasurer; an obituary notice appears later in this volume. Dr. J. Leibovitch, also a member of the Society for many years, and a prolific writer on Egypto-Semitic subjects, died on April 4, I968. Among Egyptologists who have died in the past year, who were not members of the Society, the one probably best known to members was Dr. Williams S. Smith, Curator of Egyptian Art in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. His unexpected death on January 12, 1969, has robbed our science of one of its most learned and percipient art-historians. There are many who will remember his kindness; he was a truly generous custodian of the antiquities he supervised. Professor Giuseppe Botti, who died on September 27, 1968, will also be much missed; he had reached the advanced age of 79, but was still heavily engaged in scholarly activities. He will be especially remembered by British Egyptologists for his fruitful collaborations with T. E. Peet, Sir Alan Gardiner, and Professor Cerny. Here too we sadly record the deaths of Dr. Hans Hickmann and Dr. Irmgard Woldering. The former, a distinguished musicologist, devoted many years to an intensive study of ancient Egyptian music and musical instruments. His writings in this field will remain standard for many years to come. He died on a visit to England on September 4, I968. Dr. Woldering, the Director of the Kestner Museum, Hanover, since I955, was first and foremost a writer on Egyptian art. She died on April 24, 1969. Many Egyptian collections in the great and small museums of the world remain partly published and little known. Some institutions have made notable contributions to our science by publishing catalogues of particular categories of objects; but it is evident that much still remains to be done. Four scholars concerned with collections, Mr. Bernard Bothmer of Brooklyn, Dr. Miroslav Verner of Prague, and Dr. Karl- Heinz Priese and Dr. Steffen Wenig of East Berlin, have prepared a long document, en- titled Zur Veroffentlichung von Bestdnden dgyptischer Museen und Sammlungen, which will be published in ZAS 96 later this year. They recommend a method of slip-publication 3</page><page sequence="4">which would render all collections available to scholars in a standard form. We have been asked to draw the attention of museum curators and owners of collections of Egyptian antiquities to this document, and earnestly beg them to consider whether they can co-operate in such an enterprise. The problems involved should not be minimized; the labour of preparing slips will inevitably fall chiefly on existing museum staffs, while the value of the results will depend on the accuracy and knowledge of those same staffs. Some may think that the scheme is ideal, but impracticable. It is, however, a scheme to be discussed. No attempt to improve the present situation should be rejected without being given proper consideration. Of recent publications a special welcome should greet the first two fascicules of Ramesside Texts by Mr. K. A. Kitchen of Liverpool University. Mr. Kitchen plans to publish hand-copies of all known historical texts of the Ramesside Period, thereby making available a great mass of primary source material much of which is at present only available in copies scattered throughout Egyptological literature. The work will appear in fascicules, and it is good to learn that he has succeeded in making arrange- ments with Messrs. B. H. Blackwell of Oxford for the printing and distribution of the parts. Everyone will hope that Mr. Kitchen will have the strength and determination to see the scheme through to a successful finish. A successful finish has certainly attended the efforts of Miss Bodil Hornemann, the last two parts of whose Types of Ancient Egyptian Statuary appeared in the spring this year. The drawings of Egyptian sculpture, small and large, which make up this work provide a remarkable bank of careful information of infinite value to the student of Egyptian art. It is a work the worth of which becomes increasingly apparent with use. Miss Hornemann deserves our gratitude for completing so notably a task that has engrossed her energies for more than thirty years. We have been asked to inform readers of the Journal about another book which may be difficult to obtain through normal channels. This is Anthropomorphic Figurines of Predynastic Egypt and Neolithic Crete by Peter J. Ucko, which contains a comprehen- sive catalogue of figurines, and a discussion of their possible function. Copies can be obtained from Macfarlanes, Dowgate Hill House, London, E.C. 4, or from Dr. Ucko, ii Compayne Gardens, London, N.W. 6, price £6 6s., postage and packing extra (Britain, 5s. 6d.; elsewhere, 6s. 6d.). Among the leaflets distributed with this copy of the Journal is one advertising the new British Museum Society. The organizers hope that members of the Egypt Explora- tion Society will read this leaflet with care and sympathy. The work of our Society has since the beginning been carried out in close association with members of the staffs of the Departments of Egyptian Antiquities and of Manuscripts of the British Museum, and the M1useum is the principal repository of the antiquities and documents brought back to this country as the results of the Society's activities in Egypt and the Sudan. This association provides but one reason why we are glad to commend the new British Museum Society. Members of the Egypt Exploration Society will no doubt have many other good reasons for welcoming this opportunity to participate actively in the plans for the future development of the British Museum.
