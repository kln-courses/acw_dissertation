Institut de Mathematique Pure et Appliquee, Universit&amp; Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve 1986, 231 pp. RAY MINES, FRED RICHMAN, and WIM RUITENBURG. A course in constructive algebra. Universitext. Springer-Verlag, New York, Berlin, Heidelberg, etc., 1988, xi + 344 pp. A course in constructive algebra presents the contents of a first-year graduate course in algebra from the constructivist point of view promoted in analysis by Errett Bishop. The basic assumptions and modes of reasoning are thus consistent with intuitionistic, recursive, and classical mathematics; and though many of the exercises point out classically valid results that are constructively dubious, the text focuses on the positive development of constructive algebra rather than on the foundations of constructive mathe- matics or on constructivist criticism of classical reasoning. The book's scope is roughly that of van der Waerden's Modern algebra, volumes I and II (Frederick Ungar, 1949 and 1950). After a brief introduction to constructive reasoning and constructively valid principles in set theory and category theory, the authors devote a chapter to Rings and modules. Only later in my reading of the book did I appreciate some of the material presented here. In particular, the theory of coherent and Noetherian modules is best exploited five chapters later in the constructive treat- ment of Noetherian rings, three versions of the Hilbert basis theorem, and the Lasker-Noether theorem on primary decomposition of ideals; here much of Seidenberg's work on these subjects is presented in a new way. But before the chapter on ideal theory there are chapters devoted to unique factorization domains, principal ideal domains, field theory-including transcendental, separable, and inseparable field extensions and the fundamental theorem of Galois theory-and the factoring of polynomials. In 1930 van der Waerden pointed out that one does not necessarily have an effective method for factoring polynomials even over "discrete fields," in which one can carry out arithmetical operations and effectively determine whether or not elements of the field are equal. Constructivists therefore want to know what methods of building new fields from old preserve the existence of an effective method for factoring polynomials. Mines, Richman, and Ruitenburg give complete proofs of relevant results mentioned in van der Waerden's Modern algebra, and discuss Seidenberg's "condition P" as well as fields over which one may effectively factor separable polynomials. Next comes the chapter on Commutative Noetherian rings (already mentioned), and then chapters on Finite dimensional algebras, Free groups, and Abelian groups (including a constructive treatment of Ulm's theorem, which finally uses Chapter I's construc- tive treatment of ordinals). A chapter on real-valued valuations treats Hensel's lemma, the Gelfand- Tornheim theorem, Henselization, extensions of valuations to finite-dimensional extension fields, and ramification index and residue degree. A final brief chapter on Dedekind domains brings the book to an end. Mines, Richman, and Ruitenburg do not view their book as an introduction to abstract algebra. "The reader is presumed to have some familiarity with the classical subject" (p. viii), and would not appreciate novel treatments of various topics otherwise. The usual results of finite group theory are not proved here-despite the use of Sylow's theorem to prove that the algebraic numbers are algebraically closed (p. 190)-and Galois theory is not applied to the theory of equations. But since the classical and con- structive treatments of these subjects should be much the same, and since space is limited, the authors have good reason to omit them. The book also lacks an analogue of van der Waerden's chapter on real fields, although nine-year-old work of Delzell yields a constructive solution to Hilbert's seventeenth problem over the reals. But "the more advanced topics have been dictated by our preferences and limitations" (p. vii), and against a chapter on real fields the authors may place their chapters on free groups and infinite Abelian groups. One may therefore say that the books have comparable scope. And for better or worse, the present book reads like an ordinary algebra textbook: abstract defini- tions, mysterious lemmas, and clever proofs follow one after the other, and only some of the examples and exercises reveal that classical reasoning is not allowed (e.g. "Show that E and 0(i) constitute a Brouwerian example of splitting fields for x2 + 1 over k that are not isomorphic over k," a discrete subfield of 0(i), p. 153). I found the authors' constructive treatment of field theory and ideal theory</page><page sequence="2">884 REVIEWS much more efficient than the constructive treatments already in print; and even for this reason alone, I would recommend A course in constructive algebra to anyone interested in constructive mathematics. For whom is the book intended? The preface traces the current "renaissance" in "the constructive approach to mathematics" to the appearance of Bishop's book and to "the subtle influences of the proliferation of powerful computers" that have (among other things) stimulated "the study of constructive algebra for actual implementation." But the book gives no clear assistance to those who want to factor polynomials or to compute Galois groups of equations with the help of computers. After presenting certain results of Kronecker's on effective factorization of polynomials, the authors admit that they "are not concerned here with the efficiency of these algorithms" (p. 127); "Kronecker 1," for example, is exponential over Z (cf. S. Landau, SlAMjournal on computing, vol. 14 (1985), pp. 184-195). And much of the chapter on factoring polynomials is inspired by results of Kronecker and van der Waerden, who also did not pretend to give practical methods of factorization. One cannot rule out the possibility that this work will produce actual algorithms just as one cannot rule out the possibility that Bishop's work will influence numerical analysis but I know of no guarantee that effective methods of solving problems will yield feasible methods. So it is difficult to judge whether students of computer algebra will benefit more from this work than they would from the study of classical algebra. Another possible audience for the book consists of readers interested in the mathematics of sheaves, or in topoi. Because one may view the topos of all sheaves over a topological space as a category of sets in which intuitionistic rather than classical logic holds, one may interpret many theorems of constructive mathematics in sheaf categories to reach conclusions about sheaves. One must say 'many,' rather than 'all,' because constructivists have traditionally assumed certain versions of the axiom of choice that do not hold in all sheaf categories. Although the authors point out this problem (pp. 33-34), and make some effort in the end-of-chapter notes to identify uses of dependent choice (see pp. 107, 126-127), readers hoping to avoid certain forms of the axiom of choice must really track down its appearances themselves. They would have found the book much easier to use if the authors had marked those theorems depending on choice with an asterisk. But since it says nothing more about topoi and constructive mathematics than what has already been mentioned, readers interested in the subject must do extra work anyway. The most obvious audience for the book consists of those with an interest, either casual or serious, in the constructive philosophy of mathematics; and the book unfortunately contains passages that will annoy devotees and mystify the curious. The authors try to explain the constructive point of view by "pictur[ing] an idealized mathematician U interacting with the mathematical universe;... 'there exists' and 'you can find' mean that U can carry out the indicated constructions." With "an omniscient U," the picture is "a more dynamic, anthropomorphic portrayal of classical mathematics," while "the picture that results when we restrict U to finite computations is the computational interpretation of mathematics" (pp. 1-2). One thus obtains constructive mathematics from classical mathematics by replacing an omniscient mathematician by a less observant one; each reports, as best he can, on "the mathematical universe" (p. 1) that both inhabit. This variant of constructive mathematics would seem to validate Markov's principle, which says that if P(x) is a decidable property of natural numbers, and if one can derive a contradiction from the assumption that P(x) fails for all natural numbers x, then P must be true of some natural number n. For if "the mathematical universe" can serve the needs of classical as well as constructive mathematicians, it is a matter of fact whether or not some natural number obeys P. If one can derive a contradiction from the assumption that P(x) fails for all x, and if one's current mathematical knowledge is true, then some x must, as a matter of fact, obey P, and even a mathematician capable only of "constructions that are finite in nature" (p. 2) will find x by testing 0, 1, 2,... successively for the decidable property P. Given so simple an argument for Markov's principle which the Russian school of constructivists accepts one cannot help being surprised when the authors reject it: "An argument against Markov's principle is that we have no prior bound, in any sense, on the length of the computation required to construct n. We regard Markov's principle as an omniscience principle" (p. 33). (For the authors, "an omniscience principle is a classically true statement [of a special kind] which is considered not to have a constructive proof," p. 4). Yet if an idealized mathematician can find n in a finite number of steps, the absence of an a priori bound on the number of steps says nothing against Markov's principle. One certainly can challenge the last paragraph's argument. It is blocked right at the start if one does not admit a mathematical universe common to both classical and constructive mathematics: if one does not admit that there are matters of fact about numbers, other than the results already proved in the ongoing</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 885 construction of mathematics. And even if one does not reject the universe of classical mathematics, strict insistence on a constructive reading of the logical constants may induce one to reject Markov's principle (see pp. 21-22, pp. 246-247 of Dummett's Elements of intuitionism, XLIV 276). But the authors do not equip their readers to understand such challenges. The view that constructive mathematics is a myopic version of classical mathematics may also have encouraged the authors to avoid certain non-classical notions, such as non-extensional operations between sets. According to Bishop (Bishop and Bridges, Constructive analysis, LII 1047, p. 15), a function is an operation-a rule for computing values from arguments-that sends equal arguments to equal values. Yet he also admits operations that are not functions. Suppose, for example, that real numbers are presented as Cauchy sequences {x, 1nt= of rationals such that Ix - xI &lt; m-' + n -' for all m, n &gt; 1, and two such sequences {x,}, {yj are equal (as real numbers) if and only if lxn - yn &lt; 2n-' for all n ? 1. Although there is an operation f: R (-+ that sends {xn} = l to Ix, l, f is not a function since equal reals may be assigned different rationals. Classically, one avoids such non-extensional operations f by distinguishing between the set of Cauchy sequences of rationals on which f is an extensional function from the set of reals, which are equivalence classes, under the equality relation, of Cauchy sequences. Constructively, however, there may be reason to stick with the Cauchy sequences and to admit non-extensional operations as Bishop did (Bishop and Bridges, p. 65). Yet Mines, Richman, and Ruitenburg choose to avoid this non-classical notion, and remark that "in almost all applications, one can consider an operation from a set A to a set B to be a function from A to the set of nonempty subsets of B" (pp. 31-32). Though the choice between non-extensional operations and equivalence classes may seem of little moment, the authors themselves present a theorem "where Bishop's notion of an operation from A to B cannot be interpreted as a function from A to the set of nonempty subsets of B" (p. 231). Their treat- ment of the theorem Jonathan Tennenbaum's version of the Hilbert basis theorem does not use operations, however; the authors simply remark that "the original scope and spirit of Tennenbaum's result can be retrieved" if one ignores one function and treats another as an operation. But since Tennenbaum's work has never been published, readers interested in the possible usefulness of operations have no way of judging the route taken by Mines, Richman, and Ruitenburg. Why do they mention operations if they refuse to present one of the few arguments in which operations may play an interesting role? Students of constructive mathematics will certainly want to know whether the constructivist philosophy provides new fundamental notions with mathematically interesting applications. Even if one wants to follow the classical procedure and make function the fundamental notion, a direct presentation of Tennenbaum's results in an appendix would have provided a genuine service to the people most likely to read this book. One might answer these foundational criticisms as well as other more technical ones by saying that the algebra is more important than the philosophy. Just as Bishop lamented Brouwer's "preoccupation with the philosophical aspects of constructivism at the expense of concrete mathematical activity" (Bishop and Bridges, p. 8), and urged a "straightforward realistic [i.e., constructive] approach to mathematics" (ibid., p. 13), so Mines, Richman, and Ruitenburg might declare that their goal is the presentation of constructive algebra with as little philosophical fuss as possible, and that my criticisms are therefore irrelevant. But since the authors' choice of material and method of presentation make their book most useful to readers concerned with the constructive philosophy of mathematics, I do not think it unreasonable to demand a more adequate account of this philosophy. Certainly the book is about algebra, rather than philosophy, but the algebra is pursued with a special philosophy in mind. In closing I will mention practical problems I experienced when reading the book. Apparently theorems were renumbered between drafts: in Chapter VI, for example, I found seven incorrect references to other results, and Section VII.3 has two different names. After encountering such errors, I began to check references to earlier theorems whenever I read a proof. Such caution was not usually necessary, but it did slow down my reading. The authors also decided to change the meanings of certain terms employed by previous writers. An "inequality" on a set is just a binary relation on the set (p. 8); the inequality need have none of the properties one associates with the negation of equality or with apartness. Because a division ring is a ring (with inequality) in which unequal elements are those whose difference is invertible, any ring becomes a division ring under a suitable inequality (pp. 41-42). Also, 'onto' (p. 10) and 'countable' (p. 11) receive definitions different from those given by Bishop. Although the definitions of inequality and division ring may seem bizarre, the authors of a book certainly have the right to choose</page><page sequence="4">886 REVIEWS those definitions that prove most convenient throughout the book; and there are at least two places (pp. 77, 98) where the weak notion of inequality seems natural. The changes in set-theoretic terminology proved annoying because my reading of later chapters occasionally had to be interrupted while I re- viewed Chapter 1. But only readers of some of the earlier constructivist literature will have this problem. To sum up: read the book, but be aware of its shortcomings. PHILIP SCOWCROFT</page></plain_text>
