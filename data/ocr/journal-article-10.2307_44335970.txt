So I went over myself with the baby oil and stood up starkers for him. Showing the plaster off to the best advantage. I'm leaning on a walking stick like an old granny. Round my neck is a plaster collar so that my head is tipped back a little and I'm looking down my nose. Some people might say I always look down my nose. My left foot is in plaster and the whole of my left leg, shin, knee, and thigh, is wrapped in a tight white bandage. Just now, apart from the plaster, my body is in good shape and I'd like a photo so that when I'm wrinkled and scaly I can say, yup, that was me, very slim, very elegant, hip bones jutting. And by God she was brave. Really I'm a bit shaky but I don't let Thelonious see that. He's using black and white because if you're going to be recorded naked and up to the hilt in plaster you should go for Romance, bring out the film star aspect. Colour, and I could look holiday snapped and I'm not having that. Behind me, framed in dusty gilt is a tangle of nymphs and blood, wrappers of red silk and waves. I think it's a shipwreck but no one's quite sure. We've had it for centuries and its murky with varnish. I want it in the photo because its a note of doom, all those flying limbs about to disappear forever, faint cries in the briny, and I'm stiff and straight and not really Playboy, just frank and staring, naked and temporary, thinking about death because I've had a close shave and because that's the nature of photos. A survivor but for how long? The last of a long line. I've always been the subject, not the photographer, but Thelonious is a professional. Being second cousin to an Ashmorland gives Him an entree. When he's through I let him help me back into bed, and he tents me into a brushed cotton floral night dress, very sweet and homely, and tucks me up. They've made me a bed on the Japanese couch that great great grandfather William brought back from his travels. It's underneath the drowning picture and to the right of the chandelier. I'm very precise about this because at the moment I'm blind. Lizzie Snelling brings me coffee and Thelonious eats biscuits and packs away his gear. 'Brilliant, you were brilliant.' Tut some music on, darling.' 'What would you like?' 'Jazz.' Thelonious is sweet, my only friend. I've never really clicked with people of my own age. Maybe because I'm an only child, and beautiful, and more royal than royalty. Thelonious takes my hand and I have a feeling he's crying because the biscuit munching seems soggy. He sniffs. 'For Heaven's sake.' T know. Only . . .'</page><page sequence="3">6 CS &lt;u H S-I &lt;2 V c o X o u u RS OJ js w CS J3 'Only what?' 'You were so lucky.' For two months I'm confined to the house. My eyes are a lot better now but I'm not allowed to read. Thelonious comes every day and reads to me. He's been taking me through my childhood. Dante's Inferno, The Odyssey, Gulliver's Travels and Don Quixote. Great Aunt Jessicca taught me to read when I was three then the library was at my disposal. A strict diet of racism, paternalism, anthropomorphism. Why didn't / get Roald Dahl? The physio comes in the morning and pummels me about and makes me do exercises, cat stretches for my back and raising my legs from the hip. In the afternoons I have shiatsu massage and aromotherapy. Its all quite gentle really and presumably doing the trick but, while my body is getting better, the Big Question still looms large. I went over to Uncle Bobby's old place once and it was full of Transcendental Meditation salesmen. The battlements were floodlit with security lights, crenellated and Disney as ever but the basement was humming with computers. The centre of The New World Government. I asked Uncle Bobby, 'What goes on past the door in the basement? The one marked strictly no entry, flying in progress.' 'The computers are programmed,' he said, 'to meditate for peace. At all hours of the day they are praying on our behalf, bringing a stop to war.' There was a man with a gun doing patrols at night. I was walking in the grounds, watching the rabbits and listening to the evening, when he came right by me and fired a shot. When I was sure he'd gone, I belted home in the Jag. It shows what can happen if you don't make an effort. Ashmoorland Towers has been in my family since we built it in the 15th Century. It's where I was born, the east turret bedroom to be precise, and where I want to die. I want my bones to go in with all my forbears; in the mausoleum and under the motto. With Love They Keep Perpetual Tryst. A week ago I cancelled the hunt. There was a bit of a stir in the local press, indignation at the Banford Bugle, but enough's enough. I've always hated the hunt, ever since I was six and came across the Reynolds in the back Orangery. Two young women gaze out, limpid is the word that springs to mind: such satiny dresses, such delicate lace and pale white hands. They're holding each other, frail and clinging, sad, except that behind them is the usual greensward, Grecian statutes and rippling brook and, down in one corner, nearly hidden by the spread of their pink frocks, a fox is being casually ripped apart by a pack of hounds. I had the man round from Sothebys and told him to get rid. I can do what I like now. Heritage is a possibility but that means savage fun fair rides, Vampire and Wild Water, and maybe a rhino or two and I'm definitely not into transplanting a lot of semi extinct beasts to plod around the lawns. Zoos have always upset me. I saw Guy the Gorilla once, poor thing, quite mad, his eyes so piercing and helpless. T f 1 made a call while having elevenses. Lizzie Snelling has got herself a cappuccino machine and has taken to baking pain au chocolat. Thelonious</page><page sequence="4">came to the phone, very distant at first, because he was working. I could hear his bird squawking and pecking at the handset. He's developed a stoop to accommodate it and it clings to his shoulder like something out of Treasure Island and drops parrot shit all over his studio. The clients love it. 'How was the photo?' 'You look truly ravishing, darling.' 'Do it as a postcard. Have printed on the back, Lady Antonia Ashmorland invites you to take tea and discuss money.' I looked perfect. Haughty and aristocratic, my pubic hair very dark and definite just above the bandage. I sent it to the heads of the ailing British Film Industry. Lizzie Snelling laid out the back Orangery because after the Reynolds was out of the way it was really rather cozy, with wonderful views. You could take in the folly on the distant hill top, the ruined chapel, the gazebo and the oak woodland. Lizzie hired a French chef to come and do tricky things with cream and dark chocolate, minuscule portions, presentation is all. I threw handfuls of blood red nasturtiums and big white lilies over the sandwiches. Interflora brought in tubs, oranges and lemons, real oranges, not plastic, and I had the heating turned on. All afternoon, they rolled up the drive in their blacked out chauffeur driven limos. 'Think of the possibilities,' I said. The Orangery turned blue with cigar smoke and I strutted up and down with my stick and my plaster foot, my neck at an elegant angle, dressed this time. Black lycra cat suit and a silver crucifix on a chain. Vermilion lipstick. 'Come. I'll show you the dungeons?' The film industry took off again. Well, you'll know that now. You'll remember all those classics; Royal Flush, Virgin Throne. We had the Russian Revolution in the drawing room and Oliver Cromwell on the staircase. The place was full of aged retainers, butlers, and great Danes. Headless ghosts in the turrets and bodies in the moat. Of course the commuting newcomers hated it all. It lowered the tone just when they'd taken out a mortgage and hoisted themselves into Ye Olde Merry England, but the real locals came up out of their benders and their mobile homes and did sterling work as extras. The Assistant Director said he didn't want anybody acting as they'd got real actors to do that and they were paying them a fortune. Soon I was the darling of the media world, Lady Toni, always being interviewed and on the box. Thelonious would come with me, and the bird. We did a double act, chat shows and late night line-ups and all the time we raised money. It snowballed in. The films got more and more extravagant. Then I had my breakdown. Delayed shock, they said. After all I'd lost both my parents in the crash and my leg still wasn't right. I had a slight paralysis down the side of my face and occasional blurred vision. Dreams. I had such bad dreams. When I recovered, the recession had set in. They wanted tightly shot tv movies, streetwise sagas about football hooligans or inner city riots. Battlements and dignity were out. Morals were the thing in the nineties and stately English homes stank of decadence. I asked Lizzie Snelling to do them another tea and told them all to go. Hovis and peanut butter. 'Have to anyway,' they said. 'We were just off.' Bad times and my dreams were still with me. That old familiar closing in 7 a v h t2 V c o ac o u . u a u &lt;L&gt; m ČÍ J3</page><page sequence="5">8 es &lt;u h u £ ŽT G O B o u u 03 X! S-i &lt;L&gt; -g cS cu feeling was there all the time. Nature wanting to come in and take over. That's what the dreams were really. It was only one dream, just lots of variations. Bare towers poking up, black branches rustling and fingering the sky, their trunks hidden in the walls. Sycamores mostly, seedlings, clambering and taking hold, creepers and ivy you could swing in, birds nesting on every ledge. And me sitting on a crumbling beam watching it all fall away, listening to the mouths of insects and the wrapping round of roots. When I woke in the morning I'd look over my room, expecting to see bones left behind by foxes or a feather in the grate. I drank Lapsang Souchong out of my little silver cup, my christening present. It's not practical for drinking out of because the silver gets hot too quickly and the handle is thin but it's pretty and it's Russian and was given to my great grandfather by one of the Russian Royals who was forced to do a bunk. On the bottom is the date 1868, one hundred years before I was born. I was looking at this and thinking about Lizzie Snelling's boys who'd popped over to help her clear the place up, Che, after Guevara and Leon after Trotsky, when an idea came into my head. This time I arranged myself in a Edwardian nightdress, very high at the neck, little pearl buttons and frills at the wrist. No flesh. I put my hair up then let it wisp down a little. I'd rag-rolled over the walls with antique green which gave it a nice mouldy mildewed look and touched up the woodwork with a spot of burnt umber in the Dulux. White should never be white but always off white. One of the set designers had impressed that on me early on, I think when they were making The Lady of the Lake. Thelonious puffed a bit of dry ice discreetly and I leant against an old piano, looking vague and dreamy with the rag rolling in the background. Evelyn Waugh, E. M. Forster, and a touch of Virginia Woolf, not enough to be frightening. There was a fox standing at my feet, very pally, grinning up at me. I knew that would appeal because most of the locals were hunt saboteurs. What they wouldn't know of course was that really it was a grisly piece of taxidermy dragged out of the nursery attic and Thelonious had to do clever things under his enlarger to change the beastly thing's expression. On the back of the postcard I wrote, three, four, and five bedroom apartments available, FREE. Some conversion work necessary. Own allotments. Skill-sharing essential. First come, first served. I got Lizzie's boys to take them round. And it worked a treat. What lets most communes down, I gather, is the skill sharing. Not much use if everyone is offering yoga, massage, and self healing through meditation. I was very particular about the quality on the conversion work because it was part of my final plan, and made sure that it all blended in with the original brickwork and went to quite some lengths putting in new stained glass and a few dories wherever we had to built a new wall. When the whole place was sorted, we were given an award by the Society of British Architects and I had to make a speech about incorporating traditional values. The C.B.I, commissioned a study and there was a tv documentary and a four page piece in Good Housekeeping. We were a hive of industry, literally; bees are absolutely essential for our Heroic English Apple Orchard, Melcombe Russet, Gascoyne's Scarlet, Glory of England, Lemon Pippin and a dozen others, all resurrected or bio-</page><page sequence="6">engineered. We make jams, jellies, potions, ambrosia, cider, honey of course, bees wax candles - which do very well because of the revival of Christianity in Eastern Europe - and, on the side, mainly in the South wing, we have financial consultancy, computer graphics, and Creative Writing courses for the new leisure class. I asked Lizzie Snelling to do another one of her teas and Thelonious took another picture, this time of our oldest resident, Lizzie's grandmother, all blind eyes and wrinkles, gap teeth, the salt of the earth. I still sometimes need my walking stick so naturally I'm leaning on it and bending over the grandmother, very beautiful and Florence Nightingale. I sent it to Chas and Di. We sat in the back orangery and ate Sainsbury's iced fancies and Mr Kipling's custard tarts. I gave them the PR talk about a multi-faceted society, about how I may still be a parasite and summon the man from Sothebys when I run a bit short, but, when I go, I leave behind a community that works, that is growing and alive. Maybe that justifies it. I hope so, I gave them my best smile and waved a hand. 'So,' I said sweetly to Charlie. 'Buck House. Just think. How about it?*</page></plain_text>
