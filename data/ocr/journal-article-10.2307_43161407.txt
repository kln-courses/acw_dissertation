<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Fantastic World of Ants. Herbert Molloy Mason, Jr. 120pp. $5.95. David McKay Company, Inc., 750 Third Ave., New York City 10017. 1974, (Grade 5 and ud) This account of the ant world is outstanding in its readability. It tells its story so vividly that it is hard to put the book down. Included are the harvester ants, the agri- cultural farmers of the insect world; the para- sol or leaf cutting ants; the Argentine ants, the fire ants, the carpenter ants, and the army ants. The book is enriched with passages from some of the myrmecologists who have added to our knowledge of the behavior of ants. Frequent reference is made to the methods used for investigating these insects. A concluding chapter, "The Joy of Ants," invites the reader to engage in "ant ranching" by building an observation nest. The occasional anthropomorphic crediting of ants with more sensibility and intelligence than they possess is forgivable because of the intention to emphasize exceptional char- acteristics in ants. This book should make its readers head for the nearest field or forest to search for these tascinating insects. Julius Schwartz 52 SCIENCE and CHILDREN</page></plain_text>
