The exca vations in Huechil, one of Loltun's sinkholes and na tural rock shelters, have provided the earliest arch aeological remains yet found on the Yucatán peninsula. The caves of Loltun are found in the range of hills known as the Puuc, seven miles south of Oxkutzcab, Yu catán. The site is located at 89 28' longitude and 20 15' latitude (Figure 1). The caves abound in archaeological elements left by those who inhabited the région throughout the centu ries prior to the Spanish conquest in the sixteenth INAH SEP 0 50 100 200 Figure 1 Century. Among these are found numerous paintings which represent styles that vary from rock paintings created by a hunting and collecting society (ca. 2C00 B.C.) to pictorial représentations of personages and cartouches with Maya numeráis which correspond to the ' Maya hieroglyphs of the Classic Period (300 A.D.-900 A.D.). In addition, abundant rock carvings are found that span a long chronological sequence.

To one side of the présent day entrance to the cave i s found a low relief sculpture known as "El Guerrero" (The Warrior) which has been dated to late Preclassic timés on the basis of stylistic similarities with Cycle 8 carvings from the Petén (Proskouriakoff 1950) and with Izapan monuments further south. In particular, the Lol tun relief shows strong similarities to the Izapan style stela 11 of Kaminaljuyú (Norman 1976; A. P. An drews, n.d.; cf. Quirarte 1973 for a further discussion of the Izapa style.). The research project at Loi tun is supervised by the archaeologist Norberto Gonzalez Crespo, director of the Centro Regional del Sureste of the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia; the field work is done by a group of specialists headed by the author. The material which until now has been obtained indi cates that the caves of Loi tun were occupied by groups of people for long and continuous periods; this is evi denced by the material dating from preceramic periods until the Spanish conquest. This important occupational sequence was discovered due to the unusually deep Sedi ment and the relative lack of altérations in the various levels (Figure 3). Figure 3 Altough excavation pits were dug in a number of différ ents areas of the caves, those in the area called "Hue chil" provided the most detailed cultural sequence. The ceramic levels contain elements dating from the beginning of the Postclassic Period to the Early Preclassic Period. ßelow these levels were found great quantities of silex chips and artifacts, these levels being purely precera mic. The -latter material has provided the first evidence of human occupation during cultural periods prior to the invention of pottery, thereby constitut.ing the first dis covery of preceramic material in the northern région of the Yucatan peninsula. The earliest strata of the pits are characterized by remains of pleistocene fauna confirming the existence of mastodon, horse, bison, felines, deer and a large variety of rodents in Yucatán. Among these, the most surprising find was that of the mastodon, which estab lished for the first time the existence of this species in our région. Beneath the ceramic levels there occurs a great cultur al change well demonstrated by both the characteristics of the strata as well as the archaeological elements. A large quantity of silex instruments and debris were found in cultural context. Outstanding among these are the cut ting and percussion instruments. In addition, a good num ber of bone instruments was found directly associated with remains of pleistocene megafauna, principally the horse (Equus conversidens) and animais now extinct. A radiocarbon date taken from the uppermost level of the preceramic Stratum, thus dating the cultural change, has provided us with the date of 1805 B.C. * 150 years for the end of the preceramic phase in the northern part of the Yucatan peninsula. Within the ceramic levels we have obtained information that establishes a long period of occupation during the Preclassic Period. Pottery from the Early Preclassic has been found for the first time in stratigraphie cop text. Based on its characteristics of manufactures and finish ing, this pottery is related to Early and Middle Preclas sic pottery from a wide area including the Gulf Coast, Chiapas and the Central Highlands of Mexico. The earli est pottery from Loi tun may then be dated as terminal Early Preclassic between 1200 and 900 B.C. The previously established ceramic sequence for the north of the peninsula dated the earliest ceramics around 600 B.C., a date which also served to mark the earliest Settlements in northern Yucatan. In 1958, Brainerd pub lished a ceramic sequence based on the ceramic collec tions of the Carnegie Institute and then proposed the existence of an Early Preclassic pottery complex, re presented by his Mani Cenote type. Twenty years later, R. Smith reinterpreted and reformulated Brainerd's work and established the Early Preclassic Ecab Complex for Yucatan, based on one type, Yotholin Pattern-burnished: Yotholin variety, which is équivalent to the Mani Ceno te pottery. Due to these circumstances, the Early Preclassic pottery excavated in Loltun is of great archaeological import ance by providing the necessary evidence which permits us to extend back the dates of the earliest human occu pation in this région of the Yucatán. This material has enabled us to re-establish the Ecab complex with a grea ter number of types, ail of which have been found in well defined stratigraphy. Refererices : Alvarez, Ticul and O.
