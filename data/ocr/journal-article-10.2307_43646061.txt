<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MINOAN DRAGON by M. A. V. Gill (Plates I &amp; II) From a study of the archaeological remains, it is evident that the majority of the more advanced civilizations of the ancient world in their consideration of the relationship between the super- natural and man, acknowledged the existence of benevolent and malignant spirits as well as gods. The former tended to be regarded as species rather than individual daemons, and responsible for specific benefits or evils in the everyday life of a man and his household. The friendly endowed protection or more constructive advantage, others were regarded as sources of illness and similar bad luck. The attitude of the gods on the other hand was not so well defined, being variable according to or in spite of the actions of mankind: the divine, like the elements, could be both kind and dangerous. Evidence for this generalization derives as much from contemporary literature, dedications, ritual instructions and magical incantations, as from art. Apotropaic and prophylactic charms often expressed what the artist feared to depict. Since physical repre- sentation of a malignant spirit was thought as dangerous as the spirit itself, to portray one except in subjection to a divine champion, or according to exorcistic prescripts for safeguarding house and person, was to court misfortune.^ For the Minoans and Mycenaeans not only are the relative inscriptional documents lacking, but, with the exception of three late ivories from Enkomi,^ there are no examples in art of conflicts involving a fabulous beast with an anthropomorphic opponent, human or divine, and no models have been found in circumstances suggestive of a custom similar to that noted by Woolley at Ur. The negative evidence on this matter of context would seem to indicate the improbability of any of the strange creatures, that roam so uninhibited on seal and fresco, falling into the category of malig- nant daemon. Nor from their external appearance, however repulsive to modern eyes, can anything safely be deduced of the monsters' characters; forms hateful to one civilization may be symbols of affection in another. The Minoans and Mycenaeans no doubt had their share of fearsome genii, it would be incredible to assume otherwise. They knew their effects, imagined their shapes, rarely spoke of them except in hushed whispers accompanied by sacred signs to ward off any ensuing evil, and preferred to abstain altogether from physical representation rather than take the risk of provoking misfortune. Of the fabulous beasts that were depicted on seal-stone and impression, on vase and fresco, on ornament of gold, glass and ivory, three sources may be detected. Some are based on natural Q animals exotic or rare in the Aegean, some are borrowings or adaptations of foreign composite beings ^ and a few are the creations of the native imagination. ^ Most monsters of human invention are conglomerations, natural parts unnaturally combined, their horror or beauty dependent upon the harmony of composition and the qualities donated by the individual member. The head of the sphinx for example, raises it above the brutish status of the griffin in the eyes of those for whom, the human form is that most worthy of divine incarnation. As attendant of the deity it is fitting</page><page sequence="2">that the griffin should borrow its corporeal parts from the eagle and lion, the noblest representatives of bird and beast. Even the extraordinary assembly of grotesques created at Zakro are based on distortion of nature, and incongruous union of plant and animal. The normal human imagination cannot conceive or understand except in terms of its own experience. In the attempt to visualize a fantasy, it automatically draws on the actual, however surrealistic the combination, exaggeration or distortion so created. The introduction of a foreign artistic motif, whether natural animal or invented monster, may be effected by hearsay, by direct copying of representations, or by a combination of the two. By word of mouth the original is described in terms of animals or other objects known to the receptor. The final result may bear little relationship to the prototype and cannot always be distinguished from an indigenous creation.® When it is a picture of the exotic monster that a local artist copies, the derivation is still recognisable despite modification in shape; but unless that picture was accompanied by a verbal explanation, the result will be a stage further removed from nature, and the individual features may be indescribable in terms of comparison with natural forms. As more specimens of the Minoan 'Babylonian dragon' are being discovered and recognised, so its physical characteristics are becoming clearer. Its elongated tubular body, marked with length- 7 .... . ft wise bands and rows of dots or dashes, terminates .... in a tail curling high . over the back. The paws are large, the legs stout, ^ the long sturdy neck supports a disproportionately small head, characterized by erect rudimentary ears set well back and slender beak-like jaws.^® The majority of the Minoan dragons correspond exactly with this description; in only a few instances are there deviations from the pattern. ^ In terms of comparison with other animals the dragon is strangely elusive of definition because its direct prototype is not in nature but in art, and like a translation of a translation bears but distant resemblance to the original. The exact details of the Meso- potamian serpent-griffin, the horned snake's head, scaled body, scorpion tail, eagle claws and lion paws have been lost in transit through Syria to the Aegean, but its profile, proportions and function in its new habitat make Levi's thesis of the dragon's origin certain. This scholar's articles are the only comprehensive ones taking into account all the then recognised illustrations of the animal. Other writers tend to quote individual examples; consequently their theories, seemingly valid in the single case, collapse when applied to the remainder. The Dendra glass plaques (no. 12) have perhaps promoted the most discussion; they are an unfortunate basis for any hypothesis, being badly weathered and inadequately published with obscure photographs and conflicting drawings. With justified scepticism Hampe refused to narrow his definition further than 'an animal'. ^ The case for identifying the quadruped as a bull was 1 1 in the first place based on the preconception that the scene should depict the Europa myth; whether or no the later commentators agree with the mythological interpretation, several of them were in accord with this identification of the animal. Of those who contested the idea, Matz firmly declared it a lion,^ and Levi^® supported by Papademetrios^ and Orlandos^"® concluded that the motif on the H. Triada sealing 'refuted the argument that, excluding the possibility of a horse, the quadruped of the plaques must be a bull. Evidently it may also be a fantastic creature.' The unearthing of the Mycenaean lentoid (no. 13) brought confirmation that the goddess with uplifted arms riding side-saddle on the weird monster was a standard iconographical design, if a rare one, and was not limited to Crete alone. It is more probable that the motif on the Dendra plaques should correspond in all details to the other examples than that it should differ in this one matter of the animal's identity. The dozen or so illustrations from which the general characteristics in the previous paragraph were drawn, confound any suggestion that the breed has either a b ull or a 2</page><page sequence="3">lion as its ancestor. The Minoans knew only too well the anatomy of these animals, in spite of the latter being extinct from the island. On the other hand the horse, when first introduced must have been a strange sight for the insular craftsmen. Hood,^ drawing analogy with the elongated proportions of early Anatolian representations of horses, contended that the Minoan monsters were likely to be equine. He excluded the Extraordinary creature' of the H.Pelagia cylinder (no.16) that 'looks neither like a horse nor like any other known animal real or imagined', an understandable exception in view of its modern manufacture. Against Hood's theory is the consistency with which the legs are portrayed terminating not in hooves but in paws. One artist might be forgiven the error on brief acquaintance with the new animal, but the mistake was unlikely to have been repeated* Several authors have applied the name 'griffin' to the animal on the Mycenaean lentoid (and presumably to all like it).^ To accept this terminology would give rise to ambiguity and confusion, for the Minoan artistic repertoire already possesses the normal winged griffin with lion's body and crested head of a bird; also a wingless variety that appears on the Knossos throne^oom frescoes, identical but for the lack of wings. Were there only a single example of the dragon it could pass as a whimsical version made by an eccentric artist; but the dozen or so showing common characteristics prove it a creature distinct from all other sacred beasts. In an earlier paragraph I have mentioned the means by which an iconographical figure might be transferred to an alien culture, and shown how the relationship between the shape of the Minoan dragon and that of the Babylonian in its native habitat, corresponds to the relationship of any secondary representation to its original, when the transcription is based solely on visual repro- duction without a detailed verbal explanation. That this apparent similarity between the two animals is not a matter of chance, but of derivation, is mad e more certain by other similarities of context and association, and the opportunities for such a transfer of motifs and ideas. ^ Why the serpent-dragon (or ug-hu 'lion-bird' as it is called on an Akkadian cvlinder seal^) should have been adopted in preference to the more popular 'spewing dragon is not easy to explain, unless the latter's physical resemblance to the griffin prevented its recognition as an independent species.^ The earliest Minoan example of the dragon belongs to the second palace period, but we may conjecture that like the griffin, sphinx and Minoan genius, its introduction dates back to the initial phase of the first palace period when there is evidence of communication between all the lands of the Eastern Mediterranean, with the coastal cities of Syria - such as Byblos and Ugarit - as the chief entrepots, and an atmosphere in Crete particularly receptive to new ideas. Through Syrian intermediaries the Minoans came in contact with the dragon, learnt its physical appearance (though not an explanation of its anatomical details) and of its associations with the deities. They perceived that the sacred animal performed the task of transporting the god, but there is no indication that this action in Crete implied the submission of a previously opposing force. Any demonic qualities the dragon may originally have possessed in Mesopotamia faded in transit. The manner in which the Cretan goddess rode side-saddle on the dragon is not one normal to Mesopotamian art. Here the gods sit on thrones supported by sacred animals or stand directly 97 on the creatures' backs. In Egypt likewise riding figures are rare, and usually represent messengers or Asiatics; the 'image of the Syrian goddess, completely draped, who rides sidewise 3</page><page sequence="4">on a horse' recognised by Levi on the wall of the Great Temple at Karnak,^® is a misappre- hension - the figure is yet another of the bearded foreigners. However, although the introduction of the horse into Egypt and Crete was late and the riding of this animal rare in the one country and unknown in the other until towards the end of the Minoan civilization, donkeys were for centuries the beast of burden. If we find representations of them in Egypt only as pack animals, that is because to carry human beings lay outside their recognised function, and if in Crete representations are practically non-existent, that is because they did not fall within the category of animals and scenes thought appropriate to glyptic and mural art. But since we can be certain that they were used in Crete for transporting goods, ^we may be equally sure that the donkeys on occasion carried also the weary master or his wife. The way she rode would have been as all women on the island have ridden ever since - mounted side-saddle. For the practical Minoan, the idea of a throne balanced precariously on the back of an animal would be absurd, and to stand on the back of one perhaps absurder still;^ if the goddess was to ride at all, she would do so after the manner of the Cretan women. The association of the dragon with papyrus stalks on one of the H. Triad a sealings led 01 Levi to discuss the possibility of an Egyptian source for the dragon itself. He comments rightly that the serpent-griffin is foreign to Egypt, but the examples quoted to illustrate its introduction in the New Kingdom from the Near East are invalid. They are in fact normal griffins, which have a long if sparse Egyptian ancestry dating back to archaic times. As for the example from Beni-Hasan, selected as bearing the closest resemblance to the Cretan, it is neither griffin nor dragon, but another composite beast -the serpent-necked feline, and likewise of early dynastic origin.^ The presence of the papyrus plants is not, as he correctly concluded, because of an Egyptian source of the dragon, nor as he suggests 'the combination of an exotic fantastic being with an equally exotic landscape element'. As far as can be judged of the Minoan religion from contemporary monuments and from apparently pre-Hellenic features in the Greek religion, the paradise of the Minoans was like the visionary's landscape, a garden of strange flowers and fabulous beasts. It is illustrated on some of the frescoes, where blue monkeys roam among glorified papyrus, crocus and iris, or griffins crouch in a 00 field of papyrus reeds. That papyrus was particularly regarded as among the flowers of paradise may account for its popularity as a ceramic motif, as well as for its association with the Minoan dragon, an inhabitant of the Minoan Elysian fields. When the lentoid from the tomb of Clytemnestra (no.13) was first published it was heralded by several archaeologists as portraying Europa riding over the waves of the sea.^ Parallels might have been drawn with the H.Pelagia cylinder (no J 6), where Evans detected the dragon wading through the marshy thicket of a papyrus swamp, with the scalloping beneath the feet of the running monster on no. 4 and with the wavering line on no. 7. None of these analogies however would have been convincing, since the first is a forgery and the lines on the other two are not exclusively indicative of water - indeed the vegetation in the backgrounds makes an interpretation as solid earth more acceptable. If one examines the various stylizations used by the Minoan craftsmen to depict water, there are wavy lines, zig-zags, rows of crescents, scales etc.; nowhere on seal or fresco do overlapping lunettes similar to those on the Mycenaean lentoid occur in a marine context. Rather the reverse - the five other glyptic examples all 35 necessitate firm ground, and comparable motifs in other media confirm this. Forerunner or 36 not of the classical Europa, the goddess on the Mycenaean gem is involved in no transmarine escapade, but rides sedately over dry land. 4</page><page sequence="5">So far in this discussion I have referred to the best known examples of the dragon; there are several others, unfamiliar or previously unrecognized, which, though they add little to our knowledge of the animal, serve to confirm the general remarks about its physical characteris- tics. The fragmentary sealing from Zakro (no. 3) showing only the hind-quarters is typical, the longitudinal markings and curling tail being identical in style to the H. Triada sealings (nos. 1 and 2). Of a later date and cruder workmanship are the steatite lentoids of the Ashmolean (no. 7) and Giamalakis (no. 8) collections. These diverge only slightly from the norm, the first on account of its wavy tail, the second through the restriction of the body towards the hind- quarters. When Schliemann published the gold ornaments from Mycenae (no. 9), he recognized that one type was no ordinary animal; for lack of a better name, he labelled it ' hippocamp ' Müller queried whether it might not be a dog and Karo was more specific, calling it a sheep dog. There can be no doubt now that this is in fact the dragon, not so much because of its markings (for the heraldic cats and stags are similarly speckled) as from its profile. When first published, the motif on no. 10 was described as an eight-petalled flower surrounded by a spiral coil, this in turn encircled by two flying birds. TIb engraving is a little confused, but a clearer idea of the design may be obtained by restoring complete symmetry, replacing the reconstructed coil by two interlocking curves. These are then seen to be tails each joining a long striped body above a stubby hindleg, and at the other end of the torso a stout neck and backward turning beak-jawed head rise above the squat forepaw. The apparent disjunction of the neck from the body was meant to indicate torsion. Thus two peculiar birds turn out to be two perfectly ordinary dragons. Somewhat similar are the representations on an ivory comb from Spata (no.ll), unfortunately incomplete; only the forequarters of each animal is preserved, revealing a thick cylindrical striped body, heavy paw and beaked head turned back over^the shoulder. Comparison with the Palaikastro ivory comb, engraved with a series of lizards, might argue for a like composition on the Spata comb, but in view of the long beak-jaws an identification with the dragon seems more probable. A seal impression on a sherd from Cyprus (no.14) presented a puzzle to its editor, who could not decide whether it was meant to depict amphibian mammals or griffins; if the former, 'the secondary crest arising out of the middle of their backs would represent foam or bubbles tossed back in the wind'. A more satisfactory explanation is achieved by considering each crest as the tail of the preceding animal. In this way the monsters overlapping in procession acquire all the characteristics of standard dragons. The ruffled dolphin-like snouts are a variant insufficient to outweigh the evidence of the general profile, the long body, curling tail, stubby forepaws and the longitudinal somatic markings that are just visible along the back. The row of dots may correspond to the bristles on no.4y or may be just additional ornamentation. This now brings us on to the representations on seals of dubious authenticity and forgeries. No. 15 is unpublished and its present whereabouts unknown. Until the original can be examined It must I think be considered as a gemma dubitanda, because of its style and design. The shape of the dragon itself corresponds on the whole to the pattern deduced from the indisputable portrayals, with the exception of the feathered tail (a feature shared with the H.Pelagia forgery). If no.6 is genuine, then this would not be a damning feature. Scenes of animal conflicts are of 5</page><page sequence="6">frequent occurrence on Minoan and Mycenaean sealstones, practically always following the natural prototype, the beast of prey being the attacker. This in turn becomes the victim of its supernatural opponent, when a fabulous beast is involved- On the Ashmolean impression for the first time both protagonists are mythical. To modern eyes it is a strange scene. The dragon from its closer association with the goddess, being not merely her attendant but her steed, might be expected to hold the higher place in the mythical hierarchy, in spite of its apparently peaceful disposition; but here the griffin is certainly the aggressor. The theme is unparalleled ¿ so until an undoubted example is discovered it would be unwise to base any theory on this composition. The H.Pelagia cylinder (no.16) I have dealt with in an earlier article^ supplementing Biesantz' discussion of its style and composition,^ "with comments on the derivation of the motif from the H. Triada and Zakro sealings apart from two 'mistakes* (the drooping tail of the dragon and the lowered arms of the goddess). The Ring of Nestor (noJ.7) is now unanimously accepted as a forgery, but no-one seems to have recognised the nature of the animal 'apparently intended for a dog guarding the base of the tree'.^l Since the ring is probably the work of the same hand as the H.Pelagia cylinder, it is not surprising that one of the elements used in each should be the same. In this case the dragon has been more exactly copied from the H. Triada sealing no.132; the tail curls in the orthodox manner, and the silhouette of the head is an accurate reproduction. This concludes the survey of the Babylonian dragon, as it appears on Minoan and Mycenaean artefacts. Below I have listed the dozen or so genuine representations, also the modern forgeries and gemmae dubitandae, giving details of previous publications.

The details are best preserved on the complete mirror handle, where though man and griffin are Mycenaean, certain parti- culars in the armour indicate a Syrian (perhaps Ugaritic) origin (H. L. Lorimer, Homer and the Monuments , London 1950, p. 151). This would account for the distinctly eastern atmosphere of the motif - the idea of the hero in conflict with the semi-divine attendant of the gods, unparalleled in the Aegean of Minoan and Mycenaean times. 3a The adorant cynocephalus was introduced into Crete in pre-palatial times under the influence of the Egyptian sacred dog-ape so frequent on Old Kingdom button seals. A further stimulus probably came during the protopalatial period from Syria, where an identical long4ailed squatting monkey with arms raised in adoration appears on the cylinder seals. To the list of cynocephali noted by A. Xenaki-Sakellariou (Études Cretoises X (1958), "Les Cachets Minoens" p.61), I should like to add:- D.

Rossbach, AZ 41 (1883) col. 311, "Griechische Gemmen Ältester Technik", col. 341 no. 32, pl. 16.21 (described as a frog); Athens 4640, mentioned by Levi, Annuario 8-9 (1925-6) p. 71 "Le eretule di Haghia Triada e di Zakro" p. 119; A. J. Evans, The Palace of Minos , London 1921-36, I p. 83 note 2* Despite the comparatively large number of Minoan examples, there is no instance to witness that the adorant monkey was ever recognized in the Mycenaean religion. 9</page><page sequence="10">b In most cases the lion is treated as an ordinary wild animal, attacking its prey or hunted by man, but on certain seal types it occurs interchangeably with the griffin, indicating that it was also regarded as a sacred beast (e .g. heraldically either side of the goddess with the so-called snake-frames; S. Xanthudides, Ephemer is 1907 p. 141, "Ek Ķ)TļD% " {L 8.136 - griffin and lion either side of the master of animals; M. Lang, Archaeology 13 (1960) p.55, "Picture Puzzles from Pylos - the throne-room frescoes"). Since the beginning of civilization in the island, the lion had been extinct; knowledge of its appearance must therefore derive mainly from foreign representations, unless actual animals were imported as royal pets. c The so-called Skylla (Evans op. cit. (supra note 3a) IV p. 952 fig. 921) is probably a hippopotames (M. P. Nilsson, The Minoan-Mycenaean Religion and its survival in Greek Religion , Lund 1950, p. 37). 4a The sphinx and the griffin both originated in Egypt, but it was from the derivative Syrian versions that the Mmoang during the early phase of the first palace period gained their ideas of the two species, Levi op. cit, ( supra note 3a) Festos p. 122 types 243-7; A. Dessenne, Le Sphinx , P&amp;ris 1957, p. 44; ibid. BCH 81 (1957) p. 203 he griffon Creto- mycenien : inventaire et remarques. b Geographically the Minoan genius followed a route similar to that of the sphinx and griffin. There is evidence from Byblos and elsewhere that the Egyptian goddess Ta-wrt was known to the Syrians at that time (e.g. M. Dunand, Fouilles de Byhlos 1926-38, Paris 1937-58, H p. 757 fig. 876, pl. CI I nos. 15153-15160; C. F. A. Schaeffer, Stratigraphie comparée et chronologie de l'Asie occidentale , London 1948, p. 62; BMB I (1937) p. 101 Chronique; the fragment of a Middle Kingdom ivory wand found at Tell el-Ajjul, Jerusalem Museum South Gallery Case CC 864). Denuded of much of the trappings of alien ideology and acquiring new attributes en route, the goddess was welcomed by the Minoans as a protective genius. In Crete, much of her original significance forgotten or never learnt, she became thoroughly naturalized, and her form and function transformed in accordance with the needs of the Minoan religion. (For catalogue of Minoan and Mycenaean examples , see forthcoming article.) c ? the animal-boat cf. D. Levi, AJA 49 (1945) p.270, "Gleanings from Crete", p. 278. d The eagle-woman, a purely Minoan form that did not spread to the mainland, is perhaps an interpretation tf the kneeling griffin-man from Syria (H. Frankfort, Cylinder Seals , London 1939, p.XLI. 1). 5a The winged figures, male and female with goat* 8 heads and similar beings on the Zakro sealings (not to be confused with the grotesque types in the same deposit that were an artistic convention without any religious significance) may be indigenous creations or native variations on the theme suggested by the Syrian griffin-man. These Minoan forms belong to the first phase of the second palace and are superseded in popularity during the later phase by the contorted 'minotaur* types that continue into post-palatial times in Crete and on the mainland. b The 'minotaur' types - composite creatures combining the lower quarters of a man with the forequarters of a bull, lion, goat, stag, boar or dog(?). C The winged goat-lion; ď rare occurrence (Evans PM I p. 708 fig. 532; an unpublished sealing in the National Museum at Athens; C. Tsuntas Ephemeris 1888 p. 197 Ibp' tou ev Bxfetxo Tixpou pl. 10.30(42) - with the head of a mouflon rather than a goat; (?)S. N. Marinatos Ephemeris 1939-41 p. 69 To MiuoCkov nsyxpov XjHtaßoMaprou pl. 4 fig. 12 - a winged quadruped). d Tile lentoid from the Argive Heraeum is no proof of the classical centaur in Mycenaean times (C. W. Biegen, Prosymna , Cambridge 1937, p. 277 no. 11 pl. 145 fig. 589); the stone is worn, of sketchy execution and may have depicted two quadrupeds with heads raised. 6 In mediaeval bestiaries, for example, some illustrations of the elephant are quite accurate and may be based on the sight of the animal itself, others are obviously founded on description alone. Conflicting accounts of the rhinoceros in travellers' tales led Pliny to recognize two animals, of which the unicom became the more popular. 7 On the most detailed examples bands and cbts alternate, evidence perhaps of a conscious reminiscence of reptilian ancestry - compare for example the markings of no. 10 with those of the lizards on the ivory comb from Palaikastro (R. C. Bosanquet and R. M. Dawkins BSA supplement I 1923, "The Unpublished objects from the Palaikastro excava- tions" p. 126-7 fig. 108 = Evans PM IV p. 1006 fig. 956). 8 The stump of the tail is just visible on no.l% beginning to curve upwards, and is clear for its whole length, on no. 4 in spite of its omission from most drawings. 9 Levi (op. cit. (supra note4c)p. 273) suggests that the hind legs of no. 1 have the open claws of an eagle; without being able to compare them with the fare paws that are alas missing from all impressions, and should according to his hypo- thesis be those of a lion, it is impossible to determine the intention of the artist. From their physical appearance they seem to be paws rather than talons. 10</page><page sequence="11">10 In his earlier publication, Levi (op. cit. (supra note 3a) H. Triada p. 137) was hesitant as to the shape of the snouts on rco.2, but now there can be no doubt that they were originally of the same proportions as no. 1. 11 Perhaps because of the lateness of the engravings, involving a certain dilution of the tradition, the large fan of vegetation in the background of no. 7 has been allowed to prevent the tail from following its accustomed sweeping curve, while on no. 8 the body tapers towards the hindquarters instead of remaining a uniform width throughout. That no. 6 and no. 15 have phaggy tails may provide grounds for considering the authenticity of these stones as dubious. 12 R.

H. Ward, The Seal Cylinders of Western Asia , Washington 1910, p. 48-62; Frankfort, op.cit. (supra note 4d) pl. XXI I a, d, p. 125. 25 It may be that the Mycenaean ivories from Enkomi showing a warrior in combat with a griffin, mentioned above (note 2' were directly influenced by the conflicts between Marduk and the lion-griffin. 26 Indeed even in Mesopotamia the dragon is never actually shown in the processes of subjugation - unless it is to be identified with the multi-headed hydra of the Eshnuna seal, H. Frankfort, Iraq I (1934) p. 2, "Gods and Myths on Sargonid Seals", pl. I a; Frankfort op.cit. (supra note 4d) p. 121, 27 The apparent exceptions to this rule, noted by Levi op. cit. (supra note 4c) p. 275, are not true parallels to the Oetan riding goddess, for although the deities are seated directly on the backs of the animals, these Mesopotamian figures 11</page><page sequence="12">are obviously not in motion, riding, but regarded as enthroned, the animal's neck and head forming the back of the throne in each case, e.g.: P.
