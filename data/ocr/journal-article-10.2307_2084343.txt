The truth about childbirth turns out to be that "powerful Feminist influence"-which, by the way, is responsible for the author's unfavorable press in England, he says-has beguiled woman away from her principal function decreed by natural law, that of beginning to bear children at least by age I7 and continuing with little interruption until the menopause, quite enjoying each accouchement.

" (p. 247).. One of Mr. Ludovici's main points is not at all untenable-namely that the "agony" of normal childbirth and the severity and regularity of morn- ing sickness are greatly exaggerated by popular fears and misapprehensions and are useful to women as power devices against men-but his general approach to the whole subject is scientifically objectionable. Some of his analogies to the lower animals are anthropomorphic; in general he goes about blithely accepting "evidence" from whatever source, as long as it supports his general anti-Feminist bias, and arguing down all other data even as he cites them. There are hundreds of footnotes in the back of the book, which makes it all look very scientific. J. E. HULETT, JR. University of Illinois</page></plain_text>
