<plain_text><page sequence="1">G.C. Ioannides (ed.): Studies in Honour of Vassos Karageorghis, published with a grant from the Anastasios G. Leventis Foundation, The Society of Cypriot Studies, Nicosia, 1992. 374 pages, 86 plates (English, French and Greek). This Festschrift is presented to Prof. Vassos Karageorghis, the former director of the Cyprus Department of Antiquities, for his great contribution towards preserving the cultural heritage of Cyprus. Throughout the long and fruitful period of his civil service, and especially during the two decades since the division of Cyprus in 1974 until his retirement from the Department of</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 133 Antiquities in 1992, Prof. Karageorghis has constantly urged Greek Cypriots and foreign archaeologists alike to undertake research projects on the island. Almost 40 years of intensive scientific activity (from 1956 to 1992) are embodied in the impressive list of publications by Vassos Karageorghis that is presented in the Festschrift. The list (pp. 7-20) of 56 books and 297 articles includes reports of his own excavations, as well as proceedings of international colloquia and symposia organized by him. Scholars from all over the world offer their token to him in 45 papers in English, French and Greek on a large variety of topics spanning a wide chronological horizon from prehistory to the Roman period. To start with prehistory, A. Le Brun's recent excavations at Khirokitia ('Monter, descendre: Les acc?s au village n?olithique prec?ramique de Khirokitia [Chypre]'; pp. 21-26) shed new light on the layout of the well-known Pre-ceramic Neolithic village uncovered by P. Dikaios in earlier excavations at the site. The plastic art of the Chalcolithic period is the topic of several papers, including those of E. Peltenburg ('Birth Pendants in Life and Death: Evidence from Kissonerga Grave 563'; pp. 27-36) and E. Goring ('Secondary Treatment of Prehistoric Figurines: An Example from Chalcolithic Cyprus'; pp. 37-40) on the cultic role of cruciform pendants and figurines discovered at Kissonegra Mosphilia. S.M.L Admiral discusses Chalcolithic Cypriote Anthropomorphic Figurine in the Zintilis Collection, Amsterdam' (pp. 41-51), providing an important addition to the growing corpus of anthropomorphic statuary of this period. Furthermore, on the basis of mineralogical analyses, C. Xenophontos et al argue ('The Mineralogy of Picrolites Used for the Manufacture of Decorative Artefacts in Prehistoric Cyprus'; pp. 53-66) that the soft green rock used for manufacturing figurines, pendants and other artifacts during the Neolithic, Chalcolithic and EC periods should be identified not as steatite, but as picrolite. Mortuary evidence stimulated numerous studies on the archaeology of death in Bronze Age Cyprus. One of these is the paper presented by E. Herscher and S. Swiny ('Picking up the Pieces: Two Plundered Bronze Age Cemeteries'; pp. 69-86), who rely on the context of two plundered cemeteries recorded in the survey of Paramali Valley, for illuminating funerary practices in south-west Cyprus during the EC and MC periods. Ritual data for establishing the funerary ideology of the island from the EC to the end of the LC period is reviewed by J.M. Webb (pp. 87-99). It has always been agreed that the absolute chronology of Cyprus depends on external synchronism. In this respect, the joint paper by M. Artzy and E. Marcus on recent finds of Cypriote sherds in well-stratified occupational deposits of the MB IIA period at Tel Nami, on the coast of Israel south of Haifa (pp. 103-110), is particularly important for redating the initial phases of the MC period. New discoveries in other Levantine sites, such as Sianu on the northern coast of Syria, mentioned in 14th-13th-century B.C.E. texts from Ugarit, are reported by A. Bounni and M. Al-Maqdissi, who refer to LC imports discovered at the site ('Tell Sianu, Un nouveau chantier syrien'; pp. 129-140). Recent investigations at Maroni and Kalavasos Ayios Dhimitrios illuminate the new pattern of settlement that emerged on Cyprus in the course of the 13th century B.C.E. These investigations confirm the data provided by earlier excavations at sites such as Enkomi and Kition that town planning and urban architecture, including ashlar masonry, are distinctive features of the LC IIC period. G. Cadogan reviews the ashlar building and industrial installations of that date that he found at Maroni Vournes, in relation to the sequence of LC occupational and funerary remains previously uncovered at the site ('The</page><page sequence="3">134 REVIEWS British Museum's Work at Maroni'; pp. 123-126). The ongoing combined survey and excavation project undertaken by I. Todd and A. South in the Vasilikos Valley (The Late Bronze Age in the Vasilikos Valley: Recent Research'; pp. 191-204) confirm their suggestion that the growing demand for Cypriote copper overseas was the raison d'?tre for a network of urban centres in the south-eastern part of this valley and its environs in the closing phase of the LC II period. The huge 13th-century B.CE. town of Kalavasos Ayios Dhimitrios, with its well-developed urban plan (including an ashlar administrative building), lies close to the Kalavasos copper mines and to several smaller sites, such as Mari and Maroni, which provide easy access to land and sea routes of the island. The role of Cyprus in LB copper trade is a matter of long-standing controversy. Thus, U. Zwicker 's paper on the metallurgical composition of 13 Cypriote objects housed in the Archaeological Museum of Nicosia (pp. 165-177) is of special interest. His analyses indicate that in contrast to the EC and MC periods, a wide variety of metals, ranging from pure copper and arsenic bronze to tin bronze, were used for producing a large repertory of tools, weapons, ingots, weights, stands and other artifacts in the LC period. His results on the extent and nature of LC metallurgical activity seem to coincide with investigations of other scholars, who maintain that recycling of metals from different sources was practiced extensively all over the Mediterranean basin in that period (see also Journal of Mediterranean Archaeology 8 [1995]). Old discoveries in LC II-LC III deposits at Enkomi still provide an inexhaustible source for new studies on outstanding artifacts made from various materials. J.C. Courtois discusses a 12th-century B.CE. limestone bath-tub from 'B?timent 18' ('Un baignoire monolithe en calcaire du bronze r?cent a Enkomi'; pp. 151-154), whereas E. Masson questions the validity of the accepted view that the well-known bronze figurine of a smiting deity recovered from an 11th-century hoard in 'Temple of the Ingot God' is actually standing on an ingot ('Le dieu guerrier d'Enkomi: Est-il debout, sur un lingot?'; pp. 155-156). Since Prof. Karageorghis is an inter nationally renowned expert on Cypriote pictorial vase painting, it is not surprising that E. Rystedt's paper on several bull craters of the 14th-13th centuries B.CE. from Enkomi (pp. 157-163) is also included in the Festschrift. Of special interest are several distinctive groups of LC II-CG I pottery vessels studied by D. Philides, who discusses the distribution of 'Handmade Burnished Ware' in Cyprus and its demographic impact on the island during the 13th-11th centuries B.CE. (pp. 179-189), and by M. Iacovou, who presents 'Additions to the Corpus of Eleventh Century B.C. Pictorial Pottery' (pp. 217-226). She dwells on rare vessels of Proto-White Painted and White Painted wares that have direct bearing on the ethnic, social and economic situation of Cyprus in the closing phase of the Bronze Age (LC IIB) and the initial phase of the Iron Age (CG A). Archaeological data based mainly on ceramic evidence, indicating that interconnections between Cyprus and Phonicia were re-established during the latter phase (second half of the 11th century B.CE.) are also re-examined by P.M. Bikai in a paper entitled 'Cyprus and Phoenicia: Literary Evidence for the Early Iron Age'(pp. 241-248). Furthermore, Bikai rightly refers to the immense importance of Karageorghis's latest excavations at the Palaepaphos-Skales cemetery for a better understanding of the role of Cyprus in the larger Mediterranean perspective during the last decade of the second millennium B.CE. The present reviewer is unable to cover the vast chronological scope of all of the papers included in the Festschrift, and space limitations prevent the expansion of these comments beyond the second millennium B.CE. Nonetheless, it seems appropriate to refer to the recent Proceedings of the International Symposium: Cyprus in the</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 135 11th Century B.C. (Nicosia, 1994) held at Nicosia in late October, 1993. In fact, this symposium is the first of its kind to be organized by Prof. Karageorghis after his recent appointment as the director of the Archaeological Research Unit of the University of Cyprus. Considering his persistence and devotion, there is no doubt whatsoever that this symposium will be followed by others dedicated to specific periods in the history and archaeology of Cyprus.
