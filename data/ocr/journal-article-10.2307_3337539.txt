<plain_text><page sequence="1">AFRICAN ART AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY LINDSEY RINDER XW~ ^ = hen the Leland Stanford Junior Museum at Stanford University first opened its famous bronze doors in 1894, it was the largest private museum in the world. Built by the railroad tycoon, former governor of California (1862-63), and U.S. senator (1885-93) Leland Stanford and his wife, Jane, it was a memorial to their only child, Leland, and his interest in "the art-training of our 68 American people" (Luigi Cesnola to Jane Stanford, May 7, 1884). The new museum, along with the other public museums spring- ing up across America, marked a departure from the prevailing focus on European traditions with its focus on world cultures and popular knowledge. More than one hundred years later, the bronze doors, forced to close by natural disaster in 1989, opened once again early in 1999 to reveal a renovated, expanded, and reor- ganized museum, now called the Iris &amp; B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts, and a revitalized art collection that does much to achieve the Stanfords' goal of a universal survey museum. In Museum Builders in the West, Carol Osborne observes (1986:90): The story of the Stanford Museum is a variation on the dominant theme of nineteenth-century American museums: interest in the history of man rather than the history of art...in the decades after the Civil War, when travel and income for Americans increased enormously, it was often the ethnographic and the archaeological object that was brought back to fill the museum case. Increased travel opportunities, along with the new encoun- ters precipitated by imperialism, broadened the nineteenth-cen- tury American's perspective on the world.

While the Berlin Conference of 1884 was defining European control over Africa, Americans' attention was focused on the conquest of their own continent. As exemplified by the post- Columbian expositions in the 1890s, U.S. museums were em- phasizing Native American art rather than African. However, in his architectural history of the Stanford Museum, Building on the Past, Richard Joncas points to several U.S. museums founded during or soon after the 1870s that "institutionalized universal knowledge by representing world cultures in their collections" (1998:36, n. 20). He gives three examples-the Brooklyn Muse- um, the Cincinnati Art Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum alrlcan arts ? spring 1999 SCHOPPLEIN STUDIO 70</page><page sequence="4">of Art in New York; the first two were among the first museums in America to collect and exhibit the art of Africa as art. The Stanfords' Vision On his travels, Leland Stanford, Jr., collected antiquities from Egypt, Greece, Rome, China, and Japan, as well as precontact America. He hoped one day to build a public museum, and planned his first "International Museum" in the horse stables adjacent to the family home in San Francisco. His budding collection was described as including "some specimens of New Mexican Indian pottery and basketwork of curious design, also some articles from Alaska, showing the handiwork of the Indians of that region." According to an article in the newspaper The Argonaut (April 9, 1887), the younger Stanford wanted to "collect antiquities and curious things from all parts of the world" (cited in Joncas 1999:35, n. 11). His parents were also interested in supporting a public col- lection. Both were great admirers of Louis Agassiz, the famous naturalist who founded the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. Agassiz visited the Stanfords in 1872, and the couple were greatly influenced by his educational phi- losophy about museums. After the scientist's death, Stanford helped found the Agassiz Institute, and along with Charles Crocker purchased and donated the outstanding Ward Natural History Collection to the California Academy of Sciences. His support of San Francisco institutions, however, changed in 1884, when young Leland died of typhoid while traveling in Europe, just before his sixteenth birthday. The grieving parents decided to build a university in Palo Alto, on their 8,800 acres of farmland in the heart of the San Francisco peninsula, as a memorial to their son. It would include a museum that would reflect his interest in art and classical archaeology as well as the family belief in the wider access to education for the American public. By 1893 Mrs. Stanford had gathered 15,000 objects for the new museum, including 5,000 pieces of Cypriot antiquities bought from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Other acquisitions included the McAdam collection of North American Mound Builders' relics, the DeLong collection of Japa- nese art, the John Daggett collection of Native Californian baskets and household objects (along with an eighteen-foot canoe), Coptic textiles, Korean textiles and weapons, and a large and important Egyptian collection. At the turn of the century Mrs. Stanford would add many more pieces, including the Ikeda collection of Japanese art and objects from the Northwest Coast, among the lat- ter a group of Haida argillite carvings and a Tlingit crest hat that is to this day one of the museum's prize possessions. Jane Stanford was determined to house the collections in an enormous classical building that would resemble the National Archaeological Museum in Athens (Fig. 1). It was her husband's decision that the building be made entirely of reinforced con- crete. In its day it was a technological phenomenon, built in 5. Standing female figure (blolo bla). Baule, Cote d'lvoire. Wood, metal; 44.5cm (17.5"). Gift of Victor and Paula Zurcher and the Committee for Art Acquisitions Fund, 1986.186. The Baule believe that before we were born into this world we existed in a spirit world, where we each had a mate. Sometimes that spirit mate becomes jealous of our earthly mate and causes marital discord. When this happens, a figure depicting the otherworld spouse is carved and placated with earthly signs of attention. This figure has a metal nugget, possibly gold, embedded in its forehead at the hairline. sprlng 1999 ? afrlcan arts SCHOPPLEIN STUDIO 71</page><page sequence="5">This page: 6. Mask. Sango, Gabon. Wood, kaolin, pigment; 34.5cm (13.63'). Gift of Victor and Paula Zurcher, 1986.189. White-faced, heart-shaped masks are found throughout Gabon, especially in the Middle Ogowe region, home of the Vuvi, the Tsogo, and the Sango peoples. The masks appear during and after a time of mourning. They are believed to be especially powerful when seen at dawn and at dusk, moments of transition, like death itself. two-thirds the time it would have taken to build a masonry building, and at half the cost. After the 1906 Quake The museum opened in 1894, one year after the death of Senator Stanford. In 1905 Mrs. Stanford died, and in 1906 her beloved museum was devastated in the famous San Francisco earth- quake. Although much of the original reinforced-concrete structure survived, the quake leveled two wings that had been added later and were only partly in use. Substantial parts of the Egyptian and Roman collections were destroyed, along with more than 1,000 Cypriot pots. The count of objects prior to and even after the earthquake was approximate, and no actual inventory was undertaken until 1916-17. 72 Opposite page, counterclockwise from top: 7. Egungun mask with acrobat. Yoruba, Nigeria, 1925-50. Wood, pigment; 33cm (13"). Gift of Janine and Michael Heymann, 1981.203. This mask is thought to have been carved by Oniyide Adigbologe (d. 1949) or one of his sons, members of a family noted for making ere ibeji (twin fig- ures) and Egungun masks. The enlarged ears of this example may declare the owner's pride in his lineage, and thus are appropriate for a masquerade that honors the ancestors and seeks continuation of their life-sustaining powers. The ears and teeth may also refer to a hare, regarded as nocturnal, and thus to the world of witches and to the hunter who destroys witches lest they snatch away children in the night. 8. Kifwebe society mask. Eastern Luba; Shaba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, ca. 1930. Wood, kaolin; 38.1cm (15"). Museum purchase with funds realized from the deaccession and sale of gifts from Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Baker, Mr. and Mrs. Miles Rubin, Dr. and Mrs. Ralph Spiegl, and an anony- mous donor, 1992.235. These distinctive masks, seen widely in the southeastern part of the Congo, initially were meant to refer to the speed of an animal dashing through the forest. Although the masks were used in different contexts at different times, the goal was usually success in hunting and, more broadly, the regulation of social conduct. 9. Kore society hyena mask. Bamana, Mali. Wood, metal; 55.3cm (21"). Museum purchase with funds realized through the deaccession and sale of gifts from Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Goldenberg, 1993.55. The Kore society is a rigidly stratified male initiation group that seeks to bring men to peace with their spirits and enable them to accept death. It is the last of six associations that a Bamana man joins during his lifetime. The hyena symbolizes fallible human wisdom. Extensive local repairs add visual interest. african arts ? spring 1999</page><page sequence="6">spring 1999 ? atrican arts 73</page><page sequence="7">10. Ngady aMwaash mask. Kuba, Bushoong group; West Kasai, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Wood, cloth, shells, beads, string, pig- ment; 33cm (13"). Museum purchase with funds realized through the deac- cession and sale of gifts from Mrs. Frederick Henry Colburn in memory of her husband, and the Committee for Art Acquisitions Fund, 1995.82. This is one of three royal masks that tell the legend of Woot, First Ancestor of the Kuba people. It represents Woot's sister/spouse, a character said to have been introduced to the pageantry to give greater importance to the role of women. The lavish use of cowrie shells suggests wealth, and their whiteness is a sign of mourning. The museum's unofficial curator, Harry C. Peterson, was an engineering student originally hired by Mrs. Stanford in 1900 to help install the galleries. After the earthquake he tried to recov- er what remained. With five assistants, he reportedly worked from five in the morning until eight at night for six months, 74 seven days a week. Peterson eventually recorded 28,200 items in a card cata- logue and a ledger with one-line entries, both of which survive to this day. In keeping with what was then common practice, he recorded the accession num- bers directly on the objects in conspicu- ous red paint. Unfortunately, though, many of those objects disappeared- lost, stolen, or given away during the years when the building's storage areas, unlit and probably unlocked, became a cornucopia of opportunity for local col- lectors and dealers. Peterson described the disarray as "a morgue of relics" (Joncas 1999:48, n. 81). In 1917 Peterson was replaced by Pedro deLemos, who was then director of the California School of Fine Arts, and an arts and crafts designer with some talent as an architect. DeLemos was also deeply interested in art education and in 1919 became the editor of School Arts maga- zine. During the 1920s he made four col- lecting trips to the Southwest, expanding the museum's holdings of pottery from that area and using the collection at Stanford to illustrate the pedagogical principles he espoused in the magazine. He pioneered such innovations as invit- ing a group of American Indians to the Stanford campus in 1930 to demonstrate the making of jewelry, pottery, and sand paintings. However, deLemos's zest for travel meant that he was usually un- available to members of the faculty, and the museum lost visibility as well as ob- jects and "turf." By 1934 natural science departments occupied half of what remained of the museum building. In 1942 the university established a school of the humanities, and two years later the museum was incorporated within it as part of an interdisciplinary program. John Dodds, a professor of English, who was, paren- thetically, a collector of Plains Indian art and donor of several wonderful pieces to the museum, headed the new school. He recruited the distinguished social historian Lewis Mumford to Stanford to teach and to prepare a program on "Teaching of the Arts." Mumford proposed construction of a new museum, "conceived more as a library and a workshop than as a means of display," which might become "the central nucleus building of a new group of humanities buildings" (Joncas 1999:54, n. 112). For various reasons, this never happened. In the decades after World War II, the phenomenon of increased travel, observed by Osborne for the period after the Civil War, was repeated. This time the surge was sparked by American students studying abroad on Fulbright scholarships and by U.S. involvement in programs like the Peace Corps. african arts ? spring 1999</page><page sequence="8">Left: 11.

Museum pur- chase with funds realized through the deaccession and sale of gifts from the Alice Meyer Buck Fund, 1995.204. This equestrian figure is a classic West African statement of authority, rein- forced by the staff, flywhisk and reins, necklace and bracelet, and the sole survivor of the original four attendants. Elefon is the name used in the Ekiti region for the masquerade called Epa in other regions. The conical head- dress in the shape of a royal crown is a figurative extension of the head, a passageway for the spirits. Right: 12. Female figure from a Bwiti shrine. Tsogo, Gabon.

Given in memory of Janine Heymann by Marc and Ruth Franklin, 1997.120. This elongated figure would have been part of a central post in the shel- ter where initiates of the Bwiti cult gathered. As a female figure it would have had a tutelary role, protecting and instructing. For the matrilineal Tsogo, it was also a monument to the founders of the clan and the bear- ers of knowledge. spring 1999 ? african arts The world had become smaller but the world of art had become larger. The Appearance of African Art After Lorenz Eitner was named chair of the art department at Stanford in 1963, he undertook the rededication of the building to art and renamed it the Stanford University Museum of Art. A gallery commemorating the Stanfords was retained, and many of their original gifts-what remained of them-were rein- stalled. Even before Eitner arrived, the museum had become more closely involved with the curriculum of the university in general and the art department in particular; Under Eitner, fac- ulty interests were reflected in major collection development in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century prints and drawings, Rodin 75</page><page sequence="9">Left: 13.

Large figures such as this one usually appeared in pairs on household altars dedicated to the ancestors. Most figures stand calmly, but some, large and small, are distinguished by unusual body language that conveys strong feelings. Other figures with turned heads are known; the meaning of the gesture, however, is not well understood. 0 Center: 14. Standing female figure. Bamana, Mali. Wood, 89cm (35"). Private collection, L. 15.02.1998. Young men newly initiated into the Jo society travel in groups to nearby vil- lages, performing the songs and dances they have just learned. They carry figures such as this one, which embody the ideals of female sexuality and fertility as proclaimed in the songs, and as such they express some of the initiates' desires. Right: 15.

From the collection of Marc and Ruth Franklin with support from the Committee for Art Acquisitions Fund and the School of Humanities and Sciences General Gifts Fund, 1998.11. In the late nineteenth century an iconoclastic Luluwa chief condemned fig- urative sculpture, and this figure from that period seems to have been inten- tionally mutilated. It represented a "chieftain of the leopard," the highest level of political power. Hunter and warrior, through his kinship with the leopard he could bridge the worlds of the living and the dead. african arts ? spring 1999 76</page><page sequence="10">oU IlrI Left: 16.

This eroded sculpture is an archaic forerunner of the commemorative ancestral figures that are distinctive to this part of Central Africa. Later rep- resentations are usually more human and soulful, sometimes so personal as to be a portrait, but the schematic angularity of this example makes it seem more like the primordial ancestor.

The kabeja presides over ritual offerings to the ancestors and mediates legal disputes.

Its ambivalence may lead to a middle ground in dispute resolution by implying value to con- flicting versions of an account. spring 1999 ? afrlcan arts casts, Muybridge photographs, and many facets of Asian art. The museum also presented several exhibitions of Southwest pottery and textiles, spurred in part by a bequest from a former associate dean and professor of English, Virgil Whitaker. The African studies program expanded during the 1970s, when Stanford was both praised and pilloried for its political cor- rectness, and African art might have come into its own. Yet cours- es on the subject were occasional, taught by transient instructors with little advance notice, and thus they attracted few students. Despite the pleas of local collectors, the museum was unrespon- sive. An exhibition of African art from local collections in 1976-77 was discredited because of its lack of selectivity, and the resulting embarrassment may have discouraged growth in that direction. 77</page><page sequence="11">18. Mask with serpentine top. Mossi, Burkina Faso. Wood, 147cm (57"). From the collection of Marc and Ruth Franklin with support from the Committee for Art Acquisitions Fund and the School of Humanities and Sciences General Gifts Fund, 1998.6. The serpent is identified with the life force, and Voltaic masks like this and the Bwa mask in Figure 19 perform during the dry season to praise the source of agricultural abundance. During low, sweeping motions the wear- er keeps this mask in place by clamping his teeth on a thick cord that ends in a knot just above the mouth. In 1979 Eitner, a specialist in European drawings, widened the scope of the museum by appointing Victor Zurcher as Honorary Curator of Primitive Art, and works of African art went on permanent display for the first time. These were not the first African objects in the collection. Several small wooden sculp- tures, some beadwork, and a few massive brass collars from the Bulu people of Cameroon had been donated around 1950 by a retired missionary living in Palo Alto. And indeed, Jane Stanford, on one of her trips to Egypt and Sudan, had acquired a few curios for the museum. In the 1980s, under the auspices of Zurcher and with the help of a San Francisco dealer, James Willis, and loans and gifts from local collectors, the African collection began to expand. At the outset Zurcher separated African and pre-Columbian art, reserv- ing a gallery for works of African art accompanied by labels with maps and contextual information. (Oceanic art was added tenta- tively, somewhat later.) Initially about half the African pieces were loans from private collections. One early gift was a Kota reliquary guardian (Fig. 3). By 1989 about ninety percent of the pieces on exhibit belonged to the museum (Ghent 1989:11). Zurcher's passion for history had led him to begin collecting African and pre-Columbian art in the late forties and early fifties. In the eighties, as a retired businessman, he could devote time- and his professional and aesthetic acumen-to developing the museum's collections. He and his wife, Paula, had made their first trip to Africa in 1978, along with a dozen other Americans. With Willis as the tour guide, the group explored Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, and C6te d'Ivoire. Zurcher's interest in the art of Africa grew. His wife's family had been interested in "tribal" art, Oceanic art in particular, and many of the gifts to the museum in the 1980s-and before-were from the the couple's own collec- tion. One of the earliest (1969) and most noteworthy was a Bamana chiwara (Fig. 4). Two other gifts that reflect Zurcher's connoisseurship are a Baule spirit-spouse figure (Fig. 5) and a Sango mask (Fig. 6), both donated in 1986. The curator eagerly sought participation from other collectors as well, eliciting such gifts as a Yoruba Egungun mask (Fig. 7) in 1981. Unfortunately, Zurcher's health began to deteriorate, and by mid-1989 he felt he could not continue his duties at the museum. On that first trip to Africa, he had met other collectors, among them Ruth Franklin, who had taken a post in International Studies at Stanford when her husband, Marc, joined the Stanford Law School faculty in 1962. Delighted by the growing attention to African arts seen at Stanford during the 1980s, Franklin was more than willing to become acting curator of what was still being called "primitive art" if that term was dropped. Eitner had retired, and Wanda Corn, a distinguished Americanist, became chair of the art department and acting director of the museum. Fulfilling one of her first goals, Corn convinced the university that the directorship merited a full-time position. 78 atlrcan arts ? sprlng 1999</page><page sequence="12">Above: 19.

This mask representing a hawk dances energetically, its red wig swirling. The geometric designs convey coded information to the initiates, and meanings vary by clan and level of initiation.

Fang, Gabon. Wood, kaolin; 30cm (11.75"). Gift of Marc and Ruth Franklin, 1997.119. The name of this mask means "young white girl," but it is worn by men in a ritual of the Byeri cult revering departed ancestors. White is the color of the spirits of the dead, and those with white faces have come to visit the living, bringing magic from the realm of the supernatural. Earlier versions of these masks had only one face. On October 17, 1989, while the eyes of much of the world were focused on the World Series in San Francisco, the Bay Area was rocked by a major earthquake. Although virtually all of the museum's permanent collection survived, the Loma Prieta quake did so much damage to the famous reinforced-concrete building that it was immediately closed to the public. The next step was a revised job description for the director that would include involvement in what would be nearly ten years of con- struction and reorganization. A New Director Following an extensive search the university announced the appointment of Thomas K. Seligman to the position of John and Jill Freidenrich Director. Seligman's background in African art was especially strong. While serving as a Peace Corps volunteer, he 79 spring 1999 ? alrlcan arts</page><page sequence="13">was director and curator of the Africana Museum of Cuttington College, Liberia. After completing his term in late 1970, he traveled extensively throughout West Africa, collecting for a few U.S. and European museums. The next year Seligman was appointed Curator-in-Charge of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas at the de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco. During the 1970s and '80s he brought a wide range of exhibitions of African, Oceanic, and pre-Columbian art to the de Young and initiated others. He also worked cosely with local collectors to establish an interest group called Friends of Ethnic Art, which has now passed its twen- ty-fifth year as an independent organization. Of lasting importance was Seligman's conception and imple- mentation of a project with Mexico to provide for the conser- vation and eventual joint custody of a group of murals from Teotihuacan that had landed on the de Young's doorstep through an unexpected bequest in 1976. This ten-year project brought Seligman back to his interest in issues of cultural property, a con- cern during his days in Liberia. It also led him to represent the museum community for four years on the Presidential Advisory Committee on Cultural Property. During these years the de Young Museum had become part of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, and Seligman became Deputy Director for Education and Exhibitions for the latter while retaining his curatorial title at the de Young. In 1989 he gave up both posts to become Deputy Director for Operations and Plan- 80 Left: 21. Harp in the form of a standing figure (ngombi).

The skin stretched over a hollow body con- ceals a spine to which the strings are attached. Pegs in the stick that extends from the top of the head tune the strings.

It was this combination of ability and experience that led to Seligman's selection in 1991 as director of the Stanford Uni- versity Museum of Art. Soon after assuming the directorship, Seligman again showed himself to be an advocate of high ethi- cal standards for museums. He steered the repatriation of dozens of pieces that had been removed illegally from Costa african arts ? spring 1999</page><page sequence="14">Rica and Nicaragua and given to the museum. The university had rescinded the gift when the fraud was discovered, but the objects had remained in limbo. The need for substantial fund-raising for renovation and construction was obvious, but more attractive to Seligman, a Stanford graduate, was the university's desire to expand the scope of the museum's holdings geographically and chronolog- ically. Partly this was a response to the constituencies of the institution: faculty, students, alumni, and Bay Area residents. It also reflected an awareness of opportunities for collection development that had never been tapped. The university promised special attention to "the world of contemporary art and tribal art from Africa, the Pacific, and Indonesia." Franklin agreed to serve on a voluntary basis as curator. Developing the Collection In the early 1990s it was clear that some deaccessioning would be necessary. Donors of the works involved were assured that their gifts would be sold at auction and the proceeds used to strengthen the collection in the same area. Through this process the museum was able to fund a number of important acquisi- tions, including an unusual Eastern Luba Kifwebe mask (Fig. 8), a Bamana Kore society mask (Fig. 9), a Kuba Ngady aMwaash mask (Fig. 10), and a Yoruba Elefon mask (Fig. 11). spring 1999 ? african arts 23. Memory board (lukasa). Eastern Luba; Shaba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 19th century. Wood, beads, nails, cowries; 19.7cm (7.75"). Gift of Marc and Ruth Franklin, 1997.126. The memory board encapsulates Luba history. All the elements on this board and their colors, materials, and configurations, as well as the shape of the board itself and the patterns on the reverse, help to recall various aspects of the Luba heritage. Yet each board is different, and a single board may evoke different interpretations at different times, even from the same expert. Augmentation of the African collection also came from another source. By profession an editor, Ruth Franklin was intro- duced to African art in Douglas Fraser's classroom and in two trips to West Africa. She and her husband, Marc, were intrigued by the intellectual challenges that collecting presented, and they had assembled an impressive collection of African art through careful selection and research. Seligman, along with Kathleen Berrin, had curated an exhibition of figures from the Franklins' collection in 1988 at the de Young Museum ("Forms and Forces: Dynamics of African Figurative Sculpture"). The couple did give numerous pieces to the de Young, but as long-time members of the Stanford community they had always been interested in donating works to the Stanford Museum, should it become receptive to African art. Now, thrilled by the resources and opportunities the new galleries would present, the Franklins began to discuss the possibility of a substantial donation. The working relationship they had established with Seligman over twenty-five years in San Francisco simply carried over to Stanford. (Marc Franklin assumed the responsibility of discussing their possible gift with Seligman, as Ruth was understandably concerned about maintaining her distance as a curator.) Seligman discusses the Franklin donation (1996-97:53): Although highly selective judgments and personal aesthetics have driven their collecting, the aware- ness that the pieces were made for specific purposes within their culture led...to extensive research on each piece, to understand its origin, relationship with other objects from the same or related cultures, and its intended role or function....Included...are twenty-three African masks and figures, primarily from Central Africa. Pieces that were shown in "Forms and Forces" and are now installed in the Cantor Center include figures from the Lobi (Fig. 13), Bamana (Fig. 14), Tsogo (Fig. 12), Bena Luluwa (Fig. 15), Bembe (Fig. 16), and Hemba (Fig. 17). The Franklins were primarily interested in figurative sculpture, and these works complemented the masks acquired through deaccessioning. Several other masks eventually were included in the gift: two Voltaic masks (Figs. 18, 19), a Fang helmet mask (Fig. 20), and a Mbunda samahongo mask (Fig. 2). In 1998 an endowment was created to fund Franklin's curato- rial position and to support exhibitions, publications, and acqui- sitions, thanks to Phyllis Wattis, one of the most generous benefactors of art museums in the United States. Since her first trips to West Africa and Melanesia with Seligman about two decades ago, when she was in her seventies, Mrs. Wattis has developed and maintained a strong interest in the art of those areas. Other expansion that took place while the museum was closed included the creation of the New Guinea Sculpture Garden, with poles carved by ten carvers from the Sepik region 81</page><page sequence="15">during a summer in residence at Stanford in 1994, and the instal- lation of a Nuu-chah-nulth totem pole in 1995. The Museum Reopens Nearly a decade after the earth shook, the museum, now the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, is open again. A large new wing houses moder and contemporary art, special exhibitions, a book- store, a cafe, an auditorium, and a sculpture terrace. Before his death in 1996, Mr. Cantor, founder and chair of a global securities firm, had donated 185 Rodin sculptures to the museum and pro- vided for the establishment of the Rodin Sculpture Garden. Many Rodins have joined the rest of the permanent collection inside the original building, now restored to its initial classical lines. The first 24. Seated figure with bowl (kabila). Luba; Shaba, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Wood, grasses; 36.8cm (14.5'). Anonymous gift, 1997.125. The figure holds a bowl that contained kaolin. By coating their eyes and faces with this white clay, royal diviners enter the spirit world. These figures are invariably female, for women are mediators between two worlds and them- selves receptacles for spiritual powers. The scarification on the torso of this bowl bearer is represented by appliqued grasses rather than relief carving. major financial assistance came from the Christensen Fund, which has made many loans and gifts to the African and Oceanic collec- tions as well. The restoration was also funded by the Federal Emergency Management Administration. The two-story classical rectangular layout has made possible separate galleries, each measuring approximately 1,500 square feet, for the arts of Africa, Oceania, Native America, and the Ancient Americas. Starting in the main lobby, the first gallery to the left is devoted to the art of Africa, adjacent to the art of Egypt and the Ancient Mediterranean. The first gallery to the right is devoted to the art of Ancient China and Asian religions. The art of Oceania is housed next to it in a large gallery that encom- passes the islands of both the South Pacific and Southeast Asia. Other galleries in this wing show other aspects of the art of Asia. The upper floor combines European and American paintings, sculpture, and decorative arts, arranged chronologically so that the most recent works are closest to the new building and the earliest lead into the Native American gallery and from there to the Ancient Americas. The goal for the African gallery was to select works distin- guished by their aesthetic quality and reflecting their cultural origins. A statement introducing these fig- ures and masks notes that "No museum can recreate their emotional impact on the people for whom they were made." About 125 pieces are included, less than half the entire collection. Most were acquired dur- ing the 1980s and 1990s. Pylons and panels painted an intense blue complement the dark tones of the works in wood; careful lighting accentu- ates the contours and colors of the pieces. Walking into the gallery, with its original concrete-tile floor and fifteen- foot-high coffered ceilings, the visitor is presented with a variety of objects. Colorful beads festoon a Yoruba royal staff straight ahead, and nearby a lus- trous hide-covered Igbo helmet mask glows in its vitrine. Asante goldweights gleam among the Guinea Coast pieces near the doorway. The vivid colors and textures of an imposing Kuba mask and its costume can be seen across the room. In the center of the space, an array of minkisi from the Kongo peoples manifest their powers through a variety of forms and addenda. Although the objects are grouped into regional categories-the Western Sudan (Sahel), Guinea Coast, Equatorial Forest, and Southern Savanna-these terms appear only on a map, not on the walls of the gallery. The art of Central Africa is very much in evidence, including objects in several media that demonstrate the omnipresence of design and pattern in Kuba royal art. A group of imposing fig- RALPH KOCH ures from the Songye, Hemba, Kusu, and african arts ? spring 1999 82</page><page sequence="16">a 25. Seated mother-and-child figure (gwandusu). Bamana, Mali. Wood, 55cm 3 (22'). From the collection of Marc and Ruth Franklin with support from the &lt; Committee for Art Acquisitions Fund and the School of Humanities and Sciences General Gifts Fund, 1998.5. Gwan was a Bamana society concerned with human fertility and childbear- ing. Its major female figure was a woman holding a baby; the name of this figure, gwandusu, is said to mean "one who has strength and can achieve greatness." The object's unevenly eroded surface suggests that it lay on its side for years in the rafters of an abandoned shelter. Traces of talismanic thongs can still be seen on the upper arms. Bembe peoples confronts visitors emerging from the adjacent gallery filled with Rodin bronze figures, and an unusual Ngbaka anthropomorphic harp (Fig. 21) provides another surprise. Luba culture is represented by a bead-encrusted memory board (Fig. 23), an adze, and a bowl-bearing figure with torso cicatrization depicted by the insertion of grasses rather than relief carving (Fig. 24). Other highlights of the gallery include an Igbo mask surmounted by two figures (Fig. 22), a Bamana mother-and- child figure (Fig. 25), a pair of Cameroon doorposts, and a carved post from a Dogon togu-na (men's house). These works in the permanent collection have been supplemented by objects generously loaned from the Heymann Collection and the Christensen Fund Collection. Labels offer specific context and, where possible, meaning. The introduction to the gallery provides the broader perspective: The art in this gallery depicts the human body, in ways that express a wide range of concepts, some as explicit as fertility, some as abstract as justice. The head, breasts, or stomach may be enlarged to indicate its importance. Eyes or mouth may be a metaphor for seeing or saying. Male and female figures merge to convey ambiguity and the interplay of opposites. The female figure itself has several meanings: Woman may be Mother Earth, source of fertility, or First Ancestor; she may be from the realm of the spirits, the bearer of esoteric knowledge. Male fig- ures have more predictable identities, usually as culture heroes or significant ancestors. Masks are often more complex, combining human and animal references to create a new identity. The art of Africa is also included in an Orientation space, organized by the curator of education, which seeks to demystify the workings of a museum. Now that the art of Africa has its place in the permanent collection, it will be part of the museum's ongoing educational activities. There are plans to make the col- lection broader and deeper, to bring in traveling exhibitions, and to involve the rest of the university in the new developments. Today the neoclassical building built by the Stanfords houses galleries of African, Asian, Oceanic, Ancient American, and Native American art, as well as European art and contemporary art from all over the world. The Tlingit crest hat collected by Jane Stanford, now two hundred years old, rests beneath the watchful eyes of a hamat'sa Raven Mask carved last year by the artist John Livingston. The mask was commissioned as a gift for the opening of the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, which, 105 years after the bronze doors first swung open, is immeasurably closer to being the universal survey museum its founders desired.
