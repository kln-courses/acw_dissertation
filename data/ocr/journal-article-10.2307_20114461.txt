<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETER ALEXANDER SPECULATIONS AND THEORIES Philosophers have been inclined, during the present century, to reject, or at least to regard with suspicion, the speculations of the metaphysician. This attitude sprang largely from a growing interest in scientific theories and the belief that these constituted the only appropriate and acceptable attempts to describe or explain the natural world. The desire for greater rigour within science, which led to the nineteenth century efforts to eliminate metaphysical elements from science x, stimulated empiricist philosophers to distinguish the verifiable, factually meaningful statements of science from the unverifiable and allegedly factually meaningless utter ances of metaphysicians and to reject these last as uninformative. In view of this close connection between science and empiricist philosophy, it is sur prizing to find, in more recent years, a reawakening of interest in metaphys ical speculations precisely among those philosophers who are interested in the philosophy and history of science. By such philosophers it is now fre quently urged that we should take metaphysical speculations more seriously than has been customary of late since they have contributed, and may still contribute, in an important way, to the development of scientific theories. My main purpose here is neither to add further arguments for the view that metaphysical statements are meaningless nor, on the other hand, to show that they are, after all, meaningful. Indeed, I shall give no more than a passing glance to such questions because I regard them as irrelevant to my aim, which is to make some tentative suggestions about the way in which metaphysical speculations influence scientific theorizing and about the features of both which make this possible. For this purpose, I shall accept Karl Popper's distinction between scientific and metaphysi cal statements on the grounds that scientific statements are, at least in principle, falsifiable and that metaphysical statements are unfalsifiable, even in principle.21 shall ignore the difficulties attached to this criterion because I do not know of a better one and because if we are to talk of the influence of metaphysics on science, as many people do, we need some means of distinguishing between them. 187</page><page sequence="2">PETER ALEXANDER The alleged facts of the situation are fairly well documented; both historians and philosophers of science have recently devoted much time and space to showing how metaphysical speculations, and even myths, may develop into, or contribute towards the development of, scientific theories.3 Karl Popper and, in greater detail, A. G. M. van Meisen, have traced the growth of the modern atomic theory from Parmenides via Democritus. Ernst Cassirer has given examples of other such influences in a number of his works. J. W. N. Watkins has recently gone further and argued that certain statements, such as "Every event has a cause", are, at the same time, metaphysical, in some sense factual and, moreover, useful to scientists. Stephan K?rner has given examples of specific influences in modern physics and put forward a view to account for them. Paul Feyerabend has argued that our experience has been so constricted by the theories of classical physics that we could never have begun to think non-classically if we had had to rely on experience alone and could not have had recourse to abstract metaphysical theories or, in Einstein's words, "free creations of the mind". I shall also mention, later, the current emergence of a physical theory partly from the metaphysics of Leibniz and Hegel at the hands of David B?hm.4 Even a fairly superficial examination of these manifestations shows that we must make distinctions if we are to avoid an illegitimate blurring of the line between science and metaphysics. Mr. Watkins has said 5 "the logical empiricist is attempting the logically impossible when he tries to erect a cordon sanitaire between science and metaphysics" and I have heard these facts taken, in discussion, as showing that there is not really much difference between metaphysical and scientific theories after all. Such statements, I believe, suffer from too great a generality owing to a failure to distinguish between different kinds of metaphysical state ments. It is understandable that this failure should occur when we are emerging from a climate in which metaphysical statements were often regarded as meaningless, in a body, and therefore hardly worth talking about. But we can distinguish different kinds of metaphysical statements even if we do not wish to be metaphysicians or to accept metaphysical statements in the spirit in which they are usually put forward. When, for instance, Popper says "The Copernican system... was inspired by a neo-Platonic worship of the light of the sun who had to occupy the 188</page><page sequence="3">SPECULATIONS AND THEORIES 'centre' because of his nobility" 6 and Watkins points out that metaphysi cal statements such as "Every event has a cause" are logically related to empirical statements they are talking, I think, of different kinds of metaphysical statements about which different things have to be said. I hope I can take it as agreed that metaphysical speculations have been fruitful in stimulating scientific ideas and that the positivist's dismissal of them as meaningless, whether justified or not, has carried with it the disadvantage of helping to obscure the extent and importance of this stimulation. We have profited by the empiricists' attempts to bring out the difference between scientific and metaphysical statements even if they reached conclusions which many philosophers now consider extreme. The various attacks on inductivism, however, show signs of going, equally misleadingly, to the opposite extreme of denying not only that the more interesting scientific statements are derivable in a precise way from experience but also that they are even suggested by experience.7 In our anxiety to do justice to the importance of metaphysics in this respect we must avoid, first, confusing different kinds of metaphysical statements and, second, running together scientific and metaphysical theories. I shall discuss these two dangers separately. If we mark off metaphysics from science by the falsifiability criterion we must resist the attendant temptation to treat the unfalsifiable class as homogeneous. It is all too easy to regard all metaphysical statements as of the same kind, the unfalsifiable, meaningless, nonsensical kind. I have said that I do not want to call them "meaningless" and I now want to argue that their unfalsifiability does not entail that it is unnecessary to distinguish different kinds of metaphysical statements. I propose, for convenience of reference, to label two kinds of metaphysi cal statements "soft" and "hard". I call "soft" such statements as "Every event has a cause" and "Every mental event has a physical determinant"; I call "hard" such statements as "The sun must occupy the centre of the universe because of his nobility" and "The monads have no windows". Soft metaphysical statements involve only concepts which can appear in scientific statements, e.g. event, cause : hard metaphysical statements involve concepts which logically cannot appear in scientific statements, e.g. monad, soul. There may be borderline cases, that is, metaphysical statements to which we are not sure which label to apply, 189</page><page sequence="4">PETER ALEXANDER but even if we cannot put each metaphysical statement unequivocally into one of two sharply demarcated classes it is enough for my purpose if there are metaphysical statements which have the characteristics I am marking by the labels "soft" and "hard". I believe there are. On the colour spectrum, although we have a continuum, a clear distinction can be made between yellow and blue. Even if metaphysical and scientific statements lie on a continuum we can distinguish between hard and soft metaphysical statements and scientific statements which lie at the centres of certain stretches of the continuum. There might be some disagreement about whether soft metaphysical statements are indeed metaphysical but if they are this appears to be closely connected with their generality, since they may be arrived at by generalizing scientifically respectable statements. Hard metaphysical statements, since the concepts they contain are not to be found in scientific statements, cannot be arrived at in this way. "Every cat eats fish" can be arrived at by generalizing from falsifiable statements of the form "This cat eats fish" ; "Every event has a cause" can be arrived at by generalizing from statements of the form "This event has a cause" but this last statement is not falsifiable because failure to find a cause could never justify our rejecting it; "Monads have no windows" can be arrived at by generalizing from statements of the form "This monad has no windows" but this statement is also not falsifiable. Thus, the statements "This event has a cause" and "This monad has no windows" are alike in being unfalsifiable and so, by our criterion not scientific, but they differ in that the first might be verified by methods acceptable to science while the second could not. We can examine events in an attempt to find their causes but we cannot examine monads in an attempt to discover that they are windowless. Moreover, some statements about events and causes are falsifiable whereas no statements about monads are falsifiable. On the other hand, "This monad has no windows" differs from "This perfect gas behaves in such and such a way" since although we cannot point to perfect gases we could do so if they existed, and they might exist, but we could not point to monads even if they existed. Most of the statements of the great system-builders, from the pre socratics to Bradley, of the kind parodied by Ayer in "The Absolute is lazy", can be described as "hard" and I think it is even true to say that their systems, in so far as they can be regarded as systems, are entirely 190</page><page sequence="5">SPECULATIONS AND THEORIES composed of such statements. They assert the existence of, or purport to describe, monads, substance, absolutes and other entities inaccessible to scientific investigation. It must be remembered, however, that some hard metaphysical state ments look like soft ones, or even like scientific statements, since the same word may be used for different concepts. For instance, statements about atoms defined as indivisible material particles are metaphysical because the scientific statement "Some atoms have been divided" does not falsify the statement "All atoms are indivisible" and hard because no statement about indivisible material atoms can be reached by generalizing from scientific statements about atoms. Thus progress in science is sometimes to be regarded as resulting from the removal of metaphysical statements rather than the falsification of empirical ones. The division of an indivisi ble atom is a logical impossibility so that when the atom was split this showed not that Democritus was wrong in thinking his atoms indivisible but that his concept of the atom had been replaced by a different one. Logical considerations alone could have shown that it was never a scientific concept, as Leibniz might have concluded. In the rest of this essay when I refer to metaphysical systems or theories I shall be referring to systems or theories composed, or largely composed, of hard metaphysical statements. Watkins has urged the respectability of metaphysical statements on the grounds that they are factual assertions about the world, that they unite heterogeneous areas of existence, that they often inspire new programmes for empirical investigation, that they sometimes foreshadow scientific theories and that they are capable of inconclusive confirmation, though not of proof or falsification.8 He seeks to account for this by what he calls their "all and some" character ("Every mental event has some physical determinant") and two consequences of this. First, they are "weak entailments" of falsifiable empirical statements; for example, "Every mental event has a physical determinant" is weakly entailed by the falsifiable statement "Every mental event is determined by what the person ate for breakfast". Second, they are inconsistent with certain empirical statements; for example, "Every mental event has a physical determinant" is inconsistent with the falsifiable statement "No mental event has a physical determinant". It is because there are such logical relations between metaphysical and empirical statements that Watkins 191</page><page sequence="6">PETER ALEXANDER made the assertion I have already quoted about the impossibility of erecting a cordon sanitaire round metaphysics. I do not wish, here, to criticize Watkins' view except to the extent of pointing out that he has been able to exhibit these logical relations only by concentrating on soft metaphysical statements and I fail to see how he could do the same for hard ones. I cannot see how "Monads have no windows" or "Only one substance can be granted and that is absolutely infinite" could be put in the "all and some" form, or shown to be even weak entailments of, or to be inconsistent with, any empirical statements. Yet metaphysical statements of this sort equally deserve our respect if only because some of them have inspired new programmes for investigation and foreshadowed scientific theories. Indeed, they seem more likely to do so just because they use concepts which are not used in scientific theories, and so are able to suggest new scientific concepts. It looks as if some of the metaphysical statements which influence science in the ways Watkins describes do not have the logical relations to empirical statements which he attributes to them. People sometimes speak as if systems such as those of Leibniz and Spinoza entail statements such as "Every event has a cause", but this is clearly not so if the events and causes referred to are the kinds of things with which science is concerned since the necessary connections in these systems do not hold between such things as can be the objects of scientific in vestigation. The most these systems can do is to suggest the adoption of such a principle but this might also be suggested by empirical investigations. Once we have hit upon the device of causal explanation and found it help ful we may decide to explain as much as possible and express our decision by saying "Every event has a cause" or "Always look for causal laws". Part of the strength of K?rner's view 9 that metaphysical statements function in science as "directives" or "regulative principles" lies in the close connection of soft metaphysical statements with experience and its detailed explanation. But I doubt if the function of hard metaphysical statements can be put just in this way. They may suggest directives but do not themselves function as directives. "Monads have no windows" would not be of great assistance to scientists in the form "Never look for windows in monads" and it cannot be put in the form "Some scientific objects do not have direct but only indirect causal relations between them, so don't waste time looking for direct relations when it is likely that you 192</page><page sequence="7">SPECULATIONS AND THEORIES are dealing with these objects". It cannot be put thus because monads are not scientific objects and the windows they are said to lack are not the causal connections of science. Nevertheless such a directive might be suggested by Leibniz's statement. We may accept a directive on purely pragmatic grounds or we may go further and hold that it works because it says something about how the world is. Hard metaphysical statements do not function as directives but as suggestions about how the world is, in the light of which we may formulate directives for our future guidance. "Every event has a cause" is unlikely to suggest new structural features for a theory since it is formulated after causal explanation has been successful, but the idea of the sun's nobility or the windowlessness of the monads may suggest such features. It seems, then, that the functions of the neo-Platonic view of the sun in connection with the Copernican theory and of Leibniz's system in connection with Bohm's theory are not to be understood by showing that metaphysical statements are "all and some" statements or that they function as directives. It is often said that metaphysical systems are "transformed into" physical theories and this is perhaps correct if we put sufficient weight on "transformed" and remember that everything is what it is and not another thing. I think the relation may be put more precisely by saying that metaphysical theories serve as models for scientific theories by suggesting new concepts or new kinds of structure, where "model" is used in the sense of pattern or artist's model. The scientist may, like the artist, be more or less representational, more or less abstract, but, in this context at least, not tachiste. The transformation which is his task is the construction of a falsifiable theory which embodies the suggested structure or concept. Acceptance of all this must not lead us to blur the distinction between metaphysical and scientific theories. The effect of showing that soft metaphysical statements are weak entailments of empirical statements is, at least, to move the cordon sanitaire and, at most, to lead us to see that it is a mistake to attempt to draw firm lines, while allowing us to continue to hold that there are important distinctions to be made both within and between the groups of statements which we have failed to separate sharply. Hard metaphysical statements are, I claim, not related to empirical statements by any such logical relation. That is why I have been careful 193</page><page sequence="8">PETER ALEXANDER to say that metaphysical statements suggest new scientific theories or modifications of old ones. For this reason, I may say in passing, I am unhappy when Popper, talking of the development of myths into scientific theories, says "It would hardly contribute to clarity if we were to say that these theories were nonsensical gibberish at one stage of their development (i.e. in the myth stage) and would then suddenly become good sense in another".10 If there were some logical relation between the myth or the metaphysical theory and the scientific theory the development of one into the other would perhaps show that myths and metaphysical theories were not, after all, meaningless. But fruitful suggestions may come to the scientist from any source whatsoever, in more or less irrational and accidental ways or in ways which we would regard as highly rational, and perhaps the only common relation between what suggests and what is suggested is that of resemblance, which may be no more than a resemblance of structure. The familiar story of Kekul?'s snake, even if it is apocryphal, is illuminating. The percentage composition of benzene was known but its structural formula was not. All efforts to show that it was some form of chain of six carbon and six hydrogen atoms had failed. Kekul? is said to have dozed off while worrying about the problem and dreamt of a snake which, after going through many contortions, finally put its tail in its mouth. He awoke with the solution that the structural formula of benzene involved a ring. This is as good a way of arriving at a new idea as any and part of the strength of current attacks on inductivism lies in the fact that such things happen. But if the suggestion had been made by a collection of nonsense sounds instead of a visual image, would the fact that a falsifiable statement about the ring structure of benzene resulted from these sounds go any way towards showing that the sounds were meaningful after all? And would the hypothesis of the ring structure be any the worse if it didn't? We might admit the influence of myths and metaphysical theories without committing ourselves to any decision on their meaningfulness although, admittedly, the adopting of metaphysical theories for scientific purposes usually appears to have a more rational foundation than this. I mention this merely to emphasize that I am not packing a great deal into the idea of suggestion. All sorts of things may suggest new ideas for science and whether what suggests is meaningful 194</page><page sequence="9">SPECULATIONS AND THEORIES or not must be decided by examining the details of each particular case. At the opposite extreme from the story of Kekul?'s snake we have examples like the growth of the modern Atomic Theory ou?t of Democritus' Atomism, where a great deal of the content of the meta physical theory as well as its structure suggest the content and structure of the scientific theory. But still the word "suggest" is more appropriate than some stronger word such as "entail". If it is objected that I am making a psychological rather than a logical point I shall not be greatly moved, for if there is a connection, of whatever sort, between metaphysical and scientific theories, some knowledge of the nature of this connection may help us later to discover what char acteristics of metaphysical theories make this possible. In the meantime, if the connection is psychological rather than logical, the distinction between them by means of the falsifiability criterion remains intact and so, consequently, does the entailed distinction on the grounds that metaphysical theories are not explanatory, at least in the way in which scientific theories are. Let us now look a little more closely at an example which shows how the process of transforming a metaphysical into a scientific theory some times works, for the double purpose of reinforcing what I have said so far and of bringing out some further points. I shall choose for this purpose Bohm's theory n which has the advantage of being topical and, for me at least, the advantage that I have had the opportunity of discussing it with its author. I shall mention only as much of it, and its genesis, as is strictly relevant to my theme. Bohm's use of Leibnizean metaphysics springs from his dissatisfaction with the present position in quantum theory according to which we are unable to give a causal specification for certain events within the atom. Leibniz's monad theory suggests to B?hm a world in which there are relatively independent systems (windowless monads), the development of each being determined by its own inner law, each generating for itself its own space and time and each being connected with, i.e. not independent of, all the others at a deeper level (pre-established harmony). Thus, things are seen as unconnected, and events as not determining one another, on one level, e.g. the level of quantum mechanics, while at a deeper level, e.g. ^that of "sub-quantum mechanics", those same things are seen as connected and those same events as determined, through events at this deeper level. 195</page><page sequence="10">PETER ALEXANDER Night does not cause day but the movements of the planets cause the alternation of dark and light. Leibniz's two clocks constitute an analogy for his relatively isolated systems within a wholly deterministic system. But anything with a periodic "beat" may function as a clock and this allows us to have a whole system of clocks within clocks. One clock is an organized system of sub-clocks and these in turn are organized systems of sub-sub-clocks, and so on, where on each level relative independence and determination may both be found and what is seen as undetermined on one level may be seen as determined by a lower level. To use the analogy with ordinary mechanical clocks, we see each clock ticking away according to its own inner law and independently of others. When we find that both were constructed according to the same mechanical principles we see them as connected by these principles. But the clocks function similarly because each is composed of materials which in turn obey their own inner laws; the steel in both functions in the same way, and differently from the copper which in turn functions in the same way in both clocks. Now the replacing of monads by clocks and the defining of clocks in terms not of springs and cogs and hands but of periodic beats allow a fairly accurate reproduc tion of the structure of Leibniz's system, but also mark the transition from a metaphysical to a scientific theory, since periodic beats are the sorts of things that can be observed and measured, allowing at least the theoretical possibility of the falsification of any statement in the theory. One of the chief features of the theory is that an inner structure is postulated even for the so-called "fundamental particles". I am not here concerned with the correctness of the physical theory : even if it proves to be impossible to test in practice, tests are possible in principle. It seems worth noting, too, that physicists, dismayed though they may be by the talk of Leibniz, are coming to recognize that this physical theory is one to be reckoned with and cannot be dismissed as the idle speculation of a crank. I am concerned with the way in which it was arrived at and the attitude of its inventor to it. B?hm constructed his theory partly, as he says, by taking seriously certain aspects of Leibniz's theory, which he recognizes as being in principle unfalsifiable. He also recognizes that his task is to produce from it a theory which shall be in principle falsifiable. The metaphysical theory is clearly being used as a kind of model or pattern for a scientific theory and the suggestive power 196</page><page sequence="11">SPECULATIONS AND THEORIES of the theory has no tendency to make the two theories one, to make the two sorts of theory more like one another than we supposed or to change our views about the logical properties of either the original metaphysical theory or the finished scientific theory. What features of metaphysical theories account for the kind of fruit fulness for science which I am considering? Bohm's use of Leibniz seems somehow more reasonable than Kekul?'s use of his dream snake. 1 am inclined to think that this is partly due to the apparent fortuitousness of Kekul?'s dream. We can choose Leibniz's theory rather than Spinoza's but we cannot choose to dream of a snake at the appropriate time. Apart from this, perhaps the main difference is in complexity, that is, in the extent and character of the suggestions made. One important feature of both examples is that some formal structure is taken from the model and used in a different context. There is a general formal similarity between metaphysical and scientific theories in that both are deductive. The more advanced a science is the more highly formal it is, so that it seems more likely that a metaphysical theory will suggest useful theories for a highly developed than for an undeveloped science. Systematic metaphysicians build just the sorts of theories that are likely to be useful as models for the theoretical physicist. There is something comparable here to the influence of Leibniz on Russell in connection with Principia Mathematica. However, within the general deductive character of metaphysical theories there are vast differences between them in content and detailed structure and this means that one metaphysical theory may be more suggestive than another in a given scientific context. A metaphysical theory may, by virtue of its structure, assist in the development of the purely mathematical part of a scientific theory 12 but it may do more and make suggestions about its interpreta tion and here its content, as well as its structure, becomes important. The kinds of entity (e.g. monads) which are formally organized by the metaphysician may suggest analogous kinds of entity (e.g. clocks) which can be organized in a similar way by the scientist. The scientist is a system builder but in the present connection the metaphysician is the system builder par excellence since, unlike the scientist, he is free from the necessity of connecting his system with the details of actual experience and so can concentrate on internal consistency. At the same time his systems are superior to those of the mathematician for the stimulation of 197</page><page sequence="12">PETER ALEXANDER scientists because they purport to talk about constituents of the universe; in an odd way they combine some of the advantages of both mathematical and scientific theories. Thus the scientist can find likely systems ready made, choose the appropriate one as his model and refashion it in such a way as to give consequences which are in principle falsifiable. My second, and perhaps more controversial, suggestion to account for the fruitfulness of metaphysical theories is that they can be themselves regarded as being, to a limited but not negligible extent, controlled by experience. The ways in which metaphysical theories are built are complex and I do not wish to minimize this complexity but it seems to me that one of the factors which may contribute to them is ordinary everyday expe rience. Thus when Popper speaks of theories as "freely invented ideas" 12 and Einstein of "free mental creations" I think they are both right and wrong. Our invention of theories is free in the sense that one rather than another is not forced upon us by experience, but may be dependent in the sense that we may draw our materials from experience. It is clear that some parts of scientific theories are guided by what Cassirer calls "the pressure of experience", felt through ordinary observations and labor atory experiments, but that the upper reaches of theories are considerably less influenced by this pressure. It may well be that our experience of the world is so much coloured by our three-dimensional theories that experience alone could never have led us to think four-dimensionally. But to say that these upper reaches are influenced by metaphysical theories is not, I suggest, to say that they are influenced by free mental creations rather than by experience but to say that they are, at least in part, influenced by experience by another, longer and more devious, route. Experience, and the ways in which we can talk about it, are so complex that the same set of experiences may suggest many different theories, some metaphysical, some scientific, some more fruitful than others, some more acceptable than others for different people or at different times or in different situations. In this new context, it is perhaps helpful to bring out the difference between scientific and metaphysical theories in another way, by reminding ourselves of the most general questions to which they are intended to provide answers. The scientist asks "How can we account for the way the world is, as observation reveals it to us?" and his answers are guided by his ideal of testability through observation. The metaphysician, combining 198</page><page sequence="13">SPECULATIONS AND THEORIES an assertion with his question, asks "Since the world cannot be just as it appears to us in observation, how it is really?" and his answers are guided by his ideal of intelligibility. My contention is that at least some of his clues for his answers may come from certain aspects of what he observes. No doubt the primary aim of the metaphysician in constructing his theories is the solution of certain logical problems which stand in the way of intelligibility. How are we to make change, or motion, or time, under standable? There are anomalies in our experience of the world but reality "cannot accept inconsistent predicates" so how are these anomalies to be removed? But, however the details of metaphysical theories have in fact been arrived at, the results are such that they could have been arrived at by concentrating on certain features of our ordinary experience of the world, taking these as basic and explaining the other features of our experience in terms of them. That is, they might have been constructed by abstracting from experience those features which fit the metaphysicians' ideal of intelligibility and extrapolating by saying that everything has some character which certain things in our experience have or appear to have, or by saying that something has certain of the characters which things in our experience appear to have but in greater abundance, perfec tion or completeness. The differences between different metaphysical theories would then depend, in part, upon the particular features of experience which were singled out for special emphasis. At least we can say that most metaphysical systems contain concepts which could have been based on experience, but only some of those concepts, and that the specific character of each system is determined by the particular selection of such concepts which appears in it. This is not intended to be a historical point about the way in which metaphysical systems were, in fact, con sciously constructed: it is a point which can be made even if, as a matter of historical fact, there is no evidence that their inventors consciously went through any such process as I have outlined. All I wish to say is that most, and perhaps all, metaphysical systems depend upon concepts which have this character and which could have been reached by the route I have outlined. But having been suitably cautious about the history of philosophy, I shall risk being bolder and say that I am inclined to think that, whatever the conscious process actually involved in the constructing of existing metaphysical systems and whatever the arguments used in support of them, it may well be that the final products were in fact 199</page><page sequence="14">PETER ALEXANDER dependent, in some such loose way as I have suggested, upon experience. If this were not so, it would be difficult to see how such ideas could arise and how we can understand them even as well as we do. All this ought to be supported by detailed examinations of particular metaphysical theories but this is impossible within the limits of this essay. Perhaps a few brief comments on various systems will show that this is a view worth discussing. Our ordinary experience contains apparently static elements as well as obviously changing elements. The system of Parmenides could be regarded as that of a man more impressed by the static elements and the system of Heracleitos as that of a man more impressed by the changing elements. Parmenides could be interpreted as saying that everything really has the static character which many things appear to have while Heracleitos could be interpreted as saying that everything really has the changing character that many things appear to have. Leibniz's and Spinoza's systems could be regarded as being similarly related. It is as if Leibniz concentrated on the unlimited possibility of division of physical objects and the continuity and indivisibility of mental experience and as if Spinoza concentrated on the connectedness of observable things rather than on their separateness. Clearly, purely logical considerations were always in fact involved but Leibniz, at least, seems explicitly to support my view by constantly drawing attention to physical divisibility and the actual divisions in nature. He writes at times almost as if this were evidence supporting his system. We might also regard the more or less observable connections between mental and bodily events as having prompted Spinoza to attempt to avoid the Cartesian dualism. Hegel's system looks like an attempt to give due weight to the alternation between unity and diversity which we encounter as we continually extend our experience in breadth and depth. Bradley was clearly profoundly influenced by expe rience but attached greater importance to the fact that things can be seen as related than to the fact that they can be seen as independent things. The atomists in general can be regarded as stressing the fact that they can be seen as things. If we concentrate on waking perceptions of the world we may attach importance to the claim of perceptions to be externally caused, and seek to remove discrepancies by asserting the existence of external objects which yet do not have the qualities they appear to have. But if we concentrate 200</page><page sequence="15">SPECULATIONS AND THEORIES on the resemblances between dreams and waking perceptions we are more likely to attach importance to the claim of perceptions to be internally caused and seek to remove discrepancies by asserting nothing external to the mind. Ideas of Gods may be arrived at by extrapolation of certain human characteristics which, as Hume has it, are augmented without limit; and such a process is also seen at work in the development of myths and the inclusion of anthropomorphic elements in metaphysical theories. And so on. The examples could be multiplied indefinitely. We may not now be very happy about the arguments put forward in support of metaphysical theories, we may regard the theories themselves as failing to do what their creators intended them to do and as being of no immediate help to us except in the way of satisfying some desire for unity; but most of them are of such a kind that they could have been built up by a judicious use of ordinary experience of the natural world and it may even be possible that such experience in fact went towards their formation in an important way. The relation between metaphysical theories and experience is vague, uncomfortable and difficult to characterize precisely, but perhaps we can get somewhere near it by saying that certain features or aspects of experience serve as models, or at least could serve as models, again in the sense of patterns, for metaphysical theories. The importance of this is, it seems to me, that it is just because metaphysical theories have this character, just because they involve concepts having such connections with experience, that they may in turn serve as models for scientific theories. The points of contact with experience may be the growing points of theories which will account for experience in the scientific way. Because Leibniz's theory arose partly from difficulties about space and time, because minds were free from these encumbrances and could be conceived as creating them, because a close examination of nature revealed developing organizations which could be parelleled by the development of rudimentary minds, and so on, it turns out that his theory is fruitful for B?hm because he, too, is concerned with problems of space and time in physics and needs, to account for the phenomena, some theory involving the idea of relatively independent but ultimately related systems, though not, of course, mind-like systems. Leibniz concentrated on aspects of experience suggesting unrelatedness and so had to show, for the sake of intelligibility, how this could grow out of relatedness and, for the sake of saving the phenomena, how other aspects of experience suggesting 201</page><page sequence="16">PETER ALEXANDER relatedness could be explained. Thus he had grappled with a problem similar to that facing B?hm when nature appears to present features, such as the positions of a given orbital electron at times t and t + 1, which are unrelated where we expect, and hope to find, relations. Metaphysical theories, then, may be regarded as springing from a rejection of certain features of experience and a retention of others. They are constructions from which certain features, regarded as repugnant, are absent. When the scientist faces features of experience which, on the theory he has, he finds repugnant, one of the possible moves is to look for a ready-made theory which avoids just such features and to see if it will give clues for the reconstruction of his scientific theory. Thus, in this context, metaphysical theories do not suffer from the disability that there is no rational means of choosing between them. What rational grounds can there possibly be for choosing between two internally consistent theories if neither has empirical consequences? Here we have an answer, at least for the present context. The pressure of experience urges us towards one rather than another because it, in turn, grew out of, or, at least, is such that it could have grown out of, the same sort of pressure of experience. Experiments, and our present theory, lead us to say that light behaves sometimes in a wave-like way, sometimes in a particle-like way, and that this is ultimate, admitting of no further explanation. If we find this duality awkward we may look for a theory which overcomes such a duality, which contains enough points of similarity with the physical situation to fit it and with the present physical theory, if possible, to enable us to avoid scrapping it altogether. We should be likely to choose one which allows us to talk of different levels such that on one level the wave-particle duality is ultimate but on a deeper level the duality is resolved in a single concept. Leibniz's system is prima facie more likely to be helpful than, say, Spinoza's, since on no level does Spinoza allow a real plurality. On the other hand, in a different situation where we were faced with the kind of problem which a field theory would solve we might obtain more help from Spinoza than from Leibniz, since he was mainly concerned with showing that nothing is really distinct from anything else. The choice of the scientist is not arbitrary and not ultimately free from the pressure of experience since both he and the metaphysician have been subjected to the same pressure. I do not want to suggest that the fact that scientific theories have been 202</page><page sequence="17">SPECULATIONS AND THEORIES influenced by metaphysical speculation constitutes the only reason for taking an interest in such speculation but only that even those who are most unfavourably disposed towards metaphysics should admit that this constitutes one reason. Neither do I wish to deny that men are capable of free creation. All I have argued is that the creation of metaphysical and scientific theories may be less free and more dependent on comparing, contrasting and abstracting than is sometimes supposed and that it is because they share this character that there are connections between them.
