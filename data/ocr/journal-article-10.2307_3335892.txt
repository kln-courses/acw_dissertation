<plain_text><page sequence="1">BETWEEN CONTINENTS/BETWEEN SEAS Precolumbian Art of Costa Rica Los Angeles County Museum of Art November 2, 1982-January 16, 1983 A decade following his first sighting of America, Columbus once again sailed west- ward across the Atlantic in search of untapped human and natural resources so desperately needed by the Spanish Crown to help stabilize a nascent and languid New World economic base. On this, his fourth voyage, Columbus ultimately headed south, skirting the east coast of Central America. On Sep- tember 25, 1502, his four ships were forced to seek shelter from a violent storm. Safety was afforded by a calm bay protected from the tempestuous sea by a small island. While lying at anchor awaiting fairer weather, Col- umbus's ships were approached by small boats manned by Carib Indians who wore, among other finery, impressive gold figures kv 1. SEATED FIGURE.

These handsome ornaments were quickly exchanged for paltry trinkets of Euro- pean manufacture. Subsequent contact with other gold-bearing inhabitants further to the south convinced Columbus that he had chanced upon a land far richer than any pre- viously explored area of the New World. This land, which was to stubbornly resist Euro- pean conquest in the years to come, today bears the name Costa Rica; the bay in which Columbus anchored to avoid shipwreck fronts this country's largest Atlantic port, Li- m6n. At the time of European contact, Costa Rica was inhabited by some 27,000 Indians, mem- bers of five major groups including numerous tribal divisions of both indigenous and foreign origin. Each cultural group possessed diagnostic cultural traits and world views ex- emplified through distinctive art forms. To- day, nearly five centuries after Columbus's discovery of Costa Rica, an exhibit of unique and often aesthetically powerful objects from this land's pre-Hispanic past is touring the United States. "Between Continents/Between Seas: Precolumbian Art of Costa Rica," dis- plays some 300 jade, gold, ceramic, and monumental stone artifacts from Costa Rican public and private collections. After its May 22 closing at the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, it will travel to the San Diego Museum of Man (July 4-Sept. 25) and finally to the Detroit In- stitute of Arts (Nov. 7-Jan. 29, 1984), which or- ganized the show. "Between Continents/Between Seas" was designed to provide an accurate overview of Costa Rica's rich prehistoric heritage while addressing some of the factors that affected 3. TROPHY HEAD.

Objects on display were selected from each of the country's three major archaeological subareas: the Guanacaste/Nicoya, Central Highlands/ Atlantic Watershed, and Diquis regions. Dates for these artifacts were assigned on the basis of a chronological sequence established in 1980 for Central American archaeology in general: Period I (?-8000 B.C.), Period II (8000-4000 B.C.), Period III (4000-1000 B.C.), Period IV (1000 B.C.-A.D. 500), Period V (A.D. 500-1000), Period VI (A.D. 1000-1550). Upon entering the exhibit, one is intro- duced first to the Guanacaste/Nicoya ar- chaeological subarea, which encompasses the mountainous, sparsely populated Nicoya Peninsula along with the adjacent plain of Guanacaste in the northwestern portion of the country. In pre-Hispanic times, the Nicoya Peninsula and presumably sections of Guanacaste were inhabited principally by the Chorotega. This cultural group appears to have originated in Mexico (possibly in the re- gion of Chiapas). Sometime during the 15th century A.D., an undocumented number of Chorotega emigrated to the south, ultimately settling in northwestern Costa Rica. The Chorotega may well have been the largest and most advanced of Costa Rica's res- ident populations, numbering approximately 10,000 at the height of their cultural flores- cence. According to ethnohistoric accounts, the Chorotega were divided into eleven clans governed by a chief. Their towns were unfor- tified, with markets and ritual structures often situated around a central square or plaza. Such settlements were surrounded by culti- vated fields that traditionally were worked by females. Principal crops included corn, cot- ton, beans, cacao (used as a form of currency as well as an item of trade), and assorted trop- ical fruits. Repeated warfare with neighboring groups supplied victims for religious rituals that included human sacrifice and can- nibalism. In brief, the Chorotega were settled agricul- turalists with an established social hierarchy 4. FEMALE FIGURE. REPORTEDLY FROM FILADELFIA VI- CINITY, GUANACASTE. EARLY PERIOD V ca. A.D. 500-800. CERAMIC, 68cm. INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE SEGUROS. maintained, to a large extent, by standardized ritual beliefs and ceremonial activities. Fur- thermore, agriculture appears to have been integrally associated with ritual in Chorotega society, as certain classes of artifacts displayed in "Between Continents/Between Seas" clearly illustrate. For example, the exhibition contains an array of miniature celts that, be- cause of their relatively uniform size, shape, and manner of execution, appear to conform to an established pre-Hispanic artistic canon. Fashioned in numerous colors of jade, these celts typically are adorned with an avian motif. In addition, many of the celts display a transverse perforation that suggests they may have been suspended in some manner. Gen- erally speaking, these artifacts are too small in size and too elaborate in design to have served as an everyday cutting, chopping, or ground- breaking implement. Furthermore, their lus- trous finish bears little if any evidence of ac- tual use. From their abundant presence in funerary contexts, it would appear that av- iform jade celts were more ceremonial than utilitarian in function. Large, intricately carved grinding tables, metates, form another class of artifacts typical of the Guanacaste/Nicoya subarea. These imp- 75</page><page sequence="3">5. FEMALE FIGURE.

The under- side of the metate platform is often or- namented with anthropomorphic or zoomor- phic motifs, as are the legs. In more ornate examples, decorative motifs are executed in openwork; the presence of a projecting head and neck gives such metates the appearance of a stylized animal. It is unlikely that these im- plements were utilized to process food (or any other material) on a regular basis, though evi- dence of some usage is manifest on the grind- ing surfaces of various specimens on display The hypothesis that these metates were primarily ceremonial in function is further substantiated by the fact that they occasion- ally appear in graves, where they serve as biers for the deceased. Superficially, celts and metates may not seem to have a lot in common. However, celts can be regarded as agricultural tools when used to fell obstructing trees or to break ground prior to cultivation; metates are fun- damentally food-processing implements. Both of these artifact types, as noted above, appear in ritual contexts and are seemingly too ornamental in design to have functioned as purely secular objects. It is possible that, in pre-Hispanic times, northwestern Costa Rica was the center of a religious complex whose focus was associated with control over ag- riculture and/or food processing. 6. AVIAN PENDANT REPORTEDLY FROM SAN ISIDRO DEL GENERAL VICINITY DIQUIS. LATE PERIOD V-PERIOD VI, ca. A.D. 700-1500 GOLD, 9.6cm. BANCO CENTRAL DE COSTA RICA Ceramics on display from the Guanacaste/Nicoya subarea illustrate a number of interesting aspects of pre-Hispanic life in northwestern Costa Rica. Various figurines, for example, are ornamented with elements that appear to represent body paint- ing or tattooing (Fig 4). Articles of clothing are depicted, as are weapons and musical in- struments. Deformation of the human body seems to have been a subject that intrigued the Chorotega artist. Examples of hunchbacks and specimens manifesting artificial lambdoidal flattening of the skull clearly attest to this fact. It is interesting to note the abundance of iconographic motifs found on these ceramic pieces which are recognizably Mesoamerican in origin. Special-purpose polychrome ceramic types such as Galo (Period V), Jicote, Pataky, and Birmania (Period VI) clearly illus- trate foreign influence from the north (Fig. 2). Representations of Mesoamerican deities in- cluding Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl, and Ehecatl are found in abundance; assorted Maya stylistic attributes are also discernible. It appears from this evidence that at least two waves of immi-. grants entered northwestern Costa Rica in prehistory One group was clearly subjected to central Mexican influence prior to arriving in Costa Rica, while the other retained numerous Maya traits possibly transmitted directly from Honduras or Guatemala. The Central Highlands/Atlantic Watershed region constitutes a second major archaeolog- ical subarea of Costa Rica. The Central High- lands include a section of the Cordillera Cen- tral, a massive range of mountains incorporat- ing some of the highest peaks in Central America. Adjacent to the Central Highlands to the east, the Atlantic Watershed area is characterized by verdant lowlands subjected to intense rainfall of such magnitude that it is generally measured in meters rather than in centimeters. As a result, much of this latter region is blanketed by tropical rain forests so 7 PENDANT TWO-HEADED FIGURE REPORTEDLY FROM FARM 4, PALMAR SUR, DIQUIS LATER PERIOD V-PERIOD VI, ca A.D. 700-1500 GOLD, 7.5cm BANCO CENTRAL DE COSTA RICA dense as to render many areas inaccessible. Heavy rainfall and acidic soil have conspired to all but totally destroy any remaining or- ganic archaeological remains. Still, we can get some idea of the pre-Hispanic way of life here by returning once again to the ethnohistorical record; the Carib will serve as an instructive cultural example. About the time the Chorotega were migrat- ing to northwestern Costa Rica, Carib Indians from Venezuela and the Caribbean islands were settling along the shores of the Atlantic Watershed. The Caribs of Costa Rica num- bered approximately 12,000 in the 16th cen- tury A.D. and were divided into two major tribes, the Guetares and the Viceitas. Evi- dently, both were belligerent peoples who were constantly at war with their neighbors; the taking of trophy heads was not uncom- mon (Fig.3). Though the Carib were primarily hunters and gatherers, the women tradi- tionally cultivated small plots of beans, corn, and yucca (manioc). Because of their integral association with both primary food produc- tion and procreation, depictions of females in Central Highlands/Atlantic Watershed pre- Hispanic art often emphasize the general no- tion of fertility However, the artistic render- ing of this concept is, at times, less than flat- tering (Fig. 5). Religious beliefs of the Caribs were centered around animism and ancestor worship. While human sacrifice was prac- ticed, cannibalism was not. The objects on display in "Between Continents/Between Seas" clearly illustrate a number of diachronic trends that characterize the Central Highlands/Atlantic Watershed ar- chaeological record. Specifically, one can see a shift in the flow of foreign influences through time in this subarea. In early periods, for example, during Period IV, Mesoamerican in- 76</page><page sequence="4">fluence is already present in the Central High- lands in the form of distinctive vessel shapes (e.g., the tecomate) and styles of decoration. Also, the type of bean commonly cultivated during this time was more closely related to Middle American than South American species. Jade objects continue to display Mesoamerican motifs. Indeed, unworked jade may have been obtained principally from various Mesoamerican sources. Not only does there exist a strong Middle American influence during Period IV, but one also notes a rise in the nature and number of high-status objects as well. Flutes, rattles, finely executed jades, ceremonial mace heads, and distinctive "flying-panel" metates are notable examples. Evidently, lucrative trade with foreign regions to the north sparked increased social stratification coupled with expanded ceremonialism. During Period V, however, jade ceases to be an important medium for artistic expression. Instead, there is an ever increasing emphasis placed on the working of gold. The sudden drop in the use of jade may be directly as- sociated with the fall of Teotihuacan in central Mexico. The untimely demise of this politi- cally and economically powerful center no doubt seriously disrupted the flow of trade goods, including jade, to Central America. At roughly the same time, the Central Highlands/Atlantic Watershed subarea was being settled by peoples from Panama and northern South America, areas where goldworking had a long established tradition. Cultural groups such as the Caribs therefore were responsible for introducing Costa Rica in general to large-scale use of new high-status raw material at a time when jade sources had become inaccessible. Comparatively little is known concerning the prehistory of the Diquis region, Costa Ri- ca's third major archaeological subarea. This is primarily because fewer controlled ar- chaeological excavations have been con- ducted here. The Diquis subarea encompas- ses all territory south of Quepos on the Pacific Coast and west of the Talamanca Cordillera in the south central portion of the country. Vari- ous climatically and topographically diverse ecozones are present in this, the southwest- ern corner of Costa Rica. Numerous cultural groups inhabited the Diquis subarea in pre- Hispanic times. Among these were the Boruca. At the time of European contact, the Boruca occupied the southernmost area of Costa Rica. According to ethnohistorical sources, they numbered approximately 1,000 and lived in well-fortified, permanent settlements. Like the Caribs, the Boruca were extremely war- like. Even their women joined them in battle when not occupied cultivating large crops of corn, cacao, cotton, and fruits. Cone-shaped structures of wood and grass called palenques served as houses for extended family groups. Cotton garments were woven by elderly men and decorated with elaborate embroidery. Male prisoners of war were sacrificed to pow- erful local deities, while captured women and children were retained as slaves, later to be sacrificed upon the death of their master. Quantities of gold were obtained from nearby rivers and fashioned into a wide assortment of objects. Apparently, the Boruca migrated to southern Costa Rica from Colombia around A.D. 1000, bringing with them a firm knowl- edge of goldworking techniques including al- loying, annealing, and soldering; hammered repouss", "lost wax" casting, and filigree. "Between Continents/Between Seas" con- tains an interesting assortment of Diquis ar- tifacts. Regarding ceramics, the Tarrag6 Bis- cuit pottery type of Period VI is especially at- tractive with its elegant forms and simple yet effective tiny applique ornaments. Figurines, too, may be stylistically simplistic in form, with abstract rendering often obscuring realism (Fig. 1). Examples of stone sculpture are impressive, but typically are not as ornate as similar specimens from the other two ar- chaeological subareas located to the north and east. Anthropomorphic peg-base carved stone figures are characteristic of the Diquis region. These are generally highly stylized and seemingly two-dimensional in appearance; the overall representation is suggestive of South American goldwork. Perhaps best known of the stone artifacts from Diquil are the large stone spheres whose original function and technique of manufac- ture remain a mystery to this day. These spheres, which reach a size of two meters in diameter and may weigh as much as sixteen tons, are frequently a mere one to two cen- timeters shy of being perfectly round. A small stone sphere is on display at the exhibit's exit. Diquis goldwork is a focal point of "Be- tween Continents/Between Seas." Gold discs and pendants manufactured using one or more of the techniques noted above depict both natural and mythical subjects in an often striking manner. Figures of frogs, bats, birds (no doubt similar to the "gold figures fashioned in the shape of eaglets" obtained by Columbus; Fig 6), scorpions, spiders, crabs, and deer are numerous. Of particular interest are various figures engaged in some sort of ac- tion, for example, an alligator devouring a man; a deer grasping a corncob in its mouth; a bicephalous anthropomorphic figure (Fig. 7) that appears to be playing two flutes. Danglers (small suspended elements) are often incorporated into the design of a Diquis gold piece. Also, some specimens are fully ar- ticulated. In general, I was favorably impressed with "Between Continents/Between Seas." The exhibit adequately fulfills its twofold role of illustrating the development of Costa Rican prehistoric art and delineating some of the factors affecting its evolution. Furthermore, it is accompanied by one of the most informa- tive and best-organized traveling exhibit cata- logs I have seen (Harry N.Abrams, N. Y., in association with the Detroit Institute of Arts, $17.95 paper). I must admit, however, that I was disappointed with at least two aspects of the show. While the exhibit endeavors to display the most beautiful, the most unusual, the most complete, or the most representative speci- mens of pre-Hispanic Costa Rican art, it fails to incorporate some of the more controversial artifacts recovered in recent years. For exam- ple, much discussion has centered around a Period VI Diquis Tarrag6 Biscuit ware zoomorphic effigy figure, which some claim represents a camelid, specifically a llama or a guanaco. The depiction of a camelid on an ar- tifact ultimately found considerably north of the Andean region of South America poses a number of interesting questions concerning ancient trade routes that may have linked peoples in Costa Rica with cultural groups liv- ing south of Colombia. In a similar vein, a striking jade piece was found in 1977 during salvage excavations in Talamanca de Tibas, a suburb of Costa Rica's capital city. Fashioned in the shape of a marine bivalve shell, this artifact bears the engraved Bruce Onobrakpeya NIGERIA'S MASTER PRINTMAKER 32 pp. including essay. 21 photos, 12 in full color. $5 US postpaid.

Furthermore, I was dismayed by the fact that all of the docents I queried regarding various aspects of the show were, in general, poorly informed. Certainly these various criticisms are minor. When "Between Continents/Between Seas" completes its scheduled tour in 1984, the ar- tifcts will be returned to Costa Rica. Whether or not another such traveling exhibit will ever be amassed and exported in the future is de- pendent on numerous economic and political factors. I therefore urge anyone interested in the prehistoric art of Costa Rica to see this show while it is still in the United States. Joseph S. Eisenlauer Los Angeles, California</page></plain_text>
