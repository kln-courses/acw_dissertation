Among other interesting contributions which touch on the subject of Torah reading and study, Reinhard Pummer considers the position in early Samaritan synagogues, our knowledge of which has been greatly extended by recent archaeological work. [N.R.M DE LANGE] PJ. GENTRY, The Asterisked Materials in the Greek Job. Septuagint and Cognate Studies Series 38. xxxvii + 559 pp. Scholars Press, Atlanta, GA, 1995. This is a slightly revised version of the author's PhD thesis presented to the University of Toronto in 1994 (supervisorJ.W. Wevers). Gentry provides an exhaustive analysis of the asterisked material in the Greek text of Job. The study was aided by the publication in 1982 of the Gottingen volume by J. Ziegler, which provided a reliable platform for examining the reviser's text. The work falls naturally into three sections, in addition to the con- clusion. First, Gentry ascertains exactly what material can be attributed to Theodotion. A brief historical survey of the textual tradition and an introductory methodology pre- cede a detailed examination and analysis of Ziegler's edition. Once the scope of the project has been established, the second chapter attempts a characterisation of the material. Nouns, pronouns, verbs, transliterations and particles are considered, in addi- tion to verbless clauses and word-order. This type of method is employed "since even a cursory examination of the asterisked materials reveals that the approach of R in rendering the Hebrew is literalistic and quantitative" (p. 85). Naturally this assessment of translation technique is rather lengthy-just under three hundred pages-but it pro- vides a firm basis for the section that follows. Ch. three attempts to place the aster- isked material in the larger textual history ofJob, by contrasting R with the Old Greek of Job, the "So-Called Kaige Group" (Minor Prophets Scroll from Nahal Hever), the Greek Psalter and Aquila. A very brief final chapter summarises Gentry's conclusions. The volume concludes with four appendices, proposed corrections to the lemma of Ziegler's edition, and a bibliography. [J.M. SQUIRRELL] J.C.L. GIBSON, Language and Imagery in the Old Testament. ix + 166 pp. SPCK, London, 1998. Even if Gibson admits that the OT is "capable of causing not a little embarrassment to the two religions which have adopted it as their Scriptures", he finds it also "seductive", "moving" and "illuminating". His little book is meant to guide the reader to fuller appreciation of these latter qualities and in this he must be judged to have succeeded. His first of seven well-written chapters, entitled "The Energies of the Hebrew Language", suggests the lack of abstract terms and the linking together of clauses by "and" as the "two basic characteristics of biblical Hebrew". The picture is filled out by several not unimportant features: prominence of direct speech, cosmo- logical descriptions of heaven and Sheol, the extravagance of Semitic address, folk ety- mologies, figurative language, hyperbole, personalisation, irony, etc. Throughout this chapter Gibson indicates the considerable distance which separates theological lan- guage from that of the OT. In ch. two ("Language about God in the Old Testament"), Gibson approaches the (non-)problem of anthropomorphism by way of the recognition that all theology is metaphorical. Faced with such incautious expression, the point is to understand rather than to approve. A discussion of the incomparability of Yahweh (closer to henotheism than to monotheism) rounds off the chapter. Full-blown monothe- istic statements such as Isa. xliii 10 represent "the exaggeration of faith" rather than systematic theology, since so much of the OT refuses to evacuate creation of other "theologically real" gods. Ch. three ("The Rhetoric of Hebrew Prose Writing") asks us "Why Prose?", a question occasioned by the paucity of ancient near eastern precedent. En route to a tentative answer in terms of narrative theology, Gibson guides us through such features as composite authorship, reticence, the resonance of key words, and char- acterisation by what the protagonists say, here and there pausing to criticise the "fissiparous tendencies" of "excavatory scholarship", too full of sources and too deaf to accomplished story-telling.
