<plain_text><page sequence="1">The "Psalter" of Feodor and the Heresy of the "Judaizers" in the Last Quarter of the Fifteenth Century* CONSTANTINE ZUCKERMAN In 1478 the boyar republic of Novgorod was finally occupied by Muscovite troops. The annexation, which came after years of Moscow's growing sway over Novgorod, constituted one of the greatest achievements of the expansionist policy of Grand Prince Ivan III (1462- 1505). The subsequent integration of the former republic into the autocratic Grand Principality of Moscow was expectedly painful.1 To eradicate real or imagined seditions, Ivan III initiated a long series of confiscations, deportations, and executions. Yet it was not until the city was virtually ruined by his grandson, Ivan IV (the 'Terrible"), that the sin of Novgorod's bygone liberty was fully expi- ated. Politics aside, the conquest of Novgorod had another, quite unexpected sequel. Archbishop Gennadii, appointed to the Novgorod see in 1484, was soon to discover that his eparchy was infested with a heresy which he ini- tially defined as a mixture of Judaism with "Marcionism and Messalian- ism." The only analogies he could find between "the chapters against the Messalians (Bogomils)" in the Kormchaia book and the practices of the Novgorod heretics, however, were the non-observance by the heretical priests of abstinence from food and drink before a mass, and the heretics' readiness to deny under oath all their unorthodox beliefs. For lack of better evidence, he eventually abandoned the second part of his accusation.2 The I express my gratitude to my teacher, Professor V. D. Levin, who supervised the writing of this study; to Professors M. Altbauer and S. Pines, who read its initial version and shared with me their valuable remarks; and to Miss H. Zuckermann for her helpful comments. 1 V. Bernadskii, Novgorod i Novgorodskaia zemlia v XV veke (Moscow and Leningrad, 1961), p. 200ff.; J. L. I.

However, in a subsequent letter to Metropolitan Zosima (sent at the beginning of October 1490), he concentrated on the accusations of Judaism, and the charge of Messalianism was not brought up at the church coun- cil of October 1490, which condemned the heretics on his instigation {AED, pp. 379-86).</page><page sequence="2">78 CONSTANTINE ZUCKERMAN main charge against the heretics remained their alleged Jewish leanings, and here, indeed, their persecutors could present a better case. Contacts with the Jews In a letter to the newly appointed Metropolitan Zosima (1490-1494), Gen- nadii traced the emergence of the heresy to a certain Jew who came to Novgorod from Kiev with Prince Mykhailo Olel'kovych (1470): "And from that Jew," claimed the archbishop, "the heresy spread in the land of Novgorod."3 The name of this Jew was given as Skharia in the "Story of the Recently-appeared Heresy" written by Iosif, abbot of the Volokolamsk monastery. Iosif blamed Skharia for the seduction into Judaism of two Novgorod priests, Denis and Aleksei. Both priests, according to the "Story," used the subsequent arrival at Novgorod of the Jews Osiph Shmoilo Skariavei (probably Skharia-bey) and Mosei Khanush to learn more about Judaism, and even expressed the wish to have themselves cir- cumcised. The Jews are said to have dissuaded Denis and Aleksei from taking a step that could result in their exposure by the Christians, but they did change Aleksei 's name to Abraham and his wife's to Sarah and advised both priests to practice Judaism secretly.4 There is no reason to assume that this story was invented by Iosif, who could hardly know that in the Jewish tradition the names of Abraham and Sarah, the first gentiles converted, are those most commonly given to proselytes. The tale's most probable source was the priest Denis himself. Arrested in Moscow in October 1490 together with a group of other here- tics, Denis was tried by the assembled church council and declared his full repentance.5 Having renounced the heresy, he was not in a position to refuse his interrogators information on its origins. Nor, apparently, did he resist the temptation to diminish his own guilt by denouncing Aleksei, already dead by the time of the council, as the only quasi-convert to Juda- ism. Confidential details on the Jewish contacts of the first heretics would not have been available to Gennadii, who wrote before Denis's arrest and interrogation. Thus, the fact that these details first appeared in Iosif s "Story" by no means undermines their authenticity. 3 AED, p. 375. 4 AED, pp. 468-69. D AED, pp. 382-86; 388.

The real issue was to expose the actual beliefs and practices of the accused as a deviation from Orthodoxy - to prove, as Gennadii reiterated in his letters, that the entire body of the heretics were "of Jewish mind."6 The archbishop provided two specific grounds for the allegation. The first concerned the heretics' use of the Jewish system of chronology, with which they became acquainted through a translation of the "Six Wings," a fourteenth-century Hebrew astronomical treatise by Immanuel ben- Jacob.7 Interest in the "Six Wings" in the Ukraine and, later, in Novgorod was generated by the failure of the world to end at the close of the seventh millennium - i.e., in September 1492, according to Orthodox chronology. The Jews, on the other hand, who put the creation of the world at a much later date, were, by their counting, still safely in the third century of the sixth millennium. Gennadii himself admitted in 1489 that if the end of the world did not come as expected, it would further embolden the heretics "and put a great strain on Christianity." Thus "the heretics of Jewish mind. . .having studied the 'Six Wings,' " could use it all the more suc- cessfully "to seduce the Christians."8 6 AED, pp. 310, 316, 318; cf. pp. 375-76, 383. 7 A. Sobolevskii, Perevodnaia literatura Moskovskoi Rusi XIV -XVII vekov (=Sbornik ORIaS 74) (St. Petersburg, 1903), pp. 413-19, provides a partial edition of the text; cf. V. Kuzakov, Ocherki razvitiia estestvennonauchnykh i tekhnicheskikh predstavlenii na Rusi v X-XVII vv. (Moscow, 1976), pp. 78-81. 8 AED, pp. 318-19.

And as to the 'Six Wings' that they studied and with which they seduce the Christians imagin- ing that they bring an omen from heaven, it is not their invention" {AED, p. 31 1). la. Luria, in his "Unresolved Issues in the History of the Ideological Movements of the Late Fifteenth Cen- tury," in Medieval Russian Culture, éd. H. Birnbaum and M. Flier (= California Slavic Studies 12 [1984]), pp. 156-67, following the unpublished thesis of J. Howlett, claims that "it is abso- lutely impossible to confirm that the reference to zhidovskie chisly 'the Jewish calender', belongs to the heretics themselves and was not reconstructed for them by Genadij" and con- cludes that "it is apparently unjustified to include Shestokryl" among books read by the here- tics. Luria does not cite Gennadii's more explicit reference to "the heretics of Jewish mind" who "have studied the Six Wings," but he probably does not consider it sufficiently confirmed either; also, he does not hesitate to dismiss as "legendary" (p. 62) the Jew mentioned by Gen- nadii and identified as Skharia by Iosif from Volokolamsk. However, Luria' s hypercriticism loses much in conviction because it is so strikingly selective. In spite of the fact that none of Gennadii's statements can be in any way "confirmed," Luria accepts his letters as a generally</page><page sequence="4">80 CONSTANTINE ZUCKERMAN No wonder, then, that Gennadii stressed the other evidence for the Jew- ish character of the heresy. The repented heretic Naum, who denounced his former fellows before the Novgorod archbishop, supported his accusations with a written corpus delicti: "the booklets (tetradi) according to which they prayed in a Jewish manner."9 Gennadii identified the contents of these booklets as psalms, and explained the emergence of this Jewish version of the Psalter in a special excursus. As punishment for the crucifixion of Christ, God let the Jews be exiled and their holy books destroyed. The Christians alone preserved an authori- tative translation, procured 300 years before Christ by King Ptolemy. Yet the Jews made up for their loss by adopting the texts "expounded" for their sake by the heretics and renegade Christians Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion. "Thus the Jews of our times," concluded Gennadii, "hold to the heretical tradition, having distorted the psalms of David and the prophe- cies according to what the heretics transmitted to them."10 The use of this Jewish Psalter by the Novgorod heretics appeared to present such a manifest divergence into Judaism that Gennadii sent "the booklets" to Metropolitan Gerontii and to Ivan III as material evidence sup- porting Naum's testimony.11 To Gennadijs disappointment, his request for a full-scale condemnation and execution of the heretics met with little response: the entire matter was considered of little importance, and the Psalter itself seems to have made no impression in Moscow at all.12 But the Novgorod archbishop aid not give up. About three years later, he urged the new metropolitan, Zosima, to follow the apostolic rules against intercourse with Jews and Judaizers and to take measures that "no Orthodox Christian reliable source (see la. Luria, "L'hérésie dite des judaisants et ses sources historiques," Revue des études slaves 45 [1966]: esp. p. 56); he starts requiring some unspecified "confirmations" only when the archbishop happens to mention the Jewish aspect of the heresy. 9 AED, pp. 310, 316. 1U AED, p. 319. In Luria's opinion, Gennadn's excursus was directed exclusively against Jews and did not imply the identification of the psalms used by the heretics ("mir skie psalmy," in Luria's definition) with the distorted Jewish Psalter; see la. Luria (Lur'e), Ideologicheskaia bor'ba v russkoi publitsistike kontsa XV-nachala XVI veka (Moscow, 1960), pp. 190-92. However, this fine distinction is not only illogical, but also contradicts the text. In the descrip- tion of the translation procured by Ptolemy, Gennadii stressed that it included "the entire Holy Scripture and these psalms (sita psalmy), that is, the Psalter, as well." The phrase "these psalms" can only refer to the heretical psalms mentioned at the beginning of the same letter (AED, p. 316), which means that Gennadii did consider them to be a distorted version of the biblical Psalter. It is obvious that Gennadii created his peculiar theory on the origin of the Jew- ish Psalter not because of an interest in it per se, but in order to explain the origin of the Psalter used by the heretics. 11 AED, pp. 310,316. 12 See Gerontii's and Ivan Ill's answers to Gennadii, in AED, pp. 313-15; cf.

Gennadii's description of the Psalter used by the heretics notes a number of peculiar features that suggested its identification with the curious con- temporary treatise entitled "Knigy glagolemya Psaltyr'," described in a short introduction as the ' 'twenty kathisma(s) of the Psalter of David the prophet" translated "from the Jewish language into the Rus' language of the Orthodox Christians" by Feodor, "the newly baptized."14 This passage explains why Gennadii was ready to recognize a text which evidently dif- fered from the Orthodox Psalter as a certain - though heretical - version of the Psalter of David. The self-professed Jewish origin of Feodor and his "translation" allowed Gennadii not only to attribute the discrepancy between the heretical and the Orthodox Psalter to a Jewish intrigue, but also to consider the use of the heretical version as a major proof for the Jewish character of the Novgorod heresy. Gennadii proved to be more right, in a sense, than he himself could have suspected. In spite of its perfect structural conformity with the Orthodox Psalter of the Sledovannaia type - Feodor's "psalms" are divided into twenty "kathisma(s)" and followed by nine "odes" - the contents of the self-styled "Psalter" have very little in common with the Psalms of David. N. Tikhonravov was the first to identify some of the "psalms" as transla- tions of certain Jewish prayers, and more were recognized as such subse- quently.15 In view of these findings, the conclusion that the "Psalter" of Feodor is in reality a translation of the Jewish prayer-book Mahazor became commonplace.16 Gennadii's concept of the "Psalter" was revised accord- ingly, yet the heretics' use of it remained the main argument of scholars 13 AED,p.316. 14 Edited by M. Speranskii, "Psaltyr' zhidovstvuiushchikh v perevode Feodora evreja," Chteniia v Obshchestve istorii i drevnostei rossiiskikh (hereafter ChOIDR), 1907, bk. 2; see p. 53, cf. pp. 13-19. 15 Speranskii, "Psaltyr' zhidovstvuiushchikh," pp. 11-12, 44-51; cf.

Meshcherskii, in Istochniki i sostav drevnei slaviano-russkoi perevodnoi pis' mennosti IX-XV vekov (Leningrad, 1978), p. 29, citing P. Kokovtsov, describes Feodor's "Psalter" as a translation of "65 Talmudic prayers"; Luria, in his various publications, defines its source as a "medieval Jewish psalter" (whatever that may be). These slight aberrations do not violate the general consensus, however.</page><page sequence="6">82 CONSTANTINE ZUCKERMAN who considered the influence of Jews and Judaism to be the predominant factor in the shaping of the Novgorod heresy.17 The aim here is to take a fresh look at the text and to check the validity of its accepted interpretation and the historical conclusions it has engen- dered. In fact, some of the problems inherent in identifying Feodor's 4 'Psalter" with the Jewish Mahazor were apparent already to those who propounded the view. In an introductory note Feodor proclaimed his newly found Christian faith, while in a short colophon he dedicated the "transla- tion" to Grand Prince Ivan III and asserted that it was executed "with the blessing and at the request" of Metropolitan Philip (1464- 1473). 18 Feodor was also the author of an epistle "to the entire kin of Judah," in which he described his baptism "with the blessing" of Metropolitan lona (1448-1461) and urged all Jewish people, and especially his own commun- ity of origin - it was Ruthenian-speaking and must have been one of the numerous Jewish communities in the Ukraine or Belorussia - to follow his example and embrace Christianity.19 Why should such a devout Christian translate the Jewish prayer-book? The explanations provided so far have taken the character of spy stories featuring Feodor as the secret agent of the Jewish mission whose baptism was a ploy from the very start, or Feodor as the renegade Christian who betrayed his newly adopted faith and (being in Moscow!) produced a prayer-book for the future use of Skharia "and his collaborators" in Novgorod.20 Such speculations bring us no closer to an understanding of the text and its historical background. A systematic collation of Feodor's text with its sources reveals a very different picture. An exposition of the findings is complicated by the fact that most Slavists do not know Hebrew. I hope that the singularity of the text will command the interest of the reader in spite of this major obstacle. 17 See, especially, Ettinger, "Jewish Influence," pp. 230-32, who cites the earlier literature. 18 Speranskii, "Psaltyr' zhidovstvuiushchikh," pp. 53 and 72. iy M. Sokolov, Posianie Feodora zhidovina, in O eresi zhidovstvuiushchikh = ChOIDR, 1902, pt. 2, p. 109; it is remarkable that Feodor claims to have been "strengthened in the Chris- tian faith" by "my Grand Prince Vasily Vasil'evich, the Tsar of Russia, the pillar of the Chris- tian faith." Feodor's Ukrainian or Belorussian origin is indicated by dialectical traces in his language (Speranskii, "Psaltyr' zhidovstvuiushchikh," p. 36), as well as by the Ashkenazi- Polish recension of his prayers, which contains such characteristic passages as ' ' 'Adir 'adirenu (psalm 9)"; "My yidme lakh umy yishwe lakh" at the end of "Nishmath kol hay" (psalms 55-56); and "Zakhor brith 'Abhraham" after "Shophet kol ha'ares" (psalms 11-12). 20 See, especially, Speranskii, "Psaltyr' zhidovstvuiushchikh," pp. 13-19, 37-39, who cites the speculations of Tikhonravov and the others.

Konrad, Old Russia and Byzantium (Vienna and Stuttgart, 1972), pp. 167-69.</page><page sequence="7">THE HERESY OF THE ' ' JUD AIZERS " 83 Translation from Memory In most of Feodor's psalms, the main part of the text is a passage from a Jewish prayer or a combination of passages from one or several prayers. This free merging of elements from different liturgical texts, as well as the abundance of minor and apparently unconscious deviations from the origi- nal in the translated passages, indicate that Feodor was translating from memory. An instructive example of one such minor deviation occurs in a passage Feodor derived, and somewhat abridged, from the prayer "Unetanneh Tokef ' for the High Holidays: You judge who shall live and who shall die: who [shall perish] by water and who by fire, who by hunger and who by satiation, who shall be struck dead and who shall be strangled .... [psalm 44] The reference to satiation - rather unusual as a cause of violent death - is due to a memory failure brought about by confusion of two liturgical con- texts and possibly facilitated by the slight resemblance in pronunciation of soibha' (satiation) and the original somo (thirst).21 By way of contrast, in Hebrew transcription the two words do not have a single letter in common. So the error could hardly have occurred if Feodor had had a written text before him. A combined text like psalm 36 can hardly be explained except as the result of translation from memory. It consists of supplications from dif- ferent prayers for the High Holidays, supplemented with a few lines of Feodor's own. The translated part reveals characteristic slips of memory: "You look (hliadish' = ro'eh ) in [sic!] the repentance of the repentant ones {kaiushchikhsia = hashavim)" rather than "You have concern (roseh) in the repentance of the wicked ones {hareshaim)"' and, below, "And your right hand is stretched out to accept the wicked ones (hreshnia)" rather than "the repentant ones" of the original. Even more instructive is the transformation of the first passage of the prayer "Geula," due this time not to Feodor's failing memory, but to the peculiarity of the oral liturgical tradition that he followed in his translation. "Geula" is preceded in the morning liturgy by a text from the Bible which ends with the confirmation "I am the Lord your God; Numbers 21 The combination of hunger-plenty (satiation) appears in one of the "Zikhronot," also part of the High Holidays liturgy, in a rather similar context: God judges among the countries "which to hunger and which to plenty."</page><page sequence="8">84 CONSTANTINE ZUCKERMAN 15: (37- )41," and the first passage of the prayer was originally conceived as praise of this divine reminder and promise: True and firm and established and enduring and right and faithful and beloved and precious and desirable and pleasant and revered and mighty and well-ordered and acceptable and good and beautiful is this word unto us forever and ever.22 In the later liturgical tradition, however, this list of attributes was immedi- ately attached in pronunciation to the word God from the preceding biblical quotation. The praises of God's word were as if transferred to God himself, and since the list is long enough, the violation of the formal syntax thus created could not be caught by ear. In the written text of the prayer-book, of course, the biblical text and the "Geula" remain perfectly separate. Feodor, however, followed the oral interpretation and adapted the text accordingly: God is true and firm and established, etc. It is good and beautiful and proper to praise him forever and ever, halleluja. [psalm 59] In this case we cannot ascribe to Feodor a conscious alteration of the text: he just translated what he heard, trying to do so in a syntactically coherent way. He was not always so successful, however. The absence of a written text to consult explains the abundance of errors such as lack of word agreement in number, case, and gender: in recalling the prayers line by rhythmical line, Feodor did not always remember to coordinate the grammatical forms of each translated line with the rest of the sentence. Of special interest are the cases where the disintegration of the syntax is complete, such as in psalms 11 and 58. The opening lines of both psalms are quite comprehensible and allow identification of their respective sources; afterwards, however, only some membra disjecta of the original text can be traced, in a context which makes no sense at all. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that unlike the other psalms, in which Feodor used prayers said every day or at least several times a year, he chose for psalms 1 1 and 58 some rare odes (pizmonim ) recited only once or twice a year.23 In both cases he could remember clearly only the first lines, and the disintegration of syntax that follows seems to reflect his 22 There are numerous English translations of the Jewish prayer-book; cf., e.g., Avodath Yom Hazikaron.

In the transliterations of Hebrew passages I usually did not attempt to reconstruct Feodor' s Ashkenazi pronunciation. ZJ "Shophetkol haares and Atan hu eloheynu bashamayim.</page><page sequence="9">THE HERESY OF THE "JUDAIZERS" 85 agonizing - and vain - attempt to recollect more. If this observation is correct, it provides us a rare insight into the very process of Feodor's toils as translator. The Composition of Feodor's "Psalter" The names of both main versions of the Jewish prayer-book - Siddur, the ' 'orderly arrangement" of the daily prayers, and Mahazor, the "(liturgical) cycle" for each of the big holidays - reveal its essential purpose: to deter- mine not ony the texts for each liturgy, but also their proper order. Thus every separate text becomes functionally void when removed from its appropriate liturgical context, and halakic rules determine how much of the prayer must be reiterated if its sequence is at some stage violated. Feodor's text dispensed with the order of the synagogal liturgy. Of the three daily prayers, not one can be recovered in the "Psalter" in its entirety. Where we do possess nearly all the components of a certain seg- ment of the Saturday morning prayer, the reconstruction of its proper sequel would require the following arrangement of the psalms: 50-56, 27, 18-23, 29-34, 6, 59-64, 66-67. On the average, Feodor switched from one liturgical context to another every two or three psalms: in only a relatively few cases does a more considerable group of five to seven psalms follow the order of one and the same prayer. Thus in the text of the "Psalter" nothing is left of the functional structure of the Jewish prayer-book. The explanation is not that Feodor did not care about the composition of his work, but that he structured it according to a different principle. Aban- doning the triple division of the synagogal liturgy into the evening, morn- ing, and afternoon prayers, Feodor conceived his entire "Psalter" as one liturgical unit. The prayer "'Aleynu Leshabeah," which concludes each of the three daily prayers, constitutes the last two psalms of the closing twen- tieth kathisma of the "Psalter." The benediction "Qadish Yatom," said after each prayer, is divided between "odes" 1, 3, and 4, which "follow" Feodor's "Psalter" in imitation of the Orthodox Psalter of the Sledovan- naia type. And just as Feodor's first five psalms reproduce the beginning of the opening prayer of the Day of Atonement, his last three "odes" are clearly influenced by the so-called psuqey de-zimra, verses pronounced at the closing of the ark, that is, at the very end of the last liturgy of the same holiday. Applying this unified concept, Feodor entirely eliminated the numerous textual repetitions that characterize the Jewish liturgical cycle: no single passage appears in the "Psalter" twice. Ignoring the normative order of the Jewish prayer-book, Feodor arranged his psalms according to the asso- ciation of ideas and images. His sequence of prayers, most absurd from the</page><page sequence="10">86 CONSTANTINE ZUCKERMAN viewpoint of the Jewish liturgy, can often be explained by this new struc- tural principle. Thus Feodor switched from the Saturday morning prayer ("Yoser 'Or," psalms 18-23) to the preceding evening prayer ("Maaribh 'Arabhim," psalms 24-25), since both texts treat the creation of the luminaries. He merged the "Prayer of Rabbi" with the "Prayer before a journey" (psalm 41) and joined them to the "Benediction for the new moon" (psalm 42), because all three contain similar pleas for success in daily life. The translation of the prayer "Geula" (psalms 59-64 and 66-67) is interrupted at the exclamation "Who like you [God] . . .makes wonder" with some of the "Benedictions at dawn," providing an elaborate illustration of the marvels of God "who does his deed in a wonderful way" (psalm 65). There are many examples of this kind, and while not every transition in the "Psalter" lends itself to such an explanation, the associa- tive connections between the different components of the text endow it with a certain literary unity, which is entirely absent from the functionally struc- tured Jewish prayer-book. Not only Feodor' s approach to the order of the prayers, but also his free treatment of their text can often be explained by compositional considera- tions. For example, when breaking up some prayers into several psalms, he modified the text to join the loose ends better. Thus the benediction: Blessed you are, our Rock, our King, our Redeemer, the creator of the holies [i.e., angels]. May your name be praised forever, our King, who creates his servants was not just divided between two psalms, but adapted as the ending of one of them: Blessed you are, our Creator,24 our King, our Redeemer, the creator of the holy angels who praise your name, our King, forever, [psalm 29, fine ] and retranslated as the opening of the other: Praised is your name, Lord, who creates .... [psalm 30]25 Having dissolved all established liturgical contexts in the "Psalter," Feodor scrupulously removed from the texts he had chosen every reference to the specific times and festivals they were instituted to honor. The crea- tion of a single, recycled, and time-detached sequel of texts left no place for this kind of specificity. Thus, from the benedictions for the new moon 24 Feodor followed the erroneous interpretation of sur (rock) as yoser (creator); cf. the instance marked by fn. 28, below. 25 Cf. a similar adaptation at the transition between psalms 28 and 29.</page><page sequence="11">THE HERESY OF THE ' ' JUD AIZERS ' ' 87 (psalm 42) and for the full moon (ode 2) he excluded the lines containing the blessing for the moon itself. The Saturday evening prayer (psalm 47) required a more thorough purification: having omitted the word "Satur- day," a few lines directly referring to the "seventh day," and a short sup- plication about resting on the Sabbath, Feodor concluded his revision by replacing the final benediction for Saturday with a general one taken from the "Benediction for the three festivals." The latter also replaced the origi- nal benediction for the New Year in psalm 57.26 Finally in the text of the evening prayer "Maaribh 'Arabhim" (psalm 24), the author turned "night" into "day and night" and "evening" into "morning or evening," even though the latter addition rendered its context barely intelligible. These two minor alterations reduce Feodor' s intent to break off with the times and fes- tivals of the synagogal liturgy almost to an absurdity, making its conscious character all the more evident. The accepted view of the "Psalter" as a translation of Mahazor thus proves to be misleading: Feodor did not conceive his work as a translation of any existing form of the Jewish prayer-book, nor indeed could it be used as such in any Jewish liturgy. The translated prayers, or passages from prayers, served Feodor as raw material for his own composition. We will now look at the religious experience and ideas underlying this unique remaking of the traditional liturgical texts. The Transformation of Prayers into Psalms The biblical Psalter, like the medieval Mahazor, comprises a collection of prayers. If we set aside all the differences in background, structure, style, etc., between the two texts and simply compare them as two ways of self- expression in prayer, the discrepancy in the "praying ego" becomes strik- ing. The psalms, with relatively few exceptions, are personal prayers com- posed in the first person singular. The prayers of the Mahazor, intended for the common worship of a congregation, speak, with even fewer exceptions, in the name of the entire Jewish people, that is, in the first person plural. In the "Psalter" created by Feodor, the texts from the Mahazor, for all they lose as prayers in the formal halakic sense, acquire the character of a per- sonal, individual prayer. For Feodor not only titled, but also conceived his composition as a psalter. 26 Cf. the passage from psalm 44 that in the original contained a specific reference to the High Holidays: "In the New Year it is written, and in the Day of the fast of Atonement it is signed, who shall live . . ."; Feodor replaced the entire introductory passage with the short: "According to your judgment, [it is decided] who shall live ..." (cited above, p. 83).</page><page sequence="12">88 CONSTANTINE ZUCKERMAN This effect is most commonly achieved by augmenting the prayer, or passage from a prayer, designated by Feodor to become a separate psalm with one or more introductory lines containing a personal appeal to God. About a third of the psalms are provided with such an opening, which can easily be identified in most cases by the contrast between the "I" it features and the "we" in the rest of the psalm. Some of these appeals are quite unsophisticated, like "God, pardon my soul" (psalm 51), "God, pardon me and bless me every day and hour" (psalm 69), or "Praise the Lord, my soul" (psalm 29), borrowed from the Psalter of David and used in a similar capacity in synagogal prayer. Some other introductory passages are more elaborate and require a closer integration in the main body of the psalm. Thus the first line of the prayer "Blessed is he who spoke and there was the world" appears enclosed in a personal supplication: "Bless God, O my soul! God, strengthen my thought and assuage my heart, illuminate my eyes, keep me from a transgression before you, God. Blessed are you, my God, [who] spoke and there was the world. . ." (psalm 72). In psalm 57 Feodor intro- duced a passage which in the original begins with the supplication "Fill us with your goodness and make us happy by your redemption," with the fol- lowing lines: O my soul, bless my God and Lord! You are my procreator and my consoler who filled me with bread at day and with sleep at night .... This statement of fact necessitated a corresponding alteration of the suppli- cation, and so Feodor continued: "... and our fullness is in your goodness, and our happiness is in your support. . . ."27 Not all the introductory pas- sages are equally well formulated, yet their general sentiment is always the same. Such intrusions of personal prayer are not restricted to the opening lines. They may appear after the initial benediction (psalm 24) or in the middle (psalm 21) of the translated text. In psalm 41, originally a prayer for com- mon welfare at the celebration of the new moon, Feodor not only excluded the reference to this particular festival, but also turned the plea "and may you give us a long life" into "and may you give me a long life," so that the entire prayer acquired the character of a personal appeal to God. 27 Feodor eliminated from his Psalter every reference to future redemption expected by the Jews; see below, pp. 89-91, 93.</page><page sequence="13">THE HERESY OF THE "JUDAIZERS" 89 The sixteenth of the so-called "Eighteen Benedictions" appears in the "Psalter" in two versions, which together provide probably the most graphic illustration of the transformation of a common prayer into a per- sonal one. In the first version, Feodor translated this text almost word for word: Hear our voice, Lord our God! Have pity and mercy on us, God our Lord and King! Accept with good grace our prayers, for you are the Lord our God who hears the prayers of your people, [psalm 16] At its second appearance, however, this prayer underwent a characteristic metamorphosis of the "praying ego": Accept my prayer, O God! Hear my voice, O God! Purify my thought, O God, and have mercy on me! Accept with pity our [sic] prayers, for you are Lord God who hears (with) grace, [psalm 68] Contrary to Christianity, in which prayer is a matter of personal piety, in Judaism the common prayer constitutes the climax of community life; its contents are the greatest expression of the unity of the Jewish people. For Feodor this bond is all but lost, and though he prays basically the same prayers, he adapts them to reflect his individual experience, his aloneness and detachment. The Ideological Emendations in the ' 'Psalter ' One of the prayers chosen by Feodor for his "Psalter" bases the plea for the return of the Jewish people to Zion on a prophecy of Zephaniah: At that time I will bring you home, at the time when I gather you together; yea, I will make you renowned and praised among all the people of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says the Lord [111,20]. Feodor reproduced this quotation in a version of his own: I will make you renowned and praised when I gather your gone astray {zabludshikh ) before your eyes, says Lord God. [psalm 71] The famous appeal of Moses to God on Mount Sinai recurs in prayers as a testimony of God's commitment to the future of the people of Israel: Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou didst swear by thine own self, and didst say to them, "I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your descendants and they shall inherit it forever." [Exodus 32:13]</page><page sequence="14">90 CONSTANTINE ZUCKERMAN Feodor modified this commitment as follows: As you say to our father[s] Abraham, Isaac, Jacob: [I] will shelter your children under my hand and save you by my grace and by my holy presence, [psalm 68] A number of passages which underwent similar treatment are scattered throughout the entire "Psalter." Originally they all contained supplications for the restitution of the ancient glory of the Jewish people, yet their con- tents were modified by Feodor to such an extent that the remains of the original wording are barely sufficient for the identification of their sources. Together they provide us with an explicit indication of Feodor' s own view on the subject. From the closing supplication of the prayer "Geula" (the right-hand text below), Feodor retained only the bare framework of the initial appeal and the final benediction: Creator28 of Israel, accept Rock of Israel, arise to the prayers of Israel, the help of Israel do not deprive their and deliver, according to children of the thought and sense your promise, Judah and that knew [or: would know] Israel, our Redeemer, the your graces and your deeds Lord of hosts is his name, eternal and your holiness the Holy One of Israel, and your presence on Mount Sinai and [your] praise from your people, the holy city Jerusalem.29 Praised are you, Lord God, Blessed are you Lord, halleluja. [psalm 67] who redeemed Israel. Feodor reinterpreted the plea for national deliverance as a plea for knowledge of God and his grace, the grace which in Feodor's paraphrase of the verse from Exodus is presented as the pledge for the survival of the Jewish people. The same quest for knowledge was introduced by Feodor into his version of an ode pronounced in Polish-Lithuanian communities after the "Musaf" prayer of the Day of Atonement if a circumcision was performed that day: 28 See fn. 24 above. 29 The concluding portion of the psalm (cf. psalm 5) is appended rather loosely to the initial appeal.</page><page sequence="15">THE HERESY OF THE ' ' JUDAIZERS" 9 1 Remember the covenant of Abraham and the offering of Isaac and the grace of Jacob and bring home the tents of to admonish your people properly Jacob and deliver us for for the sake of those who knew the sake of your name, your holy name.30 Who bears the seal of distinction, the sign of covenant between us and you, our father, if not we in our flesh? . . .

Make happy your mankind endowed with reason, your proper creation, [psalm 12] Again the fulfillment of the covenant is identified with the knowledge of God, once granted and now all but lost; the request to "bring home the tents of Jacob" is replaced with a reminder of the latter's "grace." No trace remains of the main topic of the original text: the symbolic meaning of cir- cumcision as a token of everlasting covenant between God and his people.31 In all the passages cited, the notion of knowledge emerges as Feodor's alternative to the traditional vision of national deliverance so deeply em- bodied in Judaism. The gathering of the "gone astray" is evidently con- nected with their illumination by "the thought and sense that knew (poznavshi)" God's graces, with the supplication not to "bereave our 30 The last words of the phrase "ulichati podobno liudi tvoia delo poznavshi imia tvoje svia- toie" are evidently corrupted, as are many other passages in the text. "Delo" should be read "delia" (cf. "delo imeni eho" which should be "delia imeni eho," psalm 1), and "poznavshi" should be read "poznavshikh": in the latter, the final "kh," often written above the line, was evidently omitted. "Those who knew your holy name" are the patriarchs men- tioned at the beginning of the psalm. 31 Against this background, it was only to be expected that Feodor would eliminate from the prayer "Rseh" every reference to the restitution of the fire-offerings in the temple: Accept, O Lord God, your Accept, O Lord our God, thy people people and bring near you Israel and their prayer; restore our will and our prayers, the service to the oracle of thy to say properly morning house; receive in love and favor and evening praise and both the fire-offerings of Israel adoration to you, God and their prayer, and may the service of thy people Israel be ever acceptable unto thee. [psalm 10].</page><page sequence="16">92 CONSTANTINE ZUCKERMAN hearts of the thought that knew (poznavshi ) your name and deed. ' ' And it is hardly a coincidence that this notion of knowledge reappears with the same persistence in the description of Feodor's conversion to Christianity and in his missionary appeals to his former coreligionists. In the introduc- tion to his "Psalter," our author presents himself as 'Teodor, the newly- baptized, who knew (poznavshi ) light from darkness, good from bad, and who knew holy baptism." In the Epistle already mentioned, Feodor, after a very similar description of his own baptism, directly summons "the entire kin of Judah. . .to know (poznati) the true light" of the Christian faith: "May your blind eyes get opened and may you know (poznali by este) the true light. . . ,"32 The Idiosyncratic Christianity of Feodor the Jew The contents of the work that Feodor presented to his high patrons, Metro- politan Philip and Grand Prince Ivan III, as "the Psalter of David" led scholars to accuse him of a hidden adherence to his old faith. The fact is, however, that this text not only reveals Feodor's alienation from the Jewish religion, but also contains a curious test-case for the sincerity of his Chris- tianity. In the famous "anti-Christian" passage of the prayer " 'Aleynu Leshabeah," originally directed against heathens, the worshipers render praise to the Lord since he has not made us like the nations of the lands and has not placed us like the families of the earth, since he has not made our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitude, for they prostrate themselves before vanity and before emptiness and pray to a god that saves not. For medieval Jews, this passage had an additional, hidden meaning. The numerical value (gimatriya) of the letters in Hebrew constituting "and before emptiness" was found to be identical with the gimatriya of "before Jesus," and so it was interpreted by the worshipers. Hence the custom to spit at the pronunciation of "and before emptiness."33 One could hardly imagine a better opportunity for Feodor to indicate his hidden disdain for Christianity - if that were his true attitude - than by sim- ply translating the words in question as they are and spitting at the appropri- ate moment, perhaps. For he translated "the nations of the lands" as "heathens," and "the families of the earth" as "the sinners of the earth"; also, who in Moscow could suspect that in this passage "emptiness" would 32 Sokolov, "Poslanie Feodora zhidovina," p. 107. 33 See Aleinu Le-shabbe ah, in Encyclopaedia Judaica, vol. 2 (Jerusalem, 1972), cols. 555-58.</page><page sequence="17">THE HERESY OF THE " JUDAIZERS ' ' 93 refer in fact to Jesus? Feodor rewrote the problematic lines, however, in his usual manner: ... for they did not know (ne poznasha ) the strength of their creator [in] their prayer just as [in] their deed, [psalm 73] It is obvious that Feodor was aware of the popular interpretation of the orig- inal text of the passage and wanted to avoid it by all means. Yet Feodor used extreme discretion in introducing his Christian beliefs into the text of the "Psalter," as two more examples will indicate. Con- trary to the Christians who recognized the messiah in the person of Christ, the Jews still await their messiah and pray for his coming. Feodor left most of the prayers pertaining to this out of the "Psalter," but the texts he selected do contain two short references to the messiah still to come. Both were meticulously emended. According to the first of the "Eighteen Benedictions," God "remembers the graces of fathers and will bring a redeemer (go el) to their children's children." Feodor reduced this to "will bring joy. . ." (psalm 1). The exclamation in the Saturday morning prayer "None but you [God] is our redeemer for the days of messiah" became "None but you redeemed (iskupil) us for the final days" (psalm 19). The expectation of the future messiah disappears, and the act of redemption is placed in the past in accordance with Christian belief. These emendations betray the Christianity of the author, yet they are hardly discernable to those unacquainted with the Hebrew text of the passages adapted. Though proclaiming his Christianity, Feodor turned to the Jewish liturgy for the source of his prayers; though praying Jewish prayers, he insisted on making them fully compatible with his newly acquired Christian faith. Moreover, a close scrutiny of Feodor' s prayers reveals clear traces of the Orthodox liturgy as well, especially of the appendix of nine "following" odes peculiar to the Sledovannaia Psalter, read in the church and absent, of course, from the Hebrew original. Be it just an idiom from the ninth ode clumsily installed by Feodor into one of his psalms,34 or the interlacing - this time equally successful in style and substance - of the first following ode of the Orthodox Psalter with a passage from the benediction "Qadish 34 In Feodor's text: "Boh vyshnii daet' milost', s"tvorivyi vsia, pomianuti milost' otets' i prizovet' radost' chadom' " (psalm 1); the use of the infinitive pomianuti, which violates the syntax of the sentence, can be explained only as an imitation of "pomianuti milosti, iakozhe hlahola ko ottsem nashim. . ." in the ninth "following" ode of the Orthodox Psalter (Luke 1:54).</page><page sequence="18">94 CONSTANTINE ZUCKERMAN Yatom,"35 all testify to the gradual penetration of the Christian liturgy into Feodor's religious consciousness. Feodor's efforts to adorn his text with Old Slavonic forms reveal another aspect of the same process. Although this stylization can at times become ridiculous - for example, when Feodor, using obsolete aorist forms, appeals to God in a strange mixture of second person singular and plural36 - it reflects Feodor's will to put his prayers into the proper "Rus' language of the Orthodox Christians,"37 and his gra- dual assumption of his new Christian identity. An outstanding example of this fusion of Jewish and Christian elements is psalm 38, one of the very few in Feodor's text that appear to be entirely original: Great is your grace and the fear of you in heaven and on earth in the heart of each creature. And the heavenly forces, Kherubim and Ophanim, Ajasim, Seraphim, Igri- lim, Akhasim and Asmalim and Mulim and Malakhim, mankind endowed with rea- son, all animals and birds and reptiles and trees and herbs, mountains and valleys, fire and water, sun and moon and stars in their (full) strength, (all) shall praise their God with awe and obey your commandments. (They) long for your grace morning and evening, kneel and reach out their hands before you. High are the ears of you, (who) hears prayers properly, and the grace of your love. The image of all creation worshipping God has certain Hebrew parallels, yet none of them approaches Feodor's radical anthropomorphism in the description of nature.38 The only literary influence detectable in the text of the psalm is of the apocryphal ode of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego known to Feodor as the eighth ode of the Sledovannaia Psalter. The ode is composed of a series of appeals to angels, mountains, birds, animals, etc., to bless and elevate God, and it features, among many others, most of the creatures listed in Feodor's text.39 35 The first part of Feodor's ode 3 is a short summary of the ode of Moses after the crossing of the Red Sea (Exodus 15), which constitutes the first "following" ode of the Orthodox Psalter; cf. Feodor's "Pesn' Bohu poke emu, slava eho nad tvaren'em' svoem' " to "Poem Gospodevi, slavno bo proslavisia," or Feodor's "tsari i kniazi ehipet'skia potopi v mori," to "izbrannia vsadniki. .. potopi v Chermnem mori" in the Slavonic original. On the significance of "Qadish Yatom" in Feodor's "following" odes, see above, p. 85. 36 "Blahosloven ty Hospod' Boh, nah be ödeste, zhazhden be napoiste, alchen nakormiste" (psalm 65). 37 This is how the Rus' language is defined in Feodor's introduction to his Psalter (see fn. 14, above). Jö The closest Hebrew parallel to Feodor s psalm, the so-called rereq bhira, as well as other descriptions of creation worshipping God, were studied by M. Beyth-Aryeh, "Pereq Shira" (Ph.D. diss., Hebrew University, 1967). 39 Cf. "blahoslovite vsia ptitsy nebesnyia, zveri i vsi skoty" in ode 8 to Feodor's "vsiaky zveri i ptitsa i hadi," or "blahoslovite solntse i mesiats, zvezdy nebesnia Hospoda" in the ode to Feodor's "i ospod' ikh solntse i luna i zvezdy v ikh sile strakhom pokhvaliat."</page><page sequence="19">THE HERESY OF THE ' * JUDAIZERS ' ' 95 This Christian " source of inspiration" - the similarity of certain formu- lations still does not justify calling it a source - appears to be matched by the Hebrew ranks of heavenly forces as if directly transferred from one of the Hebrew lists of the celestial hierarchy. Indeed, Feodor's ranking con- sists, for the most part, of names well represented on these lists. However, it does not follow the same order as any of them, and it features only nine ranks instead of the usual ten; moreover, it contains certain Akhasim and Mulim which are not known in the Hebrew angelology. Surprisingly enough, these Akhasim and Mulim prove to be the qualities of ashmalim (Feodor's Asmalim) who are, according to the Talmudic etymology, animals of fire who move hastily, (ha)hash(im), and talk, memalel(im) (Feodor's Mulim).40 The reason for introducing these nonentities seems to be that Feodor, having forgotten some of the accepted names, wanted nevertheless to bring the number of the angelic ranks to nine, which is their number in the Christian tradition. Thus the transcription of their Hebrew names is but a stylization, inspired, no doubt, by names for cherubs and seraphim retained in Christian literature in their Hebrew form. The heterogeneity of Feodor's text is quite revealing of the ambiguous religious consciousness of the author, torn between his old and new identi- ties. He gave up all hopes for the restoration of the ancient glory of the Jewish people by the future messiah, yet he continued to pray for restitution of the old "knowledge" to those "gone astray" and to believe in the sur- vival of the children of Abraham by God's grace and presence. Feodor's ambivalent attitude to his Jewish past may also explain the emergence of his pseudoepigraphic "Psalter." Commissioned by the metropolitan to translate the Psalter of David utilized by the Christians in liturgy and prayer, Feodor presented his patron with the prayers he prayed himself, still borrowed for the most part from the Jewish liturgy, yet with all the modifications discussed above. One may wonder why he did not make his work more explicitly Christian, yet this is not a question that textual analysis can answer. With the limited data available, it seems precarious to go any deeper into the evasive psychology of this "echte religiöse Pseudo- epigraphie."41 40 Babylonian Talmud, Hagiga fol. 13, p. a-b.

In one of the manuscripts, aptly defined in recent research as an "encyclopaedic" collection,43 the "Psalter" appears along with such heterogenous texts as the Khozhdenie of the abbot Daniel and the Zadonshchina, as well as numerous other historical and theological entries.44 The other manuscript is much more homogeneous. This collec- tion consists of liturgical texts, special prayers, remarks on church disci- pline, etc., and it was identified accordingly as Ephrosin's trebnik (a hand- book of church rites used by a priest) mentioned in a late fifteenth-century catalog of the monastery library.45 The fact, in itself exceptional, that Ephrosin included the same text in two different collections indicates not only his interest in the "Psalter," but also a certain divarication in his estimation of it. On the one hand, Ephrosin considered it a text worthy of reading and placed it in a chetii sbornik; on the other, he placed the "Psalter" in his trebnik as well, for possible use in prayer. The apocryphal character of Feodor's "Psalter" was, no doubt, clear to Ephrosin, yet his collections reveal a distinct taste for this kind of literature.46 The fact that there was another version of the Psalter of David bothered neither him nor other contemporary readers, as long as they liked the text itself. Ephrosin's Orthodoxy is beyond any doubt, and his attitude to Feodor's "Psalter" must be considered representative of its initial reception. Exactly as described by Gennadii, the "Psalter" originally spread in separate "booklets." Each of the two copies incorporated by Ephrosin in his collec- tions had lost the first folio before it reached his hands. Nevertheless, there seems to have been a complete text in the monastery library, for in the 42 See la.

The abundance of scribal errors, some of them evidently attempts to make sense of passages corrupted by a preceding copyist, may also testify to the initial popularity of Feodor's text. What requires an explanation, then, is not the use of the "Psalter" by the Novgorodians - which in itself does not make them heretics any more than it did the venerable fraternity of St. Cyril - but rather the inquisitional zeal it inspired in the Novgorod archbishop. And indeed, it proves to be not the only lapse in Gennadii's argumentation against the heretics. A recent study has shown that the "heretical" icon discovered by Gennadii, in one of the episodes in which St. Basil of Caesarea is depicted as cutting off a hand and a leg of Christ, in fact represented a rare but perfectly canonical interpreta- tion of the so-called eucharistical miracle.47 Some witchcraft practices which Gennadii also attributed to heretical intrigue,48 albeit interesting as vestiges to heathen beliefs, are equally irrelevant to the main subject of his accusation. Thus it is not surprising that the Council of 1490, though gath- ered at Gennadii's instigation, retained only a small portion of the latter's charges against the heretics. Neither the fathers of the council, nor Iosif of Volokolamsk, who subsequently recast the accusations against the "Judaiz- ers" in a scholarly and systematic manner,49 made any mention at all of Gennadii's main evidence for the "Judaism" of the heretics: their use of the "heretical Psalter." * * The religious ferment in Novgorod in the last quarter of the fifteenth cen- tury was bred by a combination of different factors. Frustrated expectation of the end of the world undermined the authority of the church tradition. The elimination of the relative autonomy of the Novgorod church, espe- cially the introduction of the cult of saints venerated in Moscow, provoked opposition among the local clergy.50 The appointment to the Novgorod see 47 N. Goleizovskii, "Dva epizoda iz deiatel'nosti novgorodskogo arkhiepiskopa Gennadiia," Vizantiiskii vremennik 41 (1980): esp. 125-30. 48 In a letter of 1488 to Bishop Nifont of Suzdal'; AED, pp. 312-13. 49 Cf. Luria, "L'hérésie," pp. 49-67, with its references to Luria's earlier studies of Iosif 's polemical writings. 50 One of the main accusations raised against the Novgorod heretics at the Council of 1490 was that they "reproach with abusive words, defame and do not venerate the great Rus' saints Petr, Aleksii and Leontii and Sergii, the wonder-workers, and other sainted reverend fathers"; AED, p. 384, cf. p. 385. However, before the conquest of Novgorod by Moscow, it was not at all obvious that Novgorodians should venerate Petr, Aleksii and Sergii, who were closely asso- ciated with Moscow, or Leontii, locally venerated in Rostov (which belonged to Moscow), as "great Rus' saints." (On the introduction of the cult of Sergii to Novgorod as a means to</page><page sequence="22">98 CONSTANTINE ZUCKERMAN of Gennadii Gonzov, a henchman of Moscow and an inveterate simoniac, aggravated the situation.51 Yet, whatever other factors were involved, the first heretics' encounter with the Jews and their subsequent interest in Juda- ism gave their confrontation with Orthodox dogma a peculiar coloring. According to the metropolitan Zosima, the Novgorod heretics not only attacked the official doctrine of the church, but also "praised among them the rejected Old Testament and praised the Jewish faith."52 We know, indeed, that the heretics obtained a complete Slavonic translation of several Old Testament books previously known in Rus' mostly in compilations.53 On the margins of one such compilation, a Moscow follower of the Novgo- rod heretics, Ivan Chernyi, left a series of notes in which he praised certain Old Testament prescriptions; similar notes discovered in two other Old Tes- tament collections belong either to Ivan Chernyi or to some like-minded reader.54 It was not for nothing, then, that of all the labels current in the his- tory of heresies, the one that stuck to the Novgorod heretics was that of zhi- dovskaia mudrstvuiushchii ('lODOcciocppovec). On the other hand, there is very little evidence that the Novgorod here- tics actually tried to imitate the Jewish way of life or adopted any Jewish religious practices. The desecration of icons and the biting of the Holy Cross, attributed to them in the verdict of 1490, cannot be considered such, despite the fact that for the fathers of the council everything "contradicting the divine law and the Christian faith" was ipso facto "according to the Jewish custom." The only accusation indicative of Jewish influence was that all heretics "venerated Saturday more (pache ) than the day of Christ's resurrection [Sunday]";55 we do not know what form this preferential ven- eration took. Nevertheless, none of the heretical clerics renounced his posi- tion in the church, and no heretic performed circumcision, not to speak of the more elaborate elements of the Jewish ritual. Indeed, one could hardly expect that a few encounters with the Jews in the early 1470s, restricted as they were to Denis and Aleksei, could provide them with enough knowledge of Judaism so as to impart a distinctly Jewish character to the appease Moscow on the eve of the final conquest, see A. Khoroshev, Tserkov' v sotsial'no- politicheskoi sisteme Nov gor odskoi féodal noi re spubliki [Moscow, 1980], pp. 178-80.) 51 A certain monk Zakhar went so far as to accuse Gennadii himself of heresy and to reject the entire church hierarchy for buying and selling church dignities; AED, p. 380. Cf. E. Golu- binskii, "Istoriia russkoi tserkvi," vol. 2, pt. 1, ChOlDR, 1900, p. 617. Curiously, this Zakhar, whose entire activity seems to exclude any Jewish influence, was condemned as "eresem nachalnik" by the same council of 1490, together with Denis's and Aleksei's group. 52 AED, p. 384. 53 AED, p. 320. 54 AED, pp. 280-99. 55 AED, p. 383.</page><page sequence="23">THE HERESY OF THE ' ' JUDAIZERS ' ' 99 entire movement in the quarter century to come. The interest in Judaism, whether in the Old Testament, in the Six Wings, or even in Feodor's "Psalter" translated from Hebrew, did not disappear, but the Novgorod heretics seem to have been more eager "to praise" it in their controversy with the official church than to implement it in practice.56 There is irony in the fact that Feodor's "Psalter," so meticulously adapted by the author to his new Christian beliefs, was used, along with Orthodox readers, by Christian dissenters who had a soft spot for Judaism. But whatever use was made of it subsequently, the "Psalter" is interesting first and foremost as a personal document which offers us a rare chance to look into the turbulent religious consciousness of its author. And in this respect, the phenomenon it reflects may not be as isolated as it appears. At about the same period, the Jewish-Ukrainian milieu from which Feodor came produced the well-known translations, or rather adaptations, from Hebrew that later penetrated Muscovite Russia. To what extent was this literary activity the work of the Jewish converts to Christianity, who were numerous at the time? And was it not these translations which were instru- mental, in turn, in attracting the Christians whose conversion to Judaism provoked the expulsion of the Jews from Lithuania in 1495? A further study of these texts will no doubt contribute to a better understanding of this inadvertent symbiosis of "Christianizers" and "Judaizers" that left a pecu- liar mark on Ukrainian, Belorussian, and Russian religious and intellectual history.
