The purpose of the research is to explore the nature and causes of religious segmentation and realignment. A model of religious schism is developed and illustrated with reference to many different religions. The model is then directly applied to Islamic history. In the context of this research, religion is defined as belief in an afterlife associated with a supreme being or beings who intercede in the activities of this life. There is no doubt that M.T.

Religions that vary on either one or both of these points tend to recede to the backwater of society.2 A model of religious schism is developed. Schism occurs because of innovations in dogma or practice. These innovations must appeal to demanders of the religious product. However, the innovations themselves may be driven by organizational conflicts within firms supplying religion. It is our hypothesis that schism rarely erupts in the absence of the con- fluence of both demand and supply factors. There is a large and growing body of economic research on the study of religion.3 The economic study of religion adopts definitions and makes assumptions in order to best or- ganize the data that we observe about the behavior of people. Like utility, we do not really know what people believe about the afterlife. The study of schism in particular has not been explicitly spotlighted in the literature. However it is implicitly treated. Two encompassing works by Tollison et al., examine the Roman Catholic Church prior to and following the Protestant Reformation.4 These works (and the many journal articles paving the way) make a case for the industrial organization of the church. Several ideas stand out. Most prominent is that the Roman Catholic Church was a monopoly in the supply of religion in Western Europe up to the Protestant Reformation. The monopoly rents extracted by the Roman church were its own undoing because these ultimately induced the entry of new firms that supplied religious services at a lower price. The breadth and depth of the research by Tollison, et al., is awe-inspiring and the em- pirical support for the many hypotheses that they propose is cogent. However, they fail to confront a couple of facts that we find compelling, and indeed, these lead us to adopt the more traditional view of the Protestant Reformation: it was not the amount of money that the Roman church extracted in rents that led to its collapse, but rather it was what the church was doing with the money. Our view follows that of Adam Smith, who argued that it was the diversion of funds from local charity and good works that led to the collapse of the Ref- ormation. Our interpretation of the Protestant schism follows Smith in arguing that it was the outcome of both demand and supply side factors. Protestant reformers satisfied religious 1 Religion starts with the earliest written record. Scholars believe that the cave paintings in the Perigord region of France (e.g., Lascaux) were religious in nature. Support for this proposition is found in the fact that there are no depictions of war or fighting between men. Of course, we do not know what these people felt about a supreme being or about the afterlife. 2Careful readers may dispute this argument with two counterexamples. Paganism presented what might be considered the extreme version of free will. Worshipers would sometimes curse and berate the gods in order to try to get them to intervene favorably. Paganism fell out of practice. There is more discussion of the decline of paganism later, but suffice to say that it offered too little structure between behavior in this life and happiness in the afterlife. The other counterargument is that Calvinist/Presbyterian beliefs include predestination and the absence of free will. This is not a compelling rejection of the hypothesis. AH religions that believe in an all-powerful supreme being face the challenge of reconciling his knowledge with free will. This is true of Judaism, Chris- tianity, and Islam. Most Christian groups simply assert that the all-knowing God knows but does not compel. The main object in the split between Calvinist belief and the Roman Church was to remove the role of a hierarchically organized church from the salvation process. No doubt, predestination was force majeure, and it created problems for Calvinists because they do not want a non-intervening god. A non-scientific poll of Presbyterians acquaintances finds none who assert that God does not intervene in human affairs. 3 See Iannaccone (1998), for a good survey of the literature up to that point. 4See Ekelund et al. (1996, 2002, 2006). £} Springer</page><page sequence="3">Public Choice (2010) 142: 441^60 443 demands of the "inferior ranks", who had become disenfranchised by the greed of the Ro- man clergy. At the same time, there was a supply-side disruption.5 This is the theme that we develop in the following sections. 2 Definition and classification Every religion mutates over time as religious practitioners face new challenges and expe- rience new perceptions of the world. Myriad issues subdivide groups of believers. Groups diverge and new groups are formed based on differences in both dogma and practice.6 The extent to which the new groups are reconcilable defines the split as schismatic or sectional. We focus on the two terms, schism and sect. We define schism as marked intolerance between groups. A schism exists when some or all of the following are true: • The groups assume exclusive salvation in the afterlife; i.e., one group assumes that the members of another group, or even those of all other groups, are damned. • The new group is not considered a part of the old religion; members of the factions cannot worship together. • There is antagonism and the potential for civil discord and violence between the groups. We think of schism as the same thing as a new religious movement. That is, we do not draw a distinction between schisms and new movements because there have been few, if any, religious movements that began de novo. Certainly, all of the successful religious movements that come to mind are fairly considered schismatic breaks with existing faiths: Christianity sprang out of Judaism, and Islam sprang out of Christianity and Judaism.7 Mormonism, which is a popular movement today, sprang out of Christianity. The Cathars, who gained a substantial measure of popularity in the south of France during the Middle Ages, were labeled a heretical branch of Christianity and persecuted to extinction. It is tempting to define schism simply as a break between two or more groups where each group claims exclusive salvation for its members and damnation for the others. For instance, during the Great Papal Schism (c. 1400), when three popes simultaneously claimed the Chair of Peter, each pope excommunicated the followers of the other two. In principle this meant that everyone in Europe was going to hell. However, religions differ in their dogmas concerning the afterlife, and schism may occur just as frequently within religious denominations that have mild compared to harsh views of the afterlife. For example, neither Jews nor Mormons believe in Hell. Mormons view themselves and are viewed by other Christians as schismatic. It is likely that many Christian groups believe that the Mormons will spend eternity in Hell. On the other hand, Mormons believe that other Christians will enjoy certain pleasures in the afterlife, but that these will 5 See Smith (1776: 755-756). In particular with regard to the supply-side disruption, he wrote: "In this situa- tion of things, the sovereigns of the different states of Europe endeavored to recover the influence which they had once had in the disposal of the great benefices of the church [. . .]." Note that supply-side disruption had occurred previously in the Great Papal Schism a century before, but that this was not sufficient to tumble the papacy. Religions are composed of theology and practice. For instance, Roman Catholic theology carefully defines the Eucharist. Canon law is also very specific about the practice of the celebration. The word dogma usually refers to theology and we use it in that sense. Doctrine is more ambiguous and might be considered to apply to theology or practice. 7 Some have objected to our categorization of Islam as a schismatic break with Christianity and Judaism. We will attempt to justify our treatment later. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="4">444 Public Choice (2010) 142: 441-460 not be as great as those enjoyed by the followers of the Church of Latter Day Saints. So, Mormons do not schismatically separate themselves from other Christians on the basis of eternal damnation, but on other dimensions. Moreover, salvation in the afterlife is only one part of religion. Another and possibly even more important element is participation in common religious ceremonies. Schismatic breaks isolate groups from common practice. Protestants are proscribed from communion in Roman Catholic churches and practicing Catholics are not welcomed at some Protestant observances.8 On this basis alone, we can classify Protestants and Catholics as schismat- ically divided. Since Jews do not believe in Hell, schism within Judaism largely involves acceptance in or exclusion from religious rites and ceremonies. Smaller breaks, which we will call sects, frequently arise within religious groups. In sec- tional breaks, the groups' members consider both sets of beliefs equally valid in terms of obtaining salvation and common observance of religious ceremonies is not actively discour- aged. While specific beliefs and practices may be points of contention, the sects are not irreconcilably different. They consider themselves part of the same communion of believers and similarly entitled to spiritual reward. For example, within the greater Anglican Church there is a division concerning the eleva- tion of practicing homosexuals to the rank of bishop. At this stage, the division is a sectional dispute. That is, members of the church who themselves are not homosexual can have differ- ent beliefs about this practice and its place in the hierarchy of the church but still believe in the potential salvation of people who hold the opposite opinion. Differing views on abortion similarly constitute sectional divisions. Generally, the different Protestant churches are considered sects of the same faith. They have different ceremonial practices, but believers migrate from one sect to the next with- out being asked to reject the teachings of the religious group that they are leaving. On the other hand, to move from a Protestant Christian faith to a Roman Catholic or Eastern Ortho- dox one requires "conversion," that is, profession of the unique truth of the new dogma in contradistinction to the old. Similar distinctions exist in the Islamic religion. We attempt to draw a bright line between schism and sect in order to investigate reli- gious reorganization. However, it is clear that schismatic divisions can become sectional and vice versa. In England during the time of Oliver Cromwell (c. 1650), Presbyterians and Anglicans were schismatic. Over the centuries since, they have become sectional. In Turkey today, the Islamic split between Sunnis and Shiites is more sectional than schismatic. On the other hand, the intermittent squabbles between the Roman Church and the Patriarchal See of Constantinople began as a sectional division and hardened into a schismatic break (c. 1054) even though both sides have always professed interest in reunification. It is also true that the division between two groups can be asymmetrically schismatic/sectional (see note 8 above). Members of the greater Anglican communion today generally treat the break with the Roman church as a sectional division whereas Roman Catholics generally view it as schismatic. Note that the academic community does not define "schism" and "sect" consistently. This is especially true of splits in the Islamic faith. Some scholars refer to splinter groups as 8 As we note later, the break between Catholics and Protestants is somewhat asymmetric. Roman Catholic doctrine undeniably treats the break as schismatic. Canon 844 proscribes Protestant Christians from par- ticipating in the celebration of the Eucharist. However, members of the Orthodox churches and the Polish National Catholic Churches are said to "share a more intimate bond" and may receive the Eucharist. (See Catechism of the Catholic Church, number 1400.) On the other hand, while the most fundamental Protes- tant groups preach that "papists" will burn in hell, other sects, such as the Episcopalians, think a list of the differences as merely sectional. £} Springer</page><page sequence="5">Public Choice (20 10) 142: 44 1-460 445 schisms based on the fact that they consider themselves to be the only true believers, despite the lack of violence or other such symptoms of schism. The Ismailis, for instance, splintered into insignificant groups whose only schismatic aspect was their refusal to acknowledge the other groups as correct. This is a far cry from the Great Papal Schism, but they are still considered schismatic by some authors.9 On the other hand, another author (Orwin 2004) refers to the intolerant and violent Wahabbi group as a sect, despite their assumption of exclusive salvation. In summary, a religious group is schismatically separated from other groups if the dif- ferences in beliefs and practices have profound implications for the common observance of religion in this life and for expectations of bliss in the afterlife. These beliefs may excuse discriminatory and antagonistic behavior toward other groups. This means that violence and secular segregation can be symptoms of schismatic breaks, though many schismatic groups are able to live peaceably with each other. We explore the cause-and-effect nature of the antisocial behavior of schismatic separation in the next section. 3 Causes of schism The nature of religious schism can be broken into two major categories. One is product in- novation (along the lines of dogma or practice) and the other is organizational disruption (which usually occurs when an incumbent supplier is unseated). It is our contention that all schismatic breaks involve product innovation. However, not all innovation will generate schism. Thus, schism is most likely when product innovation is associated with organiza- tional disruption. In the standard terminology of economics, production innovation affects the demand side of the market, and organizational disruption is a supply-side effect. 3.1 The demand for religion We model religion as an economic good. On the demand side, individuals choose a religious product on the same basis that they choose a car or a country club. Even so, religion is a more complicated product than these. In our model, religion has three elements: (1) private contemplation, which includes hope for the afterlife; (2) public camaraderie, which includes common celebration and joint consumption of public goods, especially charitable works; and (3) reputation, respect, and social networking.10 Religion is an economic product and like all others it is supplied by organizations that are generically labeled firms. In any industry, whenever someone comes up with an idea that will make a product more appealing to consumers, a competitive force is generated to adapt production to the new idea. This competitive pressure may result in the birth of a new firm. The new firm supplies its product to consumers, some of whom become loyal customers. This pattern can happen in the religious marketplace just as it does in the industrial. Stark (1996) argues that innovation explains the remarkable growth of Christianity in its early days. Stark makes the case that Christianity was a superior product when compared 9 See Daftary (2000). In the course of his study, the author also discusses the major schisms that occurred among the Ismailis and subsequent developments among the Musta'li-Tayyibi and Bohra communities of Ismailis. Economists use the term public good to mean a product that can be consumed simultaneously by many people. Charity is a good example. All people who feel sorry for the homeless are happy when shelters are built to protect them from the elements, and even happier if they do not have to help finance them personally! £} Springer</page><page sequence="6">446 Public Choice (2010) 142: 441^60 to Judaism and paganism in terms of the three elements that we use to characterize a reli- gious good. Christianity presented a clear picture of salvation in the afterlife for those who believed in Christ. This hope for eternity was quite different from anything in the pagan cults and was more well-defined than the afterlife of Judaism. Christianity also promoted a strong sense of community in which believers cared for one another in times of need. Stark argues that faith-based mutual assistance was especially effective during two great plagues that swept the Roman world in the first three centuries. Finally, Christianity offered a mech- anism for building reputation and gaining respect in the community. The Christian faith made the behavior of practitioners predictable. While this behavior was initially held up to ridicule among non-Christians in the community, it was a badge of courage for believers, and eventually the behavioral model became dominant in the whole community. For exam- ple, martyrdom was accepted willingly during periods of Christian persecution because it represented the behavior expected of a Christian. Indeed, on his journey to Rome for execu- tion Ignatius of Antioch wrote ahead to Christians in Rome begging them not to intercede on his behalf for a pardon. The birth of Islam has many of the same features. We will develop these shortly. In religion, product innovations are changes that redefine the product either in terms of theology or practice. To the extent that religion is built on a commonly accepted set of beliefs, innovative changes defining a new product may be so large that they repudiate the brand name of the old and thus are definitionally schismatic. The Mormons and the Moonies are two modern examples of breaks that are primarily theological. The Protestant schism led by Luther was mostly based on practice, i.e., an attack on the penitential and ecclesiastical structure of the Roman church. The Mormons are Christians, but they are schismatically separated from the rest of Chris- tendom. Mormon doctrine is indisputably rooted in Christian doctrine. Mormons believe in Jesus Christ as God. However, they think that the true Christian church died out early in the 2nd Century when religious leaders abandoned the teachings of the New Testament. Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, restored the church in the 19th century. He discovered various scriptural relics, which he published as an entirely new biblical testament: the Book of Mormon. This major doctrinal change was not acceptable to other Christians who per- secuted the Mormons into exile. The Mormons responded by schismatically breaking with other Christians on the basis of practice. Christianity, itself, was a schismatic break with Judaism. The dogmatic proposition that Jesus was god and the tripartite representation of the deity was not compatible with that faith.11 It is clear that Christians were never willing to accept doubt about the divinity of Jesus. This is true even though Jesus was seen by Christians as the fulfillment of Judaism and even though the early Christian church recruited most of it members from Judaism. Evidence for the schismatic separation is seen in the rejection of the Gnostic and Arian beliefs by the early Christian church. These beliefs are closer to the Jewish view of the fulfillment of the prophesies than is the orthodox view that Jesus was God. On the other hand, it appears that Jewish leaders treated the incipient Christian move- ment in the decades just before the Jewish revolt against Rome (66-74 CE) as a cult, but 1 lrThe adoption of the trinity in early Christendom is obscure. Clearly, a double deity was required by the elevation of Jesus from prophet to god. The introduction of a third party probably was an appeal to pagan tripartite traditions. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="7">Public Choice (2010) 142: 441-460 447 not necessarily schismatic. At some point following the revolt, Christians were labeled as heretical and a prayer against them was included in the Jewish rituals.12 3.2 The supply of religion Dogmatic changes that would not necessarily be definitionally schismatic may alter the ways in which religious goods are produced and delivered to the people. For example, product innovation may involve who can preside over church services, and whether ministers can marry. As a consequence, innovation creates organizational discord and marketplace rival- ries, and these tensions lead to schism. In the production of religion, it may be optimal for the new firm to adopt a schismatic stance in order to protect its newly gained market share, but it is more commonly the case that the religion most closely related to the product line of the new firm will take a schis- matic stance in an attempt to thwart the new entrant. For instance, Muhammad originally hoped to subsume Judaism into his new religion and he achieved some success in this re- gard. However, as Jewish leaders recognized the loss of market share, they declared Islam heretical.13 Schismatic breaks may come because the organization of the supply of religion is dis- rupted by internal conflict. For instance, at least some of the tension that led to the Protestant Reformation came from reorganization of the Roman church from strict ecclesiastical terri- torial assignments to monks selling religious goods without regard to territorial boundaries. This redirected the proceeds of the sale of religious goods from the local producer to the papal curia. There was also a growth in the monastic movement that paid homage directly to the papacy. A hallmark of the Protestant Reformation was the confiscation of monastic property and expulsion of monks by secular leaders. Examples include England, Germany, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.14 Other organizational conflicts come into play as well. The Great Papal Schism followed a century of papal redirection of property away from the local churches and to the papal curia. One striking example was the practice of papal spoils. Starting in the late 13th century and throughout the 14th century the pope laid increasingly heavy claims on the property of deceased bishops. Papal envoys would descend on the diocese at first word of the death of the bishop and seize almost everything of value, including vestments. These were often auctioned back to the community, but if sufficient revenue was not raised, the property was transported to a better market area. The practice of spoils was specifically outlawed at the council of Constance (1414-1418) as part of the resolution of the schism (Williman 1988). Finally, as we discussed in the introduction, Tollison, et al., argue that the Protestant Reformation came as a result of product innovation that made religion cheaper to produce. The Protestant reformers wanted to "cut out the middle man" and let believers in Christ reach out to him directly. This product innovation was arguably appealing to consumers, The extent to which the Christian dogma of the deity was viewed as a schismatic break by the Jewish leaders is unclear. The animosity against early Christians by Jewish leaders seems to have been mostly political, involving the failure of the Christians to participate in the Jewish uprisings against the Romans. 13 Christians in the United States greeted Mormons in the same way, though Mormons were not able to exercise the dominance that Islam enjoyed in its similar situation. 14Forty years following the Ninety-five Theses, the monastery where Luther wrote the document was in private hands. Furthermore, while monasteries survived in Spain, which remained Roman Catholic, they were reformed and some property was confiscated by the king. £j Springer</page><page sequence="8">448 Public Choice (2010) 142: 441-460 especially in the wake of the invention of the printing press, but it also represented a supply- side disruption because payments that had been made to the producers of religious goods were attenuated. Luther, who was followed by the other Protestant innovators, did not attack theology as much as the practices of religious activities promulgated by the Roman church. Luther argued for a universal priesthood in which the laity had the right to administer the sacraments and control the production of religious goods. He also argued against the penitentiary system of the Roman church. Obviously, both of these proposals significantly diverted revenues away from the papacy and reduced the cost of providing religion. Dogmatic innovations that are appealing to one subset of believers may be unappealing to others. The suppliers of religion to the group to whom the innovation appeals must make a decision either to suppress the innovation or risk an organizational break with the rest of the supply chain. An example is the schism between the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches. At least part of the cause of the Eastern schism flowed from a dogmatic innovation that was ultimately approved by Rome and rejected by the Eastern Patriarchal See of Con- stantinople. It is called the filioque and involves the relation among the members of the Holy Trinity. Much of western Christendom was steeped in what came to be called the Arian heresy. This heresy, which grew out of Gnostic beliefs, held that Jesus was God but a step below the Father. For some reason, barbarian invaders first exposed to Christianity were at- tracted to this dogma. These invaders, largely Gothic, took over much of the western Roman Empire. While the Roman church was able to suppress the Arian heresy in the large, it made a dogmatic concession that appealed to this large subset of its congregation.15 It began to allow the profession of the filioque to be included in religious ceremonies. The filioque sug- gests a rank-ordering of the Holy Trinity. This was an affront to believers in the East. In spite of this, the pope finally agreed to include the filioque in the Nicene creed, at which point the eastern pontiff excommunicated the pope and his followers in the West.16 No doubt, there were other forces that contributed to the Eastern Schism, but dogmatic differences were part of the organizational split. 3.3 The church and state Finally, it must be recognized that religion is often the foundation of the fabric of society. The history of the Roman Catholic Church shows one such example of the interplay between church and state. It is commonly asserted that Christianity was the net that held western civilization to- gether during the early Middle Ages. Scholars have long argued that the alliance between the Roman Church and the disjoint secular structure of Western Europe in the period from the fall of Rome until the mid 1 lth century was one of mutual convenience, support, and 15 There was still an Arian bishopric in Rome in the 6th century. 16This developed over centuries. The formal adoption of the filioque came in 1054. However, Charlemagne was annoyed by the pope's refusal to adopt it in his time (c. 800). A complete discussion of the Eastern Schism can be found in Terkun (2003). £} Springer</page><page sequence="9">Public Choice (2010) 142: 441-460 449 profit.17 More recent work draws the parallel between this alliance and the modern fran- chise contract (Terkun 2003). Both the papacy and western rulers actively sought to promote a partnership arrange- ment. What was the gain for secular leaders, and what was the gain for the Roman papacy? The standard answers are that secular rulers gained legitimacy while the papacy gained pro- tection. While colorful in their historical record, these answers do not give us a framework to best understand schism. The idea of legitimacy especially needs elaboration. We argue that the papacy offered western rulers a commonly accepted system of law, property rights, and social order. This structure was woven into the organizational structure of the church. The organization of the Christian church was largely ecclesiastical. Churches were part of bishoprics, and bishoprics were hierarchically organized. Churches oversaw the produc- tion of public goods, including roads, schools, and charitable works, adjudicated common disputes, and contributed the basic recordkeeping in the society, i.e., births, deaths, and mar- riages. At the start of the hegemony of the Roman church in the social order of Western Eu- rope, the pope franchised the right of assigning bishops to the secular rulers. Even though the papacy later reneged on this contract, decentralized decision-making was clearly a valu- able tool for secular rulers in claiming what is generically labeled legitimacy. The king or nobleman named the person who would act as the regional civil administrator. On the other side of the table, Rome received more than protection from the secular rulers of the west. It received royalties from the sale of the religious product. Bishops, newly appointed by kings or nobles, paid monetary homage to Rome. With the growth of the economy in Western Europe, this became a larger and larger flow and it created more and more contractual tension within the Roman church. The wealth held by the Roman church has long been recognized as a flash-point of the Protestant schism.18 The degree to which wealth reallocation was the fundamental cause of the Protestant break is worthy of inquiry, but we need not follow that trail just now. Rather let's reflect on the fact that even after Protestant groups broke with Rome, the partnership between secular and religious rulers remained. Kings and nobles who supported Protestant reformers typically certified only one Protestant group as the authorized provider of religion in their political jurisdiction. When various religious groups vied for control of the politi- cal process, civil war resulted, as was the case in England and Scotland. France somewhat anomalously adopted a tolerant attitude toward the Protestants in the 16th century, but then brutally snuffed them out in the 17th. Generally speaking, religious tolerance of the sort that is now common throughout Europe was first developed and promoted in the United States. Religious intolerance seems to arise in the context of a partnership between secular and religious authorities. Secular leaders employ religious authorities to provide society with a 17 An early example is found in the following quote: "Religion was the most persistent source of friction between the Roman Catholic Hispano-Romans and their Arian Visigoth overlords, whom they considered heretical. At times this tension invited open rebellion, and restive factions within the Visigothic aristocracy exploited it to weaken the monarchy. In 589 Recared, a Visigoth ruler, renounced his Arianism before the Council of Bishops at Toledo and accepted Catholicism, thus assuring an alliance between the Visigothic monarchy and the Hispano-Romans" (Solsten and Meditz 1988: Ch. 2, paragraph 10). 18This point has been developed in numerous ways. As noted above, the first economist to make it was Adam Smith, who argued in 1776 that the redirection of wealth to the papal curia away from charitable uses was the undoing of the Roman church. Barbara Tuchman echoed this theme, criticizing the Renaissance popes for losing track of their role in society. Also, the many books on Alexander VI, Rodrigo Borgia, the most scandalous of all popes, highlight the abuses of wealth in the papal curia during the Renaissance period. See Smith (1776), Tuchman (1978, 1985) and Cloulas (1993). 4ü Springer</page><page sequence="10">450 Public Choice (2010) 142: 441-460 legal infrastructure, such as recordkeeping and adjudication of contracts. When the owner- ship of property and the obligations of contractual commitment are linked to religion, schism may jeopardize these social arrangements. One schismatic group will not view another as holding a valid claim to property or worthy of contractual fulfillment. In situations where the church and state are partnered, religious schism has been viewed as a revolt against social order and it typically has been dealt with harshly. The point is that in state-controlled reli- gions, religious innovations that might otherwise have led to sectional splits tend to become schismatic.19 In summary, the causes of religious schism come from both the demand and supply sides of the religious marketplace. On the demand side, innovations create a product that is more appealing to customers. Occasionally, these innovations are definitionally schismatic on dogmatic grounds because they define a product that is so completely contrary to the existing product that the two cannot be reconciled, at least from the perspective of one side or the other. However, whether or not demand innovations are dogmatically schismatic, schism is always associated with some dogmatic innovation. From the supply side come several circumstances that lead to schism. New entrants into the religious market vending a product that has greater appeal at least to a subset of con- sumers may decide to brand their product with the seal of religious schism in order to seg- ment the market and solidify a claim to market share. Rival producers of the older, estab- lished product my react similarly. Alternatively, religious innovation on the supply side can involve a delivery system that breaks down the organization of the established firm. Schism is then like a forced divestiture of a multi-divisional firm. Finally, schism has special implications when the supplier of the religious product is a partnership of secular rulers and religious leaders. Schism in these cases takes on the specter of a violation of property rights, ownership of assets, and contractual obligations. In these cases, schism commonly receives harsh treatment from the incumbent leaders, both secular and religious. 4 Application of the model of religious schism to Islam 4. 1 The birth and growth of Islam The development of the Islamic religion follows a pattern very similar to that of Christianity. Islam was a religious innovation that offered a more appealing product to consumers than existed before. At the same time, Muhammad (c. 570-632) developed an organizational structure that efficiently produced religion. Islam harnessed a powerful segment of society and directed its efforts outward to spread the religion by force of arms.20 From the demand side, the innovation of Islam fits nicely into our three basic elements of a religious good. 19 The extent to which schism in this situation can rend the fabric of social order depends on many circum- stances, but a couple of examples are worthy of consideration. In the century after Constantine pronounced Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire, pagan property was increasingly expropriated and its ownership threatened by extortion. Following the break with Rome by the English Church, people who con- tinued to practice Roman Catholicism were forced to pay exorbitant taxes. Persecution of the Jews has been a common phenomenon in western society. Islamic rulers traditionally practiced similar albeit more efficacious policies of differentially taxing non-Muslims. 20 Islam spread rapidly following Muhammad's death.

The monotheistic god was superior to the pagan gods, who were the indifferent sources of various natural phenomena. Allah was a universal and unique god who represented a supreme moral authority. Islam inspired those who thought these principles were necessary. The word of Allah spread through his prophet Muhammad created an historical context for Arabs by spiritually linking them back in time to the prophet Abraham. The Islamic paradise was tailored to be pleasing to Arabs. For instance, the idea of a harsh hell contrasting to a glorious heaven was more appealing to Arabs than the view of the afterlife presented by Judaism. 4.1.2 Social consumption and enjoyment Allah represented communal identity. Muhammad's philosophy was used as a self-assertion of his own people, both ideologically and militarily (Crone 1987). The tribal lifestyle nicely complemented the charge to fight for Allah. Muhammad engaged the tribal groups who were aggressive people. The former Arab nomads were sanctioned by their god to do what they did best, that is, conquer (Donner 1981). Conquered peoples generally were expected to try to hold on to their own traditions, but within a few generations, most people adopted Islam (Hodgson 1970). Conversion by force did occur, technically contrary to Islamic principles, but it was a minor part of the expansion and not crucial to its success. Instead, Islamic rulers were religiously tolerant, but at the same time they encouraged conversion by differential taxation. Jews and Christians paid higher taxes than Muslims. The Muslim pastoralist military force was not so different from the people they con- quered (Hodgson 1970). The dominated peoples made up a supranational Islam. The reli- gion, at first just a ruling-class code, became a strong but vague spiritual drive. It was ex- panded by various peoples and developed into a thriving international Perso- Arabic civiliza- tion (called "Islamicate")· Their culture was distinctive on all levels and eventually spread to Hellenic and Sanskritic cultures. Fundamental religious institutions were found everywhere: in families and their living quarters, religious communities, and in the body of the governments (Lapidus 1973). Islamic teachings identify the proper behavior for every aspect of daily life. A large part of Islamic teaching deals with charitable actions toward others. For instance, the Zakat is a religious tax required of wealthy Muslim people that can only be given to the poor.21 Furthermore, Muhammad declared that every Muslim must give charity (sadaqah).22 into the Christian territories of Eastern Europe up to 1683 (Battle of Vienna). However, the Islamic conquest was political and not religious. That is, as Islam captured new countries/societies by military action, it did not force individuals to convert to Muslim beliefs. Muhammad and the other founders of Islam were satisfied if conquered people accepted the rule of Islamic leaders, for which they paid a surcharge in the form of higher taxes if they chose not to convert to Islam. 21 The definition of wealthy extends to people of average income today. 22 From the sayings of Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Bukari (810-870): The Prophet said: "Every Muslim has to give sadaqah." The people asked: "O Prophet of Allah, what about the one who has nothing?" He said: "He should work with his hands to give sadaqah." They asked: "If he cannot find [work]?" He replied: "He should help the needy who asks for help." They asked: "If he cannot do that?" He replied: "He should then do good deeds and shun evil, for this will be taken as sadaqah" (Sahih 51). £} Springer</page><page sequence="12">452 Public Choice (2010) 142: 441^60 4.1.3 Reputation/social networking The Islamic system of personally enforced religious law, Shari'a law, depended on each member of society behaving morally. Religious observance acts as a bond of personal moral- ity. Islam adopted a somewhat strict social order and made it more flexible. Any new convert could capitalize on his own talents regardless of prior social standing. This social mobility eventually led to the collapse of the old Irano-Semitic imperial tradition. The gentry of the old Persian Empire (Sâsânian Dynasty) lost their supremacy, even though they converted to Islam (Hodgson 1970). Islam was a product of merchants with a cosmopolitan outlook and extended the eco- nomic and political systems already established by the Meccans to control the trade routes between Syria and the Yemen Islam (Donner 1981). 4.1.4 Supply-side considerations From the supply side, Islam provided a unifying ideology and allowed for the integration of Arabian society using both new and old politics. Under Muhammad and Abu Bakr (first ruler after Muhammad), the Islamic state was one that could organize and dominate better than tribal states (Donner 1981). Pre-Islamic society was structured around tribal patterns and kinship ties; this traditional organization was altered and exploited in different ways by the founding fathers of Islam. Tribes were no longer autonomous and were absorbed into a larger whole through the infrastructure of religion. Islam was able to unify the nomadic and urban elements of Arab society. Arabian society was divided into three strata: the ruling elite, a small middle group of sycophantic tribes- men, and a large body of conquered tribes.23 Islam itself stressed social ideals of settlement; Muhammad and the secular leaders were townsmen from the Hajiz (Mecca/Medina). The elites had a bias in favor of settled and especially mercantile populations; nomads were treated as an inferior class because of their military aggression. In order to mollify the ten- sion between nomadic tribesmen and townspeople, Islam formulated a special tax system that favored the settled life. Religion unified the two groups and the tax system encouraged nomads to migrate to the cities. Also, the highest positions in both the civil and military hierarchy were reserved for settled people. In addition to differential taxes, the elites employed various methods of profit motivation to control the nomads. There was always the hope of booty and spoils from successful campaigns, but there was no guarantee. So, Muhammad gave stipends or direct salary (ata-) to warriors in the Muslim armies. Predictable pay was an enduring link between recruits and the ruling elite. This also suppressed rebellion because insurgents risked losing this pay. Political interests were aligned between the two groups (Donner 1981). Muhammad was able to speed the spread of Islam by levering the military recruitment process. The sooner soldiers joined, the more money they received. This preferential pay ('irfas) was sometimes given on the basis of merit; people with especially great skills (like cavalry) got extra pay even if they joined late. Stipends were also given to minor Persian and Armenian nobles who cooperated with the Muslims in what is modern-day Iraq; however, they had to convert to Islam before receiving the funds. Additionally, tribesmen were offered conquered frontier lands (nasib) which were only valuable if the tribesmen remained loyal. 23The ruling elite were composed of Quraysh from Mecca, Thaqlf from al-Ta'if, and the helpers or ansar from Medina.</page><page sequence="13">Public Choice (2010) 142: 441-460 453 The spread of Islam through military conquest and rewards to the conquerors followed a path similar to the expansion of the Roman Empire. It differed by using religion to bond the contracts that allocated the spoils. 4.2 Islam as schism It can reasonably be argued that Islam was a totally new religion and not a schismatic break from other creeds. However, classification is the prerogative of the authors and we think that it is enlightening to think of Islam as a schismatic break with Christianity, Judaism, and paganism. First, Muhammad actively recruited Jews into the early Islamic movement. This initiative encountered opposition from Jewish leaders. Hence, by our model, there was a real threat against an existing religion. The practitioners of the existing religion found the innovations of the new group to be sufficiently attractive in light of their existing beliefs to consider switching. Defections were large enough that leaders of the existing group fought back. Our model organizes these data. Second, Muhammad built Islam out of the Jewish and Christian traditions. Muhammad claimed to be a prophet in line from Jesus and tracing back through Jewish history to Abra- ham. While it may be that many Muslim converts were practitioners neither of Judaism nor Christianity, the fact that Muhammad innovated from these structures fits our theoretical model. Christianity innovated and then presented an attractive alternative religion to pagans. So did Islam. Third, whether or not one labels either Christianity or Islam as a schismatic break with another belief system, the point is that both developed along the lines that schismatic groups follow: product innovation and organizational efficiency. Thus, even if one does not choose to label these groups as schismatic separations, their history re-enforces our model of schism. 4.3 A sketch of the proximate causes of schism in Islam Schism in the Islamic faith follows the model that we have developed. Schism is the result of dogmatic differences and usually linked to organizational conflict. The original schism in Islam occurred early in its history. There are two main groups in Islam, Sunni and Shiite. Today, Sunnis make up more than 90% of Muslim societies. Even though there were some fluctuations in this market share, it would be safe to say that the Shiite have always been a minority among other Muslim groups. The term Shiite is a shortened form of Shi 'at Ali, which means the party of Ali, who was the first cousin and son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad. The Shi' a were a party who supported Ali's claims to the caliphate. Immediately after the death of Muhammad, the Muslim notables of Medina choose Muhammad's closest friend and father-in-law, Abu Bakr, as the first caliph. Just before his death, Muhammad's second-best friend Umar was assigned as the second caliph by Abu Bakr. Although there are some indications that Ali considered himself to be rightful heir, the first two caliphs were close friends of the Prophet and their truly righteous lives and actions did not allow anybody to question their caliphates. Before his death Umar recommended six names as prospective caliphs. Four of them voluntarily withdrew from the contest. Osman (another son-in-law of Muhammad) and Ali were the two remaining. Ali was somewhat tricked and lost caliphate to Osman, who came from a wealthy family. Some of his actions were considered against what Muhammad stood Ô Springer</page><page sequence="14">454 Public Choice (2010) 142: 441-^60 for. He assigned his close relatives to the important positions. This and his soft governing style created some disturbance among Muslims and as a result Osman was assassinated by a group of anarchists. Ali was elected as the fourth caliph. His caliphate was not free from disturbance either and he was assassinated as well. After his death his sons Hasan and Husain (the grandsons of Muhammad) did not take over the caliphate and Mu'awiya became caliph and founded the Umayyads dynasty. Even though the Shiites as proponents of AH emerged as a group during Osman's caliphate, they became a schismatic group during Umayyad rule (Yildiz 1992). Many Umayyad governors were believed by Muslims to be corrupt and fallen away from the path set by the Prophet. Those who believed that justice and good government would replace tyranny and corruption only when the rightful heirs of Muhammad took control came to be known as the Shiites. Shiite Muslims hold the same fundamental beliefs as other Muslims, with the principal addition that they also believe in an imamate. This is the distinctive institution of Shiite Islam. The doctrine of the imamate was not fully developed until the 10th century but it holds that Ali was the first Imam. There is a wide range of Shiite beliefs with regard to Ali. Some even consider him to be God. On the other hand, Sunnis respect him but do not accept anybody as god, even Muhammad. Sunni Muslims view the caliph as a temporal leader only and consider an imam to be a prayer leader, but for the Shiite the historic caliphs were merely de facto rulers, while the rightful and true leadership continued to be passed along through a sort of apostolic succession of Muhammad's descendants, the Imams. Imams are considered by Shiites to be protected from all sins and mistakes by Allah and should be obeyed absolutely. Sunnis do not believe that any human being can be free from mistakes; this is in fact the main controversial issue between Christians and Muslims. Muslims believe Jesus was a prophet who had revelations from God (Allah), but like the Prophet Muhammad, he was a human being and not god. The Sunni caliphs were warned (sometimes harshly) by ordinary citizens when they are deemed mistaken. However, Shiites consider their Imams free from mistakes. All of the Shiite schisms, including the one that initially divided the Shiites from the Sunnis, occurred when succession of leadership was ambiguous. Groups of believers support separate candidates as having the legitimate claim to the imamate or the caliphate. The group supporting the losing candidate forms an entirely new religious group rather than re-merging with the mainstream group. Hence, the proliferation of Shiite factions. We see the twelvers, the fivers and the seveners, among others. Each holds a different belief about the identity of the true Imam. Imam succession is a dogmatic issue for Shiites. In Islam, as in Christianity, secular activity plays a major part in reinforcing religious splits. Religious divisions that stem from differences in theology or practice can widen into schism because of social and political factors. For instance, from the beginning the Shiites rejected the secular authority of the Sunnis. Arguably it was valuable for this new religious group to solidify its dissenting doctrinal position as a way of rejecting the legitimacy of secular authorities. Perhaps differences between religious factions would have been recon- cilable, excepting this sort of propagation of the rift. Even though religious schism in Islam may create monetary or political gain, it does not appear that the promise of advancement was ever the impetus for the break in the first place. It appears that political change and doctrinal change evolve together. Small differences arise until two factions have irreconcilably drifted apart. It does not appear that Islamic groups fake piety in order to rise in power. Some leaders might, but the group as a whole is led by a religious motivation that has the personal consumption components discussed above. Aggravation over certain religious tenets and the desire to alter them leads to schism, which in turn may lead to social and governmental change. £} Springer</page><page sequence="15">Public Choice (2010) 142: 441-460 455 4.4 Schismatic v. sectional classification of Islamic groups Here we lay out the important Islamic groups and describe their differences from one an- other. Each is diagnosed as sectional or schismatic. The classifications are based on the factors described above involving the groups' reasons for disintegrating and their subse- quent interaction with one another. Often, these labels are insufficient. Breaks are sect-like on certain margins, but schismatic on others. Exclusivity of salvation seems to be the most useful in drawing the line, but we note ambiguity when it arises. First, we will look at the Sunni, who encompass the mainstream majority of modern Muslims. In the 7th century, branches or schools of Sunni jurisdictional law developed. They rigidly define their tenets in order to secure the loyalty of followers (Lapidus 1973). Four survive: the Maliki, the Hanifite, the Shafi'ite, and the Hanbali. The caliphate appointed judges from different circles to uphold Muslim Sharî'a law. Hence, each school had its own character and use in the governmental system. The Shafi'ite and Hanifite were in favor in Baghdad, while the Maliki were idealists who refused to participate in administration. The Hanbali are important to note because they represent the only school accepted by Wahhabi Muslims. Sunnis are also led by different schools of theology. Maturidiyyah and Ash'ariyyah de- fine orthodox theology for most Sunnis. These schools differ on the questions of free will and the knowledge of god by mankind.24 These schools define theology and practice for Sunnis. They are sects by any definition. While they have marginally different leaderships, morals, and laws, they are mutually re- specting as proponents of the same message.25 Additionally, they participate in the same government, albeit to varying degrees. Their obedience to the same officials is good evi- dence that their differences in dogma and practice exist only at the surface level. In large part, the different schools are not schismatic because adherence to different schools of the- ological thought crosses boundaries of adherence to different schools of jurisprudence or practice. Next, we look at the Shiites. They are the pious minority of Muslims and represent the voice of the downtrodden. Their important religious dates and stories emphasize suffering and martyrdom. Hence, their role is in distinct opposition to the mainstream. At times in history, the Shiite Imam had actual, temporal power, but usually this was not the case, and the Imam remained in the role of a political outsider. Nevertheless, he always retained spiritual and religious authority among Shi 'a. As noted above, the Imam is believed to possess divine guidance. Because of the general absence of political power but the important religious authority of the Imam, Shiite Islam is very much a voice of dissent and opposition, an advocate for the underclasses. 24 Ash'ariyyah theology represents a reaction against the extreme rationalism of the Mu'tazilah. It holds that human reason should fall under the authority of divine revelation. Human reason is incapable of discerning good and evil; the goodness or evil of a particular action depends upon God's declaring it to be so. Humanity can only acquire religious truths through revelation. A second aspect of Ash'ariyyah theology concerned the nature of the divine attributes. Contrary to the Mu'tazilites, who understood Qur'anic references to God's physical attributes metaphorically, Ash'ari theology argued for the veracity of these attributes while reject- ing all crudely anthropomorphic conceptions of God. Thirdly, contrary to Mu'tazilah theology, Ash'ariyyah taught that the Qur'an was eternal and, therefore, uncreated. Human actions, however, are entirely dependent upon God's providing the means and power to act. This teaching had the purpose of preserving the doctrine of divine omnipotence, but gradually led to the formation of a deterministic outlook (University of Cumbria, n.d.). 25 One example of their differences is the rule by which Zakat is distributed. In Hanifite, Zakat cannot be given to non-Muslims, whereas other schools allow this. 4y Springer</page><page sequence="16">456 Public Choice (2010) 142: 441-460 In 750, the Shiites staged their only successful rebellion against Sunni rule. A group led by heirs of Muhammad's uncle, al- 'Abbas, deposed the Umayyad dynasty and established the 'Abbasid dynasty. However, Shiite tenets were quickly abandoned by the new leaders and Shiites remained a schismatic group within the larger Muslim world, distinct from Mus- lim orthodoxy and mainstream culture. This affirms the idea that secular activity plays a major part in reinforcing religious splits. The Shiites were disenfranchised from governmental power. They split from the Sunnis because the leader they supported never rose to a position of authority. This resulted in the conclusion that those in power held their positions illegitimately, against the will of Allah. Anyone who followed the conventional caliph would be denied salvation. Hence, true believers need not follow the conventional laws. Indeed, they had the right to revolt against them, which they did. The fact that the political leaders who were vaulted into power by the religious fervor of the Shiites does not refute the theory. Shiite principles simply do not appeal widely enough to make them the dominant group in Arabian society. Nonetheless, their principles are felt so strongly among a minority of people that the group is schismatic. Because the Shiites put so much emphasis on a single person, the Imam, Shiism has splintered again and again. The formation of the new branches resembled Shiism's original break from Sunnism. New groups diverged based on their ideas about who is the true Imam and on the very nature of the imamate. When people say "Shiite," they are usually referring to the Imamyyah, or twelver Shiites, who comprise the overwhelming majority of modern Shiites. The twelfth Imam disappeared in 939. While the Sunni assume he died, the Imamyyah believe he disappeared miraculously or even that he is still alive and in hiding. This group never experienced any further schis- matic or sectional break. They are the Shiite faction that stayed the main course. The other Shiite groups broke off between the seventh and ninth centuries based on who they believed to be the true Imam. The groups are named after the last Imam of the main line whom they followed. The Zaydiyyah (Zaidi or fiver Shiites) were the first to break off from the rest of Shiism. They do not believe in the "hidden Imam" idea and reject Sufi tradition.26 They do not consider the Imam to be infallible and do not believe that he can perform miracles. There can be more than one Imam at the same time. Furthermore, he does not have to be the son of the last Imam; any descendent will do. While the fivers are nonviolent, they are schismatically separated from the twelvers. They follow a completely different line of leaders and have a completely different conception of the imamate that is not reconcilable with the rest of Shiite tradition. The Isma'iliyyah (Isma'ilis or sevener Shiites) arose in a dispute over who should lead the Shiite community after the death of the 6th Imam. The main body of Shiites followed Musa al Kazim, but the rest followed his brother Ismail. Ismail was involved with movements to overthrow the Abbasid caliphate, as well as the entire social order. The Ismailis aimed for complete reinterpretation of Islam. They launched a successful popular revolt and set up a communal republic in Mesopotamia in the 9th century. The Isma'iliyyah consider history as 26Sufism, or traditional mysticism, existed in some form even before the conception of Islam. More fun- damentalist Muslims consider its beliefs and practices innovative (bid' ah) and thus reject it in a schismatic sense. Over time, it became institutionalized within Islam as individual mystics (or sheikh, meaning teachers) attracted groups of followers. Sufism was regarded with suspicion because, in general, mysticism is prone to extremism. Most rulers tried to control rather than eliminate Sufism, which was rational due to its popular following. α Springer</page><page sequence="17">Public Choice (2010) 142: 441-460 457 being split into seven periods, each begun by a prophet and followed by six infallible Imams. Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad were the first six prophets. This is more definitively a schismatic movement because of the seveners' desire to alter the rest of Islamic society and reinterpret Islamic history. They desired to overthrow a government which began as Shiite, implying that they assumed the government no longer followed the righteous path. The Fatimids are the successor movement to the Isma'ilis. In the 10th century, they set up a caliphate in North Africa and ruled Egypt. They began by appealing to people having political, social, and religious grievances with the rulers, but ended up becoming the rulers themselves. They can be considered as an extension of the Isma'ilis. The Fatimids went a step further than the Isma'iliyyah, though, and went the same route as the 'Abbasid caliphate in that they altered their doctrine after coming to power. Nusayris are a branch of Isma'iliyyah so far progressed that many Muslims do not con- sider them Islamic. Their beliefs include many pre-Islamic and Christian elements. Most Nusayris live in Turkey and Syria. At times during the Ottoman Empire, they were perse- cuted and heavily taxed. The Alawis are obviously a schismatic group because other groups actively reject them. This is also a good example of a schism having economic repercussions. The mainstream groups use religious deviation as a tool to extract revenue. The Druze broke from the Isma'iliyyah in 1 lth century. They believe that God directly manifests himself in prophets and Imams. This is a complete religion unto itself, involving a combination of neo-Platonism, Sufi mysticism, and Iranian religious traditions. Again, this is an obvious schism. The first real dissidents or rebels were the Kharijites, who became active in the 7th cen- tury. They are distinct from the Sunnis and Shiites. Thus, they represent an obvious schism. They were popular among dissatisfied non- Arab converts. It was easy for them to find sup- port because of prevalent economic hardship and social displacement. They excommuni- cated everyone else in the world, including AH. They felt that the majority of Muslims had lost the true path, and declared a violent jihad against the excommunicated unbelievers. Their slogan "command the good and forbid the evil" was later reused by radical Muslim groups. By our model, the Wahhabi movement is a schism within Sunnism. It is an extremist group that evolved from a sect of Sunnism but separated itself schismatically from the re- mainder of Islam. They are unquestionably fundamentalists and interpret the Quran literally. For instance, when the Quran says that Muslims should not take non-Muslims as friends, most mainstream Sunnis do not interpret this literally to mean that they can have no non- Muslim friends. They take it to mean that if actions that would help a non-Muslim friend would also hurt a Muslim friend, those actions are forbidden. Wahhabis hold that true be- lievers can have no close non-Muslim acquaintances. Wahhabis assume that every idea added to Islam after the 10th century is false. Many common practices are regarded as regressions to pre-Islamic polytheism. The Wahhabis' strongest emphasis is on strict monotheism and the exclusiveness of Allah, so they reject saints, monuments for graves, charms, and magic. They also assume that any non- Wahhabi, even one from another Muslim sect, is not following the true path and deserves death. The difference between schism and sect in this case is clear; Wahhabis consider themselves to be the only true believers in the world. They do not even consider other Muslims truly Muslim and use that as a justification for unchecked murder. The group was founded by ibn Abd al-Wahhab (d. 1792). He compared himself to Muhammad because both were fighting to stamp out the same things. In 1802, they de- stroyed the tomb of the Shiite Imam Husayn. In 1803, they captured Mecca and frightened £} Springer</page><page sequence="18">458 Public Choice (2010) 142: 441^60 the Ottomans. Al-Wahhab converted the Saudi shiek, who then assumed it was his religious duty to conquer all surrounding territory. The al Saud family used Wahabbism in leading the fight against the domination of the Ottoman Turks on the Arabian peninsula. By 1813, Muhammad Ali had restored Ottoman control. After almost fading to obscurity, the group got new importance in 1901 under Saudi amir Abd al-Aziz al-Saud (the new Arabian leader who allied with Wahhabi militants called Ikhwan). This rebellion was helped by the western powers (it was World War I and Turkey was allied with Germany). Saud secured control of the Arabian peninsula by 1924. Then, the "Wahhabi raid" of violence and iconoclasticism occurred. Today it's the dominant Islamic tradition on the Arabian peninsula, but its influ- ence is reduced in the rest of the Middle East. Osama bin Laden is from Saudi Arabia and is Wahhabi. Notably, jahiliyya is used to vilify any "impure" society. In 1994, the Buraydah Uprising proved that Wahhabism was a real threat to Saudi rule. 4.5 Schism and the role of church &amp; state in Islam Islam began as a both a religion and a state constitution. Muhammad used religion to orga- nize disparate parts of Arabian society. However, in the main branch of Islam, the marriage of church and state was not strict. The caliph was a secular ruler and not a religious leader. Sunni beliefs allowed a separation of church and state that resembles modern religious tol- erance. Indeed, non-Muslims were not forced to give up their own religions when they fell under Muslim rule and this aided in the spread of Islam. Nonetheless, there was some perse- cution of schismatic Islamic groups especially when these were linked to political rebellion. 5 Summary &amp; conclusions At bottom, what can we say about religious schism? First, any analysis of religious schism is predicated on a model of religion. Our model is that religion is an economic good chosen by individual consumers. The quality of the religious product, just as for any economic good, has the most important impact on its acceptance in the market. Religion has three product components: individual inspiration; communal consumption; and reputational enhancement. The ebb and flow of any religion follow its acceptance by the individual consumers on these three points. Both Christianity and Islam gained market share at the expense of Judaism and paganism because they created a religious product that satisfied demanders on these three points. While Christianity and Islam have competed against one another at the margins of their geographic markets, neither has enjoyed significant encroachment on the other's.27 How- ever, within their own territories, religious schism has occurred. Schism in these settings has involved marginal change in the religious product that appeals to a subset of the popula- tion. Often schismatic change involves a more well-defined personal inspirational message. The Calvinist schism from the Roman Catholics and the Wahhabi schism from the Sunnis both fall into this category. Sometimes schismatic change involves communal consumption and production. The Great Papal Schism was a result of too much diversion of religious contributions from local to papal supply of religious products. Whatever the category, schismatic change comes when some new supplier gives con- sumers who are relatively unhappy with the old good a better product. However, changes in 27 Islam pushed into Western Europe through Spain and into France, but the tide turned at the gates of Vienna in 1683. On the other hand, the crusades were never able to unseat Islam in the western Mediterranean. £} Springer</page><page sequence="19">Public Choice (2010) 142: 441-460 459 the religious product need not be schismatic. There are many dogmatic differences among Sunni Muslims both in terms of theology and practice, but these are sectional differences. The thing that turns dogmatic differences into schismatic breaks is a combination of demand and supply. Dogmatic differences affect the demand side of the market for religion. From the supply side we have a mix of rivalrous behavior among competing firms and the interplay of church and state. Schism occurs when an element of competition or politics mixes with dogmatic difference. Two of the greatest social thinkers of all time debated the role of religion in society. David Hume and Adam Smith were great friends but held different opinions about religion. Smith was somewhat religious; Hume was an atheist. Hume thought that state religion was best because lethargy among the clergy would mute religious radicalism. Smith thought that a free market in religion was best because in religion as in every other good, competition lowers price by rewarding efficient production. We suggest that this study of religious schism adds a new insight to the Smith-Hume debate. Hume was wrong. State religion will not mute religious radicalism. Even if secular au- thorities attempt to monopolize the supply of religion, they cannot stop entrepreneurship in this industry; and when religious innovation confronts the state monopoly supplier, civil dis- order is created. Instead of reducing radicalism, state-supplied religion creates it. Dogmatic and practical changes that might be minor sectional rifts are blown into full scale schism with state religion. Secular authorities in order to maintain order are forced to suppress, often violently, the new beliefs. Smith was right and we can expand his argument. The free marketplace gives an outlet where innovation and entrepreneurship will have only productive effects. It is clear that re- ligion is a market where entrepreneurship and innovation have big impacts. People demand religion just like they demand cars, and just as in the automobile industry, consumers of reli- gion are attracted to new models that offer more appealing and useful features. Government cannot erase consumer demand. So, to the extent that the demand for religion can take the form of radicalism, the best way to deal with it politically is to allow competition among religious groups to dissipate potentially anti-social behavior.
