<plain_text><page sequence="1">EMILY SUN Facing Keats with Winnicott: On a New Therapeutics of Poetry IT IS REMARKABLE THAT, THROUGHOUT HIS BRIEF AND INCOMPARABLY IN tense writing career, Keats never ceased to insist upon the therapeutic function of poetry. From his buoyant declaration in the 1816 "Sleep and Poetry" that "the great end / Of poesy" is "that it should be a friend / To sooth the cares, and lift the thoughts of man" (245-47) to the anxious em phasis of the poet-narrator to Moneta in The Fall of Hyperion (1819) that "sure a poet is a sage; / A humanist, physician to all men" (189-90), Keats maintained this underlying therapeutic conception of art but found himself having to renew the terms of his claims.1 Such work of re-assessment sug gests the degree to which Keats's poetry may be read as a history of ongo ing self-critique, of self-reading, the most complex episodes of which I sug gest take place in the Odes of Spring 1819 and in The Fall of Hyperion. An examination of the transformation of his therapeutic conception of poetry may shed light on the vexed and much debated relationship between aes thetics and ethics in Keats's work. My present reading follows upon recent interventions by such critics as Forest Pyle and Robert Kaufman, who have sought to challenge the influ ential New Historicist judgment of Keats as guilty of repressing the socio political and economic conditions of poetic production, of escaping from the world of human suffering into an idealized world of art, and fostering such tendencies in complicitous readers. Paying close attention to the tex tual workings of the poems themselves, Pyle, from a combination of Marx ist and deconstructionist perspectives, and Kaufman, from a Marxist Adornian perspective, both locate the critical force of Keats's poetry pre cisely in the way his poems unsettle their own stated positions and claims.2 i.

Among the Spring Odes, "Nightingale" and "Grecian Urn" stage the speaker's encounters with a symbol or work of art in ways that serve instructively as allegories of reading; they invite readers to ask how, on a meta-poetic level, we are implicated by and in relation to Keats's poems themselves. It is within the contexts established by apostrophe that Keats raises his questions about art's function in relation to death and suffering. In "Nightingale" and "Grecian Urn," two possibilities assert themselves most distinctly as articulations of art's function. In "Nightingale," the speaker tries to locate art as the space of an "elsewhere" that transcends and offers escape from the "here" of sickness and mortality; in "Grecian Urn," the speaker associates the work of art with a transcendent realm of permanence that offers consolation to transient generations of viewer-interpreters. Both possibilities have been associated by critics as consistent with Keats's own avowed "humanism" or "humanitarianism"?his idea that "a poet is a sage; / A humanist, physician to all men"?but both possibilities, I con tend, are superseded within the poems themselves.3 In these odes, Keats goes beyond thematizing death as a general condition which art has the ca pacity to transcend towards registering the impact of death as a decisive event around which art formulates and reformulates itself, and around which the poetic subject shapes and reshapes itself. In so doing, Keats re sponds, I will argue, obliquely to the specific event of his brother Tom's death in December 1818. My approach to Keatsian apostrophe will be informed by the psychoana lytic perspective of D. W. Winnicott, the British Object Relations psycho ical Inquiry 27.2 (Winter 2001): 354-84. The most influential New Historicist readings of Keats remain Jerome McGann's "Keats and the Historical Method in Literary Criticism" in The Beauty of Inflections: Literary Investigations in Historical Method &amp; Theory (Oxford: Claren don, 1988) 9-65, and Marjorie Levinson's Keats's Life of Allegory: The Origins of a Style (New York: Basil Blackwell, 1988). 3. In his "Introduction to the Poetry of John Keats," Paul de Man defines Keats's "hu manitarian attitude" as an attentiveness to "the suffering of others" that is, however, "always 'of the world' and," problematically, "not his own": the "suffering referred to is so general that it designates a universal human predicament" Critical Writings, lg^^-igyS, ed. Lindsay Waters (Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P, 1989) 179-97 (189-90). Hermione de Almeida de fends such a humanistic stance vis-a-vis the universality of suffering when she writes of how "[i]n an age of warring and self-destructive ideologies when it is considered unfashionable to speak of serving humanity . . .

Winnicott links the infant's use of the transitional object with the very ori gins of creativity in human experience, and readers of both Keats and Winnicott have already noted the striking resonances between the poet and the psychoanalyst's conceptions of the creative process.4 It is my contention that, insofar as the transitional object can be construed as a personification dependent on yet separate from the external and actual mother, it has the potential to shed light on the complex operations of personification in Keats's lyric apostrophes. And it is my hope that the juxtaposition of poet and psychoanalyst will further illuminate the shared stakes and claims of their respective therapeutic projects. i The relevance of a psychoanalytic account of the origins of address to the rhetorical device of apostrophe has been underscored by Barbara Johnson, perhaps the foremost thinker of the figure's centrality in lyric poetry. In her pathbreaking 1986 essay, "Apostrophe, Animation, Abortion," Johnson defines apostrophe as "the direct address of an absent, dead, or inanimate being by a first-person speaker. . . . Apostrophe is . . . both direct and indi rect: based etymologically on the notion of turning aside, of digressing from straight speech, it manipulates the I/thou structure of direct address in an indirect, fictionalized way. The absent, dead, or inanimate entity ad dressed is thereby made present, animate, and anthropomorphic."5 At the end of her essay, Johnson suggests that "there may be a deeper link be tween motherhood and apostrophe than we have hitherto suspected." To elaborate her point, she turns to the psychoanalytic perspective of Jacques Lacan: The verbal development of the infant, according to Lacan, begins as a demand addressed to the mother, out of which the entire verbal universe is spun. Yet the mother is somehow a personification, not a person?a personification of presence or absence, of Otherness itself. "Demand in itself bears on something other than the satisfactions it calls for. It is demand of a presence or of an absence?which is what is manifested in the primordial relation to the mother, pregnant with the 4.

Insofar as [man's] needs are subjected to demand, they return to him alienated. This is not the effect of his real dependence . . . but rather the turning into signifying form as such, from the fact that it is from the locus of the Other that its message is emitted." If demand is the originary voc ative, which assures life even as it inaugurates alienation, then it is not surprising that questions of animation inhere in the rhetorical figure of apostrophe. (198) Johnson underlines here, with recourse to Lacan, that the act of address be gins in the infant's relationship to the mother, in its translation of need into signifying form.6 From this perspective, the history of lyric poetry "comes to look like the fantastically intricate history of endless elaborations and dis placements of the single cry, 'Mama!'" (199). As a psychoanalyst, Lacan was concerned pre-eminently with language and with the constitutive displacement of desire as it passes through lan guage as a system of differential relations. Winnicott, on the other hand, was a psychoanalyst pre-eminently concerned with the use of objects, who has sometimes been faulted for not paying sufficient attention to the alien ating effects of language. His emphasis was rather on those transitional ob jects and phenomena that precede and prepare for the accession to lan guage, objects and phenomena whose use arises only in the primordial relation to the mother in the gradual and delicate process of her being per ceived as a separate entity.7 To what extent, then, is it possible to conceive of apostrophe in terms of pre-verbal Winnicottian transitional objects and phenomena? In what ways does apostrophe resemble a teddy bear, a doll, or a smelly blanket? In the Winnicottian account of human development, the transitional ob ject emerges in early childhood as the infant's "original 'not-me' posses sion"; it helps the infant separate from the mother but can emerge only in the context of "good-enough" maternal care.8 While the teddy bear may stand for the breast, it varies from Melanie Klein's concept of the internal object in that it is not a mental concept; it is neither internal nor external but intermediate, neither a hallucination over which the infant exercises 6.

Because of space constraints and the specific focus of my inquiry, I cannot make in this essay more than a few punctual distinctions between Winnicott and Lacan.

Whether the object is created or found is a question destined to remain unanswered, for the object "would not have been created as such if it had not already been there" (PR 71). The baby exercises an attenuated creative power in relation to a found object and gains experience thereby of "a state between the illusion of the mother's total adaptation to needs and reality's total indifference to them."10 Although necessarily inaugurated in early childhood, the transitional ob ject, according to Winnicott, has not only developmental but also syn chronic structural significance, for the "intermediate area of experience [thus initiated] constitutes the greater part of the infant's experience, and throughout life is retained in the intense experiencing that belongs to the arts and to religion and to imaginative living, and to creative scientific work" (PR 14). The way the transitional object assumes an intermediate position between inner and external reality underlies also other of Winni cott's theoretical insights. I turn now to one such key insight, which like wise needs to be thought of in terms of the logic of intermediateness. In a 1967 paper entitled "The Mirror-role of the Mother and Family in Child Development," Winnicott responds to Lacan's 1949 essay on the mirror stage in the formation of the ego by positing the mother's face as the precursor of the mirror.11 In the hypothetical scenario Winnicott delin eates, ... at some point the baby takes a look round. Perhaps the baby at the breast does not look at the breast. Looking at the face is more likely to be a feature. What does the baby see there? What does the baby see when he or she looks at the mother's face? I am suggesting that, ordi narily, what the baby sees is himself or herself. In other words the mother is looking at the baby and what she looks like is related to what she sees there. (PR 112) The baby's sense of himself or herself as separate is inaugurated in the spec ular two-way looking between mother and child. This has paradigmatic importance for later human relationships, serving specifically as a model for 9.

"Psychotherapy is not making clever and apt interpretations," Winnicott writes at the end of the essay, "by and large it is a longer-term giving the patient back what the patient brings. It is a complex derivative of the face that reflects back what is there to be seen" (PR 117).12 Let us consider more closely the elements of this hypothetical moment. What is reflected back to the baby is not a static image of body wholeness like the image in Lacan's mirror. What is mirrored back in the potential space between mother and child is an interaction that might be described in terms of the transitional object as something that is both created and found, that is neither internal nor external but intermediate. What emerges in the specular situation is the mother's face/baby's sense of self as an illu sory and malleable third between baby proper and mother proper. The mother's face/baby's sense of self results from a transitional looking; it is both created and found. As a facilitating condition, the mother or?as Winnicott takes care to qualify13?mother-figure needs to provide her availability and responsiveness so that the "mother's face" may be created/ found. The pre-Oedipal mother-infant specularity Winnicott describes is not then a condition of dyadic symmetry, unity, and plenitude, but a po tential space in which something new has happened, in which creativity and interaction take place for the separating-out of the not-me from the me, on the way towards language. In a Keatsian idiom, this space may be called a "chamber of maiden play." Rhetorically, what is creatively generated as the mother's face can be termed a personification, a personification beyond the world of reference that is not the referential mother proper but that is contingent on her pro vision and participation. The mother's face as transitional object is a personification, a creative illusion necessary for the development of the self, that makes communication possible, and makes it possible for the baby to 12. In "Playing: Creative Activity and the Search for the Self," Winnicott observes in a footnote that "the sense of self comes on the basis of an unintegrated state which, however, by definition, is not observed and remembered by the individual, and which is lost unless ob served and mirrored back by someone who is trusted and who justifies the trust and meets the dependence" (PR 61). Such formulations implying a specular transferential structure oc cur passim throughout his writings. 13. Even Winnicott's most sympathetic readers have rightly objected to his tendency to re-affirm patriarchal gender roles and to endorse heterosexual familial ideology. See Claire Kahane, "Gender and Voice in Transitional Phenomena" in Transitional Objects and Potential Spaces 278-91 and Carolyn Dever, Death and the Mother from Dickens to Freud (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1998), Chapter 2. He does systematically make allowances, however, for the mother-figure being non-identical with the biological mother; that is to say, the role of the mother can be assumed by the other parent, another member of the family, or a consistent care-giver who is not a member of the family.</page><page sequence="7">FACING KEATS WITH WINNICOTT 63 experience the world. As transitional phenomena, both the teddy bear and the mother's face are illusions that are not identical to the referential mother proper but have to do, nonetheless, with the reality of the empirical mother. They are personifications that are not detached, intact, and auton omous but involve interaction with the environment, focalized in the re sponsiveness and consistency of the mother-figure. What happens when the mother is not available or responsive? In the case of the baby looking at the mother's face, "[t]he mother's face is not then a mirror. So perception takes the place of apperception, perception takes the place of that which might have been the beginning of a significant exchange with the world, a two-way process in which self-enrichment al ternates with the discovery of meaning in the world of seen things" (PR 113). What happens for the baby learning to use the transitional object? For the baby to use the object and then to move on to other objects, "there must be the beginning of the setting up in the infant's mind or personal psychic reality of an image of the object. But the mental representation in the inner world is kept significant ... by the reinforcement given through the availability of the external separated-off and actual mother" (PR 97). The backdrop of external reinforcement, of environmental continuity, al lows the baby to develop the ability to sustain an inner mental representa tion of the object?and thus the growing ability to deal with maternal ab sence.14 The process is a precarious and perilous one. Premature maternal failure results in trauma. "Trauma implies that the baby has experienced a break in life's continuity, so that primitive defences now become organized to defend against a repetition of 'unthinkable anxiety' or a return of the acute confusional state that belongs to disintegration of nascent ego struc ture" (PR 97). What arises, then, in place of creative illusion that makes communication possible and keeps inner and outer reality separate yet in terrelated are defense organizations, illusions that block or impede the pro cess of interrelating inner and outer reality?that block the self's commu nication with and experience of the world. As a price for the protection that defense organizations afford, betweenness disappears. 14- See Rene Roussillon, "Paradoxe et continuite chez Winnicott: Les defenses paradoxales" Bulletin de Psychologie xxxiv, no. 350 (April 1, 1980): 503-9.

["Internal/external continuity, which turns on paradox, depends itself on another continuity that is entirely external to it, that of maternal presence. . . .

"Breakdown," he ac knowledges, is a rather "vague" term that encompasses a variety of phe nomena, but he uses it here to designate "the failure of a defence organization."15 Fear of breakdown, then, symptomatizes a defense that masks a radically "unthinkable state ... a breakdown of the establishment of the unit self. . . . The ego organises defences against breakdown of the ego-organisation, and it is the ego-organisation that is threatened" (PE 88). When a patient manifests a fear of breakdown, it is "the fear of a breakdown that has already been experienced'"; "the patient must go on looking for the past detail which is not yet experienced. This search takes the form of a look ing for this detail in the future" (PE 90). The patient continues in, as it were, compulsively repetitive behavior, to look for a missed, inaccessible aspect of experience. In the clinical setting, "[t]he patient needs to 'remem ber' . . . but it is not possible to remember something that has not yet hap pened, and this thing of the past has not happened yet because the patient was not here for it to happen to. The only way to 'remember' ... is for the patient to experience this past thing for the first time in the present, that is to say, in the transference" (PE 92). Winnicott is recognizably formulating here ideas on trauma that build on Freud's theory of traumatic neurosis as elaborated in, among other texts, Beyond the Pleasure Principle. His remarks deal specifically with an early in fantile origin, hypothesize a primal scene of trauma that occurred when the ego was not yet organized, when the continuity necessary for the establish ment of the "unit self" was interrupted such that the developing ego orga nizes itself defensively around the traumatic event.16 He turns in the essay to discussing "fear of death"?"perhaps a more common fear"?in terms of his general thesis of fear of breakdown. In the case of a patient with "a compulsion to look for death ... it is the death that happened but was not experienced that is sought" (PE 93). For an ex ample Winnicott turns to Keats rather than to one of his clinical cases: "When Keats was 'half in love with easeful death' he was, according to my idea that I am putting forward here, longing for the ease that would come 15- Psychoanalytic Explorations, ed.

The quote embedded here occurs in stanza 6 of "Nightingale": Darkling I listen; and, for many a time I have been half in love with easeful Death, Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme, To take into the air my quiet breath; Now more than ever seems it rich to die. To cease upon the midnight with no pain . . . (51-56) These haunting, melodious verses have long tantalized interpreters, and the wish for death they contain constitutes one of several dramatic turns in the poem. The first three lines point to the speaker's pattern of recurrent fasci nation with death, a fascination expressed specifically in the medium of poetry?"[c]all'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme," while line 55 instantiates the wish for death in the present tense?"Now more than ever seems it rich to die." Curiously, the words Keats chooses as temporal mark ers here?"For many a time," "in many a mused rhyme"?suggest repeti tive seriality and discreteness rather than the continuous duration of one who has, say, for a long time been "half in love with easeful Death." Why does Keats place this accent on discreteness? Drawing on Winnicott, we may speculate that "for many a time" the unit of the individual poem served Keats as the site of a compulsion?a compulsion to look for death, no less. We may also infer, drawing on Winnicott, that the poem serves somewhat like the scene of a transference. It is possible thus to think of the Odes not just as a generically and formally determined series with general thematic continuity, but as sites of a com pulsion to repeat where Keats is searching, on an autobiographical level, for a missed detail. 2 Keats composed the Odes of Spring in quick succession during a few weeks towards the end of April and the beginning of May 1819. Each of the Odes features what Jack Stillinger calls the general "cosmography" of Keats's poems: "a literally spatial conception of two realms in opposition and a mythlike set of actions involving characters shuttling back and forth between them."17 A catalogue of terms that characterizes this opposition between realms includes: "earth and heaven, mortality and immortality, 17- "Introduction" in fohn Keats: Complete Poems xiii-xxviii.

Broadly put, these describe the opposition between "the realm of mortals . . . associated with mutability, natural process, and death" and a transcendent realm "associated most significantly with perma nence" (xvii). Speakers and characters within both Keats's lyric and narra tive poems tend to engage in a shuttle movement of excursion between worlds, a passage that each individual composition renews.18 In the Spring Odes, this movement between worlds is mediated specifically by the rhe torical device of apostrophe. In "Nightingale" and "Grecian Urn," the ad dressed entity figures in each case as the synecdoche of a realm alternative to the one where the speaker finds himself at the outset of the poem: the Nightingale represents a mythical forest world associated with the tradition of romance; and the Urn is supposed to be a relic from ancient Greece. By addressing Nightingale and Urn, the speaker establishes a contrast with the world "where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies," and "where old age shall this generation waste." Strikingly, the speakers' shuttle movement within the Odes parallels and repeats closely the terms of Keats's own shuttling back and forth between his writing and his brother Tom's sickbed over half a year ago. Tom Keats died in December 1818 after a protracted struggle with tuberculosis, the disease which Keats himself was also to die of in 1821, putatively after hav ing contracted it from his brother. During Tom's last months, Keats, who was trained as an apothecary, attended to his brother, moving back to his writing for relief from the sight of his brother's suffering. On September 21, 1818, he writes to his friend Dilke: "[Tom's] identity presses upon me so all day that I am obliged to go out?and although I intended to have given some time to study alone I am obliged to write, and plunge into ab stract images to ease myself of his countenance his voice and feebleness?so that I live now in a continual fever . . . if I think of fame of poetry it seems a crime to me, and yet I must do so or suffer."19 Tom's countenance . . . voice and feebleness" reproduce themselves infectiously in Keats's "contin 18. To mention cursorily a few earlier examples, the poet-speaker in "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer" writes of a reading experience that initiates and exposes him to an epic universe, an open, uncharted territory likened progressively in the sestet to the skies, the Pacific, the New World. In the sonnets on seeing the Elgin Marbles, the speaker likewise sit uates his speaking relation to a classical world glimpsed through his encounter with the sculptures. In Endymion, the eponymous hero yearns to be united with his mysterious lover Cynthia, who belongs as a goddess to an ontologically higher sphere. And we come across Apollo in Hyperion addressing Mnemosyne in an encounter that will make him immortal. 19. The Letters of John Keats, ed. Hyder E. Rollins, 2 vols.

The next day, a propos the first Hyperion, abandoned shortly be fore the composition of the Spring Odes, he remarks to his friend Reynolds: "this morning Poetry has conquered?I have relapsed into those abstractions which are my only life?I feel escaped from a new strange and threatening sorrow.?And I am thankful for it?There is an awful warmth about my heart like a load of Immortality" (i: 370). Poetry is here assigned the role of abstract, disinterested refuge from a world of death and sorrow. This is the role Keats would like to attribute to the Grecian Urn as repre sentative work of art, claiming in stanza 5 that "[w]hen old age shall this generation waste, / Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe / Than ours, a friend to man" (46-48). What the parallels between the letters and the poems suggest is that, en coded within the Odes are Keats's attempts to reckon with a "missed de tail" in regard to his brother's death. Both the "Nightingale" and "Grecian Urn" Odes continue the shuttle pattern of the speaker's escape into "ab stractions which are my only life," but they deliberate this repetition in ways that reveal the inadequacy of this understanding of poetry and open up a new poetic path. I turn now to how, in both "Nightingale" and "Grecian Urn," Keats's po etic speakers raise questions about the function of art in relation to suffering and mortality via apostrophes to the Nightingale and the Urn. "Nightin gale" positions the work of art in relation to death by establishing art's space as an "elsewhere" that provides escape for "hungry generations" from the "here" of suffering and death. Yet, the "here" and "elsewhere" thus established undergo several destabilizing instantiations within the poem, revealing the precariousness of the apostrophaic operation. The speaker of "Grecian Urn" valorizes the silence of the Urn to associate the work of art with a condition of permanence that makes art a stable and consolatory reference point for changing generations. In opposition to this first connotation of silence within the Ode, there occurs in stanza 4 an al ternative "falling silent" that threatens to undo the first connotation. In both poems, death emerges as an event that interrupts its figuration as a condition for which art can provide escape or consolation. Such latter figurations I term, with a twist on the traditional generic cat egory, Keats's "defenses of poetry." The tensions within Keats's poems can be understood in terms of the tension between the use of personification as a communication that keeps inner and outer reality separate yet interre lated, opening the self to the world, and the use of personification as a de fensive illusion that blocks the process of interrelation. It is through discov ering and undoing the limits and limitations of such defenses, I will argue, that Keats moves towards a new therapeutics of art, one that resonates</page><page sequence="12">68 EMILY SUN powerfully with Winnicott's definition of clinical success as to "enable the patient to abandon invulnerability and to become a sufferer. If we succeed life be comes precarious to one who was beginning to know a kind of stability and a freedom from pain, even if this meant non-participation in life" (PE 199; italics original). "Ode to a Nightingale" Instead of a direct invocation of the addressed entity?akin to "O Goddess! hear these tuneless numbers, wrung" or "Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness"?"Ode to a Nightingale" begins with an elliptical approach to the Nightingale. The speaker concentrates in the opening quatrain on the effects the unlocatable bird's song elicits in him: My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk, Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk: (1-4) While the Grecian Urn is represented as a concrete, visible presence, the Nightingale figures as an unseen, ephemeral entity. The imagery and rhythm here suggest a simulative descent into the underworld, with the deathly connotations of the passage further enhanced by the pun on "plot" in the eventual, oblique address to the Nightingale, made via a grammati cally indeterminate segue into the sestet: 'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot, But being too happy in thine happiness,? That, thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees, In some melodious plot Of beechen green, and shadows numberless, Singest of summer in full-throated ease. (5-10) The grammatical ellipsis that connects the figure of the speaker with the figure of the Nightingale renders the contours of their relationship obscure and enigmatic. The speaker displays throughout the ode a problem of "placing" as he tries to create, again and again, an opposition between a "here" and an "elsewhere." Stanza 3 emphasizes by counterpoint the difference between the world of the "here" and the "forest dim" into which the speaker would "fade away." The world of the "here" is one of sorrow, disease, and death:</page><page sequence="13">FACING KEATS WITH WINNICOTT 69 Here, where men sit and hear each other groan; Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs, Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies; Where but to think is to be full of sorrow And leaden-eyed despairs, Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes, Or new love pine at them beyond to-morrow. (24-30) To line 26 most editors append a footnote explaining Tom Keats's recent death.20 Keats rehearses in this stanza the idea of art as a refuge from a world of mortality and mutability. I say "art" here because of the Nightin gale's multiple and protean associations with literary tradition. The ad dressed entity belongs, of course, to a species of bird not uncommon in lit erature, significant antecedents of which include, to name a few, Ovid's Philomela, Milton's "wakeful bird" that "sings darkling" in Paradise Lost, Book 3, and the Nightingale of Coleridge's eponymous conversation poem of 1798. Keats's Nightingale is further associated with the forest world of romance, to which the speaker begs access first through libations meta phorical of poetic inspiration, then upon the "viewless wings of Poesy." The developments that follow, however, complicate this simple opposi tion between worlds set up by the structure of apostrophe. There has been much critical debate over what transpires in stanzas 4 through 7, between the line "Already with thee! tender is the night" in the middle of stanza 4 to the repetition of "forlorn" across stanzas 7 and 8. The sequence is rife with ambiguity. Does the speaker romantically embrace transcendent, vi sionary transport? If so, then the "here" of line 38?"But here there is no light"?would be the elsewhere of the "here" of line 24?"Here, where men sit and hear each other groan." The renewed apostrophe to the Nightingale as "immortal Bird!" in stanza 7 would then seem to praise and re-affirm the capacity of an enchanted realm of art to remain a consolatory "friend to man" when "old age shall this generation waste" as it has pre vious "hungry generations." Alternatively, does the speaker reject vision ariness? In which case stanza 7 would take on an accusatory tone, with the "immortal Bird" figured as indifferent to the mortal plight evoked in stanza 3. Advocates of the latter possibility tend to read the "here" of line 38 as continuous with the "here" of line 24. Stanzas 5 and 6 would then be read as descriptive of a sensorily available natural world, with the speaker's 20. See, for instance, Romantic Poetry and Prose, eds.

For such critics, the apostrophaic structure of the poem facilitates a return to the "poetry of earth," "to the significant earth whence all sign-constructions take their origin."21 Yet, a further development within the ode problematizes the parameters of this debate. The passage between stanzas 7 and 8 is mediated by the word "forlorn" that functions onomatopoetically like a bell to toll the speaker back to his "sole self." "Forlorn" is a parabasis that interrupts the apostrophe. What is peculiar to this textual moment, according to Paul de Man in a famous exchange with Murray Krieger, is that it "occurs as an ac tual present in the only material present of the ode, the actual moment of its inscription when Keats writes the word 'forlorn' and interrupts himself to reflect on its arbitrary sound. "22 This moment is the only here-and-now of writing in the poem, as it is the only here-and-now in the practice of reading that tries to meet it. "Forlorn" thus renders questionable the "here"s of lines 24 and 38 and their function as indicative tokens of actual ity. What follows the "here" of line 24 is a series of emblematic tableaux vivants?"men [who] sit and hear each other groan," "palsy [that] shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs," "youth [that] grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies"?that reveals deixis to be a masquerade. What follows the "here" of line 38, be it visionarily imagined or sensorily described, likewise fails to uphold its promise of actuality. Advocates of visionariness and advocates of the "poetry of earth" seem to have taken sides in a spuriously constructed opposition. The entire structure erected by apostrophe is thereby under mined. Or is it? The closing couplet asks: "Was it a vision, or a waking dream? / Fled is that music:?Do I wake or sleep?" These questions interrogate the very status of the apostrophe upon which the poem depends. But the shift within the couplet from the past tense to the present suggests that perhaps there is no resting point outside of apostrophe, that there is only passage from one apostrophe to another, and that it is in such passages that the readerly exposure to Keats's singularity and actuality takes place. 2i.

In triple apposition, the speaker stresses the theme of silence: Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness, Thou foster-child of silence and slow time, Sylvan historian, who canst thus express A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme: (1-4) The object's enigmatic inexpressiveness serves as the very point of depar ture for the poem, eliciting the speaker's act of address. In what follows, I will pay particular attention to this theme of silence and trace how a coun ter-movement within the poem puts it into question. The ensuing sestet develops the speaker's relationship to the Urn in the interrogative mode with a series of questions that ekphrastically reveal the images represented on the Urn's surface: What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape Of deities or mortals, or of both, In Tempe or the dales of Arcady? What men or gods are these? What maidens loth? What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape? What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy? (5-io) Syntactical fragmentation contributes to the mounting tempo of urgency and haste with which the speaker-interpreter tries to construct a coherent narrative out of the depicted images, themselves increasing in urgency and haste. What emerges seems to be a scene of pastoral ravishing, undertaken by men or gods, in contrast to the Urn's own chaste intactness, even if "still" in line i is read adverbially as an ominous "not yet." Already in stanza I a tension gets dramatized between the quality of pristine silence at tributed to the Urn as aesthetic object and the possible story it silently tells. Stanza 2 begins with the praise of inaudible sound as the ideal, the abso lute principle, of sound? Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard Are sweeter; therefore ye soft pipes, play on; Not to the sensual ear, but more endear'd, Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone: (11-14)</page><page sequence="16">72 EMILY SUN These lines allude to an eternal, transcendental essence of sound as silence that links with the later apostrophe to the Urn in stanza 5: "Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of Thought / As doth eternity" (44). Stanzas 2 and 3 present paratactic images of arrested movement, as the speaker addresses in dividual figures frozen in an eternal present. Silence is here associated with timelessness and immortality, with the condition of deathlessness. The im mutability of the figures on the Urn is further enhanced by counterpoint with the vulnerable mortal body anatomized at the end of stanza 3: ... a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd, A burning forehead, and a parching tongue. (29-30) The symptoms enumerated here recall the feverish condition of Tom Keats?"his countenance his voice and feebleness"?that Keats reports to his friend Dilke and that he himself feels infected with?"I live now in a continual fever." For relief Keats "plunge[s] into abstract images ... if I think of fame of poetry it seems a crime to me, and yet I must do so or suffer" (1: 369). Such a conception of poetry as abstract, disinterested refuge gets under cut in stanza 4, which resumes the interrogative mode of the first stanza as well as enlarges the tension already intimated earlier there. Puzzled over a scene, the speaker-interpreter asks: Who are these coming to the sacrifice? To what green altar, O mysterious priest, Leads't thou that heifer lowing at the skies, And all her silken flanks with garlands drest? (31-34) Scanning the surface of the Urn, he answers his first question by raising another: What little town by river or sea shore, Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel, Is emptied of this fold, this pious morn? (35-37) The repeated deictic "this" emphasizes the specificity of what the speaker infers he sees, in contrast to the universality of much of the poem's ekphrastic language. Finally, ceasing to describe the surface of the Urn, he reflects:</page><page sequence="17">FACING KEATS WITH WINNICOTT 73 And, little town, thy streets for evermore Will silent be; and not a soul to tell Why thou art desolate, can e'er return. (38-40) The theme of silence here seems to undergo a significantly different inflection. Silence here is not the condition or attribute of the beautiful ob ject of contemplation but, rather, the aftermath of an event hinted at by the heifer's sacrifice. Whereas silence in the former case is associated with eter nity and immortality, silence in the latter is linked to the event of mortality. The Urn, prized for its aesthetic attributes of permanence and deathless ness, gives oblique testimony here to an event for which there are no more witnesses. From object of disinterested contemplation, a witness to the realm of eternity that affords consolation to mortals, the Urn becomes a historian, though of a very different kind than the "sylvan historian" of line 3, for it is not impartial but part of history, its very participation in history activated in the interpretive relationship established with the speaker. In his powerful reading of the ode, Kenneth Burke reminds us that "[t]he Urn itself, as with the scene upon it, is not merely an immortal act in our present mortal scene; it was originally an immortal act in a mortal scene quite different. The imagery of sacrifice, piety, silence, desolation, is that of communication with the immortal or the dead. "23 If the scene de picted in stanza 4 is one of communication with the dead, it can be said to function as a sort of primal scene within a mise-en-abyme structure of repeti tions. The townspeople are engaged in a symbolic transaction that aims at communication with the dead; just as the poet-speaker is engaged in an in terpretive transaction that involves an unexpected encounter with the mor tality of the townspeople; just as we are engaged in a reading practice that makes us witnesses to Keats's singular historical existence. The ode does not, of course, end with stanza 4. In the final stanza, the speaker returns to the general apostrophe to the Urn after he has addressed individual images on its surface. This final stanza has often been faulted for rushing closure or resolution with its re-affirmation of the Urn's status as a "silent form" that "[doth] tease us out of thought / As doth eternity," an entity that gives solace to mortal generations. This strain culminates with the notoriously dogmatic utterance, "Beauty is truth, truth beauty," the Urn's prosopopoetic reply to the speaker's apostrophe.24 The sentiments 23.

These sentiments reinforce a theme which the poem's pre ceding performance seems, however, to call into question, demonstrating a conception of art's therapeutic function that is in need of renewal. If Winnicott defines psycho-therapeutic success as "to enable the patient to abandon invulnerability and to become a sufferer," how might Keats be seen to accomplish in these odes such a movement? And how is the reader implicated in this dynamic? Winnicott's startling invocation of Keats in "Fear of Breakdown" allows for a consideration of the odes as scenes of transference, sites where a com pulsion to look for death gets curiously enacted. To recapitulate, "fear of death," according to the essay, is a defense organization that has arisen in relation to an early traumatic event and masks a radically "unthinkable state ... a breakdown of the establishment of the unit self" (PE 88). The idea of "self" or "ego-organization" here designates the capacity to develop and sustain illusions of continuity, illusions that are constitutively transitional and intermediate in character (in contrast with the ego as false image of unity and wholeness that emerges in Lacan's mirror stage). Clinically, for the patient to be able to move past the "fear of death," a version of the original "failure" that had occasioned the defense needs to take place: "if the patient is ready for some kind of acceptance of this queer kind of truth, that what is not yet experienced did nevertheless happen in the past, then the way is open for the agony to be experienced in the transference, in re action to the analyst's failures and mistakes . . . the patient can [then] ac count for each technical failure of the analyst as countertransference" (PE 90-91). Insofar as for Winnicott psychotherapy derives from the maternal face that "reflects back what is there to be seen," its efficacy will depend in cases on the precarious reflection precisely of maternal failure, of the trau matic breaks in life's continuity that, as Adam Phillips succinctly puts it, "were formative by virtue of their eluding the self."25 It is the sense of complexity with which the tropes of face and mirror ap pear in Winnicott that I would like to bring to bear upon the speaker addressee relationships established apostrophaicaUy in "Nightingale" and "Grecian Urn." The speakers' gestures of address in the odes carry with dressed entity that suddenly acquires the power of speech. See Pierre Fontanier, Les Figures du discours (Paris: Flammarion, 1993). 25. Winnicott (Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1988) 3.</page><page sequence="19">FACING KEATS WITH WINNICOTT 75 them the initial expectation of transcending, via apostrophe, the mortal worlds in which they are situated to enter a condition of oneness with the addressed entity, associated with an immortal, immutable world. Such would be the relief of art. Instead, what is dramatized by the discrepancies between theme and performance in both odes is the failure of the apostrophaic gesture. While the Urn and the Nightingale ostensibly fail to reflect back what the speakers wish for, the poems can be said to reflect back what the speakers bring: a gap or discontinuity that, on the level of aesthetics, bespeaks the process of a critical self-revision and, in the implicit, underlying dimension of autobiography, bespeaks a personal historical trauma. On the autobiographical level, there is discernible within the apostro phes to the Urn and the Nightingale, the contours of a submerged address to the dead brother. And, here, I may add that the myth of Philomela un derlying "Nightingale" involves precisely the address of a sibling taken for dead to another who is alive and capable of speech. When Keats was "half in love with easeful death," he was attempting to reckon with the event of his brother's death in excess of the Ode's emblematic thematization of that death in the image of "when youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies." And, it is in this very attempt to reckon with the death of another that the poet comes to speak of the eventuality of his own death: "Now more than ever seems it rich to die, / To cease upon the midnight with no pain." In "Nightingale" and "Grecian Urn," Keats moves from an aesthetico ethical position proceeding from humanistic generalizations about death and suffering towards one defined and oriented by death as an event. The former may be termed a "defense of poetry," an illusion that protects the self as the price of its communication with and experience of the world, at the expense of its interrelating inner and outer reality. It is this defensive disposition that Keats displays in seeing poetry as a shield against Tom's "countenance his voice and feebleness," against the "here" he tries vari ously to localize in "Nightingale," against the silence of the townspeople in "Grecian Urn." What is abandoned in the defense is "betweenness" of personification, what is destabilized in the undoing of this defense is the "humanist physician'"s stance of invulnerability. Keats may be seen in these poems to become a sufferer who participates in the suffering of others? and who calls upon the reader to do the same. The poet, emerging as a new kind of "physician to all men," is one who will ask his reader in the Prologue to The Fall of Hyperion to judge "[wjhether the dream now pur posed to rehearse / Be poet's or fanatic's . . . / When this warm scribe my hand is in the grave" (i.io?18).
