<plain_text><page sequence="1">64 International Journal of Ethics. TRUTH AND IMAGINATION IN RELIGION. The content of the religious experience is best understood when regarded as closely analogous to one's belief in the dispo- sition toward himself of men or communities. In the case of religion this disposition is attributed to the more or less vaguely conceived residual environment that is recognised as lying out- side the familiar natural and social relations. After the rise of science this residual environment tends to be conceived as a unity which is ultimate or fundamental, but for the religious consciousness it is more commonly regarded as a general source of influence that is practically worthy of consideration. Such a belief, like all beliefs, is practically manifested, with such emphasis upon action, feeling or intellection as temperament and mood may determine. There will, furthermore, be two groups of special characters possessed by religious belief: those peculiar to belief in the favorable or unfavorable attitude of an- other will, and those which are peculiar to the momentousness of the issue in the special case of a divine will.1 But if the psychology of belief be the proper starting point for a description of the religious experience, it is none the less suggestive of the fact that religion, just because it is belief, is not wholly a matter for psychology. For religion mreans to be true, and thus submits itself to evaluation as a case of knowl- edge. The present psychological interest has already justified itself by its fruits, but it is misleading when regarded as replac- ing philosophical criticism. What the religious man wants is sanity and not sanitation. He takes his religion not as a narcotic, but as an enlightenment. Its subjective worth is due at any rate in part to the supposition of its objective worth. As in any case of insight, that which warms the heart must have satisfied the mind. The religious experience purports to be the part of wisdom, and to afford only such happiness as increasing wisdom would confirm. But the charm of truth cannot survive its truthfulness. Hence, though religion may ' Cf. the writer's discussion of "The Religious Experience," in the Monist for October, I904.</page><page sequence="2">Truth and Imagination in Religion. 65 be described, it cannot be justified, from the standpoint of therapeutics. Were such the case it would be the real problem of religious leaders to find a drug capable of giving a constantly pleasant tone to their patient's experience. There would be no difference between priests and physicians who make a specialty of nervous diseases, except that the former would aim at a more fundamental and perpetual suggestion of serenity. Now no man wants to be even a blessed fool. He does not want to dwell constantly in a fictitious world even if it be after his own heart. He may from the cynical point of view actually do so, but if he be religious he thinks it is reality, and is satisfied only in so far as he thinks so. He regards the man who has said in his heart that there is no God as the fool, and not because he may have to suffer for it, but because he is cognitively blind to the real nature of things. Piety, on the other hand, he regards as the standard experience, the most veracious life. Hence, it is not an accident that religion has had its creeds and its controversies, its wars with science, and its appeals to philosophy. The history of these affairs shows that religion commonly fails to understand the scope of its own demand for truth; but they have issued from the deep conviction that one's religion is, implicitly, at least, in the field of truth; that there are theoretical judgments whose truth would justify or contradict it. This general fact being admitted, there remains the task to which the present discussion addresses itself, that of defining the kind of theoretical judgment implied in religion, and the relation to this central cognitive stem of its efflorescences of myth, theology, and ritual. It is impossible to separate the stem and the efflorescence, or to determine the precise spot at which destruction of the tissue would prove fatal to the plant, but it is possible to obtain some idea of the relative vitality of the parts. The difficulty of reaching a definite statement in this matter is due to the fact that the truth in which any religious ex- perience centers is a practical and not a scientific truth. A practical truth does not commit itself to any single scientific statement, and can often survive the overthrow of that scientific Vol. XV-No. I 5</page><page sequence="3">66 International Journal of Ethics. statement in which at any given time it has found expression. In other words an indefinite number of scientific truths are compatible with a single practical truth. An instance of this is the consistency with my expectation of the alternation of day and night, of either the Ptolemaic or Copernican formula- tion of the solar system. Now expectation that the sun will rise to-morrow is an excellent analogue of my religious belief. Celestial mechanics is as relevant to the one as metaphysics to the other. Neither is overthrown until a central practical judgment is discredited, and either could remain true through a very considerable alteration of logical definition; but neither is on this account exempt from theoretical responsibility. In so far as religion deliberately enters the field of science, and defines its formularies with the historical or metaphysical method, this difficulty does not, of course, exist. Grant that the years of Methuselah's life, or the precise place and manner of the temptation of Jesus, or the definition of Christ in the terms of the Athanasian Creed are constitutive of Christianity, and the survival of that religion will be determined by the solution of ordinary problems of historical or metaphysical research. But the Christian will very properly claim that his religion is only externally and accidentally related to such propositions, since they are never or very rarely intended in his experience. As religious he is occupied with Christ as his saviour or with God as his protector and judge. The history of Jesus or the metaphysics of God essentially concern him only in so far as they may or may not invalidate this relationship. He cares only for the power and disposition of the divine, and these are affected by history and metaphysics only in so far as he has definitely put them to such proof. For my religion is my sense of a practical situation, and only when that has been proved to be folly has my religion become untrue. In the light of this fact one may understand the ambiguity that attaches to such propositions as affirm that there is no God. "Hath a nation changed her gods, which yet are no gods?" asks Jeremiah. We are brought at once to the fact that the term god connotes no fixed conception of which the predicate of existence may be affirmed or denied. Generically God sig-</page><page sequence="4">Truth and Imagination in Religion. 67 nifies the bearing upon life of its residual or total environment. He is indeed a fool who has said in his heart that there is no God. For either his religious consciousness has suffered atrophy and he has ceased to consider the universal setting of his life, or he has confused God with some individual deity whom his experience has discredited. Such a special interpre- tation of God would signify some particular adjustment of life to what are supposed to be its most general conditions. Now although any such adjustment may be mistaken, some such adjustment must be true. Hence though God certainly lives, I may be worshipping a false god. But, true or false, my god is my practical faith, my plan of salvation. My religion is overthrown if I am convinced that I have misconceived the situation and mistaken what I should do to be saved. The conception of God is very simple prac- tically, and very complex theoretically, a fact that confirms its practical genesis. My conception of God contains an idea of my own interests, an idea of the disposition of the universe toward my interests, and some working plan for the reconcilia- tion of these two terms. These three elements form a practical unity, but each is capable of emphasis, and a religion may be transformed through the modification of any one of them. It appears, then, as has always been somewhat vaguely recog- nised, that the truth of religion is ethical as well as metaphysical or scientific. My religion will be altered by a change in my conception of what constitutes my real interest, a change in my conception of the fundamental causes of reality, or a change in my conception of the manner in which my will may or may not affect these causes. God cannot be either an entity or an ideal, but is always a relation of entity to ideal reality regarded from the standpoint of its favorableness or unfavorableness to human life, and prescribing for the latter the propriety of a certain attitude. The range of historical examples 2 is limitless, but certain of 2A striking analogue of false religion is to be found in paranoia. A case of this reported recently in New York is peculiarly in point.

Such is the case with Elijah's encounter with the prophets of Baal, as narrated in the Old Testament. "And Elijah came near unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions If Yahweh be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. . . And call ye on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Yahweh: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. . . . And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under. And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, 0 Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. . . . And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is musing, or he is gone aside, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked. And thy cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them.... But there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded."' The religion of the followers of Baal consists in a belief in the practical virtue of a mode of address and form of ritual associated with the traditions and customs of a certain social group. The prophets of this cult agree to regard the test pro- posed by Elijah as an experimentum crucis, and that which is disproved from its failure is a modus operandi. These prophets relied upon the presence of a certain motivity, from which a definite response could be evoked by an appeal which they were peculiarly able to make; but though "they prophesied until the to cover nearly his entire body. This he explained by accusing the New York Academy of Science of vindictively seeking to injure him with an electrical machine. He believed the rubber hose to be a necessary and effective means of insulation. From our critical point of view this man was mistaken because he took wrong precautions against an im- aginary danger. His folly did not consist in his lack of scientific knowl- edge, but in the fact that his expectations and his prudence were not rational in view of the actual situation. His false god was a hostile unseen power from which he could protect his bodily welfare with the aid of a rubber insulator. It is worth while to add that his conduct would also have been irrational had he not conceived his bodily welfare to be his real interest, even had the rest of his belief been warranted.

An equally familiar and more instructive example is the refutation of the Greek national religion by Lucretius. The conception of life which Lucretius finds unwarranted is best depicted in Homer. There we hear of a society composed of gods and men. Though the gods, on the one hand, have their own history, their affairs are never sharply sundered from those of men, who, on the other hand, must constantly reckon with them, gauge their attitude, and seek their favor by paying tribute to their individual humors and preferences. In the Ninth Book of the Iliad, Phoenix addresses himself to the recal- citrant Achilles as follows: "It fits not one that moves The hearts of all, to live unmov'd, and succour hates for loves. The Gods themselves are flexible; whose virtues, honours, pow'rs, Are more than thine, yet they will bend their breasts as we bend ours. Perfumes, benign devotions, savours of offerings burn'd, And holy rites, the engines are with which their hearts are turn'd, By men that pray to them."4 Here is a general recognition of that which makes sacrifice rational. It is because he conceives this presupposition to be mistaken, that Lucretius declares the practices and fears which are founded upon it to be folly. It is the same with all that is practically based upon the expectation of a life beyond the grave. The correction of the popular religion is due in his opinion to that true view of the world taught by Epicurus, whose memory Lucretius thus invokes at the opening of the Third Book of the De Rerum Naturct: "Thee, who first wast able amid such thick darkness to raise on high so bright a beacon and shed a light on the true interests of life, thee I follow, glory of the Greek race, and plant now my footsteps firmly fixed in thy imprinted marks. . . . For as soon as thy philosophy issuing from a godlike intellect has begun with loud voice to proclaim the nature of things, the terrors of the mind are dispelled, the walls of the world part asunder, I see things in operation throughout the whole void: the divinity of the gods is revealed and their tranquil abodes which neither winds do shake nor clouds drench with rains nor snow congealed by 'Iliad, Book IX, lines 467 sq. Translation by Chapman.</page><page sequence="7">70 International Journal of Ethics. sharp frost harms with hoary fall; an ever cloudless ether o'er canopies them, and they laugh with light shed largely round. Nature too sup- plies all their wants and nothing ever impairs their peace of mind. But on the other hand the Acherusian quarters5 are nowhere to be seen. though earth is no bar to all things being descried, which are in opera- tion underneath our feet throughout the void." 6 In another passage, after describing the Phrygian worship of Cybele, he comments as follows: "All which, well and beautifully as it is set forth and told, is yet widely removed from true reason. For the nature of gods must ever in itself of necessity enjoy immortality together with supreme repose, far re- moved and withdrawn from our concerns; since exempt from every pain, exempt from all dangers, strong in its own resources, not wanting aught of us, it is neither gained by favors nor moved by anger. ... The earth however is at all time without feeling, and because it receives into it the first-beginnings of many things, it brings them forth in many ways into the light of the sun."7 If the teaching of Epicurus be true it is evident that those who offered hecatombs with the idea that they were thereby mitigating anger or securing special dispensation, were playing the fool. They were appealing to a fictitious motivity, one not grounded in "the nature of things." To one for whom the walls of the world had parted asunder, such a procedure was no longer possible; though he might choose to "call the sea Neptune" and reverence the earth as "mother of the gods." Plato's criticism of the popular religion forms a very inter- esting contrast.8 He complains not of the conception of a divine interest in human life, but of the representation of that interest as morally indeterminate. The popular conception of the gods is ignoble, reflecting as it does the disorder of common moral opinion instead of the philosophical knowledge of the ideal. The correction which Plato would offer is therefore more fundamental. He would have man first gain moral in- sight, and then find his religion in the contemplation of the eternal and absolute good.

And to Plato the Epicurean would seem scarcely wiser, since in the realm of truth he only substitutes moral indifference for moral confusion. Both have misconceived the relation of universal interests to their own. The history of religion contains no more impressive and dramatic chapter than that which records the development of the religion of the Jews. Passing over its obscure beginnings in the primitive Semitic cult, we find this religion first clearly defined as tribal self-interest sanctioned by Yahweh. God's interest in his chosen people determines the prosperity of him who practices the social virtues. "The name of Yahweh is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe."' "He that is stedfast in righteousness shall attain unto life." "0 "To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice." " But in time it is evident to the believer that his experience does not bear out this expectation. Neither as a Jew nor as a righteous man does he prosper more than his neighbor. He comes, therefore, to distrust the virtue of his wisdom. "Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly as far as light excelleth darkness. The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceive that one event happeneth to them all. Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also was vanity. For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance forever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been already forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool? So I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me: for all is vanity and a striving after wind." 12 It is evident that he who expects the favor of fortune in return for his observance of precept is mistaken. The "work 'Proverbs i8: Io. 1Proverbs I I: i9. '1 Proverbs 2I: 3. 12 Ecclesiastes 2: 13 sq.</page><page sequence="9">72 International Journal of Ethics. that is wrought under the sun" makes no special provision for him during his life time. Unless the cry of vanity is to be the last word there must be a reinterpretation of the promise of God. This appears in the new ideal of patient submission, and the chastened faith that expects only the love of God. And those whom God loves he will not forsake. They will come to their own, if not here, then beyond, according to His inscrut- able but unswerving plan. "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, 0 God, thou wilt not despise."' "I dwell with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit.""'' In this faith Judaism merges into Christianity.'5 In the whole course of this evolution God is regarded as the friend of his people, but his people learn to find a new significance in his friendship. That which is altered is the conduct which that friendship requires, and the expectation which it determines. The practical ideal which the relationship sanctions, changes gradually from that of prudence to that of goodness for its own sake. God, once an instrument relevant to human temporal welfare, -has come to be an object of disinterested service. No such transformation as this was absolutely realised dur- ing the period covered by the writings of the Old Testament, nor has it even yet been realised in the development of Chris- tianity. But the evolution of both Judaism and Christianity has taken this direction. The criterion of this evolution is manifestly both ethical and metaphysical. A Christian avows that he rates purity of character above worldly prosperity, so that the former cannot properly be prized for the sake of the latter. Furthermore, he shares more or less unconsciously such philosophical and scientific opinions as deny truth to the conception of special interferences and dispensations from a supernatural agency. Therefore, he looks for no fire from heaven to consume his sacrifice. But his religion is neverthe- "' Psalms 51: 17. `4 Isaiah 57: 15. f In this discussion of Judaism I am much indebted to Matthew Arnold's "Literature and Dogma," especially Chapters i and 2.</page><page sequence="10">Truth and Imagination in Religion. 73 less a practical expectation. He believes that God is good, and that God loves him and sustains him. He believes that there obtains between himself, in so far as good, and the universe sub specie eternitatis, a real sympathy and reciprocal reinforce- ment. He believes that he secures through the profoundly potent forces of the universe that which he regards as of most worth; and that somewhat is added to these forces by virtue of his consecration. The God of the Christians cannot be defined short of some such account as this, inclusive of an ideal, an attitude, and an expectation. In other words the God of the Christians is to be known only in terms of the Christlike out- look upon life, in which the disciple is taught to emulate the master. When moral and intellectual development shall have discredited either its scale of values, or its conviction that cosmical events are determined in accordance with that scale of values, then Christianity must either be transformed, or be untenable for the wise man. If we have conceived the essence of Christianity too broadly or vaguely, it does not much matter for our present purposes. Its essence is, at any rate, some such inwardness of life resolving ideality and reality into one, and drawing upon objective truth only to the extent required for the confirming of that relation. And if Christianity be the same yesterday and to-day, whether dogmatic, mystical, evangelical, pietistic, ritualistic, or iconoclastic, it is on account of the perpetuation of something no less subtle theoretically nor less simple practically than an attitude. "J' affirme donc," says Sabatier, "non seulement que le christianisme a le Christ pour auteur, mais qu'il a, dans le vie interieure du Christ, son premier germe, et que la s'est faite tout d'abord la revelation divine qui, se repetant ensuite de proche en proche, a eclaire et vivifie toute l'humanite." 16 We conclude, then, our attempt to emphasise the cognitive factor in religion, with the thesis that every religion centers in a practical secret of the universe. To be religious is to be- lieve that a certain correlation of forces, moral and factual, is in reality operative, and that it determines the propriety and '6Auguste Sabatier: Esquisse dune philosophie de la religion.</page><page sequence="11">74 International Journal of Ethics. effectiveness of a certain type of living. Whatever demon- strates the futility, vanity, or self-deception of this living, dis- credits the religion. And, per contra, except as it define or refute such practical truth, religion is not essentially concerned with judgments of truth. But neither religion nor any other human interest consists in essentials. Such a practical conviction as that which has been defined inevitably flowers into a marvelous complexity, and taps for its nourishment every spontaneity of human nature. If it be said that only the practical conviction is essential, this is not the same as to say that all else is super- fluous. There may be no single utterance that my religion could not have spared, and yet were I to be altogether dumb, my religion would, indeed, be as nothing. For if I believe, I accept a presence in my world, which as I live at all, will figure in my dreams, or in my thoughts, or in my habits. And each of these expressions of myself will have a truth if they do but bear out my practical acceptance of that presence. But the language of religion like that of daily life, is not the language of science except it take it upon itself to be so. There is scarcely a sentence which I utter in my daily intercourse with men which is not guilty of transgressions against the canons of accurate and definitive thinking. Yet if I deceive neither myself nor another, I am held to be truthful, even though my language deal with chance and accident, material purposes and spiritual causes, and though I vow that the sun smiles or the moon lets down her hair into the sea. Science is a special interest in the discovery of unequivocal and fixed conceptions, and employs its terms with an unalterable connotation. But no such algebra of thought is indispensable to life or conversa- tion, and its lack is no proof of error. Such is the case also with that eminently living affair re- ligion. I may if I choose, and I will if my reasoning powers be at all awakened, be a theologian. But theology, like science, is a special intellectual spontaneity. St. Thomas the master- theologian did not glide unwittingly from prayer into the quaestiones of the Summta Theologiae, but turned to them as to a fresh adventure. Theology is inevitable, because humanly</page><page sequence="12">Truth and Imagincation in Religion. 75 speaking adventure is inevitable. For man with his intellectual spontaneity, every object is a problem; and did he not seek sooner or later to define salvation, there would be good reason to believe that he did not practically reckon with any. But this is similarly and 'independently true of the imagination, the most familiar means with which man clothes and vivifies his convictons, the exuberance with which he plays about them and delights to confess them. The imagination of religion, contributing what Matthew Arnold called its "poetry and elo- quence," does not submit itself to such canons as are binding upon theology or science, but exists and flourishes in its own right. The indispensableness to religion of the imagination is due to that faculty's power of realizing what is not perceptually present. Religion is not interested in the apparent, but in the secret essence or the transcendent universal. And yet this in- terest is a practical one. Imagination may introduce one into the vivid presence of the secret or the transcendent. It is evi- dent that the religious imagination here coincides with poetry. It is at least one of the interests of poetry to cultivate and satisfy a sense for the universal; to obtain an immediate ex- perience or appreciation that shall have the vividness without the particularism of ordinary perception. This is mysticism, but not a mysticism that offers itself as a theoretical principle. It does not claim that its peculiar experience is superior in cognitive worth to discursive thinking; but deliberately elects to so view the world, whether for better or for worse so far as the interest of knowledge is concerned. And where as a poet he chooses to do so, we allow him as a poet the privilege, and judge him by the standards to which he submits himself. That upon which we pass judgment is the fitness of his expression. This expression is not, except in the case of the theoretical mystic, regarded as constituting the most valid form of the idea, but is appreciated expressly for its fulfilment of the con- dition of immediacy. The same sort of critical attitude is in order with the fruits of the religious imagination. These may or may not fulfil enough of the requirements of that art to be properly de-</page><page sequence="13">76 International Journal of Ethics. nominated poetry; but like poetry they are the translation of ideas into a specific language. They must not, therefore, be judged as though they claimed to excel in point of validity, but only in point of consistency with the context of that lan- guage. And the language of religion is the language of the practical life. Such translation is as essential to an idea that is to enter into the religious experience, as translation into terms of immediacy is essential to an idea that is to enter into the appreciative consciousness of the poet. No object can find a place in my religion until it is con- joined with my purposes and hopes; until it is taken for granted and acted upon, like the love of my friends, or the courses of the stars, or the stretches of the sea. The re- ligious imagination, then, is to be understood and justified as that which brings the objects of religion within the range of my living. The central religious object, as has been seen, is an attitude of the residuum or totality of things. To be religious one must have a sense for the presence of an attitude, like his sense for the presence of his human fellows, with all the added appreciation that is proper in the case of an object so unique in its mystery or in its majesty. The presence of one's fellows is in part the perceptual experience of their bodies. To this there corresponds in religion some extraordinary or subtle appearance. The gods may in visions or dreams be met with in their own proper embodiments; or, as is more common, they may be regarded as present for practical purposes: in some inanimate object, as in the case of the fetish; in some animal species, as in the case of the totem; in some place, as in the case of the shrine; or even in some human being, as in the case of the inspired prophet and miracle-worker. In more refined and highly de- veloped religions the medium of God's presence is less specific. He is perceived with "-a sense sublime "Of something far more deeply interfused, "Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, "And the round ocean and the living air, "And the blue sky, and in the mind of man."</page><page sequence="14">Truth and Imagination in Religion. 77 God is here found in an interpretation of the common and the natural, rather than in any individual and peculiar embodiment. And here the poet's appreciation, if not his art, is peculiarly indispensable. But, furthermore, his fellows are inmates of "the household of man" in that he knows their history. They belong to the context of actions and events. Similarly, the gods must be historical. The sacred traditions or books of religion are largely occupied with this history. The more individual and anthropomorphic the gods, the more local and episodic will be the account of their affairs. In the so-called higher religions the acts of God are few and momentous, such as creation or special providence; or they are identical with the events of nature and human history when these are construed as divine. To find God in this latter way requires an interpretation of the course of events in terms of some moral consistency, a faith that sees some purpose in their evident destination. There is still another and a more significant way in which men recognise one another: the way of address and con- versation. And men have invariably held a similar inter- course with their gods. To this category belong communion and prayer, with all their varieties of expression. I have no god until I address him. This will be the most direct evidence of what is at least from my point of view a social relation. There can be no general definition of the form which this address will take. There may be as many special languages, as many attitudes, and as much playfulness and subtlety of symbolism as in human intercourse. But, on the other hand, there are certain utterances that are peculiarly appropriate to religion. In so far as he regards his object as endowed with both power and goodness the worshipper will use the language of adoration; and the sense of his dependence will speak in terms of consecration and thanksgiving. "O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: "My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, "In a dry and weary land, where no water is. "So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary, "To see thy power and thy glory.</page><page sequence="15">78 International Journal of Ethics. "For thy loving kindness is better than life; "My lips shall praise thee." These are expressions of a hopeful faith; but, on the other hand, God may be addressed in terms of hatred and distrust. In either case there may be an indefinite degree of hyperbole. The language of love and hate, of confidence and despair, is not the language of description. In this strain of the religious consciousness there is occasion for whatever eloquence man can feel, and whatever rhetorical luxuriance he can utter. Such considerations as these serve to account for the exer- cise and certain of the fruits of the religious imagination, and to designate the general criterion governing its propriety. But how is one to determine the boundary between the imaginative and the cognitive? It is commonly agreed that what religion says and does is not all intended literally. But when is expres- sion of religion only poetry and eloquence, and when is it matter of conviction? If we revert again to the cognitive aspect of religion, it is evident that there is but one test to apply: whatever either fortifies or misleads the will is convic- tion. This test cannot be applied absolutely, because it can be properly applied only to the intention of an individual experi- ence. However I may express my religion, that which I express, is, we have seen, an expectation. The degree to which I literally mean what I say is then the degree to which it de- termines my expectations. Whatever adds no item to these expectations, but only recognises and vitalises them, is pure imagination. But it follows that it is entirely impossible from its internal meaning to define any given expression of religious experience as myth, or to define the degree to which it is myth. It submits to such distinctions only when viewed from the standpoint of the concrete religious experience which it ex- presses. Any such given expression could easily be all im- agination to one, and all conviction to another. Consider the passage which follows: "And I saw the heaven opened; and behold, a white horse, and he that sat thereon, called Faithful and True; and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. And his eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head are many diadems; and he hath a name written, which no one</page><page sequence="16">Truth and Imagination in Religion. 79 knoweth but he himself. And he is arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood; and his name is called The Word of God."" Is this all rhapsody, or is it in part true report? There is evi- dently no answer to the question so conceived. But if it were to express my own religious feeling it would have some specific proportion of literal and metaphorical significance, according to the degree to which its detail contributes different practical values to me. It might be then my guide-book to the heavens, or only my testimony to the dignity and mystery of the function of Christ. The development of religion bears in a very important way upon this last problem. The factor of imagination has un- doubtedly come to have a more clearly recognized role in re- ligion. There can be no doubt that what we now call myths were once beliefs, and that what we now call poetry was once history. If we go back sufficiently far we come to a time when the literal and the metaphorical were scarcely distinguishable, and this because science had not emerged from the early ani- mistic extension of social relations. Men meant to address their gods as they addressed their fellows, and expected them to hear and respond, as they looked for such reactions within the narrower circle of ordinary intercourse. The advance of science has brought into vogue a description of nature that inhibits such expectations. The result has been that men, continuing to use the same terms, essentially expressive, as they are, of a practical relationship, have come to regard them as only a general expression of their attitude. The differences of content that are in excess of factors of expectation remain as poetry and myth. On the other hand, it is equally possible, if not equally common, for that which was once imagined to come to be believed. Such a transformation is, perhaps, normally the case when the inspired utterance passes from its author to the cult. The prophets and sweet singers are likely to possess an exuberance of imagination not appreciated by their followers; and for this reason almost certainly misunderstood. For these reasons it is manifestly absurd to fasten the name of 17 Revelations.</page><page sequence="17">80 International Journal of Ethics. myth or the name of creed upon any religious utterance what- soever, unless it be so regarded from the standpoint of the personal religion which it originally expressed, or unless one means by so doing to define it as an expression of his own religion. He who defines "the myth of creation" or "the poetical story of Samson" as parts of the pre-Christian Judaic religion, exhibits a total loss of historical sense. The distinc- tion between cognition and fancy does not exist among objects, but only in the intending experience; hence, for me to attach my own distinction to any inidividual case of belief, viewed apart from the believer, is an utterly confusing projection of my own personality into the field of my study. Only after such considerations as these are we qualified to attack that much-vexed question as to whether religion deals invariably with a personal god. This question is often treated as though "personal god" were, as well as "god," a definite conceptual entity with a generally recognized meaning, its existence alone being problematical. This is doubly false to the religious employment of such an object. If it be true that in religion we mean by God a practical interpretation of the world, whatsoever be its nature, then the personality of God must be a derivative of this attitude, and not the attribute of a metaphysical substance. Given the practical outlook upon life, there is no definable world that cannot be construed under the form of God. My god is my world practically recognized in respect of its fundamental or ultimate attitude to my ideals. In the sense, then, conveyed by this term attitude my will in- variably possess the characters of personality. But the degree to which these characters will coincide with the characters which I assign to human persons, or the terms of any logical conception of personality, cannot be absolutely defined. Anthropomorphisms may be imagination, or they may be literal convictions. This will depend, as above maintained, upon the degree to which they determine my expectations. Suppose the world to be theoretically conceived as governed by laws that are indiffernt to all human interests. The practical expression of this conception appears in the naturalism of Lucretius, or Diogenes, or Omar Khayyam. Living in the vivid presence</page><page sequence="18">Truth and Imagination in Religion. 8I of an indifferent world, I may picture my gods as leading their own lives in some remote realm which is inaccessible to my petitions, or as regarding me with sinister and contemptu- ous cruelty. In the latter case I may shrink and cower, or return them contempt for contempt. I mean this literally only if I look for consequences following directly from the emo- tional coloring which I have bestowed upon them. It may well be that I mean merely to regard myself sub specie eternitatis, in which case I am personifying in the sense of free imagina- tion. In the religion of enlightenment personality tends to belong to the poetry and eloquence of religion rather than to its cognitive intent. This is equally true of optimistic and idealistic religon. The love and providence of God have largely ceased to consist in the expectation of special and arbitrary favors, and have come more and more to mean the play of my own feeling about the general central conviction of the favorableness of the cosmos to my deeper or moral concerns. But the factor of personality cannot possibly be entirely eliminated, for the religious consciousness creates a social relationship between man and the universe. Such an interpretation of life is not a case of the pathetic fallacy, unless it incorrectly reckons with the inner feeling which it attributes to the universe. It is an obvious practical truth that the total or residual environment is significant for life. Grant this and you make rational a recognition of that significance, or a more or less constant sense of coincidence or conflict with cosmical forces. Permit this consciousness to stand, and you make some expression of it inevitable. Such an expression may, furthermore, with perfect propriety and in fulfilment of human nature, set forth and transfigure this central belief until it may enter into the context of immediacy. Such considerations as these justify religion in general, even if its anthropomorphisms be regarded as inevitable. There is no religion, however, that does not virtually make a more definite claim upon the nature of things, and this entirely inde- pendently of its theology, or explicit attempt to define itself. Every religion, even in the very living of it, is naturalistic, or dualistic, or pluralistic, or optimistic, or idealistic, or pessim- Vol. XV-No. I 6</page><page sequence="19">82 International Journal of Ethics. istic. And there is in the realm of truth that which justifies or refutes these definite practical ways of construing the uni- verse. But no historical religion is ever so vague even as this in its philosophical implications. Indeed, we shall always be brought eventually to the inner meaning of some individual religious experience, where no general criticism can be certainly valid. There is, then, a place in religion for that which is not directly answerable to philosophical or scientific standards. But there is always, on the other hand, an element of hope which conceives the nature of the world, and means to be grounded in reality. In respect of that element, philosophy is indispensable to religion. The meaning of religion is, in fact, the central problem of philosophy. There is a virtue in religion like that which Emerson ascribes to poetry. "The poet is in the right attitude; he is believing; the philosopher, after some struggle, having only reasons for believing." But what- ever may be said to the disparagement of its dialectic, phi- losophy is the justification of religion, and of religions. To it must be asssigned the task of so refining and criticising positive religion as to contribute to the perpetual establishment of true religion. And to philosophy, with religion, belongs the task of holding fast to the idea of the universe. There is no re- ligion except before you begin, or after you have rested from your philosophical speculation. But in the universe they have a common object. As philosophy is the articulation and vin- dication of religion, so is religion the realisation of philosophy. In philosophy thought is brought up to the elevation of life, and in religion philsophy, as the sum of wisdom, enters into life. RALPH BARTON PERRY. HARVARD UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
