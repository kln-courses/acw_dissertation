<plain_text><page sequence="1">Iťs Not About You: Loon Games on Waiden Pond Joan R. Wry The Cornell Lab of Ornithology, a leading nonprofit environmental organization and the world's largest compiler of bird sounds, notes in its web Bird Guide that "pairs and groups of common loons often call to each other," and "they are very sensitive to human disturbance" ("Common Loons"). At no point does the Cornell Lab Guide suggest that loons care anything about communicating or interacting with those disturbing humans. In Thoreau's Waiden, the chapter "Brute Neighbors" offers some of its own analysis of loon calls in the context of a game a loon appears to be playing with the writer. There is much critical commentary about this well-liked passage in Waiden and much speculation on the "pretty game" that takes place above and beneath the pond's surface. But I suggest that more emphasis needs to be placed on the less poetic recognition of the loon's disinterest in his human opponent's earnest game - a fact- based possibility that Thoreau doesn't address in his chapter. And yet the encounter with the loon marks a significant turning point for Thoreau in his understanding of the relationship between human beings and the natural world, and it is loaded with instructive potential that becomes more fully realized in Walderìs later chapters. Lawrence Buell describes the process "after 1850" during which "Thoreau became increasingly interested in defining nature's structure, both spiritual and material, for its own sake, as against how nature might, subserve humanity, which was Emerson's primary consideration" (117); I would argue that one of the most significant moments in that shift is dramatized at the close of "Brute Neighbors." If Thoreau's thinking about nature in Waiden "seems pretty clearly to move along a path from homocentrism toward biocentrism," as Buell notes, the end of the loon game in "Brute Neighbors" marks a literal and figurative distancing from the homocentric stance that characterizes all but the final page of the chapter (138). Literally, the loon keeps its secrets and its distance as Thoreau departs in awe: "I was impressed as if it were the prayer of the loon answered, and his god was angry with me; and so I left him" (236). Wai Chee Dimock comments that "the intervening force" in this case "is literally a deus ex machina, in the shape of the god of The Concord S aunterer: A Journal of Thoreau Studies , N.S. Vol. 23, 2015</page><page sequence="2">Joan R. Wry 99 loons, signaling to Thoreau to leave the bird alone" (399). Figuratively, Thoreau signals his own turn from what Buell calls "the program Emerson outlined in Nature," a program based on "a theory of correspondence. . .which sacralized nature as humankind's mystic counterpart," and within which "physical nature could be decoded as a spiritually coherent system of signs" (117). For in spite of Emerson's (and Swedenborg' s) validation that "the inspired creative imagination [is] the means by which nature's meanings were to be read," Thoreau can't fully decode the loon's mysteries, a realization that, as I will show, moves him from a stance of aggrandized anthropomorphism in the beginning of the chapter to an enlightened recognition of biocentrism by the chapter's close (Buell 117). This dramatic shift, one mirrored on a larger scale in Waiden as a whole, does not seem likely in light of the premise Thoreau establishes in "Brute Neighbors" with this opening conjecture: "Why has man just these species of animals for neighbors; as if nothing but a mouse could have filled this crevice?. . .for they are all beasts of burden, in a sense, made to carry some portion of our thoughts" (225). Clearly, Thoreau has every intention of asserting his presence in what he perceives as a sphere of correspondence in Walden's "natural" neighborhood; he believes that he will successfully discern meaning in "just these" animal neighbors because they can be "decoded as a spiritually coherent system of signs" mirrored in his own thoughts. In the early examples from this chapter, Thoreau does explore the notion of animal neighbors who interact amiably with the human beings in their sphere; in his own environs, these are the moles "nesting" in his cellar, the wasps "bedding" with him in spite of an occasional sting, as well as a mouse that gradually becomes "familiar enough" to sit in the palm of his hand (226). Other wild animals and inhabitants of the wooded areas beyond Thoreau's cabin are objects of speculation and wonder, or in the case of the batile of the ants, even of "ferocious" entertainment. "You only need sit still long enough in some attractive spot in the woods that all its inhabitants may exhibit themselves to you by turns," Thoreau notes, and his observations in each example suggest that he has little trouble discerning the reasons for the actions and reactions of his animal neighbors (228). But in the concluding pages of this chapter, Thoreau presents a very different model of human and animal interaction, one perhaps at odds with the naturally evolving relationships of correspondence he recounts in the chapter's</page><page sequence="3">100 The Concord S aunterer: A Journal ofThoreau Studies beginning. His account of an interaction with a loon above and beneath the surface interstice of Waiden Pond suggests that separateness rather than correspondence may mark human efforts to predict or control animal behavior, as well as to discern what animals may be thinking. Thoreau's description of what he calls the "pretty game" with this clever loon is mapped out on the pond's surface, depths, and peripheries (235); it is a game of anticipation and thwarted expectations, as well as (at least in some measure) a failed experiment: "While he was thinking one thing in his brain, I was endeavoring to divine his thought in mine," Thoreau explains, but then determines after a series of parries across the surface of the pond as well as within its deeper margins that the loon was "laugh [ing] in derision of [his] efforts, confident of his own resources" (236). This stance is very much at odds with Thoreau's almost omniscient perspective in the initial examples of the brute neighbors found in the biosphere of Waiden; of the twenty- four or so creatures Thoreau names and then characterizes (essentially in relation to himself), only two can't be fathomed by this New England Adam: the mysterious winged cat that sounds more like legend than flesh and blood feline - Thoreau has never actually seen one of these cats - and the loon that outwits him at the chapter's close. Even the graphic and grotesque batde of the ants, which Charles Anderson call "the most celebrated fable in Waiden," is no more than "close observation" manipulated to serve as Thoreau's own orchestrated allegory of human brutality in warfare, replete with puns and classical and historical allusions (189). But these participants in "events of a less peaceful character" - the warring ants that stand in contrast to the rest of the compliant inhabitants of Thoreau's pastoral neighborhood - are still viewed entirely in the context of omniscient human control. It is significant that Thoreau finds the "two races of ants" in what he first establishes as "my wood-pile, or rather my pile of stumps," clearly delineating that the forum they use is on his property (228). 1 After observing the combatting intruders and assessing them as more "resolute" than he had expected, Thoreau notes that he is "excited somewhat even as if they had been men," and he is pleased to find that mere "thinking" does in this case make for a willed context of correspondence to impose (for the sake of entertainment) on one's brute neighbors: "The more you think of it, the less the difference" (230). Thoreau decides - these ants could be warring men, with the right perspective. But in this batde, Thoreau - as self-appointed wood-pile</page><page sequence="4">Joan R. Wry 101 owner and bellum voyeur - can create his own tableau vivant (albeit a temporary one) by removing a single woodchip from the batdefield to better observe three chosen combatants fixed "under a tumbler," as well as "to see the issue" under a magnifying lens (230). The battlefield microcosm is a clear ring of combat - one fully controlled by the spectator and contained by the walls of the transparent glass dome, the canopy of which is formed by the "microscope" lens that magnifies the carnage.2 But Thoreau is not able to sustain the duration or the intensity of the batde; as the ants dismember one another he determines that one of the more injured "would not be worth much thereafter." The decision to "raise the glass" is a practical one - there will soon be nothing left to watch - but Thoreau is the deus ex machina of the drama as he dismandes the stage and ends the spectacle. The initial rhetorical question in the chapter about "objects that we behold... mak [ing] a world" is in this instance shifted from an objective to a subjective stance: Thoreau, not the objects he refers to in his question, makes the world we behold in this scene. Moreover, the "making" of this particular microcosm generates an episode of anthropomorphized entertainment for the maker: "I felt for the rest of that day as if I had had my feelings excited and harrowed by witnessing the struggle, the ferocity and carnage, of a human battle before my door" (231). But the battle is not human in spite of the best workings of Thoreau's imagination; these ants are only some of the "many creatures [that] live wild and free though secret in the woods" until - and this seems to be Thoreau's point - human agents endeavor to uncover, to expose, and ultimately to publish those secrets (227). The encounter is contrived and conducted within a controlled medium; it is yet another example of the way that "beasts of burden" are - at least from a human perspective - "made to carry some portion of our thoughts" in contexts that we determine at will (225). Thoreau has already established the locus of Waiden Pond as an essential medium of Emersonian correspondence in the chapter on "The Ponds": it is the "earth's eye; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his own nature" (471).3 Moreover, Waiden Pond is "a mirror which no stone can crack, whose quicksilver will never wear off," and in its reflection, of course, Thoreau finds himself (473). After describing the pond as a "walled- in... field of water" (468, 473), a contained image of correspondence "continually receiving new life and motion from above," and "betraying the spirit that is in the air," Thoreau perhaps reasonably</page><page sequence="5">102 The Concord S aunterer: A. Journal ofThoreau Studies assumes that the pond's creatures, its birds and fishes, are agents of correspondence as well (473). But after witnessing the controlled batdefield entertainment of the warring ants, it seems that Thoreau has clear expectations for the encounter he is about to have with the loon in "Brute Neighbors" on the larger, but still contained (and at least partially transparent) microcosm of the pond. Thoreau quickly establishes that he has knowledge of the identification and behavioral patterns of loons; he names the bird first by its Latin genus and species, Colymhus gladalis, and then observes with assurance that it "came, as usuaĻ to moult and bathe in the pond" (233, emphasis mine). It would seem that this creature is yet another of the many "inhabitants" of Waiden "that may exhibit themselves to you by turns," as Thoreau notes earlier - although this loon may not be as familiar and compliant as the woodland animals mentioned in the earlier examples, or as easily contained as warring ants under a fully transparent dome. But Thoreau considers Waiden Pond as a "walled- in" setting for his experiment, and if he can't magnify his observations of the loon's movements with a lensed canopy, he is still clearly confident of his knowledge of the pond's perimeters - the rounded shoreline that essentially encircles and "contains" the loon. From the onset of this chapter, Nature favors the loon against its foes - in the initial loon account these are the Mill-dam sportsmen - but Thoreau notes as well that "too often the sportsmen were successful" against Nature's protection, and that he himself is "more than a match for [a loon] on the surface" of the pond he knows so well (234). Still, the way this match plays out on "one very calm October afternoon" seems at odds with Thoreau's perception of what loons "commonly" do, and after focusing almost obsessively on the loon's "wild... long and loud" laughter as a form of self- betrayal that allows Thoreau to discern its location, he quickly realizes that he has instead "miscalculated the direction" of the elusive creature. In Thoreau's mind, this gives the loon "more reason" to laugh than before, as it continues to "manoeuvre so cunningly" above and beneath the surface of the pond (234). H. Daniel Peck describes these parries between Thoreau and the loon he chases as a "dance" (123); Thoreau, however, never uses this word, describing the actions instead as "a pretty game," even as he acknowledges that the game is in some measure cerebral: "While he was thinking one thing in his brain, I was endeavoring to divine his thought in mine." But Thoreau has a literal game in mind as well - at least as a point of comparison - and the pond's smooth surface</page><page sequence="6">Joan R. Wry 103 becomes analogous to a checkerboard upon which the game is played. It is also a game in which one player seems to be cheating - playing beneath the board rather than on its surface; his winning "adversary's checker disappears beneath the board," while he is forced to address the obvious "problem" of determining where to land "nearest to where his [opponent's checker] will appear again" (235). In Thomas Pughe's reading of this passage, "Thoreau describes the man and the animal as partners in a game whose rules they have laid down together and that they both respect" (257). But I would argue that this is not a game in which "rules" are mutually agreed upon or respected. Rather, it's obvious Thoreau views himself as unfairly outmatched - thwarted by "unexpected" and oppositional moves on the part of a "long-winded and unweariable" competitor with both the "time and ability" to visit the deepest and most mysterious recesses of the pond. Thoreau speculates that the fish at the bottom must be "surprised... to see this ungainly visitor from another sphere speeding away amid their schools," but as the loon also "appear [s] to know his course as surely under water as on the surface," it is likely that the fish would not be surprised at all (235). Of course Thoreau can't see this deep encounter, but he nonetheless assumes that the fish would react with surprise - as he himself has been surprised each time the loon's submerged trajectories bring him to an unexpected periphery of the pond. Moreover, Thoreau betrays his own homocentric perspective in the next rhetorical question of this chapter: "But why, after displaying so much cunning, did [the loon] invariably betray himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh?" (235). "He was indeed a silly loon," Thoreau concludes, even as he continues to acknowledge his preoccupation with the loon's cunning, his unearthly laugh, a laugh that is even "demoniac" at one point. Thoreau at least initially seems incapable of assessing the loon's varied calls in light of anything besides a challenge to himself - as part of an effort to outwit, out maneuver, and finally out play a human opponent. "I concluded that he laughed in derision of my efforts, confident of his own resources," Thoreau admits, even as, still Adam-like, he names this laughter as "looning, -perhaps the wildest sound that is ever heard here" (236). But naming the sound of the loon's wildness doesn't decode its mysteries, and the game concludes with a final "prolonged howl" - a description that Wai Chee Dimock describes as "a strange sonic misalignment"; an indication of just how little those creatures from the wild are</page><page sequence="7">104 The Concord S aunterer: A Journal ofThoreau Studies "attuned to us, outside the scope of our reasoning," for they move "according to a logic of [their] own, and not one that readily makes sense to humans" (398). Several recent studies of loon behavior have confirmed that most of the varied calls attributed to loons are distinct forms of communication with other loons, and in spite of the "human-like qualities" of these sounds, "the vocalization of loons are acoustically complex and not easily deciphered by humans" (Piper, Mager, and Walcott 220). Loons are generally assessed as having four basic types of calls; Thoreau seems to note at least three of them in this passage and elsewhere in Waiden and the journals.4 According to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the "tremolo" is a wavering call given when a loon is alarmed, or to announce its presence on a body of water; the "wail" is the haunting call that loons give back and forth to determine one another's location; the "hoot" is a soft short call given to keep contact between loon pairs, or to reinforce contact between a parent and a chick; and, as noted earlier, the "yodel" is a male loon's territorial claim. Each male has his own signature yodel, and if he moves to a different territory he'll change his yodel as a response to that transition ("Common Loons"). It is possible to see Thoreau's initial description of the loon's "wild laugh" as the tremolo; this call then seems to escalate into the "demoniac laughter" of yodeling as the loon's "usual note." But the primary focus in the chapter is on the "long-drawn unearthly howl" of the loon's wail - an interactive call that Thoreau ironically hears only in relation to himself, and not in light of the possibility of other loons in the area.5 This loon is seen and heard as an (unlikely) singular essence in the pond, and its varied patterns of "laughter" (examples of the tremolo and the yodel) are mistakenly interpreted as the creature's directed response in "derision of [Thoreau's] efforts" as part of an exchange of correspondence (236). Perhaps with these kinds of thwarted "efforts" in mind, Sharon Cameron notes that "having banished the human world" in order to engage in an experiment of natural correspondence, Thoreau "fights a losing battle to keep from personifying the natural one... equating nature's reason for being with our ability to ascribe significance to it" (146). But Thoreau's efforts to ascribe significance to the loon's distinct and purposeful calls all but deny the fact-based possibility of an essentially intra-species form of communication that has litde to do with Thoreau's self-referential interpretations. And in spite of Thoreau's assumption that he is viewing yet another precisely suited example of the interactive "beasts of burden" of the</page><page sequence="8">Joan R. Wry 105 natural world, this loon is an "object" that is anything but "precise" in its movements and positioning (225). Peck recalls Thoreau's initial rhetorical question regarding "precisely these objects" (and not others) which "make a world" when he acknowledges that "the world as we know it corresponds exacdy to our needs and expectations... the world we know through perception is a 'fitting' world, a world of balance and symmetry" (117). Peck notes further that "Thoreau's failed pursuit of the loon dramatizes this creature's refusal to be contained (familiarized) within the Edenie vision of Waiden sketched earlier, or brought under the naturalist's microscope as an anti- war passage" (120). Indeed, Thoreau's Adam-like naming of the varied brute neighbors, his earlier assessment of animal parenting skills, as well as his trust in the efforts and willingness of these creatures to submit to him as if in compliance with an Old Testament mandate, all point to willed correspondence between humans and the natural world - or nature "sacralized" as "humankind's mystic counterpart" (Buell 117). Admittedly, even as Thoreau is enthralled by the loon's "cunning," the attribute has clear negative overtones: defined as "a skill in deception," the word "cunning" draws back to Thoreau's earlier reference to loon games that are played under the table rather than above it. The suggestion of something that is unfair then points to something unnatural, or "unearthly" - as Thoreau describes the loon's laughter at several points, a laugh that is "not of this earth," eerie, but perhaps also supernatural, as suggested by the loons' alliance with the loon god who helps him to escape by causing a wind from the east to "ripple" and distort the surface of the pond, "fillfing] the whole air with misty rain" (236). In one sense, things that are unearthly are by nature antithetical to correspondence with human beings residing in the natural world, and at the very least, Thoreau's frustration in this "pretty game" results in a turning away, or, in keeping with the game metaphor, a folding, an acquiescence - a decision to "give up" and let one's opponent win. The Adam who presides over the Eden of Waiden Pond does not fully comprehend and correspond with all those "inhabitants who may exhibit themselves to you by turns," and he can no longer fully sustain his claim in the chapter's opening that these "species of animals" are "all beasts of burden, made to carry some portion of our thoughts" (228, 225). And yet that precise moment of acquiescence - when Thoreau consciously turns away: "and so I left him disappearing far away on the tumultuous surface" - signals the most instructive insight of his</page><page sequence="9">106 The Concord S aunterer: A. Journal ofThoreau Studies encounter with the loon. In the penultimate line of the chapter, Thoreau admits simply, "I do not know"; and in the admission of not knowing what nature "means" in that moment, he frees himself from an Emersonian way of seeing (237). For in spite of Thoreau's initial interpretation of an apparent loss in this contest - not to mention the irony of the loon's apparent disinterest in competing in the first place - the game on Waiden Pond dramatizes what was ultimately a transformative moment for Thoreau, a wondrous encounter with the wild that initiates his first real non-self-referential perception of a biosphere. Somewhat ironically, nature is "sacralized" in this definitive moment of turning away: the loon's "white breast" is objectified against the "smoothness of the water" and the "stillness of the air"; the howl that calls "on the god of loons" conjures an "immediate" wind that "filled the whole air with misty rain" (236) - but nature is not "sacralized as humankind's mystic counterpart," to borrow Lawrence Buell's phrasing. Clearly Thoreau evolves from an initial stance of defeat and frustration when the game concludes in this chapter into a widened (and wizened) change in perspective. Sharon Cameron notes a "boldness of distinction between one natural phenomenon and another" in describing Thoreau's recognition that it is essential to "illuminate identity not through correspondence (between man and nature or between nature and itself) but by light of the very difference through which, at once isolated from us and self- referential, things noncommittally reveal what they are" (79). For even though the loon is left undisturbed and isolated, free to disappear "on the tumultuous surface" of the pond (236), it is also revealed to Thoreau as a kind of commensurate kindred spirit whose intelligence in the wild is equal to (or surpassing of) his own. Thoreau's final observation in the chapter underscores this notion of correspondence in the face of separateness: the ducks glide on the pond's surface in a particular pattern for reasons "unknown" to their observer, but in the absence of this understanding is a new insight that the ducks and loons on Waiden Pond - as well as Thoreau himself - may in fact "love its water for the same reason" (237).</page><page sequence="10">Joan R. Wry 107 NOTES 1. Thoreau's "property" at Waiden was actually owned by Emerson. The woodpile and "pile of stumps" could be considered Thoreau's own as he created them from the trees on Emerson's land, but the warring ants would seem to have a better claim to both the wood and the stumps as part of their natural habitat. 2. Thoreau refers to the lens as a "microscope" but the device used is a simple magnifying lens encased with a rounded frame. Held just above the inverted glass tumbler, the lens could appear as a transparent dome through which to view the spectacle below (230). 3. Here Thoreau is consistent with Emerson's metaphor of sight, expressed in images such as the transparent eyeball in Nature. 4. Although Thoreau never refers to distinct loon calls by name, the only call described (and recorded) by the Cornell Bird Guide that does not seem to be represented in Thoreau's writing is the "hoot," a short, soft call rarely heard unless chicks are present. 5. The first systematic investigation of loon behavior began in 1992, when David Evers and a team of researchers of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began to track hundreds of adult loons with leg bands. After eighteen years of statistical analysis, sonogram studies of loon calls have allowed researchers to tell different loons apart by their yodels, but researchers feel that loons yodel "to announce their identity, fitness, and willingness to fight" other loons for territory, and not as a response outside of the species.
