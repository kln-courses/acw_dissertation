<plain_text><page sequence="1">Soviet Studies in American Thought Part I: Early American Philosophy John Ryder Historians of phlilosophy in the Soviet Union have been interested in the history of American philosophy for some time. Until relatively recently that interest was focused primarily on developments in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. American Pragmatism and Naturalism have tended to command the large share of attention from those Soviet philosophers interested in the field.2 During the past ten years, however, more careful attention has been paid to earlier work in the American philosophic tradition. This and a subsequent essay will offer a review of some of the literature Soviet historians of American philosophy have produced. We will here focus on Soviet studies of early American thought while the sequel will review several works which deal with Pragmatism and Naturalism. The literature discussed below is the work of two members of the Department of Foreign Philosophy at Moscow State University, A. M. Karimsky and N. E. Pokrovsky. Both of these scholars are interested in and have published articles on the whole range of American philo- sophy, and each has contributed significantly to the literature on early American thought. Karimsky *s major work in the area of the early development of American thought, The Revolution of 1776 and the Founding of American Philosophy, is a detailed study of the American Enlightenment, its general philosophic underpinnings and social and political implications, as well as its break from the earlier Puritan tradition. 3 Some of the same material is considered in his article "The Problem of Man in 'The Declaration of Independence* and the Contemporary Ideological Struggle in the USA," published in 1976 in honor of the 200th anniversary of the American Revolution/ Po- krovsky has discussed some of the philosophic issues which informed the debates among the Founders in his article "Jefferson and the Federalists: A Conflict of Philosophic Views. "^ His most important work, however, is his recently published Henry Thoreau, the first book length study of Thoreau by a Soviet philosopher.^ These four works are by no means exhaustive of Soviet commentary on the</page><page sequence="2">66 John Ryder early traditions of American thought, but they are sufficiently repre- sentative of the spirit and character of the inquiry conducted by Soviet commentators to serve as the focus of this review. The discussion will proceed along roughly chronological lines, beginning with Karim- sky's analysis of Puritanism, his and Pokrovsky 's remarks on the Amer- ican Enlightenment and the Revolutionary period, and ending with Pokrovsky *s commentary on Thoreau and Transcendentalism. Before moving on to more detailed considerations, however, a few general introductory remarks are in order. One of the most striking features of both Karimsky's and Pokrovsky's analyses is the obviously high regard in which the authors hold their subject matter. Karimsky, for example, emphasizes the various ways in which the American Enlightenment contributed original and important insights in the general area of Natural Philosophy. The American Enlightenment, he says, "elaborated rather detailed and in many ways original theories of matter, motion and nature" (Rev 123). With respect to the the- oretical and practical aspects of the problem of human freedom, Ka- rimsky has this to say: The understanding of human freedom developed by Ameri- can thinkers was in the mainstream of the best traditions of bourgeois philosophy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It presupposed the overcoming of external con- straints, as well as the tying of needs and ideals to adequate means for their satisfaction and realization ... to this tra- ditional understanding of freedom the Americans were able to add a new meaning, that it applied to all people. To the credit of the Americans, they tried to construct a democratic program for the practical realization of human freedom. (Rev 186-87) Pokrovsky expresses a similar admiration for Thoreau, seeing in his work a profoundly democratic and humanistic strain. "Under all the complexities and contradiction of Thoreau's social-philosophic world views," Pokrovsky remarks, "his dominant tendency, declaring itself at every turn, turns out to be a democratic one" (GT 167).</page><page sequence="3">Soviet Studies in American Thought 67 The respect these commentators have for certain figures and strains in early American thought, and the sympathy evident in their inter- pretations, is important to bear in mind, though of course it must be taken in the appropriate context. On the one hand, the fact that such admiration is so characteristic of these scholarly commentaries indicates that it would be a travesty if one were to interpret Soviet scholarship as a mechanical critique of bourgeois thought. On the other hand, the sympathetic attitude expressed in the remarks just cited is not absolute. Both authors are Marxists, and given the general philosophic com- ponents of dialectical materialism, we can expect them to reject both the mechanistic world view of the Enlightenment as well as the ro- manticism and idealism of American Transcendentalism. But the same principles of dialectical materialism should also dispel any inclination a scholar might have to treat a philosophic movement as a monlithic phenomenon reducible to a simple set of propositions which might then be easily embraced or rejected. The complex constitution of philosophic movements and traditions demands of a commentator that he be sensitive to many strains, some of which he may judge to be admirable and noteworthy, while others he may be more inclined to reject. One of the more interesting aspects of recent Soviet scholar- ship in the area of early American philosophy has to do with the judgments it is inclined to make concerning what is of value and what is not in the traditions under consideration. Understanding where these lines are drawn, and why, is important not only for a more careful appreciation of Soviet views of the American intellectual heritage, but it also contributes to a clearer sense of how Soviet think- ers see themselves, their society and their aspirations. This essay is in part an attempt to clarify some of those judgments and the reasons for them. i In his major work on the American revolution and the origins of American philosophy, Karimsky is interested primarily in the develop- ment of Enlightenment thought and the ongoing struggle between materialism and idealism carried on within that context. Despite this fundamental theme, the author begins his study with a consideration</page><page sequence="4">68 John Ryder of the foundations of Puritan thought. There are two reasons for the consideration of Puritanism. The first is that the Enlightenment itself is much more clearly understood against the background out of which it arose and in reaction to which it developed. The second is an overtly ideological consideration. Karimsky notes that in the late 1960's and early 1970's there was an upsurge in interest in early American thought on the part of social historians and historians of American philosophy. One of the trends expressed in some of this literature is the inclination to interpret Puritanism as one of the more important influences on eighteenth century revolutionary thought in the colonies.7 Karimsky regards this interpretation of the historic role of Puritanism to be a mistake, as will be made clear shortly. His concern, however, is not merely a theoretical one. He suggests that the current temptation among bourgeois historians to see in Puritanism the foundations of American social and political thought is actually a way of dismissing what was in fact genuinely revolutionary about the Enlightenment and its social and political implications. The ide- ological agenda associated with this, he suggests, is an attempt to dis- credit modern revolutionary thought, which has many of its roots in the same general philosophic conceptions which grounded the American revolutionary period: . . . the attempt by bourgeois ideologists to represent the sources of the American democratic tradition not in the Enlightenment, but in Puritan ideology, and the attempt to minimize and distort the role of materialist philosophy, democratic ideas, and revolutionary thought are forms of the struggle against contemporary independent thought and materialism, in particular the discrediting of current demo- cratic thought, which is the legacy of the revolutionary spirit of 1776. (Rev 5-6) This is a theme which runs not only through Karimsky *s detailed study of Puritanism and the Enlightenment, but also underlies his article on the Declaration of Independence. In general, Karimsky re- gards the U.S. as having abandoned the principles and philosophic</page><page sequence="5">Soviet Studies in American Thought 69 foundations of its own revolutionary origins, and consequently ide- ological spokesmen for contemporary society and ideas in the U. S. find themselves in the uncomfortable but necessary position on hav- in to distance themselves from the very ideas which ground their own history.8 The rejection of the principles of the Declaration, he says, "testifies to the fact that the social system in the U. S. constantly violates rather than fulfills, or is incapable of carrying out, those principles on which its very formation was based" (PCH 58). These considerations anticipate the direct discussion of Karimsky *s treatment of the Declaration and the Enlightenment in general, but it is im- portant to bear them in mind as the background of the analysis of Puritanism. For Karimsky, the two most significant aspects of Puritan theory are its conception of freedom and the theory of the covenant. Both appear to be susceptible to an interpretation which would treat them as consistent with Enlightenment ideas of human nature and social relations. In so far as Puritanism was born as a reaction to religious orthodoxy, and the Puritan migrations to the New World were a flight from religious persecution, it appears plausible to see in Puritanism's development the germs of later, more fully developed conceptions of religious tolerance, freedom of thought and human freedom generally. Karimsky points out, however, that the Puritans' flight from perse- cution did not constitute an endorsement of religious and intellectual freedom. Rather, the Puritans were in search of conditions which would make possible their own brand of religious and intellectual in- tolerance. The treatment by the Puritan oligarchy of the religious dissidents, from Quakers and Anabaptists to Roger Williams and Anne Huchinson, indicates a conception of freedom not at all consistent with the ideas of freedom of conscience characteristic of much of the Enlightenment. From Karimsky 's point of view it is the theocratic character of Puritan ideas, in particular the conceptions of human freedom and covenant theory, which clearly distinguished them from the phi- losophic foundations of the revolutionary period. On the question of freedom, Karimsky cites John Winthrop's thesis that there are two kinds of freedom: natural and moral. Natural freedom man shares</page><page sequence="6">70 John Ryder with the animals, and means little more than the ability to move and act more or less as one wills. Moral freedom, however, is peculiar to man, and constitutes the limits on the exercise of natural freedom. Since moral freedom is understood in accordance with scripture and divine law, it underscores a distinctively Puritan conception of human nature. Before the Fall, Adam and Eve were free in the sense that for them natural and moral freedom coincided. With the introduction of sin, however, moral freedom becomes the observance of moral law, which in turn implies that natural freedom means nothing but the ability to sin, and is consequently an instrument of evil. Karimsky clearly invites us to contrast such a view of natural freedom with the concept of natural rights characteristic of eighteenth century American thought. The two, he suggests, have very little to do with one another. The aspect of Puritan theory which appears to be closest to later philosophic developments is the theory of the covenant, and it is the one which Karimsky considers in greatest detail. He cites Schneider as among the most prominent of the American commentators who see covenant theory as an ecclesiastical version of social contract theory, and who consequently suggest, in Karimsky *s paraphrase, that "the relation between Puritanism and the Enlightenment is so close that the development of the former into the latter was easy, and for the most part unconscious" (Rev 44). Karimsky goes on to point out that this amounts to saying that Puritan social philosophy contains within itself the prin- ciples which the tradition attributes to the Enlightenment . . . and that these same principles are at the foundation of the program of the American Revolution . . . The puritan covenant has been understood as the source of the theory of natural rights, and even as anticipating the realization of such rights in the constituting acts of the American Revolu- tion. (Rev 44-48) Karimsky argues that such an understanding of the theory of the covenant is without sufficient justification. His objection rests on the</page><page sequence="7">Soviet Studies in American Thought 71 point that there is a fundamental difference between covenant and social contract theories, specifically that while the latter implies an agreement among people (men, for the most part), the former is never reducible to such an agreement. The power and authority possessed by a social contract is derived from the mutual agreement of the parties to it, while the authority of a covenant is a result of the signa- tories having individually made a compact with God. Karimsky refers to Cotton Mather as having mentioned three aspects of the covenant, all of which consist of agreements with God. Karimsky goes on to argue that in fact the Puritan Covenant has nothing whatever to do with any sort of natural rights concept required for social contract theory, but rather has its source in the Bible. Such compacts with God were common among the ancient Jews, and he suggests that the historical and ethnographic evidence indicates that agreements of this kind, where the authority of the agreement derives from God, were equally common among ancient Africans, Asians and Germans. Thus the theoretical basis of covenant theory is related to ancient religious conceptions rather than those of the Enlightenment. Not only have American commentators such as Schneider, Ralph Barton Perry and others seen a close relation between Puritan and Enlightenment ideas, but some, Perry Miller for example, have gone so far as to suggest that the revolutionary ideas of the social contract, inalienable rights and the right to revolution would not have become as widespread as they did were it not for their endorsement by Puritan clergy. But this, Karimsky argues, is a distortion. The dissemination of revolutionary ideas did indeed depend on clergy, but it was not the orthodox Puritan clergy who took up the call. Rather it was the dissidents among the clergy, specifically Hooker, Williams, Wise and Mayhew who were the bridge between the era of orthodox Puritanism and the revolutionary epoch of the second half of the eighteenth century. It was Williams, Karimsky points out, who supplanted cove- nantism with a theory of natural rights, who repudiated the divine origin of government, who held the idea of inalienable rights, and who argued strongly for freedom of conscience. And it was Wise who attempted a synthesis of the principle of natural rights with religious beliefs, who argued for democratic forms of political organization,</page><page sequence="8">72 John Ryder and who was a precursor of Enlightenment Deism. Thus it was the rebellious clergy, and not orthodox Puritans, who helped pave the way for the Enlightenment. Indeed the vast influence of Enlightenment and revolutionary ideas was possible only to the extent that the in- fluence of Puritanism waned. Karimsky is careful to note that this process did not occur without a struggle. One aspect of the struggle was the Great Awakening, which he sees as an inherently contradictory event. "On the one hand, the Great Awakening was characterized by the activation of the demo- cratically minded clergy, by a mass expression against intolerance, and by radical social and political demands. On the other hand, it was an intensification of the struggle against the deistic, secular world view" (Rev 57). A second aspect of the struggle was the influence of philosophic idealism, particularly in the persons of Samuel Johnson and Jonathan Edwards. "Johnson's and Edwards' idealism," Karimsky suggests, "arose as a reactionary defense of conservatism against the influence of materialism and deism" (Rev 67). Johnson, of course, was concerned to defend Anglicanism, and Edwards, despite his gen- uine interest in the philosophic currents of his day, in particular the influence of Newton and Locke, was interested in an essentially con- servative defense of an antidemocratic political and religious world view. In the short run at least, the conservative trend expressed in Edwards and Johnson was eclipsed by the growing influence of the Enlightenment. ii The general world view of the Enlightenment involved philosophic and social conceptions distinctly different from those of orthodox Puritanism. Despite the superficial similarity of the concepts of pre- destination and mechanical determinism, for example, the former presupposes the arbitrary will and ubiquitous power of God, while the latter embodies a much more naturalistic view of the laws and principles which govern material and social relations and processes. This fundamental distinction is reflected in the various social and po- litical views which distinguished the two strains of thought - oli- garchy vs. democracy, the appropriate relation of church and state,</page><page sequence="9">Soviet Studies in American Thought 73 the fundamental characteristics of human nature, the ultimate sources of political power, and the ground of natural and civil rights. In each case, the views advanced by the representatives of the Enlightenment tended to dominate the philosophic, social and political scene in the years preceding, during, and immediately following the revolution. 9 The political crisis in the colonies and the impending revolution so dominated the intellectual atmosphere in America that it is impossible to evaluate philosophic developments without tying them directly to social and political affairs. How one interprets the revolution itself in turn influences how one understands developments associated with more strictly philosophic concerns. Pokrovsky suggests that the fact that the important American philosophers of this period were so intimately involved in the pressing social and political affairs of the time in part explains why subsequent historians of philosophy have tended to pay them such scant attention. While it is probably true that most of the major philosophic figures in the West in the eighteenth century were either actors in or at least influenced by the social up- heaval of their time, from Locke's participation in the Glorious Rev- olution to Kant's admiration for the French Revolution, the fact that the important American thinkers played a leading role in social movements inclines us to distance them from the philosophic main- stream represented by Locke, Rousseau, Hume and Kant. But this close association of theoretical and practical matters is, from Pokrov- sky's point of view, one of the primary virtues of American Englighten- ment thought. He remarks that American philosophy in this period, with human concerns as its basic problem, "demonstrates once more the truth that philosophy is not merely a theoretical exercise of the intellect, but provides people with concrete answers to the sharp problems of real life" (DF 289). The American revolution was, Karimsky says, a class war, in which the bourgeois class rid itself of the vestiges of feudalism inherent in the British Colonial system. The propertied class, however, while a large enough portion of it may have desired independence from Eng- land, did not represent a single set of compatible interests. Conse- quently, though representatives of the class were united in support of the revolution, they differed considerably among themselves over</page><page sequence="10">74 John Ryder the question of the appropriate social and political alternative to British rule. Both Karimsky and Pokrovsky emphasize these differ- ences, and for both, the details of the disagreements and debates be- tween the two major revolutionary factions are central to their inter- pretations of the revolution itself and of the philosophic spirit and views which informed it. Though the specific differences between the Jeffersonian radicals and the Federalist moderates were many, Ka- rimsky and Pokrovsky both take the former to have been urging a rather thoroughgoing revision of social relations, while the latter endorsed a much more limited vision of social change. The radical program of the Jeffersonians required, Karimsky points out, a philo- sophic elaboration and foundation which was equally radical. By the same token, since the Federalists defended a far less ambitious pro- ject, their general philosophic conception tended to be fairly con- sistent with those which grounded the interests of the very groups against which the revolution was fought. The Federalists, for example, though they endorsed the modified version of Jefferson's Declaration, in the long run advanced a view of human nature which coincided with the pessimistic conception Hobbes had employed in his defense of absolute monarchy. The radicals, on the. other hand, defended a much more optimistic view of human nature and the possibilities of social equality which rested to a large degree on a fairly thorough- going materialism and deism. As Karimsky puts it, "Despite the view among bourgeois historical and philosophical schools that ma- terialism was not widespread in American philosophy in the eigh- teenth century, it was actually dominant, and it guaranteed a pro- ductive world view and a methodological basis for the development of social, philosophic and scientific thought" (Rev 115). From Kar- imsky's point of view, and Pokrovsky's as well, while the "moderate" Federalists may have prevailed in the long run, the genuinely revolu- tionary character of the period was expressed by the Jeffersonians, not only in their social and political views but in their more general phi- losophic ideas as well. The emphasis on the fundamental incompatibility of the Jeffersonian and Federalist views is a central aspect of the commentaries under con- sideration here. Both Karimsky and Pokrovsky claim that the tendency on the part of contemporary American historians to emphasize and</page><page sequence="11">Soviet Studies in American Thought 7 5 expound the Federalist position is an attempt to discredit the more radical and revolutionary ideas of the Jeffersonians. Pokrovsky puts it this way: The growth of interest in early American philosophy which developed in the 1970's was in part a neoconservative ideo- logical tide, on the crest of which the Federalists were ele- vated to an extraordinarily high and undeserved authority, and naturally there was a sharp and undeserved disparage- ment of the authority of Jefferson, whom all of the in- creasingly neoconservative historians, either directly or indirectly and with a faint note of disdain, identified with groundless utopianism and a deliberately insincere demo- cratism. . . (DF 276) In the same vein, on Karimsky's view the principles expressed in Jef- ferson's Declaration, and the general philosophic views of the radical Jeffersonian faction, were forerunners of contemporary social and ideological struggles, and the real legacy of 1776 is in the struggle for "social progress and socialism, for the defense of the freedoms pro- claimed in the American revolution" (PCH 61). This general per- spective helps to explain the authors' sympathy with the social op- timism and materialism of the radical faction of the Enlightenment. Of particular interest are the radicals' views on human nature and the nature of society, and their developments in materialist thought and the natural sciences. The differences between the Federalist and Jeffersonian views of social and political questions reflect differing conceptions of human nature as well as somewhat divergent class interests. Though Jeffer- son is often characterized as a representative of "agrarian democracy," Karimsky suggests it is more appropriate to see him as articulating the interests of both small and middle level farmers against the in- terests, represented more or less directly by the Federalists, of the landed aristocracy and finance, commercial and industrial capital. On the philosophical level, Jefferson and those in his general circle held a relatively flattering and optimistic view of human nature, in</page><page sequence="12">76 John Ryder contrast to the more Hobbesian conception advanced by the staunch Federalists such as Hamilton and Adams, and even by the more mo- derate and flexible members of the Federalist camp, notably Madison. Karimsky and Pokrovsky both emphasize Jefferson's view of "moral sentiments" as a significant factor in determining his conception of democratic social organization. Pokrovsky argues that a Jeffersonian theory of moral sentiments is the foundation of the belief in the natural equality of people, in natural rights, and in the possibility of democracy. Since all people equally possess the moral sense of justice and injustice, it follows that all people are by nature morally equal. Since there is no "natural moral aristocracy," Jefferson in- ferred that no individual or class is morally superior to any others, and thus the rights possessed by some are necessarily possessed by all. Furthermore, Pokrovsky points out that Jefferson sees the moral sense as largely social in nature, suggesting that an altruism and bene- volence toward the members of one's community are the ethical foundations of human being. The evidence for this reading of Jef- ferson's view of the moral sense is in a letter to Thomas Law, written in 1814, in which he discusses his views on the subject. In a passage criticizing Helvetius' view that individual self-interest is the funda- mental motivating force of morality, Jefferson remarks that "nature hath implanted in our breasts a love of others, a sense of duty to them, a moral instinct, in short, which prompts us irresistibly to feel and to succor their distresses. ..." While Karimsky and Pokrovsky agree that Jefferson's theory of moral sentiments or instincts is fundamentally important, they appear to disagree about just how he understood the character of the moral sense. Pokrovsky sees Jefferson as holding a view of innate moral ideas, gravitating, as he puts it, toward the views of the Scottish In- tuitionists Shaftsbury and Hutcheson. Karimsky, on the other hand, argues that Jefferson did not take the moral instincts to be a set of innate ideas. There is at least prima facie evidence for each of these views. In the same letter to Thomas Law, Jefferson says that the evidence "shows how necessary was the care of the Creator in making the moral principle so much a part of our constitution as that no errors of reasoning or of speculation might lead us astray from its</page><page sequence="13">Soviet Studies in American Thought 77 observance in practice." If people are endowed with moral principles specific enough to be observed in practice, it would appear that such principles are indeed innate ideas. But such a view, Karimsky suggests, is inconsistent both with remarks made later in the same letter, and also with positions expressed by others with whom Jefferson was in general philosophic agreement. Karimsky cites the following passage from the letter to Law in which Jefferson attempts to account for the fact that in different times and places, different ethical principles have prevailed: The answer is, that nature has constituted utility to man, the standard and test of virtue. Men living in different countries, under different circumstances, different habits and regimens, may have different utilities; the same act, therefore, may be useful, and consequently virtuous in one country which is injurious and vicious in another differently circumstanced. A remark such as this seems to indicate that the moral senses is not a set of innate ideas, but rather describes a potentiality, one which is actualized or not, and in this or that way, by different people in dif- ferent times and places. This understanding of Jefferson's position makes it easier, Karimsky says, to reconcile Jefferson's views with those of others among the radicals. He mentions Benjamin Rush as having criticized the "antinaturalist" interpretation of the moral sense offered by Shaftsbury and Hutcheson, suggesting that the moral sense is an acquired trait. Thomas Cooper, Karimsky points out, held that the concept of innate ideas contradicted the principles of science. Jefferson's close philosophic association with these and other col- leagues, and his inclination to share their general materialist sensual- ism, makes it likely that he would have been disinclined to endorse the concept of innate ideas, especially with respect to a matter as important as the moral sense. The differing readings of Jefferson's idea of the moral sense are reflected in Pokrovsky's and Karimsky 's respective treatments of the implications of this facet of human nature for Jefferson's social</page><page sequence="14">78 John Ryder and political ideas. Pokrovsky suggests that for Jefferson the innate character of the moral sense is an indication that the fundamental traits of human beings are eternal, which in turn explains Jefferson's deep interest in classical thought and culture. Furthermore, from his view of the moral sense as eternal and fundamentally altruistic and social, Jefferson derives a conception of history as a progressive strug- gle against tyranny. Thus he emphasizes the study of history as an important method for understanding the possibilities of contemporary and future action. Karimsky, in turn, suggests that Jefferson's views concerning social and political affairs are the result of his more or less "naturalistic" conception of human nature. If the moral sense is indeed a potentiality, and can be more precisely determined by social conditions, then, certain social and political conditions are more conducive to human social development than others, and any number of such conditions are possible. The view of the moral sense as a potentiality also accounts for the emphasis Jefferson placed on education. For people to actualize their sociability and inclination for community life, the potential must be actively and systematically encouraged and developed. Universal education is ideally suited for such a task. All of this must be contrasted with the Federalist positions. Ka- rimsky refers to the Federalist views of human nature and society as a direct revision of the Enlightenment philosophy, and as a secular variant of the Puritan view of the innate depravity of human beings. The specific expressions of this general position vary, but they range from Hamilton's well known contempt for common people, to John Adams' inclination to agree with Jefferson about the existence of a moral sense (though accompanied by his suspicion that in social life it degenerates into vanity, jealousy and competition) to Madison's endorsement of the egoistic conception of human motivation. The Federalist emphasis on aggression, hostility, self-aggrandizement and competition leads directly to conceptions of social inequality and the need for a political order strong enough to keep people's destructive inclinations in check. These positions also imply a very different reading of history than the progressive view characteristic of the Jef- fersonian circle. Pokrovsky refers to Hamilton's view, based on certain</page><page sequence="15">Soviet Studies in American Thought 79 conceptions of Hume, that under any form of political organization people will seek their individual self-interest. Thus history is little more than a brutal struggle among egoists for influence and power. From Hamilton's point of view, the eighteenth century provided the conditions for this rise to power of finance and commercial capital. In their contrast of the Enlightenment radicals with the Federalists, Pokrovsky and Karimsky both go on to discuss their respective views of property, government, and religion. Both point out that for Jef- ferson, and the radicals generally, private property was not a natural right, but rather a secondary one which arises within civil society. The significance of property for Jefferson was that on his view property was a guarantor of the inviolability of the individual and a necessary condition for the fulfillment of natural rights. Thus the importance of property is as a means, not an end in itself. This explains why Jef- ferson proposed, though he knew it was not feasible, that property be distributed in a more or less egalitarian way to the whole of the population. The understanding of property as a means also explains why Jefferson and others, Franklin and Paine among them, expressed concern over the relation of property to power, and on various oc- casions expressed an interest in seeing limits placed on the accumula- tion of property. That Jefferson took this view is made clear in a letter to James Madison sent from France in 1785, in which he calls for legislative measures for "subdividing property" and for a pro- gressive income tax as "another means of silently lessening the in- equality of property. " He goes on to suggest that unlimited property accumulation may well lead to the violation of others' rights: "When- ever there is in any country, uncultured lands and unemployed poor, it is clear that the laws of property have been so far extended as to violate natural right." Natural rights for the Jeffersonians did not include property, and their conception of natural rights influenced the radicals' view of the source and role of government. Political structures, in so far as they exist by the consent of the governed, are grounded in a social contract, and have as their primary function the protection of natural rights. These views not only conflicted with those of the Federalists, but generated theoretical difficulties for the radical position itself.</page><page sequence="16">80 John Ryder Karimsky suggests that the inherent problem in understanding govern- ment's role as the guarantor of natural rights is that the social con- tract necessary to achieve that end requires that the parties to the contract sacrifice their rights to one degree or another. Karimsky here points to the interminable political problem of determining when the means to secure rights have gone so far that they effect the op- posite end. Another problem concerns the question of who the ap- propriate parties to the social contract are. The answer to this ques- tion, Karimsky suggests, in part characterizes the differences between the Jeffersonians and the Federalists. While the radicals, on the basis of their belief in the moral equality of people, viewed the social con- tract as an agreement among the governed, the Federalists, with their deep distrust of the masses and their consequent commitment to social inequality, were more inclined to understand the contract as an agree- ment between the governed and those whose destiny it was to govern them. One of the most fundamental disagreements the Federalists had with the Jeffersonians concerned the status of property. On the whole, the Federalists regarded property as a natural right, a view which had a number of significant implications. Since it is the govern- ment's role to protect natural rights, the protection of property is one of the most important functions of government. Furthermore, as a natural right, property is immune from interference, and its un- limited accumulation, following Locke, is itself an inherent right. Though neither Karimsky nor Pokrovsky put the point in this way, the Federalists essentially represented the position of economic li- beralism in the spirit of Adam Smith, in contrast to both the mer- cantilist policies pursued by the British Parliament and the more or less physiocratic views of the Jeffersonian camp. Still another impli- cation of taking property as a natural right was the Federalist view that those who owned property in significant amounts should be the people in whom political power is concentrated. When this idea was combined with the common Federalist belief in a natural aristocracy, the result was the view that those who controlled the purse strings should run the society because they were inherently most fit to do so and because they were the only citizens who could be trusted to defend the natural right to prpoerty.</page><page sequence="17">Soviet Studies in American Thought 81 This general conception of the nature and function of government and of the appropriate people to wield its power is the same one embodied in the U. S. Constitution and the famous apologetic for that document, the Federalist Papers. The Federalists in general were in favor of a strong central government which could have the teeth necessary to defend citizens' rights, and what concerned them most was the tenuousness of that one natural right which was actu- alized for only a minority of the population - the right to property. In his famous 10th Federalist Paper, Madison says that "the most common and durable source of faction is the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society." The faction Madison and the Federalists were most disturbed by was the majority faction of those citizens who did not hold property. Given the Fe- deralists' egoistic conception of human nature, they took it for granted that the majority, if it had the opportunity, would violate the minor- ity's property rights. Thus the government and the nation as a whole must be so structured as to prevent such a misfortune. It must be able, as Madison put it, to prevent "a rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project. ..." Madison argued that the Constitu- tion provided for just such a bulwark against the majority's inclina- tion to pursue its interests. Karimsky points out that there were differences among the Federalists as to the political implications of this threat from the majority. The fact that some distrusted demo- cracy altogether was a consequence of the belief that democratic po- litical forms would not be able to defend the natural rights of the minority. Madison did not hold this view, since he believed that there were enough other differences among people to render it less likely that they would ever be able to organize sufficiently to effect their will. This is precisely what Madison was trying to convince his colleagues of in the 10th Federalist Paper. The other specific difference emphasized by both Pokrovsky and Karimsky concerns the general question of freedom of religion and conscience. On the whole, the Federalists were much less interested in pursuing these issues than were the Jeffersonians. The primary</page><page sequence="18">82 John Ryder reason for this is that freedom of conscience and religious expression are significant components of a democratic society. Since the Jef- fersonian radicals were far more deeply committed to a wider ranging democracy than were the Federalists, they were correspondingly insistent on the importance of the freedom of religious thought. The dominant views among the Jeffersonians were expressed in Jefferson's own Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom. Pokrovsky argues that while Jefferson's Bill was an important progressive document, it suffers from limitations imposed by the author's own time and place. He cites another Soviet author, N. Goldberg, who suggested that Despite the progressive character of Jefferson's Bill, it bears bourgeois limitation. While professing freedom of inquiry and freedom of thought, it was not genuine freedom of conscience, which must include the recognition not only of the right to profess any religion, but also the right not to believe in God, the right to be an atheist and profess athe- ism. (DF 87) It is not at all clear that Goldberg and Pokrovsky are right about this. While there is no question that Jefferson himself did not embrace atheism, and that the argument he offers in favor of religious freedom is itself framed in theistic or at least deistic language, the Bill does not explicitly preclude atheism. The relevant passage says that "no man . . . shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion. ..." Karimsky emphasizes the diversity of religious views among the radicals. Jefferson and Franklin were representatives of deism, with its rejection of orthodox conceptions of God and its inclination to understand religion in largely ethical terms. Jefferson's understand- ing of Jesus as essentially a great moral teacher and Franklin's notion of religion as a means to a moral end both illustrate this tendency. Others, however, were more openly hostile to organized religion and to religious ideas in general. Paine, Karimsky says, referred to the</page><page sequence="19">Soviet Studies in American Thought 83 Bible as a "fraud and a forgery," and criticized organized religion as a socially and politically reactionary force. Cooper, he suggests, even dared to advocate atheism. Nonetheless, he cautions, religious ideas in one form or another dominated the period, and religion itself was not widely taken to be a component of social reaction. Both patriots and loyalists, he reminds us, endorsed religious world views. The contrast with the Federalists is a matter of emphasis. Pokrovsky describes the Federalists as facing a dilemma with respect to the ques- tion of religious freedom. Their choices were either actively to en- courage freedom of conscience or to reject it. If they chose the former, they would have been in a position of encouraging democracy, and they would have had to grant some degree of natural equality among the populace. On the other hand, had they actively rejected freedom of conscience they would have been committed to a clericalism which would have been equally inconsistent with their general social re- quirements. Thus, Pokrovsky suggests, their only choice was virtually to ignore the question. A notable exception came, not surprisingly, from Madison, who assumes the freedom of religious belief in his remarks in Federalist 52. But Pokrovsky remarks that the Federalists' disinclination to deal in any detailed way with the question of freedom of conscience is illustrated by the fact that the Federalist Papers con- tain no sustained analyses of the question. And on the question of religious views themselves, Pokrovsky argues that the Federalists rejected even the least radical views of the deists: "It would not be an exaggeration to say that the very thought of atheism, as well as deism, appeared to the Federalists as a hostile influence of France and French free-thinking" (DF 288). Karimsky treats the phenomenon of deism as closely tied to the general philosophic materialism of the representatives of the Enlighten- ment. Eighteenth century materialism is, on his view, one of the most important revolutionary aspects of the period. In one respect it was a reaction against the general theological and philosophical presumptions of the more orthodox religious world views which repre- sented essentially reactionary ideas concerning human nature and society. Materialism, Karimsky argues, was a progressive development in that it contributed, in ways which many more orthodox idealisms</page><page sequence="20">84 John Ryder could not, to the view that the world and its principles are knowable. Such knowledge, however, had a "pragmatic" significance, which is to say that knowledge of the world was important as a necessary con- dition for improving it. The philosophic materialism of the Enlighten- ment, then, embodied a conception of the world as "workable," and this in turn implied that both society and human nature itself, given sufficient understanding, could be improved immeasurably. Despite its progressive character and implications, however, Enlightenment materialism was inherently limited in scope and explanatory power, Karimsky argues, in that its mechanistic character made it incapable of generating a sufficient understanding of much of the world, in particular of animate nature. It was materialism's mechanistic prin- ciples, he thinks, which explain the widespread popularity of deism among the more prominent representatives of the radical and ma- terialist faction. From Karimsky 's point of view, deism is a relatively unimportant component of the radicals' set of philosophic conceptions, and its influence is greatly overshadowed by their materialism. God was in- voked by the deists, in a strategy common to many religious traditions, as an explanatory device. The Newtonian world, as Newton himself thought, did not contain the principles of its own generation. Paley's watch required a watch maker, and the Enlightenment materialists, with some possible exceptions, were among the many intellectuals of that time who regarded the argument from design as conclusive. Fur- thermore, it was widely held that the principles of natural and social philosophy were incapable of providing an account of value and mean- ing, thus these most important aspects of human life must have another explanation. In the long run, however, such ideas were of only minor significance: "Deism is inherently contradictory and therefore the- oretically unstable. It found it necessary to appeal to God, but since God loses its anthropomorphic and supernatural traits, it is reduced to a convention, and matter becomes the eternal principle" (Rev 115). Deism and materialism went hand in hand, with the latter being the more important theoretical phenomenon. Karimsky, in his two chapters devoted to materialism and science, emphasizes the work and influence of Franklin, Jefferson, Benjamin</page><page sequence="21">Soviet Studies in American Thought 85 Rush, Ethan Allen, Priestly, Cadwallader Colden and Thomas Cooper. One of the earliest indications of a break from religious orthodoxy was Franklin's 1725 "Dissertation." Karimsky suggests that "The 'Dis- sertation,' despite its immaturity, is a fundamental episode in the history of American philosophy" because it attempted to articulate a view of the world based on rational principle more than on religious dogma. One example of this is Franklin's contention in that work that principles in nature are such that all suffering is ultimately ba- lanced by pleasure. Franklin rejected the ideas of the "Dissertation" before long, and in so doing moved toward a more mature and tho- roughgoing materialism. He applied materialist principles to mind and to God, for example. Franklin never embraced atheism, but he held that God was material, since an immaterial God would be a vi- olation of the general principle that "nothing comes from nothing." Jefferson, Karimsky points out, held many of the same views. He thought that God, and indeed anything at all, must be material. Late in their lives, John Adams wrote a letter to Jefferson in which Adams advanced a number of idealist views. In his letter of August, 1820, Jefferson responded unequivocally: On the basis of sensation, of matter and motion, we may erect the fabric of all the certainties we can have or need. I can conceive thought to be an action of a particular or- ganization of matter ... To talk of immaterial existences, is to talk of nothing. To say that the human soul, angels, God, are immaterial, is to say, they are nothings, or that there is no God, no angels, no soul. Some of the Enlightenment materialists went further still. Ethan Allen, for example, held that matter was inherently active and was eternal, thus expressing a position which was for all practical pur- poses free of deism. Cadwallader Colden elaborated rather detailed theories of matter, motion and nature which, like Allen's, took matter to be both active and eternal. Karimsky points out that Colden's ex- plicit responses to Berkeley's idealism rested on a criticism of the lat- ter's conception of matter as passive. And while most materialists</page><page sequence="22">86 John Ryder thought that their principles could not account for life, Thomas Coop- er, in his commentary on Priestly, granted the possibility of the self- generation of life, though he cautioned that it seemed to him impos- sible to demonstrate. The importance of Enlightenment materialism is also evident in the developments in science in North America. Franklin's ground breaking work in electricity, i.e., his discovery of the conservation of electric charge and his fluid theory, the work of Rittenhouse and others in astronomy, light and mathematics, and Colden's study of gravity all represented fruits of essentially materialist philosophic underpinnings. Though scientific work was stimulated by the eco- nomic development of the colonies and its consequent technological demands, Karimsky suggests that materialism made the fruitful re- ults possible. Furthermore, the influence of science in the revolu- tionary period was related to a large degree to the general ideological struggle being carried on throughout colonial society. Science held its social importance as a result of the view that it expressed the mag- nificant power of human reason, and that it was a crucial means toward the realization of human happiness, itself one of the cornerstones of revolutionary theory. Science and philosophy were able to exert as much influence as they did, Karimsky suggests, because "In America there was not the sort of separation between concrete scientific re- search and philosophic thought which was already significant in Eu- rope. . . . This provided for the unity of philosophic materialism with scientific practice, which was unusually fruitful in methodo- logical, as well as in scientific and theoretical, respects" (Rev 176). Despite the genuinely revolutionary character of the radicals' ma- terialism and social and political ideas, or better because of their revolutionary character, a social and philosophic crisis developed with the victory over England, one which led to a period of reaction and a rather thorough revision of Enlightenment ideas. Karimsky de- scribes this crisis as in part a conflict between the Federalists and the radicals over the depth to which revolutionary change should be carried. As he puts it, by the mid-1 780 *s the Federalists regarded the revolution as essentially complete, while the radicals held that "without the elimination of slavery, the introduction of wider edu-</page><page sequence="23">Soviet Studies in American Thought 87 cational opportunities, and the full secularization of the government and the schools, the tasks of the revolution would not be fulfilled" (Rev 252). He cites Rush from a letter dated May, 1787, in which he says "we have completed only the first act of a great drama." When this conflict is combined with what Karimsky calls a "growing dis- content among the lower social strata," including both the wage la- borers in the cities and the small farmers of New England, Pennsyl- vania and elsewhere, the seriousness of the crisis becomes evident. The result of this crisis was, on Karimsky &gt;s view, that the American revolution, though "one of the most successful of the bourgeois re- volutions . . . could not realize its own fundamental principle - the equality of social, political and legal rights" (Rev 256-257). The fact that the revolution did not achieve full equality of rights for working people, women, slaves and others is evidence of its inherent limits. Karimsky offers two reasons that the Enlightenment was unable to realize its "timid egalitarianism." The first is that the Jeffersonian faction never understood the importance of industrialization in the process of historical development and the necessary concentration of capital which accompanied it. Though Jeffereson and others were well aware of the dangers the concentration of capital posed for natural rights, they seemed not to appreciate how central a factor it must be in the course of economic development. This was an oversight of which the Federalists were not guilty. The second factor in the failure of egalitarianism was that the radicals did not understand the inherent class nature of government: "Many sincere democrats saw its role as a constitutional guarantee of justice, and they underestimated the significance of economic inequality" (Rev 258). Eventually, the general reaction against the Enlightenment extended to a rejection of its materialism and deism. The final years of the 18th century and the first decades of the 19th saw a resurgence of religion, revival- ism, and philosophic idealism. Just as the revolutionary ideas of the Enlightenment were a threat to the earlier colonial status quo, they were equally dangerous to the new bourgeois democracy which took its place. This fact explains, Karimsky suggests, both the reaction against the Enlightenment in the early decades of the republic as well as the current tendency to glorify the Federalists and overemphasize</page><page sequence="24">88 John Ryder the importance of Puritanism at the expense of the genuinely revo- lutionary views of the Enlightenment radicals. The philosophic foun- dations of the Jeffersonian circle are at the heart of the most note- worthy aspects of American culture, he says, and they are also "vital and genuine factors in the contemporary struggle for democracy and socialism." Just as the class components of the revolutionary move- ment of the 18th century made the realization of the radicals' program impossible, so the class structure of modern American society ob- structs its contemporary influence: "The limits of constitutional democracy indicate that the bourgeois order is incapable of fully realizing genuine equality - this task is achieved by the proletarian revolution" (Rev 286). iii In light of Karimsky's evaluation of post-revolutionary philosophic developments as largely a conservative reaction against the materialism and social radicalism of the Enlightenment, one might expect an interpretation of Transcendentalism and its more influential repre- sentatives as major components of that reaction. In many ways, such an interpretation would be entirely appropriate. Transcendentalism, especially in its more Emersonian strain, was indeed an idealist re- jection of and alternative to Enlightenment materialism., though in its own fashion it was also as much a rejection of orthodox religion as was deism. Pokrovsky Js analysis of Transcendentalism in general and of Thoreau in particular is, however, more sensitive and complex than this: "Appearing, on the one hand, as a successor to the democratic and humanistic traditions of the American Enlightenment, Transcendental- ism, on the other hand, waged an offensive against the materialistic tendencies of the philosophers of the Enlightenment" (GT 44-45). Throughout his commentary, Pokrovsky emphasizes those respects in which Thoreau expresses American "democratic and humanistic traditions." He recognizes that Thoreau 's work has been interpreted in a wide variety of ways and appropriated for a wide variety of pur- poses. Some, he says, have taken Thoreau as a symbol of the "national conscience," while others have focused on his peculiar brand of in- dividualism and anarchism. Nevertheless, Pokrovsky believes that</page><page sequence="25">Soviet Studies in American Thought 89 there is greater truth in those who see the progressive elements in his work than in those who deny it" (GT 6). Thoreau is unique among the Transcendentalists to the degree in which he distanced himself from the mainstream of the movement, if we regard the mainstream as represented by a more or less Emer- sonian idealism.10 Pokrovsky discusses the several respects in which Thoreau did not follow Emerson in the latter's full fledged Roman- ticism. With respect to both nature and man's relation to it, Thoreau avoided the nearly mystical view which Emerson represented. In their attempt to counterbalance what they perceived to be the sterile mechanism of the Enlightenment, the Romantics came to treat nature as largely symbolic of spirit. As Pokrovsky puts it, to describe nature, for Emerson, is to describe "individual consciousness in relation to the Absolute Idea, to the 'Over-Soul'" (GT 78-79). Nature as symbol is also characteristic of Thoreau 's views, but not to the same degree and in quite the same way. His symbolic understanding of nature is not primarily mystical, but inclines much more towards a natural- istic realism. Pokrovsky suggests that for Thoreau, "the material (physical) world is real, but it does not exist to the degree in which the metaphysical (transcendental) world exists." Despite this neo- Platonic ontological hierarchy, the material world as such retains its significance in that "it alone makes possible the relation with the gen- uine transcendental reality" (pp. 81-82). Such attempts to recon- cile transcendentalism and naturalism, Pokrovsky suggests, are fun- damental characteristics of Thoreau 's general idealism. Nature, for both Emerson and Thoreau, is largely meaningless and insignificant apart from man's relation to it. For Emerson, however, the material and ideal aspects of nature must be sharply distinguished, since nature is a medium for human knowledge only as ideal symbol. The material world in itself is an obstacle to man's knowledge and development. For Thoreau, as we have seen, the distinction is not quite as sharp. Scientific naturalism is indeed of value, but it follows rather than precedes the intuitive, spiritual meaning and significance of nature. Thoreau 's extension of the transcendentalist conception of nature, and the general tension in his work between realistic na- turalism and transcendentalism, are illustrated, on Pokrovsky's view,</page><page sequence="26">90 John Ryder by the various symbolic functions of the pond in Walden. He iden- tifies four meanings of Walden, the first of which is literal, which is to emphasize the significance of the pond itself in its objective tem- poral and spatial character. Second, Walden represents the general, aesthetic attributes of nature abstracted from any particular natural phenomenon. Third, the language Thoreau uses suggests an indirect sense of Walden as the individual soul - the "I", Fourth, Thoreau's discussion of the pond indicates its significance as a symbol of the transcendent sense of philosophic knowledge. On Thoreau's view, Pokrovsky argues, nature is significant in ma- terial, symbolic, ethical and aesthetic respects. He suggests, for ex- ample, that implicit in Thoreau 's ethical and aesthetic approach to nature are several important philosophic ideas: - Nature is not only objective reality, but also the source of ethical experience; - Nature demands a cautious and reverential attitude; the violation of its harmony has a pernicious effect on people's morals; - Nature tolerates only contemplative assimilation; man may neither subdue nor change nature, but only carefully "take root" in its system, becoming a silent, thoughtful observer of its harmonic order. (GT 126) Through his discussion of Thoreau *s complex view of nature, its mean- ing and significance, and its relation to human knowledge and develop- ment, Pokrovsky attempts to indicate the respects in which like the Romantics Thoreau rejects Enlightenment materialism, while unlike them he emphasizes the spiritual significance of material nature it- self. From Pokorvsky's point of view, however, all of this represents a fundamental and ultimately unresolved tension in Thoreau's philo- sophy. In fact, he interprets Thoreau's general philosophic views, from his understanding of nature to his social and political ideas, as char-</page><page sequence="27">Soviet Studies in American Thought 9 1 acterized by a series of paradoxical, if not contradictory, positions. The tension between the symbolic and literal significance of nature generates some of these paradoxical ideas. One of them is what Po- krovsky regards as the underlying contradiction of the romantic world view with respect to man's relation to nature. In so far as the appro- priate relation of nature to human life is one which permits only "contemplative assimilation," social and economic activity necessarily obscures and perverts nature's harmony and consequently man's relation to the absolute. On the other hand, since spiritual assimi- lation to nature is the condition of individual knowledge and spiritual development, it is precisely through bringing ourselves closer to nature that the problems of human interaction, of social life, can be resolved (GT 130). Thoreau expresses his sense of society's destructive influ- ence on the individual's relation to nature in the following suggestive passage from "Slavery in Massachusetts:" I walk toward one of our ponds; but what signifies the beauty of nature when men are base? We walk to lakes to see our serenity reflected in them; when we are not serene, we go not to them. Who can be serene in a country where both the rulers and the ruled are without principle? The remembrance of my country spoils my walk. My thoughts are murder to the State, and involuntarily go plotting against her. The therapeutic relation of nature to society, however, is expressed in the Walden experiment itself. Thoreau's time at the pond is often taken to be an escape, and to represent an overtly antisocial ideal. Pokrovsky suggests, however, that this is so "only in outward form." On the contrary, he thinks, the Walden experiment had a positive program, in that it "was above all an attempt to 'research' man, the laws of his spiritual growth, and the limits of his power over nature" (GT 156). Thoreau's purpose, on this view, was to understand him- self better precisely in order to return to society with a clearer under- standing of the possibilities of individual and social growth. From Pokrovsky 's point of view, tensions and contradictions of</page><page sequence="28">92 John Ryder this kind abound in Thoreau's work. Even in his view of philosophy itself, one finds Thoreau attempting to articulate and reconcile what appear to be inherently conflicting attitudes. We have seen that in the case of his understanding of nature Thoreau followed the Ro- mantics only up to a point, and we find a similar situation in his under- standing of philosophic activity. Thoreau was an enthusiastic parti- cipant in the general romantic rejection of "academic" philosophy, but he was much less willing than other romantics to endorse fully a contemplative view of philosophy. Though he insists that philosophy be concerned with wisdom, he nonetheless vacillates between under- standing wisdom as an essentially private, contemplative affair and as a more public, social "way of life." Pokrovsky suggests that though Thoreau was aware of the tension here, he did not recognize the in- compatibility of the two conceptions. He attempted to fuse the view of philosophy as the contemplative pursuit of wisdom with the em- phasis on the practical through the notion of "philosophic activity," which is practical activity which has as its end a life of wisdom. Tho- reau describes his understanding of the genuine philosopher in Walden: "To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, magnaminity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically." Prokovsky argues, however, that such a view of philosophic activity invariably entails a contradiction of its own, "Since it brings about the separation of people into 'teachers' and 'students/ and on such a view the phlosophically 'wise' gradually grow to stand apart from life" (GT 16). This is of course precisely the antithesis of Thoreau's intention, but Pokrovsky argues that it is a necessary consequence of two fundamental and inherently incompatible strains of thought. Pokrovsky recognizes that Thoreau's impact in our own time has been primarily through his social and political ideas, in that his most pervasive influence was on such figures and social phenomena as Gan- dhi, King, and the American counter-culture. One of the strains of his thought which made him attractive to the counter-culture, for ex- ample, was what is often interpreted as his peculiar brand of indi- vidualism. When Thoreau *s emphasis on individual moral and soir-</page><page sequence="29">Soviet Studies in American Thought 93 itual development is combined with his often scathing criticism of the dominant social trends of his time, it is easy to interpret his ideal of human life as an essentially escapist one. These aspects of his thought, interpreted in this way, appealed to the anti-technological strains within the American counter-culture. Pokrovsky argues, how- ever, that to read Thoreau as primarily an escapist is to misunderstand the significance of his work. We have already seen that on Pokrovsky 's view even the Walden experiment, the most overtly "escapist" period of his life and work, was in fact an attempt on Thoreau's part to understand more clearly the complex relation between the individual, nature and society. Furthermore, the character of Thoreau's involve- ment in the anti-slavery movement is most decidedly not what one would expect from a thinker who recommends withdrawal from the pernicious effects of social affairs. In his essay "Slavery in Massa- chusetts," for example, Thoreau viciously attacks the State of Massa- chusetts and its citizens for their complicity in the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law. And in "A Plea for Captain John Brown," he clearly endorses Brown's social activism, going so fair as to refer to Brown as "a transcendentalist above all." There are similar tensions to be found in Thoreau's general views of government and the appropriate means of social struggle. It is common, for example, to see him as rejecting any legitimacy which government might claim. He begins "Civil Disobedience" by endorsing the maxim that "That government is best which governs not at all," and goes on to suggest that "standing governments" are no more defensible than standing armies - both are "equally liable to be abused and perverted before people can act through" them. Despite this general indictment of the legitimacy of government, however, he goes on to distance himself from "those who call themselves no-govern- ment men" by asking for "not at once no government, but at once a better government. Let every man make known what kind of govern- ment would command his respect," he goes on to say, "and that will be one step toward obtaining it." It appears that even for Thoreau at least some kind of government is worthy of respect. Thoreau*s influential concept of non-violent resistance is equally complicated by other, contradictory, positions. There is no question</page><page sequence="30">94 John Ryder that Thoreau defended a non-violent strategy for responding to social evils, but this must be contrasted with his willingness, later in his life, to endorse more violent means of social struggle. In "A Plea for Cap- tain John Brown" he says: "I do not wish to kill nor to be killed, but I can foresee circumstances in which both these things would be by me unavoidable. " And in reference to Brown's attack on the Ar- senal at Harpers Ferry, Thoreau said: "I think that for once the Sharped rifles and the revolvers were employed in a righteous cause. . . . The question is not about the weapon, but the spirit in which you use it." Thoreau was clearly not the consummate pacifist. Rather, it appears, his strategy of non-violent resistance was a stage in the de- velopment of his conception of the appropriate means of social strug- gle. In his analysis of these tensions and contradictions in Thoreau 's social and political thought, Pokrovsky argues that they are the re- sult of an attempt to reconcile two different general strains of thought. Thoreau was not only a transcendental idealist, Pokrovsky suggests, but he was as well a "sincere democrat. " As a Transcendentalist, Thoreau would have us reject those aspects of life, including the social and political, which interfere with the individual's relation to nature and the Absolute - the thought of his country spoils his walk! On the other hand, Pokrovsky suggests, "as a sincere democrat, Thoreau felt that political reality demanded not a spontaneous assault on government institutions, but a conscious struggle to reclaim the de- mocratic elements inherent in them." (GT 146) Pokrovsky *s understanding of Thoreau's "humanistic democratism" as a theoretical foundation of equal importance to his Transcendental- ism requires further discussion, not only because there are very ob- vious senses in which Thoreau was not a democrat, but also because it helps to clarify why Pokrovsky takes Thoreau to be the heir to the best Enlightenment social and political thought. As a strictly political category, democracy implies a faith in people to rule them- selves and the necessary mechanisms for the will of the majority to prevail. In this respect, Thoreau was far from a democrat. He who remarks that "any man who is more right than his neighbors consti- tutes a majority of one" is not someone willing to comply with the</page><page sequence="31">Soviet Studies in American Thought 95 majority's will. But democracy is never a strictly political category, since it is invariably bound up with some conception of rights, or justice, or the greatest good, or some other broad category which defines individual, social and political ends. Thus we find a Madison, for example, so concerned with the "natural right" to property that he argues for a political system capable of impeding the majority's potential will to interfere with the private accumulation of property. This concern for what he took to be a fundamental right does not in itself make Madison any less of a democrat, in the political sense, than he would have otherwise been. On the other hand, we see ex- pressed in the Jeffersonian circle a much different sense of "demo- cracy." For the Enlightenment radicals, democracy is essentially an egalitarian concept, such that a society is undemocratic to the degree that it fosters and defends social and economic inequality, regardless of the extent to which its political decisions and policies are determined by the majority. This is why Jefferson's rejection of a right to an un- limited private accumulation of property is an expression of a demo- cratic tendency. To the degree that property generates unemploy- ment and poverty it loses its legitimacy. It is in this latter sense that Pokrovsky sees Thoreau as a "sincere democrat," and it is for precisely the same reasons that he takes Thoreau to be an heir to the Enlighten- ment rather than primarily an idealist reacting against it. Thoreau's egalitarianism is expressed in his persistent attacks on what he took to be the dominant characteristics of his culture. Po- krovsky emphasizes his analysis of property, the division of labor and "business," or the free market in general. Each of these categories is, of course, one of the cornerstones of economic liberalism in gen- eral and of the Federalist program which had come to dominate North American society by the early decades of the 19th century. Adam Smith had argued that property, the division of labor, and the free market would give rise to a flowering of the individual, of society, and to the "progress of opulence." Thoreau, Pokrovsky points out, could not have disagreed more. He saw the consequence of property as the growing luxury for some and the corresponding emiseration of others, and he consistently attacked the accumulation of goods by some and its denial to others. By the same token, Thoreau opposed</page><page sequence="32">96 John Ryder the pursuit of luxury in general. His critique of property, then, did not point toward a more egalitarian system for the accumulation of goods, but rather inherently involved, as Pokrovsky puts it, a some- what "puritanical" attempt to articulate fundamental human needs and the corresponding moral norms of life. Thoreau's persistent emphasis on the moral character of individuals* lives is also a characteristic of his criticism of the division of labor and the free market society, and in certain ways distinguishes his general critique of economic liberalism from Marx's. The division of labor, he suggested, was not conducive to individual development, but was actually stultifying with respect to moral and spiritual de- velopment. And "business," or the free market, as little more than a means of generating profits, is in the end a perversion of social vir- tues and a degradation of its moral foundations. As Pokrovsky puts it, "Thoreau transformed the romantic protest against deperson- alization into a protest against 'free' enterprise" (GT 143). This attack, however, is not to be confused with other criticisms of liber- alism. Pokrovsky points out, for example, that Thoreau's under- standing of property as a right of ownership is far different from Marx's sense of property as a system of social relations. One of the implications of this difference is that for Thoreau, the root of the problem of bourgeois society is not in the systemic relations of pro- duction, but rather in human nature. Thus the solution of social problems is a matter of will, and necessarily involves the sort of con- scious moral search illustrated by the Walden experiment. Thoreau's emphasis on the moral development of the individual is also related to what Pokrovsky calls his dual relation to the proletariat. While on the one hand he was sympathetic with the plight of the working class, he also regarded its members as too "forgotten, oppressed and culturally deprived for a conscious struggle" (GT 153). Thoreau waged his struggle against the Mexican War, slavery, and social in- justice generally, on an individual level, as a teacher and a model. While Pokrovsky does not endorse the many idealist and romantic foundations of Thoreau's philosophy, he nonetheless interprets the thinker as representing one of the great moments in the democratic and progressive strain of the American philosophic tradition.

Toro, "Grazhdanskoe Nepovinovenie", "Rabstvo v Massachusetse", in Estyetika Amer- ikanskogo Romantizma, 1977), and a pre-revolutionary edition of Emerson's works (R. U.
