<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Sociological Quarterly 19 (Winter 1978):89-102 Time and Television News Work* Richard J. Gelles Robert R. Faulkner University of Rhode Island University of Massachusetts Combining theoretical and ethnographic material, this paper outlines why time is an important vehicle for analyzing the social organization of television news work and the social construction of television news. The paper investigates major events with problematic features-unscheduled "hard news"-as a means of understanding basic beliefs and organizational practices of news assemblers in a local television news station. Based on participant observation and interviews with photographers and reporters, the evidence shows that time is a key independent variable in the selection and assembly of hard news. Time is often more than a variable, it is a constituent feature of television news work-a contingency which must be attended to if the work is to produce what news workers consider to be "good television news." The problematic elements of news work are magnified under the pressures of perishable hard news stories where adjustments to unfolding work demands cannot be predetermined or programmed. Some implications of the analysis are discussed in terms of the content of local news, the biases of news coverage, and the importance of considering time as a dynamic process in the study of work. Television news organizations bid for sociological attention because the technology of news film is a defining feature of their task structure and time is a scarce resource and dynamic work contingency for photographers and report- ters. In covering the urban scene, "quickening urgency" is the "essence of the news" (Hughes, 1940:58). Events which news workers call "hard news" are exemplary in their urgency. Fires, homicides, plane crashes, car accidents, train wrecks and the like are disruptive to the urban environment and often pose danger to the citizens of the community. The timeliness, disruption and the visual specter of danger make hard news events eminently newsworthy. For television news workers these events are unscheduled, short-lived, non-routine and perishable. The task structure of news work is precarious in these situations by dint of deadlines and the speed necessary for getting to the event, skillfully filming it, doing the "story" and then preparing the event-as-television-news for the evening program. Moreover, the risk of making crucial mistakes is accentuated because hard news coverage involves irrevocable decisions. While some social scientists have been led to remark upon the importance of time in television news tasks, there has been little systematic effort to describe and explain the processes through which "hard news" emerges, or the conditions under which time facilitates or impedes its concerted production by the urban news crew. ? 1978 by The Sociological Quarterly.

It calls for a fast, reactive response by TV photographers with a scarcity of time in which to film the event, and by reporters with limited time to develop their account of the action (see Breed, 1955; Epstein, 1973:148-9; Gans, 1972:702; Tuchman, 1972). The need for speed is paramount (Tuchman, 1973:118). Television photographers and reporters cannot rely simply on routine work strategies or conventional search procedures in covering hard news stories. Rather, they draw on intuition and a practiced grasp of what is probable and what is possible given both temporal constraints of their work and their particularized knowledge of the city, its citizens and agents of social control. In terms of task structure (Perrow, 1967), unscheduled events resist routinization: their variability means there are many exceptions and their sheer unpredictability calls for fast coordination between photographers, reporters, news directors and editors. Time is a crucial focal point for studying the social construction of television news and the processes of news work because time is more than a variable which defines what is "news." Time bears on news work because assembling hard news involves the transformation of quickly unfolding "real life" occurrences by social organizational and technological means. News work is concerted action which involves calculating the probabilities of getting to the scene of an event, the options available for bringing electronic film technology to bear, the estimated value or utility of the event compared to other events occurring at the same time and the perceived costs of this event in terms of time and energy. If old news is mere information, as Park reminds us (1967:9), then unscheduled and unexpected events create pressing work demands both in time and at a given time. In time, because the probability and utility of potential news events undergo transformation throughout the day. At its simplest, the news crew can be hemmed in, or jammed by time as they near the afternoon deadline for film processing and film editing. At a given time, because each event generates its own opportunity, its own calculus of decision making and its own trouble. Where the occurrence takes place is important; whether the news crew can get their equipment to the event in time to film ongoing action also is crucial. How long it will take news workers to react to the happening in terms of lighting, framing, focusing, editing, mounting or assembling images together in sequence, angles, etc., and then get the news film stock back to the station for processing are all part of a single work cycle. From the start of their work day at around 9:00 a.m. until 3:30 p.m. when news film has to be ready for processing at the station, through 5:45 p.m. when the news is finally edited and ordered in the "package," to air time and presentation at 6:00 p.m., temporality is a major work contingency. It is the factor upon which successful assembling of news depends. Thus, time is a resource to be used, a valuable to be allotted, an object to be manipulated in order that purposes-at-hand and organizational priorities concerning "good television news" be accomplished (Moore, 1963; Calkins, 1970). The first section of this paper examines the methods and the base site for the research. The following section reviews the unique character of medium market</page><page sequence="3">Television News Work 91 local television news and news coverage and discusses the importance of focusing on hard news as a means of providing insights into the relationship between time and news work. Next the process of creating news messages is examined through the context of time as a valuable resource which must be attended to and managed in the course of work. The technological side of news making is related to how and why time is such a key variable in news production in the next portion of the paper. Lastly, we present three general propositions which analyze time and news work. The Study and the Base Site The data for this study were derived from field observations of, and informal interviews with, the television news staff of Channel 1, a medium market station serving an eastern city with a population of 400,000. Channel 1. Channel l's news staff consisted of 2 full-time news photogra- phers, 1 part-time photographer, 2 news reporters, a news director/anchorman and a managing editor. The news staff was augmented by two radio newsmen who filled in when regular staff members were ill or on vacation. Thus, with a full-time complement of six, Channel 1 employed a smaller than average televi- sion news crew. In 1967, the average television news station employed 14 staff members-9 news reporters and 5 news photographers (see Darlington, 1967). The daily responsibilities of the news staff focused on the preparation of two daily half-hour newscasts at 6:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. At the time of the field work in the early 1970s, Channel 1 presented news six nights a week, Monday through Saturday. In addition to the two half-hour news packages, Channel 1 presented a five minute news summary on a morning talk show. The one hour and five minutes of news each day made up 33 percent of Channel l's local programming, less than the national average of 40 percent found in 1967 for local stations (Darlington, 1967). While Channel 1 had a smaller than average staff and presented slightly less news than the average local station, the station was somewhat larger and presented slightly more news than their other two competitors who operated in the city. At the time of the field work, Channel I was the leading news station in the city (as judged by a rating survey conducted prior to the field work). The Field Work. Our observations of time and television news work began where news begins, in the field with the reporters and photographers in the "news wagons." We spent four weeks riding with the news teams following the course of both unscheduled and scheduled news stories through the news process. Detailed field notes were compiled for every event-as-news the team covered during the work day. We recorded news as emergent events, the time and duration of coverage and a description of the salient features and participants in them. We were particularly interested in the ways in which the type of scheduling characteristics of events-as-news affected the social organization of newsmen's work throughout the day's time trajectory. Gains in reliability are made when observations can be done on ongoing situations of news assembly. The sequence and duration of tasks thus have a high reliability because they are recorded at the times of occurrence. We also talked to the newsmen about the</page><page sequence="4">92 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY categories that practitioners themselves used in defining the perceived demands of their work, their choices about which events to cover, and the troubles they encountered in their tasks. At first, we divided our own time between two news teams. Halfway through the study, we decided to focus on one team in order to cover a range of events with the same workers. In addition, two weeks were spent observing the internal organization of the news station operation. This area receives the news inputs from the photog- raphers, and thus its tasks and technologies are derived from both internal and external processes. We observed the work of decision making, film editing, copy editing and program presentation. Medium Market Local News Before we begin our examination of time and television news work, it is necessary to point out the special features of local television news coverage in medium or small market television stations. The size of the station, the area it serves, the resources available and the organizational constraints of medium market television all influence the relationship between time, news work and the creation of television news. Television news in a small or medium market station offers two significant contrasts to news presentation in larger market stations (e.g., New York, Boston, Chicago) and to network news. First, organization size prevents small local stations from covering more than a few news events each day. Television news staffs in small and medium market stations operate under the pressure of having to cover "sure" news stories in order to have enough local news to fill the half-hour format. Thus, scheduling and coverage at small and medium size stations are not designed to tie up news teams for long periods of time. A second facet of small and medium market news is the environment from which it is selected. News departments of major market cities deal with a more complex urban environment from which they can draw news stories. Major political events, disasters or events of national significance tend to be more common in large urban centers, while small city news staffs select news coverage from environments which produce stories small in scope and impact. A news reporter in Boston reported that a slow news day was one in which a fire or accident is a lead story. Channel 1 considers fires and fatal automobile accidents "big" news. Thus, the dynamics of local news which were observed and recorded in our study reflect those of smaller stations and different urban environments than those explored and discussed by Tuchman (1973), Molotch and Lester (1974), and Epstein (1973). While many of our observations are generalizable to all news gathering processes, many of the dynamics of temporality in task, as we illustrate, are particular to news organizations where small staffs, slow days and a "local" environment have their effect upon the assembly of scheduled and unscheduled events. Hard News. Each news medium aims at the type of story which it can cover best (Gans, 1970). For this reason, television aims at stories which can be presented visually. There are two types of visual news which television presents;</page><page sequence="5">Television News Work 93 one is scheduled or "soft news," the other is unscheduled or "hard news" (Tuchman, 1973:113). Soft news comprises the human interest type story; for instance, an interview with a national or local personality. Hard news consists of fires, accidents, bank robberies or political developments. The critical distinc- tion between hard and soft news is that soft news coverage can be scheduled hours, days or even weeks in advance, while hard news is unexpected, fast breaking and perishable (Shibutani, 1966). At Channel 1, hard news was defined as news viewers remember. One of the news photographers developed a convenient shorthand for hard news. He labeled it "The Three B's-something has to burn, bleed or have bosoms; if it doesn't, no one remembers it and it is not news." One of the pervasive ideologies held by news organizations is that they allow the viewer to be an "eyewitness to news in the making" or that they provide the viewer with a "window to the world." Newsmen believe the ordinary viewer would stop to watch a fire, be a bystander at an accident or stare at a statuesque female. Thus, television hard news allows the viewer to witness what he wanted to see, but missed. The ideology of making the viewer an "eyewitness" shapes the contingen- cies which influence what and how news is covered. Because newsmen believe the viewer wants to see action and would walk away from a fire after it was put out or an accident after it was cleaned up, newsmen believe that they must cap- ture the action on film for an event to be news. This gives hard news a perishable quality, for if the newsman arrives after the fire is out or after the wreck is towed away, the remaining activities are not newsworthy. The Organizational and Occupational Meaning of Hard News. Hard news has value for both the individual newsman and for the internal organization of the news staff. For the newsman, hard news is an opportunity to demonstrate craftsmanship. Because hard news has temporal immediacy and spatial con- finement, it offers newsmen opportunities to demonstrate their ability at solving the problems of hard news coverage such as learning about a story, getting to the scene in time to film the story and getting "exclusive film." News photographers revel in being able to film fire engines pulling up to a fire, because it illustrates that they (the news photographers) were able to get to the scene faster than the professionals (the fire companies). The power to "capture reality" and "open a window to the world," as news makers often put it, and then transmit these filmed images into living rooms is of major emphasis to news organizations. Thus, visual chaos, involving characters, objects and actions becomes a key resource for newsmen. Filmed scenarios of disintegration and disarray constitute "good television news" for several reasons. First, good television news visualizes whenever possible; second, good television news is visually dramatic, the pictures are full of incident and action; third, good television news is incisive and makes a few points in a simple and direct manner; and fourth, good television news captures the ongoing form of real life. The fact that much of television's hard news material creates the illusion of "live actuality" is important in the value placed on filming events on location, and getting the film processed as quickly as possible.</page><page sequence="6">94 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY News directors, sales managers and station executives want to have a news broadcast viewers will watch. They want lead stories which capture the viewers' attention. A good hard news story fills that bill, and each day the news staff aims at covering one hard news story which can be used as the news package "lead." We systematically observed the distribution of hard vs. soft news stories for the research periods. Hard news made up 33 percent of the filmed stories presented during any one week work cycle. Time, Tasks, and News Making Time is a major constraint which impinges on, influences and shapes television hard news coverage. The essence of television news work is managing time, and the news which is broadcast each day is shaped and molded by temporally determined work contingencies. Task temporalization is a good term for television news work because it implies the structure of work is keyed to the availability of time and the means available for using the available time. News workers move in and out of various combinations of temporal availability and usage during the work day. This movement can be concep- tualized as "trajectories" of task temporalization. A trajectory has two properties, duration and shape (Glaser and Strauss, 1969:5-7). The trajectory can be as long as it takes to cover a single story, process film or edit a final story; it can be the length of time available for either news gathering, assembling or on-the-air presentation; or it can be the entire workday, beginning with no news filmed and ending with a thirty minute news package. The shape of the trajectory in each case will vary according to the time available and means of utilization. This section examines the two dimensions of time trajectories, availability and usage. We see that hard news and news work both are products of temporal availability and decisions on how to use time. These decisions often are constrained within the structural and organizational parameters of news work and news events. Time as A Resource. The amount of time which is available structures the news workers' activities and constrains the decision making process, which is the essence of hard news coverage. An abundance of time allows news workers to investigate stories, seek in-depth information, confirm statements and facts, follow up activities and construct a polished visual and verbal picture which is complete and accurate. When the workday begins, the resource is abundant. News teams have the entire day to pursue and construct news. As the day progresses, the resource diminishes and becomes scarce. When time is limited, stories tend to portray surface action rather than total events because reporters cannot gather facts and photographers cannot film all the action of the event. Scarcity of the resource often results in rumors being accepted as facts, filming having to be rushed, cut, or dropped and stereotyping of actors and actions. Not surpris- ingly, objects become "exciting" and "newsworthy" as they undergo disinte- gration, so that burning buildings, forest fires, and the like continually take on</page><page sequence="7">Television News Work 95 the anthropomorphic status of characters as newsmen are pressed to "do something" in turning this raw material into "news." Decision making. News making is a typification process where events are typed and news coverage routinized. Essentially, news coverage revolves around deciding what to cover, what to omit from coverage and how to report events. For each decision, news workers must assess the nature and parame- ters of a potential story and whether they can or should cover the story. In making these decisions, and in ultimately deciding what is and is not news, news workers employ a kind of calculus to assess the news potential of unfolding action against the time it will take to get to the scene, film and return from the scene of the action. These decisions are made by digesting the flow of information which constantly is monitored by newsmen, and distilling this information into a matrix of temporal gains and losses vs. newsworthiness. News workers monitor police, fire and ambulance calls in their news wagons, the news room, the editing room and sometimes in the studio itself. They wait for "Code 5's", which indicate working fires or "Station 30", which means police have set up a road block-usually the sign of a robbery or homicide. Calls which ask for police cars numbered above 100 are attended to because these calls mean police photographers are being called to the scene of an accident, shooting or killing. Once news workers hear a call or get a tip a potential news event is occurring, they must be able to translate the available information into what they think is going on at the scene. Next, the "urban expert" photographer or reporter must be able to decide how long it will take to get to the scene and the best route to take. In one instance, a news team heard of a fatal accident on the other side of town. They realized, however, the accident would cause a traffic jam that would prevent the news wagon from getting to the scene until it was cleaned up. The news crew decided they could not film that event, and the story ran as a verbal report in the middle of the evening newscast. Another time, the news team used a shortcut to get to a working fire before the fire companies arrived, and that story ran as the lead on the evening news. At the scene of the event, news workers make decisions concerning how much time they can afford to spend filming and gathering facts about the action. Because the evening news requires at least fifteen minutes of news film (five to eight filmed stories) each day, news teams cannot remain at each story from the start of the action until the conclusion. Thus, they decide how they will manage their time on the scene and how much time can be invested in a story. Photographers often develop strategies for filming specific events: fires, train derailments, robberies, accidents and the like tend to be presented on the evening news in the same way, not because all fires or all accidents are the same, but because photographers, under the stress of time and time manage- ment, develop routines for covering non-routine action. The Structure of Time. The amount of temporal resources which are available to news workers is structured by the internal demands of the news organization. Deadlines establish blocks of time which in turn structure much of the news worker's activities. Each afternoon the first film processing run</page><page sequence="8">96 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY starts at 2:30 p.m. News teams which do not have their film back to the station by 2:30 p.m. have to wait until 3:30 p.m. for the next and final film run of the day. The 3:30 p.m. deadline is the most crucial deadline of the work day. If film is not back for this run, it cannot be processed and edited in time for the 6:00 p.m. news. The 3:30 deadline is also important because it marks the time when film editing is supposed to begin. At Channel 1, each film crew edits its own film and stories. Ordinarily, it takes two hours to edit three stories. Thus, if a story is to be broadcast at 6:00 p.m., editing must begin at 3:30 if film is to be edited in time to be threaded onto the studio projector at 5:50 p.m. The structuring of news time and work time means hard news coverage effectively ends at 3:30 p.m. Events which occur after 3:30 p.m. will almost certainly have to be passed up by film crews. Only the most extraordinary hard news can be covered, and even when it is covered, news film cannot be used because the film processing run has been started. One example of this constraint was the afternoon when a report of a drowning came over the police monitor. The news director knew he could not get film of the aftermath of the drowning, but he still knew a drowning was unusual enough to warrant coverage. He dispatched one photographer to the scene with a Polaroid camera so that a still visual would be available to run with the verbal account of the event (but the victim had not drowned, and the story ran as a verbal account of a near drowning). Thus, the amount of time available for television news work and how the time is structured are important work contingencies which must be confronted each day and for each potential story. In addition, the amount of the resource and how the time is structured clearly determines what is and what is not filmed and presented as hard news. The next section examines how workers use and allocate time and how these decisions affect their work and the product of their work. Using Time. Each potential story presents opportunities and options for news workers. The amount of time available must somehow be allocated in ways which lead to the creation of news stories and the minimizing of risks that jeopardize the success of the news making endeavor. Time of day, travel time and work objectives all influence how the temporal resource will or can be used. At the beginning of the day when the resource is abundant, news workers can choose to cover feature news, soft news, or they can keep themselves free to cover hard news. As the resource diminishes and film run and film editing deadlines approach, the options of using time become more limited and news teams find themselves faced with major decisions of how to manage time and tasks. For instance, one afternoon a film team was returning to the station for the 2:30 film run. They had two stories finished and wanted to have the film developed so editing could begin at 3:30 p.m. Near the station word came over the police monitor that a bank had been robbed about twenty minutes from the station. The news crew knew they had a potentially important story. They also knew if they were late getting to the bank they would be unable to get interesting film. On the other hand, if they</page><page sequence="9">Television News Work 97 did not get their film back for processing, they would be pressed for time later in the day, and not be able to edit and present any of the film they shot of the bank robbery. They chose to return their film to the station and by the time they arrived at the bank they were barred admission to the building by the FBI and had to resort to a compilation of outside shots of the bank and film of police officers milling around. The film was so dull, the story was not used as the 6:00 p.m. lead story-but it was presented in the package as a story. Because time must be effectively and efficiently used, a critical area of craftsmanship in newswork is how well newsmen make and use time. Time can be made by news workers who know how to take advantage of story possibilities. One news team was filming a birthday celebration for the Marines in the Federal Building when they decided they could get an extra story with a minimum investment if they interviewed a Congressman who was home for the week. They set up their cameras and conducted a five minute interview with the representative who was only too eager to get television time. By getting an extra story early in the day, the news team made time for themselves and were able to cruise the city later in the day waiting for hard news. A second example of "making time" occurred when a news team learned of a three-person-fatality automobile accident. They heard about the accident after it had been cleaned up but the photographer knew where the wrecked cars would be taken, drove there later in the day and shot two minutes of film of broken windshields and blood-stained seatcovers. The final film looked as if it had been shot at the scene and ran as a lead story. It was apparent that the more a news worker knew about the urban scene and the key resources and news people in the community, the more he could make time and expand his options in using time. A news photographer at Channel I who did not know the city, the back roads or the wrecking companies employed by the police found that his news wagon was often the last to pull up to a hard news story, and even when he arrived, he was often too late to get dramatic action film. There are occasions when the only option available to television news teams is not to invest time and energy in a story and thus, to relegate the story to the "non-news" category. Train derailments were somewhat common in the Channel 1 area and the news director was partial to covering these hard news events. He drew the line, however, at assigning film crews to derailments more than 20 miles from the station. He felt it would take too long to get to and from these accidents and this time would be better spent within the twenty mile radius of the station. Consequently, what is portrayed as television news are events which occur at a given time and in time to be filmed, processed, edited and broadcast as television news. Events which do not fit the temporal parameters of local hard news coverage, either because they take place too far away to film or because they occur at the same time as other events which are being covered by film crews simply are not news, despite the fact they are newsworthy. The craft of television news work in medium market stations is possessing the knowledge</page><page sequence="10">98 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY and the tools to make effective use of the resources available and exercising options which create a minimum number of errors and mistakes. The Constraints of Technology The technology of television news bears discussion in any analysis of the construction of television news and the work of television news personnel. It is the technology of 16 mm film and sound-on-film cameras which weigh heavily on the work demands of photographers. In addition, reporters must learn to write accounts of events which match news film second for second. Newcasts are timed to the tenth of a second because the national news which follows at 6:30 p.m. or 7:00 p.m. begins regardless of whether the local station has finished its news. Film processors require 30 minutes to develop film and can only be speeded up under extraordinary circumstances. Thus, the technologi- cal side of television broadcasting further structures task temporalization. Two reasons why news filming ends at 3:30 p.m. are that it takes time to process 16 mm film and because sound-on-film technology requires that a great deal of time be spent editing news film. Sound-on-film cameras are constructed so the sound is recorded on a different portion of the film than the visual impression. Thus, editing 16 mm sound-on-film is a precise and careful task. Film editors must be careful to match sound to movement and to get appropriate lip-synchronization when they edit sound-on-film. Thus, for years the television news industry was constrained by the technological demands of film processing and film editing. A breakthrough (of sorts) came with the development and marketing of what has come to be called "minicams" or "newscams." "Minicams" are small, portable television cameras which are capable of beaming back live pictures to the studio via microwave transmis- sions or videotaping events for later broadcast. The development of the "minicam" frees television news from many of the temporal and technical constraints of filming hard news. Ideally, this means news can be covered up to and even during the evening news package. The development and widespread use of "minicams" (Channel I pur- chased one in 1976) means an entirely new calculus of time and television news work is emerging in local hard news coverage. On the one hand, news directors find they can actually fulfill the promise of making their viewers "eyewitness" to news as it happens by employing live "minicam" transmissions of events on the evening news. On the other hand, directors who realize the minicam represents a substantial investment of capital and manpower (cost of the camera, transmission equipment, vehicle and the time of two or three techni- cians) often include "marginal" news events in the package in order to justify the existence of the "minicam." Thus, the "minicam" in television news means some newsworthy events that would have been omitted under the 16 mm film system due to time pressures can now be broadcast, other "not so newsworthy" stories which also would not have been covered are now being presented as "news."</page><page sequence="11">Television News Work 99 Time and the Social Construction of Television News Time can be considered an independent variable in the creation of television news content and it can be conceptualized as a constituent feature of news work. The previous sections have provided ethnographic descriptions of how television news and news work are affected by temporal constraints and temporal contingencies. This section summarizes these accounts into three propositions which provide some analytic focus to the relationship between time and news work. 1. Temporal investments increase the news value of events. There were numerous occurrences that became television news events as a result of news teams investing time in covering the story. In one instance, a film crew was traveling to a feature story on polar bears at the local zoo when they heard of a train/truck collision on the other side of town. Since it was 2:00 p.m. and this would be the last story of the day, the news team knew they needed some news film. They chose to cover the accident and dropped the polar bear story. The accident turned out to be a minor collision between a train and truck, both moving at less than five miles per hour. However, since time had been invested and a story was needed, the crew filmed the event and it ran as a two minute hard news piece in the evening package. In local, medium market news, where personnel and technical resources are limited, time investments typically must produce news film. Although news crews attempt to weigh the information they receive on police and fire band monitors or news tips, once they commit their cameras and their time, they expect a news story-and they typically get one regardless of the ultimate news value of the event. 2. "News" is action which occurs in time and at a given time. Although viewers tend to believe what they see on the evening news is a compilation of the universe of "news" events for that day, the practical reality is that what is telecast each evening is a compilation of events which news workers were able to learn about, get to, capture on film, process and edit. In other words, the action portrayed each evening as "hard news" must have happened at a time when film teams could learn about it and get to the scene of the action; and the event must have had a temporal existence long enough to allow the film to be shot. An illustration of this is the numerous train derailments broadcast by Channel 1. From the nature of the news one could conclude that trains were falling off tracks at record rates (which may or may not be true). The more important feature of train derailments is they take a long time to clean up, and this provides film teams a wide time frame in which they can choose to cover the derailment. Thus, the longer the temporal existence of a hard news event, the greater the chance of it being filmed and presented as news. The quicker the event transpires and the scene is reordered, the less the chance of that class of action being telecast as "news." 3. Bias in local television news is more a product of occupational assump- tions and time constraints than political or social biases of news workers. The news industry is constantly under criticism that its selection and portrayal of</page><page sequence="12">100 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY events is biased by the social and political leanings of news workers. Our conclusion, based on an analysis of the relationship between news work and the images communicated on the television news show is that bias and distortion are mostly a product of the occupational assumptions and temporal exigencies of news making. News events portray stereotypical action and stereotyped actors, not because of the prejudices of news teams, but because newsmen as workers, in order to manage time and film "newsworthy" events, develop routines for filming and covering those events. Since photographers and reporters cannot remain at events for hours, they must quickly size up the ongoing action and the essence of the visual presentation and narrative "story." Photographers, under editing pressures at the end of their work time in the open environment, often attempt to "edit as they shoot" the film; thus, furthering their control over time at the next stage of work. Because of deadline pressures, it is inevitable that events are reduced to surface actions; visuals of the most "dramatic" event; and brief concise narratives making a few points in a simple manner. Assumptions of what constitute "good television news" bear more heavily on a news crew than the political outlooks they bring to the work setting with them. Once in the situation of news work the accrued common sense of the craft-including the skilled management of time-determines behavior more than non-occupationally related dispositions. Another element of bias in local news coverage is a result of the fact that news workers, in order to "make time," must have an intimate knowledge of the urban environment. Consequently, local residents are preferred over outsiders for positions as photographers and reporters. While this is functional for the meeting of work contingencies, it does inject a distinctly "local flavor" to news coverage where "two person automobile fatalities" are judged more important than county, state or national events. Concluding Remarks In this article, we have explored the interface between unscheduled demand conditions generated by an organization's task environment and the perspec- tives and styles of using time and shaping and reaching solutions to those demands. This process provided an illustrative example of the utility of taking a dynamic rather than a static approach to analyzing work environments. We have advanced the general propositions that task uncertainty is magnified under conditions where time is a critical resource and where work decisions cannot be preprogrammed. In addition, task uncertainty is magnified under conditions where workers are required to make reactive decisions or a sequence of decisions. Throughout this study of news work, we have aimed at contributing an ethnography of television news work which demonstrates the essential relationship between time and the production of news messages. The dynamic properties of time constraints in television news work arise from the urban scene. Unscheduled occurrences are theoretically important because they are distributed aperiodically over long chains of work time, consist of rapid and often serious alterations of "urban life as usual," mobilize specialized reactions by the media, typically last for short spans of time, consist</page><page sequence="13">Television News Work 101 of many exceptional cases and draw to them the core elements of news assemblers' work. Unscheduled events in the form of the destruction of property or life, changes in group arrangements, health and disruptions of the urban environment illustrate the relevance of time in the production of the evening news images. Hard news displays the key features of the news worker's organizational culture: it focuses interest on the visually dramatic, directs priorities about "what works" on television, generates accounts for behavior and furnishes standards for craftsmanship. It may be said that news assemblers are permanently and specifically attuned to these contingencies. Some of the newsmen we know seem permanently poised to move on any such contingency whatever, claiming that "the only news is hard news," and "the only real work is covering hard news." Though this has been a microsociological case study, some implications of the analysis can be noted. First, the argument falls in a tradition of analysis relating time to social organization and social psychology (cf. Sorokin and Merton, 1937; Cottrell, 1940; Davis, 1956; de Grazia, 1962; Glaser and Strauss, 1968; Calkins, 1970; Lyman and Scott, 1970; 189-212; Roth, 1963). In this tradition, time is a medium of human activity, holding a different significance depending on the activity involved; it takes on various meanings depending on how people use it and confront it. With the ideas of task temporalization and unscheduled demands, however, we have tools for dealing with those variations in the salience of matters of temporality implied in these analyses but neglected in subsequent work. Second, the accent on time-its meanings and uses-constitutes an important exception to predominant explanations of social behavior in our discipline. As Cohen has noted: ". . .the dominant bias in American sociology has been toward formulating theory in terms of variables that describe initial states on the one hand and outcomes on the other, rather than in terms of processes whereby acts and complex structures of action are built, elaborated and transformed" (1965:9). Organizational environments differ in their causal texture, both with regard to the degree of uncertainty and temporality of choices presented to work units. An ethnography of time in organizations facing turbulent and unscheduled occurrences is well suited, we think, for the analysis of these processes. Our ethnography suggests that close, firsthand examination of sequential work activities can uncover arrangements that significantly influence the collective performance of organizations engaged in assembling accounts of unscheduled and dynamic environmental events. Third, consistent with the writings of Gans (1972), Epstein (1973), and Tuchman (1973), we see television news as shaped by-and constituted in-the ongoing work practices of those who assemble events-as-news. This is their work. Their "core technology" is in the environment and the task structure takes its shape from its temporal position in the processing sequences outlined. The resulting control differential, in turn, produces a variety of strategies and tactics by news people to make, spread and allocate time and thereby reduce their level of work uncertainty. Temporality as choice allows us to focus</page><page sequence="14">102 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY analytically on the elusive relationship between organization and dynamic environment process. Finally, we hope this analysis will prod researchers to study time as it appears ubiquitously in the labor of air traffic controllers, ambulance crews, pilots, parole officers, stockbrokers, studio musicians, sound mixers and television producers. Until we acquire more systematic ethnographies of organizations, environments and members' experiences and uses of time, the problematic features provided by uncertainty in task structures will remain slighted. Of course, among the set of organizations within the television news industry, there is a clear range of variation from the local to the national network news structures. Detailed analysis of these differences can distinguish between how organization, environment and task temporalization interact. We have not yet dealt with these questions. Rather, emphasis has been placed specifically, and intentionally, on the local television news organization and its news crew. From this context, the boundaries of ethnography and theory on time in organizations might well be expanded to account for variations in internal organization, effectiveness, task structure and employee morale.
