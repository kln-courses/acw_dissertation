Nevertheless it is remarkable that save on the one question of Jesus' explicit messiahship, the overall conclusion which the author reaches with regard to Jesus' intention and self-understanding is very close to that which has been reached by those whose critical presuppositions and methods the author so firmly rejects, viz., that Jesus proclaims an eschatology which he saw to be dawning in his own word and work and which he was confident would be consummated in the proximate future. The author might have been more ready to admit this final agreement between himself and his opponents had he seen that the skepticism which he rejects in his opponents is in the last resort a methodological skepticism and not one of belief. AS a result this book leaves us knowing little more about the earthly Jesus and far less about the NT church than can be known by the methods of those whom the author opposes. REGINALD H. FULLER VIRGINIA THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY, ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA 22304 GottesDild und Menschwerdung: Eine Untersuchung zgr Einheit des Alten ?wnd Ne?wen l estarnents, by Ulrich Mauser. Beitrage zur historischen Theologie, 43. Tubingen: Mohr, 197 1. PP. Vii +2 1 1. DM 38/32. Hosea, Jeremiah, and Paul, Zimmerli and Bultmann, Xenophanes and Philo have all been drawn upon, some in approval and others by way of reaction, in Ulrich Mauser's exploration toward a new understanding of the theological unity between the two Testa- ments. His book is, in substance, an exegetical study of selected passages from the three biblical writers, and the others come in by way of introduction. The purpose of bringing the two prophets and the apostle together is to demonstrate that they were all on the same wave-length, i.e., that the prophets saw God working in human history in a manner entirely analogous to that presupposed by the NT kerygma o; God's presence in the earthly Christ. Or, to put it in the author's own words: The anthropomorphisms of the Old Testament are representations of a God who is not strange to that whi.h is human but involves himself in the human by taking part in human history.... The Old Testament God er yop0 arEprov is the prefigurement of the Desws incarnatus. Oid Testament man, in a very special way experiencing his life er ,uopqv @sov, is the herald of the man Jesus, interpreted in terms of the Christian confession as vere Deus (p. 17). The reader is not always sure why Mauser has entered into a particular line of analysis until the end, when he sees that all has been ordared to a substantiation of a series of rather novel conclusions, leading at last to the claim that even Paul, as the NT's most sophisticated theologian, drew not on hellenistic savior myths but on OT theomorphism. It is scarcely possible in a limited review to discuss the details of Mauser's argument. His concern with Hosea is to bring out this prophet's strong sense of solidarity with Yahweh, as seen especially in the surrender of his personal life and in the way he expresses Yahweh's pathos as his own. Mauser's concern with Jeremiah is to argue that</page><page sequence="2">125 BOOK REVIEWS a feeling for Israel's tragedy represents the dialectic in Yahweh's own purpose to judge and to save, rather than any supposed humanity on the prophet's part, resisting the demands of divine intractability. These two prophets, only the most eloquent among a number of possible OT witnesses, prefigure a NT fulfillment in which the same God at last supremely reveals his concern in the life of one human being completely attuned to his purpose. lWauser passes by other NT interpreters of the incarnation in order to elucidate the following items in Paul's theology: (1) that God's act is Christ's act; (2) that the Christ who is now glorified is the earthly Jesus; (3) that Jesus' life introduced the climactic time of God's wrath, along with God's salvation; (4) that human covetousness turned the law, intended for life, into pride, sin, and death, but Jesus restored life by fulfilling the law in obedience, suffering, and self-abasement; (5) that in Jesus' passive act God was victoriously at work. Thus Jesus in his earthly life fully embodied the work of God, both of judgment and of salvation, fulfilling the prophetic ideal. Though he had no biographical concern, Paul did have a theology of Jesus' life, seen by Mauser as the crown and climax of biblical belief. This is a claim that challenges the dominant position in current biblical theology. The trend in NT studies has been to follow Wrede in glorifying a transcendentalized Christ at the neglect of the historical Jesus. But OT scholars stand on essentially the same ground when they apologize for the seeming grossness and primitivity of the Hebraic presentation, exalting the NT's presumed higher spirituality. Lately some have been rais- ing their voices in the opposite direction, Abraham Heschel most forcefully, urging that a suffering, feeling, and acting God may be more theologically meaningful than a Deity that is unqualified in the power of absolute being, remote from the agonies and triumphs of human life. Thus Mauser's book is one that demands attention, in spite of some weaknesses. It is eclectic, suggesting by selection the need for a comprehensive study. The first two chapters, following neither a historical nor a systematic approach to the problem of anthropomorphism, need a better organitation. But what has been done has enough strength in it to justify serious thought whether the truly unique element in biblical theology as a whole gi^ing essential unity to the two parts of the Canon may indeed prove to be the concept of God involving himself in human life.
