Silberman, "Death in the Hebrew Bible," in Perspectives on Death, ed. Liston O. Mills (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1969), p. 14. In this paper the word god intentionally appears only in lower case, and the third person neuter pronoun is used with reference to god. The use of the third person neuter for god is certainly problematic. The third person neuter is used here in part to avoid anthropomorphism and in part to preserve a sense of inclusive language. However, the primary reason for using the third person neuter pronoun is the desire to maintain the profound sense of ambiguity, complexity, and elusiveness which surround and fill the biblical experience of god. Further the word YHWH is sexually ambiguous. While it is clearly third person singular in form, we do not know if it is third person masculine, feminine, or neuter. Further, the use of the word god with an upper-case g implies that in fact there is and was only one god. The word god in this context refers both to a unique being (there is but one god) and to a proper name. Yet in Hebrew</page><page sequence="2">To an Impotent God 31 We must all die. Like water spilled upon the ground which cannot be gathered up, even god cannot lift up the life (of one who has died).0 "If one begins with the concept of an almighty god," wrote Christoph Barth, "next to which there is no other which can rival [its] power, [then by definition] one understands the power of death as god's own power . . . good and bad, life and death, heaven and hell, are simply both aspects of the one godhead."4 Within the context of Hebrew Scripture, the god of life and the god of death are, in the final analysis, one and the same. The god whose presence upon the primal waters gives life5 and the god whose bitter hand extinguishes the breath of life are one. The encounter between this god and this people from the first, then, is deeply problemat- ic-precisely because the presence of god remains profoundly ambiguous, uncertain, and unpredictable. Which face of god will one encounter in the darkness? The one which takes life, or the one which nurtures it? scripture, from Genesis on, it is clear that this god, referred to by the verb form YHWH, is not the only god which exists. Moreover, the name of the god of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is not known. Use of the capital g implies that the name of god is known, that god's name is God. Such is not the case. Until god steps out of the darkness and unveils its face, neither god's name nor god's identity can be known. Use of the lower-case g preserves this sense of uncertainty, mystery, and ambiguity. 32 Sam 14:14; The Hebrew reads: oTòg ļBo$! X1? nyps o'njjn maj mo-'a This passage offers some interesting problems, not the least of which is the Hebrew tfĢļ xtyrxb). The NRSV (New Revised Standard Edition) following the RSV (Revised Standard Version), perhaps because of the theological implications of this passage, offers "We must all die, we are like water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; but God will not take away the life of him who devises means not to keep his banished one an outcast." The JB (Jerusalem Bible) offers: "We must all die; we are like water spilt upon the ground that can never be gathered up again, nor does god raise up a corpse." The fundamental ambiguity of this passage turns on the word tíÇJ. Does it mean person? Life? Corpse? Is it here used in the impersonal and abstract sense referring to the life which has been spilled upon the ground? The phrase which follows, H3? is also ambiguous. It appears to mean something like "and he devised a plan so as not to let the one who has been banished remain banished from him." (This is my translation as are all others unless otherwise noted.) ^Christoph Barth, Die Errettung vom Tode in dem individuellen Klage- und Danklieden des Alten Testamentes (Basil, 1947), p. 69- 5See Genesis 1:2.</page><page sequence="3">32 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 It should be no surprise, therefore, that the death question6 should form the scaffold around which Hebrew Scripture takes shape.7 But why 6"Why in the presence of god is there death?" In more traditional circles, this is the theodicy question. Perhaps most concretely embodied in the book of Job, the theodicy question is born at the point where the innocent and the righteous die in the presence of the silence of god. Further, because the innocent suffer and die in the presence of a silent god, we are left with a limited number of choices: 1. No one is righteous before the law, in which case god might be just, but a god whose justice knows no mercy and compassion can only be described as cruel. A cruel god is a murderous god. 2. We die because we are human, and no one, not even god, can change that one fact of our existence. That god, as we shall see, which cannot change the fact of our death, is finally and ultimately impotent. In either case, we are left with one conclusion: the god of life is the god of death. In either event, faith in god is called into question. While many scholars have argued that the death question is not central to the faith of Israel, it has long been my contention that this question lies at the heart of Hebrew Scripture. See The Protest and the Silence : Suffering, Death , and Biblical Theology (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress Press, 1991). 7The allusion to Wittgenstein's Tractatus is deliberate. In 6.124 Wittgenstein argues that the propositions of logic represent the scaffolding of the world. However, here our position is closer to Heidegger than to Wittgenstein insofar as the language of poetry - and myth - forms the scaffold around our world. Like Wittgenstein, I would argue that there is a difference between saying and showing. The language of poetry, including language which expresses the encounter between this people and its god, is language which shows and does not say. Language which shows, or in Heidegger's terms, language which takes a measure of the distance between the earth and the sky, is language which is more primordial than language which says. Thus, before the formulation of the idea that god is almighty, one must encounter first the god which is lord of life and death. This is the story of Hebrew Scripture. See L. Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (London: Routledge, Kegan and Paul, 1969); M. Heidegger, ". . . Poetically Man Dwells . . .," in Poetry, Language, and Thought (New York: Harper and Row, 1971), pp. 221-229, also "The Way to Language," in On the Way to Language (New York: Harper and Row, 1971), pp. 111-136. Both James Barr and Langdon Gilkey have argued that because we no longer under- stand or use language as language was used in Hebrew Scripture, we no longer have the ability to hear Hebrew Scripture as it was heard by the ancient Hebrews. See Langdon Gilkey, "Cosmology, Ontology, and the Travail of Biblical Language, n Journal of Religion, 41, 1961, pp. 194-205, esp. pp. 196-97; also see his "Secularism's Impact on Contemporary Theology," Christianity and Crisis, 25, 1965-66, pp. 64-67, and James Barr, The Semantics of Biblical Literature (London: Oxford University Press, 1961), pp. 1-7. It is my contention that while there is a sense in which Barr and Gilkey are correct, language in the modern world is used analogically, while in the ancient world, language was used univocally, it does not follow that we have no access to what these ancient text say. That is to say, Barr and Gilkey might be correct with respect to language which says, but they are not correct with</page><page sequence="4">To an Impotent God 33 does the death question live? If we cannot separate being human from dying, then why should suffering and death become theological problems? Is it because the god which is lord of life and death is almighty? Perhaps. If it is the almighty god which is lord of life and death, then to be human is to live beneath the shadow of the possibility that we suffer and die at the hands of a god which is either capricious or murderous. God is relentless in its pursuit of our heart, possessive, and vindictive in its desperate passion for the human heart. And when that heart proves too elusive to possess, the god which would hold us close seeks to take our heart so that should life return to us,8 the chastened heart will know to whom it belongs. Yet over and against the possibility that god is almighty stands the possibility that though the lord of life and the lord of death are one, god is impotent. An impotent god may take our life, but once taken, god cannot return what it has stolen from us. The life, like water, once spilled upon the ground cannot be gathered up, and neither the hands of god nor the dreams of humans can change this lone fact of our existence. God can take our lives, yet paradoxically, the life once taken cannot be restored. Even god cannot raise the dead. This is the power of divine impotence. God might be capricious, even murderous,- indeed god might love us- but god is also impotent in the presence of our death. Indeed, the face of the almighty god and the face of the impotent god are one and the respect to language which shows. If we allow ourselves to see what is shown, the limits which bind our world are broken. 8Peter Ackroyd, Exile and Restoration (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1968). Ackroyd argues that breech of the covenant had as its necessary consequence exile- separation from god. Once exiled, a return to faith among the people of the remnant brought a return to the Promised Land and thus a restoration of the relationship between this god and its people. See especially pp. 232-256. Two points need to be made here: First, return to life implies a restoration and, perhaps, during the intertestamental period, an affirmation of resuscita- tion or resurrection, a return to life in this world. Second, the promise, hope, or expectation that an almighty god could raise the dead remains just that and no more. Some scholars have argued that the frustration of this hope or expectation ultimately leads to a belief in the immortality of the soul among members of the Jewish community in the intertestamental period and among the members of the early Christian church. For example, see Emil Schurer, The History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ (London: T&amp;T Clark, 1986), pp. 494-97, 537-47; D. S. Russell, The Method and Message of Jewish Apocalyptic (Philadelphia: Westminster 1964), pp. 376-79; John J. Collins, "Apocalyptic Eschato logy and the Transcendence of Death," CBQ, Vol. 36, 1974, pp. 21-43; Harris Birkeland, "The Belief in the Resurrection of the Dead in the Old Testament," Studia Theologica , Vol. 3, 1949, pp. 60-78.</page><page sequence="5">34 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 same. Beneath the veil of divine omnipotence lies the faint whisper of god's impotence. Within the bounds of Hebrew Scripture, it is this faint whisper which seeks its own voice. That faint whisper speaks to us of a god whose passion for the human heart causes that god to intrude into the world of human affairs. The god whose presence erupts into the world becomes bound by the world's limits. So, for David, Saul, and Jacob, as we shall see, the power of divine impotence will chill their lives. For Saul, divine impotence steals first his sanity and then his life. For David, beloved of god, divine impotence provides the occasion for David to manipulate god. For Jacob, the power of human passion overwhelms a god which is powerless before his aggres- sion. In each of these instances, the whisper of divine impotence speaks of a good which is deeply vulnerable. Yet YHWH's vulnerability extends beyond its inability either to raise the dead or to secure David's rise to power. YHWH becomes vulnerable when it yields to its desire for intimacy with humans, when it extends its presence into the horizon of human existence. The proximity of the divine is not only made available at the expense of the transcendent, but by entering into the world where the drama of human existence is lived, god subjects itself to the limitations of human existence. The god which stands bound by the limits of human existence no longer can be called transcen- dent. The story of David is without parallel in Hebrew Scripture. His is the story of an unprecedented rise to power and the overcoming of insur- mountable odds. His is a story of honor, dignity, loyalty, and commit- ment.9 Yet his is also a story of brutality, violence, and the abuse of power.10 David's story is about unfulfilled promises, broken commit- ments, murder11 and betrayal, insanity, and unbridled jealousy. This story is also about death. For everyone David loves, with the exception of 9Perhaps most typified by the love between Jonathan and David and that of David for Saul. Though David has several chances to kill Saul, a Saul who would see David dead, David's love for Saul will not allow him to kill Saul. 1 Samuel 24: Iff, 26: Iff (RSV). 10See the story of the death of Uriah the Hittite, husband of Bethsheba. The story of Uriah demonstrates not only Uriah's loyalty but also the cunning of Bethsheba and David's abuse of power. nNot only the murder of Uriah, but the murder of Amnon by Absalom, Ishbaal by Baanah and Rechab, and Abner by Joab. 2 Samuel 3:22-4:12.</page><page sequence="6">To an Impotent God 35 Bethsheba, dies.12 This is a story of rape,13 injustice, and broken expec- tations. This is a story of lust: the lust of David for Bethsheba, of Amnon for Tamar, of Absalom for justice and power, of Saul for vengeance and restoration, of god for the heart of David.14 And ultimately, this is a story 12This assumes, of course, that David loved Bethsheba. That David, having seen Bethsheba naked, certainly lusted after her, is clear from the text. That David loved her is neither supported by the text nor can we infer that he loved her from the text. Examine Exodus 21:37. The RSV reads: "If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and kills it or sells it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep. He shall make restitution; if he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft. If the stolen beast is found alive in his possession, whether it is an ox or an ass or a sheep, he shall pay double." Some rabbinical commentators have suggested that the death of four of David's children as couched in terms of the theft of the poor man's lamb fulfills the pronouncement of Exodus 21:37. See 2 Samuel 12:1-4, "And the Lord sent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, "There were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor. The rich man had very many flocks and herds; but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children; it used to eat of his morsel, and drink from his cup, and lie in his bosom, and it was like a daughter to him. Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the wayfarer who had come to him, but he took the poor man's lamb, and prepared it for the man who had come to him." (RSV) After hearing this story, David is moved to anger and condemns the fictitious rich man. "As the Lord lives, the man who has done this deserves to die; and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity." Nathan said to David, "You are the man. Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul; and I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if this were too little, I would add to you as much more.'" 2 Samuel 12:6-9 (RSV). Nathan in turn says to David, "Why have you despised the word of the Lord, to do what is evil in his sight? You have smitten Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the Ammonites. Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife. Thus says the Lord, 'Behold I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun. For you did it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun'" 2 Samuel 12:10-12 (RSV). So David is condemned by his own words. Having committed adultery with Bethsheba and for having murdered Uriah, David will pay four-fold for what he has done. 13The rape of Tamar by her half brother Amnon. See 2 Samuel 13:1-22. Amnon's treatment of Tamar is also a violation of Exodus 22:15-17. l4See 1 Samuel 16:13. The Hebrew reads: njn^on n^w,. The verb here is The root is which, though unattested, according to Brown, Driver, and Briggs, A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980), p. 852b [hereafter referred to as BDB], means to cleave, penetrate, possess,</page><page sequence="7">36 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 of impotence: of Saul's impotence in the presence of the loss of divine favor; of David's when confronted with the death of his sons Amnon and Absalom, and the first born of Bethsheba; and of Uriah who is sentenced to death by the cunning of Bethsheba and the treachery of David. Perhaps most importantly David's story speaks of a god rendered impotent both in the presence of death and at the hands of its love for David. That the god of Israel would be impotent, would be bound by the limits of human existence, or by its love for a human being, is disquieting. So is the relationship between this god and David. The story of the anointing of David is framed by the story of the fall of Saul.15 Long before Saul's life ends on the blade of his sword, he is abandoned by the god which had made him king.16 Yet, though he has been abandoned by god, though the focal point of god's affection has become David, Saul remains king, and as the story of David's rise to power unfolds, Saul suffers the pain and agony of his slow demise. Neither god's love for David, nor god's abandonment of Saul, is enough to end either his agony or his reign as king. Yet if the presence of god has indeed passed to David, then why does Saul remain king? Why must David repeatedly escape death at the hands of Saul? Should not the loss of divine favor bring with it loss of power? Saul should not have remained king. The loss of divine favor should have meant a loss of power. David should not have narrowly escaped death at rush. Koehler/Baumgartner, Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros (Leiden: Brill, 1958), offers "be in good condition, strong efficient" (p. 803d). This root occurs with reference to the "spirit" of god in the following passages: Judges 14:6, 19 and 15:14 (Samson and the lion, etc.); 1 Samuel 10:6 and 10 (the anointing of Saul), 11:6 (Saul and the Ammonites) and 18:10 (the evil spirit from god enters Saul) as well as here. In the Samson cycle and in the story of Saul against the Ammonites, the entrance of the divine into the human causes the human to perform unusual feats. In the case of the story of the anointing of David and of Saul, no apparent superhuman events ensue. In fact, the account of the spirit of YHWH leaving Saul for David would suggest that here n^Çi connotes something different. Note specifically what happens to Saul when an evil spirit "enters" him. This suggests that here means something more than enter, possess, cleave to, or rush, unless to enter or to possess is here understood in more explicitly sexual terms. 15For the story of the fall of Saul, see 1 Samuel l6:14f and 15:10-34. It is interesting to note that YHWH's dissatisfaction rests on a questionable interpretation of events. 16In theory, at least, Saul is abandoned by god because he fails to obey god's command with respect to the destruction of the Amalekites. In point of fact, it could be argued that Saul might have violated the letter of this command, but not its spirit. See the exchange between Saul and Samuel. 1 Samuel 15: Iff. Note that twice in this passage we are told that god has regretted making Saul king.</page><page sequence="8">To an Impotent God 37 the hands of Saul. Then why? Perhaps the reason lies in the story of the woman from Tekoa.17 Note: 1. The story takes shape around Joab's conspiring to have Absalom return from exile. 2. We are told that David no longer mourns the death of Amnon.18 3. The "parable" for lack of a better term which the woman tells David turns on a single point: Death is inevitable. Even god cannot change the fact that all that is human dies. Nor can god raise the dead. What is done, is done. If neither David nor god itself can change the fact of Amnon's death, then why should Absalom remain in exile?19 Even god cannot raise the dead. So convincing is her logic that David agrees to permit Absalom to return from exile. Yet it is not the "fact" or possibility of divine impotence which moves David to allow Absalom to return from exile. In fact, David does not address the issue of the impotence of god. Nor does David appear to be concerned, shocked, or troubled by this possibility. The issue of divine impotence he passes over in silence. David's only concern appears to focus itself around the question of who motivated this woman to come to him. The king said, "Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?" The woman answered and said, "... it was your servant Joab who bade me; it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid . . . " Then the king said to Joab, "Behold now, I grant this; go, bring back the young man Absalom."20 But Amnon is still dead. No one, not even god, no event, no punishment, can change that. For Amnon, there is no deliverance from death. So David allows Absalom to return. By allowing Absalom to return from exile, David does for Absalom what god cannot do for Amnon. There is almost a reversal of roles here. In the presence of the exile of death, god is rendered impotent, while David as king, confronted with the irrevocable fact of Amnon's death, exercises his human omnipo- tence-that is, his omnipotence as king in matters concerning humans- 172 Samuel 14:1-21. 182 Samuel 13:39. 192 Samuel 14:14. 202 Samuel 14:19-21 (RSV)</page><page sequence="9">38 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 even to the point of overturning his own decree concerning Absalom. In this way, both David and god share a common bond. Both can be said to be omnipotent, but that omnipotence is bounded by the limits of human existence and human affairs. Once those bounds are broken, both David and god are rendered impotent. Once those bounds are broken, even god cannot raise the dead. One of the more enigmatic encounters between David and god occurs at the end of 2 Samuel.21 As the story begins, we are told only that for some unspecified reason, god has again become angry with Israel.22 In order to punish David and the people, or so it appears, David is told to count the people. Perhaps sensing that all is not well, Joab protests.23 David persists- until he too suspects that all is not well. He immediately attempts to atone for what he has done.24 But the time for forgiveness has passed, and David's options are limited. God offers him three choices: 1. three years of famine 2. flee three months before his enemies while they pursue him 3. three days' pestilence.25 David chooses three days of pestilence. But far more important than David's choice is what happens when the angel of death approaches Jerusalem: And when the messenger stretched out its hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, YHWH was very sorry for the misery,26 and said to the messenger who was destroying the people, "Enough now. Relax your hand."27 212 Samuel 24: Iff. 222 Samuel 24:1. 232 Samuel 24:3. "But Joab said to the king, 4May the Lord our God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are, while the eyes of my lord the king still see it; but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?'" (RSV) 242 Samuel 24:10. 252 Samuel 24:13. 26The Hebrew reads: DJ?] - "And YHWH was exceedingly sorry for the misery" or "YHWH grieved greatly on account of the misery" (2 Samuel 24:16). The same verb appears in 1 Samuel 15:11 where YHWH expresses regret for having allowed Saul to become king. 21 2 Samuel 24:16.</page><page sequence="10">To an Impotent God 39 Here there are two questions: Why would YHWH stop the angel of death before it entered Jerusalem? Why would god grieve over the pain which the people have suffered? To these two questions there is one answer: Even god cannot raise the dead. On the one hand, were the angel of death to enter Jerusalem and take David's life, once spilled upon the ground, his life could not be gathered up again. In death, the intimacy between god and David would be lost forever, and, in the absence of David, confronted with its own impotence, god would grieve forever.28 On the other hand, the image of a god which grieves over the destruction it has wrought, in effect regretting its behavior,29 offers us a picture of a god which is unsure of itself, limited in its understanding of the consequences of its own actions, and prone to act without reflection.30 In fact, it is because god is unpredictable and apparently prone to acting without thinking that the face of god is shrouded in darkness and indeflniteness, and the relationship between the human and the divine is overcome with uncertainty. To love god is to risk one's life, to break the bounds of one's existence, to reach into the darkness, to be ultimately vulnerable. For the god which stands in the darkness offers both life and death. This is the god whose love sustains life, and the god whose lust consumes it.31 As the human breaks the limits of existence by drawing close to this god, so also does this god break the contours of its presence as it draws near he human. For both, the risk is the same: once broken, those bounds cannot be repaired. Once spilled upon the ground, our lives cannot be gathered up again- not by our own hands or by god's. The 28Though the messenger of death is stopped before it can enter the city, the killing continues outside Jerusalem- until David offers sacrifice. See 2 Samuel 24:17-25. ^See Isaiah 54:7-8: "For a brief moment I forsook you, but with great compassion I will gather you. In overflowing wrath for a moment I hid my face from you, but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you" (RSV). Again note that YHWH also regrets having made Saul king. 30Isaiah 29:1-4: "Ho Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add year to year; let the feasts run their round. Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be moaning and lamentation, and she shall be to me like an Ariel. And I will encamp against you round about, and will besiege you with towers and I will raise siegeworks against you. Then deep from the earth you shall speak, from low in the dust your words shall come; your voice shall come from the ground like the voice of a ghost, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust." This verse appears to play on the Hebrew Ariel and Areil- altar of god and lion of god. The point is that god will burn the lion of god upon its altar. Note that no reason is given, just as we have no reason for the events in 2 Samuel 24. "See Joshua 24:19: - literally, a lustful god.</page><page sequence="11">40 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 facticity of death remains unaltered. So we come to the heart of the matter: to love god is to open oneself up to the possibility that the Lord of Life and the Lord of Death are one and the same. It is to open oneself to the possibility that love and death, in the last analysis, are inseparable. And the god which opens itself to the possibility of loving that which is not divine, places itself within the bounds of human existence. God can be god, or god can love us, but, perhaps, god cannot be god and love us. . . . Perhaps it is here that we come back to Saul and the fate which consumed him. No longer possessed by god, Saul's rage is the rage of one whose love is now unrequited. Having opened himself to the love of god, having let god possess his heart,32 Saul now sees his love dismissed and knows that the heart- his heart- once stolen, cannot be returned. And the god that would have him, that would possess him, now has chosen to possess another: David. David is god's beloved.33 From the first, the relationship between David and YHWH is distinctive. Having already abandoned the heart of Saul, YHWH possesses David.34 YHWH possesses, consumes and seduces David as two humans possess each other in deep and intimate embrace.35 The Hebrew word which describes that possession or penetration is (tsalak). occurs rarely in Hebrew Scripture.36 Five of eight such occurrences are found here in 1 Samuel. As we have seen 321 Samuel 10:6 and 10. 33BDB 187 c 1. means loved one or beloved. 34It is rare for the physical appearance of a human to be described in Hebrew Scripture. Before David is overtaken by YHWH, David's appearance is described: 1 Samuel 16:12 reads, "Now he [David] was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome" (RSV). For a similar, though more general, comment about Saul, see 1 Samuel 9:2. 351 Samuel 16:13 reads, "Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the Lord of the man came mightily upon David from that day forward" (RSV).

Then the spirit of the LORD will come mightily upon you, and you shall prophesy with them and be turned into another man. Now when these signs meet you, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you. And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I am coming down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. Seven days you shall wait, until I come to you and show you what you shall do." The Hebrew reads: D'iÒg 01") The RSV offers this translation: "an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul." The Jerusalem Bible offers the same translation. The grammatical form here, however, suggests that ity^) 0^ is a complex construct. In this instance, then, 0^*1 is best rendered "spirit/breath of god," and means god/gods of evil. In toto, then, this phrase does not mean "an evil spirit from god." Rather, it means "the spirit/breath of a god [or gods] of evil." 39Both the verb and the context are somewhat different in this passage (1 Samuel 16:14). The Hebrew reads: njn? riso nyyon wciipi ovo rrçç njn? on) Literally, "And the spirit/breath of YHWH turned aside from Saul and an evil spirit from YHWH overwhelmed/took possession of him." The relationship between H&amp;0 and 01") is uncertain. The syntax alone would suggest that the two are not equivalent since one is clearly from YHWH and the other from an evil god or gods. If they are not equivalent, and I suggest that they are not, we have yet another interesting turn of events. If YHWH, angry over having allowed Saul to become king, decides to torment Saul by sending an evil spirit to take possession of Saul, and the result is that Saul consequently tries to kill David, YHWH again fails to see the consequences of its actions. If YHWH knew that David's life would be threatened by Saul because he has been possessed by this evil spirit, would YHWH have so tormented David? Clearly not.</page><page sequence="13">42 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 of this evil god, on the day when Saul attempts to kill David with a spear.40 That Saul should be so possessed suggests that when a god a human, the character or identity of that person is altered to reflect the "nature" or "character" of the god which consumes the person.41 In this sense, is far more than seizing or taking hold of someone. To be by god is to be possessed, to be seduced, and even, when once seduced and abandoned, to be raped.42 That Saul should be so possessed also suggests that there is more at issue here than the jealousy of one whose rage is nurtured by the fact that one's love has been unrequited. At issue here- over and above Saul's lust for YHWH- is the conflict between YHWH, the one who consumes this people and possesses David, and the -the evil god- which has here taken the heart of Saul. From this perspective, the conflict between Saul and David, while clearly a conflict between rivals for power, between one who has lost the object of his love and the one who now possesses that love, is also a conflict between YHWH and this evil god.43 Yet before Saul and this ¡1^^) YHWH appears to be power- less. Not only does Saul remain king, but David is also forced to flee for 40According to the RSV, 1 Samuel 18:10-12 reads: "And on the morrow an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he raved within his house, while David was playing the lyre, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand; and Saul cast the spear, for he thought, 4I will pin David to the wall.' But David evaded him twice. Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul." Again notice the RSV,s translation of the phrase On as 'evil spirit from God' when, as we have already noted in footnote 38, this phrase actually means 'the breath or spirit of a god of evil.' 41Judges 14:6 and 19, 15:14; in the story of Samson, the superhuman deeds which he performs occur after the presence or spirit of god enters him. 42See Jeremiah 20:7: riÇ^J - "YHWH, you raped me, and I opened [myself], " perhaps "YHWH, you raped me, and I let you." is perhaps Pi'el or Ni'phal in form, first person singular. If it is Ni'phal, than "and I was raped" is the best translation. If the form is Pi'el, then the action is intensive or denominative. Unfortunately, the closest English equivalent might be "and I was raped." The intensification present in the Hebrew cannot be brought into English. The closest one can come in English might be to use the reflexive. In Hebrew the Hith'pi'el carries the more reflexive sense of the verb. Again, there is no exact equivalent in English which captures the subtlety of the Hebrew. 43The idea that the Hebrew Bible demonstrates radical monotheism is not tenable - at least insofar as monotheism is understood as exclusive, as excluding the possibility that other gods exist. It is clear in Hebrew Scripture that there are other gods. It is equally clear, however, that for this people there is but one god. Insofar as this people is chosen by and dedicated to this one god, the Hebrews were monotheistic.</page><page sequence="14">To an Impotent God 43 his life. YHWH remains powerless. Unable to overthrow Saul, a Saul who has been seduced or possessed by a god whose power equals- or perhaps exceeds- YHWH's, YHWH can only try to protect David as he flees from Saul. It remains for the Philistines to do what YHWH cannot. Only the death of Saul by his own hand in the face of the defeat of his army by the Philistines preserves the life of David, and apparently frees YHWH from its struggle with this unnamed evil god.44 Yet YHWH's vulnerability extends beyond its inability either to raise the dead or to secure David's rise to power. YHWH becomes vulnerable when it yields to its desire for intimacy with humans, when it extends its presence into the horizon of human existence. Abraham, Moses, David, Jacob, Elijah . . . Bethel, Shechem, Gilgal. . . . The names and the places in Hebrew Scripture where and to whom the presence of the divine emerges within the contours of human existence are many. Though David seems to enjoy a "special" intimacy with YHWH, the story of Jacob's encounter with god is also unparalleled in Hebrew Scripture.45 Though the seduction of David occurs without resistance, Jacob struggles with god, face to face46 and body to body. Where David is possessed and overpow- ered by god, it is god, as we shall see, who is overpowered and possessed by Jacob. As the story begins, Jacob is alone when he encounters a mysterious figure with whom he struggles, perhaps while rolling in the dirt.47 We are never actually told the name of the person with whom Jacob struggles, 44It could be argued, of course, that the Philistines were the instrument of YHWH's "judgment" or "vengeance" against Saul and the god which possessed him. Clearly, as we see even in 2 Samuel 24:12ff and in prophetic texts, there were instances where YHWH so acted. Here, however, the circumstances are different. Saul is not the vehicle of YHWH's judgment against David, nor, at least at this point in the David cycle, has David offended god. The point here is clear- though YHWH has chosen David over Saul, there appears to be nothing YHWH can do to remove Saul from power or to turn the kingdom over to David. 45Genesis 32:22-32. 46See also Judges 6:22 where Gideon claims to have seen a messenger from god face to face. Contrast with Exodus 33:20. Also see Walther Eichrodt, Theology of the Old Testament (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1967), pp. 35-39. 47The Hebrew reads: The root, p3X , means to get dusty, to wrestle. See BDB 7b. p3N is to roll in the dirt, and as such to take hold of the one with whom one is struggling.</page><page sequence="15">44 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 only that Jacob concludes that his adversary is YHWH.48 The struggle continues through the night, and Jacob's opponent is unable to get the upper hand- even after striking Jacob in the hip. Still, Jacob dominates his opponent, until, as the sun rises,49 he is able to demand and secure a blessing from YHWH. Having held his own against god, indeed, having been able to secure YHWH's blessing on his own terms, Jacob and all his descendants now have a claim on YHWH's favor. The god with whom Jacob struggles has lost its omnipotence. Humbled at the hands of a mere human, god becomes vulnerable, and any sense of divine omnipotence disappears. No longer does the god of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob dominate all that is human. It is the human which dominates the divine. If Jacob subdued god with sheer human strength, David subdues god with love. David's seduction of the divine is as subtle yet as direct as god's possession of David. According to 2 Samuel 6: Iff, David set out to bring the Ark of the Covenant from Baalah to Jerusalem. Along the way, David and "all the house of Israel" danced before the Ark. When the Ark became unstable, Uzzah, son of Abinadab, touched the Ark in an attempt to steady it. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there because he put forth his hand to the ark; and he died there beside the ark of God. And David was angry because the Lord had broken forth upon Uzzah; and that place is called Pe'rez-uz'zah, to this day.50 So David leaves the Ark in the house of Obed-edom. After three months, the family of Obed-edom has prospered, so David decides to bring the Ark into the Citadel in Jerusalem. Before the Ark has gone seven paces, David offers sacrifice. And David danced, whirling around before YHWH with all his might, wearing a linen loincloth around him. ... As the ark of the Lord came into the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window, and saw King David leaping and dancing before YHWH; and she despised 48Samuel Terrien, The Elusive Presence (New York: Harper and Row, 1983), p. 90. Terrien concludes: "The proximity of the divine is never made available at the expense of the transcendent." The point which we seek to make here is exactly the opposite: the proximity of the divine is not only made available at the expense of the transcendent, but by entering into the world where the drama of human existence is lived, god subjects itself to the limitations of human existence and ceases to be 44 transcendent. " 49Genesis 32:26: "Then he said, 'Let me go, for the day is breaking.' But Jacob said, 'I will not let you go, unless you bless me.'" *&gt;2 Samuel 6:7-80 (RSV).</page><page sequence="16">To art Impotent God 45 him in her heart. And they brought in the ark of the Lord, and set it in its place . . . and David returned to bless his household. But Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, "How the king of Israel honored himself today, uncovering himself today before the eyes of his servants' maids, as one of the vulgar men shamelessly uncovers himselfì " And David said to Michal, "I was dancing for YHWH, who chose me above your father, and above all his house, to appoint me as prince over Israel, YHWH's people- and I shall dance before YHWH. I will make myself yet more contemptible than this, and I will be abased in your eyes; but by the maids of whom you have spoken, by them I shall be held in honor. " And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.51 That David, king of Israel and YHWH's possessed, would appear in public before the Ark dressed only in a loincloth, uncovered in his manhood for all to see, is unexpected. Why this brazen dance? Why does David risk his honor and the people's respect? Why does Michal react so violently? That David risked his honor and the respect of the people is surprising- unless, of course, his behavior was not shocking to those who saw him dance. However, were it not, Michal might not have reacted as she did- even if we acknowledge the possibility that she was simply jealous. But for David, the issue is larger than honor and respect; indeed, the issue is even larger than Michal's opinion of his behavior. David has been angry with god because of the death of Uzzah.52 Perhaps this is David's way of welcoming the presence of god back into his world with joy and excitement. Perhaps this is David's way of assuring that the god which ruthlessly struck Uzzah down might not strike down another. The Ark, the point of god's presence, has been removed from David for three months. Perhaps David is simply lonely for the god which seduced him while he was still a very young man. Perhaps, then, it is no surprise that Michal is angered by what she sees. The thought of the man with whom she sleeps, with whom she has been intimate, appearing for all to see as he appears before her in private, was certainly not comforting. Yet, not only does David appear in his loincloth, but his dance appears to be erotic and suggestive. Her lover courts another, and does so in a way which appears to tell the whole world that she has lost his heart. Indeed, why would Michal not be jealous, shocked, and even angry? 522 Samuel 6:8. David's anger quickly gives way to fear. See 2 Samuel 6:9. 51A composite of 2 Samuel 6:13-23 (RSV).</page><page sequence="17">46 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 But the story turns neither on Michal's anger and jealousy nor on what David is wearing or upon his dance. The story turns on the exchange between Michal and David. As we have seen, an angry Michal accuses David of lewd and vulgar behavior which certainly dishonors him. David's response is terse and to the point: "I was dancing for YHWH . . . and I shall dance before YHWH. I will make myself yet more contemptible than this, and I will be abased in your eyes; but by the maids of whom you have spoken, by them I shall be held in honor" (RSV). Michal is right. David has betrayed the intimacy that they shared. David has been unfaithful to her, and all the world has seen his infidelity. David's heart longs for another, for one other than Michal. The one for whom the heart of David longs is YHWH. David's dance is the dance of courtship. David's dance is meant to entice YHWH, to kindle the fires of passion in YHWH's heart. David, the seduced, has become David the seducer. It is here that we see yet another side of the complex David: shepherd, warrior, rebel bandit, king, and now seducer. But as fine as the line between love and lust is, so also is the line between seduction and manipulation. That is to say, David's dance is as much an attempt to seduce god as it is an attempt to manipulate it.53 Whether motivated by anger over the death of Uzzah, or by his own self- interest, by his desire not to be struck dead as was Uzzah, or even by a deep lust for the face of god, David knows that the one who possesses can be possessed, that lust consumes both the one who lusts and the one who is lusted after. So David's dance would seduce the one who has taken hold of his heart. For god to be seduced, it must desire the touch of a human hand. God must enter into human existence. Like any being in time, the god which reaches for the touch of a human hand becomes vulnerable. Vulnerable because once god has opened itself to the possibility of loving a human, god can be rejected by its beloved. Vulnerable because once god has loved a being which exists in time, god has opened itself to the possibility that at some time in the future, the beloved will no longer be. Vulnerable because like any being in time, god is subject to and the subject of the vast array of human emotions. Vulnerable because in a world where all things die, even god cannot raise the dead. And vulnerable because god's own emotions can be used against god. Regret, guilt, betrayal, 53Note the events which follow: David offers to build a permanent sanctuary for YHWH in the citadel. YHWH tells David that the building of such a sanctuary is not his responsibili- ty but will be done by the son which succeeds him as king. Once the sanctuary has been built, never shall the throne of David be vacant. See 2 Samuel 7:1-15.</page><page sequence="18">To an Impotent God 47 sorrow, these are powerful emotions. So does the god which possessed David now find itself possessed, manipulated, seduced, vulnerable, and even impotent. Indeed, the god which has been seduced, which finds itself wrestled to the ground, possessed by one who is not divine, is a god whose rage and bitterness speak with the voice of one who has been betrayed and violated. Like Michal, the god which has been violated cannot tolerate another's eyes upon its beloved, nor can it accept the fact that the object of its lover's desire is another. David can be possessed by god, or David can be possessed by Michal, but David cannot be possessed by both. By openly flaunting his body before god, David chooses YHWH over Michal. So, "Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death."54 Possessive, vindictive, manipulative, capricious, lustful, impotent is a god whose face is darkened by our death and enlightened by our lives. A god whose distance separates itself from our cries as we suffer unto death. A god whose tears mingle with the ashes of our lives. The warrior and the lover. The lord of death and the giver of life. The seducer and the seduced. The touched and the untouchable. The cold and distant mistress. The passionate, intimate lover. Vindictive, fearsome, and vengeful murderer. Impotent, powerless accomplice in our death. This is YHWH, the god of Israel. So we are brought back to the death question. Can we love a god which is unable to raise the dead? Can we love a god which, either in its power or its impotence, lets our blood spill upon the ground like water which is never to be gathered up again? Perhaps for David the answer is that we cannot. We can manipulate, even use or possess that god^ but love of god is not possible. For David, life is lived between the power and the impotence, and between love and death. As long as we live between love and death and between the power and the impotence, the death question remains open, and the suspicion that faith in a god which is either our murderer or impotent is unwarranted and untenable cannot be stilled. 5*We do not know why Michal had no children. In fact, there are a number of possible explanations: 1. Michal was so shattered by the loss of David to another mistress that she never again sought his company or the company of any man. 2. YHWH, angered by her jealousy, made her barren. 3. David, having given himself to another lover, was unable or unwilling to have children by her. But for the author(s)/redactor(s) of this passage, only the fact that she is barren appears to be important.</page><page sequence="19">48 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 Yet, in another sense, it may be the case that, even after the Holo- caust, we cannot answer the death question, not only because the presence of god remains hidden and its voice silent, but also because the bounds of our world and of our language are drawn so tightly that even if god were to cry out with a voice that embodied our grief, we might not hear. Even if god were to take hold of our heart and intimately possess us, we would neither feel the touch nor know that we have been possessed. Perhaps Gilkey was correct: we no longer live in a world where the presence of god erupts within the constraints of time.55 We cannot conceive of a world in which the divine can seduce a human,56 any more than we can conceive of a world where a human being like David would use his body to seduce or manipulate god. Nor can we conceive of a god whose own impotence is the source of god's burning rage and bitter vindictiveness. We cannot separate the word "omnipotent" from the word "god." Yet, if the woman from Tekoa's words are heard, were we really to take those words to heart, then we cannot silence the possibility that god stood in the darkness and watched thirteen million people die, burned upon the altar of our own humanity, not because god willed their sacrifice, but because god could not stop it. The lives of those people poured out like water spilled upon the ground, and even god could not gather them up. An impotent god, a god which cannot gather up the life once spilled, is no less guilty of our murder than the god that would have murdered us with its own hands. So is Job's rage just, not because god was directly responsible for his suffering, for in fact the Accuser was, but because god was powerless to stop the Accuser and powerless to end Job's suffering.57 In its impotence, god cannot answer Job's questions.58 It could only attempt to silence them with a display of its power and might. So 4 Ezra can demand that god disclose the reason why our lives are like the mist, "Gilkey, "Cosmology, Ontology, and the Travail of Biblical Language/' pp. 196-97. 56Aldous Huxley, Ape arid Essence (New York: Bantam, 1971), p. 95: ". . . from the second century onward no Christian believed that a man could be possessed by God . . 57Job 38:1-41:26. 58In 42:1-6 Job, having been overwhelmed by the presence of god, repents and acknowledges god's power. One of the paradoxes of Job is precisely this - the power of god is matched by god's impotence in the presence of those limits which bind human existence. YHWH may be lord over the heavens and the earth, but YHWH is not lord over death. Habel questions the sincerity of Job's confession. Norman Habel, The Book of Job (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1985), p. 577.</page><page sequence="20">To an Impotent God 49 but god cannot answer.59 There is nothing god can say to Ezra, save perhaps, that its impotence cannot change the one fact of our exis- tence-to be human is to die. Language about god in Hebrew Scripture, then, does not reflect some vague attempt to use an "anthropomorphic formula" in order to "[insist] upon the concreteness ... of sensorial perception ..." of the encounter between the human and the divine.60 Nor is language about god in Hebrew Scripture metaphorical, or in Gilkey's terms, analogical.61 The theological significance of the events remembered in Hebrew Scripture does not extend beyond the events themselves. There is no "ontology of events" here.62 What is said is what is meant. "If we then ask," Gilkey wrote, "what this Hebrew response was to, what god did, we are offered merely an objectively natural event."63 The god wrestled to the ground by Jacob, the god that could not answer Job, is the same god that could not resist David's seductive dance and regretted what it had done when the angel of death reached the gates of Jerusalem. This is the god which cannot raise the dead. This is not a god which transcends the world in which the drama of life and death is lived. This is a god which, having placed its hands around their heart, stands there with this people. To this god, this people gave its life and its heart. And neither god's lust or rage, neither the possibility that this god was either their murderer or impotent, could still their heart. This impotent god walked the road to Babylon and stood among the crematoria at Auschwitz. 594 Ezra 2:22-25, 8:12-14. Berrien, p. 90. 6lGilkey, pp. 202-3; Gilkey is convinced that because of the rise of the modern world, the voices of god have been stilled. Biblical events have been stripped of their significance and we no longer understand these events univocally. In turn, we have not appropriated these events within the context of the modern use of language- which happens to be analogical. As far as Gilkey is concerned, we cannot return to univocal understanding of biblical events. We must instead understand the significance of these events within the context of the world in which we now live. Implicitly, we are here arguing that Gilkey's argument regarding the use of language might in fact be correct, but it does not necessarily follow that we have no access to the "original experience behind" the text as we now know it. 62Gilkey, p. 200. 3Gilkey, p. 201.</page></plain_text>
