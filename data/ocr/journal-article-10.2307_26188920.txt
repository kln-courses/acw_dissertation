<plain_text><page sequence="1">Apophasis East and West' Despite the increasing number of recent studies on apophasis, it remains a vague subject, one which in many cases is neither fully explored, nor fully understood. The negative theology is much more complex than the simple denial of all creaturely attributes with regard to the divine nature. In the first part of this study, I shall attempt to clarify our understanding of the different ways towards the knowledge of God in theology; in the second part, I will show how these ways of theology have been implemented in East and West, using Meister Eckhart and Symeon the New Theologian as illustrations. I must begin by saying something about the historical development of apophasis. While apophasis has rightly been associated with the speculative philosophy of late hellenistic Platonism, it was not simply a hellenization of Christian thought, for it can also trace its roots back to the biblical account of revealed religion. Its earliest beginnings can be found in Greek thought, in the movement away from a pluralistic and anthropomorphic conception of the gods. This critique, along with the development of philosophical monism, converged with the biblical notion of God to provide that rich account of apophasis which finally emerged in a systematic fashion in the works of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. Broadly speaking, we can distinguish two great moments in the early historical development of apophasis. The first was the fusion of Platonic with Hebraic ideas in the work of Philo of Alexandria, in the first century B.C.; it was this philosophical development which was adopted and expanded by the early Greek Fathers. The second, and * This paper was first presented to "Byzantium in Belfast", Queens University, in November 1985.1 would like to thank Professor James McEvoy, Mr James Daly and Professor A.H.

Smyth for her help with the typing.</page><page sequence="2">RECHERCHES DE THEOLOGIE ANCIENNE ET MEDIEVALE perhaps more important, moment was the neo-Platonic fertilization of Christian principles achieved in the thought of Pseudo-Dionysius, almost five centuries later. Although Dionysius is commonly regarded as the Father of the negative theology — and if one is looking for a methodical approach then it is indeed to him that one must turn — he did not initiate a révolution in religious philosophy, but rather drew together the various Strands of thought which had a bearing on his central theme of man's knowledge of God and constructed a System which, although bearing the stamp of his own originality, was , „ r»i„ ♦ · 1 nu ·„*: : λ u UJ 11U1VJ1J VI X 1UIV1I1V, I1VV M. 1UIV111V U11U V_-111 1JIIU11 1UVUJ. Since Dionysius, then, the sacred science of theology has tradi tionally outlined two distinct methods of speaking about God, the positive and the negative. These ways are most frequently associated with the Περί μυστικής Θεολογίας of Dionysius. There he set down the distinctions between καταφατική and άποφατική (literally, towards speech and away from speech). Understood at its most basic level, the kataphatic, or affirmative approach maintains that man can attain to some knowledge of God, however limited, by attributing ail the perfections of the created order to him as its source1. The apophatic or negative way, on the other hand, affirms God's absolute transcendence and unknowability, to such an extent that no affirma tive concept, except that of existence, may be applied to him. The formulations of affirmative theology attempt to provide mental forms through which aspects of the divine truth may be communicated to man, while the negative way guards against equating the divine nature with its formal expression, an expression which relies upon terms accessible to the limited human reason; négation does this by denying all names and concepts of God. Both ways, then, take création as their initial point of orientation : the one states that God can be known through création, since he created man in his own image and likeness, while the other states that God is above création, and cannot be known in any way through it. At first it would appear that these methods of speaking about God are strictly opposed and cannot be reconciled from a theological 1. A clear and précisé account of the affirmative method of speaking about God can be found in F. Van Steenberghen, Hidden God, trans. T. Crowley (Louvain, 1966), ch. 10.</page><page sequence="3">APOPHASIS point of view. However, they do beiong together, not only dialectic ally but also necessarily, since they are two aspects of the one divine truth of revealed religion: God is both hidden and présent, both unknown and known, both transcendent and immanent. In traditional Scholastic terms, God is not part of the world, yet the world has its being and essence only through him2. Any failure to take both aspects of this truth simultaneously into account in the discussion of the divine nature will resuit in a distorted view. To lay exclusive stress upon the affirmative account of theology, in terms of univocal prédication, could only resuit in an anthropomorphic conception of God, while to stress exclusively the negative account, in terms of equivocal prédication, would sever ail connection between the human and the divine. Proponents of either way of seeking an understanding of God must admit that neither can exclude the other. Perhaps it was unfortunate that the Pseudo-Dionysius proposed such a clear distinction between the two ways, for later Western readers and Interpreters of the Areopagita tended to widen the gulf ever further, making it practically impossible for a radical negative theology to function within the boundaries of the Christian Church in the West. This apparently deep theological rift can boast not only of historical but also of geographical parameters, for it would seem that the apophatic theologian who properly intégrâtes the negative theology into his own life tends to belong mainly to the Eastern camp of theological spéculation. In the West, there has always been a strong tendency to favour the affirmative method of theology in the analogical manner of the via eminentiae, leaving the continuance of the negative tradition to the few: Dionysius, Scottus Eriugena, Meister Eckhart, Nicholas of Cusa, and some lesser figures. The affirmative tradition, in its heavy reliance upon the credal formulae adopted by the Ecumenical Councils of the early Church, has sometimes tended to forget that while credal formulae provide a conceptual form through which a ray of truth can be communicated, they do not profess to contain the whole truth about God: they remain only its expression in linguistic terms3. This 2. An interesting account of this position with particular regard to Anselm and Aquinas is to be found in R. Sokolowski, The God of Faith and Reason. Fundations of Christian Philosophy (Univ. Notre Dame Press, 1982). 3. For a général introduction to this topic see P.

A literal interprétation of anything said of the divine nature betrays, at least in the eyes of the negative theologian, the measure of man's conceit, and that is looked upon as an attempt to enclose the mystery of the divine within a rigid set of concepts. Perhaps the very effort to construct an affirmative theology validâtes in a measure the Jungian observation, that the Western mind cannot function without the aid of concepts. It is generally accepted that the Eastern theological tradition has remained reiauveiy more open to apopnasis, since tne typicai Byzantine tneoio gian did not regard the attributes of God as abstract concepts5, in a light, therefore, which has often been cast by the Western theolo gian's seemingly abstract method of déduction and rational analysis. However, the différences between Eastern and Western thought cannot, at the risk of distortion, be simply reduced to such a facile opposition. I do not wish to give the impression that the whole tradition of Western theology in this area was an attempt to enclose the mystery of the divine reality within 'a tidily arranged set of clear and distinct ideas'6, and I certainly do not agree with Yannaras's général évaluation of Western theology as abstract intellectual discourse'7. Nevertheless, it is true that there was and that there still remains a tendency in this direction. While it is extremely difficult to détermine the reasons lying behind the almost overwhelming support given to the kataphatic way in the West, I would suggest that the link between negative theology and mysticism may have contributed to this neglect8. It has often been the experience of those who have followed the negative way to its farthest possibilities that they pass beyond the traditional boundaries of theology, understood as an intellectual 4.

By mysticism I mean an awareness of an intimate union with God, which results in a mode of knowledge which is not of the same order as the normal cognitional process.</page><page sequence="5">APOPHASIS discipline, into the realm of mystical union. Mysticism has always been a difficult area of study for the philosopher, and indeed for the theologian, as its advocates lay claim to a vision which cannot be subjected to the scrutiny of intellectual reasoning. For this reason the mystic, and by the same measure the radical negative theologian, has frequently been regarded with distavour by Western ecclesiastical authorities. He has been treated with extreme caution and even suspicion, because of his claim to an intimate and direct knowledge of God. For example, the Periphyseon was mentioned in the condem nations of 1210 and 1225, and was placed on the Index librorum prohibitorum in 1684. In 1329, twenty-eight propositions taken from the writings of Meister Eckhart were condemned as heretical. That the greatest master of them all, Dionysius, himself enjoyed such widespread renown and authority right down to Renaissance times, can only have been due to the persistent success of his contrived attempt to adopt the identity of St Paul's Athenian convert. Disfavour and attempted suppression have not been confined to Christian writers alone: in the fifth Century B.C., Protagoras was expelled from Athens for his simple yet outspoken agnosticism ; his treatise On the Gods was officially condemned and ail copies ordered to be aestroyea. Aitnougn rrotagoras was not a negative tneoiogian, ms case displays, I think, a common reaction on the part of the respective authorities. While I do not wish to overemphasize the mystical aspect of the radical negative theology, or to suggest that the apophatic way and the mystical way are one and the same thing, the two clearly are linked, in that the final outcome of the apophatic way, in practice, easily merges into the mystical way. At the same time, it is necessary to point out that those who rely on the affirmative method of theology are not precluded from the state of mystical union. As I shall later demonstrate, neither method need enter into the realm of mystical experience9; each can remain at the level of theological discourse. While I hasten to add that a certain amount of respect for apophasis must always be maintained, I do believe that it has an increasing relevance for our own time, in that it plays a larger part in 9.

Lossky, La théologie mystique de l'Église d'Orient (Paris, 1944), pp. 35-37.</page><page sequence="6">10 RECHERCHES DE THÉOLOGIE ANCIENNE ET MÉDIÉVALE the experience of the ordinary man than its advocates would lead us to believe. There has always been much secrecy surrounding apophasis, and this can be traced, at least in part, to the Platonic tradition and, in particular, to Neoplatonism, from which apophasis derived its most vibrant impetus. Neoplatonism was not only a philosophical System, it was also a way of life; and it is here that we come close to the truth of the negative theology: the fact that it does not always remain on the level of theological discourse gives it a privileged position. We shall discuss this in greater detail in the pages to follow. While most Christian writers emphasize more strongly one or other aspect of the double truth of transcendence and immanence, for the most part they are aware of the distorted nature of the image to which an exclusively affirmative or negative path could lead. This is why we find Augustine, who relies mainly on the affirmative method, continually proclaiming the two-fold truth of secretissime and praesentissime: 'tu autem eras interior intimo meo et superior summo meo'10. In the same way, Aquinas, that great master of theological method, displays his keen sense of the unknowable nature of God: 'Hoc est ultimum cognitionis humanae de Deo; quod sciât se Deum nescire'11. It is because we find the majority of important Christian theologians taking at least some account of the negative theology that I wish to suggest that there exist, not simply two fundamentally distinct théologies, but rather, a variety of positions lying somewhere between the two extremes of apophasis and kata phasis. In the following pages I would like to outline at least the more familiar basic positions which can be found in the theology of some important Western thinkers. However, at the very outset, I wish to reaffirm that the nature of any theological discourse consists in speaking about God and, as such, remains on a secondary level, i.e., at more than one remove from reality. I would also suggest that we do not accept these various positions as completely différent stages, for at times there is very little to separate one from the other. 10. Confessions VII (11), ed. M.

The main premise underlying the kataphatic theology, and one which suggests a basic neo-Platonic influence, is that création, as the effect of God's creative activity, must bear some relation to its cause. This idea is often strengthened by the use of the biblical notion of man, created in the image and likeness of God. Therefore, for the kataphatic theologian, there must be a fundamental relation between créatures and the creator. This truth was accepted almost universally by the médiéval scholastics and it led many of them to the idea that God cannot be known outside of the economy in which he reveals himself. This understanding, while based on sound principles having the support of scripture, is not, as we shall see, the whole truth. For example, the God of Moses's experience was a God directly revealed (even though under the external forms of fire and cloud), for Moses, to whom God spoke as a man speaks to his friend, knew God face to face12. The affirmative theology, then, rests on the fundamental logic of God's causal activity; tn lise the Histinetinn iimnncr the frreek fathers the VnnwleHae resnltina from the contemplation of this truth is knowledge of God in ένέργεια. For the kataphatic theologian, God cannot be known as he is in himself. This principle will give us our fundamental distinction between the two théologies, for it is my contention that the Western negative theologian believes that God in himself can be known, or rather experienced. The distinction between ουσία and ενέργεια, between God as he îs in himself and God as he is with créatures (as Meister Eckhart would say13), raises the fundamental question about which any theologian concerned with the nature of man's speech about God must first décidé. It is at this point that I find the Eastern theologian much closer to the kataphatic approach than is commonly recognized; however, I shall return to this question in the second part of my paper. Knowledge of God in ενέργεια therefore, receives the stronger 11. Quaest. disp. de pot. dei, qu. 7, a. 5, ad 14. See also J. Pieper, The Silence of Saint Thomas, trans. D. O'Conor (London, 1957). 12.

Yet a thoroughly univocal prédiction will always distort the divine nature by its anthropomorphic conception, and as such cannot be regarded as a viable means to approach the transcendent God. At its most crude level, and one which is not found in any of the great masters of theology, it would suggest that all terms such as 'good', 'wise', and 'just', can be predicated of God in the same way as of créatures. A theology of this kind would tend to lay too much emphasis on the human aspect of the realitv of the Incarnation tfrom which its imDetus nartlv derivesl. to the exclusion of the other aspect of the nature of Christ. It would go too far in its attempt to indentify Christ with man, and in doing so, would lose sight of the transcendent God. A further stage of the affirmative theology, and one that is instantly recognisable in many Christian theologians, proposes that the qualities we can affirm of the divine nature, while they are used primarily of created natures, exist also in God, although in a higher, or superlative fashion. This position also, while it attempts to take account of the transcendent aspect of God's nature, cannot rid itself of anthropomorphism, as it places God in the position of a 'super man'. Once again, this conception is not to be favoured as a means of speaking about God, for it Stretches human experience and language to their limits, only to place God ai that limit14. We 'make a complété break between what we can think or say, and what God is'15. This 'break' is exemplified in the via eminentiae, which is a further, more complex refinement of the position just outlined, and which exhibits a more balanced mixture of apophatic and kataphatic elements. It is a method of speaking about God which is examined thoroughly by Aquinas and it merits a more detailed discussion here. Aquinas's basic, underlying belief is that man cannot know God, as he is in himself, since human reason cannot grasp simple, unified essences16. We can know only that God is, not what he is17. The 14. See C.B. Daly, The Knowableness of God, in Philosophical Studies 9 (1959) 117. 15. Ibid. 16. S.T. I", qu. 12, a. 1, in corp. 17. This distinction between the essence and existence of God is first found in Philo of Alexandria, Quod deus immutabilis sit, XI11:62.</page><page sequence="9">APOPHASIS 13 realities we directly know, that is, material and sensible things, cannot contribute to the knowledge of God as he is in himself but only to the knowledge of his manifestation in his effects. It is in this sense that our knowledge of God is placed at a third remove from the reality it wishes to grasp. Aquinas asserts categorically the impossiblity of knowing God in his essence, except a man be lifted out of this life18. God, in the pure, unified simplicity of his being, lacks anything creaturely; he does not belong to the same genus as man or as any other créature19, and therefore, unlike anything in the created order, he cannot be named: dicitur deus non habere nomen, vel esse supra nominationem, quia essentia eius est supra id quod de Deo intelligimus et voce significamus'20. This negative element features strongly in the thought of Aquinas, and while it reaffirms his reliance on the causal aspect of God's nature and activity, it nevertheless présents as streng an emphasis on the unknowability of God as is to be found in the negative tradition itself21. Having established the fundamental fact of God's unknowability, Aquinas suggests that we can nevertheless speak of him; it is the concern of the method of analogy to justify speech about God. Basically, analogy is a way of using language to refer to God, and as such it is to be understood in terms of Aquinas's own distinction between reference (the level of désignation) and sense (the level of meaning)22. Following Aristotle's formulation, that words signify thoughts which, in turn, point to the realities they attempt to represent, Aquinas argues that it is in this way that we must understand speech 18.

It is generally accepted that Aquinas used the negative theology as a corrective against a too anthropomorphic conception of God's nature, but he did not in fact use it in any systematic fashion.

S.T. I*, qu. 13, a. 1, in corp., where the distinction is made between res significala and modus significandi. It is our knowledge of créatures which enables us to use words about God, but because these words have their roots in a creaturely mode, they cannot describe the essence of God.</page><page sequence="10">14 RECHERCHES DE THÉOLOGIE ANCIENNE ET MÉDIÉVALE about God23. The words we use point to or literally designate the reality that God is, but they represent him only in a most inadéquate way. For Aquinas, to say that God is good means that what we call goodness in man and in création pre-exists in God in a higher, transcendent fashion : 'id quod bonitatem dicimus in creaturis, prae existit in Deo, et hoc quidem secundum modum altiorem'2*. Goodness exists most fully in God, and is therefore possessed by créatures only in an inferior way. Yet we cannot say in what way goodness does exist in God, simply that the goodness reflected in created beings flows out from God's own being25. While something in God's nature is like goodness, nevertheless since God is simple, unified being, attributes cannot be separated out from his existence. The duality or composition found by metaphysical analysis in every created thing does not apply to God, and ail our référencés to him, while representing conceptual distinctions made by the human mind, cannot be understood to constitute a quoad rem or real distinction in God's nature. Aquinas would call this method of speaking about God a half-way position between the two extremes of univocal and equivocal prédi cation. The words we use in this way are certainly not univocally applied to God and création (that would quite mistakenly suggest that God's being falls within some genus), since what we mean or understand by the term 'good', in designating an object of nature or a human being, falls short of what is intended when we say, 'God is good'26. On the other hand, the analogical method avoids equivocal prédication27. Aquinas's whole understanding of God and of our way of speaking about him rests on the fundamental likeness that must exist between effect and cause, and therefore Aquinas cannot sever ail relationship between créature and God, nor would he wish to do so. Thus we find in the via eminentiae a basically apophatic position, although Aquinas's resolution of the problem of knowledge and speech about God differs radically from the solution offered by the 23.

The latter supports the thesis that it is because God is transcendent, wholly removed from the world of created experience, that he cannot in any way be known through it. In effect, the method of Aquinas is not so distant from the method traditionally named the via remotionis — what I will call the first step in the negative theology properly speaking. Aquinas's admission that God does not possess anything creaturely is an implicit, though not systematic, removal of ail creaturely attributes from his nature. However, for Aquinas, füll equivocal prédication would lead to an agnostic stance; it would sever ail relation between man made in the image of God, and God. Man must stand in some relation to God ; Aquinas was too aware of the needs of human nature to propose the worship of unknown, nameless, simple unity, that worship which would resuit from the conclusion that the prédication to God of names of créatures can only be equivocal. Apophatic Theolog y At the other end of our theological scale, then, we find the via negativa28. Primarily, in opposition to the affirmative theologian, the negative theologian déclarés that God cannot be known through his created efifects; one cannot transfer creaturely attributes to the divine nature without diminishing the unrestricted nature of his transcendence. According to Meister Eckhart who represents the most forceful case for the negative theology, before création, God existed suprême in himself, totally whole and as he was in himself. Man must therefore seek to attain to a knowledge of God which is not dépendent on 28. According to E.R. Dodds, there are a number of ways in which God can be regarded as unknowable (see the appendix in his édition of The Elements of Theology (Oxford, 1963), pp. 311-312). They are as follows: 1. because he is foreign or nameless (Acts 17:23); 2. because of the limitations of the human mind; 3. unknown in essence, but partially known in his energies; 4. unknown in his positive character and definable only by négation; 5. unknown except to those with a special révélation; 6. unknown except in the unio mystica.</page><page sequence="12">16 RECHERCHES DE THÉOLOGIE ANCIENNE ET MÉDIÉVALE divine economy, for God cannot properly be understood simply as the creator of man29. This position nécessitâtes the transcendence of causal catégories, a transcendence which, if understood in terms of a cosmic spirituality, makes the heretical-sounding statements of Eckhart fully orthodox. It is only in the light of the practice of intense purification that Eckhart's famous remark, Ί pray to God to make me free of God'30, can be understood. Therefore, the negative theologian seeks a knowledge of God which is not dépendent on God's causal activity. χ nv y lu ι cmviiL/riià, wmvii vuiiouiuivo luv jpi ixx&amp;cix j otwp m luv negative theology through its systematic removal from the nature of God of ail attributes relating to created existence, may begin by denying that any obvious inanimate or human characteristic or attribute holds true of God; often, however, it presses on to deny ail qualities and conceptual images, even symbolic names and titles. God, for the negative theologian, is 'not good', 'not just', 'not wise' and so on; He cannot be called by the name of any thing or quality. The negative theologian who denies the initial affirmations made of the nature of God can do either of two things: he can continue further along the road of apophasis (and once again there are two directions which his path may take), or he can stop at the purely theoretical level. This is a difficult position and one which can in some cases constitute a basic agnosticism.

Loss of soul in the void of pure and absolute nothingness can force the searcher to turn away from the transcendent realm, where he has focused his attention in the search for meaning. He is then required to turn within himself, in an attempt to find whatever he was seeking for in the transcendent. This kind of agnosticism — the resuit of a systematic déniai with respect to the divine nature of ail created attributes — forces man to answer, at least in modem existentialist terms, the question of suicide.

This is a continuai struggle; it is, in Meister Eckhart's terms, living without a why31, and it is what I will call apophasis proper, as opposed to negative theology, which I believe remains on the level of intellection and négation. I would suggest here that the term 'negative theology' and its practice, as those have been employed up to this point, do little more than express man's inability to know the divine nature. Apophasis, on the other hand, is an expression both of man's inability and also of a positive knowledge of God32. Those to whom it is not given to make something very similar to the Plotinian of Dionysian leap must keep their balance and sanity on the edge of the unbridgeable chasm, which is the unknowable, unnameable God. If the negative journey continues, however, there are two main destinations charted by the masters of apophasis. One can, like Scottus Eriugena, assert that God is neither good nor not good, but that he is neither of these only because he is more than good. Thus we have a synthesis (to use Hegelian terms) of thesis and antithesis: God is 'more than good', 'more than just', and 'more than wise'. This manner of speaking about God, while it carries with it some positive meaning, deliberately refuses to define what that meaning is. The apophatic theologian who uses this method of négation justifies it, in the sense that he déniés, only to affirm in the highest sense possible33. It is for this reason that apophasis does not, as some would argue, cancel the initial affirmation and plunge into agnosticism, because 'négation is not there to unsay what is said of God, but to ensure that it is said of God34. This method is one way of preserving both the immanent and the transcendent aspects of God's nature. However, the negative theology need not remain on this purely theoretical level, for it may take the other option open to it; it is here that apophasis fully asserts itself as a radical way of déniai and négation. For one who would embark on this way, the first option could not properly 31. Ibid. 32. This distinction is clearly explained by C. Guérard, La théologie négative dans l'apophatisme grec, in Rev. des sciences phil. et théol. 68 (1984) 183-200. 33. See Eckhart's sermon, 'Quasi Stella matutina' (67), where he argues that he denies only to affirm in the highest sense possible. 34. Daly, The Knowableness of God, p. 127.</page><page sequence="14">18 RECHERCHES DE THÉOLOGIE ANCIENNE ET MÉDIÉVALE signify the nature of the divine: it restrains its apophatic thrust by simultaneously affirming God's goodness on a higher level. At this further stage, God cannot be called 'more than good', or 'not good', for he is not good in any way. If he were good, says Meister Eckhart, he could become better and even best; but we cannot use any of these words about God, since he is completely beyond them ail35. Every thing must be negated, even the négation itself, and it is through this negatio negationis that we are led more fully into the epistemological crisis of the radical negative theology36. Having disclosed the tremendous extent of the gap which now exists between man and God, the negative theologian must find some way to reach out to God. That negative theology which does not, or cannot, continue beyond absolute négation must be regarded as half a journey only. Though its culmination may be reserved for a chosen few, apophasis must pass from the ignorance of knowledge to the knowledge of ignorance. The via remotionis, if it continues to the point of the negatio negationis in its total eradication of ail similarity between the human and the divine, must attempt to find some point of contact with God, for not all men can live in the worship of the negative abstract. It is at this point that the affirmative theologian would criticize the apophatic way, on the grounds that the idea (if indeed it can be called an idea) of God obtained in this way 'conjures up a picture of a being devoid of richness, variety, movement, grâce and life'37, and would argue that radical négation can lead only to a kind of religious atheism. This, however, is not the case with those who have followed apophasis to its utmost limits. The 'way' developed by the negative theologian, who can continue further in the search to know the divine nature as it is, leads naturally into the mystical way, into the way of the 'ultimate beyond'. If God cannot be known through divine economy, then he can be known only in himself. It is in this way that the cognitional crisis is resolved, for the negative 35.

Thus the logic of abstraction becomes clear, as Dionysius says: τα πάντα άφαιροΰμεν ïva άπερικαλύπτως γνώμεν εκείνη ν την άγνωσίαν39. Most advocates of the negative way would agree that the mind is clogged up with all kinds of ideas and can never look upon any object with clear sight, since it always has inbuilt frames of reference which cloud its view. The intellectual purification of the apophatic way in its most radical form is a continuai 'unknowing' of création; it is an attempt to clear the mind of all ideas and concepts, all of which impede its true vision.

This knowledge is called by the mystics 'knowing by unknowing', or 'divine ignorance'40. Thus, unknowing knowing, or divine ignorance, has a double viewpoint: it is both knowing and unknowing. It is achieved through a methodical process of unknowing both créatures and God, from a creaturely point of view. According to Meister Eckhart, unknowing in this sense is achieved by the man who, standing in his primai innnrpnrp tnnws nothin» wills nothinc and has nothintr41 The man who lives without a why, he who has reached the state of perfect releasement (Gelassenheit), is the man whose ignorance may be transformed into knowledge, knowledge that can be described in terms of the intellectus divinus of which Aquinas speaks42, in that it truly is knowledge, but sub specie aeternitatis, i.e., no longer from a human point of view.

When this aim has been accomplished to the extent that the finite mind is able to do so what is left seems, indeed, to be nothingness, but is, in reality, the incompréhensible Maximum43. Although Nicholas himself will say that our only knowledge of the divine is the réalisation of our ignorance of it44 — only the Maximum comprehends itself45 — his predecessor, Eckhart, does admit that man can in some way share in God's knowledge of himself: ...oculus in quo video Deum, est ille idem oculus in quo me Deus videt. Oculus meus et oculus Dei est unus oculus et una Visio vel videre et unum cognoscere et unum amare46. The 'ultimate beyond', or the realm of mystical union, is where one understands God to be truly beyond any affirmation or négation made on the descriptive level. According to Cusanus, God is the coincidentia oppositorum41, that to which nothing can be placed in opposition. The transcendence of affirmation and négation results in an incommunicable knowledge which is exemplified in the paradoxical Statements of those who have had the experience: bright darkness, ineffable word, superessential essence and, indeed, unknowing knowing. This way of truly positive knowledge opérâtes with a logic which is not easily understood by those who have not been there. This knowledge is suprême crossing a blazing height; though formai reason tries it crumbles in the dark but one who would control the night by knowledge of unknowing will rise beyond ail science48. 43.

It demands a faith and a dedication that is found only rarely, for it is a difificult path and cannot be charted by the normal process of human reason. Precisely because the negative way is less categorical than the positive way in the statements it makes about the divine nature, it is more open to misinterpretation. Because of its radical transformation of normal cognitional and ontological catégories, it is a delicate subject 1/4 /\«i A iirlii/ili »-V* ■ inf 1\ n 4-1-* ^ - IVO l IVJL/VVl. Il remains however, an important method of theology, for, in it, words lead to relationship, and the most absolute negative theology affirms that the highest cognitive faculty is that of love, not intellect. While I do not wish to give the impression that the affirmative way is in every way inferior to the negative way, or that it has little value as a valid means of approaching the problem of man's knowledge of God, I do wish to stress that the negative way opens itself more readily to the unspeakable mystery of God. Theology East and West Although my analysis of the différent degrees of theological spéculation has, for the most part, been based on the Western models with which I am most familiar, I feel it was necessary to have a broad idea of the différent methods of theology before we can turn to discuss the apparent différences between East and West. Before I continue, I would like to reiterate my somewhat unorthodox understanding of the two main ways of theology, presented in the outline I have just given. For the kataphatic theologian, God is Kasiriallv linVnnwiiKlp in pccpnpp Hut nortiallu Vt-i/wiraKlo V»io manifestation in the created order. For the true apophatic theologian (not, at this stage the sort of negative theologian who is chiefly concerned with the intellectual refinement of négation), God cannot be known through création : his nature is so totally transcendent that he cannot, in any way, be known properly through the created order. In typical fashion, then, the apophatic theologian keeps silence</page><page sequence="18">22 RECHERCHES DE THÉOLOGIE ANCIENNE ET MÉDIÉVALE regarding the nature of the transcendent God, who cannot be expressed or named by the normal processes. The apophatic theologian, then, who embarks upon the way of unknowing, perseveres in his ignorance until his knowledge becomes a truly positive knowledge: the knowledge which is not knowledge of God in ένέργεια, but knowledge of God as he is in himself before there were créatures, i.e., knowledge of God in ουσία. Thus, we have an interesting (and, some might say, heretical) reversai of the positions normally attributed to the two théologies. Now I would like to explain, in terms of my understanding of the différences between Eastern and Western thought, how this reversai can be true in Western, but not in Eastern terms. I would first like to attempt a very broad outline of the basic distinctions between Orthodox theology and Western theology. 1 take the view that in général there exist three points on whicn Eastern theology chiefly distinguishes itself from Western theology. The first of these has its roots in the dogma concerning divine οικονομία and the resulting distinction between θεολογία and οικονομία. This is a very important distinction, concerning not only God's creative and redemptive activity, but also our knowledge of God. On the one hand, οικονομία is regarded as the révélation Coming from the Father, through the Son and the Spirit, it is a katabasis. Θεολογία on the other hand, is an anabasis, and concerns our knowledge of the Trinity. It is an upward movement, through divine révélation to the iiiicc puauna ui nie îiimi^ . umwuic, van uv ιvgaïuvu (in the traditional neo-Platonic schematization of reality) as πρόοδος, while θεολογία is επιστροφή — the dialectical processes of divisio and reversio, according to Scottus Eriugena in the ninth Century. In his comments on this distinction in In The Image and Likeness of God, Lossky's most urgent and underlying plea is that we must extricate the notion of the Trinity from the cosmological implications proper to the divine economy50. In other words, we must attempt to attain to a knowledge of God as he exists in himself in his triune nature. Yet even Lossky's radical theology (radical at least to Western minds) admits that our only way to the knowledge of God is an 49. Lossky, In the Image and Likeness of God, pp. 15-16. 50. Op. cit., p. 15.</page><page sequence="19">APOPHASIS 23 ascent through the realm of divine οικονομία — i.e. the way in which God himself has chosen to reveal himself. The Trinitarian aspect (and here we must remember that if we make this distinction it pertains only to the human mind, it cannot be a real distinction in the nature of God) is therefore unknowable apart from, or outside of the manner of révélation itself. My second point concerns the traditional Orthodox distinction between ένέργεια and ουσία51 : here we come to one of the most hotly disputed areas between theologians of East and West52. Firstly, I would like to recall the seven points made by the Orthodox Council at Constantinople, in 1351. These I reproduce from an article by Kallistos T. Ware, and source détails may be found there53. 1. There exists a distinction between essence and energy (singular or plural). 2. The energies are themselves uncreated. 3. The resuit is, that there is no existing compositeness in the nature of God. 4. The term 'deity' refers to both. 5. ουσία enjoys a certain priority. 6. Man can participate in the energies, but not in the essence. 7. The divine energies may be experienced by man in the form of light. One important point to note here (and one to which I will return), is that όυσία remains always unapproachable. The whole question of the essence-energies distinction raises an 51. The earliest reference to the essence of God and his energies occurs, as far as I know, in Philo of Alexandria (who subsequently influenced the whole Alexandrian school). "...ούτος γαρ ήμών των ατελών άν εΐη θεός, των δέ σογών και τελείων à πρώτος (for this must be God for us the imperfect folk, but as for the wise and perfect, the primai being is their God)". Legum Allegorica, Bk. 3, LXXIII:207. (Text from the Loeb Classical Library, Vol. I (London/New York, 1929). For Philo, the energy of God was the λόγος who made manifest his invisible nature. 1t was the principle of médiation standing between God and the world, neither created nor uncreated (Quis rerum divinarum heres, XL1I:206). God, in his essence, stands outside the world, while his powers of energies support and maintain it (De posteritate Caini, V : 14). Both the Eastern and Western Fathers developed this notion according to their own fashion. 52. An interesting article on this debate can be found in Kallistos T. Ware, God Hidden and Revealed: The Apophatic tVay and the Essence-Energies Distinction, in Eastern Churches Review 7 (1975) 125-136. See also the objections to Ware's thesis in Dom I. Trethowan, Irrationalily in Theology and the Palamite Distinction, in Eastern Churches Review 9 (1977) 19-26. 53. Op. cit., p. 130.</page><page sequence="20">24 RECHERCHES DE THÉOLOGIE ANCIENNE ET MÉDIÉVALE important question, one which must be asked (if not indeed answered) at the outset; and that is, whether this distinction is real or notional. If it is a notional distinction (one that pertains only to the mind of man in order to make his task easier), then traditional Thomistic epistemology (and also, therefore, metaphysics) bears a remarkable similarity to Eastern theology. If, however, it is a real distinction, then the déniai of compositeness in the nature of God is certainly under fire. Either way, we will have an interesting conclusion, except perhaps if we turn to Gregory Palamas for the answer to our question. In traditional Orthodox terms, the distinction referred to has been regarded as a real distinction, one which, according to Palamas, in no way contradicts the uncomposite nature of God, because, while the essence and energies are distinct, he would maintain that they are also inséparable, much in the way that the sun's rays are part of the sun, yet visible and distinct54. The distinction, for Palamas, must be regarded as sui generis: man cannot understand how such an apparent dichotomy cannot compromise the simplicity of God. Thus, we have the answer to our question. Not perhaps an answer that would satisfy a rationalistic enquiring mind, but one which is quite sufficient for the mystic, the man of God. I am not familar enough with the vast number of primary texts concerning this whole question to make a final pronouncement, but I would like to suggest, in the light of what I have said about pççpnpp ar»H pnp.raip« that thp OrthnHnv prrmhaçiç nn thp linlrnnwahlp nature of the essence of God (whether as Trinity or not) has more in common with the method of the kataphatic theologian, as outlined in the first part of this paper. I would also suggest that it was precisely this important distinction between ουσία and ενέργεια which prevented the Eastern theologian from becoming as radical as the Western apophatic theologian. Because he accepted that the energies are knowable, and that the word 'deity' refers both to ενέργεια and to ουσία, the Eastern theologian was not forced to look beyond the aspect of God in the divine οικονομία as was his counterpart in the West. Very briefly, then, in the East the essence-energies distinction embodies a relationship between God and the world that is not based 54. For référencés see K. Ware, op. cit., p. 135.</page><page sequence="21">APOPHASIS 25 on symbols; it is a real presence. In the West, the rôle of the symbol manifestating the presence of God has assumed a much greater importance, and although God can be said to be présent in création, this presence is not normally regarded as equal to the self-presence of God, as he exists in himself apart from création. (According to C. Yannaras, we in the West have banished God to the transcendent realm of the heavens, thus creating for ourselves a sort of spiritual schizophrenia55). It is for this reason that I would argue that the radical negative theologian belongs properly to the Western tradition of theology. Those who adopted the initial stance of regarding the nature of God as totally transcendent were forced to seek beyond the symbol and enter into the barren desert of the Godhead, because there was no supporting doctrine of the rôle of the energies of God to qutiiv^u uitn um »ι ιυι uit ui vjuu. This brings me to my third point, which concerns the more obviously apophatic or mystical character of the Orthodox theological tradition. This is a much less disputable point, yet a very forceful one in the parting of Eastern and Western ways. The Eastern theologian has always openly admitted that God is transcendent and unknowable, while his Western colleague has always tried to find something positive to say about God, lest belief be left with the pure nothingness of négation. However, I would like to add that, although the terms 'mystic' and 'apophatic' cannot be said actually to characterize vv caici il uicuiugy, wnai me y muiuaic is nunc uic icss presciu, iiiuugn admitedly less explicitly so, due to our neatly confined définition and indeed at times misunderstanding, of those terms. Meister Eckhart and Symeon the New Theologian The final part of my paper concerns an examination and comparison of Symeon and Eckhart. Although nearly three hundred years separate the two, their external lives, surprisingly, contain very similar détails. Both were preachers, spiritual teachers, and theologians; both held positions of authority within their religious communities, and both came into conflict with ecclesiastical authority. Symeon 55. Op. cit., p. 288.</page><page sequence="22">26 RECHERCHES DE THÉOLOGIE ANCIENNE ET MÉDIÉVALE appeared before the Holy Synod, in 1008-09, and Eckhart before Archbishop Henry of Virneburg, in 1326. Eckhart appealed to Papal authority, but died before he was publicly condemned, in 1329, by Pope John XXII56. Both men display a vibrant and intimate experience of God, and both have been called mystics. The texts I have used for Symeon comprise the Three Theological Discourses and the Practical and Theological Chapters51, and for Eckhart, a cross-section of the German treatises and sermons, together with some Latin commentaries58. Basically, both men agree that God is primarily unknowable, unnameable, invisible, ineffable, inexpressible, incompréhensible, and so on. He is therefore beyond speech and thought. In Eckhart's case we find an interesting dialectical method at work, for God is both heine and non-heine: he is mire heine in himself and alsn nnn-heine because he is not the being of créatures. To deny being of God in the sense of ens (formally created being) is to affirm esse absolutum, which is an affirmation in the highest sense possible59. I have also noted similarities in both writers concerning the path men ought to take to reach God ; not unusually, this begins with the practice of purification. Purification is, of course, a basic Christian teaching, but it is the radical nature of their doctrine of purification which sets Eckhart and Symeon apart. Man must be dead to the world, he must flee from it, be indifferent to it and hate it. He must have no attachment to it whatsoever, even for good motives. Symeon calls this άπαθεία, while for Eckhart it is the practise of Abgeschieden heit. Ultimately, man must attain to purity of heart, an important theme in both writers60. Eckhart takes the idea of purity, even intellectual purity to such an extreme, that man must strive to know 56. For the text of the Papal Bull, In agro dominico', see n. 46 above. 57.

While both men agree on the starting point and the goal, in between they differ, indeed quite notably in places. For Eckhart, the process of knowing God consists in ridding oneself of all earthly, finite limitations, including the ways of traditional speech about God. That is why he cannot say, with Scottus, that God is good in any way62, because goodness belongs to the realm of finitude; rather, I am good, God is not good63. God must not be understood solely as prptitnr r*f mar» Kppancp V»#» pyi ctpri οΙλπρ onrl in Viimcalf ΚρΓαγρ Vip created anything64. Therefore, to understand God properly, man must go beyond the idea of God obtained from finite things. For Symeon, on the other hand, it is because God is so incompréhensible in himself that we must look for another way to reach him, and this way takes us through création, for the gift of knowing God is given to us by signs, enigmas, révélations, and veiled illuminations65. We must study these things, therefore, in order to corne to a knowledge of God. However, as the knowledge of God develops within us, it becomes the cause and the agent of our ignorance concerning him66. To ill us träte this point, Symeon uses the beautiful image of a man standing by the sea: at first he stands and looks, appreciating the opposition between the vastness of the sea and himself; then, as he ventures into the water, he becomes part of it, still knowing that he is part of it; finally, as he plunges in completely, he no longer sees anyinmg, oui ne Knows mai ne îs in lis depuis u '. so too with the soul and God. The whole focus of attention here is on experience and not on intellect, or the measurement of knowledge, much in the same way that Eckhart focuses on relationship with the Godhead rather than knowledge of God. To return for a moment to Eckhart's rather strange-sounding terminology: "While I stood in my first cause, I had no God ... But 61. Beati pauperes spiritu. 62. Periphyseon I, 459 c-d. 63.

Ibid. 11-14.</page><page sequence="24">28 RECHERCHES DE THÉOLOGIE ANCIENNE ET MÉDIÉVALE when créatures came into existence and received their created being, then God was not 'God' in himself— He was 'God' in créatures68". This is the basis for Eckhart's distinction between Gottheit and Gott, Godhead and God69, which may be understood to correspond roughly to Symeon's distinction between the essence of God and his energies. Gott is the principle of création, whereas Gottheit does no work70. Unlike Symeon, therefore, who is content to look for his communion with God through God's energies, Eckhart looks beyond God as the principle of création. Even in the name 'Trinity', Eckhart nnas nnuuae oeyona wnicn tne soui wants to go, in oraer to enter tne formless desert of the Godhead71. For Symeon, the names of God are also his energies, and the names and titles we use can also be applied to us, although in a human way72. For Eckhart, ail names are primarily derived from human nature; in this he relies on proposition six from the Liber de causis, ail that we understand about the first cause is more what we ourselves are, for God is the nàmeless one73. Therefore, while Symeon's union with God can undoubtedly be described as apophatic (he says: 'Fie who is blind before the One is absolutely blind before ail things, but he who sees in the One is in the contemplation of ail things')74, I would suggest that it is also quite typical of Orthodoxy, for it is a union with the energies of God, not with his unknowable essence. This is similar to John Damascene's account, in chapter one of the De fide orthodoxa: révélation is made to us of the qualities of the nature, the attributes of the essence, but not of the essence itself. So, for Symeon, the apophatic experience of God is probably more akin to that of Scottus (who insists that we can never see God, even in the beatified state, except through a theophany)75, than it is to Eckhart's. How can a man love the naked formlessness of the Godhead76? Only the man who lives 'without a why' can answer that 68. 'Beati pauperes spiritu', p. 271. 69. See 'Nolite limere' (56), p. 81. 70.

In Eckhart's State of perfect releasement, of Gelassenheit, all opposition between créature and creator vanishes, yet created nature is not assimilated into the divine; man remains, in his unity with God, like the Dionysian lamp, many fiâmes in one light77. In Eckhart's desert of the Godhead, ail opposition vanishes, much in the same way that, for Symeon, the soul is part of the depths of the sea, yet the man is aware that he is part of the sea; for Eckhart, on the other hand, the soul knows nothing, for the normal subject/object catégories, which are an essential aspect of human Cognition, are not operative on the level of Gelassenheit', therefore Eckhart can pray: I ask God to make me free of God. He has the audacity to want to go beyond the Gott of création, the energies of God, in order to enter into the uncharted area of the unknown Gottheit, something which Symeon has no need to do, or to desire. However, the fact that Eckhart, rooted as he was in traditional Scholastic theology, made the final leap beyond what God has chosen to manifest of himself, does not make the apophatic theology of Symeon any less radical. Eckhart's theology was a necessity born of his Western upbringing, as I have already explained. It is for these reasons that I believe the radical apophatic theologian who does not belong to the Orthodox Church takes apophasis beyond the limits laid down by his counter part in the East.
