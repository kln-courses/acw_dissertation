Moorey Ashmolean Museum, Oxford Something of Mesopotamia for Hayim, something of terracottas for Miriam, in appreciation of their conversation and writings over many years I. THE PROBLEM AND THE PREHISTORIC PRELUDE When so much information is provided by objets d'art and texts, it is not surprising that miniature, handmade images of clay have generally been overlooked in studies of early city-state formation in Sumer. Their prehistoric antecedents are well known. Images, particularly if cheap and ephem eral, may indicate the existence of "public" com ment both in their iconography and in the timing of their introduction and disappearance, particu larly at times of social transition. In the course of pristine state development in Sumer there was a major change of more than ordinary significance in the repertory of terracotta figurines. Now, for the first time, female figurines passed into eclipse and previously rare, often very rare, male figurines entered the repertory of miniature clay images, sometimes in close association with models of wheeled vehicles and equids. These were the dis tinctive indicators of the new male urban elite in society. By the end of the third millennium BCE female terracotta figurines had returned and the "nude female" was thereafter to be the most evi dent such image from Babylonia through Syria and Palestine to Egypt in the second millennium BCE. The photographs in this paper are reproduced by courtesy of the Visitors of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. As anthropologists have pointed out, this tern porary eclipse of female imagery is not an isolated one in the early development of complex societies. Rapp (1977), for instance, has drawn attention to the marginalization of female roles by the forces of early state formation, whilst more recently Haaland and Haaland (1996: 295) have sought to explain such new popular imagery as emerging under "vastly more complex organizational con ditions... they have meaning conferred on them in relation to elaborate and esoteric philosophical and religious systems of ideas, systems developed by an ilite of [male] cultural specialists whose social position depended on their skill in ponder ing on the mysteries of human existence and formulating penetrating ways of expressing their insights." Such an explanation privileges religion, widely defined, in the emergence of this new imagery, whereas the clay figurines of prehistory "belong in fact to the kitchen, and their existence does not imply a dominating position in any hypothetical hierarchy of gods. The same people who made clay models of fat women, painted quite different subjects on their pots..." (Sandars 1979: 111). They had been, and continued to be, regularly disposed of with all kinds of debris and rubbish from the varied activities of daily life (cf. Woolley 1976: 171-183). Consequently, in assessing the role of this new imagery and establishing whether or not the anthropomorphic figurines represented natural or supernatural beings, the potential role of socio-economic activities must be given equal weight with the impact of new state-sponsored religious cults. Even if some amongst the new</page><page sequence="2">172* P.R.S. MOOREY male elite within temple and later palace estab lishments were now literate, the majority were not. Potentially, three-dimensional clay symbols or tokens, both of animate and inanimate forms, had a multiplicity of roles, old or new and vari ously religious or secular in modern western terminology. Prehistoric Near Eastern anthropomorphic terracotta images had not been considered as po tential tokens in archives before writing until the excavation of level 6 in the Neolithic village at Tell Sabi Abyad in Syria (cf. Akkermans and Le Miere 1992; Akkermans and Duistermaat 1996). There zoomorphic and headless female figurines were associated in a single room with small clay tokens, implements of bone and stone, vessels of pottery and stone, and over one hundred and fifty stamp-sealings made in local clay, many showing on the reverse impressions of baskets to which they had been attached. The excavators explained this assemblage as elements in an archival system for storing information about transactions which, it would appear, had employed clay figurines to represent the animals and women involved. If "rituals" had been involved here, then they were as much bureaucratic and social as they were cultic, involving representations of natural rather than supernatural beings (cf., in general, Wengrow 1998). In the Ubaid Period (ca. 5000-4000 BCE) the first major period of settlement in southern Meso potamia, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic clay figurines already show some signs of standardiza don. This may indicate a degree of production outside domestic contexts, though the repertory remains varied, more varied indeed than available publications of them indicate. For the first time in Sumer clay figurines were placed in graves and explicitly male figurines appear more often, though still as a tiny ele,ment in the general rep ertory. Both males and females, now standing or reclining rather than sitting or squatting, have very similar overall body proportions, minimizing the differences between the sexes. Broad shoulders and narrow hips emphasize a tapering silhouette, whilst body decorations in paint (tattoo) and inci sion (scarification) are androgynous. The females sometimes nurse babies and at least one explicitly male figure holds a phallic scepter (cf. Forest 1996: Pis. 29-32). It is as if emphasis were being given to the female role as nurturer (mater) rather than as generator (genetrix): a phenomenon com plemented by the overall rarity of the "pregnant" female images so common in the previous Halaf Period in northern Mesopotamia. The sometimes very striking cranial deformations and exaggerated facial features of the Ubaid terracottas had been anticipated earlier (cf. Oates 1966); but some faces are now so extremely stylized that they may rep resent masks. In marked contrast to the villages of Sumer in the fifth millennium BCE, those of the fourth are still strikingly devoid of miniature terracotta im ages in the archaeological record (cf. Barrelet 1968: 58; Spycket 1992: 16; McAdam in Green 1993: 88). On the rare occasions when they have been reported, they are crude and of low quality compared with the Ubaid repertory. The interpre tation of this relative absence of production, as at present it appears to be, is not obvious. If anthro pomorphic figurines, for instance, were not always — or only — a mere reflection of gender ideologies, then the discontinuities in their manu facture are no less important than their continuing use across centuries for understanding their social roles (cf. Tringham and Conkey 1998: 43). Cau tion is, however, necessary before drawing any far-reaching general conclusions from a dearth of evidence which may be more archaeological than real. The data are virtually confined to two out standing early urban sites, one at Uruk (cf. Ziegler 1962) in Sumer and the other at Susa (cf. Spycket 1992) in Elam. Both have been extensively exca vated, but primarily in areas of public buildings rather than households, where handmade clay fig urines may most often have been used and dis posed of at this time as earlier. Two trends have recently revitalized the study of humanoid clay figurines: deconstructions of reductionist explanations of them as representative of a supposed universal cult of a "Fertility or Mother-Goddess" (cf. Goodison and Morris 1998) and closely related discussions of their possible identification as individuals from within the com munities where they were made, used and dis carded (cf. Bailey 1994). There has also been an</page><page sequence="3">ACCOUNTING FOR SUMERIAN TERRACOTTA FIGURINES 173H increasing focus on a multiplicity or plurality in their functions and meanings. Ucko (1962; 1968) pioneered the use of arguments relying on ethno graphic analogies in elucidating these in general terms. Voigt (1983: 186-191) subsequently tern pered his optimism with caution. As she pointed out, at every stage and in every culture, the com mon human experiences, which humanoid terracotta images particularly reflect, have been modified by specific socio-economic conditions. Contexts and associations are consequently fun damental in any attempt to establish the social role of figurines, and to account for the significant fact that so many were discarded, battered and broken, as rubbish. In the Near East, closed contexts, such as graves and shrines, are much rarer than is often assumed. An understanding of routine waste dis posal practices is in many respects more relevant to the study of the identity and function of the majority of ancient Near Eastern terracotta images than a knowledge of cult practices. They were clearly disposable objects, often perhaps rapidly made and quickly dispensed with, suggesting that they had rarely, if ever, been "consecrated" reli gious images in the special ritual sense later evi dent in Mesopotamia (cf. Dick 1999). Π. THE EARLY DYNASTIC REPERTORY (CA. 3000-2350 BCE) 1. Female Images When terracotta miniature figurines re-appear in the archaeological record late in the fourth mil lennium BCE, a marked rarity of females is evi dent by contrast with the previous prehistoric repertory. The best dated examples remain those from excavations in the Diyala Valley in the 1930s. Dales (1960: Nos. 72-79; cf. Frankfort 1936: Fig. 57) conveniently assembled a selection of them dating from Early Dynastic I (ca. 3000-2750 BCE). They share a number of distinc tive characteristics, which have at present no known parallels earlier or later in Sumer. They are shown standing, with stylized wing-shaped upper bodies. Whether this indicates outstretched arms or arms bent to support the breasts (as later) is not clear. The whole body is flat and fiddle-shaped. The applied slit eyes, set at various angles, recall the inlaid cowrie-shell eyes of remote prehistory. Representation of the pubic area as circular, rather than as triangular, is distinctive. Some of these terracottas may be conveniently grasped in the palm of the hand. This is not a notable feature of earlier or later handmade Sumerian figurines. This feature may be related to the fact that at this time flat, highly stylized female figurines of stone, the so-called "Cycladic Type," had penetrated central Mesopotamia (cf. Diyala: Frankfort 1934: 73, Fig. 63; 1935: 27, Figs. 24, 28; Gawra: Speiser 1935: Pis. LIIIb:3, LIVa; Nuzi: Starr 1937: PI. 57 N-S.X; 1939: 383). Contexts, where evident, are varied; but rarely sufficiently "closed" to be significant indicators of function. The figurines appear to be nude; a persistent feature is the attention paid by modelers to their hair. Indeed, holes pierced round the upper perim eter of flat stylized faces may have been made to accommodate actual strands of hair, as they were later in Egypt (cf. Pinch 1993: PI. 46D; cf. Frank fort 1936: Fig. 57d). An obscurely published terracotta head of a woman (Fig. 1) excavated by Mackay (1931: Pis. 8-9) at Kish, though precisely where on the site is unknown, may be attributed, through a more fragmentary example from the same excavations, to Early Dynastic I (Watelin 1934: 10, PI. XIII 1-2). Here slit-shaped eyes are combined with an exotic fan-shaped hair-style more reminiscent of later terracotta figures from Syria and Mesopotamia dated to the Early Bronze Age IV to the Middle Bronze Age I, at the end of the third millennium BCE, rather than of anything earlier. When female terracottas were made there after through the Early Dynastic Period, they are to be found amongst tiny, crude humanoid figu rines without explicit sexual characteristics, as at Abu Salabikh (cf. McAdam in Green 1993: 84-85). 2. Men, Vehicles and Equids At both Kish and Ur in the Early Dynastic Period I terracotta images were recovered from rubbish tips whose exact source is obscure. None were reported in associated graves. At Ur, Woolley (1956: 37; cf. 1934: 14) reported thus: "crude clay figurines of men and animals are common, and so are clay wheels and models of chariot bodies. The</page><page sequence="4">174* P.R.S. MOOREY Ps/ Fig. 1. Detached head of terracotta female figurine (front and back), Kish, Iraq; ca. 3000 BCE (after Mackay 1931, plate; present whereabouts unknown); ca. 5 cm. high fact that they were associated with jar-sealings and tablets, which are apparently thrown out from a temple store should mean that they were votive objects not toys... With them occur numerous examples of rough hand-made model vases." Even if the recurrent suggestion that terracotta objects were children's playthings is rarely, if ever, pos sible to refute conclusively in any particular case, in all cases cited here neither contexts nor as so ciated objects sustain such an identification. McAdam (in Green 1993: 88-89) has restudied many of the terracotta figurines Woolley kept, among which she recognized only one female against a number of males. There were two rec ognizable pigs, one or two possible bovids, nine teen recognizable sheep or goats; but significantly no equids. These figurines were associated with some of the oldest clay model vehicles yet re corded, primarily two rather than four-wheeled chariots for one driver (Woolley 1956: 28, PI. 24). Terracotta images comparable to those from Ur in the Early Dynastic Period I were found at Kish (Tell Ingharra) in the so-called "Early Houses Stratum" (EHS) in the Y-Sounding (cf. Moorey 1978: 99-103). Little detail was recorded about them at the time of excavation, but surviving figurines indicate a common set of characteristics. The prevalent human forms were pillar-shaped, handmade male figurines, their sex indicated by beards rather than genitals (Fig. 2); some are pierced vertically in the base, perhaps confirming Watelin's view that they were miniature "chariot eers" to be mounted on the associated model chariots. Significantly, various domesticated Fig. 2.

Watelin 1934: 10ff., 33, PI. XIV; Moorey 1978: 104-110). Zarins (1986: 71) reported that the skeletal remains of equids associated with the "chariot-burials" cut down into the "Early Houses Stratum" were of quite small animals. They fall within the E.asinus-E.hemionus hemippus range, more prob ably the former. It is, however, possible that hy bridization, involving asses and half-asses (ona gers), if not yet the horse, was already practised. Zarins (1976: 290) observed that "many (of the figurines)... could pass for caballines if the mane and tail were clearly rendered." As at Ur, sealings and miniature vessels, and possibly also clay to kens, were associated in this debris with terracottas; but the methods of excavation, recov ery and publication were too crude to allow for any specific information on their relationship to have survived. Two contexts are primary points of reference at present for terracotta images in Early Dynastic III (ca. 2600-2350 BCE), both from its later phase: al-Hiba (area C) and Abu Salabikh (6G Ash-Tip). At al-Hiba, excavations revealed a vast complex of over ninety haphazardly arranged small rooms, perhaps offices and workshops, to judge from the objects found in them. They were identified as part either of an as yet unidentified palace or of the temple of Ningirsu (Bagara). Terracotta figu rines were found scattered in very small numbers across the whole complex (cf. Bahrani 1989: י 1183' i■■ ■■ "V• , י Fig. 3. Terracotta equid with head harness from Mound A (Tell Ingharra), Kish, Iraq; ca. 2900-2650 BCE (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford: 1925.147); ca. 3.5 cm. high 417-422). An unusually high proportion of model boat fragments (Bahrani 1989: PI. LXVII.l), in relation to that of chariots, reflects the fact that transport by water would have been more practical for the elite in this part of southern Iraq. None of the anthropomorphic figurines was obviously fe male. The preliminary reports do not make clear to what extent these terracottas were directly as sociated with the sealings and miniature vessels also reported from this complex. Bahrani's as sumption that all these clay miniatures were toys is far less probable in such a context than that they had been made and used by adults for their own purposes, as Woolley concluded at Ur. Ochsen schlager's (1974) study of the sun-baked clay toys made by local village children at the time of these excavations at al-Hiba is interesting in its own right; howeuer, it is not analogous to the ancient context. The association of miniature clay figurines of human beings, animals and vehicles with sealings and tablets in buildings that may or may not have been dwellings is more coherently and plausibly explained by bureaucratic procedures and rituals, as is evident from the debris in the "Ash-Tip" excavated in area 6G at Abu Salabikh. This rub bish is broadly contemporary with that at al-Hiba but from an unlocated building assumed to be a temple in the excavation reports. In addition to terracotta figures the Abu Salabikh deposit in eluded sealings (amongst which door-peg sealings were most common), miniature pottery, terracotta disks ("tokens") and atypical pottery shapes, as well as stone vessels, ground and chipped stone tools, and human, animal and plant remains (Green 1993). In many ways this rubbish disposal area is reminiscent of the "Seal Impression Strata" centuries earlier in Ur. In her careful study of the terracotta images from this "Ash-Tip," McAdam (in Green 1993: 83-109, Fig. 3:1-18) listed 47 anthropomorphic figurines, none with explicit female characteris tics. Eight were shown wearing male garments, some of high status type. Among 81 identifiable zoomorphic terracottas were nine pigs, sixteen equids, eleven sheep/goats and one possible dog. No bovids were recognized. Twelve animals had male genitals represented. Eight model two-wheel</page><page sequence="6">176* P.R.S. MOOREY chariots were recorded, four model yoke frag ments and 26 model wheels. McAdam (in Green 1993: 91) argued that "the crudeness of manufac ture and the short period of use... indicate that the actual act of making the figurine, rather than the quality of the likeness, was the significant part of the ritual... they suggest that the ritual in question was practiced exclusively by men, probably men of high status." In summarizing the evidence pro vided by sealings Martin and Matthews (in Green 1993: 42) remarked that "this functional make-up reflects extensive control over store-rooms in the building from which the Ash-Tip material origi nated, with low level opening of sealed goods." The fact that the original context of these ac tivities at Abu Salabikh is a matter of deduction rather than of demonstration, as is so often the case with Near Eastern terracotta images, has led to conflicting interpretations of their original pur pose, polarized around the distinction between "sacred" and "secular" in the use of space that may have had little relevance at the time. Allow ance, moreover, must always be made for the "multivocal potential of figurines" (Haaland and Haaland 1996: 295). Green (1993: 20-21) drew a distinction between the debris of bureaucracy from the postulated "shrine" and "the miniature pots and figurines being ex-votos submitted by worshippers and thrown away after the lapse of a suitable time." For Forest (1995-96: 284), how ever, "les quelques recueilles, et surtout les nombreux scellements ne participent eux aussi que des pratiques ce qui explique la grande diversite de sceaux utilises. Fes figurines et les vases min iatures ne peuvent etre dits cultuels... que dans la measure ou Ton ne sait pas precisement a quoi ils servaient... Le materiel decouvert devrait done etre examine dans une perspective radicalement pro fane." III. THE RE-EMERGENCE OF DISTINCTIVE FEMALE IMAGERY Even if the currently available data are insufficient to resolve such differences, it is possible to at tempt to isolate in the present body of evidence the time and context in which terracotta imagery bears the first signs of relating directly to the state-sponsored religion of the pristine city-states of Sumer, as demonstrated by a standardization of the iconography and then by mass production for use beyond the shrines of a temple. Neither of these is evident in the crude, perhaps very short-lived, terracotta figurines so far considered here. The appearance of anthropomorphic adapta tions of upright handles of pottery jars in the Early Dynastic Period II1B, when previously they had been plain or had simple incised linear designs, first introduced a degree of standardization related to a major cult. These humanoid handles are female and nude, with the face, breasts, genitals, jewelry and cross-straps between the breasts var iously depicted. The placing of the genitals on the body of the jar sometimes reinforces the humanoid form of the whole vessel (Fig. 4). A so far unique detached jar handle from grave PG/895 at Ur is modeled in the round (Woolley 1934: 162, 388; PI. 187), with one arm bent across the middle of the body, and the other hanging down the side. This is the first known appearance of the standard ג— ':־ • P .^g' י■ ■S'i , *Jk; r\ fv v \ס-\ד ^ s&amp;ti^ " \\\\:-*, צ^י . wt s'v/־,- - 1''.&gt; י ל; SS ' &lt;.• ' י ,/ / /// // \ ':?$** ' r^H$'v־':r&gt;r* ^ SS ' Si:• ;S.S1IS ■ ■. * Fig. 4.

Dales 1960: 34, No. 85). This handle is exceptional in being repaired with bitumen to secure the head back on after it had been broken off. The large number of anthropomorphic upright handled jars found in Cemetery A at Kish adjacent to the temple complex at Hursagkalama (Tell Ingharra), sacred to Inanna (Ishtar), suggested from their first discovery over seventy years ago that their humanoid handles were related in some way to the cult of this goddess in the lives of people outside the temple. Contrary to many pop ular interpretations then and since, Inanna/Ishtar was not a "Mother-Goddess." On the contrary, in one of her many aspects, she was the '"unattached woman,' whether unmarried maiden or harlot, eternally free of the marriage rite" (Westenholz 1998: 74; cf. Black and Green 1992: 109). These handles are the precursors of perhaps the most popular and enduring terracotta image in Mesopo tamia and beyond, the "nude female," which Bahrani (1996: 10) has characterized thus: "the capabilities of the body in this representation of the nude are again, not child bearing and nurture, but the promise of erotic pleasure." As with all the anthropomorphic terracotta figures treated in this discussion, there is no indication that these are supernatural beings. It was in the later Akkadian Period, as Auerbach (1994: 74-76) has recently demonstrated, rather than later in the Ur III Period as previously be lieved, that nude females with their arms folded on the abdomen in low relief on plaques were first mass-produced in simple open moulds and widely distributed. The earliest examples at present are those excavated at Tell Asmar (Auerbach 1994: 74-75) and Tell al-Wilayah (Madhlum 1960: Pis. 9:9, 10:12). In the light of their archaeological contexts at Tell Asmar, which are virtually con fined to private houses, Auerbach (1994: 319) concluded that such plaques "were not originally developed in order to be used in religious set tings." Whether they were produced by religious institutions is another question. In other words, they do not appear to be votive objects, as are the human worshipper statuettes of metal and stone dedicated by members of the Early Dynastic elite, male and female, in the shrines of temples, which when obsolete were carefully buried in a pit and not simply thrown out at random in rubbish tips like the terracottas. With the introduction of one-piece moulds to mass produce terracottas, radical changes in imagery are evident (cf. Opificius 1961). They greatly increase to embrace both evidently supernatural and cer tainly natural subjects in the late third and early second millennium BCE. The earlier handmade terracottas discussed in this paper had apparently been made for other purposes. There is no reason to think that they were devotional objects in con ception or in use. They were neither substitutes for images in more precious materials nor used for the same purposes, within temples, as ilite works of art. The model chariots, for instance, are everyday vehicles, not specialized "chariots of the gods" like those with mould-made religious im agery produced in the Isin-Larsa and Old Babylo nian Periods (cf. Stone 1993). Early Dynastic terracottas had functions in daily life like the seals and other utilitarian objects often found with them. Indeed, their uses may well have been acquired after manufacture and consequently varied. If their purposes were socially determined and not inher ent in them, it is hardly surprising that they remain enigmatic, and will remain so, except in unusually well-preserved primary contexts.</page><page sequence="8">178* P.R.S.
