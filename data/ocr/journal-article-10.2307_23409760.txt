Kjellgren \.A.(J.A., 1 he Metropolitan Museum ot Art, New York &lt;ragile Iraditions brings together an important series if essays on the impact of the "primitive art" mar Let on the artistic traditions of Indonesia's indige ious peoples. Edited by Paul Taylor of the imithsonian Institution with a horeword by iuwati Cartiwa of the Indonesian National Museum, the look explores the effects of large-scale collecting on . broad range of indigenous societies from an equal y broad range of contributors, ranging from collec ors and development consultants to art historians, nthropologists and deconstructionists. In his introduction iaylor sets torth two themes .vhich weave through the essays that follow: the external threats to artistic traditions posed by the 'primitive art" market and the internal threats posed Dy government policies, which often imperil or ;oopt local traditions in their effort to create a -irnarl-hacpiH narinnal irlpnrirv. Tavlor then nroceerls with a sort of self-deconstruction, examining the discourses on the "fragility" of "traditional" art that Dccur in both the art market and the book itself. He concludes that, while the older pieces valued by the irt market are essentially being "strip mined" from the societies that produced them, modified art c ...i—i i. c i i i .1,..:., ing and that neither art nor the cultures that pro duce it are in any absolute sense "fragile." The sec tion ends with a brief biography of each contributor and summaries of their papers. In Chapter 2 art historian Kuth barnes examines :he social consequences of the loss of heirloom tex :iles required for marriage among the Lamaholot people of Lembata, Solor, Adonara, and East Flores. Presenting Lamaholot perspectives gathered during extensive fieldwork, she shows that, while other tex tiles are now used in place of heirloom examples, there is growing apprehension that the meaning of the textiles and the traditions surrounding their weaving are being lost as the old textiles go and women explore new career opportunities. Barnes July 1995 147</page><page sequence="2">also raises the important ethical issue of how schol arly research on an artistic tradition, including her own work on the Lamaholot, can contribute to its destruction by making it known at the art market. While the Lamaholot textiles were willingly sold to outsiders, Chapter 3 documents a case of outright theft. Here, anthropologist Eric Crystal explores the cultural impact of the theft of tau tau (ancestral effi gicb; iiuiii nie uunai unis oi ine loraja people or Sulawesi. He documents the emotional distress caused by the loss of the original images as well as the impact of mass tourism and the efforts of Indonesian authorities to commission reproduction tau tau to be placed in the cliffs to give the tourists something to look at. Concluding that local law enforcement is inadequate to prevent the looting of tau tau, he calls on museum curators and collectors to be aware of the impact of the loss on the Toraja and rerrain from acquiring further examples. In Chapter 4 art historian Jerome reldman traces the evolving styles of Nias Island sculpture artifacts resulting from nearly a century of missionary influ ence and collector demand. Feldman observed that, while ancestral sculpture, the main focus of both missionaries and the art market, has underpone sip nificant changes in response to pressure from both, 3ther forms have remained little changed and items of high aesthetic quality are still being produced. reiaman aiso nas a Dit or run ar tne art marKets expense, pointing out that relatively modern carv ings occasionally appear in auction catalogues as highly touted "traditional" pieces, belying the con ventional equation of age with artistic merit. ^napter 5 Drines a contribution rrom leading col lector Jean Paul Barbier, founder of the Barbier Muller Museum in Geneva where he serves as direc tor. Barbiers essay focuses on the ethical issues sur rounding collecting when members of a society, such as the Batak of Sumatra, decide that they no îungci nccu iiluLii 01 tiicir trauiuonai art ana either discard it or sell it off.

Given the fact that for a variety of reasons local museums often show little interest in acquiring the material, Barbier contends that, in this context, the sale of art to outsiders has often saved it from disappearing altogether. Chapter 6 examines the role of Indonesia's muse ums in the preservation and representation of indigenous artistic traditions. In it, anthropologist Paul Taylor discusses issues surrounding the repre sentation and coopting of indigenous cultures aris ing from government policy on the form and nature of museum exhibits. He also examines the mount ing problems caused by lack of resources as collec tions accumulate in museums that often have little încaiio wi iiiaiuiaiiiniji iiiv_ni. A development-oriented approach to the demands of the art market is proposed by develop ment consultant Laurence A. G. Moss in Chapter 7. A welcome addition to his earlier work on the region (Moss 1986), the chapter focuses on how the expand ing interest in "tribal" art in the 1980s lead to a grow ing demand for material from the Lesser Sunda Islands. The result was a massive outflow of textiles and other objects to the West. While noting that market forces have discouraged weavers through inadequate compensation, Moss sees the market as :„1U. 1 ». .1 : 1 .r :i J — —" «•« »'VOU.U,ai VI ^Alia vvvavx 115 traditions. He argues that if an adequate compensa tion scheme can be implemented, the external mar ket for quality textiles may make "traditional" tex tile production economically viable. ( ho rîkU ,,kl: :ation of anthropologist Michael Heppell's (1989) article on the state ofDayak art in Borneo. Heppell surveys the "traditional" role and current status of :hree major Dayak art forms; anthropomorphic sculpture, textiles, and masks; providing ethno graphic background on each. In the end he con dudes that much of the cultural rationale for pro iucing these art forms has disappeared and been eplaced with the production of "tourist" art and :hat, hence, Dayak art is in "the final stages of a slow, :erminal illness." In the rinal chapter anthropologist Shelly irrington takes a deconstructionist approach; jnravelling the narratives of scholars (including the luthors of the previous chapters) and the travel ndustrv on the art of Indonesia's indigenous neo jles. Like other contemporary theorists (cf. Kasfir :992, Price 1989) Errington is quick to note the per vasive "before and after" scenario of the narratives _ i_:_L — J 1 r. ... ii ry îiivii vuiluiv anu ai i UV.1ULv_ cuiiLdLl dit ;ented as authentic and pristine and after as unau hentic and spoiled. Following Clifford (1988), Srrington also examines the intellectual transfor 4« racihc Arts</page><page sequence="3">mation of objects from indigenous cultures into "art" and the resulting cultural milieu which sur rounds them. She then discusses use of the assertion that indigenous arts are "dying out" as a rationaliza tion for hastening their demise through collection and as the basis for notions of rarity and value. Lastly she describes the role of art objects in narratives on national "heritage" and identity. As Taylor points out in his introduction Fragile Traditions helps to fill a notable gap in contempo rary research on indigenous art. While there are now a number ofworks on the "primitive art" market and the impact of indigenous art on the West (cf. Steiner 1994, Price 1989, Vogel 1991), there has been little research, apart from the work of Graburn (1976), on the impact of the market on the cultures themselves. As the essays collected here illustrate, the issues involved are complex with no simple rules or obvi ous ethical "high ground." While Irian Jaya is conspicuous by its absence, the book provides solid contributions from the other major areas of indigenous Indonesia. It gives a broad overview of the topic, which invites a closer exami nation of both common themes (such as the devel opment or tourist art; as wen as individual dirrer ence. Although, ideally, more input from the indige nous peoples themselves would certainly be desir able, one of the best features of the book is the diver sity of perspectives it presents. In an era where "multivocality" often consists of printing similar viewpoints by people from diverse backgrounds, it is refreshingly broad in its scope. Although some of the perspectives are undoubtedly controversial, even ethically questionable, they are all thoughtful and treated in an even-handed manner. The willingness rn 1er the reader iudpe for him or herself, combined with the broad coverage and quality of the individ ual contributions, makes Fragile Traditions worth reading both for scholars of Indonesian art and any one interested in the dynamics and ethics of the "primitive art" market.
