St. John's University Collegeville, MN 56321 The process by which boundaries in communities are formed and maintained necessarily involves the engagement of the human heart and mind. Building walls or moving to a new location is often not a possible response to conflict. The prophet Ezekiel understood that such engagement was necessary to deal constructively with the formless, wild, and chaotic moments of collective and individual human experience. As a Zadokite priest in Jerusalem prior to his exile (presumably in 598 b.c.), Ezekiel would have carried out various responsibilities aimed at keeping the holy separate from the impure. With his prophetic call in Babylon in 593 (Ezek 1:1-3), he began to translate his priestly mentality into the rhetoric of a prophet aimed at engaging the minds and hearts of his audience.1 Boundary-keeping was not merely a matter of following traditional rules; it was much more a matter of creating an internalized, dynamic vision of life where the covenant with Yhwh was the central, determining relationship for the exilic community. To engage the conscious and unconscious dimensions of human experience and to foster reflection upon the ways that the divine and human interact, Ezekiel drew upon imagery and iconography from Israel and its ancient Near Eastern 1 Margaret S. Odell, "You Are What You Eat: Ezekiel and the Scroll," JBL 117 (1998) 229-48, here 235. As a priest without a sanctuary, Ezekiel had increasingly to carry out his ministry on a spiritual, visionary level; see John M. Lundquist, The Temple: Meeting Place of Heaven and Earth (London: Thames and Hudson, 1993) 5; Steven S. Ibell, "Divine Presence and Absence in Ezekiel's Prophecy," in The Book of Ezekiel: Theological and Anthropological Perspectives (ed.

A particularly important iconographie image in Ezekiel' s prophetic message is the cherub. Although this word is more frequently used in the plural and applied to those beings that form and direct Yhwh' s throne chariot, the references to the cherub in the singular (9:3; 10:4, 7; 28:14, 16) raise questions about the identity and role of this figure and show the metaphoric or symbolic power of this image to hold in tension royal, priestly, and prophetic dimensions of the Israelite tradition. This capacity to balance different, often competing, religious, social, and political visions makes the cherub an important agent in forming boundaries within Ezekiel' s prophetic imagination. The ambiguity of the figure of the cherub surfaces in Ezek 28:1-19, where the cherub's role of symbolizing the transcendent source of the authority of the king of Tyre recedes and the king of Tyre co-opts the cherub's function as guardian by dangerously claiming sovereign authority and divine status for himself (28:2). The integration of the divine into the community was inhibited by a king who served no longer as a channel for the divine into the community but rather as a barrier to it. The community needed the divine presence as symbolized by the cherub. Ezekiel' s judgment against the king of Tyre is a criticism of monarchy's capacity to promote the integration of the divine into the relationships of the community. Some ancient Near Eastern peoples viewed their kings as divine rather than as symbols of transcendent divine authority. Ezekiel criticizes the king of Tyre and then later proclaims a new means of integrating the divine into the lives of the people of the Israelite community, whereby the sovereignty of Yhwh will be honored rather than co-opted (36:22-32). This new means will be God's trans- planting their hearts and giving them a share in his Spirit (36:26-27).2 This article examines the symbolic or metaphoric character of the cherub in Ezek 28:1-19 in its function as a boundary-keeper in the visionary world of the priest-prophet Ezekiel. When the metaphoric or symbolic truth of the cherub was intact, Yhwh was honored as divine sovereign and the blessings of divine rule were communicated to the human community. When the cherub's metaphoric or symbolic character was covered over, the cherub became an idol that needed to be removed from the sanctuary and replaced by a more direct form of divine intervention to sustain the boundary between the divine and the human and pro- mote communication between them (36:22-32). 2 I am reading Ezek 28:1-19 and 36:22-32 holistically as Ezekielian compositions; see Daniel Block, The Book of Ezekiel: Volume 2, Chapters 25-48 (NICOT; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1997) 88-90, 343; Moshe Greenberg, Ezekiel 21-37: A new translation with introduction and commentary (AB 22A; New York: Doubleday, 1997) 577, 589, 593, 737-40.

The Cherub: Boundary-Keeper between the Divine, the Human, and the Animal The cherub in the OT was a composite being with human and animal charac- teristics. It was a winged creature, either a biped or a quadruped,3 that had three distinctive roles: (1) to guard the source of life (Gen 3:24); (2) to draw the chariot of God (Ps 18:11 = 2 Sam 22: II;4 Ezek 1:5-20; 10:1-22); and (3) to serve as the throne for God (1 Kgs 6:23-28; 8:6-8).5 In Ezekiel, the cherub is a single figure in 9:3; 10:4, 7; and 28:14, 16. In 10:7 one cherub is singled out from the four cherubim of the divine chariot as the one who hands a burning coal from the midst of the cherubim to a man clothed with linen, a scribal figure who was to execute judgment against Jerusalem.6 In 28:14 an "anointed cherub" ( kěrub mimsah )7 functioned as a guardian (hassokēk) within the garden of Eden,8 where, analogous 3 D.

Ps 18:11) reflects a common ancient Near-Eastern view of having a deity stand on a bull or a lion. 5 Freedman and O'Connor, "kerub," TDOT, 1. 312-13. 6 John Strong ("God's Kabod: The Presence of Yahweh in the Book of Ezekiel," in The Book of Ezekiel: Theological and Anthropological Perspectives [ed.

I would contend that the continuity between the cherub of Ezekiel 28 and the cherubim of the divine chariot in Ezekiel 1 and 10 should not be dismissed, although distinctive functions are described in each account. 7 Alternatively, if mimšah is derived from mšh II with Aramaic and Akkadian cognates, then the form can be revocalized as mamšuh and translated as "protecting, shielding," resembling the cherubim with outstretched wings (cf. 1 Kgs 6:27); see H.

Van Dijk, Ezekiel's Prophecy on Tyre (Ez. 26,1-28,19 ): A New Approach (BibOr 20; Rome: Biblical Institute, 1968) 119; Yaron, "Dirge over the King of Tyre," 32. 8 Block, Book of Ezekiel, 2. 113; James Miller, "The Maelaek of Tyre (Ezekiel 28, 11-19)," ZAW 105 (1993) 497-501, here 499.</page><page sequence="4">168 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 65, 2003 to Gen 3:24, one of the cherub's responsibilities may have been the protection of the vegetation or fertility of the garden.9 The functions of protecting vegetative life, transporting a deity, and enthroning a divine or human sovereign are attested for cherub-like figures in Mesopotamia and Phoenicia.10 In the Mesopotamian tradition, there were numerous composite supernatural beings with human and animal characteristics, for example, the Snake- dragon, the Long-haired Hero, the Bull-man. 1 1 These composite beings were orderly when associated with a particular god; but when separated from a god and opera- ting independently, they were rebels that could upset the order of the inhabited world.12 Cherub figures also played an important role in the iconography of Phoeni- cia, where they formed thrones for gods and kings.13 The Phoenician practice of enthroning both a divine and a human king on a cherub made clear that the cherub marked out a special location where the divine and human intermingle in a mea- sure beyond that of typical human experience. The function of serving as a throne for a divine sovereign finds a parallel in the Israelite tradition where Yhwh's throne in the innermost part of the temple was formed by two adjoining cherubim of monumental size (1 Kgs 6:23-28; 8:6-8). Israelite practice seems to have departed from that of the Phoenicians, however, in that the iconography of the human king's throne, according to 1 Kgs 10:18-19, was not the same as that of the heavenly divine king: Solomon's throne was not in the form of a composite being like the cherub but merely had lions on the arms and steps of the throne.14 The power of the cherub for shaping the religious and political imagination is evident in the two critical boundaries at which the cherub was stationed: (1) the 9 Freedman and O'Connor, " kerub TDOT, 7. 307-19, here 310-11; Ronald Hendel, " 'The Flame of the Whirling Sword': A Note on Gen 3:24," JBL 104 (1985) 671-74. 10 Bloch-Smith, "Solomon's Temple: The Politics of Ritual Space," 85-86. 11 F.

The maintenance of these boundaries, which is essential to the integrity of communal and individual life, requires that the distinct spheres that they touch be held together in a tensive union where appropriate intermingling and exchange occur.15 The faces of the cherub in Ezekiel - that of a human, a lion, an ox, and an eagle (1:10; 10:14) - testify to the powerful, often conflicting forces that come together in human experience to shape and maintain relational boundaries.16 The ambiguity surrounding the cherub figure in Ezek 28: 14 concerns not only its role as boundary-keeper but also its identity in this passage.17 The cherub's composite animal and human form signals both its dual potential for protection or danger and its power to point to either the true sovereign or a usurper. In Ezek 28:14, two identifications are grammatically possible for the cherub: (1) If the word 5 att in the MT is read as a rare form of the second masculine singular pronoun "you," then the cherub would be the king of Tyre. 18 (2) If ^att is read as &gt;et, "with," as in the LXX and Syriac, then the cherub would be an independent supernatural being that accompanied the king of Tyre in Eden and symbolized the presence of Yhwh, the one who created the king of Tyre and owns Eden (28: 13). 19 In both of these renderings, the cherub in Ezekiel 28 symbolizes the sovereign over Tyre.20 The dangerous ambiguity concerns which sovereign is meant: the earthly king of Tyre or the heavenly king, Yhwh, on the mountain of God (28:12; cf. 20:33; 34:11-16). According to Ezekiel 28, the prophet Ezekiel and the king of Tyre took diametrically opposed positions on who was the sovereign over Tyre. 15 Richard Nelson, Raising Up a Faithful Priest: Community and Priesthood in Biblical Theology (Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 1993) 20-25; cf.

In Ezekiel's view, the king of Tyre's claim to be sovereign and not accountable to the divine king, Yhwh, is a violation of a boundary that is punishable by death (vv. 6-10, 18). However, insofar as a historical king of Tyre is reflected in this oracle, he may be giving voice to a Tyrian royal tradition in which the king was regarded as a god.24 Remnants of the rhetoric of the court in Jerusalem suggest that kings in the Davidic line may have been regarded by some of the people as gods: for example, "Your throne, O God, shall endure forever" (Ps 45:7; cf. Pss 2:7; 82:5-7). There could have been instances of a court rhetoric in the kingdoms of the Levant, analogous to that of a number of Mesopotamian kingdoms from 2750 to 2250 b.c.,25 that conferred divine status on the king. Egypt's long-standing practice of incorporating its pharaoh into the ranks of the gods (see Ezek 29:3, 9)26 may also have influenced the self- understanding of the king of Tyre. This pretension to divine status may have been a factor in Ezekiel' s devoting seven of the eight chapters of his "Oracles against the Nations" (Ezekiel 25-32) to issues concerning the kingdoms of Tyre and Egypt.27 Ezekiel directly opposes the Tyrian king's claim to divine status and identifies such hubris as the underlying cause of his imminent demise. 21 Here nãgíd is a synonym for melek, "king" ; see Tomoo Ishida, History and Historical Writing in Ancient Israel : Studies in Biblical Historiography (SHCANE 16; Leiden: Brill, 1999) 61, 66-67. 22 Van Dijk (Ezekiel' s Prophecy on Tyre, 94-95) identifies the king's self-promotion as a version of the courtly monologue (cf. Isa 10:7-8) as explained by G. von Rad ( Theology of the Old Testament [2 vols.; New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1962-65] 2. 180 n. 10). 23 Hugh R.

Terms for "heart" ( lēb or lēbāb) occur nine times in 28:1-19, with eight of these occurrences in the opening oracle of judgment, vv. 1-10. The king of Tyre has claimed to be a god from his residence or place of enthronement in "the heart of the seas" (v. 2). If the sea is understood as a symbol of chaos, then it appears that Ezekiel is playing on the word "heart" to bring forth not simply its spatial, geo- graphical connotations but much more its social, physical meanings. The king of Tyre has set his heart like that of a god (vv. 2, 6) and so made his heart high (gābal i, vv. 2, 5). It is ironic that the king of Tyre would have based his divine status on his holding a throne in the heart of chaos (that is, in the midst of the seas). To create a contrast to this chaotic context for the king of Tyre's throne, Ezekiel sketches out in the lament of 28: 1 1-19 the harmonious scene of the garden of Eden on the mountain of God.28 The cleverness of the king of Tyre, who engages in trade in the midst of the seas (vv. 3-5, 16), strongly contrasts with the wise rule of the personified royal signet on the mountain where Eden was located.29 This royal "signet of perfection"30 in Eden served Yhwh and did not function initially as if he were the sovereign himself.31 In the scene in Eden, the king of Tyre both "was" (figuratively) and "was not" (literally) the cherub. This metaphorical truth about the king as a servant of Yhwh points to his potential for blessing if he accepted this status or for curse if he did not. As a composite being with supernatural powers, the cherub is a negative power only if it dissociates itself from the deity it serves. As a statue or even as a being visualized through literary imagery, the cherub is more concrete than an invisible deity. Tryggve N. D. Mettinger notes that in Phoenicia there were cherubim thrones for invisible deities, which he labels "empty throne ani- conism."32 If such a practice was in place in Tyre in the early sixth century b.c., then it would have been a small step for the king of Tyre, as his wealth and power increased, to take his seat on the cherub throne and claim that he himself was the sovereign. The king of Tyre claimed, "I am a god" (28:2), but Ezekiel counters this in his Eden scene by saying, "You are a cherub" (28:14).

In Ezekiel' s eyes, the king of Tyre is a cherub who has ignored his subservience to Yhwh (28:6-10, 14-19) and so unleashed the violence ( hãmãs ) of the animal portion of his cherub character to the detriment of Tyre and its maritime empire (28:16, 18). When the king of Tyre protected and supported the sanctuary, he showed the positive face of the cherub. When the king desecrated the sanctuary through his idolatrous devotion to his commercial enterprises, he showed the negative face of the cherub by employing his supernatural powers in rebellion against God.34 The king sought the status of a god on the basis of his commercial power, fame, and wealth - factors that enhanced his status in the eyes of his peers (28:17-19) - but he failed to see his wisdom and beauty as gifts bestowed by God (28:12-15). His works captured his attention so much that he became enamored of himself and his accomplishments (28:2, 9, 17).35 Thus, when the king of Tyre as guardian cherub was dissociated from God, he exercised illegitimate power. II. The Priest: Boundary-Keeper between the Holy and the Impure In the religiously grounded civilizations of the ancient Near East, to define the human person one had to distinguish a human not only from the animals but also from the gods.36 Humans were regarded as sharing in the characteristics of both the divine sphere and the animal sphere. This task of definition was not a neutral experiment in thought, but was a pragmatic effort with serious religious and political implications. As a boundary-keeper between the realm of the gods and the human realm, the priest was charged with distinguishing between legiti- mate and illegitimate mixtures of divine, human, and animal.37 In the priestly world in which Ezekiel was reared, the dynamism of the holy was incompatible with that of the impure.38 When the holy and the impure were 33 Wiggermann, "Mischwesen A," 227-29; A.

For the well-being of the community, the impure had to be kept separate from the sphere of the holy or defilement would occur. Such defilement meant that one had taken lightly or dishonored the holy.39 Boundary formation is a relational activity in which attentiveness to the Other is essential for striking the right balance. Absorbing or exploiting the Other results in a transgression or defilement that must be purged.40 Accordingly, from the perspective of the religion and politics of Israel, an earthly ruler's absorption of divine prerogatives inevitably resulted in idolatry and exploitation of others, since the king with such ambitions would strive to acquire disproportionate amounts of wealth in order to accredit himself as a god in the eyes of those who looked on (28:4-5, 17-19). Ezekiel weaves his priestly view on the holy and the impure into the oracle of judgment that concludes the scene in Eden: "From the abundance of your iniquities in the wickedness of your trade, you desecrated your sanctuary,41 and I made fire go forth from your midst. It consumed you. I placed you as ashes upon the earth for all to see you" (28:18). The sanctuary in Tyre was desecrated not only by cultic transgressions (v. 18; cf. 5:11; 23:38-39) but also by ethical ones (28:16; cf. 18:12-13; 45:9).42 Ezekiel claims that the king of Tyre brought vio- lence against various peoples through his trade practices.43 As his commercial successes multiplied, he began to regard himself as a sovereign god accountable to no one. Ezekiel views the hubris of the king of Tyre as a dishonoring of the true sovereign, Yhwh. The fire that Yhwh sends forth from the midst of the king of Tyre (28:18) functions analogously to the fire in the midst of the cherubim of Yhwh' s throne chariot (1:13; 10:2, Ó-7).44 The blazing coals among the cherubim in 10:2, 6-7 were used to bring judgment against Jerusalem. If the king of Tyre is identified with the cherub in 28:14, it may be that there are coals in his midst ( mittôkekã , 28: 18) from which the fire comes that consumes him. The ashes of the mortal king of Tyre, either of the statue of a cherub or of a human being, were placed on the ground for all to see. This cremation of the king of Tyre resembles the burning 39 Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16, 366, 730; Wright, "Unclean and Clean (OT)," 739-40. 40 Paul Ricoeur, The Symbolism of Evil (Boston: Beacon, 1967) 35, 37; Callender, Adam in Myth and History , 188, 214-15. 41 Van Dijk (Ezekiel' s Prophecy on Tyre, 122) interprets the plural miqdašeka as "a single sanctuary with precincts." 42 Greenberg, Ezekiel 21-37, 587; Callender, Adam in Myth and History, 123; cf.

Exod 32:20; 2 Kgs 23:6, 11-12).46 Fire, as a symbol of the divine presence, reveals the ambivalence of the holy: a warming presence or a scorching punishment. Whether one has a positive or a negative experience of this fire depends on how close one draws to the fire and how attentive one is to draw upon it without daring to take over or misuse its power.47 Positive uses of fire in Ezekiel are the numinous, fiery appearance (kěmaťěh 5 ēš , 1:27; 8:2) of Yhwh enthroned on his chariot, the "coals of fire" between the cherubim of Yhwh's throne chariot, and the "stones of fire" among which the king of Tyre as a cherub moved in Eden. But most of the uses of the term "fire" in Ezekiel are negative, picturing fire as an instrument of punishment (5:4; 10:6; 15:5; 19:12, 14; 22:20, 21; 30:8, 14, 16; 38:22; 39:6). With respect to the presence of Yhwh, the cherub communicated both the stability and mobility of Yhwh. The cherub was portrayed as either transporting Yhwh by pulling his chariot into battle or fending off those who would steal the vital force of vegetation that properly belonged to the divine sphere (Gen 3:24).48 The cherub in Eden in Ezekiel 28 was a mobile guardian who moved back and forth in this space (28:14). The four cherubim of the throne chariot played a key role in coordinating the movement of the chariot that conveyed Yhwh from the Jerusalem temple to the exiles in Babylon (Ezek 1:4-28; 10:1-22) and then to the ideal reconstructed temple of Ezek 43: 1-5. 49 The geographical movement of Yhwh from the Jerusalem temple to the exiles in Babylon corresponds to an important transition in the minds and hearts of the exiles about Yhwh's presence and power.50 For Ezekiel, the priest-turned-prophet in exile from Jerusalem, the boundaries between the sacred and the profane were not lines drawn in specific geographical space but, rather, were relational realities created and maintained by human wor- shipers interacting with Yhwh. An obedient relationship to Yhwh, free from idola- try, created the proper spiritual space for an encounter with Yhwh enthroned on his mobile chariot. So also with regard to the king of Tyre, the line distinguishing 45 Block, Book of Ezekiel, 2. 104. 46 See John Kutsko, Between Heaven and Earth: Divine Presence and Absence in the Book of Ezekiel (Biblical and Judaic Studies 7; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2000) 46-47. 47 For example, the punishment of Nadab and Abihu by fire from Yhwh for offering incense on unauthorized fire (Lev 10:1-5). 48 Othmar Keel, The Symbolism of the Biblical World: Ancient Near Eastern Iconography and the Book of Psalms (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1997) 141-44. 49 Mettinger, Dethronement of Sabaoth, 32-36; cf.

III. The Desecrated Cherub: Ethical Concerns within the Confluence of Sacral and Political Power The cherub in Eden in Ezek 28: 14, 16 was appointed to reside on God's holy mountain. According to Psalms 15 and 24 and Isa 33: 14-16, it was necessary prior to entering the sanctuary to examine one's conscience to see if one had acted with integrity and justice; ethical and cultic concerns had to be properly ordered before crossing the gateway onto God's holy mountain. To be an upright worshiper on Zion in Jerusalem would have been analogous to living blamelessly, as the king of Tyre initially did as a guardian cherub in Eden. The imaginary Eden of Ezek 28:11-19 reflects the temple sanctuary of Zion (cf. Ps 36:8-10).51 As the cherub in Eden was consumed by fire when he transgressed, so also were sinners in Zion who presumed to dwell on God's holy mountain (Isa 33:14). A central characteristic of an ancient Near Eastern temple was its power as a source of fertility and life.52 To neglect to bring offerings to the temple meant separation from the source of life, that is, alienation and death; to bring an offering was to foster a relationship with God. This symbolic action honored God and showed the offerer's desire to draw near to God and yet to be attentive to God's otherness,53 but the ritual action would have been desecrated if it were used for self-aggrandizement or exploitation of others (cf. Ezek 28:18). For Ezekiel, the rituals of the Yahwistic sanctuary were to create and re-create the vision of the community whose sovereign was Yhwh, who alone was God, and the king or nāšV (that is, "minor king") was his servant.54 This ruler-servant relationship was to be duplicated throughout the community, all of whose members were to show honor and obedience to the divine sovereign.55 In Ezekiel' s Eden, the king of Tyre is portrayed as a wise and beautiful signet and as a cherub "adorned" 51 Callender, Adam in Myth and History ; 41; Jon Levenson, Theology of the Program of Restoration of Ezekiel 40-48 (HSM 10; Missoula, MT: Scholars, 1976) 17-18, 25-26, 33; Yaron, "Dirge over the King of TYre," 40-41; Wilson, "Death of the King of Tyre," 215. 52 Yaron, "Dirge over the King of Týre," 41-44; Lundquist, Temple: Meeting Place of Heaven and Earth, 9-10. 53 Baruch Levine, "Ritual as Symbol: Modes of Sacrifice in Israelite Religion," in Sacred Time, Sacred Place: Archaeology and the Religion of Israel (ed.

As the perfect, beautiful signet that communicated the divine will in earthly matters in a wise and appealing way, the Edenie king of Tyre formed a model for the rule of the earthly king of Tyre. But since the earthly king of T^re has claimed to be 5ē/, "god," rather than 5 ādām , "human" (28:2), the Israelite prophet Ezekiel announces that the king of Tyre has undercut his divinely given authority and spoiled his wisdom and beauty (28:17). The beauty and uniqueness of the nine stones adorning the king of Tyre - carnelian, chrysolite, moonstone, beryl, onyx, jasper, sapphire, turquoise, emerald - exerted symbolic as well as aesthetic power57 and may have mediated a divine knowledge to the one holding them.58 In the world of commerce, these stones were very valuable because of their scarcity; in the trade list of Ezekiel 27, many of these precious stones and metals came from Edom (v. 17) and from Sheba and Raamah (v. 22).59 When the king of Tyre wore them, these stones not only demon- strated his wealth and earthly power but also testified to his sacral power, since all nine of the stones appear among the twelve stones of the high priest's breast- piece in Exod 28:17-20 (parallel in Exod 39: 10-13).60 This parallel between the king of Tyre and the Jerusalemite high priest, along with other sacral references in the scene in Eden, led Robert Wilson to argue that this scene was originally developed to criticize the high priest of Jerusalem and only subsequently was directed at the king of Tyre.61 Wilson's speculation on the tradition history of the Edenie scene reflects the fact that sacral and political power were intertwined, yet distinct.62 Through his incorporation of priestly symbols into the scene, Ezekiel 56 Block C Book of Ezekiel, 2. 111-12) refrains from associating these gemstones in Ezekiel 28 with the high priest's breastpiece. Van Dijk (Ezekiel' s Prophecy on Tyre, 116-17) distances the stones from the king or his apparel by translating mēsūkātekā as "your defense" from a rare meaning of the root sûk, "to hedge about," and picturing the precious stones as forming a wall about the garden in which the king resides; see also Greenberg, Ezekiel 21-37, 581-82. 57 Cornelis Houtman, Exodus (4 vols.; Leuven: Peeters, 1993-2002) 3.502-3; Yaron, "Dirge over the King of Tyre," 36-38. 58 Callender, Adam in Myth and History, 210; idem, "Primal Human in Ezekiel and the Image of God," 179.

As a patron of the sanctuary and an official with some priestly duties, a king was expected to be attentive to the purity of the sanctuary (1 Kgs 8:1-9:9; Psalm 101). 63 The purity of the sanctuary was the priestly way of expressing the whole- ness or integrity of the temple as an institution (Ezek 22:26).64 Just as the indi- vidual worshiper in Psalm 15 is obliged to be pure of heart and to associate with God-fearers, so also the king or worshiper in Psalm 101 has to do this (vv. 2-5) and, indeed, to go one step further in banishing evildoers from the city of Yhwh (v. 8). In Ezekiel 28, the king of Tyre defaulted in his care for the sanctuary not by failing to keep other evildoers out of the city of Tyre but, much more egre- giously, by becoming himself the primary offender against the integrity and holi- ness of the sanctuary (28:16-18). The king of Tyre is guilty of narcissism; he has neglected the demands of his relationships with God and other people. Instead, he chose to store up wealth and to use the symbols of gold and silver to manipulate relations with others. For Ezekiel, violence against a human, as John Kutsko argues, was violence against the image of God.65 This manner of ruling is defiling, the prophet declares (28:4-5, 18); it is a form of idolatry inasmuch as these self-glorifying actions honored the king of Tyre, the cherub of Eden, as a god (see Ezek 20:13, 16). The king of Tyre, who used wealth and violence to establish his independence from God, had to be driven66 from Eden (28:16-18; cf. Gen 3:23- 24; 4:14).67 In the sphere of trade, gold and silver are tangible and quantifiable media of exchange; as monetary symbols, they have a different function and significance from that which they exercise in the aesthetics of the sanctuary and the court.68 As beautiful objects, the silver and gold of the Israelite high priest's breastpiece were meant to symbolize the devotion of the tribes to Yhwh and their common bonds under Yhwh' s care.69 Analogously, the king of Tyre's breastpiece would have symbolized his privileged position as channel of divine blessings to the city of Tyre. However, his accumulation of silver and gold in his treasuries (28:4-5) 63 Steven S.

On the high priest's breastpiece, the silver and gold pointed beyond the wearer to Yhwh, who had entered into a covenant with Israel (Exod 28:29). Analogously, the silver and gold of the king of Tyre's breastpiece were designed to point beyond him to the God who had created him; but Ezekiel condemns him for using his wealth to point to himself rather than to God, nurturing the illusion that he is a god. IV. The Burned Cherub: Purification from Idolatry and Banishment of a Rebellious King Ezekiel announces that, in response to the king of Tyre's proclaiming himself to be a god, Yhwh will send ruthless foreign armies against the king to put him to death. Ezekiel taunts the king of Tyre with the question, "Will you then say to your slayers: 'I am a god'?" (28:9). The king of Tyre is to be pierced by a sword (mehallêkã, v. 9) and die, and so be desecrated (hillělu, v. 7). According to the priestly worldview, a corpse was a contagious impurity and had to be banished from the Zion-like garden sanctuary of Eden (v. 18; cf. 9:7). Ezekiel declares that the slain king of Tyre would be cast from the earthly city of Tyre into the nether- world, where he will be further dishonored by being placed among the uncircum- cised (28:7-10; cf. 31:18; 32:19, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32).70 This punishment will be a fitting end to a rebellious and idolatrous king whose narcissism and exploitative trade practices have destroyed the Eden-like harmony of the city of Tyre and desecrated its sanctuary. The king of Tyre has had his heart in the wrong place (28:2, 5, 17). If the heart is lifted high, then the center of perception is distorted and one's relation- ships become unbalanced. The heart plays a key role in the process of forming boundaries. How one is attentive to the other is an ongoing process for which there are no simple recipes. The king of Tyre has tried to use his wealth and his cleverness to free himself from the responsibility of attending to others. His wealth and cleverness have distorted his self-understanding and interfered with the functioning of his heart.71 Particularly in light of his elevated role as king and guardian cherub (28: 14), his misdeeds have distorted a whole web of relationships within the city of Tyre and beyond. The drastic measure of the divinely willed destruction of the king is justified by the distortion he has introduced into the garden sanctuary. In the priestly language of Ezekiel, distortions in relationships 70 Van Dijk, Ezekiel' s Prophecy on Tyre, 113.

Ezra 2:62-63).73 In brief, cryptic fashion, Ezekiel indicates that the king of Tyre had been blameless but then transgressed through wicked trade practices, and so disquali- fied himself from Eden (28:15-16). Yhwh has declared the king unfit for the mountain of God and has made him "perish"74 from among "the stones of fire" (28:16). What these stones of fire refer to is not clear.75 Since Eden is pictured as situated on God's mountain, it would be far above the earth, and so perhaps these stones of fire are the stars.76 In Mesopotamia, the stars were revered as deities that influenced various aspects of people's lives.77 In the prophet Isaiah's taunt against the hubristic king of Babylon (Isa 14:4-21), the king is compared to Venus, which in the early morning was seen to vanish from the heavens and fall precipitously into Sheol.78 In the Indo-European tradition, the claim was made that humans originated in the stars and fell to earth.79 When the king of lyre is said to "walk about among the stones of fire" (Ezek 28:14), this may suggest a mythic tradition of a primal human who lived in the heights among the stars. Robert Wilson has proposed, however, in line with his identification of the Edenie figure as the high priest, that the "stones of fire" represent the burning coals of the altar of burnt offering.80 Biblical Eden was a place of harmony where humans and nature were in right relationship with God.81 In Genesis 2-3, humans experienced an integration of mind and heart that eluded them once they were banished from Eden. The king of Tyre in Eden also experienced this integration and harmony; he is described as 72 Milgrom ( Leviticus 1-16, 366) notes that forty-seven of the fifty occurrences of the root hll in the OT occur in Ezekiel and the Holiness Code (Leviticus 17-26) and only three in the Priestly source. 73 Mein, Ezekiel and the Ethics of Exile, 154-60; Greenberg, Ezekiel 21-37, 586. 74 Read wë'ibbadëkâ, "he made you perish." 75 Yaron ("Dirge over the King of Týre," 39) and Callender ( Adam in Myth and History, 115) associate these stones with the burning coals of the throne chariot in Ezek 1:13; 10:2-4. 76 Callender, Adam in Myth and History, 111-13; Page, Myth of Cosmic Rebellion, 154. 77 Erica Reiner, Astral Magic in Babylonia (Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 85; Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1995) 15-16. 78 R.

The holiness of the place demanded the immediate expulsion of impurity (cf. 36:33-35). The only other mention of "the garden of God" in Ezekiel is in an oracle against the pharaoh of Egypt, who is likened to a cedar of Lebanon that is the envy of all the other trees in the garden of God (31:8-9). This king also is doomed to fall on account his arrogance (3 1 : 10-1 1);83 a human attempting to take over the prerogatives and the space of the divine merits severe punishment. V. The Transformation of Bodily and Spiritual Perception through the Indwelling of God's Spirit The prophet Ezekiel preached his oracles against Tyre at some point during the thirteen-year siege that Nebuchadnezzar waged against the island fortress of Tyre (ca. 585-573/72 b.c.), but prior to its downfall in 571. 84 Even though the prophet states in Ezek 28:12 that Yhwh directed him to speak this lament to the king of Tyre, the first audience of the oracle was probably the Israelite exiles.85 If the king of tyre had ever acknowledged his hubris as sinful, he probably would have understood it as a transgression against the god Baal Melqart of Tyre, not against the Israelite God, Yhwh.86 As a prophet, Ezekiel was battling against the anti-Yahwistic and polytheistic voices that would have dismissed the Israelites and their God as defeated exiles who were soon to be assimilated into the culture of their Mesopotamian conquerors. If the exilic audience was to accept Ezekiel' s interpretation of the divine reality behind the appearances of political defeat, they had to be willing to step back from their own immediate circumstances and to see Yhwh' s hand in the disasters that had come upon Tyre and Jerusalem. To the extent that people from Tyre were part of Ezekiel' s audience, he would have been trying to persuade them that Yhwh had brought Nebuchadnezzar against Tyre to punish the king of Týre for his hubris. According to the oracles and laments in Ezekiel 26-28, the king of Tyre never came close to acknowledging Yhwh as his sovereign because he was entangled in his own narcissism. As portrayed by Ezekiel, the king of "tyre did not listen to the opinions of others. Consequently, Ezekiel' s Israelite audience is challenged to 82 The same words described the beauty of Zion; see Levenson, Theology of the Program of Restoration of Ezekiel 40-48, 26. 83 Yaron, "Dirge over the King of Tyre," 50. 84 Katzenstein, History of Tyre, 328, 330. 85 Perhaps exiles from Tyre were among Ezekiel' s audience; see Katzenstein, History of Tyre, 323-24; Block, Book of Ezekiel, 2. 31. 86 See H.

For the exiles, perceiving the larger context of visible and invisible realities affecting them was vitally important if they were ever to regain the harmony of Eden (Ezek 28:25-26; 36:33-36).87 Ezekiel expects the Israelite exiles to learn from the mis- takes of the king of Tyre. The message that Ezekiel delivered against the king of Tyre was critical for the self-understanding of the Israelite exiles, who were trying to make sense of their defeat at the hands of the Babylonians. Since Ezekiel the priest had to function in Babylon apart from the Jerusalem temple, he had to shift his approach to communicate a message that would keep the expatriates attentive to Yhwh.88 The king of Tyre was fatally self-absorbed, and his pursuit of commercial enter- prises only fueled his narcissistic tendencies. The sacrificial system had an anti- dote for such narcissism; it demanded the people's close attentiveness to God, since to offer sacrifice they had not only to bring a grain or animal offering but to be in the condition of ritual purity that was required for entry to the sanctuary. Even though the exiles were without a visible sanctuary, the presence of Yhwh among them demanded a response. The priestly system, with its regulations for ritual purity, mapped out a set of practices that would challenge the exiles to be attentive to the divine king in their midst (Ezek 43: 10 - 46:24).89 Ezekiel announced to the Israelite exiles that Yhwh was about to restore them to their land (28:25-26; 36:22-32). Yhwh's reason for doing so was not compassion for their plight but rather concern "for his holy name" (Ezek 36:22- 23).90 Yhwh intended to manifest his glory and holiness in the sight of the nations. The desecration of his name because of the exile had to be remedied.91 Prior to returning the people to the land and restoring the covenant relation- ship, Yhwh had to cleanse the people of their "impurities" (tumšot) and "idols" ( gillûlîm , 36:25). Part of the medicine for Israel's restoration was that the people should feel a strong sense of disgust and guilt for their past sins (36:3 1-32);92 but their deeply rooted tendency to rebel and turn to the worship of the works of their 87 Callender, Adam in Myth and History, 29. 88 Margaret S.

Just as the king of Tare's narcissism arose from distortions in his heart, the exiles had to have the flaws in their self-perception corrected by a heart transplant and an infusion of Yhwh's Spirit if they were to maintain their part of the covenant relationship (36:26-27; cf. 11:19; Jer 31:33-34). Unless Yhwh dwelled at the center of the hearts of the people, they would not be able to live in right relationship with him.93 New knowledge and clarity of purpose would not be sufficient to address the deeply-rooted rebelliousness of the human heart; this people's heart had to be replaced. Yhwh had to give the people an infusion of his Spirit in order for the necessary transformation to occur.94 Punishment, a strong sense of guilt, and new knowledge were ingredients for Israel's restoration; but the strongest measure aimed at the root of the people's waywardness was the replacement of their hearts and the infusion of the divine Spirit. Indeed, the very core of Israel's being and its perception of the world had to be altered. The integration of body and spirit that would bring the exiles to the harmony once known in Eden could come about only through the direct interven- tion of Yhwh himself. VI. Conclusion In Ezekiel' s visions of Yhwh's actions in human affairs, the cherub, sym- bolizing a supernatural being composed of animal and human characteristics, played a significant role in maintaining the boundaries between the divine and the human and between the human and the animal. As a guardian of the boundary between the divine and the human and as a mode of transport for the earthly locus of the divine presence, the cherub called forth attentiveness to the transcendent power of Yhwh, who burst the bonds of every human concept and construct. The cherub was used in Tyre to symbolize the throne of both the human king and the divine king. The king of Tyre succumbed to the temptation to cross the boundary and claim divine status rather than remain at the boundary and accept the respon- sibility of mediating between the divine and human realms. Mediating at the boundary between the divine and human was also a priestly task in the ancient Near East. The exiled Ezekiel, lacking an intact sanctuary in which to function as a priest, exercised his prophetic gifts first by condemning the king of Tyre for failing in his role as a cherub guarding the distinction between the divine and the human, and second, by exhorting the exiles to see Yhwh's hand 93 Daniel Block, "The Prophet of the Spirit: The Use of RWH in the Book of Ezekiel," JETS 32 (1989) 27-49, here 45-46; Mein, Ezekiel and the Ethics of Exile, 245-46.

The cherub symbolizing the throne of Yhwh appeared in Babylon, in Ezekiel' s vision, as one of four cherubs of the divine throne, having many more complex features that made it more difficult to visualize the cherubim, and so giving them a more transcendent character. To perceive the invisible presence of Yhwh, one had to draw near to the boundary between the divine and the human in such a way that exchange could occur but the distinction between the divine and the human would not collapse. The king of T^re, who was 5 ādām, , misused his role as cherub by distorting its symbolic function in order to seize for himself the sovereign role in the divine sphere to which the cherub pointed. Mediation of divine blessings without idolatry was a boundary-keeping task that required the checks and balances offered by the complementary and competing efforts of king, priest, and prophet. In his visionary form of discourse, Ezekiel extended this boundary-keeping responsibility to the exiles, who were summoned to create a locus in their hearts and spirits for the appearance of Yhwh. The cherub's function of guarding and transporting Yhwh' s presence was to find an analogy in the perceptual move- ments in the hearts of the exiles. Just as the cherubim moved out of Jerusalem to Babylon and carried the presence of Yhwh there, so too the exiles were obliged to adapt and encounter Yhwh in Babylon. Ezekiel promised that such an encoun- ter would be possible because Yhwh would transform their hearts and give them an infusion of his Spirit.</page></plain_text>
