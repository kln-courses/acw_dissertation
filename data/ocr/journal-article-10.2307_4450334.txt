<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Dissected World of Biology. (1996). Cerebellum Corporation (1301 Beverly Rd., Suite 200, McLean, VA 22101; www.cerebellum.com; (703) 848-0856.) VHS. 2 hours, 15 minutes. Purchase $19.99. This is not about dissection. The content is chemistry of life, cell structure, nucleic acids, membrane transport, mitosis, meiosis, cellular respiration, and photosynthe- sis. Young college students eager to memorize facts may like this video. Even they, however, will not want to watch it all in one sitting. It could be a useful tool in a group study session where students can check their under- standing and explore extensions of the ideas. They may find it a useful tool in group study sessions where they can stop it and check their understanding with one another. The presentation style, modeled on children's educa- tional television, is humorous and an- noying. The science content is appro- priate to introductory college classes and advanced high school classes, but references to sex and a smoking char- acter should make it out-of-bounds for high school. Memory devices and analogies are used throughout. I find many of the metaphors and analogies offensive. I prefer to avoid phrases like "happy oxygen" or "caring cells." Is the teleol- ogy and anthropomorphism so ex- treme that students will dismiss it? I don't for a minute think so. Students are more likely to incorporate these ideas in their thinking and begin ex- plaining the phenomenon of diffusion as a result of the desires of the individ- ual molecules or the division of a cell as a need it perceives. A few errors bothered me. Among them are these: "salt is an anion," ref- erence to sister chromatids as twin chromatids, building DNA with the backbone of sugar and phosphate then adding nitrogenous bases, chromo- somes in prophase of mitosis having to find their duplicate chromatids, 92 chromosomes in humans at the start of mitosis and meiosis, first division of meiosis is like mitosis, and telephase. This inexpensive video, available at video stores, may become popular with students, but I don't see a place for this in my introductory biology classroom. 374 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 59, NO. 6, JUNE 1997</page><page sequence="2">The content is only a superficial pre- sentation of-facts, with an occasional sprinkling of why those facts might be important. There is no opportunity for critical thinking or application, but those features are not intended by the producers. Students need to know that biology is more than the collection of facts, so you might want to guide them beyond this in their review sessions. You might have students watch a seg- ment, then borrow the style to create their own review video! There is no written support material. Students might even be challenged to create that as part of their review. Rachel Hays Front Range Community College- Larimer Fort Collins, CO 80527</page></plain_text>
