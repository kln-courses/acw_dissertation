<plain_text><page sequence="1">'NOTHING NEATLY NAMED': The Beckettian Aesthetic and Negative Theology Jeremy Parrott The oft-quoted passage from the Three Dialogues that begins "nothing to express ..." has usually been understood as meaning 'having nothing to say' rather than 'having to say: Nothing.' However, using the latter reading as a springboard, this article conducts an onomastic exploration of some of Beckett's many attempts to "nothingness in words enclose" through the use of characternyms - fictive illusions of being which give linguistic substance to a divine absence. Taking examples from the English fiction (Belacqua, Adam, Nemo, bboggs, Quin, Nixon and Knott), it is argued that Beckett's onomastic im pulse is essentially theophanic - naming and momentarily making manifest little gods which, as their creator, he is at liberty to destroy. This is an article about nothing. Should I stop now? Stop at nothing? No, nothing do ing. For in the manifest universe nothing mysteriously gives rise to one; one cleaves in twain to duplicate; two begets a myriad. For the time being, however, let us attempt to stick with nothing, to return to nothing - a state or condition ardently aspired to by the Beckettian protagonist. Murphy, for example, achieves the rare mystic feat of experi encing "the accidentless One-and-Only, conveniently called nothing" (M, 246). In his brief note to Sighle Kennedy,1 Beckett suggested that the best starting points for inves tigating Murphy might be a pair of quotations from Arnold Geulincx and Democritus2 which he had incorporated into the novel, both of which wrestle with the concept of nothingness. Naught, nil, zero, cipher - the last two words both derive ultimately from the Arabic zifr meaning 'empty' or 'nothing'. The foundation of western mathematics or ciphering is thus nothing; of computing, the opposition between zero and one; of theology, the cuspidal point between creation and non-creation, being and nothingness. 91</page><page sequence="2">This particular disquisition on nothingness takes as its springboard the most celebrated passage from the Three Dialogues, that which includes the phrase: "nothing to express..." (Dis, 139). My reading of those three words plays on a possible ambigu ity: as well as meaning 'having nothing to express' one can also interpret them as 'having to express, having to squeeze out... nothing.' How can the expression of noth ing be realised by the creative artist, under the obligation to express? Turning to Watt, we find a maxim-like answer to this rhetorical question: "For the only way one can speak of nothing is to speak of it as though it were something, just as the only way to speak of God is to speak of him is though he were a man" (W, 74). This abrupt move ment from nothingness to anthropomorphic deity is highly significant, since it is my contention that behind the anthropomorphic (or more precisely anthroponymic) veneer of many of Beckett's creations it is possible to discern le Dieu cache, and still further recessed behind the hidden God, swaddled in linguistic padding - the ineffable effed, nothingness in words enclosed - lies a gnostic via negativa at the heart of the author's creative project. Working backwards, in the style of Watt, let us now regress through the English fiction from Knott, via Nixon, Quin, bboggs, Nemo and Adam to Belacqua, back to Samuel Beckett and "the source of nought" (W, 164). Mr. Knott is the all-elusive mas ter of the household which provides a temporary refuge for Watt and others of his ilk. As the exhaustive and exhausting descriptions of Mr. Knott's physical appearance am ply testify (W, 209-211), his most predictable feature is his unpredictability; his most stable his mutability. The principal recorded instances of his speech are instantly self negated commands, spoken backwards, in which the negation precedes the command! As indicated by the example of his speech, negation is perhaps the most salient of Mr. Knott's attributes. He is, therefore, Mr. 'Not'. Stated even more strongly, he is not, in that he does not possess the normal attributes of being. He is protean, kinetic, a con tinuous flux of becoming. In this respect he perfectly embodies (and simultaneously disembodies) the Buddha's teaching on impermanence (Pali - anicca). Is it possible to talk of Mr. Knott's existence? Or, a fortiori, of his essence? The existential antithesis of being is nothingness, and we may therefore see in the name not only 'not' but 'nought.' Similarly the Buddha rejected the notion that beings had an unchanging es 92</page><page sequence="3">sence and preached instead the doctrine of 'no soul' (Pali - anatta). Clearly the figure of Mr. Knott is an enigma, like a Zen koan, an impossible knot for us to attempt to un ravel. Like the word 'gnosis' - the mystical knowledge towards which Mr. Knott seems to point - the name Knott announces itself noiselessly with a silent consonant. Indeed Knott is enveloped in silence, the second't' being no more than orthographic packing material, whilst within the residual negation at the name's core nestles the plenum-void, O/zero, whence all matter comes and whither it will once again return. Although Mr. Knott does not have any fixed shape, age, behaviour etcetera, he is able to assume any human shape, age, behaviour etc. He may therefore be considered like the endless knot in the shape of a sideways figure 8 - the symbol of infinity - compre hending within himself all possibilities. All these readings can be combined to form a gestalt image of the name Knott which is entirely consonant with Pascal's Pensee 199 in the section 'Disproportion of Man': For, after all, what is man in nature? A nothing compared to the infinite, a whole compared to the nothing, a middle point between all and nothing, infi nitely removed from an understanding of the extremes; the end of things and their principles are unattainably hidden from him in impenetrable secrecy. (Pascal, 90) If Watt is man in nature, Mr. Knott is at once all and nothing, a riddle which man is powerless to unravel. The relationship between Watt and Mr. Knott can be expressed diagrammatically thus: Knott as 'knot' Watt as 'what?' Knott as 'not'/'nought' The relationship which Pascal was describing was that of man to God, who created man in his image. But if man is God's image - which man looks like God or does God 00 ? x/o 93</page><page sequence="4">look like? Whence the infinite mutability of Mr. Knott qua God made man - a man made God. In the first section of Watt we encounter Goff Nixon (W, 10), husband to Tetty and father of Larry, a figure who has the unique honour of being an acquaintance of both Hackett and Watt, and through whom Watt is introduced into the narrative. Nixon is a perfect Beckettian name, redolent with associations. The etymology from Nick son already suggests that we should see in this name a reference to the Devil - collo quially Old Nick or simply Nick. Mr. Nixon is the intermediary between Watt and Mr. Hackett, symbolically a Christ-figure3 and an authorial figure4 respectively. Mr. Nixon, an unwitting devil's advocate, tempts Mr. Hackett and stimulates the reader's interest in Watt. He can, however, no more remember first meeting Watt "than I re member meeting my father." To this surprising statement Mr. Hackett exclaims "Good God" (W, 21). Is God Mr. Nixon's father, or the Devil? Is Watt the Son of God or the anti-Christ? The fact that Watt fails to "pay the devil his due" (he owes Mr. Nixon ei ther five shillings or six and nine pence) and that Mr. Nixon consequently damns him (although the precise expression is carefully omitted) hint at Faustian undertones in both this scene and the final pages of Part IV. In deconstructing this supremely negative name, Nixon almost implodes on contact. The element 'nix' means 'nothing'; ni means 'not, neither, nor' in French, whilst reading from right to left we find 'no', and sandwiched in the middle an 'X' - symbolically the unknown or negation. Were 'the unnamable' to have been fitted for a name this one is almost made to measure, as on the verge of extinction he concludes: "you must go on, I can't go on, I'll go on" (U, 418). Goff Nixon is extracted from the primordial void (Goff being a reversal of 'fog') to fulfil a narrative function and then disappears again into the night - in Greek: nyx. During the extraordinarily long gestation period over which Beckett was work ing on Watt, the Ur-antihero Quin was gradually eased out by the development of Knott and Watt and was aborted before the novel was brought to term. We never en counter Quin 'in person' but the name is heard shouted in a bar in Mercier et Camier, an event later commented on by Mercier. The French text is, in this instance, far more resonant than the English: 94</page><page sequence="5">Vive qui? dit Camier. J'ai entendu Quin, dit Mercier. ?a doit etre quelqu'un qui w'existe pas, dit Mercier. [my italics] (MC, 205-6) This Beckettian private joke resurrects and instantly dismisses the spectre of Quin, and despite killing Quin off before he ever materializes, Beckett nonetheless seems to de rive considerable pleasure by allowing the character a series of cameo non appearances: the name features once in Watt (Quin's hotel - a place where Watt is not), twice in Mercier and Camier and twice more in Malone Dies - a total of no more nor less than five (i.e. quinque - Latin). Quin is mentioned as a shadowy benefactor of Malone, having once given him an unwanted flannel which has subsequently disap peared (MD, 252). The name then recurs towards the end of the same novel, with no further details as to the precise identity of the signified, as a figure in a dream men tioned in passing by the Saxon (who is not a Saxon): "Dreamt all night of that bloody man Quin again, he said." (MD, 284). A quin-tessentially Beckettian name, these elu sive, half-glimpsed dream Quins point vaguely towards the word made flesh - an in carnation of the non-existent: "qui n 'existe pas." Whilst many of the names in More Pricks Than Kicks are salvaged from the wreckage of Dream of Fair to Middling Women one of the notable additions to the motley cast list is bboggs, ffamily name of Belacqua's ffiancee Thelma, sister Una, father Otto Olaf and, last and by all means least, mother Bridie.The name of the small double b family seems, at least initially, to be little more than a typographical joke. However, the extreme markedness of this nonce-name, which is not even signalled by an initial capital letter, calls into question its status as a name and invites close scru tiny. The model appears to come from the odd-looking names ffrench and ffoulkes, which are based on the lS^-century practice of writing F as ff. The preservation of such spelling is generally viewed as an affectation. In the case of the letter 'B', for which no such precedent exists, bboggs for Boggs would appear ludicrously self aggrandising. Etymologically this is quite appropriate, since the name Boggs, from the Middle English bogeys, means 'inclined to bluster' or 'puffed up' (Reaney, 256). The 95</page><page sequence="6">former characteristic would seem entirely apt as a description of paterfamilias Otto Olaf, which the latter neatly sums up the grossly overweight Una. Stripping away the graphic packaging in much the same way as with Knott, the core of the name is re vealed as 'bog'. This may be then analysed as a vocabulary item in several languages, most notably English, Irish and Russian. In English, a bog is a type of marshland highly characteristic of the Irish landscape. In slang, it is also a toilet, a significant reading given that Otto Olaf has "made his money in toilet requisites and necessaries" (MPTK, 128). The English word 'bog' is a loan from the Irish bogach, which in turn derives from bog, sl polysemous vocabulary item meaning variously 'move, stir, sof ten, loosen, warm, soft, easy, loose' (MacMathuna and 6 Corrain, 390). The notion of movement combined with that of softness and stuck-ness (reinforced by the English meaning of bog) leads to a reading of this name as a Brunonian identified contrary. A further overlay of meaning is added by treating bog as a Slavic word; in Russian, Pol ish and Serbian, for example, bog means God, a meaning which Beckett was certainly aware of from Joyce's use of this word in Finnegans Wake. A complementary reading of the name shows that our solipsistic author has signed or perhaps doodled his name even within this minor creation. The initial 'bb' is recognizable as the initials for Barclay with the 's' for Samuel bringing up the rear. This leaves in the middle 'ogg' or Ogg, itself a Scottish family name and a core Irish vocabulary item (6g) meaning 'young'. Whence, as if in tribute to Joyce, we discover a highly compressed portrait of the artist (and his onomastic artistry) as a young man. It should be recalled that the Slavic name of God is also implicated in bboggs and that the author's given name Samuel means in Hebrew 'name of God'. The inextricable linking of self-naming and God-naming in Beckett's work is therefore deeply rooted in the author's quest for Self and a name for that Self which is unique to him. Returning now to Beckett's earliest attempt at extended fiction, we find in Dream of Fair to Middling Women the puzzling figure of Nemo, a shadowy presence (or absence?), whom the narrator finds the most recalcitrant of his characters. Whilst some of them are expected to "do their dope all right and give no trouble," 'Nemo is one of those that will not'. He is described as "the most regrettable simultaneity of notes" (D, 11), a "symphonic" rather than "melodic" unit, unlike the other personages 96</page><page sequence="7">who consent to having tunes played on them. That Nemo is intimately bound up with Belacqua is revealed by the narrator's apparent sudden realization that "we tend, on second thoughts, to smell the symphonic rat in our principal boy." (ibid.). As a spectral figure who adds nothing to the minimal narrative momentum, Nemo is, as Pilling (61) has pointed out, "a nobody not to be named," being the onomastic incarnation of the entirely imaginary, uniquely privileged individual who has seen the face of the Al mighty (from a deliberate misreading of the beginning of St John 1, 18 in the Vulgate: "Deum nemo vidif - "No man (someone called Nemo) hath seen God"). Nemo is not so much an alter ego of Belacqua as an incarnation of his id. Belacqua and Nemo stand, side by side, in the same posture, leaning over a parapet (D, 157). The insub stantial Nemo jumps from the Salmon Leap at Leixlip (the family home of Beckett's mother nee Roe - indicating Beckett's desire for a pre-natal state, a return to non being) fulfilling the death-wish which Belacqua's ego is unable to inflict on his own mind and flesh. Linked to Nemo is the equally enigmatic Adam of St Victor (D, 182) who is de scribed as "that notorious poacher" and "of no fixed address or occupation" (D, 182/3), and who is responsible for fishing Nemo out of the water at Leixlip. This unlikely act of naming is not a coinage by Beckett but the name of one of the Victorine poets that also included Richard, Walter and Hugh (of St-Victor) amongst their num ber. The Abbey of St-Victor in Paris was founded in 1113 by William of Champeaux, whose "extreme theophany" is mentioned in Murphy. Adam (who died at some time between 1177 and 1192) was perhaps the greatest of the abbey's sequence writers (Livingstone 1996, 6 and 538). Beckett encountered this name in Inge's Christian Mysticism, noting a fragment of his verse in "The Dream Notebook" [677] which is duly inserted in the novel (D, 183). As Inge only quotes this one sequence by Adam as an epigraph and makes no reference to the author in the body of his text it seems un likely that any of the detail surrounding the use of this name in Dream refers to the historical Adam of St-Victor. Instead Beckett is using the name as an objet trouve around which to weave some highly abstruse - but ultimately very revealing - word play. 97</page><page sequence="8">Adam, probably derived from the Heb. adama - 'earth', is a generic term rather than a personal name and means simply 'man' (Hanks &amp; Hodges, 3). The biblical Adam, the first man, is the first of a succession of Everyman figures leading directly to the incarnation of God as man in the person of Jesus. The most celebrated St Victor and the first to bear this name died in 198; this would appear to be the particular Victor that Beckett had in mind in constructing his conceit. Victor was the first Pope of Latin rather than Greek culture and replaced Greek with Latin as the language of the Roman church. There is an oblique reference to this in the preface to the mock news item in which the charactemym Adam of St Victor appears: "the Twilight Herald inserted in its horrid Latin a succinct paragraph" (Z), 182). More tellingly, there is a reference to the controversy that St Victor had to resolve with the Quartodecimans in Asia Minor who observed Easter on the 14th day of the Hebrew month of Nisan. In the news item Nemo's felo de se is described as taking place "in the prepuscular gloom of Good Fri day's or was it Lady Day's autumnal octave" (D, 183). Lady Day (March 25th) - a fixed rather than movable feast day - is indeed the 14th of the Jewish calendar month Nisan which runs from March into April (Livingstone, 425). Although a display of erudition appears at first the principal motivation behind the inclusion of these abstruse references, there is a narrative and onomastic point hidden in the verbiage. St Victor the First started the sequence of events which led to the writing of the Vulgate by Jerome. It was in this Latin version that the notoriously ambiguous clause "Deum nemo vidif made its first appearance. It was therefore St Victor who, in trawling Nemo out of the water (symbolically the unconscious), brought this non-existent being temporarily to life - the first man (i.e. Adam) to have been created by the Latin Bible. Nemo's ultimately successful suicide returns him to the primordial state of never hav ing been. A cursory analysis of the name of Beckett's first fictional protagonist reveals the Italian bel acqua ('beautiful water'), whose transparency reflects the colour of Be lacqua's "blazing blue eyes" (D:15). Although preceding Beckett's adoption of the letter "M" as an encrypted paraph in the names of his protagonists, this reading none theless points towards the fundamental meaning of that letter in the Proto-Sinaitic script as 'water' - the flow or flux that erodes the onomastic being of his later Ms. A 98</page><page sequence="9">shift of emphasis and language produces the initially unlikely English collocation 'be lacquer'. On closer inspection, however this proves surprisingly fruitful. The 'be' is both being or existence and the beginning of Be-ckett, of whom Belacqua is the first important vice-exister. Lacquer is a volatile solvent (often alcohol-based, like Belac qua's drunken talk) used to hold unstable, disparate elements in place. As the Manda rin reminds Belacqua concerning the latter's artistic credo: "The reality of the individ ual, you had the cheek to inform me once, is an incoherent reality and must be ex pressed incoherently." (D, 101) 'Belacqua' is therefore analysable as a lacquer on Be lacqua/Beckett's incoherent being, a veneer, a temporary and superficial stabilization of the inexpressible truth of being continuously fermenting beneath the surface. Hav ing gone thus far in dismantling his name, the merest glissando to a neighbouring homophone sees the insubstantial pageant that is Belacqua fade - he's not real, he's a "be-lacker": "There is no real Belacqua, it is to be hoped not indeed, there is no such person." (D, 121) Following a different cultural and linguistic track, strongly promoted by the character's nickname, leads us to the principal Babylonian deity Bel or Baal. The name, which appears in Beelzebub, Babel and Babylon itself, means 'lord' or 'master'. The overthrow of Bel was synonymous with the end of Babylon and its domination (Jeremiah 50, 2 &amp; 51, 44). Given that it was an idol of Bel/Baal that Daniel and his companions were commanded to worship, it is highly ironic that, since ba 'al means 'master' in Hebrew as well as Babylonian, Baal was also a title used by the Israelites to refer to Yahweh (Douglas, passim). Bel is therefore principally a pagan deity but also, confusedly, bound up with the name of the true God. Bel (short for Belacqua) is a graven image of his author, Sam (short for Samuel - 'name of God'). The meaning of Beckett's own given name is no mere incidental detail but, I firmly believe, a determinant factor in shaping the author's self-image, aesthetic and creative output. Born on Friday the 13th, the unlucky day which coincided on the cal endar for April 1906 with the commemoration of Christ's death, Beckett's own theo phanic or theogonic impulses would appear to stem from an identification with Christ - God made man. As Estragon says in earnest to the disbelieving Vladimir: "All my life I've compared myself to him" (WFG, 51). The whole of Beckett's fictional oeuvre 99</page><page sequence="10">from Murphy through to L 'Innommable can be interpreted as the search for a name, a search which ultimately proves abortive. No less an authority than the New Bible Dic tionary describes the fundamental theme of the Bible as the search for and the ultimate revelation through the person of Jesus Christ, of the name of God (Douglas, 812). The name Samuel is both portentous and empty. It designates a space where the 'real' name should be, either the name which truly names Beckett or God's secret name for himself. The names which Beckett attaches to his protagonists are often glorious trou vailles, rich in polysemous potential. Yet none of these acts of naming is ultimately capable of subsuming within its tiny graphic and phonetic compass the totality of the author's being. As Derrida emphasizes in his essays on naming in Sauf le nom, in French the words for 'name' (nom) and 'no' (non) are homophones. All naming, he contends, designates an absence, an absence further compounded by Beckett in his later work, in which the author pursues his quest for lessness and nothingness across the lower-case wastes of namelessness. Notes 1. In Disjecta, p. 113. 2. These gnomic saws are Ubi nihil vales, ibi nihil ve\is (Geulincx), (M, 178): "Where you are worth nothing, there want nothing" and "Naught is more real than nothing" (Democritus), (Af, 246) - a realization that resonates in Murphy's mind when gazing into Mr Endon's eyes. 3. As well as the numerous overt textual comparisons between Watt and Christ (see Parrott 2001 for the specific references) there are some cleverly encrypted onomastic clues which reinforce this equivalence. The name Watt is rendered in Watt's own speech as 'Taw', the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, whose archaic form was in the shape of a cross and whose meaning is 'cross-mark'. In addition, thanks to James Watt, Watt is a name-word which appears on every light bulb sold throughout the world. One cannot help but feel that Beckett would have borne this fact in mind when selecting the characternym Watt, and at least smiled when paralleling it with Christ's prophetic: "I am the light of the world" (St John 8, 12). 4. 'Mr. Hackett' is only a consonant and a vowel away from Mr Beckett and functions as the authorial persona who stimulates our curiosity about the protagonist Watt before tactfully re ceding into the shadows. 100</page><page sequence="11">Works Cited Beckett, Samuel, Murphy [M] (New York: Grove P, 1957). - Watt [W] (London: John Calder, 1963). - Waiting for Godot [WFG] (London: Faber, 1965).
