<plain_text><page sequence="1">'ABD AL-HAIK AL-ISLAMI, A JEWISH CONVERT By M. PERLMANN THE following is the result of a study of an anti-Jewish pamphlet written by 'Abd al-Halkkd al-Islmi, a Jewish convert to Islam, in Morocco, apparently in the fourteenth century. The British Museum possesses two copies of the manuscript tract. They are: A) Add. 9660, Cat. II, p. 295, No. 623, pp. lllb-131a, and B) Add. 9567, Cat. II, p. 335, No. 735, pp. 134-175a. The former was written in 1203 H./1789, in a fine script, while the latter was written somewhat earlier, in 1151 H./1740, in a coarse hand. The library of Rabat possesses the same tract (Levi-Provencal - Les Manuscrits Arabes de Rabat, p. 259, No. 529, IV); the Ms. was produced in 1289/1872. The tract was reproduced in lithography, apparently in the first years of the century (Sarkis' Mu'jam, col. 1272), in the form of a booklet of 24 pages (pagination 1-8 repeated three times).' The fact that recently use was still being made of the pamphlet proves not only the vitality of mediaeval controversies in the towns of Morocco, but also seems to bear witness to a certain amount of renown enjoyed for centuries by the tract, though in one country only, in circles concerned with religious disputations. The B. M. manuscripts differ slightly in numerous details. Ms. B preserves a better text, which is strikingly demonstrated On more recent literature of that kind, cf. A. E. Schmidt in Zap. Koll. Vost., V; A. Jeffery, "New Trends in Moslem Apologetic" (in The lMoslem World of To-day, ed. by J. R. Mott, 1925, pp. 305 ff.) 171</page><page sequence="2">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW on p. 119 of Ms. A, where a Hebrew quotation is abruptly interrupted, whereas B brings it in full with indication of the source. There are also some substantial differences, especially at the beginning and at the end of the pamphlet. Some passages had been transposed, i. e., occur in different connections in the Mss. A whole passage of argument, including a Hebrew quotation, is to be found in B only. One perceives also that the older B text does not show as much keenness for eulogies as the later version in Ms. A. It stands to reason that the differences arose out of wide use, and they may reflect insertions made in older Mss. by the author. The Rabat Ms. and the lithography give, generally speaking, the same text as the older Ms. B of B. M. In the B. M. Mss. the tract bears no name at all. The Rabat Ms. is entitled ,'y 'I'tR '?

But then, there were three Merinid princes with the name Abfi Sa'id 'Uthman, and it is not clear why just the second (Ibn Ya'lufb) suggests himself to us. It is baffling, too, that in both passages the abi of the kunya should have been omitted. Steinschneider6 added that it was in the fourteenth century that polemic literature was in vogue. He consequently attributes the pamphlet to c. 1310-1330. It was demonstrated that some Merinid princes assumed the title of "Commanders of the faithful" or "of the Moslems."7 This is what can be learned from the tract about its author. His name does not seem to be mentioned anywhere else. The language is simple (the Mss. contain a number of mistakes). There is a certain amount of Kuranic quota- tion. Certain passages are in rhymed prose. Eulogies follow names of prophets; curses occur whenever Jews, especially their 'ulama, are mentioned. The transcription of Hebrew seems to have been originally sound yet it was spoilt by a tendency to show the pronunciation too. There are points of difference in those transcribed passages between A and B (e. g., final he is hd in A but ali in B). The pamphlet belongs to the popular "vulgar" polemics, of the kind represented, e. g., by the (contemporary?) Sa'id of Alexandria. The author wanted to give a short manual for disputa- tions against Jews. lrn2:lln l9nt i; t l 1T 'InlS -p lL 1&lt;i D;TDI WrTn lS Nyl 'jj;9r D n ... inn,y nD ty Dm-ioy nrnt. 6 Ibid. 7 Van-Berchem, JA, 1907, esp. p. 295 ff.; Ibn al-Ahmar, Rauda an-Nisrin, ed.

That status had been granted to evnothently v is non-conformts Yet the Jes cannot be regaarded as such: they are in fact imbued with shirk. Their Scriptures are poor falsifications Indeed the Jews are fire-worshipers. Moslems do not realize that, and this fact enabled the Jews to enjoy the status of dimmis. Second, there should be some censorship of their books. The author refers mainly to biblical books.8 Al-Islami is evidently very proud of his logic, consistency and method- ical standard, acquired-one gets the impression-in oral controversies. 8 This suggestion seems to be rather original in the Moslemx world. But cf. Tritton, The Caliphs and Their non-Moslem Subjects, p. 173. 177</page><page sequence="8">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW E. g., being very fond of the gematria method,9 he proves that the numerical value of certain words in the biblical texts is equal to that of the name of the Prophet.

Gematria is a principle of the Jewish legal system. If there is any objection, then either the method is wrong or its application in a certain case is inadmissible. If the Jews scoff at the method, their religion is menaced with destruction; if the method is upheld, why should it not be applied in the passage quoted?

III is devoted to the subject of ch. IV. Now the very division shows at first glance the prob- lems of Moslem polemics against Jews, as well as the utter inability of al-Islami to cope with them.I0 The fundamental problem is that of the Moslem's attitude towards the Scriptures. Are they revelation or forgery? There were three trends of thought concerning that question: affirmation of the authenticity of the Scriptures; rejection; the middle way with two varieties, A: the books are authentic; still certain passages may have been forged, changed, distorted; and B: it is only the comment, the interpretation, the ta'wl which is wrong with the ahl al-kitdb." If the Scriptures are God's revelation there must be some allusions to the Prophet and Islam. Here the search for suitable passages starts. More- over, there must be found the proof and prediction of the abrogation, the naskh of other faiths by the advent of the Prophet. If they are not revelation or if they are a partly forged revelation, then the way is paved for an attack on the text, to show its stupidity, awkwardness, inconsistencies, o1 Enc. Jud., s. v.

In both cases there is ample material - partly supplied by Jewish internal schisms and controversies - for proceeding to an attack on Judaism. Sometimes moral qualities of Jews are censured, etc. Al-Islami is an adherent of the theory of ta.hrif, so con- sistently expounded by Ibn-Hazm. The books are mubad- dala. Notwithstanding, he tries to trace the allusions to the Prophet and his revelation in those forgeries. While he searches them for proofs of the naskh, he attacks them as documents of wildest tajsSm, obscene allegations about the prophets, etc. There is hardly anything new in his arguments, i. e., in the passages he quotes for his case. He starts with a range of arguments from (the false!) Scriptures to prove that Mulammad had been predicted as a prophet in the Bible (A, 113 a-b). "The Jews persist in denying Muhammad's prophetic mission, out of envy and obduracy; for, indeed, their books refer to him clearly 'b 'i]: ,;:1:n3 'D n::I ;n "With God's help, I shall refute them, and annihilate their doctrine with arguments which they themselves accept and cannot dismiss; for I am going to cast their own stones upon them, and flog them with their own assertions, taking my arguments from their twenty-four books which are alleged to be revelations." Then the strangest allegation is brought forward. Refer- ring to (and quoting) the passage in I Kings 20.6, he asserts that Ahab, who was 4;:`D I=1 [11kD 3I:13 11, was a righteous man 'rnnn 1' nqrTpnyl ]jR but the Jews rejected his belief.

One must bear in mind that the Jews used to retort that they follow Abraham and Moses. Consequently al-Islami is anxious to prove that their assertion is wrong. They do not follow Abraham's example; moreover they directly violate the stipulations laid down by Moses. They neglect the Scriptures wherever those do mention s5 Of course, the arguments themselves are much older. We find them expressed, or refuted, in Saadya and in Hiwi ha-Balkhi's queries. Again, it is possible to retrace the sources of biblical criticism of this kind not only to the Pahlawi Shikand but also to Marcionite and perhaps even ancient Hellenistic criticism. Cf. I.

Another verse in the same chapter, Deut. 18.19, tells of God's wrath against those who will not obey the coming prophet when he speaks in God's name. That refers to Muhammad, for only in the Koran every chapter opens with God's name - the basmala. Returning again to the logical line of argument he refers to Deut. 13.1. God demanded that his orders be obeyed without adding to or diminishing them. The Jews were required to sacrifice in Jerusalem only. But we read that Joshua sacrificed at Samaria, i. e., violated the Scripture and its prescription. This is a clear case of abrogation.

Persevering in their prejudices the Jews retain a most abject idea of God, full of gross anthropomorphism, so that they may be considered as ahl ash-shirk indeed. That is the subject of ch. III. This widespread allegation, so much exploited by Ibn Hazm and culminating in Zamakhshari's assertion: "Whatever anthropomorphism there is among Muslims, it was taken over from the Jews,"20 is here concentrated on several biblical passages. To begin with Gen. 1.26 - that God created man in His own image must be an evident forgery: 1/1'T '~L i*nnl NR although the Jews argue NfiE:N ]i 'ID ,i PtS^ IN ,r1N pi tr ;l $D t Y Ht;n Ji3 lp lD.2I This is simply unreasonable.

The exclamations remind one vividly of Ibn Hazm's indignation on the subject and his belief that only deliberately and utterly corrupt people with no belief whatever, unscrupu- lous, with no moral sense and conscience could have written the Scriptures.25 Lev. 16.8 -one lot for the Lord and the other for Azazel, i. e.

It should be borne in mind that the Scriptures do not contain references either to paradise or hell, and that would not be the case if they were of divine origin. So this is the creed of a community erroneously given the status of "tributaries." They cannot live among the faithful without waging attacks against them, uttering curses against the prophets and the Moslems. These secret or veiled attacks are the subject of ch. IV. It opens with the vindication mentioned above on p. 175 and the demand for a purge of Hebrew books. For the assault against the prophets cannot be left unpunished.

Thus we find that the material is mainly biblical, mostly from the Pentateuch, especially from Genesis. Non-biblical material is scanty: rules on leaving the house on Sabbath, making a fire on that day, the calendar, the "benedictions" on the apostates, quotations from the prayer book.

OF AL-ISLAMI'S TRACT There is another copy of al-Islami's tract - in volume 3728b of the India Office Library, London.32 It was written in the last century. It contains also some remarkable utterances which throw at least some side light on the position of the author, and also enable us to fix the date of the composition of the tract almost with accuracy. The text in this Ms. appears to be that of Ms. A. It contains, accordingly, the story of the composition of the tract and the invocation of blessings for the ruler. But it is not Abii Sa'id 'Uthman but Abu Firas 'Abd-al- 'Aziz who is named as the ruler. The author adds to his own name the word al-Mahdi (the rightly-guided; al- Mukanna bi-l-mahdi). Ceuta is not mentioned. The tract is stated to have been written at the invitation of the learned and noble Abiu Zaid 'Abd ar-Rabman, son of the hajib (chancellor) Abfi-l-'Abbas Ahmad al-Kaba'ili. "And I named this book 'As-saif al maldiid fi-r-radd 'ala-1-Yahiid.' " As indicated above the name of Sa'id 'Uthman is not sufficient for dating the Ms. An amir of that name ruled in the first half of the thirteenth century, another in the beginning of the fifteenth century. The new name is still vaguer in this respect. Towards the end of the fourteenth century two princes of the same name started their rule in the same year in Fas and in Tunis respectively. But 3I Asin Palacios, "Un tratado morisco," Melanges Derenbourg, p. 357. 32 I wish to thank Dr. Arberry for his having drawn my attention to this Ms. 190</page><page sequence="21">'ABD AL-HAKK AL-ISLAMI-PERLMANN the reference to the patron of al-Islami, to the al-IKaba'ili family, comes to our aid. This family played an important role in the administration of the Merinid state in the fourteenth century. Abu-l-'Abbas Ahmad served as adjib under three princes in the years 1387-1393 and 1396-1400. He was accused of nepotism, and had many enemies. A conflict at the court caused by his absence from duty (he went to his grandson) brought about fatal results: the whole family was put to death in the year 802/1400 at the order of Abu Sa'id 'Uthman III (800-823/1398-1420). Abu Sa'id's predecessor was Abi Firas 'Abd al-'Aziz II al-Muntasir (796-799/1393-1396), under whom the elder al-Kaba'ili did not act as hajib. Now if al-Islami's tract was written in the reign of Abu Firas, then the tract was written in 1393-6. The invocations were evidently changed after the execution of the Kaba'ilis. That is why in Ms. A, the anonymous "scholars of Ceuta" appear instead of the younger al-Kaba'ili of the new Ms. Incidentally, it is of interest to notice that al-Islami had contacts with such a high dignitary of the Merinid state as a member of the IKaba'ili family.33 33 Ibn al-Almar, Raudat-an-Nisrin, p. 100.
