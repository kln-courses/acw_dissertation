<plain_text><page sequence="1">DID GOD CREATE THE ONLY POSSIBLE WORLD? J. F. ROSS 1. It would seem that the absolutely perfect Creator pro duced the only possible world. Three philosophical positions dis cussed below, despite their obvious disparities, seem to entail that: (1) "God is the absolutely perfect creator of the world" implies (with certain auxiliary premises) "This is the only possible world" ; and (2) "God created the world by an act of free will" entails (with certain auxiliary premises) "This is not the only possible world." Two of the positions, namely those of Aquinas and Leibniz, appear, contrary to these authors' intentions, to be committed to both antecedents and to the resulting inconsistency, whereas the third, that of Spinoza, seems committed to the truth of the antecedent of (1) and to the falsity of the antecedent of (2). I shall briefly establish these points first and shall in Part II consider the problem of free creation directly. I One would think that we cannot say both that this is the only possible world and that God created it by an act of free will. If this is the only possible world, it is logically impossible that God could have decided otherwise than as He did (assuming that God decided on its being this way) ; for God could not have created an impos sible world. Yet, "its being logically possible that one should have done other than as one did" is thus taken as a logically necessary condition of "having done what one did, freely"! Spinoza, Leibniz, and Aquinas accepted such a condition; and further, they agreed that "God could not have done other than as He did" entails "What God did not do is logically impossible," since the only limitations upon God's powers are limits of logical possibility. 2. Spinoza, as is well known, held both (1) and (2) explicitly and concluded that God does not act from free will. In Note II to Prop. 33 of the Ethics Spinoza says, "Although it be granted that will appertains to the essence of God, it nevertheless</page><page sequence="2">DID GOD CREATE THE ONLY POSSIBLE WORLD ? 15 follows from His perfection that things could not have been by Him created other than they are or in a different order." 1 Spinoza's arguments for the incompatibility of free will and absolute perfection2 are not cogent and his point might be dis missed were it not for other considerations which arise when we consider Leibniz and Aquinas. 3. Leibniz held (1) that God creates all things other than Himself freely, and (2) that this is the best of all possible worlds. But he also held (3) that God is determined to choose the best not by coercion but by reason.3 "In regard to will in general . . . choice follows the greatest inclination. . . . When God chooses, it is by reason of the best." And, in refuting Spinoza, Leibniz said, "God has been inclined towards those [individuals] by a deter mining reason, but He has not been necessitated." (W. 486). "God exists necessarily, but He produces things freely . . ." (W. 489) .4 in spite of his expressed difference from Spinoza, Leibniz said of our world in the Theodicy, that we know t(the best plan for the universe, which God could not fail to choose, made it so: We judge from the event itself; since God has made it, it was not possible to do better" (W. 519, 520). Answering the objection that Whatever cannot fail to do the best is not free, he replies that if doing the best is action by inclination based upon reasons and without constraint or displeasure, then this is the highest form of free action.5 1 And Prop. 32: "Will cannot be called a free cause, but only a necessary cause." And the Corollary I: "Hence it follows, first, that God does not act according to the freedom of the will." In Prop. 29: "Nothing in the universe is contingent, but all things are conditioned to exist and operate in a particular manner by the necessity of the Divine Nature." 2 See Note to Prop. 33. 3 Wiener, Scribner Selections, p. 435. * "The world is a voluntary effect of God, but on account of inclining or prevailing reasons. And even if the world should be supposed perpetual, nevertheless, God could either not have created it or could have created it otherwise, but He was not to do so. Spinoza thinks (EP 49) that 'God produces the world by that necessity by which He knows Himself.' But it must be replied that things are possible in many ways. ..." 5 Anticipating a difficulty we might raise, he says: "Nevertheless, although His will is always infallible and always tends toward the best, the</page><page sequence="3">16 J. F. ROSS Nevertheless he could not avoid Spinoza's position. For he describes God as the Absolutely Perfect being. And he says that an absolutely perfect being must act for the best (521, 522), since to act for anything less, or to decide for reasons less than the best not to act, would render such a being imperfect. Moreover, by grant ing the assumption of the objection mentioned (that God cannot fail to choose the best), he generates the position that this is the only possible world, as follows, (a) God is an absolutely perfect being, (b) God exists, (c) The perfect being does what is best. (d) Everything which differs from what God does is, in some way, less than the best. This is true and necessary, since God could not choose between two things which are equally "best," and there fore could not have acted at all unless the proposition were true. (e) Since whatever differs from what is best, qua best, must be in some way imperfect, God cannot do anything other than what He does, given (c). If God cannot do anything other than what He did, then all alternatives are logically impossible; for it is a logically necessary condition for anything other than God to exist that God should be able to produce it or have it produced. Thus Leibniz is committed to the first of our propositions, namely, "If God is absolutely perfect, this is the only possible world." But by his own insistence he is also committed to the second, that if God creates freely, this is not the only possible world; and since he maintains both antecedents, he contradicts himself. Leibniz, as well as Aquinas and Spinoza, holds that it is a logically neces sary condition for the truth of any proposition of the form "x exists" that God could have willed that x exist, since it is absolutely impossible for anything to exist which God has not willed to exist. Hence, for anything y which is not an element of the best, it is impossible that "y exists" be true, since, for Leibniz, evil or the lesser good which he rejects does not cease to be possible in itself; otherwise the necessity of the good would be geometrical or meta physical and altogether absolute. ..." (520-21). This, of course, trips Leibniz up; for nothing is possible in itself if it is not such that God can produce it (if it be different from God). One could escape this difficulty by saying "God is perfect and acts perfectly" is contingently true; but Leibniz would not accept this proposal.</page><page sequence="4">DID GOD CREATE THE ONLY POSSIBLE WORLD ? 17 it is impossible that God should will that y exist. Therefore, for Leibniz, the actual world is the only possible world. 4. The same inconsistency arises for Aquinas, who teaches that (a) God is an absolutely perfect being; (b) God created the world freely; (c) this is not the only possible world. The in consistency arises, just as it did for Leibniz, because Aquinas interprets the statement "God is absolutely perfect" in a way incompatible with the statement "God's decision might have been different from what it was." An objection was put to Aquinas as follows: "God wills things other than Himself in as much as He wills his own goodness. God wills his own goodness necessarily. Therefore He wills things other than Himself necessarily." To this Aquinas replied (I, 19, a. 3, corpus and ad 2) : (a) It is true God wills His own goodness necessarily; (b) it is true that God wills other things as ordered to His goodness, i.e., as embodiments of His goodness and perfection; but (c) when one wills an end one must will a particular means only if it is logically impossible to achieve the end without that means (where the one willing has complete knowledge). "Hence, since the goodness of God is perfect and can exist without other things in as much as no perfection can accrue to Him from things, it follows that for Him to will things other than himself is not absolutely necessary." (I, q.9, a.3, c) "That God does not neces sarily will some of the things that He wills does not result from a defect in the divine will, but from a limitation belonging to the nature of the thing willed, namely, that the perfect goodness of God can be without it." Aquinas in this way tries to show that God could not have created except by an act of free will, since the only things God necessarily wills pertain to His nature, and no finite thing is a necessary condition for the attainment of the object of will imposed by the nature of God. This is also his way of arguing that "God creates necessarily" is incompatible with "God is perfect." 6 6 Aquinas and Spinoza are diametrically opposed; the former saying that absolute perfection and necessary creation of finite things are in</page><page sequence="5">18 J. F. ROSS Yet, if we ask Aquinas, "when God, who freely decides to create, makes His decision, by what reasons is His will moved?" he replies : "It pertains, therefore, to the nature of the will to communicate as far as possible to others the good possessed; and especially does this pertain to the divine will from which all perfection is derived in some kind of likeness. Hence, if natural things, in so far as they are perfect, communicate their good to others, much more does it pertain to the divine will to communicate by likeness its own good to others as much as possible" (I, q.19, a.2, c). "Hence, although God wills things other than Himself only for the sake of the end, which is His goodness, it does not follow that anything else moves His will except His goodness" (la, 19, a.2, ad 2). The divine will "wills nothing except by reason of its goodness" (la, 19, a.2, ad 3). If God by the nature of His will communicates His goodness (even freely) to other things as far as is possible, then what is created is the only world that could have been created, for it is the world which contains the best possible expression of the divine goodness. Were God to create a different world, He would act in a manner contrary to the nature of His will.7 Thomas Aquinas concurs with Leibniz and Spinoza in premises which entail that anything that is such that it is impossible that God should will its existence, is impossible absolutely. All worlds compatible; the latter saying that free creation and perfection are incompatible. 7 Professor Thomas Langan, commenting on this paper at the APA Detroit Meeting, May 5, 1962, suggested that there is another interpretation of the expression 'as far as possible' in this context, an interpretation which will keep Aquinas' treatment consistent. He proposes that to say God communicated His likeness as far as possible to x, something God created, merely means that x, in as much as it has being, is a likeness of God, and that God could not have made it more like Him, given that x is the sort of being it is. I think this interpretation is defensible, although it seems to make the statement "God communicates His likeness as far as possible" a trivial thing to assert, since no one would ever have doubted its truth. Moreover, interpreting Aquinas this way exposes the fact that his theory can offer no reason whatever for God's creating the world he did create. Yet, this may merely be because Aquinas would have agreed with the contention of this paper that God could not have had a reason at all for choosing one possible world over another. If that is so, the only defect I can find with Aquinas is that his work was incomplete in that he did not say that no reason was possible for God.</page><page sequence="6">DID GOD CREATE THE ONLY POSSIBLE WORLD ? 19 other than the actual fulfill that condition, given what has just been reported; therefore the actual world is the only possible world. From this it follows that God does not create freely, since He cannot do the impossible, and all alternatives are impossible. Therefore, the free will of God and the perfection of God are incompatible, and Aquinas, like Leibniz, is inconsistent, unless we take the interpretation suggested by Professor Langan (see note 7) ; in that case, Aquinas is merely incomplete. II Taking as premises some propositions held in common by the three writers, let us consider the factors which generate this puzzle. They hold that (1) "God exists" is true, and God is an element of all possible worlds; (2) God is absolutely perfect; (3) if God acted freely He might have done otherwise than He did, since any end toward which creation was freely ordered could have been attained with another creation or none at all; (4) He could not have done otherwise than He did for the same reasons as those which determined Him to do what He did, since His reasons would be based upon merits perceived in the particular case; (5) whether God acts from free will or not, He must still act from internal inclination based entirely upon reasons; (6) there is some object, namely God's goodness or perfection, to which God inclines by nature, the divine will being the inclination toward that object. Aquinas and Leibniz maintain that the creation selected is one of a set of alternatives ordered to that end. However, these are not alternative ways of producing that end, but alternative sets of things which might be produced and perfected by being directed to it.8 In other words, the divine goodness or perfection is not an effect of creation but a reason (or motive) for it, or that which gives creating its point,9 and in that sense creation is ordered to God's goodness as to an end. The goodness or perfection of God 8 Aquinas offers this qualification in De Veritate, q.23, a.4, c. 9 My wishing all men well might be the reason I do a kindness to another, but is not an effect of it, although my doing the kindness is "ordered to my benevolence as to a Final Cause."</page><page sequence="7">20 J. F. ROSS is that-on-account-of-which God acted and in that sense serves as end. In fact, Aquinas says: (1) "The divine goodness serves His will as the reason for His willing all things, just as His essence is the reason for His knowing all things." (D.V.q. 23, a. 4). (2) "If natural things in so far as they are perfect communicate their good to others, much more does it pertain to the divine will to communicate by likeness its own good to others, as much as is possible." These last propositions, which I have called (1) and (2), are central to the paradox. First, (2) seems to be plainly false, as well as incompatible with the possibility of alternatives to what God has done. It seems manifest that no matter how perfect the likeness to God in anything which God has created, God could always create something else which is more like Him. Hence, it is not possible for God to communicate His likeness as far as possible (apparent paradox).10 In fact, Aquinas virtually says this in D.V. q.23, a.4: "No matter how much more nobly any pure creature is related to God, it is still possible for some other creature to be related to God and to represent the divine goodness in a manner equally noble." Given this, (2) would be fulfilled only if God created simul taneously everything He could have created alternatively. It is obvious that He did not11 and could not do so. Let us dis miss (2) as false both for creatures and for God, unless we accept the interpretation of note 7 ; then it is false for creatures but not for God, although Aquinas thought it universally true. (1) is a more serious matter. Aquinas clearly intends the expression "all things" to mean all things which exist. But why should not the divine goodness be equally a reason for creating all things which are compossible? One would wonder, if God did not create the most perfect set of compossibles, then why did He 10 This apparent paradox is resolved as soon as we notice that "It is not possible" qualifies a proposition, while in "communicate His likeness as far as possible," "possible" ranges distributively over states of affairs which collectively are not compossible. 11 This is obvious, because not everything which (considered in isola tion) God could create is compossible. God must have some additional reason by which to select among sets of things.</page><page sequence="8">DID GOD CREATE THE ONLY POSSIBLE WORLD ? 21 fail to, since He had reason for doing so, the only reason He could have for doing anything at all?12 This is part of the reason why Leibniz took the position he did, a position as inherently con tradictory as that of maintaining the possibility of a largest num ber. For it is self-evident that if God is infinitely perfect, there is no finite embodiment of divine perfection which is the most perfect possible (as Aquinas undoubtedly saw; see D.V. q.23, a.4). Leibniz is, therefore, necessarily wrong in his reason for thinking that God had to follow the "principle of greatest variety and minimum hypothesis" in making his choice, since neither that principle nor any other will select "the best possible world." Nevertheless, all three authors seem to think a free Creator would employ as a reason some standard, P, in selecting a world to create. Now it is either true that what is actual is the only set of things fulfilling P (the rule of selection employed), or it is true that some other set also does. If the former, and if it is also the case that a perfect being must follow P. then the actual is all that is possible. If the actual is not all that satisfies P, then the Creator needs a new standard P' in order to select among the worlds satis fying P. If P' is also such that a perfect Creator must adhere to it, the world which satisfies P and P' is the only possible world. In a word, in order for the actual world to be both created by a perfect God and to be only one of a number of possible worlds, it must not be the case that there is some standard of perfection P or P' which it is necessary that a perfect Creator follow and which, when followed, selects the particular world made actual. But if we assume that the Creator chooses among possible worlds by employing some reason, R, which it is not necessary that a perfect Creator employ in creating, then how does He decide upon R as His reason? Presumably He does this by employing 12 "God creates by reason of His goodness" may be read in Aquinas either as I have read it, "with His goodness as the reason or motive," or it may be read "because He is Good." In the latter case, His goodness is not asserted to be His reason, but our reason for what He did (or explana tion of why He did it). This second reading will not avoid the problem I raise later, although it will absolve Aquinas from my charges that he assigned an insufficient reason for God's doing what He did (since it would equally have been a reason for God's doing anything else you choose); on that reading, Aquinas assigned no reason whatever.</page><page sequence="9">22 J. F. ROSS principles for selecting reasons. By what principle could He select R over R'? He either has some reason Q for His selection or He does not. If He does, He either has Q by the fact that He is perfect or He does not. If He does not, He must have a reason for Q, and so on. If He has Q by nature, He could not fail to have R and hence may be said to have R by nature, with the result that the actual world is the only possible world. If He does not have Q by nature and has no reason for Q or has no reason for some reason for Q by nature, then He would fail to act, since at some point He will lack a reason for choosing. For authors like Aquinas and Leibniz, who implicitly suppose it impossible that God should create without a reason or with a reason for which there is no reason, this dilemma is insoluble; for their inconsistencies followed from the tacit assumption that God's determining reason is imposed by His nature in such a way that He could not be the sort of being He is if He did not follow that reason. Assuming that it is not possible that God should have a reason (except in a logically trivial sense) for every reason He has, and ruling out creation from no reason, He must have some reason because of what He is. This reason must be sufficient to move Him to what He does, rather than to something else. That reason cannot, therefore, move Him among alternatives which stand equally with respect to that reason, since He could not decide without new reasons, ultimately founded in His nature. Hence, He could have created only the world He has, and the other worlds become impossible. Considerations such as these show that the concepts of free action which we apply to God, like those employed by Aquinas and Leibniz, involve two different emphases: (a) that the activity proceed internally from the agent on account of its reasons and in the absence of sufficient external causes or conditions; (b) that it should be compatible with the nature of the agent that it should perform actions other than those it actually performs. It is seemingly plausible that God could be free in the first sense but not in the second, since the fulfilling of condi tion (a) does not have the fulfilling of (b) as a logically necessary condition. Spinoza described the situation where (a) is satisfied and (b) is not, as a case of acting according to one's will, but not</page><page sequence="10">DID GOD CREATE THE ONLY POSSIBLE WORLD ? 23 freely. His proposal that God acts thus, fails simply because we know that things other than what is actual are possible, and we will allow no argument to convince us of the contrary. We would more readily reject the proposition that God exists or that God is absolutely perfect or that every possible world contains God as an element, than we would the obvious consistency of some false propositions. Nevertheless, Aquinas and Leibniz have succeeded no better with what looks like the only alternative to Spinoza's view. The nub of the whole problem seems to be this: When God created the world, He did so either (a) from the necessity of His nature (in the way in which Aristotle thought man willed his own happiness, Aquinas thought God willed His own perfection, and Spinoza thought He willed the world) ; or (b) from external causes which moved Him to create; or (c) from reasons which moved Him to create. The first alternative being rejected because of our insuperable belief that things other than the actual are logically possible, the second is also rejected as inconsistent with the notion of God as the perfect (and therefore independent) creator. The third alternative admits of several interpretations: (i) God may have derived His reasons from the necessity of His nature, in such a manner that, being what He is, He could not have had any reason other than the reason He did have; (ii) God may have derived His reasons from external causes; (iii) God may have freely chosen His reasons. (i) If God derived His reasons from the necessity of His nature, He could not have had reasons different from those He had. If those reasons were sufficient to move Him to what He did and to no alternative, then He could not have followed an alternative; alternative courses of creation are impossible. But this is false; therefore the supposition that the reasons for creation were entirely derived from the nature of God is also false. (ii) That external causes should have supplied God with reasons (in the manner in which some of our reasons are imposed upon us by environment) is absurd and incompatible with the nature of God.</page><page sequence="11">24 J. F. ROSS (iii) Therefore, God must have chosen His reasons. But this choice is either based upon reasons or it is not. If it is not, then God can be said to have had, at bottom, no reason for what He did and there is no sufficient reason for the fact that what was done is what it is, rather than something else. To imagine the selection of this world to be entirely arbitrary because God chose His reasons arbitrarily seems incompatible with our concept of God as the fully intellectual being. But if God's choice of reasons for creating was based upon other reasons, namely reasons for His reasons for creating, then we must inquire into the origin of those reasons. Either God has a reason for each reason He has, and has each reason because of a choice based upon some other reason which He also chose to have, or He has some reason from His nature. The infinite series of reasons based upon prior choices is as much in need of a principle of sufficient reason as any series of things. Why did God employ the series R, rather than some other series? If it be said that R alone of all alternatives is compatible with God's nature, then the first alternative is reduced to the second and what happens is all that is possible. If the set R is not the only set compatible with God's nature, then there must have been a reason for His following this rather than the others. This reopens the whole mystery. Thus the only alternative to Spinoza seems to be a theory that the decision of God is based upon an infinite series of reasons plus an infinite series of reasons for the selection of the series of reasons selected. A similar mystery does not arise in the consideration of human acts, since we readily admit that some of our beliefs which function as reasons are derived from external causes, being neither innate nor (at least directly) the result of our free choice that certain things should be facts. Such a solution does not seem possible in the case of God. I think there can be no satisfactory evaporation of this dilemma as long as we use the anthropomorphic concept of free choice-based-on-reasons to describe God, while we vigorously deny the possibility of God's acquiring reasons from external causes. I would even say that our concept of free will as applied to God becomes inconsistent when the possibility of reasons which originated from external causes is ruled out, and that that in</page><page sequence="12">DID GOD CREATE THE ONLY POSSIBLE WORLD ? 25 consistency appears precisely in those contradictions which beset Aquinas and Leibniz. There, is, of course, another answer to the problem: that all three authors are wrong; that God is not an element of all possible words, or that since the supposition that God creates necessarily leads to an obvious falsehood, and since the supposition that God creates freely leads to absurdity in that what He did was arbitrary, then either "God freely creates" is false or "God exists" is false. It seems that these answers are too expensive, given the simpler alternative of revising our concept of free act, at least as we apply it to God. University of Pennsylvania.</page></plain_text>
