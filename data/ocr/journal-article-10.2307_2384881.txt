<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bunsh6 S6shi The Tale of Bunsho, the Saltmaker Translated by JAMES T. ARAKI p ICTIONAL narratives of the late Muromachi period, commonly called otogi- zoshi OPOonV#, were generally circulated in the form of profusely illustrated booklets and scrolls (known collectively as nara-ehon * The illustra- tions generally provide details of scenic and social settings, suggest the tone or mood of the story (aristocratic, plebeian, religious, heroic, tragic, and so forth), reveal the dramatic relationship among the characters, and occasionally convey the gist of the story to the illiterate. The significance of some tales-specifically those describing the origin of a religious institution or depicting the society of non- human creatures-would be greatly reduced in both the original and in translation if the illustrations were eliminated. Nara-ehon produced in the post-medieval era-these constitute the vast majority of those extant-are thought to be the products of cooperative efforts of calligra- phers, painters, and other artisans. Although it would seem reasonable to assume that particular scenes would have been selected to depict the story visually, often the illustrations, however appealing, fail to tell the story. Nevertheless, the visual impact of the illustrations doubtless influenced the reader-viewer's perception of the story. In some versions of Bunsho S5shi 5CIE-c 5 U ('The Tale of Bunsho'), for example, scenes of working people are excluded so that the series of illustrations presents the reader with a somewhat aristocratic view of medieval Japan, whereas in other versions the more memorable scenes are those of saltmaking and of the protagonist toiling to gather firewood for the salt kilns. There are essentially two versions of Bunsho Soshi. The principal difference between the two is length. The basic story being virtually identical, the shorter may be considered a condensed variant of the longer or, conversely, the longer may be considered an expanded variant of the shorter. For convenience, I shall refer to them, respectively, as the Short Text and the Long text. THE AUTHOR is Professor of Japanese Litera- ture at the University of Hawaii.

Let us inquire into the reason for this felicity. In Hitachi, a province of sixteen counties, there was a miraculous shrine dedicated to the Great Diety of Kashima.2 The priest who served the shrine was known as the Grand Priest, and he was ex- traordinarily wealthy. On his land, fanning out in the four directions, he built forty thousand storage vaults, which he filled with the seven rarities and myriad treasures. There was nothing he lacked; indeed, he had his every wish. He possessed much of everything-eighteen thousand houses, innumerable servants, and, of ladies-in-waiting and female attendants, 860 in all. His five sons were handsomer and more skillful in the letters and arts than all the other men in the province. Among the menials working for the Grand Priest was a man named Bunda, who had been in his service for many years. Although he was a lowly servant, he was honest and held his master in high regard, serving him with diligence day and night, taking care to obey his every wish. 2 KashimaJinja ,!Afib*, located in present- day Kashima-cho, Ibaragi-ken, by the ninth century, was among the great Shinto shrines of the country and was by far the most im- portant in Hitachi province. The deity en- shrined is Takemikazuchi , offspring of Izanagi k the first anthropomorphic deity in the Shinto pantheon.</page><page sequence="4">224 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxviii: 3 The Grand Priest may have thought to put Bunda's character to the test. 'You have been in my service for many years,' he said to Bunda, 'but you do not please me. Go wherever you wish and make your living. If you mend your ways, you may return.' Bunda realized that he was but one among the thousand, even myriad, servants, but he had intended to devote his entire life to serving the Grand Priest. He knew he must obey that command, but nevertheless, he thought to himself, 'Wherever I may be, I will always feel concern for my master, and I shall some day return to him.' Bunda had no particular destination in mind as he set out, and soon he came to the coast of Tsunooka, to the shores where salt was manufactured. He ventured into the house of a saltmaker and said, 'I am a traveler. Please be kind to me and help me.' Although the saltmaker knew nothing at all about him, he was moved by Bunda's plea and allowed him to stay. After many days had passed, the saltmaker said to Bunda, 'Rather than remain idle, you might at least go out and fetch firewood for the salt kilns.' 'A simple matter,' Bunda said, and off he went to fetch firewood. Being a strong man, he would bring back more than five or six men's load. The saltmaker was delighted, and he cherished him. After passing some years in this manner, Bunda thought that he would like to manufacture and sell salt. 'As a reward for having served you all these years, let me have a salt kiln,' he said. 'I have no dependable means of earning a living, and would like to try my hand at a trade.' The saltmaker, who had become fond of Bunda, gave him two kilns,3 and Bunda began to sell the salt he made. 'Bunda's salt', as it became known, had a pleasant taste, and those who used it were never sick and remained ever youthful. The 3 Bunda's benefactor disappears from the story and is not mentioned again in either version of the tale.</page><page sequence="5">ARAKI: Bunsho Soshi 225 amount of salt he made was immeasurable, for each of his kilns produced thirty times as much as the usual kiln. Soon he was a man of considerable means. Several years later he had become so wealthy that all the saltmakers on the Tsunooka coast looked up to him. Bunda adopted a grander name, Bunsho Tsuneoka. His holdings amounted to seventy-five cho of land surrounded by a moat, and everywhere within it he built storehouses, of which there were eighty-three, and houses, of which there were ninety. Indeed, he could be considered the equal of the fabulously rich Sudatta of an age long ago.4 'It's not so much who you work for, but what you get paid that counts. Why worry about loyalties?' Such were the sentiments of the people of Hitachi, for times had changed and they all went to work for Bunsho. Bunsho's household now included more than three hundred housemen and servants, and there were un- counted reapers and other menials besides. Bunsho thought that he was richer than the richest of the lords endowed with the Ten Virtues.5 Bunsho, however, had neither sons nor daughters-he was childless. When the Grand Priest was told about this, his curiosity was aroused, and he decided to summon Bunsho to ask him why. Bunsho was delighted to receive the summons and hastened to comply, for he had not been back in a long while. He remained humbly in the main garden. The Grand Priest saw him and told him to come closer; he would not have Bunda remain in the garden, for, despite his humble origin, he was now a successful man. Bunda thereupon moved up onto the veranda. 'Bunda, you have become a man of unlimited wealth,' the Grand Priest said, 'and I have heard that you dare to ask if anyone, even the Lord Endowed with the Ten Virtues, could be greater than yourself. Why do you speak so irreverently?"6 'Although lowborn, I have acquired riches, but not the good sense to be mindful of propriety. Indeed, I spoke carelessly,' Bunda replied in a respectful manner. 'How rich are you that you may entertain such a thought?' the Grand Priest asked. 'I have so much of gold, silver, figured silk, brocade, the seven rarities, and the myriad treasures that I cannot count them all, and countless, too, are the store- houses that stand in rows on all parts of my land.' Thus did Bunda reply. 'How fortunate you are to have been so successful! Now, do you have children to perpetuate your line?' 'Not as yet,' Bunda replied. 'That is most unfortunate,' said the Grand Priest. 'Man can have no greater treasure than children. Offer your treasures to the gods and Buddhas, and ask them to bless you with children-even one child would do.' What the Grand Priest said stood to reason. Bunda went home, and without I A wealthy man, in Japanese known as Shudatsu Xit, who devoted himself to the historical Buddha and built the fabled Jetavana Temple, where the Buddha stayed for more than twenty years.

His wife protested loudly, asking what had come over him. 'The Grand Priest regrets our being childless,' Bunsho said. 'Have a child, and have it quickly!' 'How can I hope to bear a child now that I am forty,' his wife replied, 'when I could not when I was thirty, even twenty? There is nothing I can do about it.' True indeed, Bunsho thought, but he recalled what the Grand Priest had said about praying to the gods and Buddhas. 'In that case,' he said, 'go to the gods and Buddhas, and seek their blessing.' ,~~~~~~ ~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ......... ... Thinking this was reasonable, his wife observed ritual abstinence for seven days, and went to pray to the Great Diety of Kashima. She offered many treasures, made obeisance thirty-three times, and uttered the prayer, 'Grant me my wish to bear a child.' At midnight of the seventh night, the deity graciously opened the doors of the Hall of Treasures and spoke to her in a voice wondrously clear: 'Unable to refuse your request, I have been searching everywhere these seven days for a suitable child. I could not find one. However, I shall bestow these upon you.' He gave her two clusters of lotus, then vanished from sight.7 Bunsho was delighted, and said to his wife, 'Give birth to a boy who will be without peer within the eight provinces.' At the end of ten months, following on nine months of distress, she gave birth to a child-a girl who lacked not one of the thirty-two aspects of beauty.8 'How dare you go back on your promise and give birth to a girl!' said Bunsho, 7 The lotus is associated with Amida Bud- dha, in whose Western Paradise his devotees hope to be born and there renew associations with loved ones by dwelling on the same leaf of a floating lotus. 8 The thirty-two distinguishing physical marks of a Buddha, such as slender legs, curly body hair, blue eyes, and a bump on the top of the head.

The more elderly among the female attendants interceded. 'Among children,' they said, 'it is the girls who ultimately bring prosperity and good fortune.'9 'Bring her in, then,' Bunsho said, and he thereafter treated the child with great affection. He chose beautiful women to serve as her nurse and attendants. In the following year his wife gave birth to another child, a girl of even greater radiance. 'What is it?' Bunsho asked. 'The usual,' she replied. 'You went back on your word once before,' said the irate Bunsho. 'Why do you always disobey me? Take the child with you and leave!' There was really no end to his complaining. Those in his presence argued with him thus: 'If you had sons, they would, at best, be employed by the Grand Priest. But you have daughters of exceptional beauty, and who amongst the many daimyos of these provinces would not want to marry them? Perhaps the sons of the Grand Priest will be their bridegrooms. Could you hope for more?' 'Bring her in then, right away,' said Bunsho, persuaded by their arguments. He saw that the baby was even more beautiful than her sister, and again he selected a group of beautiful women to serve as nurse and attendants. Recalling the porten- tous dream and the gift of lotus, he named the elder daughter Lotus Flower, and the younger, Lady Lotus. The two were brought up with affection and, with the passing years, grew up to be girls of radiant beauty. They excelled at reading, calligraphy, and the other skills, and were peerless in the arts of poetry and prose. The daimyos of the eight provinces heard about Bunsho's daughters, and they vied to win their affection. There was no end to the stream of tender letters they I The theme of a woman of great beauty aspiring to become empress was apparently popularized as a result of its prominence in Heike Monogatari * `, the principal narrative material of medieval bards.</page><page sequence="8">228 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxviii: 3 sent. But the girls grieved at their having been born in the provincial Eastern Land. Had they been born in the region of the capital, they might have aspired to the position of imperial consort, and their lives would have had some meaning. They could not bear the thought of a humdrum life. Bunsho considered it an honor to receive offers of marriage from all the daimyos in the land. He said as much to his daughters, but they turned a deaf ear to him and continued to abide as before. Neither Bunsho nor his wife pressed the matter, for they did not wish to go against their daughters' wishes. The girls had begun to ponder their afterlives and went on pilgrimages regularly. Soon it was rumored that some daimyos would abduct them as they traveled to and from temples. When Bunsho heard this, he had a Hall of Worship built in the western part of his mansion,'0 and had statues of the Amida Trinity installed there for his daughters to venerate whenever they wished. Because of this precaution, the daimyos would not be able to abduct the girls. When the Grand Priest hears about this, he summoned Bunsho and said to him: 'I have heard-and could it be true ?-that you have daughters of radiant beauty. They must not marry any daimyo. They must marry my sons.' Bunsho was gladdened and returned home. 'How lucky we are! We shall have the sons of the Grand Priest as bridegrooms! Get ready, all of you!' He was ranting in his excitement. He then went to his daughters. 'How lucky we are!' he said to them, 'The Grand Priest has said he will have you as his sons' brides.' He was aghast to see his daughters looking miserable, tears welling in their eyes. 'Neither of us can hope to become an imperial consort or empress, nor may we chance to fall in love with a high-born nobleman,' they said, 'and so we shall be- come nuns and pray for a blessed afterlife.' When the embarrassed Bunsho described what had happened, the Grand Priest became angry. 'Your daughters being what they are, I cannot believe that they despise me. Unless you send them to me quickly, I shall have you punished.' With that, Bunsho returned to his daughters and related what had happened. 'Whether a person is lowborn or of exalted rank has nothing to do with affairs of the heart,' they said. 'We have only one wish-to become nuns so that we may shun this grievous world. If we are denied our wish we shall drown ourselves in the deep of the river.' Thus they lamented. Bunsho wept tears of anguish, then went back to the Grand Priest and related what had happened. 'If they are so deter- mined, there is nothing we can do,' said the Grand Priest. Some time later, a man named Michishige, an archivist of the Palace Guards, came to the province of Hitachi as the newly appointed governor. Being inclined excessively to philandering, he desired a woman of exceptional beauty; he did not care whether she was from the remote hills or was a woman of the lowliest sort. The lords of the province competed to present him with women, but the Governor found none of them attractive and continued to live alone. 10 The westerly orientation is related to the belief that Amida's paradise exists in the west.</page><page sequence="9">ARAKI: Bunsho Soshi 229 Then he heard the following: 'There is a man named Bunsho, a menial in the ser- vice of the Grand Priest of Kashima. He has daughters of radiant beauty. They have refused offers of marriage from all the daimyos of the land. One might even think that his daughters were celestial maidens descended from heaven. You should order the Grand Priest to bring them to you.' The Governor was delighted. He summoned the Grand Priest and said to him, 'I have been told that a menial in your service by the name of Bunsho has daughters of exceptional beauty. Make the necessary arrangements on my behalf, and my governorship shall be your reward.' 'You are very generous,' the Grand Priest replied, 'but those girls have never complied with such requests. They even disobey their parents. Nevertheless, I shall see what I can do.' And he took his leave of the Governor. Bunsho had accompanied the Grand Priest and was summoned to his presence. 'This is a very auspicious occasion,' the Grand Priest said. 'The Governor has ordered me to present one of your daughters to become his lady. If I do so, he will reward me with the governor's post. I shall then make you the deputy governor. What greater honor could we receive?' 'Your words are most gracious,' replied Bunsho, obviously pleased. 'But my daughters do not heed me, and I wonder what they will say to this,' he added, and he returned to his home. 'How lucky we are!' he called out, even as he was walking through the gate. 'It is so true that one should have daughters. I shall be the Governor's father-in- law. Quickly, all of you, prepare to accompany us!' 'Oh, how lucky we are!' he exclaimed to his daughters. When he related the particulars to them, they refused to listen, and wept tears of anguish. 'It is quite deplorable that you should refuse such an offer,' said Bunsho, and his wife expressed her agreement. 'If I fail in this, what will become of me, Tsuneoka?' But however much he pleaded with his daughters, they would not even answer. When he persisted in his plea, they said, 'We rejected the sons of the Grand Priest, and so he must think quite ill of us. We may as well drown ourselves.' Bunsho could do no more. He went to the Grand Priest and described what had happened. The Grand Priest related the whole story to the Governor, who said, 'I was content with this dreary provincial life while I sustained my hope of meeting one of those ladies. Now even that hope is gone.' And he left for the capital. After many days Michishige, the archivist of the Palace Guards, arrived back in the capital. First he called on the Prime Minister at his residence. It so happened that the people there were exchanging tales about the various provinces, and Michi- shige related what had been occupying his thoughts: 'In any province, I doubt if one will find such strange people as those in Hitachi.' The Prime Minister's son, a captain holding the second court rank, was listening, and when he asked what this was all about, Michishige gave the following reply. 'There is a man named Bunsho who is a menial in the service of a person known as the Grand Priest of Kashima. Because of a fate predetermined in his previous</page><page sequence="10">230 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxviii: 3 life perhaps, he has come into possession of large amounts of the seven rarities and myriad treasures, and he leads a joyous and prosperous life. Moreover, through the grace of the Great Deity of that locality he has been blessed with two daugh- ters. They are refined and gentle, and in their radiant beauty, character, and accomplishment in the performing arts they are quite unlike ordinary mortals. I heard this and offered to marry one of them, but they showed no signs of consenting. Everyone, including Bunsho's master, the Grand Priest, and the daimyos of the many provinces, sent them offers of marriage, but they refused to listen. They do not even heed their own parents.' The Captain was pensive as he listened. He fell in love with the women although he had not seen them and, before long, succumbed to illness. Around that time, court nobles of high rank were competing to have their daughters received as the Captain's wife, but he refused them all and remained in his sickbed. His father, the Minister, and his mother prayed frequently on his behalf. Some months passed, and it was now mid-autumn. The Captain rose from his bed and came out to view the flawless moon, and those about him performed music and joined in various amusements to console him. He recited this poem: Tsuki mireba Yaran kata naku Kanashiki o Koto tou hito no Nado nakaruran When I see the moon I am moved to a sadness Unrelenting! Why is it that no one comes To see me, to console me? He brought his sleeve to his face and was awhile in tears. Hyoe-no-suke saw him retiring to his room to lie down, and he thought to himself, 'My lord's curious behavior puzzled me, but I should have known that he was nursing a secret love.'</page><page sequence="11">ARAKI: Bunsho Soshi 231 Together with Shikibu-no-taifu and To Uma-no-suke he went to the Captain. 'To think that you would not tell us about a matter that touches you so deeply,' they said. 'We would even go to China on a quest for you. Tell us what troubles you.' Although the Captain felt ashamed to have his hidden yearning known, he said, 'I know that I have been beside myself. I could open my heart to no one, but I no longer have reason to keep my secret. Since spring, when I heard the archivist of the Palace Guards describe the beauty of the daughters of Bunsho, a menial in the ser- vice of the Grand Priest, I have thought only of them. I would send for them, but surely this would bring reproaches upon myself. So I must abide thus, tormented by thoughts of love.' And he wept. 'Since ages ago it has been thus when one is in love,' the men said. 'Let us ac- company you to the province of Hitachi.' When the Captain heard this, his joy was boundless. Their minds were made up, and now they wondered in what guise they might travel. The Captain was so hand- some as to be conspicuous even in the capital; in the remote Eastern Land he could not possibly keep his identity hidden. After much deliberation they hit on the idea of disguising themselves as merchants with a variety of wares to peddle. They each carried a shoulder pack containing various goods and were about to leave for the provinces. The Captain wished to see his parents once more before embarking on the distant journey. When he came into his parents' presence, they were overjoyed. 'For some reason you seemed to be in a rather poor state,' they said, 'and so we are delighted to see you up and about.' The Captain was moved to tears when he thought how his parents, unaware of his intention to travel to a faraway land, would grieve after he had left. His parents, too, bedewed their sleeves with tears. The Captain summoned up his courage to take leave of them, but his heart was filled with sadness. On the sleeve of a robe he had discarded, he inscribed this poem: Azumaji no Katami tote koso Nugioku ni Kawaru made to wa Omou na yo kimi Let this robe Be a keepsake while I am away In the Eastern Land- Fear not that I have exchanged it For a robe of unaccustomed hue." He put on straw sandals and an ordinary robe, neither of which he had worn before, and assumed the appearance of someone of humble station. The men in his com- pany followed suit. The Captain was then eighteen, and Shikibu-no-taifu twenty- five. Although they were young, they were courtiers of high rank. But, however common a disguise they would assume, they were far too handsome to be mistaken for ordinary people.

As they traveled on their way, the Captain composed poems and, rapt in serene thought, was touched deeply by whatever came into his view, even by grass and trees. As he journeyed on with his companions, he caught sight of a certain mountain and was moved to compose this poem: Mi o shireba Koi wa kurushiki Mono zo tote Sakoso wa shika no Hitori nakuran My heart knows That love is fated to be All-tormenting.... Is this what the solitary deer Tells us in its plaintive cry? He felt envious of the bright moon in the cloudless sky at morning twilight, and composed this poem: Urayamashi Kage mo kawarazu Sumu tsuki no Ware ni wa kumore Aki no sora kana How I envy The brightness of the moon, Ever unclouded! Your mistiness is due to tears, 0 moon in the autumn sky. Shikibu-no-taifu composed this poem: Meguriawan Hodo koso kumoran Tsukikage wa Tsui ni kumoi no Hikari mashinan Will the moon Stay beclouded till the day I meet my beloved? May it some day brighten The realm above the clouds. In this way, pausing to take notice of everything felicitous, they passed the Eight Bridges in the Province of Three Rivers. The olden days, when one's lady was accustomed to wearing exquisite robes, seemed not to be olden at all, they thought, and their minds wandered in as many directions as the eight-channeled river.'2 On a mountain pass they encountered an old man of seventy or eighty. 'What sort of people are you?' he asked. 'We are merchants carrying goods from the capital to sell in the province of Hitachi,' they replied. 'You do not appear to be merchants at all,' he said. 'I believe you are the Captain of the Second Court Rank, the son of the Prime Minister. I see you have taken to travel on the uncertain byway of love. At the end of this year you will surely meet the woman you love. I foresee this clearly.' Although the Captain was a little frightened, he was pleased to hear that he 12 This set of images-'Eight Bridges' (Yatsuhashi JY), 'Three Rivers' (Mikawa --t province), 'lady accustomed to wearing exquisite robes' (karakoromo kitsutsu narenishi tsuma U A it A s --) 1LC '), and 'eight- channeled river' (kumode WR*)-is taken from Ise Monogatari O*;0, Episode 8. The motif of unexpectedly meeting another traveler on a mountain pass is also from the same episode.</page><page sequence="13">ARAKI: Bunsho Soshi 233 would be joined with his beloved, and he presented the old man with a silk robe. 'I am the renowned Old Soothsayer,' the old man said, and he vanished. Heartened by what had happened, the Captain pressed on his way, unmindful of the aches in his legs. It goes without saying that the Prime Minister's household was in an uproar over the disappearance of the Captain. Naturally the Prime Minister's lady suffered much distress; so, too, did everyone else in the city. Because the Captain had been melancholy, they wondered if he might have harbored resentment over matters unknown to them. So they inspected his quarters, and when they saw the poem he had inscribed on the sleeve of his discarded robe they felt somewhat relieved. In due course the Captain and his companions arrived in the province of Hitachi. First they went to the shrine of the Great Deity of Kashima and there spent the night in prayer. 'Grant me my wish to meet the daughters of Bunsho,' the Captain prayed repeatedly through the night, and then they left at daybreak. They stopped at a certain house to enquire about the way, and the man of the house guided them to Bunsh6's estate, a spacious seventy cho enclosed by walls. The Captain stood there awhile admiring the mansion, which was unusually splendid in such a pro- vincial setting. A maid came out to speak to him. 'Who are you? she asked. 'I have come from the capital to sell my wares.' 'You will be welcome here,' she said. 'Let me tell them about you.' The Captain was delighted. Soon the maid returned and led them within."3 'Here is what I have to sell,' the Captain began. 'I have caps and hats, courtiers' 13 The following passage, a series of tradi- tional poetic images cast in rhythmic prose, was doubtless the highpoint when the story was read aloud.</page><page sequence="14">234 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxviii: 3 clothes, purple trousers, scepters, fans. As for ladies' clothes, here you see woven into fabrics the many-colored blossoms of Yoshino and Hatsuse in spring and autumn-the red plum, white plum, the cherry-and strands of the willow swayed by the spring breeze into tangles, as are my thoughts of love, and here, a pattern that prefigures the uncertainties of love, the chrysanthemum-and-rivulet, whose ripples may be heard but not seen, and the golden rose that reflects the glowing hearts of lovers who set sail on the boat for Tsukushi-the glow that nourishes my hope and sustains my life as it leads me to my heart's desire, to a love that may not be fulfilled.... Would you not like to wear these garments? 'For summer, feel the coolness within the enclosure for the cistern, see patterns of the duck and the Chinese mallard-this exquisite robe of iris hue, embroidered with one hundred poems on love. And, here, another robe in the color of utsugi blossoms, reminding me of the one I miss on nights of the full moon, the one whom I see and seek in the far north, in the hamlet of suppressed desire-oh, the pity of those whose thoughts are lost in the maze of the many-channeled river.. .. Would you not like to wear these garments? 'For autumn, tinted leaves of deep hue, as deep as my thoughts of love, a love that "imbues the hearts of two lovers"-indeed, this is the meaning of the name Aisome, the famous river, but merely a name with no meaning, perhaps? The sleeves, like fallen leaves, are of a color that entices me to the byway of love on which I wander, brushing the roadside grass, toppling the dewdrops thereon-a color as faded and faint as the drained hue of the white chrysanthemum.... Would you not like to wear these garments? 'In winter, beneath the snow, the roots of grasses are nourished, and so, too, is my yearning for my beloved-will I see her soon ? The smoke from Fuji fades in the sky, and such is my fated end-a pity! Would that she could know the torment in my heart! Such are the thoughts woven into these garments.... Would you not like to wear them? 'For spring, would you not like a red or white sash, or a screen, perhaps, or curtains ? 'We have other wares-lacquered boxes, inkstones, small trays, and vases from Mino, too. For the Festival of the Bountiful Harvest, we have combs, tissue, sheets of paper in deep hues of crimson and lavender, inksticks, brushes, and aloes wood, musk, and other perfumes. Among our fine pillows-the unusually delicate floral pillow, the reed pillow, the Chinese pillow, pillows of sadness for those lost on the byway of love, paired pillows scented with aloes wood, and pillows for new lovers. As for mirrors, would you not wish to buy this Chinese mirror, its silver backing sculpted with birds paired beak to beak, or this mirror, engraved with countless sparrows, warblers, and goldfinches?' Thus did he describe his wares with elegance, hoping there might be someone who would perceive his amorous intent. A great many persons were employed in Bunsho's household, but, being provin- cial folk, they were insensitive. One of the ladies-in-waiting, however, was from the</page><page sequence="15">ARAKI: Bunsho Soshi 235 capital; she had been assigned to attend Bunsho's daughters because of her refined sensibility, her skill in reading, calligraphy, and poetry, and her great beauty. She noticed that the merchant's appearance and bearing were not those of a commoner, that his entreaty betrayed unusual refinement. How strange! Might he be a young courtier of high rank who had come from the distant capital, enticed by what he had heard about the girls? She was puzzled, yet wary. 'Never before have I heard such a delightful solicitation by a merchant,' she told Bunsho. 'You must hear him.' Bunsho had the doors to his room opened, and he was highly pleased by what he heard. 'Whence have these gentlemen come that they can offer such a delightful solicita- tion? Do it again.' The men exchanged glances when they heard him speak, for surely, they thought, he must be the famous Bunsho. The Captain repeated his speech. Bunsho was so delighted that he had him repeat it again, and then again. And he wondered how he might contrive to detain them. 'Where have these gentlemen taken lodging?' he asked, and was glad when he heard them say, 'We came here directly and have not yet sought lodging.' Bunsho bade them enter the inner room. When they were given warm water to bathe their feet, T6 Uma-no-suke washed the Captain's feet and Hyoe-no-suke wiped them dry with a towel of soft silk. Although he was weary and emaciated, the Captain was surpassingly handsome. 'Such extravagance!' Bunsho's servants exclaimed. 'That man carrying a shoulder pack put his feet in our fancy basin, and one of the other men washed his feet for him and another wiped them with a fine piece of silk.' And they laughed. 'We must honor the merchants from the capital,' Bunsh6 said. 'Serve food that has been well prepared.' A tray bearing eight varieties of food was placed before each of the visitors. Because the Captain's companions removed the dishes from their trays and placed them on the floor, the people said, 'How comical these men from the capital are! They let that skinny man eat from the tray, but they put their own dishes on the floor and prostrate themselves as they eat. Maybe they're not used to eating from a tray. How funny!' And they laughed. Bunsh6 came into the room. He wished to drink with them and had a variety of side dishes brought in to accompany the wine. Seating himself in the place of honor, he took up a wine cup and said, 'As the proverb goes, "The master of the house is the lord," and so I shall drink first.' Having drained the wine cup thrice, he urged the Captain to drink. The Captain could not refuse, and he accepted the wine. His companions were astonished. 'Oh, the tragedy of love! Who beside the Prime Minister would dare drink before our lord does?' Thus did they lament as they shed tears. Although the Captain was dismayed, he could not refuse and he drank the wine. Encouraged by the effect of drink, Bunsho began to talk freely. 'Although I am lowborn, I have two beautiful daughters who were given to me by the Great Deity of Kashima. I have treasured them as though I was theirs to command. All the daimyos of the eight provinces sought their hands in marriage,</page><page sequence="16">236 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxviii: 3 but my daughters refused them. My own master, the Grand Priest, ordered them to become brides for his sons, but they would not obey him. A nobleman sent from the capital to be governor of this province also asked to marry one of them, but they refused, saying they wished to devote themselves to worshipping the Buddha. Among my daughters' ladies-in-waiting are many beauties. If you want women, I can provide you with ten, even twenty. Stay with us awhile and enjoy yourselves.' The Captain and his companions were much amused by what he said. Not long after, the Captain placed many splendid items in a box, which he then had delivered to the elder sister. 'We have seen many things, but never anything so exquisite,' the girls said to each other as they inspected the contents. Under an inkstone was a thin sheet of maple hue on which was written: Kimi yue ni Koiji ni mayou Michishiba no Iro no fukasa o Ikade shirasen Because of you I wander on the path of love; Would that you could know The depth of my love, as deep As the hue of the roadside grass! The elder sister blushed when she read it. Despite her bashfulness she studied the unusual grace of the calligraphy and glow of the fine ink. Of the many letters she had received over the years, none had been so elegantly written. Yet she became uneasy when she recalled the curious language with which he had fashioned his solicitation, and she was about to sent it back. But her ladies-in-waiting said to her, 'If you send back such an elegant letter, he will think that you lack sensibility. You must keep it.' This was reasonable, she thought, and so she kept it. The younger sister became envious when she saw those splendid items. Bunsho thereupon said to the Captain, 'I, Tsuneoka, have two daughters. My younger daughter is envious because the other has received gifts. Please favor her, too.'</page><page sequence="17">ARAKI: Bunsho Soshi 237 The Captain had anticipated this, and he sent her equally beautiful gifts. 'If you gentlemen are bored,' Bunsha said to his guests, 'you may find diversion at the Hall of Worship, which is west of here.' The men thereupon went to the Hall of Worship, and what they saw inspired awe and piety in them. The Captain was struck by the unusual presence of a lute and a koto that were placed against a wall. He picked up the lute and began to play. Hyoe-no-suke played the koto, Uma-no- suke the sho, and Shikibu-no-taifu the flute. They were so touched by their own music as to shed tears. The sound reached Bunsho's household. 'We have allowed men of no account into the Hall of Worship,' the people of the household said. 'Listen to that grat- ing. They might be tearing down the hedges and walls.' 'Find out what is happening,' Bunsho told them. Some ten persons went. Because they were so late in returning, another twenty persons went, and they did not return either. Still others went and did not return. Mystified, Bunsho rushed out to the Hall of Worship, and there he saw two to three hundred people seated in rows in the sand garden. As he drew nearer and perked his ears, he noticed that they appeared to have been strangely lulled by the musical performance. He could not believe that music could be so delightful, so ethereal. 'What a pity I could not hear such delightful and blessed music before!' he exclaimed. 'It has the effect of erasing my past sins. I must reward all of you.' And he presented them with many gifts. 'Traditional gifts for the groom, given in advance,' the men said, and laughed. The elder daughter kept her thoughts to herself. Her heart had been stirred by the letter she found under the inkstone, but she had no means of conveying her thoughts to him. Moreover, her thoughts were troubled: might he be inferior in rank to the Governor who had come from the capital in a time past? Meanwhile, Bunsho sent his guests this message: 'Play once again in your delightful style, for I should like my daughters to listen.' The Captain and his men were overjoyed. They straightened their garments and moved into the Hall of Worship. The sisters, too, dressed up, had their attendants and even the menials change into unaccustomed finery, and came into the Hall of Worship. The scene was one of such splendor as to bely its rustic setting, and the pervasive fragrance of aloes wood and musk so delighted the Captain that he was unusually serene as he played the lute. Hearing him play, the sisters could not find words that would adequately describe the noble quality of his playing and his exquisite technique. 'Though he may have been degraded, he must be a handsome man with elegant, noble qualities,' they thought to themselves. 'Would that the wind would stir!' Just then, a gust of wind lifted the bamboo blind behind which the sisters were concealed, and the Captain and the elder daughter caught sight of each other. In beauty she seemed to be the peer of no less than the fabled Lady Li and Yang Kuei- fei of the Han and T'ang dynasties.</page><page sequence="18">238 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxviii: 3 The men now performed with even greater zeal. The blended tones of the koto and lute were in concert with the sounds of the woodwinds, and the audience was so transported as to shed tears of bliss. Never had the girls' hearts been so deeply moved. Bunsho again offered a cup of wine to the Captain, who, having no recourse, drank the wine and returned the cup to him. 'I have told you this before,' Bunsho said. 'Do you dislike women? Among my daughters' attendants are many beauties. You may summon whoever pleases you. They are in the quarters north of here.' And he pointed in that direction. The men exchanged glances, for they knew what their lord desired. 'We shall be delighted,' they said, and they laughed. The Captain did not intend to spend that night in vain. After everyone had gone to bed, he crept into the quarters of the elder daughter. She had kept the latticed door open to gaze at the unclouded moon, for she could not erase him from her thoughts. When the Captain had worked his way quietly through the eight-fold hedges, she was startled to see the unexpected figure of a man, and quickly with- drew into her room. The Captain followed her and lay down beside her. 'Could it be he?' she wondered, feeling frightened and wretched. 'This affair is unthinkable,' she said to him. 'I would be saddened and ashamed if my parents were to learn that I had rejected other men only to lie with a merchant.' The Captain appreciated her protest, and so he related all that had happened, starting with what the archivist of the Palace Guards had told him. The girl began to lose her shyness as he talked on, and soon they formed intimate ties with each other. However long the nights are in autumn, this night, because it was shared by lovers, quickly turned to day.</page><page sequence="19">ARAKI: Runsho Soshi 239 Koikoite Aimishi yowa no Mijikaki wa Mutsugoto tsukinu ATiimalkura kiana Having yearned for so long For this first meeting of lovers, We lie on new pillows; But the night has been short, My whisperings of love endless.

'It shall be done,' Bunsh6 told the messenger. 'The Grand Priest wishes to listen to you,' he said to the merchants. 'Dress yourselves more splendidly than usual and play for him.' The Captain knew that his disguise would be revealed that day. He had brought with him a full set of clothes he ordinarily wore in the capital. When he donned his court robes and formal hat, blackened his teeth, and darkened his eyebrows, he appeared unbelievably, indescribably handsome. The people of Bunsh&amp;'s house- hold were astonished. What had become of the merchant? Had a Buddha or a deity appeared before them? _</page><page sequence="21">ARAKI: Bunsho Soshi 241 The Grand Priest arrived in a palanquin, accompanied by his five sons. When he looked toward the middle of the Hall of Worship and regarded the Captain, he was thunderstruck and leaped out of the palanquin. 'Indeed,' the astonished man said, 'I had heard that the Prime Minister was searching the land for his lost son, Captain of the Second Court Rank. I am amazed, for not even in dream could I have known you would be here.' And he humbled himself before him. Hy6e-no-suke stepped forth and said, 'You, Sadamitsu! Come forward!"4 When Bunsho heard this, he ran back to his house. 'It's unspeakable!' he said, sobbing violently. 'Above all, beware of merchants from the capital. They have slighted my lord in a most shameful way.' The Grand Priest summoned Bunsho and said: 'Were you not aware of the pres- ence of the Prime Minister's son, a courtier without peer whom we know as the Captain of the Second Court Rank? It is an unimaginable blessing.' When Bunsh6 heard this, he felt as if his senses would fail him, and he blushed, ashamed that he could not have known, even in dream, that the man he thought to be a merchant was the son of the Prime Minister. Again he returned to his house. 'Our son-in-law is the Head of the Land! The Head of the Land is our son-in- law!' He seemed crazed with joy. ,~~~~~~~~&gt; Y The Grand Priest himself helped carry the palanquin bearing the Captain to his residence. He sent word to the daimyos of the eight provinces, and they all has- tened to attend the Captain. 'She rejected us all,' they said, 'because she hoped to chance upon such good fortune.' The Captain wished to return to the capital together with his bride, and he started on his homeward journey. The daimyos of the Eastern Land escorted him with ten thousand mounted warriors. The Grand Priest's wife and many other 14 The Grand Priest's name is here introduced into the story for the first time.</page><page sequence="22">242 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxviii: 3 women joyfully enlisted themselves as attendants. Bunsh6, thinking there could be no better occasion to make use of the treasures stored in his countless vaults, embellished the carriage with gold and silver, and dressed the women in finery. Once in the capital, the party was the envy of every onlooker. The travelers arrived in the capital shortly after the tenth of the Third Month. The Prime Minister's lady in her boundless joy felt as if she were dreaming. 'Regard- less of whose child the bride may be, I must not look upon her with disdain,' she thought to herself, and so she was cordial to her. When the bride changed into seven- layer robes of wisteria hue, an elegant cloak of light lavender, and cherry-crimson trousers, she appeared surpassingly beautiful. 'How could she be the child of a man like Bunsho?' the Captain's parents wondered. 'She might well be an angel descended to earth.' Their affection for her knew no bounds. As his reward, the Grand Priest was given the province of Hitachi. The Captain called on the Emperor. The Emperor, who had missed his com- panionship, was overjoyed and promptly promoted him to Grand Captain. The Grand Captain replied to the many questions about his recent travels. 'The younger daughter must surely be nice,' the Emperor remarked. 'She is even better than her sister,' the Grand Captain replied. Shortly thereafter, an imperial pronouncement was made. When Bunsho was informed of it, he said, 'I am honored by the pronouncement. But I no longer have my elder daughter, and cannot live on unless I can keep my younger daughter with me here in the province and see her every morning, every evening.' His words were conveyed to the Emperor, whereupon the girl was summoned to the capital together with her father and mother. The Emperor saw that she was more beautiful than her elder sister, and his affection for her knew no bounds. Because Bunsho was blessed with these children, he was appointed Minister of State at the age of seventy. At that time he looked no older than a man of fifty.</page><page sequence="23">ARAKI: Bunsho S5shi 243 The younger daughter was made an imperial consort. Presently she was afflicted with unusual suffering, and everyone from the Emperor on down was disquieted; but their anxiety turned into boundless joy, and in ten months' time she gave easy birth to an imperial prince. The daughter of the Regent came to serve as his nurse. The grandfather of the new prince, the Minister of State, was soon promoted to Senior Councillor. Words are inadequate to describe the felicity and good fortune visited upon Bunsho, the lowborn saltmaker. His wife became known as the Lady of the Second Rank. To what good deed in the past might we attribute the fact that they were prosperous, took pride in their splendid life, retained their youthful appearance, and had many servants and young samurai at their command? All the ladies who attended them, regardless of their rank, were also esteemed and took pride in their exalted state. Presently the Senior Councillor had a pagoda built on a hill, boats launched in large rivers, and small rivers spanned by bridges, and he accomplished other good works too numerous to mention. He and all the others lived beyond the age of one hundred. As the first felicitous act of the year, you should read this story without fail.</page><page sequence="24">244 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxviii: 3 The Story and Its Significance 'In times past,' the famous novelist Ryultei Tanehiko wrote in 1841, 'following the customary "first calligraphy" in the New Year, girls performed their "first reading", a reading of Bunsho Soshi. This tradition is still observed by some of the great families."5 If this custom had been inspired by the injunction, 'As the first felicitous act of the year, you should read this story without fail,' then it was inspired by the Short Text of Bunsho Soshi, which concludes on this note. This would suggest that Bunsho Soshi was esteemed during the Edo period because it was an auspicious tale that augured well, particularly for commoners who hoped to be among the recipients of good fortune from the Shinto deities. Much has been written about the original significance of the story of Bunsho. Perhaps, as some have said, the story at first was intended to extol the Great Deity of Kashima, who could answer prayers of childless couples and whose magical powers brought prosperity to the saltmaking industry along the Kashima coast in present-day Ibaragi prefecture. The fictional 'coast of Tsunooka' apparently refers to the 'coast of Tsunoore', a subsection of Daido Village, concerning which we find the following remarks in a standard reference: '[Bunsh6] was a resident of this village. The village contains the former site of "the wealthy man's mansion"-the residence of the salt peddler Bunda. Residents of this area are said to make offer- ings of salt annually to the Kashima Shrine.'16 BunshJ Soshi has been described as the ultimate success story, expressing the as- piration and point of view of the newly risen medieval class of commoners, notably merchants. We may assume that a story in the oral tradition had been expanded through accretion and, perhaps, further modified and expanded as it was set down in writing. Most of the many extant manuscript copies of the story are products of the Edo period; only a few are known to have been transcribed and illustrated before the seventeenth century. Although I have heard of a copy with a dating of 1466, I know of no one who has actually examined it.'7 The original shape of the story is likely to remain conjectural. Efforts to discern that shape through field research have not yielded convincing results, for helpful local records date no earlier than 1823, and the recollections of the key informants, the 'knowledgeable village elders', go back no further than the early years of the present century.'8 Although local legends may have been transmitted orally down through the centuries, we cannot ascertain their origin; indeed, we know of prob- 15 From Yoshabako M#a i, a series of es- says by Ryuitei Tanehiko #P*90, cited, for instance, in Okada Keisuke 1 BIW1, 'Bunsho Soshi no Seiritsu' OIETh5@FL, in Kokugo Kokubungaku Ronkyu 1 No. 6 (September 1975), p. 69. 16 Yoshida Togo IEIFH)i, ed., Dai-Nihon Chimei Jiten k Fl Fuzambo, 1900, p. 3657. 17 Mentioned by Sorimachi Shigeo aRTPMA at the International Nara-ehon Study Con- ference, Kyoto, 1979. 18 See, for instance, Oshima Tatehiko tg BE, 'Bunda-ch6ja no Densetsu to sono Kiban' 5C,k-:t 6DO e 1 e d AS, in Kokugo to Koku- bungaku, LVII:5 (May 1980), pp. 98-109.</page><page sequence="25">ARAKI: Bunsho Soshi 245 able instances of so-called legends having been fashioned from themes and motifs in written literature.'9 We may first examine the texts in the hope that this may enable us to elucidate the less obvious. A contextual comparison of the Short Text of Bunsho Soshi, translated above, and the Long Text may provide clues to help us decide which of the two is the older. The humorous tone of the Short Text arises largely out of the elliptic narrative style. As the actions are described one following immediately on another, to the ex- clusion of narrative interstices needed to establish a gradual progression, the story assumes an erratic quality that provokes mirth. In consequence, Bunsho is depicted as a comically impetuous man. The effect of this elliptic style becomes apparent when this version of the story is compared with the Long Text, which relates the same basic story, yet exudes very little humor. For a comparison of details, I must resort to a hypothetical exemplar of the Long Text, for although the many versions are nearly identical, each varies some- what from the others. The following three versions, which I shall label texts A, B, and C, are probably adequate representations of the many variant texts :20 Text A: Shioyaki Bunsho. Three-volume nara-ehon, ca. Kan'ei period (1624-1643), Kyoto University Library. Text B: Bunsho no Soshi. Two-volume tanroku-bon of vertical format, published ca. Kan'ei period. Text C: Bunsho. Three-volume nara-ehon, ca. Kan'ei period, Chester Beatty Library, Catalog Number 1. Following are episodes in the Long Text, listed sequentially with commentary, which are significantly different from corresponding episodes in the Short Text. 1. Having come to the Tsunooka coast, Bunda is moved by the delightful zcenerv and cnmnnose this noem: Kokoro aran Hito ni misebaya Tsunooka no Shioya no keburi Nami no yorube o Could I but show Someone with sensibility Tsunooka- Smoke rising from its salt kilns, Waves rushing upon the shore! 2. When the Grand Priest hears that Bunsho has boasted, 'I doubt that even the Grand Priest is greater than I,' he summons him and accuses him of irreverence. Then, out of curiosity, he asks Bunsho how many children he has. (In the Short Text, the Grand Priest summons Bunsho because he has heard that the latter is 19 See, for instance, Nagazumi Yasuaki 7*0V, 'Okinawa no Yuriwaka Densetsu' in Bungaku i;Z, xxxviii:2 (February 1970), pp. 28-88. 20 For a modern reprinting of texts A and B, see Muromachi Jidai Monogatari Shu 2T *R'1q1t#3 Inoue Shobo, 1900, v, pp. 280- 317 &amp; 318-48. A microfilm copy of Text C is available at the Kokubungaku Kenkyui Shi- ryakan (National Institute of Japanese Litera- ture), Tokyo.</page><page sequence="26">246 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxviii: 3 childless; then, inexplicably, he accuses him of irreverence; also, he addresses him by his former name, Bunda.) 3. The Grand Priest attributes Bunsho's lack of children to some wrongdoing in a previous life and offers this cogent reason for having children: if Bunsha were to die without issue, his wealth would be inherited by persons not of his own blood. (In the Short Text, the concern is solely over lineage, not money and property.) 4. Convinced that she is barren, Bunsho's wife urges him to acquire young consorts by whom he may have many children, but Bunsho is reluctant to have anything to do with other women. Only then does he urge her to enlist the help of the deity of Kashima Shrine, as the Grand Priest has advised. (Text A contains the additional motif of jealousy: the wife at first suspects Bunsho of coveting a younger woman.) 5. There is a long moment of suspense following the birth of the second daugh- ter as the female attendants hesitate to answer Bunsho's question. Bunsho is quite verbose in his expression of disappointment. (The conversational exchange in the Short Text is succinct: ' "What is it?" Bunsho asked. "The usual," she replied.') 6. The Grand Priest's given name, Sadamichi, is made known to the reader early in the story. (In the Short Text, it is introduced abruptly at a crucial turning point in the plot, thereby surprising the reader as well as Bunsho.) 7. The Captain, preparing to leave for Hitachi, composes two farewell poems. The additional poem, which he inscribes on a pillar (makibashira) in a way re- miniscent of Genfi Monogatari expresses his intention eventually to return; thus his parents have a valid reason for feeling relief when they read the poem after their son's disappearance from the capital. 8. Several poems, not found in the Short Text, are included in the passage describing the journey of the Captain and his companions. Their composers, their sequence, and placement in the text differ considerably among the variant texts. In Text B, the four travelers encounter the old soothsayer, who offers them joyful tidings and vanishes; listed together at this point, for no discernible reason, are five poems composed by the travelers and the soothsayer. In Text C, the five poems are interspersed in the narrative as contextual poems, thereby contributing to story interest: Because they were young, they were pensive and were moved deeply by the experience of travel. Nothing, not even the myriad herbs and trees, failed to catch their notice as they journeyed on, and they consoled themselves by reciting waka and composing Chinese verse. The faint cry of a deer was heard in the distance, and the Captain, re- minded of his own plight, composed a poem: Mi ni shireba Shika no koe sae Aware nari Sazo tsuma koi no Kanashikaruran Even the cry Of a deer inspires pity, For I, too, know How it must grieve As it yearns for its mate.</page><page sequence="27">ARAKI: Bunsho Soshi 247 Hearing the gradually weakening chirping of insects amid a dense growth of grass, Hyoe-no-suke composed this poem: Sanakida ni Kanashiki aki no Koro naru ni Aware o souru Mushi no koegoe In autumn, When I fall unawares Into sadness, Sweet sorrow is evoked By the chirping of insects. The others were deeply moved by these poems. 'In this world of ours what greater sadness can there be than the sadness of being in love?' they thought, as they shed tears. Shikibu-no-taifu and Toma-no-suke also composed poems: Urayamashi Yoso wa sayakeki Tsukikage mo Waga namida ni wa Kumoru yowa kana Sode no tsuki mo Tsui ni hikari no Harenubeshi Tazunuru hito ni Mevuriainaha How I envy Those parts that are brightened By the clear moon! Here, in the deep of night, It is beclouded by my tears. The moon, Reflected in the wetness Of my sleeve, Will surely vanish When I meet my sought-for beloved. Each having composed a poem, they resumed their journey, and the Captain was encouraged by his companions' words, 'You may be sure that all will be well in the end.' As the days multiplied they came upon the formidable Barrier of Fuwa.... It is at this point that the travelers encounter the soothsayer, who predicts a happy outcome to their adventure, composes the following poem, and then van- ishes from sight, to provide a fitting conclusion to this episode. Kumo no ue ni Meguriaitsutsu Yuku sue wa Tsuki no hikari no Terimasarinan Above the clouds Shall you rise in your quest For your love .... Then will you see the moon, Its brightness ever-increasing. 9. The scene shifts momentarily back to the capital, where the Captain's par- ents raise a great commotion over the disappearance of their son and, then, are somewhat relieved when they read the poem inscribed on the pillar. This episode, which contributes to narrative consistency, is missing in Text B. (In the Short Text, the poem which they read does not suggest their son's intention to return; this message would not be cause for relief, even though the narrator says it is.) 10. A touch of realism, not found in the Short Text, is provided by an expanded description of the chagrin and wrath of Bunsh6's wife when she hears rumors about her elder daughter sleeping with a merchant. An additional paragraph describes Bunsho's initial disbelief, his wish to keep the matter secret, and his ultimate resignation to the belief that this union has been preordained by fate. 11. Bunsho's confused state of mind when he is informed of the exalted identity of his daughter's paramour is described with greater skill.</page><page sequence="28">248 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxviii: 3 He ran about the house, shouting crazily: 'The son of the Prime Minister is in fact our son-in-law! The Prime Minister's son's wife is our daughter! Our daughter's husband is the Captain! He's the merchant! He's our son-in-law!' 12. Described in far greater detail than in the Short Text is the joyous reunion of the Captain and his parents and, in a long passage of some two hundred graphs (in Text A, some four hundred graphs), the great beauty of Bunsho's elder daughter. In Text A only, the beauty of the younger daughter is described at considerable length. 13. Unlike the Short Text, the tale concludes: '"What deeds did Bunsho perform that he should be a man blessed with such felicity and luck ?" everyone asked, and there was no one who did not envy him.' The Long Text is characterized by a leisurely narrative pace and greater em- phasis on plot in the sense of actions being motivated by believable causes. The manifest attitude toward commoners is more strongly condescending, and the provincial coarseness of Bunsho is magnified-for instance, when his elder daugh- ter discovers the exalted identity of her lover, she is 'mortified to think how he must regard the crude behavior of her father, Bunsho.' There are several elaborate descriptions composed in a pseudoclassical style, and they predominate toward the end of the story, when the setting has shifted to the capital. It is as if a person of the nobility had rewritten the story of Bunsho, expanding the narrative to provide plausible transitions between episodes, supplying additional poems and lyrical passages, and in general refining the tone of the story to agree with the tastes of the gentler inhabitants of the capital. Some specialists consider the Short Text to be an artless condensation that fails to tell the story with clarity and, furthermore, does scant justice to the 'purity' (which I take to mean 'quality of courtly literature') of the Long Text, which they presume to be the earlier version.2' I consider the artless aspects of the tale to be medieval ingredients with which the story was infused naturally as it first took shape. The conversation between the Emperor and the Grand Captain, for instance ('"The younger daughter must surely be nice," the Emperor remarked. "She is even better than her sister," the Grand Captain replied.'), seems fully consonant with the general tone of this make-believe tale, which is delightful because it is mildly zany. I doubt whether this is a condensation of the equivalent passage in the Long Text: 'Questioned by the Emperor, the Grand Captain respectfully related his story from start to finish. "A curious and unusual story," said the Emperor. "If the younger sister is so beautiful, I shall summon her." ' The fore- shortening at the beginning and the dizzying, rapid resolution of the story are also marks of traditional tales. The relatively consistent unity in tone would suggest that the Short Text exhibits greater stability as a story than does the Long Text. Descriptions of the naivete of provincial commoners suggests that the narrator 21 Satake Akihiro ftt4WHTxZ, 'Bunsho Soshi Saidoku' ; in Koten to Gendai t f a kA, Chuio Koron-sha, February 1974, pp. 261-62.</page><page sequence="29">ARAKI: Runsho Soshi 249 of the written tale was familiar with their outlook and behavior. Although the aristocrats of Kyoto were politically impotent and often economically destitute during the fifteenth century, when the tale of Bunsho was probably consigned to writing, they were glorified, quite literally exalted as dwellers in a celestial sphere, by provincial folk. The narrator regards the commoners with benign condescen- sion, as people so lacking in sensitivity that they would confuse courtly instrumen- tal music with the sounds of a building being torn apart. This point of view seems to be that of an ironic witness. I am inclined to believe that Bunsho Soshi grew out of a myth surrounding the deity of Kashima and legends about recipients of its blessings, and that it evolved in a way not unlike that of narrative literature in the West. Its formulaic character and consistent use of motifs shared by other medieval Japanese tales suggest an origin in oral composition. The 'traditional narrative', as described by Scholes and Kellogg, is a synthesis of sacred myth, quasi-historical legend, and fictional folk- tale, and emerging from this synthesis is the 'fictional narrative' comprising the 'romantic' and the 'didactic', two aspects intended to delight and instruct the reader.22 The 'traditional narrative', then, is narrative at an evolutionary (as distinct from 'transitional' or 'developmental') stage comparable, it would seem, to otogi-zoshi tales, such as Bunsho Soshi, in the history of the Japanese narrative. Such a Western concept may not be directly applicable to the study of Japanese literature, but it may be useful as a point of orientation in identifying narrative elements that may tell us something about the origin and spread of tales such as Bunsho Soshi in the distant past. 22 Robert Scholes &amp; Robert Kellogg, The Nature of Narrative, Oxford U.P., 1966, pp. 12-15, &amp; 50ff.</page></plain_text>
