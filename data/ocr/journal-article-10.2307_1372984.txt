WHAT Do WE MAKE OF HOLMES? ............ 508 APPENDIX: HOLMES AND UTILITARIANISM ............ 517 I. INTRODUCTION A. The Classical Conception of Judicial Self-Restraint We often discuss judicial character in the treacherously ambig- uous language of self-restraint. From ancient times onward, self-re- straint has figured prominently among the human virtues. It is a platitude of our political culture that judicial self-restraint should likewise be numbered among the judicial virtues, alongside incor- ruptibility, disinterest, fairness, and wisdom. Shotld we accept this platitude? That question animates the present Article. This formulation, however, puts the question badly. "Judicial self-restraint" in its most cogent usage designates not a personal virtue of judges but a structural relationship between the judiciary and other branches of government.' What I shall call the "classi- cal conception of judicial self-restraint" understands it to be a pol- icy regarding judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation, a policy according to which courts, and especially the U.S. Su- preme Court, should adopt a cautious or "deferential" attitude toward voiding legislation on constitutional grounds. Roughly put, the policy advises upholding legislation even when the judge entertains doubts about its constitutionality, and thus deferring to the legislature's implicit judgment that the legis- lation is constitutional. This proposition, in turn, has generally been taken to imply that the Supreme Court should uphold legis- lation unless it clearly bears no reasonable relation to a legitimate 1. Part of the confusion about judicial restraint arises because the term has come to possess multiple meanings, derived from the polemical purposes into whose service it has been pressed, which have skewed serious discussion. In the decade following Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), "judicial self-restraint" became in popular par- lance a kind of code word used for condemning judges who were willing to interfere with the workings of white racial prejudice. The best discussion I have seen of the multi- ple legitimate meanings of the term is RICHARD A. POSNER, THE FEDERAL COURTS: CRISIS AND REFORM 198-222 (1985). I have myself attempted to sort out several mean- ings in David Luban, Judicial Activism vs. Judicial Restraint: A Closer Look at the Bork Nomination, REP. CENTER PHIL. &amp; PUB. POL'Y, Fall 1987, at 9, 9-12. Judge Posner also emphasizes the important distinction between judicial self-re- straint and judicial personality.

It was this classical conception in its most recent incar- nation that Robert Bork defended in his ill-fated 1987 confirma- tion hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, when he argued that discrimination cases should be judged by means of a single level of judicial scrutiny-the "reasonable basis" test-instead of the multitiered scrutiny currently in use.2 The classical conception was developed and ramified by what might be called the main line of judicial self-restraint theorists: Harvard professor James Bradley Thayer, who proposed it in a celebrated 1893 article;3 Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes, Louis Brandeis, and Felix Frankfurter; and Yale professor Alexander Bickel.4 Holmes and Brandeis, personal friends themselves before either was on the Court, were acquaintances of Thayer, who had been Holmes's first legal employer and one of Brandeis's most esteemed professors. Frankfurter was a close friend of both Justic- es, and Bickel was Frankfurter's law clerk. We are speaking, therefore, of something like an apostolic succession, or, in Old Testament imagery, a bloodline of patriarchs. To flesh out the picture, one should include Frankfurter's close friend Learned Hand (another Thayer student),' Holmes and Brandeis's colleague Justice Harlan Fiske Stone, and Columbia professor Herbert Wechsler,6 the only member of the main line of restraint theorists 2.

Bork to Be Associate Justice of the Su- preme Court of the United States: Hearings Before the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 160-61 (1989) (statement of Robert H.

It is worth noting that Bork's best-known article on the subject of judicial review7 is based on Wechsler's work, though Bork subsequently disclaimed the controversial views he aired in that article.8 The classical conception of judicial self-restraint emerged, therefore, from a kind of intellectual Gemeinschaft almost unparalleled in the history of juridical ideas. Hence, we are dealing not with the product of a broad consensus, but rather with a doctrine emerging from a surprisingly narrow base. Narrow or not, however, it was an enormously influential base, and our present concept of judicial self-restraint would al- most certainly not exist without the main line of theorists from Thayer to Frankfurter. When today's politicians sing the praises of judicial self-restraint, they probably have nothing quite so precise as the classical conception in mind. Yet insofar as what they do have in mind requires federal judges to give legislative majorities the constitutional benefit of the doubt, they are echoing a version of the classical conception. The main purpose of this Article is to explore in detail the contribution of Justice Holmes to the classical tradition of thinking about judicial restraint. There has been a recent explosion of interest in Holmes, who Richard Posner has observed is "increas- ingly regarded to be the greatest figure in the history of American law."9 For Holmes, or so this Article argues, the duty of judicial L.

Holmes's general philosophy intricately enmeshed ideas about the nature of the cos- mos, the foundations of democratic politics, and the virtue and duty of the judge. I will argue that Holmes's was a strange, at- tractive, yet ultimately unacceptable philosophy, and thus that his views about the structural position of the judge in our constitu- tional scheme as well as his conception of judicial virtue are flawed. To the extent that the classical conception of judicial self- restraint relies on Holmes as one of its historical props, it is a weak conception. Before turning to Holmes, however, we must dispose of some preliminary questions about judicial virtue that the classical con- ception raises. The classical conception-"Thayerism," we might also call it--contends that the Supreme Court should uphold legis- lation unless the Justices deem it not merely unconstitutional but clearly unconstitutional. Thayerism, that is, amounts to what Bickel would later term the "rule of the clear mistake."10 It is important to add that the later exponents of judicial self-restraint grafted on additional elements. Wechsler insisted that judges refrain from constitutional judgments that could not be couched in neutral prin- ciples,"1 a requirement that Thayer himself did not propose, and Bickel, following up on a famous opinion of Brandeis,12 advo- cated the "passive virtues": strategic dodging of constitutional issues by means of jurisdictional devices." These modifications should be regarded as friendly amend- ments to the classical conception. For the moment, I characterize judicial self-restraint in classical terms alone in order to highlight the error of regarding it as a personal virtue of judges. A judge Wendell Holmes, Jr., 82 Nw. U.

Deference and judicial self-restraint in the classical conception amount to interpretive strategies, not traits of judicial character; the same is true of Bickel's passive virtues and Wechsler's requirement of neutral principles (a requirement that can be satisfied by judges who are not at all neutral in their stance toward the law or a given case). Nevertheless, even if asking whether judicial self-restraint is a judicial virtue amounts to a category mistake, the important ques- tion remains of what character traits judges must possess in order to practice self-restraint. This is hardly an eccentric question. In- deed, it centrally occupied the theorists and judges who developed the classical conception. Is the virtue the "combination of a lawyer's rigor with a statesman's breadth of view" that Thayer extols in a pregnant and little-understood passage?14 Is it "pru- dence," Bickel's term for the political judgment by which the Court discerns that the country is unready to face a constitutional issue and hence in need of judicial temporizing through the exploi- tation of "the marvelous mystery of time"?"' Is it Holmes's de- tached skepticism, or Brandeis's sympathetic immersion in factual details, or the "judicial humility" of which Frankfurter speaks?6--Frankfurter, who also believed that the correlative vice, the "common denominator" of his activist brethren, was "a self-willed self-righteous power-lust... undisciplined by adequate professional learning and cultivated understanding.""' These are important and fascinating questions. Whatever character traits make classical self-restraint possible count as judicial virtues only if judicial self-restraint is itself a worthwhile aim. The chief temptation to abandon judicial self- restraint arises from a judge's conviction that the legislature has done something bad for the nation and its Constitution; the temp- 14.

According to the classical conception, the judge must abstain from any such heroics; the judicial role outweighs what we may concede to be an imperative of the patriot's conscience. However, self-restraint counts as a virtue only if fidelity to a tightly constrained judicial role is more important than fidelity to the demands of conscience. This observation leads naturally to the question-familiar in the literature of professional ethics--of why the "role morality" of a profession such as judging should out- weigh duties of conscience.'s The most natural answer in the case of the classical concep- tion is that judicial self-restraint is necessary to ensure majority rule. In that case, however, defending the classical conception requires us to justify deference to legislative majorities even when their actions are wrongheaded. What moral claim do foolish ma- jorities exert? The following, then, are two assignments that any argument for the classical conception of judicial self-restraint and its underly- ing virtues must fulfill: to justify strict adherence to a narrowly defined judicial role, and to explain the moral claim of majorities, the strength of which makes the role so narrow. The third assign- ment, as noted earlier, is to connect self-restraint with the traits of judicial character-the virtues-that are required to fulfill it. I believe that each of the principal architects of the classical conception had answers to these questions; their answers, however, were by no means the same. In this Article I focus on Holmes, not only because of his intrinsic interest and historical importance, but also because he offered a fuller and more elaborately con- 18.

This question of why judicial role morality should outweigh duties of conscience emerged forcefully in the discussion among abolitionists about whether sympathetic judges ought to enforce slavery laws. A psychologically sophisticated and historically fascinating study of precisely the conflict between conscience and the judicial role focused on in this Article, in the context of the laws of slavery, is ROBERT M.

First, I argue that the task of defending judicial deference to legislatures is by no means an easy one; almost all the standard arguments (historical as well as con- temporary) beg the very questions at issue. Next, I offer a detailed exposition of Holmes's philosophical and moral views and explore their bearing on the three issues I have just sketched. Finally, I criticize Holmes. Ultimately, I think that none of the patriarchs offered a satisfactory defense of the classical doctrine, but that is a longer story. B. The Puzzle of Self-Restraint The most frequently heard argument on behalf of judicial self- restraint rests on what Bickel called the "counter-majoritarian difficulty":"9 the anomaly, in a democratic system, of unelected judges nullifying acts of the people's elected representatives. Ac- cording to this argument, judicial review is no doubt necessary to safeguard minority rights from the "tyranny of the majority," but beyond the clear protection of minorities, judges must never sec- ond-guess the legislature, on pain of undercutting democracy. This argument appears plausible on the surface, but on closer inspection it quickly begins to unravel. To begin with, the fact that federal judges are unelected is a red herring; the problem of judi- cial review would remain even if federal judges stood for periodic election. After all, state supreme court justices are elected in sev- eral states, and it is hard to believe that these states experience no countermajoritarian difficulty. Indeed, if federal judges were elect- ed, voters would confront the question of whether they ought, as good citizens, to hold judges' disagreeable constitutional decisions against them at the polls. Perhaps we have a civic duty to cast our votes for judges on different criteria than whether the judges work our will; perhaps we should favor judges who are willing to nullify acts of our passing fancy on constitutional grounds. We see, of course, that this issue simply raises the countermajoritarian difficulty all over again. Indeed, the same problem arises whenever a legislator decides to vote against legis- lation that a majority of her constituents supports because she believes it to be unconstitutional. The countermajoritarian difficul- 19. BICKEL, supra note 4, at 16.</page><page sequence="9">1994] JUSTICE HOLMES 457 ty thus has nothing essentially to do with the "anomaly" of a nonmajoritarian judiciary, and indeed nothing essentially to do with the judiciary at all. The difficulty inheres instead in the very nature of constitutionalism itself.2 For constitutions by their very existence constrain the desires of majorities, and pure majoritarian- ism makes constitutions impossible.21 Indeed, nothing prevents us from turning Bickel's rhetoric on its head and observing that majority rule creates a "counterconsti- tutional difficulty." We might reinterpret the U.S. Constitution by noticing how few of its institutions were designed to be purely majoritarian. The President and Vice President are chosen by the electoral college,22 and until the Seventeenth Amendment was en- acted in 1913, the Senate was nonmajoritarian.3 Neither the cabi- net nor executive agencies are majoritarian, and one major victory won by the Federalists over the anti-Federalists-dividing America into federated units of wide rather than narrow geographical scope in order to weaken local control--ensured that American repre- sentative democracy would be removed as far as possible from direct democracy. Judicial review amounts to a buffer against ma- jority rule and fits in readily with the many other buffering devic- es found in the Constitution's structure. Perhaps unchecked major- ity rule, rather than judicial review, ought to be regarded as the anomalous institution, generating a counterconstitutional difficulty. Obviously, this is a rather farfetched constitutional interpreta- tion; I raise it merely to stress an objection to Bickel's way of stating the case that can be put less rhetorically: that in fact the Constitution is compounded of majoritarian and nonmajoritarian elements and provides no hint that any of the institutions it cre- 20. I thank Robin West for stressing this point to me. See the essays collected in CONSTITUTIONALISM AND DEMOCRACY (Jon Elster &amp; Rune Slagstad eds., 1988); see especially Jon Elster, Introduction to CONSTITUTIONALISM AND DEMOCRACY, supra, at 1, and Stephen Holmes, Precommitment and the Paradox of Democracy, in CONSTITUTION- ALISM AND DEMOCRACY, supra, at 195. 21. Thus, efforts in Great Britain to create a written bill of rights based on the American model have raised theoretical objections: even if Parliament enacts such a bill, subsequent acts of Parliament inconsistent with its provisions would merely supersede those provisions rather than be constrained by them. Nothing could prevent this except a "self-sealing" provision voiding future attempts to supersede or repeal the bill-a provi- sion that many theorists believe to be impossible. The problem arises because Parliament is an unconstrained majoritarian institution. 22. U.S. CONST. art. III, ? 1. 23. Id. amend. XVII.</page><page sequence="10">458 DUKE LAW JOURNAL [Vol. 44:449 ates are anomalies. Talk of the "counter-majoritarian difficulty" merely begs the question at issue. Nor do separation of powers considerations affect this conclu- sion. One often hears that Congress, not the courts, holds the power to legislate, and thus that courts should not be in the busi- ness of second-guessing Congress; critics denounce "government by judiciary" and "judicial legislation." But though Congress legis- lates, the executive issues orders and regulations, and the courts make decrees and interpret the laws. All three branches issue imperatives, and it settles nothing to characterize judicial interpre- tations and decrees as "legislation." That is merely an exercise in conclusory labeling. Perhaps the point is rather that in close calls on the constitu- tionality of legislation, separation of powers considerations demand that courts grant the benefit of the doubt to the legislature-the body to which, in Thayer's words, the "primary authority to inter- pret is given"24-rather than to themselves. That was part of Thayer's argument, and it seems quite plausible: The judiciary may well reflect that if they had been regarded by the people as the chief protection against legislative violation of the constitution, they would not have been allowed merely... incidental and postponed control. They would have been let in ... to a revision of the laws before they began to operate.25 Nevertheless, this argument also begs the question. The fact that the courts were granted a more limited power of review than they might have been implies nothing whatever about how they should exercise that limited power. Thayer's argument might equally be turned on its head: the choice of "the people" to limit the reviewing role of courts to cases and controversies suggests that judges should refrain from second-guessing that choice by imposing further limitations on themselves without popular man- date. Moreover, once we grant courts the power of judicial review, incidental and postponed though it may be-and no contemporary proponents of judicial self-restraint have gone on record against Marbury v. Madison--then the fact that legislatures legislate implies nothing about who should defer to whom. Legislatures 24. Thayer, supra note 3, at 136. 25. Id. 26. 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803).</page><page sequence="11">1994] JUSTICE HOLMES 459 legislate; courts interpret and review. These are equally fundamen- tal powers of government, and as the earlier discussion about the tension between constitutionalism and majoritarianism indicated, both powers are essential to the total process of lawmaking under a constitution. This being the case, it makes no more intrinsic sense to require courts to defer to legislatures on constitutional questions than to require legislatures to defer to courts. Indeed, from the point of view of the separation of powers, legislators are constitutional amateurs and judges constitutional professionals. Now it may be that, as Thayer and others have argued, we do well to entrust large tasks to the legislators (amateurs or not) in order to inculcate in them a sense of constitutional responsibility; that argument, however, actually pushes against the grain of the separation of powers. Closely connected with Thayer's argument for deference to legislatures is the commonly heard equation of judicial self-re- straint with fidelity to law: that judges are bound by the com- mands of the legislature and must keep faith with the law by putting aside their own personal scruples. However, no statute commands courts to adopt the rule of the clear mistake, and if such a statute were enacted it should be deemed unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of powers. Thayer's argument for deference rests only on judicial tradition coupled with indirect and unsound inferences from constitutional history. Since Thayerism proposes judicial deference even in the absence of legal mandate, the classical conception of judicial self- restraint has nothing to do with the virtue of fidelity to law. Indeed, since Thayerism requires judges to defer to legislative judgments of constitutionality that they in fact disbelieve, a strict policy of fidelity to law actually seems inconsistent with Thayerism. After all, a judge who wishes to keep strict faith with the Consti- tution will not defer to what she regards as a constitutional error. At this point, perhaps, we may turn from constitutional to more overtly normative considerations, such as Thayer's argument that we should not use the federal courts as a crutch enabling the rest of the country to legislate and agitate in happy oblivion to the Constitution, relying on the courts to pull our constitutional bacon out of the fire and bear the brunt of popular pique.2 Pollsters 27. Paul Brest has revived Thayer's concerns, arguing that overreliance on the courts weakens our constitutional democracy by making us worse citizens. Paul Brest, Constitu-</page><page sequence="12">460 DUKE LA W JOURNAL [Vol. 44:449 surveying the general public periodically rediscover the unhappy fact that most of our fellow citizens cheerfully advocate grotesque violations of our constitutional liberties.28 If the courts rein them- selves in, we will perhaps find ourselves more willing to think constitutionally in our political deliberations. However, the supposition that legislative buck-passing and popular indifference to constitutionally protected liberties are greatly affected by marginal changes in federal court policy-and deference to legislatures in close constitutional cases is surely a marginal issue in this sense-is quite fanciful. More importantly, deference to legislative majorities simply because they are majori- ties, whether or not they have seriously considered the subject on which they have legislated, and indeed whether or not they accu- rately represent the views of their constituents, hardly seems like a policy calculated to instill political responsibility in the majoritarian branch. Finally, proponents of judicial self-restraint may wish to argue that regardless of whether the Constitution is majoritarian, and regardless of the effects of judicial self-restraint on the political branches of government, democracy requires deference to majority rule. Under this argument, to the extent that our Constitution li- censes antimajoritarian institutions, it fails as a democratic charter. In that case, we ought to be better democrats than the Framers and insist on strong majority rule. Like the other arguments we have been considering, however, this one turns on a question-begging non sequitur. Democracy means self-rule; it need not mean majority rule, for at least two reasons. First, representative majority rule is only one possible device for amalgamating the choices of an electorate, and we have no reason to think it is more democratic than plebiscitary democ- racy, or plurality rule, or any of the fancy voting schemes studied by theorists of social choice. More importantly, majority rule may well prove inconsistent with self-rule. Genuine self-rule requires widespread political delib- tional Citizenship, 34 CLEV. ST. L. REv. 175 (1986). 28.

To the extent that the politi- cal system responds to sheer numbers of votes-in Albert Hirsch- man's terms, to voter exit rather than citizen voice29-powerful and perverse incentives are created for politicians to give the elec- torate easy escapes from the tedious process of deliberation. Sound-bite politics and attack ads exemplify this phenomenon. I do not mean to say that majority rule is a bad idea; I mean to say only that democratic arguments do not show that it is a good idea. They beg the question by assuming that self-rule means majority rule. Unless majorities display the virtues of democracy, democrats need entertain no special love for majorities. This is an important point, and one that is easy to misunderstand: precisely such a misunderstanding fueled public criticism of the theories of Professor Lani Guinier, leading to the withdrawal of her nomina- tion as assistant attorney general for civil rights.? Professor Guinier's argument was precisely that genuine representation of interests can better be ensured by voting schemes other than pure majority rule.31 None of the objections I have been rehearsing offers a case against the classical conception of judicial self-restraint, or against majority rule, nor are they intended to. The point is rather to sug- gest that whatever arguments can be made on behalf of the classi- cal conception must cut deeper than appeals to constitutional structure, the separation of powers, fidelity to law, or democratic ideals. At this point I wish to turn to Holmes, who offered what must surely stand as one of the most amazing arguments ever offered on behalf of the classical conception. II.

Dear Thayer I have read your article and I think it admirable. Substantially I agree with it heartily and it makes explicit the point of view from which ,implicitly I have approached Constitutional questions upon which I have differed from some of the other judges. If I were to make any criticism it would only be to ex- press a doubt which you have articulated at the bottom of p. 144-1 am not entirely sure that you do not overvalue your formula as a matter of ultimate analysis. Of the usefulness of insisting upon it at this time and of dispelling the illusion dealt with in the last sentences of the article I have no doubt. It is idle to rely upon Courts "to save a people from ruin"-And I think that an intelli- gent dissent by one of my brethren would make me hesitate long in pronounc- ing an act unconstitutional, because I believe in your formula. There is another principle of state constitutional law not within the scope of your discussion which I always have supposed fundamental but which (be- tween ourselves) I infer from the discussions I have had with my brethren does not command their assent-viz. that a state legislature has the power of Parlia- ment, i.e. absolute power, except so far as expressly or by implication it is pro- hibited by the Constitution-that the question always is where do you find the prohibition-not, where do you find the power-I think the contrary view dan- gerous and wrong. I should send the article to Brother Adams if I were you. He may have some suggestions. Letter from Oliver W. Holmes to James B. Thayer (Nov. 2, 1893) (on file with Harvard Law School Library).

I shall quote rather extensively, to document my case and, more importantly, because Holmes writes too well to paraphrase. A. Holmes as Metaphysician of Value: "I Am in the Universe, Not It in Me" Holmes once wrote to Dr. John C.H. Wu that "philosophy wisely understood is the greatest interest there is."36 Throughout his career, he maintained a profound interest in philosophy, and his outlook was markedly philosophical--to a greater extent, per- haps, than any other major American judge, and to a degree dis- tinctly out of place in political life; as he wrote to John Chipman Gray in 1915, "I am somewhat lonely here in the intimate and ultimate regions of thought . . . ."" Holmes liked to tell his cor- respondents what he had read lately, and the amount of philoso- phy mentioned and discussed in his letters is staggering.38 his frequently belittling references to the significance of the human race.. . his mystical faith in "the cosmos" . . . ; his historical relativism and determin- ism . . . ; his insistence on power, force, and the ability to kill one's enemies as the predominant determinants of the universe . . . ; and, at the same time his exaltation of individual will, particularly toward some unknown goal .... Id. at 82-83. My own impression is that Holmes the metaphysician is by no means famil- iar to lawyers, who know him primarily through his Supreme Court opinions and his advocacy of objective tests of liability in The Common Law. OLIVER W. HOLMES, THE COMMON LAW (Mark D. Howe ed., 1963) [hereinafter HOLMES, THE COMMON LAW]. In any event, even those to whom Holmes's metaphysical views are familiar treat them largely as unargued quasi-religious convictions of primarily psychobiographical significance, rather than paying them the compliment of subjecting Holmes's arguments for them to philosophical analysis-Grey and Hantzis constituting notable exceptions.

Do human values possess any validity whatever? Holmes was profoundly alive to the possibility that the answer to both questions was no; he once remarked, "We are all very near despair.""9 His interest was in spirit and even in details of doctrine and literary timbre very close to Nietzsche's root prob- lem: How, in a godless world filled up with senseless destruction, can one find meaning and avoid sinking into nihilism, "the radical repudiation of value, meaning, and desirability"?4 One of the subthemes in this Article is that Holmes's philosophical views were, with a few instructive divergences, strikingly similar to those of Nietzsche.41 to his correspondents, and one finds him reading Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Plato and Aristotle, Bergson and James, Marx and Hegel, Dewey and Perry. 39.

In this my interpretation is, at least partly, at odds with Grey and Hantzis, both of whom argue that Holmes should be regarded as a pragmatist. See Grey, Pragmatism, supra note 9; Hantzis, supra note 9, at 545. Hantzis finds Holmes's views echoed in Charles S. Peirce, while Grey finds them in John Dewey. See Grey, Pragmatism, supra note 9, at 791; Hantzis, supra note 9, at 551-61. Of course, nothing prevents one from noting that Holmes shared philosophical themes with both Nietzsche and the pragmatists, and indeed Nietzsche himself shared some of the pragmatists' views. See ARTHUR C. DANTO, NIETZSCHE AS PHILOSOPHER 72 (1965) (arguing that Nietzsche held a pragmatic theory of truth). I find Nietzsche a more illuminating analogue because he (unlike the pragmatists) shared with Holmes a debunking attitude toward moralizing and a profound reverence for force; he and Holmes even shared some specific verbal formulations of their views. See, e.g., infra notes 73, 86-87, 93, 96 and accompanying text. Since one is known by the company one keeps, admirers of Holmes may object to my reading on the ground that Nietzsche is worse company than the pragmatists. This is not my view, for I find much to admire, and much to object to, in both. See DAVID LUBAN, LEGAL MOD- ERNISM 125-78 (1994), for a critique of pragmatism. The question of whether Holmes sympathized with pragmatism is a complex one. Grey makes a detailed case for philosophical affinity. He also provides an excellent sur- vey of the historical evidence bearing on the question of intellectual influence, concluding that the record is at best ambiguous. Grey, Pragmatism, supra note 9, at 864-70. Holmes belonged to the Metaphysical Club with Peirce and was a youthful intimate of William James, but in his letters he expressed doubts about both of them.

Burton ed., 1976) [hereinafter HOLMES- SHEEHAN CORRESPONDENCE]. On the other hand, after reading Dewey's Experience and Nature late in life, Holmes wrote that its "view of the universe came home to me closer than any other that I know." Letter from Oliver W. Holmes to Sir Frederick Pollock (July 26, 1930), in 2 HOLMES-POLLOCK LETTERS: THE CORRESPONDENCE OF MR. JUS- TICE HOLMES AND SIR FREDERICK POLLOCK 1874-1932, at 272, 272 (Mark D. Howe ed., 1941) [hereinafter HOLMES-POLLOCK LETTERS]. The late date of Holmes's reading of Dewey precludes, of course, any claim of intellectual influence of the latter on the for- mer, but Grey claims only intellectual affinity, not influence. Yet even here the fit be- tween Holmes and pragmatism is imperfect. In the letter to Sheehan quoted above, Holmes criticized in Bergson what I take to be the single defining theme of pragma- tism-its treatment of intellectual activity as predominantly instrumental rather than con- templative: "[Bergson] is stimulating but generally speaking I don't believe him. . . . [H]e spends a lot of intellect to show that intellect is only a practical tool inside of life and inadequate on speculative themes. I couldn't see that he made out that it was not the best thing we have." Letter from Oliver W. Holmes to Canon Patrick Augustine Sheehan, supra, at 88 (emphasis added). Holmes sounds like an antipragmatist if this passage is compared with Cornel West's observation that pragmatism's "common denominator con- sists of a future-oriented instrumentalism that tries to deploy thought as a weapon of more effective action." CORNEL WEST, THE AMERICAN EVASION OF PHILOSOPHY: A GENEALOGY OF PRAGMATISM 5 (1989). The suggestion that Holmes and Nietzsche inhabit roughly the same philosophical terrain has been made in RICHARD A. POSNER, THE PROBLEMS OF JURISPRUDENCE 239-44 (1990). Posner focuses on Holmes's and Nietzsche's repudiation of subjectivity and the importance of our conscious thoughts; I suggest that the similarity encompasses their basic theory of value as well, and even their preoccupation with combat and bloodshed. Though Nietzsche, a military nurse, never saw combat, both Holmes and Nietzsche found in their wartime experiences a metaphor for the universe at large, and it is no coinci- dence that both men affected military-style moustaches. Indeed, I believe that the closest literary analogue to Holmes's enterprise in The Common Law is the third essay in FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, Toward a Genealogy of Morals, in BASIC WRITINGS OF NIETZ- SCHE 591 (Walter Kaufmann ed. &amp; trans., 1968) [hereafter NIETZSCHE, Toward a Geneal- ogy of Morals], with its effort to expose the roots of our current normative vocabulary in the primitive desire for revenge. 42.

After Coperni- cus we must acknowledge that the universe simply does not give a damn about us: as Holmes put it, "I don't believe in the infinite importance of man-I see no reason to believe that a shudder could go through the sky if the whole ant heap were kerosened."45 Meditation on such ultimate matters was a pro- nounced feature of Holmes's personality, as witnesses his catalogue of what he took to be the basic elements of daily life: "vict- uals-procreation-rest and eternal terror."46 Nietzsche's solution to the problem lies in the affirmation of the very contingency and goallessness of the universe that pro- vokes us to nihilism in the first place. I will argue that this was Holmes's solution as well, though it took a radically different form from Nietzsche's. Moreover, like Nietzsche, Holmes approached the question of meaning with doctrines that mixed Emerson-a great early influence on Holmes as well as on Nietzsche47-and Cohen (Feb. 5, 1919), in Holmes-Cohen Correspondence, supra note 41, at 14-15, reprint- ed in THE ESSENTIAL HOLMES, supra note 9, at 110. 110-11.

One Emersonian strand of Holmes's thinking lay in the insight that our most everyday and banausic business could be viewed from what Holmes liked to call an "infinite perspective"48 and thereby become infused with meaning: Life is a roar of bargain and battle, but in the very heart of it there rises a mystic spiritual tone that gives meaning to the whole. It transmutes the dull details into romance. It reminds us that our only but wholly adequate significance is as parts of the unimaginable whole. It suggests that even while we think that we are egotists we are living to ends outside ourselves.4 Importantly, Holmes found that the profession of law, which he initially regarded as "a thick fog of details-in a black and frozen night, in which were no flowers, no spring, no easy joys,""' was actually a region in which "thought may find its unity in an infi- nite perspective,"5" in which you can "connect your subject with the universe and catch an echo of the infinite, a glimpse of its unfathomable process, a hint of the universal law."52 In Holmes's thinking, as this passage suggests, the role of the Emersonian Oversoul, awareness of which infuses life with mean- 48.

We see this most explicitly in Holmes's wartime diary, recalling his thoughts as he lay dying (he believed) at Ball's Bluff, shot through the chest. First he considered recanting his atheism in a kind of last-second Pascal's wager, but he rejected this course as "a cowardly giving way to fear."5s He continued, "Then came in my Philosophy-I am to take a leap in the dark-but now as ever I believe that whatever shall happen is best-for it is in accordance with a gen- eral law-and good &amp; universal (or general law) are synonymous terms in the universe."" Holmes wrote to Morris Cohen that "I do in a sense worship the inevitable"55ss and to Harold Laski that "I do accept 'a rough equation between isness and oughtness.' "" (One thinks of Nietzsche's formula of transcendence: amor fati! [love fate!]") Even universal scientific laws, however, provide no evidence of an underlying cosmic order; for all we know, wrote Holmes, they too represent nothing more than senseless contingen- cies: "[T]he Universe is a spontaneity taking an irrational pleasure in a moment of rational sequence.""' Nor did he believe that the universe has our interests at heart-far from it, as his remark about kerosening the ant heap makes clear.

[O]f people . . who think that . . . the universe is no longer predatory. Oh bring in a basin."" Thus, Holmes did not solve the problem of meaning by insisting that the cosmos is in the least bit benign. Rather, Holmes-in an inversion of Nietzsche's discovery that meaning is extinguished in an infinite Copernican universe-found repose in the thought that man is not the measure or center of all things, that the universe utterly and finally transcends the human scale, including the scale of human understanding. Relief came from the realization that the world, though savage, is unfathomably grand, that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy: It is enough for us that the universe has produced us and has within it, as less than it, all that we believe and love. If we think of our existence not as that of a little god outside, but as that of a ganglion within, we have the infinite behind us. It gives us our only but our adequate significance.61 And thus inner peace lies in impersonality; as Holmes once de- scribed his happiest labors on the Supreme Court, "Thoughts of self are almost forgotten and it is just a concentrated effort to do one's part as a wheel in a tremendous machine."62 Decades after Ball's Bluff, Holmes would refer to his "secret fountain of faith"; "the belief that I am in the universe, not it in me."63 For Holmes, the source of meaning thus lay-paradoxically enough-in a thought not far removed from a kind of Cartesian 59.

After reading a work on entomol- ogy, Holmes wrote, I think it not improbable that man, like the grub that prepares a chamber for the winged thing it never has seen but is to be--that man may have cosmic destinies that he does not under- stand .... I remembered the faith that I partly have expressed, faith in a universe not measured by our fears, a universe that has thought and more than thought inside of it, and as I gazed, after the sunset and above the electric lights there shone the stars.64 His final sentence recalls Kant's famous confession that two things fill him with wonder: the starry sky above and the moral law with- in." For Holmes, however, the moral law within was a humbug: "[T]he Kantian injunction to regard every human being as an end in himself and not as a means," Holmes argued, is simply a dubi- ous conclusion drawn from the idealist fallacy that "consciousness constructs the universe and as the fundamental fact is entitled to fundamental reverence."' As we will subsequently see, Holmes was skeptical not only of Kant's system of morality, but of mo- rality as such. The Holmesian counterpart of the moral law within is the cosmic destiny that we, like the grub, cannot comprehend. In another speech he described the grub in more detail and added, "The law of the grub ... is the law also for man."67 Under Holmes's view, then, we are redeemed rather than con- demned by our own insignificance, redeemed by attaining to the impersonal realization that sub specie aeternitatis our actions and 64.

It is unsurprising to learn that Holmes read Spinoza for pleasure;6 unlike Spinoza, however, Holmes's rational mysticism was suffused with an ironic appreciation of the discrep- ancy between our conscious aspirations and the destiny the uni- verse may actually hold in store for us. In such a universe, at least when it is viewed from the "infi- nite perspective," one's own personality is an object of little inter- est: "If the universe is all of one piece, as it seems to me to be, personality merely means a particular kind of a knot tied in the tail of the infinite."" In his last years, Holmes commented with distaste on Ruskin's writing about his own childhood, finding it repellent "that he should think his puny personality mattered.7"" This indifference to personality arises as well from Holmes's remarkably Nietzschean philosophical psychology: I believe that we are in the universe, not it in us, that we are part of an unimaginable, which I will call a whole, in order to name it, that our personality is a cosmic ganglion, that just as when certain rays meet and cross there is white light at the meeting point, but the rays go on after the meeting as they did before, so, when certain other streams of energy cross, the meet- ing point can frame a syllogism or wag its tail. I never forget that the cosmos has the power to produce consciousness, intelli- gence, ideals, out of a like course of its energy, but I see no reason to assume that these ultimates for me are cosmic ulti- mates. I frame no predicates about the cosmos. I suspect that all my ultimates have the mark of the finite upon them, but as they are the best I know I give them practical respect, love, etc., but inwardly doubt whether they have any importance except for us and as something that with or without reasons the universe has produced and therefore for the moment has sanctioned. We must be serious in order to get work done, but when the usual Satur- day half holiday comes I see no reason why we should not smile at the trick by which nature keeps us at our job.71 68.

The similarity to Nietzsche may be seen by comparing the letter quoted in the text with two of Nietzsche's best-known passages: And do you know what "the world" is to me? Shall I show it to you in my mirror? This world: a monster of energy . . set in a definite space as a defi- nite force, . . . as force throughout, as a play of forces and waves of forc- es . . . . This world is the will to power-and nothing besides! And you your- selves are also this will to power-and nothing besides! NIETZSCHE, THE WILL TO POWER, supra note 40, I 1067, at 549-50. In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche runs Holmes's argument in reverse direction. Holmes inferred from the known nature of the cosmos as a congeries of energies that "consciousness, intelli- gence, ideals" as well as human beings and dogs are intersections of energies; Nietzsche suggests that once we view ourselves as a congeries of drives (what he calls "will to power"), we must attempt to achieve metaphysical unity by aiming to view the entire cosmos as intersections of will to power. FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, Beyond Good and Evil, in BASIC WRITINGS OF NIETZSCHE, supra note 41, at 179, i 36, at 237-38 [hereinafter NIETZSCHE, Beyond Good and Evil]. Though Nietzschean "will to power" and Holmesian "force" and "energy" may be different concepts-the issue is a complex one-they are surely very similar, and the net result of the arguments is the same: both identify human consciousness with a temporary intersection of cosmic energies that determine our thoughts and responses even though we have the illusion of free will. On this latter point, see id. I 19, at 215-16. The fact that Nietzsche works from the inside out (from "the world viewed from inside," id. 1 36, at 238, to the world as such) while Holmes works from the outside in (from the impersonal world of physics to the deterministic responses of the "ganglion") is quite a significant difference, however. It marks the differ- ence between Nietzsche's idealism and Holmes's realist predilections. On this difference, see infra text accompanying notes 133-34. 72. Holmes discussed the materialist argument that consciousness is epiphenomenal in two letters to Cohen. Letter from Oliver W. Holmes to Morris R. Cohen (July 21, 1920), in Holmes-Cohen Correspondence, supra note 41, at 19; Letter from Oliver W. Holmes to Morris R. Cohen (Sept. 14, 1920), in Holmes-Cohen Correspondence, supra note 41, at 25. The key passage in the first letter reads, I dont [sic] see why anyone should bother over the suggestion that conscious- ness is an epiphenomenon-It is the way the cosmos acts when it gets a certain knot in its guts-and I don't perceive why there is any more right to think away consciousness than there is to think away nerve tissue-the total is the datum. Letter from Oliver W. Holmes to Morris R. Cohen (July 21, 1920), supra, at 19. Else- where Holmes wrote, It does not follow because consciousness appears, even if inevitably, when the mysterious understream joins a certain eddy, that consciousness is a fifth wheel to the coach. What we mean by matter, or force, or the understream, is a thing that does produce consciousness, that is conscious, when it clashes in a certain way.</page><page sequence="25">1994] JUSTICE HOLMES 473 scribed himself as "a nodus that has the illusion of personality and in its freaky moments fancies itself distinguishable from the before and after of the stream of energies that for the moment is able to say: 'I.' "" From this he concludes that our self-justifications--our ascription of reasons for our actions-are indeed epiphenomenal: they are "the trick by which nature keeps us on the job,"74 and when we congratulate ourselves for acting on the basis of reason or principle we simply turn the true order of explanation on its head. "[P]ersonality," he wrote, "is an illusion only to be accepted on weekdays for working purposes.""75 Holmes's argument in these passages is absolutely crucial for understanding his theory of value. Unlike Nietzsche, for whom it was crucial that "there is no 'thing-in-itself,' "76 Holmes was a Letter from Oliver W.

Holmes gave us too little to go on to venture confident assertions about his views on the mind-body problem, but these passages and the previ- ously quoted letter to Wu, Letter from Oliver W. Holmes to Dr. John C.H. Wu (May 5, 1926), supra note 71, at 35-36, suggest that he held a kind of dual aspect theory such as Spinoza's: that consciousness and matter are merely two aspects of a single substance, the energy that composes the universe. See BENEDICT DE SPINOZA, Ethics, in 1 THE COL- LECTED WORKS OF SPINOZA (Edwin Curley ed. &amp; trans., 1985), at 451 ("[T]he thinking substance and the extended substance are one and the same substance."). His implicit suggestion in the above-quoted letter to Einstein, Letter from Oliver W. Holmes to Lewis Einstein (May 10, 1903), supra, that matter, force, and the metaphoric "understream" that produces consciousness may all be aspects of the same Ur-stuff is yet another similarity between Holmes and Nietzsche, since that is the consequence of Nietzsche's assertion that everything is "will to power-and nothing besides."

Notice the striking similarity between these views and Nietzsche's anal- ysis of the ego: [A] thought comes when "it" wishes, and not when "I" wish, so that it is a falsification of the facts of the case to say that the subject "I" is the condition of the predicate "think." It thinks; but that this "it" is precisely the famous old "ego" is, to put it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and assuredly not an "immediate certainty." NIETZSCHE, Beyond Good and Evil, supra note 71, I 17, at 214. The origin of these anti-Cartesian ideas is an aphorism of the 18th-century physicist and writer Georg Cristoph Lichtenberg, known to Nietzsche, but perhaps not to Holmes: "We should say it thinks, just as we say it lightens. To say cogito is already to say too much as soon as we translate it I think. To assume, to postulate the I is a practical requirement." GEORG CRISTOPH LICHTENBERG, APHORISMS 168 (R.J.

Letter from Oliver W. Holmes to Dr. John C.H. Wu (Feb. 25, 1923), in HOLMES-WU CORRESPONDENCE, supra note 36, at 7, 7. Ding an sich ("thing-in-itself") is a technical term from Kant's philosophy. Kant distinguishes between objects of experience and things as they are in themselves, i.e., apart from experience. We know nothing about things-in-themselves, but must nevertheless postulate their existence. Kant argues that the mind creates the conditions of experience, and thus holds to a kind of idealist view of objects of experience. However, he insists that the idealist argument does not apply to things-in-themselves. IMMANUEL KANT, CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON, *Bxxvi-Bxxviii, at 27 (Norman K. Smith trans., 1968). Hegel criticized Kant on these grounds and argued that the thing-in-itself is just as much a creature of mind as is the object of experience, and it is this idealist argument that Holmes is criticizing. See, e.g., GEORG W.F. HEGEL, HEGEL'S LOGIC 72, 180-81 (William Wallace trans., Oxford 1975) (1830). 78. Letter from Oliver W. Holmes to Harold J. Laski (July 21, 1921), supra note 45, at 350-51. Here I am in disagreement with Hantzis, supra note 9, at 592, who claims that Holmes, like Peirce, rejected the thing-in-itself. See also id. at 554-55. These letters also contradict White's claim that Holmes "genuinely doubted the universe had any reali- ty independent of the individual's belief in it . . . ." WHITE, supra note 9, at 479. The latter view typifies the idealist metaphysics that Holmes rejected throughout his adult career. Indeed, as we have seen, Holmes denounced the idealist fallacy that "conscious- ness constructs the universe." HOLMES, Ideals and Doubts, supra note 66, at 304, reprint- ed in THE ESSENTIAL HOLMES, supra note 9, at 117, 117. It may be that what misleads Hantzis and White is Holmes's "bettabilitarianism," his often-repeated claim that our knowledge of the existence of the external world rests on a leap of faith rather than a reasoned demonstration. See, for example, his observa- tion from Ideals and Doubts: "[A]lthough I cannot prove that I am awake, I believe that my neighbors exist in the same sense that I do, and if I admit that, it is easy to admit also that I am in the universe, not it in me." Id. at 304, reprinted in THE ESSENTIAL HOLMES, supra note 9, at 118. Likewise, in a letter to Einstein, Holmes explained, I mean by truth simply what I can't help accepting. Now, as I have taken one jump of faith and decided to bet that I am not god and that the world is not my dream but that you exist in the same sense that I do, the consequence fol- lows as a probability that in some sense, I know not what, I came out of the Universe, whatever it may be, rather than it out of me. If so my limits, my can't helps, come from it and are not necessarily its limits. Therefore I know nothing about absolute truth, but do my job sufficiently when I to the best of my power reduce my world to unity. Letter from Oliver W. Holmes to Lewis Einstein (June 1, 1905), in HOLMES-EINSTEIN LETITERS, supra note 41, at 15, 16. This letter makes it plain that Holmes did not doubt the reality of the external world, but rather our ability to demonstrate that reality. In another letter to Einstein, Holmes defined the "bettabilitarian" as "one who treats the Universe simply as bettable." Letter from Oliver W.

For a critique of</page><page sequence="27">1994] JUSTICE HOLMES 475 For Holmes, the universe, not humankind, is the ultimate yardstick, and the fact that the universe is indifferent to what we hold dear signifies that value judgments are "arbitrary"--or so he argues in Natural Law: "Men to a great extent believe what they want to--although I see in that no basis for a philosophy that tells us what we should want to want.""79 To put the argument a bit too quickly, because Holmes was a metaphysical realist, he be- lieved that values are either part of the objective order of things or else they are arbitrary. But values are not part of the order of things; hence they are arbitrary. In this sense, at any rate, Holmes qualifies as a moral nihilist; indeed, he advanced the moral nihilist's typical reduction of value judgments to tastes and naked preferences: "[O]ne's own moral and aesthetic preferences," he wrote, are "more or less arbitrary, although none the less dogmatic on that account. Do you like sugar in your coffee or don't you?"' He added perceptively, "You admit the possibility of dif- ference and yet are categorical in your own way, and even instinc- tively condemn those who do not agree."s81 Holmes often delivered himself of nihilistic opinions--opin- ions, that is, about the intrinsic impossibility of reasoning validly to moral judgments rather than merely fighting over them--couched in strong language: "I understand by human rights what a given crowd will fight for (successfully) .... [W]hen men differ in taste as to the kind of world they want the only thing to do is to go to work killing."82 "I used to say, when I was young, that truth was the majority vote of that nation that could lick all others."83 "Deep-seated preferences can not be argued about . . . and there- fore, when differences are sufficiently far reaching, we try to kill the other man rather than let him have his way."84 "I don't see bettabilitarianism, see LUBAN, supra note 41, at 171-73. 79.

[reason] stands any differently from my preference of champagne to ditch water."" Holmes took such views to be a consequence of the superior man's clearheadedness, as a striking letter to Einstein demon- strates: [M]orals are imperfect social generalizations expressed in terms of feeling, and ... to make the generalization perfect we must wash out the emotion and get a cold head. The retail dealers in thought will do the emotionalizing of whatever happens to be ac- cepted doctrine of the day. Nous autres [We others] will permit them that. In fact, if we have got to hate anything, I don't see why we mightn't as well invert the Christian saying and hate the sinner but not the sin. Hate being a personal emotion naturally falls on the obstacles to our making the kind of world we like. It imports no judgment. Disgust is ultimate and therefore as irratio- nal as reason itself--a dogmatic datum. The world has produced the rattlesnake as well as me; but I kill it if I get a chance, as also mosquitos, cockroaches, murderers, and flies. My only judg- ment is that they are incongruous with the world I want; the kind of world we all try to make according to our power." Our concept of "the kind of world we like" is a brute and unargu- able fact, about which it is pointless to become sentimental (a point that nous autres, but not "retail dealers in thought," realize, though "we others" permit them their error). In a striking para- dox, Holmes argued that to approach moral questions with "a cold head" is to recognize that they are basically emotional, whereas those who believe they can defend moral judgments through rea- son are guilty of "emotionalizing ... whatever happens to be accepted doctrine of the day."87 85.

This is one of Holmes's most Nietzschean passages: in its self-aggrandizing dis- tinction between "nous autres" and the "retail dealers in thought," its demand for cold- ness, its paradoxical inversion of a Christian evaluation, and its distinction between an emotionalized false morality and an aesthetically based morality of "disgust" that leads one to kill without resentment, it not only sounds Nietzschean themes but couches them in characteristic Nietzschean rhetoric.</page><page sequence="29">1994] JUSTICE HOLMES 477 B. Holmes's Concept of Ideals: "The Power to Deny the Actual and Perish" The moral psychology of the "cosmic ganglion"' is wholly deterministic: "truth," including the "dogmatic datum"'9 of moral truth, is "simply what I can't help accepting."" We may, as a matter of individual, natural, or evolutionary happenstance, be so constituted that we necessarily hold certain beliefs as to the intrin- sic worth of many things. Those beliefs that we hold, and perhaps must hold, most dear Holmes calls "ideals," and it is ideals that we live for and-more importantly, as we shall see-kill and die for. Yet Holmes consistently maintained that ideals are fictions, though they may be necessary fictions. "If a man ... has the soul of an idealist, he will make-I do not say find-his world ideal."91 The fact that we cannot help creating ideals is "the trick by which nature keeps us at our job."92 Here, too, Holmes's view is very close to Nietzsche's: Holmes's characterization of our conscious beliefs as the trick by which nature keeps us at our job is uncan- nily similar to Nietzsche's description of truth as "the kind of error without which a certain species of life could not live.""9 Our ide- als, like our personalities, our consciousness, and our intelligence, are byproducts of our active life. They do not arise because they point toward objectively valuable ends; on the contrary, ends are valuable only because they are the objects of ideals.

Clearly, this anthropomorphic way of speaking about nature is simply short- hand for a nonteleological evolutionary argument: that human creatures possessing ideals are adaptively superior to human creatures who lack such ideals, i.e., are more likely to reproduce their kind (perhaps because without such ideals human beings sink into a kind of despondency that psychosomatically weakens them, or that makes them less attractive mates, or whatever). 93.

In a speech, Holmes likewise praised "idealists" with these words: "[I]t is a joy to some of us to see embodied ... man's most pecu- liar power-the power to deny the actual and to perish."" These last remarks highlight one additional point about Holmes's notion of ideals that is worth noting for its exceptional strangeness. Holmes believed that ideals are worthy only to the extent that they are "nonsensical and sublime," that is, unattain- able. In his Soldier's Faith address he heaped scorn on social re- formers whose aim is merely to make life less painful and more materially comfortable for the mass of people, calling on his listen- ers to pursue more heroic, albeit more dangerous and inhospitable, ends: "But who of us could endure a world, although cut up into five-acre lots and having no man upon it who was not well fed and well housed, ... without ideals the essence of which is that they never can be achieved?""

Holmes's polemic in this speech against human comfort and the social reformers who have it as their aim, and the contrast he drew between comfort and the "soldier's faith" in violence and danger-and one should read the entire opening passage from which I have taken this extract-is cut from precisely the same cloth as the prologue to Nietzsche's Zarathustra: I say unto you: one must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star .... Alas, the time is coming when man will no longer give birth to a star. . . . Behold, I show you the last man. "What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?" thus asks the last man, and he blinks. The earth has become small, and on it hops the last man, who makes everything small. . . .

NIETZSCHE, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, supra note 58, at 129-30. Compare as well Holmes's views with two Nietzschean aphorisms from Beyond Good and Evil: "Whoever reaches his ideal transcends it eo ipso," NIETZSCHE, Beyond Good and Evil, supra note 71, I 73, at 270; "What? A great man? I always see only the actor of his own ideal," id. 1 97, at 273.</page><page sequence="31">1994] JUSTICE HOLMES 479 read Holmes's assertion "that a man may live greatly in the law as well as elsewhere; that there as well as elsewhere... [he] may wear his heart out after the unattainable."" It is hard to know why Holmes held to this romantic and self- undermining conception of human ideals. Perhaps he feared that only if we pursue a goal that recedes as swiftly as we advance can nature work its trick of keeping us on the job; the chase is over once the donkey captures the carrot." Or perhaps he thought that only ideals "out-reaching the flaming bounds of the possi- ble"" are able to maintain the discrepancy between us and the transcendent grandeur of the universe, in which he found the solu- tion to the problem of meaning. In any event, it proves to be an important point-a ruling delusion-in Holmes's theory of value that victory is to be won only through the passionate pursuit of self-defeat. 1. Vitalism and Ideals: "The Joy of Life Is Living; The Measure of Powers Is Obstacles Overcome." Why would the pursuit of fictive, unattainable, and intrinsically worthless ideals itself be a source of value? Holmes, I believe, here incorporated another Emersonian idea that proved crucial to Nietzsche as well: the idea that the infusion of "vital force" can transfigure us and lift us out of the etiolated half-experience of daily life.1' Nietzsche spoke of the "will to power" and emphasized that central to the human will is "the affect of the command."101 He added that freedom of the will is really "the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition, who 97.

For Emerson, Nietzsche, and Holmes, the feeling of vital force, "the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition," is the bridge by which we affirm the universe. Affirmation, vitality, and joy as such amount to the overcoming of nihilism. Holmes expressed this vitalist view most eloquently in his Memorial Day address: Our dead brothers still live for us, and bid us think of life, not death---of life to which in their youth they lent the passion and glory of the spring. As I listen, the great chorus of life and joy begins again, and amid the awful orchestra of seen and unseen powers and destinies of good and evil our trumpets sound once more a note of daring, hope, and will.'03 More succinctly, he said, "Life is an end in itself, and the only question as to whether it is worth living is whether you have enough of it.""' Holmes embraced the Nietzschean thought that affirmation lies in the "affect of the command"" in two very similar passag- es: "[T]he joy of life is living, is to put out all one's powers as far as they will go; . . . the measure of power is obstacles over- come . . . ."06 and "That is the universal romance of man-to face obstacles and to measure his force by the number that he overcomes."'07 If the joy of life is to put out all our powers as far as they will go, then we will not have attained joy until we 102.

The thought here seems very close to Nietzsche's famous maxim "What does not destroy me, makes me stronger,"'"' a maxim that implies that I have not perfected my strength until I overreach my limit and "die trying." At this point it becomes clearer why, for Holmes, only the pursuit of unattain- able ideals is the source of value. To settle for attainable ends is to sell oneself short. 2. Why Holmes Was No Progenitor of Modern Economics: "The Importance of the Uneconomic to Man." To grasp the dis- tinctiveness of Holmes's theory of value, it is crucial to read the moral skepticism of his description of "moral preferences" as "more or less arbitrary" in tandem with his vitalist doctrine of ideals. Otherwise we are likely to view Holmes as a progenitor of modem economists' methodological reduction of values to "mere" or "naked" preferences. The latter point is baldly put in Robert Bork's well-known "Equal Gratification Clause," which teaches that [t]here is no principled way to decide that ... one form of grati- fication is more worthy than another. Why is sexual gratification more worthy than moral gratification? Why is sexual gratification nobler than economic gratification? There is no way of deciding these matters other than by reference to some system of moral or ethical values that has no objective or intrinsic validity of its own and about which men can and do differ.c9" This sounds a lot like Holmes."' But Bork adds in a footnote that "[t]he impossibility is related to that of making interpersonal comparisons of utilities," referring the reader to two economics 108.

Bork's Holmesian affinities may be gathered from the fact that he adopted as his personal credo the Holmesian aphorism "Wreak yourself upon the world." See Al Kamen &amp; Dale Russakoff, Decision Consistent with Creed; Judge Bork's Motto Is "Wreak Your- self upon the World," WASH. POST, Oct. 10, 1987, at Al. The Holmes quote is "I say . . . that a man may live greatly in the law as well as elsewhere; ... that there as well as elsewhere he may wreak himself upon life, may drink the bitter cup of heroism, may wear his heart out after the unattainable."

And this points to an argument utterly at odds with Holmes's. Bork's argument presupposes that states of affairs are valuable to us because they gratify us, that is, because they increase our utility level. It is a noncognitivist argument, since it implicitly re- jects the alternative view that reason can demonstrate the value of certain states of affairs; to this extent, at any rate, Holmes would tender his qualified agreement."2 But the argument itself is the reverse of Holmes's, and it is important to realize this. Economists assume, at least for heuristic purposes, that we undertake action as a means to an end, that end being the attainment of what is valu- able to us, and what is valuable to us being whatever gratifies us or enhances our utility. From Holmes's point of view, however, this involves two mis- takes. First, he argued repeatedly that the pursuit of value is not the ground of action."3 Rather, value judgments emerge as post hoc rationalizations for action that in the deepest sense is under- taken for its own sake. That we value ends is a byproduct of will- ing them so strongly, that is, of acting so energetically to attain them (thereby creating the inner sensations we associate with willing). To be sure, contemporary economists no longer treat utility as a psychological reality; instead, they define utility behaviorally, in terms of revealed preferences, and this treatment sounds superfi- cially like Holmes's own. Nevertheless, even in revealed preference theory, "utility" functions as an independent variable explaining 111. Bork, supra note 7, at 10 n.20 (citing LIONEL C. ROBBINS, THE NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF ECONOMIC SCIENCE (2d ed. 1969) and PAUL A. SAMUELSON, FOUNDA- TIONS OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS (1965)). 112. His agreement would be qualified by what we might call his noncognitivist view of cognition-his view that reason itself can lay no claim to nonrelative validity. "Disgust is ultimate and therefore as irrational as reason itself-a dogmatic datum." Letter from Oliver W. Holmes to Lewis Einstein (May 21, 1914), supra note 86, at 93, reprinted in THE ESSENTIAL HOLMES, supra note 9, at 114.

Thus, Holmes would concede that we can often advance reasons for our ideals and values but insist that those reasons are themselves merely expressions of natural necessity. In this sense, Holmes's theory of ethics and value is neither more nor less emotive, and thus neither more nor less cogni- tive, than his theory of empirical knowledge. 113.

A more basic mistake, from Holmes's point of view, is the economist's reduction of value to utility, when the latter is under- stood as the gratification derived from material consumption. Holmes admitted the importance of consumption goods, but insist- ed that we attribute the highest value to pursuits whose attainment would add nothing to our utility.114 His is a value theory based not on consumer satisfaction but on existential commitment or even romantic longing: I... mean to insist on the importance of the uneconomic to man as he actually feels to-day. . ... [T]he ideals which burn in the center of our hearts ... hold their own against hunger and thirst; they scorn to be classed as mere indirect supports of our bodily needs, which rather they defy; and our friends the econo- mists would do well to take account of them . .. if they are to deal with man as he is.115 Holmes's distance from doctrines of gratification, and his hostility to utilitarian moral thought, should come as no surprise. After all, it is with undisguised contempt for Benthamite thinking that he observes in The Soldier's Faith, Meantime we have learned the doctrine that evil means pain, and the revolt against pain in all its forms has grown more and more marked. From societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals up to socialism, we express in numberless ways the notion that suffering is a wrong which can be and ought to be prevented, and a whole literature of sympathy has sprung into being which points out in story and in verse how hard it is to be wounded in the battle of life, how terrible, how unjust it is that any one should fail. ... For my own part, I believe that the struggle for life is the order of the world, at which it is vain to repine."6 114.

The Place of Duty in Holmes's Theory of Value: "The Rule of Joy and the Law of Duty Seem to Me All One" Let me recapitulate my argument so far. Holmes's theory of value is expressed in its most compressed form in a passage I have already excerpted, his famous encomium to the law: I say... that a man may live greatly in the law as well as else- where; that there as well as elsewhere his thought may find its unity in an infinite perspective; that there as well as elsewhere he may wreak himself upon life, may drink the bitter cup of hero- ism, may wear his heart out after the unattainable."' The elements Holmes enumerated here are, I believe, the main components of his theory of value: first, the mystical transfigura- tion of life when thought finds its unity in an infinite perspective, that is, comes to contemplate the transcendent universe and the universal laws governing its goings-on; second, the formulation of impossible-to-achieve ideals, so that the heart can wear itself out after the unattainable; third, the sheer exuberance of vitality as man wreaks himself on the world. My argument so far has been that these elements are not simply a list of noble words assembled for rhetorical purposes, but rather the pieces of a philosophical argument. Holmes lists a fourth element as well, namely, drinking the bitter cup of heroism. The reference to heroism ties the theory of value implicit in the other elements to a view of the ethical life, a conception of duty. It is against the philosophical background I have been sketching that Holmes's view of virtue, and specifically the virtue of doing one's duty, takes shape. He expressed the point in the most extreme way in his Soldier's Faith address: 117. See also Holmes's critique of "the greatest good of the greatest number" in Oliver W. Holmes, The Gas-Stokers' Strike, 7 AM. L. REV. 582, 584 (1873) [hereinafter Holmes, The Gas-Stokers' Strike], reprinted in THE ESSENTIAL HOLMES, supra note 9, at 120, 122. These are controversial points in the interpretation of Holmes. Since it is inci- dental to my main argument, I expand on Holmes's relationship with utilitarianism in the Appendix to this Article. 118.

But in the midst of doubt, in the collapse of creeds, there is one thing I do not doubt, that no man who lives in the same world with most of us can doubt, and that is that the faith is true and adorable which leads a soldier to throw away his life in obedience to a blindly accepted duty, in a cause which he little understands, in a plan of campaign of which he has no notion, under tactics of which he does not see the use.119 It is a mistake to believe that Holmes intended to limit this con- ception of duty to soldiers and soldiering, for the entire argument of this speech is that the soldier's faith is the sole viable faith for us all. Moreover, in his essay on natural law, he explicitly equated his general article of faith "[t]hat the universe has in it more than we understand""12 with the "soldier's faith" proposition "that the private soldiers have not been told the plan of campaign, or even that there is one":121 the two are interchangeable. Nor, I think, do I overread the tone of this speech if I suggest that Holmes found the soldier's faith all the more admirable because the soldier is ignorant of why he throws away his life. The hapless and duped draftee has in an important sense fought a better campaign and died a more meaningful death than the thoughtful citizen who enlists with open eyes and believes in the cause for which he lays down his life; Holmes insisted that the soldier's virtue is being "able to face annihilation for a blind belief."122 The soldier's faith of Holmes amounts almost to the proposition that a death is more meaningful the more meaningless it appears. This paradoxical and even frightening conception of duty makes sense only as a corollary of Holmes's general response to the Nietzschean problem of meaning. To Holmes as well as to Nietzsche, we overcome nihilism and despair by joyfully affirming the greatness of the universe. Unlike Nietzsche, for Holmes this meant acknowledging or even reveling in the magnitude of dis- crepancy between what we know of the universe and what it actu- 119.

To affirm the greatness of the universe is thus to affirm at the same time our own smallness and finitude, and this we do by unswerving commitment to a calling that is in every ultimate sense arbitrary. "The rule of joy and the law of duty seem to me all one":"23 thus we must insist on wreaking ourselves on life while at the same time insisting that we know nothing whatever of the point of our doing so. Indeed, we must continue to wreak our- selves on life even in the face of our ironic appreciation that our ideals are unattainable and our actions are senselessly self-defeat- ing, suicidal, and bitterly cruel to others. Ours not to reason why, ours but to do or die. For Kant, the deontological commitment to duty arises as a consequence of "the moral law within";124 Holmes-for whom ideals were likewise "categorical impera- tives"2--tumed deontology into a desperate expedient against despair, by insisting on our duty in the face of full knowledge that there is no moral law to be found. This is the central paradox in Holmes's conception of duty. Our salvation is to be sought in our own insignificance, in the attainment of maximum impersonality, and this in turn implies Holmes's conception of duty as thorough self-abnegation or even self-obliteration. In the end, Holmes's world outlook and ethic was to combine ruthless effectiveness with a detached lack of malice toward one's victims and an ironic philosophical appreciation of the pointlessness of one's vocation. He implicitly asserted that life affords us no better mix than the combination of arbitrarily fo- cused narrowness and maximum intensity. Holmes once proposed the following as an epitaph for himself: "Here lies the supple tool of power."126 Here Holmes contrasts sharply with Nietzsche. Nietzsche was convinced that we affirm the universe not by narrowing and sharp- ening our focus but by all-inclusiveness; he extols the "most com- prehensive soul . . . in which all things have their sweep and 123.

Because Holmes was firmly committed to the existence of a mind-independent reality, he embraced the skepticism that derives from the insight that reality might be very different from our conceptualization of it. In the face of a vast and incomprehensible universe, human beings must find value by the moral and psycho- logical trick of glorying in their own smallness; hence the combina- tion of narrow focus and maximum intensity. Nietzsche, on the other hand, dismissed the thing-in-itself and fell into idealist hallu- cinations: the cosmos is an Ariadne's web of perspectives; value lies in affirming the cosmos, but that requires adopting and affirm- ing the maximum number of perspectives; when a philosopher has solved the riddle of existence, by coming to understand that the universe recurs eternally, he understands that to affirm the future is to affirm the past; consequently, he loses all resentment and embraces all perspectives; he becomes a god who, at bottom, is all names in history; he dies in an asylum."3 Importantly, Holmes's vision of the Apollinian alternative in- cluded abnegation of the prospect of furthering one's own moral beliefs when doing so conflicts with duty. As he wrote to Wu, "I thought the true view [of 'the necessary foundation for a noble life'] was that of my imaginary society of the jobbists, who were free to be egotists or altruists on the usual Saturday half holiday provided they were neither while on their job."'35 A "jobbist" conducts his workaday business without moralizing about its duties. 134. I am not suggesting that Nietzsche's insanity was caused by his philosophy rather than his syphilis. I am suggesting that whatever the physiological cause of his madness, his philosophy provided the content of his delusional system. In one sense, my interpretation of Holmes's metaphysics of morals can be summa- rized in the form of two pseudoequations: Holmes = Nietzsche + the thing-in-itself Holmes = Kant - the moral law within That is, Holmes's metaphysical views-his determinism, his vitalism, his theory of truth, his confrontation with nihilism, his insistence on a universe of blood and conflict-were very close to Nietzsche's, differing primarily in that Holmes insisted on the reality of the world as it is in itself; hence the first equation. Similarly, Holmes's insistence on the cen- trality of duty undertaken for its own sake was very close to Kant's, differing primarily in that Holmes denied the reality of "the moral law within" that Kant regarded as a fundamental fact of reason. 135.

HOLMES'S PHILOSOPHY OF JUDGING A. The Duty of the Judge: "If My Fellow Citizens Want to Go to Hell I Will Help Them" At this point I am able to state the first of my theses about Holmes's philosophy of judging, which will answer the question of why a judge must adhere tightly to the constraints of the role. It is that for Holmes, the virtue underlying judicial self-restraint was precisely the virtue of the soldier: to govern one's conduct "in obedience to a blindly accepted duty, in a cause which he little understands, in a plan of campaign of which he has no notion, under tactics of which he does not see the use."" Holmes admit- ted that he "rarely could be sure" that one legal rule "tends more distinctly than its opposite to the survival and welfare of the soci- ety where it is practiced," a view that he also characterized as "my doubt as to the absolute worth of a large part of the system we administer, or of any other system.""'37 Such doubt places him in the position of the soldier whose faith he celebrated, and from that position he gloried in his self-abnegation. Earlier I suggested that the main temptation pulling against judicial self-restraint arises when a judge sees, or believes she sees, folly and damage to the community resulting from the actions of a legislature."3 In such a case, the judge's sense of responsibility tempts her to rectify the error. Remarkably, however, for Holmes, "[A] sense of responsibility is a confession of weakness. If I put all my powers into deciding the case and writing my decision, I nei- ther feel responsibility nor egotism, nor yet altruism-I am just all in the problem and doing my best.""' One follows the sovereign legislature's directives and lets the chips fall where they may. One 136.

This Holmes conceived to be his duty. As he wrote to Laski concerning the Sherman Act, I hope and believe that I am not influenced by my opinion that it is a foolish law. I have little doubt that the country likes it and I always say, as you know, that if my fellow citizens want to go to Hell I will help them. It's my job.141 B. The Claim of Majorities: "The Ultima Ratio Is Force" This amazing remark turns us to the second question that a theory of judicial self-restraint must answer. Even granting Holmes's argument about why judicial virtue requires a judge to honor duty over the demands of conscience, we must still deter- mine the contours of judicial duty. Judicial self-restraint asks judg- es to defer to majoritarian institutions--but why? What, exactly, accounts for the claim of majorities? As we saw above in Section I(B), this is by no means an easy question to answer. The question assumes a special urgency in the case of Holmes, for he rejected a variety of easy answers that present themselves. A judge so ready to speed his fellow citizens on their self-appointed path to Hell cannot believe that deference to major- ities is in itself for the good of the country. Nor did Holmes be- lieve, as Brandeis did, the weaker thesis that social experimenta- tion, even with its inevitable failures, is good for the country (be- cause the benefits outweigh the risks). He wrote to Brandeis, 140. In a letter to his parents, Holmes recollected a Civil War incident involving his friend Abbott in fighting at Fredericksburg: Macy says quietly "Mr Abbott you will take your first platoon forward" to wh. A. "1st Platoon forward-March" and walks quietly ahead-His 1st Platoon is knocked to pieces (He lost that day 30 out of 60--10 shot dead) instant- ly-"You'll have to put in the 2nd" says Col. H. "2nd Platoon forward" and A. leads them too into the storm with the same semi indifferent air that he has when drilling a Batt". Letter from Oliver W.

Abbott was a "Copperhead"-a Northerner who accepted the Confederacy's right to secede-and Holmes was profoundly impressed by the courage of one so willing to die obeying a foolish order while fighting for a cause with which he disagreed. 141.

Why not the greatest good of the most intelligent and most highly developed?"143 Pre- sumably he would raise the same questions in relation to majority rule. No less an authority than Felix Frankfurter attributed Holmes's deference to majorities to "humility in passing judgment on the experience and beliefs expressed by those entrusted with the duty of legislating," so that Holmes "reached the democratic result by the philosophic route of scepticism."'144 It is true that Holmes once wrote Sir Frederick Pollock, "I am so skeptical as to our knowledge about the goodness or badness of laws that I have no practical criticism except what the crowd wants."145 Yet as Rogat rightly observes, Holmes held to his social and economic views with no trace of either humility or skepticism.46 As we have seen, Holmes's humility and skepticism emerged only on a philosophical plane: from the point of view of the universe "[I can't be sure] that my can't helps which I call . . . truth are cosmic can't helps,"147 but they are "can't helps" nonetheless, and Holmes did not doubt them for a moment on the plane of merely human disputation. The very next sentence of his letter to Pollock provides the dry antistrophe to his skepticism: "Personally I bet that the crowd if it knew more wouldn't want what it does-but 142.

Nor did Holmes hold to the popular argument, based on con- siderations of institutional competence, that courts lack legislatures' factfinding capabilities. Holmes saw the matter the other way around: rather than founding the duty of deference on courts' sup- posed ignorance of the facts, Holmes made it almost a point of pride to ignore facts-a point of pride because in his view it was the judge's duty. In the first opinion in which he articulated a theory of judicial self-restraint-his dissent in Commonwealth v. Perrya49-Holmes suggested a possible motivation behind the legislature's enactment of a statute that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts was voiding and then commented: "If their view was true, I cannot doubt that the Legislature had the right... , and I cannot pronounce the legislation void, as based on a false assumption, since I know nothing about the matter one way or the other."'5 The evident sarcasm of this remark pre- vents us from reading it at face value; clearly, Holmes was not saying that a judge inevitably knows nothing about a matter one way or another. Rather, he was stressing that a judge's duty pre- vents him from relying on his own factual knowledge. Brandeis disagreed with Holmes on this point: Brandeis's Su- preme Court opinions often presented lengthy factual analyses of the economic and social realities underlying legislation'51 As he wrote, the reasonableness of state regulations "can ordinarily be determined only by a consideration of the contemporary condi- tions, social, industrial and political, of the community to be affect- ed thereby.

That, at any rate, is the orthodox Thayerist doctrine of judicial self-restraint. However, Thayer's argument in fact implies just the opposite. For precisely if courts attribute "virtue, sense, and competent knowledge" to the legisla- ture, then they should hold the legislature to a higher, not a loos- er, standard of reasonableness. It may be perfectly reasonable for an ignorant person to do something that would be preposterous for one adequately apprised of the facts. What is reasonable for a dunce may be unreasonable for a genius. It follows that judges must undertake an independent investigation of the factual back- ground of legislation, for only then are they in a position to ask whether it is reasonable from the standpoint of a competently informed legislature. Under this interpretation, Thayer's argument for the rule of the clear mistake is fully consistent with an activist conception of judicial review. Though Brandeis never articulated it in these terms, the latter, unorthodox reading of Thayer's argument seems to underlie Brandeis's procedure, which consists of independently marshalling the available factual evidence and then demonstrating that on the basis of these facts, a legislature's actions are not unreasonable. The former, orthodox reading of the argument underlies Holmes's principled avoidance of independent factual inquiry. However, Holmes's orthodox Thayerism calls for explanation, because it is arguably inconsistent with the centerpiece of Holmes's common law jurisprudence, the "reasonable man" test. Invariably, Holmes insisted that the law impute to each of us the knowledge and rationality of a reasonable man and then hold us to the standards appropriate to someone with that measure of knowledge and ratio- nality.'58 The reasonable man test implicitly contemplates a judge or jury that independently ascertains the knowledge a reasonable 157.

Pierce, 138 Mass. 165 (1884).</page><page sequence="47">1994] JUSTICE HOLMES 495 man would have, and then holds litigants to a standard of conduct appropriate to such knowledge. Translated into the context of con- stitutional review of legislation, a Holmesian "reasonable legisla- ture" test amounts to Brandeis's unorthodox Thayerism, not to Holmes's Thayerist orthodoxy. A judge would have to indepen- dently ascertain the knowledge a reasonable legislature would have, and measure the legislation under review against that stan- dard. Perhaps there is no inconsistency. Holmes espoused reasonable man tests only for common law cases involving ordinary litigants. The legislature, however, is no ordinary litigant. It possesses "the power of Parliament, i.e. absolute power";159 consequently, judges must presume not merely that legislatures know the facts, but also that they have thoughtfully and properly taken them into account. Thayer no doubt intended this latter presumption, though as an argument for judicial restraint it completely begs the question. Holmes evidently reasoned that judges are estopped from indepen- dent factfinding, and thus that they must not presume to judge the reasonableness of legislative actions unless the actions are irratio- nal regardless of the facts. Whether we agree with Holmes or with Brandeis, however, it is to Holmes's credit that he did not rely on the institutional com- petence argument that judges cannot find facts as well as legisla- tures can, for this argument is mistaken. Trial courts possess the power of subpoena and appellate courts may invite knowledgeable parties to submit amicus briefs; courts operate under less stringent time constraints than state legislatures; and courts work relatively free from the political pressures that inevitably lead legislatures to exclude controversial or powerless parties from presenting public testimony. Thus, in practice, judges possess at least as much factfinding ability as legislatures. Nor did Holmes rest the policy of deference on the separation of powers (a good thing, for as I argued earlier, this would only beg the question"). It is noteworthy that in Holmes's introduc- tion to a reissue of Montesquieu's Esprit des Lois, he made only one brief reference to the separation of powers, and that a dismissive remark that Montesquieu's "England of the threefold 159.

The significance of majorities in Holmes's eyes is that they consti- tute the dominant force in the community, and Holmes attributed normative power to the dominant force as such, for reasons about which I will speculate. He stated his argument explicitly-though very quickly-in two short essays. In each, he appeared to offer an independent argument for deferring to dominant forces; the ap- pearance does not survive a closer reading, however, and I am prepared to conclude that Holmes attributed no significance to majorities-dominant forces-beyond dominance itself. One argu- ment appears in his essay on Montesquieu: [T]he most perfect government is that which attains its ends with the least cost, so that the one which leads men in the way most according to their inclination is best. . ... What proximate test of excellence can be found except correspondence to the actual equilibrium of force in the community-that is, conformity to the wishes of the dominant power? Of course, such conformity may lead to destruction, and it is desirable that the dominant power should be wise. But wise or not, the proximate test of a good government is that the dominant power has its way."63 161. OLIVER W. HOLMES, Montesquieu, in COLLECTED LEGAL PAPERS, supra note 39, at 250, 263 [hereinafter HOLMES, Montesquieu]. 162. Letter from Oliver W. Holmes to James B. Thayer (Nov. 2, 1893), supra note 34. 163. HOLMES, Montesquieu, supra note 161, at 257-58. Holmes here is praising Mon- tesquieu's Persian Letters; the passage under discussion appears in Letter 80: I have often asked myself what kind of government most conformed to reason. It has seemed to me that the most perfect is that which attains its goal with the least friction; thus that government is most perfect which leads men along paths most agreeable to their interests and inclinations. MONTESQUIEU, PERSIAN LETTERS 136 (George R. Healy trans., 1964). But the subse- quent analysis of this passage is pure Holmes: Montesquieu offers this proposition as the premise of an argument on behalf of mild government and moderate punishments, not on</page><page sequence="49">1994] JUSTICE HOLMES 497 (Holmes's conclusion echoes his dictum from The Common Law that "[t]he first requirement of a sound body of law is, that it should correspond with the actual feelings and demands of the community, whether right or wrong."'64) This argument possesses a deceptive simplicity. Consider the first sentence. It begins with the seeming truism that the most per- fect government attains its ends with the least cost, a proposition that we are inclined to accept without protest because it seems to advocate nothing more than the efficient pursuit of given ends (and who would prefer the inefficient pursuit of given ends?). But Holmes infers from this a proposition about what ends government ought to adopt, namely those that can be pursued with least cost, because they encounter the least opposition. This makes the argu- ment into a non sequitur unless we read "the most perfect govern- ment is that which attains its ends with the least cost" not as the proposition that government ought to choose the handiest means to given ends, but rather as the proposition that government ought to choose ends that correspond with the handiest available means. But then it is no longer a truism that the most perfect govern- ment attains its ends with the least cost. Read as a constraint on the ends, rather than on the means, that government can rightfully adopt, Holmes's least-cost rule insists that ends be chosen to mini- mize possible opposition-to go with the flow. Thus, far from providing an independent economic argument for taking "confor- mity to the wishes of the dominant power" as the "proximate test of a good government," the least-cost rule merely restates, hence presupposes, that test. Holmes's argument begs the very question at issue. It is instructive to set the least-cost argument side by side with the opening of Holmes's Northwestern University address: Nature has but one judgment on wrong conduct-if you can call that a judgment which seemingly has no reference to conduct as such-the judgment of death. That is the judgment or the conse- quence which follows uneconomical expenditure if carried far enough. If you waste too much food you starve; too much fuel, you freeze; too much nerve tissue, you collapse.... Accepting behalf of majoritarianism or democracy, a subject that in fact makes no appearance in the letter. 164.

Art, phi- losophy, charity, the search for the north pole, the delirium of every great moment in man's experience-all alike mean uneco- nomic expenditure-mean waste-mean a step toward death.6s Holmes developed from this an argument on behalf of human ideals in the sense we have previously examined. By comparing this passage to his least-cost rule, we see instantly that Holmes here precluded government from adopting ends designed to pro- mote ideals, or at any rate, ideals different from those of the cur- rent dominant majority. Government must adopt ends that avoid the "uneconomic expenditure" that is the defining characteristic of ideals. Men and women live for ideals, but government does not. Bickel wrote movingly that our system of government resides in a "Lincolnian tension between principle and expediency."'66 Government must be committed to absolute principles that have "vast educational value" and exert "crucial influence on the ten- dency of prudential policy," even though "expedient compromises remain[] necessary also, chiefly because a radically principled solu- tion would collide with widespread prejudices, which no govern- ment resting on consent could disregard ..."' Holmes discard- ed the "principle" horn of this dilemma entirely, and thus denied that the Lincolnian tension plays a role in our system of govern- ment. Holmes offered a somewhat different defense of "conformity to the wishes of the dominant power""6 in The Gas-Stokers' Strike. The heart of this brief essay is a methodological criticism of attempting to assess legislation by determining whether it will pro- mote the good "for society, considered as a whole.""69 Holmes objected "that this presupposes an identity of interest between the different parts of a community which does not exist in fact."' 165.

If the welfare of the living majority is para- mount, it can only be on the ground that the majority have the power in their hands. The fact is that legislation .... is neces- sarily made a means by which a body, having the power, put burdens which are disagreeable to them on the shoulders of somebody else."1 Holmes argued, in brief, from the necessity of adopting some class standpoint in order to assess legislation to the necessity of adopt- ing the dominant class's standpoint. Clearly, however, one could just as readily follow Marx and adopt the standpoint of the subor- dinate class, or for that matter of any other class. Holmes's argu- ment therefore presupposes the same normative supremacy of dominant social forces we have found in his argument based on the least-cost rule. cerned."

Holmes's third alternative---criticizing class legislation because it "transcends the limits of self-preference"-appears to offer a moral criterion that is not relativized to one's own class. But this alternative transcends the class standpoint only in part, for the "limits of self-preference" are not objective moral limits; rather, they are limits "imposed by sympathy." Holmes meant to be arguing mere- ly that as a matter of fact, even the most class-biased individuals still have sympathy for members of other classes. If they did not, he implied, there would be no moral basis for criticizing class legislation. 172. Id. 173.

My conjecture is that Holmes admired the manifestation of force because he saw in it the vitality and joy that is our true salvation from despair. To put it another way, I connect Holmes's majoritarian commitment to the vitalism I discussed earlier, his view that "the only question as to whether [life] is worth living is whether you have enough of it."'175 Nietzsche believed that the world consists of will to power and nothing else; as we have seen, Holmes held the similar belief that everything-the dog that wags its tail and the person who frames a syllogism (and, perforce, the syllogism itself)--consists of streams of energy crossing. To affirm the cosmos, then, amounts to affirming the actuality of this energy; hence Holmes's reverence for the dominant force, which exhibits more vitality than the forces it overcomes. Under this reading, Holmes held views similar to the conser- vative utopianism described by Karl Mannheim: The fact of the mere existence of a thing endows it with a higher value, be it, as in the case of Hegel, because of the higher ratio- nality embodied in it, or, as in the case of Stahl, because of the mystifying and fascinating effects of its very irrationality. "There is something marvellous about experiencing something of which it may be said 'it is!"'"76 Holmes put it less breathlessly and in the negative: "I don't be- lieve much in anything that is, but I believe a damned sight less in anything that isn't."'77 Moreover, he valued vitality, not existence, 174.

To fly in the face of the majority is to deny the actual and thus-in Nietzsche's words-to "pass sentence on existence.""178 This Holmes was not prepared to do. At first sight, this analysis seems to contradict Holmes's previ- ously quoted insistence that "it is a joy to some of us to see em- bodied ... man's most peculiar power-the power to deny the actual and to perish."'79 There is no real inconsistency here, how- ever. Holmes always viewed the judge as an exemplar of the soldier's faith--a heroic knight who casts away his own life in the service of his sovereign.I" The idealistic soldier is prepared to deny the actual and perish, but he does so in the service of-what else?-.the actual. As I observed earlier, for Holmes, men and women live for ideals, but government does not.18' No doubt this view implies that Holmes regarded his fellow citizens with a kind of aristocratic disdain, but that is one of the most obvious features of his letters and oratory. C. What of the "Liberal" Holmes? A reader whose familiarity with Holmes begins with his fa- mous "liberal" opinions on free speech (or his earlier liberal opin- ions in labor union cases) may find a puzzling tension between Holmes's defense of the rights of underdogs against dominant ma- jorities and his philosophical deference to dominant social forces. There is, I believe, a solution to this puzzle. Precisely because dominant social forces ought to get their way, Holmes believed that a good society must determine which social force is actually always say yes-whatever is, is right-but not necessarily will be for thirty seconds lon- ger."). 178.

This requires a contest between contenders that is fair, that is, in which legal rules and institutions of yesteryear do not distort the outcome of the struggle. In Vegelahn v. Guntner,1m an 1896 labor case, Holmes wrote that the "conflict between employ- ers and employed" is an instance of the "free struggle for life.... Combination on the one side is patent and powerful. Combination on the other is the necessary and desirable counterpart, if the battle is to be carried on in a fair and equal way."1" This too is the role played by free speech in Holmes's peroration in Gitlow v. New York: "If in the long run the beliefs expressed in proletarian dictatorship are destined to be accepted by the dominant forces of community, the only meaning of free speech is that they should be given their chance and have their way."'84 182. 167 Mass. 92 (1896) (Holmes, J., dissenting), reprinted in THE ESSENTIAL HOLMES, supra note 9, at 124. 183.

In argu- ing that Holmes viewed free speech as a vehicle by which the dominant force in society makes itself known, I am borrowing an insight from Pinkard, supra note t, at 235, 277. Admittedly, the view I am defending here makes better sense of Gitlow and Vegelahn than it does of Holmes's First Amendment opinions from Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 51-52 (1919), to Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 624 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting), though it echoes to some extent in the market metaphors of Abrams (in which, following on the metaphor, Holmes would have regarded legal repres- sion of free speech as a kind of government interference in the market). Id. at 630. White believes that Holmes's Abrams argument that "the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market," id., is of a piece with his nihilistic dictum that truth is "the majority vote of that nation that could lick all others," HOLMES, Natural Law, supra note 61, at 310. WHITE, supra note 9, at 435. This is because White reads Holmes's formulation in Abrams as "[e]quating 'truth' with 'the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market,' " implying that "[f]or Holmes, 'truth' was the equivalent of majoritarian prejudice at any point in time." Id. If this were right, Abrams would represent an eccentric metaphysical worldview, rather than a classic in the Millian liberal tradition. Such a reading would move Abrams closer to the questionable arguments in Vegelahn and Gitlow, though at great cost to one of the world's most famous defenses of free speech. Fortunately, how- ever, Holmes's actual language in Abrams does not go as far as White suggests. Holmes wrote that "the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market" is "the best test of truth," not the best definition of truth. Thus, Holmes did not equate truth with the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market. Rather, regardless of his own quirky epistemology, Holmes offered a formula that is compatible with any view of the nature of truth. Correspondence theorists, coher- ence theorists, pragmatists, and redundancy theorists can haggle to their hearts' content about the definition of truth while still agreeing that the competition of the market pro- vides its best test. On Holmes's free speech views, see, e.g., WHITE, supra note 9, at 412-54; David S. Bogen, The Free Speech Metamorphosis of Mr. Justice Holmes, 11 HOFSTRA L. REV. 97</page><page sequence="55">1994] JUSTICE HOLMES 503 Unfortunately, Holmes's argument does not really resolve the inconsistency between respect for dominant forces and a liberal view of free speech and association."s5 If dominant forces are able to muster the majorities necessary to repress speech they dislike, why should that not be regarded as simply another mani- festation of dominance, which Holmesian judges are bound to respect? To put it another way, why is the true measure of domi- nance victory in a battle "carried on in a fair and equal way"?'" Why is it not simply victory achieved in any way whatever, fair or foul? One possible explanation of Holmes's confusion in this matter is that he fell prey to a common misunderstanding of the Darwin- ian notion of the "free struggle for life" embraced by other nine- teenth-century social thinkers as well."'87 Under this misunder- standing, fitness to survive is a property intrinsic to an organism, a measure of its vitality. In genuine Darwinian theory, by contrast, there can be no such thing as intrinsic fitness: Darwin's explana- tion of evolution is that traits that are adaptive in one environ- ment are fatal in another. Darwinian fitness is a relation between organisms and their environments, not an intrinsic property of organisms. In Vegelahn v. Guntner, Holmes seemed to regard the proper- ty of being a dominant social force as an intrinsic property of groups, which must be discovered through a fair fight on an ideal- (1982); Rogat, supra note 9, at 215-17.

A consistent Darwinian, on the other hand, would argue that if a group has its speech or association suppressed by laws enacted by majorities, then that group is by definition not dominant in its actual environment. The question of whether it would be dominant in a more hospitable environment is simply beside the point. Alternatively, Holmes may have recognized these points but believed that laws restricting trade union association or free ex- pression are not a part of the environment with which groups vying for supremacy must legitimately cope. He may have believed that laws are superpositions by the state on an environment con- sisting essentially of private forces locked in combat, and that it is the private forces, rather than the laws, that pose the challenges that a contender for dominance should rightfully have to sur- mount. In The Common Law, he endorsed "the prevailing view" that the state's "cumbrous and expensive machinery ought not to be set in motion unless some clear benefit is to be derived from disturbing the status quo. State interference is an evil, where it cannot be shown to be a good."'xs It was almost inevitable that Holmes would regard law as an artificial imposition on an extralegal status quo, for the fundamen- tal insight of his legal realism is that judges can make and unmake law (though they customarily deny that this is what they are do- ing):'" "The very considerations which judges most rarely men- tion, and always with an apology, are the secret root from which the law draws all the juices of life. I mean, of course, consider- ations of what is expedient for the community concerned."'" In The Path of the Law, Holmes argued that judges must free them- selves of the illusion that they are finding rather than making law: they must make sure that legal doctrines are no longer "taken for granted without any deliberate, conscious, and systematic question- ing of their grounds."1'91 Law is clay in judges' hands, and like 188.

In line with this, Holmes noted that [t]he philosophical habit of the day, the frequency of legislation, and the ease with which the law may be changed to meet the opinions and wishes of the public, all make it natural and un- avoidable that judges as well as others should openly discuss the legislative principles upon which their decisions must always rest in the end, and should base their judgments upon broad consid- erations of policy to which the traditions of the bench would hardly have tolerated a reference fifty years ago."2 In a contemporary democracy, the mysteries of state are flushed into the open, and everyone can see that law can be changed at will. Any restrictions the law imposes on the struggle for domi- nance are conventional and artificial. Thus, restrictive laws are no more a genuine test of dominance in the free struggle for life than a biased umpire in a game. This being the case, judges who are duty-bound to defer to the wishes of the dominant social forces must nonetheless intervene to ensure that all contenders have a fair opportunity to show that they are dominant. Catherine Drink- er Bowen's romanticized image of Holmes as a "Yankee from Olympus" applies aptly in a way rather different from what she had in mind:'93 the Olympians in Homer's Iliad were enthusiastic spectators of carnage who occasionally intervened to even the odds before settling back to watch fate be enacted. In the end, however, Holmes's inconsistency remains. Groups always arise in an environment shaped by legal as well as extrale- gal forces, and to argue that the former are suspiciously artificial impositions on the latter is a fallacy. This is easy to see by consid- ering Holmes's own example when he argued that the state should not "disturb[] the status quo."'94 His caution against utilizing the state's "cumbrous and expensive machinery""'95 is part of an argu- ment in The Common Law for the tort rule of letting the losses lie where they fall unless the defendant was at fault.

All three are legal rules, crea- tures of the state. All three impose an artificial distribution of losses. None of them disturbs the status quo because there is no status quo: there is no a priori answer to the question of how the parties would distribute the losses if the state were out of the pic- ture."% Holmes ignored the fact that law is no more artificial than any other part of the social environment. This is the fallacy of the strategy outlined in Vegelahn for determining which social class is dominant by staging a competition in a status quo undistorted by law. There is no status quo undistorted by law. Holmes's defense of free speech and association cannot be squared with his defer- ence to dominant social forces. Of course, for those of us who support free speech and labor unions, Holmes's inconsistency is a stroke of luck. The alternative would have been a consistent conservatism that refuses to pass sentence on existence by overruling majoritarian restrictions on the rights of association and speech. To this inconsistency we owe the Gitlow dissent, and perhaps Abrams as well. D. Summary The time has come to summarize my exposition of Holmes's justification of classical judicial self-restraint. I have argued that a justification must answer three questions: (1) Why should a judge place the duties of a narrowly construed judicial role above the 196. Without the state, the parties might distribute the losses by a contest at arms, with results that obviously cannot be predicted in advance. Or they might decide the question by bargaining, with an equally unpredictable outcome. Coasians might disagree with this latter proposition: assuming negligible transaction costs, the result of a bargain with the state out of the picture is the efficient outcome. Ronald H. Coase, The Problem of Social Cost, 3 J.L. &amp; EcoN. 1, 15-16 (1960). Howev- er, this argument assumes that we can unambiguously identify the efficient outcome. As Duncan Kennedy has shown, the ability to do so, even theoretically, presupposes a sys- tem of entitlements already in place. Parties systematically value goods they own more than the same goods in the hands of others. Thus, without a preexisting system of entitlements, the efficient distribution is indeterminate, since the valuations parties place on distributions vary dramatically depending on whether they believe they have preex- isting entitlements to them.

(2) Why should the judicial role be narrowed in deference to the desires of electoral majorities? (3) What traits of character are necessary for a judge to fulfill the demand for judicial self-restraint? In answer to the first question, I have elaborated Holmes's curious skeptical and vitalist twist on the Kantian exaltation of duty. Holmes, like Kant, insisted on duty undertaken for reasons logically and practically distinct from the expectation that it will yield good consequences. Holmes, like Kant, insisted that from the scientific standpoint human behavior is subject to deterministic laws and that moral freedom must be postulated in the teeth of determinism for purposes of practical life. Holmes, like Kant, postulated in addition a standpoint beyond that of science and deterministic laws--in Kant's words, "an order and a legislation different from that of the mechanism of nature" that is necessary if moral life is to be possible.197 Kant called this standpoint of the "intelligible world,"'98 and it corresponds to Holmes's "infi- nite perspective."'99 Unlike Kant, however, Holmes denied as a childish fancy the existence of a moral law within, and instead located the true nobil- ity of duty in its very lack of foundation. To Holmes, it was the primordial senselessness of duty that creates the ennobling poign- ancy of throwing away one's life in obedience to a blindly accept- ed duty, for a cause which one little understands. That is how we wreak ourselves on life, and in this way the rule of joy and the law of duty indeed become one. Holmes fashioned his justification of majoritarianism from the same spiritual material as his justification of duty: he believed that revering dominant social forces, like hurling oneself into duty, is part of the joyful affirmation of life as we actually find it. At bot- tom, we affirm the dominant inclinations of society because the promptings of vital force require no warrant and we know in our bones that in the end no warrant for them is to be found. Lastly, the virtue the Holmesian judge must possess in order to sustain himself in his efforts is a kind of Nietzschean master- morality: a military and aristocratic sense of honor that finds in 197.

IV. WHAT Do WE MAKE OF HOLMES? To fault Holmes's views is at once trivially easy and excruciat- ingly difficult. Taken in the large, we may find ourselves unable to accept his atheism, or his Emersonian mysticism, or his vitalism, or his irrationalism, or his virtually unargued insistence on the arbi- trariness of morality. We may not share his preoccupation with the threat of meaninglessness, his "eternal terror" and his sense that "we are all very near despair."" If we do share it we may fail to see how the solution can lie, as Holmes thought it does, in celebrating the indifference of the universe to everything we hold dear. The cosmic indifference that Holmes seized upon as the solution is, after all, very close to what most of us would take to be the problem. Taken in the small, many of Holmes's views surely will pro- voke objections, particularly from analytic philosophers whose business is the careful assessment of arguments. Holmes's dual aspect theory, his commitment to the Ding an sich, his systematic blurring of the distinction between reasons and causes, his reduc- tion of value judgments to naked preferences, his determinism, his philosophical psychology of the "cosmic ganglion,"20" his bizarre view that ideals cannot be truly worthwhile if they are capable of being achieved, his insistence on pointless deontology, his conser- vative utopianism, and other aspects of his worldview are all deep- ly problematic. Nevertheless, it is a monumental and inspiring worldview, and surely no purpose is served by carping at its margins or even, for that matter, sneering at its grand animating premises, with which we can all partly sympathize. Moreover, the fact that Holmes re- corded his ideas primarily in personal letters and occasional orato- ry suggests that we must approach his doctrine in a more generous spirit than that in which we read systematic treatises written for publication. Finally, there is a sense in which Holmes has given us so much more philosophical depth than we had a right to expect 200. See supra Part II. 201.

The doubts I wish to raise are thus of a different nature from direct disputation of the propositions Holmes advances. I wish to ask, first, whether Holmes's views can possibly form a satisfactory public justification of judicial self-restraint; second, whether they can form a psychologically stable self-conception of the judicial role; and third, whether the basic metaphors, entirely military, through which he understood social life and even existence as a whole can be accepted. To all three questions I suggest that the answer is no. The point of the first question is that classical judicial self- restraint is a public institution and not a private heuristic of judi- cial deliberation. Public institutions require justifications that are publicly acceptable, not merely philosophically true. Kant claimed that it is a "transcendental formula of public right" that "[a]ll ac- tions affecting the rights of other human beings are wrong if their maxim is not compatible with their being made public."202 Though this "publicity principle" stands in need of justification that I am in no position to provide here, it seems eminently plau- sible that a justification for an institution of public law that would excite widespread and principled condemnation if it were publi- cized has no place in a democracy.203 Indeed, Judge Richard Posner has introduced a similar test into the discussion of judicial activism, arguing that "a decision is principled [rather than result- oriented] if and only if the ground of decision can be stated truth- fully in a form the judge could publicly avow without inviting virtually universal condemnation by professional opinion.2"" On the basis of this rule of thumb, Posner condemns judicial activism, understood by him to mean deliberate expansion of the powers of the judiciary relative to other governmental institutions.205 I be- lieve, however, that the publicity test also rules out Holmes's de- fense of classical judicial self-restraint. 202.

A form of judicial review based on atheism and cosmic indifference to human aspiration, on the arbitrariness of all value judgments, on the contemptibility of attempting to relieve human suffering through public policy, and on judicial "obedience to a blindly accepted duty"'2 to speed one's fellow citizens on their self-elected path to Hell could not survive the test of full publicity. It is scarcely credible that we would accept as a job descrip- tion of the federal judiciary "that if my fellow citizens want to go to Hell I will help them."207 The appearance of a national con- sensus on the importance of judicial self-restraint obscures the fact that activist judges often win admiration for their pains: even Americans who claim sincerely that they back judicial self-restraint also expect the federal judiciary to perform acts of statesmanship, to hack through the Gordian knots of legislative stupidity and bureaucratic red tape.28 As government at all levels has become larger, more bureau- cratized, and more administrative in the decades since the New Deal, the federal courts have often taken on something of the role of the body politic's nervous system. When we cannot voice our grievances or obtain redress from politicians and bureaucrats, we either "lump it" or turn to the courts; when a public policy causes us pain, we register that pain through the courts. Though we do not want government by judiciary-or at least we say we do not-we need and expect the federal courts to save government from its own infirmities, including legislatures with short time hori- zons, the well-known forms of democratic failure, the structural and political inabilities of national government to absorb informa- tion about past bad choices, and sheer official inertia. This is the rationale for a widely construed judicial role-"judicial activ- ism"-and it signals the immense gulf between our public expecta- tions and Holmes's sardonic credo. 206. See supra text accompanying note 119. 207. See supra text accompanying note 141. 208. See generally RICHARD NEELY, How COURTS GOVERN AMERICA (1981) (arguing that when representative institutions and governmental bureaucracies fail, judges must intervene).</page><page sequence="63">1994] JUSTICE HOLMES 511 The plain fact is that Holmes's indifference to the public consequences of governmental decisions,2 his coolness toward reform and amelioration, his aloofness from the statesman's role, and the inhuman Darwinian and Emersonian "infinite perspective" that substituted in his thought for concern about the here and now were debilitating omissions from a sound judicial philosophy. Judg- es are first and foremost public officials commissioned to promote the public welfare. Holmes, however, found scant place in his system for this realization.2"' If Holmes's views cannot form a palatable public philosophy of judging, perhaps they can still constitute a judge's secret article of faith, as they did for Holmes himself.211 Yet here too prob- lems arise. By analogy to Kant's publicity principle, which asks whether a policy can stably be adopted without public deception, we can test a private worldview by asking whether an agent can stably maintain it without self-deception. Holmes's worldview fails this test. Recall his letter to Wu: "I suspect that all my ultimates have the mark of the finite upon them, but as they are the best I know I give them practical respect, love, etc., but inwardly doubt wheth- 209. This indifference is perceptively documented and discussed by Rogat, supra note 9, at 243-47; see also Grey, Pragmatism, supra note 9, at 836-50. 210. It will be objected that Holmes stressed the importance of judicial policymaking in The Common Law, in The Path of the Law, and elsewhere. Yet his policymaking con- cerns ran entirely in the direction of improving the organic integrity of legal doctrine, not toward improving society. As he explained in a letter, I often think not without sadness of the profound difference in the interest of my friend the Chief Justice [White] and myself-so profound that I never talk about my half. He is always thinking what will be the practical effect of the decision (which of course is the ultimate justification [or] condemnation of the principle adopted.) I think of its relation to the theory and philosophy of the law. .... Letter from Oliver W. Holmes to Canon Patrick Augustine Sheehan (Jan. 31, 1913), in HOLMES-SHEEHAN CORRESPONDENCE, supra note 41, at 58, 58. This passage suggests that Holmes may have embraced a kind of rule utilitarianism, according to which the "ulti- mate justification" of a legal principle lies in its consequences, but under which a judge will achieve the best overall consequences by ignoring consideration of consequences and considering only "the theory and philosophy of law." For a rather different view of Holmes's approach to judicial policymaking, see Mark Tushnet, The Logic of Experience: Oliver Wendell Holmes on the Supreme Judicial Court, 63 VA. L.

Holmes added, in his letter to Wu concerning the cosmic ganglion, "This is pri- vate talk, not to be quoted to others, for one is shy and sensitive as to one's inner con- victions, except in those queer moments when one tells the world as poets and philoso- phers do."

Yet talk of the "trick" that keeps us on the job makes it clear that self-deception lies at the heart of Holmes's "jobbism": in order to remain committed to the job, we must repress our knowl- edge of nature's trick. One corollary of Holmes's conception of ideals as the pursuit of "an end which derives its worth simply from his having affirmed it"214 is that the pursuit itself, not the end pursued, is the real source of value. That, of course, is why he referred to framing the ideal as nature's trick for keeping us on the job, rather than merely nature's way of keeping us on the job. If the pursuit itself is the real source of value, we must in our own conscious designs pursue something else. Pursuing a pursuit as such is meaningless, almost logically impossible, and thus a fully conscious realization that meaning comes from the pursuit rather than from the end pursued would itself undermine the very condi- tion of meaningfulness by bringing us to a halt. (That is why such thoughts must occur to us only on the Saturday half-holiday.) Though Holmes never framed the argument in these terms, the point is closely related to the so-called paradox of hedonism, the fact that one sure way to fail in the pursuit of pleasure is to make pleasure as such the object of the pursuit. Pleasure can emerge only as the byproduct of other activities.215 In the end, then, Holmes offered a set of philosophical commitments that no judge can maintain without self-deception. Indeed, matters are even worse than this observation suggests. Ronald Dworkin has drawn attention to an important distinction between "external" and "internal" skepticism. An external skeptic holds, as a matter of metaphysics, that our "opinions are projected upon, not discovered in, 'reality.' "26 An internal skeptic, by con- trast, "addresses the substance of the claims he challenges," insist- 212. Id. at 35. 213. Id. at 36. 214. Letter from Oliver W.

RONALD DWORKIN, LAW'S EMPIRE 80 (1986).</page><page sequence="65">1994] JUSTICE HOLMES 513 ing that they are mistaken or at least not proven.217 Adopting Dworkin's terminology, we may characterize Holmes's point in his letter to Wu as externally skeptical-Holmes doubted the meta- physical credentials, the "referentiality," of all beliefs--but not as internally skeptical, since he denied that such doubts have an ef- fect on which beliefs gain our practical respect and credence. However, the embarrassing fact is that a purely external skep- ticism, even if such a thing could exist without self-deception in a psychologically stable human being, provides no argument for judi- cial self-restraint. If a judge's skepticism is only external, then her views should not change a millimeter within the game of constitu- tional and factual argumentation, and thus the skepticism provides no more reason to defer to the judgments of legislatures than she would have if she were convinced that her views are necessary truths about the order of being. Only if there is leakage from external to internal skepticism--only, that is, if a judge's external skepticism partially undermines the internal credibility of her con- victions-can skepticism make a difference. If so, however, it must occur to the judge that precisely the same skeptical considerations undermine the credibility of everyone's convictions. In such a case, the puzzle still remains of why judges should defer to legislators. The appeal to skepticism leaves the basic problem untouched. Finally, I wish to point to the most obviously troubling feature of Holmes's philosophy, and indeed his entire authorship: his re- lentless insistence on understanding the world through military metaphors. The biographical reasons for this are clear: as virtually every writer on Holmes has realized, his Civil War experiences irrevocably colored his subsequent world outlook.2"8 But whatever his reasons for viewing the world as a battlefield and all of us as soldiers, it should be clear that this leads to an extraordinary de- 217.

White offers what seems to me the most acute assessment of the effect of Holmes's wartime experiences on his subsequent views. Stressing that Holmes later ro- manticized what at the time he took to be a horrific set of experiences, and noting that Holmes quit the military service when he found himself unable to stand any more, White conjectures that Holmes experienced a kind of survivor's guilt that led him to recast his legal career as though it were continued military service.

When Holmes wrote that "all law means I will kill you if necessary to make you conform to my requirements,"219 it is obvious that he had fastened on the one feature of law most like war-its physical enforcement-and used it to obscure all other aspects, such as the fact that law can provide a peaceable alternative to violence. It seems almost incredible that Holmes could neglect to such a degree the conventional view of law as a nonviolent system of settling disputes that would otherwise be settled by force. Holmes may well have regarded this conventional view as ahistorical, inas- much as his investigations of the 1870s convinced him that the true origin of legal liability was not the spirit of peace and recon- ciliation but the spirit of revenge.220 Nevertheless, he went on to argue that this origin has repeatedly been overwritten by the good sense of judges who labored to preserve the form of unbroken precedential tradition while replacing irrational content with ratio- nal content.221 The idea that peaceful resolution of disputes is a rational aim of social policy was plainly not a strange one to Holmes, so the question remains why he neglected it so systemati- cally. Apparently, Holmes, like Karl von Clausewitz, regarded war as a continuation of politics, and thus politics as a continuation of war.22 This view, as both Clausewitz and Holmes should have known, distorts the character of war as much as that of politics. It conflates the many cultural and religious variations in the history of warmaking and downplays the singularity of combat as a human activity.223 At the same time, identifying politics and commerce as varieties of combat collapses the distinctions between speech and battle and between political power and violence that lie at the 219.

"I don't see why we shouldn't do our job in the station in which we were born without waiting for an angel to assure us that it is the jobbest job in jobdom," Holmes wrote.225 The whole notion of "the station in which we were born" is an anachronistic invocation of a society of hereditary estates carrying strong overtones of knightly ideals. Significantly, Holmes-a lifelong admirer of Walter Scott--employ- ed an extended chivalric metaphor in accepting an honorary law degree from Yale: I accept it proudly as an accolade, like the little blow upon the shoulder from the sword of a master of war which in ancient days adjudged that a soldier had won his spurs and pledged his life to decline no combat in the future. The power of honor to bind men's lives is not less now than it was in the Middle Ages.226 For our purposes, the most important misunderstanding fos- tered by Holmes's militarism is his treatment of all professional obligations as soldierly duties. The soldier's role is constructed around the exigencies of combat, chief among them being unques- tioned obedience in dangerous situations. In the extremity of com- bat, the demands of role overwhelm concerns of conscience. But the same cannot be said of many other occupations, including the occupation of judging. Holmes's immense literary talents can al- most persuade us that the life of the law is a perpetual struggle to 224.

I do not mean to deny that Holmes was influenced by Bentham and Austin, though he himself downplayed their influ- ence in a sadly self-serving effort to stress his own originality. In his heart of hearts Holmes may have regarded himself as a utili- tarian. Nor do I mean to deny some thematic overlap, or even overlap in specific arguments, between Holmes and the utilitarians. My claim is rather that Holmes rejected so many of the defining principles of utilitarianism that his affinities with both classical and contemporary utilitarianism are more misleading than illuminating. To begin, let me set out some definitions and distinctions. Utilitarianism is a doctrine much more specific than a general in- junction to take real-world consequences into account in our as- sessment of law or other action (a doctrine that I do not doubt Holmes maintained). Utilitarianism in addition specifies the kind of consequences that matter and the way we are supposed to take them into account. This comes out clearly in the three-part defi- nition offered by Amartya Sen and Bernard Williams, according to whom utilitarianism is "sum-ranked welfarist consequentialism."229 227.

In correspondence, Thomas Grey has urged that I have badly underestimated Holmes's utilitarian affinities and has pointed out dozens of passages in Holmes's writing that exhibit those affinities. Grey's forceful arguments have persuaded me of the need for the present Appendix, and I wish to thank him for his generosity and patience, as well as for innumerable specific points of interpretation about Holmes that he has cleared up for me.

"Welfarism" means that the rele- vant consequences are those pertaining to human welfare."3 And "sum-ranking" tells us that welfare should be assessed by adding the welfare of all affected individuals.232 Typically, sum-ranking postulates that "each counts for one, none for more than one." Though there is nothing to prevent a sum-ranking welfarist consequentialist from dropping this assumption, I take it to be a central element of the utilitarian credo-one, I will suggest, that there is little evidence Holmes believed. In sum, utilitarianism is defined by four propositions: U.1. Actions should be assessed according to their conse- quences. U.2. The relevant consequences are those pertaining to hu- man welfare. U.3. Human welfare is assessed by summing the welfare of all affected individuals. U.4. In performing this addition, each counts for one and none for more than one.233 "Welfare" is an ambiguous and controversial term. The classi- cal hedonistic utilitarians identified welfare with happiness or plea- sure, a view that-as I argued previously-is inconsistent with Holmes's unvarnished contempt for pleasure, or even for a life of 4 (Amartya Sen &amp; Bernard Williams eds., 1982). 230. Id. at 3. 231. Id. 232. Id. at 4. 233. Proposition U.4 is not as straightforward as it may appear. One way of under- standing it links it to the problem of measuring utility. Since there is no straightforward way of comparing your utility to mine, "each counts for one and none for more than one" can be understood as a methodological postulate requiring us to "normalize" mea- surements, that is, to calibrate our measurements so that everyone's minimum utility has a value of zero and everyone's maximum utility is assigned the value of one. This pro- cedure eliminates by stipulation the possibility that, as a matter of empirical fact, some individuals are capable of more intense happiness and suffering than others. To the ex- tent that the latter is a coherent possibility, including proposition U.4 in the definition of utilitarianism abandons one of the theory's chief attractions, namely its insistence that moral judgments should be based in natural fact rather than in a priori axioms. On another reading, "each counts for one and none for more than one" does not require us to normalize utility measurements--all it does is insist that judgments be based solely on utility measurements, not on irrelevant factors such as wealth, race, gender, nationality, or social standing.</page><page sequence="71">1994] JUSTICE HOLMES 519 minimal comfort, as expressed in The Soldier's Faith.' However, hedonistic utilitarianism can be divided into positive and negative varieties; the positive hedonist wants to maximize pleasure while the negative hedonist wants to minimize pain. As we shall see, there is some scanty evidence that Holmes entertained a negative utilitarian view. Contemporary utilitarians identify welfare with preference satisfaction rather than with pleasure." Preference utilitarianism, like hedonistic utilitarianism, can come in positive and negative varieties; the former aims to maximize satisfied preferences, while the latter aims to minimize frustrated preferences. Ideal utilitarian- ism, by contrast with both hedonistic and preference utilitarianism, identifies welfare with the attainment of some ideal distinct from both pleasure and satisfied preferences. Mill voiced the ideal utili- tarian view when he distinguished "higher" from "lower" pleasures and insisted that it is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.2 Finally, it is customary to distinguish between act utilitarian- ism and rule utilitarianism; the former judges the utility of indi- vidual actions while the latter judges the utility of social rules, insisting that we should follow the rule that yields the most utility even if doing so does not maximize utility in the individual in- stance." Let us now examine how Holmes fits in this grid of distinc- tions and definitions. I have no doubt that Holmes accepted consequentialism (U.1) as a jurisprudential first principle: he insist- ed that judges have a "duty of weighing considerations of social advantage"238 and claimed that "the secret root from which the law draws all the juices of life" is "considerations of what is expe- dient for the community concerned."'9 234.

We have seen from The Soldier's Faith that he was no positive hedonist, and his denunciation of ease and comfort in that speech, his exaltation of suffering,240 suggests that Holmes rejected nega- tive hedonism (pain minimization) as well. On the other hand, there are passages elsewhere in which he seems to justify majoritarian legislation by the argument that going along with, rather than resisting, the dominant force in society will spare the losers pain-a negative utilitarian argument: "[T]he law has no choice but to satisfy the craving [for revenge] itself, and thus avoid the greater evil of private retribution... ,";241 "As long as the instinct [to defend one's property] remains, it will be more com- fortable for the law to satisfy it in an orderly manner, than to leave people to themselves."242 And, in The Gas Stokers' Strike, he expressed the hope that "an educated sympathy should reduce the sacrifice of minorities to a minimum."'43 On the whole, how- ever, I find these passing remarks too slender a basis for confi- dently ascribing negative hedonism to Holmes. Did Holmes identify welfare with preference satisfaction? To be sure, he argued that "[t]he true science of law ... consists in the establishment of its postulates from within upon accurately measured social desires .. 2.""44 and he wished to "keep the ad- ministration of the law in accord with the wishes and feelings of the community.""' This language suggests that preference satis- faction is the goal of law. Goal of law or not, however, it emphati- cally fails to suggest that Holmes thought that satisfying social desires would enhance human welfare. On the contrary, he wrote, "Personally I bet that the crowd if it knew more wouldn't want what it does-but that is immaterial."2'4 Moreover, as I argued in the text, Holmes regarded preferences as little more than post hoc rationalizations of actions undertaken, quite literally, for no reason 240.

If Holmes was a welfarist at all, he was an ideal welfarist, that is, he identified genuine human well-being with living (or dying) for ideals. That, at any rate, is the argument of Part II of this Article. However, Holmes did not believe that government should be engaged in the pursuit of ideals,248 which are both too individ- ual and too fraught with peril to be proper objects of public poli- cy. Thus, even if Holmes was a welfarist, the ideals whose pursuit counts as genuine human welfare do not provide a criterion by which action or policy should be judged. Thus, Holmes cannot be said to accept proposition U.2. Nor is there any reason to believe that Holmes accepted sum- ranking (U.3), even when it comes to "accurately measured social desires."249 Holmes believed in deferring to the portion of society with the most power, and the practical stand-in that Holmes used as an index of power was command of a legislative majority-an indirect sum-ranking index.250 But there is no reason to believe that he identified dominant power with aggregate social desire. In fact, his insistence that it is a difficult scientific and technical task to ascertain "the intensity of the competing desires'"251 suggests that he saw a difference between social desires and (legislative) majoritarian desires: after all, ascertaining the latter poses no chal- lenge at all. Thus, his majoritarianism is not a sign that he accept- ed proposition U.3, and apart from majoritarianism, his writings are simply silent on the subject of the sum-ranking of preferenc- es-with one exception, a passage that indicates that he rejected sum-ranking. In The Gas Stokers' Strike, Holmes argued that legislation is inevitably class legislation, and that we cannot object to class leg- islation on the grounds that it fails to benefit the community at large.252 This, I believe, is the most explicit textual evidence that 247.

It is indirect, because the legislative majority on any given issue may not corre- spond to the majority of the electorate; for example, some sets of 51 senators may have received fewer total votes than the 49 senators opposing them. 251.

The only valid objections to class legislation are that it fails to benefit the class it is supposed to benefit, or that some other class has become dominant, or-finally-that it is too unfair to the subordinate classes (it "transcends the limits of self-preference which are imposed by sympathy"253). Plainly, these three reasons are a long way from the utilitarian commitment to fairness and equality expressed in propositions U.3 and U.4. In short, Holmes was a consequentialist, but in no other way was he a utilitarian. His frequent invocations of concepts such as "expedien[ce],"254 "convenience,"255 "the worth of the re- sult,"256 and the like reflect his consequentialism, his sense that legal decisions should do something worthwhile, but they reflect nothing more specific. They do not suggest that the worthwhile thing legal decisions should do is enhance happiness, satisfy prefer- ences, or realize ideals; nor that law should be worthwhile for the whole community rather than a single class within it; nor that each counts for one and none for more than one. His consequentialism seems at times to be more an argumen- tative tool than a deep philosophical commitment. In many of the passages in which Holmes employed the language of consequences, his aim was polemical rather than constructive. He commended attention to consequences and policy in order to criticize decision- making based on formalism, blind tradition, or logic. Holmes clear- ly meant to be striking a blow on behalf of modernity, anti-super- naturalism, science, and rationality, and in this he was undoubtedly an ally of the utilitarians, whose aims were similar. The utilitarians were at the forefront of the temper of the times; sharing the tem- per of the times with them, however, is not enough to make Holmes a utilitarian. Finally, recall that to the extent that Holmes was a conse- quentialist, he was a rule consequentialist, who believed that judg- es will best realize good effects from their decisions if they base 253.
