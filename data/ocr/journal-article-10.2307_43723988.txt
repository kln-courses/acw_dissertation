<plain_text><page sequence="1">A STUDY IN THE EXEGETICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE GREEK TEXT OF 2 SM 11:2 - 1 KINGS 2:11 In 1907 Thackeray had already seen that the books of the Kingdoms were translated by different translators.1 His identifications, which are essentially correct,2 establish the section 2 Sm 11:2 - 1 Kgs 2:11 as the work of a separate translator, and it is this segment which is to be treated in this paper. It has been a basic principle underlying the work of the Gehman school3 that the product of each translator must be separately studied to discover the principles of exegesis and hermeneutics influencing the work of the translators. Methodologically the same principles have been followed as in earlier articles of the writer.4 There it appeared that such exegetical tendencies could only be studied where the Greek deviates from the Hebrew. Every instance of mistranslation, shorter text, longer text, etc. must be exam- ined to see whether any pattern of prejudice might betray itself. The facile assumption on the part of many commentators that wherever the Greek deviates from the Hebrew the Vorlage of the Greek was different from MT is, of course, rejected, and a respect for the antiquity of MT maintained.5 1 H. St. J. Thackeray, "The Greek Translators of the Four Books of Kings," J TS 8 (1907) 262-78; id., A Grammar of the Old Testament in Greek according to the Septuagint (Cambridge, 1909), I, Par. 2. 2 Though B. H. Kelly in a thesis (as yet unpublished) on the Greek translation of 2 Sm 1 :1-11 :1, accepted in partial fulfillment for the degree of Doctor of The- ology at The Theological Seminary at Princeton, maintains that this section was not correctly divided by Thackeray. 3 It is certainly correct to refer to a Gehman School of Septuagint Studies. This approach to the Greek translation of the O.T. which the writer has followed was first formulated in textual criticism seminars by his former teacher and later colleague, Prof. H. S. Gehman, at Princeton. Cf. his "The Theological Approach of the Greek Translator of Job 1-15," JBL 68 (1949) 231 ff.; "Exegetical Methods Employed by the Greek Translator of I Samuel," J AO S 70 (1950) 292ff. ; review of L. Prijs, Jüdische Tradition in der Septuaginta, id., 304ff. ; "The Hebraic Charac- ter of Septuagint Greek," Vet T 1 (1951) 81ff. 4 Cf. especially "Exegetical Principles Underlying the Septuagint Text of I Kings ii 12 - xxi 43," Oud Stu 8 (Leiden, 1950) 300ff. and "Principles of Interpretation Guiding the Fourth Translator of the Book of the Kingdoms (3 Kgs 22:1-4 Kgs 25:30)," CBQ 14 (1952) 40ff. 6 This shift in emphasis (a shift which took place among Classical and Indie scholars long ago) is particularly seen among Scandinavian and Dutch scholars, though the pendulum has probably swung too far in their case. One has but to con- sult such works as Lars G. Rignell, Die Nachtgesichte des Sachar ja (Lund, 1950) 30</page><page sequence="2">Principles Underlying the Greek Text 31 In studying the work of this translator one naturally compares it with the section 1 Kgs 22 :1 - 2 Kgs 25 :30 since, according to Thackeray these two portions seem to be "the work of a single hand."6 As in that section so here the translator is almost Aquilanic for the most part in his literal- ism. This often results in renderings which are almost devoid of sense. E.g., only with the help of the H mtqdst could the participle in 11 :4 kai autě 'agiamomene apo akatharsias be understood. At times, this literalism produces a text which is quite unintelligible as at 11 :7. Among other things David asks Uriah Islwm hmlhmh (about the progress of the war) ; G renders this by eis eirënën toy polemoy . This literalism is so wooden that even obvious errors in H are reproduced verbatim such as at 13 :17 : "And he called his servant . . . wy'mr slhw " The plural imperative has no antecedent, and moderns either change the antecedent to the plural, or this verb to the singular. G, however, even exaggerates the difficulty by an epexegetical plus: k. eipen aytõ exaposteilate. Semitic idioms are also rendered into Greek with Aquilanic exactness. At 13:22 the con- struction 7 dbr ' sr (because) becomes epi logoy (oy. In the following v. Isntym ymym (after two full years) is rendered by eis diet irida 'êmerõn. In 15 :2 the idiom 7 yd in the phrase "He would stand beside the way of the gate" is reproduced by ana cheira.1 In H the participle hôlëk or the Inf. Abs. hãlõk can be used in coordination with a participle or verbal adjective adverbially in the sense of "continually." G rendered these lit- erally at 13:19: por ey omene k. krazoysa ; at 15:12: k. (o laos 'o poreyo - menos k. polys , and at 18 :25 : poreyomenos k. eggizõn . Since the H Vorlage was unpointed, curious misunderstandings were possible, and G evinces a strange lack of sense at times as a result. At 14:17 the woman of Tekoa says to the king: "Let the word of my lord the king Imnhh (to be read as limnûhâ ). G understood the word as leminha, rendering it by eis thysias , which seems to make no sense at all. In 18:28 Ahimaaz expresses his joy at the defeat of the men 'šr ns'w 't ydm against the king. Metathesis of n and ś šis responsible for G's: t. misoyntas ten cheira aytõn, but it is by no means clear what the Greek is supposed to mean.8 One more example will suffice - that of 23:10. H or B. D. Eerdmans, The Hebrew Book of Psalms ( Oud Stu 4; Leiden, 1947) to see evidence of an almost uncritical acceptance of MT. e Grammar, p. 10. Because of this the latter was called the fourth iranslator in the CBQ article cited in note 4 supra. I should now prefer to revise this to "Fifth" for reasons which will appear below. ï Similarly in v. 18. 8 Is V miseõ to be understood transitively here, i.e., to render hatetul f it so, it is without parallel known to me.</page><page sequence="3">32 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 15 states that the people ysbw ' hryw . Any beginner in Hebrew would know that the verb was the root hub; yet the Greek reproduces this mechanically by ekathëto opisõ aytoy, as though it were the root ysb. In view of this extreme literalism on the part of this translator, any deviation of G from H takes on much more significance, and it is therefore necessary to exam- ine the text with great care. One of the characteristics of the translator of the last section of the books of the Kingdoms9 was the large number of transliterations which he used. If Thackeray's suggestion that he is also the translator of this sec- tion be correct,10 the same situation might be expected here. In spite of the litěralness of the translation, it has very few transliterations; the only ones that occur, besides proper nouns, are arabõth in 15 :28 and 17 :16, and araphõth in 17:19 (which were probably understood as proper nouns); nebel in 16:1; saphphõth in 17:29 (a hapax legomenon in Hebrew) ; toy kechar in 18:23 (taken as a place name, which would be possible), and cheroybeim in 22:11. The two words nebel and cheroybeim were common and were undoubtedly words incorporated into the Greek spoken by the translator.11 From this paucity of transliterations it is clearly apparent that this section is not the work of the translator of 3 Kgs 22:1-4 Kgs 25:30. This conclusion is further supported by a second characteristic of this translation which is not apparent in the former, namely, the added color which is often added to a narrative through some slight change in sense. In the Nathan parable at 12 :4 the traveler coming to the rich man is called VA. G amplifies this nicely to tõ xenõ ' odoiporõ . At 12 :21 the king's serv- ants say to David: "You fasted and wept," to which G adds k . egrypneis (and spent the night sleeplessly). Obviously this is not textual but inter- pretative. At 13:1 Tamar is made to be particularly beautiful. H states that Absalom had an 'hwh yph, which G expands as adelphê kalë tö eidei sphodra. The translator apparently enjoyed the entire Tamar story. In v. 5 Amnon says to his father: "Let Tamar come to feed me ( wtbrny )." G makes this much more picturesque by using k . psõmisatõ me, i.e., "that she may feed me by putting little bits into my mouth." In v. 20 G got the point of the story very well. After her humiliation Tamar remained wsmmh (in a desolate state) in her brother's house. G renders this by chëreysa (being in a state of widowhood) which in a sense is what H had in mind. » Cf. CBQ 14 (1952) 42ff. 10 Cf. note 6 supra. 11 Cf. note 9 supra.</page><page sequence="4">Principles Underlying the Greek Text 33 In 15:34 G considerably expands David's instruction to Hushai. He is told to say to Absalom: " Dielêlythasin ' oi adelphoi soy k. 'o basileys katopisthen moy dielêlythen 'o pater soy k. nyn your servant am I, o king, eas on me zësai (for 'hyh probably read as the root hyh). A servant of your father was I then k . artiõs and now I am your servant." By these additions the counsel is made more clever. G had a sense of dramatics. That G enjoyed the hero stories about Benaiah is obvious from his rendering of 23:21. Benaiah killed an Egyptian who was armed with a spear ( hnyt ). G made this a dory 'õs xylon diabathras . Thereupon he went down to him bsbt (with a club) ; this G rendered by en tõ dorati , i.e., the Egyptian is made the subject of the verb. It seems that according to G's version of the tale Benaiah approached the Egyptian with his bare hands, wrenched the spear from him and then killed him with it. There ought also to be noted numerous additions scattered throughout this section which betray no prejudice, and hence are of no immediate interest for this paper. Some of these may have been necessary for in- terpreting H correctly. At 11:6 and 19:14 (15) the verb V slh is correctly understood as implying the sending of a message; accordingly legõn / -onte s are added respectively. On a number of occasions the subject of the verb eipen is expressed in G as at 12 :5,22 ; 14 :30, and 18 :23. At times this may be done in order to avoid any possible confusion as in the last two cases cited. Occasionally such confusion would only be possible in G due to its lack of a means for distinguishing gender for finite verbal forms, as at 13:14,16, where "Amnon" is added. At 22:8b it is exegetically necessary to designate the subject. It reads "And they (the foundations) were shaken because kyrios was angry with them." Without kyrios expressed, the antecedent of the verb in Greek would be gë . In Hebrew, however, the fact that 'rs is feminine renders confusion impossible. Again the presence of kyrios 12 has here no textual significance. Nor does the epexegetical addition of an indirect object usually have either textual or interpretative significance. When the translator adds aytõ to "and he said" at 13 :17, or to "she did obeisance" at 14:4, or aytois to "Absalom had commanded" at 13:29, it is not to be taken seriously. The addition of epi prosõpon aytoy to "Shimei fell down" at 19:18(19) is another illustration of this same phenomenon. It is only rarely that G allows himself to break away from a literalistic rendering in order to reproduce the Hebrew idiom by a Greek one. At 14:26 the phrase b'bn hmlk is correctly understood; G has en tõ siklõ tõ basüikö . The same thing is true at 21 :16 where the verb V 'mr *n 12 Or of 'o theos in the parallel passage in Ps 18.</page><page sequence="5">34 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. IS the clause wýmr Ihkwt 't dwd is rendered by dienoeito . More usually however, G is mechanically literalistic, and even amplifications of the text are quite unimaginative. This is true, e.g., at 12:21 where G adds k . pepõkas to "And you ate bread," or in the preceding v. where H with good literary sense has wys'l wyśymw hv Ihm . To the verb "he sought" G pedantically adds arton phagein. On the other hand, the fact of G's pedantically mechanical methods gives greater value to its text for the textual criticism of MT. Parablepsis has in a number of cases resulted in a shorter Hebrew text and G may be used for restoring the earlier text. The recurrence of wl' in 13:21, of hmlk in 13 :27, or hhr in 13 :34, of bfs in 14:30 and of msbt in 18:18 gave rise to parablepsis on the part of the Hebrew copyist which error was responsible for MT. In each of these cases G had the longer text. Similarly parablepsis due to homoeoarchy at 19:9(10) and 24:15 created MT. At 19:9(10) G has k. apo tēs basileias aytoy k. apo Abessalõm for H : m* I 'bslwm. It would seem that G's Vorlage had a text something like wmmmlktw wm'l 'bslwm. Similarly a clause beginning with wybhr must have fallen out due to homoeoarchy of wytn, thereby producing MT at 24:15. It is more difficult to find palaeographic reasons for the omission in MT of a lengthy statement which must originally have been part of the story at 11:22. Nonetheless restoration must be made on the basis of G as most commentators do.18 There are also other instances in which G may be used for correcting MT. MT is certainly wrong at 13:37; G identifies the subject of the verb "to weep" as 'o basileys Dayeid, and that is demanded by the passage. It has often been suggested14 that Abiathar should be mentioned at 15:24 along with Sadok. The original G text may well have had e pi Abiathar , later corrupted to apo Abiathar , and still later to apo baithar. This rendered an original 7 'bytr (in the custody of Abiathar). In H this was corrupted to wýl ' bytr and placed after h!lhym(2) by error, thus producing MT. One other example must suffice. At 16:13 the Kittel footnote deletes Vmtw in the statement wysql b'bnym Vmtw. G renders the word in dispute by apo plagiõn aytoy, i.e., msVtw, which makes excellent sense (Shimei threw stones from the side of the hill). The word was later corrupted to MT because of the earlier occurrence of the word in the v. w Cf Kittel (3e Aufl.) ad loc. 14 Wellhausen, Driver, et al.</page><page sequence="6">Principles Underlying the Greek Text 35 II In spite of what has been said, however, G can only seldom, and then only with caution, be used for textual criticism.15 This translator, as well as others which have been examined,16 betrays prejudices which must be understood before his text can be thus used. In spite of its literalism it remains a commentary on the Hebrew, and throughout the work slight differences between G and H show these tendencies. Particularly can this be seen in the large number of rationalizations, where G attempts to improve the narrative or in any event to render it consistent with itself. At 11:4 G corrected what seemed an obvious error. David sent messengers to take Bathsheba wtbw 9 'lyw, and he lay with her, according to H. G understood the verb in the sense of sexual relations, and changed it accordingly to k. eisēlthen pros aytěn. At v.9 H states that Uriah slept at the door . . . with all his master's servants. Since most of David's servants were on the battlefield, G felt this to be an erroneous statement, and hence failed to render kl . At 14:7 a widow is addressed by the clan and pressed to deliver up her fratricidal son "that we may also destroy hywrs." G rendered this by t . klēronomon ' ymõn . Why should the plural possessive pronoun be added in the Greek? Could this possibly reflect the tribal feeling of solidarity with respect to in- heritance laws, that one does not actually inherit merely from a parent but rather from the ancestral clan? A clear instance of G's rationalizing tendency appears in v. 10. David says to the woman: "Whoever speaks to you - do you bring him to me and he will no more Ig't bk" ; G changes this to 'apsasthai aytoy. After all, it was not the mother but the man- slaying son whose life was being threatened. In such instances the Greek can not be used for text criticism. There are numerous occasions where G felt that the text had to be corrected. At 15:17 H had the king wkl h'm going out. Since a large share of the people had already revolted, G changed it to k. pontes eoi paides aytoy . According to H of 15:22 Ittai the Gittite joined David's army together with all ' nsyw wkl htp. That on such a military expedition the little ones should accompany the soldiers seemed unreasonable to Facile emendation of MT is usually to be deplored, and further reflection often justifies our present text. A clear illustration of this is to be found at 15:8. The Kethib has 'm ysyb yšybny yhwh. The Qere emends yšyb to yãsôb, which is cer- tainly no improvement whatsoever. Kittel says: lege cum G Targ. et Syr. hãsêb . The versions are, however, no evidences on this point. Yãsêb is the Hiph. Inf. Abs. of a yaqtîl* stem, well-known in Phoenician; cf. Z. S. Harris, A Grammar of the Phoenician Language (Am. Or. Ser. 8; New Haven, 1936) 42ff. 16 Cf. notes 3 and 4 supra.</page><page sequence="7">36 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 15 G, and accordingly he interprets by 'oi paides aytoy k. pas 'o ochlos. The passage thereupon continues in the following v. of H "and all h'm were crossing over." Since the preceding clause stated that the king was also crossing, G felt the statement of H incomplete and added to 'o laos the phrase k. 'o basileys. According to 16:15 of H, Absalom and all h'm, the men of Israel, entered Jerusalem. Commentators cite G as evidence that h'm should be deleted. But this is not evidence at all, since G like Driver17 would reason that "all the people" were with David, and would leave it out of his translation even if it were in his Vorlage . In v.23 H praises Ahithophel's counsel which he counseled bymym hhm as being comparable to a divine oracle. His later counsel was, however, nullified by that of Hushai, and G accordingly sought to correct any possible false notion by means of his en t. 'ëmerais t . prõtais. At 18:6 G con- sidered H inconsistent: "So the people went out hśdh to meet Israel, and the battle was in the y'r of Ephraim." Either the battle was in a forest or in an open field - both could not be true; accordingly the words are both rendered by drymos. Mephibosheth is called the bn of Saul in 19:24(25) ; actually he was his grandson, since Jonathan, Saul's son, was his father. G must have had this in mind as appears from his 'yios 'yioy Saoyl. A similar correction of fact is evident at 20:2. Ac- cording to H all the ' ys ysr'l revolted against David; this G corrects to Israël . After all, it was not alone the army, but the northern group as a whole which took part in the uprising. Finally, at 23:8 G has 'oytos e s pasat o tin romphaian aytoy epi oktakosioys stratiõtas. The last word stands for hll in H. G reasoned that one does not fight "corpses" and hence changed it to "soldiers." Furthermore G often tries to avoid what he considers to be ambiguities. Somehow the translator felt that he must keep the record straight. When Shimei came out cursing and throwing stones (16:6) all the people and the mighty men were on his right hand wmsm'kv. This G expands to ex eyõnymõn t . hastieos . It was neither about Shimei nor about David that the people were gathered; it was appropriate that they should be between the two. In 19:10-12 H refers three times to the people's hesitancy Ihsyb 't hrnlk. In the first two instances G has toy epistrepsai pros t. basilea, whereas in the last case it was toy epistrepsai t. basilea eis t. oikon aytoy . Again this is not textual in origin. Before it was possible for the people to bring the king back ("to his house" is but an epexegetical addition in G) it was necessary that they return as loyal subjects to the 17 Notes on the Hebrew Text of the Books of Samuel (2d ed.; Oxford, 1913) ad loc.</page><page sequence="8">Principles Underlying the Greek Text 37 king. It is said by H at 20:16 that a wise woman called out from h'yr. More specifically she would have to be within speaking distance, and so G has her speaking from toy teichoys. At 21 :14 G thought that H was incomplete. David had ordered the bones of Saul, Jonathan and the seven Saulid hostages to be collected. This passage, however, merely states that "they buried the bones of Saul and of Jonathan his son," to which G adds k. t. exêliasmenõn tön . In the story of Solomon's accession some evidence of G's rationalizing tendency also occurs. In 1 :34 Sadok and Nathan had been told to anoint Solomon and thereupon to blow the trumpet. V.39 in H states that Sadok alone (as the priest this was appropriate) did the anointing, but the two of them blew the trumpet ( wytq'w ). G does not see the reason for the change in number, considers it inconsistent, and renders both verbs by the singular. In the following v. all the people celebrate by "piping with flutes" ( mhllym bhllym). G has k. echoreyon en chor ois (which would be literally equivalent to wmhllym bmhlt in Hebrew). In view of the rationalizing tendency of this translator is it necessary to assume so radically different a text? G probably felt that all the people piping flutes was too much of a good thing. Surely this would only be done by the official musicians, whereas the people would respond by engaging in the cultic dance. By playing with the roots hwl and hll it was possible to fix the text and at the same time correct an incongruity. At v.48 G thought H to be incomplete. David praises Yahweh "who today has given a ysb on my throne." Naturally there would be a successor; the point was that he should have been a dynastic successor. Accordingly G amplifies to ek. t . spermatos moy kathemenoii. Finally, at 2:4 David in his parting admonition to Solomon refers to an oracle "which he (Yahweh) spoke *ly" The oracle, however, was not concerning David at all, but about his seed. G solved the difficulty by not rendering the word in question. It will by now be evident that in spite of G's literalism there is a decided rationalizing tendency in his work. Such deviations have no textual basis whatsoever ; they can only be used to establish the translator's approach to his text. Ill Instructive also are the ways in which the translator deals with the various individuals who are present in the account. The hero of the entire section is David, but various lesser personalities also occur, and these will be dealt with first. Obviously G was intrigued by the Amnon-Tamar story in ch. 13, and</page><page sequence="9">38 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 15 his sympathies are with the wronged girl. Amnon's deception receives a somewhat different color in G. Amnon is so distressed with longing for his half-sister in v.2 "that he made himself sick" ( Ihthlwt ). G avoids any reflexive or middle sense by the simple rendering 'õste arrõstein. Similarly in v.6, Amnon laid down and made himself sick according to H, whereas G states that he was actually sick. In the preceding v. another verb is used to render the Hithp. of V hlh . Amnon s friend gives him counsel on wiles with which to catch Tamar, suggesting that he go to bed and "pretend illness" ( ht hi ). G renders this by mdakisthëti, "to act effeminate, weak, softlike." G shows where his sympathies lie, however, by incorporating in v. 15 a homiletic judgment (textually influenced by V.16) on Amnon's deed: meizõn 'e kakia 'e eschatë ē 'ē prõtê - in the middle of the statement that the hatred with which he (now) hated her was greater than the love with which he had (formerly) loved her. Deviations in G's account of Absalom's doings are inevitably to Ab- salom's discredit. In 13:32 Jonadab says to David: "Let not my lord think that all the king's sons have been killed ( hmytw )." G by using the singular ethanatõsen puts the blame on Absalom where it belongs. In 14:25 the judgment is made that like Absalom there was not an 'yš yph in all Israel so exceedingly praiseworthy. G merely has anēr, failing to render yph . Why should this be omitted unless it were to remove some- thing from Absalom's credit? In the account of the successful coup d'etat Absalom instructs his followers (15:10) to shout at the appropriate moment : mlk bšlwm. By a doublet on the first word G obtains bebasileyken basileys Abessalõm.18 This "error" only succeeds in making Absalom look a bit pompous and silly. At 16:21 Ahithophel counsels Absalom: "Go in to your father's concubines . . . and all Israel will notice that nb'st ' t ' byk (you have become odious with your father)." G, however, puts Absalom in a bad light by its kateschynas t. patera soy (as though the verb were hbyšwt). This seems to be intentional; certainly it has no textual basis. G's construction would be foolish advice, and this would be immediately apparent to any Semite. Dishonoring one's father was hardly the way to popularity in Israel. Finally, as though to emphasize his portrayal of Absalom, G makes the divine judgment on Absalom even more severe in the clause (17:14) "in order that Yahweh might bring on Absalom 't hr'h " by extending it to t. kaka panta. A minor character in Absalom's revolt was Ahithophel. It would appear from two instances in ch. 17 that G puts him in a bad light as 18 The word basileys is omitted by Mss. Abed o-u x z c » t» and the Coptic. This is, however, a later correction on the basis of H.</page><page sequence="10">Principles Underlying the Greek Text 39 well. In v.l Ahithophel advises Absalom: " 'bhrft ri 12,000 men, and I will arise and chase David immediately." G renders this by e pil ex õ dē emaytõ. By the addition of the dative it shows him as arrogating the whole business to himself; it thereby also makes Absalom's rejection of this counsel more plausible. The emaytõ has no textual basis whatsoever.19 At V.14 H states that Yahweh was determined to frustrate 't 'st 'hytpl htovbh. For two reasons this seemed unsatisfactory to G. Not only was this favorable to Ahithophel, but it meant that Yahweh could oppose that which was good. To void the difficulty G simply has t. boylên Acheitophel. Saul is only mentioned in this section in retrospect (ch. 21), but G's judgment on him is obvious. The Gibeonites refer to Saul as the man "who consumed us." (v.S). G has a plus: k. ediöxen ' ëmas , which con- stitutes a fuller statement of his evil conduct. In the following v. they ask for seven of Saul's descendants in order to hang them in Gibeah of Saul bhyr yhwh. The phrase in H undoubtedly must refer to Saul as "the chosen one of Yahweh." Neither the Gibeonites nor G would want to make such a reference, however, and so G rendered it by the plural, thereby making it refer to the seven men who were to be gibbetted. Joab is dealt with quite faithfully, though his will power, directness of speech and vengeful character are hinted at somewhat more strongly in G than in H. In 14:21 David gives in to Joab' s roundabout attempts at reconciliation between David and Absalom with the words ' syty yt hdbr hzh. Joab' s part in the matter is brought out in G's : epoiēsa soi kata ton logon soy toyton . This is also more in line with v.20a: "That the ap- pearance of this matter might assume this devious character - which your servant Joab affected." After Absalom was killed he was buried ig- nominiously : wyqhw . . . wyslykw . . . wysbw (18:17). G, however, makes the verbs singular throughout; i.e., Joab is himself made personally responsible for the deed. Joab's independence and willfulness is also brought out more clearly in 19:7(8) by some minor additions in his rebuke to David when he was mourning for his son, Absalom. Joab says: "If you do not go out sēmeron, no man will lodge with you tonight, k. epignõthi seaytõ that this will be worse for you than all the evil which has come on you. . . ." This certainly makes him a more forceful person. It is quite possible that G's failure to render the suffix of 'hy in 20:9 is intentional rewriting. Joab addresses Amasa with the words "(Are you 19 As Driver, op. cit., believes. He maintains that the "reflexive / is idiomatic with this verb. . . ." This may be perfectly true, but it is just as idiomatic to have a simple accusative. Seventeen exx. of the use of the simple accusative are listed in BDB under V bhr; cf. Qal, no. 5.</page><page sequence="11">40 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. IS well), my brother?" G merely has "brother," thereby making him out as rough and crude in speech. At all events, the change shows the direction of G's thought. The hero of this section is, however, David; in fact, it might well be entitled "The Loves and Wars of King David." That he is the hero for G as well is readily obvious. On the other hand, G leaves no doubt about his condemnation of David when he sinned. At 1 1 :22 H simply says: "And the messenger went out." To this G adds pros t . basüea eis Ieroysalêm. Why should there be the stress in G upon the king s presence in Jerusalem unless there were a condemnation of his not being on the battlefield where he belonged in the background? At 12:7 Nathan accuses David with the classic phrase: 'th h'ys; G pedantically adds to this fo poiēsas toyto so as to leave no doubt about the matter. This shows his own feeling that even great heroes of antiquity are not to be excused from right conduct. In the main, however, David is often by deft touches made out to be a bit more heroic than in H. At 14:8 David says: "7 h'šh" G's Vorlage was seemingly not clearly written since G has ' ygimnoysa (as though it were Islwmf). At all events, it was appropriate that the great David should tell his subject not to worry, that the matter rested safely in his hands. Furthermore in v. 13 a woman audaciously condemns David as being guilty in not bringing back his banished son. This was a bit too much for G; after all, how could a mere woman sit in judgment over David? To avoid this affront to his honor the clause is toned down by making it interrogative. The heroic ideal is also emphasized at 15:23. Throughout the account the verb V (br occurs a number of times. G rendered this consistently by the verb paraporeyesthai . In the case of the king's crossing, G uses the verb form diebię This is undoubtedly done with intent to set David apart from the people.20 The actions of David are not to be confused with those of ordinary people. Kittel's footnote :21 I.e. G b'nyy for b'wmy at 16:12 may well have no textual basis either, since G would much prefer to have Yahweh look on David's "humiliation" (en të tapeinösei) than on his "punishment for iniquity" (?). In other words, if G's Vorlage had b'wny as MT does, it is quite possible that he intentionally read it otherwise, thereby calling attention to another cross which the great hero had had to bear. Hushai's counsel to Absalom in 17:8a is also expanded to enhance David's prowess. It reads: "You know your father and his men that they are mighty men (to which 20 N.b. that G with nice feeling uses the aorist here, but the imperfect elsewhere. 21 Biblia Hebraica (3e Aufl.).</page><page sequence="12">Principles Underlying the Greek Text 41 G adds sphodra ) and . . . like a bear bereft in the field." G adds the phrase k. eõs eys tracheia en tõ pediõ (and like a savage wild boar in the plain). David and his warriors are indeed fierce opponents. A similar reason may have prompted the deviation at 21:15. In the war with Philistia H says wýp dwd. But it would hardly do for this heroic ideal to become weary in battle, and G changes it to an ambiguous k. exelythë Dayeid. It seems significant that so many instances which seem to be obvious misreadings should in each case enhance David. At 23:1 the word rim occurs twice ( rim dwd and rim hgbr). In both cases it is rendered by pistos (as though it were rimn). Immediately following hgbr occurs the modifying phrase hqm 7 (who was raised on high). G mis- understood 7 as the usual preposition and has ' on anestësen Kyrios epi (i christon theoy Iakõb). Is then christon to be understood as referring to the dynastic house ? Admittedly 23 :3 is a difficult passage to translate, and G can be excused for going wild textually. Nevertheless his paraphrase does show his exalted opinion of David: Parabolën eipon . En anthrõpõ põs krataiõsete phobon christoy; (I speak a parable: How can you strengthen the respect for the anointed one among men?). Even David's sufferings are more heroic in G. David confesses at 24:14 sr ly m'd. This is not enough for G who adds to its literal rendering of the clause the word pantothen. Furthermore David was a man of great piety. In David's instructions to Solomon at 2:3 he charged him with obedience to divine laws that he might be successful : 't kl 'šr ťsh w/t kl 'šr tpnh sm. David's part in this is not apparent from the text; this neglect G took care of by the free rendering: 'a poiëseis kata panta ' osa an enteUõmai soi . That David was a man of selfless spirit is emphasized by an addition in G within David's lament over Absalom at 18:33(19:1). To the clause "O that I might have died for thee" G adds ego anti soy. The meaning is clear without the addition, but it does bring out what David had in mind. Finally, at 16:10 there is a clear judgment on G's part concerning David's piety and sterling qualities. Shimei is railing against David, and Abishai suggests his forthright dispatch. David replies : "What have we in common, sons of Zeruiah?" To this G adds: k . aphete ayton (and let him be). David is in full command of the situation; he is a man of magnanimity and forgiving spirit, truly a heroic ideal of bygone years. In general, it may be said that this translator shows his high regard for royalty. When David's counsellors suggest to him at 1 :2 that a beautiful girl be chosen for the king's service, they say: "Let her stand before the king . . . and let her lie bhyqk." Direct speech on the part of commoners to a king is rude and court etiquette demands use only of</page><page sequence="13">42 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 15 third person. Accordingly G changes this to met aytoy . This innate respect for royalty is apparent at 21 :12. Reference is there made to the bones of Saul and Jonathan which the Philistines tlwm there. This word is paralleled in G by estësan aytoys. V 'I stèrni must have been chosen with intent to avoid reference to the ignominious manner in which the bodies of Saul and Jonathan were treated. Somewhat different is the treatment accorded Adonijah. In the struggle for succession he had lost out to Solomon. He feared for his life and demanded (1:51): "Let hmlk slmh swear to me that he will not kill. . . ." Later in v.53 it is said that he came in and did obeisance Imlk šlmh. In both instances G merely reproduces slmh. This may well have been an intentional omission to show that at heart Adonijah did not recognize his younger brother as king. This would also help to justify Solomon's later execution of Adonijah. IV There remains finally22 to discuss the theological position of the translator as this appears in his deviations from and mistranslations of H. First of all, a few instances occur with respect to God's worship. Yahweh was the god of the fathers, and this G wanted clearly under- stood. This appears from his addition of an aytõ to the statement that David entered Yahweh's sanctuary and worshipped ( 12 :20) . Conceivably David might have been worshipping some other god in Yahweh's house; this unlikely understanding of the passage is made impossible in G. Similar care is taken at 24 :22 to avoid any possible conclusion that David worshipped any god but Yahweh. Araunah offered his threshing-floor and his cattle to David for sacrificial use with the words: "Let my lord the king take and offer up whatever is good in his eyes." After the co- ordinate verbs G adds tö kyriõ . To G this was not picayunish pedantry ; rather this safeguarded the whole history of piety. Incidentally, at '.25 G mss. have a scholium which may well not be original to G, in which case it of course tells us nothing of this translator's approach. Concern- ing the altar built on Araunah's threshing-floor the statement is made: ké prosethëken Salõmõn epi to thysiastërion ep eschatõ 'oti mikron ën en prõtois. The assumption is made probably on the basis of 1 Chr 22 :lff . that this was the site on which Solómon's temple was later built. At 22:34 bad cultic connotations are avoided by failure to render a suffix. 22 Since the doublets occurring sporadically throughout the Greek text of this sec- tion constitute a somewhat involved textual problem which must be analyzed before the text can be used to indicate the work of this translator, they have not been included in this paper. In any event, they do not alter the conclusions here stated.</page><page sequence="14">Principles Underlying the Greek Text 43 H has the phrase: 7 bnvwty y'mydny. It is possible that the suffix on bmwt may earlier have represented yhwh. If that were the case in G's Vorlage there would have been even more reason for the Greek to omit it; G represents it by ta ' y psë. 28 Evidence of late Jewish thought also appears in G at 15:25. David says to Sadok: "If I shall find favor in Yahweh's eyes he will . . . show me it (i.e., the ark) and nwkw (its abode)." G renders this by t. eyprepeian ay tēs. Obviously G confused the two roots VV Since the temple had not yet been built, the ark had no permanent abode. Furthermore the theme of the beauty of the symbols of divine presence was a constantly recurring theme in post- exilic Judaism. As might be expected the translator emphasizes God's otherness. God and man are to be kept rigidly distant from one another, as e.g., in 24:14. H uses the singular yd for both Yahweh and for mankind. G, however, distinguishes between the two by a change in number: cheiri Kyrioy but cheiras anthrõpoy . By this device it is made clear not only that God is one and man is many, but that "hand" is not to be understood physically when applied to God. This same tendency to remove God as far as possible from mankind may be seen at 19:27(28). H refers to "my lord the king kml'k h'lhym " This comparison struck the translator as being much too direct, and he rendered it somewhat more innocuously by his epoiësen ton kalon enõpion 'õs aggelos toy theoy. It is clear that this has no textual basis in a Hebrew text at all; rather it represents the theological prejudices of G. The rather facile assumption that the rendering of 'p by orgë represents a true antianthropomorphism wherever it occurs is by no means assured. After all, it was a well-established meaning in such a phrase as wyhr 'p . . . (And the anger of . . . burned). At 22:9 this rendering is, however, a clear case. In describing the theophany H says: "Smoke went up b' puť; ' p certainly must here be understood literally as "nostril," just as pyw is to be understood literally as "his mouth" in the next line. G, never- theless, interprets this word by en të orgë aytoy.24 In this same chapter God is characterized as swfy (my rock) four times, as well as once in 23:3. Such a physical comparison for God was by all means to be avoided, and so phylax is used for swr at 22:3, 4 7bis, and 23:3. These are the only occurrences of this equation in the Greek Old Testament. At 22:32 the word is translated by ktisës. The translator felt that God's M Mss. M a b d-h 1 m-t w-z c« ei have ta 'ypsila. This is a secondary reading, it being due to the G reading in the parallel passage in Ps 18 :34. 24 The parallel passage in Ps 18 has the same interpretation. The antianthropo- morphism was a well-established one.</page><page sequence="15">44 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 15 uniqueness as God was his capacity as Creator, as a comparison with the parallel stich shows.25 The avoidance of the use of the divine name "Yahweh" in the late post-exilic age is a well-known phenomenon. This translator goes so far as to eliminate the name entirely when the context is clear without it. This is true both at 1:17 and at 2:3. Bathsheba says to David in the earlier passage : "You swore byhwh ' Ihyk G merely has en tõ theõ soy. Similarly at 2 :3 where David gives his final instructions to his successor : "Guard the service of yhwh thy god." Again G has the shorter text. At 1 :36 the divine name is also omitted by G. Benaiah says : "So be it ! So says yhwh the god of my lord the king." Yhwh is not represented at all by G. It is clear therefore that G avoids the divine name as much as possible. The character and work of God is also defended by G. At 14:14 the phrase: wV y s' ' Ihym nps (neither will God respect persons) occurs. G interpreted it as meaning "nor will God take up life." This might mean that God is not the lord of life and death, which was theologically offensive to G. Accordingly the negative was left out, resulting in : k. lêmpsetai (o theos psychen .26 The v. continues in H with whsb mhsbt Iblty ydh mmnw ndh (and let him devise means so as not to banish from him, him that is banished). Since the negative had been removed from the preceding phrase, G felt it necessary to repeat the procedure here: k. logizomenos (that is, God) toy exõsai ap aytoy exeõsmenon. Hereby God's sovereignty over the affairs of men is upheld. At 22:48 kyrios is added to avoid any possible misunderstanding that vengeance belongs to Yahweh. H has h'l hntn nqmt ly . This G interprets as ischyros kyrios 'o didoys ekdikëseis moi . Admittedly 23 :4 is a difficult text as it stands in H : wk'wr bqr yzrh sms bqr l' ebwt mngh mmtr d ? m'rs . It is clear, however, that it can not possibly mean what G made of it: k. en theõ (representing the last word in v.3) phõti prõias anateilai 'ēlios to pröi oy kyrios parëlthen (' bwt as 'br?) ek pheggoys k. 'õs ex 'yetoy chloēs apo gês . It is obvious that G wants to put God into the picture somehow. It may have been too much for G to keep the comparison to the king's good reign, even though that king was the great David, and accordingly G paraphrased the material. It might be appropriate to con- 25 The Targum throughout used taqqîpâ or teqõp, which shows the same anti- anthropomorphic tendency. 26 It is true that Mss. M N a g i j (in text) n u v a» b* the Armenian and the Coptic have the negative, but this is a later correction on the basis of H. That G had trouble with it is also borne out by the Lucianic text (Mss. b o c&gt; e&gt; and Theodoret) which has k. oyk elpizet ep ayto psyché .</page><page sequence="16">Principles Underlying the Greek Text 45 elude this discussion of G's theological bent of mind by citing his addition of a word at 24:14, since it is quite characteristic of his work. H says of Yahweh that his mercies are numerous. G could not possibly have any objections to this pious statement; in fact, he maintains that they are exceedingly ( sphodra ) numerous indeed. Before concluding this paper, the following systematic summary of the investigation is given. 1. The most striking characteristic of this translator was his mechanical literalness, almost Aquilanic in character. 2. A paucity of transliterations. 3. The translator does feel free to add color of his own to an in- teresting story. 4. The usual epexegetical additions having little or no significance are to be found throughout the section. 5. The occasional superiority of G when MT was the product of copyist errors due to palaeographic considerations. 6. A discovery incidental to the paper is the fact that stylistic and exegetical characteristics demonstrate that although this section has many affinities with the last section of the Books of the Kingdoms (3 Kgs 22 :l-4 Kgs 25 :30), its translator is not that of this section. 7. Particularly to be noted are the large number of rationalizations and harmonizations to be found. 8. There is also a somewhat different emphasis to be found in G's treatment of individuals. Particularly is this apparent in the royal ideal, David, who, although he is roundly condemned for his sins, is nevertheless presented in an exaggerated heroic style. Those who did not conform to David's best interests are usually placed in a worse light as e.g., Ahithophel, Saul and Absalom. 9. The translator's theological position is in line with the thought of later Judaism. The development seems to be somewhat more pro- nounced than in the next two sections, and this may well mean that this section was translated later. John Wm.
