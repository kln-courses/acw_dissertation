The final cause is an especially controversial yet crucial issue in causal virtue theory. Aquinas explains the overall agenda in theological ethics  in final-c ausal terms: “In the first place we must consider the ultimate end of  human life, and then those things by which a human can advance towards  this end, or deviate from it. For the rationale of what is ordained to the  end must be taken from the end” (I.II 1pr).1 Aquinas’s ethics, therefore, pre- suppose a naturally and indeed supernaturally given end to human life and  that the actions and virtues by which we advance toward that end are con- ceived teleologically. The modern scientific worldview, in contrast, is often  understood to be incompatible with a cosmology of natural and supernatural  finality. In the modern era, final causes were expunged from physical science  as having no explanatory value, and in the one kind of scientific endeavor  where teleology remained plausible—biological science—Charles Darwin’s  theory of evolution offered an alternative account of the genesis of com- plex life forms, thereby apparently eliminating the need for appeal to final  causes. Today philosophers often assume that teleological talk must either be  eliminated or interpreted in terms of efficient causes. Can the kind of causal  approach to ethics and virtue theory found in Aquinas, one that takes final  causality seriously, be sustained today? extrinsiC finAlity Margaret Osler has argued that while many of the early modern figures such  as Francis Bacon and René Descartes did make a point of explicitly rejecting  final- causal explanation in scientific investigation, their rejection of teleology  92 </page> <page sequence="2">  end And Agent  •  93 was not done as wholesalely as is generally thought.2 Even those who rejected  teleological explanation in scientific and philosophical argument struggled to  do without it altogether. More important, many key figures, such as Pierre  Gassendi, Robert Boyle, Gottfried Leibniz, and Isaac Newton, retained some  kind of appeal to final causation in their theories of natural philosophy. Final  causality was not eliminated as such, only the final causality immanent to the  natural world. A confirmation of this historical interpretation is found in the tendency  of seventeenth-c entury philosophers to compare the cosmos to a machine,  usually a clock or watch. A watch, though made of pieces of inert matter with  no inherent purposes of their own, nevertheless possesses a function deriving  from the mind that made it. Notwithstanding their skepticism about imma- nent finality, the mechanistic philosophers saw the natural world as possess- ing a kind of extrinsic teleology derived from the creator. As Osler explains,  “With the mechanical reinterpretation of final causes, the idea of individual  natures that possess immanent finality was replaced with the idea of nature  as a whole which is the product of the divine artificer. Nature becomes a  work of art.”3 The design argument for God’s existence, as advanced most  famously by William Paley, is therefore a modern one. Just as the complex  ordering of an artifact to a single function is evidence of the artisan, so the  complexity of living beings is evidence of the divine artificer. This argument  is the ancestor of intelligent design theory, which argues that the “irreduc- ible” or “specified” complexity of the world indicates an ordering by a divine  intelligence.4 Once this move has been made, it is difficult to find a way back. The elim- ination of immanent final causation, while not initially meant to deny divine  teleology, opens the door to wholesale skepticism about final causes. Any infer- ence to a divine intelligence as the best explanation of complexity in the uni- verse is always vulnerable to the possibility of a still more-s uccessful scientific  explanation. For many this is precisely what Darwin provides. Adaptation and  evolution do not occur in order to produce organisms better-s uited to their  environment. Rather, of the different traits that arise in individuals through  variation, those more suited to survival and reproductive success tend to be  inherited. Evolution by natural selection is an efficient- causal, not a final- causal  process. As Richard Dawkins puts it, “If [natural selection] can be said to play  the role of watchmaker in nature, it is the blind watchmaker.”5 Intelligent design theorists infer the existence of a divine watchmaker;  Dawkins asserts that evolution is a blind watchmaker; for Aquinas there is  no watchmaker, blind or otherwise. As Christopher Martin comments, “In the  eight million words Thomas Aquinas definitely wrote, and the three million  words he may have written besides, the universe is never compared to a clock.”6 </page> <page sequence="3"> 94  •  chApter 6 intrinsiC finAlity Modern thinkers tend to acknowledge (at most) two kinds of finality: rational  finality and design. Rational finality is the intrinsic finality exhibited by ratio- nal agents that are capable of freely aiming at goals; design is a purely extrinsic  finality, such as that exhibited by artifacts. The advantage of this dualism is  that one can be explained in terms of the other: the extrinsic finality of a clock  or a computer is something imposed on inert matter by a purposive mind. In the following passage from On Truth, Aquinas seems to propose a sim- ilar dualism: “Something may be ordered or directed to something, as to an  end, in two ways: in one way, by itself, as a human being who directs himself  to the place to which he tends; in another way, by another, as an arrow that  is directed by the archer to a determinate place” (emphasis added).7 However,  Aquinas subdivides the finality that comes from a directing intelligence into  two species, one of which is purely extrinsic or “violent,” and one which is not: Sometimes that which is directed into an end is only impelled and moved by the  director, without acquiring any form from the director by which such a direc- tion or inclination belongs to it; and such an inclination, as when an arrow is  inclined by the archer to a determinate mark, is “violent.” Sometimes, however,  what is directed or inclined into an end acquires from the director or mover some  form by which such an inclination belongs to it; and such an inclination will be  “natural,” as having a natural principle, just as he who gave gravity to the stone  inclined it to be borne down naturally. . . . It is in this way that all natural beings  are inclined to what is fitting for them, having in themselves some principle of  inclination, by reason of which their inclination is natural, so that in a way they  go about their own way to their due ends, and are not merely led.8  Here, then, is where Aquinas differs from the early moderns: he sees the basis  for the final causality of natural beings in the formal causality of nature. It is  because of what they are—that is, because of their substantial forms—that nat- ural beings have a directedness toward an end. Natural finality is intrinsic, not  extrinsic. As the Aristotelian maxim has it, “Nature acts for an end.”9 If Aquinas sees finality as intrinsic to nature, how can he argue from natu- ral finality to the existence of God, as he does in the famous Fifth Way (I 2.3)?  Edward Feser has pointed out that this teleological argument is not a design  argument as some would have it. Aquinas’s argument starts by establishing  the existence of finality on the basis that natural bodies always act, or nearly  always act (unless prevented from doing so by some defect or intervening  circumstance), in a certain way so as to obtain the best result. Feser makes  the observation, which is obvious once made but otherwise easily missed,  </page> <page sequence="4">  end And Agent  •  95 that “Aquinas is not referring here to an intelligent designer; he does not get  to God until the second half of the argument.”10 Finality is established on  the basis of how things tend to behave, and an argument still has to be made  for the existence of a divine intelligence responsible for this already estab- lished intrinsic finality. Aquinas’s argument for God proceeds from finality,  not to finality. While the universe for Aquinas is not like a clock with its purely extrinsic  finality, Aquinas does draw an important analogy between created beings and  artifacts. In one of his most important characterizations of nature he states:  “And so it is clear that nature is nothing other than the rationale of a certain  art, namely, the divine art, instilled in things, by which the things themselves  are moved to a determined end, just as if a shipbuilder were to be able to  bestow on the timbers that by which they could move themselves to take on  the form of a ship.”11 Natural telic activity for Aquinas arises from an internal  source (principio intrinseco), which itself is derived from an external source  (principio extrinseco) (cf. I 104.5). Where Aristotle sees a purely intrinsic prin- ciple, Aquinas goes further and traces the origin of this intrinsic principle back  to God’s intelligence and power. The recovery of this kind of cosmology of immanent finality is attractive  to theological ethics in part because of its ability to address certain mod- ern problematics. On the “divine watchmaker” viewpoint, the divine will is  purely extrinsic and heteronomous, and we risk reducing God to a manip- ulator who uses humans for His own purposes. Nature, lacking any intrin- sic finality, becomes devoid of its own intrinsic moral status and is therefore  open to human domination. Immanent finality, in contrast, opens up the pos- sibility of reconciling human autonomy with divine heteronomy, as the moral  life fulfills God’s wise plan precisely by fulfilling human desires instilled into  human nature. A nature invested with finality is also one with meaning and  its own good and therefore not lacking any moral status of its own, as “Green  Thomism” contends.12 If we are in search of a moral basis on which to resist  attributing to God the instrumentalization of humanity and a simultaneous  instrumentalization of nature by humanity, the recovery of immanent final  causation may well be a good place to begin. Immanent teleology is attractive to more than theologians alone. Philippa  Foot, for example, begins with the “natural goodness” of living beings, which  is distinguished from any goodness they possess merely in reference to human  concerns. In her view this natural goodness has to do with what serves the  natural teleology of the species to which an individual belongs, although she is  careful to distinguish this teleology from conscious purpose, whether of living  beings or some creator deity. If living beings have a natural goodness, then  moral goodness can be understood in terms of the natural goodness specific to  </page> <page sequence="5"> 96  •  chApter 6 the human species.13 How tenable is it, though, to see nature, including human  nature, as permeated by natural finality?  Assessing intrinsiC finAlity Immanent finality is controversial. It is seen by its opponents as unscientific  and as a projection of mental qualities onto mere things, and as a philosophical  concept its problems involve an ontologically mysterious backward causation.  Let us briefly examine these three problems in turn. The main scientific challenge to immanent teleology comes from evolution- ary theory. Darwin’s theory of natural selection is widely interpreted as doing  away with the need for design or final- causal explanation. According to Dar- win, evolution by natural selection occurs when there is variation in a species  that fits individuals better or worse for surviving and reproducing, together  with the possibility of inheriting such variable traits. The origin of the different  species, then, is accounted for not by the direct intervention of a deity but by  a purely natural process.14 Since natural selection is an entirely nonteleological  process that accounts for the apparent teleology of the evolution of a species’  traits, it is often inferred that natural selection does away with the need to posit  immanent teleology or a divine creator. From a Thomistic perspective, there is little problem in seeing evolution as  having natural causes. For Aquinas, God gives creatures causal powers and  endows them with the dignity of being agents in their own right: the divine  primary causality operates, therefore, through creatures’ secondary causality  without bypassing it (I 105.5 ad 1). As Armand Maurer points out, Darwin  himself, at points in his career, appealed to the idea of secondary causation  as an alternative to the view that God creates individual species by a singular  intervention.15 Furthermore, while the rejection of final- causal explanation in  the generation of the species seems incompatible with a William Paley design  argument, it is less clear that Darwinian natural selection is incompatible with  immanent teleology.16 Many philosophers of biology do see teleological concepts as an inelim- inable part of biological explanation. As Ernst Mayr points out, biologists  frequently employ teleological language to talk about organs’ functions, physi- ological processes, and the behavior of individuals and species; they often insist  that “they would lose a great deal, methodologically and heuristically, if they  were prevented from using such language.”17 On this basis, Thomists such as  Jean Porter have argued that Aquinas’s “teleological conception of the human  person” remains defensible as a grounding for ethics. Porter argues that even  to conceive of a particular kind of creature it is necessary to form a conception  </page> <page sequence="6">  end And Agent  •  97 of the way of life proper to a mature instance of that kind. She shows that this  viewpoint receives support from scientists and philosophers who, independent  of particular moral or theological concerns, take a stance on teleology that  differs from that of Dawkins.18 While the philosophical interpretation of tele- ological language within the biological sciences remains contested, it is at least  plausible to reject as too hasty the widespread assumption that the Darwinian  theory of evolution, and its contemporary inheritors, has ruled out immanent  teleology as inherently unscientific. There are other objections to final causality, however. Is Aquinas’s idea of  intrinsic finality not an anthropomorphic projection of mental qualities onto  nonrational and even nonconscious beings? One should not be misled by Aquinas’s language. Terms such as appetite  (appetitus) and intention (intentio) in their common English translations,  “appetite,” “desire,” and “intention,” convey consciousness. Aquinas, however,  adopts a very general definition of both. An appetite is simply an inclination  toward something on the part of its bearer (I.II 81.1c); to intend is nothing  other than to tend toward something (I.II 12.5 arg 3). Aquinas claims that all  natural things manifest appetite or intention in the sense of directedness or  inclination toward some goal; he is not thereby attributing some conscious  end to them.19 Paul Hoffman distinguishes in Aquinas a “full-b odied notion of  final causation” from a “stripped-d own understanding.”20 The former is appli- cable to rational agents, whereas the latter extends to all natural beings. While  the deliberate, self- directive agency of humans requires acting for something  viewed as a good, finality in nonrational and even inanimate beings requires  merely tending to a certain effect. Aquinas does not project the kind of finality  characteristic of human agency onto natural beings. More can be said against the accusation of anthropomorphism, however.  Aquinas understands himself not to be attempting to understand nature in  terms of human consciousness but rather the opposite: rational agency is seen  as a special case of a more general phenomenon of telic agency. As Robert  Pasnau explains: “Rather than attribute to human beings an obscure voli- tional power, and leave it at that, Aquinas wants to account for the will in  terms of concepts that play a familiar role elsewhere. In the case of the will,  as in so much else, it is important to Aquinas that he situate his theory within  a broader account of the workings of nature.”21 When Aquinas writes of  a natural inclination of the will (naturalis inclinatio voluntatis) toward the  good (I 1.8 ad 2), natural philosophy is being used to throw light on human  psychology, not vice versa. This approach is more scientifically respectable than one that views teleol- ogy as a projection of the human mind. As Robert Spaemann notes, the rejec- tion of natural teleology “allows the dimension of finality in man to suddenly,  </page> <page sequence="7"> 98  •  chApter 6 so to speak, appear, and it excludes man from the natural context.”22 Simon  Oliver makes a similar point: “Ascribing teleological orientation to human  intentionality—in other words, to mind—presents a particular problem [for  the naturalist] for it renders ‘mind’ or ‘consciousness’ anomalous in the face  of an otherwise inert and non-t eleological material universe.”23 It would be  odd were the naturalist to claim that teleology springs ex nihilo with the evo- lutionary emergence of humankind. The Thomistic claim of immanent finality,  according to which human intentionality is a specific and developed instance  of a more generally observable phenomenon in nature, is therefore more con- ducive to modern scientific assumptions than the supposedly naturalistic view- points that see natural finality as the projection of human attributes onto a  purposeless natural world. A more radical philosophical objection to final causation sees the very con- cept of finality as incoherent. How can the end of an action, which by defini- tion does not exist before the agent acts, move it to act? It seems odd to ascribe  causation to possible future existents, which may or may not come to be. Aquinas recognizes this problem of backward causation: “A cause is natu- rally prior [to the effect]. But the end has the rationale of last, as its very name  implies” (I.II 1.1 arg 1).24 He resolves the problem by making a distinction:  “The end, even though last in execution, is nevertheless first in the intention of  the agent. And in this latter way it has the rationale of cause” (ad 1).25 A child  wants to build a model helicopter and sets about doing so. After much labor  she completes her task. But the end as it exists at the temporal end point of the  process is not a cause of the child’s action; it is its effect. The helicopter that  rests in all its glory on the bedroom floor is the result of intentional action, not  its principle. The final cause of the child’s hard work is not the end as a future  real existent but the end as the object of desire and thought, which as such  temporally preexists the helicopter. There is no backward causation. teleologiCAl ethiCs How does the final- causal viewpoint affect ethics? As we have seen, for Aquinas  it is from the final cause that the causality of all the other causes derives: “The  final cause is the first among all the causes” (I.II 1.2).26 Correspondingly, the  idea of the finis or end of human life is the primary, if not the solitary, organizing  principle of Aquinas’s moral thought: right action, the virtues, and the law all  derive their nature from order to the end. As he says, “The principle of the entire  moral order is the last end” (I.II 72.5).27 Without its orientation to the overall  end of human life, Aquinas’s ethics would collapse like a decorative mobile that  has come loose from its hook and fallen in a tangled heap on the floor. </page> <page sequence="8">  end And Agent  •  99 To say that Aquinas’s ethics is teleological can leave it open to misinterpre- tation because of an unfortunate tendency to conflate “teleological” and “con- sequentialist” ethics. Aquinas’s ethics is teleological in that morality concerns  the ordering of actions to the overall end of human life. “Good and evil [in  moral acts and habits] are said in relation to the end.”28 However, this ethics is  not consequentialist, since it does not locate morality in the value of the overall  effects of an action. A foreseen consequence affects the morality of an action  primarily because it is a sign of the goodness or badness of the will: the “input”  of an action is therefore more important, morally speaking, than its “output”  (I.II 20.5, 73.8).29 If the effect does not specify an action, what is left of Aquinas’s thesis that an  action is specified by the end or terminus of an action (1.3)? As we saw above  (see chap. 5), an action’s effect is the beneficiary, rather than the benefactor,  of existence and nature, so it cannot be the cause of the act’s species. Poinsot  explains, however, that the end or terminus of an action can indeed specify an  action, not as its effect but only insofar as it “clothes itself in the rationale of  cause, or principle, or object.” “For the terminus to specify an action, it must be  considered, not as executively proceeding from the action, but as contained in  the causative power and principle of the action: for there the terminus is itself  contained virtually and radically, and as in the principle; and thence, primarily  and immediately, the action takes its species.”30 As Aquinas himself puts it,  “The end, insofar as it is prior in intention, in this respect pertains to the will;  and in this way it gives species to a human act” (I.II 1.3 ad 2).31 Aquinas’s ethics is teleological in the legitimate, nonconsequentialist sense  that sees the final cause of human life as the governing principle of the moral  order. The moral goodness and badness of acts are therefore defined in terms of  their due or undue relation to this end: “In morals, where what matters is the  order of reason to the overall end of human life, sin and evil are understood in  terms of deviation from the order of reason to the overall end of human life”  (21.2 ad 2).32 The same can be said for habits: “True unqualified virtue is that  which orders to the principal good of the human being” (II.II 23.7).33 teliC AgenCy A final- causal approach also affects the understanding of agency and therefore,  once again, has ramifications for ethics. The dominant theory of agency is what  is termed the “causal” theory, which analyzes intentional action in terms of the  efficient causality of internal psychological states, such as desires and beliefs.  The best- known proponent of this account is Donald Davidson, according to  whom “an action is performed with a certain intention if it is caused in the  </page> <page sequence="9"> 100  •  chApter 6 right way by attitudes and beliefs that rationalize it.”34 One problem of this  reduction of intentional agency to the efficient causality of psychological states  is that of the vanishing of the agent: actions, on the efficient-c ausal viewpoint,  seem to be events that happen to us rather than things we actively do our- selves.35 As Stefaan E. Cuypers has proposed, Aquinas can be seen as offer- ing an account that is simultaneously “agent- causal” and teleological and is  therefore an attractive alternative to the causal theory; it is more successful in  accounting for what it means to act actively.36 Aquinas holds a teleological theory of agency: to act is to act for some end  (I.II 1.2c). However, he contrasts the way humans and nonrational animals  tend to the end: “It is characteristic of a rational nature that it tend into the  end as acting, or as leading oneself to the end; whereas it is characteristic of  irrational nature to tend into the end as acted or led by another” (1.2c, empha- sis added).37 The telic nature of active agency comes out in a contrast between  animal and human agency. The agency of nonrational animals is a mixture of  agency and passivity. A robin does act when it builds a nest to shelter its young,  but it does not actively choose this end over another. The agency of humans, in  contrast, is more purely active: humans act for an end and actively choose the  end(s) for which they act. Whereas animals tend to the end “as acted,” humans  tend to the end “as acting.” For Aquinas the scale of agency goes from the minimal agency of plants  through growth to the perfect agency of God, whose activity involves no pas- sivity at all (I 18.3c). Once again, teleology is the key. On this scale, animals  are more perfectly agents than plants because they can move toward objects  perceived by the senses—that is, by pursuing food, or a mate, or escape from  enemies. However, the ends of their actions are not determined by the animals  themselves, but by nature: a sheep cannot choose to befriend a wolf instead of  fleeing it. For humans, it is different: “Above such [non- rational] animals are  those that move themselves even in regard to the end, which they determine  in advance for themselves. This only happens by reason and intellect, which  knows the proportion of the end and of what is for the end, and to order the  one in regard to the other” (18.3c, emphasis added).38 One might put it this  way: animals are self- moving, but only humans are self- directing and able to  choose the end for which they act. What is the root of the difference between merely animal and self- directive  human agency? Aquinas says, “Those beings that lack reason tend to the end by  a natural inclination, as if moved by another, and not by themselves, since they  do not think about the rationale of the end, and therefore cannot order any- thing to the end, but only are ordered by another to the end” (I.II 1.2c).39 The  difference between nonrational and human agents, then, lies in the fact that,  “whatever a human being desires, he desires under the rationale of the good”  </page> <page sequence="10">  end And Agent  •  101 (1.6c).40 Humans, because of their capacity for reason, can evaluate different  potential goals and choose to direct themselves to one or other accordingly. This conception of human agency as truly active because self-d irective is  equally evident in Aquinas’s analysis of deliberation. Aquinas accepts the Aris- totelian thesis that deliberation is always about the means, or “those things that  are for the sake of the end,” rather than about the end itself (14.2). Delibera- tion has to begin from an end that is already “given” and proceed to determine  how best to realize that end: if an agent did not already have some end in mind,  there would be no start to the process of reasoning. Yet Aquinas does neverthe- less claim that there can be deliberation about the end: “Having apprehended  the end, someone can, deliberating about the end and about the means, be  moved or not be moved to the end” (6.2c).41 What does Aquinas mean, then,  by “deliberating about the end”? There are at least two ways in which means-e nd reasoning takes place: one  is about what would constitute a given end, and one is about what steps need  to be taken to realize that end. Take the example of someone wanting to have  an enjoyable day of leisure. The primary question here is what would consti- tute such a day: would it be hiking a mountain, or meeting friends, or read- ing a book, or some combination of these? Once this prior question has been  answered, it is possible to determine the steps that need to be taken (pack a  rucksack or take a certain train). Both processes are examples of means- end  reasoning, but the first step concerns what constitutes the end to be achieved,  while the second concerns the actions that can realize that end. It is reasonable to think that, when Aquinas says that we can deliberate  about ends as well as means, he means that we can deliberate about what con- stitutes some end.42 Poinsot puts it in the following way. Admittedly, one may  not deliberate about the end formally speaking, since there is no doubt, and  therefore no deliberation, that the good in general is to be desired and willed.  Yet it is possible to deliberate about the end materially speaking—that is, about  what happens to constitute the end: “Thus all desire to live happily, but many  doubt about where that happiness may be found: whether in riches, or in plea- sure, or in God. And many desire to establish life rightly, but whether that life  is to be chosen in celibacy or marriage, or in studies, or in the military, is the  subject of deliberation.”43 The chosen constitutive means to happiness then,  whether it be wealth, honor, pleasure, or knowing and loving God, may in turn  become the organizing goal of one’s life. Aquinas’s teleological account of human agency as self-d irective and delib- erate helpfully sets morality within an overall teleological context. Moral theo- logians today rightly critique the old moral manuals for focusing exclusively on  acts in an atomistic way—that is, divorced from a broader context of a person’s  orientation toward the overall goal of human life.44 One of the contributions  </page> <page sequence="11"> 102  •  chApter 6 of the return to virtue has been to set human actions within this narrative  context rather than focusing exclusively on the “freeze frame” of a specific  action. Aquinas avoids the trap of the atomistic approach precisely because of  his teleological vision of agency. The moral manuals invariably begin with a  treatment of human action and omit the Treatise on Beatitude, whereas Aqui- nas situates his definition of human action within a consideration of the overall  end of human life (I.II 1–5). His account of human agency is teleological from  the beginning, in seeing that human action is the motor of the journey of the  dynamic imago Dei toward God. For him, truly human moral agency flows  from deliberation about ends, as well as how best to realize those ends. Ethics  must therefore begin not with the question of what to do but with the deeper  final- causal question of what ends are worth pursuing in the first place. Assessing CAusAl ethiCs A full- scale evaluation of Aquinas theory of causation, one that engages con- temporary science, philosophy of science, and metaphysics, is beyond the pro- fessional competency of the ethicist. Yet at the same time it is not possible for  the ethicist to ignore these questions altogether. It has been rightly observed  that, for Aquinas, “there is no fundamental separation between metaphysics  and ethics.”45 Causal concepts such as those of exemplar, object, end, and agent  all have significant contributions to Aquinas’s ethics. My aim has been to make  these ideas intelligible today and to indicate their potential contribution to  contemporary theological and philosophical ethics. Alfred J. Freddoso and Edward Feser have boldly argued that Thomistic  and scholastic theories of causation stand up well in relation to alternative  accounts.46 A less defensive and more dialogical approach is also possible. As  observed above, the diversity of theories of causation “can lead one to sus- pect that no univocal analysis of the concept of causation is possible.”47 One  strength of Aquinas’s theory is that it is not a univocal, reductionistic account,  and so it is able dialectically to acknowledge the insights of different perspec- tives. Aquinas’s account has something in common with pluralistic accounts, as  it recognizes more than one form of causation; it also resembles “primitivist”  accounts in some way because it recognizes causation as a basic concept that,  while to some extent is analyzable, nevertheless resists strict definition. Michael  Rota has argued that Aquinas’s account of efficient causation has much in com- mon with contemporary “dispositional” accounts. Gabriele De Anna argues  that the four causes can be seen as at least INUS conditions; he thereby draws  connections with J. L. Mackie’s analysis of causation.48 Michael Dodds identi- fies “burgeoning expansion of the idea of causality in contemporary science”  </page> <page sequence="12">  end And Agent  •  103 as conducive to Thomistic understandings.49 We should not expect the dialogue  between Aquinas and contemporary theories of causation to leave Thomis- tic understandings unchanged, but it is a strength that Aquinas’s analogically  nuanced account is open to dialogue on these and many other fronts. Finally, it is worth returning to the initial consideration: the four causes are  simply four ways of answering the question, “Why?” A cause, for Aquinas, is  some principle in virtue of which something can be understood or explained.  The explanatory framework of the four causes opens up a number of interre- lated, promising lines of investigation into the nature of virtue. To Aquinas’s  causal inquiry into virtue, therefore, we now turn. notes  1.

Aliquando autem id quod dirigitur vel inclinatur in finem,  consequitur a dirigente vel movente aliquam formam per quam sibi talis inclinatio com- petat: unde et talis inclinatio erit naturalis, quasi habens principium naturale; sicut ille  qui dedit lapidi gravitatem, inclinavit ipsum ad hoc quod deorsum naturaliter ferretur;  </page> <page sequence="13"> 104  •  chApter 6 per quem modum generans est motor in gravibus et levibus, secundum philosophum in  Lib.

Et per hunc modum omnes res naturales, in ea quae eis conveniunt,  sunt inclinata, habentia in seipsis aliquod inclinationis principium, ratione cuius eorum  inclinatio naturalis est, ita ut quodammodo ipsa vadant, et non solum ducantur in fines  debitos.”  9.

I.II 1.2c: “Illa vero quae ratione carent, tendunt in finem per naturalem inclina- tionem, quasi ab alio mota, non autem a seipsis, cum non cognoscant rationem finis, et  ideo nihil in finem ordinare possunt, sed solum in finem ab alio ordinantur.”  40. 1.6c: “quidquid homo appetit, appetit sub ratione boni.”  41. 6.2c: “apprehenso fine, aliquis potest, deliberans de fine et de his quae sunt ad  finem, moveri in finem vel non moveri.”  42.
