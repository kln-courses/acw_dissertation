<plain_text><page sequence="1">Knowledge of the writings of John Cassian in early Anglo-Saxon England STEPHEN LAKE The writings of John Cassian (c. 370- c. 435) circulated widely through the Middle Ages, not least in Anglo-Saxon England. They are commonly assumed by scholar^ to have been fundamental to the formation of western monasti- cism,1 yet it is worth examining the nature and extent of their usage a little more closely. The following discussion considers this usage in Anglo-Latin sources between the later seventh century and the mid-eighth. Cassian was probably born in the Dobroudja region in Scythia.2 At a young age, he entered a monastic community in Bethlehem with his older friend, Germanus. After about three years there, the pair travelled to Egypt where they remained for approximately the next fifteen years. They probably left Egypt in 399, in the company of around 300 other Origenist monks escaping from the Anthropomorphic controversy provoked by Theophilus, archbishop of Alexandria. These monks went first to Palestine, and some, including Germanus and Cassian, eventually went on to Constantinople to appeal to the patriarch, John Chrysostom, for protection. Germanus and Cassian were ordained into Chrysostom's clergy and served in this capacity until Chrysostom's final fall in 404. It bears noting that during this period, Germanus was a more prominent figure than Cassian: whereas Cassian was ordained to the diaconate, Germanus was ordained to the priesthood, and served as one of Chrysostom's representatives both at the Synod of the Oak (403) and (together with Cassian and several bishops) in an embassy to Rome.3 Cassian's movements during the next ten years are unknown, though it is pos- sible that he passed this time as a priest in Antioch. Around 415, he arrived in Marseille where, a few years later, he is credited with founding two monastic 1 See, for example, A. de Vogüé, ťLes mentions des œuvres de Cassien chez saint Benoît et ses contemporains', Studia Monastica 20 (1978), 275-85, at 285. 2 Following H.-I.

Cassian is commonly sup- posed to have died c. 435. THE WRITINGS OF CASSIAN The De insńtutis is divided into twelve books. The first four consist of accounts of the dress of the Egyptian monks and of their observance of the daily prayers, and a collection of provisions about the organization of a monastic community. The remaining eight books discuss the eight principal vices which the monk encounters in his vocation. Bks I- IV were sometimes used in the composition of early continental monastic rules or adapted as a rule them- selves.6 Yet, while many early medieval writers were interested in the paradigm of the eight principal vices, they tended to use Cassian's Conlańo V, and often display no knowledge of his more extensive treatment of the subject in De insńtuńs bks V- XII and elsewhere in the Conlationes ? 4 Gennadius, De viris illustribus c. lxii Ç Hieronymus liber de viris inlustribus - Gennadius liber de viris inlustribus , ed.

Levison, MGH, SRM 1 (Hanover, 1951), 523), are probably general references to Cassian, even where the word 'regula' is used, while two versions of an actual Regula Cassiani are known from a later period: extracts from one version of forty-three paragraphs are included in Benedict of Aniane's Concordia regularum ( Benedicti Anianensis Concordia regularum , ed. P. Bonnerue, CCCM 168- 168A (Turnhout, 1999)); H. Plenkers, Untersuchungen %ur Über- lieferungsgeschichte der ältesten lateinischen Mönchsregeln (Munich, 1906), pp. 70-84.

The dates of the original composition of these two 'rules' are not known. 7 From the example of Eutropius, a sixth-century bishop of Valencia, it is evident that Conlatio V could be extracted and used independently of the remainder of his writings.

The possible use 28</page><page sequence="3">Knowledge of the writings of John Cassian The Conlationes were published in three parts: bks I- X, XI- XVII and XVIII- XXIV. Each of the twenty-four 'conversations' ostensibly records a discussion between an experienced abba, and Germanus and Cassian as younger disciples. The subjects covered concern the vices, the spiritual goals of the monastic life, renunciation, prayer, the grace of God, the Bible, miracles, friendship, penitence, and coenobitism and anchoritism. The De institutis seem to have circulated only as a single book, but the Conlationes sometimes circu- lated in a single manuscript and sometimes in their three separate groups; some conlationes may also have been copied separately.8 This study examines five authors and texts: in three of these, the usage of Cassian's writings is clear and unequivocal, while in the other two it must be admitted to be less certain. A literary analysis of the usage of Cassian's writ- ings by early medieval authors sometimes encounters significant critical diffi- culties which, however, it is not necessary to resume here, given the generally of Eucherius's epitome of Cassian's De institutis (so printed in PL 50, cols. 867-94, but this text may not be the work of Eucherius) by later writers has not yet been explored by scholars; a Fulda catalogue dating from the late eighth or early ninth century includes an entry for Cassian under the designation of Eucherius (see P. Lehmann, Fuldaer Studien (Munich, 1925), pp. 50-1). Cassian derived his schema of the eight vices from Evagrius Ponticus, whose schema is almost identical; a number of works by Evagrius were translated into Latin by Rufinus, Gennadius, and other anonymous writers. A Latin translation of the De octo spirìtibus malitiae is apparently still unedited, but may also have been a source for Latin writers (Greek text in PG 79, cols. 1145-64); see Evagre le Pontique: Traité pratique ou Le moine, ed. with French trans, by A. and C. Guillaumont, 2 vols. Sources chrétiennes 170-1 (Paris, 1971) I, 318-19. 8 According to the notice in E. A. Lowe, Codices Latini Antiquiores: a Palaeographical Guide to Latin Manuscripts Prior to the Ninth Century, 11 vols, and Supplement (Oxford, 1934-71, 2nd ed. of vol. II, 1972), Suppl., no. 1772, Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Pal. lat. 560 (fols. A, 1-96) (Lorsch, s. viiiex), this apparently undamaged manuscript contains only Conlationes III-V and VII-X; on Lorsch manuscripts, see also immediately below. An exchange of letters between Fructuosus of Braga and Braulio of Saragossa in 651 shows that Fructuosus had a copy of Conlationes XVIII- XXIV, but that he had been unable to procure a copy of Conlationes I-X and XI-XVII in the Iberian peninsula, or in southern Gaul either {Epistulae XLIII-XLTV: Epistolario de san Braulio. Introducción, edición crítica, y traduction , ed. L. Riesco Terrero (Seville, 1975), pp. 164-6 and 178). Cassian himself envisages the possibility that readers may not have copies of all of his books: see De institutis II.ix (CSEL 17, 24-5); Conlationes XX.i.1 (CSEL 13, 554). Such examples suggest that a demonstrable knowledge of some of the Conlationes in an author does not therefore prove a knowledge of all of Cassian's writings. On the other hand, the manuscript Kassel, Landesbibliothek, Manuskripten - Anhang 1 8 (Lowe, Codices Latini Antiquiores , VIII, no. 1143), while consisting of two folios containing Conlationes VILxxx-VULi written in Anglo-Saxon minuscule and dated s. viii2, is nonetheless a fragment and cannot be taken as evidence that these two conferences circulated independently. Some later evidence also suggests that individual conlationes were copied: Catalogi Bibliothecarum Antiqui , ed. G. Becker (Bonn, 1885), p. 72, no. 577 (Bobbio: Conlationes XI-XIII?), pp. 111-12, no. 467 (= p. 124, no. 104, both Lorsch), p. 129, no. 511 (Regensburg: Conlatio XVIII or XIV?), all from the tenth century; and see below, n. 56. 29</page><page sequence="4">Stephen Lake unproblematic nature of the examples considered.9 It should nonetheless be observed that while all of the following examples emanate from monastic contexts, with the possible exception of the anonymous Vita S. Cuthberti , none of them offers any evidence for Cassian's alleged influence on the develop- ment of monastic practice, which was arguably less considerable than is often supposed. CASSIAN AS A SOURCE FOR ANGLO-SAXON AUTHORS The Leiden Glossary The earliest Anglo-Saxon evidence for a knowledge of Cassian is to be found in the 'Leiden Glossary'.10 This is the most important member of a group of some twenty-five glossaries and fragments dating from the ninth century to the fourteenth. Of these, the 'Leiden Glossary' is one of the earliest, and therefore closest to the point of origin; it is also one of the most extensive. It is pre- served in a manuscript which was probably copied at St Gallen c. 800, but it has been argued that it was originally a product of the school of Theodore and Hadrian at Canterbury in the last decades of the seventh century.11 It consists of forty-eight chapters or lists of words extracted from a range of patristic lit- erature and biblical books; in several instances, there are two or three chapters of lemmata from the same source: these include chs. xxxiv (with fifty-five words) and xlviii (with seventy-four words), both drawn from Cassian's De insńtutis . A full critical analysis of this glossary remains to be made, but a few obser- vations emerge from a consideration of chs. xxxiv and xlviii. If we combine the evidence of these two chapters, we find that lemmata ( glossae collectae) have been taken from every book of the De institutis except from bk IX (the short- est, excepting the Preface).12 The glosses consist in only one or several words, which is perhaps surprising: in other chapters, and also in the biblical glosses recendy edited by Bernhard Bischoff and Michael Lapidge,13 glosses are some- 9 The present article is based on parts of my dissertation: S.

A revised version of this dissertation is currently being prepared for publication. 10 A Late Eighth-Century Latin-Anglo-Saxon Glossary preserved in the Library of the Leiden University (MS.

One might also have expected some more lengthy remarks on glosses drawn from a text reflecting eastern monasticism, with which Theodore was acquainted at first hand. The lemmata are not drawn from the books of De institutis in their sequence; rather, the words are usually in the order in which they are found only within any one book. Thus, for example, ch. xxxiv begins with lemmata from De instit- utis II, then proceeds through IV, VI, X, XI, VIII, XII and, finally, V. Some words are out of the sequence in which they occur within the relevant book of the De institutis ,14 A majority of the books have been glossed twice, once in ch. xxxiv and then again in ch. xlviii,15 and several words have been glossed in both chapters.16 Ch. xlviii has the appearance at first sight of being considerably more disor- dered than ch. xxxiv. Seven glosses cannot be identified in Cassian's writings,17 several lemmata have no gloss,18 and several duplicate each other within this chapter.19 Yet, at various points, a pattern emerges: for example, nos. 20-9 are drawn from De institutis V, then from the Preface, then again from V, then from the Preface, then V - I-V - I - V - I - as if they were two sets of lemmata , perhaps written by different students, which had been intertwined. We do not know exacdy how this glossary was compiled, whether by stu- dents working alone through a text with some assistance from a master, or whether they are lecture notes taken down Viva voce'. Yet we can suggest that these entries are the work of a number of students and have been, in the 'Leiden Glossary', put together in some sort of order from various bundles of notes. The glossary illustrates the careful reading of Cassian for the purpose of learning Latin.20 It might be possible to approach the identification of the manuscript of 14 e.g. chs. xxxiv.28-35, 43-6, 50-1, 53-4; xlviii.27-9. 15 De institutis II, IV, V, VI, VIII, XI and XII. 16 chs. xxxiv.35 and xlviii.20, xxxiv.40 and xlviii. 19, xxxiv.50 and xlviii.35, xxxiv.31 and xlviii.44, xxxiv.39 and xlviii.39, 68. Many lemmata from these two chapters also repeat words glossed in other chapters: for a list, see Lake, 'The Influence of John Cassian', p. 200, n. 97. 17 xlviii.51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61 and 71 (note the pattern), as against two in ch. xxxiv: 24 and 25. 18 xlviii.41 and 64. xlviii.40, 54 and 55 are glossed with Old English words, but there are no ver- nacular glosses in ch. xxxiv. The entire glossary contains about 250 Old English explanations. 19 xlviii. 14 and 36, 22 and 52, 41 and 68; cf. 31, 33, 67. 20 Lapidge, The School of Theodore and Hadrian', pp. 67-72, lists twenty-seven continental manuscripts, not including major English glossaries related to the 'Leiden family'. Of these, four include one or both of the chapters here containing the Cassian glosses: St Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek, 299, s. ixcx (both chs. xxxiv and xlviii; this manuscript was also copied at St Gallen); Einsiedeln, Stiftsbibliothek, 32, s. xmcd (ch. xxxiv); Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana, M. 79 sup, s. xi1 (ch. xxxiv); Sélestat, Bibliothèque municipale, 7 (100), s. xiilnlt (both chs. xxxiv and xlviii). 31</page><page sequence="6">Stephen Lake Cassiaris De institutis from which the lemmata were drawn. A number of lemmata (e.g. xlviii.23, 26, 33, 43 and 69) occur in variant forms found only in Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Lat. 12292, a late-ninth- or early- tenth- century manuscript. This manuscript was copied at Lorsch, but was at Corbie in the twelfth century, and is considered an inferior witness to the text of Cassian.21 This manuscript may be a relative of that used at Canterbury. Admittedly, Latin spelling was not consistent, and as the students may have written from spoken instruction, spelling might not be a reliable indicator of the manuscript used. Nonetheless, this group of variant readings arguably con- stitutes a representative consistency sufficient to warrant the conclusion that a predecessor of this manuscript was used. Aldhelm, De Vìrginitate ' Contemporary with the Leiden Glossary is Aldhelm's use of Cassian in his opus geminatum , the De uirginitate . There are four passages in which he seems to have drawn material from Cassian. First, Aldhelm employs nautical imagery which resembles that of Cassian.22 While such imagery is pervasive throughout the Middle Ages, and therefore cannot always be used as evidence of borrowing between authors, here the inference of derivation is reasonable.23 Secondly, in speaking of Basil of Caesarea, he says that Basil claimed to have known no woman and yet he was not a virgin: 'is, inquam, quod integritatis gra- tia incorruptus corporaliter floruerit, ex ipsius elogio coniecturam capesso ita prosequentis: Et feminam non cognosco et virgo non sunt ,24 This 'saying' occurs in Cassian, De institutis Vl.xix: 'Fertur sancii Basili Caesariensis episcopi dis- tricta sentential et mulierem, inquit, ignoro, et uirgo non sum . In tantum intellexit incorruptionem carnis non tam in mulieris esse abstinentia quam in integritāte 21 Cf. B. Bischoff, 'Lorsch im Spiegel seiner Handschriften', Die Reichsabtei Lorsch , ed. F.

Curtius, Europäische Literatur und lateinisches Mittelalter ' 2nd ed. (Bern, 1954), pp. 138-41; M. Winterbottom, ^Variations on a Nautical Theme', Hermathena 120 (1976), 55-8; and Lake, The Influence of John Cassian', esp. pp. 125-6, to which numerous other examples could be added. On Aldhelm's use of Gildas, see N. Wright, Aldhelm, Gildas, and Acircius', in his History and Literature in Late Antiquity and the Early Medieval West: Studies in Intertextuality (Aldershot, 1995), no. XIV. 24 That this Basil, I say, flourished corporeally incorrupt, by virtue of his integrity, I shall under- stand as an interpretation of his own maxim, as follows: "I do not know a woman, and yet I am not a virgin" ' (prose De uirginitate , ch. XXVII: ed. Ehwald, pp. 263-4; trans. M. Lapidge and M. Herren, Aldhelm: the Prose Works (Cambridge, 1979), p. 86). Cf. also Carmen de uirgini- tate, lines 746-50 (ed.

Itaque sicut superius diximus [rrpaKTLKrj] erga multas professiones ac studia deriua- tur, [OcœprjTLK'q] uero in duas diuiditur partes, id est in historicam interpretationem et intellegentiam spiritalem . . . spiritalis autem scientiae genera sunt tria, tropologia, allegoria, anagoge . . . itaque historia praeteritarum ac uisibilium agnitionem com- plectitur rerum ... ad allegoriam autem pertinent quae sequuntur, quia ea quae in ueritate gesta sunt alterius sacramenti formam prefigurasse dicuntur . . . anagoge uero de spiritalibus mysteriis ad sublimiora quaedam et sacratiora caelorum secreta 25 "This severe saying from St Basil, bishop of Caesarea, has been reported: "I have not known a woman, and yet nonetheless I am not a virgin." He understood that the incorruption of the flesh lies less in abstaining from contact with women, than in that purity of heart which is true incorruptibility, and which preserves the body holy in the fear of God and love of chastity' (CSEL 17, 125-6; my translation). Cassian expresses the same idea elsewhere, and it is also found, for example, in Columbanus, Regula monachorum VI ( Sancii Columbani Opera, , ed. G. S. M. Walker, Scriptores latini hiberniae 2 (Dublin, 1957), 128); Jerome, Epistula XXII.xxxviii (CSEL 54, 202-5), et al. 26 Cf.

At De institutis VILxix, Cassian records another saying of Basil. A small number of sayings of Basil are recorded in the Greek collections of apophthegmata, , but these are not among them; I have not found the saying from De institutis Vl.xix in the earliest Latin collection of the Verba seniorům , but that from De institutis VILxix occurs as saying VI.x in PL 73, col. 890. 27 'Now, exploring wisely the fourfold text of the evangelical story, expounded through the mys- tical commentaries of the catholic fathers and laid open spiritually to the very core and divided up by the rules of the fourfold ecclesiastical tradition according to historia, allegoria, tropologia, and anagoge' (prose De uirginitate , ch.

Ehwald, pp. 245 and 298). 33</page><page sequence="8">Stephen Lake conscendens . . . tropologia est moralis explanado ad emundationem uitae et instruc- tionem pertinens actualem.28 Fourthly, the most extensive use of Cassian by Aldhelm occurs in his pres- entation of the eight principal vices, although he also adapts other sources. In the prefatory remarks of the prose De uirginitate , Aldhelm presents this theme as part of his theoretical discussion of virginity.29 This section is not direcdy paralleled in the metrical version, but the latter does conclude with a long résumé of all of the vices against which virginity must fight.30 Aldhelm's over- all treatment and effect in these accounts differs from Cassian, but it is based in part upon Conlatio V, and appeals to him explicidy, along with Gregory the Great's handling of the principal vices in his Moralia in lob , which Aldhelm him- self seems to recognize as also pardy indebted to Cassian.31 The Anonymous Ufe of St Cuthbert The anonymous Vita S. Cuthberti (Ill.i) contains a possible verbal echo from Cassian. Speaking of Cuthbert's move to Lindisfarne and his life there, the writer says: 'Viuens quoque ibi secundum sanctam scripturam, contemplativi am uitam in actuali agens.'32 Compare, for example, Cassian's phrasing: 'cuius quidem duplex scientia est: prima {trpaKriKrj[y id est actual &amp;, quae emenda- tione morum et uitiorum purgatione perficitur: altera [OeœprjriK'q], quae in 28 'But to return to the explanation of the knowledge from which our discourse took its rise. Thus, as we said above, practical knowledge is distributed among many subjects and interests, but theoretical is divided into two parts, i.e., the historical interpretation and the spiritual sense . . . But of spiritual knowledge there are three kinds, tropological, allegorical, anagogical . . . and so the history embraces the knowledge of things past and visible . . . But to the allegory belongs what follows, for what actually happened is said to have prefigured the form of some mystery . . . But the anagogical sense rises from spiritual mysteries even to still more sublime and sacred secrets of heaven . . . The tropological sense is the moral explanation which has to do with improvement of life and practical teaching' (CSEL 13, 404-5; trans. Gibson, pp. 437-8). Cassian's explanation is interspersed with biblical examples; this same account is also used by Bede (see below, n. 47). On this paradigm, see, for example, H. de Lubac, Exégèse médiévale. Les quatre sens de F écrire 1.1, Théologie 41 (1959), esp. 190-3; B. Smalley, The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages, 3rd ed. (Oxford, 1983), pp. 1-36, esp. 27-8. 29 Prose De uirginitate , ch. XIII (ed. Ehwald, p. 241). 30 Carmen de uirginitate, lines 2446-761 (ed. Ehwald, pp. 452-65). In some manuscripts, the final section of the metrical De uirginitate is known as De octo uitiis principalibus , which is the same title as the last eight books of Cassian's De institutis. 31 In the prose De uirginitate , ch. XIII, Aldhelm refers to 'the ten books of the Collationes patrum composed by Cassian', which presumably denotes a manuscript containing only Conlationes I-X; given his use of Conlatio XIV, he obviously also had, at the very least, a copy of this con- ference. 32 ťHe dwelt there also according to Holy Scripture, following the contemplative amid the active life' ( Two Uves of Saint Cuthbert: a Ufe by an Anonymous Monk of Undi farne and Bede's Prose Ufe , ed. B. Colgrave (Cambridge, 1940), pp. 94-5). This life was written between 698 and 705. 34</page><page sequence="9">Knowledge of the writings of John Cassian contemplations diuinarum rerum et sacratissimorum sensuum cognitione con- sistit'.33 The phrase "actualis vita' has been taken to be an echo of Cassian.34 This use of 'actualis' is first attested from the fourth century AD notably, though not exclusively, by Cassian in a variety of applications.35 The phrase "actualis vita' here, in relation to the "vita contemplativa', is obviously used in the sense of "the active life'. The Christian concept of the active life at this time was flex- ible, and could mean a life in the world with all of its obligations and difficul- ties in contrast to a life of retirement such as the monastic life, but also the first stages of the contemplative life itself during which the vices are uprooted from the soul, before which one cannot contemplate God without spiritual distur- bance. Cassian's understanding is not so often encountered in early medieval authors, but a more simple contrast between the active and the contemplative lives is frequent. The two quotations above are not parallel: the anonymous author seems to imply the former sense of the active life, while Cassian clearly describes the lat- ter, and the relevant noun is not "vita' but "scientia', which is in fact more com- mon in Cassian. Furthermore, the anonymous author seems to display no other echo of Cassian. It would therefore appear that he is either echoing another author or text,36 or that he is appealing to a more pervasive conception which at best may owe something in its origins to Cassian.37 Another possibility is that 33 'And the knowledge of [the principles of our religion] is twofold: first, [npaKTLKrj], i.e., prac- tical, which is brought about by an improvement of morals and purification from faults: sec- ondly, [d€Cüpr¡TLKrj', which consists in the contemplation of things Divine and the knowledge of most sacred thoughts' ( Conlationes XIV.i.3: CSEL 13, 398-9; trans. Gibson, p. 435). Interestingly, the Vita S. Fursei XXVIII ( Vitae sanctorum Hibemiae , ed. W. W. Heist (Brussels, 1965), p. 49), uses the phrase 'theoretica vita'. 34 Chadwick, John Cassian , p. 149, n. 1, took the phrase 'actualis vita' here as an echo of Cassian. Cf. also, for example, Isidore, Sententiae III. 15 {Santos padres españoles , II, San Leandro, San Isidoro, San Fructuoso , ed. J. Campos Ruiz and I. Roca Meliá (Madrid, 1971), pp. 440-2), who gives a slighdy different definition of the active and the contemplative lives, but who also uses the phrase 'actualis vita'. On Cassian's understanding of contemplation, see M. Olphe-Galliard, 'Vie contemplative et vie active d'après Cassien', Revue d'ascétique et de mystique 16 (1935), 252-88. 35 Thesaurus Linguae Latinae (Leipzig, 1900-) I, col. 448 s.v. The use of 'actualis' occurs in De institutis V.xxxiii.l (CSEL 17, 106: 'actualis vita*); Conlationes I.i, IV.x.3, VI.i.2, X.viii.1, XIII.vii.3, XIV.ix.5, XV.ii.2 and XXI.xxxiv.4 (CSEL 13, 7, 104-5, 154, 296, 370, 408-9, 428 and 612). 36 The phrase also occurs e.g. in Aldhelm, Ep. ad Gerontium (ed. Ehwald, p. 481), and in Julianus Pomerius, De vita contemplativa Ill.xxvii (PL 59, col. 509), which may echo Macrobius, Comm. in Somnium Scipionis II.xvii.5 ( Ambrosii Theodosii Macrobii Commentarti in Somnium Scipionis, ed. J. Willis (Leipzig, 1970), p. 151); immediately following, Macrobius speaks of the active and contemplative lives. 37 In his prose Vita S. Cuthberti (ch. XVII), Bede makes a different distinction, while his parallel account (ch. XVI) differs from the Anonymous' (Uli) quoted above (ed. Colgrave, pp. 206-13, 214-15, and endnotes, pp. 324-5 and 349). 35</page><page sequence="10">Stephen Lake he is imitating Gregory the Great, who speaks on several occasions in the Dialogi of being in the presence of God in contemplation, while yet still on earth in the body.38 Augustine of Canterbury, Responsio DC There is a possible influence of Cassian on the ninth Responsio from Pope Gregory to Augustine in Canterbury. According to Deanesly and Grosjean, the Libellus responsionum was probably the work of Nothhelm in Canterbury, who expanded at length an original and shorter letter by Gregory, and Responsio IX is principally the work of Nothhelm rather than of Gregory.39 If this is so, then it may provide further evidence of the study of Cassian in Canterbury. The ninth question asks whether a priest should celebrate the mass on the morning after he has had a nocturnal seminal emission.40 With some reserva- tions, the Responsio agrees that a priest may then celebrate the mass, or at least partake of it. The answer gives three causes for such an emission: gluttony, an excess of natural humours or infirmity, and a disturbance of thoughts. If it has occurred through an excess of humours or weakness, then it is not a serious matter, as it was not willed by the mind. If it has occurred because of gluttony or an overburdening of the natural receptacles of the humours, then the priest may receive the sacrament, but ought not to offer the mass if another can do so in his stead; some guilt attaches to the fact that one indulged in gluttony, even if no lust was experienced. However, if it resulted from disturbed thoughts which one experienced first while awake, then the mind is clearly at fault. An aetiology of sin is then constructed. There are three stages leading to sin which are to be distinguished: by suggestion, by pleasure and by consent. A temptation does not result in a sin being committed, unless the flesh delights in the act and the spirit consents to it; yet even so, there can be conflict between physical delight and the struggle of the mind against that delight. The discus- sion ends by quoting St Paul: ťI see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin, which is in my members' (Romans VII.23). Deanesly and Grosjean believed that this Responsio bears some resemblance in form to the Sententiae of Isidore and that its content may be indebted to 38 E.g. Dialogi , Praefatio, III.xvii.8- 1 3, Ill.xxxiv: Grégoire le Grand, Dialogues , ed. with French trans, by A. de Vogüé and P. Antin, 3 vols., Sources chrétiennes 251, 260 and 265 (Paris, 1978, 1979, 1980) II, 10-14, 340-2 and 400-4. Gregory does not here use the phrase Vita actualis'. 39 M. Deanesly and P. Grosjean, The Canterbury Edition of the Answers of Pope Gregory I to St Augustine', JEH 10 (1959), 1-49. I am not sure that R. Meens, A Background to Augustine's Mission to Anglo-Saxon England', ASE 23 (1994), 5-17, has completely suc- ceeded in discounting Deanesly and Grosjean's argument. 40 Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People , ed.

They were unable to offer any direct parallel, however, except the following: ťSed sciendum nobis est quia tribus modis tentado agitur, suggestione , delectatione et consensu .'41 In its explanation of the three forms of temptation, this parallel is exact, though there is litde similarity between the two texts beyond this point. Unfortunately, the context of Gregory's statement has nothing to do with noc- turnal emissions and the homily is unlikely to have been direcdy referred to in preparing the Responsio. We must therefore suppose that this categorization by Gregory was familiar by other means: for example, that it was given in the let- ter which Nothhelm then expanded. Thereis another possible source for the Responsio : Cassian, Conlatio XXII, De nocturnis inlusionibus . Although I have found no exact verbal parallel, Cassian's discussion does involve a number of broader similarities. Three causes are given for assaults on a monk, and particularly when he experiences a nocturnal seminal emission: an excess of eating, a lack of vigilance, or a direct attack of the devil by the stimulation of illusions. Cassian's treatment of the subject aims to instruct the monk in appropriate disciplines which will ultimately render it impossible for him to have such an emission; he makes a distinction between celibacy and true chastity; and he is addressing monks rather than priests. However, the question is then posed, whether a monk may partake of the Eucharist after having had such an experience? If there has been no consent to pleasure, and it has been caused only by a natural necessity or an attack of the devil who seeks to impede the monk, then the latter can and should par- take of the sacrament. However, the case is different if the monk is at fault.42 The monk is left to decide if his conscience is clear or not. The remainder of the conlatio is concerned with the means by which the monk can learn to avoid 41 "But we know that there are three forms of temptation, by suggestion, by pleasure, and by consent' (my translation): Homiliae .xl. in euangelia I, Horn. XVI (PL 76, col. 1135); similarly, Regula pastoralis Il.ii (Grégoire le Grand, Règle pastorale , ed. with French trans, by B. Judie, F. Rommel and C. Morel, 2 vols., Sources chrétiennes 381-2 (Paris, 1992) I, 180). Isidore, Sententiae II.xxv, gives two causes of sin: deeds and thoughts ("Bipartita est causa peccandi, id est, operis et cogitationis': ed. Campos Ruiz and Roca Meliá, pp. 350-2). Their suggestion of Gregory, Dialogi IV.l (not IV.xlviii), on the various kinds of dreams is not sufficiently close. Compare Rufinus 's Latin translation of the anonymous Historìa monachorum XX, where the same question of a monk receiving the mass after a nocturnal emission is considered, and two causes are given: an abundance of natural humours, which does not result in sin, and a vol- untary delight in fantasies of women, which is sinful ( Tyrannius Rufinus Historia monachorum sive De vita sanctorum patrum , ed. E. Schulz-Flügel (Berlin, 1990), pp. 354-5); Rufinus's version modifies the Greek (cf. Historia monachorum inAegypto , ed. A.-J. Festugière (Brussels, 1971), pp. 118-19). There is here no verbal resemblance between Rufinus and either Cassian or the Responsio. For a broader discussion of some aspects of this subject, see D. Brakke, The Problematization of Nocturnal Emissions in Early Christian Syria, Egypt, and Gaul',/»/ of Early Christian Stud. 3 (1995), 419-60; Stewart, Cassian the Monk, pp. 81-3, who gives other ref- erences, notably to Augustine's Confessiones. 37</page><page sequence="12">Stephen Lake such experiences; there is an extended consideration of temptation, but noth- ing which resembles the neat exposition of the Responsio. Finally, Cassian also quotes Romans VIL23.43 There is no clear verbal resemblance between the Responsio and Cassian to demonstrate that the former is indebted to the latter. At the same time, how- ever, there is a general resemblance in subject matter, in the structure of the argument, as well as several particular points, which the author of the Responsio may have developed from a consideration of Cassian's, which is in fact the ear- liest extensive Latin discussion of the problem.44 The question of seminal emission is found in most of the older Irish penitentials, but it is mentioned there only peremptorily and without any reflection.45 The solution in the Responsio shows no influence of the penitentials, and even where the priest is at fault it imposes no formal penalty. The Responsio is sometimes repeated in later penitentials.46 43 Conlationes XXII.xiv (CSEL 13, 634); Bede's HE , ed. Colgrave and Mynors, p. 102. The Responsio also refers to Deut. XXIII. 10-11, while Cassian actually quotes it (XXII, v ad fin.-. CSEL 13, 621). Cassian handles the same subject especially in Conlationes XILix- x and De institutis Vl.x-xi; while there is some similarity of thought, I have not noticed any more exten- sive verbal parallels in these discussions. 44 The Responsio has: 'Sin uero ex turpi cogitatione uigilantis oritur inlusio dormientis . . while Cassian has: 'Sin uero nostro uitio haec fuerit egesta concretio . . and both texts refer to the conscience (; Judicium ) of the priest or monk concerned. Isidore, Sententiae III.vi.6, seems to be close to Cassian: 'Diversae qualitates sunt somniorum. Quaedam enim ex saturitate, seu inan- itione occurrunt, quae edam per experientiam nota sunt. Quaedam vero ex propria cogita- tione oriuntur; nam saepe quae in die cogitamus, in noctibus recognoscimus.' There are various kinds of dreams. Some are caused by satiety or by hunger, as is well known. Others arise from our own thoughts, so that what has occupied our mind during the day returns dur- ing the nighť (ed. Campos Ruiz and Roca Melia, p. 418; my translation); ibid. III.vi.14: 'Qui nocturna illusione polluitur, quamvis etsi extra memoriam turpium cogitationum sese persen- tiat inquinatimi, tarnen hoc, ut tentaretur, culpae suae tribuat, suamque immunditiam statim fletibus tergat.' 'He who has been polluted by a nocturnal illusion, in so far as he was stained from being aroused by the recollection of filthy thoughts, should consider this temptation as being his fault, and he should immediately cleanse his impurity with tears' {ibid. p. 421; my translation; note also III.vi.13). Unusually for a monastic rule, the Regula Isidori refers three times to nocturnal seminal emissions (chs. XIII, XVII and XXII: ibid. pp. 111-12, 115 and 123). 45 E.g.

First, Bede twice employs the four-fold hermeneutical paradigm, which makes it clear that he knew Cassian's exposition in Conlatio XIV.47 Secondly, commenting on a possible deceit that David practised on a priest, Bede expli- citly appeals to the conferences of the fathers and by name to Joseph, who gives Conlatio XVII, as well as to Augustine, on the subject of lying.48 Thirdly, in discussing the story of Ananias and Saphyra (Acts V.l- 11), a story fre- quently referred to in sources from this period, Bede traces the origin of the category of monks called Sarabaites to them; this aetiology is original to Cassian, and is not to be found in Jerome's Epistula XXII, the Regula magistři or the Regula Benedirti, which also mention this kind of monk.49 Fourthly, Bede employs the example of the three days which Jonah spent in the belly of the whale to explain synecdoche, which is a way in which one can understand the whole of a subject from its parts, and a part represents or speaks of the whole.50 This might be indebted to Cassian, although Bede also employs 1992), pp. 161-88, at 181; Paenitentiale Merseburgense a [MeJ 90: Paenitentialia minora Franciae et Italiae saeculi VIII- IX, ed.

Finally, Bede employs Cassian in his commentary on the gospel of Luke.51 In commenting upon Mary's conception in spite of the fact that she is a virgin, Bede mentions Nestorius's denial that Mary could be called the Mother of God and refers to Cassian's remark upon the same text.52 Later in the same work, when considering the parable of the prodigal son, Bede first echoes Cassian, and then quotes extensively from him.53 These passages make it clear that Bede was very familiar with at least some of Cassian's œuvre.54 Manuscript Evidence The evidence considered in this paper implies that more than one copy of Cassian's writings was available in Anglo-Saxon England during the period under discussion. There is, however, no extant Insular manuscript of Cassian's writings from this period. Lowe lists one manuscript fragment written in Anglo-Saxon minuscule, but this cannot be said definitely to have been copied in England.55 More extensive evidence dates only from late Anglo-Saxon and 51 I owe the references to In Lucam to Joan Hart-Hasler and Neil Wright: these borrowings are not identified in the CCSL edition. See now J. N. Hart-Hasler, "Vestigia patrum sequens: the Venerable Bede's Use of Patristic Sources in his Commentary on the Gospel of Luke' (unpubl. PhD dissertation, Cambridge Univ., 1999). 52 In Lucam I.i.35 {In Lucae Evangelium Expositio, In Marci Evangelium Expositio , ed. D. Hurst, CCSL 120 (Turnhout, 1960), 34, lines 595-8); Cassian, De incarnatione II.ii.8 (CSEL 17, 249, lines 19-23). Bede: "Ecce Deum dixit superuenturum Dei filium n as ci turu m . Quomodo ergo aut Dei filius Deus non est aut quae Deum edidit quomodo "theotokos", id est Dei genetrix non esse potest? , "See that he said that God would come upon her and that the Son of God would be born. How then, can the Son of God not be God, and how can she who produced God not be "'theotokos", i.e. the mother of God?' (my translation; italics show agreement with Cassian). 53 In Lucam IV.xv.19 (CCSL 120, 289, lines 2371-2): 'sed mercennarii statum iam pro mercede serui- turus desiderat', 'but as if he had already become a hireling he desired to serve for payment' (my translation; italics show agreement with Cassian), echoes Cassian, Conlationes XI.vii.2 (CSEL 13, 319, Unes 9-10); then, In Lucam IV.xv.21 (CCSL 120, 290, Unes 2408-291, Une 2417), quoting Cassian, Conlationes XI.6.2 (CSEL 13, 317, Unes 26-318, Une 8) in extenso . 54 Some suggested paraUels between Bede and Cassian are less certain: e.g. Bede, In Genesim III.xU.4 {Librì Quatuor in Prìncipium Genesis , ed. C.W.Jones, CCSL 118A (Turnhout, 1967), 170, Une 996), with Cassian, Conlationes XI.xni.6 (not Xll.xiU) (CSEL 13, 330, Unes 24-5): here, Bede refers to a 'septiformis [spiritus]', an aUusion to Isaiah XI.2-3 which Cassian also makes, but the usage is considerably different; the same phrase also occurs in Leander of SeviUe, Regula Praefatio (ed. Campos Ruiz and Roca MeUá, p. 35), who then, however, quotes Isaiah LVI.3. Bede, In Genesim IV.xvin.6-7 (CCSL 118A, 213-14, Unes 695-715), with Cassian, Conlationes XlV.viU (CSEL 13, 404-7): Bede gives a threefold paradigm of bibücal interpreta- tion, but Jerome, Augustine and Gregory are also possible sources. 55 See above, n. 8: Kassel, LandesbibUothek Manuskripten - Anhang 1 8, and see also above, pp. 31-2 on the possible identification of a manuscript used at Canterbury. 40</page><page sequence="15">Knowledge of the writings of John Cassian early Norman England.56 At least one copy of conceivably all of Cassian's writ- ings was available among the Britons by the late fifth century, which Gildas used, and the Irish also appear to have known Cassian's works from a date ear- lier than the earliest Anglo-Saxon evidence. However, as the examples consid- ered here are associated with Canterbury and Wearmouth, it seems more likely that the copies used by these authors came from the Continent. CONCLUSIONS Almost every example considered in this study represents a different kind of usage of the writings of Cassian. These uses include literary imitation or ver- bal echoes, the use of the schema of the principal vices, the study of Latin, the borrowing of particular pericopae, and use in biblical exposition. It is probable that our authors knew more of Cassian's works than what they have used: the kind of usage displayed by Aldhelm and Bede in particular is quite assimilated and implies considerable familiarity with their sources, while the example of the "Leiden Glossary' also reveals a close reading of texts. This evidence is lim- ited in time to litde more than a half century, and to a relatively limited circle of learned contacts. On this basis alone, it is then difficult to infer either sig- nificandy wider circulation of Cassian's writings in early Anglo-Saxon England or any particular influence on English monastic practice.57 56 H.
