By the time of printing, Aleni had achieved considerable success in proselytization, and the publication of the book was intended to expedite the process. The enterprise was quite successful. The book continued to be printed in multiple editions throughout the following centuries and circulated far beyond the southern Fujian province. This essay will explore the receptive potential of Jingjie in the context of indigenous Buddhist tradition in China. I argue that Jingjie, a meditative manual expounding the Jesuits' exquisite methodology of visually oriented contemplation, could be eagerly received and fully functional among the Chinese audience since it was already familiar with a similar tradition drawn from the Sutra of the Contemplation of the Infinite-Age Buddha [ ÏS$S JklNS* ] (Guanwuliangshoujing, hereafter Contemplation Sutra) of Pure Land Buddhism. There are two reservations to make here. First, it is not suggested that Aleni intended to exploit a similar tradition inherent in China as a useful foundation on which Jesuits' methodology might take root, even though he could have been well aware of this potential. Rather, the focus is on the situations and factors that con- tributed to the successful reception history of EHI on Chinese soil regardless of Alenis original intention. Secondly, there is a slight difference between the meth- odologies of EHJ and Contemplation Sutra. The EHI leads to the envisioning of the Holy Land, which is a historical and earthly site. Here the practitioner experiences the biblical events reenacted in his or her lifetime. On the other hand, the Contem- plation Sutra enables the practitioner to relish the delectation of the Pure Land, a theological paradise that exists beyond the earthly realm. Significantly, however, both methodologies lead a practitioner to visually construct an imaginary topog- raphy of holy space and take a journey through it, with the aid of illustrations pre- sented in the works. Since the time of Matteo Ricci, Jesuits chose to associate with Confucianism, the ruling ideology of the court and literati officials, and to antagonize Buddhism. Therefore, it is unlikely indeed that Aleni would have planned his new book and its methodology to take advantage of a similar Buddhist tradition. However, the existence of Buddhism in Chinese culture could not easily be dismissed and it strongly benefited the Jesuits' mission without their awareness or intention. At the time of the Jesuits' entry into China, Buddhism remained the best organized and the most influential form of religion, widely spread at all levels of social classes, and its institutions were ever increasing throughout the kingdom including the province of Fujian, the stage of Alenis mission.3 Even Confucianist literati were so Dialogue between Christianity and Chinat ed.

Jesuits never understood the paradox that political ideology and personal religion could coexist somehow separately in Chinese culture. Con- fucianist literati appeared to denigrate Buddhism, but they needed it since Bud- dhism complemented the lack of an eschatological afterlife explanation in Confucianism. Confucianism functioned largely as a governing ideology and moral code of conduct despite its own metaphysical dimension. Fathers Michèle Ruggieri and Matteo Ricci, the first missionaries in China, recognized the formal similarities between Catholicism and Buddhism and ini- tially attempted to exploit them as a transit to approach Chinese people. They wore Buddhist garments and displayed themselves as the monks of a Western reli- gion.5 However, they forsook this attempt shortly after realizing that the ruling ideology of the kingdom was Confucianism. Besides, Jesuits came to detest Bud- dhism because of its similarities with their religion. Formal similarities in religious practice such as tonsure, celibacy, chant, rosary, and asceticism shocked Jesuits so much that they eventually regarded Buddhism as the devil's distortion of true reli- gion.6 However, Jesuits either did not understand or want to admit that these deceptive similarities provided the most effective linking device to attract Chinese, who were predisposed to understand and even accept Catholicism because of their familiarity with Buddhism.7 Erik Zürcher observes that Christianity was not merely intellectual or meta- physical discourses but was a religion with ritual, miraculous power, mysteries, and icons. In these respects, it comes much closer to Buddhism than Confucian- ism. It was a paradox that Catholicism antagonized Buddhism, which it resembled so much. Between these two religions there are more than purely formal resem- blances, such as eschatology centering on individual salvation and contempt for earthly values. Jacques Gernet states that Catholicism's assimilation with Bud- dhism was "both total and immediate."

The tradition of figurai images in China had been predominantly of a religious nature, either Buddhist or Daoist.9 The "trinity" mentioned by Ricci in the epigraph above probably refers to the triad of a centering Buddha and two flanking bodhisattvas, which was a very common ico- nography in East Asia. Iconographie similarity yielded certain cases of conflation, which certainly imply more than a mere confusion. The best example would be the emergence of the iconography Songzi Guanyin [ jS~P fflW ], that is, son-bringing Avalokitesvara, at the time. This figure of a lady holding a baby resembled that of the Virgin and Child so much that this image was viewed either way. Ricci first abhorred this conflation as erratic confusion, but eventually changed his mind to make the most out of it.10 In Japan, as the persecution of Catholicism prevailed in the seventeenth century, Christians secretly continued their practice of worship by substituting Buddhist icons as Christian, for example, Buddha Amitabha as Christ and bodhisattva Avalokitesara as the Virgin.11 Thus, the Jesuits' mission projects, especially in their visual enterprise, bene- fited to a considerable extent from the Chinese audiences familiarity with Bud- dhism; the Jesuits' original intention thereof is another issue. In this light, it is suggested that a similar indigenous meditative and visual tradition of Pure Land Buddhism provided a fertile foundation on which the Jesuits' Jingjie and its meth- odology could be received favorably by the Chinese. To argue this thesis, a review of Giulio Aleni's proselytization strategies in the post-Ricci era is presented; this is followed by a discussion of how the Jesuits' meditative methodology worked in the original EHI and what elements of the method were preserved and highlighted in its Chinese edition, Jingjie. The third section examines two exemplary scenes from Jingjie to show how their visual structures with verbal markings directed and pre- scribed Chinese readers in a spatially constructed contemplation. The final sec- tion will show that a similar meditative tradition, expounded in the Contemplation Sutra of Pure Land Buddhism, was still extant in contemporary southern China. On this foundation Jingjie was to be eagerly accepted and widely circulated in the centuries to come. 8Erik Zürcher, "Confucian and Christian Religiosity in Late Ming China," Catholic Historical Review 83 (1997): 649-50; Gernet, Christian Impact, 77, 87; Chen, "Aleni's Mission," 149. 9Bailey, Jesuit Missions, 84. 10Bailey, Jesuit Missions, 89; Xiaoping Lin, "Seeing the Place: The Virgin Mary in a Chinese Lady's Inner Chamber" in Early Modern Catholicism: Essays in Honor of John W.

Thus the Jesuits after Ricci adopted a different tactic: they became boldly religious.12 They chose to confront the Chinese people as messengers of a religion, casting off their earlier disguise as harbingers of advanced Western technology and scientific knowledge. Up to this point, the Chinese had been attracted to the Christian images because of the artis- tic innovations of the Renaissance such as linear perspective and chiaroscuro rather than their religious content. The new approach began with Niccolò Longobardo (1559-1654), who moved the focus of the mission from literati officials to the middle- and lower-class pop- ulace, and also from central Beijing to the southern provinces. This shift yielded very successful results: the number of Christians grew to nearly seventy thousand by the early 1640s.13 Longobardo also saw that the common populace in China, unlike the more iconophobic Confucianist literati, were eagerly receptive to visual religious objects.14 Buddhism, which preceded Christianity by more than a thou- sand years, had deeply ingrained the Chinese with its visual culture. Their devo- tional experience in Buddhist imagery predisposed them to empathize easily with Catholic images.15 Longobardo took advantage of this cultural basis, making extensive use of images to dramatize his preaching.16 Longobardos new strategies were inherited and most effectively deployed by Giulio Aleni, whose lifelong mission in the southern province of Fujian achieved an unprecedented success. Aleni, a native of Brescia, Italy, entered China in 1613, three years after Riccis death. Around 1616 he moved to the culturally renowned southern city of Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, and established Christian communities there and in adjacent provinces such as Shanxi, Jiangsu, and Henan. With an invitation from a former government official, Ye Xianggao [ M fö M ], Aleni moved in 1624 further south to Fujian province. By this time, he had already published numerous volumes of philosophical and scientific writings in Chinese. 12Bailey, Jesuit Missions, 99 ff. 13Bailey, Jesuit Missions, 100. 14Originally, Confucianism had also fostered the production and worship of cultic images of saintly men [HÀ] (shengren), but these figurai images were replaced by name tablets [{£)$] (weipai) from the early Ming Dynasty through a series of iconoclastic movements. Confucianists criticized the iconic worship as an irrational, superstitious practice, introduced into China by the foreign religion of Buddhism; see Deborah Sommer, "Destroying Confucius: Iconoclasm in the Confucian Temple," in On Sacred Grounds: Culture, Society, Politics, and the Formation of the Cult of Confucius, ed. Thomas A. Wilson (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2002), 104 ff., 119. 5Bailey, Jesuit Missions, 101; see also the case of a former Buddhist convert, Yang Tlngyun (1557-1627), who advocated the anthropomorphic representation of the Heavenly Lord, in Sun, "Cul- tural Translatability," 472. 16Bailey, Jesuit Missions, 101.</page><page sequence="6">308 Sixteenth Century Journal XL/2 (2009) His academic aptitude deeply impressed his literati friends, who endowed him an honorary title, "Confucius from the West."17 Aleni devoted the rest of his life to the mission projects in Fujian with a firm religious stance. He stopped writing scientific works, and instead wrote books of catechism and biblical exegesis. Zürcher observes very significantly that, even with educated local literati, Aleni endeavored to converse more on religious subjects than on science and technology. Alenis converts include not only commoners but also educated officials, but these were lower, local officials in contrast to Riccis ruling elites in the capital city. The literati in Fujian were dissatisfied with the politics of Beijing. The sense of alienation from the ruling system led them to seek for an alternative idea, which Aleni provided. Indeed, Catholicism was eagerly embraced by lower-rank literati as well as common people in Fujian. For the twenty-three years he spent in Fujian, Aleni built twenty-two churches and chapels and converted almost ten thousand Chinese. In 1637, when Jingjie was published, some two thousand converts were counted in the prefecture of Fuzhou alone.18 Following in the steps of Longobardo, Aleni also used images for religious purposes, not as an alluring novelty. His sermons and discussions were largely based on biblical and hagiographical narratives, and their illustrative nature demanded the use of images to maximize the impact on the audience. Aleni and his colleagues often showed painted and engraved images during sermons. His Chinese disciple Fanzhong wrote in a pamphlet of 1633, titled "Brief Introduction to Holy Doctrine," that to chant facing the image of the Lord was very effective, which attests to the iconic use of images in Aleni's circle.19 Fujian was an artistically fruitful region in the late Ming Dynasty, both in landscape and Buddhist themes.20 Local people's exposure to Buddhist art must have served favorably for the understanding and acceptance of the Christian images that Aleni used. It would seem that Aleni was well aware of the advantage he could draw from his audiences familiarity with Buddhist theology and art, even if he did not want to overstate it. For instance, he did not take pains in catechism to explain heaven and hell or the last judgment, since he assumed that the Chinese already knew them from similar teachings of Buddhism.21 After thirteen years of both verbal and visual mission activities in Fujian with enormous success, Aleni introduced to his southern audience a grandiose image book, Evangelicae Historiae Imagines^ which was not merely an icon or a narrative, but a visual culmination of the Jesuits' traditional meditative methodology. This book presented to the Chinese an exquisitely prescribed set of visual experiences to read and contemplate, both emotionally and intellectually.

EVANGELICAE HlSTORIAE IMAGINES AND TlANZHU JlANGSHENG CHUXIANGJINGJIE [ ^±ft£trJÄ«# ] EHI consists of 153 engravings, with Latin captions, that illustrate the life of Jesus and the history of salvation from the Annunciation to the Coronation of the Virgin. EHI was originally designed as a companion to another, textual version of the meditation manual, Adnotationes et meditationes in evangelia (AME), pub- lished two years later in the same city of Antwerp. Jerome Nadal (1507-80), having served as an aide to St. Ignatius of Loyola and eventually as the vicar general of the Society of Jesus, composed this two-volume set of EHI and AME as a meditation manual centering on the themes of salvation history to be celebrated throughout the liturgical year.22 EHI arranges 153 images in chronological sequence, but each scene bears a roman numeral that indicates its place in the liturgical calendar, by which AME organizes its textual amplifications on each theme. Though EHI was originally intended for Jesuit scholastics, Pope Clement VIII, funding the project, demanded that the book be available to all Christians.23 1 will first review the way EHI in conjunction with AME functioned as a meditative manual in the European context, and then discuss its structure and elements that were selectively presented and even highlighted in its Chinese edition, Jingjie. The Jesuits' meditative methodology of visualization traces back to Spiritual Exercises, which was written by the order s founder, St. Ignatius of Loyola, at first as an initiation manual to train their novices. Here he laid out a methodology cre- atively developing the long medieval tradition of envisioning, specifically those of Pseudo-Bonaventure and Ludolph of Saxony.24 EHI exploits one component of St. Ignatius s methodology to its full potential: the composition of place. In Spiritual Exercises, St. Ignatius directs as follows: The first prelude is a composition made by imagining the place. Here we should take notice of the following. When a contemplation or meditation is about something that can be gazed on, for example, a contemplation of Christ our Lord, who is visible, the composition consists of seeing in imagination the physical place where that which I want to contemplate is taking place. By physical place I mean, for instance, a temple or a moun- 22Both EHI and AME are available in modern publications.

The contemplation on the journey that Christ made from Bethany to Jerusalem for the Last Supper exemplifies the case best: "Here it will be to see in imagination the road from Bethany to Jerusalem, whether it is broad, or narrow, or level, and so on." Then, the reader should envision himself inside this mental space to accompany Jesus in the journey. Upon arrival he needs to behold and listen to the moment of the Last Supper, and finally have an imagi- nary conversation with the Lord: "The second point is to listen to what they are saying.. . . The third point is to see what they are doing.. . . Finish with colloquy to Christ our Lord." Participation in the mental imagery is more vividly spelled out in an earlier moment of Christ s nativity: "I will make myself a poor, little, and unworthy slave, gazing at them, contemplating them, and serving them in their needs, just as if I were there, with all possible respect and reverence."26 Thus, "the composition of place" demands that the reader not only imagine space, but also enter the mental imagery and engage in various activities such as journeying, wit- nessing, and even experiencing contact with the holy personage. Similarly, EHI aims to help its reader construct an imaginary virtual space to journey through. It provides a detailed view of the Holy Land in engravings, and guides the reader through a meticulously programmed itinerary with alphabetized captions.27 For example, in the scene of Jesus Entering Jerusalem (fig. 1) a series of alphabets mark specific motifs in the picture. They are linked to the relevant captions below the picture, relating the visual motifs to the verbal messages. The reader scans the image as a whole, finds the alphabet markings, turns to the captions, and comes back to the marked motifs in the picture, thus mentally circulating and journeying through the pictured space with the guidance of captions in alphabetical sequence. In other words, EHI provides a topography, in which a meditation practitioner is invited to take an imaginary journey. Topography and journeying have symbolic value: Christ s whole life was a journey. So would be the life of a Jesuit on a foreign mission, and eventually those of all the Christians on their spiritual quests. The mental journeying in the imagery of EHI is now to be amplified and enriched with AME. Once the pictorial itinerary in EHI is completed, the practitioner moves to the related chapter in AME, which contains sections of Gospel Readings, Adnotationes, and Meditationes.28 The second section, Adnotationes, takes up the brief captions of EHI and expands them with ample details and exegetical comments, in the same sequence and alphabetized division 25 Ignatius of Loyola: Spiritual Exercises and Selected Works, ed.

The Meditationes section does not have this division directly keyed to the EHI captions or the Adnotationes section; however, its content largely follows the same sequence. Its text urges the reader to meditate on the theological significances of the events illustrated in the EHI and fully recounted and interpreted in the Adnotationes section. For this purpose, it often adopts a method of colloquy between the reader and the holy personage, a method originated in the Spiritual Exercises. To conclude the journey, the reader travels the contemplative itinerary three times, first in the EHI engraving, next in the corresponding Adnotationes section, and finally in the Meditationes section, all in the same sequence indicated by the alphabetical markings.29 In the second and third stages of Adnotationes and Meditationes, one can always refer back to the first stage of EHI images to enhance and fuel one's progress in higher-level readings and meditations. Even though EHI was originally designed to work with AME as a pair to consummate the meditative program of Nadal, Aleni introduced only EHI to his Chinese audience under the title Jingjie in 1637. Gianni Criveller observed that AME served as the basis for another of Aleni's books, Tianzhu Jiangsheng Yanxing Jiliie [ 3ÇZÊF^íÉ1fÍT/1oB£ ] (Shortened record of the incarnation and ministry of the Heavenly Lord; hereafter Jilüe), published two years earlier than Jingjie.30 Aleni wrote in the preface of Jingjie that it would complete the earlier book, Jiliie. Also, in each scene of Jingjie, a reference to the corresponding section in Jiliie is given at the end of the captions. However, the content of Jiliie differs from that of AME in that Jiliie lacks the alphabetized structuring of AME, which is the key device that relates the text of AME to the images in EHI. Furthermore, despite Aleni's words in the preface, Nicolas Standaert points out that Jingjie and Jiliie were treated as separate writings in the seventeenth century and joined into one volume only in the nineteenth century.31 Thus, as far as the methodology of meditation is concerned, it seems that Jingjie was supposed to function basically by itself in China, whereas in Europe EHI and AME were devised to operate as a pair. While introducing only one of the pair into China, Aleni endeavored to reproduce the features of EHI very faithfully. There are some minor changes. Jingjie reduced the number of scenes from 153 to 57.32 A couple of scenes in Jingjie combine two consecutive scenes in EHI. The last scene of Mary's coronation was considerably altered in composition, probably reflecting a prototype that goes back to Albrecht Dürers famous scene in the Marienleben.33 Very rarely, though, a few details were transformed into Chinese fashion. Other than these, the 57 woodcuts faithfully reproduce the original scenes of EHI both in composition and 29Melion, "Memory, Place, and Mission," 603-4. 30Criveller, Preaching Christy 228-29; Standaert believes that Jilüe is a Chinese adaptation of Vita Christy which was written by Ludolph of Saxony and strongly inspired St. Ignatius of Loyola. See Stan- daert, "The Bible," 40. On the other hand, Sun Yuming argues that Jiliie was an eclectic excerpt from four Gospels with interlinear annotations done by Aleni; Sun, "Cultural Translatability" 476. 31 Standaert, "The Bible," 40. 3 Sun Yuming observes another version with fifty-one illustrations under a slightly different title, printed elsewhere shortly after 1637.

The scene of Jesus Entering Jerusalem in Jingjie (fig. 2) can be compared with its original in EHI (fig. 1). Faces, costumes, and settings were not altered. The alphabet markings, which relate the image to the captions below, remain the same. Aleni substituted Ganzhi [ ^p^ ], Chinese annual cyclical signs, for the Latin alphabet. Latin captions were translated into Chinese. The close adherence of Jingjie to the original EHI is sharply contrasted with the case of a rosary manual, Método de Rosário [ fiíê^íílía ] (Songnianzhu- guicheng), published by Ricas colleague Juan da Rocha (1565-1623) in 1608. This rosary manual also derived its fifteen scenes from EHI; however, they were ren- dered anew in Chinese style. In the Visitation scene (fig. 3), for example, a Chinese household setting replaced the European churchlike interior of the original EHIy which was preserved in Jingjie later (fig. 4). For such elements of sinicization, da Rocha's images have drawn art historians' attention far more than the conservative scenes of Jingjie, since da Rochas images appeared to suit the Jesuits' so-called accommodation policy better.34 Lin further observes that this setting of a Chinese noble house reflects the status of contemporary Chinese women converts and pos- sibly their house church.35 Most striking is the fact that the alphabet markings and captions disappeared completely in da Rocha's manual. The preservation of this structure is the key to understanding Jingjiés functional dimension. By publishing only EHI without its accompanying AME, Aleni sacrificed the three-level intensification of meditative procedure: viewing the images, reading the annotations, and immersing oneself in theological pondering. On the other hand, Aleni adhered to the original features of EHI very faithfully. It was observed that EHTs use of letters to relate image and text goes against the Chinese tradi- tion.36 Topographic scenery often appeared in contemporary blockprinted books in China, and notable places in the scene were marked with name inscriptions. Such verbal markings are similar to the letter markings in EHI; however, com- ments or explanations on those spots were conveyed in the body of the main text, not as the listing of captions directly keyed to the markings in the picture.37 None- theless, Aleni, basically an accommodationist not unlike Ricci, preserved the orig- inal structuring of EHI. By doing this, Aleni seems to have made his point very clearly: the meditative methodology associated with EHI was to be retained and underscored for his Chi- nese audience. This methodology is "the composition of place" and the mental 34On the sinicization in da Rochas manual, see Bailey, Jesuit Missions, 102-4. The concept of accommodation was actively applied by J. Bettray to the study of Jesuit art in Ricci's era; see J. Bettray, Die Akkommodationsmethode des P.

The primary catalyst for this method lay in the detailed, premium-quality engravings of EHI. The Adnotationes section in AME enriches the process that was already operating in the imagery of EHIy and the Meditationes section leads to a rather abstract, theological dimen- sion. Furthermore, when such methodology was introduced on foreign soil, image rather than text must have appealed more directly and strongly to the audience with different linguistic and textual traditions. Therefore, I believe, Aleni intro- duced only EHI and allowed almost no alteration in its composition and structur- ing, so that Jingjie would be fully operational for this methodology, exactly as it was with the European audience.38 Jingjie was introduced to a Chinese audience not merely as an amply illus- trated narrative, but as a meditative manual. That explains its strict preservation of the original features oiEHI, which also was essentially a manual. There are two reasons why I think Aleni introduced EHI as a meditative manual rather than a plain narrative. First, as a narrative, Aleni had already brought in Jilüe two years earlier. Secondly, to be a visual counterpart to such a textual narrative, Jingjie has too many digressions, namely, the verbal markings referring to the events much earlier and later than the major theme of a scene. This element, called "temporal displacement" by John Moffitt and "'disjonction de Tordre" by Pierre-Antoine Fabre, hinders the smooth chronological flow of the story line. If Aleni wanted to use EHI as a plain narrative, he could easily have removed such extrathematic inscriptions when EHI was rendered anew in woodcut. This displacement or dis- junction, though not efficient for the flow of narrative, was a powerful device to effect the meditative practice of compositio loci. Therefore, I argue, Jingjie was pre- sented to the Chinese as a manual in the manner of EHI. Indeed, in the preface of Jingjie, Aleni urged the readers to "meditate calmly" [ i£i£#iS ] (Momocunxiang) on the images: "and always going on a journey with the spirit of the Creator through the pages of the book in order to be enlight- ened and this could remain with the person."40 In this passage Aleni reiterates the element of mental journeying which is so characteristic of EHI.41 Kouduo Richao [Daily record of oral preaching], a source recording the religious life of the Fujian Christian community during the period 1630-40, clearly points out that Aleni 38Paul Rheinbay interprets Jingjiés conservatism in that EHI had already gained prominence and authority among Jesuits by that time and Aleni could not easily alter it. See Rheinbay, "NadaTs Reli- gious Iconography," 330; Criveller, on the other hand, believes that Aleni wanted and could create a complete and ample narration of salvation history. See Criveller, Preaching Christy 242; I think there is more to it. Aleni's adherence to the original EHI aimed to preserve the meditative structure and to keep it fully functional. 39John F. Moffitt suggests that this "temporal displacement" bears on the Ignatian meditative methodology, but he does not elaborate on this observation. See John F. Moffit, "Francisco Pacheco and Jerome Nadal: New Light on the Flemish Sources of the Spanish 'Picture-within-the-Picturer Art Bulle- tin 72, no. 4 (1990): 636-37. This element, renamed "disjonction de l'ordre," and its meditative force, is fully discussed by Pierre- Antoine Fabre, Ignace de Loyola: Le lieu de l'image (Paris: Vrin, 1992). 4üCriveller's translation in his Preaching Christ, 239.

However, he was opening up a truly intercultural dimension by publishing Jingjie in the original format of EHIy regardless of his awareness of doing so. The very methodology and visual structure he wanted to introduce had ample potential to penetrate into the Chinese religious culture. But this time, the intercultural accommodation would take place not with Confucianism, which had been Aleni s lifelong pursuit, but with Buddhism. The similarity to the Buddhist meditative method explains the long-lived success of Jingjie in China. Joseph Dehergne observes that Jingjie greatly promoted Aleni s later mission work. The book contin- ued to be printed in multiple editions all the way up to the nineteenth century. Criveller further points out that the book was printed in its original image set as late as the eighteenth century, and the significant variation and modification of images occurred only in the nineteenth century. In other words, Jingjie was favor- ably received by a Chinese audience in Aleni's format for nearly two centuries after its publication. The book's range of circulation also was notable. It spread far north to Beijing and contributed to the conversion of courtiers there. Dehergne and Celia von Collani even suggest that this book could have been transmitted to Korea.43 Journeying inside the Picture: Operating Tianzhu Jiangsheng Chuxiang Jingjie Two scenes in Jingjie illustrate the actual meditative process: Adoration of the Magi and Jesus Entering Jerusalem, which exemplify the construction of holy topography and the meditation as an imaginative journey through the pictorial space typical in the work. In the Adoration of the Magi (fig. 5), its traditional ico- nography appears conspicuously in the foreground. The Magi and their attendants kneel and stand in a row facing the Christ Child, held by his mother. The row of visitors forms a receding line that suggests the transit in the pictorial space and thus the journey that a meditation practitioner should join. More interesting are the various motifs scattered rather randomly throughout the wide panorama unfolded behind the protagonists. Following the order prescribed by letter mark- ings, the reader starts from Jia [ Ψ ], a Chinese equivalent to A. The captions are listed here in sequence. The first line gives translation and the second Chinese. Below them are the original captions from EHIy first in trans- lation, then in Latin. Captions in Jingjie largely correspond to those in EHIy but certain points were elaborated and some others were omitted.44 42Standaert, "The Bible," 50. ^Dehergne, "Une vie illustrée," 111, 113; Criveller, Preaching Christ, 241; Criveller, Impressions de chine, 112; Dehergne, "Une vie illustrée," 111-13; Claudia von Collani, "Die Chinamission von 1520-1630," in Die Zeit der Konfessionen, ed.

Jesus shows a miracle this day at the wedding banquet. EHI: Marriage at Cana of Galilee. Nutiae in Cana Galiliae. Originally the caption Ε in EHI mentions an ox and an ass in the stable, but this line was simply omitted in Jingjie. In A, C, F, and G, adverbial and redundant phrases were largely removed. However, in Ε (F in EHI) a more emphatic insertion says that the Magus could not continue to fix his gaze on Christ, probably because the divine solemnity and authority radiating from him was so powerful. In I, the Chinese caption gives more explanation on how the Magi could adopt a different way back home: The Lord told them to do so. Most interesting is K, where Aleni added the phrase "Jesus shows a miracle this day." The corresponding caption in EHI simply mentions "Marriage at Cana." By underscoring the moment of Jesus s first miracle, the caption in Jingjie plays an exegetical role more suitable for a Chi- nese audience, who were not familiar with biblical events. In Europe, such exeget- ical comments appeared in AME rather than in EHI. With these prescriptive captions, readers go on a mental journey inside the picture. The first letter Jia [ ψ ] or A is found in the background on the two gates of the town. Its caption gives the location of the main event, Bethlehem. Β is found at the top right corner and marks the star that the Magi have followed up to this place. Diagonally below appears the letter C, where the Magi with their attendants are just entering the gate. They will pass through the town and come out of the other gate in the center. Now their procession crosses the bridge, goes up a little hill to the left, and turns around to walk toward the foreground of the picture, where the major event of the Adoration takes place. In the protagonist group at the front, the letter D marks the Virgins seat. The letter Ε lies at the knees of the first king in adoration. The letters F and G respectively indicate the second and third kings in the row. The letter H leads the reader s attention farther back along the</page><page sequence="23">Shin / Holy Topography in Jesuit Spirituality &amp; Pure Land Buddhism 325 line, where the Magi's attendants stand at a distance. From here the reader has to make a leap to the background in the center of the composition to locate J, which indicates the Magi returning via a different road. So far, the reader's eyes have ambulated the whole picture, moving up and down, left and right, back and forth. The letter sequence does not have any consis- tent direction or geometric order. This irregularity or randomness of sequence seems to be intentional. It stimulates the attention and effectively engages the reader in the pictorial journeying, by literally walking around in this holy topog- raphy in search of the next letter. The reader's itinerary accompanying the Magi's travel ends with /, but his ambulation or pilgrimage goes further. The letter / appears at the top left corner, far in the distance. Here Jesus, identified by his halo, is baptized by John the Baptist. To its right one finds the letter Κ that marks the marriage banquet at Cana. These two events are not a part of the major theme here, the Adoration of the Magi, and they took place not in Bethlehem but in Bethabara (or Bethany) and Cana respectively. Why, then, were these later events incorporated into the background of the Adoration scene? This is exactly the reason why I do not regard Jingjie merely as a biblical narrative but as a meditation manual. The purpose of this picture is not only to narrate the life of Jesus, but to construct the topography of the Holy Land, where salvation history was enacted and consummated through the life of Jesus. Even though the Adoration of the Magi took place around the town of Bethlehem, the river Jordan and Cana also needed to appear in the same picture in order to constitute in full the geography of the Holy Land so that the reader can take a med- itative journey far beyond the town of Bethlehem following the steps of the Lord, who would later be baptized at the river Jordan and work a miracle at Cana. The inclusion of later or earlier events in the scene not only creates the full topography of the Holy Land, but also serves to trigger the meditative immersion by disrupting the normal narrative continuity. Fabre refers to this element as the disjonction of temporal and thematic narrative flow, pointing out as an example the appearance of the Crucifixion in the background of Annunciation. He argues that not only this disjunction, but also the letter markings inside the scene relating to the captions below, disrupt and break into the narrative continuity of the imag- ery, thus hindering the reading of images as narrative. By the disjunction and the letter-marking structure, the images of EHI compose and at the same time decom- pose the object and the very act of viewing.45 The disjunction of narrative flow, together with the désorientation, by which Fabre refers to the irregular, random arrangement of events throughout the pic- ture plane, transforms the scenes of EHI from "the place of representation" to "the representation of place."46 As EHI constructs a place, not a representation, the objects of viewing, namely the visual motifs and corresponding captions, appear and at the same time disappear. This transformation yields the space of the picture to one's imagination, the object of which, being not represented, is invisible in the middle of the visible in the scenes of EHI. Thus, the material place of representa- 45Fabre, Ignace de Loyola, 262, 265. 46Fabre, Ignace de Loyola, 266, 273-74.</page><page sequence="24">326 Sixteenth Century Journal XL/2 (2009) tion in EHI, through this transformation, turns into the interior place of imagina- tive meditation for the viewer. Therefore, the rhetorical devices of disjonction and désorientation shape EHI and its Chinese version Jingjie as meditative manuals rather than detailed narratives. Another scene depicts Jesus Entering Jerusalem (fig. 2). This scene is even more topographic and temporally disjunctive, synoptically combining numerous geographic and narrative motifs into one composition. The captions state as follows: Christ Entering Jerusalem [ AIfóftSciíÇU ] Ingressus solennis in civitatem A. Bethania, where Lazarus was raised from death. EHI: the same. Bethania, ubi Lazarus suscitatus. B. Mount of Olives near the town of Bethphage. EHI: the same. Mons olivarum. C. Apostles, following the order (of the Lord), draw the donkey and come. EHI: this visual motif and caption does not appear in the EHI. D. Stream of Cedron. τ. mmm EHI: the same. Torrens Cedron. E. Jesus riding a donkey approaches the city (of Jerusalem). EHI: Jesus the rider is carried on a young donkey. IESUS eques pullo asina vectus. F. Crowd, tearing and holding up the (palm) tree branches, gather around (Jesus); taking off and spreading their clothes on the road, they praise Jesus. EHI: This caption does not appear in EHI. The figure of a man spreading his clothes is marked by a letter only in Jingjie. G. The people of the city respectfully welcome Jesus as he comes in. EHI: Crowd of his travel. Eius celebritas itineris.</page><page sequence="25">Shin / Holy Topography in Jesuit Spirituality &amp; Pure Land Buddhism 'oil H. Christ enters the Temple and drives out the money changers. EHI: The Temple, to which Jesus comes, where he heals the blind and the crippled. Templum, quo venit IESUS, ubi sanat caecos et claudos. I. Jesus heals all the ill men. EHI: Caption H in EHI includes this message. Furthermore, in EHI the figures of Christ and the sick man are not marked with a letter. J. Mary, with all the holy women, beholds Jesus at a distance. EHI: Virgin Mother with women. Virgo Mater cum mulieribus. There are some additions and amplifications. In ß, Aleni added that the Mount of Olives is near the town of Bethphage, whereas EHI simply says "Mount of Olives." Bethphage is mentioned in the Gospels three times, all associated with Bethany. This insertion in Jingjie appears to be an effort to present the topography of the Holy Land as comprehensively as possible, even though the specific location of Bethphage does not bear much meaning. Most interesting would be F, where Jingjie describes the crowd waving palm tree branches in welcome and the men spreading their clothes on the ground. These motifs depicted prominently at the foreground of the picture are neither marked by a letter nor verbally described at all in EHI. Aleni may have wanted to highlight the glory of the moment to increase the dramatic impact of the scene on his Chinese audience. The motif of Jesus in the Temple was recounted in two captions, H and /, in Jingjie. H mentions his removal of money changers, which does not appear at all in the EHI caption, and / narrates his healing of the sick. In G and /, captions became more descriptive and richer in Jingjie. Basically the tactic of visual ambulation works here; the irregularity of the route is quite similar to the Adoration scene. The captions here serve to construct in full the topography of the Holy Land even more than in the Adoration scene. The letter A marks Bethany, where Lazarus was resuscitated. This is another- and probably the most moving- miracle that precedes Jesus's entry into Jerusalem. To the left, the letter Β indicates the Mount of Olives, where Jesus was met by the wel- coming crowd (Mark 11:1-10) and from which he would later ascend into heaven (Acts 1:2-12). Also near the foot of the Mount of Olives was the Garden of Geth- semane, where Jesus spent the last night of agony (Luke 22:39). The letter D points to the stream of Cedron or Kidron, which also augurs the events of Christ's arrest and Passion. Jesus crossed Kidron to get into a garden and was arrested there (John 18:1). The letter Η marks the Temple inside the city walls and its caption says that Jesus drove out the money changers here. Right below the Temple the letter /leads the reader to see another miracle of Jesus s healing of the sick.</page><page sequence="26">328 Sixteenth Century Journal XL/2 (2009) These letters and accompanying captions introduce numerous events that precede and follow the moment of Jesus s entry into Jerusalem. They point out var- ious locations associated with Christ's ministry, Passion, and even final glory. All these names such as Bethany, Bethphage, Mount of Olives, and the brook of Kidron consummate the topography of the Holy Land. If this picture was made merely to illustrate the event of Christs entry into Jerusalem, which took place in front of the Jerusalem gate, it did not need to include such additional geographic motifs. In other words, this picture with captions serves to present in full detail the mental map of the Holy Land for an imaginative journey. Would this method of journeying through the pictorial space have stricken the Chinese audience as a novelty? On the contrary, I believe the Chinese found it very familiar and easy to comprehend, exactly as they had felt about the rosary, unintelligible Latin chant, and exorcism in Catholicism. This familiarity came from the meditative and visual tradition of Buddhism that had taken root in China thousands of years earlier. It was especially from the school of Pure Land Buddhism, which had been very dominant in the devotional culture of Chinese people. Pure Land Buddhism and the Contemplation Sutra [ Ü^tJklPIS ] The Contemplation Sutra [ MMikW0L ] (Guanwuliangshoujing), one of the three major sutras of Pure Land Buddhism, expounds a meditative methodology very similar to that of Jingjie. Its meditative methodology was at work in the south- ern China of the late Ming Dynasty. Pure Land Buddhism was a very influential school, with its teaching and doctrine deeply infiltrating other schools such as Chan [ i? ] and Tiantai [ ^"p ]. These two schools adopted Pure Land Buddhisms simpler and more directly appealing eschatological theology as an easily accessible and practical way of devotion.47 Especially for the populace, rebirth in Buddha Amitabhas Pure Land by completely relinquishing the self to his compassion appeared to be a more feasible and blissful reward than the ascetic and often eso- teric Chan doctrine of realizing the truth and entering Nirvana by one's own apti- tude and effort. The Pure Land notion of attaining afterlife reward by faith and devotion is indeed very close to that of Christianity. Pure Land Buddhism provided a number of devotional methodologies to attain the blissful rebirth in the Pure Land. One that was embraced by virtually all of the Buddhist schools was the envisioning of the Pure Land, its holy topography, expounded in the Contemplation Sutra. The topography of the Pure Land was typ- ically represented by an eighth-century mural of Contemplation Sutra Bianxiangtu [ UÍÊI H ] (the picture of the transformed manifestation of Pure Land) in Dun- huangcave 172.48 47Shinko Mochizuki, History of Pure Land Theology in China [ ψ W'ft±&amp;M£. ] (Kyoto: Hozo- kan, 1964), 458; Chen, "Alenis Mission," 435-36; This situation is surprisingly similar to the case of contemporary Korea; see J. M. Shin, "The Iconographie Surrogate: Contemplating Amitabha Image in the Late Koryo Dynasty," Archives of Asian Art 55 (September, 2005): 1-15, at 5. 48 Chinese Cave Art: Dunhuang Mogao Caves [ ψ IS ^5" Ä : WC'ïaHÎfàm ], vol. 4 (Tokyo: Heibonsha, 1982), pl. 9.</page><page sequence="27">Shin / Holy Topography in Jesuit Spirituality &amp; Pure Land Buddhism 329 According to the sutra, the practice of visualizing the Pure Land will absolve one of accumulated sins and enable him to achieve salvation, that is, rebirth in the Pure Land.49 The method of visualization proceeds through sixteen stages. The first stage directs one to contemplate not the imaginary but the actual sun setting in the West, which is the direction of the universe where Buddha Amitabha resides. This stage serves as a triggering device to immerse the practitioner in the meditative visualization. The following stages narrate the elaborate and fantastic descriptions of the water, ground, trees, and beautiful pavilions in the Pure Land, which are all radiant with multicolored gleaming crystals and jewels. The fifth stage instructs the practitioner to envision the eight lakes in the Pure Land. This part is especially important, since the believer will be reborn inside a lotus flower floating on one of these lakes. In the Land of Utmost Bliss [Pure Land], there are eight lakes, and the waters of each lake are made of seven kinds of soft and yielding jewels. The water flows out from the wish-granting jewel, dividing into fourteen streams. Each stream is tinged with the colors of the seven kinds of jewels and flows in a channel of yellow gold, the bed of which is covered entirely with sand of multicolored adamants.5 All these hyperbolic descriptions serve as a psychological device to initiate the practitioner s imaginative meditation, similar to the way that the detailed imagi- nary depictions of Christ s life narrative in Jingjie orient the Catholic viewer to meditation. The meditative methodology of visual imagination, as instructed by Pseudo- Bonaventure and Ludolph of Saxony, and eventually inherited by the Jesuits, was to be triggered by amplifying the details.51 The brief account of the gospel pro- vided only the narrative skeleton, around which the practitioner was invited to expand in imagination minute details such as the costumes of holy personages, their demeanor, buildings, trees, and hills that would eventually construct the whole space where the theme of meditation was to be reenacted. Detailed images in EHI serve to assist the practitioner in this mode of meditation by demonstrating the very procedure. Similarly, the sutras detailed descriptions of colorful lakes and streams, jewel trees, beautiful pavilions, with grandiose deities inhabiting them lead the Buddhist practitioner to create in mind a holy space. The fantastic splen- dor of the lakes was convincingly represented in a fourteenth -century Korean Bianxiangtu, the prototype of which was a contemporary Chinese iconography imported through the port of Ningbo, Zhejiang province (fig. 6). One can even see a monk and a layperson reborn on the lotus blossom. 49Wu Hung, "Reborn in Paradise: A Case Study of Dunhuang Sutra Painting and Its Religious, Ritual and Artistic Context," Orientations 23, no. 5 (1992): 52-60, at 57. 50The Sutra of Contemplation on the Buddha of Immeasurable Life as Expounded by Sakyamuni Buddha (hereafter Contemplation Sutra), trans. Ryukoku University Translation Center under the direction of Meiji Yamada (Kyoto: Ryukoku University, 1984), 39. 51 See n24 above.</page><page sequence="28">330 Sixteenth Century Journal XL/2 (2009) The text of the sutra aims to assist a practitioner in mentally building the imaginary topography of the Pure Land as vividly as he or she perceives it and even walks on its holy ground. Stages 7 through 13 deal with the visualization of physical features and the grandeur of Buddha Amitabha and his attending bodhisattvas. These figures are not simply the ruler-occupants of the land, but they actually form the focal point of topography with their central location in par- adise, which is clearly shown in the Dunhuang mural Bianxiangtu. Stages 14 through 16 are assigned to visualization of the practitioner himself at the time of dying and consequent rebirth in the Pure Land. This is the stage where the meditation practitioner visualizes himself within the holy topography and becomes a part of his own imaginative meditation, as the reader oijingjie is urged to walk with and even talk to the holy personage inside the picture. Accord- ing to the believers spiritual aptitude and accumulation of sin, there are nine levels of rebirth: three grades subdivided into three ranks. In the case of a person belong- ing to the lowest rank of the highest grade: He [the practitioner] sees himself seated on a golden lotus flower. When he sits down on that lotus flower, the flower closes, and following behind the World Honored One [Buddha], he immediately attains birth in that seven-jeweled lake.... After three weeks ... he then travels to each of the ten quarters and serves all the buddhas. In the presence of these buddhas, he listens to the most profound teachings.52 As with Jingjie, here also the practitioner not only visualizes the holy topography, but enters the visualized Pure Land to be reborn, travel, meet with and hear from the Buddhas. This motif of the practitioner, reborn in imagination in the Pure Land and hearing profound teachings from a Buddha there, was represented prominently in the fourteenth-century Korean Bianxiangtu (fig. 7). In order to assist this sixteen-part visualization, the panorama of the Pure Land was amply represented under the title of Contemplation Sutra Bianxiangtu since the Tang Dynasty.54 A diagram of its later Japanese version closely preserves its original iconography from the Dunhuang cave (fig. 9). In the center of the com- position sits the Buddha Amitabha, flanked by his attending two bodhisattvas and multiple functionary deities. We can see the jewel trees, pavilions, and most signif- icantly the gleaming jeweled lotus lakes in the foreground. This Bianxiangtu was not made merely to be a representation of the Pure Land, but, not unlike }ingjiey as a meditative aid.55 It serves to facilitate a meditation practitioners mental recre- ation of the Pure Land and eventually an imaginary journey through it. ^Contemplation Sutra, 91-93. 53This motif became very conspicuous in later Bianxiangtu, and it was transmitted to and popu- larly represented in Korea and Japan. Concerning this motif in the Korean Bianxiangtu, see J. M. Shin, "The Face-to-Face Advent of the Amitabha Triad: A Fifteenth-Century Welcoming Descent," Cleve- land Studies in the History of Art 6 (2001): 28-47, at 33.

By looking into the icon- ographie transmission and the documentary evidences of Ming Dynasty Bud- dhism, it is evident that the same formulation of meditative methodology associated with visual representation is presented in Jingjie. It is important to understand that the cave complex in Dunhuang served as an iconographie repository for Chinese Buddhist art in the later eras. This Pure Land Bianxiangtu also continued to serve as a prototype for later representations, and its Southern Song Dynasty iconography survived in a couple of paintings presently owned by Japanese temples (fig. 8). There the side bands display the sixteen objects of Pure Land visualization rather than the narrative of Buddha Sakyamuni expounding the method, which means that the Bianxiangtu has become even more functionally focused to facilitate the contemplation. Southern Song Bianxiangtu as well as other Pure Land iconographies were amply exported through the port of Ningbo in Zhejiang province to Korea and Japan.56 Its Japanese version, termed Taima Mandala, continued to be made as late as the seventeenth century (fig. 9). Ningbo in Zhejiang province is near the adja- cent province of Fujian. Even though a Bianxiangtu of this type made in early sev- enteenth-century Fujian had not yet come to light, the wide circulation of the iconography throughout the whole Far East leads me to believe that it existed and functioned in the area and time of Aleni s mission activity. Since the practice of sixteen-view visualization was very closely associated with the making and view- ing of the Pure Land Bianxiangtu,57 as long as the meditation methodology was at work, there needed to be its visual aids. Literary evidence indicates that the meth- odology was certainly extant in the seventeenth century and even later. The history of Pure Land Buddhism in the Ming Dynasty documents multi- ple references to the Contemplation Sutra and its method of sixteen-view visualiza- tion. Particularly significant are the writings and teachings of three prominent monks: Zhuhung [ 1*S ] (1535-1615), Chuandeng [ AM ] (1554-1627), and Zhixu [ H?jlE ] (1599-1655). Of course, many other Buddhist theologians wrote on the sutra, which continued to be effective in the following Qing Dynasty.58 Zhu- hung was born and primarily active in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, where inter- estingly Aleni came a year after Zhuhung s death and stayed for the next eight years before moving further south to Fujian. The Jesuits' mission activity was already fully operating in Zhuhung's lifetime. Zhuhung's debate with Matteo Ricci on the Buddhist doctrine of Nonkilling and Reincarnation is documented, and attests to the tension between the two religions.59 56Shin, "Face-to-Face Advent," 37-38.

The other one, the contemplation of image [ ÜS^ ] (Guanxiang), involves the viewing of Buddhas icon.63 It is interesting that Zhu- hung was essentially associating the practice of meditations, in both kinds, with the visual experience of images: the former with a Bianxiangtu, the latter with an icon. Ήantai monk Chuandeng [ fi|JJ§: ] (1554-1627), a native of Zhejiang province, left a literature directly commenting on the Pure Land Bianxiangtu. Among the numerous volumes he wrote on Pure Land Buddhism is found a title Eulogies on Contemplation Sutra Bianxiangtu [ H IMBUÍS ] (Guanjingtusong) composed in 1604, thirty- three years before the publication oijingjie. This work discusses the merit of Pure Land Bianxiangtu, which was to be used as a visual template for sixteen-view visualization. Complementing the lack of visual evidence surviving today, this book attests to the fact that not only the meditation method but also the associated Bianxiangtu continued to be produced and used for meditation as late as the early seventeenth century. In the previous year of 1603, Chuandeng also discussed the importance of the sixteen-view visualization method in Treatise on the Birth or Non-Birth in the Pure Land [ &amp; ±^M^vm ] (Jingtusheng- wushenglun). This book was widely circulated among the intellectuals so that an exegesis on it was published by his pupil Zhengji [ ÃEM ] in 1612, and another one by Shoujiao [ ^Mi ]in 1616. It continued to be mentioned and discussed as late as in the nineteenth-century Qing Dynasty.64 The third monk, Zhixu, lived at the very end of the Ming Dynasty, the same time as Aleni s major activity and the publication oijingjie. Zhixu is known to have read Alenfs summary of a discussion with non-Christian literati in Fuzhou.65 He traveled widely in the southern provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and signifi- cantly Fujian, disseminating his teachings.66 In 1654 he compiled Ten Essential Worte of the Pure Land Doctrine [ í^zh+ll ] (Jingtushiyao) and included here 60 Chen, "Alenis Mission," 443, 445-46; Yii, Renewal of Buddhism, 47-52. 61Sheng'yan [ UScí&amp;frlí ], Studies on Late Ming Buddhism [ ty'M%%kW$t ] (Taipei: Dongchu Chubanshe, 1999), 171. 62Yü, "Renewal of Buddhism," 199, 219-21.

It is known that Zhixu intended to write Synop- tic Selections of Exegeses on the Contemplation Sutra [ WLKÊtfàSP&amp;Bí ] (Guanjing- shuchaoluyao), but never finished. Especially in his later years, he relied heavily on the Contemplation Sutra in order to achieve his own rebirth in the Pure Land.68 Not only professional monks, but also lay literati were actively participating in the belief and practice of Pure Land Buddhism. Zhuang Guanghai [ itHiS ], a native of Zhejiang province, published the six-volume Collection of Nourishing Materials of the Pure Land [ ?#±fííi4k|l ] ( Jingtuziliangquanji) in 1594. Here he urges practitioners to conduct the calling of Amitabhas name [ ^ i% ] (Nianfo) and the visualization of the sixteen views of Pure Land. Yuan Hongdao [ 3Ü SS ü[ ] (1568-1610), a renowned member of the literati of the time, was also a devout Pure Land Buddhist. In 1599 he published Assembled Discussions on the Western Paradise [ ffi^^fra ] (Xifanghelun), in which the chapter on Cultivation [ {&amp;W ] (Xiuchi) discusses the merits of practicing sixteen-view visualization. When he died in 1614, his brother Zhongdao [ Φ3Ϊ ] dreamt that Hongdao [ ^il ] was reborn in the Pure Land.69 Considering that visionary or pseudovisionary experi- ences were usually triggered by habitual exposure to visual images, Zhongdaos dream experience may suggest that Pure Land Bianxiangtu with its prominent depiction of the lotus pond in the foreground was extant and circulating at the time. * * * Clearly, the meditative methodology of Pure Land Buddhism, which had deeply affected the Chinese visual experience of devotion since the Tang Dynasty, was still operating when Aleni introduced a similar method of visually oriented contemplation, expounded in the Jesuits' prominent achievement of the late Renaissance EHL The Pure Land meditative methodology definitely predisposed the Chinese audience to be fully susceptible to EHIs Chinese version, Jingjie, which continued to circulate widely in the following centuries. This was the moment when the visual experiences of two great religions, one of the West and one of the East, became acculturated. The successful reception of Jingjie in Chi- nese indigenous visual and devotional culture brings to light a hitherto lightly explored issue in the Eurocentric historiography of Renaissance art: the global contact of Europe with an alien but analogical civilization.70 oa 67Mochizuki, History of Pure Land, 467; for the list of books included in Ten Essential Works of the Pure Land Doctrine [ ί^±+1Ι ] (Jingtushiyao), see Sheng'yan, Late Ming Buddhism, 1 13. 68ShengVan, Chinese Buddhism, 277, 306-7. 69Mochizuki, History of Pure Land, 483-84. 70My research interest in this aspect of the Renaissance was first inspired by Claire Farago's bold thesis presented in the introduction to Reframing the Renaissance: Visual Culture in Europe and Latin America, 1450-1650 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995). I further acknowledge the inspiration I drew from Gauvin Alexander Baileys Art on the Jesuit Missions in Asia and Latin America: 1542-1773 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999).</page></plain_text>
