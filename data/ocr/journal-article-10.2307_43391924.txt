<plain_text><page sequence="1">Open Marsh Water Management: Impacts on Tidal Wetlands Don Riepe* American Littoral Society, Broad Channel, NY Introduction Salt marshes have been subject to many undermin- ing influences through the ages: some natural, some anthropomorphic. While natural forces wore away at marshes, they also compensated by creating young marshlands as new estuaries were formed and as tide levels moved upland. Human intervention, however, has had significant negative impacts upon marshes that threaten their presence. A primary driving force has been the obsession to rid marshes of mosquitoes. One of the major activities of the mosquito-control endeavor has been the digging of ditches through salt marshes (Figure 1). The objective was to drain water off the high marsh to deprive the salt marsh mosquito of its wet breeding ground while, at the same time, creating paths for (mosquito-eating) killifish to access the high marsh. Then, about 50 yrs ago, digressing from the grid ditch layout, Open Marsh Water Management (OMWM) was promoted and practiced by mosquito- control agencies and wetland managers . This approach sought to replace the straight-line ditching technique with curved ditching and pond excavations (Figure 2). Although the shapes of the ditches may have changed, the fragmentation of the marshes continued. Institutionalization of Mosquito Ditches Digging ditches in marshes for mosquito control was taking place at the turn of the twentieth century. During the economic depression of the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was created by the US government as a work relief program for unemployed men. It focused on natural resource "conservation" and lasted from 1933 to 1942. The Work Projects Administration (WPA), created during the Franklin D . Roosevelt presidency, also helped put people to work. One of the activities of these New Deal programs was the assignment to dig trenches in salt marshes. *driepe@aol.com With little foresight into future consequences to the marsh, members of CCC camps dug and main- tained mosquito ditches in New Jersey and Delaware. Ditches were set at a standard distance of either 100 or 150 ft apart and usually arranged in a surveyed straight-line design. Often they intersected, creating a rectangular or square grid design. Between 1933 and 1942, the CCC dug mosquito ditches throughout 248,000 ac of marshlands in Delaware. WPA workers contributed by digging 15,000 mi of new ditching along the Atlantic Coast (Vileisis 1997). In 1933, a Director of Mosquito Extermination was appointed in Rhode Island, and ditching commenced; several hundred acres of salt marshes were drained in the first 2 mo of the program (University of Rhode Island 2009). The peat was cut with a saw, spaded into blocks, and levered out of the marsh. By 1938, 19,000 ac of marsh were ditched in Nas- sau County, Long Island, and ditching was underway in adjacent Suffolk County (Taylor 1938). In Flori- da, WPA workers constructed 1500 mi of ditches by hand or with explosives (University of Florida 2009). Even while these activities were taking place, the New York State entomologist wrote of "the organized protest against the continued extension of mosquito control work. This protest was prompted by fear that unnecessary harm to the wildlife habitats might re- sult..." (Glasgow 1938). With most marshes ditched along the eastern seaboard of the United States, with rising concerns for marsh-dependent wildlife other than mosquitoes, and with the mosquitoes still breeding en masse on the marshlands, an alternative design was demanded. Mosquito-control agencies turned their attention to OMWM, which proposed to curve the ditches and direct them to mosquito breeding areas on the marsh. Where clusters of breeding areas occurred, marsh would be dug out, and a pond would form. Although the format of marsh excavations changed, the concept remained the same: eliminate mosquito breeding habitat on the marsh (at the expense of marsh terrain) and route the killifish to the high marsh. 80 Tidal Marshes of Long Island, Torrey Botanical Society</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1.

However, the idea of enlisting killifìsh to eat mosquito larvae is not novel. As we look back to the beginnings of marsh manipulations, we see that the origins of OMWM actually lie with the first spades that dug ditches into salt marshes (Figure 3). In a 1902 report on mosquito occurrence in New Jersey, Robinson noted: "I never found a larva in wa- ter where these fish were living. Therefore, if ditches were cut from the creeks to the inland pools fish would run the whole length of them and keep them entirely free from larvae" (Smith 1904). He indicated that ditch-pond connections existed before 1904: "There are many large ponds and pools: all are stocked with fish. Old ditches cut many years ago run to these ponds and pools." Emptying of marsh pools and cov- ering them with peat also took place at the outset of ditching. Smith (1904) noted that in another marsh "every pool was drained and the larvae and pupae were killed. Many ditches were cut and the sods taken out were used to fill the old breeding holes." Glasgow (1938) wrote: "development of mosquitoes on the salt marsh is discouraged by providing readier access to the marsh for the 'wiggler' eating killifish..." The idea of blocking ditches to sequester killifish also had its beginning early in the last century. Many ditches were fitted with tide gates that were raised to allow fresh incoming tidewater to enter the ditches. During outgoing tides, the gates were manually lowered to retain water and killifish in the ditches (Figure 4, Richards 1938). By 1904, machinery was on the marsh to expedite ditch-digging (Figure 5). Marshes were landscaped with endless arrays of ditches, many with peat piled alongside (Figure 6). Ditches were dug in straight lines from the shore to the upland border of marshes. They were also dug from shore to ponds, thus, estab- lishing a killifish-ditch-pond association. Today, OMWM exists with a loose definition. Some refer to it as plugging ditches with peat or plywood to keep dtichwater stocked with killifish. But as early as 1938, ditch tidegates were performing this task. Others espouse OMWM as the excavation of ponds to accommodate high marsh residency of killifish. Again, we see that as early as 1902, this concept was forwarded. When evaluating OMWM, it is important to distinguish which variation is being considered. 82 Tidal Marshes of Long Island, Torrey Botanical Society</page><page sequence="4">Figure 5.

About 1915, one of the earliest marsh projects on Long Island for the purpose of mosquito control took place in and around Jamaica Bay. "New York City undertook the task of ditching all the Jamaica Bay marshes." More than 6 million feet of drainage ditches were placed. Richards (1938) noted that, in 1916, "original plans called for a Nassau-Suffolk mosquito extermination commission; but due to indifference on the part of the residents of Suffolk County, the law was amended to provide a county commission in Nassau County only." Needless to say, Suffolk County has since become quite active in mosquito control. Ditches on Long Island were installed by machines, manual labor, and dynamite (Richards 1938). They were originally dug to drain water and "allow more accessibility of all parts of the marsh to killifish. This technic has been called 'concentrating the water on the marshes in the ditches' "(Richards 1938). Richards went on to discuss "main ditches receiving numerous spurs." From this early citing, we see that OMWM is simply a new acronym for digging ditches. In describing early reconsiderations of ditching designs, Richards noted: "Much of the early New York City ditching was done on the old 'checkerboard' system. Parallel ditches are now known to be fully as satisfactory. Accordingly, on of the activities of the New York City Commission under WPA has been to fill the cross ditches." So, after grid ditches were dug, mosquito control backtracked. Refilling ditches was already taking place in the course of 1930s mosquito control, while new ditches continued to be dug. Contemporary OMWM in Suffolk County now advertises 'marsh restoration' by filling ditches. In the manner of its predecessors, it continues to fill ditches while simultaneously digging new ones. Richards, in 1938, noted: "Filling followed by proper grading eliminates the possibility of breed- ing." The OMWM technique of sidecasting and back- blading is a modern version of that 1938 concept. Of particular interest is the reference to ponds: "The Suf- folk County Mosquito Extermination Commission has dug several ponds in the marshes along the barrier beach south of Shinnecock Bay and connected these ponds with the bay by ditches. The idea of building such ponds is to allow resting places, especially for ducks during bad weather" (Figure 7). Open Marsh Water Management: A Brief History The concept of OMWM made its debut in print in the Proceedings of the New Jersey Mosquito Extermi- nation Association in 1968. The goal of OMWM was to replace the rigid straight-line ditching approach to mosquito management with an approach that focused on areas of the marsh that bred mosquitoes (Ferrigno and Jobbins 1968). As the salt marsh mosquito ( Ochlerotatus sollici- tans ) passes through its developmental cycle, it needs a brief period of submergence in water. The tempo- ral body of water may be as small as a depression in the marsh. The OMWM proposal recommended that depressions capable of hosting mosquito breeding be connected to tidal ditches. This is promoted to ensure tidal circulation that brings with it mosquito-eating killifish. Although some existing ditches could be used (or abandoned) in the new treatment, many new ones would be needed. In areas with high concentrations of mosquito breeding, ponds were to be built to incorporate mul- tiple depressions. The ponds, in turn, are connected to a constructed tidal ditch network. "These ponds also provide resting, nesting, and feeding sites for many birds and increase the hunting opportunity of an area (Ferrigno et al. 1967). Initial guidelines for OMWM appeared in a 1985 report by the Mosquito Control Sector of the Dela- ware Department of Natural Resources. The paper reads: "Open Marsh Water Management is a method for controlling salt-marsh mosquitoes using physical alteration of marsh habitat. Ponds and ditches are se- lectively excavated in order to create unsuitable en- virons for mosquito eggs and larvae while creating suitable habitat for larvi vorous fishes." The princi- pal features of the practice are: "1) use and location of open tidal ditches; 2) interspersion of open tidal ditches with closed, non-tidal ponds and pond radial ditches; 3) use of semi-tidal sill ditches and ponds" (Meredith et al. 1985). Open Marsh Water Management gave new impetus to those looking to manage marshes. Many variation of OMWM have appeared in different marsh and mu- nicipal settings. Although ditches blocked with marsh peat or plywood boards has been called OMWM, it does not accurately represent the intent of its origina- tors. The OMWM model is ditch and pond excava- tions on or near mosquito breeding sites. However, OMWM often becomes an elaborate system of ponds and ditches sprawling the marsh. 84 Tidal Marshes of Long Island, Torrey Botanical Society</page><page sequence="6">Figure 7. An artificial pond excavated in a salt marsh, with mosquito ditching connected to it (1938). Ditches were dug to drain standing water from the marsh and lead killifish to high marsh. Ponds were dug for ducks. 1 CO S3 S &lt;D $ 00 1 £ &lt;ü Z Figure 8. The gentleman (left) is standing beside a ditch that has filled in naturally in Jamaica Bay, NY (1938).

A ditch plug at Seatuck NWR. This ditch was plugged for a length of 2 ft (between the arrows) with adjacent peat that was shovelled in. When tidewater flowed over the high marsh and receded back to the bay, water was detained in the portion of the ditch above the plugs and on the surrounding marsh, but drained below the plug. Vegetation died off, and open water took the place of much of the high marsh. 3 I *2 W c O *- i Figure 10. Although wading birds and waterfowl are attracted to the artificial ponds at Seatuck NWR, much marsh has been sacrificed. Above, we see an expanse of former high marsh that is now submerged between two ditches as a result of plugging. Ditches on Long Island were typically 150 ft apart. Twenty-five yrs after plugging, the peat that was originally piled alongside ditches is visible protruding above water level (arrows). D g £ tli S S Impacts of Ditch Plugging on Long Island The initial design of mosquito control ditches on Long Island was linear ditching in either a grid or parallel pattern. As early as the 1930s, some passive restoration was taking place on the marshes, not due to intent, but due to neglect. Within two decades, many ditches began to fill with silt as their sidewalls slumped or as part of the natural process of accretion (Figure 8). To counter natural forces that were mending the marsh, many ditches were redredged during "maintenance procedures." Many marshes on the South Shore of Long Island also had ponds dug in them. Ponds were features to accommodate ducks (Richards 1938) and, in turn, duck hunting. These artificial duck ponds predated OMWM. However, the ponds often had ditches leading to them. The ditch-pond association was thus established in advance of OMWM. Once OMWM became a design entity in the 1960s, the linear layout of ditches was supplanted by the combination of ditches and artificial ponds. A modification of OMWM was also used in many cases, whereby ditches were plugged, and the retained tidewater was allowed to remain, not only in the ditches, but on adjacent marsh area. This created "open water" on the marsh. So, when referring to OMWM, it is important to clarify whether "Ditch- plug OMWM" or "Artificial Pond OMWM" is used. Much of the initial OMWM took place on the marshes of New Jersey. Nearby states of Maryland, Delaware, and Rhode Island then tried OMWM on coastal marsh areas. By 1983, Connecticut and Massachusetts began to experiment with it (Hruby et al. 1985). Then, in 1984, OMWM was introduced to Long Island at Seatuck National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in Islip (Lent et al. 1990) by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). In New York, tidal wetlands are found on Long Island and along the southern Hudson River. But, on Long Island, it is primarily in Suffolk County where OMWM is being aggressively pursued. At Seatuck NWR in Suffolk County, ditch-plug OMWM was employed (Figure 9). It was simply a matter of digging peat from a nearby "borrow site" and filling in a 2 ft section of ditch (Hruby 1988). However, the effect of these minor ditch plugs were significant. Tidewater was retained behind the 2 ft peat dams and effected ditches permanently filled with water. Excess water that overflowed the ditches formed extensive bodies of open water on the high marsh (Figure 10). i 86 Tidal Marshes of Long Island, Torrey Botanical Society</page><page sequence="8">Figure 11.

A sign at entrance of West Sayville County Park. S g c£ ni e JS o Following Seatuck, a 1988 OMWM project took place on a New York State Department of Environ- mental Conservation (NYSDEC) marsh at Fireplace Neck in Shirley. This marsh is at the mouth of the Carmans River on Long Island's South Shore. Ditch plugs of peat were again employed. Ditch spurs were added in the outline. The site plan for the project also recommended marine-grade plywood for reinforce- ment of the ditch plugs (Hruby 1988). The USFWS then directed OMWM ditch plugging at West Sayville County Park (Figures 11, 12, 13). In 1994, ditches were blocked with 4 ft x 4 ft sheets of plywood with peat placed behind them. Water was re- tained; standing pools of water became more numer- ous on the marsh (Suffolk 2006a). The potential to create more bodies of open water on the marsh for game ducks attracted the attention of Ducks Unlimited (DU, a national duck hunting group) , which became a visible participant in future OMWM projects on Long Island. With DU's interest, the Long Island Wetlands Restoration Initiative (LIWRI) was formed, embracing a formal partnership among DU and USFWS, NYSDEC, and Suffolk County Division of Vector Control (SCDVC, Figure 14).

Note areas where ditches are plugged (arrows). S g &lt;£ p-i c -C 5 Figure 16. Duck blind on high marsh on Long Island. o g &lt;£ w 8 J3 S In its 1997 annual report, LIWRI disclosed its plan to restore 10,000 acres of tidal wetlands on Long Island over the following decade. Although its definition of restoration was not explicit, OMWM became a central objective (USFWS 1997). The report divulged its tidal wetland restoration project on a 420-ac portion of salt marsh at the mouth of the Carmans River. Half the project was on the west salt marsh of Wertheim NWR and the other half was on the adjoining tidal wetland owned and managed by the NYSDEC. In a form of OMWM, over 200 plugs were placed in the manmade ditches that had been present since the 1930s. In the report, the marsh was hailed as "successfully restored" (Figure 15). The extent of OMWM application on Long Island was escalated in 1997 when the Long Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex secured funding to purchase an amphibious excavator to be used on tidal wetlands. This enabled larger scale excavations for ponds and accessory ditches in Long Island salt marshes. Ducks Unlimited was instrumental in obtaining the funding. In its plans for 1998, the LIWRI looked towards projects at Beaver Dam Creek in Bellport and the east marsh of Wertheim NWR. Although the restoration project at Beaver Dam Creek primarily entailed removal of dredge spoil from a 10-ac tidal wetland, it has often been referred to on Long Island as an OMWM project. The project at the east marsh of Wertheim was similar to that of the prior west marsh project, whereby existing ditches received plugs of peat to negate the draining effect. By 2000, DU was assuming a leading role in OMWM on Long Island. The USFWS approved a grant of $295,500 for the LIWRI with DU as the grantee. The funding was to go towards restoration that would, among other things, "increase protection from erosion and storm tides, improve water quality" (USFWS 2000). Duck hunting would also benefit (Figure 16). The National Park Service (NPS) has resisted OMWM on Fire Island and at Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge on western Long Island. However, the NPS acceded to the trend and hosted a ditch-plug OMWM pilot project at the William Floyd Estate marsh in Mastic Beach on the South Shore of Long Island. Wil- liam Floyd Estate was donated in 1965 to Fire Island National Seashore, which is managed by the NPS. Its marshes were grid ditched in the 1930s-1940s. Ducks Unlimited visited the site in the late 1990s; subse- quently ditches were dammed with plywood. During the winter of 1999-2000, a backhoe was brought onto the marsh. It was used to knock plywood sheets into ditches to serve as plugs. Partnering in the project were USFWS, NPS, SCDVC, and DU. Ducks were attracted to the open water on the marsh (Figures 16- 20). Although duck hunting is not allowed on NPS grounds, hunters may sit and hunt from boats offshore or in water channels during duck hunting season. 88 Tidal Marshes of Long Island, Torrey Botanical Society</page><page sequence="10">Figure 17.

The impacts of detaining water by plugging the ditches have been traumatic to the high marsh: large areas have been flooded with salt water, suffocating and denuding large areas of vegetation. 3 I £ w G JS O •- &gt; Again, in 2001, "the LIWRI, under the leadership of Ducks Unlimited, conducted OMWM in the Flanders Bay Wetland Complex" (Suffolk 2006a). In a routine that was becoming standard, sections of ditches averaging a few feet were plugged with peat. Open Marsh Water Management: Impacts on Tidal Wetlands 89</page><page sequence="11">Elements of OMWM The digging of ponds and ditches in marshes is called OMWM. These activities may also be referred to as "Integrated Pest Management." In the Suffolk County Long Term Plan for marsh management, the elements of OMWM were categorized under a table of Best Management Practices (Suffolk 2006b). Among the most notable applications are: BMP#1 Natural Processes (Reversion/ No Action) BMP #4 Maintenance of Existing Salt Marsh Ditches BMP #6 Naturalize Existing Ditches BMP #7 Install Shallow Spur Ditches BMP #8 Backblading/ Sidecasting into Depressions BMP #9 Digging Fish Reservoirs BMP #11 Constructing Artificial Tidal Channels BMP #14 Filling Ditches BMP #15 Constructing Large Ponds When left to accretion or tidal sedimentation, many ditches will undergo natural reversion (BMP #1). This was evident as early as the 1930s, while ditch digging was in full operation. Many untended ditches were found to fill in within 2 decades (Figure 8). Once ditches are dug in a marsh, mosquito-control agencies are then committed to indefinite ditch mainte- nance (BMP #4). While some ditches that become ma- jor water routes during tidal flow will widen over time, other ditches may experience sedimentation, sidewall erosion, and collapse that make them shallower. "Iron- ically, this often becomes more of a mosquito prob- lem than was initially present. Portnoy (1982) found higher numbers of mosquitoes in mosquito ditches even those treated with a larvicide than in natural sur- face pools untreated with larvicides..." (Kent 2001). Suffolk County (2006a) found: "It became habitual to maintain the ditch system on a marsh- wide basis..." In recognition of aesthetic considerations, OMWM now promotes curves in ditches to make them look more natural (BMP 6). However, as Richards (1938) noted: "Mosquitoes breed almost exclusively in stagnant or scarcely moving water. Accordingly the area of available breeding places on the uplands can frequently be reduced greatly by... straightening the margins of creeks...". Thus, as OMWM looks to imitate nature, it may be incorporating components contrary to its own mission of mosquito reduction. Marshes are not static ecosystems, so their surface features are subject to natural variations over time. OMWM attempts to capture mosquito-breeding sites that surface on the marsh. To accomplish this, spur ditches are added. Spur ditches (BMP #7) are shallow ditch extensions that demand continual dredging. Dropping the front blade of a bulldozer to the ground and driving in reverse scrapes surface vegetation and levels soil. This technique of backblading (BMP #8) targets Spartina patens habitat. " Spartina patens tends to grow in groups of plants, so that it forms raised areas above the general elevation of the marsh. This creates small potholes... These small potholes are very effective mosquito habitat..." (Suffolk 2006a). Backblading is, thus, an OMWM technique that confronts the natural growth pattern of marsh plants and natural surface development of the marsh. After a century of manipulating marshes with ditches, mosquito agencies have now turned to out- right excavation of areas where mosquito larvae are found. By excavating and creating craters throughout the marsh, they temporarily dislocate the mosquito- breeding grounds. As these marsh holes fill with wa- ter, they are termed fish reservoirs (BMP #9). As new mosquito-breeding areas crop up over time, they, too, are either dug out or trenched with spur ditches. Longer, convoluted ditches are termed tidal chan- nels. The artificial tidal channels (BMP #11) serve as major thoroughfares for the multiple, other, internal ditches and ponds that may be connected to them. In effect, the square grid system has morphed into a geo- metrically diverse ditch system. New designs enable the ditching to continue. As mosquito agencies reconfigure their marsh maze, some ditches are filled (BMP #14), while re- placement ditches are dug. Occasionally, only por- tions of ditches are refilled or reworked to add curves, angles, or connections to new ponds. With each new excavation, the marsh integrity weakens further. The most prominent features of OMWM are the large ponds (BMP #15). The peat retrieved from the pond excavations (Figure 21) is used to fill ditches as the mosquito agencies change course on ditch designs. Large areas of high marsh incur loss due to the pond excavations (Figure 22). The affiliation of DU and the SCDVC has led to numerous ponds in high marsh. The Suffolk County (2006b) Long Term Plan de- scription of BMP #1 (Natural Processes) is "Rever- sion is to be the presumptive interim action for County wetlands, pending identification of a preferred active restoration plan for each wetland." Thus, as the fate of county marshes is held in abeyance, the alternative for natural processes of reversion are delegated to a subordinate, temporary status. Several aspects of OMWM are shown in Figures 23-30. Photographs of Wertheim National Wildlife Refuge (Figures 31-35) clearly show the extent of impacts by OMWM. 90 Tidal Marshes of Long Island, Torrey Botanical Society</page><page sequence="12">Figure 21. To fill a ditch, excavators must find a source of fresh peat. So, peat is excavated from intact high marsh. In the process, new ponds and ditches are dug. Areas scouted for peat removal are those that are wet with puddles or small pannes. O 'E &lt;u CO I CU CU 1 o CS z; Figure 22. Areas with multiple depressions are dredged and converted into ponds.

Mosquito agencies still adhere to their century- old custom of digging into salt marshes. Some aged ditches are assigned to abandonment. Often, when allowed, natural accretion has acted to fill in ditches. However, to hasten filling of ditches, peat is obtained by excavation with marsh backhoes (turquoise machine above). t ¡3 0 U m § 1 co Figure 24. When ditches are intentionally filled, peat is retrieved from one part of the marsh and trucked to the fill site. A dump truck (above) is used to transport and unload the peat. Peat is the substrate of choice for filling ditches. Unfortunately, the original peat, dug by the mosquito agencies, is no longer available, so new peat must be found. As part of OMWM, portions of high marsh are the sacrifice areas, but are quickly justified as areas for killifish ponds. c a M S i CO Figure 25. A touted advantage of OMWM is the refilling of straight ditches that are so often viewed as despoiling marshes of their natural beauty. Evidence of a filled ditch is visible in the above photograph. Spartina patens is seen revegetating the area. Although this may present as favorable, one must bear in mind two important considerations: 1) the peat to fill this ditch was obtained by sacrificing a nearby area of marsh, 2) OMWM does not free the marsh of ditches. In fact, OMWM not only retains many existing ditches, but dredges many more. As an example, during the 2005-2007 OMWM project at Wertheim National Wildlife Refuge, twice as much marsh acreage was excavated than was recovered as filled ditches. a a o U m £ CO 92 Tidal Marshes of Long Island, Torrey Botanical Society</page><page sequence="14">Figure 26. Mechanical buckets of marsh backhoes dig into the marsh during their excavation exercises. Small pannes and depressions are elected for excavation. However, as early as 1938, Taylor was aware that "these 'rotten spots' are of considerable significance in the distribution of the secondary species on the marsh. Their development means greater frequency for these ephemeral species, and their ultimate recovery to [high marsh vegetation] is usually completed. That may not happen for a few years, and in the meantime, the area is occupied by a shifting population..." * G 3 O U M ì C/5 Figure 27. Rotary excavators are attached to rear of marsh trucks to cut ditches into marsh peat. The grated peat is "sidecast" out over the marsh. This technique of shredding the peat, instead of laying cut sod in piles, is hailed as an improvement by mosquito agencies as they cut ditches in marshes. The marsh OMWM ditches and artificial tidal ditches act to drain water off the marsh. Kent (2001) noted that results of some actions are self-evident: "Clearly a ditch that drains a panne will negatively affect wildlife that depends on that panne." G 3 0 U M 1 c n Figure 28. OMWM ponds are often connected to the ditch network by intermediary ditches called sill ditches. These are shallow and allow pondwater to drain without emptying the pond. Ponds, such as the one above, were excavated and provided peat to fill ditches, such as the one in Figure 25. Although, at face value, it may appear that OMWM is merely swapping ponds for ditches, the reality is that OMWM is still a ditch-based system, retaining and digging many new ditches. * G a M C/3 Open Marsh Water Management: Impacts on Tidal Wetlands 93</page><page sequence="15">Figure 29. 2005 aerial photo of ditched marsh at Wertheim NWR.

Now, after 4 decades of OMWM, it, too, is under scrutiny for ditch-digging impacts. Although OMWM has been applied to many marshes along the east coast of the United States by its proponents, there is a growing concern as to its effects upon marsh ecology and its legitimacy as a restoration method for marshes. OMWM faced its first sign of resistance on Long Island at Orient Beach State Park. Ducks Unlimited approached New York State to implement OMWM at the marsh at Orient Beach, which is on Long Island's North Fork. The New York State Office of Parks and Recreation and Historic Preservation commissioned a field study to inventory the plants of the salt marsh. A marsh survey began in 1999, and the report was completed in 2004 (Evans et al. 2007) Among the plants found was Dwarf glasswort ( Salicornia bigelovii), which is classified by New York State as S2/S3 (imperiled due to its rarity) and seaside plantain ( Plantago maritima var. juncoides ), which is considered threatened. The request to perform OMWM on the marsh was denied. The majority of OMWM projects on Long Island, from their introductions in the 1980s through 2000, took place on the salt marshes of Suffolk County. Then, in 2002, the momentum of OMWM on Long Island was stalled when the Suffolk County Legis- lature realized the county's mosquito control plan necessitated evaluation under NYS law. The State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA), was established to review projects that might cause harm to the environment. Suffolk County's mosquito con- trol activities, which were engaging OMWM, were finally recognized in need of environmental review. Suffolk County proposed a Long Term Plan for Wetlands Management, and it was this plan that underwent review by SEQRA. As part of the review, concerns about the potential impacts of OMWM upon salt marshes were put on the table. In conjunction, Suffolk County funded a pilot project at Wertheim NWR. The salt marsh at Wertheim was chosen as a demonstration site to study the effects of contemporary OMWM in Suffolk County. Unfortunately, the study to determine the impacts of OMWM was performed and analyzed by the same agency seeking approval for OMWM, that is, the Suffolk County Division of Vector Control (SCDVC). The USFWS sought a permit for the OMWM proj- ect on its federal refuge at Wertheim. It applied for permission under Article 25 of the Tidal Wetlands Section: Clean Water Act to excavate and fill in navi- gable waters. The permit was granted, and SCDVC commenced excavating in 2005 (Figure 36). In order to implement future OMWM projects in Suffolk County, SCDVC was beholden to the SEQRA process, which went on until 2007. As the pilot OMWM project progressed and the process of review proceeded, the effort by SCDVC to sanction OMWM practices faced mounting opposition from the environmental community. While the SEQRAreview was in process , NY SDEC completed an unrelated, 30-yr study of marsh loss, comparing aerial photographs of Long Island marshes of 1974 and 2006. The photos were analyzed using infrared to aid in distinguishing tidal wetland zones. The research yielded disconcerting results: 4% loss on Long Island salt marshes (Mushacke, this volume). In light of the severe marsh loss attributed to past dredging, sea level rise and other unknown causes, the NYSDEC began to reconsider the environmental cost of OMWM. As OMWM makes localized areas of the marsh unavailable for mosquito breeding, it converts marsh to open water. During formal review of the plan under the SEQRA process, public hearings were held, and written comments were submitted. In response to Suffolk County's OMWM plans, NYSDEC submitted the following comments: 1)" ...the salt marsh mosquito is a native, not introduced species, and is therefore an integral part of the ecology of the marsh." 2) " ...the use of Open Marsh Water Management or other manipulations to control mosquitoes constitutes marsh alteration, not restoration. An example is the excavation of Spartina patens areas to provide fish access..." 3) "The 'jury is still out' as to whether or not the marsh alterations done for the demonstration projects at Wertheim have long-term ecological and mosquito control benefits. Such manipulations require monitoring and in some cases may require maintenance to ensure continued functioning as planned. A case in point is Seatuck, where it appears that lack of sufficient post-project monitoring and maintenance has led to a recurrence of a large mosquito breeding population..." 4) "[NYSDEC] is concerned that Suffolk County has concluded that increasing biodiversity and creating a 'mosaic of ecological communities' is the best management technique..."

In 2004, before OMWM, this area of marsh had no open water ponds. All the open water is the result of the Suffolk County OMWM pilot project. The environmental community protested that such extensive excavations fragment the marsh and make it vulnerable to further disintegration. Proponents of OMWM argued that the project gave good results. « ■4-t G V £ ui e JS o As part of SEQRA, Suffolk County prepared an En- vironmental Impact Statement (EIS) outlining its plan for marsh management that incorporated OMWM. Comments and objections to the content of the EIS and the inclusion of OMWM were plentiful. In submitted, written comments, the National Park Service (NPS) decried the EIS being prepared by Suffolk County: "Throughout the document we are surprised by the lack of any references to the professional literature." Regarding a section in the plan that discusses the technique for evaluating potential [mosquito] breed- ing, NPS wrote: "The method as described seems to be highly qualitative. Can the County adopt a more quantitative method...?" (Suffolk 2006b). This ambi- guity was further raised at the Long Island Geologists Conference (Potente 2007). Redefining its position of nonparticipation in OMWM at Fire Island National Seashore on the barrier island that protects Long Is- land, NPS submitted: "....the Seashore will continue passive restoration of ditches, allowing natural filling over the long run" (Figure 37).

The Audubon chapters were concerned with the welfare of marsh-dwelling birds, such as the clapper rail ( Rallus longirostris , Figure 38); the salt marsh sparrow ( Ammodramus caudacutus, Figure 39); and the seaside sparrow ( Ammodramus maritimus ). The fragmentation of high marsh caused by OMWM may compromise the nesting and reproductive requirements for these tidal wetland bird species. Unconvinced of prior reports on the benefits of OMWM to bird life, the Eastern Long Island Audubon Society wrote in their comments to the review process: "[OMWM] is certainly not a restoration plan, but a degradation marsh plan that will ...destroy nesting populations of rare and declining species of salt marsh birds" (Suffolk 2006b). On behalf of the Long Island Audubon Council, the following remarks were made at a public hearing for the OMWM proposal: "In the opinion of the Long Island Audubon Council, the OMWM ponding procedures do not promote restoration, but further disturbance to the marsh" (Suffolk 2006b). Audubon New York, after reviewing results ema- nating from the Wertheim project (Figure 40) and past OMWM studies, passed a cautionary resolution that was submitted to Suffolk County: "At a time of our heightened concern about the possibility of rising sea levels, high tides and storm surges that could occur from anticipated hurricane activity, it seem foolhardy to be experimenting with, and reducing our salt water wetlands. This experimental project will dig up areas of salt marsh peat that have taken centuries to develop and the collective Audubon Societies of Long Island believe that the OMWM techniques proposed in the Long Term Plan are unproven at best and damaging at worst" (Suffolk 2006b). Letters urging restraint from the use of OMWM on Long Island marshes also came from townships within Suffolk County. Some were read at the public hearings, and some were sent. The letter from the Board of Town Trustees from the Town of Southold reads: "... the marsh alteration proposed in the Plan to decrease the need for pesticides, creating ponds in the wetlands 3 feet deep to increase the mosquito eating fish does not preserve the integrity of the wetlands. These ponds remove wetland vegetation... and they decrease existing bird habitat for marsh birds. They may cause more problems than the ditching in the 1930's did. These are not a good solution for Southold's marshes." In a coalition letter, including Environmental Defense, The Nature Conservancy, and the Open Space Council, the concerns of shallow claims of OMWM efficacy are echoed: " . . .we have seen no conclusive evidence (in the form of peer-reviewed published scientific reports) that OMWM always results in ecological improvements to the marsh. Even if the anecdotal 'evidence' suggests that OMWM both reduces mosquitoes and enhances wildlife habitat, there have been no comprehensive, long-term studies to document the impact of OMWM." (Suffolk 2006b). The New York State Department of State directed their concern: "After careful review of the wetlands manage- ment plan and the salt marsh best management practices manual, the Department continues to have concerns with the real ecological risks associated with Class II BMP 8 ( Backblading and/or sidecasting material into depres- sions) and most, if not all, Class IE Best Management Practices [Pond Construction]. The Department does not concur with the use of the practices given the absence in the plan of baseline data regarding their effectiveness and ecological risks, and the absence of any substantive details relating to how projects will be considered, de- signed, implemented and monitored..."

After the OMWM treatment, the marsh resembled the "pothole" prairies of the midwest that lure migrating waterfowl. Also note the widened ditch in the center of the photo. Ditch widening occurs when certain ditches receive a larger portion of surface drainage, or when there is continual removal of peat by mosquito control agencies during maintenance. i I Oh ui c J3 S The New York Natural Heritage Program combines field inventories, scientific analyses, interpretation, and comprehensive databases on New York's flora and fauna. It entered its comments both in regard to the Wertheim NWR project and OMWM, in gen- eral: "...given that listed natural communities gener- ally co-occur as a mosaic in a salt marsh complex, it is possible that OMWM activity will involve all of these community types. OMWM should not utilize reference wetland sites as these are intended to be set aside as the least altered examples. It is unfortunate that OMWM activity has commenced at Wertheim NWR, because two reference wetlands were iden- tified at this site, high salt marsh and brackish tidal marsh. Ecological processes such as flooding, fire, ice scour, wind, etc. are essential in maintaining and creating the natural landscape. Attempts to suppress, eliminate, or undo their effects are not always suc- cessful, and in some cases the results are regrettable. Wherever possible, these ecological processes should be left intact" (Suffolk 2006b). Comments of the NYSDEC helped summarize the major concerns: "...it is problematic that the document narrowly focuses on the enhancement of habitat for killifish when there is a much broader variety of other organisms that need to be considered" (Suffolk 2006b) . A proponent's view of OMWM can be seen in a letter submitted by the Program Administrator of the Delaware Mosquito Control Section: "We. ...don't view the conversion of some wetland grassy habitats to wetland open water habitat (the latter in the form of small, shallow OMWM ponds) as being any type of wetlands "loss", but rather as simply a planned, ac- ceptable, very localized conversion from one type of wetlands to another" (Suffolk 2006b). Suffolk County's environmental review board, the Council on Environmental Quality, in consideration of the lack of science supporting OMWM submitted in its recommendation to the county that "[Digging fish reservoir ponds or ditches in high marsh] was un- substantiated as vector control or marsh restoration" (Suffolk 2007). Unfortunately, the Suffolk County legislature over- rode the warnings of the Long Island environmental community and the recommendations of its own en- vironmental review board. Suffolk County's Long Term Plan for Wetlands Management was released in 2007 amid criticism and controversy. At stake was the fate of the county's 17,000 ac of tidal wetlands. A Wetlands Stewardship Committee was set up to mon- itor future management of tidal wetlands, but it was apparent that OMWM would be at the forefront.

Even without the added burden that OMWM places upon marshes with its fragmentation effect, marshes such as this one are experiencing loss to open water. &amp; ¡2 C O Q Figure 42.

But the negative impacts of OMWM are many: additional ditches are added to the marsh in the form of artificial creeks and spur ditches; newly dug ponds are added to a marsh that further fragment it; and functioning rare ecosystems are obliterated via the technique of "marsh levelling" and sidecasting peat. These aggressive approaches present an attempt to control the ongoing tidal wetland events of tidal flow, natural accretion, and marsh ecosystem dynamics. To maintain the created ponds and creeks, a man- agement system involving continued manipulations of former natural processes will be needed. Staff will need to return to the work sites regularly to remove silt and clear vegetation from the new, artificial, ditch system to ensure water flow in the fake creeks. But, even more importantly, larger questions loom. Will depressions continue to form and be recurring land- scape features of the marsh? If so, does this aggressive manipulation effort really depress mosquito popula- tions? Certainly, scores of natural ecosystems are be- ing sacrificed in this process of marsh homogenization. Salt marshes are on the decline in New York State and elsewhere along coastal areas (Figure 41). Current marsh loss is due to erosion and dieback from a vari- ety of factors, including sea level rise, nutrient load- ing, increased storm events, perimeter development, and sediment starvation. What will be the impact to the wildlife that depends on salt marshes? What will be the long-term effects on the mainland from loss of marsh buffers? As marshes shrink and become frag- mented, the remaining marshes are at risk. OMWM may act to accelerate these destructive processes. During the 1930s, extensive plowing of prairie grasslands led to the Dust Bowl of the Midwest. The plowing continued for decades, until a drought crip- pled the weakened prairie. Now, decades of OMWM appear to be weakening tidal marsh grasslands (Fig- ure 42, Figure 43). Limited government funds would be better spent repairing marshes (i.e., enlarging culverts, reestablishing connections of marshes that were constricted or impeded by roads and dikes, and removing berms and barriers to marsh continuity) and eliminating causesof marsh loss (such as excessive dredging, nutrient run-off, and bulkheading). Why dig up more marsh, when marshes are already facing so many underlying serious threats? 100 Tidal Marshes of Long Island, Torrey Botanical Society</page><page sequence="22">Literature Cited Evans, D.
