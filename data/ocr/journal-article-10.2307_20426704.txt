RIVERS, the psychologist and psycho-pathologist will find a work which well repays the most careful study. It opens up new lines of thought, and may be said to meet a definite need. During the last few years remarkable advances have been made in psychology, and the progress which has taken place is in a large measure due to the c ontributions made by the psycho-pathologist in daily contact with the practical problems of the clinic. The time would now seem- to have come, however, when the dogmas, theories, concepts, and terminology of clinical psychology should be subjected to the closest scrutiny. 'The whole subject needs to be hardened and clarified; it needs constructive criticism, wider view-points, and minute and careful observations. Especially must the endeavour be made to interpret abnormal reactions in terms applicable to the organism as a whole. The facts of clinical psychology need to be harmonized with the whole body of biological and physiological knowledge and to be expressed in the special language of science, because it is only-in this way that psycho-pathology can be extri . cated from the narrow circle of repetitions into which it . would seem to be in danger of falling. Such an aim is most likely to be achieved, not by the clinician, who is naturally largely preoccupied by therapeutic considera tions, but by the trained psychologist and scientific observer who is in a position to interpret facts with more detachment and with a wider range of knowledge. It is from this wider outlook that Dr. Rivers approaches the problems of mental functioning, and his book may be regarded as a contribution of definite value, and as a real addition to our knowledge of the subject with which it deals. The expressed aim of the book is to develop a biological view of the psycho-neuroses, and the endeavour is made to bring functional disturbances of the mind and nervous system into relation with the concepts concerning their normal modes of working which are held by the biologist and physiologist. Dr. Rivers sets himself more particularly to consider the general biological function of the process by which experience passes into the region of the unconscious. This process lhe calls suppression, and lhe takes the view that this process occurs-especiilly as the result of physical and mental shock-without the inter vention of volition, and that it is to be regarded as an active and especially complete form of forgetting. He limits the content of the unconscious to experiences of this kind- which are not capable of being brought into the fieldcof consciousness by the ordinary processes of memory or association. The relation between suppression of -psychblogical, experiences and certain physiological p'h6io-ena' iis- next considered, and it is shown by reference to the w ork of Head, Rivers and Sherren in respect to protopathic and epicritic sensibility that in the former mode of cutaneous sensibility Mwe find evidence of suppression at the physiological level analogous to that which occurs at the psychical level. The argument is thus developed that suppression of conscious experience is only one example of a process which applies throughout the whole of the animal kingdom, and is essential to the proper regulation of every form of human and animal activity. Every living process of the animal involves, not only activity directed to a special end, but also the inhibition of tendencies to activities of other kinds. Thus suppression is to be regarded as only one aspect of the universal physiological property of inhibition. In chapters on " The content of the unconscious," " The nature of instinct," " Thle danger instincts," " Suppression and the all-or-none principle," and " Instinct and suppres sion," Dr. Rivers develps smoothly and consistently his central contention that the same biological principles are operative at the psychological le-vels of development as at the sensori-motor and reflex levels of activity. The treat ment of these subjects is most suggestive and full of interest. As an examaple may be cited a subject upon which Dr. 1lntstin7ct antJ thte Unlco1SCzO1rS. A Contribultion to a Biological Theory of the Psychlo-neouroses. By Wr. H. R. IliVers B, MD.. Sc. LL.^D. F.R;S. Camblridge: Unliversity Press. 1920. (Demny 8vo, Rivers lays. particular - emphasis, namely, the protective reaction to danger by means of immobility. In suggesting that hysterical symptoms - paralyses, mutism, anaes thesias-are modified forms of this instinct he has un doubtedly brought into prominence a point of view of considerable significance, and one which might be utilized for the elucidation of other forms of abnormal reactions. His views would seem to be particularly applicable to the negativistic behaviour which is such a prominent 'feature in cases of dementia praecox. The thought suggests itself that we here find a much purer form of the instinct of immobility than that found in the hysteric. This is to be expected, as the reactions in dementia praecox are ex. tremely primitive in character and expressive of a much deeper stage of regression than are those of hysteria. fn the "death feint" the threatened animal can be pushed about and rolled over without any apparent response-a state of affairs which is almost paralleled in the postures, tensions, and attitudes of many katatonic cases. The negativism in dementia praecox may thus be regarded as a biological protective reaction which guards the patient, not from physical danger, as in the case of the immobile animal, but from undesired intrusions into his inner mental life. - f In subsequent *chapters Dr. Rivers deals with "dis sociation," "the complex," "suggestion," "hypnotism," " sleep," ",hysteria," "sublimation," and "regression." It is, of course, outside the scope of a review to discuss his treatment of these subjects, but some brief reference may perhaps be made to the views which Dr. Rivers has formulated in regard to Freud's psychology. His attitude is developed more fully in the appendix to this volume, which contains two articles entitled respectively " Freud's psychology of the unconscious" and "Freud's conception of the censorship." There is no doubt a very large measure of truth in Dr. Rivers's view that Freud's theories have been pushed by their advocates beyond the position they are entitled to hold, with the result that, failing to fulfil the expectations thus aroused, their merits may be under estimated, or even be in danger of being thrust into the limbo reserved for dead hypotheses, only to be rescued therefrom by some later generation. Hle is probably correct, moreover, in suggesting that the excessive absorption in the sexual determinants of human re actions which characterizes the followers of Freud is to a large extent a reaction fr ova the timidity and prudery of the past in relation to sexual matters, and is a protest against the ignorance of this side of life which often exists. One outstanding merit of Freud's psychology, as Dr. Rivers recognizes, is the emphasis lie has laid on the fact that human reactions, both normal and morbid, are determined by the totality of the indi vidual experience as well as that of the ancestral or racial experience; not only has lie recognized this fact, but he has devised methods which, when judiciously used, are of considerable practical utility, for by means of them the historical past of the individual may be brought to light. As indicated above, Dr. Rivers devotes 'considerable attention to the vexed question of the censor-a concept which bulks so largely in' Freud's psychology. Tlhis con cept of an anthropomorphic entity, itself unconscious, standing between the true unconscious and preconscious, is artificial and obviously needs further examination. Dr. Rivers contends that a concept which is based on analogy with a highly complex and specialized institution should be capable of being expressed in some other and more satisfying form. He maintains that it is to physiology rather than sociology that we should look for the clue to the nature of the process by which a person is guarded from the intrusion of disturbing elements of his uncon scious experience, and he proceeds to develop a view which harmonizes, with the biological principles maintained throughout the book. Assuming the organization in the unconscious of a functional hierarchy such as exists in the nervous system, lhe goes 'on to show in regard to dreams that the relaxation of conscious control in 'sleep must result in the emergence of mental activities identical in form and structure with the thoughts, feelings, and con duct peculiar to the infantile stage of mental development. Thlis is not the plaon to either epitomize or discuss the 'iews whiclh Dr. Rs iers bringsi~orward.
