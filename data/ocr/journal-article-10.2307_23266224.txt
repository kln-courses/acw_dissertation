La palabra segun Clarice Lispector: Aproxi maciones criticas / A palavra segundo Clarice Lispector: Aproximagdes criticas / The Word according to Clarice Lispector: Critical Approaches. Lima: Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, 2011. Pp. 228. ISBN 978-9972-9578-6-4. With this collection, editors Luciana Namorato and Cesar Ferreira have produced an impressive gathering of thought-provoking essays about the oeuvre of Clarice Lispector. The volume is divided into four sections, with essays written in Spanish, Portuguese, and English, as indicated by its trilingual title. In the first part, "Homages," Moacyr Scliar writes a beautiful straightforward tribute, speaking to many of Clarice's contradictions: how she was not born in Brazil, yet is one of the most famous Brazilian writers; how her female characters are primary in many of her writings, yet she did not consider herself a staunch feminist; etc. Marjorie Agosin finds reading Lispector to be an exercise in reflection, noting that, as a reader, as she often discovers the silences, she hears the empty spaces behind the words, and participates in the journeys that Lispector designs in her writings. Agosin's essay, thus, is a poetic rendering of the experience of reading Clarice. Inspired by Lispector's Lagos de familia, Sonia Coutinho offers her thoughts about life, love, destiny, and death through her own short story, in which Clarice appears as a ghost. The second section provides an analysis of Clarice's novels. Affonso Romano de Sant'Anna offers a detailed reading of Clarice's A paixao segundo G.H. (1943), replicating her style at the beginning of the article, disrupting his own critical language, so as to approximate her text. He goes on to argue that the novel is a revelation and that this element of epiphany is a ritual in her writings. He offers various critical approaches in this essay, almost to the point of excess; in doing so, he poses an important question about the distance between critical writing and the subject of criticism. Ida Vitale goes on to convincingly argue that Lispector attacks novelistic conventions in her writing. Stripping her work of traditional plot and dialogue, her characters are left bare. Vitale highlights their inability to comprehend the worlds that surround them and their incapability to understand themselves; the novels reveal their struggle to make sense of it all. In a fascinating essay, Berta Waldman compares the novels of Clarice with those of her older sister Elisa, examining the autobiographical elements of their texts to explore their relationships with Judaism. Waldman finds that Clarice's use of language, her circularity, and the silences in her works, for example, communicate an ethnic and religious identity that she did not discuss for a good portion of her life. Maria Fernandez-Babineaux persuasively argues that Clarice's writing is an androgynous one. Using Deleuze and Guattari's theory of "body without organs" as a guide, she analyzes the language of Agua viva (1973), in which there are no identifiable cultural markers, such as a gendered narrative voice. Instead, the novel is a monologue of frag ments directed at the reader. Fernandez-Babineaux proposes that, in this way, Clarice creates a new subjectivity and a new language. For her part, Leila Lehnen offers a compelling reading that ably demonstrates the role of social space in A Hora da Estrela (1977). She plainly lays out her argument that the novel "can be read as a map of the multiple relations of power present within the Brazilian nation in the latter half of the twentieth-century and of the marginalized subject's location within this grid" (110). It is a straightforward essay, one that could easily be used to supplement a university course on the subject. The third section, focusing on Lispector's short stories, begins with Yudith Rosenbaum's essay, in which she reveals how Clarice traces the development of the ego in "Menino a bico de-pena," from the collection A legiao estrangeira (1964). After giving a brief overview of some of her most famous short stories, Rosenbaum uses psychoanalytic theory to skillfully analyze two specific moments when the baby appears to recognize himself as a being separate from his mother. Dario Borim offers a clear analysis of the stylistic features of "A imitai^ao da rosa." After a brief literary review, as well as a look at elements such as anthropomorphism,</page><page sequence="2">358 Hispania 95 June 2012 synesthesia, and metaphors, he highlights her use of interrogatives, illustrating the protagonist's fixation on perfection. In her constant self-questioning, she shows her uncertainties about herself and her own mental strength. Jason R. Jolley examines the entirety of Clarice's Lagos de familia (1960), arguing that she proposes a classical definition of ethics, one that emphasizes self-care rather than the impulse to care for others before the self. Reviewing many of the short stories in the collection, he explicates each one, leaving the reader with the satisfaction of perhaps being one step closer to more fully comprehending these works. Rick J. Santos examines the third short story from Lagos da familia, "Uma galinha," arguing that Clarice "attempts to inscribe the possibility of resistant connections among Active Subjects" (168). While his active explication of Active Subjects is thought-provoking, his dialogue with fellow critic Marta Peixoto's work provides an important model of respectful scholarly engagement. As a conclusion to this section, Cesar Ferreira provides a useful overview of the archetypal Lispector character in his essay. Using "Amor" from Lagos, he lays out the predominant themes to be found throughout her oeuvre: namely, unstable family relationships, encounters with the Other, and concerns with the inferior ity of the often female character. In the final essays of the collection, Aparecida Maria Nunes and Alessandra M. Pires highlight a topic often overlooked by critics: Clarice's work for newspapers of the time. Nunes offers a fascinating look at the cronicas that she writes using pseudonyms in the 1960s; for Nunes, though these divergent writing identities do not rise to the standard established by Fernando Pessoa, Clarice's alternates should be called heteronyms. Through an examination of Clarice's anthology of Cronicas, A descoberta do mundo (1984), Pires underscores her view that paradox, oxymoron, and inconclusiveness are critical to Lispector's writings. Often when one reads Clarice Lispector, there is a sense of something missing, of not completely understanding that which she is trying to communicate. As a collection, this volume offers a number of dynamic theoretical readings, several of which prompt the reader to return to the original works for another reading. Each essay stands alone in its analysis; as a collection, they serve to emphasize once again the originality of her work. Though perhaps advanced for the novice Clarice reader, the essays offer a wide variety of perspectives on the work of this consummate Brazilian writer.
