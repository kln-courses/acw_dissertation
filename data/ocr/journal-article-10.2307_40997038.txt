<plain_text><page sequence="1">W. Andries van Helden CASE AND GENDER Concept Formation between Morphology and Syntax VOLUME I</page><page sequence="2">PREFACE What exactly do we mean when we say that two words are in the same case? And how many cases does the Russian language in particular possess? These were the keynote questions at a seminar on mathematical linguistics held in Moscow in 1957. They had been prepared by the mathematician A.N. Kolmogorov, who did not participate him- self, being otherwise occupied with mathematicizing all the humanities. The present study deals with the answers to these and similar questions, which were proposed by some dozens of East European mathematicians and linguists repre- senting a tradition referred to as the Set-theoretical School or Kulagina School after O.S Kulagina's paper on the definition of grammatical categories, which appeared shortly after the seminar. The significance of the Set-theoretical School, which pro- fessed to practise algebraic linguistics or analytical modelling, tends to be underesti- mated. This is due to three circumstances: (1) its cognitive thresholds, (2) its linguistic naïveté, and (3) its short-livedness. 1 The impact of the Set-theoretical School was limited as a result of the accumulated effect of a variety of thresholds. The exponents of the school employed mathemati- cal methods, viz. set theory and logic, at a time when these were not yet widely known among humanities students. They published in languages not commonly fa- miliar to mathematicians worldwide: not just in Russian but also in other East Euro- pean languages. And they used material from these and even less widespread lan- guages, that was hardly accessible to non-specialists. Removing one threshold did not solve the problems arising here. In the English [1967a] and French [1967c] translations of Marcus' comprehensive introduction to algebraic linguistics, so- phisticated mathematical methods were applied to unexplained Rumanian examples. By extensive exemplification and explanation of both the mathematical and linguis- tic material the present volumes represent an effort to level all these thresholds simultaneously. 2 The lack of linguistic sophistication of the Set-theoretical School in its initial phase is testified to in Parts 2 and 3 of the present study. It was due to the background of its exponents, the majority of whom were mathematicians, and to the task with which theoretical linguistics was entrusted in the 1950s: analysis of written texts with an eye to mechanical language processing. As demonstrated in Parts 4 and 5, the school gradually emancipated itself from the cognitive limitations that resulted from this mission. However, as discussed in Part 1 and from Chapter 4.7 onward, even in the early period the linguistic innocence of the Set-theoretical School was not an obstacle to methodological sophistication. As suggested in Part 6, the Set- theoretical School's work presents a set of methods whose application to realistic cognitive objects for linguistics is most promising even today. 3 The Set-theoretical School, as a network of investigators processing each other's ideas and results, only existed for two decades. The suspension of its work in the mid seventies cannot, however, be ascribed to a lack of scientific viability. As will be pointed out in Chapter 0 of this study, it was the result of external circum- V</page><page sequence="3">vi stances, which had ultimately been brought about by changes in Soviet science policy. The present volumes focus on the work of the Set-theoretical School on two gram- matical categories: case1 and gender1. These are at the heart of the problems which the Set-theoretical School had set out to address. No linguistic tradition to date has been able to provide meaningful and consistent answers to questions like the ones presented by Kolmogorov. In the present study it will be shown that the Set-theoreti- cal School has developed a tool kit that at least offers the prospect of systematically dealing with them. It will also be shown why some questions of this type are simpler to answer than others, case and gender' belonging to the more stubborn concepts to ac- count for. Most of the material in the present study was compiled between 1978 and 1980, when the author was preparing a PhD thesis at the University of Leiden. Then he decided to contribute to the shining prospects offered by government research policy (which turned out to be shining indeed, especially for research policy). For a long time the considerable scope of the material, the graphic complexity of the text, and lack of lo- gistic support inhibited the completion of the present work on a sideline basis. The manuscript had to wait patiently in a drawer for the invention of the Apple Macintosh, the development of the appropriate software, and the accumulation of the author's entitlements to a few sabbatical months. The drawer was opened in 1989. The present version of the study was virtually completed in 199 1.1 One would expect the decade of delay to render the work outdated in two respects. On the one hand, it may not deal with recent developments. On the other hand, it may not consistently represent the evolving viewpoints of the author. Both risks will be briefly commented on. The freeze imposed on East European theoretical linguistics in the mid seventies and reported on in §0.12, as well as the lack of interest in Kolmogorov's problems in the west, prevented further development of the Set-theoretical School's approach. How- ever unfortunate these circumstances have been for linguistics at large, they have for the most part saved the present study from becoming obsolete. Although Soviet society was liberalized in the late eighties, the thread has not (yet) been picked up. A research culture is a sensitive ecology: it is easily destroyed but may require decades to revive or a great deal of chance to recover. The ideas which have been explored in 1 Macintosh users may be interested to know that the text was written in subsequent versions of Microsoft Word, using the fonts LaserTransliterator, LaserTech, LaserlPA and LaserCyrillic from Linguist's Software, while the graphics were created in Design from Meta Software. Without these tools, the writer would not have managed to produce a text of the present size and consistency. Having said this, he must note that the heavy-duty work required has brought to light quite a few time-consuming bugs and prohibitive shortcom- ings in all applications, especially when using them in combination and after switching to the LaserWriter during the last stage. The author was forced to make ad hoc use of additional fonts in order to evade bugs and restore formatting features, and his friends were forced to paste in the graphics with old-fashioned glue in order to preserve laser quality. The index had to be created manually as well, since the computer software and the printer did not always agree on the precise page breaks. Moreover, Word does not support index en- tries in footnotes. Nothing is compatible, even in the Macintosh world. But real friends are excellent sub- stitutes for computers.</page><page sequence="4">vii Eastern Europe since perestroïka may be of interest but are hardly related to the tra- dition described in these volumes. Yet the present writer has decided to neglect some publications, with heavy heart, for the sole reason that, in his circumstances, the delay caused by taking them into account would produce a vicious circle. It is easy enough with the wordprocessor to insert a few comments into a finished manuscript and give the impression that recent literature has been taken into account, but a serious treatment of important books takes as much time as it ever has. The oldest victim in the present volumes is Ebeling 1978, which has been relegated to remarks and footnotes. Such was also the fate of Mel'ouk's recent work on the definition of linguistic concepts (1982, 1985, 1988), al- though Mel'ouk's 1986 work on case is subjected to a discussion in §5.59ff. The pres- ent writer must also apologize for wholly ignoring five recent books: - Hall Partee &amp; al. 1990, a voluminous introduction to mathematics in linguistics, should have been mentioned in Chapter 1.1. - Corbett's comprehensive 1991 study of 'gender1 should naturally have been dealt with in Chapter 4.6. - Plank's 1991 collection on paradigm1 should seriously have affected Part 5. - Mustajoki's recent work on the genitive of negation, which the present writer has not yet seen, may turn out to be a fateful omission in §5.9. - Finally, Alpatov 1991 contains new and crucial information from interviews and un- published sources (such as P.S. Kuznecov's autobiography) on Marr and Marrism, a subject treated in the introductory chapter of the present book. The present writer has been fortunate to find that Alpatov's book does not contradict most of his con- jectures.1 If anything, the situation turns out to have been much worse than de- scribed in the present book. As Alpatov reports, not only Polivanov was liquidated during the Stalin terror of the 1930s. Victims occurred among all factions: tradi- tional linguists (Durnovo), Jazykfrontists (Danilov) and Marrists (Aptekar') alike. Nevertheless this study's §0.6 to §0.10 are not wholly superfluous: they contain a few facts and speculations not mentioned in Alpatov's book. The second form of possible obsolescence mentioned above presented a problem. In the late eighties the author had to decide either to write a new book, with a new basic set-up or at least a rethinking of the parts which had been written, or to complete the existing material as it was structured. The former option was considered too risky in view of the limited amount of time available; but a price had to be paid in opting for the latter one. The technical devices used have been helpful in maintaining a certain degree of editorial and terminological consistency, but they cannot see to the consis- tency of the contents of a book. The recent parts of the present study may therefore here and there reveal perspectives which were not offered in the older parts,2 but, 1 He is happy to read, for example, that the leading physicist I offe esteemed Marr highly [Alpatov (2): 541 which supports some presumptions expressed in §0.6 and §0.10. 2 Philologists may be interested to know that the old typewritten version, which was basically conceived in the late seventies, had progressed until the beginning of Chapter 4.4. The major recent additions to the old version are the greater part of Chapter 0, the sections on Jassem's word model in Chapter 2.1, on con- figurational modelling in Chapter 4.1, and on potential subordination in Chapter 4.2. Some sections on Kolmogorov's and V.A. Uspenski/s case models in Part 5, on the other hand, are based on handwritten</page><page sequence="5">viii generally speaking, the recent chapters are characterized by increasing uncertainty. The delay also caused some minor presentational inconsistencies. A few mathematical concepts (exhaustiveness and exclusiveness in §1.1.6, hypostases in §1.1.16) are pre- sented and expanded in the older parts but do not really contribute to arguments pre- sented in the recent chapters. They were not suppressed however, as the present writer intends to use them later, in the yet unwritten part of this study, and because removing all instances of their occasional use would entail risky local modifications of the conceptual network presented. Other mathematical concepts (U-domination in §4.6.22, dependency structure in §4.0.3) should naturally have been presented in Chapter 1.1, in view of their independent mathematical interest. But since they are not used before they are presented, the decision was made not to engage in the risks of a major revision. There is no way to justify the size of the present study, but the author wishes at least to explain it with reference to two efforts which he holds to be honorable and defen- sible. 1 The first is the effort to comply with the methodological requirement, about which more will be said in Chapter 0, to expound and discuss the presented approaches in terms of the assumptions and intentions which the present writer ascribes to their authors, rather than screening them immediately by the standards of some other approach and presenting only what is then left of them. 2 The second effort consists in making the material accessible to uninformed readers with various backgrounds. This is motivated by the consideration that any virtue which this book may have lies in its long-term availability. Therefore, although the degree of formalization in the present book is sometimes higher and more consis- tent than that of the original presentations, an attempt has been made at the same time to lower the cognitive thresholds by means of extensive explanation and bulky exemplification. The detailed illustrations of the relatively unsophisticated models in Part 2 and Part 3 serve this elucidative aspect of the present study (besides de- monstrating that the method of the Set-theoretical School produces interesting re- sults even in unsophisticated conceptions of language). More apologies about the size of the book can be found at the end of Chapter 0. Most cultural products with outrageous physical dimensions have antisocial roots. The present work's root is misappropriation. Some of its major input - mental con- centration - was annexed from organizations: from the Ministry of Education and Science, which only plans and funds research endeavours elsewhere, and from the Eindhoven University of Technology, which does not budget unplanned research. Lei- den University, on the other hand, was deprived of the research it had planned and funded in vain in the seventies, viz. the present author's PhD project. The above uni- versities were also struck by excessive use of xeroxing and library facilities.1 manuscripts going back as far as 1975. The writer's first notes on the Set-theoretical School concerned Revziris model of paradigm' described in the last footnote of §4.3.14. 1 The latter form of antisocial behaviour, heavy library use, is nowadays being combatted effectively. Lei- den University Library, for example, by buying less books and charging ever higher fees to private users for borrowing from foreign libraries the books it and the other Dutch libraries did not see fit to buy, dis-</page><page sequence="6">ix The individuals who work and worked in these organizations, however, suffered a different loss. Their personal goodwill and support for the present project, which of- ten entailed significant sacrifices and efforts, and higher workloads for themselves, time and again failed to be redeemed. Those who assisted the author in the early stages may have forgotten that they ever did or, worse, may only remember their dis- appointment in the absence of tangible results. Ironically, Leiden University prohibits expressing thanks in PhD theses to individuals who happen to be affiliated with it in one way or another, the underlying idea being that no employees should be thanked for doing their duty. Since this rule would produce an unbalanced list of acknowledge- ments the author must leave his gratitude unspecified, at least in the printed version of these volumes. The major victims of the present crime, however, are the persons who entertained personal relationships with its perpetrator. The amount of time and concentration sto- len from them is irreparable, and was fatal to several ties. No promise was ever ful- filled, no social activity or vacation was ever normal. Some people even prepared food for the author. Fortunately, several people made their feelings clear. Since the two kinds of blame they produced were each other's complements, they made the writer survive. He did not know how to reduce the total amount of disappointment he inflicted on his envi- ronment: by spending more time finishing the book or by spending more time not fin- ishing it. Only now that the work is completed does he realize that he owed this com- fortable situation to a vicious logical trick: he could have finished a different book. But, as we say in our country, the knives are being sharpened for the settlement. One person could not be kept dangling. By permanently putting his trust in the au- thor, by refraining from even occasionally expressing his impatience or disappoint- ment, and by regularly emphasizing the futility of the effort, he presented the most ef- fective challenge. It is to this person, to Hans van Helden, the present writer's father, that this study is dedicated. By finishing these volumes the author can only hope to pay a tiny fraction of his debts to all who supported and tolerated the project. For those among them who do not wish to read the present study but want to believe that it has resulted in something, here is the state-of-the-art answer to Kolmogorov's first question, which triggered the Set- theoretical School as well as the present project. A definition of case cannot be given, but an assignment space for the label case can be defined. Case can be used in the description of a language to refer to a mor- phological category which is identified by its independent meanings but whose formal means can be used for marking the filling of a valency relation instead of expressing these meanings. The use of the label case is less appropriate when the morphological means of the category are nearly always or hardly ever used for expressing valen- cies, and most appropriate when they are sometimes used for that purpose. The as- courages independent researchers from wishing to consult "risky" books, i.e. books whose contents are not known beforehand. It will soon be impossible to carry out research of the present size and scope in this country: authorized university researchers are not given the time, individual citizens are prevented from abusing the public services.</page><page sequence="7">X signment space for gender is defined analogously: the label gender can be used in the description of a language to refer to a morphological category which is identified by its independent meanings but whose formal means can be used for marking the second place of an oriented limitation relation instead of expressing independent meanings. The formal means of a case category may be used to indicate oriented limitation be- sides marking valencies, but the formal means of a gender category cannot be used to mark valencies.</page><page sequence="8">CONVENTIONS Numbered items The present volumes contain many items which are marked in order to enable future reference. All marks consist of digits indicating part, chapter, section, and place in the order of appearance within the section. Three parallel systems of numbering are used. - The numbers of examples and statements are indicated on the left side of the page, between brackets. Digits are separated by slashes. (6/6/66/66) This is an example. - The numbers of formulas and constructs are indicated on the right side of the page, between brackets. Digits are separated by dots. { example } (6.6.66.66) - The numbers of figures and tables are indicated on the right side of the page, with- out brackets but preceded by Tig." Digits are separated by dots. Fig. 6.6.66.66 (^Exampìe^) Numbered items in footnotes are treated and ordered as if they were appearing as regular text in the position where the footnote mark note is.1 In order to save space examples are not repeated within a chapter. Transliteration Names, terms and examples originally written in non-Latin characters are rendered according to the transliteration systems commonly used in linguistics (barring wide- spread loan words, such as Soviet and perestroïka). This occasionally produces unex- pected patterns for mathematicians and historians. Shostakovich appears as Sostako- viõ and Khrushchev or Khrushchov as XruSõev.2 Accents are provided in Russian text which is presented for its linguistic interest, but not in proper names and technical terms. 1 The present writer apologizes for having adopted this practice, which is liable to confuse occasional read- ers. He should have employed a single system for numbering items, with numbers for the last digit in the main text and alphabetic characters in the footnotes. But he now shies away from the risk of introducing er- rors into the network of cross-references when changing the system. 2 The standard transliteration system for Russian characters is as follows: a: a e: e Kr k n: p &lt;J&gt;: f m: SO K&gt;: JU 6: b 5K: Ï JI: 1 p: r X: X 1»: " 51: ja B: V 3: Z M: m C: S l': C bl: y r: g H: i H: n T: t M: C b: ' ": fl: d Pi: j O: O y: U ID: § 3: è ': Xi</page><page sequence="9">Xii CONVENTIONS Symbols Phonetic and phonological symbols are used according to the conventions of the In- ternational Phonetic Association (I PA).1 The use of the mathematical symbols is according to generally accepted standards, and is explained in § 1.1.2ff. Sets of sets are indicated by bold sanserif capitals (H).2 The existential quantifier is denoted by V; the universal quantifier by A. 1 Cf. Pullum &amp; Ladusaw 1986. 2 The present writer is aware of the aesthetic disadvantages of some the typographical devices chosen. But the bold faces of the original fonts turned out to be insufficiently distinctive on the LaserWriter. References References consist of a code, e.g. Tici Giusti 1991 (8.3.2): 202". The code may contain three parts: 1 The label of the source, which usually contains two components: a The surname of the author(s) or editor(s): Tici Giusti", "Vinogradov &amp; Serebren- nikov". When three or more persons are involved only the first is mentioned: "Pierce &amp; al". When two persons occurring in the sources have the same sur- name, initials are added: "Uspenskij, B.A.", "Uspenskij, V.A.". If no authors are mentioned (or too many), the first word of the title or first sentence (Oí redakcü) or its abbreviation {BSE) is used. b The year of appearance of the source: "Stalin 1950". Further information on the source is given in the bibliography. In the labels the name of the author is kept constant: the label of a publication by Revzin always contains "Revzin", even if Revzin 1965a and Revzin 1967c appear to be written by "I.I. Revzine" and "Isaak Rewzin" respectively. All publications signed "O.S. Karpin- skaja" or "O.S. Revzina" are labelled "Revzina". The actual name which is provided with the publication is given in the bibliography. Small superscripts indicate the edition used: "Oiegov 197711". When two years are given, separated by a slash, the first year refers to the oldest known publica- tion of the title, while the second year indicates the source used by the present writer: "Reed &amp; Kellogg 1877/1987". The letters "ny" indicate that the year of publi- cation is not indicated in the source: "Pul'kina ny2". 2 The location of the passage cited or quoted in terms of the structure of the source (part, chapter, section). The location is added between brackets: "(8.3.2)". Many sources used circulate in various editions with different page numbers. Adding structural information enables, say, readers who have access to the Czech edition of Marcus' Lingvisticä matematica to trace back the references to the English or French translations of the Romanian original, and facilitates ordering photocopies of the relevant chapters. In the present study reference is made to the English editions of the sources if they were available to the writer. In many cases references to French, Russian and German editions have been added. 3 The page numbers, preceded by a colon: "Fici Giusti 1991 (8.3.2): 202".</page><page sequence="10">xiii Quotations Long quotations are given in 10-point letters in separate paragraphs. All quotations are given in English. Passages translated by the present writer are marked with r. Bibliography The bibliography contains the sources referred to in the text. It is by no means a complete bibliography on the Set-theoretical School but rather the top of the iceberg. Many references can be found in Marcus 1970, Revzin 1977, Revzina &amp; Srejder 1977, Gladkij &amp; Mel'ouk 1983, Mel'ouk 1988. Sources which the writer has not seen himself are marked with *. Besides bibliographical information each source code is provided with the numbers of the pages of the present study where the source is mentioned. Names When persons are adduced through their written works, they are accompanied by bibliographical sources and referred to by their surnames. When two persons are re- sponsible for the same source, their names are connected by &amp;. When persons are ad- duced without sources, the first occurrence is accompanied by their initials. E.g. "V.l. Lenin". If two persons mentioned in this study carry the same surname, initials are ad- ded throughout: "A.A. Zdanov" and "Ju.A. Zdanov".1 Names of persons occurring with- out sources are included without years in the bibliography (except for those of the most important exponents of the Set-theoretical School in Parts 1 to 5, which occur too often to index). Terms When rendering non-English terms, renderings used in the available English transla- tions have generally been adopted. Deviations from this practice are explicitly noted. The original terms are generally added except when back-translations are obvious. An effort has been made to provide the present study with a tight network of cross-references. The index of terms at the end of the second volume is intended as an additional safety net. The page numbers refer to the places where the most user- friendly information about a term is given. This is often but not always its first occur- rence or the formal definition of the corresponding concept. 1 The present writer is aware of the fact that giving initials instead of a first name is a continentalism. But since most sources used are continental, and full first names and patronymics are not always easy to find, this seems to be the most convenient consistent practice.</page><page sequence="11">TABLE OF CONTENTS Preface v Conventions xi Table of contents xiv INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER: THE CONTEXT 1 0.1 The objectives of this study 1 0.2 Philosophy of exposition 2 0.3 Paradigmatic shifts in Soviet linguistics 7 0.4 The political context of Soviet linguistics 11 0.5 Before Marr 16 0.6 Marr and the New Teaching on Language 16 0.7 Stalin's contribution to linguistics 39 0.8 Note on Stalin's reasons for deciding against Marr 44 0.9 Note on the previous history of the Pravda debate 54 0.10 Elements for a reconstruction of the Pravda debate 75 0.11 Soviet structuralism 101 0.12 Neo-Marrism Ill 0.13 Internalization versus bread and butter 125 0.14 Perestroika and after 130 0.15 Accounting for the present study's philosophy 132 0.16 The Set-theoretical School 133 0.17 Morphological categories 134 0.18 'Case and gender 135 0.19 A linguistic approach 135 0.20 The structure of the present study 136 1 METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS 138 1.0 INTRODUCTION 138 1.0.1 Kolmogorov's case 138 1.0.2 Delimitating the concept of model 138 1.0.3 Labels and their status 140 1.0.4 The meaning of Kolmogorov's questions 141 1.0.5 Terminology and commitment 142 1.0.6 The prescriptive attitude towards terminology 144 1.0.7 The descriptive attitude towards terminology 145 1.0.8 Terminology in the Set-theoretical School 146 1.0.9 A format for linguistic models 147 1.1 TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 150 1.1.1 Logical symbols as technical connectives 150 1.1.2 Some basic notions of set theory and symbolic logic 153 1.1.3 Power sets 158 1.1.4 Order 158 1.1.5 Relations 159 1.1.6 Exhaustiveness and exclusiveness: functions 160 1.1.7 Operations 163 1.1.8 Reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity 163 1.1.9 Equivalence 165 1.1.10 Tolerance 165 1.1.11 Dominance 166 1.1.12 Partitions 167 1.1.13 Systems of partitions: amalgamations and refinements 168 1.1.14 Systems of tolerance classes 169 1.1.15 Transitive closures and nucleus partitions 171 1.1.16 Hypostases 172 xiv</page><page sequence="12">XV 1.1.17 Progressive and regressive products 174 1.1.18 i^jmieCtivtiy i!r&lt;ï55'ei&gt; 1i7b 1.1.19 Class systems 177 1.1.20 The modelling power of class systems 178 1.1.21 Features 1 79 1.1.22 Feature dimensions 180 1.1.23 Dependent features 182 1.1.24 Class systems determined by feature systems 183 1.1.25 Synthetic features 187 1 . 1 .26 The role of class systems and feature systems in handling observed phenomena 1 90 1.1.27 Reality claims 192 1.1.28 Reality claims for technical connectives 195 1 .2 BASE COMPONENT (INITIAL OBJECTS) 199 1.2.1 Extensional and intensional base components 199 1.2.2 Reality claims for the base component 202 1 .2.3 Relational model; extensional base component; empty reality claim 203 1 .2.4 Relational model; extensional base component; specific reality claims 203 1 .2.5 Relational model; intensional base component; empty reality claim 203 1 .2.6 Relational model; intensional base component; specific reality claims 203 1 21 Algorithmic model; extensional base component; empty reality claim 205 1 .2.8 Algorithmic model; extensional base component; specific reality claims 205 1 .2.9 Algorithmic model; intensional base component; empty reality claim 205 1 .2. 1 0 Algorithmic model; intensional base component; specific reality claims 205 1 .2. 1 1 Calculus model; extensional base component; empty reality claim 206 1 .2. 1 2 Calculus model; extensional base component; specific reality claims 206 1 .2. 1 3 Calculus model; intensional base component; empty reality claim 206 1 .2. 1 4 Calculus model; intensional base component; specific reality claims 206 1.2.15 Conceptual versus material reality claims for base components 207 1.2.16 Finite and infinite base components 209 1.3 DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT (DERIVATIONS) 211 1.3.1 The determination of linguistic concepts 211 1.3.2 Categories 212 1.3.3 Linguistic typology 214 1.3.4 Constraints and universais 215 1 .3.5 Reality claims for the development component: no selection of derivations 216 1 .3.6 Reality claims for the development component: selection of derivations 217 1.3.7 Empirical interest 218 1.3.8 Models as devices for making predictions 221 1.4 LABELS 225 1.4.1 Extensional and intensional use of labels 225 1.4.2 Reality claims for labels 228 1.4.3 Constraints and spaces for extensional labels 231 1.4.4 Secondary intensional labels 235 1.5 PARTIAL AND SUBSTITUT!

In the present circumstances, Albrecht's proposed enterprise has only gained in importance. The Soviet period has turned into a closed chapter. Its cultural and scientific2 output must be preserved and made accessible for future use. Albrecht's enterprise has in fact become urgent. Oral history and non-public doc- uments are essential sources for explaining events which affected Soviet linguistics. In the present situation, these sources are finally accessible, but at the same time their preservation is less secure. The main responsibility for preserving and presenting Soviet linguistics lies with the former Soviet linguists and historians, who are now in a position to assess what linguists really meant and how their ideas came about. We must hope that the ex-So- viet linguists will have the opportunity and inspiration to do so. It is essential, how- ever, that western linguists indicate their own curiosity, present the ex-Soviet lin- guists with their perceptions of Soviet linguistics, and stimulate the ex-Soviets to cor- rect and complete the picture. Western linguists can concentrate their own investigations on traditions in Soviet linguistics where the comparative advantages of ex-Soviet investigators are modest. Such traditions are likely to be characterized by one or more of the following proper- ties: 1 Oral history plays a minor role. Publications present a reliable source for studying the developments in the tradition. 2 Cognitive thresholds are high. Complex denotational and terminological systems, exotic linguistic material, etc., render access to the material as difficult to unpre- pared ex-Soviets as to western investigators. 3 International participation plays an important role. 4 The problems addressed have also been dealt with by western traditions. Knowl- edge of western perceptions is helpful in bridging the gap to western frames of reference. The present study presents material for a preliminary contribution to Albrecht's Gesamtdarstellung in an area which possesses the above characteristics. These vol- umes contain an analysis of the principles, methods, and empirical work of an East Eu- ropean linguistic tradition which is referred to as the Kulagina School or the Set- theoretical School More particularly, this study presents and discusses the achieve- 1 Albrecht 1988 (4.4): 70. 2 In this chapter, science, scientist and scientific are used in their continental sense: unless indicated oth- erwise, they cover the social sciences and the humanities as well as the "exact" sciences.

This introductory chapter deals with the method of exposition. In §0.2 to §0.14, the reasons for adopting the present approach are expounded. This entails a brief survey of the history of the context of Soviet linguistics. From §0.16 onwards the reasons for selecting the Set-theoretical School, its morphosyntactic work and, in particular, its work on case and "gender1 will be presented. The structure of this study is described in §0.20. § 0.2 Philosophy of exposition The output of a past or alien research tradition can be approached in various ways. Presenting and evaluating it in terms of the traditions of one's own culture and time is a common method. This is the present ist style of writing history of science.1 Since liv- ing traditions are bound to condition the perceptions of the investigator and to consti- tute the frame of reference of his audience, the presentisi style cannot be avoided. Nevertheless, presentism as a basic attitude is a weak gambit. It imposes a filter which precludes the option of altering or enriching the domestic tradition with the perceptions which govern the tradition described. Exclusive presentism implies an un- necessary limitation on the instructive potential of a description. The present study results from an effort to adopt what could be called an anti-pre- sentist style of presentation. Russell, in his History of Western Philosophy, considers that the least we can do in order to surpass presentism is to adopt an attitude which seeks to overcome our perceptual limitations: In studying a philosopher, the right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first a kind of hypo- thetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like to believe in his theories, and only then a revival of the critical attitude, which should resemble, as far as possible, the state of mind of a person abandoning opinions which he has hitherto held. Contempt interferes with the first part of this process, and reverence with the second. Two things are to be remembered- that a man whose opinions and theories are worth studying may be presumed to have had some intelligence, but that no man is likely to have arrived at complete or final truth on any subject whatever. When an intelligent man ex- poses a view which seems to us obviously absurd, we should not attempt to prove that it is somehow true, but we should try to understand how it ever came to seem true. This exercise of historical and psy- chological imagination at once enlarges the scope of our thinking, and helps us to realize how foolish many of our own cherished prejudices will seem to an age which has a different temper of mind.2 The same may be assumed to apply to the description of past or alien scientific tradi- tions. Adopting Russell's attitude considerably adds to the workload of the historian of science. But Kuhn points out that, in its application Russell's injunction fails to take another limitation into account. 1 Cf. Murray 1981: 108; Murray's example is the treatment of past and non-dominant linguistic theories in Newmeyer 1980. ¿ Russell 196 12 (1.4): 58.</page><page sequence="25">THE CONTEXT 3 Though [Russell's injunction] has extended the proper subject matter of the historian of science to the entire context of ideas, it remains internal history in the sense that it pays little attention to the insti- tutional or socio-economic context within which the sciences have developed.1 In other words, a serious description of alien traditions requires not only empathy with the underlying assumptions of the involved individuals but also investigation of the external factors which condition these assumptions. This increases the complexity of the task of the science historian. If the latter rejects the old deterministic Marxist view according to which science, being a category of the superstructure of society,2 is fully conditioned by the socio-economic context, he must seek to disentangle the internal and external aspects of the theories described. But this is not all. Conceivably, external factors may condition the output of a re- search tradition in two ways. 1 The socio-economic context may affect the way in which scientific investigators think, and, consequently, affect the choice of their paradigms, topics, and commu- nication patterns. The exponents of the tradition have internalized the values and perceptions of the surrounding society: they identify problems and solutions in terms of the structure, beliefs and explicit needs of their society, because they are not aware of possible alternatives or reject them. 2 The socio-economic context may affect the way in which investigators communi- cate, without necessarily affecting their way of thinking. Investigators mould their ideas and results in specific phrasings in order to gain an audience, acceptance, or funding, even when they know that the adopted phrasings are not relevant to the issues and may in fact obscure certain aspects which the authors tacitly consider relevant. It is even conceivable that integral conceptual frameworks and research topics are simply imposed on a research community: its members do not believe in them but nevertheless conform in order to survive, or make the discipline survive. This is the bread-and-butter interpretation of Kuhn's socio-economic context. In any complete account of a philosopher or a research tradition, the distinction be- tween internalized and bread-and-butter categories should be applied. As an illustration of the above distinctions, consider Occam's razor, a principle which underlies a great deal of the material that is treated in this study. The term is used to refer to a broadly accepted principle of economy in scientific method. Occam's razor bans the use of redundant variables when accounting for phenomena, and the use of redundant undefined terms in definitions of concepts. It is usually for- mulated as "entities are not to be multiplied without necessity",3 and is ascribed to the philosopher William of Occam ica. 1285-1349). As pointed out by Thorbum, Occam 1 Kuhn 1977 (6): 150. Russell himself in fact strove to involve the social context in his history of philos- ophy [Russell 196 12]. 2 The Marxist concept of superstructure will return every now and then in this chapter. It comprises culture in its widest sense: the complex of ideological relationships and conceptions (politics, law, morals, reli- gion, art, etc.) and their corresponding organizations (state, church, etc.) as determined by the base of a so- ciety, i.e. the network of its production relationships. The term superstructure is also used to denote a sin- gle category within the superstructure in the first sense. Thus, "a superstructure" and "a category of the su- perstructure" are synonymous expressions. 6 "Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem".</page><page sequence="26">4 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER himself did not make mention of the formula,1 although he repeated an older one, saying that "it is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer",2 i.e. if in a given science everything can be interpreted without assuming this or that hypothetical en- tity, there is no ground for assuming it.3 The shift from the instrumental interpretation, which is implicit in the original for- mula ("it is vain to do with more ..."), to the later ontological interpretation ("the things that are must not be multiplied ...") has resulted from a process of rumination of Occam's ideas by philosophers and scientists from different epochs, and may distort our picture of his thinking. In one place, Occam states that entities may only be posited if: 1 their existence is evident from observation, or: 2 their existence can be derived from evident entities by means of reasoning, or: 3 their existence is required by the Holy Writ.4 The first and the second types of entity belong to the standard tool kit of modern sci- ence and inspire Occam's razor. The third type, which imposes a limit on the applica- bility of the other types, tends to be omitted in later accounts of Occam's views, be- cause of its apparent irrelevance to present-day thought. Now if, in dealing with Occam's thinking, one seeks to go beyond the presentist attitude, one must nevertheless take account of the third type of entity, and seek to find out whether it is an integral part of Occam's conception: this would satisfy Russell's injunction. It may not be possible to decide whether Occam's assumption of the third type of entity only represents a boundary condition for Occam's system. But, regardless of this question, the complete historian should also take into account the question of whether Occam had internalized the values making him add the third type, or had only added it for conventional reasons. Of course, such questions do not find an easy answer. Due to the limitations of our own frame of reference, any reconstruction of Occam's thinking is bound to be a distortion.5 But the present writer adheres to the normative view that the attitude which prompts the questions is superior to the attitude which prompts ignoring them. In describing the Set-theoretical School, however, the present writer has not suc- ceeded in adopting the complete historian's attitude. The basic attitude adopted in this study is the one prescribed by Russell. The proposals of the Set-theoretical School will be studied in their mutual relationships and in their relationships to other tradi- tions, as well as in relation to the problems which they purport to solve. But the pro- posals are taken at face value: no effort will be made to interpret them in terms of Kuhn's institutional and socio-economic contexts, let alone in terms of internalized and imposed values. iThorburn 1918: 350-352. 2 "Frustra fit per plura, quod potest fieri per pauciora": cf. Cloeren 1984: 1094. 0 Russell 196 12 (2.2.14): 463. 4 "Nihil débet poni sine ratione assignata nisi sit per se notum vel per experientiam scitum vel per auctori- tatem Scripturae Sacrae probatum": cf. Cloeren 1984: 1094. 5 And certainly the present one, which has been adduced here for two reasons: for the sake of a simple ex- ample and for narrative reasons. Occam's razor, in its modern interpretation, will play a role in the discus- sion of the models produced by the Set-theoretical School.</page><page sequence="27">THE CONTEXT 5 This is not something that should be taken for granted. Contextual factors played a decisive role in the development of East European linguistics. But there are two rea- sons for nevertheless leaving the socio-economic context outside of explicit consid- eration, at least in the main body of the present study. 1 In adopting the complete historian's attitude when dealing with individual thinkers and investigators, the task of assessing which aspects of socio-economic conditioning must be ascribed to internalization and which to bread-and-butter questions seems to be manageable.1 But it becomes more complex when both Kuhn's and Russell's assessment criteria have to be applied to an entire research tradition: one investigator's convictions may be another investigator's conventions.2 Because of the complexity of the interaction between Soviet linguistics and its external con- text, it is beyond the present writer's possibilities to take consistent account of the external context of the linguistic viewpoints of the Set-theoretical School when dealing with the contents. 2 It may be argued that ignoring the socio-economic context of the Set-theoretical School is less harmful than ignoring that of most other East-European linguistic traditions. In other words, the assumption that contextual factors affected the re- search output of the Set-theoretical School to a lesser extent than the output of many other traditions is defensible. These reasons require amplification. The body of this introductory chapter, starting with §0.3, will discuss those aspects of the external context of Soviet linguistics which prompt, and hopefully justify, the treatment that is adopted in the present study. Thus, by leaving the impact of the social context out of consideration, the present treatment of the Set-theoretical School falls short of Kuhn's standards for the com- plete historian of science. In other respects, however, the present writer intends to do more than a historian of science would do: 1 The function of the present enterprise is not restricted to elucidation. The actual proposals of the Set-theoretical School will be dealt with in a way that, at first sight, goes beyond the type of sympathy advocated by Russell. The school is treated as if it were a living tradition, in which one can still participate: it is im- plicitly assumed that the development of the tradition can be affected by the view- points which are expounded in this study. As a factual assumption, this treatment is hardly warranted: important expo- nents of the Set-theoretical School have died or have abandoned its methods. There are two reasons for ignoring this circumstance and for treating the tradition as if it were fully alive. a To the extent of our present knowledge, the withering of the Set-theoretical School is not due to its internal dynamics but to identifiable external circum- stances, which will be expanded upon in the present chapter. The attitude which prompts the present treatment of the Set-theoretical School follows naturally 1 Russell in fact ventures a statement on the status of Occam's categories of the third type: he considers that it would be wrong to think of Occam as an unbeliever [Russell 1959: 163]. 2 Of course this applies to individuals as well. The convictions of a person may with time turn into conventions, and his conventions may turn into unquestioned truths. But the magnitude of the assessment problem increases with the number of minds involved.</page><page sequence="28">6 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER from Russell's injunction: viewed from inside, the tradition is open-ended and entitled to a treatment which either leads to its continuation or to a proper conclusion. b The present writer believes that the fundamental problems posed by the Set- theoretical School have not only remained unresolved, but are as topical at pre- sent as they were when first posed. They still await a solution. On account of this conviction, the body of the present volumes contains not only contributions to normal science1 within the tradition, but also proposals for modifying the ba- sic theoretical framework without abandoning the identified problems. 2 Besides contributions within the tradition of the Set-theoretical School, the present study contains endeavours to transcend the theoretical material, i.e. to determine the similarities and differences of the constructs proposed by the Set-theoretical School in terms of properties which the exponents of the tradition themselves did not explicitly use. The basis for comparison is what can be called a format for the theories of the Set-theoretical School, and is worked out in Part I.2 The format en- ables extrapolation: it accommodates constructs which were not actually proposed by the Set-theoretical School but might have been developed for enhancing the empirical adequacy of the original proposals. Some of these constructs are worked out and tested in the present study, and constitute the present writer's contribu- tions to "normal science". Moreover, as a weak claim, the format is also proposed as accommodating linguistic theories that have been developed outside the Set-theo- retical School. In Parts 2 to 5, the constructs as proposed by the Set-theoretical School are grouped and treated according to their properties in terms of the format. Consequently, in the presentation of the models, the "structural" properties of the constructs of the Set- theoretical School will be allowed to override their chronological order. Thus, the output of the Set-theoretical School is approached at various levels. 1 The proposals will be presented and compared to alternative proposals in terms of the format. Their relationships with cognate ideas outside the Set-theoretical School will also be indicated. 2 The performance of the proposals will be illustrated by and tested against con- crete linguistic material. 3 Amendments will be proposed within the conceptual framework of the tradition, but the internal development of the conceptual framework itself will also be explored, as well as options for further development. This approach represents an attempt to embody the anti-presentist ambition of the present treatment of the Set-theoretical School: instead of representing alien tradi- tions as facets of domestic ones, the study attempts to ascend to the vantage point of an alien tradition, to envisage not only its own output, but even certain facets of do- mestic traditions. The risk that the frame of reference of the alien tradition deforms 1 Normal science in the sense of Kuhn 19702 i2h 10: "research firmly based upon one or more past scien- tific achievements, achievements that some particular scientific community acknowledges for a time as supplying the foundation for its further practice". 2 Fillmore's [1962 (1): 7ff.] format for phonological theories has to some extent served as a model for the present one.</page><page sequence="29">THE CONTEXT 7 domestic traditions to the extent that they are no longer recognizable for their own exponents is accepted here. After all, this is what usually happens to the alien tradi- tion. § 0.3 Paradigmatic shifts in Soviet linguistics In the preceding section it was suggested that the present treatment of the Set-theo- retical School is based on two assumptions which may not be fully warranted. These assumptions may crudely be formulated as follows: 1 the authors of the models mean what they write; 2 the present study continues the tradition of the school, i.e. potentially affects its development. This and the following sections treat aspects of the institutional and socio-economic context which must justify these assumptions. In many respects the Soviet Union represented a laboratory of social mechanisms and organization:1 the massive scale of the organizational and social changes, the longue durée of the experiments, and the general absence of interference by factors external to the Soviet system offer the world an opportunity to empirically examine the implications, in their undiluted appearance, of various theoretical viewpoints held in this field. Exploration of this mine of data, and application of the findings in more diluted contexts in other regions of the world, has hardly begun. The history of Soviet linguistics must be, and has been, of interest to investigators of paradigmatic shifts and their socio-economic contexts. It is marked by chronic out- bursts of large-scale polemic public debates on the theoretical foundations of linguis- tics, or on the goals and objects of linguistic theory. Such debates filled books and journals at irregular intervals. Six highlights can be distinguished: the two discussions of 1929-1932, and the discussions of 1948-1950, 1956-1959, 1965-1966, and 1972- 1974. In some cases, mass conversions to new research paradigms appeared to ensue: this seems to contradict the demographic view of paradigmatic take-overs, which Planck characterizes as follows: A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.2 The reasons for the broad debates, which interrupted periods of relative tranquillity, deserve examination, both in their own right and for their exposure of the external context of Soviet linguistics, which is at the present moment only partly accessible for direct research. Raskin, who gives an account of the 1972-1974 episode, indicates three possible causes for the course of events: 1 a need for a bona fide academic discussion which concentrates on the foundations of linguistics and, therefore, goes beyond the borders of the field into philosophy; 2 a game of musical chairs, i.e. of politicking and squeezing one's opponents out of their chairs and tenures; 1 Cf. Pálóczy-Horváth 1964 (0.1): 12. 2 Planck 1949: 33-34. The demographic view is often ascribed to Kuhn himself, who in fact [19702 (12): 149-1581 subscribes to a moderate version of it, by allowing for persuasion and conversion of groups of mature practitioners.</page><page sequence="30">8 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER 3 execution in linguistics of a purely ideological policy of the hardening attitude towards "bourgeois idealists" and putting up an increasing resistance to the alleged Western "ideological attack". * The question of whether Raskin's reasons represent plausible patterns of behaviour will be discussed presently. Many scientists will acknowledge that Raskin's bona fide academic discussions on the foundations of a discipline are a common phenomenon, but what must be explained is the pattern of their occurrence. The series of outbursts of such discussions and the relative calm in between, presuppose a periodic collective awareness of the need for them. But, although most serious investigators are likely to experience a few dead- locks in their dealings with the theoretical foundations of their discipline, it is quite improbable that their awareness of such deadlocks appears both spontaneously and simultaneously. The outbursts of debate which were listed above do not seem to have been triggered by specific spectacular and unexpected linguistic discoveries which might have shaken the discipline. A more plausible cause of the debates is that the deadlock is spotted by those linguists who think that they know how to get out of it, and try to sell both the problem and the solution. But even then, an explanation must be found for the rapid spread of the discussions and the scale and intensity of the re- actions of other linguists. Something more must have been at stake. Raskin's musical chairs, too, represent a common phenomenon. Most respectable linguists have learned to renounce certain human values and to suppress a certain sense of guilt in order to become respectable linguists. During their research, they have had to gain a comparative advantage by fostering sufficient arrogance to assign higher priorities to their linguistic hunches and uncertainties than to concrete soci- etal, social, and family obligations. When this behaviour pays off and yields respecta- ble scientific results, it is only a small step to valuing one's own scientific curiosities and priorities above those of one's colleagues in situations where the development and promulgation of one's ideas depends on obtaining a share of scarce facilities and Nachwuchs. By itself, however, this behaviour does not necessarily generate broad debates on the foundations of the discipline. The outbursts of discussion are only likely to occur in a setting where they pay off, i.e. when the participants believe that participation either provides technical gains for their views or limits the losses. Since some of the Soviet public debates on linguistics took place in periods when the lin- guistic institutes, university departments and editorial boards were experiencing a considerable turnover, musical chairs games may actually have been involved. But this does not fully explain the mechanism: why do nationwide debates on the mission of a discipline result in organizational and personal changes? Who assesses the outcome of the discussions? This takes us to Raskin's third potential reason. Ap- parently, the broad discussions produced a platform which facilitated the implemen- tation of a conditioning relation between the research community and its socio-eco- nomic context. We must assume a mechanism by which discussions within a discipline were di- gested into signals to an outside power, which drew its conclusions, which in turn were imposed on research practice within the discipline. This mechanism must be of 1 Raskin 1978: 257.</page><page sequence="31">THE CONTEXT 9 some general interest: similar practices are regularly devised and introduced in other countries.1 As was pointed out in §0.2, there are two ways in which Kuhn's socio-eco- nomic context may affect the behaviour of researchers: through internalization of the dominant values, and through bread-and-butter incentives. The question of which type of interaction took place in Soviet linguistics is subject to debate. We must wonder why linguists should be prepared to tolerate their profes- sional behaviour being constrained by exigencies formulated by non-linguists. Bruche-Schulz adduces the 1929-1932 and 1948-1950 discussions of Soviet linguistics as evidence supporting the internalization interpretation of the socio-economic con- text.2 In her view, the new social, political and economic organization of society cre- ated by the revolution determined a new "collective subjectivity" among scientists. This phenomenon is ignored in western descriptions of Soviet science but must be taken into account if we wish to produce *"an unprejudiced, non-schematic view of the characteristics of alien, only seemingly familiar, scientific methods and intentions".3 Bruche-Schulz regrets that western observers do not take seriously the general as- sent of Soviet linguists to the "epistemological voluntarism"4 which pervaded them in the 1920s and 1930s. According to Bruche-Schulz, Western observers fail to explain that: Uhe defendants and exponents of Stalinic [Stalinsch) culture and science policy did not act as "Stalin- ists" because they adhered, like blind fanatics, to an idée fixe, but because they carried out historical ten- dencies which, even when they were often not understood by the actors themselves, resulted from neces- sity in a country busy catching up with capitalist development and against the specific background of the cultural and political traditions of the Soviet peopled The early discussions then must be interpreted as bona fide attempts to respond to the exigencies of the new society by linguists who, though having embraced the new order, are curbed by their pre-revolutionary frames of reference.6 Bruche-Schulz uses the texts produced during the 1929-1932 and 1948-1950 discussions in order to call into question the "topos" of science as an enterprise which proceeds in isolation and freedom.7 Bruche-Schulz's scientists readily consent to being guided by the values of their society. Raskin's account of the 1965-1966 and 1972-1974 discussions, on the other hand, portrays a world of musical chairs. It is not societal needs that determine loyalties but networks of researchers. People propose discontinuing each other's research. Ideo- 1 At the moment of writing, in the early 1990s, the Netherlands is developing such a system for state- sponsored research.

For the term epistemological voluntarism Bruche-Schulz refers to Lecourt 1976 {5k 147, where it denotes the terminal point in the development of Soviet dialectical materialism. Developed as epistemological instruments, the theses of dialectical material- ism are first turned into metascientif ic laws, ruling the laws of the sciences, and subsequently into moral values: after all, if science, belonging to the superstructure, is of a class character, then so are its laws. If the state determines the superstructure, as during the Stalin Deriod the state rules the laws of nature. 5 Bruche-Schulz 1984 Í22}. 51. 6 Bruche-Schulz 1984: (Einleitung): 2-3. 7 Bruche-Schulz 1984 (4.4): 146.</page><page sequence="32">1 0 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER logical arguments only serve as ammunition in the conflicts. Such behaviour perfectly suits our western frames of reference. The continuation and promulgation of one's re- search depends ultimately on the agent who provides the means. Depending on the circumstances, such means may include funding, facilities, or exemption from harass- ment or arrest. If research is funded on the basis of student numbers, the investigator of subjects that are popular with students has an advantage. In an institute run by a ministry, it is only natural to conduct research that may be assumed to serve the min- ister's policies and priorities. When authorities require research to have an ideologi- cal bias, the investigators whose research is compatible with the bias, or can be rep- resented as being so, have the advantage. The required amount and type of ideologi- cal ammunition and the setting of the battlefield are determined by the specific cir- cumstances. In this, bread-and-butter, interpretation of the broad public discussions on the subject of linguistics, it is not immediately clear they are deemed to contribute to the execution of research priorities. There seem to be alternative ways to implement one's policies. Possibly, the discussions served as a means of information. The Soviet Union was a centralized state: the linguists who were expected to set the trends were active at the institutes of the Academy of Sciences, mainly located in Moscow and Leningrad, and at the universities of these cities.1 The debates enabled both the in- vestigators and the authorities in the rest of the country to adapt their behaviour without further explicit instructions. Besides, the debates may have served as a buffer between specialists and policy makers. On the one hand, assuming that Bruche-Schulz's views are at least partly cor- rect and some linguists supported certain policies on the basis of their conviction, their public support might have gained acceptance for such policies within the broader research community. On the other hand, authorities may not always have been sure which policies to require, and depended on arguments and information from the research community itself. The party organization within the research organiza- tions occupied a pivotal position: here the research community and the authorities intersected. Speaking out as linguists, party people could increase the legitimacy of the policies of the authorities by representing them as the product of a bottom-up process, but they could also use their authority as linguists in order to influence the process of formulating the policies. Since Bruche-Schulz and Raskin describe different discussions, their accounts do not necessarily contradict each other: the early discussions may have resulted from an internalization process, while the later ones may have been musical chairs games. On the other hand, there is a considerable consistency in the arguments involved, and the discussions partly involve the same participants. Moreover, conflicting statements have been made about specific discussions. Girke &amp; Jachnow, for example, regard the 1929-1932 discussion, which Bruche-Schulz considers an instance of internalization, as a musical chairs game.2 If we wish to assess the extent to which the output of the 1 The research institutes of the Soviet Academy of Sciences were large.

S 0.4 The political context of Soviet linguistics The question of whether and why linguistic research would be expected to be subject to outside requirements rarely entered the discussions themselves. Instructions from outside did not formally exist (but were implicit in editorials which rounded off the discussions), or were simply imposed (like the 1959 instruction to use more structural- ist and mathematical methods1). But the point was implicitly brought up in Abaev 1965, a paper which purported to start a discussion that would herald a new era in Soviet linguistics. In his analysis of the history of Soviet linguistics, Abaev distinguished three eras prior to the one being heralded 1 the "Marrist" period, dominated by N.Ja. Marr's "New Teaching on Language" {Novoe uõenie ob jazyke2), and abruptly terminated in 1950, by the famous Pravda discussion; 2 the "Stalinist" period, which started in 1950 and ended with destalinization-, 3 the contemporary "nihilist" period, which Abaev expected to terminate, and which was characterized by the absence of moving principles. Abaev speaks of "an idejnyj vacuum":3 the word idejnyj is usually rendered as 'ideological', like ideologideskij, but is distinct from the latter word by its including various moral connotations in- stead of suggesting exactness, systematism and explicitness. In a reply to Abaev's paper the mathematician Gladkij, who made major contributions to theoretical linguistics in that period, pointed out that Abaev's periodization did not reflect the essence of the matter. rOnly fruitful ideas and major discoveries can be landmarks in the history of a science. [... Abaev's] peri- odization does not relate to the history of Soviet linguistics, but to the history of the administrative pressure which is exerted on it.4 Thus, in this discussion, the internalized version of Kuhn's socio-economic context and the bread-and-butter version were in direct opposition. Abaev's moving principles were Gladkij's administrative pressure. Gladkij's remarks may sound reasonable but, to linguists of Abaev's generation, who were trained in the Marrist period, they came from a different planet. Gladkij regarded the standards for fertility and importance as self-evident, whereas Abaev raised the question by which yardsticks the fertility and importance of ideas and discoveries were to be measured. Here we find a clash between the research cultures of mathematics and linguistics. Disciplines diverge as to the ways in which assessment yardsticks for assessing their achievements are established. Yardsticks may be imposed implicitly or explicitly, be formulated outside or within the research community, and apply collectively or di- verge among groups within the discipline. In the Soviet Union, as everywhere, the 1 Cf.

Besides that, all research was theoretically subject to considerations derived from Marxism. Science was considered to belong to the superstructure, i.e. to be a human activity the contents of which are determined by the base, the economic structure of society. In the old deterministic view, according to which the superstructure is automatically determined by the base, the position of science in the superstructure did not require explicit ideological attention: in a socialist society, scientists could only produce so- cialist science. In I.V. Stalin's Soviet Union, however, the orthodox view was replaced, at first implicitly, later explicitly, by the view that the base consciously constructs its superstructure, the state acting as its agent.1 Scientific research was increasingly subjected to guidelines, prompted by whatever Marxist views happened to be domi- nant. There were two consequences. 1 On the one hand, this implied prescription of the way in which scientific activities should be organized and conducted, even independent of the object of investiga- tion. This conclusion was only drawn after a decade of Soviet rule. The old Academy of Sciences, the major organization for scientific research in the country, had largely been left intact throughout the 1920s. It even retained the same secretary from 1904 until 1929: S.F. Ol'denburg.2 The latter was not just an anonymous scien- tist: he had been minister of education in the 1917 provisional government,3 which had been overthrown by the communists in October. But major changes came about around 1929, the year of the "Great Break (pere- lom)' when science was reorganized and the edinonaõalie ('one-man-management') principle was introduced. Much of the pluralism that had continued to exist was then eliminated. The Academy and its institutes had to merge with research institu- tions which partly covered the same fields. It absorbed the institutes of the Russian Organization of Research Institutes for the Social Sciences (RANION4), which had been extablished in the early twenties to assist social scientists in their conversion to the positions of Marxism.5 The Academy also accommodated research institutes that were run by the Ministry of Education, Narkompros. In the 1930s the Academy of Sciences incorporated the Communist Academy and moved from Leningrad to Moscow. It was streamlined into an organization in which every unit monopolized a field or discipline and took decisions on the adoption of paradigms for the research conducted in the field. Henceforth, pluralism could only continue to exist where the research culture of a discipline protected it. 2 On the other hand, certain disciplines were subject to additional ideological inter- ference, depending on whether their cognitive objects belonged to the superstruc- 1 Cf.

Ideological import, or, if one wishes, the amount of ammunition with which the ideology could furnish the parties of a musical chairs game, varied accordingly. Ideological involvement could also be encouraged or curbed by the height of the cognitive thresholds of a discipline and the professional loyalties that were contingent on the thresholds. It turned out to be difficult for an ideologist to exercise ideological control of chemistry without becoming a chemist, and to be hard to become a chemist without developing a loyalty towards the traditional assumptions and conventions of chemistry. In the social and cultural sciences, on the other hand, ideological and pro- fessional loyalties were almost inextricably linked: the spell of an, in Bruche-Schulz's terms, ^analytically blind voluntarist action ethic" was strongest for these disciplines.1 Nevertheless, with sufficient determination the ideology could demolish high thresh- olds, as is illustrated by the adventures of Soviet biology, which was subjugated to T.D. Lysenko's regime.2 The potential of a discipline to "blackmail" the economy could also affect its ideo- logical sensitivity. There are, after all, limits to the attractiveness of ideological in- volvement in engineering if such involvement affects the construction speed and quality of bridges. A discipline like mathematics was located at the far end of all spectrums. Although mathematics was considered a bourgeois science, its results were considered objec- tively valid.3 This to a certain extent spared its students from ideological control. At the same time the cognitive thresholds of mathematics were high, which produced a high level of professional loyalty. Moreover, the results of mathematics were consid- ered to be categorically useful, through their application in other disciplines. This re- duced the need to prescribe specific research objectives from outside. Added to the implicit agreement on yardsticks within the research culture of mathematics itself, this ensured an almost idyllic research climate. Typically, the 1929-1931 attempt to discipline the scientists, an attempt which the other natural sciences silently accom- modated without selling their souls, was enough to produce an open rebellion among the mathematicians, who refused either to conform to dialectical materialism or to give up fundamental research.4 Physics occupied a similar position. Ideological pressure was at its height in the late forties, when biology had been subjugated to the rituals and the militant journal Voprosy filosofa ('Problems of Philosophy') disclosed the presence in Soviet physics of philosophical idealism5 and kowtowing to western physics. But the physicists resisted interference on the part of the ideology. In the late forties, at a meeting which was 1 Bruche-Schulz 1984 &lt;22}. 50. 2 There is a considerable literature on Lysenko.

Ioffe, director of the Physico-Technical Institute in Leningrad, himself a party member, presented the officials with a choice. The physicists could either work in their laboratories and develop the atom bomb or waste their time on assemblies and leave the research up to the party officials. The latter backed down.3 The official re- habilitation, in 1955, of the long embattled theory of relativity4 marked the indepen- dence of physics and adjacent disciplines from ideological control. Most of the humanities were located at the opposite end of most spectrums, along with the social sciences. As Joravsky put it, [...] presumably [...] slowly acquired professional competence was considered less important in the social sciences and the humanities, the special field of the communist institutions, than it was in the natural sciences.^ In 1947 Academy members and directors of research institutes in the natural sci- ences were nearly all born in the last century,6 but the philosopher P.F. Judin had al- ready started running the Academy Institute of Philosophy only one year after grad- uating from it.7 The social sciences and the humanities provided the sources of Marxism. They could not be considered as contributing to the economy in a technical sense, and had low cognitive thresholds. Consequently, social scientists, historians and philosophers were generally expected to share the values of the authorities. The shared values were enhanced by the communists' initial research priorities of the 1920s, which had produced RANION and the Communist Academy, with their numer- ous institutes in the social sciences and the humanities.8 The musical chairs games that were triggered by the mergers during the Great Break provided ample opportu- nities to use the available ideological ammunition. But as long as the values of the re- searchers and the policy makers were actually shared there were few problems. Linguistics, like economics or biology, occupied a somewhat ambivalent position. On the one hand, language found itself on the interface between the individual and material reality, as well as on the interface between the individual and the collective. 1 In the first edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopaedia [BSE 34 1937 (kosmopolitizm): 431], cosmopolit- ism was described, in a few lines, as an uninteresting philosophical concept from antiquity. In the second edition almost three columns were devoted to cosmopolitism, which was then: *a reactionary bourgeois ideology, which rejects national traditions and national sovereignty, propagat- ing an indifferent attitude to one's country and one's national culture, and demanding the establishment of a "world state" and of "world citizenship".

Pavlov himself, and was derided with the punny epithet sobaéij institut, "doggish" institute, which in Russian may refer both to the dogs used in the research and to the poor state of research [Joravsky 1961 (2.4): 67].</page><page sequence="37">THE CONTEXT 15 This made language a core problem for a social ideologist: the deterministic Marxist view that human thought is conditioned by economic structure,1 and W. von Hum- boldt's popular view that thought determines language while language affects thought,2 made linguistics an ideological discipline. Possibly, the assumed intercon- nection between thought and language also held out some vague prospects to those interested in social engineering. In the thirties, Abaev pointed out that the language of future generations was bound to be a language of extreme ^technization": rFrom top to bottom a consistent system; maximum simplicity combined with maximum flexibility and diversity of means of expression; liquidation of the outdated "polysemantism" [...I these are the char- acteristics of a language which is destined to fulfil the responsible function of being the most perfect communication device in a classless society.3 On the other hand, linguistics could also boast of being an applied discipline in a more down-to-earth sense. It was required to produce concrete applications to aid the construction of a truly egalitarian society: orthographies, grammars, teaching mate- rials and dictionaries had to be developed to implement the equal rights of the 130 languages of the Soviet Union. However, the technical status of linguistics is not as unchallenged as that of math- ematics or physics. Language is an everyday phenomenon. Everyone knows a lan- guage or two, especially in the Soviet Union. True, actual linguistic research on spe- cific languages entails high cognitive thresholds, which leave little room for the appli- cation of yardsticks by non-specialists and may be expected to reduce the accessibil- ity of linguistics as a hunting ground for research policy makers. But the resulting professional loyalties tend to develop among specialists of the specific languages, rather than being transferred to linguistics as a whole. Thus, professional loyalty may be expected to be low for accessible languages, such as the native language of the ideologists, but higher for the more exotic languages and for the adherents of highly technical research paradigms. Perhaps these mixed indications for ideological involvement explain the fact that Soviet linguistics in the course of its history underwent so many paradigmatic shocks. But the specific bizarre episodes that actually occurred and are to explain the rise and fall of the Set-theoretical School cannot fully be accounted for by the above gen- eral observations. The actual course of events must probably be accounted for by accidental circumstances and personal idiosyncracies as much as by general princi- ples. The 1965 debate, which failed to produce any substantial changes, shows that not all debates were orchestrated in their details. In fact, the patterns of the individual debates diverge considerably and contain unexpected turns. Abaev's account, which presents the history of Soviet linguistics until 1965 as consisting of Marrism, Stalinism and nihilism, a division which is also found in later sources, such as Raskin 1978, does not provide the information which is essential to account for the transitions. Changes in the context of linguistics are due to specific events and persons, which are, therefore, relevant to the way in which the 1 Cf.

It is expedient to include a short ac- count of the specific contextual vicissitudes of Soviet linguistics. § 0.5 Before Marr Viewed from the linguists' vantage point, the history of Soviet linguistics looks clut- tered with interventions on the part of politics and ideology. From the vantage point of politics, however, the picture looks different. Barring the 1950 episode, to be de- scribed in §0.7, there is no indication that the interest of politicians in linguistics ex- ceeded their interest in other sciences. The real battlefields were elsewhere, in such disciplines as history and philosophy. Abaev's periodization, as reported in §0.4, leaves one period out of consideration: the 1920s. It is true that Marr was already active at the time. He had been lobbying for an institute since 1910 and was given his Caucasian Historical-Archaeological In- stitute in 1917.1 His famous Japhetic Institute was founded in 1921, but it consisted of no more than a room in his apartment.2 Marr was not influential in linguistics. The 1920s represent a flourishing period of Soviet linguistics and lacked ideologi- cal guidelines beyond the zeal of individual linguists. Naturally, quite a few prominent linguists had started to study the relation between language and society, and devel- oped strongly divergent approaches.3 Furthermore, whilst new emphasis was laid on the development of the numerous languages of the Soviet Union, a great deal of com- parative and regular descriptive work continued to be done, especially on little- known non-Indo-European languages. Moreover, important original theoretical re- search was conducted on Russian syntax, the philosophy of language and poetic lan- guage. The formalist school of literary criticism was to have great impact on western linguistics through such eminent emigrants as N.S. Trubeckoj and R.O. Jakobson. The leading Soviet linguist of the period was the young communist (since 1919) E.D. Polivanov (1891-1938), who was both an all-round linguist and a specialist in lan- guages of East and Central Asia, as well as a theorist on the relationship between lan- guage and society. He considered language the product of the need for human co-op- eration, and linguistic change to be conditioned by socio-economic and technical change.4 In the late 1920s Polivanov occupied a number of key positions in scientific organizations, including that of president of the linguistics section of RANI ON.5 S 0.6 Marr and the New Teaching on Language A watershed must be assumed in 1929, when edinonadalie was introduced, and Marr was launched as the responsible naoal'nik ('chief') of linguistics. Marr fits the cliché of the creative scientist in his fifties who has done a great deal of decent work, realizes that he has reached his last chance to produce a great breakthrough, and is tired of the boring data which block his creativity. He allows 1 Mixankova 19493 (4): 246. 2 At the Sed'maja Linija on the Vasil'evskij Ostrov in Leningrad- cf.

The immediate environment is kept silent or at a distance by the use of the acquired power, which also enables this scientist to build up a following among the next generation, who are attracted by his anti-traditional attitude and the prospect of future jobs, a blend which favours successful scientific revolutions.2 This general characterization does not represent a psychological analysis but a recurrent be- havioural pattern, which occurs in both fiction and reality in such bourgeois countries as the Netherlands.3 In the Soviet Union of the period, however, the consequences of such behaviour were more far-reaching. Some investigators account for Marr's behaviour in terms of bona fide motives of an ethical and political nature. Thomas points out that, even if Marr's theories were qua theories ad hoc, they were coherent with respect to a consistent underlying goal: proving that minor languages, such as Marr's native Georgian, cannot be excluded from the mainstream of the development of humanity. In pursuing this goal, Marr de- fied the pre-revolutionary linguistic tradition, which neglected languages without a pedigree as they could not contribute to the impressive intellectual monument of Indo-European linguistics.4 Bruche-Schulz regards Marr's democratic and anti-impe- rialist considerations as the principal driving force for his crusade against compara- tive linguistics.5 Marr published hundreds of pages each year; the literature on Marr's post- 1920 ideas is also enormous. Yet the task of providing an accurate account of Marr's ideas is complicated by a number of circumstances: 1 As a result of the initial lack of interest abroad and the as yet only partly lifted black-out on pre-1935 Soviet culture by post- 1935 Stalinism, obtaining access to a great deal of primary sources represents a separate enterprise, which is beyond the scope of the present study. 2 Marr's ideas are often described as incoherent and inconsistent. At any rate, they were in a constant state of flux: Marr himself made a habit of disavowing his earlier conceptions. This turns any presentation of Marr's ideas as a self-sufficient system into an artificial construction, something which never really existed. 3 As will be pointed out below, Marr's views almost permanently served as merchan- dise on the ideological market, so that people with different interests produced different representations of them. 1 L'Hermitte 1987 (1): 13, note 3: ^Following a classic method, Braun and Marr will cite each other for a while, which purports to produce the false impression of an international audience for Japhetidoloev." 2 Cf.

For the reality see Eijgenraam's [1991] account of the Buck incident. The behaviour of the Eindhoven chemistry professor H.M.

Even when Marr was alive, his followers produced schisms1 and disputed each other's representations of his theo- ries.2 For the sake of brevity, only a general and schematic impression of the teachings of Marr and his pupils will be given here. It will be fairly easy to find data on or from Marr which patently or apparently contradict the ones which are ascribed to him be- low. Marr, who was born in Georgia between 1863 and 1865,3 into a Scottish-Georgian family, started out as a bourgeois archaeologist, anthropologist, philologist and com- parative linguist. He was a specialist in the languages and cultures of the Caucasus. He became widely respected for his philological work on Georgian and some other languages, but his linguistic work was held in lesser esteem. In the early 1890s, Marr's foremost French colleague A. Meillet was already troubled by his disquieting {inquiétant) etymologies:4 ^freakish outbursts without any linguistics in it".5 Although Mixankova's hagiography describes Marr as one of the few intellectuals of the old stamp immediately to espouse the October Revolution,6 he would not enter the Party until 1930.7 In 1920, Marr presented the first official version of his sweeping new Japhetic hy- pothesis.0 It was an extension of existing linguistic, historical and ethnographic con- ceptions. Marr postulated that, before the arrival of the Indo-European population of the regions bordering the Mediterranean, the area was inhabited by a more ancient Japhetic people, whose language was ancestor to all non-Indo-European and non- Semitic languages, including Basque, the Caucasian languages, such as Georgian, and of a series of dead languages. The Japhetic hypothesis also had to account for all un- explained "residual" elements in Indo-European languages, at first those in the Caucasus, such as Armenian, later those in the other languages of Europe as well. Marr's problem lay in finding an empirical foundation for the hypothesis. There are certain similarities between Georgian and Basque. Both languages are said to be ergative: their system of assigning cases to the subject and object of a verb deviates from that of the nominative Indo-European languages.9 But such typological blacks do not necessarily make a white. 1 Cf. Marr 192671933b: 1. 2 Aptekar"s 1933 collection, which contains 764 selected fragments from Marr's work and comprises 560 pages, is severely criticized in MeSõaninov 1934a for being the wrong compilation. 3 See Mixankova 1949s (1): 7 for the various contradictory sources on Marr's birth date. 4 Cf.

In 1912 the term Japhetic had been removed from the title of one of his papers at the insistence of his editor [Mixankova 1949s (4): 200]. But after the revolution the time was ripe. 9 In nominative languages the case which is generally used to mark the complement of an intransitive verb usually coincides with the one marking the valency for the most active role with transitive verbs. In</page><page sequence="41">THE CONTEXT 19 It is interesting to see how Marr's failure to find convincing empirical support for the hypothesis produced a modification of the criteria of what constitutes empirical support. The Japhetic hypothesis first turned into the Japhetic theory, and then into the discipline of Japhetidology. The revolutionary hypothesis was replaced by a revo- lutionary paradigm, which warranted retention of sweeping status. In traditional comparative linguistics, the plausibility of hypotheses of kinship was assessed by means of the family tree metaphor and regularity of linguistic change in terms of the family tree. If such regularities could be observed, relationships between languages were deemed established through the assumption of a common ancestral or profo-language, to which individual languages could be related in terms of systematic correspondences, mostly stated in phonetic terms. Exceptions were tolerated when a feasible explanation could be posited. The family tree method could not help Marr. He therefore rejected the tree metaphor as an assessment criterion, and posited a pro- cess of language crossing (skreSõenie) instead: languages were assumed to merge and mix. This reversed the tree metaphor: languages could now descend from two or more other languages.1 Marr's ideas were not unique. Prominent linguists such as Schuchardt rejected the family tree model and posited mixture as the principal driving force of the develop- ment of languages.2 At present it is generally acknowledged that the traditional family tree metaphor has its limitations. The family tree presupposes a historical model in which tribes migrate from one place to another, become isolated from their original contacts, and develop their language independently. The laboratory situation for such developments is sometimes said to be found in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean, where people are assumed to have migrated from one, previously uninhabited, island to another, and languages are traced back, by means of a straightforward tree structure, to a single proto-language.3 Where migrating groups arrive in an area which is already populated, the tree model presupposes that the original population is subjugated and its language is eclipsed, with the exception of a few loanwords for lo- cal commodities, such as fruits, animals and bathtubs, and possibly some "substrate" phonological and grammatical features. The tree model is unsuitable for dialectologi- ergative languages the case which is generally used to mark the complement of an intransitive verb usually coincides with the one marking a valency for another role with transitive verbs [Bußmann 19902 (Ergativsprache): 220]. Georgian is only partly ergative: see § 4.5.20. 1 The image used to illustrate the reversal is a pyramid: cf. Marr 1925/ 1933b: 213-214. 2 Cf., e.g., Schuchardt 1884/1971: 25(3)ff., especially 28(6). Schuchardt was regularly mentioned in connec- tion with Marr during the 1970s, when the latter had to be made respectable (e.g. in BSE 15 19743 (Marr): 406). According to Gerhardt 1971: 7, a Russian collection of Schuchardt's papers was published in 1950. 3 In Krupa 1975: 12, Polynesia is characterized as a linguistic laboratory. (The passage is omitted in the English translation 1982 (1): 4.) Note that, even in the case of island hopping, the pure tree model is not necessarily found. It requires naval skills to sail long distances, and people who possess such skills are not the ones to settle on a new island after a first trip: they will continue to exploit them for economic pur- poses. This may produce long periods of traffic between settlements, mixed populations, sociolinguistic stratification and lexical borrowing. Consider the case of Madagascar. Its major language, Malagasy, results from a rather spectacular migration from the Indonesian archipelago. Malagasy is most closely related to the South-East Barito languages, which are spoken in interior South Borneo. As documented in Adelaar 1989, it underwent Malay influence both before and after the transfer to Madagascar. As Adelaar [1991 (6): 18-20] suggests, the first settlers probably included a majority of South Barito speakers who did not migrate on their own accord but were transported there by Malay sailors.</page><page sequence="42">20 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER cal research, and has therefore been suppleted with the wave model, ruling the geo- graphical or social dispersion of regular changes within a language, such as the spread of Umlaut in continental Germanic. Later, the area or Sprachbund model was developed to cover parallel phenomena in adjacent languages, such as the numerous shared features (e.g. postclitic articles) of genetically non-related languages in the Balkan peninsula. Phenomena of the latter type are prominent in Marr's Caucasus, which contains a host of non-related or distantly related languages. In extreme situa- tions of social disintegration, such as the slave trade, the portion of facts which can be accounted for in traditional genealogical terms is much smaller than in the case of classic migrations. Such situations entail a massive need for ad hoc communication between people with little or no previous shared linguistic experience: when these attempts are codified, they produce pidgin languages. When new social structures emerge from the ad hoc situation, such pidgins turn into creóles. Such developments resemble what Marr would call crossing. Modern sociolinguists consider the social disintegration model, not the classic migration model, to represent the minimal hy- pothesis, the default explanation, of linguistic change. Hudson considers that, in prin- ciple, there are no varieties which can be transferred from one set of speech habits to another, only items.1 As Le Page has it, "every speech act is [...] the reflex of an "instant pidgin"":2 its chances of turning into an instance of full-blown communication vary according to the situation and the shared experience (or, in Le Page's frame- work, competence) of speaker and hearer, which itself can be predicted by the prop- erties of the setting of the speech act, as analysed in sociological categories.3 This does not, of course, detract from the legitimacy of deducing, from linguistic data, important generalizations on wholesale transfer of items: whenever such gen- eralizations can be captured in family trees, the specific shapes of such trees en- hance the plausibility of historic migrations. The tree model presupposes a massive one-way transfer of items, which may be associated with power differences between the participants in speech situations. Rejection of the family tree as the basic model for describing the linguistic history of the Old World therefore entails a revolutionary view on the history of its societies. This is what Marr may have had in mind when positing his crossing process, which excludes great tribal migratory movements and presupposes instead the existence of local and regional networks that enable the gradual spread of individual items. This type of dispersion of linguistic phenomena is a reasonable model for certain periods and certain areas, such as the Caucasus. It essentially copies a common model for the spread of material culture, which explains its being proposed by a Caucasian archaeologist and anthropologist.4 It ignores an important difference between lan- guage and artefacts. The latter are relatively special experiences in a society: their 1 Hudson 1980 (2.3.1): 40; see also § 1.1.26. 2 Le Page 1977 (0): 222-223. 3 Marr had an instance of the minimal hypothesis of linguistic change right at hand: in his autobiography [Man 1927/1933: 61 he recalls how his Scottish father and Georgian mother, who did not share any lan- guages, developed their own crossing. (Marr's father died when Marr was eight years old.) Marr does not indicate how his father could function as the head of a Georgian agricultural school. 4 Marr's first and foremost pupil, I.I. Mescaninov, was also an archaeologist.</page><page sequence="43">THE CONTEXT 21 production is often assigned to craftsmen; the number of items with which users are confronted during their lifetime is small; and decisions to adopt new models may be motivated by explicit and rational considerations of their function. Linguistic items, on the other hand, circulate in enormous quantities among all members of a community, and are associated with experiences which can be interpreted in social terms, such as power, status and affection. As the choice between linguistic items is usually arbitrary from a functional viewpoint (there is no functional reason to call walking walking rather than spazieren), the psychological and social processes which determine the spread of linguistic items are different from those which determine the spread of ma- terial culture, even if the difference may be merely one of degree.1 When language is approached in terms of archaeological categories, the view that its use and develop- ment are determined by objective economic conditions is easily underpinned: this in- creases the appeal of Marr's approach for Marxists. Marr broadens the range of archaeological metaphors in his linguistics by assuming numerous layers in classifying the items of a language and in manipulating their relationships. Thomas observes that Marr never abandoned genetic relationships but only wanted to substitute different ones, which would satisfy the disadvantaged nations.2 Marr's followers, who were not interested in that particular goal, adduced additional arguments against the genealogical model as such, which were of a more ideological nature. In the nineteenth century another of Humboldt's views (or, at least, a view which can be traced back to Humboldt) had been popular: language and thought not only determined each other; language also determined nations, as sets of people thinking in the same categories.3 In the nineteenth century, the nation concept had not only been adopted as a basic tool for ordering European societies, but was also imposed on their histories: every European nation annexed its own past. In these cir- cumstances, the combination of the family tree approach and the equation of language and nation added a new dimension to both elements: nations could be brothers or sis- ters. It must have been easy to convince Marxists of the 1920s, who wanted to do away with nations and nationalism, that the genealogical approach to linguistic change was essentially racist in attributing an aggressive tribal migration pattern to prehistoric classless society and deriving from it a ranking order for modern nations. In the later debates, Marr's "profound antiracism" was frequently adduced by former Marrists.4 The use of the term ancestral language {prajazyk, Ursprache), which is a corollary of the family tree model, would become a red rag for Marrist fanatics. 1 Adelaar [ny (1): 6] points to an apparent considerable discrepancy between linguistic evidence and material anthropological evidence on the origins of the population of Madagascar whereas the material anthropolog- ical evidence indicates a diversity of sources in the Indonesian archipelago, linguistic evidence points to a specific area in South-East Borneo. Such discrepancies can only be explained by assuming different mech- anisms for the spread of linguistic and material items. Renfrew's popular 1987 theory on the origin and spread of Indo-European in terms of material culture can be characterized as a revival of Marr's ideas on language crossing. 2 Thomas 1957 (7): 142-143. 3 See, for example, Humboldt (ny)/1979: 68ff. Humboldt's formulations are rather subtle, but what counts here is the popular version of his ideas, not his own contentions. 4 Cf., for example, Abaev 1969: 85, Abaev 1965: 22. In early 20th century Europe, separation of linguistic and racial theories was not self-evident. As late as the 1930s Van Ginnekea who can by no means be as- sociated with the theories of the Nazis, considered phonetic change to be conditioned by a racially deter-</page><page sequence="44">22 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER After doing away with the family tree and sound laws, new plausibility criteria had to be substituted. When individual items were assumed to develop and travel to and fro between languages, no great discoveries could be made: without ancestral lan- guages, it was hardly meaningful to posit a Japhetic language somewhere in the mid- dle of a history of arbitrary mutations. Marr acknowledged this: in the foreword to his brand-new institute's first collec- tion of papers of, all but one written by Marr himself,1 he characterized his enterprise as embarkation on a poorly equipped ship for a voyage on a boundless ocean, without havens on the other shore. The other shore did not even exist: it would only serve to rest, and there would be no rest for those scientists who had abandoned the safe frameworks set by tradition. The voyage was to be lonely but fruitful.2 The theoretical claims appeared gradually, in the course of the twenties. Marr's basic tenet made Marrism a derivative of Marxism: a language was considered a product of its society and belonged to the superstructure, like other artefacts. Lin- guistic change was determined, through the relation between language and thought, by the economic base of the society of the respective speakers: rThe Japhetic theory teaches us that language, phonic language, in whatever stage of its development, is by no means a simple gift of nature. Phonic language is a creation of man. Mankind created its lan- guage in the labour process, in specific societal conditions, and re-creates it when genuinely new social forms of life and existence arise, in accordance with the new way of thinking brought about by these conditions. It follows that natural languages do not exist: all languages are artificial.3 Such views are not unique for the period. The German Marxist Kautsky, for example, considered language to be conditioned by societal circumstances to the extent that each set of conditions determined its language: similarities between languages were explained by similar conditions.4 As pointed out above, the claim that societal condi- tions determine linguistic change was, in different terms, shared by other Soviet lin- guists, such as Polivanov, and is in fact endorsed by modern sociolinguists: specific socio-economic structures are required for a creole to develop. But the Marxist con- ception of history was teleological: the economic base of a society did not evolve in arbitrary directions, but according to a specific pattern, which began with primitive communal society and ended with communism. If language is tied to economic struc- ture, history not only conditions changes in language, but also determines specific changes. This implies that specific stages of society must universally produce specific mined physionomical articulation base-, he collected numerous parallel phonetic developments in Slavic languages and Dutch dialects, such as the change from [g] into [fi] which took place in Czech, Slovak, Belorussian and Ukrainian, as well as in West Flanders and the adjacent Dutch province of Zeeland, and explained them as conditioned by the articulation base of the majority of the population of West Flanders and Zeeland, a relic of the postulated earlier presence of Slav tribes in these areas: cf. Van Ginneken 1935, passim. As an additional argument, Van Ginneken [1935 (3.8.96): 178, 180-181] adduced the "coincidence" of the words for 'leg' and 'foot' in certain Dutch dialects, in the Slavic languages, and in a "bridge" of German dialects in between, without explaining how he thought that this semantic parallel could support a physiological hypothesis. Typically, Van Ginneken subsequently got his teeth into Caucasian languages: cf. Van Ginneken 1938. 1 Marr 1922a. The one remaining paper was written by I.I. MeScaninov. 2 Marr 1922b: i. 3 Marr 1974 {3&gt;. 88. 4 Kautsky 19292a (2.3.5): 273-274.</page><page sequence="45">THE CONTEXT 23 linguistic phenomena: social history then provides a parameter for linguistic typology. In the later debates, attention would be focused on Marrist efforts to establish lin- guistic universais, long before they became fashionable in the west.1 Marr's problem then was which phenomena were to be related to the various his- torical stages of society. The remote classless stages of society were simple to char- acterize. On the early end of the historical spectrum, language was assumed to have originated relatively late, in primitive society, along with the first technical develop- ments and forms of social organization, when it succeeded sign language (ruõnoj jazyk, 'manual language1).2 rThe roots of our inherited speech are not in external na- ture, nor in ourselves, in our physical nature, but in society, in its material basis, in economics and technology."3 Man* postulated a unitary glottogonie process of the origin of language, which became one of his favourite research themes. On the other end of the historical spectrum, during communism, only one language, an artificial one, would be left, rid of "polysemantism" and rich in differentiated means of expression, which was the result of gradual convergence, through purposive crossing, of the languages of the world. rIt is obvious that the future global unitary language will be a language of a new system, which has not existed before, like the future economy with its technology, classless society and classless culture.4 The idea of a language merger was a corollary of the teleological view of society and the dependence of language on societal conditions: in converging conditions, lan- guages had to converge as well. This idea, too, is found in Kautsky's work.5 Of course, Marr and his associates did not refer to Kautsky, whom V.l. Lenin branded a rene- gade.6 Marr's idea of a future world language was also related to Kautsky's views.7 Marr's future unitary language would not be one of the present world's major languages, which could only be carriers of bourgeois culture.8 On the other hand, fin constructing the future language, no single national language, no tribal language, however desolate it may seem, may be overlooked, because even the most isolated and lonely languages contain ex- 1 Cf.

In Kacnel'son 1940 (4): 78, the stage-determined development of thought was linked with seventeenth-century "universal philosophical grammar", as embodied in the 1660 Port-Royal Grammar. 2 The assumption that sign language preceded oral language is not uncommon in the period. Recent Soviet sources, constructing a presentable image of Marr, regularly refer to Levy-Bruhl [e.g. 195 19 (2.4.4.): 175- 187] as one of his influences. Among non-Soviet Marxists, Kautsky [19292a (3.1.7): 522-5231, himself influenced by Levy-Bruhl, attributed the loss of sign language to the development of social organizatioa While primitive man was busy individuating sensory experiences in his immediate enviroment, which necessitated a direct link between action and thought, the technology of modern man requires means to classify his environment, i.e. to abstract from individual properties. The abstract, non-iconic properties of phonic language were considered more suitable for this purpose. 3 Marr 1974 {3&gt;. 89. 4 Marr 1974 (3): 89. 5 Cf. Kautsky 19292a (2.3.5): 274. ° But Danilov, shortly before developing into a major opponent of Marr, pointed to similarities between Marr's and Kautsky's ideas: cf. Danilov 1929 {4}. 51. The Marrist Filia on the other hand, detected Kauts- kian ideas in the views of Danilov and the Indo-Europeanists: cf.

Like the transitions of society itself, linguistic change was considered to be subject to saltatory mutations from one stage of language to another. The stages and the transitions between them were ruled by the theory of development by stages {stadial'noe razvitie; stadijnoe razvitie). Socio-economic circumstances conditioned the relation between language and thought. Thus, Humboldt's network of conditioning relations between society, thought, and language was essentially maintained, except that society was not interpreted in terms of nationality but in terms of class. Combining K. Marx's thesis that societal conditions determined human consciousness, i.e. one's economic position determined his thought,2 and the Humboldtian assumption that there was a determining relationship between thought and language could not fail to produce a deterministic Marxist theory for both diachronic and synchronie linguistics. Now, whether the economic conditions determined thought through language, or language through thought, the focus of lin- guistic change was semantics. Therefore Marrism was essentially a theory of the se- mantic mutations in human language, both in the past and in the future.3 The next problem was how to assess semantic mutations: any changes or crossings had to be calibrated in terms of something which remained constant. There were two options here: measuring semantic changes against constant (phonetic or phonological) form, or measuring them against constant reference. 1 Semantic shifts as measured against formal constancy can be illustrated by the re- lation between Russian skót Clive-stock') and Gothic skatts ('denarius') or Dutch schat ('treasure'), or that between Latin pecus ('live-stock'), Dutch vee ('live-stock'), English fee and Latin pecunia ('money'): these parallel relations could be viewed as being conditioned by the transition from one economic system to another.4 iMarr 1974 (5k 91-92. 2Bogdanov 1924:210. 3 At an earlier stage, Marr suggested relating the morphological typology of languages to stages in the de- velopment of language and society. Each societal stage would determine a morphological type [cf. Kuz- necov, P.S., I9602: 41i 1 primitive communal society produces isolating or amorphic languages, i.e. languages without mor- phology (see §3.1.6), such as Chinese; 2 the original division of labour would produce agglutinating languages, i.e. languages, such as Japanese, where words could contain numerous grammatical suffixes and prefixes, each corresponding to a sepa- rate meaning; 3 finally, class society produced inflecting languages, such as Latin or Russian, where grammatical mor- phemes were allowed to contain several meanings each. As P.S. Kuznecov remarked, this would produce empirical problems: English, having lost most of its flex- ion, would be an instance of the next stage following class society, or an instance of a relapse to the earlier stage of classless society, or would have to be denied the status of a legitimate continuation of inflected Old English. In the 1940s, any morphological classification of languages which put English at the end of the line was branded un-Marrist, formalist and reactionary (see §0.1 1). 4 The examples which have been selected to illustrate Marr's etymologies are plausible. The relation be- tween pecus and pecunia was studied by Benveniste in his reconstruction of Indo-European institutions [Benveniste 1969 (1.1.4): 47-611.</page><page sequence="47">THE CONTEXT 25 2 Semantic shifts as measured against referential constancy can be illustrated by the relation between French (0/6/1) below and Latin (0/6/2). (0/6/1) J'ai un livre. 'I have a book' (0/6/2) Mihi est liber. 'to me is a book', i.e. 'I have a book' An identical state of affairs in reality finds its default expression in terms of pos- session in French but in terms of belonging in Latin: in Marrist linguistics such dif- ferences could be viewed as reflecting diverging property relationships for the re- spective societies. Marr acknowledged both the formal and referential bases for his comparisons. The ergative construction, for example, enabled him to accommodate his pet, Japhetic, languages, in a separate basket from the Indo-European languages, which used active and passive constructions to represent the same relationships. The Japhetic group, which started to comprise more and more languages,1 now reflected the prehistoric stage of society, assumed to originate somewhere in the Mediterranean area.2 Every- thing fell into place here. The crossing theory applied a fortiori to the languages of the primitive classless stage: it was only natural that their cognateness could not be assessed in terms of racist family trees of travelling Indo-European tribes who lin- guistically subjugated the local population, producing class societies in the process, or whose language ^typologically represents the creation of new economic-societal conditions".3 It does not really seem to matter to Marr whether languages of the Indo- European "system" had been introduced by invasions which brought about new socio- economic conditions,4 which was his earlier idea, or had been produced, as a mutation of Japhetic, by a change in socio-economic conditions, which was the later, Marxist, version of Marrism.5 In the latter, the theory of stages purported to explain what the crossing theory purported to demonstrate. In view of Marr's comparatisi past, it is to be expected that he would devote a great deal of energy to comparison of semantic values on a formal basis. The assump- tion of a separate history for each item in terms of sound changes and geographical diffusion, and a thorough contempt for the problem of what constituted constancy of phonic form or reference (i.e. the question of why we are justified in relating skót and schat), enabled the wild etymologies of Marr's palaeontology which became his trade- mark. Marr eventually arrived at the palaeontological theory for which his adversaries would make him famous. All words in all languages were analyzed in terms of combi- nations and mutations of four primary roots, which were specified as sal her, yon, roS,6 but were sometimes referred to as A, B, C and D.7 The interpretation of these 1 The title of Marr 1927, ^Hottentots are Mediterraneans", speaks for itself. 2 The idea that ergative languages represent an older, more original type of language is not restricted to Marrism. A modern specimen of this conception is Wagner 1978. 3 Marr 192471933b: 185. 4 In several places Marr regarded societies with class stratification as resulting from tribe mixture cf.

Originally, Marr identified the four elements with the self -designations of four Japhetic tribes.1 Later he added to the content of an element a totemic signifi- cance: the elements became primal screams which arise during the "labour-magic [trud-magiõeskijY process,2 by accompanying different components of the labour pro- cess and magic action which characterize any group of humans.3 MeSõaninov, in his 1950 defense of Marrism, pointed out that "[i]n his last works Marr suggested a new explanation of linguistic elementas,] pointing to [fthe] inseparable connection between Ptheir] formal and [ftheir] ideological aspect."4 But MeSõaninov admitted that the con- cept had remained "inexact". In MeSoaninov's 1929 popular survey of Japhetidology, Marr's four primitive elements t"were everywhere and served to designate any con- cept, i.e. they were asemantic".5 Kuipers notes that Marr's assumption of a small num- ber of primitive elements was possibly motivated by the fact that certain Caucasian languages, such as Circassian, actually contain extremely small numbers of unanalys- able morphemes.6 It is this theory that Marr presented to the research community in the 1920s, and the one that was to eclipse competing traditions claiming the title of true Marxist fun- damentalism as well as Indo-Europeanism and any bridgeheads of Saussurean linguis- tics. In the late twenties a new Methodological Bureau was attached to Marr's insti- tute, staffed by S.N. Bykovskij and V.B. Aptekar1,7 whom Polivanov qualified as "lan- guage-less linguists".8 Bykovskij and Aptekar' prepared the first series of linguistic debates, which were characterized by extreme virulence on the part of the Marrists, with sharp assaults and accusations, directed at three targets: 1 leading traditional linguists; 2 Polivanov; 3 a group of young Marxist linguists called Jazykfront? The sins of traditional linguistics in the eyes of the Marrists do not require further explanation. Indo-Europeanists were accused of bourgeois idealism or worse. Information on the discussion with Polivanov can be found in several sources.10 Polivanov was opposed, for example, to the theory of stages. He regarded linguistics at least partly as a physical science, the pre-revolutionary results of which remained valid for Marxists and should serve as a starting point for a real sociological linguis- tics. Although Polivanov acknowledged that economic circumstances condition lin- guistic change, and demonstrated this on the basis of changes in the lexicon and in word formation which had occurred as a result of the revolution, he rejected the Marrists' thesis that economic conditions determine specific phonological and 1 MeSõaninov 1934b 12; MeSõaninov 1951: 26. 2 Cf.

As in the natural sciences, Polivanov pointed out, there are linguistic laws which are valid regardless of time and space, and can be formulated without reference to socio-economic or political factors: Exclusively linguistic conditions which apply to Russian in its present state predetermine, for exam- ple, a transition of the sound [&lt;J,1, [... i.e. djas in djádja, 'uncle'] into (jl to demand that some socio-eco- nomic factor would produce, say, &lt;/-► k or 4~+ b instead of 4"* j&gt; is entirely equivalent to the assump- tion that some socio-economic upheaval, say a revolution, would suddenly make the pistons of a steam engine run perpendicularly to the direction of the rails instead of parallel to them We do not at all need such assumptions to assess the impact of the revolution on the transport system: similarly, it is not at all necessary to abolish physical-historical theories of linguistic evolution in order to assert the depen- dence of this evolution on socio-economic factors.1 The comparison was immediately attacked by Sor, a Marxist linguist who had done some interesting work on the relation between language and society,2 and was an early discoverer of F. de Saussure. She pointed to the circumstance that steam en- gines are physical objects. Adducing Saussure and Sapir, she argued that the physical, i.e. acoustic and physiological, manifestations of language are not themselves linguis- tic facts.3 Language is behaviour and cannot, as such, be subjected to laws of nature, valid regardless of time and place.4 According to Sor, Polivanov's prediction that kJJ would change into [jl turned him into an ultra-orthodox neo-grammarian, believing in the reality of operational fictions the conventional status of which the neo-grammar- ians themselves had acknowledged decades ago.5 The status of phonetic laws was such that it was impossible to make any predictions. Sor proposed to abandon the nebulous world of constructed forms, whether past or future, and called for a return to the fresh air of tangible present-day reality.6 This is the only matter-of-fact criticism Polivanov was ever subjected to.7 All other criticism was uttered in an administrative setting. In 1929 Polivanov was expelled from RANION, which was about to merge with the Academy of Sciences. RANION's president, the theorist of literature V.M. Friõe (1870-1929), presided over a discussion on Marr's teachings, which lasted several days. He immediately set the tone, con- cluding his opening address with the observation that rthe Japhetic theory is being transformed before our very eyes, and is being reincarnated as Marxist, dialectical- materialist linguistics".8 In his reply Polivanov, while recognizing certain merits of Japhetidology, rejected the equals sign between it and Marxism, and gave an exposi- tion of his own view of Marxist linguistics. Among the seventeen speakers on a pre- established list, only one supported Polivanov. After the session, the latter was at- tacked in the press. His biography was falsified and he was branded a reactionary.9 1 Polivanov 1928: 174-175; cf. Brüche-Schulz 1984 (3.1.2): 88-89. 2 Cf.

Polivanov did not immediately give up. In 1931, his col- lection entitled ^For Marxist Linguistics was published.2 But he was soon forced to take up residence in Central Asia, where he was denied publication facilities. Polivanov was finally arrested in 1937, and completely disappeared the following year. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1963. Many of his extant works were published only in the 1960s.3 Less is known about Jazykfront. Thus far Bruche-Schulz 1984 is the only western source which actually describes its positions and has assembled what little is known of its struggle with the New Teaching on Language.4 Jazykfront united young Marxist linguists who, on the face of it, were not affected by pre-revolutionary bourgeois idealism. They shared the Marrist conviction that language belongs to the superstructure5 and that class determines language; like the Marrists, they regarded Indo-European linguistics as an old foe of Marxism6 and classified Polivanov as a vulgar and eclectic materialist.7 But their conclusions were different. The Jazykfrontists adopted Sor's programme cited above: they felt that lin- guistics had to deal with tangible present-day reality.8 In the conception of Jazyk- front, linguistic research ought to be action-oriented: it should concentrate on the relation between language, class and proletarian consciousness in contemporary post-revolutionary society and convert the acquired knowledge into actions contri- buting to the construction of socialist society. Japhetidology, in its dealings with a distant past and a no less distant future,9 was viewed as apolitical science, as an at- tempt to shirk the tasks of the present.10 rWho studies the Russian language of the Soviet era as the language of the October Revolution? Everyone, down to the white émigrés, only not the Japhetidologists."11 The rnebulous, ahistorical and undialectical representation of the class nature of language"12 by the Marrists was considered to avoid the reflection of class struggle. Moreover, Jazykfront was not convinced of the validity of Marr's palaeontology and his theory of stages: 1 E.g. Leont'ev &amp; al. 1974: 24-27, Genty 1977, L'Hermitte 1987 (1): 22-36. 2 Part of the contents of Polivanov 1931 is reprinted in Polivanov 1968 and its English translation Poli- vanov 1974b. 3 Cf. the collection of his papers Polivanov 1968, Polivanov 1974b. 4 Bruche-Schulz 1984 (3.2.2-3.2.2.2): 104-118.

Marr's Indo-European stage, for example, comprises all of the history of the language of European humanity, regardless of the fact that it has passed through a series of revolutions and changes of societal formations. * Yet initially Jazykfront credited Marr with having developed ra tool for the revolu- tionary transformation of the science of language"2 and did not fully reject him. The gesture was not accepted. As Jazykfrontists observed the following year, the Marrists had received instructions to attack the Jazykfront ^"rabble (sbrodi"" in rtheir characteristic, elegant style".3 Marr's methodological vanguard was reinforced by F.P. Filin, who was in his early twenties at the time and could not be qualified as language-less: he was to grow into a specialist of Russian, Belorussian, and Ukrainian. Filin contributed three papers4 to the anti- Jazykfront collection t Against Bourgeois Contraband in Linguistics,5 in which Jazykfront was condemned for its ignorance of the connection between language and thought and for its neglect of the historical di- mension of the relationship between language and society. As Filin pointed out, by starting out with a description of linguistic data Jazykfront could only produce a fragmentary" conception of language.6 Jazykfrontists were said to deal with the sounds of language instead of language itself,7 and with the look of history instead of history itself.8 This "fundamentally fragmentary" empiricism became the central charge against Jazykfront. One could not simply concoct rmassive enthusiasm of so- cialist labour and individual instances of self-interest" and start classification by arbi- trarily chosen properties: Empiricism always perverts reality and leads to political errors. Neither a "majority vote" nor resorting to "mass" observation presents a way out. As the founders of Marxism demonstrated long ago, empiri- cists forever remain fettered by the vilest, most reactionary tendencies of idealist philosophy.9 Since the young linguists of Jazykfront had had little opportunity to do any serious work so far, their empiricism was mainly programmatic. Jakubinskij's accusations could only be corroborated by the examination of the empirical work of Danilov, Jazykfront's main representative. Danilov was convinced that dialectology, being geographically oriented, could not justify the enormous linguistic diversity which exists locally between classes.10 He had conducted a "mass survey"11 among inhabitants of the village of Beliki, in Eastern Ukraine, in order to assess covariance of linguistic and social characteristics. Both time and place must have been of linguistic interest: 1 Danilov 1931a: 24. The Marxist term formation denotes a historically determined stage in the develop- ment of society, characterized by a specific production structure, which determines specific social and polit- ical conditions, institutions and an ideology. 2 Danilov 1930 (4): 78. 3 Belevickij 1931: 12. 4 Filin 1932a, 1932b, 1932c. 5 Bykovskil 1932. 6 Filin 1932a: 37; cf.

At the time, Jakubinskij was in his Marrist period: his development as a linguist is described in Bruche-Schulz 1984 (3.1.3): 90-97. 10 Danilov 1928: 193. 11 Danilov 1928: 165.</page><page sequence="52">30 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER - far-reaching economic and cultural changes were taking place; - Russian and Ukrainian were competing in a daily-life setting; - an old Polish layer, a recently developed Ukrainian standard, and a prestigious Soviet Russian layer were competing to supply technical and abstract vocabulary. Danilov's methods, which included eliciting unmonitored speech from representatives of different social groups, resemble those of modern sociolinguistics, although the sample for his "mass survey" was small: only 25 subjects were systematically observed. They represented various classes and social groups. The following categories are worth noticing: - Farm-hands, poor peasants, unskilled and skilled workers. (Danilov identified these subjects by their names.) - Kulaks, i.e. members of the rural bourgeoisie, who systematically used hired labour and were to be "liquidated as a class"1 during the collectivization of Soviet agricul- ture in the early 1930s. (Danilov identified these subjects by their initials.) - A petty trader and a merchant (whom Danilov identified by the Latin characters N and JVM - Intellectuals from the local aktiv, the Party organization, which, for lack of Party members, included non-Party people and even the son of a kulak (the one intellec- tual who was referred to by his initials). The speech of members of the various categories was measured along several pa- rameters, including: - richness of vocabulary and syntactic constructions; - use of Ukrainian archaisms, Russisms, Sovietisms, barbarisms or internationalisms (or foreignisms: etran¿izm' - various phonetic features; - articulatory features, such as speed and loudness of conversation. In his results, Danilov recorded a rich syntax and vocabulary, Russisms and foreign words, and articulate speech, for the local aktiv. He accounted for this by their re- sponsible function in the new society.2 The same qualifications applied to the speech of the hero of the survey: the only skilled worker in the sample, a turner. Danilov explained this by the complex and multifaceted work in the modern factory; the worker's use of Russian in work situa- tions also showed that October Russian is the common language of the workers.3 All workers used the Russian word krásnyj for 'red', instead of the Ukrainian õervónyj, r which reflects the worker's class psycho-ideology, his need for a unified political language".4 Both the skilled worker and the aktiv people employed Ukrainian archaisms in or- der to keep in touch with the masses, viz. the poor peasants, r"with their unenlightened class consciousness",5 and the unskilled workers.6 Young skilled workers used 1 This is the standard description found in most Soviet sources, e.g. SES 1980 (kulaöestvo): 675-676. 2 Danilov 1928: 191. 3 Danilov 1928: 178. 4 Danilov 1928: 179. 5 Danilov 1928: 170. b Danilov 1928: 178, 191.</page><page sequence="53">THE CONTEXT 3 1 vagabond language and thieves1 cant on the streets but, while grown-up skilled work- ers ceased to do so, such linguistic elements were considered unalienable parts of the speech of unskilled workers, in accordance with their uncertain existence, which caused them to be imbued with elements of vagabond "psycho-ideology".1 The members of the aktiv spoke resolutely and firmly, T"as befits a commander of the masses", except the son of a poor peasant, who still suffered from a "pre-revolu- tionary psychology", and the poor son of a kulak, rwho does not dare to speak in a loud voice so as to avoid frightening away the ones he wants to deceive".2 But the rich vocabulary and syntax, loud and articulated speech, etc., of the party workers and the turner were also observed in the speech of the kulaks and merchants in the sample. Technical circumstances (complex work and travelling) only partly ac- counted for this. Here Danilov resorted to various specific explanations. A kulak needed to know the Sovietisms of his class enemy.3 The merchant NN used Ukrainian archaisms in or- der to exert his influence on the masses, but spoke loudly and used a rich Russian and foreign vocabulary in order to emphasize his superiority over them.4 Danilov's conclusions confirmed Jakubinskij's thesis that empirical observation is conducive to political errors. They provided sufficient ammunition for Film's struggle against danilovSdina, or even jazykfrontovSdinaß As Filin pointed out, Danilov's lin- guistic evidence projected a gulf between the workers and the party by ascribing a separate form of speech to qualified party officials, and by depicting party intelli- gencija as an isolated middle class. In Danilov's work on lexicology and style even Lenin turned out to belong to this class.6 Danilov was accused of unscrupulous slander and of importing Trotskyite contraband.7 According to Filin, the lessons of debortnSõina in philosophy, of rubinSõina in polit- ical economy, of pereverzevãõina in literature,8 showed that class struggle in science was growing acute as the remainders of capitalism prepared for the decisive battle. Proletarian public opinion had to be mobilized so as to put an end to all runfounded "academicism"" in Soviet science, which was disguised, not only with Marxistoid (marksistkoobraznyj) phrases but sometimes even with Party cards.9 Jazykfront was not just crypto-Indo-Europeanism but r"the banner of camouflaged reaction in 1 Danilov 1928: 179. 2 Danilov 1928: 192. 3 Danilov 1928: 170. 4 Danilov 1928: 184. 5 Filin 1932a: 44, 46.

By decree of the Ministry of Education {Narkompros) l.' the [Moscow-based] Institute of Linguistic Research [NUaz: Nauöno- isshdovatel'skij institut jazykoznanija), the strong point of Jazykfront, has even been turned into the "methodological centre" of all linguistic work "on Russian {RSFSR) territory" [...]. The "Jazykfrontists" have quickly started to seize chairs in the institutes of higher education (VU2), research institutes, jour- nals {Russkij jazyk virtually finds itself under their "methodological guidance"), and even publishing houses [..]?■ Aptekar' &amp; Bykovskij, from the Marrists1 methodological centre, therefore proposed to the Central Committee the immediate liquidation of Jazykfront.3 Jazykfront vanished in 1932: after that year no trace was found of the Linguistic Research Institute or its individual staff members.4 The last public sign of resistance against Marrism was P.S. Kuznecov's 1932 critical appraisal of the Japhetic theory, written for the Linguistic Research Institute.5 P.S. Kuznecov, whose relationship with Jazykfront is unclear to the present writer, would turn up in the linguistic discussions of the forties and fifties. In the sixties he was to contribute to the research of the Set- theoretical School, the subject of the present study. In 1932, Marr's Academy Institute of Japhetic Studies was reorganized to become the Institute of Language and Thought, which emphasized the universalist claim of the Marrists.6 A branch institute in Moscow would be established later. In the same pe- riod, the terms Japhetic Theory, Japhetidologyt etc., were definitively abandoned in favour of New Teaching on Language.7 It is understandable that non-linguists, i.e. ideologists, bureaucrats and policy mak- ers were prepared to accept Marr's teaching. The part which was accessible to non- specialists assimilated the basic Marxist dogmas of historicity and determination: the basic conceptual framework of Marrism looked isomorphic to that of Marxism. The patently spurious consequences were only drawn in the technical, empirical part of the doctrine: it is quite possible that the ideologists allowed for the controversial sta- tus of, say, the four primary elements, but decided that such technicalities did not af- fect the heart of the principle and should be left to the internal discussions within the discipline itself. Polivanov's insistence that facts remain facts, even for Marxists,8 and that linguists should deduce Marxist theses from the facts instead of the other way 1 Filin 1932a: 46. 2 Filin 1932a: 33. 3 Aptekar' &amp; Bykovskij 1931: 43, 47, as quoted in Bruche-Schulz 1984 (3.2.2.1): 1 1 1. 4 With the exception of Ja.V.

Quite possibly, ideologists and policy makers were really interested in Marr's teaching and the differences between it and the teachings of Polivanov or Jazykfront. The policy makers were interested in edinonaõalie and Marr may simply have been the suitable person. Or the discussions may only have served as the legitimization of deals that had to be made when research organizations were merged. Consider the setting of the Polivanov session. Polivanov headed the linguistics section of RANI ON, while Marr's Institute of Japhetidology came under the Academy of Sciences. RANI ON was to merge with the Academy, and Academy institutes had to be led by Academy members. The number of chairs in the Academy of Sciences was doubled for the occasion,3 and the media had for a year been writing on the imminent elections of new Academicians. Research institutions and universities were to submit new candi- dates. As early as May 1928, the newspaper Izvestija started its regular reports on important nominations, such as M.N. Pokrovskij (1868-1932), president of the Commu- nist Academy, and Friöe, president of RANION.4 But the Academy of Sciences was not prepared to tolerate just any nomination and could still maintain a certain inde- pendence. In the first Izvestija article on the subject the physicist Ioffe,5 while con- ceding the inevitability of increasing the number of chairs (and of accepting the technical disciplines as full-fledged sciences), indicated the Academy's degrees of freedom and the way in which it intended to use them. rThe Academy, while growing in quantity, must not shrink in quality. [...] I think that one factor must be decisive: the new Academy members must be makers itvorec) of science. Among their merits neither great knowledge, nor pedagogical achievements, nor outstanding public service may tip the scale.6 The notorious 1929 Polivanov session was preceded by a session taking place in De- cember 1928, and ending in a deadlock between Marr and Polivanov.7 Both sessions were presided over by Friõe. In January 1929, Friõe was voted down by the Academy,8 in spite of all the publicity on his nomination by many Communist institu- tions.9 The session during which Polivanov was ousted, while the Japhetic theory was "being transformed before our very eyes, and [was] being reincarnated as Marxist, dialectical-materialist linguistics", took place in early February 1929. Then, during an extraordinary session later in February, the Academy reconsidered its decision and elected Friõe. At the ensuing public celebration the secretary of the Academy, Ol'denburg, delivered a speech pointing out that, as from now, there would be no "we 1 Cf.

As we saw, empiricism produced a fragmentary world outlook and blocks access to the mate- rialist essence of matter.

In 1899 he mobilized the Faculty of Eastern Languages of St. Petersburg University against the decision of Marr's supervisor, A.A. Cagareli, to re- ject Marr's dissertation.2 He took the initiative to appoint Marr as a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1909.3 As minister of education in the 1917 provisional gov- ernment, he gave Marr his Caucasian Historical-Archaeological Institute.4 Meáõani- nov later mentioned Ol'denburg as an extremely active participant "consultant" in the early work of the Institute of Japhetidology.5 It can hardly be expected that Ol'den- burg would fail to use his influence in 1929 as well. The phasing of the "Great Break" is relevant here. Only after carrying out the or- ganizational measures was ideological pressure stepped up and people's pasts dredged up.6 Ol'denburg lost his position later in 1929. It may be suggested that the Polivanov and Jazykf ront discussions were part of a survival strategy of the few older Marrists, for which the young Marxist fanatics, the Aptekar's and Filins, were used. Both Polivanov's linguistics department of RANI ON and the Linguistic Research Insti- tute of Jazykfront were communist institutions, while the Academy, with a majority of natural scientists, had had always striven to maintain an ideologically neutral position. The Marrists may have had to compensate for their lack of credentials. It would actually take decades to transform Marr's teaching into dialectical-mate- rialist linguistics. After the 1950 discussion, the opponents of the New Teaching on Language spelled out the patent flaws in Marr's Marxism which Jazykfront had ex- posed in vain in the early thirties. As a case in point, Marr considered a language to be tied to a class, which resulted, for example, in statements to the effect that lan- guages of the working classes of different societies show more similarity to each other than to the languages of the other classes of their own societies.7 Such class- bound languages were postulated for prehistory in Marr's theory of unitary glottoge- nesis: "oral" language was assumed to have originated, not too far from Georgia, as a prerogative of the class of priests or medicine men, which enabled them to gain the upper hand over the mute users of sign language. As Aptekar', Marr's leading methodologist, admitted, this conception was at variance with Marx's conception of classes and F. Engels' theory of their origin.8 Danilov, who branded Marr's conception as downright revisionist,9 pointed out that primitive society has been classless, classes arising only with massive division of labour.10 P.S. Kuznecov, in his 1932 1 Joravskv 1961 (4.16): 234. 2 Mixankova 1949s (3): 86-87.

Marr's supporters took up two defense lines here. Cemodanov [1951: 29] pointed out that Marr [1974 (46-51): 237] uses class in a technical non-Marxist sense, viz. as a synonym for the strata which are produced when tribes mix (and which yield class languages). But this did not improve Marr's</page><page sequence="57">THE CONTEXT 35 appraisal of Japhetidology, pointed to the fact that Aptekar' &amp; Bykovskij criticized the role that Marr attributed to magic in determining the origins of language.1 Marr died in 1934, and left two kinds of followers: the gorillas of the Methodologi- cal Bureau, and young researchers, who were motivated by various blends of ca- reerism, linguistic interest and revolutionary élan. A quotation from Abaev may give an impression of what it feels like to believe in revolutionary theories. rWe are not against the old istaryj) science, but against the senile istaroeskij) one. We are against culti- vation of petty hairsplitting ideas, against the foundation, around those ideas, of little schools and "trends" which nobody needs, against wearysome and tedious rumination of truths which have been chewed up long ago. We want ideas of wide-ranging enterprise and grand design, which correspond to the spirit of our era. The horizons which have opened before us are just too grand and captivating, and it is only natural that we should have a distaste for niggling and musty formalism.2 Stigmatization of "collectionism", i.e. the study of detail, and accusation of neglecting the important work on the grand design was a recurrent practice throughout the his- tory of Soviet linguistic discussion. The term formalism refers to the study of relations without presupposing an interpretation for these relations in reality. After the 1920s, formalism, like idealism, was used, as an antonym of materialism, to stigmatize deviat- ing trends in culture and science. The dominant programmaticism that is exemplified by the above quotation did not prevent some of Marr's Nachwuchs from developing eventually into internationally recognized specialists for specific languages. Abaev, whose native language is Osse- tian, an Iranian language in the Caucasus, was to become an acknowledged Iranist. Lacking linguistic erudition, Marr's young followers could live with the flaws in Marr's theorizing that cost Polivanov his life, and find creative solutions that leave the doctrine intact. Thus, Abaev casually solved empirical problems, such as the coexistence of different linguistic stages within the same society (e.g. ergative Georgian and nominative Armenian in the Soviet Union), by means of the distinction of two modes of existence of language: the ideological mode {jazyk kak ideologija) and the technical mode {jazyk kak texnika).3 The ideological mode was a Marxist continuation of Humboldt's internal form (innere Sprachform):4 language as a socially determined instrument for perceiving reality. This was the interesting mode, to which Marr's theories applied (the primary status of the ideological mode explains why medicine men were needed to create lan- guage: they derived from it the power to prescribe thought to the ordinary people). The technical mode, which was said to be implicit in Marr's writings, was produced by case why would a Marxist in a Marxist theory create confusion by such idiosyncratic usage? MeSöaninov [1951: 241, on the other hand, pointed out that Marr himself had already disavowed his "Baku Lectures" [1927/19361 to which his opponents referred. But this did not improve the case of his supporters, who had continued to reprint and prescribe the Baku lectures: printing non-canonical texts was not considered a virtue at the time. (Marr's Baku Lectures happen to be one of the two long Marr texts of which an integral translation (into German) is available cf. Marr 1974.) 1 Kuznecov, P.S., 1932 {5&gt;. 25: Aptekar1 &amp; Bykovskij 1931: 24-25. 2 Abaev 1936: 13. 3 Abaev 1934, Abaev 1936. 4 Humboldt (1830- 1835)/ 1979 (21): 463ff.

Most traditional, i.e. non-Marrist, linguistic re- search relates to the technical mode. The technical mode could be used to account for all apparent gaps in Marr's theo- ries, such as the lack of fit between linguistic properties and social systems and the remarkable fit between languages and nations,1 but it also underpinned an expansion of Marrism toward domains which had not yet been taken over. *As far as I can judge, my paper [viz. Abaev 1934] has evoked a certain confusion among a few linguists of the old school. They had never expected that the New Teaching on Language would develop in this direction. They thought that we, followers of N. Ja. Manr, would stay the course of our efforts into the "back of beyond" of palaeontological research and happily perish in those "thickets". [...] We sincerely fear that a great disillusion awaits these old-fashioned linguists. Those who think that the case of N.Ja. Marr will be over with his death are dead wrong. It cannot die, a teaching which carries such a revolutionary charge. It cannot die, a teaching which is engendered by the greatest social up- heaval of history, a teaching which is, in all its roots, tied to the system to which the future belongs: the socialist system. [...] We do not at all intend to turn into a closed sect, devoted to the specific domain of palaeontology, and leave all the other fields to the care of backward epigones of neogrammarianism. On the contrary, we claim the complete terrain of linguistics without exception. And the teaching on technization is one of the expressions of our claim.2 One of the terrains to be taken over seems to be lexicology. The history of Soviet lexicography is a complex one. Since the second half of the nineteenth century, all self-respecting European national languages have had a major dictionary in prepara- tion.3 The first instalment of the great Academy dictionary of Russian appeared in 1891. After the revolution, the old lexicographical principles and material collected during the nineteenth century continued to be used. The work was interrupted in 1929, when new volumes started being produced on the basis of new material and new principles.4 Jazykfront seems to have claimed the terrain until it was liquidated.5 Barxudarov reports that the Co-ordinating Committee for the Russian Language, which produced the dictionary, was incorporated into the Institute of Language and Thought in 1931: although the committee became an autonomous department in the institute, it subsisted on a minimal staff and funding.6 In 1936 the Marrists announced the publication of the first two volumes of their own dictionary.7 At that time, Filin had written his thesis on the changing agrarian vo- 1 Abaev 1936: 14. 2 Abaev 1936: 7. 3 The completion of some of these dictionaries has taken over a century: at the time of writing, the com- pletion of the dictionary of the Dutch language, the preparation of which started in 1851 [Van Sterkenburg 1978 Ü.21 88. note 3L is planned for 1998. 4 Unbeeaun 1953 (3.8.1.1): 128.

The available material suggests that Jazykfront was not interested in making dictionaries but in studying the "post-October lexicon" of the workers and the dynam- ics of lexical change: cf.

In a 1936 paper Filin puts it as follows. HThe depth, scope and speed of the development in the peasant's speech toward the standard language, as triggered by the collectivization of our agriculture, are unprecedented in any country. Local dialectal features [...] are literally "melting away" before our very eyes. Dialects can definitively be classified as remnants from the past, and their total extinction is only a matter of time. But it would be a mistake to characterize the process of linguistic creation which is taking place in the modern village as mere de- struction of the old: any subtle observer may discover, with the naked eye, an enormous amount of novel elements in the collective farmer's language.2 In his summer field work (between 1933 and 1935), Filin had largely adopted Danilov's 1928 methods. He observed the disappearance of old weights and measures, as well as other terms which relate to the organization of farming. Innovation consisted in adop- tion of Standard Russian and Sovietisms, and a potential contribution to the standard language through agricultural neologisms.3 In passing, Filin criticized D.N. Uáakov's 4- volume dictionary, the first volume of which had just appeared.4 While omitting many important terms from daily life under socialist construction, USakov was said to include a disproportionate amount of thieves' cant, which Filin had not observed at all.5 In 1937, public opinion and the press observed an "unsatisfactory situation" in the work on the Academy dictionary.6 Beljaev examined the state of the dictionary under preparation and reported on it in two papers.7 He was struck by the lack of attention for the period of the construction of socialism, which might be rshort in time (20 years) but had, by the richness of its contents, by far surpassed complete centuries in significance".8 The old dictionary included vulgar words and slang, religious vocabu- lary and archaisms, as well as other unnecessary words.9 Even in recent instalments much of the lexicon of the modern kolkhoz village was lacking, but the dictionary was full of popular distortions, like levoljúcija instead of revoljiicija ('revolution').10 The class essence of the words was insufficiently indicated: the word matrosnjá ('sailors', 'group of sailors'), for example, was marked as f"often conveying a shade of dispar- agement", without indication as to which class conveyed this shade, while rthe selfless role which sailors played in our revolution is entirely forgotten".11 Special attention was paid to the three million quotations in the archives of the Dictionary department, which had been collected to serve as examples of the way in which the words were used. Many quotations turned out to contain religious propaganda12 and vulgarities.13 1 L'Hermitte 1987 12k 46-47. 2 Filin 1936: 135. 3 Filin 1936: 143. 4 TSRJa 1 1934. 5 Filin 1936: 140. note 1. 6 Barxudarov 1957: 37; Unbesaun 1953 (3.8.1.1): 128. 7 Beljaev 1937, 1938. 8 Beliaev 1938: 3. 9 Beliaev 1937: 39-41. 1938: 5. 8. 10 Beliaev 1937:41. 1938:7. 11 Beljaev 1938:5-6. 12 Beljaev 1938: 7. 13 Beljaev 1937: 39.</page><page sequence="60">38 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER The sources used included such decadent poets as S.A. Esenin,1 and such enemies of the people as N.I. Buxarin (1888-1938),2 an important revolutionary and Stalin's for- mer ally, who had been editor in chief of Izvestija until 1937. Quotations from ap- proved authors, such as L.N. Tolstoj, M. Gor'kij and M.A. Soloxov, were rare. More- over, when such authors were adduced they were presented out of context, causing disastrous misrepresentations. Here are two examples of Beljaev's analysis. In the material for the Academy dictionary, the word nezábvennyj ('never-to-be- forgotten') was illustrated by a quotation from the satirist M.E. Saltykov-Sõedrin (1826-1889): r" Arakõeev [...] is never to be forgotten inasmuch as he prepared the peo- ple to the perception of communism." A.A. Arakõeev (1769-1834) was the ignorant old drill-sergeant of czar Paul I, who made a career at the court and became the minister of defense of Alexander I. After the Napoleonic wars, Arakõeev monopolized the confidence of the czar to the extent that he practically ruled the country, which he did with brutal methods. In Soviet history textbooks the period of his rule is referred to as arakõeevSõina. This term has become a synonym for extravagant administrative ferocity and highhandedness.3 Beljaev pointd out that, in failing to note Saltykov- Soedrin's ironical context, the lexicographers were representing this Arakõeev, the rabid foe of the Russian people, as a predecessor of communism, thus perverting the intentions of the great master of the word Saltykov-Sõedrin. Only people hostile to the Soviet state could do such things.4 Similarly, the authors of the Academy dictionary illustrated the word obmelét' ('grow shallow') by a quotation from the revolutionary writer A.I. Gercen (1812-1870) in which future generations are prophesied to grow shallower and shallower. In failing to point out that Gercen was only referring to future generations of Russian intelli- gencija, the lexicographers managed both to falsify Gercen and to slander the Soviet people.5 While inspecting the Dictionary Department, Beljaev discovered piles of filing boxes brimful with Trotskyite, fascist and other politically harmful quotations.6 He proposed a reorganization of everything. An entirely new dictionary project was officially started in 1938. The Marrists ousted some competent lexicographers and forced the remaining staff to work ac- cording to Marrist principles.7 Yet in 1939, the editor-in-chief V.l. CernySev reported in the Section of Literature and Language of the Academy of Sciences that the edi- tors had made great efforts to purge the text of instances of editing in the spirit of "vulgar sociologism".8 This accusation against Marrism would only become common- place after the 1950 discussion. 1 Beljaev 1937: 40. 2 Beljaev 1937: 40. 3 Carmichael 1968 (4): 135.

The first volume of the Academy Dictionary only appears in 1948. Its editorial committee, presided by CernySev, included Filin. S 0.7 Stalin's contribution to linguistics The 1950 debate must be the biggest public relations event in the history of linguis- tics. It was not enacted in linguistic journals, but in the party organ Pravda, the news- paper with the largest circulation in the world. It filled scores of pages, lasted three months, comprised 31 contributions and forced hundreds of Soviet watchers to im- merse themselves in the intricacies of linguistic theory. An English translation of the integral discussion was published in the United States in 1951. 1 The series started with a vigorous attack on Marr by the Georgian linguist Cikobava.2 Early contributions included more such attacks, especially directed against the ideological correctness of the New Teaching, against Marr's four ele- ments, and against the theory of development by stages. But defenses of Marrism were also included. The dispute took a spectacular turn when a personal contribution from Stalin appeared, entitled "On Marxism in linguistics". In Stalin's article, Marr's fundamental tenet that language belongs to the superstructure was rejected along with the class character of language. Marr's thesis that language, being conditioned by the economic base, develops in saltatory mutations, along with society, was easily falsified by comparing modern Russian and the language of the influential poet A.S. PuSkin (1799-1837). More than 100 years have elapsed since PuSkin's death. Within this period feudalism and capitalism were eliminated in Russia and a third, socialist order arose. Consequently, two bases were eliminated to- gether with their superstructures and a new, socialist base came into being together with its new su- perstructure. However, if one were to take the Russian language, it did not experience any clear break and present-day Russian differs little in structure from PuSkin's language.3 The ideological status of language was compared to that of railways, a familiar topos. There were once "Marxists" among us who maintained that the railroads which remained in our country after the October revolution were bourgeois, that we Marxists ought not to use them, that they should be torn up and new "proletarian" railroads built. For this they earned the sobriquet of troglodytes* More particularly, grammar was likened to geometry.5 Stalin recommends compara- tive linguistics above element analysis because notwithstanding its substantial shortcomings [...], the former is an impetus to work, to study languages, and the second is an impetus to lying on the oven and reading teacups {gadat'na kofejnoj guSõe) about the notorious four elements.** The Marrists were accused of un-Marxist haughtiness for their rejection of linguistic tradition. * Murra &amp; al. 1951, which is the source of quotations and references in this chapter. 2 Cikobava 1951. 3 Stalin 1951a: 71.

Marr introduced into linguistics an immodest, boastful, arrogant tone, not characteristic of Marx- ism and leading to the wholesale and irresponsible rejection of everything in linguistics before N.Ja. Marr [...] Marx and Engels were considerably more modest. They believed that their dialectical material- ism was the product of the development of sciences, philosophy included, over the preceding periods. ^ Stalin went out of his way to condemn the lack of tolerance of the Marrists: The slightest criticism of the state of affairs in Soviet linguistics, even the most timid attempts to criticize the so-called "new teaching" in linguistics was persecuted and stifled by the [Heading circles] of linguistics. Valuable scholars and research workers in linguistics were removed from their positions and reduced in status for criticism of the heritage of N.Ja. Marr and for the slightest disapproval of his teaching. Linguists were moved up into responsible positions not according to their qualifications in the field but as they gave unconditional recognition to N.Ja. Marr's teaching. It is universally recognized that no science can develop and flourish without a struggle of opinions, without free criticism. But this universally recognized rule has been ignored and trampled upon most unceremoniously. A self-contained group of infallible leaders has developed which has begun to ride roughshod and behave in the most arbitrary manner after guaranteeing itself against any possible criti- cism. [...] How could this have happened? This happened because the Arakceev-like regime established in lin- guistics cultivates irresponsibility and encourages such disorders. The [present] discussion has proved extremely useful because it has brought to light this Araköeev-like regime and smashed it to bits.2 According to the dictionaries the term Arakõeev-like regime (arakõeevskij reïim) is a synonym of arakõeevSõina.2 Some dictionaries provide a second meaning for arakõe- evSdina: ra situation in which a small group of people despotically and wilfully dictate an area of public life".4 In the contributions which followed, Stalin was extolled for his insight; some Marrists announced their conversion, and the consequences of the liberation of Soviet linguistics from Marrist folly for further linguistic research were examined. The discussion is concluded with Stalin's third contribution, which ends with a con- demnation of the "exegetes and Talmudists" of Marxism, who take the classics liter- ally, without taking the changed conditions of society into account. In the course of its development, Marxism cannot help but be enriched by new experience, by new knowledge; consequently, its individual formulas and conclusions must change with the passing of time, must be replaced by new formulas and conclusions corresponding to new historical tasks. Marx- ism does not recognize immutable conclusions and formulas obligatory for all epochs and periods. Marxism is the enemy of all kinds of dogmatism.^ The laudatory ritual was extensively repeated in the specialist literature. Numerous editions of Stalin's linguistic contributions were published in the following years, and Stalin's tenets would remain the basis of theoretical linguistics in such countries as China and Albania for decades to come.6 Collections of papers appeared, entitled î Against Vulgarization and Perversion of Marxism in Linguistics,7 or ¡Problems of Theory and History of Language in Light of the Works of I.V.

The newly established authoritative journal on linguistics, Voprosy jazykoznanija ('Problems of Linguistics'), was launched in 15,000 copies in 1952. An extract from the former Marrist Filin: Hn much of the output of the followers of the "new teaching" of language, particularly descriptive work (including my own), there was nothing at all of the "theory" of N.Ja. Marr. Yet such works [...] were ad- vertized as written in the spirit of the "Marxist new teaching" of language. To me the harmful effects of such "tactics" are now fully clear. We had many students and graduate students; many linguists, in the centre and in the country, listened to us. Many linguists, especially the younger ones, in order to pass their degrees, to get their work printed, and to have the possibility to do their work without various "unpleasant things", tried to pass themselves off as followers of the "new teaching" of language in and out of season they interspersed their research with commonplaces from the "theory" of N.Ja. MarrJ This fragment illustrates the problem of the historian of Soviet linguistics. Some of Filin's earlier work was Marrist to an extent which was way beyond the required con- ventional or obligatory quotations.2 Is it possible to keep his convictions and his ritual apart? And can we accept Filin's work from the early fifties, with its citations of Stalin's linguistic work, at face value? This would imply that Stalin himself would ac- tually have liberated linguistics. This interpretation of Stalin's intervention is in fact supported by several investi- gators. The external context of Soviet linguistics in the period of the 1950 debate, which should determine its validity, is unclear to this day. As yet no fully satisfactory account of Stalin's intervention has been given. Historians, who describe Stalin's statements as "obscure and often inconsistent",3 tend to rank the linguistics incident with the events in biology, where Lysenko reas- sumed ideological control of the discipline in 1948 with his version of the Marxist the- ories of evolution which had been developed by I.V. Miõurin (1855-1935). As a result of Lysenko's actions, numerous biologists occupying high posts in the research net- work had been removed. As with the biology incident, the attack on the followers of the "eminent philologist" Marr is regarded by the historians as a campaign to oust powerful intellectuals whose allegiance to the regime was not absolutely certain.4 Both episodes are viewed as parts of ¿danovSõina, the post-war crackdown on culture and science which was carried out by Stalin's second-in-command A.A. Zdanov, who was charged with cultural policy in the Central Committee.5 But the linguistics and bi- ology cases diverge in a number of respects. Miourin's and Lysenko's theories, in re- jecting genetics as a bourgeois theory and positing the possibility of triggering salta- tory mutations by manipulating the conditions of organisms, call to mind Marr's views rather than Stalin's. Even the terminology coincides: a theory of development by stages is as prominent in Lysenko's teaching as it is in Marr's. Another difference between the biology and the linguistics incidents is Stalin's personal participation in the debate in the latter, which is unprecedented: in the biology affair pressure was, at 1 Filin 1951: 362. z L'Hermitte [1987 (2): 46] describes his dissertation, which, besides dealing with modern agrarian vocabu- lary, contains a considerable share of Marrist palaeontology. 3 Pethybridge 1966 (2): 73. 4 Pethybridge 1966 12k 73. 5 See, for example, Pethybridge 1966 (2k 72-74.</page><page sequence="64">42 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER least formally, exerted by the Central Committee. Finally, the consequences of Lysenko's actions for biological practice were not limited to the imposition of a spuri- ous research paradigm: the personal lives of many scientists were seriously affected.1 The consequences of the linguistics affair, as L'Hermitte points out,2 were less far- reaching. True, the Institute of Language and Thought merged with the Institute of Russian to become the Moscow-based Institute of Linguistics, and Marr's successor, I.I. MeSõaninov, had to cede his position at the top of Soviet linguistics to the Russian specialist V.V. Vinogradov. But MeSõaninov was only demoted to the third place in the hierarchy.3 Students of Marxism and Marxist philosophy consider Stalin's linguistics contribu- tions as marking a turning point in the development of the ideology.4 Stalin quite ex- plicitly states, for example, that the superstructure is manipulable, and the state is the appropriate agent.5 On the other hand, the transformation of language from a super- structure category into a rsocietal phenomenon sui generis"6 raised the question of whether other societal phenomena could also acquire that status.7 In the Soviet Union, the ideological import of Stalin's intervention was underlined by a few works on its significance for dialectical materialism8 and numerous works on its implications for Soviet history, economics, and literature.9 In the west, the ideological aspects of the discussion were studied and discussed in the early fifties,10 but after Stalin's death the Pravda discussion was forgotten until it came back into vogue in continental leftist circles in the late sixties, e.g. the Parisian scene surrounding L. Althusser.11 The dis- cussion could demonstrate the possibility of serious dialogue on important subjects in a Marxist setting, and even the relevance of the humanities to revolutionary politics. On the other hand, the linguistic technicalities which were raised in the Pravda discussion were prone to obscure any ideological message beyond that of Marxism in 1 Both Lysenko's Soviet critics of the 1950s and western observers note that the application of Lysenko's theories also caused serious setbacks in Soviet agriculture (cf. Buchholz 1964 (1): 3-4). But Lewontin &amp; Levins [1976: 57-59] adduce production figures for wheat, Lysenko's favourite crop, which suggest that the application of his theories had no perceptible impact. In 1947 [{8&gt;. 187, note 2] Ashby reported that Lysen- ko's methods were not used at all on cereals except for experimental work. 2 L'Hermitte 1987 (3): 80. 3 Prezidium AN SSSR 1950a, Prezidium AN SSSR 1950b. The Leningrad-based Institute of Language and Thought had a branch in Moscow; the Institute of Russian, which had started out as a branch of the Insti- tute of Language and Thought but had become an independent institute in 1944 [Koduxov 1974: 271, was Moscow-based but had a branch in Leningrad. The new institute encompassed all Academy linguistic re- search except Slavonic and Oriental studies. 4 Cf. Marcuse 1964/1989 (1.7): 152-153. 5 Cf.

The ideological import of the discussion does not explain why Stalin opted for a discussion on linguistics to make his ideological points clear. The linguists' interpretation of the affair is diametrically opposed to that of the historians. Even in countries and periods beyond Stalin's control, his intervention is described in terms of its positive consequences for linguistics. As is to be expected, the fact of Stalin's intervention is said to underscore the political interest which the regime attached to the discipline.1 But linguists also point to a considerable liberali- zation of the research climate in the ensuing period.2 Lepschy plays with the idea of applying the deterministic Marxist interpretation of history to Stalin's own behaviour. Ht is possible to view in Stalin's contributions in linguistics the beginning of, if we may put it that way, destalinizatioa of the struggle against the "personality cult", of the cultural "thaw". The dominance of the Marrist positions, which was based on administrative structures and organisation of culture, was a typically Stalinist phenomenon. But Stalin intervened, declaring with a fine sense of humour [..fi Lepschy then adduces a few liberal passages from Stalin's intervention of the type quoted above. Newmeyer seems to believe that the very fact that the debate could take place implies that the research climate had already been liberalized. He describes the events in terms of Raskin's bona fide academic discussions. Whatever Soviet ideology might have dictated, the nation's linguists could not put Marr's ideas into practice. As one observer of the 1949 meeting noted: "The Institute of Language and Thought was un- able to present a single report throwing light on the basic questions of Marr's teaching." [...] The disaffected linguists, frustrated by their own inability to carry out reasonable research and em- barrassed at the international ridicule to which Soviet linguistics was being subjected, sought aid in the highest quarter of the land - they went to Stalin. And Stalin intervened for them personally, on their behalf. [...] The Marrist period in Soviet linguistics had come to an end. What Stalin did was no less than to assert the autonomy of grammar.4 Of course, Newmeyer's account is tongue-in-cheek. It seems improbable that lin- guists, after twenty years of Marrism, would simultaneously discover their own and each other's inability to work with Marr's ideas. It seems even less likely that scien- tists, at the height of ideological warfare, when "servility to foreign pseudoscience" was a common accusation, would worry about their reputation abroad, and it seems inconceivable that linguists in paradigmatic distress would voluntarily agree to play- ing Russian roulette by seeking from Stalin the wise judgement that can be expected from the king in a Walt Disney fairy tale. Newmeyer's presentisi conclusion that Stalin asserted the autonomy of grammar is, of course, correct, but so would a Saussurean's observation that Stalin, by removing language from the superstructure, restored the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign. 1 E.g. Girke &amp; Jachnow 1974 (2.5): 63. 2 E.g. the editor's note in Rubenstein 1951: 281, or, for example, Kuznecov, P.S., 1966: 67-68: Stalin's doctrine provided the linguists with an incomparably broader domain of independent scholarly activity than Marr's "new teaching". [... Tlhe so-called Stalin doctrine did not contain the absurdities with which Marr's "new teaching on language" abounded. 3 Lepschy 1967/1981: 93. A similar statement is found in Lepschy 1979: 184, note 1. 4 Newmeyer 1986 (5): 1 16-1 17. Newmeyer does not identify "the" 1949 meeting, nor the quoted observer.</page><page sequence="66">44 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER However implausible Newmeyer's reading may sound, it is hard to come up with a convincing alternative reconstruction. L'Hermitte, probably the best-informed inves- tigator of the incident, mentions a few possible reasons for Stalin's intervention: - personal connections with his countryman Cikobava, who was an opponent of Marr's theories; - the desire to promote the superiority of Russian or the brotherhood of the Slav peoples; - antagonism between Moscow and Leningrad; - the desire to demonstrate omniscience; - or, simply, common sense.1 But L'Hermitte does not venture a definitive conclusion. The post-war Stalin era is one of the least accessible periods of Russian or Soviet history. A great deal of power was concentrated in networks which generated little information, and was exerted according to an unpredictable pattern. Historians can- not avoid compensating for the scarcity of information on the events by psychologiz- ing about the protagonists. This is not objectionable, provided that no available fac- tual information is contradicted and the hypothetical status of the psychological in- ferences is clearly indicated. The Pravda discussion has been the subject of numerous studies but, as we saw, various investigators approach the incident from different angles and come to contradictory conclusions. A comprehensive survey, such as Medvedev's book on the Lysenko affairs,2 does not exist. A complete reconstruction of the Pravda discussion would represent a separate enterprise, which is of great in- terest but falls outside the scope of the present chapter. Nevertheless the incident seems to be of sufficient importance to justify presenting a brief integrated account of what little material can be found in accessible sources, as well as a few scenarios for the events on which information is missing: such an account may provide a point of departure for serious research and challenge informed former Soviets to provide additional information or more plausible hypotheses. The assembled material is pre- sented in the following notes (§0.8 to §0.10). S 0.8 Note on Stalin's reasons for deciding against Marr Some sources regard Stalin's contributions to the Pravda discussion as policy docu- ments, which contain implicit or explicit political arguments for rejecting Marr's the- ories. Such reasons, which will be treated in the present section, represent only a part of the problem: Stalin's motives for choosing the specific moment and setting for ex- pressing his objections are at least as important, and may even reduce the signifi- cance of the Pravda contributions as policy documents. They will be returned to in §0.9f. Some plausible suggestions can be made as to Stalin's political reasons for rejecting Marr's views. It will be shown below that, in 1950, the Marxist views on the develop- ment of society from which Marr pretended to derive his linguistic conceptions, were out of date. 1 L'Hermitte 1987 (2): 73-75. 2Medvedevl969.</page><page sequence="67">THE CONTEXT 45 The raison d'être of a paradigm, i.e. a system of assumptions which are conven- tionally held to be true in a social structure or network, is often underpinned by com- parison with its alternatives, as presented in terms of the paradigm itself. This pro- vides two rhetorical options: revolutionary rhetoric and rhetoric of continuity.^ In revolutionary rhetoric, emphasis is on the differences between the proper paradigm and other paradigms which have been, or will be, replaced by it, the message being that the proper paradigm offers the more favourable alternative. In the rhetoric of continuity, on the other hand, the lack of alternatives to the proper paradigm is em- phasized: its legitimacy, "mainstreamness", naturalness, or inevitability is demon- strated by its noble roots, it connections with, and similarities to, preceding paradigms. A revolution is, naturally, accompanied by revolutionary rhetoric. But the returns on revolutionary rhetoric diminish as first-hand experience with the alternatives be- comes scarce, while the chance of the revolutionary rhetoric being availed of by heretical tendencies increases. The problem for a paradigm is when and how to switch rhetoric. An early switch to a rhetoric of continuity brings with it the problem that the frame of reference of the new paradigm is not sufficiently broad to provide a canon- izable corpus: for some aspects, pre-revolutionary elements must be resorted to. In the twenties the world revolution seemed at hand: the Russian revolution only initiated a short transition period on the way to the next stage of society. The course of history, as well as the behaviour of individuals, was governed by deterministic rules. The development of society was described in terms of universal stages, affect- ing all of mankind, whereas the behaviour of individuals was determined by their so- cial class. But in the thirties, the ideological implications of building "socialism in one country" on the way to the global victory of world communism, which was Stalin's issue against L.D. Trockij, were assessed. Within the Soviet Union, class struggle was vir- tually over for lack of classes. In 1936, class discrimination was removed from the constitution. In the early versions of the ideology, events were assumed to be deter- mined by the course of history. A person's behaviour was assumed to be determined by his class. But the new line put an end to determinism and emphasized personal re- sponsibility, holding out the prospect of moral rewards and physical sanctions for various sorts of individual behaviour. Such moral rewards and sanctions required a framework of values. Therefore the concept of "socialist nation" was shaped. It em- phasized the antagonism between Soviet society as a whole and other contemporary societies, rather than the antagonisms within Soviet society or that between Soviet and pre-Soviet society. One of the implications of nation building was the development of a Soviet cultural policy. Whereas the orthodox ideology considered the perception of various cate- gories of human cultural behaviour, such as beauty and pride, to be conditioned by the socio-economic context of a group or individual, the new version viewed it as po- tentially manipulable. Culture in its widest sense was regarded as instrumental to the production and maintenance of values which could serve the nation.

As Stalin's cul- tural man A.A. Zdanov insisted, music, literature, and other forms of culture should be "national in form, socialist in content",2 a slogan which can be traced back to a speech delivered by Stalin in 1925.3 A.A. Zdanov also reiterated Stalin's dictum that "writers are engineers of human souls".4 Propaganda, agitation, culture and science were united into a single rhetorical continuum. The humanities were viewed as instrumental in carrying out the new cul- tural policies. They were now subject to two sets of requirements: ideological re- quirements, pertaining to the contents of the messages being generated, and propa- gandists requirements, pertaining to their effectiveness in engineering the souls of the public. These goals did not necessarily coincide: an ideologically correct message may be too complex to come across. This could produce conflicting priorities and lead to policy shifts. History is likely to be the discipline to provide the most transparent illustration of such changes. On the one hand, it was the study of history as a science that had brought about the revolution by predicting it. On the other hand, history teaching was generally believed to be an effective instrument of social engineering, i.e. for the civic, moral and emotional formation of future generations, at the service of the es- tablished powers.5 In the twenties, the people's commissar for education A.V. Lunaõarskij (1875-1933) had wanted to abolish history in the schools as it only kindled the children's nationalist sentiments.6 The historian M.N. Pokrovskij (1868-1932), who headed the Communist Academy, had analysed all historic events in terms of a deterministic class struggle, in which there was no place for heroes and villains who could be held responsible for their actions. The czarist past was depicted as the empire of darkness, livened up every now and then by an anonymous popular uprising or bomb explosion. The under- lying philosophy of Pokrovskij's conception is often characterized by means of his dictum that rhistory is politics projected into the past",7 which in its most moderate interpretation produces an extreme variety of presentism.8 History was only useful in so far as it reflected class struggle. Pokrovskij died in 1932. In line with the philosophy which was ascribed to him, history was subject to modifications reflecting any changes on the political agenda. In 1934, Pokrovskian history was passé. A joint decree from the government and the 1 Trockii 1937 (1 1.3): 289: "exoensive ülavthines: oalaces of the Soviets, new theaters, show-off subwavs". 2 Cf.

Instead of the teaching of civic history in an animated and entertaining form with an exposition of the most important events and facts in their chronological sequence and with sketches of historical person- ages, the pupils are given abstract definitions of social and economic formations, which thus replace the consecutive exposition of civic history by abstract sociological schemes. * Pokrovskij's mechanist model was replaced by narrative structures, with persons as foci for emotional reference. Like other nations, a socialist nation wanted a past, a pedestal for the present. But the socialist past was too short to provide it. Like the avenues leading toward the statues and the skyscrapers, the pre-socialist past was annexed and refurnished: henceforth it served again as a setting for national myths and was paved with inspiring examples of heroism and instructive examples of good and bad characters. Propagandistic requirements tended to take the upper hand over the ideological groundwork. As a result, historical research and history teaching were sensitive to even minor fluctuations in the political line. Van het Reve illustrates this with the example of the 1812 Moscow fire, which broke out when Napoleon occupied the city, and had presented the historians with a few dilemmas.2 Ever since the fire, opinions about its cause diverged. The fire had broken out spontaneously; or the Russian population had set fire to Moscow in order to dislodge the French; or the French had kindled the fire in order to destroy the town. In Pokrovskij's version, Moscow had been set afire by order of the governor of Moscow, who was prepared to sacrifice the dwellings and possessions of the ordinary people in order to get the French out.3 In the late thirties the question was left open for a while,4 but in the forties the Moscow fire had become "an act of heroic popular patriotism".5 This version is likely to have served to glorify self-sacrifice in both the on-going and the expected future struggles against foreign invaders. Soon after the war, the patriotist version was expanded with a new element. In 1946 Stalin published a letter on ideology and military strategy. While explaining the subtle difference between a counter-attack (after a lost battle) and a counter-offen- sive (after a retreat), Stalin expressed his enthusiasm for the strategic conceptions of Field Marshal M.I. Kutuzov (1745-1813), who had assumed command of the struggle against Napoleon at the request of the people, after the failure of the regular com- manders to stop the French invader. Stalin describes Kutuzov as f"the general of ge- nius, who ruined Napoleon and his army by means of a well-prepared counter-offen- sive".6 This started a Kutuzov cult, which lasted until Stalin's death. The ideological and historical journals were filled with articles highlighting Kutuzov's genius and other virtues. The composer S.S. Prokof'ev had largely finished his opera War and Peace (Vojna i mir), after Tolstoj's novel about the war against Napoleon, during the 1 Quoted from Daniels 1960 {Aï 39.

But in 1946 he started rewriting it in an effort to monumentalize and heroize, expanding the character of Kutuzov, as a result of which the opera had to be split into two parts. Kutuzov's famous hymn to Moscow was the most rewritten item in the opera.1 Van het Reve views the Kutuzov cult as a projection of the need to be led, which Bolsheviks tend to ascribe to the people, Kutuzov being the most eligible person to act, in Van het Reve's terms, as a locum tenens for the Party.2 It may be added that, while promoting Kutuzov as a strategist of great genius in the Patriotic War (as the war against Napoleon was called), the Soviet leadership was also providing justifica- tion for its own strategies in the Great Patriotic War (as the war against Hitler was called). Instead of admitting weakness by having allowed the Germans to invade the country, it could be demonstrated that great generals of the glorious past had, against Napoleon, been precursors of Stalin's "strategy" against Hitler, the message being that allowing enemies in before destroying them is the usual strategy for military geniuses. The Moscow fire was viewed as a product of Kutuzov's genius: it was a brilliant stratagem, carefully planned and executed under the supervision of the Field Marshall.3 However, as Van het Reve points out, at some point between 1949 and 1951 it must have been decided that the Kutuzov construction was too complex and detracted from the propagandistic value of the Moscow fire. Historians suddenly discovered reports of eye-witnesses contradicting the population's heroic sacrifice: Moscow burned by the Russians is something relatively complicated and astonishing: an evil deed done in the interests of a good cause [...]. For a philosophy which with increasing crudeness divides the world into an evil and a good half, it must have been easier to let the evil deed be done by evil men: after 1950 it is no longer the Russian patriots, but rather the French invaders who have set fire to the city. And they had done it on purpose.4 Elsewhere Van het Reve describes an analogous development in literature.5 Initially the classics of world literature were analysed in terms of class determination. Since most writers had a bourgeois background, a great deal of world literature had to be condemned. Later, the ideologists became aware of both the negative propagandistic consequences of this approach and the potential advantages of mobilizing the classics for the socialist nation. Theorists of literature started disentangling the positive (visionary) and negative (class-bound) aspects of each classic. This was a difficult task, and its complex results were hard to get across to the ordinary reader. By 1950 the goals of the theory of literature had been revised. It simply had to ensure the complete concurrence of aesthetic, ethic and ideological qualities. The replacement, in the nomenclature of the humanities, of the orthodox sociologizing terminology (e.g. proletariat, revolutionary, ideological j (ideologideskij)) by a vaguer system (e.g. masses, progressive, ideologica^ (idejnyj)) enabled Soviet humanities to annex and canonize many Russian classics. Lenin could be found to have said that r"there are two 1 Sadie 1992 (Prokofiev): 1138. 2 Van het Reve 1955: 170; see the notes to Van het Reve 1954 (9): 135 for references to Soviet sources. 3 Van het Reve 1955: 170. 4 Van het Reve 1955: 171. 5 Van het Reve 1954.</page><page sequence="71">THE CONTEXT 49 national cultures within each national culture", viz. the dominant culture of the classes who are in power, and the democratic seed {zerno' which grows like a pearl.1 A.A. Zdanov, who was responsible for the cultural policies of the party, was said to have insisted that Soviet literature and art continue to develop the best traditions of Rus- sian literature of the 19th century.2 But the socialist nations could even be considered the legitimate heirs of a great deal of progressive world literature. As Lenin had put it, ryou can only become a communist when you enrich your memory with knowledge of all the riches which mankind has brought forth".3 Thus, whereas PuSkin had started out, after the October Revolution, as T"the ideologist of capitalizing (kapitaliziru- juSõijsja) nobility",4 he had made it to r"the great poet of the great nation" by 1949.5 Typically, PuSkin's greatness was illustrated by his glorification of the genius of Kutuzov.6 In the case of linguistics, Stalin was presented with a conflict between Marr's ideo- logical approach and the propagandists and educational potential of the discipline. Marr had been part of Pokrovskij's circuit: in 1928 they had written articles on each other's qualities as Marxist theorists.7 The theorist of literature Friõe, who promoted Marr against Polivanov in 1929, was an associate of Pokrovskij.8 After Stalin's inter- vention in the Pravda debate, Pokrovskij's "protection" was repeatedly adduced against Marr.9 Marr's theories, like Pokrovskij's and Frioe's, were based on both his- torical and class determinism. This principle was now rejected, or at least played down, in the new humanities: their most prominent exponents were qualified as "vul- garizers" of Marxism. Numerous investigators infer that Stalin condemned Marr's views because they did not support the superiority of Russian.10 The inference is based on Stalin's rejection of language crossings, and on his contention that, wherever two languages meet, one defeats the other. Stalin illustrated this with Russian, "with which the languages of a number of other peoples blended in the course of historical development and which always emerged victorious".11 On the other hand, in his conclusive contribution Stalin warned against generalization of this statement.12 He explained that the model of lin- guistic victors and vanquished is only valid before the world-wide victory of socialism: after the victory, hundreds of languages were to gradually 1 Manujlov 1949: 178. 2 BSE 15 19522 ßdanov): 606. 3 Manuilov 1949: 184. 4 Cf.

He was, of course, likely to keep in mind that Russian was the vehicle of the major culture which had adopted socialism, the "most eminent inaibolee vydajuSõipjaT of the nations of the Soviet Union: it is only natural that a politician, once confronted with linguistic mat- ters, related the issues to the major language of his country. It is true that, as of 1947, historical resistance movements and national epics of some peoples (in Kazakhstan, Dagestan, Kirghizia, Yakutia) had begun to be reassessed and would end up being branded reactionary, their national heroes being converted from freedom fighters into British agents.2 But Soviet cultural policy as such was not explicitly geared to Russian. The Ukrainian, Georgian and Polish classics were also annexed; each Soviet republic had its institutes for the study of the local literature and standard languages. The advantages of Stalin's ambiguous choice were illustrated by the following quo- tation from B.V. Mixajlovskij, speaking during a session on the consequences of Sta- lin's work for the theory of literature. HTie profound analysis of the problem of language crossing acquires an enormous political significance. The scientific conclusions of comrade Stalin reinforce the belief of the peoples in the constancy of their existence as national entities, in the colossal resistance of their language and the nation which has cre- ated it to assimilation by their conquerors: the colonizers and imperialists. Stalin's new work provides a firm base for understanding, in particular, the history of Russian in its national originality: it shows that in the crossing process Russian always emerged victorious [...1.3 When discussing the question of whether Stalin intended to enhance the position of Russian, two aspects must be distinguished: 1 the actual position of Russian as the language of the socialist block; 2 the superiority of Russian as a propaganda item. It may be contended that, if promoting the actual position of Russian was Stalin's specific goal, he would not have had sufficient reason to reject Marr. The New Teaching on Language offered both practical and propagandists instruments to do so. The Marrist anti-purist and anti-structuralist view of individually travelling lexical items supported transmission of international words, such as tele fon ('telephone') and komsomólec ('member of the communist youth'), without regard for the "system" of the adopting language. As Marr put it, "terminology is the language of the future".4 In the traditonal view, large-scale and unadapted absorption of foreign elements may be viewed as erosion of a language, but in the Marrist view this could be interpreted as a sign of progress: international objects and thoughts are part of a new society, i.e. a new way of thinking, and it is only natural that linguistic items should accompany the objects and thoughts which they denote as they spread across the globe.

Russian, should provide the linguistic items for the new world society.2 Marrism was fully consistent with Stalin's linguistic policy of the early thirties, when Ukrainian and Belorussian started being infiltrated with Russian lexical items and even morphological and phonotactic patterns.3 "By and by, from one school textbook to another, the intellec- tual vocabulary of these languages, which was mainly of Polish origin, became re- placed by a Russian one."4 Note that, after inverting the direction of linguistic devel- opment, as advocated by the New Teaching on Language, Ukrainian and Russian had not so much recently grown apart but were rather in the last stage of merger. Simi- larly, Marrism predicted increasing uniformity of semantic distinctions of different languages, which was enhanced by the uniform economic structures. The precise role of the state in furthering such a process was only a technical matter: all language is artifical. The non-Slavic languages, several of which had been fragmented by the emancipation of former dialects, were supplied with caiques and loan words from Russian. The only complaint which Stalin might have in this respect is that attrition and erosion of the minority languages in the Marrist fashion did not proceed fast enough. But, then again, the Marrists, with their saltatory mutations, should be the first to complain, and Stalin did not present a practical alternative. As to the superiority of Russian as a propaganda item, Cikobava, in his contribution to the Pravda discussion, actually scorned Marr for implicitly promoting the Indo- European languages (including Russian) as being superior to the Japhetic ones (including Georgian, the mother tongue of Marr, Cikobava and Stalin) by assigning the former to the highest stage of linguistic development, one stage ahead of the latter.5 The propagandists advantages of the theory of stages were to be demonstrated much later by the ex- and neo-Marrist Budagov, who in 1972 considered people to express their thoughts and feelings more precisely, more completely and more adequately in languages of the "nominative nature (strojT (such as Russian) than in languages of the "ergative nature" (such as Georgian);6 Budagov even recalled that Marx and Engels in their writings distinguished between languages in an advanced stage of development and less developed languages; he insisted on research into various levels of de- velopment of human thought as reflected in linguistic differences.7 Goodman in fact ascribes to Marr the idea of promoting the superiority of Russian by placing it in the 1 Abaev 1936: 16. Speaking trumpets were among the icons of ideological struggle, referring to mass communication and orchestration of large quantities of individuals. The Russian name rúpor, which derives from Dutch roeper Cshouter'), is perceived as international. 2 Not all Marrists immediately discerned this advantage. In Aptekar' &amp; Bykovskij 1931: 41, the introduction of Russian material in minority languages was viewed as chauvinist: cf. Girke &amp; Jachnow 1974 (2.4): 57-59 for an analysis of Marrist views on language planning. 3 Cf., e.g., Kovaliv 1954: 57-59; Seduro 1954: 65-66; Stankievich 1954. 4 Kiparsky 1963: 95. 5 Cikobava 1951: 16. b Budagov 1972 {41 410. 7 Budagov 1972 (4): 410-411.</page><page sequence="74">52 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER highest stage,1 but the thought never seems to have occurred to Marr himself, whose connotations of the stages were essentially romantic: his Japhetic languages evoke a paradise lost, a classless Arcadia, which was destroyed by the "coup de grâce of the Indo-European slave-holders,2 and will be restored in the future global language, which will absorb the valuable elements of even the least significant tribal language.3 But, whether or not the promotion of Russian was Stalin's specific goal, Marrists were susceptible to accusations of cosmopolitism. Stalin considered nations to be the basic building blocks of the socialist world, thus compartmentalizing it and reserving international contacts for the higher echelons. Language was considered the defining criterion of a nation. The application of this criterion in turn required reliable criteria as to what constitutes a language and distinguishes one language from the other. Original Marrism did not offer such criteria: its basic units are freely travelling indi- vidual items. Marrism did not recognize inalienable core properties, which were sooner condemned as racist. Marr's prediction that an artificial language will replace all existing (bourgeois and impractical) languages, sounded downright cosmopolitan.4 The few linguistic novelties in Stalin's contribution in fact included the designation of the set of core properties determining a language: the so-called basic lexical fund iosnovnoj slovarnyj fond)? A few more arguments motivating Stalin's rejecting the New Teaching on Language may be added. As a practical consideration, the complexity of Marr's theories made them useless in the schools. Teachers would have to be convinced of their validity, and persuaded to teach them to their classes, where they should ignore the obvious generalizations and concentrate on far-fetched similarities, which could only be demonstrated by means of extensive palaeontological juggling. The New Teaching on Language could not compete with grammar teaching in the schools. Palaeontological analysis could only be trusted to specialists, and did not appeal to the pupils: nothing to apply, no stories to be fascinated by. The rules of grammar, on the other hand, were ideal for teaching: the analysis of one sentence could be generalized to other sentences; grammar provided conceptual frameworks which could be exploited in 1 Goodman (1960)71968: 729. 2 Marr's own term, quoted in L'Hermitte 1987 (1): 12. How hard it was, in the early days, to break away from Humboldtian ideas on ethnic genius was demonstrated by Abaev's [1926: 207] terminological proposal to replace the term Indo-European. He reserves the term Aryan for reference to the Indo-Iranian languages and obviously claims Japhetic for other references. Indo-Germanic and Indo-European are rejected for their implicit nationalism. Having advocated adopting a conventional term which does not evoke inappropriate associations, he considered Promethean particularly appropriate as the "Indo-European" peoples embodied Prometheus' rcreative spirit, energy and initiative". 3 Marr 1974 (5): 91-92, as partly quoted in §0.6. 4 As Laurat [1951 (6A): 661 reminds us, Marr [e.g. 1974 (1): 87-88] even broke a lance for Esperanto, which was a popular vehicle for communist propaganda until the mid thirties, but in the forties became a means of communication across the Iron Curtain for cosmopolites. Laurat [1951 (6D): 86] reported that, in the course of 1950, broadcasts in Esperanto were discontinued in all East European countries (with the exception of Radio Sofia, which Laurat expected to follow suit soon). Marr himself did not have a high opinion of Esperanto as an attempt: the language of the future was to be both artificial and living [Marr 1933a: 176]. But he nevertheless considered Esperanto an instructive pilot project [Marr 1928/1936: 398]. 5 Stalin 1951a: 73-74; 1950b: 47-52.</page><page sequence="75">THE CONTEXT 53 writing and in learning foreign languages. Stalin had learned grammar at school and in the seminary. Furthermore, a great deal of Marrist empirical research concentrated on minor languages inside and outside the Soviet Union (especially the really minor ones, with 10,000 speakers or less), which was good for antiracism but only marginally con- tributed to socialist nation building. Finally, consider Marr's rejection of proto-languages and genealogical relations. Pleading in favour of Marr's teaching was the fact that the family tree had been used by the Germans to provide a scientific basis for their racist theories. On the other hand, the new socialist countries in Central Europe included all Slav peoples. Empha- sis on the family ties could provide propagandists gains: as the opening of a separate Institute of Slavic Studies in Moscow in 1947 suggests,1 one was prepared to cash in on this. Even non-Slavic socialist nations could be placated: the Romanians, for exam- ple, could continue to exploit their Latin descent instead of being degraded to an or- dinary Balkan language crossing, as the Marrists regarded them.2 Moreover, in terms of classic status, there was nothing wrong with the family tree: it could be considered to represent a great progressive 19th-century tradition, which overrode Humboldt's idealist views and was now threatened by such decadent formalist western trends as structuralism. If one elaborates on Stalin's remark, quoted in §0.7, that Marx and Engels considered dialectical materialism the product of the development of sciences over the preceding periods, Marr's policy of "burning the bridges" with Indo-Euro- peanist tradition just had to be rejected.3 The linguistics that Stalin wanted should serve his rhetoric of continuity. It should be fit for supporting the Soviet annexation of the past of the peoples of the Soviet Union, for upgrading Soviet culture. This required denial of linguistic change as pro- duced by social upheavals. In 1950, two great linguistic monuments which could hardly be related to Marr's theories but fit well in the development sketched above, were under construction. The first monument was the 17-volume dictionary of Russian: a normative dic- tionary covering all of the classics, the first volume of which had appeared in 1948. As Barxudarov represents the facts, only strenuous efforts on the part of the profes- sional lexicographers had so far safeguarded the project against excessive Marrist interference.4 The second monument under construction was the three-volume Academy Grammar of Russian, which comprised over 1800 large pages and appeared in 1952.5 This traditional grammar illustrates almost every syntactic phenomenon with sen- tences from both the classics and Soviet literature. Russian is presented as an integral unity: the message of the Academy grammar was an absolute denial of even the slight- est fault line between pre- and post-revolutionary Russian.

Lomonosov (1711-1765), for his book Russkij jazyk ('the Russian language'),1 which manifested the same approach. The adoption of an exclusively Marrist paradigm would have made such a monument unfeasible. Needless to say, it was Vinogradov who, in the Pravda discussion, pointed to the Marrists' neglect of Russia's pre-revolutionary linguistic heritage, "which in many areas of linguistic re- search was far ahead of Western European bourgeois linguistics".2 Thus, it is plausible that Stalin, once confronted with the contents of the New Teaching on Language, would regard it as unfit to serve his aims. Kuipers and Maas attribute Stalin's exemption of linguistics from superstructure status to the desire to adopt modern linguistic theories needed for language technol- ogy.3 This assumption is weakened by the fact that the technology motive did not seem to be encoded in the discussion itself, nor did it surface in the ensuing discussions. With the exception of Saumjan's 1952a paper on the phoneme, which proposed a phonology based on Marxist dialectics but was ruthlessly exposed as structuralist,4 Soviet linguistics continued to combat modern trends until 1955. If technological motives cannot be corroborated, technocratic motives may under- lie Stalin's linguistic choice. As Bulthaup and Gente suggest, in presenting language as class-neutral, like other means of production, Stalin acknowledged the existence and desirability of a technocratic domain, free of class struggle.5 This is in fact a devia- tion with which the leftists of Althusser's circuit charged Stalin: he had created an isolated class of technical specialists and managers.6 But this deviation had developed before 1950 and is naturally connected with Stalin's utilitarian cultural policies: as the exact sciences were utilized for technical engineering, the humanities were mobilized for "mentality" engineering. S 0.9 Note on the previous history of the Pravda debate Stalin's reasons for rejecting Marrism are not enough to explain the episode. It must be explained why it was decided to deal with Marr in 1950. After all, most of Stalin's reasons already applied in the thirties, when the vulgar sociologism of orthodox Marxist history and literature was exposed, and its exponents, such as Pokrovskij and Friõe, posthumously excommunicated. In a way, Stalin's reasons were valid as early as 1929, when consistent application of the edinonaõalie principle, which substituted personal responsibility for determinism, should have excluded the appointment of a personally responsible naöal'nik with deterministic theories.

Linguistics had little interest and a low profile. Most writers present the complete Soviet period until 1950 as the dark ages, in which lin- guistics and linguists were under total Marrist control, but the actual picture is rather varied. Marrism never dominated all reflection on language in the Soviet Union. Marrists were strong in the Academy networks, of the union as well as of most re- publics,1 but teaching institutions were not under Marrist control. As pointed out in §0.8, an important linguist like Vinogradov managed to develop his projects and re- ceive official awards for them without having to depend on Marr. Moreover, by the late thirties the Marrists had lost a great deal of their dogmatism. Abaev's prose, quoted in § 0.6, looks aggressive, but may in fact have marked the end of the virulent period: his two modes of existence in a sense implied the possibility of reconciliation of Marrist views with regular empirical research.2 Marr's successor, Meáõaninov, who headed not only the Institute of Language and Thought but also the Section of Literature and Language of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the edito- rial board of the transactions of the Section (the Izvestija AN SSSR, OLUa), seemed to be a moderate man, who tolerated much work that was explicitly or implicitly non- Marrist. The Methodological Bureau of Marr's institute had disappeared without leaving a trace.3 Marr's leading successors had even got rid of his most embarrassing tenets, which had been gradually and surreptitiously moved out of sight.4 In his [1948b] historical survey of Marrism, MeSõaninov openly specified what had disappeared.5 The four el- ements and the origin of language had ended up outside the scope of Marrist re- search. At a 1946 meeting, MeSõaninov had even announced r"a decisive struggle with certain distorting lines in linguistics", such as analysis of Russian words in terms of the four elements, f" which we renounced fifteen years ago".6 The relation between lan- guage and thought was not abandoned and, given the Marxist thesis that social condi- tions determine thought, the theory of stages continued to be a basic tenet. But, in the 1940s, Marrists were less specific as to the nature of the transitions between the stages. Research concentrated on analysis of living and historically fixed languages, 1 But not Georgia, where Cikobava headed the Marr (¿sic) Institute of the Georgian Academy of Sciences. 2 Although a decrease of dogmatic virulence does not necessarily produce a decrease of propensity for musi- cal chairs games. Often, dissenting viewpoints are only tolerated when formulated within the in-group. 3 Neither the Methodological Bureau nor its staff figure in Mesoaninov's [1948b] historical survey of the Institute of Language and Thought. Something like a musical chairs game may have taken place in the early thirties. In a paper called t'A Step Backward", Aptekar' attacked the low Marxist content of MeSöaninov's 1929 survey of Japhetidology. Mesõaninov was accused of vegetarianism [Aptekar' 1929 (3): 2641 and of lagging behind in the fifth stage of development of Japhetidology and ignoring the last, seventh, stage, during which Japhetidology had turned from accidental materialism and dialecticism into conscious application of materialist dialectics [Aptekar' 1929 (3): 265]. On the other hand, the initials of MeSõaninov, who, according to L'Hermitte [1987 (1): 27], avoided personal attacks, feature under a destructive review [Mesõaninov 1934a], called r" Another Step Backward", of Aptekar"s 1933 collection of fragments from Marr. Elsewhere, L'Hermitte [1987 {2' 48, note 2] reports information that Aptekar1, who had orchestrated the ostracism of Polivanov, had shared Polivanov's fate during the purges of the thirties. 4 L'Hermitte 1987 (2): 47-58. 5MeScaninov 1948b: 10-11. 6 Zadaõi 1946: 514.

In a more remote future, the problem of integrating these grammars into a universal grammar, which would comprise all varieties of language, was to present itself. Actual research still comprised two types of activity: the semantic development of words and morphemes, but only in so far as the continuity of their forms was histori- cally attestable, and synchronie syntax and typology. The work on semantic develop- ment was still alarming in so far as it was accompanied by the claim that it expressed general laws in the development of human thought, but restriction of the work to at- tested languages had moved this claim to the background. Abaev's revolutionary élan was only a fraction (more precisely, a quarter) of what it had been twelve years be- fore: fair's] palaeontological studies iètfod) introduce us into a way of thinking in the reality of which we start to believe more and more, the more we become absorbed in the material. Let 75% of Marr's palaeontological etymologies be mistaken: the remaining 25% are sufficient to herald a new phase in the development of theoretical linguistics. * True, in 1948 Abaev still believed that fif it were not for its habitualness and ordinariness in everyday usage, a word like koróva Ccow') should, by its impressive antiquity, bring about in us a more sacred quiver than all the pyramids of Egypt.2 But Abaev's habitualness and ordinariness condition implies that he now accepted that the sacred quiver was not necessarily shared by the rest of mankind. Much of the at- tention of other Marrist linguists had shifted to the semantics of grammatical cate- gories of little-known languages. MeSoaninov's priority within the programme as implied by the theory of stages had shifted away from lexicology and morphology and concentrated on comparison and classification of languages by their syntactic structures; MeSõaninov was particularly interested in systems of expressing the actants of verbs, which included the study of such phenomena as ergativity. MeSoaninov's work in this field is of importance to this day. His arrangement of numerous syntactic data from Eurasian languages renders his later theses on a general typological development which affects the whole of the Eurasian continent rather intriguing.3 MeSoaninov's part of the research programme seems easy to live with for serious linguists. The theory of stages and transitions remained a tricky article of faith but the empirical work on the preliminary universal grammar, which was utopie in itself, would make sure that no specific commitments had to be made before the arrival of communism. The prospect of posterity eventually having to assess the relation be- tween syntactic features in a language and the social system of its speakers was probably less depressing to MeSoaninov's typologists than the idea of simultaneously being funded by the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, and the Eastman Kodak Corpora- tion for working on natural language processing was to American theoretical linguists 1 Abaev 1948: 14. 2 Abaev 1948: 14. 3 W.K. Matthews1 [1950b [5k 97-105] exposition of MeSoaninov's views of the forties is probably the most insightful one in English. MeSoaninov's views cannot be discussed here but seem to be worth a sepa- rate study, which requires a considerable command of his data.</page><page sequence="79">THE CONTEXT 57 in the next decade.1 In both cases, the safest conduct consisted in staying ahead of the commissioners by regularly generating sufficient new material so as to discourage drawing preposterous conclusions but to justify further research. Even the family tree was no longer an absolute taboo among Marrists. Desnickaja proposed re-examining the relations among the Indo-European languages, as well as the problems of their kinship (rodstvo). This term, she hastened to say, was not being used in a biological sense.2 It would thus seem that the vigorous 1950 assaults on the New Teaching on Lan- guage, which exposed its most ludicrous aspects, amounted to beating a dead horse. Correspondingly, the contributions of Marrists in the 1950 Pravda debate were de- fensive and apologetic. They never fully endorsed all of Marr's tenets and they at- tempted to reduce the discussion to the question of whether Marr's theories con- tained elements which could at all be used in the further development of a new Marx- ist linguistics. Neither the subject nor the degree of theoretical disagreement in lin- guistic terms would seem to justify a discussion in Pravda. Apparently paradigmatic controversies within linguistics as such did not account for the scale of the contro- versy. Raskin suggests that the Pravda debate may have resulted from a musical chairs game. Stalin might have been provoked and tempted into this enterprise by a different group of linguists who had grown and matured after Marr and who did not want to tolerate the situation when all the major aca- demic positions in the field were still occupied by Marr's followers, even though Marr himself had been dead for quite some time.3 Girke &amp; Jachnow, on the other hand, assume a paradigmatic struggle.4 They postulate the formation of an anti-Marrist group, which included Vinogradov and Cikobava. The anti-Marrists considered progress in linguistics achievable only when Marrism would be rejected. In view of the official status of Marrism and the political import which was attached to linguistics, only political forces would be able to end the deadlock. The anti-Marrists therefore tried and succeeded in finding themselves a hearing in political circles, which eventually produced the Pravda discussion. Thus, both Raskin and Girke &amp; Jachnow assume an anti-Marrist offensive. L'Hermitte has recently documented some events in the Soviet linguistic community which took place in the period immediately preceding the Pravda discussion. His data prompt rejection of both Raskin's and Girke &amp; Jachnow's reconstructions.5 Together with other events, which were related to the affair in older British and American pub- 1 These organizations supported Chomsky's pioneering work Syntactic Structures: cf.

This shows, incidentally, how little is known about the affair in the Soviet linguistic community of the sixties and seventies, to which Raskin had belonged: one would have expected that the previous history of such a spectacular event would somehow have remained part of the oral history. Two decades later Vinogradov, who had gained most by Stalin's interventioa wondered what had urged Stalin to interfere [1969: 671, but he never answered the question.</page><page sequence="80">58 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER lications,1 and with some findings of the present author, they enable us to cast some light on the initial causes of the debate and develop more detailed hypotheses. First, consider the context of the humanities in the period following the war. It was generally expected that the slight relaxation of Soviet intellectual life immediately preceding the war, and the far-going concessions made during it, would produce a more liberal cultural and scientific climate. But this expectation was not fulfilled. Within the Central Committee A.A. Zdanov took up culture and science again, fields which were considered of great importance. He insisted on ideological vigilance and organized a new wave of repression. He developed a new style of communication, of- ten triggering campaigns by issuing personal injunctions to writers (A.A. Axmatova and MM ZoSõenko), literary journals and theatre organizations, all in 1946. In Febru- ary 1948, A.A. Zdanov personally discovered and exposed the anti-people and formal- ist trend in music as a manifestation of bourgeois influence. D.D. Sostakoviõ and S.S. Prokof'ev were among the accused composers. A.A. Zdanov's action was triggered by his and Stalin's attending V.I Muradeli's opera The Great Friendship.2 The sciences were also re-ideologized, beginning with the social sciences and the humanities. In 1946, a special Academy of Social Sciences to the Central Committee (Akademija obSöestvennyx nauk pri CK KPSS, or AON) was founded, which trained not only higher party cadres but also the staff of the higher education and research insti- tutes and the editors of the scientific journals.3 The trainees of AON would pour into the science system in the decades to come. The political objective of A.A. Zdanov's science policy was to make Soviet science fully self-sufficient. There were two motives for this goal. 1 The first motive was propaganda for the national myth. The revolution had set the conditions for scientifically determined social change: science and scholarship had become important values in Soviet society. With the introduction of socialism in one country, the Soviets had turned into a scientific prophet nation, which must natu- rally have superior theories and discoveries. As Herriot characterized the position of science in Russia, "Soviet rule has bestowed on science all the authority of which it deprived religion".4 2 Vigilance was a second motive: it came up particularly strongly around 1947. In that year Ashby, who spent a year in the Soviet Union in 1945-1946, described Soviet science. The good Soviet scientist has an impressive knowledge of foreign work in his field of research. [...] He is surprisingly internationally minded, considering he has been cut off from nearly all contact with for- eigners and forbidden to travel outside Russia. [...] And he is, without doubt, Britain's keenest ally in our efforts to break down government-imposed barriers and remove government-inspired suspicion in the Soviet Union.5 These good scientists had to be isolated from international science in order to pre- vent the infiltration of attitudes qualified as anti-Soviet. 1 Cf.

The superiority of Soviet sci- ence was guaranteed by three circumstances: outstanding past performance, superior organization, and sophisticated theoretical foundations. 1 As to the achievements of the past, putative and genuine discoveries made by Rus- sian scientists were subject to glorification. A wave of historical claims was launched toward the end of the war, even before A.A. Zdanov was in charge. Rus- sians had invented electric lighting, the parachute, radiotransmission.1 The relation between mass and energy (denoted as "E = MC2") was the theoretical basis of N.N. Lebedev's materialist discovery of the pressure of light in 1899, long before A. Einstein attempted to provide an unjustified idealist foundation for it.2 Many scoops (the mechanical theory of heat, the law of the conservation of mass during chemi- cal change, the vegetable origin of coal, the presence of a dense atmosphere on Venus, the drift of the Arctic Ocean, etc.) were attributed to the eighteenth-cen- tury father of Russian science, Lomonosov.3 Russia was the homeland of the petrol engine, the electric motor, the photo-electric cell, and the helicopter.4 As the jokes went, Soviet watches were the fastest in the world, and Russia was the homeland of the elephants.5 The backwardness of pre-revolutionary Russia and the lack of international fame of its discoverers, which contrasted with the importance of their discoveries, was accounted for not only by the habit of foreigners of claiming Russian discover- ies for themselves, but also by the rigidity of czarist society. Not being capable of putting the discoveries to use, it turned Russia's brightest minds into t" voices crying in the wilderness".6 The cinemas, popular press and history textbooks depicted Russian heroes of science, desperately fighting for the truth and the recognition of their discoveries, but dying anonymous and destitute. Thus, A.S. Popov demon- strated his wireless receiver in 1895. It almost instantly saved 21 fishermen on an ice floe in the Baltic but the Russian state did not want to waste money on it. G. Marconi used Popov's invention in 1897 and tried to establish the claim of having invented it.7 Similarly, as Pankratova reported, P.Ja. Jabloõkov had invented the first arc lamp, which induced the French to refer to electric light as "Russian light". Then A.N. Lodygin produced the first filament lamp. When T.A. Edison and J.W. Swan both claimed to be the first to have invented this lamp, the judge, referring to Lodygin's earlier invention, rejected both claims.8 All this does not imply that the Soviet claims were necessarily unfounded: Ashby, tracing down the Popov claim, 1 Ashby 1947 [Sh 200. 2 Maksimov 1953: 194. 3 Powell 1951: 375, note 1 1. Many such Russian discoveries found their way into the numerous textbooks of technical-scientific Russian, which appeared in the west during the 1960s following the launching of Sputnik. * There are many more examples. The longest list of claimed inventions was found in Buchholz 1953 (1): 11-12. 5 Geller &amp; Nekriõ 1986 {9}. 485; 1982 (9.4): 224. 6 Vavilov 19502: 70. 7 Pankratova 195413 (13.59): 315, SES 1980 (Popov): 1051; (Markoni): 772. 8 Pankratova 1954" (13.59): 314.</page><page sequence="82">60 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER found it to be largely justified.1 Moreover, Ashby sensed that the claims might, in a way, generate their own validity. He presumed, in 1947, that, whatever the degree of truth of Soviet science heroism, it would at least attract into science the bright- est minds in Russia.2 2 The superior organization of Soviet research was the second asset of Russian sci- ence. In his book t Science in the Stalin Era the president of the Academy of Sci- ences, the physicist S.I. Vavilov, enumerated three characteristics which were to distinguish the organization of Soviet science from that of capitalist science: (a) in- crease in scale, (b) research planning, and (c) broad discussions on strategic choices. a S.I. Vavilov clarified the first characteristic, increase in scale, as follows. Science in the capitalist world is in the main individualist in character. [...] The outstanding feature of socialist Soviet science consists in its profound collectiveness. It is our aim that scientific tasks be controlled and regulated collectively, solved collectively, and critically discussed collectively. This in no way goes against the full utilization of all the precious qualities of personal initiative, talent and expe- rience of each and every scientist. It is precisely collectivization which creates the most favourable conditions for scientists to bring their individual capacities and knowledge to light. [...] In the past three decades [...], only by establishing and educating [...] scientific collectives has it become possible to solve gigantic scientific and technical tasks, which would have been inaccessible and impracticable for indi- vidual scientists working in the old-fashioned way, i.e. on their own.** b The second characteristic of Soviet research organization, planning of re- search, was commented on as well. rPlanning of research work has been the next important step in the collectivization of our science. In the capitalist countries the quibble over the question of whether it is possible and expedient to plan sci- entific research is continuing to this day. But our science, our Soviet scientists, have consistently been working according to plans [...] for over two decades. Through planning of scientific research it has been possible to create an "unbroken front" of scientific research, to colour the "blank spaces" which un- planned science, the development of which is determined by personal inclinations and interests, had passed over. Thus, in mathematics we have witnessed a tremendous development of probability theory and the theory of differential equations, as required by [economic] practice.4 Ashby described the results of collectivization and planning of science in the Soviet Union. He compared the diagrams of the organization of science in the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. The diagram for the Soviet Union was streamlined, clear, simple, and disarmingly symmetrical. The di- agram for the United Kingdom resembled nothing so much as the ground plan of an antiquated and complex system of plumbing. [... Uhcritical admirers of a planned economy imagine that in Russia the traffic of science flows really through the planned channels. In my own experience co-ordination of sci- entific effort is not much more evident in Russia than in Britain; and largely for the same reasons, namely that good scientists are individualists: they work best at what interests them and they cannot always predict a year ahead what that will be. In point of fact, organisation and planning are regarded by many Soviet scientists as irritants, which waste time and do not accomplish much effective co-ordina- tion of effort.5 1 Ashby 1947 (8): 198-200. 2 Ashby 1947 (8): 192. 3 Vavilov 1950/19502: 94-95. 4 Vavilov 1950/19502: 95-96. 5 Ashby 1947 (2h 17.</page><page sequence="83">THE CONTEXT 61 [... Tlhere seems to be a great deal of superfluous writing of reports, making of estimates, and book- keeping, in even the best scientific institutes. [...] A good deal of this clerical work revolves around the plan. Each institute has to compose a five-year plan [...] and an annual plan. [...] It is my impression that the plan, so far as pure research is concerned, is more of a nuisance than a benefit. [... Flor most re- search within the Academy the plan is at best a superfluity and at worst an obstruction. The obligation to fulfil an institute's plan is tolerated as a necessary nuisance and (according to gossip) some scientists minimise its effects by slipping one year behind in their reports. Then the director can submit as his plan for 1947 what his institute has in fact already done in 1946. At the end of 1947 he rewrites this plan as his annual report and submits as the 1948 plan what is really the 1947 report. [.... Tlhe idea is a good one, and can be recommended to scientists who have to do business with bureaucrats.1 As Ashby remarked, real co-ordination was not achieved scientists continued to ignore each other's work.2 c S.I. Vavilov described the third aspect of Soviet science policy, discussions on strategic choices within a discipline, as follows: TFinally, broad collective discussion of the basic trends in various disciplines has become extremely important. In the past ten to fifteen years, great ibol'Soj) discussions on fundamental questions have drawn the attention of broad scientific communities and have become pivotal points in the development of a science. Such discussions are different from specialist discussions on specific scientific work [...]. They only deal with great {boVèoj) issues regarding a science across its breadth, its methodology, its organization. They are also characterized by a daringly critical and self-critical approach to the issue.3 This is an important step forward: the great discussions compelled the scientists to acknowledge each other's work. S.I. Vavilov mentioned a few examples. Ex- cept for a pre-war discussion of the physicists, which highlighted the relation- ship between the physical and technical sciences, and a little-known history dis- cussion in 1945, all examples post-dated the 1947 philosophy discussion, which had taken place "on the initiative of the Central Committee". The philosophy dis- cussion ^demonstrated that in no branch of science can research develop suc- cessfully if it is conducted by solitary persons."4 It will be returned to later in this section. S.I. Vavilov's 1950 ideas on collective research, research planning, and broad dis- cussions are remarkably modern.5 S.I. Vavilov himself seems to have lived up to his policy statement: the major scientific feat by which Soviet encyclopaedias remem- ber him is the discovery of the Cerenkov effect: particles which are made to travel in a substance with a speed which exceeds the speed of light in that substance emit radiation. The effect was discovered by P.A. Cerenkov, but under S.I. Vavilov's 1 Ashby 1947 (2): 26-27. 2 Ashbv 1947 (2): 18. 3 Vavilov 1950/19502: 96. For the use of bol'Soi see §0.12. 4 Vavilov 1950/19502: 97. 5 In the Netherlands, systematic efforts to promote collectivization of government-sponsored research were only initiated in the 1970s (cf. Vermeer 1979b (3): 8 and 1979a (1): 29-30). Group work and planning were only imposed as funding conditions for university research in the 1980s: cf. Lock 1989, Blume &amp; Spaapen 1988. The latter, after having investigated the Dutch conditional financing system for six years, communicate the impression "that the system has had some positive effects, even though external evalua- tion failed to select the best research" [Blume &amp; Spaapen 1988: 301. They announce further research of the system, carried out, as always, for the Ministry which introduced it. At present, in the early 1990s, a sys- tem for orchestrating public discussions on strategic trends is being developed. These discussions are to produce conclusions which must legitimize reallocation of research funds between research groups, research themes, and disciplines or parts thereof.</page><page sequence="84">62 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER leadership.1 Apart from that, S.I. Vavilov is remembered as the editor in chief of the second Great Soviet Encyclopaedia from 1949 to 1951, and forgotten as an early translator and popularizer of Einstein's work.2 3 The last circumstance which promoted the superiority of Russian science, its theo- retical foundations, followed naturally from the first and the second. While individ- ual scientists could just follow their hunches and their own interpretations of ear- lier results in deciding which problems to address, collective decisions on strategic choices required a set of criteria, a frame of reference in terms of which plans for the future could be discussed, and objectively compared. The basic set of criteria was obvious: materialist theories, as developed by the Marxist classics, were su- perior to obsolete idealist ones. But the original Marxist theories sometimes lacked specifics. Therefore Soviet scientists were declared the makers of the classics of their respective fields: their teachings were canonized as the only materialist the- ories. The consecration of the psychologist-physiologist I. P. Pavlov (1849-1936) by his pupil K.M. Bykov, during a congress in 1950, is a case in point. In his opening address at the congress S.I. Vavilov explained why canonization of men of genius is a prerequisite for research planning. rPavlov's heirs, his pupils, collaborators, the continuera of his work, are obliged to do everything within their power to develop the genial achievements of their teacher. This requirement is crucial for the correct development of science, especially for the science of a socialist state. We have grown used to planning our scientific research and have mastered the habit. We may not be able to foretell in advance the creative achievements of the Mendeleevs and Pavlovs but, when placing ourselves on the crests of the results of their work, the broadest perspectives lay at our feet and enable us to accomplish a rational planning of our scientific work.3 The canonizing "great discussions" were a ready instrument for securing vigilance against putative infiltration of subversive attitudes into Soviet science. They included orchestrated incidents, campaigns which comprised exemplary assaults on reac- tionary, idealistic, formalist and cosmopolitan trends, followed by accusations di- rected at individuals of a subservient attitude toward the west and of a reconciliatory attitude toward the residues of bourgeois science. Meetings of the relevant sections of the Academy of Sciences produced self-criticism, criticism and ostracism, while disciplinary and organizational measures rounded off the campaigns. Each disciplined discipline founded a militant new journal, the Voprosy ('problems') of the discipline, which was to liquidate shortcomings in the work on the "theoretical front": the journals exposed the emptyness of foreign doctrines and set forth and kept track of the new official viewpoints, which enabled the research institutes in the republics to copy the actions taken on the central level. Whereas before the war purges not infrequently led toward liquidation of the accused scientists, the victims of the post-war campaigns were not necessarily eliminated: they were expelled or marginalized and could serve as scapegoats for future campaigns. 1 Cf.

Mendeleev (1834-1907) was another hero of Russian science.</page><page sequence="85">THE CONTEXT 63 The disciplines with high ideological relevance were tackled first. The history journal Voprosy istorii was founded in 1945, the philosophy journal Voprosy filosofa in 1947, the economics journal Voprosy èkonomiki in early 1948. The 1947 crackdown on philosophy, which was followed by the appearance of Voprosy filosofa, was inaugurated with A.A. Zdanov's public attack on Aleksandrov's 1 History of Western Philosophy.1 This book was intended as the standard textbook of philosophy for use in all institutes of higher education. Reviews in the ideological journals published the main theses and extensively praised it.2 Shortly before A.A. Zdanov's attack on the book, its author, who had previously published on Aristotle,3 had received the Stalin Prize for it.4 Aleksandrov viewed the history of philosophy as a continuous process of accumu- lation of ideas and insights, dislodging and generating each other, produced by indi- viduals. The thinkers proceeded by trial and error and were subject to the limitations imposed by their societies, but they nevertheless shared the intention to reveal the truth. They contributed to the construction of a single philosophical edifice. This Werdegang finally culminated in Marxism,5 which crystallized around materialist seeds which had been sown, to start with, by such ancient philosophers as Democri- tus, popularly described as the inventor of the atom.6 Of course Russian thinkers made a valuable contribution, especially in their opposition to German idealism,7 but the significance of the Soviet contribution to the development of materialism through the Tadzhik philosopher Avicenna (980-1037) was not neglected.8 The problem of determinism and free will was treated when dealing with St Augustine, who was con- sidered to get stranded in his own contradictions.9 But the problem of determinism also returned on a meta-level, i.e. applied to philosophy itself. Philosophy being a su- perstructure category, the deterministic tenet that each society and each class pro- duces its own philosophy was subscribed to. Capitalism conditioned the development of the natural sciences, which in turn rendered possible the development of a mate- rialist, scientific philosophy. On the other hand, it was pointed out that Ht would be a vulgarization and a gross distortion of materialism if we would embark on the path of stamping and labelling philosophical systems and thinkers by limiting ourselves to establishing their "class affiliation". As comrade Aleksandrov writes, "Marxism-Leninism requires a critical attitude toward the philosophical development of the past, it requires an exact analysis of the historical merits for sci- 1 Aleksandrov 19462. 2 E.g.

It may be added that the vulgar approach which was criticized by Aleksandrov and his associates would also reduce men of genius, such as Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, to anonymous instruments of history. A.A. Zdanov participated in a philosophers' conference on the book, which lasted for days. In his speech,2 he accused Aleksandrov of grave errors. A.A. Zdanov op- posed presenting all of philosophy as an elitist enterprise of solitary men and their disciples, isolated from the outside world, detached from life and the people: in Alek- sandrov's conception, A.A. 2danov pointed out, Marxism was inevitably classified as just another school.3 Aleksandrov's approach would even degrade Marxism to the status of a regional school, an offspring of West European philosophy.4 In A.A. Zdanov's conception, on the other hand, Marxism was considered to negate all pre- ceding philosophy and to produce a new universal quality.5 (Apparently the "genius" of Marx, Engels, etc. consisted in their being the only thinkers to break away from the fetters of class determination.6) While philosophy had grown more and more into a museum as the natural and social sciences moved away from it and developed into "positive" sciences,7 Marx and Engels converted philosophy itself into a science:8 their historical laws offered a scientific instrument for the cognition of reality, and made philosophy a weapon in the hands of the proletarian masses in their struggle for emancipation.9 Therefore a Soviet philosophy textbook should not stop, like Alek- sandrov's book in 1848, with the arrival of Marxism.10 On the contrary: while there was no point in adopting a subservient attitude toward obsolete bourgeois ideas and exaggerating their significance for Marxism,11 it was of utmost importance to combat contemporary deviations, systems of thought which, by virtue of their contemporari- ness with Marxism, refused to see the light and therefore had to be characterized as its foes. 1 VySinskij 1946: 67; Aleksandrov 19462 (vvedenie): 14. 2 2danov, A.A., 1947; 2danov, A.A., 19502c is a French translation. 3 2danov, A.A., 19502c: 50. 4 2danov, A.A., 19502c: 51-52. 5 2danov, A.A., 19502c: 51. 6 As Bogdanov [1924: 210] puts it, f"Marx was not a worker; the power of his mind enabled him fully to transpose himself into the position of a worker". Van het Reve [1954 (3): 49] points to the friction between this statement and Bogdanov's repetition, on the same page, of the Marxist thesis that economic position determines thought. Only postulating people of genius, as transcending the laws of class determinism, pre- sents a way out. The next question then is how and to whom genius status is assigned. The personality cult discussion, as a communist dilemma, essentially dealt with the question of whether to declare the set of geniuses open or closed. The experience of Stalinism showing that allowing for new geniuses is unsafe for the ruling class itself, Soviet communism inevitably headed toward canonization of a closed set of classic truths. 7 2danov, A.A., 19502c: 49. 8 2danov, A.A., 19502c: 46. 9 2danov, A.A.. 19502c: 51. 10 2danov, A.A., 19502c: 51-52. 11 2danov, A.A., 19502c: 55.</page><page sequence="87">THE CONTEXT 65 tThis is particularly the case with neo-Kantianism, theology, old and new forms of agnosticism, at- tempts to smuggle God back into the contemporary natural sciences, and all the other soup kitchens aiming to camouflage and dress up their soiled metaphysical merchandise according to the requirements of the market.1 A.A. Zdanov pointed out that Aleksandrov, by his "objectivist" method of paying tribute to the merits of even the least significant bourgeois philosopher before balancing them against any negative aspects,2 and of presenting ideas as self-contained entities instead of relating them to the class and material conditions of the period which pro- duced them, opened the door to the idealist conception of the independence of ideas, ignoring the Marxist thesis that the reactionary or progressive character of an idea or system depends on the concrete historical circumstances.3 Although paying lip service to the Marxist discovery that the socio-economic context conditions the de- velopment of philosophy, Aleksandrov failed to corroborate it in his exposition. A.A. Zdanov proceeded to expose Aleksandrov's poor craftmanship. While Alek- sandrov illustrates the backwardness of late 18th-century Germany by pointing to its urban population of less than 25%, A.A. Zdanov pointed out that France, the most pro- gressive country of that period, had an urban population of only 10%.4 Similarly, A.A. Zdanov with remarkable preciseness demonstrated Aleksandrov's failure to under- stand the scientific basis of Marxism: a few quotations revealed a thorough incompre- hension of the nature and significance of the scientific laws (cellular structure of or- ganisms, conservation of energy, natural selection) which were supposed to have in- spired the laws of Marxism.5 Finally, A.A. Zdanov comments on Aleksandrov's style. His "detached", "neutral", "professorial", "pseudo-objectivist", "contemplative and passive" "academicism"6 was said to produce a cold and indifferent exposition of the facts.7 Instead of preparing the intellectuals for a merciless struggle against the idealist enemy, Aleksandrov pre- sented himself as a toothless propagandist of vegetarianism".8 A.A. Zdanov concluded that the production of a canonical militant philosophy text- book was beyond the capacities of a single man and should be produced by multidis- ciplinary collective teamwork.9 Similarly, philosophical research should no longer be the task of isolated small groups in the centre. The whole philosophical front, which at present looked like a bivouac, remote from the battle-field,10 was to be mobilized for a broad ideological struggle. For lack of class struggle within a socialist society, progress was to be ensured by means of criticism and self-criticism.11 This was the programme for the philosophical front during the years to follow. 1 2danov, A.A., 19502c: 56. 2 Zdanov.

Zdanov's intervention did not immediately produce overall vigi- lance. The new journal Voprosy filosofa was edited by B.M. Kedrov, who had vehe- mently attacked Aleksandrov in the preceding debates,1 but the first few issues con- tained some relatively unorthodox papers on the philosophy of the natural sciences, and trigger comparatively open and innovative discussions on such subjects as quan- tum mechanics, whose relationship to dialectical materialism was a sensitive issue.2 But in the course of 1948, after Kedrov's replacement, the journal admitted having made serious mistakes by allowing papers deviating from dialectical materialism "in the direction of idealism and agnosticism", and restricted itself to publishing the more straightforward material which one would expect from it. In linguistics, after some skirmishes at a 1946 meeting,3 a campaign started in the spring of 1948, just before the well-known Lysenko incident in biology. But, whereas biology was soon put on the right track, numerous sessions and resolutions were re- quired to discipline the linguists. A first series of sessions was heralded by a paper from Kacnel'son in Izvestija AN SSSR, OLiJa in early 1948. Vinogradov was accused of having attacked A.A. Potebnja's (not Marr's) theory of development by stages, and of proposing to study individual facts and items while hoping to end up with the generalities, instead of using a theory which tells one which facts and items to look for.4 But in the next issue of Izvestija AN SSSR, OLiJa Cikobava published a paper on ergativity in which stages were said to be useful as an inductive concept, but not as an a priori? while Bulaxovskij published a paper on Slavic bird names in which the concept of ancestral language was used.6 The September edition of Izvestija AN SSSR, OLiJa, which must have gone to press a few months earlier, shows that things were changing. It contains a contribution from the unknown Reznikov7 against agnosticism (t'one of the most reactionary (reakcion- nejSij) forms of philosophical idealism"8) in linguistics. Reznikov referred to A.A. 2da- nov's recent interference in philosophy, attacked the "idealist" view of language as a system of signs, which had been developed by such bourgeois theorists as Aristotle, R.Carnap, E.A. Cassirer, Russell and Saussure, and was, "unfortunately", subscribed to by the Soviet psychologist Vygotskij and the linguist Cikobava.9 The September edition also contained a report on the sessions of June 1948, during which the Section of Literature and Language of the Academy of Sciences evaluates the work of Izvestija AN SSSR, OLiJa.10 There, the editor (MeSõaninov) was criticized, with reference to decisions of the Central Committee and to A.A. Zdanov's injunctions 1 Wetter 1952 (2.1.5): 298. 2 Graham 1973n (3): 74-80. 3 Zadaõi 1946; an English account is given in Ellis &amp; Davies 1951 (4&gt;. 224-225. 4 Kacnel'son 1948: 94-95.

As far as the present writer is aware, Vygotskij (1896-1934), a celebrated theorist on thought and language (cf. Vygotskij 1962, the original of which appeared in 1934 and shows no awareness of Marrism), is all but ignored by all parties throughout the history of Soviet linguistic debate. 10 Obsuidenie 1948, Oõerednye 1948; L'Hermitte 1987 12k 58.</page><page sequence="89">THE CONTEXT 67 on philosophy, for lack of militancy in propagating and imposing his ideas, for publishing structuralist work from the newly democratic countries (viz. Belie 1946 and Kurytowicz 1946) without comment, and for having failed to discuss Vinogradov's dubious work on Russian. (The subtitle of Vinogradov's award-winning book on Rus- sian, Uõenie o slove ('teaching on the word'),1 could, by its use of the term teaching, and by positing the word as the central unit instead of MeSoaninov's larger syntactic structures or Marr's submorphemic elements, be interpreted as defying the New Teaching on Language.2) The keenest accuser, the orientalist G.P. Serdjuõenko, even reproached Meáõaninov with having printed Kacnel'son's earlier attack on Vino- gradov in brevier (petit).3 In August 1948, the famous biology sessions took place in the Academy of Agricul- tural Sciences; here Lysenko, when meeting with opposition on the part of the genet- icists, surprised the biologists with explicit support from the Central Committee, and proclaimed his violent struggle against bourgeois science. In the autumn of 1948, an instruction from the top of the Academy of Sciences triggered a new series of sessions in linguistics, which was introduced by reports from MeSõaninov and Filin,4 and involved the Academy linguistics institutes in Leningrad and Moscow (including those for Russian, but not the Institute of Slavic Studies). L'Hermitte provides an extensive account of these sessions.5 Reference was made to the situation in biology; Filin's report was a paraphrase of Lysenko's argument, while the title of MeSoaninov's paper was identical with that of Lysenko's report of August 1950 but for the substitution of linguistics for biology. Marr's forgotten tenets were reiterated. The accusations were more vehement now, especially from Filin and Serdjuõenko, and were personally directed at foremost linguists, such as Vinogradov, P.S. Kuznecov, and Cikobava, who turned out not only to be reactionary defendants of both old bourgeois theories and foreign tendencies, such as Saussureanism and structuralism, but also to have been caught infecting the schools with teachings hos- tile to Soviet linguistics. Vinogradov's celebrated book on Russian [19722] was qualified as a collection of jokes and winged words for mass consumption iSirpotreb) trying to pass for science.6 During the sessions, people took turns in delivering declarations of criticism and self-criticism; the accused could choose between being convinced and being convicted. Two linguists refused to repent: Peterson and P.S. Kuznecov.7 Ciko- bava just stayed in Georgia. The Academy institutes and the Bureau of the Section of Literature and Language passed resolutions which referred to the lessons learnt from the biology events, ranked foremost Soviet linguists according to their degree of anti-Marrism, and in- sisted on vigilance on the part of the directors.8 The new militancy was reflected in the articles in Izvestija AN SSSR, OLiJa but was mainly directed at foreign linguists 1 I.e.

Sturtevant of publishing in the service of imperialism1), and, of course, at Russian emigré structuralists and former Soviet formalists, such as Jakob- son and Trubeckoj.2 A third series of sessions took place in January and February of 1949,3 following the January session of the Academy of Sciences, which was dedicated to the struggle to affirm Russian science's primacy in discoveries.4 The ritual was more or less re- peated. Some new accused were added to the list and some of the repentance was more specific. But the impact of the sessions seemed to be small. Vinogradov, for example, recognized his errors, acknowledged that Marr's teaching had helped him to find the right way, and promised a radical revision of Vinogradov 19722.5 But, at the same time and in the same journal, Vinogradov published a 29-page most un-Marrist glorification of PuSkin as the founder of the Russian literary language.6 A few articles on "the unsatisfactory situation in linguistics" appeared in the non- specialist press in early 1949, but in May an article in the journal Kul'tura i zizrí ('culture and life'), signed by two new names, Bernikov &amp; Braginskij, introduced a new element. Bernikov &amp; Braginskij repeated the familiar accusations directed against the racist Indo-Europeanists and the followers of the liberal bourgeois pre-revolutionary linguists, but this time even Marrists were observed to "slip down" to bourgeois posi- tions and to be ^engaged in abstruse philologizing, which is needed by no one (zaumnoe i nikomu ne nuznoe filologizirovanie), on petty and minute problems of lin- guistic form".7 Bernikov &amp; Braginskij's article was frequently referred to in a fourth series of sessions, which started immediately after its publication and turned into a denunciation festival. Space does not permit a detailed description of the growing tension and drama which was manifest in the reports published in Izvestija AN SSSR, OLiJaß Reports were written and read in which Marrists not only denounced their non-Marrist colleagues but went out of their way to accuse each other of heresy, le- niency, and making common cause with foreign linguists. The most fanatic Marrists of the preceding sessions, including Desnickaja, were now themselves targets of sharp attacks.9 MeSõaninov kept a low profile and attempted to keep at least Marr's four el- ements under the carpet.10 Serdjuõenko (who had rediscovered Polivanov, calling him 1 Desnickaia 1949a. 2 Desnickaia 1949b. 3 Naudnaja 1949, V moskovskom 1949a. 4 Geller &amp; Nekriõ 1986 (9): 484; 1982 (9.4): 224. 5 V moskovskom 1949a: 276. 6 Vinoeradov 1949. 7 Bernikov &amp; Braginskij 1949.

Im- mediately after her untimely 1948 paper on Indo-European kinship she was one of the staunchest denuncia- tors in the (1948) discussions. But her faux pas caught up with her in Bernikov &amp; Braginskij's paper. In the fifties she turned to kinship again (cf. Desnickaja 1955), and became an avowed enemy of Marr [Kiparsky 1963: 98] when other linguists were trying to forget. Her permanent specialty was revealing the reactionary nature of foreign theories. 10 MeSöaninov 1949: 295.</page><page sequence="91">THE CONTEXT 69 an inveterate reactionary idealist1) was on the offensive. He reiterated the impor- tance of element analysis (even if he conceded that the exact number of elements could be subject to discussion),2 condemned just about every Soviet linguist except Budagov and Filin, and agreed with Bernikov &amp; Braginskij 's accusations of formalism in MeSoaninov's recent work.3 Finally, the participants adopted resolutions in which long series of linguists were accused of having committed specific ideological crimes, such as activating trends hostile to materialist linguistics, propagating the superiority of isolating languages (such as English) to inflecting languages (such as Russian), at- tempting to resuscitate the reactionary theory of the ancestral language, making pro- paganda for racist theories, etc. Such antipatriotic behaviour was condemned, and the leadership of the institutes was urged to do better.4 The campaign in KuVtura i ïizn' was continued with an article from Serdjuõenko and grateful reports on the Moscow and Leningrad sessions.5 In July of 1949, the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences issued a decree6 in which the accusations were repeated once more, and the culprits were classified again. It was concluded that Soviet linguistics had lacked leadership. The editors of ¡zvestija AN SSSR, OLiJa, who were accused of having admitted propaganda hostile to the New Teaching on Language, and of having acted as detached onlookers by publishing the recent debates without comment, were to be replaced; the publishing of Marr's complete works, which had apparently been interrupted after the disappear- ance of Aptekar' in the thirties, was to be resumed; various new programmes, con- gresses and editions of Marr-related publicatons were announced, especially di- rected at promulgation of Marr's theories in broader areas of public life, such as edu- cation. Organizational measures were taken in order to promote a joint solution of common problems by the Section of Literature and Language and the Section of His- tory and Philosophy. A committee was installed to co-ordinate the execution of all Marr activities. In the committee, which was chaired by the president of the Academy of Sciences S.I. Vavilov, linguists were a minority. MeSõaninov was one of the vice- presidents, Serdjuõenko the secretary. The edition of the Izvestija AN SSSR, OLiJa which contains the reports of the ses- sions and the decree only appeared toward the end of 1949, when the execution of some of the decisions taken was overdue: the promises kept were the publication of a revised (i.e. even more militant) edition of Mixankova's hagiography of Marr,7 and Budagov's ideological paper, which was to illuminate, once and for all, the firm Marx- 1 Serdjucenko 1949b: 301. 2 Serdjuõenko 1949b: 309. 3 Serdjuõenko 1949b: 320. 4 Rezoljucija 1949c, Rezoljucija 1949d. 5 Serdiuõenko 1949a, Za peredovoe 1949a, Za peredovoe 1949b. 6 Iz postanovlenija 1949. 7 Mixankova's 1935 book on Marr had been re-issued in 1948; the text was thoroughly updated for the much longer 1949 deluxe edition. In the new edition all evil was personified. While in Mixankova 19482 (6): 394 the attacks on Man around 1930 were anonymous it is now noted that they were written by Pe- terson [Mixankova 1949s (6&gt;. 4551.

Although insisting on the basic tenets concerning the relation between language, thought and society, he mentioned Marr only once. Then Izvestija AN SSSR, OLiJa ceased to appear, until after the Pravda discussion. L'Hermitte supposes that, long before the 1950 discussion, the new offensive of the Marrists had lost momentum.2 It is on this crucial period that information is scarce. Here indirect information must be turned to in order to reduce our uncertainty. As a first step, the source of the Marrist offensive must be found. There are sev- eral indications that the offensive was not initiated and sustained by the Marrists themselves. Every new phase was triggered by outsiders, non-linguists, while the 1949 Academy decree seemed to place all of linguistics under tutelage. A possible indication of the origin of the pressure is the report of a session (the "Marr Anniversary Session") which took place in January 1950.3 The proceedings drew the attention of contemporary American Soviet watchers: an English translation appeared in Murra &amp; al. 195 1.4 The session brings in a few new elements. The company included hard-core Marrists of the older generation and a consider- able number of linguists from the republics. Filin and Budagov did not participate. No obvious scapegoats were present. Three leading Marrists, viz. MeSõaninov, Ser- djuõenko and N.S. Cemodanov, reiterated Marr's theses, including the tenets which had long been abandoned, such as the ones on the glottogonie process,5 and added a dose of anti-western rhetoric. The following fragment from Cemodanov's report is characteristic. Hitler's fascism tried a broader use [...] of the antiquated concept of Indo-Germanic racial superiority, but failed in the attempt. Today, with the same aims, Anglo-American imperialism uses the contemporary Saussure and other neo-idealist schools for their propaganda of the notorious cosmopolitan theory of the superiority of analytical over inflected languages. This pseudo "theory" is used as a theoretical foun- dation for Anglo- American racism and contrasts the Western European peoples, as allegedly "chosen", to the remainder of the world and in particular to the people's democracies and the Soviet Union. [...] The link between bourgeois linguistics and cosmopolitan propaganda proves what sort of filthy, selfish in- terests are concealed behind the abstract arguments on the structure of languages in the articles of con- temporary bourgeois linguistics.^ The leaders of the Institute of Language and Thought complained that Marr's teach- ings are not taken seriously. Even Abaev was accused of inadmissible attempts to reconcile progressive, materialist linguistics with traditional bourgeois notions.7 Georgian Marrists exposed the idealist views of Cikobava, and provided a detailed account of the struggle which was being waged against the opponents of Marr's 1 Budagov 1949. 2 L'Hermitte 1987 (2): 67. 3 Spirkin 1949. 4 Spirkin 1951a.

Attempts to discredit or to ignore Marr's new linguistics, which is a brilliant example of the applica- tion of Marxism-Leninism to the study of language, repeat, in essence, similar attempts by Weisman- ists and Morganists to discredit and discard the materialist research of Miöurin and Lysenko.2 Lysenko himself seems to have take part in the discussion. He was referred to as "Comrade Lysenko (Ukraine)", without his initials (T.D.):3 since he was chaperoned by a Comrade Belov, while the philosopher P.T. Belov was another participant in the biol- ogy discussion,4 it is unlikely that we are dealing with a namesake. Besides Belov, several representatives of the Institute of Philosophy attended the meeting. The outsiders at the meeting were not satisfied: their thumbs went down after each account. MeSõaninov did not indicate further prospects for developing linguistics and failed to disclose the reasons for the unsatisfactory situation on the linguistics front;5 Serdjuõenko did not succeed in showing what work had been done on several theoret- ical questions since Marr's death.6 According to Lysenko, questions of language teaching in the schools were quite insufficiently dealt with, while theoretical work was poor.7 The philosophers complained that recent Marrist expositions of Marr's work contradicted the essence of his teaching, were theoretically defective, and po- litically harmful. They insisted on the investigation of the connection between Marr's teaching and Pavlov's teaching on the second signal system (without minding that this might make them end up in another decadent American paradigm: behaviourism). "Lan- guage must be regarded as a reflection of reality. This is fully applicable both to se- mantics and syntax."8 Another critic pointed out that the present session had seen no truly Bolshevist, uncompromising criticism of the enemies of Marr's teaching, and that the reports had given an impression of uncertainty and hesitancy in defending Marr's doctrine. It was insisted that Marr's element analysis is essential and could not simply be omitted.9 The proceedings of the session were accompanied by an anonymous editorial, which observed that: there are major shortcomings in the field of linguistics. [...] Research work and textbooks on the Russian language make entirely insufficient use of Marr's basic postulates on language. [...] The Institute of Lan- guage and Thought was unable to present a single report throwing light on the basic theoretical ques- tions of Marr's teaching. A number of theoretical reports delivered at the session did not give a suffi- ciently profound analysis of the ideological wealth of the teaching of the inspired Soviet scientist N.Ja. Marr. [...] The session failed to pose the most important theoretical problems of materialist linguistics - the problem of stages in the development of language, form and content in language, language and 1 Spirkin 1951a: 6; 1949: 6. 2Spirkin 1951a: 4; 1949:331. 3 Soirkin 1951a: 6: 1949: 333. 4 Cf.. for example.

[...] By way of self-criticism, it must be admitted that Soviet philosophers, especially in the Institute of Philosophy of the USSR Academy of Sciences and on the [f journal] Voprosy filosofa have not yet given real help to linguists in solving pressing prob- lems of Soviet linguistics. [...] The need has arisen for the establishment of a special agency to throw much light on the [...] work of all linguistic institutions of the Soviet Union. [... Wie must have more principled, Bolshevist criticism and self-criticism, which will make it possible to end the covert and overt attacks on Marr L.U The report was not for a linguistic audience, but appeared in Voprosy filosofa, the militant journal of the philosophers. Its author, Spirkin, was a philosopher who, in that period, published on the deterministic physiologist Pavlov.2 Spirkin was to reappear in the linguistics debate of the mid sixties. In 1966 P.S. Kuznecov, one of the most prin- cipled victims of the 1949 attacks, reported on a 1965 seminar on language and thought, where Spirkin called Marr a scholar of genius, whose views had been wrong- fully criticized in 1950.3 The 1949 issue of Voprosy filosofa which contains Spirkin's report was published with a year's delay, viz. in April 1950, just before the Pravda de- bate.4 Spirkin was not the only philosopher to meddle in linguistics. Reznikov, who had triggered the first Marrist offensive with his 1948 paper on agnosticism in linguistics, had already published on the same subject in Voprosy filosofa,5 and would later gain a certain renown in the west with Marxist philosophical work on semiotics.6 It seems likely that philosophers, from the Institute of Philosophy or from the Academy Section of History and Philosophy, had a hand in orchestrating the linguistics campaign: Ly- senko had also received "methodological" support, from the philosopher I.I. Prezent.7 It must be kept in mind that, in the Soviet Union of the period, the development of propaganda (at least for the more sophisticated target groups) occupied a central position in the mission of this discipline. It was no coincidence that A.A. Zdanov had personally triggered the 1947 philosophy debate: the philosophers provided the key to the other sciences. There are more indications that instructions for the Marrist campaign came from outside. The journal Kul'tura i ¿izn' ('culture and life'), which contained Bernikov &amp; Braginskij's article, was published by Agitprop, the department of agitation and pro- 1 Cf.

Spirkin was also one of the critics [1952] of Saumjan's 1952a attempt to give a fair treatment to structuralist phonology. Spirkin would publish on the relation between thought and language [e.g. 19571 and on Marxist philosophy. He was also co-editor of a multi-volume philosophical dictionary and of a dictionary of foreign words. One linguist was to continue citing Spirkin's psychological work: Bu- dagov. Cf.

Zdanov's favourite disciplines: literature, theatre, music, philosophy and history. In 1949 even his recent creations, such as the militant journals Voprosy filosofa and Vo- prosy istorii, were subject to various incriminations. After the Pravda discussion, outside involvement in the Marrist offensive was even publicly talked about. Cikobava (in his finest hour, immediately after the Pravda dis- cussion, accusing the converted Marrists of careerism and lack of principles, and ob- serving that the only Marxist linguistics textbook in the Soviet Union now happened to be written in Georgian2) emphasized the active involvement of the Ministry of Higher Education in promoting the Marrist offensive.3 Lysenko's presence and the active involvement of philosophers of science in the process suggest that there were more points of contact between the Lysenko affair and the intended canonization of Marr's teachings than just structural similarity be- tween Marr's and Lysenko's teachings. It is interesting to examine the differences between the biology affair and the linguistics affair. A major difference was the absence of a linguistics Lysenko. The proceedings of the 1948 sessions show that Meáõaninov, having been Marr's closest associate and his "legitimate" heir as the nadal'nik of linguistics, was the obvious candidate. But, as the proceedings of all meetings show, he adopted an extremely passive attitude. He was always ready to expound and explain Marr's views, to demonstrate that he knew them better than anyone else; he was always ready to denounce dead and foreign linguists, and to welcome and assist non-Marrist linguists joining the Marrist ranks.4 But he did not take specific action against anybody. Meáõaninov sought to be the middle man until the very end. In his contribution to the Pravda discussion, five attitudes with re- spect to element analysis were distinguished:5 1 Element analysis is to be radically rejected. 2 The four elements are a great discovery but element analysis cannot be applied. 3 Element analysis can only be applied to unattested stages of language. 4 Element analysis can be applied to fragments of known languages (such as to- ponyms). 5 Element analysis is entirely applicable and useful in both older and contemporary stages. 1 Kul'tura i ¿izn' appeared from July 1946 to February 1951 and is not to be confused with the homony- mous journal which was founded in 1957 and served to promote international cultural ties. 2 Cikobava 1950: 96. 3 Cikobava 1950: 95; see also Vsesojuznoe 1950: 145. 4 In MeSéaninov 1948a: 483, the Finno-Ugrian specialist D.V. Bubrix and a few others were welcomed, but this did not safeguard them against subsequent Marrist attacks. Kiparsky [1957: 88] blames Bubrix's death in 1949 on these attacks; in Senke viõ-Gudkova 1950, which appeared immediately after the Pravda discus- sion and commemorated Bubrix, it was pointed out that Filin's and Serdjuoenko's accusations of Bubrix's believing in the ancestral language were based on their ignorance of his work as Bubrix actually was a gen- uine Marrist. 5 MeSöaninov 1951: 26. The analysis and arrangement of the viewpoints is provided in Dupas 1977 (2A&gt;. 51.</page><page sequence="96">74 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER MeSõaninov himself subscribed to viewpoint 3. He attributed viewpoint 1 to Cikobava, viewpoint 2 to L.V. Sõerba (who died in 1944), viewpoint 4 to Filin, and viewpoint 5 to I.D. Dmitriev-Kel'da, a little-known Marrist1 (instead of to Serdjuõenko, who had re- cently expressed it2). This is not the stuff Lysenkos were made of. Lysenko had always been in the ideological frontline. Stalin had met Lysenko in 1935, when, during the collectivization of Soviet agriculture, the kulaks were presumed to be undermining Soviet power. At a congress, in Stalin's presence, Lysenko had proposed to dispose of the 'kulaks of science" and had been bravoed by Stalin.3 This had marked the start of his career in edinonadalie, during which he would never show any scruples. For ex- ample, Lysenko's major opponent in the 1930s, the foremost geneticist N.I. Vavilov, was arrested in 1940 during field work, and died in prison in 1943.4 MeSõaninov, al- though owing his position to Marr's lobbying, had always wanted to be a proper scien- tist: his publications, however influenced by Marr's teachings they may have been, had always carried the stamp of a craftsman. As a person, he was of little propagan- dists use. We may ask why Meâõaninov was not replaced. His behaviour in the forties, as the editor of Izvestija AN SSSR, OLiJa, presented a more than suitable case for accusing him of a subservient attitude to foreign doctrines, a reconciliatory attitude to bour- geois idealism, and lack of vigilance and leadership. Also, in several places, such as his 1948b historical survey cited above, he had shown himself untrue to Marrism. Ea- ger Marrists, such as Serdjuõenko and Filin, would have seemed to be sufficiently qualified to replace MeSõaninov. His only asset was his membership of the Academy of Sciences (which Marr had pushed through in the early thirties). But Filin, Budagov and Serdjuõenko had a problem of rhetoric. MeSoaninov's hold- ing the key to Marr's legacy presented an obstacle to Marr's canonization. The young Marrists should, on the one hand, accuse MeSõaninov of insufficient Marrism. For this they needed a revival of element analysis and other absurdities rejected by MeSõani- nov. On the other hand, they could never match MeSoaninov's incredible knowledge of the jungle of Marr's theories. By this excess of Marrism, MeSõaninov blocked the construction of a self-consistent, canonical grand design. Budagov's 1949 paper on Lenin and the ideological foundations of linguistics may be viewed as an attempt to by-pass MeSõaninov by creating a canonized version of Marrism without Marr. This double strategy may not have appealed to the philosophers. The linguistics campaign seems to have been poorly managed from outside. In the summer of 1948, Lysenko's take-over was explicitly and publicly supported by the Central Committee. In the autumn of 1948, there was nothing of this for linguistics. Pressure on the linguists increased only gradually. A.A. Zdanov died on August 31, 1948. As his interventions in literature, music, and philosophy demonstrate, was per- sonally involved in his reideologization campaigns. We may assume that after his death there was a lull in such activities until his successor had found out what was 1 Dmitriev-Kel'da can be retraced to the Russian (not Soviet) Academy of Pedagogical Sciences, and would turn out to be a stubborn and principled suooorter of Marr's views even after Stalin's intervention. 2 Serdiucenko 1949b: 309-310. 3 Geller &amp; Nekriõ 1986 (9): 482; 1982 (9.4): 221. 4 Medvedev 1969 {31 67-75.</page><page sequence="97">THE CONTEXT 75 going on and made up his mind about his own style. In the meantime crucial decisions, such as replacing the man who was intended to become the Lysenko of linguistics, could not be taken. This may explain the loss of momentum. In 1949 references to A.A. Zdanov were replaced by references to V.M. Molotov,1 but Molotov was losing power at the time. In 1949, although staying on the Central Comittee, he was replaced as foreign minister.2 Around that time, his wife was deported, accused of belonging to the "Zionist centre".3 Apparently, the linguistics campaign was continued as an autonomous process, guided from outside but not by top people. S 0.10 Elements for a reconstruction of the Prâvda debate The present section attempts to provide a reconstruction of the linguistics affair which at times goes beyond the established facts. On the basis of the available evi- dence the assumptions presented below are plausible but they cannot be fully corrob- orated: this would require further research. Since the available reconstructions and explanations are also incomplete in a number of ways, presenting new hypotheses is justified as an instrument in finding out the truth. When a great deal of power is concentrated at the top, management is necessarily decision-intensive: the amount of time and attention per decision is small. Conse- quently, decisions tend to be made without arguments, explanation or reference to underlying principles. The task of providing the arguments and converting the deci- sions into a more or less consistent framework is delegated to a lower echelon. In this situation, bureaucrats survive and make careers by devising theories on the be- haviour of the top, theories which provide an explanation for the decisions taken and predict future decisions. These theories serve as conceptual frameworks for eluci- dating the decisions to the world outside, as guidelines for making analogous decisions at a lower level, and as ammunition in internecine bureaucratic struggles. This prac- tice tends to be preserved as a cultural feature within an organization even when the intensity of decision making at the top decreases. The top may reserve time, network- ing and energy for detailed decisions on minor issues without feeling obliged to com- municate explicitly its motives to the bureaucratic hierarchy. Such a situation is likely to have existed in the post-war Stalin period. Typically, the various phases of the linguistics campaigns commenced with "studying the lessons" of the campaigns which involved the top, i.e. devising theories which enabled the poli- cy makers on lower levels to extrapolate the consequences of the events for their own position and decide on the safest or most profitable behaviour. Thus, in the period between June 1947 and August 1948, A.A. Zdanov's philosophy intervention was presented as the model for the reorganization of the sciences. A group of young philosophers of science including Reznikov tackled the neighbouring disciplines in a more or less planned process. This group may have been associated with A.A. Zdanov's son Ju.A. Zdanov, who after the war had become the head of the 1 E.g.

Ju.A. Zdanov, born in 1919, was a chemist who in 1948 completed a thesis at the Institute of Philosophy on the philosophical significance of homologous compounds, a subject that had once interested Engels.1 The Lysenko incident of August 1948 produced a new state of affairs to be studied. The conclusions were drawn at the January 1949 session of the Academy of Sciences, which was organized to assess the implications of the affair. The scientific bureau- crats of the Academy of Sciences developed a theory on what the top expected of them. The confirmation of Russian priorities and Soviet supremacy in science became a central policy goal.2 The Soviet annexation of science was planned, in an analogy with the annexation of history and literature which was described in §0.8. A shift of emphasis took place with respect to the earlier policy lines: whereas A.A. Zdanov's campaigns concentrated on ideology, vigilance and xenophobia, the post-Lysenko campaigns emphasized Soviet superiority, which required an increasing tolerance of spurious theories. In this period, a grand design of a Soviet scientific world outlook was being devel- oped, imposed on the disciplines by means of massive congresses, which were pre- pared and coached by philosophers. The congresses served to proclaim and canonize heroes of Soviet science, and to oust their opponents and false disciples. The great Pavlov congress of 1950, where Pavlov was canonized and the preparation of which apparently involved Spirkin, is a case in point. The project was well prepared: a film on Pavlov was produced in 1949, a collection of his works published, and Ju.A. Zdanov himself wrote a long article on Pavlov and his work in Kul'tura i ¿izn' while exposing many foreign and some Soviet psychologists as idealists.3 The congress itself was at- tended by 1400 Soviet physiologists, medical scientists, psychologists, philosophers, etc.4 Bykov was presented as Pavlov's only true heir, and a considerable number of eminent researchers were branded capitalist agents, and the like, and removed from their positions. The Pavlov conference was opened by Academy president S.I. Vavilov, and was extensively covered by the media. The conclusions were presented in Pravda by Ju.A. Zdanov. At the time, the latter was a member of the powerful Secretariat of the Academy of Sciences, which had been instituted after the Lysenko conference.5 One of the propaganda books which explored the ideological implications of Stalin's linguistic work sketched the contours of the world outlook which was supposedly yielded by the results of Soviet scientific research.6 The following elements are of particular interest. First, Stalin's statement that no science can develop without a struggle of opinions, without free criticism, was elucidated. It was, of course, made clear that Stalin's statement by no means applied to just any opinions and just any criticism. The conclu- sion is no surprise. 1 Graham 1973n (Appendix l&gt;. 444. 2 Geller &amp; Nekriõ 1986 ®&gt;. 484; (9.4): 224. 3 2danov, Ju.A., 1949. 4 Cf.

Each discussion turned out to be a crucial turning point in the struggle for the de- velopment of knowledge,2 starting with A.A. Zdanov's ^brilliant and profound" 1947 speech, summarized in §0.9, in which Aleksandrov's philosophy textbook was sub- jected to Marxist criticism. This discussion rplayed an extremely important role in the development of philosophy as well as all social and natural sciences", and had shown to Soviet intellectuals and all the public an instance of a rfree", r"daring", and rcre- ative" treatment of scientific problems.3 The account also included the 1948 biology discussion. A.A. Zdanov's earlier at- tacks on the writers Axmatova and ZoSõenko, and on the composers Muradeli, Sostakoviõ, and Prokof'ev, were mentioned as an instance of free discussion. The dis- cussions had uplifted Soviet culture: trThe fact that many composers, including those whose creative work was subjected to criticism, have recently been awarded Stalin Prizes for excellent achievements, demonstrates that the Party's criticism of errors and perversions in the composers' work has served as a powerful incentive.4 The recent affairs mentioned in the account included the following. - During the 1950 Pavlov Congress, the monopoly of a small group of idealist anti- Pavlovists was liquidated. - At a similar congress, in May 1950, the histologist O.B. LepeSinskaja, a heroine of the Revolution who had turned to science and had taken over Soviet living matter research at the age of 78 in 1949,5 turned out to have proved that cells can be formed from non-cellular living matter. The discussion showed the contradictions between the idealist "old, idealist, backward, erroneous views" and the materialist "new scientific facts".6 - In April 1951, the adoption of the materialist cosmogonie theory of the revolution- ary mathematician, science administrator, polar explorer, and editor in chief of the first Great Soviet Encyclopaedia O.Ju. Smidt r"opened new perspectives for astron- omy" and rdealt new blows to the idealist Weltanschauung'.7 On closer inspection, the design of the Soviet scientific world outlook can be consid- ered to unite all "biblical" sciences: - The origin of individual lives was ruled by Lysenko. 1 Aleksandrov 1952a (1.7): 132. ¿ Aleksandrov 1952a (1.7): 125. 3 Aleksandrov 1952a (1.7): 125-128. 4 Aleksandrov 1952a (1.7): 126. 5 Wetter 1958 (7): 76-78. 6 Aleksandrov 1952a (1.7): 127. In 1952 the minister of higher education imposed the teaching of LepeSinskaja's theories on all institutes of higher education: cf. Medvedev 1969 (8): 182. 7 Smidt's views, which in fact only pertained to the solar system, are described in Graham 1973n (5): 146- 156.</page><page sequence="100">78 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER - Individual thought was ruled by Bykov, the heir of Pavlov, *" whose brilliant teach- ing on higher nerve activity [had] driven idealism and religion out of their last refuge: the teaching on psychic activity".1 - The origin of collective life was ruled by LepeSinskaja, whose "non-cellular living matter" may even have offered the prospect of a materialist version of immortality. (In the same period people aged over 150 were discovered in the Georgian moun- tains.) - The origin of the universe was ruled by Smidt. When looking at the structure of the biblical theories, Marr's unitary glottogonie pro- cess, ruling the origin and development of language as the manifestation of collective thought, fits perfectly into the collection. It provides an analogy with Lysenko's theo- ries, and a link between materialist natural science and Marxist social science. This may explain the renewed interest in the mythical aspects of Marr's teachings in 1949, in spite of their earlier rejection by his own followers. After the addition of Marr's unitary glottogonie process and element analysis, all "technical" questions on the ori- gin and meaning of life would be answered by a self-sufficient Marxist materialist Soviet science. But Marr's canonization did not take place. Instead, Stalin's contribution to the Pravda discussion on linguistics was presented as the apex of socialist science.2 By taking up linguistics, Stalin himself ruled collective thought. But Stalin, while rejecting Marr's unitary glottogonie process, failed to present his own theory. The origin of language was lost on the way. Stalin's contribution looks like an ad hoc ornament in the crown. This impression is reinforced by Spirkin's attempts in January 1950 to im- pose the Pavlov model on Marr's teachings, and his 1965 criticism of Stalin for having prevented this. This is not the only clue suggesting that the Pravda discussion was not the culmi- nation of a planned process but was organized at short notice. Immediately after the discussion, the Academy of Sciences drew its consequences and cancelled the de- crees which supported the Marrists, the pretext being that they were based on false information from MeSõaninov, Serdjuõenko and Filin. The cancelled decrees included 1 Akademik 1949. The abolition of the psyche in the late forties is another challenge to those who seek to describe Soviet science policy as reflecting internally consistent developments in the ideology. It implied a return to ideological positions of the twenties when idealist psychic processes were replaced by objectivist neural reflexes. In BSE 6 1927 (Bexterev): 90-91, the inventor of reflexology, V.M. Bexterev, is described as an outstanding innovator for his ^resolutely breaking with subjective psychology". But, since this mechanist view of the human mind threw out with the idealist and religious bath water useful tools for social engineering, such as class consciousness and patriotism, reflexology is classed as ran attempt to liquidate psychology, to deny human consciousness [, ...] connected with attempts to biologize man and ignore his social-historical essence" in BSE 48 1941 (refleksologija): 677-678. Hn 1930-1931, in connection with criticism of perversions committed on the theoretical front, reflexology was subjected to stern criticism from Marxist-Leninist positions. Its reactionary character was fully exposed". In the same period, Jazykfrontists charged the Marrists with mechanism [Bruche-Schulz 1984 (3.2.2.1): 1071, while Filin accused the Jazykfrontists of reflexology, reducing, like the Indo-Europeanists, language to a physio- logical phenomenon [Filin 1932a: 371. Among the Marrists of the late forties, only Budagov, a newcomer, seems to have taken seriously Spirkin's instruction to put more reflexes into their linguistics (cf. §0.9). ¿ Aleksandrov 1952a (1.7): 126-128.</page><page sequence="101">THE CONTEXT 79 not only the July 1949 decree1 but also an unpublished one dated April 12th, 1950, i.e. issued about a month before the Pravda discussion.2 This implies that the Marrist "of- fensive" was still going on as late as April 1950. There are reasons to suspect that Stalin's interference produced an anomaly in the more or less consistent Soviet sci- ence policy which had been developed by certain groups in the bureaucracy who fol- lowed the guidelines that had been formulated at the Academy sessions of January 1949. Two types of scenario can be assumed for this sudden and unexpected turn of events: a bottom-up scenario and a top-down scenario. In a bottom-up scenario, one or more linguists managed to attract the attention of the top and elicit the decision to interfere. In a top-down scenario, the linguistics affair was used in a political game, or as a public relations tool. In the extant accounts of the affair, a bottom-up scenario is assumed. The present writer is aware of three versions. 1 In Newmeyer's account, as quoted in §0.7, both non-Marrists and Marrists of the MeSõaninov type, faced with A.A. Zdanov's philosophers' demand to take Marr lit- erally, made a joint effort to explain to the top that they simply could not conduct linguistic research in that way, although, in the circumstances, the risks of involv- ing any authority may have been greater than that of keeping a low profile. 2 Raskin, a Soviet linguist who emigrated in the 1970s, refers to a persistent rumour that Vinogradov, whose work on the Russian literary language was popular enough to have gained a certain renown even among politicians, shaped for Stalin the bulk of his linguistic reasoning. Vinogradov profited most from the affair by succeeding MeSöaninov in his public functions.3 3 Raskin also mentions the rumour that Cikobava instigated Stalin's assault in a friendly communication with him.4 Kiparsky asserts as a fact that Cikobava, who was a prominent man in Georgia, Stalin's native country, and never concealed his contempt of Marrism, was the real originator of the Pravda discussion.5 According to Kiparsky, Cikobava had obtained access to Stalin and managed to convince him of the necessity of a purge of Soviet linguistics.6 The mention of the unpublished decree of the Academy of Sciences presents an ar- gument against Newmeyer's hypothesis: if Meáõaninov, Serdjuõenko and Filin were in- volved in the Marrist "offensive" as late as April, they can hardly have been involved in an attempt to stop the process in May. It is more likely that some individual linguist, whether Vinogradov or Cikobava, found himself with little to lose by approaching Stalin. The Lysenko affair represents a precedent for a bottom-up scenario leading to Stalin's spontaneous intervention.

Zdanov but by Stalin himself.1 At the time Ly- senko, who had taken over biology in the 1930s, was in an awkward position. He met with resistance on the part of prominent biologists, who threatened to discharge him of his functions. In the spring of 1948 he subjected to various public attacks, both in Voprosy filosofa and in the newspaper KomsomoVskaja pravda, in an article signed by Ju.A. Zdanov.2 Lysenko could only survive by bringing his position to Stalin's personal attention: at the most crucial moment during the conference, he produced the letter from the Central Committee. In the summer of 1948, Ju.A. Zdanov had to apologize to Stalin for his actions against Lysenko.3 Paradoxically, Stalin's intervention in favour of Lysenko presents an argument for the plausibility of his intervention against a remake of the Lysenko affair. Both Stalin's intervention in the Lysenko affair and the appearance of Stalin's first Pravda contri- bution were followed by impromptu conferences at the Institute of Philosophy,4 which suggests that they came as a surprise to broad circles in the propaganda network. It is possible that, while all bureaucrats, scientists and Agitprop people were busy learning ideological lessons from the Lysenko affair, i.e. developing an ideological theory for Stalin's decisions, someone had learned a behavioural meta-lesson and picked up indications that any consistency in Stalin's behaviour was not of an ideolog- ical nature. A theory which would capture Stalin's more consistent traits would, then, be more successful in warranting survival than the enterprises of the Academy of Sciences. According to most historians, Stalin's most consistent traits included para- noia and self -congratulation. The bottom-up scenario presupposes two circumstances. Vinogradov or Cikobava must have had access to Stalin, and they must have had something to offer him. The access problem is solved if we accept the assumption that Cikobava was in a position to approach Stalin. But there are alternative scenarios. Even if Cikobava wrote Stalin's article or contributed to it, this does not mean that he had approached Stalin himself. A number of circumstances will be presented suggesting that the net- work of personal relationships connecting Stalin and linguistics was broader, and al- lowed for a top-down scenario. First, the network of relations connecting the party top, Agitprop, and the humanities must be investigated. Consider the relationship between Stalin and A.A. Zdanov. Stalin's blend of paranoia and self -congratulation produced several so-called affairs: bloody purges of groups which were imputed to limit his freedom of action, and which were often linked to his closest collaborators. The 1951 purge of the Georgian network of L.P. Berija, who headed the secret police, and the 1953 "Doctors' Plot" incident, in which nine doctors were accused of killing a number of high leaders, including A.A. Zdanov, were cases in point.5 ^edvedev 1969(2.6): 114-117. 2 Ju.A. Zdanov's 1948 paper will be returned to below. 3 Fragments of the letter, which was published in Pravda on the final day of the Lysenko sessions, are quoted in Graham 1973n (Appendix 1): 445-446. 4 Lecourt [1976 {5&gt;. 150] reports on an overnight meeting on the Lysenko intervention.

Pethybridge 1966 (2* 80.</page><page sequence="103">THE CONTEXT 81 Stalin's relation with A.A. 2danov himself was subject to fluctation. The latter had been swapped twice for G.M Malenkov as Stalin's ideological second man. Malenkov started his march to the top in 1941, when he was appointed to the State Committee of Defense over the head of A.A. Zdanov,1 although the latter, unlike Malenkov, was a full member of the Politburo at the time. Malenkov was stopped in 1946, when he was removed from the Central Committee.2 But he returned there on July 20th, 1948, i.e. one month before A.A. Zdanov's death, and just before the Lysenko affair. Malenkov is considered to have reached the zenith of his power in the period of the nineteenth Party Congress, in late 1952.3 Immediately after Stalin's death, in early 1953, many regarded Malenkov as his most likely successor.4 The significance of the rivalry between A.A. Zdanov and Malenkov was unclear at the time, but in the fifties, when a struggle took place between Malenkov and N.S. Xruáõev, the latter produced details on the so-called Leningrad Affair, an alleged conspiracy of Zdanov associates against Stalin. Some observers assume that A.A. Zdanov was assassinated on Stalin's orders.5 This may not be true, but it is a fact that action was undertaken against his closest collaborators, many of whom were concen- trated in Leningrad. They disappeared in a snowball of bloody purges which took place the subsequent year and produced many victims within the party ranks. All five secretaries of the Leningrad City Committee, for example, had lost their posts by July, 1949, and were to disappear later without a trace.6 Malenkov would later be accused of being personally involved in these purges. Even if this is not true,7 he is assumed to have made use of the empty posts by filling them with his own supporters.8 The Leningrad Affair was kept out of publicity. Unlike the purges of the thirties, the post- war ones did not have a public relations function: people who were not affected by them should not be thrown into confusion. There are both soft and hard indications that the relationships between Stalin, A.A. Zdanov, and Malenkov affected culture and science as propaganda items. The soft indication is the change of style which accompanied the personal changes. As was pointed out in §0.8 and §0.9, two goals could be distinguished in Soviet pro- paganda: vigilance on the one hand, and glorification on the other. These goals could usually be combined, but in certain cases required divergent emphases: a celebrated writer could contribute to the national myth, but the contents of his work could be harmful to the ideological state of mind of his readers. The dilemma was later sig- nalled by the composer Sostakoviõ, himself a victim of ídanovSõina. He projected the 1 The importance of the State Committee of Defense is illustrated by the fact that its composition during the Great Patriotic War remained subject to yearly post hoc revisions until 1961, reflecting the shifting power relations in the Party top during the forties and fifties. Malenkov, for example, after being a core member in the early fifties, was expelled from the Committee in 1956, yielding to XruSöev: cf.

Zdanov and Malenkov, which is usually reduced to personal jealousies instead of political differences.1 Sos- takoviõ commented on A.A. Zdanov's 1946 attack on the writers Axmatova and Zoáõenko: Allegedly Malenkov wanted to become Stalin's main ideological advisor, a rather important position, right below Stalin's top executioner Beritjla. He would be the executioner on the cultural front. Malenkov and Zdanov fought to prove themselves worthy of that honoured position. The war with Hitler was won and Malenkov decided to stress public relations and to glorify the Homeland, so that the entire enlightened world would gasp and see that Russia was the "homeland of the elephants". Malenkov worked out grandiose plans, one of which was a series of de luxe editions of Russian lit- erature from antiquity to the present. I think the series began with The Lay of Prince Igor* and ended, believe it or not, with Axmatova and ZoSõenko. But Malenkov's idea didn't work and Zdanov out- guessed him. He knew Stalin better and considered that laudatory editions were fine, but steadfast struggle with the enemy - vigilance, so to speak - was more important. With the aim of getting rid of Malenkov, Zdanov attacked Malenkov's ideas and proved to Stalin, like two plus two, that it was vigilance that Malenkov had lost. Zdanov, unfortunately, knew what and how Axmatova and ZoScenko wrote, since Leningrad was Zdanov's own turf.2 Stalin's reasons for his demoting A.A. Zdanov in 1948 can only be speculated on. On the basis of the Sostakovio's characterization, it is not impossible that A.A. Zdanov's personal style, his ex cathedra speeches, prompted Stalin's suspicion that he regarded culture, science and ideology as his private hunting ground. Although his obituary re- membered him for repeating slogans which were originally launched by Stalin,3 in his actual behaviour he did not seem to be his master's voice. The term ¿danovàõina may have irritated Stalin: A.A. Zdanov seemed to be canonizing himself. Allilueva, Stalin's daughter, gives a slightly different characterization of A.A. Zdanov. She does not account for his style by his striving for personal ambitions. Ac- cording to her, Stalin had liked him for his compulsive fear of making mistakes.4 This would also explain his predilection for vigilance and control. Typically, after Stalin's discontent with Muradeli's opera The Great Friendship, A.A. Zdanov launched a full- scale crackdown on "formalist" music, although Stalin's own reasons for disliking the opera may have been quite specific. Muradeli was a propaganda composer. He came from Gori, Stalin's birthplace. The opera glorified G.K. Ordjonikidze, Stalin's Georgian comrade in arms, who had committed suidice after a conflict with Stalin in 1937. The hero of the opera was a young Ingush, while the Ingush were one of the Caucasian peoples that had been deported for collaboration with the Germans.5 A.A. Zdanov seemed prone to overreact, to magnify Stalin's instructions. He ex- trapolated the instructions he received into systems, into ideological categories. An 1 E.g. in Pethybridge 1966 (2): 52. 2 Sostakoviö 1979: 209-210. To be sure, Sostakoviõ also mentions alternative hypotheses for the sources of ¿danovSõina. 3 Cf. §0.8. 4 Allilueva 1969a (3): 392-394; 1969b {3Ï 360-362. 5 Geller &amp; Nekriõ 1982 (8.2): 92. After A.A.

As Sostakoviõ put it, "everyone was satis- fied, the workers saw a live formalist [...]. Muradeli earned good money and met the Composers' Union's plan on self-criticism."</page><page sequence="105">THE CONTEXT 83 unprincipled pragmatist, Stalin may simply have grown tired of A.A. Zdanov's craving for consistency, which unwittlingly confronted the wishes of today's Stalin with his instructions of yesterday. But A.A. Zdanov's need for consistency also affected the style of his propaganda. It invited old-fashioned ideological fundamentalism. His philosophy speech, in which he attacked Aleksandrov, was not just a barbarous onslaught on what was left of aca- demic freedom, as is often thought:1 it contained his ideological programme. And it may have confronted Stalin with the rhetorical paradox of deterministic Marxism. The Marxist classic theorists postulated that the behaviour of an individual is determined by economic conditions and class interests. But they themselves were bourgeois sci- entists, having arrived at conclusions which were against the interests of their own class. In order to resolve this paradox, they were assumed to be men of genius, who were able to transcend the fetters of the class determinism they had discovered. A.A. Zdanov's revolutionary rhetoric inevitably implied canonization of the classics: the revolution was a one-shot event, to be handled by a closed set of geniuses on whose shoulders we must stand in order to obtain broad perspectives. As a result, power was to rest with the philologists, the "exegetes and Talmudists" of Marxism. This not only interfered with a pragmatic, technocratic approach to Stalin's problems, but also de- prived him of a source of legitimization: his status as a peer of the classic theorists. An overdose of A.A. Zdanov's orthodoxy would ultimately threaten to reduce Stalin's status to that of a caretaker. This conflicted with Stalin's self -congratulation. In all three hypotheses given above, Stalin may have interpreted A.A. Zdanov's be- haviour as an attempt to impose constraints on his freedom of action. Malenkov, on the other hand, was a pragmatic engineer, who did not care for ideology, as long as it could be expected to serve practical purposes. Now if A.A. Zdanov and Malenkov really reflected different styles, we should be able to perceive shifts of emphasis in Soviet propaganda according to who was in charge. During the Great Patriotic War, when Malenkov's star rose, A.A. Zdanov stayed in Leningrad. According to some sources, he was forced to stay there because Stalin was dissatisfied with his propaganda work during the Finnish war.2 During the Great War Soviet Propaganda was, of course, geared to arousing nationalist sentiments; re- quirements of ideological consistency were ignored. After the war and a short stay in Helsinki,3 A.A. Zdanov returned to Agitprop, while Malenkov moved to Central Asia. Between 1946 and 1948, propaganda was more and more limited to disclosing complex conspiracies and to condemnation and incrimi- nation of scientists, composers and writers. But in 1948, when Malenkov returned and A.A. Zdanov died, the tide was turned. Elements of straightforward glorification tended to gain the upper hand. Malenkov's priority, or at least that of his associates charged with propaganda, seemed to be corporate image, glorification, grandeur. In the first speech receiving broad cover- age in Kul'tura i ¿izn' in late 1949, possibly marking his restored prominence on the 1 E.g. Billington 1966 (6.2): 536. ^Gradobojew 1951: 856. 3 As presidentof the Soviet Control Committee cf. Gradobojew 1951: 856.</page><page sequence="106">84 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER propaganda front, Malenkov appealed to sentiments of imperial satisfaction: he in- vited his audience to have a look at the map and conclude that the country now had the best borders in the history of the homeland, and was, moreover, surrounded by al- lies.1 This shift possibly corresponds to the development of Soviet propaganda which Van het Reve characterizes as increasing simplification,2 and which he illustrates with the treatment of the events of 1812: at some point between 1949 and 1951, eyewit- nesses' reports were found which relieved Kutuzov of having ordered the Moscow fire.3 The January 1949 session of the Academy of Sciences marked the shift for science policy. The glorification of Pavlov, who had openly disapproved of the Soviet régime,4 and whose work was condemned as bourgeois in the thirties,5 illustrates this. As another indication of a change of style to be associated with Malenkov's dis- lodging of A.A. Zdanov, certain projects which had been triggered by the latter were undone in the years following the linguistics discussion. In 1952, Pravda complained about the dullness and the shallowness of Soviet theatre. In October of that year, the Central Committee, in a report for the nineteenth Party Congress, called for Soviet Gogol's and Saltykov-Séedrins, i.e. for satirical writers "who with the fire of their satire would burn away anything that is undesirable, rotten and moribund in Soviet society".6 This may be interpreted as a reversal of A.A. Zdanov's interference in these fields: the writer ZoSõenko, whom he had condemned in 1946, could be regarded as a Soviet Gogol'. Malenkov, an engineer, may have had more practicable ideas on engi- neering the human soul. This shift in culture policy may be considered a symptom of a more general shift toward a technocratic style, which also reduced the predominance of vigilance in the natural sciences. The year 1950 marked the return, at least in the specialist press, of bourgeois views in physics, such as the theory of relativity. In 1924, Einstein had taken the initiative for the German-Soviet Society for Culture and Technology, which significantly contributed to the technological development of the Soviet Union in the 1920s and was liquidated in 1934. Einstein and his views had been extremely popular in the Soviet Union7 until, in the second half of the thirties, he was condemned as a bourgeois "idealist babbler". The relativity theory was supposedly 1 Malenkov 1949 (0): 2. 2 Van het Reve 1955: 171: cf. § 0.8. 3 It seems tempting to assign a precise date to the discovery of the eye-witnesses' reports. The first half of Prokofev's opera War and Peace, i.e. the peace half, ran successfully in Leningrad in the 1946-1947 season. The second half, i.e. the war half featuring Kutuzov, was performed only once, on December 4th, 1948, in a closed session for party officials [Neef 1985/1989 (Prokof'ev): 370]. The opera simultaneously glorifies Kutuzov's decision to retreat from Moscow and prepare for a counterof fensive, and the heroism of the Moscow people who set fire to their own city. 4 Joravsky 1961 (4.16): 241. 5Medvedev 1969 (1): 7. 6 Cf.

This was stimulated by certain physicists, in particular by the very creator of the relativity theory, A. Einstein.1 On the one hand, ^unmasking reactionary Einsteinism (èjnStejnianstvoY was with ref- erence to Stalin's struggle against dogmatism in linguistics declared rone of the most pressing tasks of Soviet physicists and philosophers",2 and Einstein's "unscientific" views were declared to r"have dragged physics backward".3 On the other hand, the specialist press was already publishing papers by leading physicists who explicitly rejected materialist dogmas contradicting relativity theory.4 Certain signals from the science policy centre seemed to support a return to a matter-of-fact approach in sci- ence.5 Pálóczy-Horváth adduces another example.6 In 1948, A.I. Alixanov and A.I. Alixan'jan received the Stalin Prize First Class for their discovery, through the creative application of the attainments of dialectical materialism, of varitrons, particles the masses of which exceeded that of electrons by 100 to 25,000 times. Varitrons were contained in cosmic rays and were the most ele- mentary building bricks of the universe. For two years, varitrons served to prove the superiority of Soviet science. Then, in 1951, the Academy of Sciences published ma- terial which proved that varitrons did not exist: this was followed by "self-criticism" of Ju.A. Zdanov in the journal Bol'Sevik for the gross errors committed by Soviet science in the recent past.7 Varitrons were in fact missing in the 1951 Soviet cosmogony de- scribed in the beginning of this section.8 Neither the discovery of varitrons nor their disappearance seems to have affected the prominence of Alixanov in the Soviet nu- clear programme and later that of Alixan'jan in the Soviet space programme.9 1 BSE 43 1939 (otnositel'nosti teorija): 583-618. 2 Kuznecov, I.V., 1952: 42-43, 47. 3 Maksimov 1953: 194. 4 Pálóczy-Horváth 1964 (1.4): 67. Einstein was officially rehabilitated in his obituary in 1955 [Pálóczy- Horváth 1964 (1.5): 77]. A thorough account of the post-war vicissitudes of relativity theory is found in Graham 1973n (4): 111-138. 5 Thus, by closing ranks against would-be Lysenkos, the physicists succeeded in surviving the wave of science policy which was initiated by the Lysenko affair. In 1952, philosophers of science were alarmed about the fact that, although it had been three years since S.I. Vavilov voiced the complaint that the physicists' struggle against hostile ideology was still extremely weak, processes analogous to those which had cleared the way in biology, physiology, cytology, etc. still failed to occur [Oí redakcii 1952: 3-41. 6 Pálóczy-Horváth 1964 (1.4): 65-66. ^ Pálóczy-Horváth probably refers to 2danov, Ju.A., 1951: 42. This passage will be quoted and discussed toward the end of this section. 8 The iconography of the Soviet scientific world outlook was subject to continuous conjunctural changes. In Buchholz 1957: 78-79, a post-Stalinist version was sketched, in which the most ludricrous exponents of Stalin's version (Lysenko, LepeSinskaja) had been replaced. The astrophysician V.A. Ambarcumjan took care of galactic systems; Smidt took care of the creation of individual planets; the biochemist A.I. Oparin replaces LepeSinskaja with his (older) materialist theory of the origin of life; Miõurin and Pavlov replaced their disciples Lysenko and Bykov for the development of life and mankind, and for the mental capacities of man. 9 According to SES 1980 (Alixanov-Alixanjan): 40, the Tbilisi-born Abram Isaakoviõ Alixanov and Artemi j/Artèm Isaakoviõ Alixan'jan were brothers.</page><page sequence="108">86 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER Thus, Lepschy may have been correct in marking the linguistics debate as an early sign of a policy shift, even if destalinization may not be the appropriate term.1 But there are also harder indications of the link between science policy and the controversy between A.A. Zdanov and Malenkov. It makes sense to presume that the former considered himself personally responsible for ideology and propaganda, while the latter, regarding them as technical matters, may be expected to have delegated them. When A.A. Zdanov was responsible, in the thirties and during ¿danovSõina, he himself was the "face" of Soviet propaganda. But when Malenkov was in power the propaganda was relatively anonymous (apart from featuring Stalin, of course). Now consider the person who is likely to have been responsible during these periods, and who has appeared several times in the present story: G.F. Aleksandrov. Here are his antecedents, as found in various sources. 1 A philosopher, who had published on Aristotle in 1940.2 2 The "toothless propagandist of vegetarianism": author of the philosophy textbook which was attacked by A.A. Zdanov in 1947.3 3 A close associate of Malenkov.4 4 Director of the Commission for Compiling a History of the Great Patriotic War of the Academy of Sciences which existed in 1945-1946.5 5 Member of the Academy of Sciences since 1946. 6 Director of the Institute of Philosophy towards the end of 1948 (the present writer is not informed on the exact dates). 7 Acting head of Agitprop since 1940, "the Soviet Goebbels", as Vinatrel calls him,6 until he was dismissed from there in the wake of the philosophy discussion.7 This shows that A.A. Zdanov's speech was not just an ideological programme but also part of his staffing policy. 8 Orchestrator of the propagandists follow-up of the Lysenko consecration.8 9 Author of the first congratulatory reaction following Stalin's Pravda contributions and Vinogradov's exegesis9 as printed in Izvestija AN SSSR, OLiJa.10 1 Cf. §0.7. In fact Malenkov, and his relatively technocratic approach, may have been a connecting factor between the drive toward pragmatism in culture and science policy during Stalin's last years and the actual cultural thaw in the mid fifties. Malenkov's part was not played out until 1957: in Pálóczi-Horváth's [1961 (10): 213] analysis of the events at the 1956 20th Party Congress, XruSõev did not deliver his famous destalinization speech of his own accord but was forced to do so by a group of party leaders which probably included Malenkov. 2 Aleksandrov 1940. 3 I.e.

Zdanov's death, Pravda car- ried an article criticizing the positions of Voprosy filosofa. This was followed by a pa- per from Aleksandrov in that journal about cosmopolitism.5 A.A. Zdanov was praised for his thorough analysis of Aleksandrov's book, which had produced important im- provements in Soviet philosophy.6 But now it was time to deal with the rootless cos- mopolites, the haters of the Russian people: - in the world (e.g. the pacifist E. Culbertson, the philosopher Russell); - in Russia (e.g. the bourgeois ideologist P.N. Miljukov); - in the Party (e.g. the enemy of the people Trockij and the so-called left communist Buxarin); - and at the Institute of Philosophy. The cosmopolites of the institute included the editor of Voprosy filosofa, Kedrov. The latter had attacked Aleksandrov before the 1947 philosophy discussion,7 but now turned out to have expressed cosmopolite views even during it.8 Needless to say, Kedrov was replaced.9 Aleksandrov did not design new coherent ideologies. His work shows that he was, in Sostakovio's sense, a typical Malenkovian: not an ideologist but an image builder. He was considered a master in accommodating ideological swings. His major feats were his explanation of the 1939 Nazi-Soviet Pact (after five years of anti-fascist propaganda), and that of the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War.10 As demonstrated in Aleksandrov's passage on the Soviet world outlook quoted earlier on, he used any material to construct beaming prospects. He had no problem in exploiting his own comedown, inflicted upon him by the late A.A. Zdanov, in order to compose an inviting picture of Soviet culture and to moralize on the importance of free discussion in Stalinist science.

It would be interesting to find out who coined the term Great Patriotic War.</page><page sequence="110">88 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER Against this background, it is plausible that Cikobava or Vinogradov had access to the top. Cikobava and Vinogradov did not have to have direct access to Stalin: Alek- sandrov was an appropriate intermediate. He occupied a pivotal position in a network comprising the Institute of Philosophy, the Academy sections of the humanities, Agit- prop, and top party people, and was engaged in a complex power struggle within this network. He must have known exactly which campaigns were going on. In the case of linguistics, he is likely to have sided with Vinogradov and Cikobava. He was like Vino- gradov an Academy member and a glorifier, ran like Cikobava an institute, and was like both a traditionalist humanities student. Aleksandrov was the victim of A.A. Zdanov's fundamentalist attack but, as Wetter reports, he was also subjected to renewed attacks in early 1950.1 Now if he wished to make clear that he had won a battle it would be unelegant, from a propagandists viewpoint, to open a new philosophy discussion. But the linguistics campaign which happened to be going on was available for use as a public relations event. This does not yet explain Stalin's personal involvement with the matter. It must also be made plausible that Aleksandrov, Vinogradov, and Cikobava had something to offer to him. Possibly Aleksandrov, Vinogradov, and Cikobava offered Stalin new food for his distrust. They could point to the fact that Ju.A Zdanov and S.I. Vavilov, who were re- sponsible for science policy, had not quite learned the lessons of the Lysenko inter- vention: although they had switched to "Russian priorities", they were still canonizing dead masters, like Pavlov and Marr, whose results were transformed into vantage points for research planning. This brought about the risk that vigilant ideologists and unprestigious specialists in uninteresting dead languages2 took over at the cost of such useful glorifiers of the Russian past as Vinogradov. The canonizations also brought about the chance that a return of ¿danovSõina, an accumulation of structured campaigns, such as the spectacular Pavlov apotheosis, would leave little room for Stalin to promote his own preferences and would thus yield an insufficient share of glorification for Stalin himself. It cannot be ruled out that Stalin was convinced by lin- guistic arguments. Maybe Cikobava pointed out to Stalin that Marr had defiled the Georgian pre-Babelian paradise with the sin of class; or maybe Vinogradov offered with his Teaching on the Word more old-fashioned glorification than Marr, convinc- ing Stalin of the vulgarity of Marrism. But, quite likely, linguistic arguments were not involved at all. If Stalin did not care for a consistent science policy, only blinkered linguists would take it for granted that he would be genuinely interested in, say, the autonomy of grammar. Before attempting a more elaborate hypothesis, let us have a closer look at the Pravda contributions as a public relations event, and see what was in it for Stalin. In several sources the authorship of Stalin's contribution is discussed. In a conver- sation with the Dutch linguist C.L Ebeling, Cikobava professed to having approached Stalin and written his contribution.3 A similar communication may underly Kiparsky's 1 Wetter 1952 (1.9.4): 227. 2 In recent encyclopaedias, such as SES 1980 (Mesõaninov): 809, MeSõaninov will in fact end up as a spe- cialist in dead languages. 3 C.L. Ebeling, private communication.</page><page sequence="111">THE CONTEXT 89 assertions, which were published in a period when his sources had to be protected and which attributed to Cikobava the part of the ^courageous craftsman with whom the Marrists had not reckoned".1 Girke &amp; Jachnow note the similarities of Cikobava's and Stalin's linguistic conceptions,2 which concords with the present writer's impres- sion that the clear-cut linguistic argumentation of Stalin's contribution bears more re- semblance to Cikobava's style than to Vinogradov's wordy eloquence. A systematic comparison of Stalin's contributions with the work of Cikobava and Vinogradov may provide more definitive conclusions. But, even if Cikobava or Vinogradov provided the linguistic arguments, this does not imply that they produced Stalin's complete text. Consider, for example, Stalin's promotion of a free struggle of opinions. Bulthaup regards this inconsistency with re- spect to Stalin's earlier policies as evidence against his authorship,3 but it seems un- likely that a linguist occasionally acting as a ghost-writer for Stalin would insert, or even propose to insert, such major breaks on his own accord. The statements which are overtly inconsistent with Stalin's earlier policies are least likely to have been conceived by relative outsiders, and most likely to have been inspired by Stalin him- self.4 We may presume that the Pravda contributions were a joint production. Consider the question of why Stalin's interference was staged as a public discus- sion. If Stalin's only goal was to turn the tide in linguistics, a simpler action, as little as a telephone call, would have seemed sufficient. A reasonable guess is that Stalin's self -congratulation provided the reasons. By preventing the planned Man* apotheosis and enacting the Pravda discussion, Stalin had the opportunity to demonstrate that he was in full control of ideology and propaganda. Pethybridge gives a characterization of Soviet propaganda of the period. Propaganda was relayed at different levels: on a comparatively sophisticated plane for consumption by the students and the intellectuals themselves, and in vulgarized form for the rest of the population.^ In view of the subject, the Pravda discussion was not aimed at the lowest echelon of the Soviet public. But the propagandists impact of the linguistics affair on educated people, such as schoolteachers, may have been noticeable. In A.A. Zdanov's time, the public was made tö perceive culture and science as the cockpits of ideological strug- gle, as things to distrust, as issues to avoid. The linguistics debate had the opposite effect. Naive observers, who do not note further divergences between the biology and linguistics affairs, note that the latter was popular among the Soviet public whereas the former was not.6 After a few years of A.A. Zdanov, it must have been quite pleas- ant to be confronted with a public case of disagreement with an unpredictable out- come. It must have been amusing to read in Pravda how eminent professors flew at each other and ridiculed the alleged theories of a respected Soviet idol. The enter- 1 Kiparsky 1957: 88. 2 Girke &amp; Jachnow 1974 (2.5): 63. 3 Bulthaup 1968: 7. 4 The same counter-argument may apply to Bulthaup's [1968: 7] second argument against Stalin's author- ship: the assertion that the collectivization of Soviet agriculture was a top-down process, initiated by the state, instead of a bottom-up process, as it was considered in Stalin's earlier writings. 5 Pethybridge 1966 (2): 72. b Cf.

Of course only Stalin had the power to bring this argument to bear, but the public perceived it as a bright idea. Finally, it must have been fun to read how all those professors joined in thanking Stalin for having solved their problem in a fatherly way. The linguistics debate was a new and colourful element in Stalin's image as presented in the media. The intellectuals, on the other hand, appreciated A.A. Zdanov's personal interven- tions, his ex cathedra speeches to them. Now if eclipsing ¿danovSõina was Stalin's goal, he could not make do with less. For the first time Stalin participated à titre per- sonnel in a public discussion on cultural matters, filling the space which A.A. Zdanov had vacated. But, in order to show that he was in control, Stalin had to display a higher style than A.A. Zdanov. Whereas the latter intervened in favour or against a viewpoint, as in the Aleksandrov discussion, Stalin presented himself as standing above the parties: he only took a position after letting both sides of the matter be heard. Whoever proposed this setting, Aleksandrov, Vinogradov, Cikobava, or Malenkov, made a good deal. For some reason, communist dictators feel a respect for science and scientists; N. Ceausescu is a case in point. Perhaps they feel this respect because their own ideology is claimed to be scientifically based. The only thing a scientist can offer to a dictator, apart from an atom bomb, is a share in the scientists1 prestige. By proposing the role of referee in scientific matters to Stalin, the linguists offered him the opportunity to prove to the world that by ruling the word, which is the beginning of any world outlook, he was the "star of all sciences (korifej vsex naukT: this was Stalin's recurrent epitheton in the comments following the Pravda discussion.1 From now on, Soviet science did not only lead the world, but was also led by the leader of the Soviet Union. But there are passages in Stalin's contributions which do not refer to linguistics, nor serve to enhance his status as a top scientist. This layer requires separate exami- nation. Besides the intellectuals and the ordinary people, there was another group to be addressed: the party bureaucracy, in particular the propaganda apparatus, which had resorted under A.A. Zdanov. Vinatrel explores the possibility that the linguistics dis- cussion served as a vehicle for communication in this inner circle of the party estab- lishment. Vinatrel cannot put his finger on the reasons why a discussion on linguistics should be used to convey messages (he adduces the bizarreness of Soviet customs), but he points to a precedent. In the thirties, a heated discussion on the interpretation of a verse from Shakespeare in the newspapers Pravda and Izvestija announced the removal and execution of Buxarin, the editor in chief of Izvestija.2 If the Pravda dis- cussion is to present an analogue of Vinatrel's Shakespeare discussion a plausible message and a plausible reason to adopt the medium must be identified. * Cf. Ot redakcii 1950: 34. As far as the present writer is aware, the oldest occurrence of the epitheton is found in Vavilov 1949, which appeared six months before the Pravda intervention. 2 Vinatrel 1950. The present writer has not sorted out the Shakespeare discussion and its implications, which Vinatrel presents as established facts.</page><page sequence="113">THE CONTEXT 9 1 A plausible message is easily conjectured. It had to be made clear that producing propaganda was not to lead to uncontrolled production of ideology in the bureau- cracy: Stalin himself is in charge of ideology. The passage, quoted in §0.7, against the "exegists and Talmudists" of Marxism makes clear that, henceforth, A.A. Zdanov's vigilant dogmatism was no longer an automatic argument for action: dogmatic Marxism no longer presided over creative (tvorõeskij) Marxism.1 The power to create Marxism, of course, rested with Stalin. There is another passage which was easily decoded by the propaganda bureau- cracy. Consider Stalin's reference, quoted in §0.6, to Marx's and Engels' modesty in considering dialectical materialism the product of the previous development of the sciences, "philosophy included". In Agitprop quarters, this was likely to be interpreted as a definitive decision to substitute the rhetoric of continuity for revolutionary rhetoric. It was also likely to be interpreted as a reference to A.A. Zdanov's attack on Aleksandrov's philosophy textbook; as described in §0.9, the attack was targeted against the application of the rhetoric of continuity in philosophy. Stalin's remark could not fail to be interpreted as a personal assault on the late A.A. Zdanov. Inter- estingly, Vinatrel points to this implication as early as July 1950, i.e. even before Aleksandrov, the butt of A.A. Zdanov's attack, reappeared on the public scene. Vina- trel suspects him of dwelling in obscure places, as a victim of earlier purges.2 As we saw, Aleksandrov made his come-back in 1948, after Malenkov's return and A.A. Zdanov's death. He was involved in the Lysenko follow-up and is likely to have been involved in the reorganization of Voprosy filosofa. But he was under renewed pressure in late 1949,3 when Pravda criticized his work in Voprosy filosofa published after Kedrov's replacement, and was removed from the editiorial committee of Bol'Sevik, the theoretical journal of the Central Committee.4 All this seems to point to a continuing struggle in Agitprop circles. A clear and firm statement seemed to be necessary to decide it. Nevertheless the linguistics discussion seems to be a heavy medium for internal communication about a shift of power in the propaganda bureaucracy. Additional clues and motives must be sought in order to explain the dimensions of the Pravda dis- cussion. Himmer provides impressive evidence of "^sopian language" in Stalin's writing: re- peated obscure passages which can be decoded by simple logic games. In his paper, Himmer assembles obvious clues for hidden attacks against Lenin in the pre-war pe- riod: against Lenin's decision to participate in the Duma, the pre-revolutionary par- liament,5 and against Lenin's decision to interrupt war communism and start the NÊP, the new economic policy, which implied a partial return to capitalism in the early twenties.6 Himmer decodes Stalin's opinion that Lenin was incapable, inconsistent, and 1 Wetter [1952 (1.10): 238] retraces creative Marxism to a statement made by Stalin in 1925: ^there is dogmatic Marxism and creative Marxism; I rely on the latter". 2 Vinatrel 1950. 3 Cf.

Two defendents, Ivanov and Zelenskij, were ac- cused of having in 1911 become agents of the Oxrana, the czarist secret police. Ivanov worked in Tula and was given the cover name Samarin, 'man from Samara'. Zelenskij worked in Samara. This suggests that the two alleged spies mirrored each other and enable us to deduce that Zelenskij's cover name should have been Tulin, 'man from Tula'. This happened to be one of Lenin's early pseudonyms. This situation should convey the innuendo that Lenin had been an agent of the Oxrana. This charge against Lenin was veiled by giving Zelenskij other pseudonyms and adding another character to the cast of spies. But that Stalin meant to imply the charge was indicated by a similar accusation against Lenin encoded in the same trial, when a Polish spy called Ul'janov was introduced. Ul'janov was Lenin's real name. According to Himmer, the conclusion that Stalin was indicting Lenin as a foreign agent is inescapable.2 The question is what goal Stalin's inserting of Copian language served. In the early period, ^sopic methods may be explained by Stalin's concept of a conspirational party: open internal disagreements played into the hands of the enemy. Later in- stances may be regarded as a means of overcoming the ban on factionalism in com- municating disagreement within the party: the encoded messages recruited their own audience. But after the war these motives seemed less important. Himmer does not treat this period. Himmer assumes that Stalin personally inserted his ^Esopian language, which prompts him to attribute more intelligence to Stalin than is generally done. This is plausible for the early period, but it cannot be ruled out that in a later period ^sopic methods were used or proposed by those ghost-writers who were intelligent enough to discern Stalin's preferences:3 in that case, the encoding process was subject to explicit discussion at the top, while the messages were more likely to be understood in the party top and propaganda bureaucracy. Then, the images and code words em- ployed in ^sopian language were likely to originate from a standard stock which was used in contemporary propaganda. Possibly the "obscure" passages in Stalin's contri- bution were transparent for rank-and-file Agitprop people, whose daily work con- sisted of interpreting, explaining and applying the images which the central organs devised for them. It may be suggested, for example, that adducing the Talmudists, or accusing the Marrists of having "strangely wandered into the footsteps of the Bundists"4 may be interpreted as anti-Semitic: the Bund was a Jewish Trade Union which "self-liquidated" shortly after the Revolution.5 Even if it is not quite clear to whom precisely or against whom the anti-Semitic allusions may have been directed, in 1 Further evidence of Stalin's rejection of Lenin in his early writings are found in Himmer 1986. 2 Himmer 1987: 21ff. 3 All of Himmer's examples, except the one given here, are taken from Stalin's collected works, which ap- peared between 1946 and 1952. It would be interesting to find out whether the early originals contained the hidden attacks on Lenia 4 Stalin 1951a: 73; 1950b: 42. 5 Although Talmudism was not a recent invention: in 1920s polemic it was already used in Stalin's sense, i.e. to characterize as unhealthy a thorough philological interest for the writings of the Marxist-Leninist classics: cf. Joravsky 1961 (2.5): 89.</page><page sequence="115">THE CONTEXT 93 1950 there was hardly a lull between the strongly anti- Jewish campaigns against cos- mopolitism of 1949 and the 1953 Doctors' Plot affair, which involved seven Jewish physicians. The Lysenko and Pavlov affairs hit Jewish researchers particularly hard.1 A crucial clue may be contained in Stalin's "unaccountable"2 likening of the existing "regime" in Soviet linguistics to the regime of Arakõeev. Both Lepschy and L'Hermitte ascribe, in view of his own record, Stalin's comparison of Marr with the ferocious and obscurantist Arakõeev to his macabre sense of humour.3 But, after its introduction by Stalin, Arakõeev-like regime was repeated 14 times in the discussion,4 and numerous times in the laudatory comments which appeared in the media and the specialist lit- erature after the discussion: both arakõeevskij reìim and arakõeevSdina were used. In the aftermath of the Pravda discussion, evocation of the eradication of the Arakõeev-like regime seemed to serve as a token of understanding. Educated Russians knew who Arakõeev was, but arakõeevSdina was not an every- day word. The term refers to a technical concept in "Pokrovskian" Marxist history, where it denotes a ^typically Russian formation of the European reactionary move- ment in the era of the Holy Union": Arakõeev himself is only viewed as an exponent of the phenomenon.5 After the annexation of the Russian past, arakõeevSõina simply re- ferred to arakdeevSdina itself: the reign of Arakõeev as a person, when he was the "semi-emperor {polu-imperatorYfi brightening up a crass and despotic police state in front of the emperor by an outward appearance of good breeding. As native speakers confirm, arakõeevSõina is not used in a generic sense (i.e. for things which are like arakõeevèõina but not arakõeevSdina itself) without evoking its etymon. People who do not know who Arakõeev was, do not know what arakõeevãõina means. The two in- stances of arakõeevSõina in Stalin's collected works7 seem to support the second meaning of arakdeevSdina, which was quoted in §0.6: "a situation in which a small group of people despotically and wilfully dictates an area of public life". But the oldest dictionary registration of this meaning of which the present writer is aware, is only found in the 1957 4-volume dictionary of Russian.8 The academicians on the editorial committee of this dictionary were Vinogradov and Obnorskij, two Pravda discussion protagonists9 who emerged victorious; they may have been eager to include the sec- ond meaning.10 It seems safe to assume that, until 1950, the public perceived araköeeveöina as a historical term and as part of the world of Agitprop: it was high- lighted in Pankratova's history textbook, which was used in all the schools and repre- sented the annexed Soviet past as it was permanently updated to represent the latest 1 Geller &amp; Nekriõ 1986 (9Y 484; 1982 (9.4): 223. ¿ W.K.

Then, in view of the circumstances, the association of arakõeevSõina with ¿danov- Sdina may have imposed itself. To those who came up with this combination, the resulting message is an accusation of cruelty and obscurantism, directed at A.A. 2da- nov, who was responsible for culture and science policy. If, as Pokrovskij put it, history is politics projected into the past, new policies are made clear in the historical references. Consider the propagandists meta-world which the propaganda bureaucracy had created, and which was located in the early 19th century. Kutuzov had defeated Napoleon in the Patriotic War. The golden age of approved Russian culture had started. The National Poet PuSkin honoured Kutuzov2 and wrote epigrams on Arakõeev, which were now published in the history books, in the section on arakõeevSõina.3 If the Patriotic War had produced a golden era, just wait and see what the Great Patriotic War would do. The new Puâkins were fluttering about, just waiting to be caught. The propaganda bureaucrats must have found it as hard as the present writer to resist the temptation to project A.A. Zdanov-Arakõeev back into his broader context. A.A. Zdanov was not the shadow of his cherished Kutu- zov, who outwitted the foreign invaders in an honest war, but the failed minister of defense, who just sat in Saint-Petersburg instead of fighting, and, when the war was over, took advantage of the czar's confidence to install an obscurantist police state. But is Kutuzov enough for Stalin? The Kutuzov role is vulnerable, even if the author- ship of the 1812 Moscow fire, a blemish on his image, is brushed away. Malenkov, who took over the defense of the Homeland in 1941, after the failure of the regular com- manders, is a more likely candidate. But there must be a place for Stalin. In 1950, the Leningrad affair purge was completed. Even if the dimensions of the affair were unknown to leading party members the affair itself, by virtue of its dimen- sions, cannot have escaped their attention: people in the network could not have failed to notice the disappearance of some of their contacts. As Allilueva reports, there were victims in nearly all families in the party top.4 It is not excluded that, within the party top and the propaganda apparatus, some kind of explanation for liq- uidating A.A. Zdanov's entourage was considered expedient: an image which enabled those people to accommodate the changes in their practical work. Even if two persons do not privately believe a given explanation for an unpleasant fact, they may still want to use it in a working relationship, when communicating with each other, as a part of their shared frame of reference. The identification of A.A. 2danov with Arakõeev in the Pravda discussion, and that of Stalin with the czar, provided this im- age: like A.A. Arakõeev, A.A. Zdanov had abused the powers which were entrusted to 1 Pankratova's historiographical allegiance to the party line is documented in Powell 1951: 376 and Van het Re ve 1955: 170, but is also testified to by her membership of the Central Committee since 1952 [SES 1980 (Pankratova): 974]. 2 Cf.

This is not necessarily contradicted by Stalin's own earlier usage of arakõeevSõina, which dates from 1926 and 1927: both times it was used in assaults on G.E. Zinov'ev, a left-wing communist whom Stalin accused of advocating the substitu- tion of party dictatorship for dictatorship of the proletariat.1 The application was different but the basic image was the same: Stalin's arakõeevSõina was not just cruelty and obscurantism but also abuse of a locum tenens position. On this assumption, the linguistics debate may be interpreted as an icon. Stalin was not just the star of all sciences. He was the emperor, who pronounced a stern judge- ment, in a just trial between A.A. Zdanov and Malenkov, disguised as linguistic paradigms: Marr's revolutionary deterministic theory and Vinogradov's glorification of the continuity of the national languages. Marr and his followers were verbally exe- cuted: arakdeevSõina was "eliminated",2 "liquidated",3 "smashed to bits",4 which pro- vided a curious contrast to the mild treatment which MeSoaninov's linguists received in real life. The message to the ideologists was clearest in Stalin's final words, quoted above. "Marxism does not recognize immutable conclusions and formulas obligatory for all epochs and periods. Marxism is the enemy of all kinds of dogmatism." Removing language from the superstructure was only a start. Redefining the superstructure as an instrument of the state was only the next step. Stalin declared himself competent to remove any Marxist dogma. Marxism may be the product of history but history does not determine Stalin: Stalin determines history. Of course Marx and Engels had to be modest: they were Stalin's pedestal.5 The personality cult had really only started. This iconic interpretation of the Pravda debate is, of course, hypothetical. The evidence is circumstantial: the hypothesis makes a few things fall into place. A real reconstruction of the linguistics affair requires further research. More information must be extracted from the journals, such as Voprosy filosofa, Bol'Sevik, and Kul'tura i íizrí. The biographies of Aleksandrov and Cikobava should be studied, as well as the archives, if they still exist, of Agitprop, AON, and the Academy of Sciences. One question has remained unanswered so far: that of the origin of the renewed pressure on Aleksandrov in the second half of 1949. If another layer of psychology is allowed, a possible explanation can be offered. Consider the position of young Ju.A. Zdanov, who after the war had become the head of the science section of the Central Committee and continued to occupy this post until Stalin's death. As mentioned above, he was a chemist, who completed a thesis on the philosophy of science in 1948, at Aleksandrov's Institute of Philosophy.6 Since he lived in his parents1 house in the Kremlin,7 Ju.A. Zdanov can hardly have failed to influence his father's 1947 philoso- 1 Stalin 1949: 68. 2Obnorskij 1951:91. 3 Stalin 1951a: 76. 4 Stalin 1951a: 75. 5 As Allilueva, Stalin's daughter, reporting on her father's love of modesty, quotes him: "modesty embel- lishes a Bolshevik" [Allilueva 1969a (3): 348; 1969b (3): 320]. 6 The present writer has not found out whether Ju.A. 2danov defended his thesis before or after the summer of 1948, during which Lysenko took over, A.A. Zdanov died, Kedrov was dismissed, and Malenkov and Aleksandrov made their comeback. 7 Allilueva 1967b (17): 192, 197; 1967a (17): 179.</page><page sequence="118">96 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER phy speech, with its remarkably precise passages on the natural sciences. His educa- tion as a real scientist may also explain the unorthodox first issues of Voprosy filosofa, edited by Kedrov, and his attempts to get rid of Lysenko. Ju.A. Zdanov phrased his attack at Lysenko as follows. A proprietary attitude toward science - when a scientist looks upon other people trying to conduct re- search in the same area with unhealthy jealousy, when he tries to use his position and authority to hin- der the developments of other directions in his area of science - cannot and must not take place in our science. We recall the fervent, even startling, words of I.V. Miöurirt "My followers must outstrip me, contradict me, even demolish my work, while at the same time continuing it. Progress is created only by means of such a consistent demolishing of [earlier] work".1 It is for such passages, which recall Stalin's 1950 promotion of the free struggle of opinions, that Ju.A. Zdanov had to apologize to Stalin in Pravda in 1948. Ju.A. Zdanov's failure to disappear or be arrested during the Leningrad affair is not in itself a surprising fact. Many families underwent disparate fates in the period. Lysenko's opponent N.I. Vavilov, who died in prison in 1943, was the brother of the Academy president S.I. Vavilov, who enthusiastically proclaimed Stalin the star of all sciences.2 Molotov stayed on the Central Committee after his Jewish wife had been deported toward the end of 1948. Allilueva, Stalin's daughter, reports on the arrests in the same period of several aunts, nannies and friends, as well her Jewish first father- in-law.3 But Ju.A. Zdanov's position was quite exceptional. Allilueva had started visit- ing the Zdanovs in early 1948, had married Ju.A. Zdanov in early 1949, and lived with the Zdanov family since that time. There are indications that Ju.A. Zdanov had his personal priorities in science poli- cy, which were more or less constant between the war and Stalin's death.4 Having written his thesis on the philosophy of science, he was interested in keeping science materialist in Lenin's sense, and in safeguarding it against God and other subjective (anthropomorphic, teleological, idealistic) elements. This may explain the discussions in Voprosy filosofa on such sensitive branches as quantum mechanics, where God was suspected of throwing dice,5 and the Soviet interest in the "biblical" sciences, which were the ones most susceptible to "subjective" elements. As Graham characterizes the situation of the period, "any interpretation of the universe that could turn into an ar- gument, however strained, for divine interference was automatically condemned."6 Prominent natural scientists who, r"in ecstatic amazement at the harmony of the laws of nature",7 postulated a sophisticated God for adult intellectuals, scientists who smuggled "the finger of God" into their equations, who came up with "the birth of the universe", or who simply assumed a finite universe, could be accused of "idealism", 1 Zdanov, Ju.A., 1948, translation from Graham 1973n (Appendix '}. 445. 2 Vavilov 1949. 3 Allilueva 1967b (17): 196; 1967a (17): 182.

Zdanov's efforts to degrade Lysenko's biology, which operated with such anthropomorphic concepts as "marriage for love" and "co-opera- tion for the good of the species" in the plant world,2 was consistent with his other ef- forts towards what he considered the démystification of Soviet science.3 But Ju.A. Zdanov did not always get his way. Allilueva reports on the Lysenko af- fair as an incident between her father and her future husband. [... M]y father gave his support to T. Lysenko, flattered by the false "[tpracticism]" of this ^careerist], who played cunningly on my father's weakness for everything "practical". I recall how in 1948 Jurij Zdanov, who was then working in the Central Committee's Department of Science, came out against Lysenko, who, in turn, was instantly defended by my father. "Now genetics are finished!", said Jurij at the time.4 The glorifying element was added to Ju.A. Zdanov's demythologization programme at the 1949 Academy congress. Ju.A. Zdanov's self -chosen mission of materialist purity was blended with the imposed mission of "Russian priorities". His attempts to have the problems discussed in Voprosy filosofa were stopped. Glorification does not mix with uncertainty. Adding some glorification, Ju.A. Zdanov could continue his programme for the démystification of life and the universe: removing one religion makes room for another one. He had to accept being overruled every now and then, and having to al- low for a few Lysenkos and LepeSinskajas being parachuted down from the top. In other discussions, however, his results were more satisfactory: serious paradigms were canonized or Lysenkoist coups were foiled. In chemistry, Ju.A. Zdanov's own turf, the would-be Lysenko G.V. Celincev was defeated, while the struggle against idealism mainly resulted in terminological changes.5 The major Pavlov project seemed to satisfy both Ju.A. Zdanov's own materialist condition and the imposed Russian pri- orities condition. The question is how the linguistics project fitted in. Allilueva reports on the linguistics affair. [Stalin] had a certain acquaintance with languages, dating back to his seminary days when he had studied Latin and Greek. He could read Georgian but used to say that he had largely forgotten the language. He knew Russian well in its simpler, conversational form; therefore, in Russian he could not be an elo- quent orator or writer, lacking synomyms, nuances, depths. With the help of a dictionary he could make out a simple German text. This he considered sufficient to enter, in 1950, into a discussion about the theory of linguistics and condemn, "from a Marxist position", the School of Marr, the world-renowned 1 Graham 1973n {5k 143-146. A.A. Zdanov, in his 1947 philosophy speech, restricted himself to attacking Einstein's numerous followers, who by fixing a date for the creation of the universe, t"used the feebleness of their science to slaunder nature" [¿danov, A.A., 1947 (2): 271; 19502c (2): 70]. But after a while Einstein became himself a major target: Hn 1946 Einstein published the book The Making of the Universe, in which he declares himself a sup- porter of the reactionary theory of the expanding universe. In this book, he attempts to provide the "sci- entific proof" of the popist dogma of the creation of the world. [Karpov 1952: 222] 2 Lysenko's insistence that trees of the same species co-operated within one another for mutual survival induced him to recommend their being planted in closely packed clusters. 3 Graham 1973n (Appendix 1): 448. In the linguistics discussion, both parties ascribed anthropomorphic characteristics to language without anyone minding. Stalin, as quoted in §0.7, considered languages to struggle and be victorious or defeated. The Marrists criticized the Indo-Europeanists for ascribing "nobility" to languages but, while rejecting the Indo-Europeanists' and Kautsky's language absorption, proposed that such progressive languages as Russian "assist" such "backward" languages as Udmurt [Filin 1931: 81-82], 4 Allilueva 1969a (3): 358; 1969b (3&gt;. 329. 5 Graham 1973n (I* 21, (8): 297-323.</page><page sequence="120">98 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER linguist. The only people who profited by it were Marr's enemies, who were [rnow supported] by the "wise leader".1 The linguistics affair took place when Allilueva lived with the Zdanov family and did not see her father.2 She may be assumed to reflect Ju.A. Zdanov's perceptions: Marr was a world-famous linguist, the Pavlov of linguistics. It does not seem unreasonable to assume that Ju.A. Zdanov was involved in the preparation of the Marr consecra- tion.3 Now consider the personal relationships between Stalin and his son-in-law. Allilueva reports that Stalin was very fond of the Zdanovs and wanted her to marry Ju.A. Zdanov. "Five years later this came true, but by then A.A. Zdanov [rhimself] had died, having lost my father's confidence; so now this marriage of mine was of little in- terest to him."4 Stalin was fact opposed to Allilueva's moving in with the Zdanovs, wanting Ju.A. Zdanov to move in with the Stalins instead.5 Allilueva recalls that shortly after their marriage, her husband "was suffering on account of his work in the Central Committee. He didn't know, he couldn't imagine, what he had gotten himself into".6 We must not entirely rule out that Stalin's perceptions of private relationships were involved in the incidents in Soviet science policy. Consider the chronology of the events of 1950. As shown above, Ju.A. Zdanov had invested a great deal of energy in staging the grandiose Pavlov apotheosis, the fruit of enormous preparation, involving thousands of scientists and intensive media coverage including a film, producing na- tional glory, materialist orthodoxy and real science. The Pavlov project outstripped the ad-hoc Lysenko coup in all respects: it must have been a moment of triumph. But, on June 20th, a week before the opening of the Pavlov conference on June 28th, Stalin appeared with his first Pravda contribution, which made him the star of all sci- ences. W.K. Matthews is surprised that Stalin's contribution did not close the linguis- tics discussion.7 But the "psychological" motive provides a reason: stretched with eu- logies on Stalin, the Pravda discussion, the climax of which preceded the Pavlov con- ference by a week, also outlasted its follow-up by a week. Stalin's concluding contri- bution to the linguistics discussion, in which he declared himself competent to remove any dogma, appeared on August 2nd; Ju.A. Zdanov presented his conclusions of the Pavlov conference in Pravda on July 28th.8 By aborting the planned Marr consecra- tion, enacting the Pravda discussion, and throwing in his personal weight, Stalin out- shone Ju.A. Zdanov's Pavlov conference by far. 1 Allilueva 1969a (3): 357; 1969b (3): 329. 2 Cf. Allilueva 1967b (17): 198-200: 1967a (17): 185. 3 The fact that Marr was regarded as a world-famous linguist is not surprising. In many countries, natural scientists embarking on science policy lose their bearings in the humanities and usually fall into the clutches of charlatans. The natural scientists tend to be particularly attracted by promises to reduce language to a finite set of universal rules or elements serving as building bricks for the infinite multiplicity of lin- guistic phenomena. 4 Allilueva 1969a (3): 348: 1969b (3): 320. 5 Allilueva 1967b (17): 192-193: 1967a (17): 179. 6 Allilueva 1967b (17): 198: 1967a (17): 183-184. 7 Matthews, W.K.. 1950b (8): 119. 8 Gordon 1951: 35.</page><page sequence="121">THE CONTEXT 99 Quite likely, this was not the only setback for Ju.A. Zdanov. In 1951 he published a long article in BoVSevik on "criticism and self-criticism" in science. The article docu- mented cases of celebrated bourgeois scientists who had eventually slowed down the development of their science because the social context had made them the slaves of their own theories, unable to be convinced by fresh views from younger scientists. This point was also worked out in Ju.A. Zdanov's 1948 paper mentioned above, which contained a covert attack on Lysenko. Several examples and sentences coincide. But in the 1951 paper some heroes and villains had shifted position. The German bacteri- ologist R. Koch, for example, was a progressive hero in 1948, disproving the theories of his fellow countryman R. Virchow. In 1951, Virchow was disproved by LepeSinskaja,1 while Koch was disproved by the Russian I.I. Meënikov.2 The 1951 paper proceeded to classify and criticize all methods by which criticism and self-criticism in Soviet science were prevented and neutralized. In the article, Ju.A. Zdanov not only extensively lauded Lysenko and attacked his opponents,3 he also praised the courage of LepeSinskaja and condemned the cowardice of the editors of the relevant journals, who kept sending her papers around for peer review for months on end so as to avoid publishing them,4 and of the thirteen cytologists who jointly signed a single article directed against her, ^thinking that science is a matter of numbers instead of arguments".5 Ju.A. Zdanov criticized Kedrov, the editor in chief of Voprosy filosofa who was removed after the Lysenko incident, for promoting the wrong kind of self-criticism and for allowing for conservative old scientists to criticize innovation,6 and criticized the chemists for ignoring the contributions of Celincev.7 In short, Ju.A. Zdanov attacked practically everyone we would expect him to support, and carried his arguments to a ridiculous extreme. rNowadays, as it is getting harder and harder to prevent the development of Bolshevik criticism in sci- ence, the remaining unconverted Arakõeevites apply the method of "neutralization" of criticism: the edi- torial boards of certain journals send an incoming critical paper for comment to ... the criticized person. Then, after smoothing out the sharp edges and toning down the formulations so as to "streamline" them, the paper appears in the journal, but accompanied by a reply from the scientist being criticized. Thus, in the Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics [Zurnal èksperímentaYnoj i teoretiöeskoj fiziki) (Vol. 21, number 9), S. Vernov, N. Dobrotin and T. Zacepin's paper The Problem of the Exis- tence of Varitrons", which criticizes the work of A. Alixanjan and A. Alixanov on cosmic rays, is sur- rounded by three papers from the criticized authors. Undoubtedly this happens with the aim of instant neutralization of the effect of the criticism.8 Graham suspects that, in this period, Ju.A. Zdanov was under severe pressure. When analysing a later paper from Ju.A. Zdanov,9 Graham even detects guarded ^soplan language, veiling his contempt for Lysenko and other miscarriages of Soviet science 1 Zdanov, Ju.A., 1951: 39. 2 Zdanov, Ju.A.. 1951: 33. 3 Zdanov, Ju.A., 1951: 38-39 and passim. 4 Zdanov.

Zdanov's cited criticism of old men and his quoted cata- logue of methods to sabotage Lysenko take-overs also allow for ^sopic interpreta- tions. Given the other data on Stalin's behaviour in the period, the linguistics discussion and a few other incidents in Soviet science policy may simply have been instances of young Zdanov bashing. Stalin may have behaved like a king in a Walt Disney fairy tale, but a nasty one, an aging godfather, striking out blows at anybody who is sus- pected as doubting his authority: and sons-in-law, receiving uncontrolled first-hand information on one's character, are extremely likely suspects. This psychological motive is of course quite speculative. But added to the other motives, the Pravda discussion as a whole makes an interesting piece of propaganda. Propaganda is usually interpreted as the art of getting messages across from commis- sioners to target groups. On account of this, Stalin's Pravda contributions were scanned for overt and covert messages from Stalin. But, in view of the circumstances, we cannot rule out the possibility that the Pravda contributions were in the first place addressed to Stalin himself. The present writer is inclined to regard the Pravda dis- cussion as a commissioned work of art, as there were so many in the period: a statue depicting Stalin, and endowing him with the attributes of various sorts of authority: - imperial authority (the czar of a multinational empire: after all, any self-respecting empire is multinational); - ideological authority (the dogma crusher); - scientific authority (the star of all sciences); - moral authority (the severe but fair judge of traitors); - divine authority (the Master of the Word in the crown of creation); - parental authority (my son-in-law is just a novice). Of course, a statue is made for the rest of the world to look at, but it encodes the commissioner's self-image. If this interpretation can be corroborated, then, even if Cikobava provided most of Stalin's linguistic analysis and Stalin himself contributed important words and sentences, the present writer suspects that Aleksandrov was the real sculptor of the Pravda discussion as a public relations event: a cynical philoso- pher acquainted with the classic themes and ^Esopic methods, seizes the opportunity to play a trick on Ju.A. Zdanov, the young upstart who, through his father's assault on Aleksandrov's magnum opus, had attacked the philosopher's ignorance of the natural sciences and was, once again, attempting to bring about his downfall. Nearly all Soviet work on the ideological implications of Stalin's work on linguistics was written or directed by Aleksandrov. As Gradobojew observes, rStalin clearly considered that Aleksandrov expressed what he wanted to say himself so precisely and aptly that there was nothing more to add".2 Whoever wrote Stalin's contribution, and whatever the motives for enacting the Pravda debate, there is little reason to presume that Stalin's behaviour was guided by a genuine interest in linguistics. Linguistics was just the appropriate material for the monument. It did not require a special competence; it had no intrinsic political inter- 1 Graham 1973n (Appendix 1): 448. 2 Gradobojew 1951:858.</page><page sequence="123">THE CONTEXT 101 est; in other fields of knowledge, the project would have risked falling into ideological traps, or producing Pethybridge's powerful intellectuals, new people to distrust later. But what difference does it make if a linguist is not a first class ideologist? Both Mar- rists and anti-Marrists were Stalin's ideal clowns. The irony of it all was perhaps sensed among MeSoaninov's associates. Two Festschrifts would be produced on the occasion of his 75th birthday, in 1958: one at the Academy of Sciences [Avrorin &amp; al. I960], and one in Leningrad, by his immediate colleagues [Amosova &amp; al. 1961]. In the preface to the Academy collection, it was pointed out that, like most linguists of his generation, MeSéaninov had been attracted by the problem of the relations between society, thought and language,1 but revery one of his works testifies to an even more consistent alienation from the work of his master",2 and, rwhen, after the discussion on the pages of Pravda, the basic tenets of the New Teaching on Language of Academician N. Ja. Marr were subjected to justified criticism, he took account of its conclusions and revised what he deemed erroneous even in his own views.3 The Leningrad address, on the other hand, contained the following laudatory passage. Hn the long war of the materialist philologists against the idealists you conducted the battle cautiously, like a Kutuzov [po-kutuzovski}, you were restrained in your triumph and calm in days of misfortune. And you never placed yourself above the others.4 L'Hermitte regards this passage as the reversal of the 1950 texts, but, in view of the chosen frame of reference, evoking wars, battles and Kutuzov, the passage may also be considered to contain various ironical allusions, and to refer to MeSoaninov's at- tempts to cope with Soviet science policy.5 S 0. 1 1 Soviet structuralism The impact of Stalin's work on linguistics made itself felt in abundant citations and quotations. However, with the exception of the basic lexical fund6 and a few remarks on the dialectal origins of Russian and Ukrainian, Stalin had not said anything original, 1 Zirmunskij &amp; Avrorin I960: 8. 2 Zirmunskii &amp; Avrorin I960: 9. 3 Zirmunskij &amp; Avrorin I960: 10. In 1953 in fact Mesõaninov self-criticized his earlier work on the cuneiform texts of Urartu-Biajny, but in a note the editors of Izvestija AN SSSR, OLiJa expressed the hope that he would also revise the methodological errors in his work on general linguistics [MeSõaninov 1953:2111. 4 L'Hermitte 1987 (3): 81. The translation is from the Russian original, which was kindly furnished to the present writer bv Professor L'Hermitte. 5 But the mystification goes on. The present writer consulted the Russian text of the same address in a bibliographically identical book which does not, however, contain the allusions to the Patriotic War. The corresponding passage, signed November 24, 1958, runs as follows. Hn the long polemic of the materialist philologists against the idealists you took up a principled stand, did not renounce your convictions, and never placed yourself above the others. [Glubokouvaiaemyj 1961: 5] How can this be explained? Apparently, there are two versions of MeSoaninov's Leningrad 75th birthday Festschrift: an uncensored one, which L'Hermitte consulted in the Academy Library (BAN) in Leningrad, and a censored one, consulted by the present writer in the library of Leiden University. Maybe the linguis- tics affair was still iudged too fresh for public irony. 6 Basic lexical fund: § 0.8.</page><page sequence="124">1 02 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER and therefore hardly affected the contents of "Stalinist" linguistic research, which consisted of comparative-historical work of gradually increasing quality,1 and of anti- structuralist diatribes. In any case, Stalin had little time to enjoy his status as the star of all sciences: he died on March 5th, 1953. After that date, the frequency of the ref- erences to his work rapidly dropped, and the few personal consequences of his ac- tions were reversed. Filin's career is quite typical here. In the 1930s, he wrote for Man* his thesis on el- ement analysis and the changing agrarian lexicon. Filin belonged to a minority of lin- guists with a party card (since 1939). He was one of the most aggressive Marrist pro- tagonists in the discussions of 1948 and 1949 but was absent at the January 1950 session, when the other Marrists were put through the hoop. Filin belonged to the edi- torial board of the 17-volume Academy dictionary, which the Marrists had taken over in the late thirties. Volume 1 of the dictionary appeared in 1948. Filin was still men- tioned in Volume 2 (1951) of the Academy dictionary, which had been prepared before the Pravda discussion, but his name disappeared in Volume 3 (1954). Like other Mar- rists, however, Filin survived attempts at further ostracism.2 In view of the long preparation time of the dictionary volumes, the technical consequences of the Pravda discussion only appeared in Volume 4 (1955), which was purged of Marrist perver- sions, such as grouping words in families instead of strict alphabetical order, and citing examples of normative usage in backward chronological order instead of start- ing from PuSkin.3 But the preface to Volume 4 mentions the exact date of Filin's "enter- ing" the editorial board: March 10th, 1954, i.e. a year after Stalin's death.4 From Vol- ume 6 onward, which appeared in 1957, Filin was president of the editorial board, which he would remain throughout. During this period, his contribution to the founda- tions of linguistics was restricted to an occasional dig, during a discussion at the Academy, at the excessive influence of the personality cult in Cikobava's [19532] handbook of linguistics.5 Filin woould only return to the arena of linguistics debates when the final Volume 17, which appeared in 1965, was completed: in 1964 he became the director of the Institute of Linguistics.6 In the meantime many things had changed. Destalinization was formally initiated in 1956, at the 20th congress of the Commu- nist Party. One of Stalin's major errors was the Leningrad affair, which made many 1 See Kiparsky 1963 for an account. Tronskij [1968: 111 in his survey of Soviet linguistics, points out that, as a result of the neglect of training of new Nachwuchs by the Marrists, original contributions only started appearing toward the end of the fifties. 2 Cf. O nekotoryx 1951, Sanzeev &amp; Cernyx 1952, or the review in the ideological journal BoVSevik of the anti-vulgarization collection Vinogradov &amp; Serebrennikov 1951, where it is remarked that Filin, in his [19511 contribution to this volume, ^limited himself to a general acknowledgement of his lack of scientific conscience and the "Arakceevan" character of his struggle with scientific opponents, and was not prepared to contribute, by a detailed, concrete analysis of his work, to the exposure of the damage to Soviet science inflicted by him" [Predislovie 1952: 41. 3 Slovar* 1955 (oredislovie): iii-iv. 4 Slovar* 1955 (predislovie): vii. 5 Cf. Grigor'ev, VP., 1957: 173. On the other hand, the work on the dictionary is criticized by the Institute of Linguistics, particularly by Vinogradov, who accuses the compilers of lack of co-ordination with Vinogradov's dictionary projects, such as the 4-volume Russian dictionary (cf. §0.10), which was com- pleted in 1956, and the PuSkin dictionary: cf.

The major discussions are reviewed in the second edition of the history of the Communist Party, which appeared in 1962. The philosophy discussion is treated as a milestone in the history of Marxism-Leninism.2 The linguistics discussion, on the other hand, is considered to contain ^faulty assertions as regards Marxist philosophical heritage with respect to the problem of the relation between the base and the superstructure". These are blamed on the personality cult.3 Within linguistics, destalinization was formally initiated in 1961, when an editorial in Voprosy jazykoznanija evaluated the history of Soviet linguistics and, while wholly rejecting Marr, discussed Stalin's errors.4 Yet Stalin's qualification of language as a societal phenomenon sui generis, i.e. not belonging to the superstructure, was viewed as a major attainment.5 The affair was laid to rest in 1963, when Vinogradov expounds "Stalin's" mistakes at a session of the Section of Literature and Language of the Academy of Sciences:6 Vinogradov's text contains the last occurrence of arakõeev- Sõina of which the present writer is aware. But few had waited for an official destalin- ization, not even the authorities. By then, new state priorities had already been im- posed on the field. When, at the 1945 Potsdam conference, Stalin learned of western projects to con- struct atomic bombs, he immediately had a Soviet research programme set up.7 Shortly after Hiroshima, natural scientists saw their salaries doubled or tripled,8 acquired access to the privileges of what would later be called the nomenklatura? and, as reported in §0.4, exacted exemption from ideological control. The scientists' ranks swelled with a speed which made Ashby worry about their average quality.10 Nevertheless the investments seemed to pay off almost immediately:11 the first nu- clear reactor was constructed in 1946; the first guided ballistic rocket was launched 1 In Ponomarev &amp; al. 19622 (16.2): 622-623 the Leningrad Affair is not mentioned by name, but a list of its most Drominent victims is given. 2 Ponomarev &amp; al. 19622 (16.2): 621. 3 Ponomarev &amp; al. 19622 (16.2): 624.

Then the influx of young researchers was curbed, while the total number of active researchers continued to rise until well into the 1970s. In that period, according to Kruse- Vaucienne &amp; Logsdon 1979 (1): 5, the number of Soviet scientists (over a million) was twice that of the United States. 11 There is disagreement as to the cause of this rapid success. Contemporary western popular press blamed it on espionage. According to Pálóczy-Horváth 1964 (1.4): 62-64, Stalin did not believe in atom bombs until Hiroshima. Pálóczy-Horváth attributes the rapid results of the nuclear research programme to the ini- tiative of Berija, the head of the secret police, who had secretly continued a nuclear research programme, conducted by imprisoned scientists, after its official discontinuation by Stalin around 1940. Pálóczy- Horváth points out that the prisoners, unlike regular scientists, were not under ideological control and, therefore, had access to western scientific literature. This explanation was often heard in the west in the 1950s and 1960s.

After Stalin's death, non-military applications were developed. The first nuclear power plant in the world was started up in 1954; Sputnik was launched in 1957. The impact on Soviet society and its scale of values was considerable. The national goal of "overtaking and surpassing"2 the west in technical matters, which had been launched in the 1930s, now suddenly seemed within reach. The success was generally ascribed to the policy model which the natural sciences had exacted for themselves: they had bestowed more prestige and benefits on the Soviet Union than the model which had been imposed upon the ideological and agricultural disciplines. The belief became established in that a high level of fundamental research enhances the pro- duction of useful applications. Expenditure on fundamental science increased drasti- cally.3 The prestige, financial benefits and freedom which accrued to the natural sciences invited other disciplines to imitate their success and to present themselves as exact sciences. This was boosted by certain developments in the economy and in science it- self. The success of the technical model coincided with setbacks in the economy. There were serious doubts as to whether a rationally and centrally planned socialist econ- omy would survive in conditions of peace and without absolute dictatorship. Every modification of the quantity of one commodity to be produced called for unending modifications in the quantities of others. Even a relatively decentralized economy seemed to have an insatiable demand for bookkeepers and administrators. [Around 1 957,1 academician [V.M.] Gluskov said that if things con- tinued as they were going, by 1980 the entire Soviet working population would be engaged in the planning and administrative process.4 The invention of the computer seemed to offer a new opportunity to rationalize pro- duction and its organization. The famous 1956 20th Party Congress not only initiated the first wave of destalinization, but also announced the automatization of technical processes and the construction of fully automatic plants.5 This triggered new demands on the part of the scientists and started a struggle in the Soviet science system and its interfaces with the central bureaucracy. The struggle involved the "philosophers" and the "cyberneticians", and ended in the triumph of the latter at the 1958 All-Union Conference of Philosophical Questions of the Natural Sciences.6 The term cybernetics will be returned to later in this section. cellent library facilities in regular Academy institutes. The present writer, having checked a few ency- clopaedia entries on leading Soviet physicists and mathematicians of the fifties, found that many Academy members among them entered the Academy between 1939 and 1946, while the Party members among them entered the Party between 1942 and 1946, but he is as yet unable to assess the statistical and historical significance of this observation. Documenting the external history of Soviet nuclear research would be an interesting project. * Under the direction of Alixanov, one of the varitron brothers (cf. §0.10). 2 This is the standard translation.

After 1930, the humanities and social sciences were taken over by the inheri- tors of the revolution, the Filins and Aptekar's, who were prepared to impose its val- ues on their environment. In that period the natural scientists, who were raised in the 19th-century tradition of academic liberalism, had succeeded in safeguarding it against infiltration, by holding on to their leading positions until well into their eight- ies: as Ashby observed in the 1940s, the natural sciences were a gerontocracy.1 At the same time, a new generation of Ashby's bright young minds had been attracted into the natural sciences by the scientific heroism which Stalin's propaganda had projected into the 19th-century;2 they had been raised to appreciate the values of scientific individualism, stubbornness, and to cultivate a drive for independence in re- gard to their societal context. These values could only be reinforced by the geronto- crats, but were not compatible with the other pillar of Stalin's science policy: the planned and co-ordinated collective production of science as propagated by S.I. Vavilov.3 Thus, there was a conflict between the set of propaganda values which had fascinated the scientists in their youth to the extent of making them want to become scientists, and the set of values which the outside world expected them to conform to after their having become scientists. In the 1950s, after the enormous impact of the carriers of the first set of values, the natural scientists could afford to ignore the second set. The parallel between the pre-revolutionary scientific heroism of the Stalinist propaganda and the situation of the 1950s was implicitly brought up in one of the most influential novels of the period, Dudincev's ¡Not by Bread Alone, which describes the desperate efforts of a Soviet engineer to obtain the recognition of the managers and bureaucrats for his inventions.4 Among the developments within science itself, the rise of cybernetics is of particu- lar interest: this "discipline" became a vehicle for the spread of academic and techno- cratic liberalism. Initially, when Wiener launched his new discipline in his homony- mous book in 1948,5 and Dubarle started a discussion on its political potential with his machine à gouverner in the same year,6 the Soviets regarded cybernetics as a deca- dent idealist bourgeois trend, a "reactionary pseudo-science",7 along with structural- ism and relativity theory. But its status rose steadily after 1955, and cybernetics ended up being adopted as the new super science at the 22nd Party congress, in 196 1.8 The impact of cybernetics in the Soviet Union was due to its ambiguity: it had rapidly developed into a fuzzy concept, uniting the interests of a coalition of scientists and bureaucrats. 1 Cf. §0.4. 2 Cf. §0.9. 3 Cf. §0.9. 4 Dudincev 1956/1968. 5 Wiener 196 12. 6 Dubarle 1948; cf.

Zdanov, who had retired into science after Stalin's death, but continued to make occasional excursions into dialectical materialism [Graham 1973n (Appendix l&gt;. 448].</page><page sequence="128">1 06 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER What cybernetics really is matters less than what it represented to the various forces in Soviet society. Cybernetics purported to provide the mathematical principles which prevent complex dynamic systems from turning into disorder. One of the con- cepts which fascinated the bureaucrats was feedback:1 an agent who is responsible for a system but is not fully informed on its parameters (the famous black box turns up here) produces an action which affects the system, receives information on the impact of his action on the behaviour of the system, and uses the information in adjusting the behaviour of the system by means of a subsequent action. In the most caricatural version of cybernetics, complex systems are run by a single centre, equipped with computers which process gigantic amounts of information. In a more sophisticated version, complex systems are composed of largely "se If -régulât ing" subsystems, with autonomous sub-agents which serve as filters for feedback to the higher level. Infor- mation from a subsystem may trigger actions on the level of the subsystem or be re- layed to a higher level. The actions of the higher level affect the subsystems in a less detailed but more essential way. The implications of cybernetics for the conditions of the scientists were obvious. While the ideological constraints of the 1940s imposed a conception of research as the practical application of established theoretical frameworks, devised outside the discipline itself, and ran the risk of limiting the function of the sciences to establishing a taxonomy of phenomena in terms of the imposed theory, the blackbox approach of cybernetics legitimized theoretical uncertainty. The feedback principle provided the freedom to experiment, to express and exchange hunches and verify them by empiri- cal evidence. Apparently, there were enough scientists who preferred this approach. The bureaucrats associated cybernetics with computers and technological progress, but the scientists promised more. The advantages of the caricatural version of cybernetics were obvious: a prestigious exact science presupposes a principal agent who receives all the feedback and, with the aid of computers, converts it into effective instructions. This gave the Soviet Union a lead: in contrast to capitalist so- cieties, socialist societies already had a principal agent. Cybernetics would provide the central bureaucrats with the computers and methods to run complex modern so- cialist economies. Cybernetics would justify, preserve and reinforce the advantages of centralized systems. But, even in its sophisticated version, cybernetics supports the socialist model. The very use of the term system, however open, dynamic and complex systems may be, presupposes a vantage point outside the system and legitimizes positing an agent, an active subject, on this vantage point. Moreover, the cyberneticians, when conceiving of complex systems, made no effort to avoid the tree metaphor in representing their inner structure: even decentralization presupposes a centre and a hierarchical orga- nization. The sophisticated approach even held out the promise of making central control a relatively simple matter: when autonomous decentrai actors do the dirty work, and filter and convert local information into manageable formats, the central actor may confine himself to giving the rough directions that matter. As Graham puts it, cybernetics "places a premium on combining two seemingly contradictory princi- 1Cf. Dahm 1964: 11-13.</page><page sequence="129">THE CONTEXT 107 pies: local control based on empirical evidence and overriding centralized purposes".1 The administrators could have their cake and eat it too. Cybernetics restored the wa- vering faith in over-all planning. This rebirth of hope was the explanation of the intoxication with cybernetics in the Soviet Union in the late fifties; in the period after 1958 thousands of articles, pamphlets and books on cybernetics ap- peared in the Soviet press. In the more popular articles the full utilization of cybernetics was equated with the advent of communism and the fulfillment of the revolution. If the curious mixture of ideology and politics in the Soviet Union can upon occasion affect certain sciences adversely - as it did at one time with genetics - it can also catapult others to unusual prominence.2 As an additional asset, cybernetics presented itself as a superdiscipline. Its principles were to a large extent independent of specific fields of knowledge. The systems which were supposed to be governed by its rules could be of a social, biological or psycho- logical nature, or could be technical artefacts: cybernetics offered a haven to the corresponding disciplines. The cyberneticians actively encouraged other disciplines to join them. The renowned mathematician A.N. Kolmogorov pointed out that the problems of psychol- ogy, sociology and political economy could be solved by the method of cybernetics.3 The cultural journals, too, were filled with discussions on the possibility of applying cybernetics to art and literature.4 At a conference devoted to the use of mathematics in literature,5 Kolmogorov dazzled his audience with the calculation that an automaton with 1020 states would be capable of "creating" Evgenij Onegin, PuSkin's chef-d'œvre, at least assuming the human brain to have 1012 different states and estimating the number of human generations previous to Puákin to be 108. Among the humanities, Stalin's transfer of linguistics from the superstructure to the ideological void gave linguistics a headstart. An important factor was the availability of specific problems to be tackled: the rise of cybernetics had nurtured the conviction that machine translation and other forms of language-orientated artificial intelligence were within reach. In 1955, IBM's well-publicized fake experiment in machine trans- lation6 was described in Voprosy jazykoznanijaJ The putative success of the experi- ment was attributed to the western lead in cybernetics and structuralism. In 1956, an "open" discussion on structuralism was opened, the chief question being whether structuralist methods are at variance with Marxist principles.8 A 1957 session of the "Scientific Council" of the Institute of Linguistics on synchronie and diachronic lin- guistics, which focused on "Saussureanism" and structuralism, drew 400 participants from outside the institute.9 This time dogmatism was discarded at the initiative of the 1 Graham 1973n (9* 328. 2 Graham 1973n (Si 329. 3 Pálóczv-Horváth 1964 (1.6.1): 92. 4 Pálóczv-Horváth 1964 (1.6.1): 93-94. 5 Revzin 1962d [4k 232. 6 Cf.

In 1958 the Bureau of the Section of Literature and Language of the Academy of Sciences decided to promote the application of structural methods.1 Mathematical methods are emphasized in programmatic editorials in Voprosy jazykoznanija,2 and, with reference to the decisions on technical progress made at the 20th Party Congress, mathematical linguists started appealing for funding and new departments.3 As in the old days, a Soviet engineer, P.P. Trojanskij (or Smirnov-Trojanskij), was found to have patented the translation machine as early as 1933.4 According to I.A. Mel'ouk and O.S. Kulagina, who were early advocates for machine translation in the 1950s, Trojanskij had attempted in vain to interest linguists in his invention in 1939; his proposals were finally turned down in 1944, when, as Mel'ouk and Kulagina sug- gest, linguistically illiterate technicians claimed to prove the linguistic impossibility of the project.5 Structuralism, too, was annexed: MeSõaninov was declared the father of Soviet structuralist grammar.6 As hardware was scarce in the Soviet Union, a tremendous upsurge in theoretical work ensued.7 An extremely broad interpretation of the term structural method was used, to include just about any form of non-Marrist synchronie linguistics except traditional grammar; this turned Soviet linguistics into the busiest marketplace for ideas, both foreign and home-grown. V.A. Zvegincev played an important role here. He published several books on past and alien linguistic traditions, edited numerous read- ers, and had many classics of European and American 20th-century linguistics trans- lated8 (in the series Novoe v lingvistike). In contrast to earlier paradigmatic shifts, "structuralism" produced many new names in Soviet linguistics.9 Numerous confer- ences and seminars were organized.10 A major conference on machine translation, in 1958, was attended by hundreds of representatives from 79 institutions.11 1 Cf. Arutjunova &amp; Klimov 1968: 156, O rabotax I960: 77. Note that "structuralism" continues to be sus- pect we are talking about "structural istrukturnyj) methods". 2 E.g.

Nikolaeva 1958: 151. 4 Panov, D.Ju., 1959 contains the original proposals, patents and technical schemes pertaining to Trojan- skij's invention. Mel'ouk &amp; Ravie [1967: 2] also mention a translation machine which was invented in Tallina Estonia, in 1924. 5 Cf. Zirkov 1956: 122. 6 Degtereva's survey devotes 24 pages to structuralism in grammar, six of which are devoted to MeSõani- nov, who was reported to have developed a materialist Soviet variety of structuralism disguised in Marrist terminology, even when Marr was still alive: cf. Degtereva 1964 (3): 71-76. Of course, structuralist pho- nology is ascribed to the Kazan' School of J. Baudouin de Courtenay and M. Kruszewski, who also influ- enced de Saussure [Degtereva 1964 (1.1): 8-91 The observation that Baudouin de Courtenay's work triggered any and all approved western European innovations of the first half of the 20th century is commonplace in Soviet histories of linguistics: cf., for example, Amirova &amp; al. 1975 (6.4): 455, or Amirova &amp; al. 1980 (8- 8.1): 417-430, especially 426-229. 7 In view of the high cost of verifying experiments manually, programming was conceived of as a highly theoretical discipline. 8 Chomsky's work started appearing in Russian in the early sixties: cf. Chomsky 1962, 1972. 9 Lepschy 1967/1981: 100-101 contains a useful survey of the affiliations of at least the top of the iceberg. 10 An impressive list of major conferences on all aspects of theoretical linguistics in the late fifties and early sixties is given in Arutjunova &amp; Klimov 1968: 156-157. 11 Cf. Harper 1963(2): 134.</page><page sequence="131">THE CONTEXT 109 In 1960, the new type of linguistic research was embedded in the science system. Sections, departments and chairs of structural methods, mathematical linguistics and language statistics were established at several universities and Academy institutions, while mathematicians were invited to work at them.1 In a sense, mathematicians had taken linguistics over from the philosophers. Counter to expectation, they were not the type of second rate mathematician who tends to undertake a cross-over to a fashionable soft science. Kolmogorov himself triggered two trends in Soviet humani- ties.2 Most of the new linguists, on the other hand, were young and had been trained by the more principled linguists of the 1950 affair, including A.A. Xolodoviõ and, es- pecially, P.S. Kuznecov, who had been victimized by the Marrists, had taken up a principal stance, and had not gained from Stalin's intervention. The new Soviet structuralists adopted a lateral approach to western linguistic trends. They often produced ideas which seem to have been inspired by conceptions which arrived from the west but were utilized in a surprisingly different manner. This can perhaps be explained by the fact that four decades of Western linguistics (as well as pre-Marrist Soviet work and the work of the emigré Russians of the Prague School) were simultaneously explored and absorbed: western concepts and conceptions could be studied, adopted and compared without regard to their chronological order and the social, fashionable and institutional context in which they were developed; they were taken for what they were worth in a tabula rasa frame of reference. To the Soviet lin- guists of the sixties, N. Chomsky was only one of the partners in a linguistic debate which was initiated by J. Baudouin de Courtenay and Saussure; he represented a va- riety of American structuralism, not a revolutionary new doctrine. We must keep in mind that, whereas western linguistics in the sixties tended towards group formation and paradigmatic conformity,3 Soviet theoretical linguists were thoroughly enjoying and exploring their pluralism. There is no single dominant school or trend. The only thing which most publications have in common is the use of mathematical symbols or the claim to be employing formal methods. Some linguists present elaborate sketches of wholesale linguistic conceptions, which are worked out in detail by others. Examples of such trends are Andreev's sta- tistical-combinatorial model,4 Saumjan's applicational generative grammar,5 and recognition modelling as practiced by T.N. MoloSnaja, T.M. Nikolaeva and E.V. Padu- õeva in the earlier period.6 In other instances, we can speak of schools, where lin- guistic conceptions develop by mutual influence between large numbers of partici- pants; examples are the Tartu School of generative grammar,7 the semiotic school of V.V. Ivanov and V.N. Toporov,8 and Kulagina's Set-theoretical School. Some linguists, 1 Grigor'ev, V.R, 1960. 2 Viz. the Set-theoretical School, which is the suject of this study, and a trend in verse theory, see Lilly &amp; Scherr's [1976] survey for references on the latter. 3 Cf.

Apres jan, are not associated with a particular school.1 Although the conceptual frameworks diverge widely between schools, their exponents continue to communicate with each other. Some linguists contribute to more than one approach; I.I. Revzin, an exponent of the Set-theoretical School, also contributed to the Tartu School. The self-confidence of the new linguists is testified to by their use of non-linguis- tic, mathematical terminology, especially at the earlier stages. Their contempt for the Marxist hobbyhorse of materialism, as opposed to idealism and formalism, is ex- pressed by the use, in several conceptions, of the word model as a token of disinter- est in the precise relationship between their constructs and reality. This period of Soviet linguistics represents a goldmine, which has only partly been explored. Even listing a representative sample of research trends and networks in Soviet theoretical linguistics of the period is beyond the scope of this study. The west paid relatively little attention to the Soviet contributions to theoretical linguistics. The earliest work is represented in Abernathy's and Harper's 1963 surveys. In 1966, the Hungarian Papp published a survey of what had appeared until then.2 The scope of the critical survey by his compatriot Kiefer, which was published in 1968, is more limited as to the number of trends reviewed.3 Lepschy 's 1967/1981 survey provides valuable bibliographical references. L'Hermitte 1969a contains a survey, as well as a few translations. Kiefer edited some collections of translated papers from the early seventies;4 Girke &amp; Jachnow 1976 contains more recent papers, both translated and original. Kortlandt 1972 provides a complete in-depth review of the Eastern European output of the period on phonemics.5 A reasonable amount of Soviet structuralist work is available in translation. Some early work is found in cover-to-cover translations of Soviet technical-scientific jour- nals, which started appearing after Sputnik.6 Apresjan's and Saumjan's major works were translated at an early stage,7 as well as some minor works by Revzin and Mel'ouk.8 There is an early English translation of the book Exact Methods in Linguis- tic Research? In the 1980s, English translations appeared of Gladkij &amp; Mel'ouk's Ele- 1 Après jan 1973b is an important book. 2 Papp 1966. 3 Kiefer 1968. 4 Kiefer 1973a; Kiefer 1973b. Kiefer 1973a contains a large number of printing errors and some of the translation is rather inadequate. 5 Kortlandt 1972. 6 Terminological usage in such translations is sometimes misleading. The title of the 1960 English ver- sion of Kulagina 1958, for example, uses group theory instead of set theory. 7 Apres jan 1971, 1973a, and 1973b are translations of Apres jan 1966. Saum jan 1971b is a translation of Saum jan 1965. Cf. also the translations of Saumjan's work in L'Hermitte &amp; Wlodarczyk 1974. Saumjan's later positions are published in English: cf. Saumjan 1977, 1987. 8 There are English [1966b] and French [1968] translations of Revzin's first monograph, Models of Lan- guage [1962a]. But this work is rather unsophisticated in comparison with his major work, Metod modeli- rovanija ... [1967b]; the latter work was, most unfortunately, never translated, although a small fragment appeared in L'Hermitte 1969a: cf. Revzin 1969a. Mel'ouk 1976 contains German and English translations of scattered papers, the originals of which appeared over a long period of time. 9 Axmanova &amp; al. 1961, Axmanova &amp; al. 1963.</page><page sequence="133">THE CONTEXT 1 1 1 ments of Mathematical Linguistics, the original of which appeared in 1969,1 and of work on the meaning «=* text model of Mel'ouk and A.K. Zolkovskij.2 Fortunately, many ideas which originated during the flourishing period of Soviet theoretical linguistics can be recognized in recent work by Mel'ouk published in English.3 Western interest in Soviet linguistics of the period rarely exceeds the level of cu- riosity. If reviews and translations were rare in the West, active participation in the Soviet discussion by Western linguists hardly ever occurred. Translations go without comment and reviews provide only general characteristics, although Kortlandt's book on phonology,4 L'Hermitte's and Wlodarczyk's work on Saumjan's applicational gen- erative grammar,5 and Kiefer's 1968 general survey are notable exceptions. Hardly any Soviet proposals were integrated into western linguistic work. In this respect, Soviet theoretical linguistics differs not only from earlier Russian and East European work (and from the Soviet work of the 1920s, which was more influential irt the west than in the Soviet Union itself), but also from Soviet descriptive and comparative lin- guistics, the contributions of which have been integrated into the global network since about 1960. This contrast may be due to: - the decreasing knowledge of East European languages among leading theoretical linguists; or: - the high thresholds for personal exchange imposed by the Iron Curtain, which are more of an obstacle in the communication pattern of theoretical linguistics than in that of descriptive and comparative linguistics; or: - the opposite trends in Eastern and Western theoretical linguistics of the sixties: toward paradigmatic diversification in the east, but toward greater uniformity in the west. S 0.12 Neo-Marrism As Seduro predicted in 1954, "it is simply inconceivable that the present tack could last for long; some day there must come another "Arakõeev regime"".6 Contextual factors had been responsible for the flourishing period of Soviet theoretical linguis- tics which set out in the fifties. Similarly, contextual factors would be responsible for its discontinuation in the seventies. The policy changes which accompanied XruSoev's fall, in 1964, made themselves felt. The failure of economic modernization took away much of the splendour of XruSoev's technology policy. After a period of oscillation, a new consistent policy line crystallized around 1970: instead of striving to overtake and surpass the west, Soviet power again retreated to the ideological justification of Soviet society and ended up in embracing the conservative myth of "existing (real'nyj) socialism" as the highest mo- 1 But French, Spanish and German translations appeared in the early seventies: Cf.

Communism, which XruSõev forecasted within a decade or two, was now moved beyond the horizon: but things would be worse without our socialism. With hindsight, it may be surmised that it was at that moment that Soviet Power definitively resigned from developing a long-term strategy for the development of Soviet society as a whole and decided to eat into its stocks. Science was one of the first areas to be affected by the new stagnation. Its enor- mous growth could no longer be sustained; it had let the Party down anyway by failing to offer technical solutions for the socialist economy and by losing the race for the Moon. The party was over for fundamental research. The Party organizations within the scientific institutions were held responsible for guaranteeing the ultimately ap- plied goals of science, which were considered to be interwoven with its ideological goals. The 1970 Lebedev Decree is considered to mark the policy shift. As in the old days, the Central Committee picked a specific institute for its criticism: it censured the party committee of the Lebedev Physics Institute for failing to carry out adequate political education work, for exerting insufficient influence on the deployment of per- sonnel within the institute, and for playing an insufficiently prominent part in the con- duct of research, the quality of which was claimed to have been impaired as a conse- quence.1 Since the Lebedev Institute employed the well-known dissident physicist A.D. Saxarov, the "lessons" were immediately clear. The new party rules as presented at the 1971 24th Party Congress considerably enhanced the powers of the party or- ganizations in the research institutes and universities to control teaching and re- search.2 The party's strategic policy consisted of having leading posts occupied by Party members. One of the instruments was the new rule on academic standards, ac- cording to which only dissertations considered to be of scientific and practical value, submitted by people who had proved their worth in scientific production and public work, would be considered. The reference to public work meant that the criterion of political reliability was explicitly introduced into the system of awarding higher de- grees.3 The immediate effects of the new line included an explosion of committees controlling each other,4 a 10% rise, within less than a decade, in Party membership among those holding the doctorates,5 and a 30% fall in Jewish postgraduate students (in a constant overall total) between 1970 and 1973.6 In the 1960s, expectations of forthcoming machine translation and other forms of language technology had collapsed.7 In the West this was not so much of a problem. 1 Kneen 1984 (7): 84-85. 2 Kneen 1984 (7&gt;. 86. 3 Kneen 1984 (7): 89. 4 Kneen 1984 (71 91. 5 Kneen 1984 (7): 90. The Soviet doctorate corresponds to the German "Habilitation"; the Anglo-Saxon PhD corresponds to the Soviet candidate's degree. Note that the rise, from 59% to 69% between 1972 and 1980, concerns the group holding the degree; the rise among those obtaining the degree must have been much larger. If we assume, for example, that the share of late recruitments for party membership was neg- ligible, that the 1970 distribution was stable, and that doctors remain in the system for about 30 years, it must have become practically impossible to obtain the degree without a party card. 6 Kneen [1984 (3): 30] has found these figures in official Soviet statistics. 7 In the United States the collapse was triggered by the report of the Automatic Language Advisory Committee, which was established by the National Academy of Sciences and consisted of technicians,</page><page sequence="135">THE CONTEXT 113 On the one hand, failure to develop specific cybernetic applications was permanently balanced by spectacular breakthroughs in hardware, which became smaller, faster and cheaper, and held out prospects of more successful attempts in the future.1 On the other hand, western theorists could back out, defiantly proclaim themselves fun- damental linguists,2 and expand on student numbers instead of defense grants. In the Soviet Union, however, the development of computers ground to a halt,3 leaving the cyberneticians without backing, whereas linguists could only implicitly and apologeti- cally acknowledge that machine translation was far beyond the horizon of linguistics, and that what they were really doing was not quite what society expected them to. These circumstances left the structuralist linguists in a vulnerable position. After the 1950 episode, Soviet linguistics would never be a normal discipline. As the Pravda discussion had not produced a real purge, the people who dominated the science and culture policy system in the late forties were still there; they could even pose as vic- tims of Stalinism.4 As Raskin points out, linguistic terminology was burdened by vari- ous histories and loyalties: terms had to be avoided or inserted, depending on one's affiliation, and could hardly be used for matter-of-fact discussion.5 The Humboldtian problems of the relationships between language and thought and between language and society, for which the Marrists had claimed the monopoly, continued to be studied in philosophical circles. The "intruders" during the 1948-1949 Marrist offensive, such as Spirkin and Reznikov, published in titles which paraphrased Marr's slogans, such as ¡Thought and Language,6 or ¡Concept and Word,1 which dealt with general problems arising in the conceptual space which includes semiotics, logic, thought, cognition, mind, society, language, ideology, and the indissolubility of these phenomena, while avoiding formalization, quantification and linguistic data.8 In 1964, Degtereva completes her three-volume survey of modern linguistics.9 Marr is rejected, but several of his ideas (such as the crossing-like consequences of a long-standing Caucasian-Indo-European symbiosis10 ) are adopted in a moderate form. Filin's and Abaev's work of the late forties is extensively praised.11 Stalin and his "con- sultants" are accused of insufficient dialectical thinking.12 In the 1964 volume, computer linguists and traditional linguists. The report notes that there is no immediate or predictable prospect of useful machine translation [Pierce &amp; aL 1966: 32]. 1 In the Benelux countries, various research programmes promising full-fledged machine translation were supported as late as the 1980s by the national and European authorities as well as private companies, such as Philips, Siemens and BSO [Van Kasteren 1992, Herten &amp; al. 1992]. But the same organizations were not prepared to contribute to realistic translation tools such as electronic dictionaries. 2 Cf.

Br0ndal, whose ideas on panchronism2 and saltatory mutations in cer- tain aspects resemble Marr's ideas.3 In the Soviet Union, this trend is represented by MeSöaninov. But there is also a decadent idealist structuralism, represented by Br0n- dal's compatriot L. Hjelmslev and his glossematics, which abstracts from reality. fAnd, while in all countries linguists adopt a rather sober attitude toward Hjelmslev, [...] the paradoxical fact occurs that precisely in the Soviet Union, the country of the Marxist materialist Weltanschauung, we find his active and fanatic followers. It is bitter and insulting that his followers, headed by S.K. Saumjan, include [...] talented young linguists, who might quite effectively develop the science of lan- guage in the correct direction. But instead they are now engaged in generating cunning abstruseness and in exuberant coinage of terms, which they regard as the process of creating a new linguistics, as the real science of language instead of the amateurish babbling which, in the opinion of the second "captain {void')' of this group, I.A. Mel'ouk, has hitherto carried the name of linguistics. Some little old ladies, terrified by such statements, convulsively seek to algebraize à la Hjelmslev particular aspects of partial subdisciplines of linguistics. Never mind the old ladies: they are happy with the pseudo-scientific for- mula-like expression of their stereotyped little thoughts, and there is a hope that their exercises in al- gebra will provoke a healthy reaction among the linguistics youth and deaden its interest for similar [izomorfiõeskifi constructions, which have nothing in common with profound scientific analysis of language.4 And Degtereva goes on to criticize the structuralists' attempts to provide new defini- tions of long-standing and fully transparent concepts, and the "terminomania" of the structuralist schools.5 Also, she criticizes models as purely fictitious constructs.6 Revzin's argument that the study of the correspondences between a model and reality enhances the cognitive value of the model is considered part of a vicious circle. Having analysed Hjelmslev's perversion of structuralism, Degtereva concludes that the end of the structuralist stage in linguistics has been reached. Structuralism in all its healthy forms has fulfilled its mission in the development of linguistics, and now it is time for its negation [in the dialectical sense] by the next stage in the development in linguis- tic thought the stage of Marxist linguistics.7 Degtereva provides a rough impression of what Marxist linguistics must look like. The keywords are concrete and material Language consists of sounds and a lexicon: the most important property to be studied is the way in which the mental activities of a 1 Degtereva 1961 (predislovie): 6-7; 1964: 76. 2 Degtereva 1964 (1.3): 65-66. Cf. Bandai 1939: 8. Ever since Cemodanov's Marrist and anti-structuralist 1947 paper, the first issue of Acta linguistica, which contains Bandai 1939 and Hjelmslev 1939/19712, constituted the Soviet frame of reference for structuralism. 3 Degtereva 1964 (1.3): 71. Cf. Bandai 1939: 5. 4 Degtereva 1964 (1.4): 82. 5 The expression used is Skoly i Skolki: 'schools and little schools'. It goes back to Lenin and was regularly used by Marrists to qualify their opponents. 6 Degtereva 1964 (2.1): 95-96. Quantitative linguistics, too, gets a lashing: in (2.1): 97-98, an anonymous foreign frequency count is adduced which yields gospodin ('mister', 'Lord') and bd^CGod') as the most fre- quent words of Russian, and is meant to show that quantitative linguists do not take into account the so- cio-economic structure of the society which carries a language. 7 Degtereva 1964 (1.4): 85.</page><page sequence="137">THE CONTEXT 115 society are fixed in language, and the capacity of a collective to transmit such activi- ties from one generation to the next.1 Degtereva's examples of society-determined human thought as reflected in language suggest that, at last, a version of Marr's palaeontology was found which could be made acceptable to schoolteachers. She points out that the word boFSój ('great1, 'big') has recently acquired the meaning of 'public', 'participated in by all the people (obãõenarodnyjY, as in bol'Sój razgovór, 'a broad, public discussion': this runderscores the particularly important, decisive role of participation by all the people in our public life".2 On the other hand, the use of the word prédki ('ancestors') instead of roditeli ('parents') in the speech of certain groups of youngsters, Emphasizes the age difference and, indirectly, the difference in perception imirooSöuSöenie) between fa- thers and sons. This hyperbolization distorts the actual relationship between fathers and sons in our so- ciety, in which the gulf which divided Turgenev's fathers and sons is absent. The image of the abyss between fathers and sons arose in the intellectually poor heads of young teddy-boys istiljaga) and spongers {tune jadee): this has condemned the new meaning of prédki to the cachectic life of a jar- gonism.3 And Degtereva takes another 44 words to qualify the vulgarity and the fleetingness of the new use of prédki. Degtereva's survey, which is a strange mixture of linguistic sophistication and pas- sages of the type quoted above, would not be worth quoting if it did not happen to be an early symptom of a new climate, which accompanied the deposing of Xruáõev in the same year. The survey was written not for a linguistics audience, but for the Academy of Social Sciences at the Central Committee of the Communist Party (AON).4 It affects and reflects the frames of reference of the people who make the long-term decisions, and sets the terms in which the structuralists may be attacked and must defend them- selves.5 Degtereva formulates the arguments which will last for all future debates on Soviet linguistics and picks the winners and losers of musical chairs games which will only take place in the next decade. Interestingly, her main target is Saum jan, the only structuralist who always took care to provide a thorough Marxist-Leninist basis for his theories.6 As early as 1966, L'Hermitte points to other symptoms of the changing climate.

V.Z. Panfilov, a relatively young linguist, em- phasizes that diversity in linguistics is all right but only on a unitary philosophical ba- sis.3 The Bureau of Literature and Language insists on a broad discussion on the problem of "language and thought".4 The ensuing debate is typical for the post-XruSõev climate: it does not concentrate on the importance of "language and thought" but on the lack of relevance of struc- turalism and mathematical methods. In 1965 Abaev and Filin launch their attacks on structuralism, which contains several elements of Degtereva's analysis. Abaev, who ventured to publish a balanced paper on Marr as early as 1960, ac- cuses structural linguists of following fashions and neglecting tradition5 (an accusa- tion which recalls Aleksandrov's and Stalin's arguments, and contrasts with Abaev's own 1936 diatribe against old-fashioned linguists which was quoted in §0.6), and of the familiar sin of formalism6 (an accusation which recalls A.A. Zdanov's arguments, tallies with Abaev's 1936 accusations, and is easily inspired by the structuralists' predilec- tion for formalization). Structuralism was "linguistics in the void (lingvistika v pus- toteYJ The real linguistics should be restored as a human and social, i.e. ideological, discipline, based on Marxism. Abaev's paper, which contains the famous fish canning comparison (if fish canning does not open a new era in ichthyology, why would stenog- raphy or machine translation open a new era in linguistics?), not only produces a dis- cussion in Voprosy jazykoznanija, with numerous participants,8 but is also translated9 and discussed in the west.10 Film's less imaginative but more dangerous activities are largely ignored, perhaps because he has just become the director of the Institute of Linguistics. His attack,11 published prior to Abaev's, only arouses the attention of Revzin, who points to the similarity of Filin's 1965 qualifications of structuralism to those formulated in 1948 with reference to the lessons drawn from the Lysenko discussion.12 In 1965, Filin or- ganizes an interdisciplinary seminar on Language and Thought, which is attended by philosophers, linguists, psychologists, physiologists and "semioticists", and may be 1 Cf.

In the news- paper Izvestija, the mathematician DobruSin, whose contributions to the Set-theoreti- cal School will be treated in § 2.2. 18f f., describes a deplorable state of affairs in lin- guistics.5 The development of cybernetic applications in linguistics is coming to a halt; engineers and mathematicians work to the best of their knowledge, but the stagnation is due to linguistic problems, not cybernetic ones. Linguistics, however, is dominated by middle-aged and older people: the youngest linguist with a doctorate in the Academy Institute of Russian is over 50 years old. The older linguists possess a great deal of useful experience but have no interest in today's vital problems and know nothing about mathematics and technology. It is impossible to defend theses in mathe- matical or structural linguistics for lack of academically qualified specialists to staff the committees. In the Academy Institute of Linguistics, only three out of over a hun- dred linguists have adopted structuralist methods. At most universities, applied lin- guistics is practiced by mathematically incompetent people. Dobruáin considers gloomy the prospects of raising good modern linguists as long as university pro- grammes do not split linguistic studies and literature, and as long as the humanities departments continue to cater for pupils who are weak in mathematics. Soviet linguis- tics must be reorganized and become a useful science.6 The discussion is apparently without far-reaching consequences.7 If anything, So- viet formal linguistics develops an apologetic style, which distinguishes it from what Murray calls the "eclipsing stance" of many of their Western contemporaries.8 Many 1 It was at this conference that Spirkin expressed his opinion that Marr's 1950 condemnation had been un- justified (cf. §0.9). The earliest occurrence of the term neo-Marrism of which the present writer is aware is found in Gadet 1977 ('&gt;. 63. 2 Filin &amp; al. 1967. 3 Filin 1966/1968: 6. 4 Filin 1966/1968: 20. As an argument he adduces the drop in the circulation of Voprosy jazykoznanija. In fact circulation was stable since 1961 (imprints are missing in the 1959 and 1960 issues) and was even rising in 1966. It is also improbable that social scientists would not be discouraged by the papers on, say, proto-Kartvelian, which made up an equally substantial ingredient of the journal. 5 DobruSin 1966. 6 DobruSin 1966; cf. also Losev 1968: 62. 7 The 1968 reprint of Filin 1966/1968 contains a passage, which does not occur in the Voprosy jazyko- znanija version, on the possibility of an administrative ban on structuralism. Filin suggests [1966/1968: 221 that imputing to him the intention to impose such a ban is part of the structuralists' malicious attempts to indemnify themselves from any criticism. 8 Murray 1980: 84. The term eclipsing stance, referring to a specific way of dealing with alternative paradigms, goes back to Voegelin &amp; Voegelin 1963 (Ok 12-13.

Some linguists develop a kind of crypto-structuralism: after all, this attitude was now ascribed to MeSõaninov and officially sanctioned. Zaliznjak, whose ideas, when for- malized, not only turn out to fit into the Set-theoretical School but even represent a major contribution to it,1 refrains from the use of any terms which might evoke asso- ciations with mathematics. But most linguists continue to refer to automatic process- ing, algorithms and black-box models, references which Raskin interprets as a noli me tangere warning to the traditionalist Cerber "Leave me alone! Whatever I say, I am all right because / am useful for the people's economy, and a quiet insinuation added whisperingly between the lines, 'are you?2 The mathematician Srejder illustrates the dilemma of this attitude. He denounces the "nihilist dogmas" which are opposed to any application of exact methods in linguistics, but dissociates himself from the rnaive cybernetic belief" in artificial intelligence, which he compares to the alchemists' belief in the Philosophers1 Stone. But, as the search for the Philosophers' Stone was the foundation of modern chemistry, the at- tempts to construct thinking machines are leading to serious studies on the principles of the organization of living organisms.3 Srejder continues: stance "progress consists not so much in the addition of new concepts as in the gradual sharpening and dif- ferentiation of hitherto blurred notions" [Chao 1962: 558]. The eclipsing stance implies that existing Daradtems need no longer be taken seriously. 1 See §3.2.23 to §3.2.31, §3.3.15, and, particularly, §5.10 to §5.37. 2 Raskin 1978: 268; original italics. 3 Srejder 1969 (1): 129. The invocation of mediaeval science as an apology of formal linguistics is a topos which has accompanied formal linguistics from the very outset: it is found in the foreword of Lincbax's [1916 (predislovie): ìli] work on artifical semiotic systems. There are two ways in which the analogy alchemy : chemistry = machine translation : formal linguistics (0.12.1) is used for justifying formal linguistics. Optimists, such as Lincbax and the French philosopher Benzecri [1966 (6): 370], seem to assume that some centuries of alchemy were a necessary precondition for the rise of chemistry, which implies that employing such labels as machine translation or automatic language pro- cessing in order to obtain the opportunity to do formal linguistics is justified: doing formal linguistics is equivalent to doing machine translation or language processing. This viewpoint was recently subscribed to by the Dutch minister of education and science, W. J. Deetmaa in a speech delivered on his behalf on the occasion of the opening of the Institute of Language and Speech Research (OTS) at the University of Utrecht. Deetman [1988: 6] adduced analogy (0.12 1) and subscribed to Srejder's and Lincbax's interpretation. But a historian of science like Dijksterhuis [1950 (2.4.J.90): 177] asserts that the unwarranted tenets of the alchemists and the charlatanism which was generated by the prospect of making gold had in fact ob- structed the development of chemistry for a thousand years or so. In line with this conception, pessimists such as Schutzenberger [1965: 28] suggest that real progress was brought about by the experiments of those pioneers of chemistry (e.g. A.L. Lavoisier, J. Priestly) who chose to ignore the goals of the alchemists, and were in a position to do so. Schutzenberger implies that doing formal linguistics is not doing automatic language processing. The coexistence of these viewpoints interferes with the communication between researchers and the agents who create the opportunities for research, the science politicians. A pessimistic science politician has no criteria for preferring one type of research above another, and cannot conduct science policy. Opti- mistic science politicians, on the other hand, will prefer to support optimistic scientists, who offer the prospect of specific applications. Then, if Dijksterhuis is right, conducting a science policy produces a sit- uation in which innovative research will only be conducted by fraudulent researchers, pessimists who pre- tend to be optimists. The question is how Deetman's speech must be interpreted: as a rejection of Dijkster-</page><page sequence="141">THE CONTEXT 119 Hile failure of the primitive approach to problems such as machine translation has shown that one can- not impose aprioristic schemes on living language. It is necessary to learn to describe the more funda- mental iglubinnyj) relations in language. In this connection it is necessary to enrich the mathematical apparatus which is at the disposition of linguistics } On the other hand, the use of computer terminology may have been attractive as a safeguard against the accusation of idealism. Postulating models which are at least as- sumed to be possible as physical processes in whatever remote future serves as a to- ken of the willingness to adopt a materialist approach. Revzin, for example, operates a mathematical, abstract conception of modelling in 1962,2 explicitly refrains from defining 'model1 in 1966,3 but employs a cybernetic conception in 1967;4 during all this time, his actual models do not change. Finally, Saumjan takes the trouble to write a monograph on the status of abstraction, deduction, postulation and models in dialecti- cal materialism, and adduces impressive quotations from Lenin and Marx, who point out that mathematical abstractions are constructs which express objective properties of matter, and are not, therefore, manifestations of idealism or formalism.5 In 1970, Filin, who now has taken charge of the Institute of Russian,6 organizes a seminar which assembles the old guard and edits a collection on Leninism and the theoretical problems of linguistics.7 In his own contribution, he considers mathemati- cal linguistics a branch of mathematics and, again, emphasizes that genuine linguistics doubtlessly belongs to the humanities and is, therefore, an ideological discipline, which is even more connected with dialectical materialism than the natural sciences are.8 In accordance with the spirit of the period, western investigators are cited in order to expose the emptiness of the fashions which the Soviet structuralists are im- puted to follow. Thus, the French (communist) linguist M. Cohen is invoked against structuralism-,9 Bar-Hillel is invoked to point out that machine translation has ended up in a deadlock;10 Hockett's disappointment in generative grammar is brought to bear huis' view of Mediaeval science, as a renunciation of innovative science, or as an invitation to deceive sci- ence politicians. The issue will be returned to in §6.2. 1 Sreider 1969 [l&gt;. 129f. 2 Revzin 1962a (1.1): 8 (or 1966b (1.1): 3). 3 Revzin 1966c: 140. 4 Revzin 1967b (1.4): 25 (or 1969a (2): 28-29). 5 Saumjan 1973b (IÏ 11-12, 1971a [l&gt;. 7.

Whereas the 1966 board was dominated by anti-Marrists of the 1950 discussion, such as Vino- gradov, Serebrennikov, and P.S. Kuznecov, as well as by structuralists, such as Revzin and Ju.V. RoZdestvenskij, the former are now dead, and the latter are removed. The 1971 board is dominated by Marrist survivors of the forties, such as Budagov and Desnickaja. Filin is the editor in chief.3 Raskin provides an illuminating account of the next linguistics debate.4 Budagov, who also assembles leading positions,5 renews the neo-Marrist attack in 1972, this time in Izvestija AN SSSR, Seri ja literatury i jazyka, which has not yet been taken over.6 No new elements are introduced except the Marx and Engels quotation which was imputed to imply that some languages could be more advanced than others.7 As L'Hermitte remarks, several of Budagov's arguments, quotes and examples coincide with those in Budagov 1949, which were to celebrate the triumph of Marxist linguis- tics over formalist linguistics.8 The numerous reactions9 show that the linguists take the attack seriously, but the die seems to be cast. As Raskin points out, "the ideologi- cal balance was such that the structuralists have to pretend in their response that they are taking [Budagov's] charges at face value, i.e. as purely scholarly arguments."10 All parties know the frame of reference of the relevant audience. Only a mathemati- cian like DobruSin can still afford to make arrogant remarks on the anachronistic be- haviour of mathematically illiterate linguists,11 and quote Lomonosov, the father of all Russian science, who points out that ^mathematics must be studied, if only because it puts the mind in order".12 Budagov closes the discussion in 1974. Here and there he al- most literally repeats the ten-year old phrases of Degtereva, pointing out that: 1 Hockett 1966/1967 (preface): 9-10 (the preface is absent in the 1966 version); Filin 1970b 22. Here, too, Hockett's disappointment is isolated from its context: Hockett's passage ends with expressing the hope of discovering a more appropriate type of mathematics. 2 Filin 1970b: 10-11; cf.

Budagov does not mention the origin of Polivanov's derogatory remarks, which can be re- traced to Polivanov 1974a (entitled "Even Mathematics can be Useful"), the original of which appeared in Polivanov 1931 and which employs mathematics all the same, viz. in order to demonstrate the astronomi- cal implausibility of Marrist palaeontology. 12 DobruSin 1973: 441.</page><page sequence="143">THE CONTEXT 121 in the meantime, there have emerged, unfortunately, in our midst very strange linguists who discuss language without being able to understand or describe a single language and who describe instead the so-called uncontradictory scheme invented by themselves and which stands in no relation to any really existing language.* The editorial of Izvestija AN SSSft Serija literatury i jazyka proposes pluralism in lin- guistics, as long as it is developed as a Marxist science, and as long as it is especially attentive to the achievements of Russian and Soviet linguistics.2 Budagov's offensive goes on in Voprosy jazykoznanija, with a review of Zvegincev's collection of papers on linguistic theory.3 He demonstrates that Zvegincev insults all of linguistics between Humboldt and Chomsky, particularly Soviet linguistics. Later in 1974, a major conference on "theoretical problems of Soviet linguistics" took place at the Institute of Linguistics. Most of the structuralist contributions were turned down, and the few leading exponents of structuralism whom the organizers could not help admitting, such as Ivanov, Mel'ouk and Apresjan, were barely given the opportunity to deliver their talks.4 Revzin dies in the same year, at the age of 5 1.5 Two papers on the importance of his work appear in Prague.6 In the mid seventies several structural linguists, including Saumjan and Mel'ouk, emigrate.7 Others, including Apresjan, are removed from the major institutes.8 Some turn to new fields of interest: Zaliznjak concentrates on lexi- cography and historical linguistics, areas which continue to be tolerated; Gladkij and Srejder retreat into mathematics and information retrieval. A few linguists are con- verted to Marxist linguistics, sometimes with remarkable results. The traditional structuralist EvdoSenko 1967 turns into the innovative Marxist-Leninist Evdoáenko 1977. Andreev, who in his cybernetic period works on statistical-combinatorial meth- ods enabling us to analyse languages of extraterrestrial civilizations,9 in his Marxist- Leninist period contributes to the exposure of the idealist nature of foreign trends with an intelligent and destructive analysis of generative grammar.10 From 1975 onwards, Voprosy jazykoznanija indulges in neo-Marrist triumphalism and critical analyses of structuralism, glossematics, neo-positivism, the meaning «==» text model, and the work of Apresjan, Zvegincev, and Stalin.11 The habit of quoting LI. Brejnev in the linguistic journals originates in this period. The tenet of language as a superstructure category is reiterated, and the r problem of language and ideol- ogy" is designated as the most urgent research priority.12 The history of Soviet 1 Budagov 1974a: 136; translation from Raskin 1978: 272-273. 2Popovodu 1974: 140. 3 Budagov 1974b; Zvegincev 1973. 4 Raskin 1978: 267, 270. 5 Raskin 1978: 279: "[he] did not survive a trivial appendix operation". 6 Revzina &amp; Sreider 1976, Revzina &amp; Sreider 1977. 7 Other emigrants are A.B.

Marr himself is rehabilitated in 1976, in a paper from Gel'gardt, which comes to the awkward conclusion that ^objective scientific criticism cannot conceal that N.Ja. Marr [...] will go down in the history of linguistic doctrines as one of the most outstanding Russian linguists".1 Apart from its ideological flaws, Soviet structuralism is condemned for its fruitless- ness. Linguistic modelling is laid to rest in two papers from Pazuxin. The arguments in the first paper should be taken seriously if it were not for the context in which they were presented. Pazuxin discusses the models of the Set-theoretical School. He con- cludes that they are not models at all. Hlie concept of analytical models of language has therefore, turned out to be empty and lacking content. This unfortunate mistake has done, and is still doing, a great deal of harm to our science and its pres- tige. It must turn our attention to the importance of a serious revision of the methodological founda- tions of linguistics, a task which we have been neglecting. The concept of analytical models arose in an "apprenticeship" period, when linguists uncritically adopted concepts and terms from the exact sciences in enormous quantities. Stubbornness and consid- erations of prestige produced a situation in which this ghost-concept was not only preserved in linguis- tics but is even sometimes used as symbol of novelty and progress. By all odds the appropriate moment to return to one's senses and stop deceiving oneself has now arrived.2 Pazuxin's second paper discusses "cybernetic" models, which turn out to include gen- erative grammar and the meaning «=&gt; text model. Since, as Pazuxin argues, cybernetic models are the most "authoritative models", all of linguistic modelling can be evaluated by the successes and shortcomings of the latter.3 Cybernetic models turn out to be: Either just regular linguistic descriptions [...I disguised by (pseudo-Mogical symbolism, or arbitrary constructs, based on erroneous assumptions. It would, however, be mistaken to consider these models absolutely useless. Their authors have often set themselves illusionary and impracticable tasks. But by doing so they draw the linguists' attention to the serious methodological problems of linguistics and set us thinking about the actual possibilities of our discipline.4 This leaves the problem of the relationship between theoretical linguistics and the economy: what about machine translation and automatic language processing? In an article from Kotov, in the same issue of Voprosy jazykoznanija, the history and future of machine translation are rewritten once more.5 In Kotov's history of machine translation, there were two schools in the 1950s. En- gineers and programmers adopted an "empirical" approach, writing algorithms and im- proving them by trial and error. Kotov refers to this approach as machine translation {maSinnyj perevod, MP). Mathematicians and language theorists, on the other hand, favoured a "cybernetic" approach, deciding that machine translation requires a new type of linguistics, the development of which is conditional to any real progress in technical matters. This approach is referred to as automatic translation (avtomatiões- kij perevod, AP). Both schools did some useful work but the cyberneticians ousted the empiricists at the 1958 and 1961 conferences and established an Arakõeev regime, 1 Gel'gardt 1976: 130. In his paper Gel'gardt, who had distanced himself from Budagov's offensive in Gel'- gardt 1973, takes considerable pains to extoll Budagov's work. ¿Pazuxin 1975(5.1): 113. 3 Pazuxin 1976 (1): 26. 4 Pazuxin 1976 (10* 36. 0 Kotov 1976.</page><page sequence="145">THE CONTEXT 123 while the major empiricist research group was disbanded.1 The cyberneticians inhib- ited a breakthrough in machine translation during the 1960s and produced a decade's disadvantage for Soviet machine translation2 as a result of their lack of interest in the technicalities of machine translation research, and by usurping its label while overtly professing to conduct such research rwithout translation, without computers, and without algorithms".3 mieir preservation of the "applied" label automatic translation prompts the assumption that they use it for its prestige and for shielding their ideas against criticism on the part of other specialists in linguis- tics on the one hand, and for establishing the semblance of being our country's machine translation de- velopers on the other. It is hard to find another explanation.4 According to Kotov, machine translation must return to the status of a technical dis- cipline: programmers must conduct down-to-earth bilingual experiments with well-de- limited sublanguages, with real algorithms and extensive use of contextual statistics for disambiguation. Kotov's history of machine translation research, which is easily decoded as an assault on Mel'ouk and his team,5 represents a counterpoint to Mel'ouk and Kulagina's 1956 history as reported in §0.11: Trojanskij's legendary translation machine had been turned down by linguistically illiterate technicians. But the message is clear: theoretical linguists must either conform or deliver. A more moderate conclusion is found in Cxaidze's paper, in the same issue of Vo- prosy jazykoznanija. An old Marrist, having contributed his mite in the great Bour- geois Contraband onslaught on Jazykfront in 1932,6 now puts his oar in the neo- Marrist victory, pointing out that the type of machine translation research which he himself has been doing since the fifties in faraway Tbilisi deserves to be continued.7 In spite of Kotov's analysis, some of the condemned cyberneticians8 continue to publish their work in technical journals on information retrieval and related areas, 1 Kotov 1976: 38-39. Of course, the term Arakõeev regime is not used in characterizing the way in which the cyberneticians dealt with the empiricists, Kotov uses suppression in quotation marks. The use of quo- tation marks in tendentious texts would be an interesting object of investigation. In Soviet texts of the seventies, the following message seems to be intended by quotation marks as in the present instance. "Of course we are objective and would not use the qualification. But our opponents informally use it them- selves, whether seriously or ironically. And, as we all know, Soviet society is endangered by cynics, peo- ple who themselves do not know whether they intend their statements to be serious or ironical. But the reader himself may judge which is the case." 2 Kotov 1976: 47. Kotov does not really answer the question of how the west has been able to build up its putative lead while at the same time producing the fashionable theoretical nonsense which lured the Soviet linguists into building up its disadvantage. 3 Kotov [1976: 42] actually documents this slogan in the preface [Mel'ouk 1967 (2): 9] of Mel'ouk &amp; Raviõ 1967, an impressive international critical bibliography on hard-core machine translation containing data and discussions on 1430 titles. 4 Kotov 1976: 48. 5 Kotov 1976: 48-49. Kotov's programme, as well as the body of his argument, are literally copied from Gerasimov &amp; Marõuk 1975, which appeared in the bulletin of the Union Centre for Translations of Scien- tific and Technical Literature and Documentation.

But the possibilities to train Nachwuchs are now completely blocked. Apresjan and Zvegincev are attacked for their ruining the next generation of linguists. Evidence of their bad influence is presented in Axmanova &amp; Dolgova 1979. Its authors check Apresjan's and Zvegincev's publications for poor (Russian) usage, and present a long list of the "incorrect" non-projective2 and other awkward sentences found.3 Axmanova &amp; Dolgova point out that ^flooding the libraries" with brazenly illiterate (razvjazno- bezgramotnyjY work by r"language-less [...] linguists, who consciously neglect the study of living human languages and their genuine regularities, and overtly replace the science of the true object of linguistics by nebulous and opinionated linguo- philosophical arguments", is ^detrimental to the culture of scientific exposition".4 The threat that the ^common language of Marxist exposition" is being replaced by a rjargon of technical scholastics [...] is serious enough to arouse alarm about the train- ing of our young linguistics specialists".5 It is pointed out in passing that rfree ex- change of opinions between scientists, without which a science cannot develop, must not be confused with pluralism of truths, implying the existence of equally true opin- ions".6 By 1980, practically all structuralist trends have disappeared. Zvegincev's De- partment of Structural and Applied Linguistics is closed down in 1983.7 As to the "normal" research practice of Neo-Marrism after its victory, a great deal of energy is invested in examining and denouncing the philosophical positions of west- ern linguistic work.8 Budagov, in the meantime Academy member and editor of Vopro- sy jazykoznanija, produces an endless stream of denunciations of modernism, futurism, formalism, economy, etc.9 Filin initiates work on a dictionary of Lenin's language, pedantry. Another recurring stigmatizing term, frequently used against scientists who indulge in autonomous theorizing, is èntuzîast, originally meaning 'enthusiastic person'. 1 Yet contributions to Nauõno-texniõeskaja informacija, Serija 2 were subject to (possibly self-imposed) censorship. Skoroxod'ko 1976 is a review of the collection which contains Mel'öuk 1975: although the longest, Mel'öuk's paper is not mentioned; even the meaning «-♦ text model is discussed without mention of Mel'ouk. 2 Projectivity is word order constraint on Russian and other languages, which is often held to reflect a uni- versal property of language. In §4.1.42, it will be argued that projectivity is an artificial constraint, im- posed on written usage in standard languages. 3 Axmanova &amp; Dolgova 1979: 36-37. Several of the adduced "ungrammatical" sentences happen to contain the proper name Chomsky. Involving the presentation of linguistic work in its evaluation is not restricted to Soviet linguistics. In Newmeyer's history of generative grammar, the "whimsical style" of generative semantics is considered to have sped up its "downfall" [1980 (5.3.7): 171]. As Newmeyer puts it, "it is tempting to speculate that generative semantic style is but a classic example of content both shaping form and dominating it" [1980 (5.3.7): 172]. 4 Axmanova &amp; Dolgova 1979: 37. 5 Axmanova &amp; Dolgova 1979: 38. 6 Axmanova &amp; Dolgova 1979: 38. 7 Newmever 1986 (&amp; 120. 8 Cf.

The paradigmatic basis can be traced back to Budagov's Marrism without Marr, as propagated in his 1949 paper. Having returned to superstructure status, lan- guage progresses in a one-way direction, improving all the time, like the rest of soci- ety, though no longer necessarily by leaps. Klimov and Panfilov may be considered MeSoaninov's and Filin's heirs. They have a considerable command of minor languages of the Soviet Union, insert some Marr and a great deal of MeSõaninov into their ref- erences, but also spend part of their energy on ideological issues. Klimov works on typological stages, such as the development of the ergative, but also on Engels' crite- ria for the allocation of dialects to languages;2 Panfilov sees to the philosophical as- pects but does not hesitate to illustrate his point by elaborate empirical work, illus- trating the development and increasing sophistication of the expression of quantity in language with the development of Gilyak.3 In a sense, their research can be compared with the recent search for "conspiracies" in western grammatical research: as in neo- Marrism, syntactic changes which seem to result from mutually unrelated processes are accounted for by means of underlying universal factors.4 S 0.13 Internalization versus bread and butter In Graham's important work on the relationship between the natural sciences and Marxist philosophy in the Soviet Union, it is concluded that Soviet scientists have made an impressive intellectual achievement in providing a systematic interpretation of nature in terms of dialectical materialism. In the hands of its most able advocates, there is no question but that dialectical materialism is a sincere and legitimate attempt to understand and explain nature. In terms of universality and degree of develop- ment, the dialectical materialist explanation of nature has no competitors among modern systems of thought.5 This intellectual achievement is ascribed on the one hand, to the fact that many emi- nent scientists were sincere communists in the twenties and thirties, and on the other, to the political pressure of the forties on the other, however reprehensible this pres- sure may have been in itself, and in spite of the excesses in biology and a few other disciplines. Graham is convinced that quite a few prominent Soviet scientists believe that dialectical materialism is a helpful approach to a study of nature. [... Tlhey have slowly developed and refined a philosophy of nature that would almost certainly continue to survive and evolve even if it were no longer propped up by the Communist Party P 1 Cf.

But the point here is that, in the regu- lar cases, the natural scientists' conformity to the ideology is observed to be due to internalization, not to the desire to survive, to make the discipline survive, or to pur- sue careers in the science system. As reported in §0.3, Bruche-Schulz assumes the same situation for linguistics, at least for the thirties and forties: Marrism was supported by the linguists, whose ac- tions and thought were immediately determined by the needs of society. This assump- tion can be confronted with the thesis implicit in Raskin's games of musical chairs, which suggest that, in linguistics, paradigmatic discussions are really vehicles for or- dinary bread-and-butter conflicts. In the present section we shall deal with the ques- tion of whether Bruche-Schulz's internalization thesis holds and can be generalized to the whole of the history of Soviet linguistics. As shown in the foregoing sections, the events in linguistics differ in at least one respect from what Graham reckons to be the normal pattern in the natural sciences. Whereas ideologizing the natural sciences did not usually result in ousting eminent researchers, the linguistics discussions usually ended up in ostracism. During most of the history of Soviet linguistics, a paradigmatic shift was accompanied by personal measures against defeated paradigms (Jazykfront, Marrism, Soviet structuralism). Major linguists (Polivanov, MeSõaninov, Mel'ouk, Saumjan, Apresjan, etc.) were re- moved from their posts or worse. The only trend which did not produce victims was Soviet structuralism, which arose in a period of growing budgets.1 Thus, unless Bruche-Schulz identifies "general assent" with the opinion which remains after the re- moval of the dissenters, her observation (reported in §0.3) that Soviet linguists sup- ported the conversion toward Marrism is incorrect: her own material is sufficient to show that the conversion to Marrism around 1930 was only supported by those lin- guists who emerged victoriously after a paradigmatic struggle. It may be argued that this is only a consequence of the nature of the discipline: ideological choices affect linguistics to a larger extent than the natural sciences. Whatever the ideology may say, Graham's eminent scientists who adhered to dialecti- cal materialism continued to communicate with the other scientists of the world; in their actual research, they did not produce incompatible results. Marrism, on the other hand, interfered with linguistic practice: it produced a different type of linguis- tics, which was not recognized elsewhere. The same applies, though to a lesser ex- tent, to neo-Marrism: Filin's revision of foreign influence on Russian in the 1970s is not accepted by western slavists who have access to the same body of primary mate- rial. Thus, whereas in physics believers and non-believers may continue to work on the same project, in linguistics it is inevitable that, after the parting of opinions, those who continue to adhere to the old paradigm withdraw from the arena: they cease to be linguists.2 But this does not save the internalization thesis. The discussions were not just bat- tles among linguists: in most cases, adherents of the emerging paradigm were sup- ported by adminstrative measures, taken by non-linguists. In the early conflicts such 1 If Kotov 1976: 39 is to be believed, even structuralism produced victims: cf. S0.12. ¿ At least theoretical linguists. Most of the conflicts described in this chapter never reached the shop floor of language teaching, where the majority of language specialists were active.</page><page sequence="149">THE CONTEXT 127 interventions were straightforward: people were immediately removed, institutes were closed. In the later conflicts the paradigmatic battlefield was manipulated at a distance: departments were slowly dismantled, suitable persons were appointed in key positions to carry out the instructions. It took time for a new policy to surface. But in all cases the general assent of the linguists with the requirements imposed by society was achieved by means of staff policy, i.e. deliberate selection of the linguists. It may be argued that selecting the linguists whose allegiance to the exigencies of society is assured does not detract from the internalization thesis. Then the question of the nature of the internalized values arises. Consider Filin. From his early twenties he was ready to jump the barricades in favour of Marxist linguistics. But, as reported in this chapter, the specific paradig- matic viewpoints which are derived from Marxism were subject to change, and Filin's views changed along with them.1 As late as 1972, Filin vindicates himself for a few un- Russian viewpoints in his older work on the origins of Slavic, pointing out that he rfound himself under the influence of certain ideas of N.Ja. Marr's New Teaching on Language":2 paradigms are things which happen to linguists, rather than personal choices, which can be discussed and revised. At the same time, Filin harshly condemns others whose paradigmatic allegiances develop at a different pace.3 Bruche-Schulz's internalization thesis can only be maintained if the internalized values do not pertain to the linguistic paradigms themselves: they must be of a non-scientific nature. It is attractive to adopt the musical chairs model instead, and assume that Filin, Budagov, etc. were just ambitious and had the right friends among the policy makers. Of course this possibility can never be rejected. But bureaucratic organizations do not usually have a memory long enough to support the same individuals over decades. Therefore the (neo-)Marrists and the policy makers must have shared a set of values, which ensured continuity. Filin (1908) and Budagov (1910) belonged to the generation of L.I. Brejnev (1906).4 They had inherited the revolution, being too young to fight for it but old enough to take its values seriously. Apparently, growing up among heroes produces values which transcend any perversions. The non-linguistic value which unites their linguistic behaviour seems to be the Stalinist interpretation of superstruc- ture. Instead of being mechanically determined by the technical and economic base, the superstructure had become an instrument of the state. Here we arrive at a flaw of the concept. Superstructure is a fuzzy category, which includes cultural institutions as well as aggregated cultural behaviour of individuals: no distinction is made between church and religion. Superstructure can only be manipulated as long as there are 1 Similar shifts can be observed for other captains of Soviet linguistics. Abaev's shift from his 1936 revo- lutionary rhetoric to his 1965 rhetoric of continuity with respect to linguistic paradigms (cf. §0.12) is char- acteristic. 2 Filin 1972 59. 0 Sor, who had dutifully (cf. §0.6) attacked Polivanov in 1929, had observed a safe distance from Jazykfront in 1930, and had espoused Marr as the first really Marxist linguist in 1931, was nevertheless exposed as a camouflaged Indo-Europeanist in Filin 1932a: 30. 4 Other examples are Cxaidze (1905) and Desnickaja (1912). Abaev (1900, or, according to the old calendar, 1899) is slightly older but his behaviour is also less typical. His viewpoints, though Marrist and Marxist, show greater independence, and his polemic attacks are less timely. He never achieved Budagov's or Filin's career.</page><page sequence="150">1 28 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER people in the institutions who fail to see the difference, or rather, wish to ignore it. Thus, Bruche-Schulz's voluntarism may be involved after all. But it is not epistemolog- ical voluntarism in the "vulgar sociologist" sense: the Budagovs and Filins did not adopt and change scientific paradigms as a result of their perception of the societal condi- tions in the country, but because they were prepared to do the type of research which they thought the state expected of them. They were prepared to accept that in working in a superstructure institution, viz. the science system, they had to be loyal civil servants, who were not entitled to a private epistemology. The neo-Marrists may have considered saving linguistics part of their responsibility as civil servants, no matter what exactly it was that had to be saved apart from subservience to the state. As a result, Bruche-Schulz's internalization thesis cannot be definitively rejected. Thus, the reduction of linguistic communication to a level which induced good lin- guists to clothe their serious research in schoolteacher categories was made possible by the conflation of science policy and science through the internalization of the goals of science policy by the scientists. A government science policy may be guided by two basic motives: the cultural mo- tive and the utilitarian motive. In a culturally motivated science policy, the community cultivates respect for the perceptions and motivations of individuals: it recognizes that there are activities which it cannot understand or control but which are never- theless meaningful. The social system acknowledges its own limitations: the collective recognizes that there are things which must be delegated to individual human beings, such as curiosity, which is viewed as a self-sufficient value, a merit good, like art, and worthy of being supported. The relation between society and the individual re- searcher is based on trust: it is left up to the researcher to determine the meaning of her own work.1 A utilitarian science policy, on the other hand, assumes specific, or at least specifiable, relationships between research and society. This relation may be straightforward, as in applied research, or based on assumptions, theories, or myths: some policy makers assume, for example, that there is a quantifiable causal connec- tion between fundamental research and the production of useful applications. Re- searchers are trusted here as well, but this form of trust is based on specific expec- tations: trust is a policy tool, not a goal. Nowadays, government support of science is almost exclusively based on a combi- nation of utilitarian and egalitarian considerations: the curiosity of individuals is rarely recognized as an object for government support, except when such support serves the needs of the population. In the west this situation is relatively recent, but Soviet science has been dominated by such considerations for much longer. As S.I. Vavilov proclaimed in his 1949 paper on the Star of Science, rin our country, the days of so-called pure science are gone for good".2 Typically, Einstein's conviction that 1 A similar acknowledgement of the limited potential of societal systems, of their fundamentally Utopian status, is the myth incorporated in constitutional monarchies: however sophisticated the system of checks and balances, in the final resort the welfare of any collective depends on the way in which arbitrary individ- ual human beings, with unpredictable behaviour, take up the responsibilities which happen to be entrusted to them. The monarchy reminds the population of this fact of life. ¿ Vavilov 1949.</page><page sequence="151">THE CONTEXT 129 science will perish if it pursues practical goals instead of being guided by curiosity1 was used to prove the reactionary character of his ideas.2 Fundamental research in the natural sciences was expected to yield useful appli- cations in the long run; even when individual researchers did not share such expecta- tions, research collectives were prepared to nourish them. The relative freedom of choice of research priorities was exacted from the authorities by the republic of sci- ence, and in the last instance depended on the willingness of the policy makers to be- lieve in the plausibility of the perspectives offered by the researchers. But past per- formance and low cognitive thresholds had failed to produce such willingness for the humanities or the social sciences. In a system which recognizes only utilitarian mo- tives for supporting research, the only raison d'être of a discipline which is not ex- pected to produce applications consists of supporting the system which supports it. In these circumstances, curiosity-oriented research is still legitimate; the researchers may not, however, be guided by their individual curiosities but by the curiosity of the society which has commissioned them to do their research, or rather, by the curiosity which they attribute to their society. The conflict between the neo-Marrists and the Soviet structuralists is essentially a conflict between those who had internalized the utilitarian and egalitarian aspect of Soviet science policy and those who had not. To most structuralists the conditions im- posed by the science system were only the boundary conditions for their work, which consisted of satisfying their own curiosity. In the paradigmatic wars they struggled for improvement or against deterioration of these conditions. But exponents of the values of the system, such as Abaev, Budagov and Filin, thought that they knew what is good for the people, and were prepared to simplify their own frames of reference in order to gear their perceptions to its needs, and to be able to explain the importance of the semantic shift of bol'Sój Cbig'), or the ephemerity of the use of prédki ('ances- tors') for 'parents', or to dress up the originality of Russian. It is only to be expected that, as soon as they realized that the translation machine was only a paper tank, they would regard the arrogant, cynical and anarchist structuralists as indifferent to the mission which was entrusted to linguistics. The accusation that the structuralists com- mitted Fart pour Vari (or, as Kotov puts it, f"theory for theory"3), that they used in- crowd denotational systems and symbols which nobody needed but the structuralists themselves in studying the problems which were generated by those very denotational systems, regularly returns in various phrasings4 and essentially coincides with the ac- cusation which Abaev had launched against the neo-grammarians in 1936.5 It is natu- ral that the neo-Marrists should have regarded abstract, noncommittal, constructs as fraudulent misuse of state facilities. 1 Einstein 1934 (1): 44. 2 Viz. in Karpov 1952: 226ff. 3 Kotov 1976: 47. 4 Abaev 1965: 32, 1969: 93, 1971: 135; Filin 1966/1968: 21-22; cf. also Losev 1968: 50-51. 5 Cf. §0.6. In one respect, Abaev drastically changed his opinion in the course of the century: in 1934, he saw the removal of "polysemantism" as the ultimate goal of linguistic development (cf. the quotation in §0.4). In 1971, on the other hand, he considers that ^polysemy is life": he points out, à la Degtereva, that</page><page sequence="152">1 30 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER §0.14 Perestroika and after The neo-Marrists shared the fate of the Brejnev generation. They fell victim to old age in the course of the eighties. Filin died in 1982. Their tragedy is that they never succeeded in working out a Marxist theoretical linguistics, no more than the struc- turalists succeeded in working out machine translation. However important and obvi- ous the relation between language and thought may be, Marxism does not seem to evoke any laws governing this relation. The neo-Marrists leave no successors to continue the paradigm. The survivors of the next generation, not so young anymore themselves, regard them as distant ancestors. Planck's demographic view of paradig- matic shifts1 seems to work after all. In 1990, Voprosy jazykoznanija is edited by the Georgian archaeologist and com- parative linguist T.V. Gamkrelidze; there is an international board, which includes Abaev, along with a post-modern linguist like Bernard Comrie. Yet the rich panorama which had been suppressed in the seventies has not returned. Research cultures are vulnerable and subtle ecologies: a particular constellation of knowledge, ideas, meth- ods, minds, and funding and communication patterns is destroyed, one cannot expect their exact reconstruction when their repression has ended. But even their replace- ment with a new panorama may take decades or a great deal of chance. A Soviet trend of the eighties, which fits the pursuit of sensibleness embodied by perestroïka, is functional grammar.2 Functional grammar unites various older linguists and, at least judging by its citation pattern, has developed independently from the various homonymous western schools: it rather derives from Schmidt's functional grammar, as developed in East Germany around 1970.3 Whether Soviet functional grammar represents a research paradigm in the traditional sense remains to be seen;4 perhaps research paradigms, as a principle of organization of research, are simply out of fashion. It is unclear what will happen to ex-Soviet theoretical linguistics, and several other humanities, in the 1990s. In view of the recent events in former socialist coun- tries in Central Europe, one cannot be optimistic. There is little chance that the existing utilitarian considerations for funding will be abandoned: they are fashionable in the western countries which serve as the models for the reform of the former socialist countries. However, the implementation of the utilitarian considerations may be subject to modification. The utilitarian checks of the government were of a philosophical nature: they were executed on the input to the science system. But, however abstruse the Soviet research paradigms may have been, and however intensive government interference with the humanities was on the input side, even during zdanovSõina the authorities did not apply utilitarian checks on the output: you cannot split up the meaning of the word dóbryj ('functionally right'; 'morally good'): ^instead of one living word, sparkling from all facets, you get two dead corpses" [1971: 1381 1 Cf. §0.3. 2 Cf. Bondarko, A.V., 1984, Jarceva 1985. 3 Cf., e.g.. Schmidt 1969a, 1969b. 4 The most recent presentation of Russian functional grammar is Bondarko, A..V., 1991.</page><page sequence="153">THE CONTEXT 131 - When the underlying principles of Marrism were considered all right, the authori- ties did not wonder about the actual use of element analysis. - Stalin, when propagating comparative linguistics because it was at least an "impe- tus to work" instead of to "lying on the oven and reading teacups"1, never tried to find out what exactly research in comparative linguistics is good for. - The Soviet structuralists advertised themselves as useful, but only in a very ab- stract sense: as will become clear from the material treated in this study, neither they nor their mathematician friends were sure about how to conceive a link be- tween their research and specific applications. Apart from a few chores, like making alphabets for newly literate languages and dressing up linguistic results as algorithms for non-existing translation machines, all groups of linguists got away with: - rejecting applicability for their research, or: - believing in naive hunches on the relation between their research and applications, or: - deceiving the authorities. Apart from lexicology, which has made Russian a key intermediary for studying a great many languages but would never be commercially viable, the least useless type of linguistics was probably Vinogradov's "history of the standard (¡iteraturnyj) lan- guage", which, however unimaginative and unexciting, not only contributed to the ac- cessibility of the corpus of Russian classics, but also to raising the cultural quality of Russian nationalism to a level which may turn out to be crucial to a peaceful develop- ment of the former Soviet empire. Thus, while Soviet authorities, however malignant, had continued to regard science as a respectable black box and, consequently, tolerated an amount of real research, the new situation is likely to allow two possible scenarios. 1 In a process of economic rationalization, government support for the humanities will be under heavy pressure. It is remarkable that, in the complete history of the Soviet linguistics debates, funding is hardly ever mentioned: the discussions and decisions were entirely formulated in terms of persons and content. The develop- ments in, say, Bulgaria, where numerous institutes are being closed, show what happens when the economic situation is taken seriously. 2 The humanities avail themselves of new myths to support. The products of the hu- manities may not match the atom bomb, but the developments in Yugoslavia have shown that their usefulness in engineering collective memories must not be under- estimated. If Yugoslav historians and linguists have not triggered Lunaöarskij's na- tional sentiments, they have at least contributed to their justification. Vermeer, in his documented account of just one of the Yugoslav issues, puts it as follows. In most countries scholars interested in the past (historians, historical linguists and similar people) stand outside society. What they do may at times be interesting, but is basically as irrelevant to the real concerns of society as Mozart's clarinet concerto (KV 622). In Yugoslavia things are quite different. There, historians are expected by society to provide the "scientific" foundation for territorial claims. [...] To an outsider, it is quite astonishing to see that the popular press in Yugoslavia is full of interviews 1 Cf. § 0.7.</page><page sequence="154">1 32 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER with historians and similar people, evidently not because the public is interested in what happened in the past, but because it is thought that past facts are somehow more important than present reality.* The same applies to linguistic facts. In the 1980s, while Yugoslav historians were rapidly increasing the post hoc proportions of the internecine massacres of the 1940s, respected Yugoslav linguists were debating in the international specialist press on the precise linguistic status of various Yugoslav towns and territories.2 And the phenomenon is not limited to Yugoslavia. Every research community must cope with its local science policy. In Georgia, the homeland of Marr and Stalin, people never really die. In 1989 Gamkrelidze, chief editor of Voprosy jazykoznanija, editor of the archaeological jour- nal Vestnik AN SSSR, and president of the Georgian Academy of Sciences, recalls the glottogonie process, advanced by the outstanding linguist and philologist of his time, Nicolaus Marr, who possessed a peculiar scholarly intuition, at times leading him to logically unfounded, but quite unexpected solutions of certain phe- nomena in a right direction.** The four elements are explained, and their rational basis is denied. But yet, Marr's theory, - representing a peculiar structural model of language, very close to the genetic code - is not irrele- vant to science and psychology in general, and may serve to illustrate the occurrence in an outstanding personality of intuitive ideas on the structure of the genetic code, evidently copied by him subcon- sciously in developing an original model of language as an information-carrying system.4 When this study was being completed, in December 1991, Gamkrelidze had become the rector of the University of Tbilisi and a close associate of the nationalist presi- dent S. Gamsaxurdia. Western media reported that the oldest human skeletons outside Africa had been found below the ruins of a mediaeval Georgian church. §0.15 Accounting for the present study's philosophy We can now return to the assumptions which were formulated in the beginning of this chapter.5 The Set-theoretical School is one of the major trends in the "structural" pe- riod of Soviet linguistics. The contextual history of Soviet linguistics which was pre- sented above makes clear that the socio-economic context in which its exponents had to work was quite similar to the present context in most western countries: for as long as it lasted, survival and success were believed to be determined by high-brow deno- tation systems and mutual recognition in a broad network rather than by ideological allegiances and personal relationships within a small institution. Also, the exponents of the Set-theoretical School participated in broad research networks, including both researchers abroad and researchers in other disciplines: both groups may have been subject to ideological strings to a lesser extent than iso- lated groups of Soviet linguists were. 1 Vermeer 1992 103-104. 2 For a discussion on Dubrovnik, cf. Ivic, P., 1984, Katiéic 1985. 3 Gamkrelidze 1989: 3-4. 4 Gamkrelidze 1989: 4. The comparison of Marr's four elements to genes was also made in Thomas 1957 (7): 143. 5 Cf. §0.2 and §0.3.</page><page sequence="155">THE CONTEXT 133 This implies that we can accept the work of the Set-theoretical School at face value, which was the first assumption made in the beginning of this chapter. All pro- posals made by the School will be taken seriously. Deviations from this general prin- ciple, such as the shift in Revzin's conception of modelling which was mentioned in §0.12, will be taken into account. Now we turn to the second assumption made in the beginning of this chapter: it is meaningful to contribute to the Set-theoretical School as if it were a living tradition. As shown in §0.12, the events of the 1970s, which interrupted the development of the Set-theoretical School, were entirely contextual: outside circumstances forced the investigators to abandon the problems in which they were engaged and the net- works in which they communicated. The problems are still open, there is no deadlock: in terms of content, the point where the Set-theoretical School stopped is arbitrary. In this situation, the choice between Abaev's and Gladkij's systems of periodization of science presents itself.1 Of course, Abaev was factually right in using regimes as milestones: contextual factors, whether funding systems or administrative pressure, determine the kind of science which a country produces. But, given these constraints, the present writer happens to be in a position in which he can afford to ignore them, to support Gladkij's yardsticks, and to concentrate on the important discoveries and fruitful ideas. He does not have to engage in post factum collaboration with Degte- reva. This produces a practical problem: there is no audience for the contributions to the Set-theoretical School presented in these volumes. The enlightening function of this study intends to compensate for this. By providing explicit explanations of just about every step taken, the present writer intends to offer the tools to bridge the gap be- tween the exponents of the Set-theoretical School and the unitiated reader, and to engender an audience for the Set-theoretical School and the problems addressed by it, which are bound to be revisited at some point in the future. In fact, some of the re- cent work of Mel'éuk, who did not contribute to the Set-theoretical School at the time, can be regarded as an expansion of the ideas discussed in this study.2 The price which is paid for both compliance with Russell's injunction as quoted in §0.2 and pursuit of maximal explicitness in the exposition of the Set-theoretical School has become clear: the present writer can only apologize for the size of this work. S 0.16 The Set-theoretical School The Set-theoretical School is an attractive trend. Unlike many enterprises in Soviet structuralism, it is not a self-contained one-man construct, a strong theoretical claim. Rather it is a tool box, a set of methods, a grammar of theories, which is compatible with various theoretical claims. Over fifty persons have contributed to it, both mathe- 1 Cf. §0.4. 2 E.g.

Kolmogorov, which are worked out by V.A. Uspenskij in what the present study will regard as a crucial contribution.4 Other Soviet contributors include P.S. Kuznecov, R.L. DobruSin, V.N. Beloozerov, O.S. Revzina,5 A.V. Gladkij and A.A. Zaliznjak. The prolific I.I. Revzin is the driving force: he integrates the ideas of the others and writes a number of state-of-the-art books.6 The Set-theoretical School branches out into other countries of Eastern Europe: into Czechoslovakia (e.g. L. Nebesky, J. Horecky), Poland (A. Trybulec) and especially Romania. In the latter country, S. Marcus and a host of mathematicians associated with him published a large number of books and papers, mainly on the mathematical aspects of the set-theoretical approach. Several of Marcus' works have been trans- lated into French, English and several East European languages.7 The peak of his group's work of was probably in 1967, when a long series of papers was presented at the 10th International Congress of Linguists in Bucharest.8 Unfortunately, precisely Czechoslovakia and Romania were hit by re-ideologization campaigns comparable to the one in the Soviet Union. The present author has not assembled details on the de- velopments in the context of Czech and Romanian set-theoretical linguistics, but the outcome is similar to the Soviet one or worse. Contributions from Western countries are rare. Besides Kortlandt's 1972 review, only two papers from the Norwegian mathematician Mayoh deserve mention.9 Related ideas were developed independently in the United States by Cooper and in France by Sestier.10 §0.17 Morphological categories Publications on set-theoretical linguistics have been concerned with three areas of linguistics: phonology, morphology and syntax.

The results in phonology have been extensively treated by Kortlandt1 and are left out of consideration in the present study. The relatively limited output on syntax (including configuration analysis) will be briefly discussed in Chapter 4. 1.2 Set- theoretical syntax was soon either abandoned in favour of an approach based on gen- erative principles (e.g. in the Tartu School) or absorbed by dependency syntax, where it was not formalized in strictly set-theoretical terms. The interest of the Set-theoretical School was primarily focused on morphology. Both V.A. Uspenskij's and Kulagina's papers referred to above deal with morphological problems. The influence of set-theoretical linguistics on non-mathematical, "regular" linguistics has likewise made itself felt, most of all in morphology, and in particular in Zaliznjak's work on Russian nominal flexion.3 In the usage of the Set-theoretical School, the term morphology covers morphosyntax and morphosemantics rather than morphemics: the Set-theoretical School is interested in the use of morphological cate- gories rather than their formal expression. This study will discuss the treatment of morphological categories by the Set-theoretical School, as well as concepts which are considered auxiliary to this treatment, such as 'word'. S 0.18 'Case' and gender1 Within morphology, or rather morphosyntax, primary interest was focused on nominal categories, especially case1. One of the keynote questions which were raised for dis- cussion by Kolmogorov on the occasion of the first seminar on the subject was: "what do we mean when we say that two words are in the same case?"4 Kulagina's founding paper was inspired by the problems presented by the systemic complexity of the nominal morphology of Russian and its syntactic implications while she was working out algorithms for machine translation. The majority of the subsequent publications were concerned with case1 and 'gender'; these categories were often conceived of in a rather abstract sense (e.g. without a priori limitations on the parts of speech which can be characterized by 'case' and gender'). So, naturally, this study will focus on the models of case1 and 'gender' which have been developed by the Set-theoretical School. Other categories, such as number' and 'part of speech', will be discussed when they serve as auxiliary concepts, or when they are a by-product of models of "case and gender'. §0.19 A linguistic approach The material of the Set-theoretical School has mathematical and linguistic aspects. The majority of set-theoretical linguists had a mathematical background, and in many papers mathematical aspects are carefully presented, whereas the linguistic aspects receive less attention. The linguistic aspects will be emphasized here: this is a study of linguistics in which mathematical methods are applied, not a study of linguistic mathe- matics. This implies that, however interesting certain notions introduced by the Set- 1 Kortlandt 1972 (3-4): 46-90. 2 See §4.1.2 to §4.1.21. 3 Zaliznjak 1967b, especially (1-3): 19-100.

S 0.20 The structure of the present study Thus, the subject of these volumes has been delimited as the linguistic treatment of case', 'gender1, and associated phenomena in the Set-theoretical School of East Euro- pean linguistics. The study aims at informing the reader about the material which has been identified in the preceding sections. The reader is assumed to be a linguist with some interest in simple mathematical methods. However, all mathematical notions which are used will be explicitily accounted for. The material will be compared and evaluated on various paradigmatic levels. The language which will most often be used for purposes of illustration and falsification is Russian. The study has the following structure. Part 1 discusses the general methodological context of the Set-theoretical School. In Chapter 1.0, a frame of reference will be sketched: a format, by which the linguistic positions of the Set-theoretical School can be fixed with respect to each other and, tentatively, also with respect to other directions in linguistics. The remaining chap- ters of Part 1 discuss the specific components of the format. As the mathematical meta-language is regarded as a component, Chapter 1.1 contains the description of an austere set-theoretical apparatus, which will be used in the remainder of the study. Parts 2 to 5 will discuss the models that have been presented by the exponents of the Set-theoretical School. The models have been arranged according to the struc- ture of the basic assumptions on language that are implied by the models, and in order of increasing sophistication. The formal presentation of the models will be as uniform as possible. Since the material was presented in various degrees and systems of for- malization, the original models will be converted into the uniform notation which is in- troduced in Chapter 1.1. These parts contain amendments to the presented models within the bounds of their respective paradigms. Each of Parts 2 to 5 is divided into chapters according to the grammatical cate- gories being modelled: 'case, 'gender', and various auxiliary concepts. This ordering principle usually groups models according to their structural properties. For details of these properties, see Chapter 1.6. All models are illustrated by linguistic material, which enables falsification and amendment. Although the models are not language-specific, it is only natural that the exemplification employs the native languages of the authors, which prompted the problems which the Set-theoretical School seeks to solve. Thus, Russian will be used most often. Since Russian offers some rather complex problems in the field of mor- phology, it is a useful testing language. Material from other languages is added wher- ever it is useful for illustration or falsification. In a few instances, (fragments of) hy- pothetical languages will be used. The linguistic problems featured in the exemplification will be explained ad hoc, in terms of traditional linguistic terminology. Since the informal explanation of the lin- guistic problems requires informal use of the terms which the models purport to de-</page><page sequence="159">THE CONTEXT 137 fine, there is a potential cause of confusion. However, as a result of the formalization of the models, this confusion does not in practice arise. Thus, if it is stated that, say, "the Romanian neuter gender is not a G7-gender", the first occurrence of gender be- longs to the informal metalanguage of explanation, while the latter occurrence refers to a category which is formally defined by an identifiable gender model. The eventual purpose of all models is to provide definitions of such grammatical categories as case and gender'. Within each chapter, the models presented will be amended within the bounds set by the basic assumptions on language which they imply. In the last chapters (4.6, 4.7 and 5), when it is suggested that the basic assumptions themselves prevent foolproof definitions, proposals are sketched which go beyond the various sets of assumptions made by the Set-theoretical School and indicate possible directions for future work. The present writer's original intention of presenting a complete formalized model, using Kulagina's tool box to arrive at a set of non-coun- terintuitive definitions of morphological categories from a set of plausible assumptions on language, has turned out to fall beyond the scope of the present study. A fragment of this project was published in an earlier paper.1 The writer hopes to return to it at a later stage. 1 Van Helden 1979/1993 (i.e. Appendix B).</page><page sequence="160">PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS CHAPTER 1.0: INTRODUCTION S 1.0.1 Kolmogorov's case In September 1956, a seminar began at the Philological Faculty of Moscow University. It was dedicated to the examination of the use of mathematical methods in linguistics. This seminar is regarded as the origin of the Set-theoretical School.1 At the beginning of the seminar, the participants were confronted with a number of tentative keynote questions. Two of these questions, which were proposed by the mathematician Kolmogorov,2 concerned the notion of case1: (1/0/1/1) What exactly do we mean when we say that two words are in the same case? (1/0/1/2) How many cases does the Russian language possess? Questions of this type will be referred to as K-questions. At the seminar, and for the next twenty years, a good deal of energy was devoted to the search for consistent, rigorous answers to these questions, and for a method which would enable linguists to answer such questions. Any scientific discussion is subject to a set of conventional rules, which are obeyed by its participants and are assumed to determine whether statements make sense for the discussion. K-questions have to a large extent set the rules for the discussions in the Set-theoretical School. These rules diverge from the ones which govern linguistic discussion in the West during the same period. Fillmore, in his study of case1, is not really interested in the methodological status of the label case. He regards it as no more than a set of special labelled relations between two variables ( V and NF) in a deep structure.3 In his view, pragmatic considerations are sufficient to decide whether labels must be added to his list of cases: "additional cases will surely be needed."4 The nature of K-questions will be returned to in § 1.4.3. § 1.0.2 Delimitating the concept of model The (tentative) answers to K-questions proposed and discussed by the exponents of the Set-theoretical School were usually formulated in terms of set theory and mathe- matical logic, although the degree to which they involved symbolization varied. The term model is often used in referring to answers to K-questions, especially by Revzin, the most proliferous linguist of the Set-theoretical School. A few linguists were, either at some stage or consistently, reluctant to employ this term.5 1 Revzin 1977 (0. Û 10-12. Revzin makes contradictory statements on the duration of the seminar: he states that the seminar lasted a year and a half, but also that it was concluded towards the end of 1958. 2 Kolmogorov himself did not take part in the seminar. 3 Fillmore 1968 (3.5): 3 If. 4 Fillmore 1968 (3): 25. 5 Kulagina does no use it in her 1958 paper, speaking of a method of defining grammatical concepts. Za- liznjak usually avoids the term, speaking of, for example, imaginary experiments {myslennyj èksperiment: Gedankenexperiment) in 1967b (2.4): 40; footnote 10; but he uses model once, in 1967a. Gladkij [e.g. 1983] speaks of formal definitions. Mel'öuk [1975] speaks of "rigorous definitions" and reserves model for a class of constructs to which his own Meaning &lt;=&gt; Text Model belongs. 138</page><page sequence="161">CHAPTER 1 .0: INTRODUCTION 1 39 Thus, the use of the term model in the present study must be decided on. The no- torious vagueness of the notion presents a problem. Kiefer's definition of 'model' as "a more or less exactly formalized system, throwing light upon one or more aspects of language"1 covers most models presented in these volumes (or anywhere) but is hardly specific. It sometimes seems that the term is employed as a token of modesty: as a de- vice to mitigate the claims which scientific statements make about what reality is like, or to conceal the nature of such claims.2 At one point, Revzin in fact resigns himself to making no definition: rthe problem of defining the concept of model is extremely diffi- cult and finds itself beyond the scope of the linguist's competence".3 A large number of more or less precise definitions of the notion of model are avail- able.4 These clear-cut conceptions, however, are often mutually exclusive: they do not characterize the same things as models. A decision in favour of a specific inter- pretation at this stage might disqualify as models things which we may not yet wish to exclude from our discussion. It may be proposed to do away with the term model altogether and instead opt for one or more terms which are less charged. But this would do an injustice to the spirit of East European linguistics of the sixties, when model was the shibboleth of mod- ernist linguistic discussion. Besides, terms which are less charged are not necessarily less ambiguous. More important, model is convenient as a common denominator for a great deal of linguistic activity, including that of the Set-theoretical School. In spite of the appar- ent multiplicity of its interpretations, the term seems to point to something rather specific. This can be illustrated as follows. Revzin's definitions of 'model' show considerable variation. His 1962 definition dif- fers radically from his 1967 definition,5 while, as pointed out above, in 1966 he is re- luctant to provide a definition at all. Yet, the actual models which Revzin presents in the books which contain the definitions do not show any essential differences: even if his idea of what modelling is shifts, his very models remain the same (or rather: de- velop along independent lines). Perhaps this is what keeps his models together: they share a certain structure which is claimed to bear a relation to reality, but the specific nature of this relation is abstracted from, or at least studied in isolation from other aspects of linguistic dis- cussion. This makes models an almost political ploy. Linguistic discussion is lubricated by means of compartmentalization. Like politicians, who may collaborate in practical matters while disagreeing on the meaning of life or the essence of society, scientists using models may ensure progress in empirical matters by avoiding philosophical is- sues. They may decide to agree on the shape of a formula, even if they disagree on 1 Kiefer 1964: 2. 2 Cf. §0.12 on the ideological implications of claims on what reality is like. 3 Revzin 1966c: 140; Revzin, while endorsing this view, attributes it to Kiefer 1964, where the present writer has failed to retrace it. 4 Surveys can be found in Chao 1962 and Kortlandt 1972 (7): 120-130. 5 This fact is pointed out in Kortlandt 1972 (7.1): 121 and Srejder 1973c: 246. The definitions are found in Revzin 1962a (1.1): 8 (or 1966b (1.1): 3) and Revzin 1967b (1.4): 25 (or 1969a i2ï 28-29). The reasons which Revzin may have had for changing his conception of modelling were discussed in §0.12.</page><page sequence="162">1 40 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS what the formula stands for. Their perceptions of the world may diverge but nevertheless turn out to be homomorphous. This makes modela useful term. In the beginning of this study, model will be used in a rather broad sense, but in the course of this chapter, its interpretation will be nar- rowed down gradually and tailored to the output of the Set-theoretical School. Finally, some different interpretations will be distinguished. Until otherwise stated, the follow- ing definition will do. (1/0/2/1) A model is any account which sheds light on the meaning and use of one or more linguistic terms. However vague it may be, in one respect the definition is more specific than Kiefer's cognate definition which was quoted above. It involves terminology, i.e. a set of sym- bols which can be used to refer to any referent, within a conventional domain of dis- course, which possesses specific, though as yet unspecified, properties. S 1.0.3 Labels and their status Since Kolmogorov explicitly mentioned the category of case in (1/0/1/1) and (1/0/1/2), it would be expected to have become one of the central issues in set-theoretical lin- guistics, and, consequently, of this study. But the present volumes deal not only with various models of case but also a number of by-products: models of gender' and part of speech', as well as models of putative grammatical categories to which the Set-the- oretical School attaches new labels, which are coined for the occasion. These fresh labels have been assigned to conceptual slots which come about "naturally" in the set- theoretical approach to K-questions. Thus, we shall see that models not only account for existing linguistic terms but also call forth new terminology. In part, the new notions have an auxiliary character. They cover fragments of the systematic accounts which have an intermediate, connective function between exist- ing notions. Models of auxiliary notions are only fragments of models as defined in (1/0/2/1). In some instances, however, the new concepts have begun a life of their own: it sometimes happens that the search for mathematical answers to K-questions yields results which are satisfactory from an intuitive viewpoint even though they seem to have departed too much from the traditional understanding of the notion which the model has been trying to model. In such cases, the new terms are coined; in this man- ner, the interesting result is preserved, but is dissociated from the claim of having provided an answer to the original K-question. This mixed practice is characteristic of the Set-theoretical School: on the one hand its ambition is to make linguistic theory explicit; on the other hand it seeks the estab- lishment of new theoretical viewpoints, and is hampered in doing so by traditional terminology. It is, of course, possible to employ existing terms for new notions which deviate from the notions usually indicated by those terms, but then the question arises as to how far one can change a notion without changing its label. Kulagina in fact re- frains altogether from employing traditional terminology so as to avoid this question:</page><page sequence="163">CHAPTER 1 .0: INTRODUCTION 1 4 1 thus, Kulagina does not pretend to provide answers to K-questions. This point will be returned to in the next section. Thus, the models in this study are not, at first sight, united by common aims or common theoretical viewpoints, or even common terminology. Their only obvious common denominator is their denotation: they are formulated in a rigorous way and make use of the same mathematical notions. On the basis of this observation, the fol- lowing delimitation can be added to the provisional definition of 'model' which was given in (1/0/2/1). (1/0/3/1) A model can be formulated or reformulated in a language which is not it- self part of the model. The treatment of the models in the present study follows from this property: the pri- mary criterion for grouping and comparing models is their internal structure in terms of the meta-language: not the theoretical viewpoint which may be implied in the mod- els, or the grammatical category which they purport to model. For this purpose, a frame of reference, or format, will be developed: the format must reflect the structural aspects which models have in common, and enable us to assess and pinpoint their structural differences. To a certain extent, this format can also be employed to determine the position of the models of the Set-theoretical School with respect to linguistic conceptions which have been put forward by linguists out- side the Set-theoretical School. The format will be introduced in § 1.0.9. § 1.0.4 The meaning of Kolmogorov's questions Even if structure serves as a primary criterion for arrangement and comparison of models, it is not enough to compare and evaluate mere structures: from a structural viewpoint, there is no essential difference between models which provide answers to K-questions, or attempt to do so, and models which do not. Yet, this seems to be a crucial issue. In § 1.0.3, the question was raised of how far one can change a notion without changing its label. The answer to it is important if K-questions are to be taken seriously. If, for example, we should decide that a label is free to be used arbitrarily, for just anything we like, K-question (1/0/1/1) can be paraphrased as: (1/0/4/1) What shall we do with the label case? If case is an empty label to begin with, its distribution can hardly be a matter of sci- entific concern. A condition for solving Kolmogorov's problem, it seems, is to have some idea of the degree and nature of the commitment which is implied by the use of a term in a given approach to language. It is this issue which returns every time when East European formal linguistics is under attack from the traditional linguists, and which has divided set-theoretical linguistics itself. But the discussion is not novel and not restricted to the Set-theoretical School; generative grammar seems to be the only linguistic trend not affected by it. A brief general exposition of the issue now follows.</page><page sequence="164">142 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS S 1.0.5 Terminology and commitment The problem of commitment is often phrased as "the lack of precision of linguistic terminology". In descriptions of individual languages, meanings of linguistic terms of- ten vary, sometimes a term is used in different senses even within the limits of a single publication.1 On the other hand, some conscientious descriptive linguists resort to providing their terms with general definitions, even if this is beyond the scope of their work. Thus, Zaliznjak, in his work on Russian nominal morphology,2 and Andronov, in a description of Tamil,3 provide a great deal of general groundwork, which is referred to by other linguists in more general publications. In general works the notions which correspond to specific linguistic terms may vary widely. Here are a few examples; some details on the specific issues will be dis- cussed in § 1.5.4. 1 Morpheme. Martinet, and many students of Romance languages, use the term mor- pheme in a different sense as compared with most other linguists, who employ grammatical morpheme for the same notion. At the same time, the notion which most linguists refer to as morpheme is rendered by moneme in Martinet's terminol- ogy.4 2 Paradigm. This is the converse of the morpheme-moneme case. Apart from the la- bel, the Hjelmslevian paradigm1 has little or nothing in common with the traditional grammatical concept of paradigm.5 3 Phoneme. The above examples may seem trivial because the terminological differ- ence does not affect the corresponding concepts themselves. But the matter be- comes more complex when linguists appear to agree about the general purport of a linguistic term which nevertheless yields an ambiguous interpretation in linguistic practice. A case in point is the notion of phoneme. Although it is defined in many different ways by different linguists,6 the term is generally felt to refer to the same phenomenon. Barring generative grammar, this implicit consensus on the reference of the term is so solid that, if different methods of determining the inventory of phonemes of a language yield different results, this is not generally considered the consequence of vagueness or incompleteness of the definition of 'phoneme'.7 1 A popular example in discussions of this kind is the use of the term category in Jakobson 1932/1971, where it refers both to a system and to individual members of a system. Similarly, Rosetti 1959/1965 calls gender' a category, while Rosetti 1964/1965 calls the neuter gender a category. 2 Zaliznjak 1967b: cf. also Zaliznjak 1969. 3 Andronov 1966. 4 See, for instance Martinet 1973n (1.9): 15-16. The term moneme was originally introduced in Frei 1941 (Sh 51. 5 Hjelmslev's conception of 'paradigm' as a set of items which can fill the same slot in a structure is de- scribed in, e.g., Hjelmslev 1963: 36; 1968: 42-43. 6 Even a survey of surveys of the various conceptions of 'phoneme' would require too much space. Trubeckoj 1939 (1.3): 37-41 provides a survey of the "classic" definitions (such as Baudouin de Courtenay 1895, Jones 19673, Freeman Twaddell 1935/19664). More recent reviews are found in Jones 1967s (Appendix Ih 253-269 and Kortlandt 1972. 7 Cf. Chao's classic paper [1934/19661 on the non-uniqueness of phonemic solutions.</page><page sequence="165">CHAPTER 1 .0: INTRODUCTION 1 43 4 Word. The term word is another such example. Although it is universally felt that there must be a notion which corresponds to word, it is difficult to establish a gen- erally accepted definition which is valid for all languages.1 In linguistic practice, the problem is usually evaded in either of the following ways. 1 A uniform definition of the concept is abandoned. For example, a notion which is labelled word is defined separately for each language (or group of languages). This implies that the only thing that the 'words' of different languages are guatanteed to have in common, is their label. This amounts to denying the existence of the univer- sal linguistic notion of word.2 At best, the term may have a mnemonic function. 2 The notion is left undefined. It is, for example, taken for granted that everyone agrees upon what the words of a given language are; or 'word' is defined as a non- linguistic (e.g. typographical) notion, which, from a linguistic point of view, amounts to the same thing as taking the concept for granted. Neither solution seems to be fully satisfactory. Option 1 is criticized by Smirnickij, who considers it misleading to employ word as a mnemonic label: fIf we would not operate with a general word concept, i.e. would not generalize on facts from different languages, we would not even be entitled to speak of a Russian 'word', or a French or an English 'word: these very expressions already presuppose that we refer to certain common properties, besides properties which may vary between languages. We would have to speak about the Russian slovo, the French mot and the English word, analogously to the way in which we speak about the Russian ruble, the French franc, and the English shilling.3 Option 2 may be satisfactory for some concepts, but examples of disagreement on, say, the words of a given language are easily found. In German orthography, for example, the three-morpheme string aufzuleben ('to revive1) is written as a single word, while Dutch orthography denotes its counterpart op te leven as three words. The etymology, meaning, morphemic make-up and syntactic function of the German and Dutch expressions are identical. But if one decides not to evade the underlying K-questions ("What do we mean by word?" "Do we mean anything by it at all?"), one faces the necessity to make choices in a labyrinth of existing terms and notions, a Confusion of Tongues4 in a meta-linguistic Babel.5 Of course, this labyrinth has not passed unnoticed in the history of linguistics. Broadly speaking, we find two attitudes towards it: a prescriptive and a descriptive one. 1 A survey of surveys is even harder to provide here than in the case of phoneme'. As early as 1924, Jespersen [(6}. 92, footnote 1] reports that "the proper definition of word' has been discussed in innumerable places in linguistic literature". Noreen [1923: 433-447] provides and classifies over twenty extant definitions of word'. Classic contributions to the problem of defining word' are Reichling 19672, Togeby 1949, Rosetti 194771965, Krámsky 1969. 2 Note that a universal linguistic notion is not the same as a linguistic universal. A linguistic universal is a linguistic phenomenon which occurs in all languages; a linguistic notion can be defined for all lan- guages, but does not necessarily yield non-trivial phenomena in all languages. For a discussion, see § 1.3.4. 3 Smirnickij 1952 (1): 184, footnote 1. 4 Mel'cuk 1975 ['&gt;. 6. 5 Haugen 1951/19664 (4.1): 363.</page><page sequence="166">144 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS S 1.0.6 The prescriptive attitude towards terminology Some linguists and schools provide closed terminological systems, in which more or less rigorous definitions are assigned to a collection of terms. The majority of the terms are defined by their position with regard to other terms. Often, new terms are introduced and traditonal terms are reserved for the unique values which are at- tached to them in the system. Other terms, for which no use is found, are discarded. From now on, the current understanding of the term model which was established in (1/0/3/1), will be narrowed down to such systems, or parts of such systems, or pre- sumed parts of such systems. The following statement can now be added. (1/0/6/1) A model is a set of statements which contains explanatory chains of lin- guistic terms. Thus, a model contains explanations of linguistic terms with reference to other lin- guistic terms. This does not mean that all linguistic terms in a model are explained in terms of other linguistic terms; we cannot expect a model to be circular. Constraint (1/0/6/1) does require that a model contain at least one term which is not explained in isolation but with respect to other terms. Note that it is irrelevant thus far whether a model is presented as a theory, or as a hypothesis, or as a system for handling, pro- cessing, describing or analyzing linguistic events. Wherever necessary, a distinction will be made between full models (complete systems) and partial models or modules (fragments of full models). Modules will not automatically entail the actual existence of a full model which incorporates it. Sometimes it is only presumed that other parts can be constructed. On the other hand, a single module may be incorporated in two or more full models. Examples of full models are glossematics and generative grammar. The models of this study can be regarded as modules. Modules will be expounded in more detail in §1.5.2. The advantages of prescriptive systems (i.e. full models) are obvious. In principle they enable linguists to formulate all descriptions of individual languages in the same terms, which relieves them of the task of having to account for their own terminology when they are concerned with describing specific languages. But there are draw- backs to prescriptive systems. In the first half of this century, such "modern" linguists as Jespersen often ridiculed the imposition of the terminology of classical grammar onto barbarous languages like English.1 But other closed terminological systems are also liable to produce irrelevant or incomplete results: specific languages may contain phenomena which the system does not account for. An example is the I PA segmenta- tion of the vocal track: if the International Phonetic Alphabet would be the normative medium for communication about language sounds instead of the service tool it is to- day, phonetic descriptions of new languages or dialects would risk being incomplete. A closed system runs the risk of ignoring phenomena which are essential from some point of view, or declaring them non-linguistic, thus inhibiting the development of general linguistic theory. 1 Jespersen 1924 (13): 173-180 and Jespersen 1924 (23): 315-319 tackle the imposition onto English of, respectively, a case system and a mood system.</page><page sequence="167">CHAPTER 1 .0: INTRODUCTION 1 45 A fixed terminological system is in fact determined by a specific conception of lan- guage. There is no rigorous terminology without theory; in fact, each term implies an assertion. The prescriptive attitude results in exclusivist, or even Procrustean, sys- tems of connected assumptions about the nature of language. § 1.0.7 The descriptive attitude towards terminology The descriptive attitude is reflected in linguistic dictionaries. The entries in such dic- tionaries are mostly provided with two kinds of explanations. 1 In explanations of the first type, the concepts which correspond to the terms are indicated by examples. Sometimes, objects are named to which the term in question applies: (1/0/6/1) Vowels are, for example, [a], [e], [il [o], [ul Sometimes linguistic statements are mentioned in which the corresponding term is used: (1/0/6/2) Adjectives: the English adjective precedes the noun and follows a possible article. 2 In explanations of the second type, the listed terms are provided with one or more definitions and an indication of the linguists and schools who employ the terms and difinitions. Often conversions into the terminology of other schools and linguists are provided. Besides linguistic dictionaries, this kind of explanation is also pro- vided by specialized accounts of relationships between the terminologies of two schools, e.g. Haugen's comparison of Post-Bloomf ieldian and Hjelmslevian terminol- ogy1 and Platt's conversion of Fillmore's transformational deep case conceptions into a tagmemic framework.2 Explanations of the first type can be termed encyclopaedic. The encyclopaedic ap- proach does not differ from the practice of many ordinary dictionaries. As to the sec- ond type, if the dictionary does not provide conversions, it is simply a collection of prescriptive systems broken down into parts and arranged by the labels. If, however, conversions are given, the dictionary turns into something like a thesaurus. Conver- sions can be based on observations of two types. 1 The observation that phenomena that are covered by labels which are connected by conversion are similar or coincide. Such observations have an empirical basis. For example, a close relationship between moneme and morpheme can be estab- lished on account of the observation that the two terms appear to refer to the same phenomena. For this reason an indication of their convertibility is natural. 2 The observation that assumptions about language which are implied by the notions are similar or coincide. Such observations are common where the theoretical view- points on which the models are based are related. But they have hardly been in or- der when comparing notions that are embedded in widely divergent sets of as- sumptions about the cognitive object of linguistics. It has, for example, been cum- bersome to convert terms from a model which considers language to be a concrete 1 Haugen 1951/1966« (2.3, 2AÏ 358-359. * Platt 1971; Fillmore 1968.</page><page sequence="168">1 46 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS body of texts into terms of a model which takes language to be a capacity to gen- erate abstract sentences. The descriptive attitude towards terminology grants convenience to the eclectic de- scriptive linguist, who is relatively free to mould his terminology so as to fit his data (instead of having to mould data into terminology). The descriptive approach is espe- cially attractive to those linguists who consider linguistic concepts to have a separate intuitive existence in the minds of linguists and other people who reflect on language, independent of any definition which might be developed for the concepts. This state of affairs is widely accepted for language in general, and for many specialized languages of other disciplines, so there is no a priori reason to make an exception for the lan- guage of linguistic description. S 1.0.8 Terminology in the Set-theoretical School In the Set-theoretical School, three viewpoints can be found with respect to the is- sues which have been expounded above. 1 According to the first viewpoint, the advantages of the descriptive viewpoint should be cashed in on: there exists a metalinguistic reality which can only be ap- proximated by definitions. This does not mean that definitions are not necessary. They are a useful operational or heuristic device, as in example (1/0/6/2). This point of view is implied by Revzin in his earlier work. For example, when he finds that one of his models of case1 does not quite yield one of the traditional sets of cases for Russian, he resigns himself to the fact: rsuch a situation confronts us every time when we propose logical models for linguistic concepts. A model cannot exhaust linguistic reality."1 This point of view is also found in western mathematical linguistics. Compare Wilks on this issue. Actual billiard balls collect dust as they roll and slow down, so their experimental performance never quite lives up to their theoretical mathematical competence. [...] But this is true in every field and de- serves no special terminological recognition in the case of human speech or writing.2 A problem is that one linguist's dust is another linguist's billiard ball. The output of Revzin's [1965a] case model in fact represents a more accurate approximation of the traditional set of cases than its predecessors, but linguists who consider the exceptions to be the consequence of his conception of language rather than insuf- ficient detail of the model or disturbing non-linguistic factors, will never be satis- fied by such enhancements. Revzin's viewpoint that models are simplifications of reality3 implies that choices are made as to the aspects of the object of investiga- tion that are to be left out of consideration. Such choices may be obvious in the traditional natural sciences, but are the source of a great deal of disagreement among people who call themselves linguists. For models which define case' in terms of distributional properties, case forms which occur in identical contexts represent the unexplained residue which must be accounted for by linguistic dust; for models 1 Revzin 1965a: 759. 2 Wilks 1976: 61. 3 Revzin 1967b (1.4): 23-24, 1969a 12&gt;. 26-28.</page><page sequence="169">CHAPTER 1 .0: INTRODUCTION 1 47 which define case1 in terms of meaning, dust is invoked to explain the instances where contexts impede the expression of case meanings. The actual choices made in the identification of the billiard balls of linguistics will represent a criterion for the classification of the models in the present study. 2 The prescriptive viewpoint is also found. In this view, there is no expected set of cases which a model must yield. The structure of a model is determined only by its own mathematical requirements; traditional grammatical terminology is considered either an impediment to serious modelling or a mnemonic device. The most radical stance is taken by Kulagina. She discards all existing grammatical terminology ex- cept language, phrase and word, and proposes "the construction of a special gram- mar applicable to any language, and constructed in a way similar to mathematical theories".1 In Kulagina's view, models simply create their own metalinguistic reality instead of approximating an existing one. 3 A reconciliation between these points of view, which was essentially prompted by K-questions, was most explicitly formulated by Gladkij around 1970. On the one hand, he advocates the retention of traditional concepts, on the other hand, he is not satisfied with models which predictably fail to yield more than approximations of the concepts. If we are to approach the matter seriously, there caa of course, be no question of ignoring traditional language science and rejecting the concepts which it has developed and which have been used succes- fully for a very long time. The problem consists first of all in giving fist these notions a basis which could satisfy today's requirements on the logical structure of scientific concepts. The situation here is to a certain degree analogous to one which at one time occurred in geometry. The fundamental ideas of this science had been used for many centuries without any rigorous logical analysis. Such an analysis was made in the last century, but it did not at all mean that the old categories of geometry were abolished; these categories merely came to be clearer and more deeply understood.2 § 1.0.9 A format for linguistic models A frame of reference which accounts for the models of the Set-theoretical School must account for all three viewpoints described above, if only because the underlying ideas are not restricted to this school. The prescriptive attitude and the descriptive attitude are combined in an ideal lin- guistic thesaurus which provides a description of prescriptive systems, a catalogue of models. For each term included, the thesaurus should provide, besides other informa- tion, its exact position with respect to other terms for each model in which the term is employed. Besides describing terms in this way, it should also contain a frame of ref- erence, a format or meta-model, by which different models can be mapped onto each other and relationships can be determined between terms which belong to different prescriptive systems. Such a frame of reference will be sketched in this section and worked out in more detail in the following chapters. When constructing a format for linguistic models, we are, on a metalinguistic level, confronted with problems which are similar to the problems we face when we con- struct the linguistic models themselves. If we describe each full model in its own 1 Kulaeina I960: 228. 1958: 203. 2 Gladkij 1983: 188.</page><page sequence="170">148 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS terms, we cannot compare models. If, on the other hand, we impose a prescriptive system of describing models, we risk disregarding certain aspects of models which may be essential from a given point of view. As mentioned in § 1.0.7, there are two ap- proaches to comparing linguistic notions. The same applies to comparing linguistic models. 1 Models can be compared on a primary empirical basis: the point of departure is made up by the linguistic phenomena as they present themselves; models are dis- tinguished by the way in which they classify the phenomena and account for them. 2 Models can be compared on the basis of their own internal structure. The struc- ture of the models of the Set-theoretical School invites this approach, which, how- ever, presents a theoretical problem: the terms in which the structures are stated must be independent of any theoretical prejudices which might impose a structure on the models. In the present study, no solution is offered for this problem: no meta-language seems to be available which is guaranteed to be free of any theoretical biases. But it seems that the problem is less serious on a metalinguistic level than on a linguistic one: un- like primary linguistic models themselves, which deal with an indeterminate number of (classes of) phenomena and first-degree abstractions of raw, non-discrete material, a format for primary models deals with restricted numbers of phenomena of a clearly discrete nature. In other words, the material is less raw, and more amenable to anal- ysis. For this reason it seems probable that a comparison of models on a secondary empirical basis, i.e. on the basis of phenomena as they present themselves in linguistic models instead of in reality itself, will not be entirely unsuccessful. Finally, an evaluation of the performance of different models, i.e. their confronta- tion with empirically obtained phenomena of various sorts, is indispensible, and must be a part of the format. The format which is proposed in Part 1 and will be used in the remainder of the present study is based on properties which are presumed to characterize linguistic models, either implicitly or explicitly. It is a hypothesis which runs as follows. (1/0/9/1) Linguistic models are made up of five components. They are the following: (1/0/9/ la) 1 the technical connectives; (1/0/9/lb) 2 the initial elements and relations, and possible constraints; in the pre- sent study, this component will be referred to as the base component; (1/0/9/lc) 3 the derivations ("developments", deductions); in the present study, this component will be referred to as the development component; (I/O/9/ld) 4 the stock(s) of labels; (1/0/9/ le) 5 for all preceding components: sets of assertions about the correspon- dences between the components and aspects of reality; these asser- tions will be called reality claims. Two assertions may be put forward for the hypothesis in toto: a strong claim and a weak claim. The strong claim is the following.</page><page sequence="171">CHAPTER 1 .0: INTRODUCTION 1 49 (1/0/9/2) Any full model can be described exhaustively in terms of the components of (1/0/9/1). In other words, the hypothesis defines the class of (possible) linguistic models. The weak claim is the following. (1/0/9/3) There are full models which fit this hypothesis; the models treated in this study belong to this set or are parts of models that belong to this set. If strong claim (1/0/9/2) is maintained, the hypothesis is a theory of linguistic models. If weak claim (1/0/9/3) is maintained, the hypothesis is a system for describing a class of models. In this study, only the weak claim is endorsed; no effort will be made to support the strong claim. The weak claim implies that the morphosyntactic models of the Set-theoretical School fit the hypothesis: the present volumes contain all such models known to the writer. Thus, whereas in this study the statements concerning the models of the Set-theoretical School are to be taken as assertions, the statements about other prescriptive systems have the character of suggestions, and serve refer- ential and illustrative purposes. At this point our current understanding of the term model which was established in (1/0/2/1), (1/0/3/1) and (1/0/6/1), is narrowed down. From here onward the term will only be used for constructs which (supposedly) fit the hypothesis. The components which are distinguished in (1/0/9/1) are discussed in the next chapters. The fifth component will not be treated separately: the reality claims for the other components will be discussed along with their respective components.</page><page sequence="172">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES § 1.1.1 Logical symbols as technical connectives The term technical connective is used as an equivalent of Cooper's technical con- stant:1 in the present context the use of constant can be misleading. Consider the following linguistic statement. (1/1/1/1) A linguistic sign is a combination of a form and a meaning. In (1/1/1/1), we find three terms which we can probably classify as linguistic labels: {linguistic) sign, form and meaning. Besides, we find some occurrences of labels denot- ing concepts which connect the former labels, but do not appear to belong to a spe- cific metalanguage of linguistics: is, combination, of, and. Terms of the latter type will be called technical connectives. Now consider the following linguistic statement. (1/1/1/2) A form and a meaning make up a linguistic sign. In (1/1/1/1) and (1/1/1/2), we find the same linguistic terms, but different connecting words. Yet the two statements seem to be equivalent in their function of providing lin- guistic information. Note that the linguistic relevance of the content of (1/1/1/1) and (1/1/1/2), i.e. the state of affairs to which they refer, is not at issue here; nor are we dealing with the possible mutual relationships of (1/1/1/1) and (1/1/1/2) as objects of linguistic description. We are only dealing with their possible equivalence as answers to the following question. (1/1/1/3) What is a linguistic sign? In other words, what we are dealing with is the following question. (1/1/1/4) Are (1/1/1/1) and (1/1/1/2) the same (partial) model? If we assume that the answer to (1/1/1/4) is positive, we face the conclusion that some differences between technical connectives can be ignored in a comparison of linguis- tic models. In that case, comparison of models will be facilitated if a notation is em- ployed for technical connectives which discards redundant differences which appar- ently exist between linguistic statements. For this purpose, a unified system of techni- cal connectives will be useful: a closed set of symbols to which the undefined set of technical connectives can be reduced. Such a set of symbols is offered by mathematical logic, including set theory. It has in fact been adopted by the Set-theoretical School. The adoption of the symbols of mathematical logic implies the acceptance of two presuppositions. (1/1/1/5) Any possible technical connectives are equivalent to an element, or a combination of elements, of a finite set of technical connectives. (1/1/1/6) The equivalence which is canonized by mathematical logic actually covers the functional equivalence of the connectives in linguistic statements. 1 Or, more precisely, primitive technical constant: cf. Cooper 1964 (2.1): 17, (6): 51. 150</page><page sequence="173">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 1 5 1 These presuppositions can only be verified by intuition. But intuition has been made explicit by mathematical logic for other disciplines, and there is no reason to doubt its applicability in linguistics. In the present study, intuition will also be relied on in rewriting non-formalized models in set-theoretical terms. On the other hand, once the adoption of logical sym- bols as technical connectives has been accepted in principle, it is not necessary to use them everywhere. As pointed out by Kaluznin, there is no fundamental barrier between the use of "natural" language and some denotation system for making consis- tent statements: historically, symbolic systems have only gradually been extracted from "natural" language in various branches of mathematics and other exact disci- plines while, on the other hand, the use of "natural" language in such sciences has been subject to increasing standardization.1 Many of the set-theoretical models as discussed in these volumes were originally denoted wholly or partly without the use of symbols. It is sufficient that the symbols be there to be resorted to when a great de- gree of precision is needed; even then, symbols are not necessary if the verbal ac- count evokes the canonical technical connectives in a sufficiently unambiguous man- ner. Ultimately, the degree to which symbols are actually used depends on the per- sonal taste of the investigator (and his or her expectations of that of the readers). From here on, our current understanding of the term model which has been valid since (1/0/9/1), will be narrowed down as a result of the following statement. (1/1/1/7) The technical connectives of a model can be (re)written as logical symbols. The reason which is given here for the introduction of symbols is the facilitation of comparison of models. Rigour is another argument which may be given for it. Consider the following sequence of linguistic statements. (1/1/1/8) There is an object x. (1/1/1/9) x is a phoneme. (1/1/1/10) x is not a phoneme. This combination of linguistic statements is unsatisfactory in a linguistic model. Note that the sequence is perfectly acceptable as an object of linguistic description: it has proved its existence by being there. But the contradiction which is contained in it renders it useless as a means of describing language, because, intuitively, it does not provide meaningful answers to any linguistic questions. The above example is obvious and trivial, but in complex models contradiction and ambiguity may be concealed in large numbers of statements.2 Using a logical notation will make it easier to pinpoint contradictions because combining logical symbols is subject to well-defined rules which make intuitions about rigour explicit. 1 KaluZnin 1962: 25-28 and passim. ¿ Language is, of course, as ambiguous as a user wants it to be. But formalization as a means of disciplin- ing scientific communication can be useful even for mathematical linguists. A case in point is Revzin's definition of 'word', which will be presented in §2.1.4: it employs a non-formalized auxiliary definition of structural segmentation, which allows for at least two different formal definitions yielding different sets of words for a language.</page><page sequence="174">152 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS It should be noted that the mathematical apparatus is not imposed on language it- self. As Hockett puts it, "the circle is not in fact closed: the mathematician derives his notions by abstraction from language, whereas we are deriving, not language itself, but a way of handling language, from mathematics".1 Thus, what is introduced here, is not the use of logic: 1 for the purpose of semantic representation of natural language, as in Montague Grammar or Functional Grammar; 2 or as elements of a deep structure alphabet, as proposed, for instance, by Seuren and Paduõeva,2 3 or as Lakoffs "natural logic".3 Logical symbols are introduced here, not as a device for the representation of (some aspects of) all sentences, but as substitutes for a class of signs in the language of lin- guistic description, a language which serves a limited special purpose. The distinction of these two levels of formalization of semantics in linguistics, i.e. of the semantics of a given mathematical model of language, and of the semantics of a modelled object-lan- guage, is rarely made explicit by formal linguists. Exceptions are Novak4 and, espe- cially, Srejder, who not only insists on the distinction of the two levels, but also em- phasizes the mutual independence of their application.5 The use of a formalized lan- guage of linguistic description does not exclude the use of logical symbols for seman- tic representation as well; but in the latter function the symbols are not technical connectives but concepts in a linguistic theory and, as such, belong to a different component.6 We may be interested in the (full) models which make use of mathematical symbols that do not occur in the standard stock of set theory. Generative grammar is an example. Cooper, who at the time was one of the few western investigators to promote the use of set-theory in linguistics, can be quoted here. Some systems of linguistic analysis have already been formulated in terms of specialized mathematical notations of a restricted sort. If set theory is regarded merely as an addition to this list, in competition with the rest, the point of using an extremely general formalism such as set theory will have been lost. Set theory is intended to serve a purpose of a different sort from that of these or other systems. Previous mathematically-formulated linguistic systems have been designed to provide a restricted mathematical framework suitable only for those specific notions central to the particular system of linguistic analy- sis. Set theory, by contrast, is intended more as a universal system which does not depend on any par- ticular linguistic notions, but rather provides a foundation broad enough to support the existing sys- tems, and hopefully future systems also.7 1 Hockett 1954/19664 (7.1): 397, footnote 14; original underlining. 1 Seuren 1969, PaduCeva 1972, 1973. 3 E.g. in Lakof f 1970/19722. 4 Novak 1966: 155. 5 Srejder 1973c: 260; 1973b: 77-78; 1971a (2.5): 55. The description of Srejder's first level is somewhat distorted in the English version by incorrect and incomplete translation. The sentence which starts in Srejder 1973c: 260, line 3 must be read approximately as follows. (The underlined words are missing in the original translation.) Hlie first level of formalization consists of a precise description [or denotation or representation, but not definition: opisanie] of the observable primary [isxodnvf objects in a language which attains a mathematical level of rigour. 6 This point will be returned to in §6.6ff. 7 Cooper 1964 (1): 15.</page><page sequence="175">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 1 53 Some models employ non-standard connectives which indicate (derived) set-theoreti- cal notions and can be converted into, or redefined in terms of, more basic set-theo- retical notions. Conversion may, however, be quite problematic in cases when symbols are employed as technical connectives but at the same time imply claims about the structure of language; a format for describing linguistic models must separate these aspects. Thus, the rewriting symbol -* is merely a technical connective if it is used as a means to define the set of sentences in a language; but if it carries implications about the actual process of producing a sentence, it must be accounted for as a the- ory-specific linguistic notion.1 S 1.1.2 Some basic notions of set theory and symbolic logic This and the next few sections contain a brief exposition of the set-theoretical and logical notions used in this study. In the seventies, the market abounded with intro- ductions to mathematics for linguists.2 In this chapter, little will be added to those in- troductions. The present exposition mainly serves to make this study self-contained and to delimit explicitly the (small) selection of concepts that is used in the present study.3 Since the study is primarily concerned with the linguistic relevance of models, no attempt is made to provide an in-depth mathematical foundation for the concepts introduced. For example, no consistent distinction is made between primary and de- rived mathematical concepts (which does not, of course detract from the pivotal posi- tion which is assigned, in this study, to the distinction of primary and derived linguistic concepts). Also, an attempt has been made to minimize the inventory of mathematical symbols and concepts. Thus, in the trade-off between minimalizing the inventory of available symbols and minimalizing the number of symbol occurrences in a formula, the former option is favoured.4 In this section, some basic notions and symbols are introduced; in the following sections, special attention will be paid to types of relations between sets, classifica- tion systems and features. Readers who are informed on these subjects or are not particularly interested in them, are advised to skip these sections and consult them according to their needs when reading the rest of these volumes. The connectives = 'is equal to', and * 'is not equal to' require no comment. 1 Conversions of parts of Chomsky's model into more general mathematical terms have been provided by Cooper [1964 (5.5): 42ff.] and Srejder [1971a (2.6): 58-60; 1973b (prilozenie): 81-82; 1973c (appendix 1): 263-2641. 2 To mention but a few introductions in English: Hockett 1966/1967, Ortiz &amp; Zierer 1968, Brainerd 1971, Gross 1972, Wall 1972, Zierer 1972, Allwood &amp; al. 1977, Hall Partee 1978; since McCawley 1981 the lin- guists' appetite for formalization, or their need for retraining, seems to have been satiated. 3 The overlap between the books mentioned is less than might be expected: apparently, the linguistic ap- plications of mathematics are manifold. Among the above titles, Wall 1972 offers the greatest coverage of the type of mathematics used in this study; it also appears to be the most user-friendly introduction to mathematics for linguists. 4 The present writer now regrets some of these choices. For example, for denoting the union of a series of sets, instead of such denotations as K[w' ) u . . . u K{wn), as employed in (2.2.19.8) and in many other places, the more usual denotation U K(u?t) would presently be preferred. lsisn</page><page sequence="176">154 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS The set is the basic primitive notion of set theory. A set is rany collection of defi- nite, well-distinguished objects, either of perception or thought."1 These objects are referred to as members, or elements, of the set. Sets can be members of other sets. It is possible for a set to contain only one member. The solitary element does not coin- cide with the set which contains that element. A set is considered to be determined once we can decide for each object whether or not it is a member of the set.2 This knowledge is provided in either of two ways: extensionally or intensionally. Extensionally determined sets will be dealt with first. A set is determined exten- sionally if its members are enumerated. Consider a set which contains Gorbaõev, Cernenko and Andropov as its members. It is denoted as follows. {Gorbaõev, Cernenko, Andropov] (1.1.2.1) The members of a set are separated by commas. Braces indicate sets. Incomplete enumeraton of a set is indicated with dots. {Gorbaõev, Cernenko, Andropov, . . . } (1.1.2.2) Sets are identical if they contain the same members. Thus, {Gorbaõev, Cernenko, Andropov) = {Cernenko, Andropov, Gorbaõev} = {Andropov, Cernenko, Gorbaõev, Andropov} (1.1.2.3) Sets can be given names. E.g. we define Q = {Gorbaõev, Cernenko, Andropov] (1.1.2.4) The symbol e indicates that the element preceding it is a member of the set which follows. The symbol € indicates that the element preceding it does not belong to the set which follows. Thus, Gorbaõev e Q (1.1.2.5) Breïnevt Q (1.1.2.6) Two names may refer to the same object. If they do not, this is stated explicitly. Here is an example. Suppose that (1.1.2.7), (1.1.2.8) and (1.1.2.9) hold. W = { Andropov, Cernenko } (1.1 .2.7) Gorbaõev * Andropov (1.1.2.8) Gorbaõev * Cernenko (1.1 .2.9) It follows that Gorbaõev € W (1.1.2.10) 1 Cantor 19622 (Ik 282. ¿ Srejder 1971b (priloZenie 2h 228.

Sixanovio's protest against Srejder's formulation in the footnote on that page.</page><page sequence="177">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 155 Sets are usually written in capitals; elements in lower case italics. Depending on the available means, sets of sets are indicated with special typographic devices. In these volumes bold sanserif type will be used. Sets of sets are distinguished from unions of sets. The union S of sets P and Q is the set of elements which belong to either P or Q, or both. The symbol u between two sets is used to denote their union. Here is an example, where R is defined as the set of sets P and Q. P = { Breinev, Andropov, Cernenko } ( 1 . 1 .2. 1 1 ) Q = { Andropov, Cernenko, Gorbaõev} ( 1 . 1 .2. 12) R = {P&gt; Q} = { {Breènev, Andropov, Cernenko}, {Andropov, Cernenko, Gorbaõev} } (1.1.2.13) S = P U Q = {BreÉnev, Andropov, Cernenko, Andropov, Cernenko, Gorbaõev} = {Bre¿nev, Andropov, Cernenko, Gorbaõev} (1.1.2.14) R*S (1.1.2.15) The intersection of two or more sets is the set which contains the elements which are common to those sets. The symbol n between two sets is employed to denote their in- tersection. Thus, the following intersection T of the sets P and Q given above is found. T = P n Q = {Andropov, Cernenko} (1.1.2.16) Set A is a subset of set B, or A c B, if the members of A are also members of B. For the above example, we can conclude, say, that TCP (1.1.2.17) That is: {Andropov, Cernenko} c {Bre¿nev, Andropov, Cernenko} (1.1.2.18) If A c B and B c A, then A = B. If A c B and A * B, then A is the proper subset of B. The improper subset of B is the subset which coincides with B. In A ' B, the symbol ' indicates the set of elements in A which are not members of B. Thus, P'T= {Breïnev} (1.1.2.19) The intensional method of determining a set proceeds by means of a criterion which enables one to decide for any object whether or not it belongs to the set. A statement is formulated which contains a variable. (1/1/2/1) x is a party secretary-general. Or: (1/1/2/2) x is a Soviet communist.1 For each object taking the place of x, it can be decided whether (1/1/2/1) is true or false. The decision may result from a formal procedure, or from an intuitive, but ex- 1 The last revision of the text of this chapter took place in the 1980s.</page><page sequence="178">156 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS plicit, judgement. If the statement is found true for a specific object, this object be- longs to the set for which the statement is used as a criterion. An intensionally determined set is indicated by the criterion statement, preceded by the labels of the variables used and separated from the latter by a vertical bar. In these statements, the connective symbols A and V can be employed for making up compound statements. The expression a A b, where a and b are statements, means 'a and b'; the expression aV b means 'a, or b, or both'. An example. If G is the set of party secretaries-general and C is the set of Soviet communists, the intersection of these sets, which contains the secretaries-general of the Soviet Communist Party, can be denoted as follows. GDC={x|xeGAxeC} (1.1.2.20) The set which contains both Soviet Communists and foreign secretaries-general is denoted as follows. GUC= {x|xe GVxe C} (1.1.2.21) The set of Soviet communists who are not secretaries-general is denoted as follows. C'G={x|xeCAxéG} (1.1.2.22) If there is no x such that the statement which determines a set is true, the set is empty. There is only one ("the") empty sei, which is denoted as #, with no braces. Extensive use will be made of quantifiers. The symbol V denotes the existential quantifier.^ For an example, consider the formula Vt|&gt;(a) (1.1.2.23) a Here a denotes a variable and ip(a) denotes a statement which contains a. Formula (1.1.2.23) reads as follows. (1/1/2/3) There is an a such that &lt;|j is true. Correspondingly, the universal quantifier is denoted by A.2 Thus, formula A*(a) (1.1.2.23) a reads as follows. (1/1/2/4) For all a it holds that i|&gt; is true. The quantified variable is usually accompanied by a limitation on the values which it can take: if a stands for any conceivable item in the universe, then t|&gt; is likely to be tautological statement. This limitation, e.g. the set of possible values of a, is the do- main of discourse for the quantified expression.3 1 The symbol V is equivalent to 3. 2 The symbol A is equivalent to V. 3 Cf. Wall 1972 (3&gt;. 58.</page><page sequence="179">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 1 57 Here are two more examples. Consider the set P of persons, its subset PM of male persons, i.e. PM c p, and set dp) of children of a person p, i.e. p e P. One of the (many) ways to define set B(y) of broth- ers, including half-brothers, of a person y, where y e P, is the following. B(y) ={x|xGPMAx^yA V(xg C(a) Aye C(a))} (1.1.2.24) ae? This is read as follows. (1/1/2/5) The brothers of a person y are all male persons who are not identical to y and for whom there is (at least) one parent who is also a parent of y. The set of full brothers of a person y can be defined as follows. BF(y) = {* I * e PM A x * y A A (x e C(a) Aye C(a) Vxí C(a) Ayí Cía))} (1.1.2.25) ae? This is read as follows. (1/1/2/6) The full brothers of a person y are all male persons x who are not identical to y, and each person a either is a parent of both x and y or is not a parent of either x or y. The last part of (1.1.2.25) can be abbreviated by the introduction of the implication symbol =&gt;. If a and b are assertions, then a*b (1.1.2.26) means (1/1/2/7) If a is true then b is also true. Similarly, &lt;=^ indicates mutuai implication. The formula a*=*b (1.1.2.27) means that: (1/1/2/8) a is true if and only if b is true. Using the implication sign, (1.1.2.25) can be abbreviated as follows. BF(y) = {x|xe pMAx*yA A (x e C(a) &lt;=* y e C(a))} (1.1.2.28) ae? This can be read as follows. (1/1/2/9) The full brothers of a person y are all male persons x who are not identical to y, and for each person a it holds that if a is a parent of x, then a is also a parent of y, and if a is a parent of y, then a is also a parent of x. The use of implication =&gt; instead of mutual implication &lt;=» would not be sufficient inasmuch as it would make the biblical Adam a brother of y: all parents of Adam are also parents of the rest of us, but the converse does not hold. Unintended "parasitic"</page><page sequence="180">158 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS elements such as the biblical Adam will sometimes be found in the definitions dis- cussed in the present study. § 1.1.3 Power sets One sometimes has occasion to refer to the set X*(X) which contains the subsets of set X: X1X)={X'|X'CX} (1.1.3.1) Set X*(X) is called the power set1 or Boolean of X. Here is an example: assume that X={xi,X2,x3} (1.1.3.2) Then, XIX) = {0, {xil {x2}, {x3}, {xi,x2}, {xlfx3}, {x2,x3}, {x!,x2,x3}} (1.1.3.3) The proper subsets of X are the sets in X*(X) which do not coincide with X. Power sets will be used for establishing typologies of classifications and relations which show properties with empirical appeal. First, relations as such will be presented. S 1.1.4 Order So far, we have been discussing only unordered sets. Besides these, ordered sets, or ordered n-tupies, will be used in this study. In this presentation, ordered sets are assumed to be derived from positive inte- gers, i.e. numbers of the series 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . , n, which, consequently, must be consid- ered a part of the set-theoretical apparatus. There is some disagreement as to whether positive integers are primitive or derived notions. Alternative definitions of ordered sets may in fact avoid the use of numbers.2 Ordered sets are sets of objects which themselves are sets (pairs) containing two objects, one of which is a positive integer, e.g. {r, 5}. The relative order in any pair of numbers is conventionally indicated as follows: &lt; 'lower than'; ^ 'not higher than1; &gt; "higher than'; £ hot lower than'. (1.1.4.1) Each number occurs in only one pair in an ordered set; the ocurrence of a number in one pair implies the occurrence of all lower numbers in the other pairs in the set. An example: {{o, 1}, {r,5}, {e,4}, {2,r}, {d,3}, {7,d}, {e,6}} (1.1.4.2) Ordered sets are conventionally indicated by round brackets, the members being enumerated in the order of the corresponding numbers, which can therefore be omit- ted. Set (1.1.4.2) is then denoted as (o, r, d, e, r, e, d) (1.1.4.3) 1 Cf. Wall 1972 (l&gt;. 8. 2 Cf. the discussion in Quine 1960 C7.53): 257ff.: one of the options mentioned there, viz. order expressed as a set of sets, is virtually used in example (1.1.19.3).</page><page sequence="181">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 1 59 An n-tuple has n places. Example (1.1.4.3) is a 7-tuple. An object which fills a place is a term. An ordered set with two places is an ordered pair. In ordered sets, each number is associated to only one element. If a positive inte- ger is associated to two or more elements of a set, we are dealing with partial order. Besides positive integers, two more numerical symbols will be used in dealing with ordered sets: the zero symbol 0 and the infinity symbol °o. The symbol 0 is a shorthand symbol, which is used to facilitate comparison of or- dered sets: when an ordered set X coincides with another ordered set Y except for the fact that Y contains an element which is ordered before the lowest element of X, assigning 0 to the first place of Y enables us to express the relationship between X and y more clearly than by raising the numbers of all elements of Y by one.1 Thus, in order to facilitate comparison with (1.3.4.3), the ordered set (b, o, r, d, et r, e, d) (1.1.4.4) may be denoted as Ho, 1}, {r,5}, {e,4}, {2,r}, {d,3}, {7,d}, {e,6}, {b,0}} (1.1.4.5) instead of {{o,2}, {r,6}, {e,5}, {3,r}, {d,4}, {8,d}, {e,7}, {b, l}} (1.1.4.6) The purport of the infinity symbol &lt;» varies according the kind of mathematics in which it is used. In this study it will be used in examples to indicate the empty place, i.e. for labelling elements x of a set X such that a definition of a specific (partial) order on X does not enable the assignment of a specific place number to x. Such definitions will be found from §3.2.5 onwards. § 1.1.5 Relations A set of ordered n-tuples is an n-ary or n-place relation. A set of ordered pairs is a binary or two-place relation. A relation is conventionally indicated by italic capitals. Consider two sets P and N. The complete set of ordered pairs the first term of which is a member of P and the second term of which is a member of N, is the Carte- sian product of P and N. It is denoted as P * N. Example if P-ÍPi.PaPs} (1.1.5.1) and if N={nifn2} (1.1.5.2) then the Cartesian product of P and N is P x N = {(pi, n'' (pi, 712), (pz n{lt (pa n2&gt;, (p3, n'' (pa n2)} (1.1.5.3) 1 Negative integers may be resorted to for the same purpose, to express correspondences involving two or more preposed elements, but this study does not require them.</page><page sequence="182">160 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS A relation is said to hold between two sets P and N if the first term of each pair in the relation is an element of P and the second term of each pair is an element of N, i.e. if it is a subset of PxN.1 For an illustration, interpret P as the set of persons and N as the set of names. Any relation R of naming is a subset of P * N. Relations may exist within a set; for instance, if P = N, then P x N = P x P. Set P x P is termed the Cartesian square of P. Sets may also overlap partly, as in the 'mother - daughter' relation: childless women are found only as a second term, whereas the bib- lical Eve is only found as a first term. For each relation /?, there is a converse relation R' which contains the same pairs as R but with all terms interchanged. The converse relation of 'being a parent of is 'being a child of. § 1.1.6 Exhaustiveness and exclusiveness: functions It is possible to classify relations between two sets according to certain specific properties they possess. A function, for example, is a relation between two sets with certain specific properties. The properties which play a role in set-theoretical lin- guistics can be reduced to the two basic properties which are introduced here: ex- haustiveness and exclusiveness. First, exhaustiveness is defined. A relation R between the sets P and N, where /?cpxN, is exhaustive for? if it involves all elements of P, i.e. if A V (p,n)e R (1.1.6.1) pe P ne N Conversely, R is exhaustive for N if it involves all members of N, i.e. if A V (p,n)e R (1.1.6.2) neN pe P As an example, interpret P, N, and R as, respectively, the set of persons, the set of names, and the naming relation. If every person has a name, R is exhaustive for P; if there are names which do not belong to any person, R is not exhaustive for N. Exclusiveness is defined as follows. A relation R between the sets P and N, i.e. where R c p x n, is exclusive for P if each member of P involved at all in R occurs in only one pair in K, i.e. if A A A («p, m) e R A (p, n2) e R) * n{ = n2) (1.1.6.3) pe? nieN n2eN Conversely, R is exclusive for N if each member of N involved in R occurs in only one pair of Ä, i.e. if A A A (((pi, n) e R A (p2, n) e R)) =&gt;Pl =p2) (1.1.6.4) P'e? p2eP neN 1 In this study, binary relations are considered to be subsets of Cartesian products, rather than to be deter- mined bv such subsets, as in Srejder 1970 (1): 301. The present writer hopes and expects that this simplifi- cation will not affect the arguments in this study.</page><page sequence="183">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 161 Thus, if no person would have more than one name, R would be exclusive for P; if no name would be borne by more than one person, R would be exclusive for N. Exhaustiveness and exclusiveness are mutually independent properties. They en- able us to identify some basic types of relations. Some of these are widely known (e.g. functions) whereas other types are hitherto unnamed. The following convention will be used for indicating these relations. The symbol R indicates the set of possible relations between P and N, i.e. the power set of the Cartesian product P * N. Set R is the union of the subsets which each contain relations of one of the types which are defined by the two properties. These properties are in- dicated by four indices; the top indices indicate exhaustiveness; the bottom indices exclusiveness; the left-hand indices the first term of the relations; the right-hand in- dices the second term of the relations. The indices have three values: + contains relations with the property in question and does not contain relations without if; - 'does not contain relations with the property in question and contains relations without it1; 0 contains relations with, as well as without, the property in question1. For example, f?+° is the set of relations R between P and N such that R is both exclu- sive and exhaustive for P. Here are some types of relations, defined in terms of exhaustiveness and exclu- siveness. 1 Many-to-many relations (fl°^J are non-exclusive for both the first- and the second- term sets. They can be exemplified by a state of affairs where persons have more than one name and share names with other persons. It is not excluded that there are persons without names or names without persons. 2 One-to-many relations (fl°2+) are non-exclusive for the first-term set and exclusive for the second-term set. An example is the relation 'husband of in a society in which polygamy for men occurs, but not for women; bachelors and spinsters are tolerated. 3 Many-to-one relations (R°+J are the converse of one-to-many relations: they are exclusive for their first-term sets and non-exclusive for their second-term sets. An example is the relation 'wife of in the society of the previous example. 4 Functions {R*?o' or mappings, are a very popular type of relation. They are both exhaustive and exclusive for their first-term sets. Example: the relation child of between the set of people and the set of women. Situations where all women have children, women have more than one child, or women have no child are not ex- cluded. Depending on the exhaustiveness value for the second-term set, different types of functions can be distinguished. Consider the following. 5 Onto functions [R*£): a relation between P and N is a function of P onto N if all mem- bers of N are involved in the function, i.e. if the relation is exhaustive for both sets, besides being exclusive for the first-term set. An example is the relation child of between the set of people and the set of mothers: every child has a unique mother, while a mother must have at least one child.</page><page sequence="184">162 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS 6 Into functions (R*+o): a function between P and N is a function of P into N if not all elements of N are involved in the function, i.e. if the function is not exhaustive for the second-term set. An example is the relation child of between children and women, when childless women are known to occur. 7 Reverse functions (R%) need no comment. Distinction can be made between off re- verse functions (ff^+) and out of(fT^) reverse functions. 8 One-to-one correspondences in the proper sense (/?*++) are a frequently used type of relation: for each element of P, there is exactly one element of N, and for each element of N, there is exactly one element of P. The relation is both exhaustive and exclusive for both the first-term and the second-term sets. The sets necessarily contain the same number of elements. An example: the relation 'wife of between the sets of married women and married men in a monogamous society without bache- lors. 9 If exhaustiveness conditions are either dropped or inverted, weaker varieties of one-to-one correspondence can be defined, which can be termed one-to-one rela- tions (for instance R°£. or /?^J. Examples are 'wife of between women and men in monogamous societies with no indication as to bachelors and unmarried women (for /?!£.), or where monks and nuns are known to exist (for R~^). A classification of relations between sets in the above manner is of interest when we wish to describe the constraints which in some models are imposed on the structure of language or languages. Consider, for example, the statement (1/1/6/1) There is no pure synomymy . Statement (1/1/6/1) can be formulated as a special property of the binary relation M of meaning between a set A of signifiants and a set P of signifiés in a Saussurean type of model: (1/1/6/2) M is exclusive for P. or Me R$ (1.1.6.5) Adding the statement (1/1 /6/3) Every language has homony my. results in Me fl™ (1.1.6.6) i.e. (1/1/6/4) M is non-exclusive for A and exclusive for P. or (1/1 /6/5) M is a one-to-many relation. Formulae (1.1.6.5) and (1.1.6.6) restrict the set of possible languages as compared to a model which admits any binary relation of meaning M e /? or</page><page sequence="185">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 1 63 M€ flg (1.1.6.7) One more example. Consider a traditional generative model which contains a set 7 of transformations. A transformation can be regarded as a relation between two sets of structures.1 Assume that the model permits transformations to contain options. If A, B and C are sets of sentence structures with specific properties, and the symbol -► de- notes the transformation relation between structures, this situation is often denoted in the following manner. A- {£} (1.1.6.8) It is easy to see that for the given model, if no further constraints are introduced, 7c R£ (1.1.6.9) If a constraint is introduced which stipulates that no transformations are optional, 7 becomes a set of onto functions, i.e. 7c R% (1.1.6.10) Properties which are similar to those which have been introduced in this section for two-place relations can also be distinguished for n-place relations where n &gt; 2, with more complicated results. Consider, for instance, the relation 'father - mother - child1, which just fails to be exhaustive for the child' place because of Adam and Eve. Such relations need no further clarification here. § 1.1.7 Operations So far, properties of binary relations have been considered between sets which do not necessarily coincide or overlap. Certain types of relation requiring that the involved sets wholly or partly include each other will be discussed in this and the next sections. An operation is a two-place relation which is exclusive and exhaustive for the first place (i.e. it is a function) and for which the second-term set is a (usually improper) subset of the first-term set. Thus, R is an operation of N on P if: ÄePxN (1.1.7.1) Re R* (1.1.7.2) NCP (1.1.7.3) The standard example of an operation is square, which is a mapping of numbers onto their squares: it will contain ordered pairs such as (3, 9). An example of a three-place operation is 'addition', which contains triples such as (3, 5, 8). In this case, the third place is a function of the first and the second place. S 1.1.8 Reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity This and the following sections discuss a special set R*(P) of binary relations R with the following properties. 1 Cf . Allwood &amp; al. 1977(2.4): 11.</page><page sequence="186">164 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS 1 The first-term sets and second-term sets are identical, i.e. fl* is a subset of the power set of the Cartesian square of a set P. 2 All elements of P are involved in R. This provides the following definition of fliP). fliP) = {/?|flCPxPA A V ((pi,p2)e i?V(p2,pi)e R)} (1.1.8.1) PieP P2e? Three properties which characterize subsets of R*{?) are introduced below: reflexiv- ity, symmetry and transitivity. These properties are frequently employed in set-theo- retical linguistics. 1 Reflexivity: a relation R is said to be reflexive if all elements of P are in relation R to themselves. Thus, set fl^tP) of reflexive relations over P is defined as follows. fl^tP) = {R | R e A?1P) A A (p, p) € R] (1.1.8.2) peP An example is the relation of knowing in the set of persons, at least if we assume that everyone knows himself. 2 Symmetry: a relation R is said to be symmetric if, whenever an element of P is in relation R to another element of P, the reverse is also true. Thus, set Rsy{?) of symmetric relations over P is defined as follows. Rsy(?)= {R'Re R*(?) A A A ((pi,p2&gt;G /?A(p2,pi)e AV(p!,p2)^ /?A(p2,pi)£ /?)} (1.1.8.3) PieP P2^P With the aid of the implication symbol, (1.1.8.3) can be abbreviated as follows. Rsy(?) = {R | R g fliP) A A A ((pi, p2) e R =* (p2, pi) e R)} (1.1.8.4) PieP p2eP A case in point is the relation 'married to1 among married persons. Note that this symmetric relation is split into two asymmetric relations if we consider the com- monest Russian renderings of 'married to': ¿enát s indicates the 'man - woman' pairs, whereas zámuZem za indicates the 'woman - man1 pairs. 3 Transitivity: a relation R is said to be transitive if, wherever an element of P makes up a pair in relation R with another element of P, and this second element of P makes up a pair in relation R with a third element of P, then the first element of P also makes up a pair in relation R with the third element. Thus, set Rtr(?) of transi- tive relations over P is defined as follows. Rtr(?) = {R | R e /?1P) A A A A (((pi, p2) g R A (p2, p3) e H) =&gt; (plf pj g R)} pie? p2eP p3eP (1.1.8.5) An example of a transitive relation is 'older than' in the set of persons: if pi is older than p2, and p2 is older than p$ then p' is older than ps.</page><page sequence="187">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 165 Ref lexivity, symmetry and transitivity are mutually independent properties: they may occur separately or in combination. In the following sections, three of their possible combinations will receive special attention, viz. equivalence, tolerance and domi- nance. § 1.1.9 Equivalence A relation R is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Set WP) of equivalence relations over set P is defined as follows. Re(?) = flre(p) n físy(?) n /jtr(p) (1.1.9.1) An example of an equivalence relation is as old as1. It is: 1 reflexive: a person is as old as himself; 2 symmetric: if pi is as old as p2, it follows that p2 is as old as pi; 3 transitive: if pi is as old as p2 and p2 is as old as p3, it follows that pi is as old as p3. Equivalence is popular as an abstraction tool for handling observed phenomena in a first-level empirical approach: it models perceived or desired identity or equality. In descriptive linguistics, the abstract equivalence relation of 'speaking the same dialect' is often taken as a point of departure for further description. § 1.1.10 Tolerance A relation R is a tolerance relation if it is reflexive and symmetric (but not necessarily transitive). Set RK?) of tolerance relations over set P is defined as follows. m?) = Rre(?) n Rsy(?) (1.1.10.1) An equivalence relation is a special case of a tolerance relation.1 An example of a tolerance relation is 'within a distance of fifteen kilometres from1, which is: 1 reflexive: The Hague is within a distance of fifteen kilometres from The Hague; 2 symmetric: if The Hague is within fifteen kilometres from Leiden, then Leiden is within fifteen kilometres from The Hague; 3 not necessarily transitive: if Leiden is within fifteen kilometres from The Hague and Delft is within fifteen kilometres from The Hague, it is not necessarily true that Delft is within a distance of fifteen kilometres from Leiden. Tolerance is sometimes used as an abstraction tool for dealing with observed phe- nomena: it models perceived similarity. Usually it is resorted to when phenomena re- sist being moulded in equivalence models. In dialectology, the tolerance relation of 'mutual intelligibility' between idiolects often replaces the 'speaking the same language1 of descriptive linguistics. In a large dialect space like that of the West Germanic lan- guages of Continental Europe, there is no mutual intelligibility between the idiolects at the far ends, say Holland and Austria, but there is mutual intelligibility between the idiolects of each pair of contiguous small areas. 1 A most interesting exploration of the properties of tolerance relations is Srejder 1971b {3k 78-1 13.</page><page sequence="188">1 66 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS § 1.1.11 Dominance A relation R is a dominance relation if it is reflexive and transitive (but not necessar- ily symmetric). Set ff^P) of dominance relations over set P is defined as follows. fifflP) = frei?) n /Fr(P) (1.1.11.1) An equivalence relation is a special case of a dominance relation.1 An example: imagine a situation in which it is possible to determine whether a per- son understands the speech of another person. Let R denote the relation 'is fully un- derstood by' between idiolects. Consider the situation in Abkhazia, which is inhabited by native speakers p' of Georgian, and by Abkhazians P2 who speak Abkhaz besides Georgian. Then (P!,P2)g ÄA(p&amp;pi)e R (1.1.11.2) i.e. pi dominates p2 but P2 does not dominate p'. For ease of recognition in graphical representations, arrows will occasionally be used to denote elements of dominance relations. Thus, the first half of (1.1.11.2) may be denoted as P!-p2 (1.1.11.3) or, whenever it is necessary to specify the relation, Pi1T"*P2 (1.1.11.4) Similarly, the second half of (1.1.1 1.2) may be denoted as p2^p! (1.1.11.5) or P2-^Pi (1-111-6) Expanding on the above example, let us presume that both p' and p2 have learned Russian at school. Then the following dominance relation R holds among speaker p' of Georgian, speaker p2 of Abkhaz and speaker p3 of Russian. Ä - {(Pi. Pi). (Pi. P2&gt;. (Pa P2&gt;. fe Pi). (P3. P2&gt;. (P3» P3&gt; 1 (1. 1. 1 1.7) Since reflexivity and transitivity are defining properties of dominance, which need not be stated separately once R is identified as a dominance relation, we can omit arrows which connect identical elements, and arrows which directly connect elements which are also connected indirectly. Thus, (1.1.11.7) can be abbreviated as follows. P3-Pi-*P2 (1.1.11.8) Dominance is used as an abstraction tool for dealing with observed phenomena: it models perceived or desired hierarchical relationships. As the above example shows, dominance relations may replace the tolerance relations of dialectology in a sociolin- 1 In fuzzy subset theory, the term dominance is used for a related, but different, concept; cf., e.g., Kaufmann 1975 (1.4): 7f.

Linear order (i.e. the relation which is indicated by ^) and tree structures can be regarded as special cases of dominance.1 There are also dominance relations which are not trees or linearly ordered sets. Consider, as an example, the Luxemburg situation. Assuming that native speakers p3 of Letzebuergesch have learned both standard French and German, in the dominance relation 'is fully understood by', person p3 is dominated by monolingual speakers p' and P2 of French and German, whereas p' and P2 do not dominate each other: the following graph is obtained. Ps Fig. 1.1.11.1 S 1.1.12 Partitions Certain types of subset of the power set X*(X) of a set X that show properties with empirical appeal will be treated in this and the following sections. The relationships of these properties with the relations which have been introduced in the preceding sec- tions will also be discussed. Perhaps the most popular systems of subsets of X*(X) are partitions (razbienie?) of X. A partition X of a set X is a set of non-intersecting subsets of X which covers all elements of X, i.e. A V A (Xi*Xj=Mx€ XiAxé Xj)) (1.1.12.1) xeX XteX XjgX An example is the partition of the set of persons into age classes: every person has a certain age and no person has more than one age. The example suggests that there is a relationship between partitions and equiva- lence relations. In fact there is a one-to-one correspondence: each partition X of X determines an equivalence relation MX, X), ÄXX)={(xi,x2)|xi€XAx2gXA V (xie XiAx2e Xi)} (1.1.12.2) XteX Correspondingly, each equivalence relation R over X determines a partition X(/?, X), X(ftX)= {XilXiCXA A A A «xi,x2)€ RA(xhX3Ì€ R)} (1.1.12.3) xjeXt x2eXt x3éXì The relation 'as old as' determines, and is determined by, a partition of the set of per- sons into age classes. An increasingly precise interpretation of age will yield age classes which contain one member each. * For linear order and tree structures there are alternative denotations by which identity pairs are excluded. Thus, for linear order we also find &lt; instead of s. The difference with corresponding dominance relations which include all identity pairs is not essential as long as the treatment of identity pairs is consistent: ei- ther they must all be included (to obtain a reflexive relation) or they must all be excluded (to obtain an antireflexive relation). This will be shown for trees in §4.0.3. 2 In Kulagina I960: 228ff . razbienie is rendered as resolution. This usage will not be adopted.</page><page sequence="190">168 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS A class that belongs to a partition is an equivalence class. A non-empty equiva- lence class is unambiguously defined by any of its members. If, for instance, the equivalence class which contains x is called P(x), and if ye Pix) (1.1.12.4) then P(y) = P(x) (1.1.12.5) In linguistics, the term classification is often used to refer to partitions. Subsets are then called classes. Some linguists extend this terminology to systems of tolerance classes.1 In Juilland &amp; Lieb's terminology, the term strong classification (strenge Klassifikation) corresponds to a partition, except that the improper partition is ex- cluded.2 § 1.1.13 Systems of partitions: amalgamations and refinements In her classic paper, Kulagina identifies a special relation between partitions. Con- sider two partitions A and B of X: A={Ai,...,Am} (1.1.13.1) B={Bi,...,Bn} (1.1.13.2) Partition A is broader (krupnee) than B, or an amalgamation (ukrupnenie) of B, if no class in B contains elements of more than one class in A, i.e. if:3 A B(x)cAd) (1.1.13.3) xeX Unlike (1.1.13.3), Kulagina's definition includes the condition AxB (1.1.13.4) If this condition is fulfilled it is proposed here to call A a proper amalgamation of B. An example of an amalgamation relation is the popular representation of the rela- tion between languages and dialects, according to which a dialect cannot belong to two or more languages. In this representation, the partition of speech varieties into languages is broader than their partition into dialects. The converse relation to "broader than' is named finer than by Marcus;4 SkráSek calls the converse of an amalgamation a refinement (raffinement)? Broader than1 and 'finer than1 are dominance relations with certain special proper- ties, which are indicated below. 1 These will be discussed in § 1.1.14 below. 2 Juilland &amp; Lieb 1968 (1.2): 26; see § 1.1.14 for details. 3 Cf. Kulagina 1958: 104. The English renderings larger and enlargement of Kulagina I960: 229 have not been adopted. Some classif icational concepts which are introduced here with the names given to them by Kulagina, V.A. Uspenskij and Revzin, had in fact been introduced before under different names in different fields of applied mathematics. Kulagina's amalgamation, for instance, coincides with SkráSek's [1949 (4.1): 8] recouvrement 4 Marcus 1967a (1.12): 31. 5SkráSek 1949 (4.1): 8.</page><page sequence="191">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 1 69 1 The 'broader than1 and 'finer than1 relations for the complete set of partitions of a set X show a symmetrical pattern.1 Consider the following example, where X-{xlfxax3} (1.1.13.5) The dominance relation 'finer than' among all subsets of X is indicated in Fig. 1.1.13.1.

This partition is the improper partition. Juilland &amp; Lieb exclude this partition from their definition of 'strong classification' by specify- ing that the latter must contain at least two subsets.2 3 Fig. 1.1.13.1 also suggests correctly that, for each set X, X={xi,...,xn} (1.1.13.6) there is a partition X which is finer than any other partition of X: X={{x!},...,{xn}} (1.1.13.7) This partition is called the unit partition (ediniõnoe razbienie?) of X. An example: in a traditional classification of dialectal speech forms, idiolects determine the unit partition. S 1.1.14 Systems of tolerance classes A system of tolerance classes over X is a set X of subsets of X which cover all of X and none of which is a proper subset of another set in X.

Juilland &amp; Lieb refer to systems of tolerance classes as classifications (proper).1 There is one-to-one correspondence between tolerance relations and systems of tolerance classes: a tolerance relation R over a set X determines system X{Rt X) of tolerance classes: X(ftX)={Xi|XiCXA A A A «xi,X2)eÄA(xi,X3)e/Ö} (1.1.14.3) xiEXi x2eXt x3éXt Conversely, a system of tolerance classes determines the tolerance relation 'sharing at least one common subset1. The tolerance relation ÄX, X) which is yielded by a sys- tem X of tolerance classes over set X is defined as follows: ÄXX)= {(xi,x2)|xiG XAx2e XA V (x' e Xt A x2 e Xt)} (1.1.14.4) XteX For an example, compare the hypothetical dialectological 'mutual intelligibility case of §1.1.10. If the tolerance classes which are determined by this relation in a dialect continuum are regarded as modelling distinct languages, a situation where languages overlap without coinciding is not excluded. This reflects the possibility that certain dialectal speech forms can belong to two or more standard languages, as seems to be the case in many political border regions of Europe and Asia. Since one element may belong to more than one subset in a system of tolerance classes, a tolerance class is not necessarily uniquely determined by any one of its el- ements. Thus, for systems of tolerance classes, the notation P(x) for "the tolerance class to which x belongs" is vacuous. A special type of systems of tolerance classes will be distinguished. A system X of tolerance classes Xi . . . Xn is called centered if each subset Xi possesses at least one core element which belongs exclusively to Xt, and which can be employed to identify Xi, i.e. A V A (xeXj^Xj-Xi) (1.1.14.5) XteX xeXt X;e X In the following example, A is a centered system of tolerance classes, and B is not centered.

It is obvious that, if X(x) contains only one element, then x is a core element. S 1.1.15 Transitive closures and nucleus partitions A system X of tolerance classes over a set X determines two partitions of X. 1 The transitive closure C(X) is the partition of X in which classes of X are united if they are connected by a chain of overlapping classes of X. First, the closure class Cx(x) is defined for an element x in X. Cx(x)= {x'|x'€ XA V A (X(xi)nX(xH)^0Axi = xAxn = x')} {x¡ xn)cx Kisn (1.1.15.1) Consequently, the set of closure classes which make up the transitive closure C(X) is defined as follows.1 C(X)={C|CCXA V C = Cx(x)} (1.1.15.2) xeX If all classes of X are connected by overlap chains, the resulting transitive closure contains just one subset and coincides with the improper partition of X. Thus, the transitive closure of A in (1.1.14.7) will coincide with {x}. The transitive closure of a partition is identical to that partition. As an example, consider the transitive closure of the tolerance relation of mu- tual intelligibility which has been adduced in § 1.1.14. Karlgren suggests it as a pos- sible definition of a language, to replace the absolute mutual intelligibility definition which linguists usually implicitly operate with.2 Applied over the dialectal speech forms of Continental Europe, it will unite most Germanic speech forms into one equivalence class, whereas French dialects will be found in a different class.3 2 A system X of tolerance classes over set X determines a set of nuclei,4 i.e. maximal subsets which contain elements which are contained in exactly the same subsets in X. The nucleus partition D(X) is the set of nuclei which are determined by X. Thus, D(X)={D|DCXaA A A (X(xi) = X(x2) A X(xi) * X(x3))} (1.1.15.3) XiG D X2G D x3£ D As an example, consider set X, system of tolerance classes X, and their resulting nucleus partition D(X). 1 Note that Revzin's [1967b (2.8): 41] use of transitive closure {tranzitivnoe zamykanie) deviates from the practice found in these volumes. Revzin's concept is defined as a relation, not as a set of subsets. Moreover, Revzin's transitive closure is not necessarily defined on symmetric relations, so that it corresponds to the set of progressive products as defined in § 1.1.17. In Revzin's terminology, the transitive closures of the present study are a nameless special case of his transitive closures. ¿ Karlgren 1971 (9): 74. Karlgren employs the term transitive extension. 3 Where diglossia or polyglossia must be accounted for, as in Luxemburg, mutual intelligibility1 will clearly not do (see § 1.1.17). 4 The term {jadro) has been taken from Srejder 1971b (3.3): 91.</page><page sequence="194">172 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS X = {xi, 12, X3, X4, X5} (1.1.15.4) X= [{xi,xs}, {xi,x2}, {x2.x3.x4}} (1.1.15.5) D(X)= {{xi}, {x2}. {X3.X4}. {x5}} ' (1.1.15.6) If X(x) is different for each x, i.e. if each element of X is contained in different classes in X, then the nucleus partition of X coincides with the unit partition. Thus, if X={X1,X2,X3,X4} (1.1.15.7) X-{{xifx2},{x2,X3},{xaX4}} (1.1.15.8) then D(X)={{x!}, {x2}, {x3}, {x4}} (1.1.15.9) The nucleus partition of a partition X coincides with X. Consider as an example the nuclei which are yielded by 'mutual intelligibility1. They will coincide with dialects: the sets of idiolects for which the same other idio- lects are mutually intelligible. § 1.1.16 Hypostases Jakuboviõ1 points out that every system of tolerance classes can be represented as a set (hypostasis) of partitions the number of which does not exceed the number of tol- erance classes in the system: for each tolerance class Xi in a system X of tolerance classes over a set X, there is another subset of X, viz. the complement of Xi with re- spect to X, which contains the elements of X which are not contained in Xi. Each tol- erance class makes up a two-class partition with its complement. Here is an example. Let us refer to the tolerance classes which result from the re- lation of mutual intelligibility as isoglosses.2 Then, in a given dialect space, for each class of speech forms that makes up an isogloss, there is a complementary class which contains the speech forms outside the isogloss. The number of such partitions for a given system X of tolerance classes can be re- duced if the complement of a class includes another class in X. If there is, for a given Xi, where XtG X (1.1.16.1) an Xj, where Xj-e X (1.1.16.2) such that XinXj = 0 (1.1.16.3) 1 Jakubovic 1973. 2 This is, of course, a reduction of the customary notion of isogloss, because it reflects only the speech differences which, for at least one instance, happen to impair mutual intelligibility between idiolects. For the sake of the example, let us presume that this conception of isogloss has empirical and methodological validity.</page><page sequence="195">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 1 73 then Xi and Xj may, without loss of information, be accommodated in one partition which is finer than the partitions of Xi and Xj with their complements and includes the possibly non-empty complement of Xi u Xj. The set of partitions which may represent a system of tolerance classes in this manner is not always unique, as is shown by the following example. X={X1,X2,X3,X4,X5} (1.1.16.4) X={X!,X2,X3} (1.1.16.5) Xi«{xi,x2} (1.1.16.6) X2={x2,x3} (1.1.16.7) X3={x4,x5} (1.1.16.8) Let us start out from the hypostasis Xo in which each tolerance class Xi is paired with its complement X¡, X° = { {Xl Xi }, {X2, X~2}, {X3, X~3} } (1.1.16.9) i.e. Xo = {{{xi,x2}, {x3, x4,x5}}, {{xax3}, {x1.x4.x5}}, {{x4,x5}, {x1.x2.x3}}} (1.1.16.10) We then find different ways in which the number of partitions can be reduced. 1 Set X3 is allotted to a partition which also contains X¡ and the complement of XiUX3. This produces Xl={{{x4,x5}, {xltx2}, {x3}}, {{x2,x3}, {xlfX4,x5}}} (1.1.16.11) 2 Set X3 is allotted to a partition which also contains X2 and the complement of X2UX3. This produces X2={{{x4,x5}, {x2,x3}, {x!}}, {{x!,x2}, {x3,X4,x5}}} (1.1.16.12) 3 Set X3 is allotted to either partition. This produces X3= {{{x!,x2}, {x3}, {X4,x5}}, {{x2,x3}, {xi}, {x4,x5}}} (1.1.16.13) Example: the lack of mathematical criteria for choosing between different reductions of the set of partitions which is yielded by a system of tolerance classes corresponds to the frequent inability of the dialectologist to apply linguistically consistent hierar- chies to sets of isoglosses in order to indicate which dialects belong closer together than other dialects. From a sociolinguistic viewpoint, mutual intelligibility in the se- mantic structure of religious, cultural or political terminology may sometimes provide more meaningful isoglosses than large stocks of shared grammatical and lexical items: in parts of southern Jutland, the members of the German minority are the most con- servative speakers of the local dialect, which is linguistically much closer to standard Danish than to standard German.1 1 Van der Plank 1971 (2.2): 68-69.</page><page sequence="196">1 74 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS § 1.1.17 Progressive and regressive products There are no simple "dominance class systems" to match dominance relations. But a dominance relation determines a number of systems of tolerance classes (which, in turn, yield transitive closures, unit partitions, etc.). Three such systems will be intro- duced below: the set of progressive products of initial elements and the set of regres- sive products of final elements, and, in the next section, the set of connectivity classes. 1 Consider a set X and a dominance relation on X. The elements of the dominance relation will be indicated by arrows (-►), as was announced in § 1.1.11. There is a subset X1 of X which contains the elements x of X which are not dominated by any elements not dominated by x. Subset X1 contains the initial elements of X for the dominance relation. Thus, X*={x|xeXA A (x'-x^x-x')} (1.1.17.1) x'eX In the example of Fig. 1.1.17.1 below, arrows which can be deduced from the tran- sitivity (e.g. xi -► xg) and reflexivity (e.g. x' -* X[) of the dominance relation have been omitted.1 Fig. 1.1.17.1 X4 X5 X6 *7 Xg Xg XlO The initial elements in Fig. 1.1.17.1 are xj, x2 and x3. The progressive product X+(x) of an element x contains the elements in X which are dominated by x, i.e. X+(x)={x'|x'e XAx-x'} (1.1.17.2) In Fig. 1.1.17.1, it is obvious that, for instance, X+(X5)={X5,X8,X9} (1.1.17.3) The set Xi+ of progressive products of initial elements is simply defined as follows. Xt+={Xt|XtCXA V (xg XtAXi = X+(x))} (1.1.17.4) xeXt 1 Unless this would entail arbitrary choices. It would, for example, be possible to deduce x' -► X5 from x' -+ X2 and X2 -*■ X5, but it would also be possible to deduce %2 -► X5 from *2 ""* xl and x' -* X5.

X+(xi) = X+(X2&gt; = {xi, X2, X4, X5, X7, Xs, X9} (1.1.17.5) X+fac3)={x3,x6,x9tx10} (1.1.17.6) Since progressive products of initial elements make up a centered system of toler- ance classes, each class contains at least one core element1 belonging exclusively to that class. The set of core elements includes the set of initial elements in the class, but does not necessarily coincide with it, as is illustrated by xe in Fig. 1.1.17.1. The initial elements of a class are said to generate the class.2 For dialectological exemplification, one may suggest Weijnen's and Van der Plank's holosystems as reflecting systems of tolerance classes determined by, say, the relation 'is understood by1. Van der Plank employs holosystem for two slightly different concepts. His first 'holosystem' (the second concept will be described in § 1.1.18) is a set of idiolects the speakers of which consider themselves to speak the same language: HTie inhabitants of Sittard [in Dutch Limburg near the German border] feel at home in the Dutch holosystem; those of Tüddern [a nearby village which now belongs to Germany after changing hands twice this century] feel at home in the German holosystem.^ This conception of Tiolosystem' exemplifies the progressive product of an initial el- ement, the initial elements being the speakers of standard varieties, which are sup- posedly understood by the speakers of dialects. In Van der Plank's first holosystem', idiolects which represent two or more unre- lated speech varieties are ruled out. His criterion for relatedness is of a psycho- logical nature: speech varieties are related if their speakers experience them as related. As an alternative criterion, continuity of register overlap may be pro- posed it must be possible to arrive from "broad" dialect to "standard" through func- tional intermediate stages in which standard language features are gradually sub- stituted for dialect features. A complication occurs in areas which do not contain monolingual speakers of the standard language. Pakistan and Indonesia, whose standard languages are based on speech varieties originating outside the corresponding national territo- ries, tend towards this situation. 2 The set of regressive products is the converse of the set of progressive products. Given a dominance relation on set X the members of which are indicated and sepa- rated by -►, there is a subset Xf of X which contains the elements x of X not domi- nating any elements of X which do not dominate x. Subset X-f contains the final ele- ments of X for the dominance relation. Thus, X/={x|xeXA A (x-x'^x'-x)} (1.1.17.7) 1-6 X 1 Cf. S 1.1.14. 2 Cf.

His second conception of holosystem will be used as an example in §1.1.18.</page><page sequence="198">1 76 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS In the example of Fig. 1.1.17.1 above, the final elements are xjt xg, xg and x'q. The regressive product X"(x) of an element x contains the elements in X which dominate x, i.e. Xix)={x'|x'e XAx'-x} (1.1.17.8) In Fig. 1.1.17.1, it is obvious that, for example, Xix5)={x1,x2,x5} (1.1.17.9) The set of regressive products Xf~ of final elements is defined as follows. X/-={Xt|XtCXA V (xe X/AXt = Xix))} (1.1.17.10) xeXt Fig. 1.1.17.1 shows that there are four regressive products of final elements, viz. X~(x7)={xhx2,x4,x7} (1.1.17.11) X"(x8) = {xi, x2, X4, X5, x8} (1.1.17.12) Xix9) = {xi, x2, x3, X5, x6, x9} (1.1.17.13) X-(x10)={x3,x6,x10} (1.1.17.14) Like progressive products of initial elements, regressive products of final elements make up a centered system of tolerance classes. For a tentative dialectological exemplification of regressive products of final elements, Van der Plank's relatedness criterion is abandoned: consider the linguis- tic situation in Luxemburg, where the speakers of Letzebuergesch employ two standard languages for different social functions. Here French and German go into the regressive product of the vernacular. Besides progressive products of initial elements and regressive products of final ele- ments, progressive and regressive products of other elements with properties that can be derived from a dominance relation present a certain empirical interest. The progressive products of para-initial elements will be defined and exemplified in §2.2.20. Also, various types of products can be defined according to the treatment of intersecting progressive and regressive products: cleared progressive products will be defined and exemplified in §2.3.11. Moreover, for dominance relations which are determined by retrievable properties of the elements of X, reference to these fea- tures may produce various types of empirically interesting non-initial and non-final elements: thus, in §2.2.19, quasi-initial elements and quasi-final elements will be de- fined and exemplified. § 1.1.18 Connectivity classes A dominance relation over a set determines a third system of tolerance classes, which are called connectivity classes {klass svjaznosti) by Revzin.1 Two elements x' and x2 are connectivity-tolerant if xi dominates x2 or if x2 dominates xi. System Xs of con- nectivity classes for set X and dominance relation -* is defined as follows. 1 Revzin 1967b (3.25): 95-96.</page><page sequence="199">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 1 77 XS={Xi|XiCXA A A A ((xi-&gt;x2VX2-&gt;xi)Ax3-*Xi Axi^x^} XjGXi X2GXi X3íXt (1.1.18.1) Systems of connectivity classes are not centered. For the example of Fig. 1.1.17.1, we find the following set Xs of connectivity classes. Xs = { {xi, x2, x4, x7}, {xi, X2, x4, x8}, {xi, x2, x5 x8}, {xi, x2, X5, x9}, {xa X&amp; x9}, {X3,x6,xlo}} (1.1.18.2) Van der Plank's second use of the term holosystem can be adduced as an example of connectivity classes. Here a a set of idiolects unites identical linguistic repertories, both dialectal and standard. Van der Plank: French and South Flemish [what is meant are the westernmost Flemish dialects, spoken in the Dunkirk region of France] do not of course make up a holosystem [due to the relatedness criterion!; the latter dialect and Dutch ceased to make up such a system over a century ago.* This type of holosystem illustrates a connectivity class for the dominance relation 'is understood by'. Other examples of connectivity classes are post-creole continua, which Bynon characterizes as [...] consisting in series of language varieties ranging from at one extreme the broadest creole totally unintelligible to speakers of the target language, to at the other a local variety of the target language differing so slightly from its standard form that it could fairly be described in terms of a "local accent". Such continua are found in Jamaica [...I in Haiti [...] and in Hawaii L.].2 S 1.1.19 Class systems Class systems make up the last type of subsets of the power set of X to be discussed. A class system X over X is simply a set of subsets of X which covers all of X, i.e. XcXIXlA A V xeXi (1.1.19.1) xeX Xte X Systems of tolerance classes are special cases of class systems, viz. in which no class includes another class. As we have seen in § 1.1.14, partitions are in turn special cases of systems of tolerance classes, viz. in which classes do not intersect. Classes without further special properties have empirical appeal if we wish to de- scribe a state of affairs where a class Xi is a subset of another class Xj in the absence of a hierarchical subordination of Xi to Xj, as may be necessary in the case of Frisian: the speakers of Frisian make up a subset of the speakers of Dutch, but Frisian is gen- erally acknowledged to be a separate language. It is possible to establish one-to-one correspondences between certain class sys- tems and dominance relations. There is, for example, one-to-one correspondence between dominance relations and the sets of progressive and regressive products of the elements of X. An example is the relation of order (^) for the numbers 1, 2 and 3, which can be denoted as dominance relation R, where Wan der Plank 1971 (2.2): 68. 2 Bynon 1977 (6.3): 259.</page><page sequence="200">1 78 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS /?= {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)} (1.1.19.2) or as class system X, where X- {{1}, {1,2}, {1,2.3}} (1.1.19.3) i.e. as the set of regressive products of the elements of X for R. The study of these correspondences seems will not be pursued here. S 1.1.20 The modelling power of class systems The dialectological examples suggest that there are states of affairs empirically too complex to be meaningfully represented in terms of the class systems and relations within a set which have been introduced so far. As to equivalence relations and partitions, it is clear that speech variety phenom- ena cannot be exhaustively accounted for in terms of classifications or even hy- postases of progressively broader classifications: in the real world, different dialectal speech forms may overlap in a single speech community, or even a single person. Tolerance relations and systems of tolerance classes take account of overlap but cannot handle states of affairs where certain dialectal speech forms occur only in combination with others while the converse is not necessarily the case: consider the position of Frisian and Dutch in the previous section. A representation in terms of Jakubovië's hypostases of partitions entails the technical inconvenience of dealing with sets of sets of sets. Dominance relations can handle the situation of sets including other sets, but fail to reflect phenomena which always accompany other phenomena. Consider, for example, the (idealized) position of Bahasa Indonesia. In Indonesia, it is (or was, until recently) no-one's native dialect, but functions as the standard language. Here, the relation 'is completely understood by1 does not yield an Indonesian holosystem because there is no idiolect which is completely understood by all speakers in Indonesia, each idiolect containing a portion of speech which is not understood by a part of the population. In terms of § 1.1.17, there is no initial element to generate the set of persons understand- ing Indonesian. Finally, class systems without special properties seem appropriate for dealing with the (idealized) Indonesian situation: the class of speakers of Bahasa Indonesia in- cludes classes of speakers of other languages of Indonesia. But unlike the special class systems mentioned above, ordinary class systems cannot be derived from a re- lation. We have seen how, for instance, systems of tolerance classes can be derived from the relation of mutual intelligibility, but no relation among speech varieties in In- donesia separates the Indonesian speech in an idiolect from the local speech forms in the same idiolect. Instead of a criterion for the distinction of dialects, class systems simply provide us with given sets of speakers of given dialects. Besides this diminished methodological potential, class systems rule out the possibility that two linguistically different speech forms be spoken by exactly the same set of persons: class systems do not register the same set twice. The latter is admittedly not a feasible situation, but on a finer dialectological scale it may be necessary to register the exact concurrence of two isoglosses.</page><page sequence="201">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 179 For these reasons it seems expedient to consider a more powerful way of repre- senting certain states of affairs, viz. in terms of features. In the following sections the mathematical advantages will be discussed. But the use of features is also empirically interesting. In the dialectology examples, various relations employed the concept of intelligibility. This elusive criterion is the implicit result of counting and weighting the common properties of idiolects. But in fact it is possible and perhaps preferable to study these properties themselves, and to express them in terms of feature systems. S 1.1.21 Features Srejder points out that for class systems, including systems of tolerance classes and partitions, there are alternative notations in terms of features.1 A predicate is the label of a variable statement which is either true or false for any object x in a given set X. Consider, for an example, the predicate red1, applied to the set of flowers: for any flower x, the statement (1/1/21/1) xis red. is either true or false. If a predicate a is decided on to be true for an object x, this will be denoted as fol- lows. |a(x)|=l (1.1.21.1) If we decide that a is false for x, this will be denoted as follows. |a(x)| = 0 (1.1.21.2) 1 and 0 are the truth values of a predicate. Two or more predicates in combination make up a new, compound, predicate. If the truth values of the component single predicates are known for a given x, the truth value of the compound predicate can be derived. For instance: (| a{(x) | = 1 A | a2(x) | = 0) =* | a{(x) A a2(x) | = 0 (1.1.21.3) As an example, let a' be red' and a2 be cubical1 and apply (1.1.21.3) to a red ball. The truth value of a predicate for the elements of a given set X is determined ei- ther extensionaily or intensionally. In the former case, the truth value for the appli- cation of the predicate to each element of X is listed. In the latter case, a criterion is introduced by which the truth of the application of the predicate to any object in X can be determined. Now consider three-place relation /?, i?={(xi,crJ,n)} (1.1.21.4) where: - Xi stands for any object in a given set X; - otj stands for any object in set A of predicates; 1 Srejder 1971b (3.3): 91.

Consider subset R[ of R which contains the triplets for which n = 1. If (xi.ffj.rOe Z?1 (1.1.21.5) then element xi is said to possess the feature which is labelled ay Thus, a feature is a confirmed predicate.2 An example: any object x such that statement (1/1/21/1) is true, possesses the fea- ture 'red1. The possession of features by elements of set X can be denoted as a two-place re- lation RFt the first place of which is occupied by the elements of X, the second by features in a set 4&gt;: flFcxx&lt;i&gt; (1.1.21.6) This relation does not necessarily have any special properties.

A set 4&gt; of features which covers set X determines a number of dominance rela- tions over X. One of the more basic ones is determined by the inclusion relation between the sets of features which characterize the elements of X. This relation R may be labelled feature dominance but will return in the models of this study with more specific labels, according to the type of features yielding the relation.1 R = {(xi, x2) | xi € X A x2 g X A &lt;Kxi) c *(x2)} (1.1.24.3) For the example of Fig. 1.1.24.1 and Fig. 1.1.24.2, this dominance relation is: 1 The first example is substitutability dominance, which will be defined in (2.2.16.4).

Feature &lt;p2 is F-indepedent. Features 93 and ^4 are F-equivalent, as they only occur together. They are not properly F-dependent. Set {&lt;¿&gt;i, &lt;p3, &lt;p4}, set {&lt;¿&gt;i, SO3}, set {spi, ^4}, and set {93, ^4} are dimensions. With the exception of {y&gt;3, ^4}, they happen to cover X. Feature y&gt;2 is contained in only one dimension: the one that contains &lt;/&gt;2 as its only member. Feature system RF, which is illustrated in Figures 1.1.24.4 and 1.1.24.5, deter- mines the following system X of F-tolerance classes over X. X= {Xi,X2} (1.1.24.5)</page><page sequence="207">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 185 Xi={xltx2} (1.1.24.6) X2={x2,X3,x4} (1.1.24.7) In Fig. 1.1.24.4, system X is obtained by merging identical columns and removing columns which are subsets of other columns. Procedures of this kind, presented as manipulations of columns and rows, are practised in linguistics by Zaliznjak, among others.1 3 F-tolerance classes are to be distinguished from Srejder's canonical tolerance classes.2 System X of canonical tolerance classes for a feature system RF, ßFcxx(j) (1.1.24.8) is defined as follows. X = {X; | Xi c x A A A &lt;ttx{) n $(x2) /0A A V &lt;J&gt;(x3) n $(x4) =0} xjGXt x2eXt x3£Xt *4eXi (1.1.24.9) Definition (1.1.24.9) implies that each pair of elements must share at least one com- mon feature. This common feature is not necessarily identical for each pair, as is the case in F-tolerance classes. Consider the following example. Fig. 1.1.24.6 &lt;¿&gt;1 &lt;¿&gt;2 &lt;P3 Xi _J 0 1_ x2 _1 1 0_ ~ x3 I 0 1 1 1 ~ Fig. 1.1.24.7 t*^^-- *&gt;3 Here, we find three F-tolerance classes: {xi, x2}, {xj, x3} and {x2, x3}. But there is only one canonical tolerance class, viz. {xj, x2, x3}. 4 Consider the special case where $ is a dimension which covers X. Since the fea- tures of each pair in a dimension either imply each other or exclude each other, it holds for each pair (&lt;pi, &lt;p2) of elements in 4&gt; that X(&lt;p{) = X(so2) V X(y&gt;i) n X(&lt;p2) =0 (1.1.24.10) Here, &lt;i&gt; yields an F-equivalence relation over X. Thus, the special case of &lt;i&gt; being a dimension determines a special system of F-tolerance classes on X, viz. a dimen- sion. This is shown in the following example. 1 For example, in his case model in Zaliznjak 1967b (2.4): 40, which will be discussed in §5.10ff. ¿ Cf.

It is then necessary to choose a set of dimensions such that each feature is represented in at least one dimension. Consequently, each dimension which does not cover X is supplemented with a feature which corresponds to a statement which is the negation of the other features in the dimension.

They can be derived from the class systems and relations introduced above. One of them deserves special mention: the partition X which unites elements possessing the same features into classes, i.e. X={Xi|XiCXA A A A (&lt;D(xi) = &lt;D(x2)A4&gt;(xi)^&lt;D(x3))} (1.1.24.20) *ieXt x2eXt x3ÉXt The classes of this partition are called families isemejstvo). In the present study this term will mostly be applied in a restricted sense: to classes of words which share the same distributional features in various structures.1 S 1.1.25 Synthetic features In the preceding sections it has been demonstrated that feature systems determine various relations and class systems for the set to which the features are applied. It has been shown that there is no one-to-one correspondence between the set of rela- tions and class systems and the set of feature systems. In many disciplines, including linguistics, the reverse approach is implicitly prac- ticed. Feature systems are assumed to be determined by class membership: e.g. the 1 See §2.2.5. The term distribution does not necessarily apply to linear structures.</page><page sequence="210">1 88 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS property of Serbship is derived from the class of Serbs. Such constructing of feature systems on the basis of class systems, i.e. denoting of class systems in terms of fea- tures, is formalized in the present section. Its pitfalls will be discussed afterwards. Consider class system X over set X. Each X' in X determines a predicate ax, which denotes that an object x in X is an element of X': ax'(x) = |xG X'| (1.1.25.1) This implies that A | ax'(x) | = 1 A A | ax'(x) | = 0 (1.1.25.2) xeX' x&lt;2X' In other words, it seems that class membership can be denoted as if it were a feature, regardless of whether a class is derived from a feature. If, however, the classes are indeed derived from features, there is not necessarily one-to-one correspondence between class membership and the original features: one class in a system of feature classes may be yielded by two (equivalent) features, but it yields only one class mem- bership feature. It is proposed to call features which are determined by class mem- bership synthetic features, as opposed to non-synthetic natural features. To the ex- tent that class membership is determined by non-synthetic features, synthetic fea- tures will correspond to sets of features which determine the same classes. Synthetic features possess special properties not necessarily present in natural features. 1 Synthetic features cover the set to which they are applied. This results from the definition of class system1: each member of a set belongs to at least one class of a system, so each member possesses at least one synthetic feature. 2 There are no pairs of non-identical F-equivalent synthetic features. This is illus- trated by the example of Fig. 1.1.24.8 and Fig. 1.1.24.9, where the partition which is determined by features 'p't y&gt;2, and &lt;/&gt;3 itself determines only the two synthetic fea- tures |Xi| and IX2M The two F-equivalent features &lt;¿&gt;2 and ^3 correspond to one sin- gle synthetic feature IX2I. 3 If X is a system of tolerance classes, its corresponding synthetic features are never F-dependent. It is sufficient for the elements of an F-tolerance class to share one (original) feature; it is irrelevant whether some of them have more fea- tures in common than others. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.1.24.4. and Fig. 1.1.24.5, where the system of tolerance classes which is determined by the four features in &lt;i&gt; itself, determines only the synthetic features |Xi| and IX2I:2 synthetic feature |Xj| corresponds to ^2; synthetic feature IX2I corresponds to the F-equivalent features &lt;/&gt;3 and &lt;¿&gt;4. No synthetic feature corresponds to &lt;p'. Dominance relations can be represented in terms of synthetic features through, for example, the progressive products of their initial elements, which make up a system of tolerance classes. 1 Cf. (1.1.24.11), (1.1.24.12) and (1.1.24.13). 2 Cf.

Thus, if X={Xi,...,Xn} (1.1.25.3) then {|Xi|,...,|Xn|} (1.1.25.4) is a dimension which lacks F-equivalent features and covers X. In the tables of § 1.1.24, the indicated procedure of merger and removal of columns amounts to establishing synthetic features. Now consider the pitfalls of synthetic features. Until this section, a set was identi- fied by either listing its elements or presenting a property which characterizes its members. Identification consists of attaching a label to it. In the present section, a property has been defined by set membership, i.e. carrying a label is considered to determine a property. Russell's Paradox illustrates the risks of this procedure.1 Allowing for set membership as a feature enables us to define the set U of all sets: U={X|VxeX} (1.1.25.5) X In words, U contains all entities which contain members. The definition implies that U contains itself. Since sets do not necessarily contain themselves, we can define a proper subset U' of U which contains the sets which do not contain themselves. U'={X|XeUAXiX} (1.1.25.6) Assume that X g X and X ë X cannot be simultaneously true: a set is either an element of itself or not, but cannot be both. It follows for U', as defined in (1.1.25.6), that either IT e U' or U'ë U'. Now first assume that U'e IT. This implies that U' does not belong to the set which is defined in (1.1.25.6), i.e. that U é U'. But this contradicts the initial assumption, as U'e U' and U'£ U' cannot be simultaneously true. Now assume that U'é U'. This implies that U' either fulfils the criterion of (1.1.25.6), implying that ei- ther U'e U', which contradicts the initial assumption that U'£ IT, or U'g U, which contradicts the criterion of (1.1.25.5), as U is defined to contain all sets. Consequently, set U of all sets does not exist, as it cannot contain IT; nor does set IT, containing the sets which do not contain themselves, exist.2 The lesson of Russell's Paradox is that, although sets can belong to sets, each set system must in the final instance be based on well-defined non-sets, on non-labels: the extensional definition of a set presupposes the existence of elements which are not sets; the intensional definition of a set presupposes the existence of properties which are identified in a language which does not consist of set-theoretical predicates. Phe- nomena and properties are prior to labels. Manipulating labels without the intention of referring to referents in the real world results in logical deadlocks. 1 This presentation of Russell's Paradox follows Lightstone 1965 ¡221 49-50. ¿ The popular example of Russell's Paradox is that of the barber of an island, who sets himself the goal of shaving all and only the men who do not shave themselves. Will the barber end up with a beard?</page><page sequence="212">190 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS This illustrates the risk of the use of synthetic features. We forget or do not know where they come from. If they are mistaken for natural features, we may "discover" regularities in our material which have been imposed on it by forgotten set-theoreti- cal operations. If the sets which determine membership predicates do not themselves result from lists of objects or from natural predicates, their use is illegitimate. We must therefore assume that the set systems which yield synthetic features are ulti- mately derived from natural features. But, by using sets instead of their underlying features, the information carried by the underlying feature system, which is in prin- ciple available, is discarded: F-equivalent features, the equivalence of which may represent an interesting fact, cannot be retrieved from the resulting set system. Thus, synthetic features do not add new information or viewpoints to existing representa- tions: on the contrary, they provide an air of legitimacy to the removal of information. But, since synthetic features provide a formal framework for the representation of what some linguists are actually doing, it has been considered expedient to introduce them. S 1.1.26 The role of class systems and feature systems in handling ob- served phenomena Set systems are both a popular inductive device and a popular means of instruction: they provide images which enable an investigator to arrange and consolidate obser- vations and to communicate about them. Processes of representing empirical phenomena, both in the historical development of a discipline, in the cognitive development of an investigator studying a phe- nomenon, and in the didactics of representing results, often reflect a certain pattern, which consists of the gradual dropping of presuppositions. In a first stage, phenomena are represented in a more or less idealized manner, in simple and elegant images, while evidence is implicitly or explicitly selected to suit these representations. Later, as such images fail to represent all observations in a meaningful manner, the presup- positions about reality implicit in the images are reconsidered and abandoned. The processes can be illustrated by the way in which class systems and feature systems have been used in handling speech variation. The older scientific registrations of speech differences, which still prevail in popu- lar accounts of speech variation and, especially, in political dealings on the matter, are classifications (partitions), at first extensional: there is a set of distinct languages, and these make up distinct families and are subdivided into distinct dialects, down to idiolects. Closed coloured dialect maps illustrate this stage. Although there is usually a limit to the amenability of stubborn reality to being moulded into partitions, the regularity of partitions is so tempting that scholars are often reluctant to abandon the concept. Karlgren puts it as follows. Many linguists seem to expect disjoint classes everywhere and are ever so surprised when they find that classes overlap. Or rather, it is believed that formal logic expects this of them. * Nevertheless a serious search for intensional criteria for establishing such classifi- cations and the failure to find them bring about a presentation in terms of tolerance 1 Karlgren 1971 (6): 71.</page><page sequence="213">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 1 9 1 classes, which reflect implicit criteria like mutual intelligibility and are illustrated by the use of maps with "crucial" isogloss lines. Finally, feature systems are resorted to: we find open dialect maps in which points can be marked for two or more competing phenomena. This is where sociolinguistic representations begin. At the last stage, the map ceases to be the basic vehicle for the representation of linguistic variation. What is left are features and instances. This conclusion has in fact been arrived at by Hudson, whose items can be regarded as features: [...] there is no way of delimiting varieties, and we must therefore conclude that varieties do not exist. All that exists are people and items, and people may be more or less similar to one another in the items they have in their language.1 Thus, there is a happy ending to the scientific study of speech variation. But older ways of representing speech variation are not completely abandoned. They are em- ployed as inductive devices for broad orientation, as suitable models for studying lab- oratory situations of speech variation and linguistic change, and, above all, for vari- ous non-linguistic objectives of a cultural and political nature. The applying by cul- tural and political powers of regular set systems while ignoring the properties which yield them (i.e. turning the labels of sets into synthetic features) has brought about the existence of a great many linguistic laboratory situations in the modern world. Whereas a "natural" ethnic or linguistic landscape is characterized by variation, poly- glossia, and gradual transitions, nation states have artificially produced large homo- geneous, basically monolingual areas, with small tolerance margins for linguistic variety and creativity, and a pathological interest in syntactic and orthoepic norms.2 The typical cognitive development of the models of the Set-theoretical School pro- ceeds along lines which are similar to those described for speech variation. At first a concept, say paradigm1,3 is given as a partition. When this way of representing reality meets with resistance from the linguistic material, the model is adapted and turned into a system of tolerance classes. Finally, a representation is preferred which, di- rectly or indirectly, implies the adoption of non-synthetic features, which cannot be reduced to class systems without loss of essential information.4 The situation differs from the example of speech variation in that the models of the Set-theoretical School 1 Hudson 1980 (2.3.1): 40. 2 The use of synthetic features in social engineering is one of the most distressing side-effects of the use of classifications as an inductive device in a cognitive process. Marr's objections to comparative linguistics (cf. §0.6) may be scientifically unjustified, but the utilization of the images and metaphors of comparative linguistics and other humanities for nation building is destructive. This practice entails the imposition of tree structure representations, i.e. hypostases of partitions, on human populations. Instead of class member- ship being derived from relevant properties, classes are posited and assigned to subjects by act of will. Classif icational labels are reified: the label of the set is the starting point, the properties are considered ac- cessory, so that Procrustean methods are resorted to in order to discipline reality and forge the properties to the label. 3 See the discussion on Kulagina's constraint on paradigms in §3.0.12. 4 In this study, proposals of some mathematical linguists to establish empirically relevant class systems by means of quantification in less transparent class systems are left out of consideration. An example of this approach is Fischer 1973 (4.10): 74, where two classes in a class system are united if the number of elements in their intersection reaches a given value fc. Similar proposals for feature systems are found in Srejder 1968 (3&gt;. lOff.</page><page sequence="214">192 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS are deductive systems: when it is claimed for two models that they pertain to the same phenomenon, the models are mutually exclusive. The development which is sketched above for them can be regarded as a cognitive development: a series of consecutive removals of constraints on a relation between elements of a set of linguistic objects. Thus, a first constraint stipulates that an established relation is reflexive, symmetric and transitive; the constraint is replaced by a new constraint, which only stipulates that the relation is reflexive and symmetric. Finally, the relation is replaced by a re- lation with objects outside the original set: at first objects which are determined in terms of the set (classes, synthetic features) and eventually objects which are entirely independent entities, such as features. S 1.1.27 Reality claims The preceding sections of this chapter discussed the technical connectives, which make up the first component of a linguistic model, and some of their combinations. As was announced in § 1.0.9, the fifth component, which consists of the reality claims for the other components of the model, will not be presented separately but jointly with the components to which they apply. In the present section, the general concept of reality claim will be introduced; in the next section, specific reality claims for the technical connectives will be discussed. Around 1950 the scholastic discussion on the existence of abstract concepts was applied to the metalanguage of linguistics. The opposition between realism, which at- tributed a mode of independent existence to abstract concepts, and nominalism, which considered abstraction to be a game of manipulating labels, reappeared as the oppo- sition, introduced by Householder, between God's-truth linguistics and hocus-pocus linguistics.1 As Joos put it, "the God's-truth assumption is that the language has a structure that is just there, waiting for the analyst to work it out".2 The hocus-pocus linguist, on the other hand, was considered to obtain his categories by manipulating his labels as he pleased, without claiming to discover any hidden realities. Before Householder, Borgstr0m had already proposed distinguishing between primary expe- riences, i.e. phenomena which are perceived as existing in reality, and secondary ex- periences, i.e. the processes and results of the linguist's manipulations of the primary experiences. Borgstr0m considered Saussure to have become a victim of the illusion of attributing reality status to the results of his own manipulations when stating that r langue is, not less than parole, an object of a concrete nature".3 Transformations and rewriting rules in generative grammar have been subject to similar discussions.4 The 1 Householder 1952, especially 260-262; Householder 1957: 153-155. 2 Joos 19664: 80. 3 Saussure 1969s (0.3.2): 32; Borgstr0m 1949: 5. 4 For example, in Anderson, L.B., 1971, Hermanns 1971, Quine 19722, Hutchinson 1980, or De Haan 1988 (4.3.2): 87-100. Quine, for example, points out that rules can be claimed to fit or to guide: the fitting claim implies that the rules of a grammar represent a recursive definition of the set of grammatical sen- tences of a language, i.e. represent a hocus-pocus device; the guiding claim includes the fitting claim but implies, moreover, that the rules are explicitly observed in the construction of a sentence, i.e. represent an observable process. Quine places the rules of a contemporary generative grammar in an intermediate posi- tion: they purport to reflect the non-explicit behaviour of a person constructing a sentence [19722: 442-4431 this would imply that they represent a process which is not, or not immediately, observable.</page><page sequence="215">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 1 93 issue could not be avoided in Soviet linguistics, where structuralists were under regu- lar attack on the part of materialist Marxists, who accused the former of idealism or vacuous formalism for their dealing with self-contrived relations instead of objec- tively given substance.1 Albrecht remarks that t'the conceptual precision of the discussion of the [Ameri- can] linguists would not have satisfied the Scholastic logicians, let alone modern logi- cians".2 In defense of the linguists, it may be put forward that the linguistic version of the discussion is more complex than the general one. Language is a semiotic system, the major function of which is to communicate about selected aspects of reality by giving names to them. Consequently, a discussion on the reality status of linguistic concepts deals with systems of naming the parts of a naming system, or with abstrac- tions of abstractions. This yields a high risk of confusing different levels of naming and abstraction. The complexity of dealing with the relation between signs and reality is testified to by Peirce's attempt at a taxonomy of signs which employs the existence of signs or parts of signs in the world outside as a criterion: Peirce believed himself to have ended up with a theoretical 66 different types of sign.3 1 The polemic literature on the subject is enormous. A few references were given in §0.12. 2 Albrecht 1988(6.1): 104 d Peirce 1958: 407; Sanders 1970. Peirce's most fruitful, or at least best-known, distinctions are: 1 the type-token distinctioa which more or less corresponds to Saussure's distinction between langue and parole and will be discussed in §2.0.1 and §4.1.49; 2 his classification of signs into indices, icons and symbols [Peirce 19321 according to the physical properties of the connection between what Saussure calls signifiant and signifié (cf., e.g., Peirce 1958: 391). a For indices, this connection consists of a physical chain of cause and effect, as in the case of a weathercock showing the direction of the wind; b for icons, the connection consists of a physical similarity, as in the case of the linguistic represen- tation cock-a-doodle-doo of the sound made by a cock; c for symbols, any physical connection is said to be absent, as in the case of the arbitrary shape of the linguistic representation hen of a hen. The status of linguistic signs in terms of Peirce's trichotomy fluctuates between linguists. Saussure [19693 (1.3.2): 100-102] emphasizes the arbitrariness of linguistic signs, which makes them symbols. As Saussure points out, the iconic character of linguistic signs should not be over-estimated the fact that the names of the sound which cocks produce vary strongly between languages is indicative of the degree of arbitrariness in even onomatopoeic words, significant. Jakobson [1965/19711 supports the symbol viewpoint but under- scores the importance of the iconic character of many linguistic signs: his numerous examples include the increasing length of the morphemes expressing higher degrees of comparison: small smaller, smallest [1965/1971: 3521. Finally, Bloomfield [1934 (2.6): 31-341 insists on the mechanical status of linguistic signs: their apparent arbitrariness is only due to our lack of knowledge of the relevant physiological rela- tions. This viewpoint, which essentially coincides with that of the neo-Marrist philosophers (cf. KolSanskij 1965 ('&gt;. 15-16), turns linguistic signs into indices. Bloomfield's index status is gaining inter- est as a result of the increasing physicalization of sign systems, both in human constructs (digital compu- ters) and in human discovery (genetic code). On the other hand, the fact that more semiotic systems can be described as chains of physical causes and effects does not necessarily mean that this is the type of reality which must be attributed to them qua semiotic systems. The physical processes which make a petrol- pump-shaped light on the dashboard of an automobile burn when the level of petrol in the tank is below a certain mark is a condition for the light functioning as a sign but is not part of its essence as a sign: drivers who are not aware of the physical processes nevertheless stop and fill up. Even the petrol pump shape of the light may not be essential the shape itself does not uniquely determine the message. In fact, we may ask whether a sign can ever be fully iconic: if the signifiant would share all properties of the signifié, it would coincide with the latter and only signify itself. It seems essential for a sign that the signifié has</page><page sequence="216">194 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS In the present study, the reality discussion is only dealt with as far as it affects the models presented. The present writer believes, however, that the models themselves provide a tool for clarification of some aspects of the discussion. A discussion on the reality status of linguistic concepts may gain transparency if it is split up into sepa- rate discussions for each meta-concept involved in determining the concept. More specifically, it is believed that it is expedient to assume that: 1 different modes of existence may be claimed; 2 different claims to existence may be made with respect to different components of a model. Saussure, for example, may be interpreted in such a way as to assert that his langue is a psychological category, which is "seated in the brain", while his parole represents a body of tangible events.1 If langue and parole represent different components of his model, we have different modes of existence being claimed for the two components. Rather similarly, Saumjan, in his defense of structuralism, harmonizes it with Marxism. He points out that Lenin had been faced with similar problems when con- fronted with the rapid development of physics: at the time, some materialists had also complained that modern scientists were discarding matter, leaving only formulas. Lenin pointed out that it is only our knowledge of matter that deepens, and those properties of matter which had been thought to be pertinent had to be replaced. "After all, the sole "property" of matter with the recognition of which philosophical materialism is bound up is the property of being an objective reality, of existing out- side our mind."2 Consequently, Saumjan argues, two modes of existence are covered by the term matter (materija), the first corresponding to physical substance, the sec- ond to Objective reality external to consciousness, in the sense that it is not a mental construct. Relations are material in the second sense, and it is in this sense that structuralism as well as Marxism are materialist? As was announced in § 1.0.9, the term reality claim is introduced to refer to asser- tions which can be put forth regarding the existence of components of a model, or re- garding the correspondences between the components of the model and aspects of reality (which is a mode of existence). It is possible that assertions regarding the re- ality status of concepts are made for some components but not for others. For the latter instance, the term empty reality claim is used. A model, as well as its separate components, may be compatible with different re- ality claims. Altering the reality claims for a model does not necessarily entail modifi- cation of the structure of the model. It is proposed here, as an additional assumption, that it is possible to isolate reality claims from other components of the model: for certain purposes, models can be subject to mutual comparison while the reality claims more properties than are determined by the physical properties of the signifiant: it is these properties which make each sign a symbol, which may have optional index and icon characteristics. 1 Saussure 1969s (0.3.2): 32. 2 Lenin 1972 (5.2k 267; 1909/19615 (5.2): 275. Cf. Saumjan 1961 (3): 74. The adduced passage from Lenin is a classic defense line against accusations of formalism and idealism: as early as 1927, the celebrated physicist Ioffe (cf. §0.4) used it in defense of relativity theory [Joravsky 1961 (5.18): 288]. 3 Saum jan 1961 (3): 74-75. Saumjan points out that the reality status of 'phoneme is not unlike that of 'value1, which, according to Marx, "does not contain an atom of physical matter".</page><page sequence="217">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 1 95 attributed to their components are disregarded. The following example shows that this is not new in linguistics. A starred representation in historical linguistics stands for a reconstructed form: the Proto-Indo-European form which means 'father' may be denoted as *ph2tér.[ This series of signs, however, does not mean the same to all historical linguists. To some, it is an abstract construct, a convenient notational device which reflects certain corre- spondences between attested forms in a set of languages.2 To others, such forms im- ply the presumption, with whatever plausibility, that the indicated series of (phonetic, phonological) properties characterize sound sequences which have been uttered at certain moments in the past.3 Or, to others again, the starred form may presuppose a linguistic system in which an utterance with the indicated properties would have been understood, even if the form itself may never have been uttered. The disagreement on the reality status of a proto-language could not fail to be re- marked upon by the Marrists, who opposed the concept of protolanguage as such.4 Desnickaja opposes A. Schleicher, who viewed the Indo-European proto-language as entirely real, and Meillet, who declares that, to him, a proto-language is only a system of correspondences.5 But, as Desnickaja remarks, that does not change the essence of the method. Diverging opinions on the precise relation between starred forms and reality do not prevent historical linguists of different denominations from discussing the actual shapes of the individual starred forms, and from agreeing or disagreeing on them. It is not, of course, excluded that methods and opinions on single issues are in fact guided by specific reality claims: the supporters of realism are likely to attach greater importance to phonetic and social plausibility arguments. But the general rules which govern decisions on the shapes of starred forms can apparently be formu- lated without involving the reality claims which are made for the individual forms. Thus, it will be attempted in this study to isolate the reality claims of the compo- nents of a model and discuss them on their own merits as separate components. This does not, of course, detract from the importance of assessing for individual models where and how the reality claims for their components have influenced their struc- tures. Later in this chapter, a distinction between "direct" and "indirect" reality claims will be introduced; indirect reality claims will characterize "modular" and "substitutional" models.6 S 1.1.28 Reality claims for technical connectives As we have seen in this chapter, technical connectives are symbols with specified restrictions on the manner in which they can be combined. In pure mathematics, it is sufficient for them to be no more than that. In applied mathematics some kind of inter- 1 This particular reconstruction is found in Beekes 1990 (1 1.1 1.2): 196. 2 This point of view is explicitly endorsed in Bloomfield 1934 (18.8): 309. 3 In Beekes 1990, for example, no reservations whatsoever are expressed on the historicity of his assumed reconstructions. 4 Cf. §0.6 and §0.9. 5 Desnickaja 1941:58. 6 See §1.52 and §1.5.3.</page><page sequence="218">196 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS pretational link is presupposed between the symbol and the world outside the symbol. The reality claims proposed here for the technical connectives of a model pertain to an aspect of the world outside called substance. It is not pretended that they are the only kind of reality claims that can be put forward. According to Apresjan,1 one of the properties of a model consists in the fact that its substance is variable: a model remains the same, whether its substance is a set of symbols on paper, a constellation of cells in the brain, or a machine made of metal.2 The substance of the models discussed in the present study is fixed as symbols on pa- per, but different claims may be made about their possible existence or realization in other substance. These claims, for a given model, can be subject to constraints: cer- tain kinds of substance can be excluded. Such constraints are determined by the in- terpretation of the symbols of the model. Three standard interpretations are given here. 1 The symbols are interpreted as relators. Statements which employ the symbols give a description of a state of affairs in reality. In this interpretation, a formula of the type a + b = c (1.1.28.1) is no more than an assertion that, say, the sum of a interchangeable objects and b interchangeable objects which are interchangeable with the objects of the first set is c interchangeable objects. This interpretation of the symbols determines rela- tional models. The substance for relational models is static: the minimal substance for the model is its denotation. This interpretation of technical connectives is typical of much of European structural linguistics, which was generally satisfied with conceptual coherence of their approaches to language.3 2 The symbols are interpreted as functors, i.e. as (descriptions of) instructions, which affect reality in a well-determined manner. In this interpretation, formula (1.1.28.1) is read as a complex instruction, e.g.: (1/1/28/1) Find the entity which results from the addition of a and b and call it c. or: (1/1/28/2) Add a and b and call the result c. This interpretation of the symbols determines models which Apresjan calls algo- rithms.4 Kolmogorov &amp; V.A. Uspenskij informally define an algorithm as: ra system of computations which, for a class of mathematical problems, enables one to arrive, with the aid of a uniquely determined sequence of operations which can be executed "mechanically", i.e. unaided by human creative capacities, from a representation A of "conditions" for a problem, at a representation B of "solutions" to the problem.5 1 Apresian 1973b (2.4): 91; 1971 (2.1): 83; 1966 (2.1): 80. 2 Aoresian 1973b (2.4): 90; 1971 (2.1): 82; 1966 (2.1): 80. See also Il'in 1973 i2&gt;. 85-86. 3 But Bloomfield's [1926/19661 set of postulates for linguistics can also be considered a relational model. 4 Apresjan 1973b (2.5): 118; 1971 Ì221 108; 1966 i22ï 108. 0 Kolmogorov &amp; Uspenskij, V.A., 1958 (0): 3. The paper subsequently adds a few properties and conditions.</page><page sequence="219">CHAPTER 1.1: TECHNICAL CONNECTIVES 197 The substance which is claimed for algorithmic models is not static but dynamic. The reality claim is not concerned with description itself, but with the process of its execution, which results from the description and its executor (a machine, or a linguist). Gladkij &amp; Mel'ouk employ the term constructive to refer to definitions with technical connectives that are to be interpreted as functors. Constructive defini- tions are supposed to model procedures of linguistic research.1 The dynamic sub- stance reality claim is in fact characteristic of the heuristic procedures which were the concern of American descriptive linguistics in the thirties and forties, but is also present in the phonological component of a generative grammar. 3 The symbols are interpreted as permissions, which define choices. In this interpre- tation, formula (1.1.28.1), or rather its synonym c = a + b (1.1.28.2) where the order of the terms is conventionally inverted, is read as, say, (1/1/28/3) It is possible to substitute a + b f or c. When the symbols of a model are to be interpreted as above, the model is referred to as a calculus.2 A reality claim which is based on this interpretation presupposes not an execu- tor of processes, but an individual (machine, human being) who can decide and make choices. The substance claimed for the model is not a process but the capac- ity_ to process. This reality claim is made for a generative grammar, which aims to generate the possible sentences of a language, but is also implicit in certain heuristic proce- dures, viz. those in which the investigator is offered the option of choosing between two or more actions.3 Note that what is referred to here is the general claim put forward for the mathematical apparatus of generative grammar, viz. that the sym- bols can be substantiated as automata which can choose processes from a set and execute them. The claim often made that a generative grammar mirrors the capac- ity of the human mind to generate sentences is much more specific and is not part of the reality claims of the technical connectives. Among the three claims mentioned, the most general and abstract reality claim for a model is the first one, viz.: (1/1/28/4) The model is relational. This reality claim is valid for all descriptions of models ("paper models"), even if other reality claims are endorsed as well. Algorithms and calculi are subsets of the set of relational models. In terms of substance, relational models have the "softest" reality claims. They pre- suppose no more than a means of denotation, whereas algorithms and calculi claim 1 Gladkij &amp; Mel'éuk 1983 (m 120; 1972a (6.2): 144; 1973 (6.2): 128. 2 Aprestan 1973b (2.5): 118; 1971 1221 108; 1966 [22): 108. 3 Cf. Chao 1934/ 19664. The existence of options may be due to the liberal convictions of the author of the model, or to his uncertainty about the most desirable criteria.</page><page sequence="220">198 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS that they are not only valid as series of signs obeying mathematicians' conventions, but also as processes (algorithms) and as capacities to generate processes (calculi). The "harder" the substance reality claims made for a model, the more limitations are imposed on the range of its mathematical possibilities. For example, the input to an algorithm must be theoretically finite: operations on infinite sets may be impossible to execute. The authors of the majority of the models discussed in this study do not explicitly state whether the technical connectives are to be interpreted as relators or as func- tors. The few explicit remarks on this issue suggest that they are algorithms.1 But in- puts are not explicitly stated to be finite for many of them, or whenever they are, this is not justified by the interpretations of the models (the linguistic material). For that reason it seems expedient to treat all models, at least in a first-order approach, as if they were relational models, and to compare them on that basis (while indicating how an algorithmic point of view may have affected the structure of the model). This point will be returned to in § 1.2.16. 1 Zaliznjak [1967b (2.8): 38] employs the term procedure. Revzin's recursive [1961b: 142] or inductive def- initions are also explicitly presented as instructions.</page><page sequence="221">CHAPTER 1.2: BASE COMPONENT (INITIAL OBJECTS) S 1.2.1 Extenslonal and intensional base components The base component contains everything which is explicitly stated to be taken for granted in the model, apart from the technical connectives. The technical connectives make a universal claim, and are presumed to be valid in any model. The primitive ob- jects, on the other hand, may vary between models and must therefore be stated ex- plicitly for each model. Mathematically, the base component contains primitive elements and primitive re- lations, and possibly axioms. Axioms are statements which specify mathematical prop- erties of the relations which are not trivial and cannot be derived from other proper- ties. In a relational model,1 the base component contains the concepts which are unde- fined within the scope of the model. In an algorithmic model, the base component contains the input for the (derivations of the) model. In a calculus model, the base component contains an alphabet of symbols, and a set of specified permissions. Thus, the base component contains the initial objects of a model, which remain un- defined but are referred to and relied on when other concepts of the model are de- termined. For an example, assume the following definition of a (Russian) word in a relational model. (1/2/1/1) A word is a string of letters which is preceded and followed by a space or a punctuation sign. Here the notion 'word' (or rather 'Russian word1) is defined on the basis of certain other notions such as 'string1, 'space' and punctuation sign', which are themselves left unde- fined because they are assumed to be clear to everyone.2 These notions constitute the base component of the little model represented by (1/2/1/1). Any other definitions which are in turn based on the concept of word, say the definitions of noun1 or Verb1, are indirectly based on the same undefined notions. 1 For relational, algorithmic and calculus models, cf. § 1.1.28. 2 It is probably unnecessary to stress that (1/2/1/1), as a definition of 'word1, is linguistically irrelevant and serves only to devise a simple example. In fact, this and similar definitions were employed for certain specified practical purposes in early Soviet mathematical linguistics (in models which will be termed substitutional in § 1.5.3), The present definition, which was operated with in, e.g., Mel'öuk 1961 (1): 207 and Zaliznjak 1969: (2.2): 43; 1967b (1.2): 19, was exploited in Budagov 1972 (3k 407 to stigmatize for- mal linguistics in his 1972-1974 war against modernism (cf. §0.12). Budagov contrasts (1/2/1/1) with the definition of word" as rthe most important linguistic unit, which indicates phenomena of reality and men- tal life of man and is usually uniformly understood by a body of people who are linked by history and speak the same language". Needless to say, Budagov prefers the latter definition, which happens to be his own: cf. Budagov 19652 {I}. 12. In one of the reactions to Budagov's attack, LV. Bondarko [1973: 259-2601 points to Budagov's implicit use of the challenged definition in the same paper when comparing the num- ber of words in Russian ïeléznaja doróga and its English, German and French translations railway, Eisen- bahn and chemin de fer [Budagov 1972 (3): 407] and wonders how Budagov's definition can assign word status to the French word de without assigning the same status to the Russian ending-ajia. 199</page><page sequence="222">200 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS For an algorithmic model, if we wish to know which are the Russian words, we should be provided with information. When a definition like (1/2/1/1) is interpreted as an algorithmic model, it indicates what we must know; for example: 1 that texts are made up of letters, spaces and punctuation signs; 2 which letters are contained in the Russian alphabet; 3 which texts are Russian and which texts are not; etc. This information will enable us to identify Russian words and, possibly, subclasses of words, such as nouns and verbs. The information constitutes the input to the algo- rithmic model. If we are interested in identifying the words, not of one language, but of several, we must be supplied with the alphabets and texts of each language. This entails a certain uniformity in the information to be provided. No input can be obtained for models of this type from unwritten languages, because there are no alphabet and texts. Languages with writing systems which do not employ spacing for separating words will provide meaningless input: the model will yield words which coincide with sentences. The required uniformity of the base component is most explicitly visible if it is stated in the form of a relational system (or models) in the sense of Srejder.1 A rela- tional system is understood as a pair of the type M, M=(M, {/?i,..., Rn}i (1.2.1.1) where R', . . . , Rn are relations in set M. In order to keep the example simple, punctuation signs will be left out of consid- eration, so that (1/2/1/1) can be simplified into the following statement. (1/2/1/2) A word is a string of letters which is preceded and followed by a space. The base component L' of (1/2/1/2) can be denoted as the following relational system. Li = (AU {9}, {Ha}) (1.2.1.2) where A denotes the Russian alphabet, 6 denotes a space, and Ha denotes a multiple relation of linear succession on the elements of A u {0}: a harp in the sense of Hockett.2 Relation Ha is to be interpreted as the set of Russian texts. For each separate relational system, the symbols denote constants. All other rela- tional systems which will serve as initial objects for the model of the example, must have the same number of elements and relations. Consider a relational system h¿, ¿2 = (Bu {9}, {//„}) (1.2.1.3! Here B denotes the Roman alphabet while //&amp; denotes a harp on the Roman alphabet, say the set of English texts. The model will determine English words if, everywhere in the model, B is substituted for A, and b for a. 1 Srejder 1973c: 242; Srejder 1973b: 64; Srejder 1971a (2.1): 40-41. 2 Hockett 1966/1967 (2.0): 57.

This induces the follow- ing general formulation. L = (Mu{9}, {//}) (1.2.1.4) Here M stands for an element of a set which contains, say, the Cyrillic, Roman and Greek alphabets, and H stands for an element of a set which contains, for example, the Russian, French, English and Greek harps. Set M is, in this instance, a function of H (but not if Serbo-Croatian is included, a language which can employ either of two alphabets). Now, the base component of a model is best described as containing a (possibly one-member) set of relational systems with given structures. This set can be deter- mined intensionally or extensionally. The above examples illustrate the extensional manner: the relational systems for which the model is valid are enumerated (or are as- sumed to be enumerated, or to be enumerable). The model explicitly applies to a given language, or to a given set of languages, or to all known languages. If an intensional approach is chosen for the base component of a model, the objects for which the model is valid are not enumerated. Instead, a criterion is provided which selects the objects and relations to which the model applies. Here, the initial objects and relations of the models are necessarily variables. They can be denoted as a theory in the sense of Srejder.1 Srejder's theory is un- derstood as a set of labels pi, . . . , pn of relations, and a set of formulae 4&gt;i&gt; • • • &gt; &lt;t&gt;m which are expressed with these labels in logical symbols. (A description of the class of per- missible formulae is implied) A relational system L, where L = (M, {/?i,..., Rn}) (1.2.1.5) is said to be a modelM of theory 6,2 where e = ({Pl,...,Pn}, {(h,..., V}) (1.2.1.6) if for each label pi of a relation, there is a corresponding relation Rt such that, if some variables x, y, z are interpreted as elements of M, all axioms 4&gt;i, . . . , tym are true. Thus, a theory in Srejder's sense selects, from a universe of possible relational systems, a class of possible relational systems each of which is a feasible input for a given model. The selection proceeds by the enumeration of the relations which should be present in a relational system, and by the imposition of certain constraints, in the form of axioms, on the nature of the relations. A model with an intensional base component, i.e. a model the base component of which is a theory, will account for hitherto unknown, or non-existent relational sys- tems. The example of (1.2.1.4) would represent a weak theory 0(M, 6) of language, 9(M, 8) = ({t|}, 0) (1.2.1.7) 1 Srejder 1973c: 243; Srejder 1973b: 65; Srejder 1971a (2.1): 41-42. ¿ It will be clear that Srejder's models is only distantly related to the concept of model as operated in the present study. In what follows, the term will be avoided Srejder's alternative term relational system will continue to be used.</page><page sequence="224">202 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS where r| is a label which indicates the concatenation relation between 9 and the ele- ments of M, and the set of axioms is empty. Thus, if (1/2/1/2) is interpreted as a model with an intensional base component, it would identify words for any. harps and alpha- bets, whether belonging to a known language or not.1 An example of a constraint which might have a place in this intensional base component is an axiom which limits the number of consecutive spaces in a string to one. The authors of the models in the present volumes do not usually indicate whether the initial objects are given intensionally or extensionally. Also, it is not always nota- tionally clear whether the indicated sets and relations are constants or variables (i.e. labels of sets and relations). In this study, all base components are taken to be inten- sional unless there is a specific reason to assume that they are not. But the following convention will be adopted for the denotation of base components. Base components are relational systems, each consisting of one or more sets and one or more relations, and a number of constraints. The relations are supposed to im- ply the labels of a theory. The theory is implied by the constraints. As an example consider a relational system (W.V./Ö (1.2.1.8) where R is a relation between sets W and V (i.e. R c W * V), and a constraint WnV = 0 (1.2.1.9) Relational system (1.2.1.8) and constraint (1.2.1.9) imply a theory which specifies that the first element of a pair in R can never fill the second place and vice versa. S 1.2.2 Reality claims for the base component In the following sections, a classification is given of possible reality claims for the ini- tial objects of the base component of a model. In this classification, the status of a base component in terms of reality claims is determined according to three criteria: 1 the reality claims of the technical connectives of the model, which decide whether a model is a relational model, an algorithmic model or a calculus model;2 2 the intensional or extensional status of the base component; 3 the attributioa to the base component, of any claims to existence in the world out- side the model. As for the third criterion, if no claims to existence are made, the empty reality claim is said to be attributed to the base component. If specific reality claims are made for the base component, further classification is possible. Such will not be given in the following sections; the discussion will be limited to a few examples. 1 As a matter of fact, a definition of word' which is derived from a genuinely intensional base component containing the concepts of written text and space is utterly irrelevant from a linguistic point of view: it dis- qualifies unwritten languages as languages and distinguishes words in an ape's typewriting. Of course, most linguists who nevertheless employ these concepts know this; see § 1.5.3 on substitutional models for a legitimization of their practice. * Cf. S1.1.28.</page><page sequence="225">CHAPTER 1 1 BASE COMPONENT (INITIAL OBJECTS) 203 The above distinctions are mutually independent. They generate twelve combina- tions, which are not of equal linguistic interest. The combinations are presented one by one in the following sections. S 1.2.3 Relational model; extenslonal base component; empty reality claim Base components of this type are specifications of the mathematical properties of one or more given sets of objects (relational systems) which serve as a basis for a mathe- matical construct. S 1.2.4 Relational model; extensional base component; specific reality claims Base components of this type specify properties which have been selected by the in- vestigator as essential for one or more specific languages. § 1.2.5 Relational model; intensional base component; empty reality claim A base component with this status selects a set of relational systems from a universe of relational systems. The systems in the selected set must possess a specified mathe- matical structure which does not characterize any other relational systems in the uni- verse. Since the reality claim which is attributed to the base component is empty, and the model, being relational, is not subject to non-mathematical constraints imposed by the properties of real objects, the choice of the mathematical properties which select the relational systems covered by the model is only a matter of convenience. This status of the base component is endorsed in one of Revzin's earlier definitions of the concept of model. "Out of all the great variety of concepts accumulated by the science, certain ones which can conveniently be regarded as primary are selected."1 The same status is sometimes assigned to it in glossematics; cf. Uldall 1957: Now there are many ways of building up a system, and many possible propositions for each term; it is, for example, a matter of comparatively free choice which elementary terms are to be left as primitive and which defined, since the whole system serves to define the formally undefined terms.2 Note that, if the empty reality claim is attributed to a base component, this does not mean that no reality claim is maintained for the linguistic terms which occur in that component: the empty reality claim is made only for their status as primitives of a model.3 S 1.2.6 Relational model; intensional base component; specific reality claims Specific reality claims which are attributed to an intensional base component often amount to the specification of objects and relations considered to distinguish lan- 1 Revzin 1966b (1.2): 4. 2 Uldall 1957: 19. 3 For the reality claims of linguistic labels, see § 1.4.2.</page><page sequence="226">204 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS guage from other objects. Such base components may be called a definition or theory of language. If, for example, human vocal noises are considered an essential property of lan- guage,1 a theory of language must disqualify bee "languages" and written "languages" from being languages. A base component of this type must not only allow for known or existing languages, but also for objects which are potential languages, whether they have been substan- tialized as such or not. Thus, there is not, and never has been, a language *L which coincides with English except for the meanings of chair and table having been inter- changed with respect to English. Yet, a theory of language should account for *L, which could have been as good a language as any existing language.2 On the other hand, a theory of language must exclude any objects which cannot possibly be lan- guages. If this reality claim is endorsed, the choice of the base component is not a matter of internal convenience. The choice should be determined by the opinion of the inves- tigator on what constitutes a language: the resulting set of relational structures does not necessarily have a convenient mathematical structure. The question of the origin of the investigator's opinion on what constitutes the es- sential properties of language remains. Two possible sources can be distinguished: intuition and function. 1 Intuition provides ideas about properties which are felt to represent crucial slots in the structure of language; possible examples of such slots are words, phonemes, syllables, sentences, relations among sentences. 2 Function is conceived of as reflection on which properties are essential to make a language function as a language; possible examples are the capacity to compose signs by combining other signs, and the essentially arbitrary relation between form and meaning. Intuition is a source for base components in certain immediate constituent grammars where a sentence is explained in terms of the grammatical categories by which it is generated.3 In certain varieties of glossematics, on the other hand, there is a ten- dency towards a functional point of departure, at least if one credits Vogt's and Siert- sema's renderings of Hjelmslev's intention to exclude specifically linguistic terms from the undefined terms that are introduced as a foundation for linguistic theory.4 The non-linguistic concepts may be defined, but their definition is beyond the domain of linguistics: linguistics starts only after the defining of its cognitive object, in terms of common sense, or in terms of other disciplines. This is only possible in a functional ap- proach: whereas an intuition-based approach takes linguistic notions as its points of departure, a functional approach derives the properties of language from its position 1 Cf. Bloomfield 1934 (2.4): 27; Fillmore 1968 {0&gt;. 1. 2 This principle is formulated in Hielmslev 1943 [6&gt;. 17, 1953 (6): 10; cf. Siertsema 19652 (3.4): 59. 3 See what is said on calculus models in § 1.2.16. 4 Vogt 1944: 96-97; Siertsema 19652 (4.1): 67-68. Vogt and Siertsema do not enable retrieval of Hjelm- slev's original statement, unless they are referring to Hjelmslev's [1943 (5): 15, 1953 [Sh 8] statement that "linguistic theory traces its premisses back a great distance, with the result that its premised axioms are so general as to make it seem impossible for any of them to be specific to linguistic theory as opposed to other theories."</page><page sequence="227">CHAPTER 1.2: BASE COMPONENT (INITIAL OBJECTS ) 205 as determined by a broader view of human activity. This point will be elaborated on in §1.3.8. § 1.2.7 Algorithmic model; extensional base component; empty reality claim Base components of this type contain one or more specified relational systems which constitute the input the model is expected to process. S 1.2.8 Algorithmic model; extensional base component; specific re- ality claims Base components of this type contain input which is considered to consist of linguisti- cally relevant data about one or more languages. They may contain, for example, the words and sentences of Russian or of the Slavonic languages. Extensional base components for algorithmic models are used in the construction of recognition (raspoznajuSõij) models, which were produced in the earlier phase of the Set-theoretical School, when much work was done with immediate applications in the field of machine translation in mind. Examples of recognition models are Nikolaeva 1962 and Paduõeva 1960. The purpose of such models is not to define or discover lin- guistic categories but to automatize the process of deciding to which of a number of pre-established categories the words of a given text belong. In Paduöeva's 1960 model, the strictly operational aspect of the approach is testi- fied to by the removal, in the description of the case system, of the distinction be- tween the dative and the locative: this is motivated by the low statistical significance of the number of contexts in which these cases compete.1 § 1.2.9 Algorithmic model; intensional base component; empty reality claim Base components of this type consist of a specification of the quantitative or qualita- tive limitations on the input which the model is capable of processing. It may occur that, for example, practical circumstances allow a model to process only a limited vo- cabulary, or sentences which do not exceed a certain number of words. Since the reality claim is empty, such limitations do not imply any assertion about language it- self. § 1.2.10 Algorithmic model; intensional base component; specific real- ity claims Base components of this type contain a specification of the formats of the data which are presumed to be available for any language. One may postulate, for example, that it is possible to obtain, from documents, informants or otherwise, data of a certain type (words, or identities of specific linguistic objects) for any possible language. Thus, the term language may be employed with reference to a base component which contains (§ 1.2.4) or specifies (§ 1.2.6) essential properties of languages or lan- 1 Paduõeva 1960: 109; Paduöeva 1961: 160.</page><page sequence="228">206 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS guage, respectively; or to a base component which contains (§ 1.2.8) or specifies avail- able data on languages or language. It is conceivable that both claims could be made simultaneously: then, the available data of language are assumed to represent the es- sential properties which distinguish language from non-language. The approaches of some neo-Bloomfieldians do not seem to deviate much from this viewpoint.1 S 1.2.11 Calculus model; extenslonal base component; empty reality claim Base components of this type contain a set of symbols and a set of permissions. Jointly, they constitute a relational system. This is a generative grammar as a purely mathematical construct.2 S 1.2.12 Calculus model; extensional base component; specific reality claims As an instance of this option, consider a base component containing a grammar which is a replica of the capacity of one or more persons to produce sentences of a given language: the competence of a person. S 1.2.13 Calculus model; intensional base component; empty reality claim Base components of this type contain: 1 a specification of a class of symbols which are not technical connectives and not specific to individual grammars (i.e. can be universally used in any grammar which is covered by the model); 2 a specification in logical symbols of the permissions which may be expressed by the symbols under 1. Thus, the base component specifies a set of permissible permissions. This is a theory in Srejder's sense.3 It is also a theory according to Srejder.4 S 1.2.14 Calculus model; intensional base component; specific reality claims In base components of this type, constraints are imposed on the theory in order to limit the variety of possible competences. Some linguists consider the construction of such a model, in which the constraints correspond to the limitations of the human mind, as the ultimate goal of linguistics: a universal grammar which models the capac- ity of the human mind to acquire a competence. 1 Harris' viewpoints, as expressed in, say, 1951 (1-2): 1-24, may be interpreted as equating data with properties. 2 A (context-free) generative grammar is characterized as such in Srejder 1973c (appendix 1): 264; Srejder 1973b (Drilozenie): 82; Sreider 1971a (2.6): 59-60. 3 Cf. §1.2.1. 4 In Srejder 1973c (appendix l&gt;. 263-264; Srejder 1973b (prilozenie): 81-82; Srejder 1971a (2.6): 58-60.</page><page sequence="229">CHAPTER 1 .2 BASE COMPONENT (INITIAL OBJECTS) 207 S 1.2.15 Conceptual versus material reality claims for base components Among the reality claims of the base components which were presented in the forego- ing sections, a systematic difference is apparent between reality claims which are attributed to the base components of relational models and reality claims which are attributed to the base components of algorithmic models. The base components of the relational models are entirely conceptual. The reality status of the object is only presumed (for extensional base components) or postulated (for intensional base components). The objects in the base component are prompted by metalinguistic mental activities, not by impulses from the reality which surrounds us: they exist only as constructs in our minds. This is not illegitimate. Nothing prevents us from meaningfully discussing non-ob- served objects. Such discussions acquire a rational status when the participants im- plicitly or explicitly agree on certain conditions for the discussion: it is legitimate to discuss the speed of a train which has not been constructed but the properties of which are specified. The base components of algorithmic models, on the other hand, presuppose im- pulses of some type which come from outside. Quite commonly, some kind of data is supposed to be extracted from a material reality in a mechanical way, without having been affected or rearranged by any application of naive human preconceptions or prejudices. The viability of the the latter practice has been the subject of a great deal of dis- cussion among linguists. The raw data option is endorsed, at least as an ideal and ulti- mate goal, by behaviourists, such as Bloomfield or Harris: eventually, physical entities and sounds must be the inputs to linguistic discovery procedures. Others believe that the input data, even if they have been materialized in some way, are not primary, real objects but the products of some intuition-based preliminary analysis. Even where this analysis is, again, mechanized, as in speech recognition devices, the machine has been told what to recognize: the machine does not discover the units. An example of intui- tion-based preliminary analysis is Borgstrom's "alike-or-different" test, which employs criteria which cannot be derived from the analyzed matter itself.1 Oranges are said to be alike as compared with apples, but two oranges can be different if compared with each other, depending on the vantage point which is adopted by the observer. In the definitions of the type proposed by Borgstrom, the criteria for comparison determine, to a certain extent, the input. These criteria are of a conceptual nature. This renders the distinction between relational and algorithmic base components less fundamental than at first sight. Some set-theoretical linguists attempt to avoid an immediate appeal to naive lin- guistic judgements. They presuppose data to be available in a mechanical manner, and state that the input of their models can be interpreted as written text. The feasibility of this option varies between linguistic levels. For the phonological level, the interpretation of the input as text presupposes, in the most favourable case, a naive preparatory analysis of the material carried out by the writing system. But the most favourable case will rarely occur: models which are 1 Borgstr0m 1947 iZk 202-203.</page><page sequence="230">208 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS based on writing systems will be seriously handicapped, as most writing systems are not directly based on naive linguistic analysis but on a mixture of non-naive linguistic analysis and non-linguistic preconceptions, nurtured by tradition and political inter- ests. The same applies to a lesser degree to the morphological level. The thesis that written texts can serve as raw input for morphosyntactic and syn- tactic models, i.e. the type of model discussed in the present study, seems quite ten- able at first sight. But, even for this purpose, text does not constitute raw data: naive preliminary analysis and non-linguistic preconceptions enter the input of syntactic models through spaces and punctuation marks. In fact, the syntax of written language deviates to a considerable extent from that of the spoken language as a result of ex- plicit and implicit rules and strategies which must compensate for the lack of situa- tional clues which are usually exploited in oral speech, and for the loss of the infor- mation which, in spoken language, is conveyed by intonation patterns, and which is only partly captured by punctuation.1 Consequently, the reality claims of conceivable algorithmic, as well as relational, base components are likely to be of a conceptual nature. The nature of the concepts which determine the reality claims of the base component may, however, vary be- tween relational and algorithmic models. The work of the Set-theoretical School sug- gests that the input to algorithmic models rests on intuition-based preliminary analy- sis: linguists simply assume that everybody knows which are the words or morphemes of a language. The base component of relational base components is, on the other hand, usually arrived at by deduction from considerations concerning the function of language: even if the specific set of words of a language cannot be established or agreed upon, its existence may be postulated, e.g. on the basis of the assumption that a language cannot function without units which are smaller than sentences but are not necessarily the smallest possible units, and are determined by an unspecified set of constraints on their syntactic behaviour. In spite of the fundamentally conceptual, i.e. non-mechanical, nature of the reality claims of the models discussed in the present study, many of them have been applied to written language. Yet their authors will not be reproached for this. The models usually possess other features which are more relevant to linguistic discussion. There is yet another interesting methodological point about accepting written "lan- guage" as input for a model claimed to be a model of language: it provides a more complex type of reality claims. Thus far, reality claims concerned objects claimed to be language. In the present case, the reality claims concern non-linguistic objects in reality (such as texts), which are in turn claimed to be like language in some aspects (usually syntactic) examined in the model. Thus, a reality claim of the present type is split into a direct reality claim and an indirect reality claim: the direct reality claim is material and concerns the correspondence between the model and reality; the indi- rect reality claim is conceptual and concerns the correspondence (analogy, isomor- phism) between two objects in reality. Indirect reality claims will be discussed in § 1.5.2 and § 1.5.3. Models with indirect reality claims of the present type will be re- ferred to as substitutional models. 1 This point will be returned to in §4.1.42.</page><page sequence="231">CHAPTER 1 .2 BASE COMPONENT (INITIAL OBJECTS) 209 S 1.2.16 Finite and infinite base components Comparison of base components confronts us with the well-known problem of finite- ness. In relational models, theoretically and practically infinite base components are not generally considered a problem, as relational models do not require substantial- ization. It is perfectly possible to discuss the set of unmarried women without having checked all women on this property. Such a discussion can be meaningful as long the participants agree on preliminary conditions as referred to in the foregoing section. But if a model is to be an algorithmic one, it is required that the input be finite: in- finite sets cannot be processed, because the first step of the processing procedure will never be completed if new input continues to enter the model. This problem has worried some linguists of the Set-theoretical School who intended their models to be algorithmic although the inputs were theoretically infinite (for example: the set of sentences of a language). Revzin has proposed feeding the model a finite input: a set of permissible (real'nyj) phrases and a set of suppressed (zapreSõennyj) phrases.1 He proposes to account for the inifinite number of the po- tential input by providing a procedure which generates the other elements of the in- finite sets and extrapolates the analysis (explanation) which is provided by the model for the finite sets. In other models, solutions were proposed which from the outset in- volve syntactic structure. Fitialov suggested to posit syntax as a finite binary relation of potential subordination1 within the set of words.2 Gladkij employed this relation for the modelling of morphosyntactic categories.3 In general, however, the mathematical consequences of the distinction between relational and algorithmic models do not worry the exponents of the Set-theoretical School. Zaliznjak speaks of a Gedankenexperiment (myslennyj èksperìment),4 the input of which is only theoretically finite and is not fully processed: the procedure is started as soon as the material is, according to the intuition of the investigator, sufficiently voluminous and varied. Mathematically, the latter approach is justified if we view an algorithmic model, not as a finite procedure, but as a repeating device which does not wait for the complete input in order to start processing: it processes a provisional finite input; when it fin- ishes processing, it adds another finite set of items to the original one and starts again; this procedure is repeated indefinitely. Any results which are obtained in this manner are only provisional and can, in theory, be superseded by new data. But this is only realistic in view of the existence of linguistic change. In this manner, the infinity of the input is matched by the theoretical infinity of the procedure, while the infinity of the procedure itself can be accounted for by a simple recursive da capo rule.5 The intuition of the investigator provides shortcuts. 1 Revzin 1967b (3.19): 77ff. In an earlier approach [1962b (3&gt;. 16], Revzin, following Harris 1951 (Appendix to 15.3): 255-256, simply proposed to impose an arbitrary limit on the length of phrases to be taken into consideration, thus imposing a limit on the number of phrases as well. 2 Fitialov 1962 (6): 109-111; see §4.2.11. 3 Gladkifs models will be extensively discussed in Chapter 4.5 and Chapter 4.6. 4 Zaliznjak 1967b (2.4): 40; footnote 10. 5 A similar solution for the infinity problem in connection with algorithms is proposed in Kolmogorov &amp; Uspenskij, V.A., 1958 (1): 6.</page><page sequence="232">2 1 0 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS As for the mathematical properties of the base component of a calculus model, the f initeness of the base component is essential.

Derivations are definitions, operations or structures, depending on the reality claims made for the technical connectives. They single out sets, parts or states of (possible) objects in the base component, to which labels can be assigned. In relational models, derivations are read as definitions. Consider the following example. (1/3/1/1) x is (defined as) the y of z. Here y and z are either given in the base component, or result from intermediate derivations. In algorithmic models, derivations are read as instructions; an example: (1/3/1/2) Identify the y of z and call it x. In calculus models, they are read as permissions, e.g.: (1/3/1/3) For any y of a z, the symbol x may be denoted. As an illustration, consider the derivation of intransitive verbs in models of different types. A relational model will provide a conceptual definition of the notion of intransitive verb: (1/3/1/4) An intransitive verb is a verb which does not take an object. Here, Verb' and 'object', as well as 'take', either belong to the base component or have been defined in a previous definition. An algorithmic model will provide an instruction which tells us what we must do in order to find the intransitive verbs for a given base component: (1/3/1/5) Consider all verbs; check whether they take an object; single out the verbs which do not and call them intransitive verbs. A calculus model does not provide definitions of linguistic notions: all categories are considered given. All categories are at the disposal of the automaton when it pro- duces sentences. So, whereas in other models it is structures which determine con- cepts, it is the other way round for calculus models: the concepts determine the structures. As Chomsky puts it: I am assuming that the basic notion to be defined is "G is the most highly valued grammar of the lan- guage of which primary linguistic data D constitutes a sample", where D is represented in terms of primitive notions of the theory; the phonemes, morphemes, transformations, etc., of the language are, then, the elements that play a specified role in the derivation and representations determined by G.1 The derivations are in fact specimens of the concepts and define them operationally. (1/3/1/6) In order to find an intransitive verb, rewrite Vintr according to any per- missible rewriting rule. 1 Chomsky 1965: 209 (note 2 to (2.2): 66). 211</page><page sequence="234">2 1 2 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS This permission contains an implied definition: the preterminal symbol Vintr may be de- fined as "anything" into which V^tr can be rewritten.1 The derivations of a generative model are the sentences, with their immediate constituent structures, which are generated by a grammar (i.e. a base component in a calculus model). S 1.3.2 Categories There are at least two types of derivation. Certain derivations deal with elements and structures that are found in any relational systems contained in, or admitted by, the base component (although the results may turn out to be trivial for certain values of the base component). A second type, which applies only to intensional base compo- nents, deals with the very values of the base component. The latter type will be dis- cussed in § 1.3.3. The objects which are derived from the base component may comply with any mathematical specifications. They may be: 1 relations between the objects in the base component; 2 subsets of the sets of the base component; 3 systems of subsets of the sets of the base component; 4 various types of features; 5 relations between derived relations; etc. In the models of the Set-theoretical School, we frequently find definitions of spe- cific (grammatical) categories. A category is conceived of as a set of features, i.e. original features or synthetic features,2 defined to characterize a given set of objects. The use of category in the present study deviates from its use by some exponents of the Set-theoretical School, where it denotes a class which is determined by a feature (the dimension to which it belongs being referred to as functiorP' but it complies with, for example, its use in B.A. Uspenskij's and Rozdestvenskij's work on linguistic typology.4 In the models described in these volumes it is attempted to reserve the term category for categories as defined here. However, some instances of the use of the label category for what are the classes in a category according to the present terminology have become so wide-spread in the literature that changing the terms would interfere with the effort, made in the present study, to render the original lit- erature accessible.5 1 In Van den Toorn 1978 (2.5): 90, noun is defined as '"anything which can be rewritten as AT, but the further explanation makes clear that the converse statement is intended. Cf. also Brandt Corstius 1974 (3.1): 42: transformational linguistics answers the ancient question "What is a verb?" in a silly, but explicit and adequate way: the words which are located in the right-hand strings of the rewrite rules that have verb in the left-hand strings. 2 Synthetic feature-. § 1. 1.25. 3Revzin 1967b (3.15): 63. 4 Cf.

The latter set will be referred to as the domain of the category. As pointed out in § 1.1.21, features are confirmed predicates. In many categories the features are in one-to-one correspon- dence with the elements of a set; at the same time, the elements of the domain of a category may yield unique predicates which characterize the features of the cate- gory. Thus, for a category which accounts for a given state of affairs there is an equivalent alternative notation in which the original features are the domain, and the the original domain contains the features. A case system can be denoted as a set of case units characterizing a set of nouns, but also as set of sets of nouns which char- acterize a set of case units. Each feature determines a class in the domain of the category. Categories which are determined by (synthetic) dimensions1 are particularly frequent in the work of the Set-theoretical School. We can refer to this type as strong categories, while reserv- ing the term weak for systems of tolerance classes. Here is a linguistic example. The base component contains the set W of words. A derivation yields classes of words which are labelled part of speech. If each word belongs to a part of speech and no word belongs to more than one part of speech, then the parts of speech make up a strong category. If a word belongs to more than one part of speech, but no part of speech incorporates another part of speech en- tirely, then the parts of speech make up a weak category. If one part of speech incor- porates another part of speech and is yielded by the same derivation, then parts of speech cease to make up a category. When a feature system yields a category, it is not necessarily true that the alternative notation in which features and domain are interchanged also represents a category. If it is claimed for a model that it contains a definition of a certain category, it is of course essential that equivalence, or tolerance, be assured for any value of the input of an intensional base component: if the base component admits any possible relational systems for which the derivation does not yield a partition or system of tolerance classes, the model does not define a category. In most models this assurance is given, implicitly or explicitly, in either of the following manners. 1 The definition itself precludes the possibility of there being a relational system which is admitted by the base component and for which the derivation yields no tolerance or equivalence classes: it can be proved mathematically that the deriva- tion can only yield partitions or tolerance classes. 2 A constraint which rejects any relational systems for which the derivation does not yield equivalence or tolerance classes is added. The latter option is an operational device: constraints are axioms and as such belong in the base component. But it is legitimate to employ the concepts defined in a deriva- tion in order to express a constraint. Thus, there is no theoretical objection to such constraints because the derivations of a model are no more than developments (i.e. manipulations and rearrangements) of the base component. The expression of con- Marcus' 'non-elementary grammatical category' (§2.2.21ff.) Revzin's 'elementary T-category' (§3.1.5ff.), ele- mentary U-category1 (§3.3.12), 'elementary DT-category (§4.4.2ff.), 'elementary sigma category1 (§4.4.19). 1 Dimension: §1.1.22.</page><page sequence="236">2 1 4 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS straints in terms of derived concepts can be practical, as it may simplify the denota- tion of the constraints: if, for instance, we wish to formulate a constraint which stipu- lates that no three identical words may succeed each other in a string, it is practical to express the constraint in terms of words, even if 'word' is a concept which is de- rived, say, from 'morpheme1 and is not, therefore, found in the base component. S 1.3.3 Linguistic typology A second type of derivation might be termed secondary, in contrast to the primary derivations of the previous section: it deals not with the structures yielded by primary derivations from the base component, but with the classification or typology of the relational structures admitted by the base component according to the properties of the structures revealed by them through primary derivations. It is, for example, pos- sible that some primary derivations provide trivial results for some languages, i.e. for certain values of the base component, but non-trivial results for others. Consider, as an illustration, a derivation of 'word' which is based on 'morpheme'. Imagine a base component which admits relational systems such that there is a one-to-one corre- spondence between morphemes and words, which implies that the definition of 'word' is trivial for such relational systems.1 In a similar manner, Marcus' model of 'concrete gender'2 yields only one gender for English, which coincides with the set of nouns. Some derivations may well be trivial for most languages. The Set-theoretical School exploits this potential triviality of derivations to de- velop a linguistic typology: it is, for example, possible to identify the values of the base component such that the derivations of 'word' and 'morpheme' are in one-to-one correspondence, as isolating languages. The Set-theoretical School has devoted a great deal of energy to typologies of this type. These will be discussed in the present study only insofar as such discussion pertains to the definition of grammatical cate- gories.3 Typology affects the models in these volumes in the following ways. 1 Typological definitions may be a first step towards a constraint. It is possible: a to define, say, 'part of speech" for a given base component; b then to distinguish a set of possible languages such that the parts of speech which are yielded by the definition make up a category, with certain specified properties, and: c subsequently to state that all languages possess the category of part of speech. This is, of course, a constraint: relational systems whose parts of speech do not possess the specified properties, are not admitted into the set of languages. 2 Typological definitions may be a first step towards a restriction on the use of cer- tain labels. One can, for example, a restrict the derivation of the notion noun" to those languages which possess parts of speech as a category with certain properties, and: b state that nouns are not a relevant or definable concept for other languages. 1 Some consider Chinese to be a case in point. Whether this is true, or whether such languages actually exist, is beyond our present discussion. 2 See §3.2.8. 3 For details, see Revzin 1965b, Revzin 1967b iSh 113-136, Marcus 1967a (2) 36-80.</page><page sequence="237">CHAPTER 1 .3: DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT (DERIVATIONS) 2 1 5 Constraints of type 1 will be discussed in more detail in the next section. Constraints of type 2, which will be called labelling constraints, will be worked out in § 1.4.3. § 1.3.4 Constraints and universais When derivations of categories are used not only to classify possible languages, but also to declare empty on empirical grounds certain sets of possible languages, it is tempting to label the constraints thus formulated universais. In the present study, this term will be avoided. The reason is given in this section. In linguistics, the term universal is used in an inductive interpretation and a de- ductive interpretation. In the inductive or weak interpretation, universais are conceived of as properties which every attested language possesses and as such fulfil a heuristic function in an inductive process which eventually provides the definition of language. There is no place for this interpretation in a model with a base component which already purports to be a definition of language. Chomsky &amp; Lasnik, who contrast the two interpretations, refer to universais in the deductive interpretation as true universais: By a "true universal" we mean a principle that holds as a matter of biological necessity and therefore belongs to Ulniversal] Gtrammar], as contrasted with a principle that holds generally as a matter of his- torical accident in attested languages. The distinction may be difficult to establish, but is fundamental.1 Thus, according to the deductive, or strong, interpretation of the notion, universais are simply properties which every language possesses. This amounts to the statement that languages without those properties do not exist. In the metatheoretical frame- work of the present study, such an interpretation is trivial, or is a terminological re- dundancy, or rests on a methodological fallacy. As a non-theoretical observation, the strong interpretation is trivial. It is, of course, possible to state that there is no language which is exactly like English except for the meanings of the words table and chair having been interchanged. But since the complete set of languages will never be knowa the observation is only valid until the language which contradicts this statement is discovered, or becomes valid when the language which contradicts the statement becomes extinct. This implies that universais in the strong interpretation are only meaningful if they declare that languages with certain properties cannot possibly exist. In that case there are two possible varieties of the strong interpretation. 1 The strong interpretation implies that universais are part of the definition of lan- guage, or can be logically deduced from the definition. In that case, they subsume the concepts which make up a theory of language and have already been intro- duced: constraints or axioms that are part of a base component which admits the set of possible languages. This renders the term universal redundant for the pre- sent study. 2 If, on the other hand, universais are not considered to be part of the definition of language, they are a contradiction of it, because they qualify as impossible lan- 1 Chomsky &amp; Lasnik 1977 (1.1): 437, note 24.</page><page sequence="238">2 1 6 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS guages which the current definition of language qualifies as possible. In this case, the use of the concept of universal is harmful. In a number of models, the deductive use of constraints and the inductive use of uni- versais tend to conflate. Marcus, in his model of 'paradigm1,1 does not really worry about possible languages for which the model does not yield the appropriate paradigms as a category. He apparently assumes that a natural, undefined, property of language takes care of the anomalies. As will be shown in §3.0.7, this is not in fact the case. More generally, the material in this study will evoke pessimism on the pos- sibility of formulating valid constraints in terms of limitations on the properties of de- rived units: nearly all such constraints will be falsified. In view of the essential distinction between weak and strong universais, the pre- sent writer wonders why several branches of theoretical linguistics, such as genera- tive grammar, which started out operating with deductive systems claiming to deter- mine the set of possible languages nowadays invest their energy in the investigation of attested languages, which can only produce inductive universais and cannot sup- port the deductive arguments for declaring certain non-existing languages impossible. One would expect research efforts to be directed at the biological (or psychological, or sociological, or semiotic) necessities which condition the universal properties of language. The belief, credited to Hjelmslev, deserves to be endorsed that the primi- tive concepts in terms of which the cognitive object of a discipline is delimited should not be furnished by the discipline itself.2 S 1.3.5 Reality claims for the development component: no selection of derivations The base component of a model determines a, possibly infinite, set of derivations. The question arises of whether a specific model actually comprises the complete set of derivations which are determined by the base component. This section discusses de- velopment components for which this is the case. Other development components are treated in the next section. If a model does acknowledge all possible derivations of the base component, then the base component is in fact an intensional definition of a set of derivations. This is actually the case for a calculus model, such as a generative grammar, where all sen- tences (including possible immediate constituent structure and transformational his- tory) which are generated by the grammar are attributed equal status as derivations of the base component, which consists of the symbols and rules which generate them. Thus, generative grammars, even if their base components contain language-specific items, have intensional development components. All derivations of a generative grammar are attributed the same reality claim, which consists in their corroboration by the linguistic intuition of the native speaker:3 if a derivation is found which is not endorsed by the native speaker's linguistic intuition, the reality claim of the develop- 1 Marcus 1967c (3.3-3.12): 79-84. ¿ Cf. §1.2.6. 3 Intuition in Seuren's [1970: 264] first interpretation; see § 1.3.7 below.</page><page sequence="239">CHAPTER 1.3: DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT (DERIVATIONS) 2 17 ment component is not adequate.1 As a consequence, the base component of the model must be rejected: the development component is completely determined by the base component and reflects no independent options. S 1.3.6 Reality claims for the development component: selection of derivations If a model does not acknowledge the complete set of possible derivations of the base component, the reasons must be indicated why some possible derivations are incorpo- rated into the model, whereas others are not. In relational and algorithmic models, the derivations usually make up a selection from the set of potential derivations which is determined by the base component. This can be illustrated with an example. Consider the following extensional base component which contains one relational system.2 L! = Uu{0}, {Ha}) (1.3.6.1) As in (1.2.1.2), symbol A stands for the Russian alphabet; 9 is the space-, and Ha is a harp on A u {9} which contains the Russian sentences and parts of sentences. Sen- tences are considered to begin and end with 9. Punctuation marks are discarded. Con- sider two possible derivations. W={x|xe//aA V u = 9x9A A A x*y9z} (1.3.6.2) ue Ha ye Ha ze Ha X={x|xg//gaV V x = y9z} (1.3.6.3) ye A ze A Set W is the set of (parts of) strings in Ha which are set off between spaces (i.e. ortho- graphical words). Set X contains (parts of) strings in Ha which consist of: 1 a symbol which is not a space; 2 a space; 3 another symbol which is not a space. Most people will agree that in a model based on L' one is much more likely to find derivation (1.3.6.2) than derivation (1.3.6.3). But the question is why this is so. What factors determine which derivations occur in a model? The answer to this question seems to be connected with the reality claims put forward for the development com- ponent. If the empty reality claim is made for a development component, only mathematical considerations can decide which derivations are appropriate in a model. Mathematical criteria such as simplicity and elegance can be proposed, and in fact seem to be cen- tral factors in those set-theoretical models which devise new terminology, such as Kulagina's.3 1 In the course of the grammaticality discussion, the falsifying potential of the set of grammatical sen- tences has been put into perspective, as will be brought to the fore in §2.0.10. 2 Base component (1.3.6.1) is identical to base component (1.2.1.2). 3 See § 1.4.2 for Kulagina's viewpoints; see § 1.6.4 on simplicity.</page><page sequence="240">2 1 8 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS In the above example, the elegance criterion perhaps provides some indication as to why the derivation of W will be more frequent than the derivation of X. All occur- rences of the symbols of A in Ha will be covered by exactly one element of W, whereas some occurrences will be covered by two elements of X (viz. the occurrences which are preceded and followed by a space, i.e. one-letter words), and others will not be covered by elements of X at all (viz. the occurrences which are not contiguous to a space in words consisting of three or more letters). If reality claims are attributed to some, or all, derivations of a model, the kind of reality which can be claimed for derivations must be established. The very existence of the objects referred to in derivations is not involved in the reality claims for the development component. As DobruSin points out, once the real- ity claims of the concepts in the base component have been made explicit, mathemat- ics takes care of the existence or non-existence of the derived concepts: Mathematical theory makes it possible to establish the ultimate consequences of precisely formulated postulates, the plausibility of the consequences being no less than the plausibility of the postulates.1 Since derivations in relational and algorithmic models are logically deducible from the objects in the base component, the claim to existence which is made for any derived objects is identical to the claim made for the initial objects. If existence of derived concepts is trivial as a reality claim for derivations, the only aspect left for which reality claims can be formulated is their selection. For the development component, the very selection of the derivations must have some inter- pretation in reality. A proposal for a motivating principle is worked out below. S 1.3.7 Empirical interest Apparently, most of the principles which motivate the selection of derivations out of the complete set of possible derivations can be subsumed under the heading empirical interest: from the set of possible derivations, certain ones are selected that stand for categories of an empirical reality, which is determined by the, implicit or explicit, judgements which a naive speaker makes about language, or his or her native lan- guage, and which are appealed to in writing systems, in puns, in poetry, etc. Deriva- tions in a model can be expected to make explicit, or at least not to contradict, these judgements. The source of these judgements can probably be labelled intuition. There are various possible sources or locations of linguistic intuition itself. Three such sources are discussed here. 1 Biological sources. To some, linguistic intuition is an innate constellation in the hu- man brain. This seems to be a favourite source of intuition among theoretical lin- guists. 2 Socio-cultural sources. To some, linguistic intuition is the result of socialization in an environment which fosters certain habits and preconceptions about language, which are in turn nurtured by tradition and non-linguistic considerations. This seems to be a favourite source of intuition among sociolinguists; 1 DobruSin 1973: 439.</page><page sequence="241">CHAPTER 1.3: DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT (DERIVATIONS) 219 3 Cognitive sources. To some, linguistic intuition is simply accumulated previous cognitive experience with language which has not, or has only partly, been made explicit in logical terms. This seems to be a favourite source of intuition among de- scriptive linguists. The problem of the source or location of intuition is not unique to linguistics. One may similarly wonder whether the concept of a straight line or of a circle has a biological, socio-cultural or cognitive basis. In this study, no specific choice will have to be made. It is only assumed that intuition exists. To some linguists, there are different types of intuition. Seuren has discerned three: 1 the speaker's ability to distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical, to identify meanings of differ- ent sentences, and to distinguish different meanings of the same sentence-, 2 the speaker's or linguist's more or less sophisticated hunches about the structure of the sentences of his language (it is in this sense that one speaks of counter-intuitive solutions); 3 the mental structures constituting his tacit knowledge, or competence, of his language. * Seuren's type 1 is the commonest kind of intuition in Chomskian linguistics, and was referred to in § 1.3.5. Seuren's type 3 is what is called source of intuition in this study, in any of the three interpretations given in the beginning of this section. Seuren's type 2 is closest to the type of intuition presently proposed. If one wishes to distinguish this type from Seuren's first type, it can be labelled metalinguistic intuition. Revzin distinguishes linguistic ijazykovoj) and metalinguistic (lingvistiöeskij, meta- jazykovoj) intuition and regards the latter as the source of the selection of linguistic units to be defined. HTie influence of metalinguistic Uingvistiõeskij) intuition is, however, also manifest in the way in which linguistic units are formed and in the selection of relations to be described; but in the process, the intuition of the investigator is not made explicit in any way. On the contrary: it is quite arbitrary whether human intuition is made explicit; and when it happens, the way in which it happens depends on external and accidental factors.2 Revzin emphasizes that metalinguistic intuition is not reserved for linguists. As an example, he mentions that linguistically naive Russian speakers qualify [d^ as "longer" than [tjfl, even though the phonetic complexity and physical length of these sequences are identical: such naive observations determine the selection and definition of lin- guistic units or, as Seuren's remark suggests, set the margins for non-counterintuitive solutions. In fact, the two phonetic strings have different structural positions in most phonemic descriptions of Russian: ld¿ is related to biphonemic /dz/, and [tXl to monophonemic /õ/.3 1 Seuren 1970: 264. 2 Revzin 1978(1.1.1): 15. 3 Revzin's observation is accepted at face value here. The suspicion arises that the present instance is not a full-fledged example of metalinguistic intuitioa If Revzin's naive speakers are literate they may have been influenced by the standard orthography, which employs two graphemes Ux) for [d3 ] but employs a single grapheme (m ) for [tji It would be interesting to repeat the test for [ts] and [{% I which, in an extremely wide- spread variety of Russian, are of identical phonetic length and complexity, and where [ts] corresponds to two phonemes /ts/ but one grapheme (u), while [fà 1 corresponds to one phoneme /t' / but is often denoted by two graphemes (ti&gt;).

Avanesov 19725 (43): 106-107.</page><page sequence="242">220 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS At first sight, an essential difference between linguistic and metalinguistic intuition apparently consists in the fact that metalinguistic intuition involves reflection while linguistic intuition is considered to be something spontaneous. It must be asked whether this difference is really essential. Linguistic intuition concerns competence: when linguistic intuition is appealed to, it is required projecting the abstractions of competence onto one or more imaginary instances of performance. As anyone who has ever served as an informant on grammaticality will have experienced, this action of evoking instances of a presented sentence involves a great deal of reflection as well. Judgements on relatedness of meanings, likewise, may involve no less reflection than the application of orthographic rules. Thus, the difference between linguistic and metalinguistic intuition may very well be only a matter of degree. In proposing empirical interest as the reality claim for the development component in a language, the apparent fuzziness of empirical interest presents a problem. It is troublesome to delimit exactly and independently the targets which must be set for a derivation to be empirically interesting. Even though different people may implicitly agree on the purport of a concept before it is defined, they will not necessarily con- cur when listing the units of the concept for a number of languages which the ideal derivation of the concept must yield, at least as long as they do not resort to the derivation itself. In practice, therefore, we shall have to settle for the identification of areas of empirical interest, rather than fully specifiable targets. Certain derivations will end up outside any area of empirical interest. These derivations are simple to reject. The main criterion for the acceptability of deriva- tions with reality claims will therefore be negative: even if it is sometimes cumbersome to assess whether a derivation fully conforms to empirical interest, it is in many cases simple to find out when it does not conform: derivations may simply be devoid of empirical interest, or, in Seuren's terms, be counterintuitive. Even when all results of a derivation turn out to be in the same area of empirical interest when considered individually, there may be intuitive reasons to reject the overall result. An area of empirical interest may, for example, allow for two competing notions of case1. Even if the choice between them is not yet clear, a derivation may be rejected when it does not consistently produce cases according to either notion, i.e. does not provide an identical treatment for facts which are intuitively felt to belong together. So besides absolute non-counterintuitivity, intuitive consistency is a reality claim which can be made for derivations.1 Furthermore, if competing derivations are available within the same area of empir- ical interest, intuition, even when not bluntly rejecting either of the two when consid- ered in isolation, will often be able to indicate which one makes a greater appeal to our empirical interest. In comparing derivations, we may have to deal with relative empirical interest Some linguists employ the concept of naturalness to motivate relative preference between competing options.2 Naturalness, as a justification for preferred solutions, obviously represents a reality claim: it suggests an appeal to an implicit assumption of * Intuitive consistency problems will be dealt with in, for example, §5.27. 2 E.g. Ross 1972 (3.4): 116. Staal's [1967 {4k 681 use of naturalness will be discussed in §4.5.29 and §4.5.31.</page><page sequence="243">CHAPTER 1.3: DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT (DERIVATIONS) 221 a piece of nature which exists in reality and is in some sense isomorphic with the fragment of the theory for which the claim of naturalness is made. Botha rejects natu- ralness (as well as counterintuitiveness) as a motivating principle for such choices, as it refers "to psychological states of the linguist which it would be hard to characterize in a manner at once informative and non-arbitrary".1 This may be true for generative grammars, the reality claims of which pertain to pieces of nature inside the non- linguist, viz. the innate, biological status of parts of the grammar, and the intuitive basis of grammaticality judgements of the output. In such models, the linguist's met- alinguistic intuition will slip in on an ad hoc basis and cannot justify any choices be- tween formalisms which purport to connect the innate part of the grammar to gram- maticality judgements. However, when constructing models that aim to render explicit the very psychological states of the (naive) linguist, naturalness cannot be objected to as an evaluation criterion any more than grammaticality in a generative grammar. In this study, naturalness will be considered a synonym of (relative) empirical interest. When competing derivations are equally attractive in all respects, it must be won- dered whether the presumed area of empirical interest really represents a single area. If two definitions of 'word' provide empirically equally interesting 'words', we are justified in asking whether word does not happen to be a metalinguistic homonym, which may conveniently be split. Finally, when assessing the relative empirical interest of two derivations, it is con- ceivable that different intuitions evoke different preferences. Formalized derivations will enable the investigators to render their diverging intuitions explicit. It may seem artificial to separate simplicity and elegance from empirical interest. It is indeed quite possible that, in a base component which contains a valid linguistic theory, the most elegant and empirically most interesting derivations coincide (and even, as in generative grammar, comprise the complete set of derivations determined by the base component). But, in the discussion of the models of this study, this expec- tation cannot be expressed a priori. Some development components contain along with derivations which are endowed with reality claims, derivations to which no reality claims are attributed. The latter usually serve as intermediary constructs between the base component and the former. They will be labelled auxiliary derivations. In the mixed development components which contain auxiliary derivations as well as derivations with reality claims, simplic- ity and economy criteria can be applied freely to the auxiliary derivations. However, they are not appropriate for the derivations with reality claims. It cannot be assumed beforehand that reality (i.e. metalinguistic intuition) is organized in a simple and eco- nomical manner. Simplicity and economy have invented the aeroplane, but an aero- plane does not fly like a bird. § 1.3.8 Models as devices for making predictions The viability of empirical interest as a reality claim for the development component of a model varies according to the reality claims which are attributed to the base com- ponent. If the base component is a corpus of some sort which must be processed for 1 Botha 1973 (6.2.10.2): 297.</page><page sequence="244">222 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS some retrieval system, practical goals will define different types of interest. But em- pirical interest possesses particular attractiveness as a reality claim for the develop- ment component of a model the base component of which presents a theory of lan- guage, i.e. determines the set of possible languages. In that case, the model will suit the "black box" view of modelling. Mathematics can be regarded as a metasystem which connects two mutually independent cognitive aspects of reality: it deduces falsifiable predictions about one aspect of reality from the assertions that are sug- gested by the other aspect. This principle is commonplace: a grammar, as a calculus, is a deductive system which predicts the set of grammatical sentences and can be falisifed by intuitive grammatically judgements. But, as a deductive system, a grammar is rather helpless: it has no justification besides its generating intuitively acceptable sentences and their explanations. It can only be amended by trial and error, and it will eventually provide a theory on just a single language.1 Of course the scope can be widened, and has been, by the quest for a universal grammar, but the methodology does not appear to have been adapted: most of the work being done consists of inductive gathering of possible universais. After the abandoning of the original implicit assumption that any generative calculus is a possible language (an assumption which represented a theory of language, albeit a naive one), few alternative or additional deductive principles have been explicitly proposed. There are various conceivable cognitive foundations for a theory of language. Bio- logical necessity was mentioned in § 1.3.4, in the quotation of Chomsky &amp; Lasnik 1977. The function of language is frequently mentioned as a basis for linguistic theory: there are at least seven trends or programmes which, without citing each other, pro- fess to practise functional linguistics: 1 Martinet's functional linguistics, as worked out in Hervey's and Mulder's axiomatic functional linguistics and propagated in La linguistique;2 2 Halliday's functional grammar? 3 Soviet functional grammar (FG), which originated in East Germany4 around 1970 and was developed in the Soviet Union in the eighties,5 when the last Marrists faded away;6 4 Dik's functional grammar (FC?);7 5 Prague functional generative grammar, as developed by Sgall and other linguists from Czechoslovakia;8 6 Kuno's functional syntax, which has branched off from generative grammar;9 1 Cf.

As Uldall puts it, "in general it is cor- rect to say that the theory is so constructed that induction presupposes deduction, and that the theory itself is deductive, developed from the general concept of func- tion".3 The structuralist definitions of 'phoneme and 'morpheme as, respectively, the smallest set of features distinguishing meaning and as the smallest sign, can be said to be derived from a functional view of language as a sign system. As was pointed out in § 1.2.6, function may be a plausible source for the con- stituents of the base component: a mathematical explicitation of the implications of the communicative function of language, given the biological and physical options, will single out properties which plausible languages necessarily share, and will rule out many plausible non-languages. An ideal model will then enable us to step into mathe- matics from our explicit views of the function of language, and step out of mathemat- ics at points when the empirical interest that we take in language can be satisfied. Of course, once our views on the function of language have been made explicit, they may turn out to diverge. The differences produce genuine paradigmatic differences, which can be reduced to diverging opinions on the function of language, i.e. to different cognitive objects: the differences can be stated in non-linguistic terms. In a view of modelling as establishing the mathematical links between two cognitive aspects of reality, viz. a cognitive object as determined by deduction, and areas of empirical interest as obtained by induction, linguistic events (facts, data) seem to be deemed irrelevant to modelling. This can be put into perspective by the considera- tions expounded in § 1.2.15 and in § 1.3.5 above. The two involved cognitive aspects, viz. deduction and empirical interest, in fact represent the two filters by which we perceive and process reality. Perception of language, i.e. the process of identifying and ordering a set of chaotic sensory impressions, either proceeds through our con- ceptual biases on language, which, having been made explicit, represent the base component, the theory; or proceeds through reflection as motivated by intuition, which, then, represents our development component. These filters are independent, in principle, of properties of specific languages, whereas linguistic events represent such specific properties. A general model of language must of course account for all and any specific linguistic events, and its structure may be prompted by them, but, in order to enable making predictions on events, must be independent x&gt;f them as a logi- cal structure. Moreover, the assumption of mutual independence of the two cognitive aspects en- ables us to view model construction as an empirical discipline: by experimentally checking the derivations from a base component theory we attempt, by trial and er- ror, to establish predictions on our metalinguistic intuitions on language.

Labels can be used in two manners, which must be distinguished. Neglect of the distinction is probably a major source of misunderstanding in discussions on linguistic theory. Labels can be used extensionally and intensionally. 1 When employed extensionally labels identify and distinguish objects of concrete, given relational systems to which the model is applied, or they identify and distin- guish results of derivations which are applied to those objects. Labels which are used extensionally have constant reference only within the relational systems for which they are used; the extensional use of a label for one relational system has no automatic implications for the use of the same label in another relational system. Here is an example. Consider the following extensional base component L', which contains one rela- tional system.1 Li = (AU {9}, {Ha}) (1.4.1.1) Symbol A denotes the Russian alphabet, symbol 9 denotes the space, and Ha is a harp2 on A u {9}, which contains the Russian sentences and parts of sentences. Sentences are considered to begin and end with 0. Punctuation marks are dis- carded. In this example, the labels A, 0, and Ha are used extensionally: each of them refers to one specific set of objects. A definition of W which is based on L't for example derivation (1.3.6.2), will provide the set of (presumed) Russian words and nothing else. Thus, label W is also used extensionally: its use in the present rela- tional system has no implications for the use of the label W in other relational sys- tems. Consider, as an example, base component L3 (extensional, one relational system), ¿3 = (Q {He}) (1.4.1.2) where C represents the Arabic alphabet and Hc is a harp on C which contains the set of Arabic sentences and parts of Arabic sentences. Assume two subsets of C, which are either given or derived: Cinltial and Cfinai. If the label W is used exten- sionally, there are no objections to singling out a set of substrings of Hc which be- gin with an element of Qnitiai and end with an element of Cfinai, and to attaching to this set the label W. 2 When labels are used intensionally, they are employed to identify and distinguish points of a given model: the model decides on their application to individual rela- tional systems. The labels are variables insofar as they refer to different (sets of) objects for each relational system which is covered by the model. They are con- 1 The base component in (1.4.1.1) is identical to that of (1.2.1.2) and (1.3.6.1). 2 A harp is a set of strings: cf. § 1.2.1: see §2.0.6 and §2.0.7 for a discussion. 225</page><page sequence="248">226 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS stants in the sense that the criteria which determine their application remain within a given model the same throughout. Here is an example. Consider an intensional base component L, L = (Au{8},{//a}) (1.4.1.3) where A is the label of any alphabet (set of symbols); label 9 is a specific symbol not included in A; the label Ha stands for any harp on any A. If the maximal harp on Au {8}, i.e. the complete set of strings which can be made up from elements of AU {G},1 is denoted by //A, then HaCHA (1.4.1.4) for any A and any Ha. Furthermore, let us assume the following constraints. A A x99y = x9y (1.4.1.5) xeHk yeHA i.e. two consecutive 9 are treated as a single 9; A V (y*9Ax = 9y9) (1.4.1.6) xeHa yeHk i.e. all strings in Ha begin and end with 9 and contain at least one symbol from A; A A A (x = y9z=Mye //flAze Ha)) (1.4.1.7) xeHa ye//A zeHk i.e. for a string in Ha, any parts of the string which begin and end with 9 also belong in Ha. Then consider the derivation of W: W={x|x€//aA A A x*y9z} (1.4.1.8) This definition of '(orthographical) word' is apparently equivalent to the definition of (1.3.6.2). But in the present definition all labels (L; A; 9; W) are employed inten- sionally. Whereas (1.3.6.2) dealt with just the Russian word1, (1.4.1.8) is a general definition of 'word' which is valid for all relational systems which fit the intensional base component (including many non-texts, which precludes that (1.4.1.3) is a lin- guistically relevant definition of language). Here the question of whether A denotes the Russian, Roman, or Greek alphabet does not affect the derivation of W. If A, Ha and 9 take respectively the values of the Chinese character set, the set of Chinese texts, and a space, then words and sentences will coincide: Chinese orthography does not employ variable spacing between characters. Of course, this conclusion does not seem satisfactory. One of the reasons for this is the fact that it contra- dicts the reality claims which are usually endorsed for the label word. Reality claims for labels will be discussed in the following section. 1 The maximal harp is the free monoid which is generated by A U {8 }. This concept will be introduced in §2.0.2.</page><page sequence="249">CHAPTER 1.4: LABELS 227 In linguistic models, the transition from intensional to extensional labels is often im- plicit. A phonetic symbol, say [t], is an intensional label. It presupposes a phonetic model which classifies all speech sounds as [t] or non-[t], whatever language the model is applied to. If no sound of a given language possesses the properties which charac- terize [t], then the label will not be employed in the description of that language ac- cording to the given phonetic model. A phonological symbol, on the other hand, which stands for a specific phoneme of a language, is most often used extensionally (unlike the label phoneme itself, which is usually intensional). The properties which are indi- cated by the phonological label I'J must be specified separately for each language in the description of which the investigator proposes to employ /t/. Thus, in linguistic descriptions phonetic units are labelled intensionally, the labels being determined by model or theory, whereas phonological units are labelled exten- sionally, i.e. arbitrarily, the labels being determined by conventions and traditions. The distinction which has been expounded here for the linguistic metalanguage is not unlike that found in language itself between ordinary linguistic signs and proper names. Usually, linguistic forms refer to sets of features which characterize possible referents, rather than to the referents themselves: the referents of boy are united by a common boyhood, which makes boy an intensional label. Proper names, on the other hand, are used to refer directly to referents. The only common property of people called Francis or places called Cambridge is that they carry the same label: there is no common Francisness or Cambridgeness. This makes Francis and Cambridge exten- sional labels. The degree of confusion between intensional and extensional use of labels varies between periods in the history of linguistics. The distinction was hardly realized in traditional grammar, but in the fifties and sixties structural dialectologists such as Weinreich seriously worried about it.1 Reid complains that: [...] we cannot identify or even compare any Spanish vowel-phoneme with any Italian vowel-phoneme, because a member of a 5-term system is intrinsically different from a member of a 7-term system. We cannot even compare the two vowel-systems by saying that one has 5 members and the other 7, be- cause the meaning of the category Vowel1 is fixed for each language by the vowel-consonant opposi- tion, which is itself different for each language.2 Pulgram points out in 1964 that, strictly speaking, then, there is no such thing as com- parative phonemics etc., as the basis for comparison is theoretically empty.3 Of course a basis for comparison is easily found in the case of dialects and related languages, where the determination of the (historical) basis of comparison is the very objective of the science: dialectologists should be the last to worry. In the same year, on the other hand, Chomsky proposes to neglect the problem, if only temporarily. Considering such category labels as NOUN and VERB, he makes the following observation. The goal of traditional "universal grammar" was, of course, to give a substantive general account of these categories, thus fixing a universal "vocabulary" for the (generative) grammars of all languages. Presumably, such fixed universal category symbols would have to be defined in terms of formal prop- 1 Cf. Weinreich 1954. 2 Reid I960: 12. 0 Pulgram 1964: 67.</page><page sequence="250">228 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS erties of grammars and, perhaps, language-independent semantic properties of some sort. Whatever the feasibility of this enterprise may be, we will not consider it here, and will regard the category names for the time being as only conventional. ^ Whatever the feasibility of this enterprise may be, its plausibility is a methodological prerequisite for meaningful non-historical cross-linguistic comparison. This was not Chomsky's concern at the time, but in the practice of generative grammar the problem does not seem to have been generally acknowledged in the subsequent decades, when properties of specific languages were actually being compared through a universal grammar. In 1984, for example, Odijk employs a language-specific criterion (the "n- test") in order to sort out prepositions and adverbs; subsequently the behaviour of the resulting classes is related to the behaviour of categories which are denoted by their labels in a universal grammar.2 In the seventies and eighties, unconcerned comparison of extensional labels seems to have come back into fashion even more strongly among semanticists: tenses, aspects, cases and articles tend to be identified across languages (and posited as universal properties of human language) on the basis of lit- tle more than their labels. S 1.4.2 Reality claims for labels Labels can be devoid of any reality claims: models may simply draw from a stock of free labels. In that case, the intensional use of a given label in one model does not entail any implications for the use of the same label in another model; at most, some labels may be preferred to other labels for mnemonic reasons. Thus, the fact that in one model a variable set of objects is referred to as nouns provides no cogent reason to restrict or regulate the use of noun in other models. Similarly, the extensional use of a given label for an object or set of objects of a specific relational system to which the model is applied, has no implications with re- spect to the use of the same term for other relational systems. Thus, labels without reality claims are model-specific when used intensionally, and input-specific when used extensionally. If labels have no reality claims, there is little room for K-questions such as (1/0/1/ 1).3 These questions either presuppose a specific model in which the label {case) is employed, or the instruction to construct any model and assign the label somewhere in it. But Kolmogorov proposed constructing a model which did not yet exist and in which the label would be assigned in a non-arbitrary manner. Let us therefore consider to what extent labels can carry reality claims. Intern sional labels, in particular, are often laden with long-ranging traditions as to their use. The use of a label in a model often implies the claim of continuing a tradition, and possibly adding to it. There are two ways in which linguistic tradition can be valued. 1 Firstly, one may say that it is there and reflects valuable results of previous inves- tigations, but that its contents are arbitrary in themselves. In that case traditional labels have a useful mnemonic value, but their distribution need not be accounted 1 Chomsky 1964a (4.1): 60, footnote 1. 2 Odijk 1984; for details on Odijk's /rtest, see §4.4.24. 3 K-question (1/0/1/1): "What exactly do we mean when we say that two words are in the same case?"</page><page sequence="251">CHAPTER 1.4: LABELS 229 for in a formal manner. This seems to be the position of early generative grammar: such labels as noun, verb and case are introduced and evoke traditional connota- tions but no attempt is made to account for these connotations and establish an explicit link with the traditional concepts. 2 Secondly, one may regard traditional viewpoints as inexact and non-specific, but their categories, nevertheless, as valuable because they are based on naive obser- vations of languages which are there to be accounted for by modern linguistics. In that case, traditional labels specify specific areas of empirical interest, which constitute their reality claims. According to the latter approach, the label word is employed in linguistic publications because the reader is supposed to know somehow what a word is. A model makes this knowledge explicit. In this approach the reality claimed for labels is closely con- nected with the reality often claimed for the development component: metalinguistic intuition.1 It is to be expected that, if this kind of intuition exists, some of it will have found its expression in (naive) linguistic terminology. There is, however, no necessary one-to-one correspondence between the reality claims of the concepts selected in the development component on the basis of met- alinguistic intuition and the reality claims of the labels distributed in a model. There is no reason to presume that all metalinguistic intuition has found its terminological ex- pression: a poet knows and exploits the limitations which are imposed by patterns of rhythm and rhyme and does not always think of them in terms of phonemes and sylla- bles, units which a grammarian would hold responsible for the limitations. The fluctuating status of labels in the various branches of the Set-theoretical School, which was signalled in § 1.0.8, can now be reduced to the presence or absence of reality claims for intensional labels in their models. No reality claims were main- tained by Kulagina, who took up linguistic modelling in order to develop a new gram- mar.2 She avoids traditional terms so as to avoid their being burdened with the biases of traditional grammar. Terms such as neighbourhood iokrestnost')2 and family (semejstvo)4 cover notions which resemble, or coincide with, paradigm1 and 'case as employed by other exponents of the Set-theoretical School. Kolmogorov, on the other hand, regards traditional linguistic terminology, and the complex of its associations with specific areas of empirical interest, as a point of departure for linguistic mod- elling. This conception of modelling as dealing with existing linguistic terms and con- cepts is most explicitly formulated by Gladkij, as quoted in § 1.0.8. Beleckij, who, as a calculus grammarian, does not belong to the Set-theoretical School, proposes a synthesis. He finds that linguists dealing with models generally claim to pursue two aims: the construction of a mathematical model, i.e. the design of a specific type of calculus which is convenient for the description of language, and the subsequent construction of a concrete model, i.e. a concrete calculus of the proposed 1 Cf. §1.3.7. 2 Cf. the quotation in § 1.0.8. d Kulagina 1958: 203. In Kulagina I960: 228 okrestnost' is rendered as vicinity. The concept will be ex- plained in §3.0.2. 4 Kulagina I960: 232, 1958: 206. The concept will be explained in §2.2.5.</page><page sequence="252">230 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS type. Beleckij observes that the linguists constructing calculus models, in spite of their diverse theoretical frameworks, operate according to a uniform principle: rThey construct models by introducing basic concepts and the relations between them, and proceed to describe grammatically correct sentences through these concepts and relations. The concepts thus intro- duced are very similar, in content, properties, and even labels, to the concepts which are operated with in traditional linguistics. For example, Chomsky needed the concept of immediate constituent for the construction of his model. [...] In other models the concept of government is used. [...] Obviously this is not a coincidence. The goal of these efforts is the design of a mathematical model as a convenient in- strument for the description of the construction of the sentences of natural languages. It is hard to imagine that language can be conveniently described in terms of inherent relations which have remained unnoticed in traditional linguistics throughout the centuries of its existence. Therefore, in the construc- tion of any mathematical model of language, an additional goal is pursued as well: the formalization of linguistic concepts.^ Beleckij's observations and programme are laudable: responsible linguists are likely to employ the existing conceptual systems in which linguistic knowledge has been accu- mulated as a basis for further accumulation. But Beleckij's goals cannot be posited a priori in the description of linguistic models. There is no reason why the authors of linguistic models should be responsible: the authors of the models are free to ignore linguistic tradition, or to be ignorant of it.2 The metalanguage of linguistics is not real- ly different from the object language itself: terms may acquire new meanings, because the old ones are poorly understood, or because of their convenient mnemonics, or simply because the use of the old passwords provides legitimization of the ideas in the organization of the discipline. As in object languages, the new meanings may eventually oust the old meanings when the power of the group who uses the new meanings increases. The metalinguistic philologist can only register these develop- ments.3 Thus, when dealing with linguistic models, he must indicate whether the use of a label, say case, implies an appeal to the case notions of the out-group, or only rep- resents mnemonic convenience for the in-group. As to the use of labels in the Set-theoretical School, most of its exponents find themselves somewhere between Kulagina's and Gladkij's viewpoints. Some new termi- nology is introduced, sometimes the contents of older terms are replaced and some of the traditional concepts retained, paired to their original terms. Traditional concepts 1 Beleckij 1968b (1): 46-47. 2 The early work of the Set-theoretical School, as well as much of theoretical linguistics in the west of the same period, is characterized by the gradual discovery of the concepts and problems of linguistics by lin- guistically naïve mathematicians. In a sense, they made up a metalinguistic laboratory experiment: the mathematician's metalinguistic creole may reveal how much, and which, traditional linguistics can be dis- covered spontaneously, and, consequently, how universal traditional concepts prove to be. An example of such reasoning is Staal 1967 (0) 3ff., where Pänini's ancient model and Chomsky's model are viewed as in- dependent manifestations of the same thing and consequently confirm the reality status of what the models have in common. 3 De Haan [1987 (4.3.2): 92] takes up a normative position in metalinguistic matters and seriously regrets ahistorical adoption of traditional labels for new concepts which are not claimed to cover phenomena asso- ciated with original usage. (His example is the adoption of subject by generative grammar.) Wierzbicka re- grets the usurpation of case, but resigns herself to it. "Cases have fallen on hard times. No one believes in them anymore. No one takes them seriously. They have even lost their name. They can no longer be called "cases"; they have to be called "surface cases." [Wierzbicka 1980 (introduction): xi] As a political phe- nomenon, label usurpation is not of course restricted to linguistics. It might be an interesting subject of re- search in the sociology of science.</page><page sequence="253">CHAPTER 1.4: LABELS 231 are often employed for items in the base component because, where concepts are given from outside, the "outside" which is usually resorted to is ready-made and tradi- tion-based knowledge about what constitutes, say, a word or a sentence. New termi- nology is often employed for auxiliary derivations: if derivations have no reality claims, i.e. if no empirical interest is attributed to them, it is inconvenient to employ labels for them which do have reality claims. § 1.4.3 Constraints and spaces for extensional labels The nature of possible reality claims presents a problem for the extensional use of la- bels. If extensional labels are specified separately for each relational system in which they are applied, there seems to be no reason why their use in different systems should indicate any similarity between the objects to which they refer: apparently, there is no aspect of reality to which labels correspond as such. Whereas there is a [t]-ness, there is no /t/-ness, as there is boyhood but no Cambridgeness. This would imply that extensional linguistic labels as components in a linguistic meta-model can- not have reality claims. Yet, the extensional distribution of labels is not usually arbitrary in linguistics. Most investigators are quite definite as to their reasons (or consistent in spite of the absence of explicit reasons) for labelling one phoneme of a language I'J and another /p/. Even if the distribution of phonological labels is not always fully consistent, it is not usually random. This suggests that there exists some kind of /t/-ness after all: the extensional label IxJ seems to carry some kind of reality claim. The question is what the phonemes which are denoted by the symbol /t/ have in common.1 It is often stated that they cover the phonetic variant [t], or that their principal variant is [t], but this does not mean that it suffices for a phoneme to include a variant [t] to be labelled l'l. Here is an example. Consider two languages L' and L^ Language L' possesses phoneme x which com- prises variants [t] and [dl. Language L2 possesses phoneme y which comprises [t] and phoneme z which comprises [dl. The criteria which are sufficient for Li to attach the label /t/ to y and the label /d/ to z, fail to decide for L' whether to attach N or /d/ to x. An example from linguistic practice is presented by the various romanizations of Chi- nese, in some of which t is employed to denote a phoneme which comprises the vari- ants [t] and [dl, whereas in others t is employed to denote a phoneme which comprises [t'l It is perhaps not impossible to construct a refined system of criteria for distribut- ing extensional labels so as to be able to assign I'J in an unambiguous manner to phonemes of any language, but it is questionable, in view of the following considera- tions, whether it makes sense to try to do so. 1 Of course the I'J phonemes can be defined as containing the same distinctive features, but that would only shift the problem: the same questions can be put with respect to distinctive features. The relation be- tween phonetic features, which are intensional, and distinctive features, which are extensional, is fully analogous to the relation between phonetic sound classes and phonemes. For simplicity's sake the present exemplification is given in terms of sounds and phonemes, rather than features.</page><page sequence="254">232 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS 1 A refined system of instructions would no longer be based on reality claims in the form of intuitive knowledge about what is a typical /t/ and what is not: intuition does not motivate an unequivocal decision on the assignment of N in Chinese. 2 If a system is devised which would, a priori account for the distribution of N over any possible language, I'J would cease to be an extensional label: if there are cri- teria by which it is possible to state for any language whether it possesses the phoneme /t/ and, for languages which possess /t/, to identify it, then there exists a phonological /t/-ness which can be defined intensionally through a derivation in a model. It is, incidentally, improbable that a property or set of properties which makes up I'J- ness exists. Such properties would have to be either primitive or derived. Primitive N- ness presupposes that the concept of phoneme (anything between slashes) is also primitive. Derived /t/-ness presupposes constraints of the following type. (1/4/3/1) Within the space which is intensionally allotted to [t] in a phonetic model, there is a core of phonetic properties which is never shared by two or more phonemes of the same language. The label N can then be assigned to the single phoneme which covers the core. Such constraints imply that the core can be localized and that it is in fact covered by a significant part of the phonemes which are traditionally denoted by /t/. Then the question arises of whether similar constraints can be formulated for all phonemes of all possible languages. Consideration of, say, te] suggests that, in many instances, a space which is never shared by two phonemes of the same language would have to be infinitesimal and consequently would no longer accommodate a significant part of the phonemes which are traditionally denoted by /a/. This leaves unsolved the problem of the nature of the reality claims of extensional labels. The present metalinguistic problem may be elucidated by a closer examination of its linguistic parallel which was presented in § 1.4.1. Consider the name John. Although there is no common Johnness which is shared by all Johns, the name provides us with certain information: John is restricted to men. In some languages, or perhaps cultures, the assignment of proper names is subject to various restrictions. It is easy to imagine a culture where the choice of names for persons who are born on a particular day is restricted to the names of a number of saints to which the day is dedicated; or a culture where the names which children re- ceive are based on the order in which they are born into a family (compare the Latin names Primus ('first'), Secundus ('second'), or the Japanese name Ichiro ('first')); sys- tems are possible by which names are unambiguously tied to some referential function and present borderline cases with intensional names (think of "deictic" proper names such as Papa and Mama). Linguists have often wondered to what extent the distribu- tion of proper names must be accounted for: where do units of a referential nature, such as saints and calendars, enter into a description of language, if at all? If proper names are to be accounted for, the explanations will be of a special type. Instead of a meaning, i.e. a set of properties, only an assignment space can be defined for a proper</page><page sequence="255">CHAPTER 1.4: LABELS 233 name: a set of constraints on its use, which, however, fail to determine its use exhaus- tively: all Johns are male persons, but not every male person is a John. Now consider the similarity with extensional labels in linguistic models. The use of the symbol N provides some information about any phoneme for which it is used: it is reasonable to expect that /t/ possesses a variant [t]. The converse is not true: the pos- session of a variant [t] does not imply that a phoneme is labelled /t/. One may wonder where a specification of restrictions on the extensional use of labels enters a model. If it does, the specification will not have the same theoretical status as the remaining part of the model. The description of the distribution of extensional labels will not be a system of definitions or instructions which unequivocally determine linguistic con- cepts, but a series of restrictions on the use of labels for specimens of linguistic con- cepts. An example: (1/4/3/2) The label /t/ is only used for phonemes and cannot be used for phonemes without a variant which is not at least partly1 articulated in the [t]-space. Rules of this type are not instructions: they do not state where /t/ must be used, be- cause the model does not exclude situations where instructions would conflict. There may, for instance, be languages where obligatory distribution rules for phonemic la- bels would assign two labels to the same phoneme (e.g. l'l and /d/) or would assign the same label to two different phonemes (e.g. if there are two phonemes with variants in the [t]-space), while the model (i.e. the theory and its derivations) does not provide rea- sons for assigning any specific label. The implication for an approach to K-questions is that there are two paraphrases for each such question, a strong one and a weak one. Consider the following K-ques- tion.2 (1/4/3/3) What exactly do we mean when we say that two words are in the same case? Its strong paraphrase is: (1/4/3/4) When do we have to say that two words are in the same case? Its weak paraphrase is: (1/4/3/5) What do we know when we are told that two words are in the same case? The answer to a strongly paraphrased K-question (the strong answer) is a model in which the label case is applied intensionally; the answer to a weakly paraphrased K- question (the weak answer) is a model in which the label is not employed, and which is accompanied by a set of restrictions on the use of a label (labelling constraints) of the following type. (1/4/3/6) The label case can only be assigned to morphological categories. This restriction ensures that, whenever we read case in a linguistic description, we know that we are dealing with a morphological category. But that is all: not every 1 Partly either in time or in place (as in the case of simultaneous release of air at two points in the vocal tract). 2 K-question (1/4/3/3) is identical to (1/0/1/1).</page><page sequence="256">234 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS morphological category is called case, and not every language necessarily possesses exactly one morphological category for which the label case is appropriate. Thus, the K-question (1/4/3/7) What exactly do we mean when we say that two sounds are variants of the same phoneme? can be strongly paraphrased if we presume that variant and phoneme are intensional labels. On the other hand, the K-question (1/4/3/8) What exactly do we mean when we say that a phoneme is a /t/? is weakly paraphrased if we presume that I'J is an extensional label. The set of restrictions on the use of a label x determines a possibly heterogeneous set of objects, sets and relations, which are part of a model for which x may be used, on the condition of non-ambiguity of its use within each relational system. This set can be termed the space of an extensional label. Thus, if (1/4/3/6) would be the only la- belling constraint on case, it would define the case space as the set of morphological categories. If 'morphological category1 can be defined intensionally, case space1 can likewise be defined intensionally. But if morphological category itself is an extensional label for which only a space has been defined, case space cannot be an intensional la- bel.* Most of the models that are discussed in this study treat part of speech, paradigm, case, gender as intensional labels: the corresponding K-questions are strongly para- phrased.2 Individual cases and genders (nominative, masculine) are regarded as ex- tensional labels without reality claims,3 as was already indicated by Kolmogorov's second question:4 (1/4/3/9) How many cases does the Russian language possess? This suggests that individual cases of concrete languages are units without general properties which can be derived in a model. No attempt is made to derive, say, a nomi- native. The K-question: (1/4/3/10) What exactly do we mean if we say that a word is in the nominative case? is not submitted by the exponents of the Set-theoretical School, since nominative is considered an extensional label without independent reality claims. The only answer might be: (1/4/3/1 1) We do not mean anything by it: we only needed a label. 1 This statement will be qualified in § 1.4.4. 2 Exceptions are some of Marcus' models: it is, for example, hardly fruitful to interpret Marcus' [1967c (3.3-3.12): 79-84] model of paradigm1 as strong, in spite of his claims; see §3.0.7. 3 Here, too, one of Marcus' models presents some complications: see § 3.2. 7ff. 4 K-question (1/4/3/9) is identical to (1/0/1/2).</page><page sequence="257">CHAPTER 1.4: LABELS 235 Note the contrast with the approach adopted by Fillmore, which triggered the re- newed interest in universal case1. Fillmore chooses his case labels carefully and at- taches specific meanings to them.1 Thus, the models treated in these volumes present a quest for a strong answer to K-questions concerning the general notions of case, gender, etc. A category in the sense of § 1.3.2 is defined for each label. Individual cases, genders, etc., are simply re- garded as classes of the categories of case, gender, etc., the labels of which are lan- guage-specific, i.e. arbitrary from a metalinguistic viewpoint. § 1.4.4 Secondary intensional labels An interesting case occurs when a model assigns labels extensionally, i.e. separately for each relational system, but employs the concepts thus labelled in derivations of concepts with intensional labels. Consider, for example, a model which derives part of speech1 but does not derive specific parts of speech, such as noun' and 'verb1. These labels are assigned exten- sionally, according to some labelling constraint, to the parts of speech which have been obtained. Subsequently, the model derives case1 on a domain consisting of the class of nouns. Thus, case is an intensional label in a secondary sense. The question is whether the model is a strong or a weak answer to K-question (1/4/3/3). Language itself offers an analogy to this situation in the metalanguage of linguis- tics. In § 1.4.3, extensional labels were compared to proper names. The position of the label case in the above example can be compared to that of patronymics. The status of the label part of speech is comparable to that of boy's name: it intensionally desig- nates an area in which intensional labels can be employed. The label noun is compa- rable to Iván: the labels are extensionally assigned to certain male persons. But once a person is named Ivan, his son's middle name is necessarily Ivánoviõ. Thus, the label Ivánoviõ is assigned intensionally with respect to an extensional label: although the Ivans of the world do not share a common I vanity, the Ivánoviões of the world share a common Ivánoviõness. Similarly, in the above model, case1 is intensionally defined with respect to the extensional label noun. But is a metalanguage allowed to do what language does? It is generally accepted that language is part of the world which is captured by language, but is it acceptable that the metalanguage be part of the language which is described by the metalan- guage? The present writer has no clear answer. The question is not really pertinent at present. A model which consists entirely of strong answers to K-questions is a remote ideal situation: it is not going to be reached in this study, which only treats fragments of full models. Even if the presented frag- ments are strong when considered by themselves, other parts, not yet worked out, are often suspected to require extensional label assignment, so all intensional labels may be suspected to be secondary. Assuming that a model is only as strong as its weakest derivation, all models in this study are weak. 1 True, at first syntactic cases and morphological cases were dissociated, to become accidental metalinguis- tic homonyms, but Chomsky's programmatic [19822 (1): 6] statement that "case theory deals with assign- ment of abstract case and its morphological realization" has encouraged attempts to restore the link.</page><page sequence="258">CHAPTER 1.5: PARTIAL AND SUBSTITUTION AL MODELS § 1.5.1 Target concepts Thus far, models have been treated as if they represent or presuppose a (potentially) full system of linguistic methodology. In fact, the models discussed in this study are only fragmentary. They are so in two respects. On the one hand, their base compo- nents do not always contain primitive objects for which full theoretical justification is sought: such cases will be dealt with in the next sections. On the other hand, models do not always attempt to answer all K-questions: in some cases, they deal with a limited number of terms, or even only one term. The number of labelled derivations actually worked out in a model is, of course, necessarily limited for models which allow an in- finite number of legitimate derivations. An example for calculus models: generative grammars provide only a limited number of specimen sentences.1 The models in this study are usually models of specific concepts: a model of a con- cept is a part of a possibly imaginary full model which presents the (derivational) his- tory of a single (labelled) derivation. Thus, in a generative grammar, a model of a sentence is the complex which consists of its possible deep structure and its trans- formational history, i.e. all symbols and rules which are relevant to the derivation of that particular sentence. For relational or algorithmic models, if x is a linguistic term and M is a full model containing x, then an (M-)model of x is a specification of: 1 the derivation which defines x; 2 the derivations in M which are relevant for 1, i.e. the intermediate steps on a logi- cal path from the base component to the derivation of x; 3 the primitive objects, relations and constraints in the base component of M which are relevant for the derivations of 2. Thus, assuming that a derivation of the nominative presupposes a derivation of case1, a model of case1 does not contain the derivation of the nominative, whereas a model of the nominative will in fact contain the derivation of case1. When x is a traditional label commonly used to refer to a class of objects with a specific empirical interest, the class referred to by x is the target concept of M. The target concepts of many models in this study are case1 and 'gender1. § 1.5.2 Indirect reality claims: modules or partial models There are base components and derivations the reality claims of which do not directly refer to the objects of scientific investigation. Two varieties of indirect reality claims are described below. 1 The reality claims relate to objects of reality which are not the objects of exami- nation. A regular correspondence is however presupposed between the objects to which the reality claims relate and the objects of examination. Thus, a reality claim is split into a direct reality claim and an indirect reality claim. The direct reality claim concerns the correspondence between the model and reality; the indirect 1 Besides, generative grammars also have fragmentary base components because a complete generative grammar has never been written: actual grammars leave out the initial objects and relations (alphabet and rules) which are not relevant for the specific types of sentences with which they are dealing. 236</page><page sequence="259">CHAPTER 1.5: PARTIAL AND SUBSTITUTION AL MODELS 237 reality claim concerns the correspondence (isomorphism) between two (sets of) objects in reality, one of which is the object or set of objects for which the direct reality claim is made. Models with indirect reality claims of this kind are referred to as "substitut tonal" models. They are treated in the next section. 2 The reality claims pertain to objects of the same level of abstraction as the model itself. These objects are presumed to have in turn their own reality claims refer- ring to real objects. Models with indirect reality claims of this kind are referred to as partial models. In partial models the base component does not (exclusively) contain the sets and rela- tions which are considered primary in an absolute sense, but (also) sets and relations which are considered to be the products of one or more derivations which are not provided. Initial, or rather pseudo-initial, objects of this kind will be referred to as provisional or preliminary (parts of) base components. As an example, consider a morphological model which contains phonemes in its base component. There are two possible reasons for accommodating phonemes in the base component of a model. The author of the model may have considered phonemes to be primitive units of linguistic theory. But perhaps he or she considered the model as such not to be concerned with the definition of phonological concepts, or assumed that the definition of phoneme is logically (if not necessarily chronologically) prior to the definition of morphological concepts. Most models of the Set-theoretical School are implicitly considered partial models. Mel'ouk [1975] was the first to state explicitly the distinction between original and provisional initial objects. He developed a system of morphological terminology the base component of which contains concepts of three types: fl Initial Usxodnyj) concepts, i.e. linguistic notions deliberately left undefined within the framework of our approach. The corresponding terms are deliberately explained in a simple manner, i.e. by means of non-formal considerations and examples. 2 A series of linguistic concepts which, generally speaking, must be defined but whose definitions cannot, for some reason or other, be provided in this paper (the author does not have the definition available at this stage; the number of preliminary concepts required for the definition is too large and takes up too much space, whereas their content is not relevant to morphology; etc.). Definitions of these concepts, and their corresponding terminology, are considered given. 3 All necessary general scientific, in particular logical, concepts and terms, and also some words of the Russian language which in the definitions play only a syntactic or other auxiliary part. * Examples of Mel'ouk's type 1 notions are relations between signifiants and signifiés; type 2 notions are phonemes and word forms; type 3 notions are objects, sets, logical connectives and quantifiers. In this study, type 3 notions constitute a separate com- ponent, viz. the technical connectives. Type 1 notions make up the base component of full models, whereas type 2 notions, i.e. provisional initial objects, are only found in partial models. A model of a target concept may also be partial. Thus, a model of 'phoneme1, which contains in its base component a set of distinctive features, provides only those derivations which are intermediate steps on the logical path to its derivation. If the 1 Mel'euk 1975 (4): 14.</page><page sequence="260">238 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS reality claims for distinctive features are indirect, i.e. presuppose an existent or non- existent model of 'distinctive feature1, then the model is a partial model of phoneme1. This view of linguistic modelling induces a modular approach to linguistic theory. Linguistic theory can be viewed as a composite body made up of small partial models of linguistic concepts serving as its modules, and developing incrementally: modules are substituted as a result of detailed investigation, and different modules may com- pete for the same slot. Thus, a module for the notion of morpheme can have a base component which contains provisional phonemes; it can be based on any of a number of competing modules for phoneme1, as long as the latter do not contain "morpheme1 in their base components or employ the label morpheme for one of their intermediate derivations. The real problem with this view of linguistic modelling is of course monitoring the mutual compatibility of the modules. Mel'ouk's footnote to the above quotation is in- structive: HTie author hopes that for the definitions of the concepts of type 2 no concepts will be required which are defined in this paper by means of type 2 concepts, i.e. that no vicious circle will occur.1 So in the final instance the validity of a partial model can only be fully assessed with respect to a full model which is fixed to the extent that it can be represented by a dominance graph connecting its concepts which shows which concepts are used to derive which concepts, and which does not contain reflexive and symmetric pairs. In the present study, this graph will be referred to as the deductive order of a full model. The Set-theoretical School has not paid much explicit attention to Mel'ouk's deductive order problem. Revzin's proposals for a deductive order between grammatical cate- gories will be presented in §4.6.42.2 S 1.5.3 Indirect reality claims: substitutional models There are models in which the reality claims of some components concern objects in reality which are implicitly or explicitly acknowledged to be non-linguistic phenom- ena. Consider, as an example, base components containing a body of written texts. Au- thors employing such base components no not always claim that these are "language itself", in spite of accusations on the part of conservative Soviet linguists that they do.3 Mostly, they only hope that texts behave like or reflect linguistic phenomena (such as utterances) in a number of relevant aspects, to a degree which is sufficient to make texts serve as an analogue of language in the model, so that all derivations which are based on them provide a similar analogue to derived linguistic objects. Do- bruSin's statement, quoted in § 1.3.6, on the conservation of plausibility in mathemati- cal operations applies here as well. 1 Mel'cuk 1975 (4h 14, note *. z Revzin 1969b; Revzin speaks of hierarchies of grammatical categories, but the term deductive hierarchy happens to be reserved for a different concept, which will be introduced in § 1.6.8. 3 See the footnote on this issue in S 1.2.1.</page><page sequence="261">CHAPTER 1.5: PARTIAL AND SUBSTITUTION AL MODELS 239 The device of substituting non-linguistic objects for linguistic phenomena as an object of examination is explicitly applied by Zaliznjak when he states that, instead of a form of spoken Russiaa he will consider ^orthographic accented Russian".1 Substitutional models are valid as long as their objects are more or less consistent as analogues with respect to what is modelled. Deviations of a substitute from the ob- ject of examination can be accidental or essential. In the case of accidental deviations, a model retains its general validity. For example, a morphological model which is based on written Russian will correctly state that the genitive singular and the nominative plural of a specific group of nouns are homonymous: the meaning of palki can be represented as, say, {cstick&gt;, 'SING', CGEN'} or as {'stick', CPLUR', CNOM V ACC'}. But the model will incorrectly state the individual instances of this homonymy: it will include reki, meaning {criver', «SING', CGEN'} or { Tiver', CPLUR', CNOM V ACC'}, ignoring the stress difference which distinguishes the two sets of semantic features. This does not fundamentally affect the validity of the model as a whole: although it incorrectly deals with certain individual instances of morphological homonymy, it may treat the essential properties of morphological homonymy correctly. An isolated adjustment of the reality claims of the base compo- nent will improve the model without affecting its other parts. We can, for instance, replace written Russian by accented written Russian. This will result in a correct statement about reki: the meaning of reki will then be classified as {'river', 'SING', 'GEN'} and the meaning of réki as {criver' 'PLUR', CNOM V ACC'}. But accented written Russian will still fail to account for instances of homonymy caused by the neutraliza- tion of post-tonic vowels such as /p'alki/ (written pálki or pálke), which corresponds to any of the sets of semantic features {'stick', 'SING', 'GEN'}, {'stick', 'PLUR', CNOM V ACC'}, {'Stick', 'SING', 'DAT V LOC&gt;}. If, on the other hand, indirect reality claims show essential deviations and are structurally unwarranted, the model is devoid of linguistic interest. A model which is based on punctuation is irrelevant unless a reasonable case can be made for a more or less systematic isomorphism of punctuation and, say, intonation. S 1.5.4 Tentative exemplification of the format The concepts developed in the preceding chapters are informally illustrated below by their application to the terminological problems adduced in § 1.0.5. As this presenta- tion only serves for illustration, the concepts will not be discussed in depth. 1 Morpheme. The difference between the use of morpheme by most European struc- tural linguists and moneme by Martinet and many students of Romance languages can safely be reduced to a difference of labels: the models which are presupposed by Martinet and many European structural linguists reveal no systematic differ- ences in the structure of the models, the positions of morpheme and moneme in the structure of the models, or the reality claims of the models.2 The same seems to apply to Martinet's morpheme and other European structuralists' grammatical mor- pheme. 1 Zaliznjak 1967b (0.4): 9. ¿ Cf. Martinet 1965 (8): 169.</page><page sequence="262">240 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS 2 Paradigm. In most models, this label is used for ordered or unordered sets of words which share a lexical meaning. This implies that in most models the label paradigm carries more or less identical reality claims, even if their theoretical status may vary widely. In Hjelmslev's terminology paradigm is used for a set of elements which can be substituted for each other in a string:1 without reality claims, for a specific slot in a specific model.2 The two uses of the label have little in common and are best treated as accidental homonyms in the metalanguage of linguistics.3 3 Phoneme. In all models which employ this term, from its introduction by the French phonetician A. Dufriche-Desgenettes,4 through its use for abstract units in the Kazan' School in the second half of the 19th century and various brands of struc- turalism, and back to its phonetic basis in contemporary speech technology, the label phoneme has referred to the same object of empirical interest, i.e. has carried the same reality claims. Its intuitive basis is supported by the fact that several early definitions of phoneme', such as the one given by Baudouin de Courtenay in 1895,5 emphasize the psychological status of the concept. Typically, Sapir in 1921 makes an effort to put his finger on the phenomenon of diverging psychological significance of sound distinctions, and on the "inner sound system" of a language which he deduces from the behaviour of his informants,6 but later, after having become acquainted with phoneme1, keenly adopts the concept as a psychological explanation for such behaviour.7 Thus, the models of phoneme1 in the various full models are likely to be con- cerned with the same target concept. The possibility of different phonemic solu- tions for a single language is considered, by those who accept it at all, to be due to a certain looseness of a single conception of phoneme1 rather than to the coexis- tence of various conceptions. On the other hand, the models of phoneme", in terms of initial objects and derivations, diverge considerably between competing full models. The phoneme seems to be a classic focus of efforts to make theory and technology match our metalinguistic intuitions.8 4 Word. The situation for this term may differ from that for phoneme in that the area of empirical interest which may be assumed for word is broader. This does not mean that word is not an intensional label, for which only an assignment space can be determined, but rather that various derivations of word-like concepts may co- exist within a single model. As a consequence, languages are possible which pos- 1 Cf. Hjelmslev 1963: 36; 1968: 42-43. 2 This is not to say that the corresponding concept does not have any reality claims. For the difference between the reality claims of labels and the reality claims of concepts, cf. § 1.4.2. 3 Even though a link can be established between the two concepts. Ebeling [1957 (5): 145] employs Hjelmslev's conception of paradigm' but substitutes the plane of content for that of expression: paradigm indicates the set of potential occupiers of a definable position in the semantic counterpart of a string when the number of elements in this set is restricted. This conception was formalized as semantic paradigm in Van Helden 1979/1993 {2&gt;. 1209, definition (B.12). Thus, wherever semantic paradigms are exemplified for a specific lexical item, we find ordered paradigms of the traditional type. 4 Cf. Ivic, M., 1971 (15.270): 120, footnote 16. 5 Baudouin de Courtenay 1895 [01 9. 6 Sapir 1921 (3): 54-56. 7 Cf.

Van Helden 1979/1993 contains a for- mal definition of 'word' which does not embrace the "words" in agglutinative lan- guages.1 It may be wondered whether the "words" in such languages, to wit lexical morphemes which determine "grids" for affixes in fixed positions, must be yielded by the same definitions as "words" in inflectional languages: perhaps they are yielded by a different derivation. But a derivation must apply to any language. A language like French, where verbs determine a grid for enclitical pronouns and some other items, may turn out to possess both "short words" and "long words" alongside each other. The consequence for the use of linguistic terminology is that a grammar must indicate which non-trivial 'words' a language possesses and which phenomena are described in terms of which 'words'. 1 Van Helden 1979/1993 [21 1209, definitions (B.7), (B.8), and (B.9).</page><page sequence="264">CHAPTER 1.6: COMPARISON AND EVALUATION OF MODELS S 1.6.1 Idealized comparison and evaluation As was pointed out in §0.2, models are treated on various levels. Besides the non-for- mal description of the models, their formalization, and their illustration with linguistic material, three aspects require separate attention: comparison, evaluation and amendment. The present author has not succeeded in maintaining a consistent editorial sepa- ration of these operations. Models are related to each other on various parameters and are valuable for various reasons. Treating each model as a separate construct and applying the complete procedure to it would result in even more redundancy and evident statements than this study already contains. Nevertheless it is expedient to describe an idealized procedure, or checklist, which may be assumed to underlie the presentation of the models, even if not always applied explicitly. The basic attitude which underlies the chosen idealized taxonomy and evaluation procedure results from the aim, which was made explicit in §0.2, of starting out by dealing with the models in their own terms. This implies that a certain effort is made to reconstruct the assumptions and intentions of the authors of the models, and a first- order evaluation of the models consists in relating the performance of the models to those assumptions and intentions. The primary basis of comparison of the models is their internal structure, not their reality claims; the primary touchstone for evaluation of the models is their perform- ance in dealing with linguistic material, not their similarity to some normative linguis- tic theory; the primary proposals for amendment of the models keep the basic as- sumptions and intentions of the authors intact. Only when the exploration of alterna- tive solutions within the basic assumptions and intentions of the original authors pre- sents a clear case against their plausibility and feasibility, will proposals for alterna- tives involve the basic framework.1 The described intention of the present author has produced an idealized taxonomy of models, as well as idealized evaluation and selection procedures. They are de- scribed in this chapter. S 1.6.2 A taxonomy for models Models may coincide and diverge for any of the components which were discussed in the foregoing chapters. Comparison of models is facilitated if they can be classified according to the properties of the components. The taxonomy which is described be- low involves both intensional and extensional criteria. The intensional criteria determine classifications of the set of models. They can be ordered in such a way that each classification is a refinement of the preceding classi- fication. The intensional criterion for grouping models is the similarity of their compo- nents, as applied in the order in which they were presented in § 1.0.9. 1 The disadvantages of the approach chosen, which is the consequence of Russell's injunction quoted in §0.2, were mentioned at the end of §0.15. 242</page><page sequence="265">CHAPTER 1.6: COMPARISON AND EVALUATION OF MODELS 243 1 First, the models are grouped according to their technical connectives. In the pre- sent study, this criterion is not classificatory but only selectional. The present dis- cussion is limited to models that are or can be represented in terms of the technical connectives of Chapter 1.1. 2 As a second basis for classificatioa models can be grouped according to the math- ematical properties of their base components. Within each group, the base compo- nents of the models are identical as to their mathematical structure. The four re- maining parts of the present study by and large correspond to the classes of mod- els which are produced by this classificatioa- in each part a different base compo- nent is considered, usually combined with some minor variants and preceded by other models intended to supply its primitives. Some base components resemble each other more than others: two text-based base components which are identical except for one or two constraints are more closely related to each other than either of them is to a category-based generative base component. Such distances between non-identical base components are as- sessed extensionally: no attempt is made to measure them. 3 Derivations represent a third criterion for grouping models. Models are considered to be more alike when they share more derivations, counting from the base compo- nent. Closely related models only differ in their last derivations: it often happens that two models derive from the same feature system, but one model produces a partition where another model produces a system of tolerance classes. Such pairs of models will of course be grouped together. Note that the application of this criterion depends on the way in which full mod- els are split into modules. Two modules may be regarded as identical when they are considered to be independent models; but they may be far apart when they are treated as series of derivations in full models with different base components. For example, at a certain level of abstraction, feature systems can be regarded as a single model, its base component consisting of a binary relation between a domain and a set of features. On the other hand, feature systems occur as modules in dis- tinct models with widely diverging base components. As models are grouped ac- cording to these more basic base components, feature systems appear repeatedly in the various models presented in this study. 4 Labels are a relatively unimportant basis for grouping. When two models are iden- tical except for the labels of their units, they are grouped as one model. Thus, when a base component L' employs the term segment for a set of units with the same mathematical properties as the words of another base component L2 which is otherwise identical to L't these models are grouped together. In many instances, units with coinciding mathematical properties will receive standardized labels in this study, their relationship with other labels being relegated to a separate dis- cussion. No attempt will be made to provide a systematic grouping of models ac- cording to pre-established types of labels. 5 Finally, the reality claims of the components of the models will be compared. Per- haps the position of reality claims distinguishes the present approach from many other comparisons between linguistic theories: often theories are classified ac-</page><page sequence="266">244 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS cording to the claimed modes of existence of the concepts involved. Since, in the present approach, reality claims of models are the last criterion for grouping, a systematic subgrouping of available models according to types of reality claims will rarely be called for. Thus, inherent similarities and differences are the primary basis for grouping the models presented in these volumes. But, since chronologically contiguous viewpoints tend to bear more resemblance to each other than do distant ones, the actual group- ing and order of presentation of the models to a large extent reflect the order of their appearance. Only a few so-called semantic state models present obvious exceptions, at least from the viewpoint of the taxonomy adopted. They were developed in the ear- liest stage of development of the Set-theoretical School but are only presented in Part 5. § 1.6.3 Internal evaluation criteria: economy The discussion of models presupposes the presence of evaluation criteria. Certain criteria are found time and again in the literature of the period: economy, simplicity, consistency, and adequacy. The first three criteria are internal to the model: they are applicable to its mathematical structure. Adequacy, on the other hand, applies to the relationship between the models and reality. In this section and the following ones, the status of such criteria in the present study will be pointed out. Mel'ouk and Apresjan have provided formal definitions of economy and simplicity. In Mel'ouk's conception, economy relates to the number of elements which a genera- tive device employs to yield a set of linguistic objects: the smaller this number in rela- tion to the number of generated objects, the more economical the model.1 In Apre- sjan's conception, economy is determined by the number of axiomatic, i.e. non-defined, concepts in the base component (constraints are not considered): the smaller the num- ber, the more economical the model.2 Apresjan's version of economy is a modern phrasing of Occam's razor, which bans the redundant use of undefined concepts. Mel'öuk's economy criterion is applicable if no reality claims are maintained for the base component, or if the base component is substitutional. If the base component stands for a generative device which exists in reality, the application of Mel'ouk's economy criterion implies a constraint on reality, to wit the claim that reality achieves ultimate economy: this is not a priori true. Apresjan's economy is more generally applicable: even if the axiomatic concepts stand for aspects of reality, economy may be applied in the sense that a model must not involve aspects of reality other than those necessary for its purpose. Apresjan's economy can also be used as a criterion for the selection of a provi- sional base component of partial models of specific concepts. Here is an example. Consider a fragment Mi of a model M. Fragment Mi is a partial model of 'morpheme1, which contains in its base component, besides other items: 1 a provisional set P of phonemes; 1 Mel'ouk 1962 155-156; 1963a (2): 120. 2 Apresjan 1966 OSk 270; 1971 (5): 269-270; 1973b 15k 308.</page><page sequence="267">CHAPTER 1.6: COMPARISON AND EVALUATION OF MODELS 245 2 a harp //of strings made up by elements of P.1 Consider, furthermore, a fragment M2 of M. Fragment M2 is also a partial model of 'morpheme': its base component is identical to that of Mi, except that 1 and 2 are re- placed by: 1 a provisional set F of distinctive features; 2 a subset P of the power set of F;2 3 a harp //of strings made up by elements of P. If the results of Mi and M2 are regarded as equivalent (i.e. if M2 does not exploit the possibility of assigning concurrent features to different morphemes), model Mi will be preferred in accordance with the economy criterion. But note that the differences between Mi and M2 may be merely notational: the economy principle only guides the identification of more convenient fragments of a hypothetical or existing full model, the ultimate axiomatic primitives of which may not be susceptible to economy as they are guided by assumptions about reality. Also, economy can be overridden by any other criteria. If, for example, Mi and M2 yield different sets of morphemes, the econ- omy criterion cannot decide on the choice between them. The economy criterion may operate in substitutional models. As was pointed out in § 1.5.3, in a model of this type the reality claims of one or more sets and relations do not immediately concern linguistic objects but relate to objects the behaviour of which is presumed to be isomorphic to that of linguistic objects in the respects dealt with by the model. Sometimes, there may be a choice between two or more prospec- tive substitutes. Then the most economical substitute may be selected. Note that the economy criterion is marginal here as well. It does not concern the deductive properties of the model but is applied in order to establish inductive priori- ties. A substitute is only assumed to behave like a linguistic object: the economy cri- terion decides which substitute is the first to be tested in a deductive model against the consequences of this assumption. S 1.6.4 Internal evaluation criteria: simplicity Apresjan's and Mel'ouk's conceptions of simplicity practically coincide: simplicity is determined by the number of rules by which terminal objects are derived from the primary elements.3 For the type of model described in the present volumes, such simplicity applies to the derivations in a model which are used to define a given con- cept: the smaller their number, or the smaller the number of predicates contained in them, the simpler the model. The applicability of the simplicity criterion is overridden by any reality claims for derivations. It can only be applied to choose from among two or more series of auxil- iary derivations4 which are derived from the same base component and are mathemat- 1 Hàrp: % 12.1 2 Power set: S 1.1.3. 3 Mel'euk 1963a (2&gt;. 120; Apresjan 1966 (5h 270-271 (prostota); Apresjan 1971 (51 270 (Einfachheit); 1973b {5k 308.

This type of simplicity is warranted by the mathematical apparatus: counting and weighing derivations of concepts without independent linguistic interest is of no specific concern to linguistics. Thus, economy and simplicity have limited application, the limits being set by the reality claims of the components, which are themselves unaffected by economy and simplicity criteria. As LB. Anderson puts it, "nature may in fact not display that sim- plicity and Occam's razor cannot decide a factual question".1 Models are assumed to be satisfactory if they possess the maximum mathematically possible economy and simplicity which the reality claims allow, so no degrees of these properties will have to be considered. The models as actually presented in these volumes, however, will not always be simple. There are two reasons for this. In the first place, mathematical simplicity is an art in itself; in the second place, it is sometimes expedient to present a concept in a larger number of derivations than is technically necessary, in order to demonstrate structural resemblances between models. S 1.6.5 Internal evaluation criteria: consistency Consistency is the major internal criterion in evaluating a model: a model must not contain any contradictions. At the same time this criterion is so self-evident that little has to be said about it. The technical connectives and their combination rules should guarantee consistency: the pursuit of consistency is the official motive for introducing mathematics at all into the humanities. S 1.6.6 Adequacy of derivations as an external evaluation criterion Adequacy is a diffuse criterion, as it pertains to the correspondences between a model and reality: there are many conceivable points of such correspondence. Mel'ouk and Apresjan consider adequacy iadekvatnostX and its complement com- prehensiveness (polnotá, Vollständigkeit), to relate to the degree in which the rules of a model predict observable facts: a model is maximally comprehensive when it yields all observable objects in a target set, and maximally adequate when it yields no ob- jects which do not belong to the target set.2 This conception works well in calculus models when the type of observable fact is agreed upon, such as the set of grammati- cal sentences in a generative model; but it does not seem to be exhaustive for rela- tional or algorithmic models, where derivations do not pretend to correspond to ob- servable primary data. It is probably most useful for the class of models of specific concepts, which can be regarded as observable secondary data.3 In such models the adequacy of specific derivations can be established. 1 Anderson, L.B., 1971 [4h 7, 9. (LB. Anderson here dismisses simplicity and economy as arguments for assigning the same mathematical specifications to surface structures and (semantic) deep structures.) * Cf.

This type of adequacy applies to models for which a target concept is indicated. The model can be applied to bodies of observed linguistic facts, or to abstract constructions which are agreed to represent linguistic facts. As a result, the label of the target concept is assigned to parts of the observed objects. If the way in which the model assigns the label is experienced as counterintuitive, which may, but does not necessarily, imply that it is countertraditional as well, the model falls short of its own objectives and must be qualified as inadequate. This renders the assessment of the adequacy of the derivation of a target concept conditional on concurrence among the investigators as to: a the body of facts; b the conviction that relevant facts not considered will not produce (new) inade- quacy; c the assumption of convergent intuitions. Absolute adequacy of a derivation cannot be proved but inadequacy can be demonstrated. Thus, for a model which intends to make explicit the notion of case, it is exam- ined whether there is a possible language for which the model produces counterin- tuitive results. If there is such a language, the model is inadequate as a model of the target concept. 2 The adequacy of a derivation not intended to assign to the defined concept an ex- isting label possessing reality claims is assessed in a similar manner. The results of its application to bodies of linguistic facts are screened for empirical interest: if they yield categories which can be used in making statements on a language which are experienced as informative, they are adequate. Thus, if, for an inadequate model of case1, the label case is replaced or reality claims for it are dropped, the same model may retain general adequacy. One of the important ways in which intuition is used in "falsifying" derivations is by application of the intuitive consistency criterion,1 which is distinct from the mathe- matical consistency which was discussed in § 1.6.5. Intuitive consistency implies that a model does not provide divergent treatments for phenomena which are intuitively ex- perienced as belonging together. A model of a category which produces some of the genders of a language but not all of them is likely to be rejected for lack of intuitive consistency. S 1.6.7 A normative conception of modelling The type of adequacy identified in the foregoing section correspond to observational adequacy (viz. when derivations are confronted with observed facts) or descriptive adequacy (viz. when derivations are assumed to be confronted with observable facts) of a generative grammar.2 But, like the latter concepts, the above type of adequacy does not exhaust the the yardsticks against which models must be evaluated. Corre- 1 Cf. §1.3.7. 2 Cf.

Here we face the problem that the reality claims of models vary and consequently inhibit their relative evaluation. Consider two models Mi and M2, which are struc- turally identical; reality claims are expressed for a specific component Xi of Mi but not for the corresponding component X2 of M2. If such reality claims are contradicted by observations, then Mi would be valued less than M2. This would lead to the conclu- sion that models without reality claims are maximally satisfactory, as they cannot be contradicted by observed reality. In such a situation, models cannot be evaluated against each other. It therefore seems inevitable that models, whatever their intrinsic criteria for adequacy, must be subjected to some additional, general criteria. Such criteria must reflect the properties of ideal or standard models. A set of evaluation criteria of this kind represents a normative conception of linguistic modelling. Thus far, a non-normative, descriptive, approach to linguistic modelling has been operating: a common denominator was sought for all things which are presented as linguistic models. Thus, a deliberately vague definition of model was presented in §1.0.2, whereby models are supposed to contain answers to K-questions. Strong and weak K-questions were distinguished in § 1.4.3, depending on the (intensional or ex- tensional) status of the labels involved in the K-questions. But the status of the very concepts was not discussed. The status of concepts depends on the conception of modelling which is used, i.e. the opinion of the investigator as to what a model must be or do. Such a normative conception is vulnerable, and the sketch which is outlined below is only preliminary and tentative; but if models are to be evaluated, one cannot dispense with a touch- stone of some kind. As to what a model "does" or "is", three possibilities are posited. 1 Models establish the universal units and categories of language, their properties and mutual relationships and dependencies; or they provide a procedure by which such units, properties, relations and dependencies can be established. 2 Models either identify, for any possible language, the instances of the units which are established by models of type 1; or they provide a procedure for doing so. 3 Models either specify, for each existing language, all units which can be identified by models of type 2; or they provide a procedure to do so. Thus, a model of type 1 tells us, say, what a sentence is and why a language has sen- tences; a model of type 2 tells us, say, how to distinguish sentences in any languages which we may come across; a model of type 3 tells us, say, which are the sentences of a specific language. These three types of models correspond to the three reality claims mentioned for the technical connectives in § 1.1.28. In type 1 models, the technical connectives are interpreted as relators; in type 2 models, they are interpreted as functors; and in type 3 models, they are interpreted as permissions. In other words, type 1 is proposed as normative for relational models; type 2 is proposed as normative for algorithmic mod- els, while type 3 is proposed as normative for calculus models.</page><page sequence="271">CHAPTER 1.6: COMPARISON AND EVALUATION OF MODELS 249 § 1.6.8 Revzin's universal conception of modelling The above distinctions elicit the tempting hypothesis that linguistics can make do with only one normative model, which belongs to type 1, 2 or 3, depending on the interpre- tation of its technical connectives, and is simultaneously adequate in all three inter- pretations. The ideal model would use the same mathematical structures and labels for all three functions. It is not unlikely that it was this (implicit) hypothesis which made it so easy for Revzin to change his conception of modelling without changing his models. His 1962a description of linguistic modelling obviously refers to type 1 models: [...] a certain minimal quantity of primary indefinable terms is established, and all the rest of the terms are defined by means of the primary ones. At the same time certain primary statements as to the con- nections between these terms (axioms) should be clearly formulated and all other statements should be proved, i.e. reduced to certain other statements.1 A model in this sense is not a part of language as a system but itself represents a certain hypothetical construction [postroenie' a certain construct [konstrukt2 But in 1967, Revzin adheres to the "cybernetic" conception of modelling. Here a model is a physical construction, or a system of symbols which imitates (or maps imitations of) certain physical processes. Revzin distinguishes three types of models. His first type contains cybernetic models in the narrow sense. They are mappings of speech activity. Revzin distinguishes (non-generative) synthetic models, which map record- ings of situations in reality onto phrases, and analytic models, which map phrases onto recordings of situations in reality.3 Models of this type eventually evolved into Mel'ouk's and Zolkovskij's meaning &lt;=&gt; text models.4 They are not immediately rele- vant to the present study, because they do not directly contribute to answering K- questions: the mappings are formal constructs of Srejder's first level:5 representations of the complex objects which are the objects of description of the formal language of linguistic description in which categories are defined. Revzin's third type of model corresponds to the previous section's type 2 models: *[...] the input is a collection of facts, [...] viz. words and their meanings [signification, znaöenie' and phrases and their senses [sens, smysl ]. The output consists of specific morphological and syntactic cat- egories.^ Revzin regards models of this type, which he considers his primary concern, as for- malizing the research activity of the linguist.7 They should, in his opinion, precede, and serve the interest of, the construction of "synthetic generative models". The lat- ter, his second, type corresponds to type 3 of the present section: the sentences, called phrases by Revzin, which are produced by a generative grammar of the Chom- skian type, are units (of competence) and not substance (as may be the status of ut- terances, which belong to performance). 1 Revzin 1966b (1.1): 3; 1962a (1.1): 8. 2 Revzin 1966b (1.2): 4; 1962a (1.2): 9. 3 Revzin 1967b (1.4): 25, 1969a {2&gt;. 28-29.

Moreover, they produce the basic categories in the rules of synthetic models: ideally, reversing a type 2 model produces (a fragment of) a corresponding type 3 model. Revzin's interesting hypothesis will not be used in this study. Instead, a normative implicational hierarchy is assumed for the three types of model. A type 3 calculus model presupposes a type 2 algorithmic model: a set of linguistic objects can only be specified when the objects can be identified. One must be able to see a sentence be- fore one can meaningfully specify the set of sentences. In turn, a type 2 algorithmic model presupposes a type 1 relational model: an object can only be identified when its relevant properties are known. One must know what a sentence is like before it can be identified as such. This implicational hierarchy suggests that generative models represent the ulti- mate model: they specify sets of well-defined identifiable objects. At the same time, generative models can be constructed only when the relevant properties of the ob- jects specified have been made explicit. The definition of a sentence precedes the specification of the set of sentences. This renders generative models in a certain sense Utopian in that they take sentences for granted, i.e. in that it is implied for those models that sentences are agreed upon as the only linguistic units worth specifying, and in that the defining properties of sentences are considered obvious. The hierarchy view classifies abstract models as primary, and process models as secondary. This is in accordance with a conception of models as deductive systems: the consequences of a given hypothesis can be determined and are open to falsifica- tion. A deductive hierarchy runs from definition via identification to specification. Each stage has its own, intuition-based falsification criteria and allows recursive de- vices to deal with infinite sets: for type 1 models, a finite base component determines a possibly infinite set of derivations (of units and categories); for type 2 models, a fi- nite procedure can be repeated an infinite number of times;1 while for type 3 models, a finite set of rules can characterize an infinite number of units by means of recursive rules. The secondary status of cybernetic or process modelling was pointed out by Srejder,2 who consequently deplores Revzin's switch described above.3 In the same paper, Srejder dispenses for this reason with the necessity of operating with sub- stance-based data, which had been the official practice of cybernetically-oriented linguists. 1 Cf. §1.2.16. 2 Srejder 1973c: 257-258; 1973b: 75-76. The cited passage contains a sentence the purport of which is ob- scured in the English translation (1973c: 258, line 9ff.). A more correct translation is: miis secondary status [vtorionosf; not duplicity] of modelsx is very often concealed in cybernetics; in this manner, the conclusions obtained on the basis of the behaviour of a modelK assume [not assumes] a greater emotional convincingness than they actually deserve [togo zasluiivahit; not cost 3 Srejder 1973c: 246; 1973b 67-68.</page><page sequence="273">CHAPTER 1.6: COMPARISON AND EVALUATION OF MODELS 251 Sometimes a formal description is taken to mean a ban on using information in the description that is not directly and formally extracted from the text. Violating this prohibitioa however, does not at all necessarily destroy the formal precision of the linguistic descriptions. * The assumption of the deductive hierarchy of models enables us to deal with all mod- els as type 1 models, and to consider the other types as their subtypes. Since type 1 models are primary as answers to K-questions, this study will basically treat all mod- els as such. The normative properties by which the models presented in these volumes are evaluated are the properties of relational models. S 1.6.9 Normative reality claims for the components of a model The normative reality claims which will be ascribed to the respective components of all models in this study are indicated below. 1 The normative technical connectives are relational. Algorithmic and calculus models are read as relational models, in accordance with the secondary status which has been assigned to them in the preceding section. Treating all models in this study as relational will do some injustice to models which their authors obiously intended as algorithms, as a result of which the models were subjected to unneces- sary limitations on the base component, such as requiring finite sets. Wherever such issues are in order, they will be discussed. But operating with finite sets will not be viewed as a major virtue of the model. 2 The normative base component is a theory of language in Srejder's sense.2 It is an intensional framework which specifies all objects claimed to be possible languages and excludes those which cannot be possible languages. The application of this norm is hampered by the fact that most models in this study are considered to be modules, with provisional base components. Thus, instead of being a theory of lan- guage, a base component is often only claimed to be derivable from a theory of language. The reality claims of the theory should not relate to intuitional categories, be- cause they must be open, through their derivations, to falsification by intuition. In the opinion of the present writer, the categories which are explicitly stated to be defining properties of language in a base component should be determined by the postulated function of language as a semiotic system. The primary objective of some models is to classify specific data of specific lan- guages. It will be somewhat unfair to treat their base components as theories. Such situations will be discussed when they occur. 3 The normative development component is a deductive system which calculates the existence and structure of objects, given the existence and structure of the ob- jects in the base component. The derivations are the instruments by which theories can be falsified. Models for the labels of which no reality claims are expressed are rejected if none of their derivations represents empirical interest. If no empirically interesting concepts can be derived from a base component, it is likely to be a bad theory of language. 1 Sreider 1973c: 260; 1973b: 77. 2 Cf. §1.2.1.</page><page sequence="274">252 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS 4 With the exception of some of Marcus1 models, the models in this study do not use extensional labels with reality claims. Such cases will be discussed as they occur, while the question of norms for extensional labels, which was touched upon in § 1.4.3, will be returned to at the end of this study.1 The adequacy of the intensional labels of a model will be evaluated as described in §1.6.6. § 1.6.10 Evaluating substitutional and provisional base components The reliability of substitutional models deserves attention as a separate point of eval- uation. The normative properties of indirect reality claims are similar to those of di- rect reality claims, which were described in the preceding section. If a theory is re- jected on intuitional grounds, this may not be due to the theory, which refers to the substitute objects, but to the assumption that the substitute can replace the original object of examination: possibly the intuitions which motivate the rejection of the the- ory do not relate to the substitutes but to the original objects. Thus, models of linguis- tic categories which are based on manifestations of language in its written form risk producing counterintuitive results, due to the neglect of intonation patterns. Similarly, partial models entail additional handicaps. The application of the norma- tive base component is hampered by the fact that most models in these volumes are considered to be modules, with provisional base components. Instead of being a the- ory of language, a base component often only claims to be derivable from a theory of language. The rejection of a base component may only concern the selection of the provisional objects in it, not the theory on which the model is eventually based. This circumstance reduces the rigour of the discussions on the choice of a base compo- nent. Most discussions will not focus on the feasibility of a base component as a the- ory, but on the likelihood of the derivability of the base component from a non-formal- ized or even unspecified theory, or on the expediency of the selection of the base component from a range of possible concepts whose derivability from a theory is considered plausible. 5 1.6.11 An evaluation procedure The norms described in the preceding sections can be applied in an idealized evalua- tion procedure. As the application of all parts of such a procedure would produce much repetition and self-evident statements, the procedure which is sketched below will usually be applied implicitly. Each model must be checked for consistency. This part of the procedure is only emphasized when obvious instances of inconsistency have been detected. The same applies to economy and simplicity. Any amendments in this field proceed from mathe- matical considerations. The evaluation of external criteria proceeds inductively by testing out interpreta- tions of the models: a model is interpreted when a fixed value is given to the variables of the theory, i.e. any value within the limits set by the constraints. Since the base 1 Viz. in §5.72.</page><page sequence="275">CHAPTER 1.6: COMPARISON AND EVALUATION OF MODELS 253 component specifies all possible languages, any relational system which is obtained in this way must be a possible language. After the assigning of the fixed values, the values of the derived objects are calcu- lated and the results are screened on their general or specific empirical interest. If the results contradict intuition, the model is rejected. It is convenient to exemplify, clarify and discuss a theory by fixing values in the base component in a way which makes them correspond to (fragments of) existing lan- guages: it is not usually possible to check all values which are admitted by the theory (their number may be infinite) and, if it turns out that a model is rejected on the evi- dence of existing languages, there is no reason to test it on hypothetical languages. The fact that the number of possible values of some variables may be infinite implies that models usually can only be rejected by the evaluation procedure: they cannot be corroborated. S 1.6.12 Amendments A rejected model is not useless but an interesting object for modification: a part of the model is replaced or altered, which produces another, similar model to be evaluated. The second model is an amendment of the first model. This section contains a broad outline of a procedure for checking amendments, which has been the general, though implicit, practice of the Set-theoretical School. As a consequence of the effort, which was announced in the introduction of the present study, to deal with the models from inside, i.e. not to reject them on account of alien criteria, the last thing to be replaced or altered is the base component, the the- ory. The base component can only be altered if a reasonable case can be made for the impossibility of constructing useful derivations. It is the present writer's ambition to convince the reader that the four remaining parts of the present study more or less exhaust the feasible options offered by their respective base components. When amending derivations, the final derivation is the first to be taken into consid- eration. It is checked whether the addition of derivations will provide a more accept- able model. Also, it is checked whether changing the mathematical composition of the defined object will help. In much of the work of the Set-theoretical School, a certain order for testing derivations for empirical interest is implicitly applied: 1 First it is examined whether a partition of a set of units yields satisfactory results. 2 When partitions fail, possible systems of tolerance classes are explored. 3 When no synthetic feature systems yield satisfactory results, new sets of units are defined. If such minor amendments do not help, other types of derivation are developed and tested. If they are not satisfactory, the penultimate derivation is revised according to the same procedure, thus allowing the whole of the original system of derivations to be revised down to the base component. Before the above procedure is commenced, the labels of the final derivation and their base components can be considered. It may be expedient, for example, to signal instances where a model is rejected as a model for case' but nevertheless retains a</page><page sequence="276">254 PART 1: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS general empirical interest, or is covered by another area of empirical interest, say that of 'gender1. The hierarchy used for checking amendments corresponds to the taxonomy of the presentation of models given in § 1.6.2. It groups families of emended models together and enables the present author to add his own amendments in an organic manner. Such amendments will be proposed and tested wherever they can illustrate a potential of certain types of models which was left unexplored by the original authors. It is, of course, usually impossible to check all possible amendments to a model. This would imply checking all thinkable models, because all models are distantly re- lated in the taxonomy. In most cases, the present writer will be able to provide spe- cific reasons why further checking of a type of model is not necessary. S 1.6.13 Selection of models The selection of the models in these volumes is determined by historical criteria. This does not mean that the models simply represent the linguistic output which corre- sponds to a slice of time, but that historic relationships are assumed to unite the group. These relationships are: 1 thematic: the models deal with related problems; 2 methodological: they employ similar methods to deal with the problems; 3 personal: the models were produced by a group of people who exchanged ideas and opinions. The historic relationships produce a fuzzy set which necessitates further delimitation by the introduction of some explicit criteria. The models which are presented in this study have been collected due to their possessing one or more of the following prop- erties. 1 The target concepts of the models are case' and 'gender', i.e. the corresponding la- bels are attached to their final derivations. 2 The target concepts of the models are related to 'case' and 'gender' in traditional grammar. The derivations of animacy in Chapter 3.2 are a case in point. 3 The models yield new concepts but are structurally related to those which model "case1 and gender*. Examples are Zaliznjak's agreement classes and all classes which are produced in Kulaginafs model in Chapter 3.2. 4 The models yield concepts which are part of the provisional base components of partial models of case' and 'gender'. The models of 'word' in Chapter 2.1 and of de- pendency structure in Chapter 4. 1 are examples. When the work on this book commenced in the late 1970s, no chronological delimita- tion seemed to be necessary. The external circumstances described in §0.12 inhibited further work in the vein of the Set-theoretical School. But at present it must be noted that, due to the external circumstances in which the present book has been written, Mel'ouk's work of the eighties, some of which can be regarded as an expansion of the ideas of the Set-theoretical School, does not receive full attention. This omission can only be justified by the time of appearance of Mel'ouk's work. His 1986 definition of 'case' will be briefly discussed in §5.59ff. but his 1988 book, although affecting various</page><page sequence="277">CHAPTER 1.6: COMPARISON AND EVALUATION OF MODELS 255 issues featured in the present study, must be left out of consideration, with the ex- ception of a few brief remarks.1 S 1.6.14 Order of presentation The order of presentation is determined by the principle of increasing linguistic so- phistication. The advantages of this order are the following. 1 It enables a natural narrative structure. 2 The reader becomes gradually acquainted with the method and is not immediately confronted with large quantities of unfamiliar terms and tricks. 3 The order of increasing sophistication to a considerable extent reflects the histor- ical development of the Set-theoretical School, at least to the extent the chronol- ogy of the relevant events can be reconstructed. At the same time, the principle chosen makes the significant divergences between historical development and in- creasing linguistic sophistication stand out. The chosen taxonomy, evaluation procedure, and principle for ordering the models will make the base components of each of the following parts look more like a real theory of language. 1 E.g. in §4.2.6 and §4.4.27.</page><page sequence="278">PART 2: STRING MODELS CHAPTER 2.0: INTRODUCTION S 2.0.1 Types and tokens In linear structures Part 2 discusses the models of morphosyntactic categories derived from the simplest base component by the Set-theoretical School. In the present chapter, this base com- ponent will be described, and its theoretical backgrounds expounded. Chapter 2.1 treats three models purporting to derive the elements of the base component from more primitive concepts. Chapter 2.2 discusses proto-models of gender' that are based on this base component; Chapter 2.3 correspondingly discusses proto-models of case1. The simplest base components of set-theoretical modelling are founded on two views, which are discussed in this section: 1 language is, like other sign systems, a system of types and tokens; 2 tokens occur in strings. A type in a sign system is a set (bundle) of features:1 for instance, 'round', red", 'pos- sesses a white horizontal beam' are features of the international system of traffic signs. A token is an object of a less abstract nature which is characterized by the features which make up a type, such as a traffic sign with the aforenamed features. In this study the term occurrence is used as a synonym of token. Not every feature is part of a bundle which makes up a type: within certain limits, the size of a traffic sign is not a feature of a traffic sign. Not every bundle of features is a type: some combinations of traffic sign features are not foud in operative traffic signs. On the other hand, not every object which carries the features is a token: a traffic sign which is stocked in a factory warehouse is not a token. An entity of a sign system is only determined if it is defined, or given, in two manners: 1 internally: a definition must state how the entity is made up as a type, i.e. which features and combinations of features belong, or can belong, to the system; 2 externally: a definition must state how an entity functions as a token, i.e. in which circumstances, combinations, structures or contexts2 the entity is or can be used. The distinction between internal and external determination of entities has often been made in linguistics. The glossematician Togeby employs the term synthetic where this study employs internal and analytic where this study uses external3 The Firthian lin- guist Haas employs the terms synthetic and analytic in exactly the opposite way, viz. for this study's external and internal respectively.4 In Haas' example, the English word top is analytically (i.e. internally) defined as an ordered sequence of phonemes /t/, /o/ and /p/, and synthetically (externally) as a constituent in sentences such as: (2/0/1/1) He climbed to the top. (2/0/1/2) the top of the milk 1 Features cf. S1.1.21. 2 In the sense of, e.g., Dixon 1963 (1.2): 27ff. 3 E.g.

Paradigmatic relations hold between signs which may occur in the same circumstances: they may be instrumental in the internal determination of the sign. The fact that on may replace of in (2/0/1/2) determines a specific type of paradigmatic relation betwen on and of, which may contribute to the internal determi- nation of of. Syntagmatic relations assume networks of specifiable relations in which a given type may occur. Of in (2/0/1/2) enters into specific syntagmatic relations with top and milk, which may contribute to its external determination.) Sign systems may be made up of signs of other sign systems: the tokens of entities of one level can make up types of entities of other levels. This implies that features can characterize objects which are features themselves. Thus, in the examples of § 1.3.6, letters are regarded as types the corresponding tokens of which occur in words; words are in turn regarded as types (characterized by their orthographical composition) that occur as tokens in sentences. In many models, the structures that provide the framework in which types can oc- cur as tokens, are linear. In the above example, a linear sequence of words makes up a sentence. Linear structure is by no means imperative for type-token systems: Srejder has provided a format for texts which accommodates non-linear structures as well as strings.2 We shall see that linearity is abandoned in later set-theoretical mod- els. But it has long seemed natural to consider linear order of elements a prerequisite for linguistic theory in view of the apparent physical restrictions on natural language (or rather speech): it disposes of a single vocal organ, which can only operate along the time axis. In a great deal of theoretical linguistics, types are identified with the elements of a finite alphabet or lexicon, while tokens are identified with their occurrences in strings, i.e. phrases or sentences. The internal aspects of the sign system, i.e. the properties of the tokens which relate them to the corresponding types, are generally taken for granted. This approach is aided by the fact that the empirical linguistic ma- terial appears to theoretical linguists in a highly standardized form, either written or digitalizeà the identification of one occurrence of the with another occurrence of the seems trivial. The base component of the models discussed in Part 2 contains one set of types occurring in a given set of linear structures: its reality claims imply a theory which regards the relation of linear order as a basic property of language as far as the rel- evant K-questions are concerned. § 2.0.2 The base component of alphabet-harp models Technically, the base component of Part 2 contains a set of entities which is consid- ered determined, both internally and externally. A relational system or set of rela- tional systems fli is regarded as given, 1 E.g. in Lyons 1968 (2.3.3-2.3.4): 75-76. 2 Cf. Srejder's [1971b {7.2h 199f.] syntactic scheme, which essentially coincides with Tarski's conception of model1.</page><page sequence="280">258 PART 2 STRING MODELS fl!=(W,fl) (2.0.2.1) where fli is the base component in question, W is a set (alphabet) of types and H is a harp, i.e. a set of strings, over W:1 it contains sequences which are made up of tokens of the types in W. Here is an example. Consider W={a,b} (2.0.2.2) where a and b stand for the sets of features which identify the characters a and b. Then the ordered set (a, b, a) (2.0.2.3) is a string over W (where the first and the third entries are tokens of the same type). As an alternative denotational system, a string can be denoted as a set of pairs, each of which consists of an element of W and a positive integer, which is interpreted as a position in the string. Thus, (2.0.2.3) can also be denoted as {{a,l}, {a, 3}, {b,2}} (2.0.2.4) This denotation will be used in §4.1.23ff. Any alphabet W determines the (infinite) set //*(W) of all (finite) strings over W. Set //*(W) is called the free monoid generated by W; it includes the unique empty string, which will be indicated by X in these volumes.2 It follows that any set of (finite) strings over alphabet W is a subset of the free monoid of W, i.e. //c/T(W) (2.0.2.5) for any value of H. It is nearly always implicitly understood that, for all elements w of W, there is at least one string in H which contains an occurrence of u&gt;, i.e. there is no element of W with zero distribution.3 This assumption is made in this study also. § 2.0.3 Reality claims for the alphabet: isomorphism of linguistic lev- els Some interesting reality claims have been made for the concepts in the alphabet-harp base component. If W is interpreted as the set of phonemes, fli serves as a foundation for phonological modelling; interpretations of W as sets of morphemes and words are used in morphological and syntactic models. Thus, the alphabet-harp base component is regarded as a recurrent provisional base component for different linguistic levels. The opinion that identical mathematical structures can have reality claims for different linguistic levels has been expressed with respect to phonology and morphology by Ivanov.4 Revzin identifies the idea with 1 The term harp was provisionally introduced in § 1.2.1. It will be returned to in the following sections. 2 The mathematical aspects of the concepts of free monoid and empty string are discussed in various sources, including Hockett 1966/1967 (2.0): 54ff., Gross 1972 (1.23): 15ff., and Gladkij 1973c (priloienie II; l&gt;. 315ff. 3 This assumption is rarely made explicit.

In East European linguistics it was implicitly explored by Jakobson when he applied the properties of Trubeckoj's features (e.g. privativity) in morphology.2 The term iso- morphism itself was introduced by Kurytowicz;3 the chief sceptic of the validity of the concept was probably Martinet.4 As to the Set-theoretical School, Marcus subscribes to isomorphism when he con- cludes that ^'abstract sound1 and '[morphological] paradigm' admit the same logical model".5 Revzin, on the other hand, places himself in opposition to Ivanov when he concludes his discussion of isomorphism saying that it cannot be taken as an initial hypothesis.6 But he continues to practise isomorphism by constructing his phonologi- cal and morphological models on identical base components.7 The amount of attention which has been paid to the parallelism between phonology and morphosyntax is in contrast with the relative lack of attention, in the Set-theoret- ical School, to the connection between the two levels. They are usually treated as en- tirely independent manifestations of language: generally, both phonological and mor- phological models have separate (provisional) base components and neither type has provided derivations which can serve as a base component for the other type. Few have viewed phonological models and morphological models as modules in one full model. This is to be regretted in view of the risk of incompatibility and circularity which exists for partial models.8 § 2.0.4 An alphabet of sounds There are a few exceptions to the last statement of §2.0.3. Three models have been developed which provide definitions of the concept of word. In these models, which are discussed in Chapter 2.1, the elements of the alphabet are to be interpreted as sounds, or as some abstraction of sounds. S 2.0.5 An alphabet of words The reality claims of the basic collection of alphabet-harp models of morphological concepts which are to be reviewed in this part (Chapter 2.2 and Chapter 2.3) concern the linguistic notion of word. The notion of morpheme is secondary, and is derived from 'word' in models where 'word' is internally determined as a sequence of phonemes which can be divided.9 The choice of words as basic units is motivated by Revzin. His arguments have a bearing on the heuristic view of modelling: words are easier to pinpoint in the speech 1 Revzin 1966b (3.26): 72ff. 2 E.g.

In later models, even when the heuristic view of modelling was relaxed, "word1 continues to be the fundamental unit in nearly all morphological models. As was pointed out in § 1.5.1, different statuses can be assumed for parts of the base component. For instance, W can be a real primitive of a full model. In that case, the assumption that it can be reduced to more primitive units is not made. This seems to be the most common situation in set-theoretical modelling. In a few instances, words are considered to be derived units. This qualifies the models as partial models. But models which actually provide derivations of W are rare. Among the latter we find substitut ional models,1 which define words as sequences of letters between spaces: the investigator hopes that such sequences behave like words. Finally, there are three models of 'word1, which are discussed in detail in Chapter 2.1. S 2.0.6 Reality claims for the set of strings Base component R' contains, besides an alphabet, a set of strings over the alphabet. Some investigators call any subset of //*(W) a language over W.2 Hockett points out that it is important to distinguish between arbitrary sets of strings and the actual sets of strings which make up the texts of a natural language. He proposes to avoid any linguistic reality claims for a technical term of the metalanguage: An ironclad conclusion about a certain set of languages' (in the formal sense) can be mistaken for a dis- covery about real human language. It seems better to avoid this danger. [...] Limpid clarity about the dis- tinction between the formal and the empirical is important enough to make up for a minor (and perhaps overly cute) terminological innovation.3 Hockett's innovation is the introduction of the term harp for an arbitrary set of strings over W. In the present study a technical term that is not charged with any lin- guistic reality claims is needed. Therefore Hockett's proposal is adopted. The term language would be ambiguous here anyway: it would refer to fli as well as L The question whether just any harp over an alphabet of words or phonemes is in fact a linguistically relevant object is a matter of dispute: its answer depends on one's view of modelling and one's view of language. If the base component is considered extensional, i.e. if H is a variable which can take a only a limited number of values (the sentences of Russian, the sentences of English, etc.), conflation of the concepts of harp and set of sentences is permissible. If, on the other hand, the base component is intensional, the investigator must decide whether his theory of language actually cov- ers all possible subsets of //*(W); if this is not the case, then fli can only be consid- ered a part of a theory of language, and H can only refer to a harp. Grammatical cat- egories which are derived from such harps, such as case, are no more linguistic than is tiarp1: they are pure mathematical constructs. Thus, for intensional models which accept harps as an intensional definition of lan- guage, it must be assumed that they accept any values of the derived grammatical categories as specimens of those categories. 1 Cf. §1.5.3. 2 E.g. Marcus [1967c (1.28): 27], who calls any subset of tfiW) a language {langage) over W and //*(W) the universal language over W. d Hockett 1966/1967 (2.0): 57.</page><page sequence="283">CHAPTER 2.0: INTRODUCTION 26 1 S 2.0.7 A harp of phrases A similar terminological problem arises for the elements of a harp H. Many terms have been employed to indicate them. Nouns such as sequence, chain, train,1 (cepoõka, kor- tei7) or phrase3 have been combined with adjectives such as permissible4 {admitted, permis,5 dopustimyj6), registered7 (attested, repéré6), marked9 {marqué,10 otme- õennyj11) and grammatical12 {grammatically correct13). In this study the term string will be used to indicate elements of H*(W): it may also refer to elements of its subset H wherever it is not essential that they belong to H, or the context makes clear that elements of H are referred to. Moreover, strings of sounds can be referred to as sound sequences in Chapter 2.1. Following Revzin 1967b, the term phrase {f raza) will be used to refer to a string of words which belongs to H.14 A phrase usually corre- sponds to what is called a sentence in various branches of Western linguistics. The latter term is avoided here in view of the specific connotations (structure, complete- ness of thought, intonational properties) which it carries in various approaches; more- over, the Set-theoretical School employs the term sentence (as far as it translates predloZenie) for a subset of phrases with specific properties.15 The term sentence will however be used in the general discourse in these volumes, i.e. when reference to the elements of H (or its successors) is avoided. Sometimes, phrase will be used to refer to fragments of a sentence which enjoy a certain degree of independence, thus corresponding to Bloomfield's 'phrase as a non- minimal free form.16 In so far as this variable usage only affects the examples, it has no theoretical significance: parts of phrases are sometimes sufficient to illustrate a phenomenon. The concept of (marked) phrase has given rise to discussion and debate in the Set- theoretical School on three topics, which are expounded here in short. 1 The first topic is the mathematical legitimacy of the set of marked phrases. The set of phrases of a language is usually considered essentially infinite. This entails a problem if it is to be subject to physical processing, say by machines. The problem was discussed in § 1.2.16, where it was argued that: a the problem can be ignored for relational models; 1 E.g. Kulagina I960: 228. 2 E.g. Kulagina 1958: 203. 3 Cf. DobruSin 1961 (prilozenie): 53. 4 E.g. in Revzin 1966b. 5 E.g. Marcus 1967c (3.9): 83. 6 E.g. Dobrusin 1961 (orilozenie): 54: Revzin 1962a. 7 E.g. Revzin 1966b (3.21): 56-58. 8 E.g. Revzin 1968 (1.2): 5, Marcus 1963e: 269. 9 E.g. Kulagina I960: 228, Marcus 1967a. 10 E.g. Revzin 1968 {12}. 5. 11 E.g. Kulagina 1958: 203, Revzin 1962a, Marcus 1963e: 269, Marcus 1970. 12 E.g. Kiefer 1968. 13 E.g. Revzin 1966b (3.19): 51. 14 Revzin proposes this convention in 1967b (3.17): 65. In older work, such as Kulagina 1960 and 1958, phrase and /rasa are used as a synonym of string. 15 See §4.1.13. 16 Bloomfield 1926/19664 (3): 27.</page><page sequence="284">262 PART 2: STRING MODELS b the problem does not occur for calculus models as long as the set of phrases is regarded as the output of a grammar (i.e. of a finite set of rules); c for algorithmic models, the infinity of the set of phrases can be replaced by the infinity of the procedure. In the last case, it is assumed that the differences between consecutive analyses on the basis of expanding finite sets of phrases will soon approach zero, or ap- proach the rate of diachronic linguistic change. The word "soon" is feasible here as the intuition of the investigating linguist will influence the order in which phrases are added to H. 2 A second discussion has evolved around the exact interpretation of permissibility: given a set of arbitrary strings, what makes each of them grammatical (or marked, or permissible) or ungrammatical? The colourful-green-ideas discussion has run along the same lines as in the West, and has also resulted in poems, round games and different degrees and types of correctness for phrases.1 The discussion has produced one original idea, which will be described in §2.0.9. The problem has re- mained essentially unresolved: §2.0.10 describes how the Set-theoretical School deals with it. 3 A third discussion involved the diagnostic power of phrases. This will be explained in the following section. § 2.0.8 Diagnostic phrases and Z-phrases Models with a fli base component deal mainly with the occurrence of words in con- texts and the behaviour of contexts as environments for words. Intuitively, there is a wide range of interpretations for the concept of context, while interpretations are felt to diverge in their empirical interest. For instance, adjectives with their endings seem to yield functional contexts in bringing to light an empirically interesting lin- guistic reflection of the sex distinction in Russian: (2/0/8/1) mâlenTcijmal'Clk 'little boy' (2/0/8/2) málen'kaja dévoõka 'little girl' Thus, certain phrases containing forms of adjectives such as málen'kij ('little', 'small') have diagnostic power1 with respect to gender1 or whatever label is used for the dis- parate syntactic behaviour of mál'dik Cboy') and dévoõka ('girl'). Here English adjec- tives do not at first sight reveal this distinction, as shown by their translations (2/0/8/3) the little boy (2/0/8/4) the little girl On the other hand, there are situations in which English makes the sex difference explicit, as in pronominal reference, where in certain instances the wider context, 1 Cf. e.g. Nebesky 1965: 1, or Revzin 1966b (3.21): 58. A critical survey of the state of the art in western linguistics just before the subject went out of vogue is Al 1975 (1-4): 6-50. ¿ The Set-theoretical School probably adopted the term diagnostic from Harris 1951, where it is occa- sionally used as an apparent synomym of differentiating.</page><page sequence="285">CHAPTER 2.0: INTRODUCTION 263 containing he or she, will block the interchangeability of girl for boy In fact, if the set of contexts is interpreted widely enough, then H will be devoid of any diagnostic power for obvious categories such as 'gender': since there are no inherent properties of H which compel us to restrict the length of an element of H to that of an ortho- graphical sentence, there will be an overkill of very long strings which assign a unique distribution to any separate item: every linguistic event is unique. So either it must be decided which horizon (paragraph, dialogue, phrase, clause or contiguous words) determines the concept of context, or various levels of context must be distin- guished, each yielding different types of category. This is what Whorf proposes when he distinguishes between overt and covert categories. An overt category is a category having a formal mark which is present (with only infrequent excep- tions) in every sentence containing a member of the category. [...]* A covert category is marked [...] only in certain types of sentence and not in every sentence in which a word or element belonging to the category occurs. The class-membership of the word is not apparent until there is a question of using it or referring to it in one of these special types of sentence, and then we find that this word belongs to a class requiring some sort of distinctive treatment LI.2 The Set-theoretical School would say that Whorf's "certain types of sentence" repre- sent sets of diagnostic phrases for the correponding categories. Diagnostic phrases are sentences in which the occurrence and non-occurrence of certain words show a pattern which is thought to be indicative of certain morphosyntactic properties of those words. Now the problem is how to identify the diagnostic phrases for a specific phenomenon in the total set of phrases. It does not seem sufficient to select one of the horizons mentioned above. For instance, the English "gender" distinction seems to be present in pronominal reference not only outside a clause, but also within it, as in (2/0/8/5) The boy sees himself in the mirror. where boy cannot be replaced by girl, at least on Whorf's level of grammaticality. Here Russian does not express the difference: dévoõka PgirD can be substituted for mál'dik ('boy') in (2/0/8/6) Mál'oik vídit sebjá v zérkale. 'the boy sees himself in the mirror1 Some models of the Set-theoretical School contain formal procedures for establishing sets of diagnostic phrases on the basis of flj or %3 In other models, such a procedure is tacitly assumed to have taken place. In such models H in practice consists of basic sentences which are interpreted on an intuitive basis as standing for certain simple syntactic structures. Some models go beyond that and temporarily exclude, explicitly but not formally, certain inconvenient types of sentences. Thus, V.A. Uspenskij pro- poses to enhance his and Marcus' models of 'case' and complete case' by excluding from H Russian sentences which contain adjectives, because the irregular behaviour of the latter interferes with the intended results.4 1 Whorf 1945/1972 104. 2 Whorf 1945/1972: 105. 3 A proposal to that effect is Revzin's case model: see §3.3.1 3ff. 4 Uspenskij, V.A., 1957/1993 (2): 1203-1204; see §3.3.5.</page><page sequence="286">264 PART 2: STRING MODELS Other models specifically employ phrases which represent complex structures, for the explicit purpose of manipulating the result of a model which is required by the in- tuition of the investigator. The following example enables the reader to judge for him- self whether this is legitimate. At first sight, the gender of a Russian or German noun cannot be deduced from the distributional behaviour of its plural forms: all adjectives and verbs which modify it are only marked for plural. Thus, consider the singulars (2/0/8/1), (2/0/8/2) and (2/0/8/7) málen'koe zdánie 'small building' and compare them with their plurals (2/0/8/8) málerikie mál'oiki 'little boys' (2/0/8/9) málen'kie dévoõki 'little girls' (2/0/8/10) málen'kie zdániia 'small buildings' This circumstance had been appreciated or regretted by various investigators for some years1 when Zaliznjak pointed to phrases of the following type.2 (2/0/8/1 1) málen'kie mál'oiki, kázdyj iz kotóryx . . . 'little boys, each one of which . . .' (2/0/8/12) málen'kie dévoõki, kázdaja iz kotóryx . . . 'little girls, each one of which . . .' (2/0/8/13) málen'kie zdánija, káidoe iz kotóryx . . . 'small buildings, each one of which . . .' Since káidyj ('each') is marked for 'gender1, the above phrases differentiate the distri- butions of the plural forms of different genders. Whorf's terminology must be enriched to cover this situation. We are confronted here with conditioned varieties of overt and covert categories. The category of gen- der is overt on the clause level when combined with a singular marker, but goes covert on that level in combination with plural. Zaliznjak's examples enable us to re- cover gender in the plural on the level of compound sentences. This device of ex- panding the set of phrases so as to pinpoint specific distinctions will return every now and then in these volumes. The expanded phrases will be labelled Z-phrases.3 Revzin at first hails Z-phrases as a subtle observation.4 Later on, he is more criti- cal and considers them to be part of a potentially circular full model: such (language- specific) phrases can only be identified by a device that already knows what it is looking for.5 The question is whether: 1 It motivated V.A. Uspenskij's proposal referred to above to remove sentences with adjectives from the corpus. 2 Zaliznjak 1964 {31 31. 3 Usually, Z-contexts will be used: contexts which are derived from Z-phrases. See §2.2.6. 4 Revzin 1967b (3.22): 90; footnote 47. 0 Revzin 1977 (4.4.1): 152. See also §3.3.14.</page><page sequence="287">CHAPTER 2.0: INTRODUCTION 265 1 Z-phrases entail an overall raising of the level of the strings to be contained in //, (i.e. one set of strings is replaced by another set which includes the former and is determined by criteria which are assumed to be given from outside), or: 2 specific phrases are added to H in order to increase its diagnostic value with re- spect to specific categories. In the first case, the model remains potentially consistent: a new set of Z-phrases may then contain new discoveries, which provide empirical support for a model of 'gender1. On the other hand, the expansion of the set of phrases entails the risk of producing "parasitic" phrases which, when discovered, falsify the model. But it seems that Zaliznjak, and at any rate V.A. Uspenskij, by purposeful expansion and by purposeful limitation, respectively, manipulate H in order to obtain regular manifestations of the type of category they are looking for. This would of course leave the real problem unresolved: is H to yield overt or covert categories, and, if one decides that there are varieties of H for different types of category, how are these varieties to be distinguished without reference to the concepts they are devised to define? There has been no real solution for this problem within the framework of R'. Later models employ syntactic and semantic structures instead of linear ones, which diminishes the relevance of the discussion on diagnostic validity.1 The early models will make do with a substitutional set of phrases2 which corre- sponds to the set of possible orthographical strings bounded by punctuation signs. If commas are included in the set of boundary markers, Zaliznjak's examples will be ex- cluded and V.A. Uspenskij's exclusions will not be allowed. Wherever the diagnostic nature of phrases plays a particular role in a model, this will be brought into the dis- cussion. S 2.0.9 Note on Revzin's expanding sets of sentences Revzin's original contribution to the three discussions in §2.0.7 deserves mention. Revzin proposes assigning two sets of phrases to the base component: a finite set of permissible {real reaVnyj) phrases and a finite set of suppressed (zapreSdennyj) phrases. The infinite remainder of potential phrases is accounted for by a procedure which generates the other elements of the infinite sets and extrapolates the analysis (explanation) which is provided by the model for the finite sets.3 Thus, the finiteness of the two sets, provided that they are are sufficiently large and heterogeneous for the definiton of categories, presents a solution for the first problem of §2.0.7. The second problem is avoided, as both the set of permissible phrases and the set of suppressed phrases exclude possible borderline cases. A con- tribution to solving the third problem is made if the structure of the procedure yields information about different types of sentences. Revzin has presented various propos- 1 Note that the issue is no less Whorf's problem than V.A. Uspenskij's and Zaliznjak's. The problem is in fact which aspects of distribution are to be described in syntactic terms and which parts in terms of exten- sional semantic classes. The point, which is discussed in the "waitress sentences" of the generative seman- ticists (cf. McCawley 1968/ 19762. Kuroda 1969) will be returned to in Chaoter 4.6: see §4.6.10. §4.6.50. 2 Substitutional base component: § 1.5.3. 3 Modelling grammar on the basis of a partial knowledge of sentences and non-sentences is also an aban- doned idea of Chomsky.

Chomsky 1957 (2.1): 13-14.</page><page sequence="288">266 PART 2 STRING MODELS als for the procedure.1 In its last stage, the model with expanding sets of sentences acquired reality claims consistent with language acquisition theories,2 but by then its base component contains more concepts than just words and phrases. Since expansion models belong to the domain of pure syntax, a discussion of their details for their own interest is outside the scope of this study. Also they do not es- sentially affect the morphological models. Mathematical differences of the models are not determined by the matter of whether //contains registered or real phrases. Lin- guistically, on the other hand, adoption of a narrow set of permissible phrases is out of order. As will be shown in the following section the choice of a broadest possible set of phrases yields the best results. If a choice must be made in terms of the model with expanding sets of sentences, H must coincide with the set of non-suppressed phrases. S 2.0. 1 0 Grammatically Grammaticality issues on borderline cases sometimes affect the results of the models. The extent to which they do so varies strongly. Consider the phrases (2/0/10/1) Ón tám obsuzdál nedélju. 'he discussed the week (accusative) there1 (2/0/10/2) Ón tám obsuzdál zenú. 'he discussed his wife (accusative) there1 (2/0/ 1 0/3) Ón tám zi l nedélju. 'he lived there week (accusative)', i.e. 'he lived there for a week' (2/0/10/4) 7?Ón tám zii zenú. 'he lived there wife (accusative)', i.e. 'he lived there for a wife', 'he lived there for a wife's time' The problem is whether (2/0/10/4) counts as grammatical. Note that unprepared na- tive speakers reject it: even after conditioning their frame of reference, the present writer has found the resistance of Russian informants to (2/0/10/4) to be much more persistent than his English informants' resistance to its literal English translation (2/0/10/5), even if for a wife is to be interpreted as expressing duration: (2/0/10/5) He lived there for a wife. B.A. Uspenskij would nevertheless consider (2/0/10/4) acceptable. In his conception, any phrase in which replacing the roots of the words yields a generally accepted phrase counts as grammatically correct:3 the root ¿en- in ¿enú Cwife') can be replaced by the root nedeV- of nedélju. But BA. Uspenskij's grammaticality criterion is not for- mal in the sense of the present model, which does not have roots as a primitive or derivable concept: if the model would yield these concepts on the basis of the set of grammatical sentences, the full model would be circular. So, essentially, the set of grammatical phrases continues to be determined from outside, by an oracle. As will become clear in this study, it is extremely convenient to employ B.A. Uspenskij's cri- terion as a component of the oracle and treat (2/0/10/4) as if it were grammatical. 1 Revzin 1964a; Revzin 1966a; Revzin 1967b (3.19): 77ff.; Revzin 1967b (7.54): 209ff.

[...] On the other hand, a "narrower" view is possible, in which grammaticality is assessed in close de- pendence on the meanings of words; for example, a division of nouns into those which can express du- ration and those which cannot, is recognized as being essential from the viewpoint of grammar. * In the broad view, a phrase like (2/0/10/4) is acceptable: it is analogous to the fully acceptable phrase (2/0/10/3); in the narrow view, phrase (2/0/10/4) is not acceptable: wives are not units of time. At first sight, Zaliznjak's distinction is reminiscent of Chomsky's distinction between grammaticality, which relates to competence, and ac- ceptability, which relates to performance.2 However, both broad and narrow gram- maticality are essentially based on interprétât ional distinctions, described in terms of potential reference, rather than syntactic rules. There are five ways to deal with the problem: 1 construct models with structures which are indifferent to the distinction between broad and narrow grammaticality; 2 construct models operating with two types of grammaticality, which more or less correspond to the sets of sentences identified in Zaliznjak's viewpoints; 3 adopt the broad view; 4 adopt the narrow view; 5 do away with the concept of grammaticality altogether. The first four approaches are found in Soviet theoretical linguistics of the period. Zaliznjak himself adopts approach 1, at least for the model which comes with the above quotation. Assumptions on the grammaticality of (2/0/10/4) do not affect the re- sults of his model of case1.3 This is possible, for example, when one is looking for a criterion to identify the accusative: in that instance it does not matter whether (2/0/10/4) is indicative for it or not, as there are other phrases which are indicative for the accusative and do not raise any doubts. In that situation the grammaticality treatment of (2/0/10/4) does not affect the eventual inventory of accusative forms for Russian. However, this does not always apply. If a model classifies items together on ac- count of their identical behaviour in any environments, phrase (2/0/10/4) presents a problem: its grammaticality status decides whether ¿end and nedélju belong to the same or different classes. Here the results of the model depend immediately on the grammaticality conception used. (This does not imply that grammaticality affects the models themselves: it affects only their results for specific languages.) 1 Zaliznjak 1967b (2.3): 38. 2 Chomsky 1965 (1.2): 11. 3 This model will be introduced in §5.1 Off. If (2/0/10/4) is rejected, it will yield a "non-diagnostic Z-ade- quate pair" (see §5.12) as far as the accusative position is concerned.</page><page sequence="290">268 PART 2 STRING MODELS Apres jan adopts approach 2. In "normal" linguistic data, he distinguishes two types of correct or regular (pravil'nyj means both) sentences, which exist in their own right and apparently correspond to Zaliznjak's broad and narrow grammatically: [1] Correct sentences which represent the default way of expressing a given thought (these are used in speech), and [2] correct sentences which are essentially possible within the framework of a linguistic system al- though they are rarely found in actual speech (there is no need to use them in speech but they must be taken into account as potential products of experimental transformations).1 Thus, there are two different objects of investigation: actual sentences and abstract sentences. They more or less correspond to Mayoh's semantically non-deviant sen- tences and grammatically non-deviant sentences, respectively.2 This distinction is comparable with that between the phonological inventory of a language and phonotactic rules or constraints as employed by many phonologists. The rules accept not only existing words but also non-existing words which conform to the restrictions assumed to be inherent in the language. Consider P.H. Matthews' English example quab? as far as he knows, the word does not exist and does not mean any- thing, but he would not be surprised if it would exist, as it would not be blocked by any phonotactic constraint in English. Similarly, on the level of word formation, Smirnickij introduces the concept of potential word (potenciaVnoe slovo): the word blackishness is not a ready unit but can be made up, whenever needed, by analogy from black, blackish, blackness, boyishness, etc.4 It might be decided likewise to allow for certain syntactic combinations of "poten- tial" lexical items, such as (2/0/10/4): they do not happen to make sense at present and are therefore rejected as meaningless, but their probable rejection is not considered relevant to morphosyntactic modelling, as it does not represent a morphosyntactically relevant fact. However, no existing models of the Set-theoretical School employ two conceptions of grammaticality. Neither do they systematically develop models that are indifferent to broad and narrow grammaticality conceptions. This implies that, even if the exis- tence of different levels of grammaticality is recognized, only one of them is used in morphosyntactic matters: either option 3 or option 4 is chosen. In most cases no explicit choice is made: probably, choosing is not considered nec- essary as one is only dealing with models, the concrete application of which is outside the scope of present interest: a model is independent of the reality claims adopted for its variables. But there are some indications on what the authors of the models had in mind. In one of his models of "gender, Zaliznjak explicitly advocates the broad view on gram- maticality, i.e. option 3, but these remarks are made in connection with morphological, rather than syntactic, creativity.5 Gladkij &amp; Mel'ouk, too, note that: 1 Apresjan 1967 ÜI.A.2): 43. 2 Mayoh 1969 (2): 9. 3 Matthews, P.H., 1974 (l&gt;. 10. 4 Smirnickij 1956(2.3.17): 18. 5 Zaliznjak 1967b (2.22): 90; Zaliznjak's remarks will be discussed in §3.2.26.</page><page sequence="291">CHAPTER 2.0: INTRODUCTION 269 the detection of configurations * in Russian LI necessarily presupposes a fairly rough approximation; i.e. we have to evaluate very roughly the grammaticality of sentences we consider.2 They provide examples of phrases which they experience as cumbersome but never- theless wish to consider acceptable. Here are some: (2/0/10/6) ?iskljuõítel'no iskljuoítel'no iskljuoítel'no váZnyj 'exceptionally exceptionally exceptionally important' (2/0/10/7) ?óõen' iskljuöitel'no váznyj 'very exceptionally important' (2/0/10/8) ?ne ne óõen' vljúbõiv 'not not very amorous' (2/0/10/9) ?Eto uïé ne óõen' 'this already not very' The underlying reasons for Gladkij &amp; Mel'ouk's perceptions of cumbersomeness prob- ably vary: phrases (2/0/10/6) and (2/0/10/7) provide interprétât ional problems; the doubtfulness of phrase (2/0/10/8) is possibly ascribed to recursive application of a rule, where it is often hard to say exactly how many loops are acceptable;3 phrase (2/0/10/9) is only a conspicuous instance of ellipsis, which is actually heard in daily conversation, but is only likely to occur in very specific situations, e.g. as an answer to the question (2/0/10/10) Ty eSõè ljúbiS' éto? 'do you still love this?' Elsewhere, Gladkij explictly acknowledges the grammaticality of (2/0/10/1 l)?nemnógoknígi 'a little bit of book' Gladkij here makes the following remark. Note that allowing phrases such as (2/0/10/11) [...] is to sacrifice precision, but we have to deal with such approximations [ogrublenie] if we are to differentiate grammatical correctness [grammatiõeskap pravil'nost] from semantic normality [osmyslennost].4 Gladkij probably means to say that he can afford to admit (2/0/10/11) in his set of grammatical phrases, as he only deals with grammatical correctness, not with seman- tic normality. He does not elucidate these terms but, to the extent they are not self- explanatory, they may be taken to correspond to Apresjan's distinction. Thus, in his models Gladkij opts for abstract sentences, products of implicit rules or constraints in the native speaker's consciousness, which are only superficially overruled by his ex- periences in the real world. The abstract sentences represent robust patterns; the semantic combinability of individual lexical meanings is not taken into account: even if * Configurations are syntactic structures derived from R'. They will be introduced and discussed in §4.1.2 to §4.1.21. 2 Gladkij &amp; Mel'ouk 1969 (6): 167; 1983 (6Bfc 123. 3 One informant considered (2/0/10/8) grammatical.

Thus, the rejection of (2/0/10/1 1) is employed in the classification of nouns.2 In several places, Revzin adduces non-omis- sible determiners,2 such as lúõSij ('best') in: (2/0/10/12) Priéxal lúõSij Saxmatíst mira. 'the best chess-player of the world arrived' where omission of MõSij would result in (2/0/10/13) ?Priéxal äaxmatist mira. 'the chess-player of the world arrived' which Revzin rejects as a complete sentence.4 But many combinations of a noun with another noun in the genitive are considered grammatical, so it is improbable that Revzin would consider (2/0/10/13) ungrammatical in Zaliznjak's broad sense. Appar- ently, Revzin's view is that no meaningful relation of possession can be established between the world and a chess-player so that (2/0/10/13) is ungrammatical in the nar- row sense. This shows that it is one thing to introduce a fundamental distinction but another to apply it. In practice, the models use a set of grammatically correct phrases, the pre- cise borders of which are determined as the occasion arises: some oracle produces ad hoc grammaticality judgements. This approach seems to work fairly well until the models themselves become more sophisticated. But two interesting problems remain unsolved. 1 If broad grammaticality is an essentially abstract concept, it is not accessible through the registration of spontaneous speech. As Apresjan puts it, some phrases are never used in actual speech. Also, broad grammaticality can hardly be corrob- orated by the down-to-earth reactions of a native oracle, who may not approve of the use of wives as units of time. The investigator would face the task of separating the innate rules of the oracle from its accumulated experience with the real world. This means that (2/0/10/4) can only be corroborated by the implicit application of broad grammatical rules. The approach then begs the question of whether a distinction can be made be- tween morphosyntactically relevant and morphosyntactically irrelevant rejections on the part of the oracle without reference to those very morphosyntactic con- cepts that are to be derived from sets of phrases determined by the oracle. In other words, the models run a high risk of being parts of circular full models. Note that a similar problem arises in generative grammar when the grammati- cality of a sentence is described in terms of the grammatical rules which are used to derive the sentence. A most sophisticated proposal to this effect was made by 1 One informant endorsed (2/0/10/11), imagining that it might occur in extremely intellectualistic dis- course. 2 Revzin 1969b: 72, in particular note 17. 3 Non-omissible determiners will be introduced in §4.1.34. 4 Revzin 1973a {2&gt;. 5; see §4.2.8 for details.</page><page sequence="293">CHAPTER 2.0: INTRODUCTION 27 1 Al, who determines the degree of grammatically of a sentence by the relative probability of application of the rules which generate it.1 But when grammatically judgements on a sentence are expressed in terms of the generating rules them- selves, grammaticality ceases to be the independent device which enables the grammarian to assess the performance of competing grammars and to evaluate one set of rules against another, i.e. the raison d'être of a generative grammar as a de- ductive system. Such loss of falsification potential turns a generative grammar into a taxonomic device. 2 A more practical problem is presented by what is perceived as borderline cases. The discussion of these cases was extremely topical in the sixties but the problem was not really solved then. At the comfortable end of the scale, we find the classic cases of slightly unusual grammatical phrases, which probably never caused any resistance. Times have changed. In the sixties the informant had to draw on his imagination to accept the idea of furiously sleeping colourless green ideas. In the nineties, imagination is no longer in power. Consider the gauchists of the present, with their faded standpoints, angry for their unability to find and implement cre- ative solutions for saving the ecology. This leads us naturally to remark that their colourless green ideas are sleeping furiously. Other cases cause more trouble, though mainly to the linguist's conscience. What if his broad grammaticality model accepts phrases which native linguists explicitly reject, such as Revzin's (2/0/10/13)? First, of course, a level of poetical grammaticality can be put into use. Revzin himself repeatedly2 discusses M.I. Cve- taeva's line: (2/0/10/14) Já vséj bessónnicej tebjá ljubljú. 'I love you with all my sleeplessness' Here the average native speaker would reject the use of the instrumental bessónnicej ('insomnia') if it were not for analogous acceptable phrases such as (2/0/10/15) Já vséj duaój tebjá ljubljú. 'I love you with all my soul' The invocation of (2/0/10/15) by the subtle reader "authorizes" (2/0/10/14). An in- formant of the present writer spontaneously rejected (2/0/10/14). When informed on its origin, he gave the following comment. rOh, well of course, that's typically Cvetaeva. You know, poetry is essentially an imperative to the reader to make an additional effort to understand. Interesting how she uses a hackneyed phrase like (2/0/10/15) to construct a fresh image.3 But this phenomenon cannot be set aside as poetical language and is not restricted to analogies with other phrases within the language. In 1977, the present writer tried in vain to lure several informants into accepting the grammaticality of literal Russian translations of such phrases as (2/0/10/16) the man of the year 1 Al 1975, in particular (5): 50 and (7.2.2): 125-131. 2 E.g.

Skoblikov, personal communication.</page><page sequence="294">272 PART 2- STRING MODELS but on December 26th, 1989, when reporting on Time's nomination of Gorbaõev as "man of the decade", Radio Moscow actually used the literal translation (2/0/10/17) õelovék desjatilétija There are two ways to account for this fact. a The narrow view is adopted. The news must then be described in terms of lin- guistic change: the language has actually changed as a result of the adoption of (2/0/10/17), which paves the way for (2/0/10/13). Apparently an only minor mu- tation of the meaning of the Russian genitive had to wait for a chance to break through. b The broad view is maintained. Example (2/0/10/17) is, then, regarded as a syn- tactic counterpart to P.H. Matthew's quab: it has always been possible to use (2/0/10/17) but there was no need to put the option into effect. The broad view seems to be the more adequate one. Language is usually viewed as a stable phenomenon: using broad grammaticality, minor changes of attitude can be accommodated without having to redefine the language. A conception of grammati- cality which allows a model to ascribe fundamental properties to Russian on ac- count of the rejection of (2/0/10/17) can be considered less adequate than a gram- maticality conception which accepts (2/0/10/17) in spite of its rejection by inform- ants. On the other hand, the narrow view is more informative: it approaches descrip- tion, which enables us to observe that there is a difference between (2/0/10/16) and (2/0/10/17), or between 1977 and 1989. The narrow view enables us to assess linguistic change.1 The narrow view is favoured by the fact that (2/0/10/17) enters Russian as a set expression, triggered by a foreign model. An analogon is offered by the spread of the use of the genitive to express possession in Russian in the eighteenth century. Until then, possession was usually expressed by means of possessive adjectives, as in (2/0/10/18) otcóv dorn 'father's (possessive adjective) house' The use of the genitive to express possession, as in modern Russian (2/0/10/19), (2/0/10/19) dóm otcá 'father's house', literally 'house (nominative) father (genitive)' only occurred when the noun denoting the possessor was itself modified, as in: 1 Similar arguments were also produced in connection with phonotactics (or its generative varieties). For example, H. Galtoa in Chomsky 1964b (discussion): 1005, wonders whether the rules of English phonol- ogy would have to be rewritten after a conceivable introduction of a loanword containing a string which is excluded by the active set of rules, e.g. Chomsky's /ftik/ [1964b (2.1): 9251 and if so, whether the rules would not be hobbling, as it were, after the facts. This would suggest that phonotactic rules are no more than consolidated observations, without separate reality claims: the only real explanation (i.e. which does not coincide with description), Galton submits, is always historical. Chomsky [1964b (discussion): 1005] replies that a child, who knows nothing about historical linguistics, knows perfectly well the difference between accidental gaps (such as P.H. Matthew's quab) and non-accidental gaps (such as Chomsky's /ftik/): Chomsky's rules are supposed to explain the child's tacit knowledge. Chomsky does not tell us how a child handles what the rules would determine to be accidental non-gaps (such as Galton's /ftik/).</page><page sequence="295">CHAPTER 2.0: INTRODUCTION 273 (2/0/10/20) dóm moegó otcá 'my father's house', literally 'house (nominative) my father (genitive)' In other words, the genitive of possession required a non-omissible determiner for the possessor. Instances with unmodified possessors, such as (2/0/10/19), occurred infrequently in translations from Greek and were explicitly rejected as Graecisms in normative grammar.1 But, as shown by Vidnes, the use of the unmodified genitive of possession advances in the course of the eighteenth century, its bridgeheads con- sisting of writers who are strongly influenced by French culture on the one hand, and of locutions representing wholesale translations from French expressions containing the preposition de Oof) on the other. Consider:2 (2/0/10/21) po priméru atamána 'after the example of the ataman1 (2/0/10/22) slugúmarkíza 'the servant (accusative) of the marquis' (2/0/10/23) eúvstvovat' svobódu õelovéka 'feel the freedom of man* In (2/0/10/21), where po priméru Cafter the example1) must have been made up on the pattern of French à l'exemple de, a possessive adjective may have been con- sidered inappropriate for expressing the abstract relation between primer and atamán.3 In (2/0/10/22), the use of the genitive of the loan word markiz ('marquis') may be due to stylistic and morphological constraints, while in (2/0/10/23) the use of the genitive õelovéka ('man') with svobódu ('freedom') may be inspired by the cultural connotations of the contents of the message. In the nineteenth century, the postpositive genitive becomes the most wide-spread means of expressing pos- session in the written language. It does not only express possession by people but also enables long cascades of genitives connecting nouns denoting objects, as in (2/0/10/26) ponizénie úrovnja vody pritóka Volgi. 'a lowering of the level of the water of the tributary of the Volga' Such chains of relations can hardly be expressed by means of possessive adjec- tives: in the spoken language, avoidance of genitive forms would require the use of series of short sentences and various deictic means. 1 At least, in Fedor Maksimov's Grammatika slavenskaja, which was printed in Novgorod in 1723: cf. Vidnes 1958: 100. 2 Examples from a collection given in Vidnes 1958: 100. Example (2/0/10/21) originates from PuSkin; examples (2/0/10/22) and (2/0/10/23) from N.M. Karamzin. 0 This inappropriateness must itself have resulted from earlier restrictions on the use of possessive adjec- tives. As Vidnes points out with reference to Miklosich 18832 (1.2): 6-17, in earlier stages of Slavic lan- guages, possessive adjectives could express all but any relation between nouns: this is particularly striking with déverbal nouns: an occurrence of Old Russian (2/0/ 1 0/24) car'ska nevera 'the emperor's (posessive adjective) betrayal' is documented to refer to an instance of betrayal in which the emperor has the role of the betrayee, rather than that of the betrayer. Similarly, (2/0/ 1 0/25) kamen'no pobienie 'the stone (posessive adjective) slaughter' refers to an instance of slaughter by means of stones [Vidnes 1958: 991.</page><page sequence="296">274 PART 2: STRING MODELS Vidnes concludes that the recent expansion of the use of the genitive is due to foreign influence.1 In this conception, the doubtful grammaticality of (2/0/10/17) represents a last pocket of resistance, to be tackled by means of another foreign model: an informant of the present writer, born in the 1950s, associated with the clichés of mass culture the use of genitives of nouns denoting inanimate objects with persons, as in (2/0/10/17). Thus, after the acceptance of: a first, the genitive for expressing possession of persons or objects by persons, as in (2/0/10/19) or (2/0/10/22); b then, a more abstract type of possession of objects by objects, as in (2/0/10/26); a most abstract interpretation of "possession" of persons by objects, as in (2/0/10/17), may finally be about to gain acceptability.2 However, neither the broad nor the narrow view of grammaticality provides an ade- quate vehicle for information on what the differences between grammatical and un- grammatical phrases consist of. Both views define grammaticality in terms of thresh- olds, which have borderline cases but no intermediate instances; neither view is in- terested in the nature of the differences as an object of investigation. As pointed out in the beginning of this section, the present writer perceives a considerable differ- ence between the degree of resistance of native informants to the Russian (2/0/10/4) and to its English translation (2/0/10/5). The same applies to (2/0/10/14): it sounds beautiful and original in Russian, but its English translation hardly strikes us as poeti- cal. This cannot, to the present writer's mind, be reduced to socio-cultural differ- ences, such as status of wives or sense of humour. If these observations are correct, a linguistic explanation must be provided. In the case of (2/0/10/4) and (2/0/10/14), it is difficult to explain the difference between English and Russian without invoking the semantics of English for and with, and the Russian accusative and instrumental. If we could lay our hands on such subtle distinctions, the whole grammaticality problem would be obviated by dissolving the very concept: whereas grammaticality is just a taz bel for the behaviour of informants, subtle semantics would provide empirically inter- esting explanations for rejections and acceptances of phrases, as well as for inter- mediate reactions and differences among informants. On the other hand, when the se- mantic notions have been established in terms of which grammaticality behaviour can be described, it may be possible to explore the social factors which trigger such be- haviour. Such factors must account for the circumstances which determine the di- 1 Vidnes 1958: 101. The matter may be more complicated. To begin with, two indigenous circumstances favoured the expansion of the genitive: the long-standing use of the modified genitive for possession, and the use of the genitive of the pronoun of the third person to express possession (which is not mentioned by Vidnes). Also, it must be explained why it was the genitive which was to be adopted for reflecting French de, and not, say, ot ('from'). Finally, sociological observations must explain why the possessive use of the genitive penetrated the spoken language so easily, and why the French model succeeded where the Greek model had been failing for centuries. 2 Accounting for the semantics of the indicated relation between õelovék ('man') and desjatilétija ('decade') in phrases such as (2/0/10/17) is quite a problem. §4.2.8 contains a footnote with a proposal (applied to the analogous example (4/2/8/2)). It would be interesting to speculate on the way in which "language-and- thought" theorists of the neo-Marrist school (cf. §0.12) would have dealt with such acceptability shifts. Ac- cepting, as normal, messages about void or inconceivable relations of possession such as the one which is presupposed between a decade and a man in (2/0/10/17) requires a certain amount of brainwashing: the shift involved may be one of world outlook rather than of grammar.</page><page sequence="297">CHAPTER 2.0: INTRODUCTION 275 verging status of (2/0/10/15) and (2/0/10/14), i.e. the difference between the readily accepted cliché in (2/0/10/15) and the fresh image which makes the effort to under- stand (2/0/10/14) rewarding. All this is covered by option 5 mentioned in the beginning of this section. Although the importance of semantic factors gradually increases in the course of the development of the Set-theoretical School, no models described in the present study abolish grammatically completely.1 In practice we shall have to live with a broad conception of grammaticality, which is narrowed down sometimes in Revzin's models and only starts causing problems in Part 4. At the same time certain models, such as Zaliznjak's which was referred to in the beginning of this section, allow for ig- noring the problem. Instances where the treatment of one or two slippery borderline cases crucially affects the performance of a model for specific languages will be identified and discussed. In view of the instability of grammaticality itself, it cannot be required that gram- maticality marking in these volumes be fully consistent. The value of the signs that are used in this book to mark phrases, viz. of *, ??, ?, and zero marking, varies depending on the type of argument for which the phrases are adduced. When dealing with some issues, phrase (2/0/10/4) will be marked as grammatical, à la B.A. Uspenskij, without discussion. In other instances the implications of the dubious grammaticality status of such phrases as (2/0/10/4) for a model will be elaborated on. The signs serve rather as a warning to the reader: they forecast the likely reaction of a native speaker who is implicitly considered known and, in a full description of the language, should be char- acterized each time in terms of a large number of parameters (social, psychological, emotional, the condition of his frame of reference, etc.). In other words, the grammat- icality markers indicate the relative social acceptability of the corresponding phrases with respect to the corresponding linguistic argument among linguists who believe in grammaticality. 1 In a sense, Kolmogorov's original model, which will be discussed in §5.38ff., is an exception: it is not based on a set of grammatical strings but on a set of "states". Yet in its most feasible interpretation, the set of states presupposes a corresponding set of strings in another module of the full model.</page><page sequence="298">CHAPTER 2.1: (SEGMENTATION) MODELS OF WORD1 §2.1.1 'Word' as a definable unit in the Set-theoretical School The amount of attention which has been paid to the parallelism between phonology and morphology is contrasted by the relative lack of attention, in the Set-theoretical School, to the connection between the two levels. They are usually treated as entirely independent manifestations of language: generally, both phonological and morphologi- cal models have separate (provisional) base components and neither type has pro- vided derivations which can serve as a base component for the other type. In other words, attempts to view phonological models and morphological models as modules in one full model are rare. This is to be regretted in view of the risk of incompatibility and circularity which exists for partial models.1 Only three models have been presented which derive 'word' from units which are considered more primitive. Revzin, who more than other exponents of the Set-theoret- ical School acted as the guardian of the consistency and integrity of the full model, presented a model in 1962a, which was modified in 1966b and 1968. P.S. Kuznecov, who had inspired Revzin's model, presented his own version in 1964; some of its as- pects were worked out in more detail in his 1968 paper. Finally a model proposed by the Polish linguist Jassem in 1960 was explored and formalized in Revzin 1978. The models are not concerned with the internal determination2 of the concept of word, which is considered given in the form of strings of elements. They are con- cerned with external determination: the identification of strings which occur as words in larger structures. The larger structures are given as strings which are made up of elements of the same kind that make up words. Words are segments of these larger strings. They are defined if we can determine the proper segmentation of the strings. The models are similar to the American segmentation models of the 1950s,3 which, however, are only referred to by Jassem. The latter emphasizes, as an important dif- ference, that the segmentation procedures of Harris and his school deal with morpho- logical segmentation and content themselves with identifying words with minimal free forms,4 whereas Jassem's own model is directed at word segmentation. He considers the definition of words to be preliminary to that of morphs and morphemes.5 Revzin, too, considers words easier to pinpoint than morphemes. Models of 'morpheme based on the segmentation of words into smaller parts have actually been developed by Marcus, Revzin and Mel'ouk.6 The formal quality of the models of 'word discussed in this chapter is not always up to the standards of the Set-theoretical School. The linguistic naivete which sometimes characterizes the elegant formalizai ions of the models is here paired to a low degree of formalization which allows for so many interpretations that checking all possibili- 1 Cf. §1.5.2. 2 Internal and external determination cf. §2.0.1. 3 See, in particular, Harris 1955. 4 This does not apply to Bloch's [1946/19664 (1.2ff): 155f.] word segmentation procedure, which bears a striking resemblance to some of the models presented in this chapter. 5 Jassem 1960 (1): 36. b E.g.

The problems presented by formalization are in fact substantial, in view of the task which is set for the model: delimitating a segmentation of tokens by comparing the distribu- tion of types which are to be defined on the basis of tokens. In order to enable the reader to judge for herself, the available models are nevertheless presented in this study. Some problems concerning their formalization and linguistic interpretation will be discussed. S 2.1.2 The base components of segmentation models As in (2.0.2.1), the base component of the models is ñy. fll = (F,fl) (2.1.2.1) Here F is interpreted as an alphabet of phones, and H as a set of phonic strings. These terms are used here because the precise interpretation of F, as sounds, or phonemes, or something in between, varies between models. The output of the model is another relational system with the structure of ft', in which F is replaced by the set W of words. These words are strings of phones which are in turn combined into strings of words. In fact, Revzin does not employ the label word for the output of his model. His term is basic speech-unit (or basic unit of dis- course: osnovnaja reõevaja edinica; unité fondamentale du discours).1 Basic speech units are linguistic units which are in a near one-to-one correspondence with words: words are, in Revzin's view, only typographical units, defined as strings between blanks. In other words, Revzin assigns a new label to derived units with the reality claims formerly made for 'word' and uses word for a non-linguistic concept. Further- more, Revzin concludes that words can be substituted for basic speech units for most practical purposes.2 Thus, 'word' is the basic unit in substitutional models. In his ren- dering of Jassem's model, Revzin employs phonetic word. He uses this term because this 'word1 is defined on phonetic strings (i.e. not in order to express the more usual distinction between phonetic words and syntactic words, which provide disparate segmentations in certain languages). Jassem and P.S. Kuznecov employ the term word. All derivations obviously carry the same reality claim. For that reason word will be used throughout in the discussion of all models. In some cases, other primitives are added to R'. In Revzin's and P.S. Kuznecov's mod- els, a segmentation A of the strings in H is given. The set S(h) of possible segmentations of a string h, where h e H, is defined as fol- lows. SKh)={(si,...,Sn)| A st e H*&lt;F) A s{. . . sn = h} (2.1.2.2) Segmentation A is subject to the following constraint. 1 Osnovnaja reõevaja edinica: Revzin 1962a (3.20): 56; basic speech-unit: Revzin 1966b (3.20): 53; unité fondamentale du discours: Revzin 1968 (320): 54. 2 Revzin 1966b (3.20): 56.</page><page sequence="300">278 PART 2: STRING MODELS A HWn^a (2.1.2.3) heH Thus, for each string in //, there is at least one segmentation in A. The segments of the elements in A are interpreted as bounded by phonological boundary signals in Revzin's model and by potential pauses in P.S. Kuznecov's model. In Revzin's rendering of Jassem's definition, a relation R of identity of meaning between phonic strings is considered given. §2.1.3 Revzin's word model: description of the base component The base component of Revzin's model of 'word1 is ala = (F,//,A) (2.1.3.1) Here F is an alphabet; H is a harp on F, i.e. H c H*(F). Set A is a segmentation of H: for every string h, where he//, there is a string a(h' where a(h) e Ay such that there is a set of segments {ot'{h' . . . , an(h)} for which aW«(aiW,...fanW) (2.1.3.2) and ai(h)...an(h) = h (2.1.3.3) Set F is interpreted as a set of phonemes, and is either a real primitive or the output of a phonological model. Harp H is interpreted as the given set of grammatically cor- rect1 strings of phonemes. Segmentation A provides segments which are interpreted as bounded by phonological boundary signals. The latter concept has been adopted by Revzin from Trubeckoj.2 Judging by his exemplification, Revzin's conception of boundary signals resembles Moulton's con- ception of juncture.3 Revzin's examples include the following phenomena. 1 Independent features which occur in a string between two phonemes and are not allotted to any segmental phoneme in particular. Revzin's example: glottal stops in German often separate morphemes. Consider Moulton's examples:4 (2/1/3/1) Arbeiter suchen 'look for workers' (2/1/3/2) Arbeit ersuchen 'request work' When pronounced in rapid speech on what Meinhold &amp; Stock call the conversa- tional phonostylistic level (Gesprächsstufe), so that orthographic er is realized as fe] in both Arbeiter and ersuchen, phrases (2/1/3/1) and (2/1/3/2) can be distin- guished by the optional insertion of a glottal stop between Arbeit and ersuchen in (2/1/3/2).5 1 Grammatically correct §2.0.7. 2 Revzin 1966b (3.18): 50.

Revzin's example: in German, the aspirated variant [ti of /il characterizes an initial position of lil in roots and is considered to determine a boundary before /t/ in those languages. In Fleischtopf Cf leshpot'), which has a morpheme boundary between Fleisch- ('meat') and -topf ('pan'), the phoneme N is represented by the aspirated variant; in Bleistift ('pencil'), which has a morpheme boundary between Blei- ('lead') and -stiff ('stylus'), it is not.1 3 Suprasegmental features which signal the existence of a boundary. Revzin's example of fixed stress can be classified as belonging here. In Revzin's view, stress may signal the beginning of a word (in e.g. Czech and Finnish) or the end (in e.g. Ar- menian or Polish). These signals are not always unambiguous, however. Consider the Czech phrase: (2/1/3/3) v souladu se souëasnym lingvistickym územ 'in accordance with present-day linguistic usage' Here the stressed first /i/ in lingvistickym cannot indicate whether the boudary must be located between /ill (i.e. y of souöasnym) and /m/ or between /m/ and /I/, because the cluster /ml/ can occur inside words and morphemes. For Finnish the indications provided by stress will be less ambiguous because of the strict limita- tions on consonant clusters in that language. Revzin also mentions German as a language in which stress functions as a boundary signal. German stress is mobile but is nevertheless indicative of bound- aries, as stems are usually stressed. Moreover, German stress, as a suprasegmen- tal feature, does not only affect vowels: it may also extend over preceding conso- nants but not across a morpheme boundary. In Kauflachs ('chew flax'), which has a morpheme boundary between Kau- Cchew') and -flachs Cflax'), the comparative loudness of /f/ is higher than in kauf Lachs ('buy salmon').2 Moulton, who distin- guishes four stress levels for German, remarks that the distinction is not observed for all of them: no stress difference distinguishes in Slavonien ('in Slavonia') from ins Lateinische ('in Latin').3 In Russian, stress is a boundary signal in so far as it indi- cates that there must be a boundary somewhere between two stressed vowels. Thus, the amount of boundary information provided by stress varies between Czech, German and Russian. 4 Certain sequences of phonemes which are taken to be indicative of boundaries. Revzin's example: /th/ in the German word Welthandel ('world trade'). 5 Revzin also mentions pauses as boundary signals. Since Revzin is discussing phonological boundary signals, we are not dealing with physical pauses but with a phonological abstraction of their phonetic abstraction. Pauses will be discussed along with P.S. Kuznecov's model. wondered whether the insertion of a glottal stop is compatible with the chosen speech style and tempo but, since the example is at least valid for Moulton's informant's speech and Meinhold &amp; Stock do not reject it completely, it will do for the moment. Meinhold &amp; Stock [19822 (5.3): 2341 incidentally, regard the glottal stop in (2/1/3/2) as a suprasegmental feature. 1 Example from Moulton 1947/19664 (3.3.11): 211. 2 Moulton 1947/19664 (2.21): 210. 3 Moulton 1947/19664 (2.21): 210.</page><page sequence="302">280 PART 2: STRING MODELS There are several problems connected with the concept (or this conception) of phonological boundary signal, some of which will be discussed in the next section. But technically, i.e. from the internal point of view of the model, there is no objection to assigning a set of phonological boundary signals to the base component. If another phoneme-yielding model is assumed, it may just as well be assumed to yield boundary signals. For an example of A-segmentation, consider the German phrase (2/1/3/4) with A- segmentation (2.1.3.4) below. (2/1/3/4) das Theater des Welthandels 'the theatre of world trade' ¿(2/1/3/4) = (c*i(2/l/3/4), a2(2/l/3/4), a¿2/l/3/4' cr4(2/l/3/4), a5(2/l/3/4)) (2.1.3.4) The segments are specified as follows; the numbers indicate the types of the bound- ary signal which are assumed to bound them a{(2/ 1/3/4) = das 5; 2 a2(2/l/3/4)=77je 2; 1 «3(2/ 1/3/4) = ater des 1; 4 cr4(2/l/3/4)= Welt 4, 4 ¿2/1/3/4) = handels 4; 5 (2. 1.3.5) The boundary between a3(2/ 1/3/4) and cr4(2/ 1/3/4) is based on the assumption that /sv/ is on the list of clusters which indicate a boundary. If /rd/ would happen to be on the list, we would have a boundary between Theater and des. But then a word such as Erde ('earth') would also contain a boundary. The example shows that, compared to the target segmentation of H into words, segmentation A contains redundant boundaries (e.g. between The and ater) and lacks desirable boundaries (e.g. between Theater and des). S 2.1.4 Revzin's word model: description of the development compo- nent Revzin introduces an auxiliary segmentation into quasi-words, which are separated by structural boundaries.1 Revzin defines his structural boundaries as follows. We shall say that a boundary runs between the two phonemes x and y, if it is possible to omit the part of the phrase including x, or the part including y, without changing the grammatical correctness of the phrase.2 The article the has been underlined twice by the present writer where it is due to a specific interpretation of the ambiguous Russian text.3 The French translation ren- ders this fragment as follows. * Quasi-word is taken from Revzin 1978, where it is used for an analogous concept in Jassem's model [Revzin 1978 (1.2.3): 451. In this model, Revzin speaks of minimal segments [1966b (3.19): 531. In English, Revzin speaks of a constructive criterion of segmentation [1966b (3.19): 513 instead of a structural one. This translates konstruktivnyi î [1962a (3.19): 551 which is rendered in French as structural [ 1968 (3.19): 53]. 2 Revzin 1966b (3.19): 51. 3 Revzin 1962a (3.19): 55.</page><page sequence="303">CHAPTER 2. 1: (SEGMENTATION) MODELS OF 'WORD' 28 1 [...] si on peut supprimer une partie de la phrase contenant x, ou y, L.]1 The French and English renderings can yield different results. Consider the Russian sentence: (2/ 1/4/1) Oná nemym pereneslá podnós. 'she transferred a/the tray for the mute' The English interpretation of (2/1/4/1) would not yield a structural boundary between the ne and mym of nemym, because neither (2/1/4/2) *Oná ne nor (2/1/4/3) *mym pereneslá podnós are grammatically correct strings. In the French interpretation, on the other hand, a boundary would be assigned between ne and mym, because, say, (2/1/4/4) Oná neslá podnós. 'she carried the tray' is grammatically correct. Revzin's own examples do not make clear which interpreta- tion is envisaged, because both interpretations happen to yield identical boundaries there. But consider Revzin's example (2/1/4/5) Der Täter verachtet diese Verordnung. 'the offender scorns this regulation* for which the following structural segmentation is presented. ß(2/l/4/5) = Der (i) Täter (2) verachtet (4) diese (5) Verordnung.

From here on, BF0i) will be referred to as B(h). Thus, for each h in //, there are at least two segmentations: one or more elements of A(h) and the uniquely defined element of Bih).

If stress is ignored, Theater itself contains two more (B-)boundaries, yielding T7ie(6)a(7)ier, in view of (2/1/4/28) in diesem Täter 'in this offender' In that case, there are two (B-)boundaries, (5) and (7), which are confirmed by phono- logical (A-)boundaries (1) and (2), singling out a quasi-word /te/, which is actually found in German: Tee ('tea'). But Tee does not occur in the string in which it is identi- fied. Thus, a technical complication arises here. Not all fragments of a string belong to phonologically regular quasi-words and therefore the concept cannot be defined as a segmentation. On the other hand, phonologically regular quasi-words cannot be de- fined in terms of types, as identical strings may occur twice in a string and can be a phonologically regular quasi-word in one place and fail to be so in another. Consider the example (2/1/4/29) Die Theorie dient der Praxis. 'theory serves practice' Here the first occurrence of die is a phonologically regular quasi-word, assuming that it is followed by a phonological boundary. If a set of phonologically regular quasi- words is defined for (2/1/4/29), the second occurrence of die will also be qualified as a phonologically correct quasi-word. Before we discuss ways to avoid this complication, the final step of Revzin's word definition will be presented. Phonologically regular quasi-words serve as catalysts1 in a definition of a complete segmentation of //into words, which Revzin formulates as follows. The basic speech-unit [...] is: 1 any phonologically correct [i.e. regular] minimal segment [i..e. quasi-word]; 2 any succession of phonemes [a] having the same distribution as i.e. occurring in the same environments [...] as a certain basic speech-unit, and [b] not decomposable into other basic speech-units; 3 any succession of phonemes which lies between the two nearest basic speech-units.2 1 See §3.2.7 for an extensive illustration of the concept of catalyst; see §3.2.10 for a discussion. 2 Revzin 1966b (3.20): 53. The concept of distribution will be discussed in §2.2.2.</page><page sequence="307">CHAPTER 2. 1: (SEGMENTATION) MODELS OF 'WORD' 285 Revzin advertises this definition as recursive. In recursive definitions concepts are defined in an incremental manner. A catalyzing concept X is defined or assigned.1 Concept X is employed in a definition of a guasj-concept X'. Subsequently, X and X' are collapsed into a new concept, which is, rather confusingly, labelled X as well. The new X is substituted in the same definition which was used to define X' in order to define X", which is in turn collapsed with X. This goes on until the domain of the definition is exhausted.2 In Revzin's definition, part 2a identifies segments which contain at least one word; in Revzin 1978 such a segment is called a potential word The term decomposable in part 2b is ambiguous in that it does not make clear whether a potential word which contains residual segments besides other potential words may be split up; here it is assumed that it may. Revzin's definition looks simple but the present writer has not succeeded in formal- izing it in separate steps: the steps would involve switching between types and tokens as described above. The only decent manner probably consists not in comparing the behaviour of different types of proto-words but in defining contexts and seeing what they admit. In that case, the definition of phonologically correct quasi-words is not a set of strings in h or a segmentation, but a set of segmentations, each of which splits h into three segments gimg2, the first and third of which may be empty and the second of which is a phonologically correct quasi-word. The pair (gi,g2&gt; is the context which admits m. Potential words x are segments such that there is an m such that all con- texts which admit m also admit x. This involves relating m and x to their types: the distribution of occurrences of a word cannot be compared, because the occurrences are the distribution. But the types of m and x have not yet been defined in any other way than as strings. This implies that the set of contexts which admit the phonologi- cally correct quasi-word die in (2/1/4/29) will also contain (er, nt seinem Meister) (2. 1 .4.9) in view of the sentence (2/1/4/30) Er dient seinem Meister 'he serves his master' It is quite improbable that such a distribution criterion will provide meaningful results. The present writer tried overcoming the problem of switching between tokens and undefined types by defining words in one single definition, without intermediate con- cepts. This has resulted in a definition consisting of a single formula which is believed to be correct but does not really inform even the most versatile formalists among the readers. The interested reader is referred to Appendix C for this definition (C.I), which formally determines a segmentation W of //into word segments, based on 7i'a and on segmentations A and B. Once the word segmentation W is defined, it is simple to derive from it the set W of word types. 1 Revzin's catalyzing concepts are usually defined; for assigned catalysts, see the presentation of Marcus' model of 'concrete gender" in §3.27. 2 Recursive definitions are described more extensively in §4.3.1.</page><page sequence="308">286 PART 2: STRING MODELS W = {co | a) e /T(F) A V V to = o&gt;tto)} (2.1.4.10) heH Ui Revzin considers all models of grammatical categories of the type discussed in this chapter to be implicitly based on this set W of words and on set W of structures in which they occur, viz. the set of sentences as strings of words.1 Examples of Revzin's words are given below. §2.1.5 Discussion of Revzin's word model: phonological boundaries First, we shall examine three problems in connection with Revzin's segmentation A into segments bounded by phonological boundary signals. The general linguistic as- pects of the base component and the status of pauses will be discussed in §2.1.10 and §2.1.17. In (2.1.2.3), the uniqueness of an A-segmentation is not ensured: more than one string of strings can be assigned to a string in H. Revzin's discussion of boundaries, by contrast, suggests that his A-segmentations are unique. This would be an implicit constraint, which for the phonological segmentation of H implies that the phonological boundaries in each grammatically correct string of phonemes are fixed. But many phonological boundaries are optional. Consider the Dutch string /merejst/ in the sen- tence (2/1/5/1) Ik weet dat hij meer eist. 'I know that he demands more' In this string, a glottal stop [?] (i.e. a type 1 phonological boundary signal2) may indicate a boundary between /mer/ and /ejst/, so that there are two possible segmentations for the same string (viz. /(i)merejst(2)/ and /(i)mer(2)£jst(3)/). It is possible to ensure the uniqueness of phonological segmentation A by stipulat- ing that A indicates segmentation by possible boundaries: wherever in a string of phonemes there can be a boundary, the boundary is effective in A. In other words, if two strings in H differ from each other in their boundaries only, they are replaced by a string which contains the boundaries of both strings. It then follows that /mer/ and /ejst/ are always separated by a phonological boundary, even in the sentence (2/1/5/2) Ik weet dat hij meer reist. 'I know that he travels more' in which the same string /merejst/ occurs, but in which there never is a [71 between Ixl and Id. To make matters worse, there is a sentence with the same phonemic make-up, but containing a non-optional phonological boundary: (2/1/5/3) Ik weet dat hij meereist. 'I know that he joins in travelling' Normally Id before Ixl is realized by its variant [es], which occurs in the other examples between /me/ and /rejst/. But in (2/1/5/3), in spite of the orthography, the 1 Starting from §2.2.1, since the set of strings of words will be the only harp in the models, the symbol H will replace Wto denote it. 1 Cf. §2.1.3.</page><page sequence="309">CHAPTER 2. 1: (SEGMENTATION) MODELS OF 'WORD' 287 word-final variant [li] of Id is used: the non-substitution of [ii] by [es] cannot fail to be classified as a boundary signal.1 All this induces a phonological segmentation of /merejst/ into /(i)me(2)r(3)EJst{4)/.2 In combination with a structural (B-)segmentation which is based on the existence of /meejst/, e.g. in (2/1/5/4) Ik weet dat hij meeëist. 'I know that he joins in demanding' or (2/1/5/5) Ik weet dat hij meeiist. 'I know that he joins in shuddering' a ghost word Ixl is yielded, which is not a desirable result. As a solution, we can consider lifting the uniqueness constraint and allowing more than one phonological segmentation of a string of phonemes. Then for each h in H there is a set A'(h' A'WCA (2.1.5.1) which contains a string of strings for each possible combination of optional boundary signals in h. However, the differences between the elements of A'(h) will be discarded if the present definitions of B and W are maintained, since the latter are defined on strings of phonemes: the establishment of phonologically regular quasi-words is based on the existence of any phonological boundaries coinciding with structural bound- aries. Better results are feasible if B and W are based on strings in which phonological boundaries are integrated. But even then, there is no way to achieve satisfactory re- sults in cases of full homonymy, as in the case of /merejst/ corresponding to the or- thographic strings meer eist and meer reist. The methodological status of the set of phonological boundary signals presents a second problem. As stated before, there is nothing against postulating primitive phonological boundary signals from the point of view of modelling theory. But let us consider their status from the point of view of their position in a hypothetical full model of which they are presumed to be a part. It seems feasible that phonological boundaries are either residual elements in a phonemic segmentation (e.g. Dutch [?] in the example given below) or the by-product of morphological analysis (e.g. German initial [tf]). Both sources of boundary signals involve some semantic conception. If this semantic conception is used in models to yield the provisional base component of the present model, it is in fact also available in a more direct manner. If a morphological analysis has already been available for the definition of phonological boundaries, it seems a waste not to use the information directly for word segmentation. Thus, although Revzin's statement that the inclusion of phonological boundary sig- nals in the base component does not violate the strictness of the exposition3 is correct 1 Cf. Cohen &amp; al. 19722 (2.2): 14. 2 The existence of less frequent optional realizations of (2/1/5/2) as /me/lid/ejst/ or /me/[ftRj/ejst/ causes further complications, which are left out of consideration. 3Revzin 1966b (3.18): 51.</page><page sequence="310">288 PART 2: STRING MODELS from a mathematical viewpoint, the question remains whether it is linguistically realistic to put them there. Lastly, it will now be examined how the model accounts for conceivable languages which do not have any phonological boundary signals, i.e. languages such that, for each Aih): ailtù'h (2.1.5.2) These languages can of course be ruled out by a constraint, but this may rule out feasible languages. Revzin mentions French as a case in point1 (although Trubeckoj mentions the sequence nasal vowel + nasal consonant as a boundary signal for French2). To Revzin, the existence of languages which are poor in boundary signals or lack them altogether was an additional reason to introduce the structural segmentation criterion: in the extreme case when phonological boundary signals are entirely ab- sent, B must be sufficient to determine W. In such instances, however, it will be im- possible to obtain any other words besides complete sentences, as no structural boundary will be confirmed by phonological boundaries except the ones that coincide with the beginning and the end of a sentence: there are no catalysts for a segmenta- tion. The only phonologically regular quasi-words will be those sentences which do not contain any structural boundaries, such as the exclamation Al They have a distri- bution (XA'X) which coincides only with that of other sentences. Thus, for languages without phonological boundary signals, Revzin's definition of word yields a trivial and counterintuitive result. Only if pauses are included as bound- ary signals can it safely be assumed that there is no language without phonological boundary signals. But the phonological status of pauses is rather problematic: phonol- ogy deals with the properties of speech sounds that differentiate between the mean- ings of a specific language; pauses do not seem to have this function and are not lan- guage-specific. They do possess articulatory and acoustic properties (variable length and zero sound), which make them a legitimate object of phonetic description. As we shall see in §2.1.8, P.S. Kuznecov's adaptation of Revzin's model has taken advantage of this property and retains pauses as the only type of boundary signal for a model of word on a non-phonological basis. S 2.1.6 Discussion of Revzin's word model: structural segmentation The uniqueness of structural segmentation B is ensured by its definition (2.1.4.4). There are few problems here. Gentilhomme, Revzin's translator, remarks that this segmentation can yield many unforeseen non-indicative results for French.3 The same 1 Revzin 1966b (3.18): 51. 2 Trubeckoj 1939: 247. This combination would, incidentally, yield some false boundaries as well, in view of the existence of specific lexical items ending in nasal vowels which retain their nasality even when liai- son before vowels produces [n]. Consider Felice's [1950 (I.B.2.c): 20] examples bon avis [bonavi] vs. mon ami [mSnami]: the second example produces the false boundary. (Felice considers the pronunciation [monami] to be restricted to the older generation.) 3 Revzin 1968 (3.19): 53 footnote.</page><page sequence="311">CHAPTER 2. 1: (SEGMENTATION) MODELS OF "WORD1 289 applies to Russian.

(2/1/6/1) A nemym pereneslá podnós. 'and for the mute she transferred the tray* motivates boundary (1). (2/1/6/2) Oná pereneslá podnós. 'she transferred the tray' motivates boundaries (2) and (5).

(2/1/6/7) Oná pereneslá ponós. 'she transferred the diarrhea* motivates boundaries (13) and (14). This is not harmful in a language like Russian, which is poor in phonological bound- ary signals. In fact, none of the quasi-words of (2/1/4/1) is corroborated by a phono- logical boundary signal, so that word boundaries can only be established on the basis of identical distribution: boundary (12), for example, can be established on the basis of identical distribution of podnós and óbraz ('image', 'icon'), where the stressed first vowel indicates a phonological boundary after stressed final vowels, as in (2/1/6/8) Oná emú peredalá óbraz. 'she handed him the icon1 On the other hand, in languages such as German (Revzin also mentions Estonian), which abound in phonological boundary signals, "redundant" structural boundaries sometimes coincide with "redundant" phonological boundaries, as in Verordnung and Welthandel, where (1) and (2) indicate coinciding boundaries. By themselves devia- 1 Since perenját' ('adopt') implies the adoption of abstract concepts (habits, etc.), there is some semantic resistance to (2/1/6/5).</page><page sequence="312">290 PART 2: STRING MODELS tions from orthographical boundaries do not necessarily point to incorrect or coun- terintuitive results. This is illustrated by the orthographies of the German string (2/1/6/9) aufzuleben 'to revive' and the Dutch string (2/1/6/10) op te leven 'to revive' The structural behaviour of the corresponding component elements of (2/1/6/9) and (2/1/6/10), viz. of auf- and op, of -zu- and te, of -leb- and lev-, and of -en and -en, is identical. But the contrast between the results for Russian and for German suggests that the method of combining segmentations A and B depends to a great extent on chance and speculation on statistical properties of language which have not been made explicit. Not only does the base component allow for languages for which Rev- zin's word definition yields counterintuitive or trivial results, but such languages are perfectly feasible as possible languages. §2.1.7 Discussion of Revzin's word model: word segmentation Here, too, the uniqueness of segmentation W of the strings in H into words is an inter- esting point. The definition of W allows for the possibility that there are two or more segmentations for a string in W. This seems warranted in view of the actual existence of homonymous sentences which differ in their word segmentation. The question re- mains whether the model yields the correct segmentations. Consider the following sentence, an old pun which occurs in Cexov's story "Ionyõ".1 (2/1/7/2) Já idü po kovrü. 'I am walking on the carpet' In the pua (2/1/7/2) is homonymous with (2/1/7/3) Já idü poka vrü. 'I am walking while (I am) telling lies' If the pun is valid, there is a variety of Russian where poká ('while') loses its indepen- dent stress.2 Thus, within the string /pskAvr'u/, no phonologically regular quasi-words can be identified. The distribution criterion in Revzin's definition of W allows for two W-seg- mentations of /pskAvr'u/, viz. /po^kAvr'u/ corresponding to orthographic (2/1/7/2) and /pakAdjvr'u/ corresponding to orthographic (2/1/7/3). The first segmentation is based on the fact that the distribution of kovni coincides with that of certain other nouns (hopefully at least one of which is a phonologically regular quasi-word) and treats po as a maximal residual segment. For the second segmentation, the distribution of poká 1 Cf. Cexov 1962b (3): 325, where Ivan Petroviö Türkin, who always plays with words, conjugates (2/1/7/2) as follows. (2/ 1/7/1) Ty ide§' poká vre§* [...] - on idët poká vrèt. Vou are walking while your are lying; he is walking while he is lying' 2 The present writer's informant acknowledged that a little manipulation of the vowels is necessary to pro- duce the pua</page><page sequence="313">CHAPTER 2. 1: (SEGMENTATION) MODELS OF WORD' 29 1 ('while') is identified with that of kogdá ('when'), or the distribution of vrú CI am lying') with that of lgü ('I am lying'). So Revzin's definition of word is justified in allowing for non-unique segmentations. But it does not allow for all types of homonymous word divisions. Consider the follow- ing Russian examples.1 (2/ 1 /7/4) Let í t portam podárok. 'a present for the ports is flying' (2/1/7/5) Letít po rtám podárok. 'a present is flying along the mouths' Here the W-segmentations /pArt'am/ and /peitam/ cannot coexist, since Revzin's condition 2b rules out as words strings which contain other words.2 Perhaps for this reason, condition 2b is omitted in the French edition.3 There, portam, as well as po and rtám, are likely to qualify as words in the above examples. But, as a consequence of the omission of the constraint implied by condition 2b, certain strings will be identified as words which are not normally regarded as such. Consider, as an example, the string v dorn in (2/1/7/6) Myvxodílivdóm. 'we went into the house' Here v ('into') and dorn Chouse') can be identified as words on the basis of identical distribution with, say, na Conto') and stól ('table'). But the string v dorn (/vd'om/ 'into the house') as a whole will also qualify as a word, in view of its distribution shared with, say, tudá ('thither'). This result is to a certain extent counterintuitive and is certainly not envisaged by the author of the model. Thus, neither the imposition nor the omission of condition 2b is satisfactory. The model can only be saved if a constraint is found which provides two divisions for /pAit'am/ and one for /vd'om/. The present author does not think that it is possible to formulate such a constraint within the framework set by this model's base component flia. We are dealing here with the common pitfall for models which do not take ac- count of semantic considerations. But in early set-theoretical linguistics, explicit se- mantic considerations are prohibited, although of course they enter the model im- plicitly through the given sets of phonemes and grammatical sentences. S 2.1.8 P.S. Kuznecov's word model: base component Revzin's 1962a definition of "word1 was inspired by certain ideas put forward verbally by P.S. Kuznecov.4 In 1964, the latter presented another definition based on these ideas.5 He later employed this definition as a basis for further definitions of various morphological units.6 1 The present writer's informant accepted both (2/1/7/4) and (2/1/7/5) as samples of dilettante poetry. ¿ Cf. §2.1.4. 6 Revzin 1968 (3.20): 55. 4 Revzin 1962a (3.20): 57: 1966b (3.20): 53. 5 Kuznecov, P.S., 1964. 6 Kuznecov, P.S., 1968.</page><page sequence="314">292 PART 2: STRING MODELS Structurally, the base component of P.S. Kuznecov's model is identical to Revzin's, i.e. base component R'a as given in (2.1.3.1), but the interpretation of the symbols F and A is different. Symbol F is not interpreted as the set of phonemes but as the set of sounds. These sounds are stated to be of a physical nature: pronounced by human vocal organs or reproduced by tape recorders or other instruments.1 The use of sounds instead of phonemes solves the problem of potential circularity in the hypothetical full model of which Revzin's model is a module.2 But it introduces new problems, which are connected with the abstraction level on which sound chains are identified. These will be treated in §2.1.10. Also, the interpretation of segmentation A is restricted to pauses. This is consistent with his choice of a phonetic interpretation: whereas the phonological status of pauses is doubtful, sounds and silence seem to pertain to the same level of abstrac- tion. Yet, the abstraction level on which pauses operate remains unclear. It will be discussed in §2.1.10. P.S. Kuznecov's model of word1 concerns only the external part of its definition: words are defined as tokens, not as types. As a module of a full model, word1 is consid- ered to be preliminary to any phonological and morphological analysis and also to the definition of word types.3 Although Revzin's and P.S. Kuznecov's base components mathematically coincide, and the reality claims of the modelled concepts are identical, the divergent reality claims for their phonic strings separate the linguistic concep- tions which they represent. This is a good example of the mutual independence of different components of a linguistic model. S 2.1.9 P.S. Kuznecov's word model: development component P.S. Kuznecov's model contains three definitions, two of which define independent words; the third definition adds auxiliary words. Independent and auxiliary words to- gether define a complete segmentation of the set of sound strings. P.S. Kuznecov's definitions are the following. 1 rA sound sequence which can be bounded by pauses of arbitrary length is a sound sequence contain- ing at least one independent word. [...] 2 A sound sequence determined in the above manner in which no other sound sequence determined in the same manner can be inserted which is , is itself a separate independent word. LI 3 A sound sequence which is neither a separate independent word nor a part of a separate independent word» is an auxiliary word.4 In Revzin's [1978] terminology, P.S. Kuznecov's definition 1 directly defines potential words-, more correctly, since pauses are given, potential words are in fact given. The remaining part of the model deals with the segmentation of potential words into words. Definition 2 employs a criterion which is the opposite of the criterion which Revzin used to define quasi-words: a structural boundary is introduced where a specified 1 Kuznecov, P.S., 1964: 76. 2 Cf. §2.1.5. 3 Kuznecov, P.S., 1964: 75. 4 Kuznecov, P.S., 1964: 76-77.</page><page sequence="315">CHAPTER 2. 1: (SEGMENTATION) MODELS OF 'WORD' 293 segment can be inserted, whereas in Revzin's model structural boundaries occur where unspecified segments can be removed. P.S. Kuznecov's model involves only one switch from token to type (at least inside the model; for problems of this kind in the interpretation of pauses see §2.1.10), and is therefore simpler to formalize than Revzin's model. The formal definition of P.S. Kuznecov's word segmentation WK(h) of a string h in H, where Aiti) is the given set of segmentations of h into segments bounded by potential pauses, is the following.1 J0W)= {(ü&gt;i, ...,ü)n)|ü)i. ..o)n = /iA V A t1 V (ùi = aj («! am)eA[h) l^i^n l*jSm A A A A (2 O)i. . .

Kuznecov's word model: pauses P.S. Kuznecov's segmentation A is interpreted as identifying parts of sound sequences which can be bounded by pauses of arbitrary length.1 The underlined words raise questions as to what exactly is meant. If the phonic strings in the model are physical sounds, no pauses can be inserted. Concrete utterances are or are not interrupted by pauses. Of course, silence can be inserted in recorded sound sequences, but then in fact new sound sequences are synthesized. Besides, in that case the possibility of inserting pauses is not distinctive: they can be inserted anywhere. The only meaningful interpretation of can is the following. We shall say that pauses can be inserted in a string h in H if there are other strings in H which share all prop- erties of h except that they contain stretches of silence. This means that the gram- maticality criterion which P.S. Kuznecov employs for his definition 2 in fact applies to definition 1 as well. rThe result must be a normal, meaningful sentence which can ac- tually occur in the parole {red*) of the language in question."2 The question of whether each A-segmentation of h reflects comparison with only one or with more strings at the same time, and how these options affect the segmen- tation, is left out of consideration here. It is more interesting to see that we are no longer comparing sounds themselves but properties of sounds. This raises the ques- tion of which properties are compared and which properties are abstracted from. P.S. Kuznecov indicates that he abstracts from some things: rWe can single out any fragments of that sound string, and confront (compare, identify) them with fragments of speech of another person, or with other fragments of speech of the same person.3 The set of utterances is also cleared (by means of a hypothetical statistical proce- dure) from unintentional utterances and utterances interrupted unintentionally, and from speech by non-native speakers of a language. P.S. Kuznecov does not mention other linguistically relevant properties, such as intonation and sandhi features. First let us consider whether intonation is abstracted from. P.S. Kuznecov's first examples indicate that intonation patterns are indicative for pauses. Consider the dialogue (2/1/10/1) - Ctó èto tám vdalí? -Dorn. '- what is that yonder? - a house' P.S. Kuznecov distinguishes two potential words here: otó éto tám vdalí and dom. His criterion obviously is the intonation contour of the speech flow: if it would be ab- stracted from, pauses would be possible between, say, õtó éto ('what that') and tám vdalí ('there in the distance'). In his definition 2, however, abstraction is apparently made from intonation. Here potential words are split if and where another potential word can be inserted. Con- sider P.S. Kuznecov's example. The string (2/1/9/1) is segmented as in (2.1.9.3) in ac- 1 See §2.1.9. 2 Kuznecov, P.S., 1964: 77. 3 Kuznecov, P.S., 1964: 76.</page><page sequence="317">CHAPTER 2. 1: (SEGMENTATION ) MODELS OF *WORD' 295 cordance to P.S. Kuznecov's definition 2 as quoted, because (2/1/9/3) exists and con- tains bol'Sój ! ('big'), which occurs as a potential word in string (2/1/9/2). Such insertions will rarely be possible if the inserted potential word retains the intonation contour which it had when it was entitled to the status of potential word. The insertion of boVSój is apparently justified on its potential characterization by a pause-bounded intonation. This may mean that P.S. Kuznecov operates with two levels of abstraction: 1 One set of strings, which retains intonational properties, is used to distinguish and compare strings which have pauses with those that do not. 2 Another, more abstract, set of strings of phonetic units is used for comparing strings on insertion; the strings of this set abstract from intonation. This makes the model considerably more complex and leaves a great deal more to be formalized. Then the problem of assimilation and sandhi features turns up. Consider the string (2/1/10/2) Videi tòt stól. 'saw that table' Suppose that the pause criterion can be applied to single out tôt as a potential word. Now consider (2/1/10/3) VoSli v tót kláss. 'entered that class' Here suppose that the same criterion cannot single out tot Inserting a pause between vand tot, pronounced [ft'ot], without affecting the pronunciation [f] of v is likely to arouse resistance (the only "pauses" the present writer has heard between these lexi- cal items were realized as an indefinite vowel, something like [o] or l'' preceded by a voiced [v]). Now consider: (2/1/10/4) VoSH v tòt górod. 'went into that town' Here v tot cannot be isolated by definition 1 if the phonic strings are interpreted as made up of phonetic units, because the second /t/ of tòt is realized by its phonetic variant [d] as a result of voice assimilation to the [g] which follows it. Since voiced stops do not occur before pauses, no pause can be inserted between tòt and górod. The result of such assimilation phenomena is that, say, (2/1/10/5) V tòt górod-gerój. 'into that heroic city' qualifies as one potential word according to P.S. Kuznecov's definition 2b. Usually, the insertion criterion will take care of such cases but, as in Revzin's model, the question arises as to whether segmentation A, the application of which depends so much on chance that it must be adjusted by another, more powerful, criterion, is not superflu- ous. In fact it is not, as it fulfils a catalyzing function. If there would be no initial set of potential words to insert, the segmentation could not start. This will happen in a language in which every word has two phonetic variants: an utterance-final variety and an utterance-internal variety. No potential words can ever be inserted into a string here, which means that any segmentation below sen-</page><page sequence="318">296 PART 2: STRING MODELS tence level is blocked for that language. True, such a language is hypothetical, but does not seem impossible. In fact Arabic approaches it a great deal with its pausai forms: most words drop their vowel endings at the end of a sentence. Thus, 'he wrote' is kataba in all other positions, but katab at the end of an utterance. This shows the weakness of the underlying principles of the model: it contains an implicit and unwar- ranted constraint on the extent to which languages contain sandhi features. Finally, it is not quite clear what pauses of "arbitrary" length are. If this means that there is no upper limit to the length of the pauses which must be possible between any two potential words, then potential words coincide with utterances. Segmentation A is then trivial as a segmentation. If subsequently stripped of its tonal properties and re- duced to a phonetic string to be inserted into other sentences, a potential word be- comes more or less identical to Bloomfields minimal free form.1 P.S. Kuznecov's contri- bution then represents a method to split up minimal free forms. S 2.1.11 Discussion of P.S. Kuznecov's word model: insertion An obvious gap in P.S. Kuznecov's model was pointed out by Kolmogorov in an oral communication; it is discussed in P.S. Kuznecov's later paper.2 Consider the strings (2/1/11/1) Govorítbrátu. 'speaks to his brother' (2/1/11/2) syn 'the son' Both (2/1/11/1) and (2/1/11/2) are regarded as potential words. The existence of the string (2/1/11/3) Govorft brát synu. 'speaks the brother to the son' causes a segmentation of (2/1/1 1/1) into govorit brát(i)u (2.1.11.1) which identifies the case ending u as a separate word. P.S. Kuznecov examines the morphological circumstances in which these "improper" insertions can occur and pro- poses a statistical treatment to do away with them. In fact, for Russian the number of instances will be relatively limited, but in languages which lack word stress they will be numerous, which contradicts P.S. Kuznecov's claim to broad, if not universal, appli- cability of his definition.3 Nor are they necessarily limited to case endings, as is shown by the Russian phrase (2/1/11/4) v nebol'Sój górod 'into the small (non-large) town' In (2/1/11/4), nebol'èó} is split into ne and bol'aój because of the acceptability, as sep- arate utterances, of (2/1/11/5) and (2/1/11/6): (2/1/11/5) v neprijátnyj bol'Sój górod 'into the disagreeable large town' ^loomfield 1934(11.5): 178. 2 Kuznecov, P.S., 1968: 192-193. 3 Kuznecov, P.S., 1968: 191.</page><page sequence="319">CHAPTER 2. 1: (SEGMENTATION) MODELS OF WORD' 297 (2/1/11/6) prijátnyj 'nice, agreeable' If this example is rejected,1 the Dutch string (2/1/11/7) kommer 'misery' can be adduced. It is split up as a result of the existence of (2/1/11/8) and (2/1/11/9): (2/1/11/8) Komi 'comeT (2/1/11/9) komkommer 'cucumber' A second gap in the model is its treatment of series of auxiliary words. Definition 3 allows for only one auxiliary word between two independent words. In fact, fragments of French to which P.S. Kuznecov reports to have applied his model contain series of separate words which he labels auxiliary.2 (2/1/11/10) Jean ne le dit pas. 'Jean does not say it' P.S. Kuznecov may have changed his definition implicitly in order to apply it to these instances. For example, definition 3 can be changed into 3' and a definition 4 can be added: (2/1/1 1/1 1) 3' A sound string which is neither a separate independent word nor a part of a separate independent word is a potential auxiliary word, which contains at least one auxiliary word. (2/1/1 1/12) 4 A potential auxiliary word in which no other potential word or other potential auxiliary word can be inserted, is an auxiliary word. If a po- tential word or auxiliary word w can be inserted into a potential auxil- iary word a to obtain a string aiwa^ then a' and a&lt;¿ are treated as sepa- rate potential auxiliary words. But this does not solve all cases. If all positions in front of the verb are filled, nothing can be inserted anymore to separate them, as in: (2/1/1 1/13) Jean, '' ne te le dit pas. 'Jean does not say it to you', literally 'Jean, he not you it says not' Another gap in the model is found in the distinction between independent words and auxiliary words. Consider the example (2/1/1 1/14) za dorn 'to the other side of the house' which is split into za and dorn in view of (2/1/1 1/15) za bol'Sój dorn 'to the other side of the large house' 1 After all, there may be reasons not to follow Russian orthography and to consider ne a separate word. 2 P.S. Kuznecov [1968: 191-192] uses his model to prove that the clitic forms of French pronouns are not parts of the verb following them but separate words. The model separates the clitics from the verb but not from each other.</page><page sequence="320">298 PART 2: STRING MODELS Since both the insertion of pauses and the insertion of potential words provide a sym- metrical treatment for za and dorn, it is not clear how P.S. Kuznecov formally distin- guishes between independent words and auxiliary words. It can be supposed that dorn will be considered independent since a string with the same phonetic make-up also occurs as an independent utterance, but this step of the definition has not been made explicit. The fact that za also occurs as an independent word, meaning 'in favour', will be considered a trivial objection for the moment, but consider a phrase with the same structure which in fact brings to light an inconsistency in the definition. (2/1/1 1/16) vdomáx 'in the houses' String (2/1/11/16) contains a prepositional case form of dorn Chouse'), which in an ut- terance is always accompanied by the preposition on which it depends. Definition 1 classifies (2/1/11/16) as a potential word since it occurs between pauses; definition 2 introduces a boundary between v and domáx in view of the possibility of inserting the potential word bofflx ('big') to obtain: (2/1/1 1/17) vbol'Síx domáx 'in big houses' But neither v nor domáx will qualify as an independent word, since they cannot occur as independent utterances, which in turn contradicts definition 1. Thus, the model is logically inconsistent unless constraints are added which are linguistically unwar- ranted. Finally, since P.S. Kuznecov explicitly discards any reference to semantic consid- erations,1 it goes without saying that the model does not cope with homonymous strings with several segmentations. Thus, the potential word UftAnVate] will be split into [Ad)f(2)tAm'at9], i.e. (2/1/1 1/18) A vtomáty. 'and into the tomatoes' thanks to the existence of sentences such as (2/1/11/19) and (2/1/1 1/20), (2/1/1 1/19) A závtra v tomáty. 'and tomorrow (e.g. we shall put it) into the tomatoes' (2/1/1 1/20) A v tót górod tomáty.

'machine guns', 'pay phones' S 2.1.12 Jassem's word model: base component This presentation of Jassem's model of 'word' is terminologically and formally based on Revzin's partial formalization.2 Revzin's symbols have been adapted to the conventions used in this chapter so far. The structure of Revzin's rendering is identical to Jassem's original model, but some sets in the base component are interpreted differently. 1 Kuznecov, P.S., 1964: 76. 2 Jassem 1960; Revzin 1978 (1.2.3): 44-46.</page><page sequence="321">CHAPTER 2. 1: (SEGMENTATION) MODELS OF WORD' 299 Jassem's base component is fli, containing set F of phones and set //of strings made up of phones. Jassem does without preliminary segmentations on the basis of phonic properties. The phonic symbols are interpreted by Jassem as phonemes; in Revzin's rendering they have become phonetic units. Jassem insists that his phonic strings are bounded by actual, not potential, pauses.1 Revzin has added to this base component a relation R of "having the same meaning'.2 This relation has the same function as P.S. Kuznecov's first-level abstraction of sounds which was described in §2.1.10, and permits meaningful comparison of strings by abstraction from personal and situational idiosyncracies. This is the first model in this study with a base component containing explicit reference to meaning. §2.1.13 Jassem's word model: development component Before defining segmentations, Revzin introduces some auxiliary concepts. Set H* contains all possible fragments of strings in //, i.e.:3 //*= {/I/g //*(F)A V V yify2eH} (2.1.13.1) y{eH*(F) y2e H*{F) It is obvious that each string h in //defines its own set of fragments H*(h). Two fragments /' and /" are D-equivalent if they occur in the same contexts, i.e. if:4 A A (yif'y2 g H *=* ytf'yi g H) (2. 1. 13.2) y'eH*[F) y2e H*{F) D-equivalence generalizes over arbitrary fragments step 2a in Revzin's own word model. D-equivalence defines a partition of //*; the D-equivalence class to which fragment / belongs will be denoted as De(/). As an example of D-equivalence, consider the fragments zénSõina (Vornan, singu- lar, nominative') and dévuSka ('girl, singular, nominative'), which are D-equivalent on the assumption that they occur in the same contexts. Two fragments /' and /" are D-congruent if one of them can occur before or after the other, i.e. if:5 A A «y i/'y2 g H V y{ry2 g tí) =&gt; d/i/Tlte e H V y^fVi e tí)) (2. 1. 13.3) yieH*(F) y2e H*(F) D-congruence combines the omission criterion which Revzin uses in the French ver- sion of his own definition of quasi-word and the insertion criterion which P.S. Kuznecov employs when defining potential words. Two-way application of omission, or insertion, solves P.S. Kuznecov's clitics problem.6 D-congruence defines a partition of //*; the D-equivalence class to which fragment / belongs will be denoted as Dc(/). 1 Jassem 1960 (2): 37. 2 Revzin 1978 (1.2.1): 37. 3 Revzin 1978 (1.2.1): 38. 4 Revzin 1978 (1.2.3): 45. 5 Revzin 1978 (1.2.3): 45. 6 Cf. §2.1.11.</page><page sequence="322">300 PART 2 STRING MODELS As an example of D-congruence, consider górod ('town') and bol'Sój ('large'), which are D-congruent on the assumption that boFãój can always be inserted before góroá, fo'epciinaj] (zénSõinoj, 'woman, singular, instrumental') and [u] are D-congruent if we as- sume that [u] can be inserted after fo'epçiinoj] to yield frepçiinqju] {¿énSõinoju, 'woman, singular, instrumental') in all contexts. With the use of these concepts, Jassem's word model is formalized. First, a set BJ(h) of segmentations of a string h into quasi-words is given: BJ(h) = {(ÒJ, b2) | b{b2 = h A V V {biy2 e HA yfi2 e HA yxy2 e tí)} (2.1.13.4) y! e //IF) y2eH'F) Note how this differs from segmentations introduced before. Jassem's model intro- duces a set of segmentations for a string: each segmentation produces just one boundary. These boundaries are not joined into one segmentation, so that for all quasi-words of h either the first segment coincides with the first segment of h or the last segment coincides with the last segment of h. Consider as an example: (2/1/13/1) rabotai v górode 'worked in town' Set ßJ(2/l/13/l) contains at least three segmentations: BJ(2/ 1/13/1) = {rabóta(i)ì v górode, rabotai (2) v górode, rabotai v (3) górode, . . . } (2.1.13.5) The first segmentation can be motivated by the existence of strings such as (2/1/13/2) otdyxál v górode 'was on holiday in town' (2/1/13/3) rabótajudóma 'I work at home' (2/1/13/4) otdyxájudóma 'I rest at home' The second segmentation can be motivated by the existence of strings such as (2/1/13/4) and (2/1/13/5) rabotai dòma 'worked at home' (2/1/13/6) otdyxáju v górode 'I am on holiday in town' The third segmentation can be motivated by the existence of strings such as (2/1/13/7) govorjú o górode 'speak about the town' (2/1/13/8) rabotai v derévne 'worked in the village' (2/1/13/9) govorjú o derévne 'speak about the village* These commutations produce the quasi-words rabota, rabotai, rabotai v, 1 v górode, v górode, górode. The registration of only one boundary at a time prevents confusion of</page><page sequence="323">CHAPTER 2. 1: (SEGMENTATION) MODELS OF WORD' 30 1 types and tokens within a sentence, which was one of the drawbacks of Revzin's model.1 For each string ft, the set Cih) of its potential words contains the quasi-words b such that all fragments which have the same distribution as b are either equivalent or congruent with b, i.e. C[h) = {b|be H*ih) A V V «bi, b, b2) g Bih) A A (bi/b2 e //=&gt; / e D^b) U Dc(b)))} (2.1.13.6) bie/T b2etf* /e H* Since quasi-words include either the beginning or the end of a string in //, it is obvious that, for each b, either b' or b2 will be X.2 As examples which illustrate the concept of 'potential word1, consider (2/1/13/1) again. Quasi-word rabota is not a potential word, because it is not true that all frag- ments which can replace it, e.g. já otdyxá and ón otdyxá, are interchangeable in any contexts. Consider já otdyxáju CI rest') but *ón otdyxáju (a third person pronoun com- bined with a first person verb ending). The fragment v górode is considered a poten- tial word on the assumption that all fragments which can replace it (v derévne Cin the village'), na górode Con the town'), dòma, Cat home'), tarn ('there')) occur in the same contexts (já otdyxáju, já rabotai etc.). Finally, the set Wih) of words of a phrase h is defined as the set of potential words which cannot be split up into two other potential words of h, i.e. W(h) = {b | b e Cih) A A A ((b' e Úh) A b" e (M * b * b'b") } (2. 1. 13.7) b'e Cih) VeCih) Revzin calls the elements of Wih) phonetic words; by this, he apparently means that phonetic strings make up the substance for which they are defined. For an example, consider again (2/1/13/1). The whole of (2/1/13/1) of course makes up a potential word, as all phrases bounded by pauses can substitute each other in that context. The fragments rabotai and v górode are also potential words, which means that the whole of (2/1/13/1) is not an actual word. It follows that rabotai and v górode are actual words. As will be explained in §2.1.15, the definition makes it troublesome to provide examples that are more adequate and less trivial. S 2.1.14 Discussion of Jassem's word model: base component: meaning Most aspects of the base component of Jassem's model have already been dealt with when discussing Revzin's and P.S. Kuznecov's models. The abolition of phonic bound- aries and the clear-cut interpretation of H as the set of phonic strings bounded by pauses removes several of the fuzzy aspects of the other models. The most important innovation is Revzin's introduction of the relation R. By the in- troduction of the relation of identity of meaning between strings, Revzin has arrived at the complete analytical part of Quine's 1953 linguistic programme. In Quine's view, the only things a grammarian and a lexicographer can and must know about a lan- 1 Cf. example (2/1/4/29). 2 The symbol X indicates the empty set: cf. §2.0.2 for references.</page><page sequence="324">302 PART 2 STRING MODELS guage is which phonic strings have meaning (i.e. tí) and which strings are alike in meaning (i.e. R).[ Revzin has not gone beyond Quine's requirements. Meaning is intro- duced as a synthetic feature2 and determines an equivalence relation between strings, which implies that only one meaning (or non-decomposable set of meanings) is assigned to a string: relation R provides no solution for the homonymy problem pointed out in the discussion of P.S. Kuznecov's and Revzin's [1962a] model.3 Yet, it only is a small step now to assigning a set of possible meanings to a string in such a way that it can share meanings with another string without necessarily sharing all meanings of that other string.4 §2.1.15 Discussion of Jassem's word model: mathematical aspects of the development component First it must be clear that Revzin himself has stated that the model is yet to be verified in practice and, as a result, the definitions may require more precision.5 It is also im- portant to note that Jassem cannot be held responsible for the way in which his defi- nitions have been partly formalized. In fact, Jassem's model, as presented, contains several gaps, both mathematical and linguistic. The mathematical aspects of the model are discussed first. The definitions of D-equivalence and D-congruence as relations among any frag- ments of strings in //, irrespective of their location in specific strings, leave the door open for confusion between types and tokens as referred to in §2.1.4. And this is what happens. Consider the German example (2/1/15/1) Die Theater sind alt. 'the theatres are old1 It can safely be assumed that die qualifies as a quasi-word. Let us presume that the fragment diese can be substituted for it. If die is a potential word, one of the following conditions should be met. 1 Diese can precede or follow die in any context admitting die. 2 Die can precede or follow diese in any context admitting diese. 3 Diese can be substituted for die in any context admitting diese. Conditions 1 and 2 are obviously not applicable. Intuitively, 3 must be the case but since D-equivalence is defined for fragments, it must also apply in example (2/1/4/30) (er dient seinem Meistert, this is not the case, in view of the non-existence of (2/1/15/2) *Er diesent seinem Meister. As a possible solution, one might propose to apply the D-equivalence and D-congru- ence conditions only to quasi-words instead of arbitrary strings. But the definition of quasi-words also contains a gap: it does not exclude the possibility of fragments being substituted for themselves, so that quasi-word boundaries occur between every pair of phones. Introducing the condition that a fragment may not replace itself does not 1Quinel9612(3.1ff.):49ff. 2 Cf. §1.1.25. 3 Cf. §2.1.7 and §2.1.11. 4 This issue will be returned to in §4.1.27. 0 Revzin 1978 (1.2.3): 46.</page><page sequence="325">CHAPTER 2. 1: (SEGMENTATION) MODELS OF WORD' 303 really save the model, because there are many other trivial substitutions and there are no a priori criteria to distinguish between trivial and non-trivial cases. Revzin's example brat ([br'at], 'brother') is a case in point. Revzin states that it cannot be split up into quasi-words br and at because, although there are such strings as bróm ([br'om], 'bromine') and xládUxVaã, 'cold (marked style)'), there is no such string as *[x4-bm].1 Brat does, however, allow a split into the "quasi-words" b and rat in view of the exis- tence of, say, grád ([gr'at], 'hail'), borodá ([bsrAd'a], 'beard') and gorodá ([gsrAd'a], 'towns'), and a split into bra and t in view of the existence of kót ([k'ot], 'cat'), brái [br'ai], 'took') and kól ([k'o4], 'stake'). Revzin's example can even serve as a counter- example: there is a quasi-word boundary between br and át in view of the existence of kát ([k'at], 'cat (naval term)'), brusók ([brusbkj, 'bar') and kusók ([kus'ok], 'piece') or, for that matter, lád (U-'at], 'harmony'), bmd ([br'ot], 'ford') and lot ([Ibt], 'sounding-lead'). The distinguishing power of the definition is therefore low, and it is not clear what the concept of quasi-word contributes to the definition of 'word1. Finally, since quasi-words are defined as beginning from the first phone of a string or ending with the last one, since potential words are defined as a subset of the set of quasi-words, and since words are in turn a subset of the set of potential words, the formalization of the definition yields words only at the beginning and at the end of strings. This gap is removable; in fact Jassem's original contains a segmentation rule which prevents it.2 In view of the linguistic problems to be discussed in the next sec- tion, no proposals for formal amendments will be presented here. §2.1.16 Discussion of Jassem's word model: linguistic aspects of the development component The problem of distribution is discussed elsewhere.3 It is obvious that decisions on the distribution of words are often guided by the investigator's good will. In the extreme case, there will be a unique distribution for every quasi-word. Then, only those quasi- words will be potential words which occur in contexts admitting no other words, since in all other instances the condition that all words which occur in the same context must share all contexts will never be fulfilled. (But the definition of quasi-words sees to it that no quasi-words are unique in a context.) But even in a very liberal conception of distribution, things go wrong. Consider, again, example (2/1/13/1). There rabotai ('work, preterite singular masculine'), can be replaced by rabótala ('work, preterite singular feminine'), rabótaju ('work, present sin- gular first person'), rabótaet ('work, present singular third person'), etc. But every one of these fragments has a different distribution. Já CD excludes rabótaet, ón Che') ex- cludes rabótaju and rabótala; oná ('she') excludes rabótaju and rabotai Nor can the substitutes be combined to make up D-congruent pairs. Thus, in (2/1/13/1) the string rabotai will never reach the status of a potential word, let alone word status. This major linguistic gap makes the discussion of other gaps redundant. Let it only be noted that, like the other models, Jassem's does not handle homonymous strings 1 Revzin 1978 (1.2.3): 45. 2 Jassem 1960 (2): 47. 3 Cf. §2.0.7.</page><page sequence="326">304 PART 2: STRING MODELS having different word divisions. Jassem realizes this and gives some examples.1 He expects that they can be treated by means of a statistical procedure. S 2.1.17 Conclusion on word models The models presented here are the only attempts undertaken by exponents of the Set-theoretical School to provide a definition of the concept of 'word1. Setting aside models with an orthographic base, all other models consider words as given, either as basic units for morphological (i.e. morphosyntactic) and syntactic models the internal composition of which is left unspecified, or as strings of phones available for mor- phemic modelling. There are two circumstances which possibly explain the lack of interest of the Set- theoretical School in the definition of the fundamental unit of its morphological mod- els. On the one hand, set-theoretical linguistics is a by-product of groups of re- searchers who had been assembled to work on machine translation, where the defini- tion of 'word' is not at issue because spaces provide the only relevant divisions there. On the other hand, the discussion on the possibility of defining 'word' was traditional among the patriarchs of Russian linguistics, who left little ground for newcomers to play on.2 The available models have not exactly been successful. To the present writer's mind, most of the failures can be reduced to an unclear conception of modelling, which caused confusion of the defining properties of a concept and observable char- acteristics of the defined objects. It is of course possible to identify a concept with its observable characteristics, as the American structuralists did. Thus, Hockett (or rather Hockett 1958) has no problem defining 'word' as "any segment of a sentence bounded by successive points at which pausing is possible.3 The position of the Set- theoretical School is more ambivalent. On the one hand, their models are full of uni- versal quantifiers; if the model would be interpreted as an algorithm to be executed, this would require the impossible repeated inspection of all sentences of a language in order to apply a criterion to one single item. On the other hand, their primitives are limited to items which are usually classified as observable, and the models restrict themselves to the characteristics of words they contain; this does in fact suggest that they are only a discovery procedure and not a conceptual definition. This impression is reinforced by the fact that, at various points, Revzin, P.S. Kuznecov and Jassem more or less show that they already know what a word is, either implicitly (as when they switch between types and tokens, while ignoring fragments which have an incon- venient meaning or lack of meaning, such as die in dient) or explicitly (when a set of boundary signals is introduced). The conclusion is perhaps warranted that the Set- theoretical School is satisfied with approximating the concept of 'word' before making explicit what is approximated. It can be examined to what extent the phenomena which the Set-theoretical School employs in its models in order to identify words can reasonably be considered defining 1 Jassem 1960 (2): 47. ¿ To Peskovskij, for instance, 'word' was a "primary and fundamental unit of grammar" [Belov, A.I., 1958 (3.4): 95]. For a survey of 'word' in traditional grammar, see Vinogradov 19722 (0.2, 0.3): 10-23. 6 Hockett 1958 (19.2): 167.</page><page sequence="327">CHAPTER 2. 1: (SEGMENTATION) MODELS OF WORD' 305 properties. There are two kinds of phenomena which are in fact used by the Set-theo- retical School to approach the concept of word phonic phenomena, such as boundary signals and pauses, and distributional phenomena, such as insertion, omission and substitution. As to the phonic phenomena, it is quite natural that languages mark the boundaries of the units they employ, and it is quite natural that people communicating in a lan- guage will use the boundaries between units to pause and prepare the next unit of in- formation. But this does not mean that these options will be employed by languages and users in a way which predicts the phenomena which facilitate them.1 1 The rejection of Revziris and P.S. Kuznecov's phonic criteria for the determination of words does not of course imply that they are devoid of linguistic interest, but only that they cannot be substituted for more abstract defining properties. On the contrary, being empirical phenomena, phonic boundary signals and (potential) pauses are probably of greater intrinsic linguistic interest than the abstract and deductive defini- tions in this study, both as objects of linguistic description and as clues for hypotheses on the structure of specific languages. Consider, as an example, the insertion of non-contour-breaking pauses after the ortho- graphic plural indicators in the idiolect of one French informant as sorted out by the present writer, and as demonstrated with the following sentence. (2/1/17/1) Nous avons étudié les enfants étrangers en France. 'we have studied the foreign children in France' The plural indicator shows four different types of behaviour with respect to hesitation pauses. They are the following. 1 ItJ between nous and avons, which is obligatory even when a pause is inserted; in the latter case, /z/ is realized after the pause. Identical behaviour is shown by the ItJ between les and enfants: in case of pauses, the obligatory /z/ is realized in unity with enfants. 2 ItJ between enfants and étrangers is obligatory if no pause is inserted and optional if a pause is inserted; in the latter case, /z/ is realized after the pause. 3 ItJ between avons and étudié is optional when no pause is inserted and is never realized when a pause is inserted 4 Orthographic s of étrangers is never pronounced in this sentence. According to these data, CPLURAL&gt; /z/ is realized after, not before, possible pauses, if realized at all. Also, the degree of resistance to omission of the plural marker is related to the plurality of the word following it, rather than the word preceding it: ItJ is obligatory before a plural verb form and a plural noun (beginning with a vowel), and is only optionally omitted after a pause before an adjective which depends on a plural noun. On the other hand, it is absent before an adverbial phrase and only optionally realized without a pause before the verb form étudié. These data have been produced and tested out with only one informant and cannot of course be general- ized, but it is interesting to see that they are compatible with an explanation which is so old that it was already disputed by Jespersen [1924 (6): 95, footnote 1]. The hypothesis is that the liaison of French gram- mar covers two different phenomena, which are the following. 1 Morphological liaison: a plural indicator ItJ may be inserted before words which begin with a vowel. This ItJ is obligatory for head words. Morphological liaison is illustrated by behavioral type 1 and applies even to vocative expressions: the informant, a schoolteacher, addresses the class with Les en- fants! Number concord, on the other hand, becomes optional after pauses, as is illustrated by behavioral type 2. 2 Syntactic liaison: certain close syntactic relations between successive words ending and beginning with a vowel can be marked by consonants. These consonants are determined by the preceding lexeme. Thus, I'J appears with est ('is') in phrase (2/1/17/2) below, while ItJ appears with sans ('without'), and In/ after IKI of aucun Cany') in (2/1/17/3): (2/1/1 7/2) C'est une surprise 'that's a surprise' (2/1/1 7/3) Sans aucun adieu 'without any goodbye' The use of ItJ after avons (type 3) is an example of syntactic liaison. The relation between étrangers and en France is apparently not one of the close syntactic relations which can be marked by syntactic</page><page sequence="328">306 PART 2- STRING MODELS As to the distributional phenomena, it is quite probable that 'word1 must be intrinsi- cally defined in terms of its syntactic function, which may partly be reflected in its distributional properties. But this determines only its external definition; it cannot solve the problem of recognizing different tokens of the same type which caused the complications in determining the distribution of identified strings and the failure of all models to distinguish between homonymous strings. This problem can be solved only if a preliminary internal definition is given of the units whose distribution is defined. The conclusion must be that Revzin, P.S. Kuznecov and Jassem do not actually de- fine 'word' but satisfy themselves with an approximation of one-to-one correspon- dence between words and units which have been modelled. This conclusion is con- firmed by their invocation of statistical methods wherever the model sharply contra- dicts common sense. Wherever models are at the same time invoked to decide on complex questions such as that of the French clitic pronouns, the model becomes methodologically self-contradictory: one cannot use for solving an issue a model which at the same time is admitted to fall short of common sense in another issue. This methodological self-contradiction is by no means restricted to the Set-theoretical School or to linguistics; it is much more wide-spread in the applied social sciences. In all cases the main sin is that approximation methods are set up for objects and con- cepts before the concepts themselves are defined.1 liaison. The closeness of such relations is cancelled by the occurrence of thinking pauses, which pre- clude any syntactic liaison phenomena (cf. type 3). (Of course there are syntagms, such as numeral expressions, where the number distinction is neutralized, as in Hungarian, even though it is indicated in the French orthography. In numeral expressions, occurrences of ItJ are instances of syntactic liaison, conditioned by the individual numeral lexemes. This is illustrated by the behaviour of the word œuf ('egg'), which has two variants, /œf/ and I0l. As documented by Swiggers [1985: 631, speech variant l0l is used after /z/, whether or not Izl is the plural indicator or part of the pre- ceding numeral, while variant /œf/ is used elsewhere. Thus, six œufs ('six eggs') is pronounced /siz0/, while sept œufs ('seven eggs') is pronounced /setœf/. Most French speakers consulted by the present writer were, incidentally, not prepared to endorse Swiggers' data, although some admitted having heard such things.) Note that both the analysis given of the effects of pauses and the proposed explanation are tentative. It only goes to show that the study of pauses can provide relevant cues for linguistic analysis. 1 An example is the use in science policy of bibliometric indicators devised to measure research quality. On the one hand, the investigators who develop the methods recognize the failure of their models in many in- dividual cases and refer to overall statistical correctness and imaginable statistical refinements to salvage their models; on the other hand, the application of the models by policy makers resolves issues involving the exceptions to the model in a way which removes the exceptions. Thus, any self -contradictory models, once applied, become self-fulfilling prophecies, to the satisfaction of everyone who survives.</page><page sequence="329">CHAPTER 2.2: WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS §2.2.1 Contexts This chapter discusses some derivations which classify the occurrences of words in linear strings belonging to a language.

The second possibility has given rise to a vast number of models of morphological categories, which are dis- cussed in Part 2 and Part 3. There is an essential difference, from the viewpoint of model structure, between configuration modelling and morphological (morphosyntac- tic) modelling. The former method deals with the admission of strings in other strings, i.e. of tokens in tokens. The models must provide not only an external definition of the categories involved, but also an internal one. In this respect, the models face the same problems as the models of 'word' discussed in Chapter 2.1. The morphological models, on the other hand, operate with admitted strings, viz. words, the correspon- ding types of which are given: for each occurrence of a word in a string in //, it is known to which type it belongs. Syntactic and morphological modelling were developed separately and indepen- dently until the introduction of dependency structure, the only apparent exception being one of Revzin's case models.1 In this model, which Revzin applies to German, the set of permissible strings is a subset of //*(W) the elements of which can be strings of words of indefinite length. They may be interpreted as nominal groups {gruppa sitâõe- stvitel'nogo); examples: (2/2/1/1) die Freiheit "(the) freedom' (2/2/1/2) seine endlich eroberte Freiheit 'his freedom which was attained at last1 However, this model in fact belongs to the third type listed above: the noun groups are a part of the base component. They are given as types and replace the set of words in the model, so that the base component coincides with flj from a structural point of view.2 This is the only available model which belongs to the third type. Part 2 and Part 3 will only discuss instances where h$ is a one-word string. The set K of contexts as employed in these parts will therefore be a subset of the set KQ of grammatical pairs of strings and contain the contexts which admit only single words: K= {(hi, h2) I (hi, h2) e K* A V hiwh2 &lt;= H] (2.2.1.4) WE W Note that, the empty string X being included in //*(W), both hi and h2 may be empty. S 2.2.2 Distribution The set-theoretical models of this chapter are based on the distribution of words over contexts. It is considered to be known for each word whether it is admitted by a given context. The contexts which admit a word w are expected to determine linguistically relevant properties of w. Conversely, elements of the set of (grammatical) contexts 1 Revzin 1960b (1-4): 82-83. 2 Revzin's complete model structurally coincides with DobruSin's model, which will be discussed in §2.2.18.</page><page sequence="331">CHAPTER 2.2 WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 309 can be characterized by the fact that they admit certain words and refuse others, as will be discussed in Chapter 2.3. A mathematical apparatus and terminology have been developed by the Set-theo- retical School in order to describe the distributional properties of words and contexts. We are in fact dealing with a feature system where, for each word w and for each context {h', hi), the truth or falsehood of the predicate 'hiwh2e rí' (2.2.2.1) determines a feature for both w and (hi, hi). The feature system yields its corresponding synthetic features: relations defined within W and K, and class systems defined over W and K. In the distributional ap- proach, these relations within sets reflect different types of substitution {commuta- tion; subst Mutability, vzaimozameSdaemost', zameèõaemost'1), and the classes which are derived from these relations receive linguistic labels such as elementary gram- matical category, case, or gender. One may wonder why gender1 and case', rather than other linguistic categories, are related to distribution and substitution. Some reasons are suggested here. The only possible deductive approach for a linguistic conception which regards language as no more than a set of types and a constrained set of strings of tokens is the analysis of the restriction phenomenon: the observation that the set of grammati- cal phrases, being an infinite subset of the free monoid of the set of words, is deter- mined through specification of the restrictions on the possible combinations of ele- ments of the alphabet. The fact that not all (or any) strings over W are necessarily phrases, implies that there are elements such that there are contexts which do not admit those elements and, conversely, that there are contexts such that there are el- ements which they do not admit: elements impose restrictions on contexts and vice versa. Once the elements are interpreted as words, it is obvious that morphosyntactic categories of traditional grammar are likely candidates for the status of elementary grammatical category. The noun-centered tradition of set-theoretical morphology was already set by the first K-questions,2 which probably triggered an interest in nominal categories. Also, the verbal categories of Russian and related languages are traditionally described as having a meaning which is simple to define and a distribution which is primarily de- termined by their meaning; the meanings of nominal categories, on the other hand, are traditionally described as vague or non-existent, which makes it much more meaning- ful to examine these in terms of distributional restrictions. Consider two examples which illustrate the restriction properties which are commonly attributed to 'gender1 and case1. If a word of a given gender, say feminine, is used, it often happens that words which co-occur with it in a sentence agree with it and take certain endings. Thus, Russian contains the phrases (2/2/2/1) and {2/2/2/2), * VzaimozameSõaemost' and zameSöaemost' were introduced into set-theoretical linguistics in Gladkij 1963b. ¿ Cf. §1.0.1.</page><page sequence="332">3 1 0 PART 2: STRING MODELS (2/2/2/1) málenicaja kníga 'small book* (2/2/2/2) málerfkij stúl 'small chair' whereas the combinations (2/2/2/3) and (2/2/2/4) are ungrammatical: (2/2/2/3) 'málen'kijkníga (2/2/2/4) *málen'kaja stúl Thus, the noun imposes restrictions on the words which can occur in its environment: the noun functions as a selector for contexts. On the other hand, the use of a given case is often conditioned by words which co- occur with it in the sentence. For example, in (2/2/2/5) Já bojús' eelovéka 'I fear the man' the noun õelovéka ('man') is in the genitive case because it is used in combination with bojús' TI fear'). Compare (2/2/2/6) Já pomogáju õelovéku. 'I help the man' where the dative case form õelovéku is used because it is connected with pomogáju, which takes the dative. Again, the combinations (2/2/2/7) and (2/2/2/8) are ungram- matical: (2/2/2/7) *Já bojüs' õelovéku. (2/2/2/8) *Já pomogáju õelovéka. Here we see that the words of an environment impose restrictions on the form of the noun: the contexts functions as a selector for nouns. Note that such clear restrictions are much rarer for categories which are typically associated with verbs. Even with adverbs like võerá ('yesterday'), the use of the pre- sent tense is not excluded. The restrictions which the environment imposes on a verb usually apply to all of its forms indiscriminately. For example, the subordinate clause marker oto ('that') can be combined with any form of govorft' ('say1) but with no form of spat* ('sleep'). Many set-theoretical models are attempts, on the basis of the above observations, to tie the "mechanism" of restriction with the concepts of case and gender. In the course of the development of set-theoretical modelling, this connection becomes more and more indirect. Of course, set-theoretical modelling does not restrict its ambitions to explaining the behaviour of nouns. Generally speaking, the results of case and gender modelling are applied in two ways. 1 'Case and 'gender' are conceived of in an abstract sense so as to cover restriction properties of different parts of speech. The labels which Revzin reserves for such generalized categories of case and gender are kazus1 and genus.2 Such concepts 1 Revzin 1967b (6.43): 153ff. &lt;- Revzin 1967b (6.46): 163ff.</page><page sequence="333">CHAPTER 2.2 WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 3 1 1 enable us to regard prepositional and verbal government as instances of abstract gender1 (selection from the point of view of the selector) and gender1 of adjectives as an instance of abstract case1 (selection from the point of view of the selected word). 2 Definitions of part of speech1 and noun1 are provided, or assumed to be provided as preliminary to the definition of case1 and 'gender1, which is restricted to nouns or nominais. The two approaches can be combined. S 2.2.3 Word substitution In the previous section, we have seen that the relation between W and K determines two feature systems. This chapter discusses the feature system which is determined for the set of words.1 This system is the prototype for later models of gender". The la- bel gender will not be used for the derivations of this chapter, because the results are still too general to justify or emphasize their similarity with the linguistic category of gender. Two preliminary definitions are necessary. Set K[w) is the set of contexts which admit a word m Khv) = {(hh h2) | (hlf h2) e KAhiwh2 e H] (2.2.3.1) Set W(fc) contains the words which are admitted by a context fc, where k = (hi, h2). It is defined as follows. Wft) = {w ' w g W A h'wh2 e //} (2.2.3.2) The simplest system of classes which is determined over W by the feature system which can be produced by means of predicate (2.2.2.1) is set K' of feature classes;2 here all F-equivalent3 contexts are eliminated and replaced by the membership of a class Wj for each set of F-equivalent contexts, i.e. K' = { Wt | Wt c W A V Wi = W(h i, h2) } (2.2.3.3) {H',h2)eK Thus, each context is replaced as a feature by the class of words which are admitted by it. Two contexts which are F-equivalent will yield the same class in K'. Through the substitution of these classes for features, and turning class membership into a fea- ture, F-equivalent features are collapsed. An example: consider a set K which con- tains: (u menjä ést' ') (2.2.3.4) 'I have', literally 'with me is1 (u tebjá ést' ') (2.2.3.5) 'you have', literally 'with you is' It is reasonable to expect that 1 Its counterpart for the set of contexts will be discussed in Chapter 2.3. 2 Feature class % 1.1.24.1. d F-equivalence see § 1.1.22.</page><page sequence="334">3 1 2 PART 2 STRING MODELS WÍ2.2.3.4) = WÍ2.2.3.5) (2.2.3.6) i.e. that they admit the same words. Therefore they will be collapsed into one feature by the application of K'. Set K' contains Greenberg's contextual classes.1 The classes of K' do not possess any special property. They can overlap each other, include each other, etc.2 The only special properties they reflect are properties of contexts (viz. F-equivalence). For this reason they are part of case models rather than models of 'gender'; they will ap- pear in Chapter 2.3.3 More interest is suspected for the equivalence, tolerance and dominance relations that are determined directly by the feature system in W, and for the equivalence and tolerance relations that can be derived from the tolerance and dominance relations which have been defined directly. The direct relations have been listed in various terminologies by Berka &amp; Novak4 and by Sestier.5 They are the following: 1 substitutability tolerance; 2 substitutability equivalence; 3 substitutability dominance. These relations will be discussed in this order in the following sections. S 2.2.4 Substitutability tolerance The relation Tw of substitutability tolerance or T-subst it utabilit y holds between ele- ments of W, and is defined as follows. Tw = {(wh W2&gt; | w' g W A w2 e W A !&amp;w{l n Khvd *0} (2.2.4.1) Thus, lui and u&gt;2 are Tsubstitutable if there is a context which admits both w' and w^. In § 1.1.24, it was shown that F-tolerance yields two systems of tolerance classes: a system of F-tolerance classes in which all elements of a class share at least one fea- ture, and a system of canonical tolerance classes where each pair of elements of a class possesses at least one common feature. Each system of tolerance classes de- termines its nucleus partition and its transitive closure. The transitive closures yielded by the two systems of tolerance classes coincide. None of these secondary partitions necessarily coincides with the partition yielded by F-equivalence, which is discussed in the next section. This type of substitutability was identified by Chomsky,6 who later refers to it as substitutability /.7 Of course, many linguists had implicitly employed the negation of substitutability tolerance for a long time: this relation coincides with what is commonly 1 Greenberg 1957 ('' 9. 2 See §1.124.1. 3 I.e. as sets of words which are admitted by a kappa family: see §2.3.3 and §2.3.8. 4 Berka &amp; Novak 1963 (2.3h 138. 5 Sestier 1961 (3.2): 301. 6 Chomsky 1953 (Ih 243. 7 Chomsky 1959: 204.</page><page sequence="335">CHAPTER 2.2 WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 3 13 called complementary distribution. Canonical substitutability tolerance classes were introduced by Harris as uniting elements in equivalent environments.1 The concept of T-substitutability and its derivatives are rarely used in (morphosyntactic) set-theoretical modelling.2 This is explained by the fact that substi- tutability tolerance eliminates dependent features as well as equivalent features, and preserves only the independent features: it employs contexts which are least specific. This is shown in the following example. Let K contain the contexts (2.2.3.4) and (2.2.3.5), as well as the following contexts. {já govorjú pro, X) (2.2.4.2) 'I talk about', takes accusative (já víiu, X) (2.2.4.3) 'I see', takes accusative Also, K will be assumed to contain the empty context: the context which consists of two empty strings: (X, X) (2.2.4.4) The empty context is relevant to morphosyntactic modelling for languages which al- low one or more single words to occur as independent phrases. Furthermore, let W contain the following words. stól 'table, nominative or accusative* stúl 'chair, nominative or accusative' karéta 'coach, nominative' karétu 'coach, accusative' minútoõka 'minute, nominative' minútoõku 'minute, accusative' (2.2.4.5) Admission relations can be expressed in terms of W(/c) as defined in (2.2.3.2). Let the following admissions be assumed. WÍ2.2.3.4) = W(2.2.3.5) = {stól stúl karéta, minútoõka} W(2.2.4.2) = WÍ2.2.4.3) = {stól stúl karétu, minútoõku} WÍ2.2.4.4) = W (2.2.4.6) In the present example, it is assumed that the accusatives karétu and minútoõku can occur as independent phrases, which is actually the case in Russian: the use of the accusative conveys a message which can be interpreted in concrete situations as, say, 'get me a (coach)', 'wait a (minute)'. The example yields a set of feature classes K' containing three feature sets: K' = { {stól stúl karéta, minútoõka}, {stól, stúl, karétu, minútoõku}, W} (2.2.4.7) Since there is a common feature set for all words, viz. W, the relation of substitutabil- ity tolerance coincides with the cartesian square of W (i.e. contains all pairs of ele- 1 Harris 1952 (2.12): 6.

Thus, substitutability tolerance makes the least specific contexts, such as the empty context, determine classes: it eliminates more specific contexts which might yield empirically more interesting class systems. In fact, the empty context will only just fail to unite the actual set of Russian nouns into one T-substitutability class: the only Russian noun forms which are not obviously admitted by (X, X) are the locative forms. The word lése ('wood, locative1) is exclusively admitted by certain contexts, which contain certain prepositions; for example: iétogo ne byváet pri, X) (2.2.4.8) 'that does not occur near1, 'that does not occur with', 'that does not occur in the presence of The systems which are derived from substitutability tolerance will not be discussed, since they can only reduce the number of features taken into account. Note that the relevance of substitutability tolerance becomes totally different once semantic units are included in the base component. Then, contexts which allow for the largest number of words are most diagnostic with respect to the meaning of the words. The utterance (2/2/4/1) Karétu! "(get me?) a coach' where the accusative is stripped of its contextual restrictions, is one of the examples which were used by Jakobson to illustrate the meanings of the Russian cases.1 It may of course be said that Jakobson's meaning ('action, directed at the noun') is that of evoking a verb on which the accusative depends, but as long as no specific verb is evoked, Jakobson's meaning of the accusative is the only meaning that can be recorded for the accusative in (2/2/4/1). § 2.2.5 Substitutability equivalence: families The relation £w of substitutability equivalence among the elements of W is defined as follows. Ew = {{wh w2) | u&gt;i e W A w2 e W A Kiw{) = K{w2) } (2.2.5.1) Thus, W[ and w2 are E-substitutable if they are admitted and refused by the same contexts. This second type of substitutability was probably introduced into linguistics by Bar-Hillel.2 Chomsky refers to it as substitutability 2? It has a long tradition in set- theoretical linguistics.

DobruSin calls the classes of this partition simply equivalence classes.1 Kulagina coins the term family (semejstvo).2 Marcus sometimes employs the term distributional class.3 In the present study, family will be used, which has become the most common term in the So- viet literature on the subject.4 Revzin illustrates the concept of family with a simple example from Indonesian,5 an adapted version of which will be produced presently.6 Indonesian possesses counting words or classifiers, which are part of the numeral system. Classifiers vary according the noun determined by the numeral. Thus, in the phrase7 (2/2/5/1) Saya ambii ayam dua ekor. 'I take chicken two CLASSIFIER', i.e. 'I take two chickens' the word dua ('two'), in determining ayam Chen1), is accompanied by the classifier ekor, which literally means 'tail'. In (2/2/5/2) Saya ambii pinsii dua batang. 'I take pencil two CLASSIFIER1, i.e. 'I take two pencils' dua, in determining pinsii ("pencil1), is accompanied by the classifier batang, which lit- erally means 'stem1. Consequently, Indonesian possesses contexts containing classi- fiers which admit certain words and exclude other words. Although there are contexts which admit all nouns (viz. contexts without classifiers), the discriminating contexts which contain a classifier determine the families of the nouns,8 the discriminating contexts being dependent features. Consider the following contexts:9 (saya ambii, dua orang) (2.2.5.3) •I take'; 'two classifier MAN' (saya ambii, dua ekor) (2.2.5.4) 'I take'; 'two classifier TAIL ' 1 DobruSin 1957. 2 Kulagina I960: 232; 1958: 206. 3 Cf. Marcus 1967a (1.4* 6. 4 Thus, the use of family in this study deviates from that in Bar-Hillel 1950/1964 (1.1.7): 26, which de- notes a class in the transitive closure of substitutability dominance (see (2.2.25.4)). 5 Revzin 1966b (3.23): 64f. 6 Three circumstances necessitated adaptation: 1 Revzin's orthography is now outdated. 2 Some of Revzin's lexicon is regional (like manuk for 'hen', which is Banjarmasin Malay). 3 More importantly, as a result of the rapid formation and spread of the standard language, the whole classifier system is subject to attrition and simplification; Revzin's classifier buah (originally 'fruit'), for example, is nowadays used as a general classifier for inanimate objects. Nevertheless, Indonesian can still be used as an illustration of the family concept. The present example draws on Omar's [1972/1975] description of the Indonesian classifier system. 7 The pattern of (2/2/5/1) and the following phrases is found in Omar 1972/1975 (7.2): 255. 8 But not contexts containing the general classifier buah (literally 'fruit'), which can be replaced by more discriminating classifiers, depending on the counted word. 9 The contexts do not represent the complete set of classifiers. Omar [1972/1975 (7.2-8): 254-255] points out that only orang and ekor are obligatory under all circumstances, while batang and pucuk are nowadays only obligatory with certain nouns. However, she also points out that all classifiers are still obligatory in phrases with the structure HEAD - MODIFIER - NUMERAL , which is the structure reflected in contexts (2.2.5.3) to (2.2.5.5).</page><page sequence="338">3 1 6 PART 2- STRING MODELS (saya ambii dua batang) (2.2.5.5) 'I take'; 'two classifier STEM* (saya ambii dua pucuk) (2.2.5.6) 'I take'; 'two classifier OFFSHOOT' Each of these contexts admits words which are not admitted by each of the other contexts: WÍ2.2.5.3) = {mahasiswa, murid, dewi, . . . } (2.2.5.7) 'student'; 'pupil'; 'goddess' W(2.2.5.4) = {ayam, kuda, hartmau, . . . } (2.2.5.8) 'hen'; 'horse'; 'tiger* WÍ2.2.5.5) = {pinsil pohon, ...} (2.2.5.9) 'pencil; 'tree' W(2.2.5.6) = {surat, bedil ...} (2.2.5.10) 'letter*; 'gun' If W would contain just the words given above, each of the above subsets of nouns would include at least one family; the addition of other contexts cannot change this result. It is obvious that 'family' as a concept is not language-specific, although it is pos- sible that it will be trivial in some languages. The families of some languages appear to approach the conception of gender' as pointed out in % 2.2.2. From the viewpoint of mathematical structure, the Indonesian example is not very different from the follow- ing fragment of Russian.

The Indonesian example also presents certain problems, which are illustrated in §2.2.26. S 2.2.6 Russian noun families: preliminary selection of contexts In §2.2.6 to §2.2.10, a more elaborate example will be presented featuring the families of the Russian noun. Although a great deal has been written on families, no attempt is known to provide a more or less complete result for a fragment of a language.1 How- ever elaborate, the present example will be only slightly less artificial than the Indo- nesian example, but it will do to illustrate the potential of the concept of substitutabil- ity equivalence as envisaged by its authors, as well as a number of major complica- tions. The material presented below is based on a fragment of Russian. Set W contains Russian nouns; set H contains basic phrases of the type SUBJECT - VERB - COM- PLEMENT, extended with possible adjectives and prepositional clauses. For presenta- tional purposes, both W and H have been limited even further by the exclusion of ele- ments which are expected to be F-independent and by the inclusion of only one sample element from each set of elements expected to be F-equivalent. Thus, since it is expected that (2.2.5.12) and, say, (2.2.6.1) below admit the same words, the latter will not be included. (u tebjánóvyiX) (2.2.6.1) 'you have a new (masculine)' Also, contexts which are expected to be F-independent will be excluded. Thus, (2.2.3.4) is not included in the set of contexts, because it is not expected to yield a family of its own if (2.2.5.12), (2.2.5.13) and (2.2.5.14), as well as (2.2.6.2) below are in- cluded. (u menjá nôvye, X) (2.2.6.2) 'I have new (plural)' Note that what is described here is not a formal procedure to single out differential contexts. The above selection of contexts is an informal short cut, made for practical and presentational purposes and in anticipation of the results of the model. This prac- tice of informal preliminary selection of contexts is not to be confused with the estab- lishment of sets of diagnostic phrases, as discussed in §2.0.8. In the latter instance, the question was whether it is legitimate to construct definitions which explicitly in- volve the use of proper subsets of H instead of H. Here, a subset of H is only used in- stead of H to construct a simple example which fits such a definition. It may still be wondered to what extent this practice is warranted. If preliminary selection of contexts can cause so many distortions that the results no longer illus- trate a feasible linguistic state of affairs, the example loses its explanatory function. There are three conceivable discrepancies between the results of the model for the 1 But Zaliznjak [1967b (2.2-2.10): 36-55] and Sed'ko [1971a, 1971b] have of course provided complete and exact results for Russian based on models with more complex base components.

Uff.</page><page sequence="340">3 1 8 PART 2 STRING MODELS complete set of Russian contexts and the results of application of the model to a lim- ited set of contexts. 1 The set of families which results when the complete set of contexts is taken into account is a refinement of the set of families produced by selected contexts. 2 The set of families which results when the complete set of contexts is taken into account is an amalgamation of the set of families produced by selected contexts. 3 The set of families which results when the complete set of contexts is taken into account is neither a refinement nor an amalgamation of the set of families which is produced by a set of selected contexts. It is obvious that the addition of unforeseen contexts to the operational K cannot in- duce mergers of established families: if the existence of a context which admits w' and precludes W2 has been established, as a result of which w' and 1U2 belong to different families, the addition of new contexts cannot undo the difference between the sets of contexts which admit w' and w^ This means that possibilities 2 and 3 are excluded. If, however, new contexts are added which are F-dependent, established families can be split up as a result. Therefore the set of families can only become finer with the addition of new contexts. This is in fact what happened in the course of the sixties: linguistics came up with new differential contexts which cancelled the original results which had satisfied the mathematicians.1 Thus, since the set of contexts of the Russian example to be presented in § 2.2.7 is not complete, it would be more correct to speak of potential families, analogous to Revzin's potential words.2 Since, however, the complete set of contexts will never be fully inspected, any concrete example will yield only potential families. This enables us to adopt without risk of confusion the convention of using the term family for the potential families yielded in exemplificative exercises. Besides contexts which are excluded because they are expected to be F-indepen- dent or F-equivalent, certain other types of contexts are left out of consideration in the example, either because of their controversial status or for the sake of presenta- tional simplicity. They include the following. 1 Contexts which are derived from Z-phrases:3 more specifically contexts which contain relative clauses. These will be referred to as Z-contexts. Here are some examples: (já govorjú o nóvyx, odín iz kotóryx) (2.2.6.3) 'I talk about the new', 'one (masculine) of which' (já govorjú o nóvyx, odná iz kotóryx) (2.2.6.4) 'I talk about the new', 'one (feminine) of which' Context (2.2.6.3) admits plural forms of masculine words and (2.2.6.4) admits plural forms of feminine words which are generally felt to belong to the same family on the basis of contexts such as (já govorjú o nóvyx, ') (2.2.6.5) 'I talk about the new' 1 Marcus' models of gender' are examples. His model of 'concrete gender provided four genders.

As a case in point Revzin mentions the noun ovladénie ('seizure'),2 which is derived from the verb ovladét* ('seize'): the object seized is in the instrumental case for both ovladét1 and ovladénie. Thus, the context (já smotrél na, dómom) (2.2.6.7) 'I watched1, 'house (instrumental)' admits ovladénie (to obtain 'I watched the seizure of the house') but refuses oknó, which does not take an instrumental. 4 A group of contexts which contains numerals: mainly the numerals ending in 2, 3, or 4 (except those ending in 12, 13 and 14). Examples: (u menjá ésf dvá,') (2.2.6.8) 'I have two (masculine or neuter)' (u menjá èst1 dvé, X) (2.2.6.9) 'I have two (feminine)' (u menjá est* trît') (2.2.6.10) 'I have three' These numerals normally take the genitive singular of the objects counted and would not yield separate families, but a few nouns show deviant behaviour here:3 a masculine and neuter substantivized adjectives, such as celkóvyj ('silver ruble') and podleíáSõee ('grammatical subject'), appear in the genitive plural (celkóvyx, podleíáSõix) in contexts (2.2.6.8) and (2.2.6.10); b feminine substantivized adjectives, such as masterskája ('workshop') appear in the nominative plural (masterskie) or genitive plural (masterskix) in contexts (2.2.6.9) and (2.2.6.10); c a few masculine nouns possess counting forms (sdetnaja forma) which are used in these contexts only: the regular genitive of Cas ('hour') is tasa, but the form õasá appears in (2.2.6.8) and (2.2.6.10). The exclusion of all of the above contexts is informal: it is not implied that a model must ignore the contexts. Within the framework of the model their exclusion can only be justified by the simplicity consideration: the examples must illustrate the principles and intentions of the model as clearly as possible. From a linguistic viewpoint, types 1 and 2 represent varieties of Whorf's covert categories, as was pointed out in §2.0.8.

In the fuzzy contexts of type 2, we have to presume a conflict between an overt category of gender, which is manifest in close syntactic relations, and a more covert category of sex, which is manifest in looser relations and is comparable to sex as a category in English, which is manifest in contexts such as (the, hurt himself) (2.2.6.11) [the, hurt herself) (2.2.6.12) when (2.2.6.1 1) is assumed to admit only nouns which may refer to males, and (2.2.6.12) is assumed to admit only nouns which may refer to females. In Whorf's terms, the example of the Russian noun families will be restricted to the most overt categories of the Russian noun. Type 3 cannot be explained in terms of overtness and covertness. To begin with, it is not clear whether the exclusion of oknó by (2.2.6.7) must affect the model. This de- pends on the conception of grammatically used: it may be argued that, if a phrase like (2/2/6/1) piafe kólokolom 'dress (nominative) bell (instrumental)1, i.e. 'bell-shaped dress1 is acceptable, there are no grammatical reasons for rejecting (2/2/6/2) ?oknódómom 'window (nominative) house (instrumental)' Phrase (2/2/6/2) must mean something like 'a window which shares a standardized set of formal properties with a typical house'. An informant of the present writer sponta- neously visualized such a window, after having been conditioned by (2/2/6/1). On the other hand, it is more troublesome to apply such reasoning to nouns with special government properties involving conjunctions, prepositions or infinitives. Russian grammarians use the term strong parataxis (siVnoe primykanie) for this phe- nomenon. The context (egóy õto oná priédet) (2.2.6.13) 'his'; 'that she will come' naturally admits such nouns as predpolozénie ('assumption'), but a grammatical con- ception according to which (2.2.6.13) admits oknó is quite implausible. It seems that government can only be discussed properly by a semantic conception which separates the meaningless use of prepositions and cases, as is so with strong government, from their meaningful uses. Such a semantic conception is not available for the present model. The inclusion of contexts (2.2.6.7) and (2.2.6.13) and their non-admission of oknó would result in the addition of new families for every combination of gender', number', case and government pattern for derived nouns. Each government pattern produces an additional family for each family. These families are left out of consideration in the present chapter.1 1 They will be returned to in §3.1.5ff. and §4.5.4.</page><page sequence="343">CHAPTER 2.2 WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 32 1 Finally, contexts of type 4 allow interference with case1 and gender1 on the part of number1. This phenomenon is abstracted from in the examples, as will be pointed out in §2.2.8. § 2.2.7 Russian noun families: contexts In view of the considerations given in §2.2.6, set K of the example need not contain more than 25 differential contexts. The following have been selected. (u menjá èst' bol'Sój, X) (2.2.7. 1) 'I have a large (masculine)' (u menjá èst' bol'Sóe, X) (2.2.7.2) 'I have a large (neuter)' (u menjá èst' bol'Sája, X) (2.2.7.3) 'I have a large (feminine)' (u menjá èst' bol'Síe, X) (2.2.7.4) 'I have large (plural)' Contexts (2.2.7.1), (2.2.7.2) and (2.2.7.3) admit the nominative singular forms of the re- spective genders; context (2.2.7.4) admits nominative plural forms of all genders. (u bol'Sógo, èst' nedostátok) (2.2.7.5) 'the large (masculine or neuter)', 'has a defect'; literally 'with large', 'is defect' (u bol'Sój, ést' nedostátok) (2.2.7.6) 'the large (feminine)', 'has a defect'-, literally 'with large', 'is defect' (u bol'Six, èst' nedostátok) (2.2.7.7) 'the large (plural)', 'have a defect'; literally 'with large', 'is defect' Contexts (2.2.7.5), (2.2.7.6) and (2.2.7.7) admit ordinary genitives of the distinct genders and numbers. It is important to add (u menjá net, X) (2.2.7.8) 'I have no', literally 'with me is not' which admits any partitive (or genitive ID forms besides the ordinary genitive (or genitive D forms. (já obraSõájus' k bol'Sómu, X) (2.2.7.9) 'I turn to a large (masculine or neuter)' {já obraSõájus' k bol'Sôj, X) (2.2.7. 10) 'I turn to a large (feminine)' (já obraSõájus' k bol'Sím, X) (2.2.7. 1 1 ) 'I turn to large (plural)' Contexts (2.2.7.9), (2.2.7.10) and (2.2.7.11) admit the datives of the distinct genders and numbers. (já govorjú pro bol'Sój, X) (2.2.7. 12) 'I talk about a large (masculine inanimate)' (já govorjú pro bol'Sógo, X) (2.2.7. 13) 'I talk about a large (masculine animate)' (já govorjú pro bol'Sóe, X) (2.2.7. 14) 'I talk about a large (neuter)'</page><page sequence="344">322 PART 2 STRING MODELS (já govorjú pro bol'Súju, X) (2.2.7. 15) 'I talk about a large (feminine)' (já govorjú pro bol'Síe, X) (2.2.7. 16) 'I talk about large (plural inanimate)' (já govorjú pro bol'Six, X) (2.2.7. 17) 'I talk about large (plural animate)' Contexts (2.2.7.12) to (2.2.7.17) admit accusative forms. For plural and masculine singu- lar, animate and inanimate nouns must be distinguished. We shall see that (2.2.7.14) is in fact superfluous because it admits exactly the same words as (2.2.7.2). (éto bylo pered bol'Sim, X) (2.2.7. 18) 'this was in front of (or 'just before') the large (masculine or neuter)' (éto bylo pered bol'Sój.

(étogo ne byváet pri bottom, X) (2.2.7.21) 'that does not occur in the presence of a large (masculine or neuter)' (étogo ne byváet pri botto j, X) (2.2.7.22) 'that does not occur in the presence of a large (feminine)' (étogo ne byváet pri bottíx, X) (2.2.7.23) 'that does not occur in the presence of large (plural)1 Contexts (2.2.7.21), (2.2.7.22) and (2.2.7.23) admit the ordinary prepositional or locative I forms of the distinct genders and of the plural. Finally, certain masculine and feminine nouns distinguish a locative (as opposed to prepositional) or locative ¡I (as opposed to locative or locative D form. This form can only be used with the prepositions v fin1) and na Con'), but is not obligatory there. In fact there can be a semantic difference between the locative I and locative II wher- ever both can be used. Compare Jakobson's examples:1 (2/2/7/1) Skól'ko krasoty v lesú. 'how much beauty there is in the wood' (2/2/7/2) Skól'ko krasoty v lése. 'how much beauty there is in the wood' In (2/2/7/1) lése Cwood') is in the locative I: it indicates that the beauty is inherent in the wood. In (2/2/7/2) lesú ('wood') is in the locative II: it indicates that the beauty is located in the wood. Since the locative II occurs only in the singular, it would be sufficient to add the following contexts to account for the use of the locative II. (já víiu krasotú v bottom, X) (2.2.7.24) 'I see beauty in a large (masculine or neuter)' (ß víiu krasotú v bottój, X) (2.2.7.25) 'I see beauty in a large (feminine)1 1 Cf. Jakobson 1936/1971 (7h 63.</page><page sequence="345">CHAPTER 2.2: WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 323 But in fact the assumption that these contexts cover all instances of the locative II requires a considerable amount of leniency in grammaticality judgements. The use of the locative II is subject to various restrictions of a fuzzy, lexical nature. Thus, it is common to say (2/2/7/3) Já vízu krasotú na beregú. 'I see beauty on the coast' where beregú ('coast') is in the locative II following na Con'); but it is almost impossible to say (2/2/7/4) ??Já vízu krasotú v beregü. 'I see beauty in the coast' where beregú is supposed to follow v ('in').1 Also, the use of the locative II is often limited by the use of adjectives. Thus, although (2/2/7/5) Já vízu krasotú v rodnóm krajú. 'I see beauty in my native land' with the locative II krajú ('region'), is regular Russian, the phrase (2/2/7/6) ?Já vízu krasotú v èkzotíõeskom krajú. 'I see beauty in an exotic land' is troublesome.2 If phrases of the type of (2/2/7/4) are considered ungrammatical, then separate families will be yielded for contexts containing v; if phrases of the type of (2/2/7/6) are considered ungrammatical, then many additional families will appear, depending on which adjectives can be combined with which locative II forms. Jakob- son considers these constraints to be of a semantic nature: the locative II indicates the role of a common container or location of an object, and whenever a noun indi- cates an unusual location of object, the communicative structure of an utterance changes so as to block the use of the locative II.3 The converse seems to be true as well: nouns which commonly indicate containers or locations are difficult to dissociate from this function. The fuzziness of the situation is illustrated by the fact that Gladkij considers v lése ('in the wood, locative D incorrect,4 in spite of his abstract concep- tion of grammaticality,5 whereas Jakobson does not only consider it acceptable but even employs it in an example to illustrate the opposition with v iesú Cin the wood, locative II').6 In this study, it will be assumed that all locatives II can be used after both v and na and with any adjectives and any number of them. In terms of Jakobson's semantics this implies that Russian is viewed as a potential language in a world where anything can be a common container of anything: a world where invisible coasts are common places to be in.

Thus, in this chapter's example contexts (2.2.7.1) to (2.2.7.25) are assumed to make up the complete set of contexts which determines the set of Russian noun families. S 2.2.8 Russian noun families: preliminary selection of words In the example of noun families in Russian, to be presented in §2.2.10, set W will be limited to forms of Russian nouns with syntactical behaviour expected to be different from that of the other words included in the set. Thus, if stúl Cchair') is expected to be interchangeable with stól ('table') in all situations, only one of them will be included in the W of the example. Here, too, one may wonder what distortions can occur if preliminary informal se- lection happens to exclude relevant words. In fact, preliminary selection of W is rather harmless. The addition of new elements to W will not essentially affect the es- tablished results: the resulting new state of substitutability equivalence will be, in Fischer's terms, an expansion (Erweiterung^) of the original substitutability equiva- lence: it can only yield new families (for instance if words other than nouns are added) and extensions of the established families (if the new words share the distribution of words already included). As Srejder points out, equivalence is a property which, when characterizing a relation R over a set P, also characterizes the subset of R which in- volves an arbitrary subset P' of P:2 A A tfnP'xp'G ffe(P') (2.2.8.1) Re Re{?) P'e P Srejder calls this "meta-property" characterizing some properties of relations heredi- ty (nasledstvennosV). Equivalence, tolerance and order are hereditary. Tree struc- ture is not. (When the top of a tree structure is removed, the structure of the remain- ing bundle of branches is not necessarily a tree structure.) Besides F-equivalent words, one group of noun forms has consciously been exclud- ed from W in order to avoid certain complications. This group contains the nouns which collapse a case form of the singular and another case form of the plural. The term syncretism is sometimes applied to these instances. Examples are: 1 syncretism of the genitive singular and the nominative plural, such as: a $veit which syncretizes the genitive singular and the nominative plural of the animate feminine noun Svejá ('seamstress'); b poxvaly, which syncretizes the genitive singular and the nominative plural of the inanimate feminine noun poxvalá ('praise'); c v$i, which syncretizes the genitive, dative and locative singular and the nomina- tive plural of the animate feminine noun vóè' Clouse'); d téni, which syncretizes the genitive, dative and locative I singular and the nomi- native plural of the inanimate feminine noun ten* ('shade, shadow'); 1 Fischer 1973 (1.5.7): 19: ra partition A is an expansion of a partition A' if, and only if, each class in A' is a (possibly improper) subset of a class in A". ¿ Srejder 1974b {IY. 88. Set Re{?) of equivalence relations over P was defined in (1.1.9.1).</page><page sequence="347">CHAPTER 2.2 WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 325 e veãõestvá, which syncretizes the genitive singular and the nominative plural of the neuter noun veêõestvó ('substance'); f dudóvtéõa, which syncretizes the genitive singular and the nominative plural of the neuter noun õudóviSõe ('monster'); 2 soldât, which syncretizes the nominative singular and genitive plural of soldât ('soldier'); 3 portnym and Petróvym, which syncretize the instrumental singular and the dative plural of portnój ('tailor') and Petróv (a surname). The inclusion of these instances of syncretism would complicate the presentation of the results of the second use of the example in §2.2.18 to a considerable extent. The relevant words are either kept out of the sample (e.g. ãveí) or, wherever the lexical items are needed as instances of syncretism within a number, are assumed to be label- led for singular and plural (e.g. téni). This practice serves presentational purposes and cannot, of course, be defended from a linguistic or methodological point of view. In- stances of cross-number syncretism as provided above will be dealt with in several places.1 By the same token, the masculine nouns with counting forms of the õás type men- tioned in §2.2.6 are excluded. Counting forms are only used in contexts containing small numerals, such as (2.2.6.8) and (2.2.6.10). Inclusion, in the sample, of counting forms and contexts which admit them would produce additional families for these forms, but would also produce complex situations in the exemplification of the rela- tions which are derived from substitutability equivalence, for which the present ma- terial will be re-used.2 § 2.2.9 Russian noun families: words In view of the above considerations it is assumed that a reasonable picture of the Russian noun families can be given if W contains all forms of the nouns on the list given in this section. 1 Otéc ('father'). This is an animate masculine noun, which, being animate, syncretizes genitive and accusative in the plural (otcóv) and, being animate and masculine, syncretizes genitive and accusative in the singular (ofcá). 2 Sád ('garden'). This is an inanimate masculine noua which, being inanimate, syn- cretizes nominative and accusative in the plural (sady) and, being inanimate and masculine, syncretizes nominative and accusative in the singular (sádí. Further- more, sád has a distinct locative II (sadu); in this respect it differs from, say, górod ('town'), with whom it shares the other specifications. 3 Starèiná ('sergeant-major'). This is an animate masculine noun which is inflected like a feminine noun and therefore possesses a distinct unambiguous accusative singular form (starSinú) and syncretizes dative and locative singular (stararne ). 1 E.g. §2.2.14 and §2.2.20. ¿ The networks in §2.2.18 would be much more complex, as shown in §2.2.20. Inclusion of counting forms and their contexts would also produce an additional case for Russian in most case models: see §5.18.</page><page sequence="348">326 PART 2: STRING MODELS 4 Ügol ('corner', 'angle'). This is an inanimate masculine noun which distinguishes a locative II (uglu) when meaning 'corner'. Unlike sadú' uglu coincides with the dative (cf. sádu and uglu). 5 Cáj ('tea'). This is an inanimate masculine noun which distinguishes a genitive II, which coincides with the dative (óáju). (The genitive II always formally coincides with the dative and it may be questioned whether it is a distinct case or just a lexi- cally and syntactically limited special use of the dative; we shall see how the model handles this.) 6 Podmastér'e ('apprentice'). This is an animate masculine noun which syncretizes nominative and locative singular {podmastér'e). I Domíãõe ('big house'). This is an inanimate masculine noun which syncretizes nomi- native, accusative and locative singular (domíãde). 8 Móx ('moss'). This is an inanimate masculine moun which distinguishes both a geni- tive II and a locative II, both of which coincide with the dative (mxu).[ 9 Put* ('way'). This is an inanimate masculine noun, which syncretizes genitive, dative and locative in the singular (putii. The fact that putì is also the form of the nomina- tive and accusative plural will be ignored for the present.2 10 Kófe ('coffee'). This is a non-inflected inanimate masculine noun. II Oknó ('window'). This is an inanimate neuter noun. Being neuter, it syncretizes nominative and accusative in singular [oknó) and, being inanimate, it does the same in plural (ókna). 12 More ('sea'). This is an inanimate neuter noun which syncretizes nominative, accu- sative and locative in the singular (more). 13 CudóviSõe ('monster'). This is an animate neuter noun which, being animate, syn- cretizes genitive and accusative in the plural (õudóviSâ). In the singular, õudóviSõe is considered to have the same specifications as more: the animacy distinction is considered not to affect neuter nouns in the singular.3 14 Vrémja ('time'). This is an inanimate neuter noun which syncretizes genitive, dative and locative singular (vrémeniì. 15 Metro ('subway'). This is a non-inflected inanimate neuter noun. 16 Zená ('wife'). This is an animate feminine noun. Being animate, it syncretizes geni- tive and accusative in plural (¿en); being feminine, it syncretizes dative and loca- tive in singular (¿ene). 17 Reká ('river'). This is an inanimate feminine noun. Being inanimate, it syncretizes nominative and accusative in plural (réki)' the singular has the same specifications as ïenà. 18 Ten' ('shade'). This is an inanimate feminine noun which syncretizes nominative and accusative singular (ten'). It also syncretizes genitive, dative and locative I singu- lar (téni, the nominative and accusative plural values of téni will be ignored for the moment). Furthermore, ten1 distinguishes a locative II (tenu. 1 Besides mxiX there is the form móxu, which can be genitive II or dative, but not locative II. 2 Cf. §2.2.8. 3 This assumption is not valid for all varieties of Russian.

This is an inanimate feminine noun which syncretizes genitive, dative, instrumental and locative singular imasterskój). It also possesses a distinct instrumental singular (masterskóju). Finally, it syncretizes genitive and locative plural (masterskix). 20 Borzája ('greyhound'). This is an animate feminine noun which in singular syn- cretizes like masterskája. Also, it syncretizes genitive, accusative (being animate) and locative plural (borzyx). 21 Lèdi ('lady'). This loan word is a non-inflected animate feminine noun. 22 Sirotá ('orphan'). This is an animate noun which is masculine or feminine depending on the sex of the referent; it must be distinguished from words of the type vráõ ('doctor'), which bring about fuzzy contexts such as (2.2.6.6). Sirotá inflects like starSiná and zená. 23 Bántu ('Bantu'). This is a non-inflected animate noun which is masculine, feminine or plural depending on the sex and number of the referent. 24 Sostakóviõ (surname of non-Russian origin). This is an animate noun which is in- flected in plural and for male referents; it is not inflected for female singular ref- erents. 25 Simpanzé ('chimpanzee'). This is a non-inflected animate noun which takes mascu- line, feminine and neuter adjectives, depending on the knowledge of the speaker about the referent and about chimps in general.

Each resulting phrase is assumed to have been checked on grammatically. If all 5000 phrases would be grammatical, i.e. be elements of //, then all nouns would belong to the same family and the family partition would yield trivial results for Russian.

Thus, the family which contains ¿en can be labelled Fiïënï The list shows that, say, Fiïën) = F(otcóv) (2.2.10.2) §2.2.11 Revzin's fundamental thesis: presentation The families which have been obtained in §2.2.10 show a general correspondence to certain combinations of traditional grammatical categories. Some examples: 1 F(otéc) corresponds to the combination 'animate', 'masculine', 'singular', 'nominative'; 2 Fisadì corresponds to the combination 'inanimate', 'masculine', 'singular', 'nominative or accusative'; 3 F(uglu) corresponds to the combination 'inanimate', 'masculine', 'singular', 'dative or locative II'; 4 F(siroty) corresponds to the combination 'animate', 'masculine or feminine', 'singular', 'genitive'; etc. This is only partly due to the informal preliminary selection of words and contexts: a vast random amount of contexts and words can be added without resulting in essen- tial modifications of the results.</page><page sequence="352">330 PART 2 STRING MODELS The phenomenon has induced Revzin to formulate what he calls the fundamental thesis of the linguistic theory of modelling, which is formulated as follows.1 (2/2/11/1) fFor the complete set of phrases, a family coincides with a categorial bun- dle. Revzin's term categorial bundle (kategorial'nyj puõok2) needs the following elucidation. In Revzin 1967b, where the thesis is formulated, base component flj is part of a larger base component containing, besides alphabet W and harp //, a feature system &lt;i&gt; over W. Revzin refers to these features as categories? here they will be referred to as grammatical features.4 The features in $ are labelled with traditional grammatical terms: $ = {MASC, FEM, NOM, COMP, . . . } (2.2.1 1.1) Since Revzin does not indicate the (semantic, syntactic, etc.) nature of these features, they must be treated as elements with a special status: they will be written in small capitals without inverted commas. They are distributed over W in accordance with traditional views on grammatical categories. Thus, for each word w, there is a set &lt;J&gt;du) of grammatical features which characterize w. An example: &lt;b(otéc) = {MASC, NOM, ANIM, SING, . . . } (2.2. 1 1.2) The relations which are determined between grammatical features by their mutual or one-way inclusion or exclusion in one $(w) have been studied by Marcus.5 Many of his results are covered in § 1.1.2 Iff. The categorial bundle F*(w) of a word w is therefore defined as the set of words w' which are characterized by the same features which characterize w, i.e. F*hu) = { ii/ 1 w' € W A Kw) = KvA } (2.2. 1 1 .3) Revzin uses categorial bundles in a model of sentence generation which will not be discussed here.6 It is clear that the definition of categorial bundles on the basis of grammatical features is analogous to the definition of families on the basis of contex- tual features. According to Revzin's fundamental hypothesis, the partition of W into categorial bundles coincides with the partition of W into families. The thesis is a constraint on the set of possible languages, since the two partitions do not necessarily coincide for arbitrary values of H and 4&gt;. Revzin in fact says that: 1 the set of grammatical features is determined independently of the set of phrases; 2 the set of phrases is independent of the set of grammatical features; 3 as a general property of natural language, each family (yielded by a combination of contexts, which are in turn derived from phrases) happens to coincide with a cate- gorial bundle; since both families and categorial bundles make up a partition of W, 1 Revzin 1967b (3.22): 90. 2 Revzin 1967b (3.15): 63. 3 Revzin 1967b (3.15): 62f. 4 For the use of category, see § 1.3.2. 5 Marcus 1961a; Marcus 1963b, Marcus 1963d. 6 Revzin 1967b (3.20): 81-85.</page><page sequence="353">CHAPTER 2.2 WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 33 1 the converse statement is implied, i.e. each categorial bundle (yielded by a combi- nation of grammatical features) happens to contain a family: A FM = F%&gt;) (2.2.11.4) we W This is a most attractive constraint: if there would be one-to-one correspondence (i.e. a relation of the type R+++)1 between categorial bundles and families, distribut ionalist discovery procedures would in fact "discover" the grammatical properties which have been established deductively for language as a relational system. The constraint must be rejected if there is a language containing a set of words characterized by the same (traditional, intuitive) grammatical features such that there is no corresponding family (which makes the relation between the sets of families and categorial bundles of the type f?+°), or if we find a language containing a family which does not correspond to a combination of grammatical features (which makes the rela- tion R%). These options are examined below. §2.2.12 Discussion of Revzin's fundamental thesis: mapping categorial bundles onto families First, it is examined how categorial bundles are matched by families. Assume that the grammatical features ANIM and INAN characterize otcá ('father, genitive or accusati- ve1) and sáda ('garden, genitive'), respectively. ANIM and INAN are traditionally con- sidered to be essential here because animacy decides whether otcá and sáda can be employed as an accusative or only as a genitive. But if ANIM and INAN are also con- sidered to be present in F*(ofcii) ('father, dative') and F*(sadu) ('garden, dative'), re- spectively, then they will falsify Revzin's thesis since otcú and sádu are elements of the same family, viz. Yioknúl There are two ways out. Either there must be non-distributional reasons for ex- cluding ANIM from F*(ofcu') and INAN from F*(sa'cfu) (or for including both ANIM and INAN into both sets, which amounts to the same thing); or there must be distributional reasons for dissociating F*(otcú) and F*(sadu).2 The first solution has hardly been considered: nobody has found a reason to qualify otéc as animate in one case and as non-animate in other cases (or sád as inanimate in one case and as non-animate in others). A combination of ANIM and INAN in both F*(otcú) and F*(sádu) was also left out of consideration. This would have entailed an identical treatment of the combinations MASC - NEUT in F*(otcú) and MASC - FEM in F^isirotá) ('orphan, nominative masculine or feminine'), whereas in the former instance the combination is incidental, determined by the case feature (DAT) and in the latter instance the combination is inherent to the noun and present in all forms of the paradigm. The second option is offered by Z-contexts.3 Consider the following. 1 For the employed denotation of types of relations, cf. S 1.1.6. 2 And, for that matter, for dissociating F*(ofcii) and Y*{oknú) ('window, dative, neuter'), as the same issue is essential to the distinction MASC - NEUT in the dative. d Cf. §2.2.6.</page><page sequence="354">332 PART 2 STRING MODELS (já obraSõájus* k boïèomu, , kotóryj já videi) (2.2. 12. 1) 'I turn to the large', 'which (accusative inanimate) I saw' (já obraSdájus' k boïèomu, , kotórogo já videi) (2.2. Ì2.2) 'I turn to the large', 'which (accusative animate) I saw' Contexts (2.2.12.1) and (2.2.12.2) are differential for otcú and sádu. The animacy dis- tinction, which was, in Whorf's terms, covert in the dative, can be detected by the pronominalization of the word in a relative clause where the pronoun occurs in a context which reveals the animacy value of the word. It is in view of these contexts that Revzin added the condition that his thesis applies to the complete set of phrases. This solution only works for features which characterize several forms of a paradigm, such as 'gender1, animacy or number1. It does not work for case1: the combi- nation of grammatical features { NOUN, ANIM, FEM, SING, DAT } (2.2. 12.3) is conceivable in linguistic tradition; the corresponding family F(¿ené) exists, but F (¿ené) also corresponds to { NOUN, ANIM, FEM, SING, LOC } (2.2. 12.4) Z-contexts containing pronominal reference cannot split up F(¿ené) because, unlike ANIM and INAN, the features DAT and LOC characterize identical words. Revzin proposes here that a word can be characterized by two or more grammati- cal features, or by so-called compound (smeSannyj) features.1 In this conception, oknó will be characterized by the feature NOM-ACC and, we may add, sirotá by MASC-FEM. This approach arouses the suspicion that the distribution of grammatical features is not in fact established on the basis of independent assumptions or observations but is adapted with an eye to the stock of families. Within the domain of the model we cannot object to that, but this practice is likely to be part of a full model in which the thesis turns out to be trivial. S 2.2.13 Discussion of Revzin's fundamental thesis: extending the set of contexts It will now be examined to what extent the families of the Russian noun are matched by categorial bundles. We can observe that all families of §2.2.10 correspond to a set of grammatical features; but let us see what happens when contexts and words be- longing to the types explicitly excluded in §2.2.6 and §2.2.8 are integrated into K and W. It was shown that Z-contexts, which are exemplified by (2.2.6.3), (2.2.6.4) and (2.2.6.5), contribute to Revzin's hypothesis, by splitting up the families of §2.2.10 ac- cording to paradigmatic features contained in &lt;î&gt;. The inclusion of fuzzy gender contexts, which are exemplified by (2.2.6.6), yields a separate family of nominatives of animate nouns denoting professions and certain other words, such as továrièõ ('comrade'). Linguistic tradition does not provide a cor- responding combination of grammatical features. It is of course possible to create one, say the feature PROF. Possibly, this feature can be extended to other case forms 1 Revzin 1967b (3.15k 62.</page><page sequence="355">CHAPTER 2.2 WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 333 by means of Zaliznjak's contexts, and then treated as a fourth gender or the like. But this practice, again, arouses the suspicion of affecting the independent establishment of grammatical features. The situation is similar for contexts admitting déverbal nouns, exemplified by (2.2.6.7). If they are included, all families of nouns will be split according to govern- ment classes, since there are differential contexts such as (já govorjú pro nedávnoe, dómu) (2.2. 13. 1) 'I talk about the recent', 'house (dative)' which admits the accusative forms of neuter déverbal nouns governing the dative-, (já govorjú pro nedávnoe, dómom) (2.2. 13.2) 'I talk about the recent', 'house (instrumental)' which admits the accusative forms of neuter déverbal nouns governing the instrumen- tal; (já govorjú pro nedávnoe, dòma) (2.2. 13.3) 'I talk about the recent', 'house (genitive)* which admits the accusatives of all neuter nouns, including nouns derived from verbs that govern the accusative or the genitive. Zaliznjak's contexts do not help here. The contexts (já govorjú o nedávnom, dómu, kotóroe já vìdei) (2.2. 13.4) 'I talk about the recent', "house (dative), which I saw* (já govorjú o nedávnom, dómom, kotóroe já videi) (2.2. 13.5) 'I talk about the recent', 'house (instrumental), which I saw* (já govorjú o nedávnom, doma, kotóroe já videi) (2.2. 13.6) 'I talk about the recent', 'house (genitive), which I saw1 admit the locative forms of the words admitted by (2.2.13.1), (2.2.13.2) and (2.2.13.3), re- spectively. The problem can be solved here by the inclusion of government features as gram- matical features. Thus ovladénie ('seizure') is assigned the feature INSTRGOV and oknó is assigned the feature GENGOV. But the inclusion of government features, which are commonly considered to reflect distributional properties of words, as independent grammatical features, would again arouse the suspicion that grammatical features are being adapted to fit the fundamental thesis, which turns the thesis into a trivial obser- vation. S 2.2.14 Discussion of Revzin's fundamental thesis: extending the set of words A more serious threat to the validity of Revzin's fundamental thesis is not its possible reduction into a trivial statement, but its failure to avoid handling linguistic phenom- ena in a counter-intuitive manner, even in its trivial form. This failure seems to be in- herent in the structure of Revzin's feature set $, and becomes manifest when W is extended with words of the Svei type, which have explicitly been excluded from the Russian noun families example in §2.2.8.</page><page sequence="356">334 PART 2 STRING MODELS First, consider F(siroté): it is relatively natural that it coincides with F*(s/rofé), which is determined by the set of features { NOUN, ANIM, MASC, FEM, SING, DAT, LOC } (2.2. 14. 1) or, if Revzin's compound features are employed, { NOUN, ANIM, MASC-FEM, SING, DAT-LOC } (2.2. 14.2) But for Svei' a family Fteve/) is found which coincides with no other family that has been established before, being determined by Alive/) - {(2.2.7.4), (2.2.7.6), (2.2.7.8) } (22. 14.3) By the same token, F*(5ve/) must be determined by the set of grammatical features { NOUN, ANIM, FEM, SING, PLUR, NOM, GEN } (22. 14.4) or, if Revzin's compound features are employed, {NOUN, ANIM, FEM, SING-PLUR, NOM-GEN } (2.2. 14.5) Linguistically, however, F*(sirofe) and F*(5ve/) reflect totally different phenomena. In siroté the compound features indicate an amalgamation of the combinations {MASC, DAT, ... } (2.2.14.6) {MASC, LOC, ... } (2.2.14.7) {FEM, DAT,... } (2.2.14.8) {FEM, LOC,... } (2.2.14.9) whereas in Svei, the compound features indicate only the combinations {SING, GEN,...} (2.2.14.10) {PLUR, NOM, ... } (2.2.14.11) while the combinations ♦{SING, NOM,... } (2.2.14.12) ♦{PLUR, GEN, ... } (2.2.14.13) are excluded. Revzin's feature system does not indicate the difference between siroté and ãvef. This is typical for families as well as categorial bundles: they are relatively uninfor- mative. They do not indicate that the relation between, say, otéc ('father, nominative singular') and ¿end ('wife, nominative singular') is any different from the relation be- tween otéc and otcá ('father, genitive singular'). S 2.2.15 Discussion of Revzin's fundamental thesis: extending the set of languages The statement is defensible that the counter-evidence to Revzin's thesis given in the preceding sections is not really to the point, being provided by exceptional contexts and incidental morphological homonymy, which should be dealt with on a more ab-</page><page sequence="357">CHAPTER 2.2: WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 335 stract or semantic level of analysis, leaving Revzin's thesis essentially tenable. The question whether a statement about language which does not even try to account for exceptions is a meaningful linguistic statement, will be left aside here. The essence of Revzin's thesis is that any combination of grammatical features possesses a unique distribution and that any distribution corresponds to a combination of grammatical features. The thesis is essentially falsified if one of the following circumstances oc- curs. 1 There are grammatical features which are always in paradigmatic opposition, oc- curring in the same contexts. 2 There are families which are derived from a distribution that has nothing to do with grammatical features. The first circumstance is not generally found for Russian noun categories, but is quite feasible for verbal categories: the Russian verbal aspects, for example, generally compete in the same contexts. Revzin mentions elsewhere that grammatical features of noun categories in the Finno-Ugric languages have an identical distribution.1 Thus, in Estonian, the forms of the comitative belong to the same family as the forms of the abessive: one can say (2/2/ 15/1) Suure rõõmuga tulen sinna. 'I shall come here with great joy', literally 'great with- joy I-shall-come to-here' as well as (2/2/ 1 5/2) Suure rõõmuta tulen sinna. 'I shall come here without great joy', literally 'great joy-less I-shall-come to-here' It is possible to find a context that admits words the meanings of which include 'with', and does not admit words the meanings of which include 'without', as Zaliznjak sub- mits.2 In fact the addition of the preposition Urna ('without') blocks the use of the comitative:3 (2/2/15/3) lima suure rõõmuta tulen sinna. 'I shall come here without great joy*, literally 'without great joy-less I-shall-come to-here' (2/2/ 1 5/4) *Ilma suure rõõmuga tulen sinna. 'without great with- joy I-shall-come to-here1 But in those instances, the second circumstance mentioned above will occur, which also falsifies Revzin's thesis. For a language like English, contexts which differentiate the distributions of with and without will yield different families although they are characterized by the same grammatical features, unless of course the grammatical features COMIT and ABESS would be assigned to with and without, which would, again, turn Revzin's fundamental thesis into a relatively trivial statement. If grammatical features are dealt with on a more abstract level, the possibility that their distributions coincide will only increase. Generally, we may expect that gram- matical features convey a meaning, which is only relevant if it is opposed to other meanings. If redundant properties are abstracted from, the real oppositions will re- main. A category like number1, which can be determined on a distributional basis on 1 Revzin 1966b (4.28): 83, which also provides examples (2/2/15/1) and (2/2/15/2). 2 Zaliznjak 1967a: 2. The passage is cited in S3.3.16. 3 As remarked in Revzin 1964b: 44.</page><page sequence="358">336 PART 2: STRING MODELS the most concrete level, will have to rely on its meaning if it is to be determined in a more abstract analysis. Revzin's hypothesis appears most tenable on the lowest level of abstraction. Recapitulating what has been said on the empirical interest of the concept of fami- ly, one may infer that, although families apparently reflect some aspects of the gram- matical structure of a language, they far from directly correspond to grammatical concepts. The linguistic relevance of the concept of family is best epitomized in Ses- tier's statement that rall the forms of the same S-class [i.e. family] present the same problems, or the same absence of problems, for the determination of their grammati- cal characteristics".1 In other words: linguistic modelling only begins here. S 2.2.16 Substitutability dominance After the establishment of families, attempts were undertaken to model more informa- tive grammatical concepts. Developments took place in two directions. On the one hand, Kulagina added a new relation to the base component. The resulting base com- ponent will be extensively discussed in Part 3. On the other hand, DobruSin defines new concepts without expanding ft'. The new concepts are attempts to solve the problems caused by what set-theoretical linguists call morphological homonymy. This phenomenon was blamed for mismatches between families and categorial bundles. It is illustrated by the following example. Consider categorial bundle F*(zemi) ('wife, accusative singular'), which corre- sponds to the combination of grammatical features {FEM, SING, ACC, . . . } (2.2.16.1) Categorial bundle F*(ienii) coincides with family F(iemi), which is determined by con- text (2.2.7.15). But Fiíenú) does not contain all feminine singular accusative forms. It lacks, for instance, the elements of Fiten') ('shade, nominative or accusative singular1), which are also admitted by context (2.2.7.15). The word ten* does not belong to F(¿enú' because it is also admitted by context (2.2.7.3), which is the only context in the set admitting F(¿ená) ('wife, nominative singular'). Thus, ten' is morphologically homony- mous because Kkïena) c vXtén*) A K{¿enú) e Kitén') {22. 16.2) In other words, ten* shares the distributional features of lena as well as ienû.

WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 337 &amp; Novak.1 It was introduced into linguistics by DobruSin; its properties were studied by Dobruáin2 and, most extensively, by Marcus.3 Their studies treat dominance be- tween words and contexts, not dominance as a relation which can be derived in any feature systems. The internal general properties of a given dominance relation were studied by Mayoh.4 Relation Dw of substitutability dominance over W is defined as follows. Dw = {[wif ^ll^GWA^eWA Kfaui) c Khv2)} (2.2.16.4) Thus, v)2 is D-substitutable for w' if all contexts which admit w' also admit w2. The converse is not necessarily the case. Consider the following example, which is based on the contexts of §2.2.7 and the words of §2.2.10. Set Dw contains the pairs (¿enút ténX (tén' svjázX (svjáz' ten') (2.2.16.5) (The word svjáz Clink') shares the morphological and morphosyntactic properties of ten'.) Set Dw does not contain the pairs (¿ená, ¿end), (¿enút ¿ená), (tén'¿ena) (2.2.16.6) Word W{ is said to S-dominate word w2 if:5 (w[tw2)e DW (2.2.16.7) In Part 2 and Part 3, the dominance arrow, introduced in § 1.1.11, will be employed exclusively to indicate S-dominance.

S-dominance directly determines two systems of sets over W by assigning to each word w: 1 a set of words which are dominated by w and 2 a set of words which dominate w. The first set is called the progressive product of w-} the second set is called the re- gressive product of w. Their formal definitions run as follows.2 F*(w) = {W | wf e W A w -&gt; u/ } (2.2.16.12) Fliri = {W | w' e W A w' -* iu } (2.2. 16. 13) It is easily verified that F+to) n Flu;) = Fiw) (2.2. 1 6. 14) because Äu;) c Kb//) A K(u/) c ¡Aw) =* Äu;) = Ahi;') (2.2. 16. 15) It is also obvious that elements of the same family have the same progressive and re- gressive products. Therefore the facts represented in Fig. 2.2.16.1 are incorporated into the following figure, where boxes indicate families labelled by the words that they contain. 1 Progressive products have not been identified by the Set-theoretical School. They are similar to Marcus' saturated products, the difference being that saturated products are defined for any subset of W, whereas progressive products are restricted to words and families.

S 2.2.17 Initial familles Fig. 2.2.16.2 suggests that words such as ¿ená, which are characterized by very spe- cific combinations of grammatical features, S-dominate words such as ten* which pos- sess a greater degree of morphological homonymy. It is this apparent property of lan- guage which prompted the interest of set-theoretical linguistics in S-dominance. It was reasoned that the most specific words must be those not S-dominated by any others except the words belonging to the same family. These words are called initial words. Set Wl of initial words is defined as follows.1 W* = {w | w e W A F~(w) c Flu;) } (2.2. 17. 1) The definition ensures that a family which contains an initial word, contains only ini- tial words. Therefore we can speak of initial families.2 Correspondingly, final words can be defined as words that do not S-dominate other words except those belonging to the same family. The set of final words is defined as follows.3 W/ = {w | w e W A F*iw) c Flu;)} (2.2.17.2) 1 This definition is equivalent to definition (1.1.17.1) of initial elements for a dominance relation. 2 The Set-theoretical School somehow does without initial families as an explicitly defined concept. Mar- cus does define initial sets, of which initial families are a special case. Initial families are introduced here as an auxiliary concept, which simplifies the definition and presentation of many other concepts. ä This definition is equivalent to definition (1.1.17.7) of final elements for a dominance relatioa</page><page sequence="362">340 PART 2: STRING MODELS The definition ensures that a family which contains a final word contains final words only. We can therefore speak of final families. Mayoh calls them barren families.1 For example, consider the Russian noun families which have been established in §2.2.10. It is easy to verify that there are 17 initial families and 3 final families; they are listed below. We see that they more or less correspond to certain categorial bun- dles, which are indicated here for reference. W* = F*hi&gt;t) F(otéc) (MASC, SING, NOM) U Fisáda) (MASC-NEUT, SING, GEN) U Fiotcui (MASC-NEUT, SING, DAT) U FistarSiniíí (MASC, SING, ACC) U Tiotcóm) (MASC-NEUT, SING, INSTR) U Fisadú) (MASC-NEUT, SING, LOC) U Fioknó) (NEUT, SING, NOM-ACC) U F(zena) (FEM, SING, NOM) U F(ieny) (FEM, SING, GEN) U ?{¿enú) (FEM, SING, ACC) U FUenój) (FEM, SING, INSTR) U Fiteni) (FEM, SING, LOC) U F(¿eny) (PLUR, NOM) U F(ókorí) (PLUR, GEN) U Fióknam) (PLUR, DAT) U Fióknamù (PLUR, INSTR) u F(óknax) (PLUR, LOC) (2.2. 17.3) W-f= F%Jt) F(kófe) (I NAM, MASC) U F(metró) (INAM, NEUT) u FiSimpanzé) (ANIM) (2.2. 1 7.4) The question of what exactly these correspondences signify can be left aside for the moment. It is clear that whatever correspondence is expected is not complete. On the one hand, there are cases of morphological homonymy such as MASC-NEUT which are not removed when observations are limited to initial words. On the other hand, the distinction between LOC I and LOCI I has disappeared, as well as common combinations such as (FEM, DAT). Moreover, most words are not initial words and nothing is said about them. Initial words and families taken by themselves are of litte linguistic relevance. They serve as an auxiliary concept for the definition of elementary grammatical cat- egories, which will be discussed in the next section. §2.2.18 Dobruain's elementary grammatical categories Probably the most interesting concept that has been defined on the basis of fli is the elementary grammatical category, which results when non-initial families are united 1 Mayoh 1966 (2&gt;. 44.</page><page sequence="363">CHAPTER 2.2 WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 34 1 with the initial families which S-dominate them: in terms of S 1.1.17, an elementary grammatical category is the progressive product of an intial family.1 Set E of elemen- tary grammatical categories is defined as follows.2 E={E|ECWA V E-F+hi;)} (2.2.18.1) we W1 The regressive counterpart to the elementary grammatical category is set F which contains the regressive products of final families:3 F={F|FCWA V F = F-(w)} (2.2.18.2) we W' Marcus' concept of '(non-elementary) grammatical category' is closely similar to the sets in F. It will be discussed in §2.2.2 Iff. Set E (like F) is a system of tolerance classes over W: no elementary grammatical categories are completely contained in other elementary grammatical categories. As a special property, each class Et in E comprises a non-empty subset which is exclu- sive for Ei: an initial family, which is said to generate Ej. Thus, the 17 initial families which have been established for the Russian noun in §2.2.17 all generate their own elementary grammatical categories. Here are two examples. The elementary grammatical category generated by Fisadú) contains all families admitted by the contexts which admit sadú (i.e. {(2.2.7.24)}): F+(sadu) = F(sadú) u Fiotcé) u F(uglú) u Fipodmastér'e) u FistarSinél u Fimxu) U Fidomíèõe) u Fivrémeniì u Fikófe) u Fimóre) u Fimetrói u FiBántu) u FiSimpanzâ uF(siroté) (2.2.18.3) The elementary grammatical category generated by the initial family Visada), which is admitted by contexts (2.2.7.5) and (2.2.7.8), is the following. V+isáda) = Visada) u Vivrémeni) u Fikófe) u Fimetró) u Fiotcá) u FiBántu) u Fiãimpanzéi uFisiroty) (2.2.18.4) The complete set of elementary grammatical categories for the Russian noun example can be read from a graph representing S-dominance for the words in the example and which is presented below. For presentational ease, the graph is decomposed into five partly overlapping fragments, showing parts which are relevant for words belonging to the masculine, neuter, and feminine genders, respectively, as well as for the plural and the so-called common gender which covers such words as sirotá. The large boxes indicate families which are labelled by the words contained; starred boxes indicate initial families. The small boxes contain the abbreviated num- 1 In contravention to the general rule in these volume, the term category is used here to indicate the ele- ments of a class system instead of the class system itself: it would not do justice to the Set-theoretical School to devise a different term for one of their central concepts. ¿ Cf. definition (1.1.17.4). 0 Cf. definition (1.1.17.8).</page><page sequence="364">342 PART 2 STRING MODELS bers of the contexts which admit the corresponding families.

Similar correspondences can be established for the other instances of cross-number syncretism. A lexical homonym is assigned to the correct elementary grammatical categories if an unambiguous context exists for each meaning. Consider the word péõ' which is ei- ther the infinitive of the verb péõ1 ('bake') or the nominative and accusative of the noun peo* ('stove'). It is unexpectedly troublesome to find a foolproof context which admits only infinitives. A context like (ónnáõalX) (2.2.18.5) 'he started'</page><page sequence="370">348 PART 2: STRING MODELS admits péõ' to yield 'he started to bake1, but Srejder gives (2/2/18/1) Master náõal péõ' as an example of homonymy: 'the foreman started to bake (pies)'; 'the foreman started (to build) the stove'.1 But let it be assumed that there is a context v which admits only verb infinitives.

But the explanatory interest of the elementary grammatical category is still limited: it does not, for example, distinguish between the type of homonymy found in siroté and the type found in Svei.3 Moreover, certain combinations of Revzin's gram- matical features (such as {FEM, SING, DAT, ... }) are missing from the inventory of initial families and therefore do not turn up as elementary grammatical categories. The results of some extensions of the elementary grammatical category which pro- vide possible solutions to this problem will be examined in the next section. 1 Srejder 1974a (3Y. 23. 2 Marcus 1967c (5.4): 146f. 3 Cf. the discussion in §2.2.15.</page><page sequence="371">CHAPTER 2.2 WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 349 S 2.2.19 Quasi-elementary grammatical categories There are seven non-initial families which, intuitively, do not reflect morphological homonymy, or do not reflect morphological homonymy properly. If one would match the generally accepted combinations of Revzin's grammatical features with elemen- tary grammatical categories, one would wish to see the progressive products of the same seven families qualified as grammatical categories, i.e. added to the list. These progressive products are listed below; the grammatical features assumed to corre- spond to them are added for reference. F+(sád) { INAN, MASC, SING, NOM-ACC } F+(otcé) {MASC, SING, LOCI } F+(dáju) { MASC, SING, GENI I } F+(¿ené) { FEM, SING, DAT-LOCI } F+(2ëlï) { ANIM, PLUR, GEN-ACT } F+iókna) { INAN, PLUR, NOM-ACC } F+(ot cá) { ANIM, MASC, SING, GEN-ACC } (2.2. 1 9. 1 ) A model which qualifies F+(sadú) as an elementary grammatical category but fails to do so for F+(sád) or F+(otcé)t[ can be considered inadequate. Within the framework of set-theoretical linguistics, two concepts related to the el- ementary grammatical category can be applied in order to provide a better fit. The first is DobruSin's and Marcus1 quasi-elementary grammatical category, which is dis- cussed in this section; the second concept can be labelled para-elementary grammati- cal category: it will be discussed in §2.2.20. Quasi-elementary grammatical categories are progressive products of quasi-initial families,2 which DobruSin introduces with the following example.3 W - { è to, 'this (neuter)' id, 'that (neuter)' krásnoe, 'red (neuter)' zelënoe} 'green (neuter)' (2.2.19.2) The set K of contexts contains: [já videi oknó) (2.2.19.3) 'I saw', 'window1 (X, sei õelovék) (2.2.19.4) 'went a man' We find that K(krásnoe) - K(zetënoe) - {(2.2.19.3)} (2.2.19.5) but, since (2/2/19/1), (2/2/19/2) and (2/2/19/3) are grammatically correct, while a phrase like (2/2/19/3) is grammatically incorrect, 1 Compare list (2.2.17.3). ¿ This term is from Marcus 1967c (5.37): 181.

DobruSin identifies one property of F(éto) which distinguishes it from "ordinary" non-initial families. Its elements are admitted by contexts which do not admit initial words: the set of contexts which admit F(éto) does not coincide with the union of the sets of contexts admitting families which dominate F(éto). It is this property which is employed to define quasi-initial families, which DobruSin defines as families F which: 1 are initial, or: 2 are admitted by a context which does not admit elements of families which domi- nate F. The formal definition given below is equivalent to DobruSin's but differs from it in that quasi-initial families are derived directly from the admission relation between words and contexts instead of being partly defined on the basis of the dominance relation derived from it. Set W91 of quasi-initial words is defined as follows.1 W9*= {u;|ii;e W A A (K(wi) U . . . U K(wn) = K(w) * F(wi) U . . .

On the one hand, DobruSin's set of contexts results in words such as stúl Cchair, mas- culine nominative or accusative') which belong to F(sád) being initial, whereas the more complete set given in §2.2.7 yields them as quasi-initial.

Assume that DobruSin's example is extended by context (2.2.19.10): (éto.oknó) (2.2.19.10) 'this (neuter)', 'window' Assume, furthermore, that (2.2.19.10) admits Fikrásnoe) to yield the grammatical phrase (2/2/19/5) Ëto krásnoe oknó. 'this is a red window' but does not admit Flato), under the assumption that (2/2/19/6) ?Etoétooknó. is ungrammatical. Then, Yiéto) can be regarded as a regular initial family. But DobruSins' definition is suitable for identifying the progressive products of F(sad) as grammatical categories. As can be seen in Figs. 2.2.18.1 to 2.2.18.5, it quali- fies six out of seven progressive products listed in (2.2.19.1) as quasi-elementary grammatical categories: the odd one out is F(ofcá). Note that EQ is not a system of tolerance classes over W. Several quasi-elemen- tary grammatical categories are subsets of others. Not all inclusions are corroborated by empirical interest.1 Thus, the quasi-elementary grammatical categories containing inanimate nominative or accusative nouns are subsets of quasi-elementary grammati- cal categories containing animate nominative nouns; conversely, the quasi-elemen- tary grammatical categories containing animate genitive or accusative nouns are sub- sets of quasi-elementary grammatical categories containing inanimate genitive nouns. The absence of a satisfactory solution for F(otcá) shows that, even if they provide more spectacular fits to categorial bundles than do the models of elementary gram- matical categories, they are still only approximations of grammatical categories and cannot serve as definitions. Furthermore, they do not offer any insight into the rela- tions and differences between various grammatical features.2 Finally, their solution for morphological homonymy applies only to words as types; they do not handle in- stances where "morphological homonymy" occurs in tokens, such as otcá ('father, genitive or accusative') in (2/2/19/7) Já ne videi otcâ. 'I did not see father' which admits genitives and accusatives. § 2.2.20 Para-elementary grammatical categories In the Russian noun families example, the results achieved by the model of 'quasi-ele- mentary grammatical category can also be achieved by the following model of para- elementary grammatical category, the progressive product of a word in a family which is dominated by no more than one other family. The set WP1 of para-initial 1 Empirical interest: S 1.3.7. 2 But see §2.221ff. on non-elementary grammatical categories.</page><page sequence="374">352 PART 2 STRING MODELS words, i.e. words w such that all words outside the family of w which dominate it be- long to the same family, is defined as follows.

Families which contain para-initial words are called para-initial families. Set Ep of para-elementary grammatical categories con- tains the progressive products of para-initial words: EP={E|ECWA V E = F+{w) } (2.2.20.2) weWP* Fig. 2.2.18.1 to Fig. 2.2.18.5 show that, for the Russian noun material, all progressive products which qualify as quasi-elementary grammatical categories also qualify as para-elementary grammatical categories, i.e. those listed in (2.2.19.1) except F+(ofca). The advantage of using progressive products of para-initial elements is that they can be defined on any dominance relation, without reference to the possible feature system that generates it. But although the results of the two types of categories coin- cide for the Russian noun example presented in this chapter, they may not necessarily do so for the complete material. Consider what happens when contexts (2.2.6.8), (2.2.6.9) and (2.2.6.10), which contain small numerals, are included in the sample set K, and words with cross-number syncretism and counting forms are included in W.1 The small numeral contexts usually require the use of the genitive singular; but they require special counting forms for a few masculine nouns, such as dás ('hour'), and also require forms other than the genitive singular for substantivized adjectives (or all adjectives, for that matter). The agreement rules for substantivized adjectives are rather fuzzy, but below it is assumed, following Zaliznjak, that the genitive plural is required for masculine substantivized adjectives, and both the nominative plural and the genitive plural are allowed for feminine substantivized adjectives.2 In that case F(masterskix) is determined by a set of contexts which is not the union of sets of contexts determining other families: Kimasterskix) = { (2.2.6.9), (2.2.6. 10), (2.2.7.7), (2.2.7.8), (2.2.7.23) } (2.2.20.3) As a result, the model yields a quasi-elementary grammatical category F+{masterskix' which contains all genitive plural forms of feminine nouns which can be used with context (2.2.6.9), including forms in which the genitive plural syncretizes with other forms. F+(masterskix) = Fiborzyx) u FUédi) u FíSostakóvid U FiBántu) u F(Simpanzé) (2.2.20.4) But F+{masterskix) is not a para-elementary grammatical category, because there is more than one family which dominates it, viz. Fiókorù and Fióknax): 1 For the contexts containing small numbers and lexical items with counting forms which are used in the present example, cf. §2.2.6, item 4; for lexical items with cross-number syncretism, cf. §2.2.8. 2 Zaliznjak 1967b (2.8): 46.</page><page sequence="375">CHAPTER 2.2: WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 353 Kiókon) = { (2.2.7.7), (2.2.7.8) } (2.2.20.5) Kkóknax) = { (2.2.7.23) } (2.2.20.6) The relevant fragment of the dominance graph which is produced after the inclusion of the small number contexts is shown below.

It happens to be that the situation in which a family is dominated by only one other family can only exist if the dominated family involves new contexts, but the converse does not hold. But chance is not ruled out by quasi-elementary grammatical categories either. For the masculine gender, the small number contexts yield not a quasi-elementary gram- matical category, but a full-fledged elementary grammatical category: initial family F(sáda) is replaced by two new initial families: 1 F(õása' which is determined by all contexts which formerly determined F(sa'da); 2 Fiõasáí, which is determined by (2.2.6.8) and (2.2.6.10). Correspondingly, two elementary grammatical categories are yielded: F+(dása) = Fiõása) u F(sáda) u Fiotcái u Fívrémeni) u Fikôfe) u Fímetró) (2.2.20.7) which corresponds to the masculine and neuter singular genitive, and</page><page sequence="376">354 PART 2: STRING MODELS F+iõasá) = Fiõasáí u Visada) u Fiotcá) u Fivrémeni) u Fikófe) u F(mefrd) u FipodleíáSõix) u Fíportayx) u Ft/nefrd) u FiBántu) u FU/mpanzé) (2.2.20.8) which corresponds to the masculine and neuter counting forms.

The next thing that can be required of a model is that it distinguish between different kinds of categories, e.g. that it group families according to case1, gender1, "number1, animacy, etc. It is for this purpose that Marcus defined the concept of (non-elementary) grammatical category. This concept is described and discussed in the following section; in the present sec- tion, some new linguistic material is introduced which lends itself well for exemplifi- cation. Marcus illustrates his grammatical categories on the material of the nominative forms of Romanian adjectives without the enclitic article. Whenever, in this chapter, Romanian adjectives are mentioned, only these forms will be referred to. Romanian adjectives, like French adjectives, agree in gender1 and number1 with the noun they modify. The relevant contexts contained in K are here rendered in an abstract repre- sentation in order to simplify the presentation.2 ({NOUN, MASC, SING, . . . }, X) (2.2.21.1) ({NOUN, FEM, SING, ... }, X) (2.2.21.2) ({NOUN, MASC, PLUR, ... }, X) (2.2.21.3) ({NOUN, FEM, PLUR, ... }, X) (2.2.21.4) As in French, different types of Romanian adjectives show different patterns of "mor- phological homonymy". Some do not syncretize at all, others syncretize two, three or four forms. The theoretical maximum number of families is 15, i.e. the number of ele- ments in the boolean of K. Marcus finds 12 families for the standard language, which are listed below.3 1 English uses plural noun forms; Hungarian and spoken French use singular forms (but cf. the note on French in §2.1.17). In standard Dutch, the number distinction remains unneutralized with numerals for a productive group of nouns which indicate measures: for details, see the discussion on phrases (6/6/5) and (6/6/6). 2 For the position of the Romanian neuter, see §3.2.4. d Marcus 1967c (1.32): 30f.</page><page sequence="379">CHAPTER 2.2 WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 357 families contexts Fif rumos)* (2.2.21 .1) ('beautiful') F(subtire) (2.2.21.1), (2.2.21.2) (thin1) F(frumoas$* (2.2.21.2) ('beautiful') F(precoce) (2.2.21.1), (2.2.21.2), (2.2.21.4) ('precocious') F(dibaci) (2.2.21.1), (2.2.21.3) ('skilled') F(june) (2.2.21.1), (2.2.21.4) ('young') F(greoaie) (2.2.21.2), (2.2.21.4) ('clumsy') F(vechi) (2.2.21.1), (2.2.21.3), (2.2.21.4) Cold') Fifrumoçiï (2.2.2 1 .3) ('beautiful') F(subtin) (2.2.21.3), (2.2.21.4) ('thin') F(frumoase)* (2.2.2 1 .4) ('beautiful') Fimaw) (2.2.21.1), (2.2.21.2), (2.2.21.3), (2.2.21.4) ('maroon') (2.2.21.5) Figure 2.2.21.1 shows the relation of S-dominance between the listed families which is yielded by the contexts.

Marcus1 model of 'grammatical category, de- veloped to cater for these distinctions, is described in the following section. § 2.2.22 Marcus* non-elementary grammatical categories: presentation Marcus' model of '(non-elementary) grammatical category' employs a number of auxil- iary concepts. An initial set, which is not necessarily a family, is a set A of words such that there is no word outside A which dominates all elements of A.1 Set A of initial sets is defined as follows. A={A|ACWA A Fia1)n...nFian)CA} (2.2.22.1) {ai an)cA Set A is a class system without further special properties. Considered in isolatioa ini- tial sets have little empirical appeal. Here are some examples; Fig. 2.2.18.1 is used as a frame of reference. It is obvious that all initial families are initial sets. F(uglu) is not an initial set, since there are words outside F(uglu)t viz. the elements of F(sadü) and F(ofcu'), which domi- nate all elements of F(uglii). F(otéc) u F(vrémeni) is an initial set, since there are no words which dominate both sets. The saturated product P+(B) of a set B which possesses no special properties is the set of words dominated by all elements of B:2 1 Marcus 1967c (5.4): 146. 2 Marcus 1967c (5.6): 149f.</page><page sequence="381">CHAPTER 2.2 WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 359 P+(B) ={w'weWA A we F+(B) } (2.2.22.2) Ò6B Here are some examples from the Russian noun graph shown in Fig. 2.2.18.1 to Fig. 2.2.18.5.

G={G|GCWA V (P+(A)*0AG = AUP+(A))} (2.2.22.7) AG A The initial set for which G = A u P+(A) is said to generate the grammatical category. An elementary grammatical category is a special case of a grammatical category, viz. one which is generated by a single initial family. Marcus illustrates his grammatical categories on the material of the Romanian ad- jectives, introduced in §2.2.21. He considers set Hi, Hi = FVrumos) u F*ifrwnoasá&gt; (2.2.22.8) and concludes that Hi is an initial set, since there is no word outside Hi which domi- nates all words in Hi. The saturated product of Hi is determined: P+(Hi) = F(maro) * 0 (2.2.22.9) So Hi generates a grammatical category. Since the saturated product of Hi is included in Hi, the grammatical category Gj generated by Hi coincides with it: G! = HiUP+(Hi) = Hi (2.2.22.10) As a result, F+(frumos) u F+(frumoasä) is a grammatical category. Marcus points out that *[...] we have obtained, by means of a formal procedure, something which from a semantic point of view corresponds to the set of qualificative adjectives without articles in the nominative singular of the posi- tive degree.3 In a similar manner, Marcus establishes the grammatical category which contains all masculine adjectives: 1 Marcus 1967c (5.6): 149. 2 Marcus 1967c (5.7): 150.

Even the Romanian neuter, the existence of which is a classic object of dispute,1 can be produced. Consider set Ffo H6 = F+(f rumos) u F+(frumoase) (2.2.23. 1 ) Set H6 is an initial set, since no words outside H6 dominate all elements of % The non- empty saturated product of H6 is P+(H6) = F(maro)*0 (2.2.23.2) Family Fimaro) is included in Hq. So grammatical category Gß is derived G6 = H6 U P+(He) = H6 (2.2.23.3) Grammatical category G6 unites adjectives characterizing nouns which are either masculine singular or feminine plural, corresponding to the group of putative neuter nouns. But Marcus' definition is unwarranted if grammatical category is to be regarded as an intensional label, i.e. if the model is to answer the K-question: (2/2/20/ ') What do we mean when we say that two words belong to the same gram- matical category? Although most grammatical categories in the traditional sense will fulfil the criteria of Marcus' definition, the converse is certainly not true. Besides Gi, G2, G3, G4, G5, and G6, there are sets of words belonging to G and lacking an empirical appeal comparable to these sets. Consider H7, H7 = F+ifrumoasá) u F+{frumosù (2.2.23.4) Since no words outside H7 dominate all elements of H7, set H7 is an initial set. The non- empty saturated product of H7 is 1 See §3.2.4.</page><page sequence="383">CHAPTER 2.2 WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 36 1 P+(H7) = Fimaro) * 0 (2.2.23.5) Family Fimaro) is included in H7. So grammatical category G7 is derived, G7 = H7 u P+(H7) = H7 (2.2.23.6) uniting adjectives which are either feminine singular or masculine plural. This is an arbitrary collection of adjectives with no empirical appeal whatsoever. The model has failed to make clear that F+(frumoasä) is in a closer relationship with F+(frumos) and F+ifrumoase) than with F+ifrumoçi). Whereas the preceding models of various grammatical categories are in fact too weak to reveal empirically interesting distinctions, the present model is too strong. According to the definition, almost anything is a grammatical category. This becomes obvious when one looks at the Russian noun graph. As an arbitrary example, consider set {sáda,¿enój} (2.2.23.7) which generates a grammatical category, since its saturated product is not empty: P+( { sáda, ¿enój}) = FiBánt u) U FiSimpanzé) * 0 (2.2.23.8) Thus, according to the definition, {sáda, ¿enój} u FiBántu) u FiSimpanzé) (2.2.23.9) is a grammatical category. These instances turn grammatical category' into a mean- ingless concept. Marcus develops several subtypes of grammatical categories, such as productive grammatical categories and normal grammatical categories, and examines many im- portant mathematical properties of S-dominance. 1 Since these categories pursue the present concept and do not take us any closer to a formal distinction between Gi and G7, they will not be treated in this book. § 2.2.24 Regressive products of final families With the Romanian adjectives, G5 is the only grammatical category in the sense of Marcus which can be singled out by its formal properties.2 Set G5 contains all adjec- tives and coincides with the regressive product of the only final family in the graph of Fig. 2.2.21.1, viz. Fimaroï G5 = F-(/naro) (2.2.24.1) This suggests that the regressive product of final families may be of some empirical interest, perhaps with respect to the determination of parts of speech. This can be checked in the Russian noun families graph of Fig. 2.2.18.1 to Fig. 2.2.18.5, where three final families are found, which can be related to the indicated grammatical features. 1 Marcus 1967c (5.9ff.): 153ff. ¿ Definition (2.222.16).</page><page sequence="384">362 PART 2 STRING MODELS Fikófe): { INAN, MASC } Fimetró): {INAN, NEUT} FiSimpanzéï {anim} (2.2.24.2) It is interesting to see that distinctions such as ANIM versus INAN and MASC INAN ver- sus NEUT INAN, which are absent or practically absent when progressive products of initial families are established, appear to correspond to final families. This can be ex- plained for animacy by the fact that, in a sense, it is not a morphological category: there are no specific forms which are exclusively animate or inanimate. Animacy is only manifest in the syntactic behaviour of a noun group as a whole.1 This does not mean that final families provide a key to at least one grammatical category. The regressive products of the Russian nouns contain words which hardly belong there if regressive products are to correspond to grammatical concepts of whatever nature. Thus, set F'imetro) includes forms of animate nouns, such as Fiïëny' while F~ièimpanzê includes inanimate forms such as Fióknamù. Here, too, revealed correspondences with tradition or metalinguistic intutition are so haphazard that the model is still remote from any serious anwers to any K-ques- tions. § 2.2.25 Connectivity classes derived from substitutability dominance; transitive closures According to Revzin, three types of tolerance can be derived from S-dominance.2 Progressive products of initial families and regressive products of final families have been discussed in the preceding sections. Revzin's third type of tolerance is substitut- ability connectivity tolerance, which was introduced for dominance relations in gen- eral in S 1.1.1 8.3 It is defined as follows. TSC = {(lui, w2) | w' e W A w2 e W A [w' -&gt; w2 V w2 -► w{l } (2.2.25.1) Thus, two words are SC-tolerant if they are connected in the dominance graph by a string of arrows all pointing in the same direction. For the Russian noun families graph of §2.2.18, relation Tsc contains the pairs (starnine, otcu) and (otcú, starnine but not (stararne, mxú). Examples of complete T^-classes in Fig. 2.2.18.1 are: Fisadui u Fiuglu) u Fimxu) u FivrémenÙ u Fikófe) (2.2.25.2) Fisadu) u F(otcé) u F(podmastér'e) u FidomfSõe) u F(kófe) (2.2.25.3) No further study was made of SOtolerance itself, but Revzin proposed a linguistic interpretation for its transitive closure, which is, by the way, identical to the transi- tive closures of the system of elementary grammatical categories and of the system of regressive products of final families. 1 This point will be returned to in §3.2.32. 2 Revzin 1967b (3.25): 95. 3 Definition (1.1.18.1h for an example, see (1.1.18.2).</page><page sequence="385">CHAPTER 2.2 WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 363 The transitive closure class F^íiu) for S-dominance of a word w is defined as fol- lows.1 FSTC(li;)= {W''W'e W A V A [w = W[ A vf = wn A (wi -* Wi-i V Wi-i -+ Wi)) } (2.2.25.4) (lui u)n)cw Ki*n Revzin proposes interpreting transitive closure classes as parts of speech.2 Thus, all words in the Russian noun families graph end up in the same part of speech. Interpretation of transitive closure classes as parts of speech is possibly meaning- ful if there is no spillover between the dominance graphs of the various traditional parts of speech. There are at least two types of possible spillover. 1 Lexical homonyms create unintended connections between different parts of speech. Spillover of this type is caused by lexical homonymy; it is discussed by Revzin. Consider the following fragment of Fig. 2.2.18.7. Fig. 2.2.25.1 ten' I I beréõ'* 1 3, 15 1 0 ¡3, 15,1/ | The word peo' is a lexical homonym of a feminine noun which means 'stove1 and a verb which means 'fry'. Such homonyms entail chains of dominance relations which connect nouns and verbs and accommodate them in a single part of speech. The problem consists in separating morphological homonymy, which is ac- counted for in the model, and lexical homonymy, which causes the bridges which connect different parts of speech. Revzin proposes two solutions. a The first solution restricts the concept of dominance to those cases where the dominating classes contain words belonging to the same paradigm.3 Thus, pea' is split into a form which is dominated by families containing forms of ¿ená, as shown in Fig. 2.2.25.2 below, and a form dominated by families containing forms of beréd'. Fig. 2.2.25.2 ¿ená* ¿end* [3, 15 | 1 Revzin speaks of closure classes {klass svjaznostù or D-classes [1967b (3.25): 95f .1. For details on transi- tive closures, see § 1.1.15.

In other words, the token péõ* is split into two types péC' and péõ*2- This entails an ad hoc extension of base compo- nent ñ' with lexical meanings. Furthermore, this method of indexing can be ap- plied to morphological homonyms as well and does not therefore furnish a formal distinction between the two kinds of homonyms. Revzin presumably implies a constraint here applying only to lexical homonyms and stipulating that contexts which admit words of one part of speech do not admit words of other parts of speech: this constraint enables us to index lexical homonyms unambiguously in all contexts. In other words, lexical homonyms of the péõ* type must belong to different classes of the transitive clo- sure of the relation of substitutability tolerance.3 Thus, the following condition must hold for péõ' Kitén 1 n Kiberéõ *) = 0 (2.2.25.5) The constraint is, however, unwarranted because there are contexts such as (daváj, X) (2.2.25.6) 'give' or 'let us' (X, nado) (2.2.25.7) 'one must' or 'is necessary' which admit ten* and beréõ' and, therefore, also péõ'' and péõ *?. the latter can- not be indexed unambiguously here. 2 The second type of spillover occurs when contexts exclusively admit certain words, thus yielding a family F, but also admit words which intuitively belong to different parts of speech. Family F then causes a connection which unites different parts of speech. This type of spillover is more essential than the first type. Recall the empty context (X, X).4 The existence of a single interjection which occurs exclusively as a separate phrase is sufficient to unite all words which can occur as a separate ut- terance in one part of speech. Assuming that such interjections as Dutch tsjonge! ('gee!'), Russian poíálujsta! ('please!') or French hélas! ('unfortunately it is true!') oc- cur only as separate phrases, their families will dominate families of all parts of speech which can occur in the empty context, nouns as well as verbs, thus uniting them into single substitutability connectivity classes. (Note that such words threaten not only the results of transitive closures but also elementary grammati- * Base components containing paradigms are treated in Part 3. 2 Revzin 1967b (3.25): 94.

It is not clear how problems of this type can be solved within the present linguistic conception. It must be concluded that there are major objections to interpretation of transitive closure classes as parts of speech. § 2.2.26 Multiple substitutability In the preceding sections, the mathematical possibilities presented by the substitut- ability relation between words and contexts have been just about exhausted. So far, contexts have been regarded as black boxes which could not be opened. In this sec- tion and the next, two proposals in which simply definable properties of contexts are used to identify morphosyntactic properties of the words which occur in them will be presented. A morphosyntactic phenomenon which cannot be described in terms of words and black-box contexts is reduplication of complete words. This is found in Indonesian. In the Indonesian example employed in §2.2.5, it was suggested that nouns make up families according to the classifiers with which they can be combined. Reduplication complicates this picture considerably: one manner of indicating plurality in this lan- guage consists in reduplication of the pluralized noun. This provides phrases of the following type. (2/2/26/1) Ayam-ayam di kampungnya "The (various) chickens in his village' (2/2/26/2) Rumah-rumah di kampungnya The (various) houses in his village* If such phrases are included in //, chances are that each noun yields its own family: there will be a potentially differential context for each noun: a context which contains the noun itself. Thus, the contexts (X, -ayam di kampungnya) (2.2.26.1) (ayam- di kampungnya) (2.2.26.2) admit ayam but exclude rumah; the contexts (X, -rumah di kampungnya) (2.2.26.3) [rumah- di kampungnya) (2.2.26.4) admit rumah but exclude ayam. If the concept of family is to retain its empirical appeal, its definition must remove the fragmenting effect which can be brought about by grammatical reduplication. One way of doing this is to replace the relation Ew of substitutability equivalence which is defined in (2.2.5.1) by relation £w of multiple substitutability equivalence, which is de- fined as follows.</page><page sequence="388">366 PART 2 STRING MODELS Ew = {(w', W2) I W[ e W A W2 e W A A ih'w'f'2W' . . . hn-'W'hn e H {hh...,hn}cH*{W) «=&gt; hiw2h2W2 . . . hn-iw2hn g tí) } (2.2.26.5) Two words w' and it&gt;2 are in the relation of multiple substitutability if, for each phrase in //, the substitution of all occurrences of w' for u&gt;2 results in another phrase in //, and vice versa. Relation Ew was defined by Marcus,1 but was never used for actual grammatical categories. Relation £w determines a partition of W. The substitution of Ew for Ew in (2.2.5.2) yields a variety of the concept of family which unites rumah and ayam in one family: the replacement of all occurrences of rumah by occurrences of ayam in {2/2/26/ Ì) provides a grammatical phrase; conversely, the replacement of all occurrences of ayam by occurrences of rumah in (2/2/26/2) also provides a grammatical phrase. The example suggests that multiple substitutability families are more effective than ordinary families. Yet, since the former are never used by the Set-theoretical School and the linguistic phenomena dealt with generally yield a one-to-one correspondence between both types of family, the latter families will continue to be employed in Part 2 and Part 3, under the assumption that more sophisticated definitions can be resorted to whenever reduplication phenomena must be accounted for. Revzin's frame phrases (fraza s ramkojl which contain pairs {w, w') of non-contigu- ous occurrences such that the replacement w entails the replacement of w'2 offer options for the identification of further types of family, similar to multiple substitution families; these options will be left out of consideration. S 2.2.27 Trybulec's syntactic cognateness: presentation The last class system of W which employs contextual features in a %i framework is the partition into classes of syntactic cognateness (sintaksiõeskoe rodstvo).3 The equivalence relation determining these classes was introduced by Trybulec as N-dis- tribution;4 Revzin also refers to the partition as Q-partition and to its classes as Q- classes.5 Revzin defines syntactic cognateness by means of the auxiliary concept of syntac- tic relatedness.6 Two words w and w&gt; are syntactically related if, for each phrase of a given length in which w is the i-th word, there is another phrase of the same length in which w' is the i-th word.7 Thus, the relation between two words is not based on their 1 Relation R in Marcus 1967c (5.3): 145. 2 Revzin 1967b (7.49): 184. 3 The adjective {cognate) is introduced in Revzin's English paper 1967c [{4}. 4181. In Revzin 1974: 137-138 and Revzin 1977 (4.1.4): 132 sintaksiõeski rodstvennyj and sintaksiõeskoe rodstvo are used. In Revzin 1967b, sintaksiõeski rodstvennyj una sintaksiõeskaja rodstvennost* are used to refer to an altogether different concept, which is rendered in the present volumes as syntactic kinship (see §4. 1.8). 4 Trybulec 1967a (5&gt;. 36. 5 Revzin 1967c {4h 418; Revzin 1974: 137, Revzin 1977 (4.1.4): 132. b The English term is from Revzin 1967c [(4): 418].

The set of contexts is in fact partitioned into sets of contexts with the same num- bers of words in their strings. Each set of this partition is the numeric image (or N-im- age) of the contexts which it contains, and can be labelled accordingly. Let the num- ber of elements in a string h be denoted as n[h). Then the numeric image kn(h', h^) of context (hi, /i2&gt; is defined as follows. Hhl, h2&gt; = (n(hi), n(h2» (2.2.27.1) The definition which determines syntactic relatedness is based on a set /TN(u&gt;) of N- contexts of word w. the numeric images of the contexts in ¡Aw).1 K"(w) = {(t, j) 1 0 a t A 0 * j a V (ufi' k"(w) } (2.2.27.2) (h'th2)eKiw) Here are some examples. Set K^(some) contains the N-context (2, 1) because it occurs in the sentence before this one. Since most words can occur in many positions in a phrase, examples of words which do not occur in certain positions are linguistically more informative. The English word the cannot occur on its own as a separate phrase: this implies that it cannot occur in the empty context (X, X), the numeric image of which is (0, (ft (0, 0) € K"(the) (2.2.27.3) Since the cannot occur at the end of a phrase, (2.2.27.3) can be expanded: A 0, 0) é K*(the) (22.27 A) 121 Syntactic relatedness £&gt;N(iu) can now be defined in terms of N-contexts: DN - {{wt W) I w e W A W e W A K"(w) c *%/) } (2.2.27.5) Relation DN is the relation of substitutability dominance which is defined for the ad- mission relation between W and tfN. The corresponding relation EN of substitutability equivalence is Revzin's syntactic cognateness: EN = {(iu, w') | w e W A w' € W A K*(w) = tf%/) } (2.2.27.6) Relation EN is an equivalence relation defining a partition of W into N-families. As an example, consider, the English word a and the following contexts. (X, boy cries) (2.2.27.7) (X, boys cry) (2.2.27.8) Now a does not belong to the family of the since, unlike the, it cannot precede nouns in the plural: - on line 1 1 from the top read b instead of b (hard sign); - on line 12 from the top read a instead of aft, - on line 13 from the top remove bt between ty-l and b. 1 Cf. definition (2.2.3.1).</page><page sequence="390">368 PART 2: STRING MODELS (2.2.27.7) e K(the) A (2.2.27.8) e K(the) (2.2.27.9) (2.2.27.7) g K(a) A (2.2.27.8) É Ma) (2.2.27.10) But, since the N-images of (2.2.27.7) and (2.2.27.8) coincide, chances are that a belongs to the same N-f amily as the: (0,2) g K^(the) n tfN(a) (2.2.27.11) Of course a and the will only be syntactically cognate if all of their N-contexts coin- cide. § 2.2.28 Trybulec's syntactic cognateness: applications Generally speaking, if syntactic cognateness is to have any empirical appeal, the problem is to find words that are not syntactically cognate. Given two words and a phrase in which one of them occurs, it will nearly always be possible to find another phrase of the same length in which the other word occurs in the same position. Yet, Trybulec and Revzin consider three options as realistic. Trybulec expects results if His limited to a set of short diagnostic phrases.1 In fact his exemplification is limited to a set of Polish phrases, all of which have the structure ADVERB + VERB + NUMERAL + ADJECTIVE + NOUN (2.2.28. 1) It is clear that this selection ensures full coincidence of N-families and parts of speech. But the problem with diagnostic phrases is how to obtain them without refer- ence to the concepts for which they are diagnostic.2 Also the perspectives of this op- tion are limited: as soon as a more realistic variety of Polish is adopted in which ad- jectives are allowed to follow nouns, their corresponding N-families collapse. Trybulec's second proposal is to restrict the application of the model to those con- texts which have a limited number of elements in either the first or second string.3 The distribution of Russian prepositions, for instance, is marked by their absence in the last position of a phrase,4 which implies that the N-context (x, 0) (2.2.28.2) where x stands for any positive integer or zero, does not admit prepositions. Conversely, the Polish reflexive particle sic cannot occupy the first position: it is excluded by N-context (0, x) (2.2.28.3) Also, the English articles cannot occupy the last position in a phrase. Similarly, the Polish conjunction lub Cor') is stated to be excluded by both (2.2.28.2) and (2.2.28.3) since it presumably occurs only between alternatives, whereas dorn Chouse') is excluded neither by (2.2.28.2) nor by (2.2.28.3). 1 Trybulec 1967a (5): 36. 2 Cf. §2.0.8. 3 Trybulec 1967a (5&gt;. 36. 4 With a few exceptions, such as zâ ('in favour'), but these must be ruled out as different words.</page><page sequence="391">CHAPTER 2.2 WORD-CONTEXT FEATURE SYSTEMS 369 This option is more interesting. There are no formal objections to restrictions on sets of contexts along these lines because they can be defined and applied in an ob- jective manner. Of course, prepositions, articles, particles and classifiers are not ma- jor parts of speech, but they do provide a headway. True, in Trybulec's examples classes are identified by the number of zeroes in their N-contexts: this makes the use of N-contexts redundant because zero in numeric contexts corresponds one-to-one to the empty string X (a universal which is an artefact of meta-linguistic devices). But Revzin expects that, if the harp is taken to be a set of kernel phrases of specifiable length, classifiers will end up in the same N-family in languages such as Vietnamese, which are supposed to have no flexion (i.e. one-member paradigms) and to have fixed word order.1 Revzin himself proposes, as a third option, to switch between N-families and ordi- nary families in order to define parts of speech. Every phrase generates a set of ab- stract G-structures, which consist of strings in which one of the words is replaced by the symbol of its N-family.2 For example, the phrase (2/2/28/1) Ón lezál pod stolóm. 'he/it lay under the table' yields the G-structures (FN(dn), lezál pod, stolóm) (2.2.28.4) (d/], FN(/eia7), pod, stolóm) (2.2.28.5) (ón, le¿ál FN(pod), stolóm) (2.2.28.6) (ón, leìàl, pod, F^(stolóm)) (2.2.28.7) Similarly, classifiers can be replaced by the symbol for classifier. Now, if the defini- tion of 'family' is applied to the set of G-structures instead of H, other parts of speech can be identified. Thus, in Indonesian, words which are accompanied by classifiers make up a single family as defined for G-structures. The mathematical sides of syntactic cognateness and G-structures were studied extensively by Trybulec and Revzin, but especially by Popescu.3 The linguistic as- pects received less attention: perhaps this is the only derivation of fli whose possi- bilities were not exhaustively explored. At least two linguistic problems must be sorted out. 1 Syntactic cognateness defines two kinds of classes: small specific classes, such as the class of classifiers, and vast non-specific classes. Verbs and nouns, for example, are not likely to be yielded as different classes. The small classes serve as catalyzers for the decomposition of the large classes. The question is how the model distinguishes between the two types of class. It is not improbable that only the number of elements of a class can provide a criterion. Significant quantitative 1 Revzin 1967c (6): 420; Revzin 1974: 138; Revzin 1977 (4.1.4): 132. 2 Revzin 1967c (5): 419. 3 Popescu 1970.</page><page sequence="392">370 PART 2 STRING MODELS differences have been observed to characterize the distinction between grammati- cal and lexical elements before.1 2 What empirical interest will the resulting classes have? If the G-structure family yielded by preceding classifiers is the set of nouns in a language, the results are interesting for what the Set-theoretical School calls amorphic languages: lan- guages with exclusively one-word paradigms. But the G-structure families yielded for the Slavic languages seem less interesting. G-structures in which prepositions are replaced by their N-families will not only fail to distinguish between adjectives and nouns, but also to unite all nouns in one class: noun forms in the locative case are always preceded by a preposition,2 whereas noun forms in the nominative case never are.3 It may be possible to approximate part of speech' by introducing vari- eties of G-structures (say, structures in which two or more words are replaced by the labels of their N-families) and by switching between different structures. But the interest of such methods for the present study will decrease correspondingly. We are interested not in language-specific manipulations, yielding only approxi- mations of linguistic concepts, but in definitions yielding non-counter-intuitive re- sults for any language. Position-based models, as abstract structures, are probably of greater interest to other areas of linguistics, such as the internal structure of words. (In fact, words can be defined as stretches of morphemes in which their positions are regulated, in con- tradistinction to larger stretches.4) Here the order approach has resulted in a special type of grammar: order or rank grammar (grammatika porjadkov). In the Soviet Union rank grammar was applied to Turkic languages by Revzin &amp; JuldaSeva and Pines, among others.5 The principle is of course not limited to Eastern Europe: order grids of some sort are found in Gleason 196 12 and Ebeling 1978.6 Revzin &amp; JuldaSeva have ex- trapolated rank grammar to word groups of certain types.7 Revzin also transposes the principles of rank grammar to a syntactically structured type of string called dependency path' this proposal will be discussed in §4.3.3 and in §4.4.7 and §4.4.8. 1 In Herdan 1966 (1.3.2): 48-49, the numerical parameters which divide grammar and lexicon are (magni- tude of) frequency of occurrence, and physical size and complexity. Herdan could not apply the present crite- rion, viz. class size, as it presupposes a definition of the classes whose size must serve as the criterioa A definition of grammatical items employing (the magnitude of) a different type of class (the semantic para- digms of a language) is found in Van Helden 1979/1993 &lt;2Y 1210, definition (B.13). 2 With the exception of some instances of inversion of numerals and counted objects, as in: (2/2/28/2) kilometrax v pjatidesjati 'at about fifty kilometres', literally "kilometres (locative) in fifty (locative)1 These instances are left out of consideratioa 0 With the exception, again, of the preposition za when meaning 'sort of, which will be left out of con- sideration. The fact that a language in which the described situation occurs is plausible is sufficient to falsi- fy the model. The example of the locative is used by Revzin [1967c (6): 4201 to illustrate problems with N- families, but, as we see, G-structure families do not offer a solution. 4 A formal definition of word1 based on this property is proposed in Van Helden 1979/1993 i2&gt;. 1209, defi- nition (B.9). 5 Revzin &amp; JuldaSeva 1969; Pines 1973. 6 Gleason 19612 (9&gt;. 11 Iff.; Ebeling 1978 (3.204): 442ff.

We have seen that the results are generally not to be demeaned as approxi- mations of linguistic concepts, but are by no means capable of serving as a conceptual foundation for such concepts, in spite of attractive terms such as grammatical atom. A general discussion of the approach will be found at the end of Part 2. But first the models based on the mirror image of the models discussed in this chapter, i.e. models derived from context-word feature systems, will be presented.</page><page sequence="394">CHAPTER 2.3: CONTEXT-WORD FEATURE SYSTEMS §2.3.1 Context-word feature systems as models of 'case' The preceding chapter discussed classes that are determined on the set of words on account of their being admitted by contexts. Admission by contexts was regarded as a feature characterizing words. In the present chapter, the converse approach will be explored: we shall examine classes of contexts which obtain if the admission of words is regarded as a feature of a context. It goes without saying that the mathematical concepts which were defined in Chapter 2.2 will remain valid if contexts and words are interchanged: all types of relations and class systems for words have their counterparts for contexts.1 So Chapter 2.3 mainly discusses new labels and reality claims for the same mathematics. Although the Set-theoretical School extensively applies the idea of interchanging elements and contexts while keeping the mathematics constant, the idea has never been launched or made explicit. Only later did the Swede Karlgren point out that: [...] linguistic classification is dual, being a classification of linguistic elements by means of the classes of contexts where they can appear and a classification of contexts by means of classes of elements they can contain. This is not a vicious circle but a desirable one L.].2 On the other hand, the Set-theoretical School has carried the idea beyond mere pro- grammatic statements, producing the models of this chapter. Whereas a broad variety of reality claims is found for word classes, either making an immediate appeal to empirical interest or being connected with different linguistic labels, all classes of contexts are connected with the single label case. In the follow- ing sections, the definitions of structures will be presented and their correspondence with empirical observations of case' will be discussed. The nature of this correspon- dence, viz. their possible connection with the label case, is discussed in § 2.3.8. S 2.3.2 Substitutability tolerance of contexts The contextual counterpart TK of substitutability tolerance is defined as follows. 7* = {{khk2)'kie KAk2e K A Wtiti) n W(fc2) * 8} (2.3.2.1) i.e. contexts k' and k2 are Tsubstitutable if there is at least one word which is admit- ted by both k' and k2. An example. The contexts (X, bezál tuda") (2.3.2.2) 'ran (masculine) there ' (X, belala tuda) (2.3.2.3) 'ran (feminine) there' (X, bezálo tuda) (2.3.2.4) 'ran (neuter) there' are not T-substitutable at first sight: context (2.3.2.2) admits only masculine subjects; context (2.3.2.3) admits only feminine subjects; context (2.3.2.4) admits only neuter 1 An exception is multiple substitutability (cf. §2.2.26). 1 Karlgren 1971: 70. 372</page><page sequence="395">CHAPTER 2.3: CONTEXT-WORD FEATURE SYSTEMS 373 subjects. But the existence of the word èimpanzé ('chimpanzee'), which can be mascu- line, feminine and neuter, assigns (2.3.2.2), (2.3.2.3) and (2.3.2.4) to the same contextual T-substitutability class. The example shows that the results of T-substitutability for contexts are, like those of T-substitutability for words, vulnerable. The existence of one word which fails to impose a given selection restriction is sufficient for T-substitutability to blur the restriction. Substitutability tolerance of contexts was therefore hardly studied in set-theoretical linguistics. Revzin defines a concept labelled equivalence with respect to a word, which is essentially the same as substitutability tolerance, but no applica- tions are indicated.1 S 2.3.3 Substitutability equivalence of contexts: kappa families The contextual counterpart EK to substitutability equivalence of words is defined as follows. EK= {(khk2)'k{ e KAk2e KA W&amp;i) = W(fc2)} (2.3.3.1) Thus, k' and k2 are E-substitutable, or in Revzin's terms equally capacious (ravnoem- kijl2 if they admit the same words. Here is an example. (já õitál X) (2.3.3.2) 'I read (preterite)' (já pisál X) (2.3.3.3) 'I wrote' Contexts (2.3.3.2) and (2.3.3.3) are equally capacious, assuming that both (2.3.3.2) and (2.3.3.3) admit the same nouns, such as gazétu ('newspaper') and ¿urnál ('journal'), and the same adverbs. Now consider the following contexts.

Substitutability equivalence determines a partition. The classes of these partitions are labelled cases in the early models but, as contexts (2.3.3.4) and (2.3.3.5) show, the immediate interpretation of substitutability equivalence as cases yields counter-intu- itive results. Therefore, the label kappa family will be used here: it has no independent 1 Cf. Revzin 1966b (3.23): 66. The relation is also mentioned in Marcus 1967c (6.24): 217.

Fik)={k''k'e KA(k,k')e EK] (2.3.3.6) It is unexpectedly troublesome trying to find morphosyn tactic phenomena with empir- ical appeal which show an obvious correspondence to kappa families. The most straightforward example of which the present writer is aware is the following, which was recalled by Lyons.2 In written French, the use of the subjunctive mood is largely restricted to a well- defined set of contexts, which do not admit the indicative mood. An example: (je ne crois pas qu' il, X) (2.3.3.7) 'I do not believe that he' which admits, say, vienne ('cornes (subjunctive)'). The indicative mood is admitted by other contexts, which exclude the subjunctive: (je crois qu' il, X) (2.3.3.8) 'I believe that he* which admits, say, vient ('comes (indicative)'). Thus, (2.3.3.7) and (2.3.3.8) admit decidedly different sets of words and therefore belong to different kappa families, which can be interpeted as the subjunctive and indicative moods, respectively. But Lyons points to the context (Dieu vous, X) (2.3.3.9) 'God - you (oblique case)' which admits both subjunctive forms (e.g. bénisse, 'bless') and indicative forms (e.g. bénit, 'blesses'). If phrases such as (2/3/3/1) Dieu vous bénisse. 'God bless you' are not dismissed as fixed expressions, then (2.3.3.9) qualifies as moodless or as be- longing to a separate mood, which must be considered counter-intuitive. It is shown below that the same happens to case1. Contexts (2.3.3.4) and (2.3.3.5) sug- gest that the discrepancy between cases and kappa families is caused by interference on the part of 'gender. For this reason, Revzin examines an example of kappa families of noun-admitting contexts in a language where word class phenomena do not interfere. Revzin's example was taken from Uzbek,3 but since Uzbek does not in this respect deviate from other Turkic languages, and Turkish data are more easily ac- cessible to the present writer, Revzin's example has been converted into Turkish. The following contexts are considered. (bu,iyi) (2.3.3.10) 'this'; 'is good' (ben, okulu gördüm) (2.3.3. 1 1 ) T; 'school of it saw' 1 The term K-family would of course be more obvious but must be reserved for the type of family which was developed by Kolmogorov and will be introduced in §5.33.

So the contexts find themselves in different kappa families. Each of the kappa families corresponds to one of the six cases which are assumed for Turkish: 1 the absolute case F(2.3.3. 10); 2 the genitive case F(2.3.3. 11); 3 the dative case F(2.3.3. 12); 4 the definite object case FÍ2.3.3.13); 5 the locative case FÍ2.3.3. 14); 6 the ablative case FÍ2.3.3.15).</page><page sequence="398">376 PART 2 STRING MODELS Here there are no word-class phenomena which interfere with case. Note that, with the exception of (2.3.3.10) and (2.3.3.13), the sets of words admitted by the given con- texts do not mutually overlap. However, as in the example of the French subjunctive, there are other types of context which distort the picture sketched above. Revzin mentions an Uzbek equiva- lent to the Turkish context (ben yann, gidiyorum) (2.3.3.22) 'I am going tomorrow' which admits the following words. W(2.3.3.22)= {?ehre '(to) town', Rehiriere '(to) towns', çehirden '(from) town', çehirlerden '(from) towns', babaya '(to) father', babalara '(to) fathers', babadan '(from) father', babalardan '(from) fathers', aneye '(to) mother', andere '(to) mothers' aneden '(from) mother', anelerden Vrom) mothers', . . . } (2.3.3.23) Thus, the set of words admitted by (2.3.3.22), containing all words admitted by context (2.3.3.12) (the dative) and by context (2.3.3.15) (the ablative), is different from the sets of words admitted by any other context: therefore, (2.3.3.22) belongs to a separate kappa family and produces an unexpected additional case in the model. The following context, which is not mentioned by Revzin (and may not have an equivalent in Uzbek), produces another unexpected kappa family. (bu ?ey, gibi) (2.3.3.24) 'this thing'; 'is like' The postposition gibi ('like') generally admits nouns in the absolute case, so that WÍ2.3.3.24) would seem to coincide with WÍ2.3.3.10). However, gibi governs the genitive for several personal, demonstrative and inerrogative pronouns, such as ben CD and bu ('this').1 Thus, WÍ2.3.3.24) contains genitive forms such as benim CD and bunun ('this'), which are not contained in W(2.3.3.10). Consequently, M2.3.3.24) represents a separate case in the kappa family model. Thus, the above Turkish example provides three varieties of non-trivial overlap between the sets admitted by two given contexts k and k'. 1 Set W(fc') is included in W(fc); in the example: WÍ2.3.3. 10) * WÍ2.3.3. 13) A WÍ2.3.3. 10) c W(2.3.3. 13) (2.3.3.25) 2 Set W(fc) is the union of W(fc') and a set W(fc") of words admitted by a third context k"' in the example: WÍ2.3.3. 12) * W(2.3.3. 15) A WÍ2.3.3.22) = WÍ2.3.3. 12) u WÍ2.3.3. 15) (2.3.3.26) 3 Set W(fc) is a proper subset of the union of W(fc') and a set W(fc") of words admitted by a third context k"' in the example: 1 Cf.

This does not mean that all problems are solved: consider the question of how the model treats an occurrence of what is traditionally called the absolute case, say ?ehir, in a definite object context, say (2.3.3.13). This problem also exists for Russian: consider context (já viïu krasotú v, X) (2.3.3.28) 'I see beauty in' If (2.3.3.28) is assumed to admit both locative I forms, such as side ('garden'), and lo- cative II forms, such as sadú ('garden'),1 a model cannot avoid the question of whether an occurrence of sáde in (2.3.3.28) is to be qualified as locative I or locative II. This question will be extensively dealt with in the case models of the Set-theoretical School. The way in which the model handles instance 2 is not corroborated by tradition and intuition: no special case is assumed for Turkish to correspond to F(2.3.3.22). Contexts which admit two or more traditional cases are also found in Russian. Zaliznjak has drawn attention to contexts of the following type.2 (dást, X) (2.3.3.29) 'will give' Context (2.3.3.29) admits not only accusative forms {¿end, 'wife'), which indicate the given object, but also dative forms for the person or thing receiving (¿ene, 'wife') and nominative forms for the thing or person giving (ze/ia, 'wife'). We are dealing here with what could be called contextual homonymy on the analogy of morphological homon- ymy, filling a gap in the terminological system of the Set-theoretical School.3 The case models treated in this study contain several proposals for ruling out the kappa fam- ilies of these contexts as separate cases. The way in which the model handles instance 3 is not corroborated by tradition and intuition. No separate case is assumed for Turkish to account for case selection with postpositions of the gibi type: the postpositions are simply said to take the absolute case for most nouns and the genitive for a few others. This instance is not assumed to occur in Russian, although the genitive II approaches it: context4 (u menjá net, X) (2.3.3.30) 'I have no', literally 'with me is not' admits genitive II forms (e.g. õájm 'tea') of words which have them, while genitive II forms are always identical to the corresponding dative forms. As a difference with the gibi instance, however, (2.3.3.30) admits genitive I forms (õaja, 'tea') besides genitive II forms. In its pure form, the gibi pattern is marginal in Russian, and the Set-theoretical 1 Cf. the discussion on contexts (2.2.7.24) and (2.2.7.25). 2 Cf. Revzin 1967b (6.40): 141. But V.A.

It will only be discussed in connection with the more sophisticated models to be presented in Part 5.1 Within the conception of language as determined by base component ñ', the obvi- ous way of dealing with unintended cases is by the introduction of inequality between contexts. Some contexts must be considered more relevant to case' than others. This will result in a hierarchy of contexts, as we have seen for words in Chapter 2.2, or in the elimination of contexts being taken into consideration. These options are offered by the relation of substitutability dominance. S 2.3.4 Substitutability dominance of contexts The contextual counterpart DK to substitutability dominance of words is defined as follows. D* = Kfci, k2) I fci e K A k2 e K A Yfik') C W(fc2)} (2.3.4.1) In this chapter, the fact that (kb k2) g Z* (2.3.4.2) can be denoted as k[ -► k2 (2.3.4.3) In Revzin's terminology, (2.3.4.3) indicates that k2 is broader or more capacious {bolee emkij) than k', and k' is less broad or less capacious (menee emkij) than k2.2 If fcl -* k2 A ki -* k2 (2.3.4.4) then contexts k' and k2 are equally broad or equally capacious (ravnoemk i j' i.e. E-substitutable, and belong to the same kappa family. The progressive product F+ik) and the regressive product F~(k) of a context k are defined as follows. F+(k) = {k''k'e KAk^k'} (2.3.4.5) fft) = { k' | k' e K A k' - k } (2.3.4.6) It goes without saying that, for kappa family F(k) of context k, F(k) - F+(k) n F~(k) (2.3.4.7) set Kx of initial contexts and set Kf of final contexts are defined as follows. 1 See the discussion on the "po-case" in §5J25ff. 2 Revzin is inconsistent in the use of these terms and in the directions of his arrows. In Revzin 1967b (322): 90, the context which admits the smaller set of words is called more capacious and dominates the context which admits the larger set of words. In an example in Revzin 1967b (6.40): 144, both the termi- nology and the arrows are reversed here the contexts which admit the larger sets are called more capacious, while arrows point at contexts admitting the smaller sets. This usage is continued in Revzin 1977 (4.2.2): 143. To add to the confusion, the present study employs Revzin's new terminology (i.e. the contexts ad- mitting the larger sets are called more capacious) but must follow Revzin's old arrow directions in order to be consistent with the use of arrows in other feature systems (cf. S 1.1.24 and §2.2.16). Thus, arrows run from less capacious to more capacious contexts.</page><page sequence="401">CHAPTER 2.3: CONTEXT-WORD FEATURE SYSTEMS 379 Kl = {It | k e K A F~(k) c F+(k)} (2.3.4.8) Kf = {k | k e K A F+(fc) c F"(/c) } (2.3.4.9) The families which contain the initial contexts are initial kappa families. Their empiri- cal appeal will now be illustrated with an example from Russian. S 2.3.5 Initial contextual families for Russian nouns In the following example, the kappa families and initial kappa families are examined which result from the confrontation of a selected set of Russian contexts with the set of words given in §2.2.9. The set of selected contexts does not contain contexts which cause interference on the part of word class and number phenomena.1 The resulting regularity is therefore rather artificial but provides a good example of the essence of the approach. Some complications which are left out of consideration here will be pointed out in §2.3.7. The following contexts are considered. (X, mné zävtra dâst svobódu) (2.3.5. 1) 'will give me freedom tomorrow' which takes the nominative singular; (u, ést' nedostátok) (2.3.5.2) 'has a defect' (cf.

It is assumed that these contexts have been matched with the forms of the words listed in §2.2.9. Each resulting phrase is assumed to have been checked on grammati- cality. B.A. Uspenskij's grammaticality criterion2 is enlisted in order to abstract from lexically conditioned restrictions on H. Thus, phrases which native informants judge doubtful or impossible, such as (2/3/5/3) below, and even (2/3/5/4), are treated as if they were grammatical. (2/3/5/3) ?Ön pólon oknóm.

The progressive products of the initial kappa families, which might be called elemen- tary contextual categories, provide the following clear-cut correspondence with the Russian cases.1 F+(2.3.5. 1 ): nominative (singular) F+(2.3.5.2): genitive F+(2.3.5.4): dative F+(2.3.5.5): accusative F+(2.3.5.6): instrumental F+(2.3.5.8): locative (2.3.5.17) The present model was never proposed.2 A possible reason is that it does not cater for secondary cases such as the locative II or the genitive II. Also, it yields counter- traditional, and perhaps counter-intuitive, results in other languages. Consider the Turkish example of §2.3.3. Here the kappa family which contains context (2.3.3.22) is not an initial kappa family and does not generate an elementary contextual category, thus confirming our intuition. But context (2.3.3.13) also fails to generate a separate elementary contextual category, which implies that the definite object case in Turkish is denied case status by the model. One can of course blame this on interference on the part of a separate category of def initeness, but this may be far-fetched: definite- ness is not regularly manifested elsewhere in the language. On the other hand, defi- nite objects are often marked in languages which do not have a full-fledged morpho- logical case system: compare the Persian suffix -rã, the Spanish preposition a, and the * The question of whether sets of contexts are considered to be cases or only to correspond to cases will be discussed in §2.3.8. 2 That is, within a fl i framework; Zaliznjak provides a mathematically equivalent definition using an ex- panded »2 base component in its preliminary derivations, which will be discussed in §3.3.15.</page><page sequence="404">382 PART 2: STRING MODELS Romanian preposition pe.1 The decisive argument in favour of including the definite object case in a single case system with the other cases is the fact that the case end- ings are mutually exclusive. But this argument cannot be used in a model in which or- thographical words are treated as black boxes. S 2.3.6 Quasi-Initial families of contexts The Turkish problem described above is solved if a property is exploited which dif- ferentiates between (2.3.3.13) and (2.3.3.22). Zaliznjak proposed to take only those kappa families into consideration which do not admit the union of the sets of contexts admitted by other contexts relevant to the definition of case1.2 Technically, Zaliznjak's proposal provides the contextual counterpart of DobruSin's quasi-elementary gram- matical categories: the set of contexts which remains after removing the unwanted contexts is set KQ1 of quasi-initial contexts, which is defined as follows.3 K* = {k | k e K A A (Wfti) U . . . U W(fcn) = W(fc) * F'k{) u . . . U Fikn) = Fik))} {kit...tkn}cK (2.3.6.1) The progressive products of the kappa families containing quasi-initial contexts can be labelled quasi-elementary contextual categories. In the Turkish example, it is clear that (2.3.3.22) does not generate a quasi-elementary contextual category, since it admits the union of WÍ2.3.3.12) and W(2.3.3.15). Context (2.3.3.13), on the other hand, does yield a quasi-elementary contextual category: although W(2.3.3. 10) c W(2.3.3. 13) A W(2.3.3. 13) ' WÍ2.3.3. 10) * 0 (2.3.6.2) there is no context x such that WÍ2.3.3.13) ' W(2.3.3.10) = W(x) (2.3.6.3) The quasi-elementary contextual categories in the Russian example correspond to the following Russian cases: F+(2.3.5. 1 ): nominative (singular) F+(2.3.5.2): genitive F+(2.3.5.3): genitive II F+(2.3.5.4): dative F+(2.3.5.5): accusative F+(2.3.5.6): instrumental F+(2.3.5.7): locative II F+(2.3.5.8): locative (2.3.6.4) The difference between the elementary contextual categories and the quasi-elemen- tary contextual categories consists in the genitive II and the locative II. Note that the graph in Fig. 2.3.5. 1 assigns to these cases a subordinate position with respect to 1 The Spanish and Romanian instances will be returned to in §3.1.3. §3.2.15 and §5.71. 2 Revzin [1977 (4.2.1): 142] attributes the idea to Zaliznjak. The latter [1967b (2.4): 40] employs the method in a model with a more complex base component, which will be discussed in §5.1 Off. In a different phras- ing, the idea is also found in Revzin 1967b (6.40): 143. 3 Cf. definition (2.2.19.8); for W(fc) cf. definition (2.2.3.2).</page><page sequence="405">CHAPTER 2.3: CONTEXT-WORD FEATURE SYSTEMS 383 the genitive and the locative, whereas the locative is subordinate to the locative II and the genitive II is subordinate to the dative in the graph of Fig. 2.2.18.1 and Fig. 2.2.18.3, which illustrates the model of (quasHelementary grammatical category. Thus, we have seen that the identification of initial and quasi-initial kappa families provides a solution for redundant cases yielded by contexts that are more capacious than the contexts which intuitively correspond to cases.1 Contexts that are less ca- pacious than the required contexts will be discussed in the following section. 8 2.3.7 Gender and number interference The Russian noun contexts example which was employed in the preceding sections to illustrate the correspondence between cases and context-word feature systems is to a large extent artificial, as any manifestations of were excluded. It will be examined here what happens if gender' and number' are taken into account. The set of contexts (2.3.5.1) to (2.3.5.16) is expanded with the following contexts. (bo/Sdji mné závtra dást svobödu) (2.3.7. 1) 'the big (masculine singular)', 'will give me freedom tomorrow' which takes the nominative singular of masculine nouns; (boVèóe, mné závtra dást svobódu) (2.3.7.2) 'the big (neuter singular)', 'will give me freedom tomorrow' which takes the nominative singular of neuter nouns; ibol'Sája, mné závtra dást svobódu) (2.3.7.3) 'the big (feminine singular)', 'will give me freedom tomorrow* which takes the nominative singular of feminine nouns; (boVSie, mné závtra dadút svobódu) (2.3.7.4) 'the big (plural)', 'will give me freedom tomorrow' which takes the nominative of plural nouns; (u menjá ést' X) (2.3.7.5) 'I have' which takes the nominative of all nouns. When the dominance relations of these contexts are integrated into the graph of Fig. 2.3.5.1, the following graph is obtained.2 * Note that, for the given examples, the same results would have been arrived at if the contextual counter- part of para-initial families had been employed (cf. §2.220). ¿ The stars and daggers have been inserted for future reference (in §23.9).</page><page sequence="406">384 PART 2 STRING MODELS Fig. 2.3.7.1 (2.3.7.

Kappa family M2.3.5.1), which corresponds to the nominative, loses its status as an initial kappa family and does not qualify as a quasi-initial kappa family, since it admits the union of the sets admitted by (2.3.7.1), (2.3.7.2) and (2.3.7.3). The context which is really relevant for the nominative, viz. (2.3.7.5), ends up somewhere in the middle of the graph and apparently does not distinguish itself from other contexts in that position. Similar results can be obtained for other cases if the relevant contexts are added. This is an essential drawback of the model. Two methods were proposed for dis- carding insufficiently capacious contexts. Both proposals involve an extension of the base component. Either a partition into paradigms or a partition into numbers must be added to it. The proposed solutions will be introduced and discussed in Part 3, which deals with base components containing paradigms.1 Thus, due to interference on the part of other categories, set-theoretical linguis- tics has not succeeded in establishing a full correspondence between, on the one hand, the results of any operations on the relation of substitutability dominance on the 1 See §3.3.13 and §3.3.14.</page><page sequence="407">CHAPTER 2.3: CONTEXT-WORD FEATURE SYSTEMS 385 basis of Hi and, on the other hand, case1 as an intuitive notion or a concept of tradi- tional grammar.1 Yet, in the remaining part of this chapter it will be assumed that somehow a crite- rion for the removal of insufficiently capacious contexts from the set of relevant contexts has been found, even if the assumption may be unwarranted. The assumption enables us to deal with certain other interesting aspects of the model. S 2.3.8 The domain of 'case' The preceding sections of this chapter have discussed manipulation of contexts ac- cording to the sets of words admitted by their elements. Contexts were accommodated in class systems, and the resulting classes were accommodated in hierarchies or eliminated. Attention was concentrated on the correspondence between the struc- tures of the results of these manipulations and "case1, rather than their identification as case' or cases, - the reason being that the terminological and interpretational shifts which took place in the Set-theoretical School would have clouded the mathe- matical picture. The present section discusses the identificational aspect: which sets or subsets make up the domain of case? As far as base component Hi is concerned, there are three possible domains over which case1 can be defined in a non-counterintuitive way: 1 a (or the) set of (grammatically correct) contexts; 2 a (or the) set of words; 3 a (or the) set of (grammatically correct) pairs of contexts and words. The domain of case1 has shifted through the years. The history of the shifts is as fol- lows. In the earlier models, case1 was identified with the partition determined by substi- tutability equivalence of contexts (Ety the classes of these partition, the kappa fami- lies, were labelled cases. In 1962, Revzin attributes this definition of case' to Kolmo- gorov,2 which contradicts V.A. Uspenskij's 1957 rendering of Kolmogorov's definition.3 Subsequently, Marcus attributes the definition to Revzin, labelling it Revzin*s case.4 Marcus labels substitutability equivalence absolute equivalence when dealing with Revzin's model, but in his own model he introduces a mathematically identical relation by the label strong equivalence {équivalence au sens fort).5 Finally, Revzin attributes to Marcus the present definition of case1 as the set of kappa families, when Revzin himself has already modified the original definition.6 Thus, in the early models, the domain of case is considered to coincide with the set of contexts. Cases are classes of contexts and each context belongs to a case. After the introduction of the distinction between relevant and irrelevant contexts, the definition of case entails a system of kappa families which covers only a part of 1 Even the extension of the base component with the set of paradigms is not sufficient to provide a fully satisfactory solutioa as will be shown in §3.3.13 and §3.3.14. 2 Revzin 1966b (3.23): 66. 3 Uspenskij, V.A., 1957/1993 (Ik 1201: Kolmogorov's case model will be treated in §5.38ff. 4 Marcus 1963c: 606; Marcus 1967c (6.24): 2.17. 5 Marcus 1967c (6.4): 198. ° Revzin 1967b (6.40): 140.</page><page sequence="408">386 PART 2 STRING MODELS the set of contexts. First Revzin introduces the set of diagnostic phrases,1 from which diagnostic contexts2 are derived. The latter do not suffer from word class and number interference: the insufficiently capacious contexts discussed in §2.3.7 are dismissed as non-diagnostic.3 This reduces the domain of case1 to a subset of the set of contexts. Subsequently, the kappa families of diagnostic contexts which are not quasi-initial (cf. §2.3.6) are disposed of, leaving only the quasi-initial diagnostic kappa families. These kappa families are not identified with case but are called case-forming (pade- ¿eobrazujuSõij).4 The label case is now assigned to the sets of words admitted by the case-forming contexts.5 Revzin points out that this use of the label is more in ac- cordance with linguistic usage.6 Thus, the domain of case' has shifted from contexts to words. Such terminological shifts are trivial as long as there is one-to-one correspon- dence between the objects qualified: since the set of objects which is characterized by a set of features is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of features charac- terizing this set, it does not matter whether case is assigned to a kappa family or to the set of words determining the family. But this is not necessarily true when kappa families are hierarchized or eliminated or if certain mathematical properties are as- signed to the object of the case definition. If, for example, case1 is expected to be de- fined as a category, it must cover a predetermined domain and cases may not overlap other cases completely.7 Then if the definition does not accommodate certain con- texts in case classes, case cannot be considered a category for contexts, or if cer- tain classes of words yielded by a definition are contained in other classes yielded by the same definition, "case cannot be a category of words. Below, the domains of the definitions of case1 which have been presented so far are checked for intuitiveness. There are two possible ways in which the determination of the domain can contradict intuition: either the definition yields cases containing con- texts or words which are not usually considered to show case distinctions, or the definition fails to define case1 for contexts or words where case1 is usually distin- guished. The first instance is found for context (2.3.3.7), which admits only verbs. Let us assume that this instance is not a serious drawback. The French subjunctive can be regarded as a kind of case for verbs, or one can decide to relegate the removal of verbal categories from case1 until after the definition of part of speech1, when it will be trivial. The second instance is more serious: if a context admits nouns but is not classified as belonging to a case in a model for which contexts make up the domain of case', the model is counter-intuitive. Thus, what matters here is a satisfactory result of the model for nouns: we are not dealing here with the question of whether the label case is less appropriate for other parts of speech. 1 Revzin 1965a: 759. Cf. §2.0.8 for a general explanation of this concept. 2 Revzin 1967b (6.40): 142. 3 See §3.3.13 to §3.3.15 on criteria for identifying non-diagnostic contexts. 4 Revzin 1967b (6.40): 143. 5 Revzin 1967b (6.40): 139. 6 Revzin 1967b (6.40): 140. 7 For categories, see § 1.3.2.</page><page sequence="409">CHAPTER 2.3: CONTEXT-WORD FEATURE SYSTEMS 387 As for the domains of the definitions which have been presented so far, it is obvi- ous that substitutability equivalence, introduced in §2.3.3, determines a (strong) cate- gory over the set of contexts: all contexts are covered and each context belongs to one case. It does not yield a category for the set of words, or even for the set of nouns: WÍ2.3.5.3) is a subset of W(2.3.5.9). It is therefore quite natural to describe case1 as a category of contexts if it is defined in terms of substitutability equivalence. This approach can be maintained if case1 is defined as the set of progressive prod- ucts of initial kappa families, which is a system of tolerance classes over the set of contexts, making case a weak category. If, however, case is identified with the set of progressive products of quasi-initial kappa families, there is no longer an advantage to defining case1 in terms of contexts instead of words: set F+(2.3.5.7), which corre- sponds to the locative II), is a subset of F+(2.3.5.8), which corresponds to the locative). After the elimination of insufficiently capacious contexts and non-quasi-initial con- texts defining case1 over the set of case-forming diagnostic contexts even becomes counter-intuitive: one cannot say that (2.3.7.1) is caseless. On the other hand, as long as each noun is admitted by at least one case-forming diagnostic context, case can still be described as a class system for nouns. In fact, this is the general outcome of the later case models: case' is a system of classes over the set of words the only spe- cial property of which consists in the fact that it covers the complete set of words.1 We may now wonder what the linguistic meaning of such a definition is. 'Case is de- fined here as a set of types. The definition tells us which words belong to a case and to which cases a word can belong, but the definition does not indicate to which case a word belongs as a token, i.e. in a phrase. If all contexts would have been involved in the definition of case' in terms of words, then the extrapolation of the definition of type case over occurrences would to a large extent be trivial; but the present defini- tion provides clues for determination of the case of tokens only where they occur in case-forming diagnostic contexts. This means that the model as such does not provide an answer to the relevant K-question.2 What is needed is a procedure which extrapo- lates the results of the model over occurrences of words in non-diagnostic non-case- forming contexts. Revzin's proposal for this procedure is presented below. S 2.3.9 Revzin's 'token case': presentation The following procedure for the determination of the case of a word in a phrase, which is provided by Revzin, is in fact another model of 'case', which will be referred to as token case. Revzin defines 'token case' as follows. rA word w has case C in context fc: 1 if k is an element of the class of contexts which is case-forming for C; 2 [or] if k is less capacious than the class of contexts which is case-forming for C; 3 [or] if: a k is more capacious than the class of contexts which is case-forming for C, and b w is admitted by this classi 1 Cf.

Symbols have been adapted to the conventions adopted in the present study.</page><page sequence="410">388 PART 2- STRING MODELS The domain of Revzin's definition is obviously not words or contexts but words and contexts. It contains of pairs consisting of a context k and a word w admitted by k. The set PH of such pairs, which will be referred to as compatible pairs, is defined as follows: PH = {(It, w) | k e K A w e Wft) } (2.3.9.1) Thus, the context (já víiu, X) (2.3.9.2) 'I see' and the word ¿enú ('wife, accusative singular') make up compatible pair (2.3.9.3), ((já viïu, X), ¿enú) e pH (2.3.9.3) if the phrase (2/3/9/1), (2/3/9/1) Jávízuzenú. 'I see the wife' is an element of H. Then, other compatible pairs are: ((já, ¿enti, viïiù (2.3.9.4) ((X, vîiu zenA jai (2.3.9.5) Compatible pairs can be denoted as phrases in which the insertable word is under- lined. Thus, (2.3.9.3) can be written as (2/3/9/2) Já vízu zenü. In Revzin's definition, each compatible pair (fc, w) is characterized by one or more de- rived case values which make up a feature system for ?H. First, 'token case1 is defined for the set of compatible pairs determined by the set of diagnostic phrases. Since di- agnostic phrases cannot be derived from fli, as has been shown in §2.3.7, they are ac- commodated in the base component. Thus, the derivation of 'token case' employs a new base component fli&amp;: Äib = (W, //, //d, *) (2.3.9.6) Here Hd is the set of diagnostic phrases, and $ is a set of constraints imposed on the properties of the relation between H and Hd. Revzin's model presupposes several im- plied constraints. One of the constraints &lt;t&gt;i, where §' g &lt;í&gt;, stipulates that diagnostic phrases belong to the set of phrases: (t&gt;H//dc//| (2.3.9.7) Several concepts which have been defined in the preceding sections for //, must be redefined for Hd. The set Kd of diagnostic contexts is defined as follows. Kd = {(hi, h2) | (hi, h2) g K* A V hiwh2 e Hd} (2.3.9.8) u&gt;eW</page><page sequence="411">CHAPTER 2.3: CONTEXT-WORD FEATURE SYSTEMS 389 On the basis of Kdt some other constraints can be formulated. Constraint 4&gt;2 stipulates that diagnostic contexts cannot dominate non-diagnostic contexts: *2 = | A A ((fc £ KdAk'e Kd)*k' £ F~(k)) | (2.3.9.9) keK k'eK Constraint $3 stipulates that each non-diagnostic context dominates a diagnostic context. &lt;t&gt;3 = I A (k e K ' Kd =&gt; F+(k) n Kd *fl) | (2.3.9.10) keK Set KQic of case-forming contexts contains the contexts which are quasi-initial within the set of diagnostic contexts: Kl* = {k I k e K A A (W(fci) U . . . U W(fcn) = W(/c) =* F'k{) U . . . U F'kn) = F'k)) } (2.3.9. 1 1) {fclt...,fcn}cKd The families of the elements of KQic correspond to cases. Consider Fig. 2.3.7.1 for ex- emplification: if the contexts marked with a dagger are non-diagnostic contexts, then the starred contexts represent the case-forming families. These families are turned into features characterizing compatible pairs. This takes place in three steps: first, these features are defined so as to characterize the contexts of the compatible pairs; then the features are defined to characterize the words in the compatible pairs; and finally the characterizations are combined in order to characterize the complete compatible pairs. The concept of quasi-elementary contextual category, introduced in §2.3.6, is adapted for case-forming contexts. The quasi-elementary contextual categories gen- erated by the case-forming contexts must contain not only their progressive products but also their regressive products in order to account for non-diagnostic contexts. Thus, the quasi-elementary contextual case category EQc(k) which is generated by context k in ¿nic, is defined as follows. EV(k) = F+(k) U F~(k) (2.3.9.12) An example from Fig. 2.3.7.1: £7^(2.3.5.1) = M2.3.7.1) u M2.3.7.2) u M2.3.7.3) u FÌ2.3.7A) u M2.3.5.1) u M2.3.7.5) u M2.3.5.15) u FÍ2.3.5.12) u M2.3.5.14) u F(2.3.5.13) (2.3.9.13) The definitions and constraint $3 ensure that each context belongs to at least one quasi-elementary contextual case category. Thus, set TTfc(it;, k) of contextual cases which characterizes a compatible pair (w, k) is introduced here as an auxiliary con- cept which illustrates the steps of the definition. It is defined as follows. IIfc(ii&gt;, Ik) = { E I E c K A V (E = FVc'ì A k e E&lt;lc(k')) } (2.3.9. 14) k'eK&lt;lic</page><page sequence="412">390 PART 2 STRING MODELS Contextual case1 covers parts 1, 2 and 3a of Revzin's definition of 'token case1: it takes into account all the relevant information on the case of a compatible pair which is provided by the context in the pair. 'Contextual case alone does not cover Revzin's 'token case1. Consider what happens when non-initial contexts are dominated by two or more case-forming kappa families. Context (2.3.5.9) would be assigned indifferently to both the genitive and the accusative, no matter what word it contains in a concrete phrase. As a result, the word ¿end ('wife, accusative1) in the phrase (2/3/9/3) Já ne vízu zenü. 'I do not see the wife' would be in the genitive as well as the accusative; the same would apply to ¿eny Cwife, genitive') in the phrase (2/3/9/4) Já ne vízu zenv. 'I do not see the wife' Therefore, an auxiliary definition of word case is introduced, which takes into ac- count the relevant information provided by the word in the compatible pair. The word case ITMif, k) of a compatible pair (u&gt;, k) is defined as follows. IF(u&gt;f k)={E'ECKA V (E - Fikf) A w e WOrt) } (2.3.9. 15) k'eK&lt;lic 'Word case1 covers part 3 b of Revzin's definition of 'token case', i.e. it takes into ac- count all the relevant information on the case of a compatible pair which is provided by the word in the pair. According to this definition, (2/3/9/3) is not allotted to the genitive, since the contexts which are case-forming for the genitive do not admit ¿end 'Word case alone does not cover Revzin's definition of 'token case'. Consider what happens when words are admitted by two or more case-forming kappa families.

Thus, the compatible pair ((2.3.5.5), kófe) (2.3.9.16) i.e. (2/3/9/5) Já govorjú pro kófe. 'I speak about coffee' would be assigned to all cases. This result is generally rejected. The definition of 'contextual case1 would contra- dict such a result: (2.3.5.5) can only take the accusative. For that reason Revzin's def- inition of 'token case' purports to combine the results of 'word case' and 'contextual case'. The token case Jl(wt k) of a compatible pair (w, k) is defined as follows. IKu?, k) = TlHw, k) n Wiw, k) (2.3.9. 17) Thus, each compatible pair is characterized by a set of case features. The definition correctly accounts for both the contextual homonymy exemplified by (2.3.5.9) and the morphological homonymy exemplified by kófe:</page><page sequence="413">CHAPTER 2.3: CONTEXT-WORD FEATURE SYSTEMS 39 1 11(2/3/9/3) = { M2.3.5.2), M2.3.5.3), M2.3.5.5) } n { M2.3.5.5) } = { M2.3.5.5) } (2.3.9. 18) 1K2/3/9/5) = {M2.3.5.5)} n {M2.3.5.4), ft2.3.7.5), M2.3.5.6), M2.3.5.5), M2.3.5.2), M2.3.5.8), M2.3.5.3), M2.3.5.7) } = { M2.3.5.5) } (2.3.9. 19) The problems which the definition raises will be discussed in the following section. S 2.3.10 Revzln's 'token case': discussion Ideally, U{wy k) would contain only one element for each value of w and k: the case of a word in a phrase. This would make case1 a strong category for compatible pairs. This is not what happens, either mathematically or linguistically: nothing prevents contextual and morphological homonymy from occurring simultaneously in the same compatible pair. This is not necessarily dramatic: some varieties of what the Set-theo- retical School calls homonymy require multiple descriptions. It may mean, however, that the model is incomplete: another module may be required specifying the differ- ences between the descriptions. It is examined below whether those instances in which the model allows for multiple case assignment correspond to mutually compa- rable instances of intuitive homonymy. Four examples are considered. The first ambiguous compatible pair is provided by Zaliznjak.1 Consider the context: (ón ob"javí¡ êto reãénie, X) (2.3. 10. 1) 'he announced this decision' which admits the dative to express to whom the decision was announced, and the genitive to express whose decision was announced, i.e.: (2.3.10.1) g E&lt;?c(2.3.5.2) A (2.3.10.1) e E&lt;Jc(2.3.5.4) (2.3.10.2) because (2.3.5.2) e K&lt;iic A (2.3.5.4) € K&lt;lic A (2.3.5.2) - (2.3. 10. 1) A (2.3.5.4) -* (2.3. 10. 1) (2.3. 10.3) Now consider the word kollégii, which is the syncretized genitive, dative and locative singular (and nominative and accusative plural) of the word koUégija ('committee').2 Context (2.3.10.1) admits kollégiU and we find that n((2.3.10.1), kollégiò = ïïfc((2.3.10.1), koUégii) n TF((2.3.10.1), ¡collègio - {M2.3.5.2) u M2.3.5.4)} n {M2.3.5.2) u M2.3.5.4)} = {M2.3.5.2) u F(2.3.5.4)} (2.3.10.4) This is a satisfactory result because the phrase (2/3/10/1) Ón obwjavil éto reSénie koUégii. Tie announced this decision to_ the committee' or 'he announced this decision qf_ the committee' is intuitively considered ambiguous. Most syntactic and semantic models will immedi- ately distinguish two structures and meanings for (2/3/10/1). A similar result is obtained in the second instance: consider the compatible pair (2/3/10/2) Past Simpanzé. 1 Zaliznjak 1967b (2.5): 42, footnote 11, where the example is introduced to make a slightly different point see §5.35. ¿ kollégii e Fitem)-, cf. §2.2.9: (18).</page><page sequence="414">392 PART 2: STRING MODELS i.e. the compatible pair consisting of context (2.3.5.13) and the uninflected word Símpame ('chimpanzee'). Here, 11(2/3/10/2) = {M2.3.5.4), FÍ2.3.7.5), M2.3.5.5), M2.3.5.2), M2.3.5.3)} (2.3.10.5) The ambiguity which is yielded by the case model is still satisfactory, although the ambiguity here is of a different type from an intuitive viewpoint. Phrase (2/3/10/1) in- volves the question whether koUégii depends on ob"javil ('announced') or on reSénie ('decision'). In (2/3/10/2), it is clear that Simpanzé depends on dást. The ambiguity con- cerns the nature of the dependency. These differences will be worked out in Part 4 and Part 5. Now consider the compatible pair which consists of context (2.3.5.9) and otcá ('father'): (2/3/10/3) Já ne vfSu otcá. 'I do not see father' Context (2.3.5.9) admits both the accusative and the genitive. Otcá is the syncretized genitive and accusative singular of otéc ('father'). The model therefore yields: 11(2/3/ 10/3) = { F(2.3.5.5), M2.3.5.2), M2.3.5.3) } (2.3. 10.6) If homomymy is just a slot in the model, and does not possess independent reality claims, this result cannot be objected to. But if the model is presumed to reflect our intuitions on semantic relations, intuition hesitates to corroborate an approach which treats (2/3/10/3) as homonymous for genitive and accusative. Here, the two cases not only depend on the same word in the context: they also fill the same slot in the depen- dency relation. Also, genitive and accusative coincide for large classes of nouns. Pragmatically, the first two instances of ambiguity may provoke the hearer in certain situations to ask the speaker to make himself clear: but in the case of (2/3/10/3), such a question can hardly be formulated.1 The consequences of accepting homonymy here would have to be examined: if otcá is homonymous for genitive and accusative here, how can, say, child be stopped from being homonymous for boy and girl? A serious solution of this problem requires a semantic conception which is not provided in the present framework. The fourth instance of homonymy of compatible pairs as generated by the model is discussed separately in the following section. S 2.3.11 'Cleared case* The distinction between genitive and genitive II and the distinction between locative and locative II present a separate problem in Revzin's token case model.

This means that IH2/3/11/1) = {M2.3.5.7)} (2.3.11.2) which implies that n(2/3/l 1/1) = nfc(2/3/l 1/1) n ITM2/3/1 l/l) = {F(2.3.5.7)} (2.3.1 1.3) This result is in agreement with intuition. Now consider the compatible pair: (2/3/11/2) Já vi zu krasotú v górode. 'I see beauty in the town' i.e. ((2.3.5.7), górode). Token case 11(2/3/11/2) is established. Context (2.3.5.7) is case-forming for the lo- cative II and is contained in the progressive product of case-forming context (2.3.5.8) for the locative. This means that nk(2/3/ll/2) = {FÍ2.3.5.7), F(2.3.5.8)} (2.3.11.4) The word górode ('town, locative') is admitted by the case-forming contexts for loca- tive (such as (2.3.5.8)) and locative II (such as (2.3.5.7)). This means that IM2/3/11/2) = {F(2.3.5.7), FÍ2.3.5.8)} (2.3.11.5) which implies that 11(2/3/1 1/2) = nfc(2/3/l 1/2) n IH2/3/1 1/2) = {F(2.3.5.7), F(2.3.5.8)} (2.3.1 1.6) So the model treats (2/3/11/2) as a pair of homonymous compatible pairs. Parallel ex- amples exist for the genitive and the genitive II. At first sight, this treatment is comparable to the treatment of (2/3/10/3) and rather reasonable. Revzin remarks that, in such cases, U we are dealing with a classic case of non-uniqueness: two different non-contradictory descriptions of Russian are possible, in one description dvá bráta ['two brothers'] is genitive I and in the other genitive II.2 This is not the place to discuss the position of non-uniqueness in linguistic modelling3 or the difference between non-uniqueness of descriptions and homonymy.

The treatment is identical with the preced- ing instance: Context (2.3.5.7) is case-forming for the locative II and is contained in the progressive product of case-forming context (2.3.5.8) for the locative. This means that nfc(2/3/ 1 1/3) = { FÍ2.3.5.7), F(2.3.5.8) } (2.3. 1 1 .7) The word sáde ('garden, locative') is admitted by the case-forming contexts for loca- tive (such as (2.3.5.8)) and locative II (such as (2.3.5.7)). This means that IH2/3/ 1 1/3) = { FÍ2.3.5.7), FÍ2.3.5.8) } (2.3. 1 1 .8) which implies that TK2/3/11/3) = nfc(2/3/ll/3) n IH2/3/11/3) = {F(2.3.5.7), F(2.3.5.8)} (2.3.11.9) So the model treats (2/3/11/3) as a pair of homonymous compatible pairs. Parallel examples exist for the genitive and the genitive II. The treatment is less convincing now: if (2/3/11/3) is qualified as locative II as well as locative, what is the relation with the real locative II sadú in (2/3/1 1/D? Now consider the following compatible pair. (2/3/11/4) Ëtogo ne byváet pri sáde. 'that does not occur near the garden' i.e. ((2.3.5.8), sáde). Token case IT(2/3/ll/4) is established. The result is identical to that of the preced- ing instance: context (2.3.5.8) is case-forming for the locative and is contained in the regressive product of case-forming context (2.3.5.7) for the locative II. This means that II*(2/3/ 1 1/4) = { F(2.3.5.7), F(2.3.5.8) } (2.3. 11.10) The word sáde ('town, locative1) is admitted by the case-forming contexts for locative (such as (2.3.5.8)) and locative II (such as (2.3.5.7)). This means that IH2/3/1 1/4) = {FÍ2.3.5.7), FÍ2.3.5.8)} (2.3.1 1.1 1) which implies that 11(2/3/ 1 1/4) = nfc(2/3/l 1/4) n IPK2/3/11/4) - {F(2.3.5.7), FÍ2.3.5.8)} (2.3.1 1.12) So the model treats (2/3/11/4) as a pair of homonymous compatible pairs. Parallel examples exist for the genitive and the genitive II. It is obvious that the treatment of (2/3/11/4) is counter-intuitive. Intuitively, nei- ther the context nor the word have anything to do with the locative II. The homonymy yielded by the model does not in this instance reflect linguistic homonymy but is a 1 Cf. the discussion on examples (2/2/7/1) to (2/2/7/6).</page><page sequence="417">CHAPTER 2.3: CONTEXT-WORD FEATURE SYSTEMS 395 consequence of the structure of the model: since quasi-elementary contextual case categories contain both progressive and regressive products of case-forming con- texts, and since the case-forming contexts for genitive II and locative II are in the progressive products of the case-forming contexts for genitive and locative, the dis- tinction between the former and the latter disappears for contextual cases. Thus, definition (2.3.9.12) blurs the distinction between elementary contextual categories and quasi-elementary contextual categories. There is no simple solution to this problem. The exclusion of diagnostic phrases from the set which co-defines contextual case1 solves the problem for the genitive but not for the locative: the non-diagnostic context1 (já viïu krasotú v borsóni, X) (2.3. 11.13) provides the same problems as (2.3.5.7). There is a solution available, which is rather far-fetched. It runs along the follow- ing lines. 'Case has so far been conceived of as a system IT of synthetic features over set PH of compatible pairs, which have lost their special properties as a result of secondary derivations: case is not a category. But, being a feature system, IT yields a series of equivalence, tolerance and dominance systems comparable to those defined for word- context feature systems and context-word feature systems. For example, it yields a partition of PH into pi-families according to the set of pi-features that each compati- ble pair possesses: the pi-family F^ip) of a compatible pair p is defined as follows. F^(p) = {p | p' e /&gt;H a n(p) = n(p') } (2.3. 11.14) Examples of pi-families are Fn(2/3/l 1/1), which contains all compatible pairs with a word in a morphological locative II, and Fn(2/3/ll/2), which contains compatible pairs with all other locatives, such as (2/3/11/3) and (2/3/11/4). Thus, pi-equivalence separates locative and locative II, but does not provide an immediate model of "case, because it also yields separate classes for real homonymous pairs such as (2/3/10/1). But the relation D^of pi-dominance, 0" = {(Pi. P2&gt; Ipi e PH A p2 e pH A n(Pl) c n(p2)} (2.3.1 1.15) enables us to define the pi-analogue to Dobruáin's elementary grammatical cate- gories.2 If the symbol -IT-* indicates pi-dominance, then the pi-progressive product F+(p) and the pi-regressive product F~ip) of a compatible pair p are defined as fol- lows. F+(p) = {p' | p e PH A p -IT- p] (2.3.1 1.16) F~(p) = {p | p e pH A p&lt; -n- p } (2.3. 11.17) Set PHi of pi-initial compatible pairs is defined as follows. pHt = {p | p g pH a F-(p) c F+(p) } (2.3. 11.18) 1 Context (2.3.1 1.13) is identical to (2.2.7.24). c Cf. the corresponding definitions in §2.2.16 to §2.2.20.</page><page sequence="418">396 PART 2: STRING MODELS Set En of elementary cases is defined as follows. £H= {£|EC/&gt;HA V E = F+{p)} (2.3.11.19) p&lt;=PHi Elementary cases correspond to the six traditional cases of Russian. Homonymous compatible pairs, such as (2/3/10/1), are assigned to the cases dominating them. But the distinctions between locative and locative II and genitive and genitive II are now thrown out with the bathwater.

They generate set EnQ of quasi-elementary cases: £TTQ={£;|£:cpHA V E=F+(p)} (2.3.11.21) pePHqi Now each case can be defined as a quasi-elementary case. But this throws us back to the counter-intuitive situation for the genitive and the locative: since the locative II pi-dominates the locative, compatible pairs which are intuitively only locative belong also to the locative II. This time, since the direction of dominance is reversed as com- pared with preceding definitions of case', it is possible to introduce a further defini- tion which identifies quasi-quasi-elementary cases as quasi-elementary cases minus the quasi-elementary cases which are contained in them. The cleared progressive product Fc+(p) of a pi-quasi-initial compatible pair p, where p e PW, is defined as follows. Fc+(p) = {p 'pe pUAp'e F+(p) A A (p e Fip") ' F+(p") * p e F+(p")) } (2.3.11.22) Finally, the set EcTTQ which contains the cleared progressive products of pi-quasi- initial compatible pairs is defined as follows. EcTiQ ={£|Ec:pHA V £" = Fc+(p) } (2.3. 1 1 .23) pePHqi The elements of EcTTQ can be referred to as the cleared cases of a language. Set EcTTQ apparently assigns cases to any compatible pair in a way which is not blatantly counter-intuitive. E.g. the locative II is only assigned to compatible pairs with words which are morphologically marked for it, such as (2/3/11/1), and is not as- signed to any other word. The present writer is not aware of any counter-examples except possibly compatible pairs of the types which have been mentioned in the pre- ceding section. Since, however, the definition is complex and adapted ad hoc to fit</page><page sequence="419">CHAPTER 2.3: CONTEXT-WORD FEATURE SYSTEMS 397 rather specific instances, it is doubtful whether £cTTQ would survive confrontation with other languages. In the following parts of this study, varieties of the definition will be confronted with other linguistic material.1 2.3.12 Conclusion on context-word feature systems The results of set-theoretical modelling on context-word feature systems are unex- pectedly interesting: the models yield a definition of case1 which, for Russian, ends up within the margins of traditional case conceptions. It must however be realized that some important problems have been ignored in the models. It has, for instance, been assumed that the definition of parts of speech will not interfere with the model. Also, the models have been granted the distinction between diagnostic and non-diagnostic phrases, whereas the establishment of this distinction admittedly cannot take place within the framework set by fli, as we have seen in §2.3.7. The models treated in this chapter are therefore useful as an illustration of the methods employed in order to define case1 rather than as definitions. Several of the principles used in the models of this chapter will be used again in more sophisticated models. 1See§4.5.23ff.,§5.34ff.</page><page sequence="420">CHAPTER 2.4: CONCLUSION ON STRING MODELS The available models of morphosyntactic categories have been practically exhausted in the preceding chapters of Part 2. The mathematical possibilities are largely ex- hausted as well. There have been a few further mathematical developments of certain aspects of A¡, which have not been discussed because the present writer is not aware of any indicated or suspected contributions to our subject, viz. the answers to K- questions. Therefore, no attention was paid to Marcus' further analysis of non-ele- mentary grammatical categories and Mayoh's study of them as independent mathe- matical structures;1 studies on dominance by Nebesky and Franc lová involving two or more sets of phrases (e.g. a set of grammatical phrases and a set of meaningful phrases) have also been left out of consideration.2 The present writer may be mis- taken in not working out, linguistically, Nebesky's partitions of the set of words into secondary (tertiary, etc.) families, which result from definitions which play "pingpong" between the set of contexts and the set of words, i.e. deal with the sets of words ad- mitted by the contexts which admit a given word, etc. Such games are played by Mar- cus and Sestier.3 We have seen that, generally speaking, the linguistic models based on ft' hardly contribute to answering relevant K-questions such as (2/4/1) What is a word? (2/4/2) What is a grammatical category? (2/4/3) What do we mean when we say that two words are in the same case? Wherever a model is developed which approaches the answer to a K-question, as with cleared case1 in §2.3.11, the answer turns out to be based on concepts which raise new K-questions. Thus, the ft' models of the Set-theoretical School simply confirm the low expectations which have often been expressed regarding strictly distributional models.4 This does not mean that Hi models have no value. Among the virtues they possess is the fact that, by taking K-questions seriously, they opened a neglected area of re- search in theoretical linguistics for exploration. Also, they set a standard for rigorous formulation of linguistic statements and they developed methods and technical con- cepts which will be used in more sophisticated models as well. As for the present study, ñ' models have provided exemplification of the meta-model which was intro- duced in Part 1 and relatively simple illustrations of the mathematical principles used in the more sophisticated models. Putnam attributes to distributional models the virtue of being "good detectives".5 Once the reality claims of the base component are reduced to a simple statement of the kind 1 Marcus 1967c (5.12ff.): 156ff.; Mayoh 1966. 2 Nebesky 1965; Franclova 1969. 3 Nebesky 1967; Marcus 1967c (1.43): 41; Sestier 1961. 4 E.g. in Chomsky 1959: 206. 5 Putnam 1961 0*34. 398</page><page sequence="421">CHAPTER 2.4: CONCLUSION ON STRING MODELS 399 (2/4/4) Let us assume that this is the mathematical structure of our data. we can be amazed at what can be derived from ft' and must not be disappointed about missing phenomena which have never been in our data. (Distributional models are bad detectives in another sense: they lure us to jump to conclusions about language in- stead of about data.) When evaluating the models based on fli, the Set-theoretical School blames their shortcomings on the fact that the base component is too "poor":1 the mathematical structures which can be derived from 9i' are too simple to account for the complex phenomena of language. The structure of the base component must be "enriched".2 In the terminology of the present study, developed in Part 1, this means that the derivations which are determined by the base component have insufficient empirical interest to provide meaningful answers to implicit or explicit K-questions. The cause is, in our view, not some indefinite poverty of the base component: rather the linguis- tic theory which is implied by the base component is poor. As stated in §2.0.1, the semiotic conception implied by base component Hi rests on two viewpoints:3 1 language is, like other sign systems, a system of types and tokens; 2 tokens occur in strings. It is this semiotic conception, i.e. our view on the function of language, which must be enriched. This means that we cannot enrich the base component with arbitrary sets, relations and constraints. If new elements in the base component are to increase the intrinsic empirical interest of their derivations, they must be defining properties of language. This is not the place to propose a set of defining properties for language, but it is clear that no sign system is distinctively defined as a linear system of types and tokens: essential properties missing in fli are those implied by the view that signs are double-sided entities, connecting form and meaning. In fact, such properties are gradually introduced in the models that will be discussed in the following parts of this study. 1 Revzin 1977 (1.2.3.1): 26. 2 Marcus 1967a (1.2.): 2ff. á Of course, other presuppositions are factually implied as well, such as the viewpoint that types can be interpreted as words. But these are not present in the conception of language as such: it is assumed that words can be defined in another part of the full model; some attempts to do so were described in Chapter 2.1.</page><page sequence="422">PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS CHAPTER 3.0: INTRODUCTION §3.0.1 The concept of paradigm In Part 2, the concept of paradigm was invoked once or twice in order to enhance the results of models which are fundamentally based on base component ñ'. For example, paradigms were introduced in §2.2.25 for the elimination of overlap between different parts of speech defined on the basis of ñ'. But it is not unlikely that paradigms can be employed more directly for the definition of part of speech. If it is necessary to intro- duce paradigms anyway, it seems interesting to explore their use in a less marginal fashion than for adjustments of definitions based on other concepts. The introduction of paradigms, and the assumption that the paradigm of each occurrence of a word in a string is known, imply that the word track of an utterance is now accompanied by a paradigm track in which the paradigms of the occurrences in the word track are rep- resented. Although an occurrence in one track always corresponds to an occurrence in the other track, the second track is not trivial: the identity of an occurrence in the word track cannot simply be predicted by the corresponding occurrence in the paradigm track. Thus, the addition of paradigms implies the introduction of structures of a new type, which can be called twin strings. In Part 3, the results of the "enrichment" of the base component with a set of paradigms will be examined. In Chapter 3.1, some models will be discussed which em- ploy paradigms more directly for a definition of "part of speech than did the one that was introduced in Part 2. In the models of Part 2, no method was indicated for distinguishing between gram- matical categories inherent to a lexical item, such as 'gender1, and grammatical cate- gories which characterize only certain forms of a lexical item, such as case1. This is not possible in fli models, where each word is treated as an independent element without any paradigmatic connections. Thus, we have seen that, within the framework of Hi, there is no essential difference between the way in which family F(zenú) ('wife, accusative') corresponds to Revzin's feature FEM and the way in which it corresponds to ACC.1 Even if Z-contexts2 are accepted as a means to distinguish two kinds of cate- gory (such contexts singling out different genders and numbers), the problem of asso- ciating families of different cases with one gender remains. In the simple string models discussed in Part 2 the relation between Y(otéc) and Fiotcóm) cannot be differentiated from the relation between Fiotéc) and ¥(¿ená). The introduction of the concept of paradigm enables the linguist to make clear that these relations are different. This is worked out in the models of gender1 which are to be discussed in Chapter 3.2. Finally, the introduction of paradigms streamlines case modelling. This will be shown in Chapter 3.3. The present chapter discusses the views of the Set-theoretical School on the con- cept of paradigm itself. Some parallels are drawn with contemporary linguistic efforts 1 Cf. §2.2.12. 2 Cf. §2.2.6. 400</page><page sequence="423">CHAPTER 3.0; INTRODUCTION 40 1 in the west; a model is discussed in which paradigm1 is derived from more primitive notions, and some implicit or explicit constraints on paradigms are treated. § 3.0.2 The interpretation of paradigm1 The Set-theoretical School employs the term paradigm for two different but related concepts. 1 Paradigm indicates an unordered set of words which have an identical lexical meaning. A paradigm in this sense is, for example: [otea, otcóm, otcú} ...} (3.0.2.1) 'father, genitive or accusative'; 'father, instrumental'; 'father, dative' This concept was introduced by Kulagina as neighbourhood (okrestnost').1 The term paradigm was adopted by Marcus and is found in Revzin's later work; some mathematicians, such as Popescu and Gladkij, have continued to employ neighbour- hood.2 2 Paradigm indicates an ordered set of words having identical lexical meaning. The parameters determining the places in the ordered sets are certain grammatical categories (case1, number', 'tense') represented in the word that occupies the place. Thus, the paradigm of otéc ('father') runs: (ofe'e, otcá, oteú, ...) (3.0.2.2) under the convention that the first place indicates the nominative, the second place the genitive, etc. This more traditional conception of 'paradigm1 is found in work by Zaliznjak and Gladkij.3 In the present study, the term paradigm indicates either concept. Wherever it is nec- essary to make an explicit distinction, the concepts will be referred to as ordered paradigms and unordered paradigms. Part 3 mostly deals with unordered paradigms. § 3.0.3 The position of paradigms in the full model If we wish to compare the approach of the Set-theoretical School to contemporary Western linguistics, Hockett's frame of reference may be useful. He distinguishes three models of grammatical description: 1 word and paradigm; 2 item and arrangement-, 3 item and process.4 The item-and-process approach has merged with generative grammar and does not enter this story. 'Word-and-paradigm' describes grammatical categories in terms of relations among words. A distinction can be made between syntactic relations, which hold between word tokens, and paradigmatic relations, which hold between word 1 Kulagina 1958: 203. Okrestnost* is translated as environment in Revzin 1966b (3.24): 67, and as vicinity in Kulagina I960: 228. Note that okrestnost', translated as neighbourhood, is used for an entirely different concept in a different branch of Soviet mathematical linguistics, represented by BorSõev, Xomjakov and Sreider, among others; cf. Borlõev &amp; Xomiakov 1973. 2 Popescu 1972 {voisinage}, Gladkii 1983. 3 Zaliznjak 1969 (8-11): 52-56, 1967b (1.8-1.11): 30-34; Gladkij 1983. 4Hockett 1954/19664 (1.1): 386.</page><page sequence="424">402 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS types. Words are dealt with wholesale, as intersections of lexical and grammatical categories. No attempt is made to assign lexical and grammatical values to specific parts of words. Thus, zenú is viewed as the accusative of a word meaning 'wife', and is not split into a part meaning 'wife' and another part meaning 'accusative'. The item-and-arrangement approach deals mainly with the relations among token units, both smaller and larger than words. Relations among types are of lesser impor- tance and are often derived directly from syntagmatic behaviour. Thus, the English allomorphs /-z/, l-xzl and /-s/ are grouped as a single plural morpheme on the basis of their complementary distribution. The composition of paradigms according to the word-and-paradigm approach is not ususally stated to be based on distribution, al- though Marcus' and Revzin's constraints on paradigms (which are discussed in § 3.0.7 to §3.0.11) are partly based on the distributional properties of words. Robins points out that 'item-and-arrangement1 and 'word-and-paradigm1 are not mutually exclusive approaches.1 It is possible, for example, to account for relations inside the word by means of 'item-and-arrangement' (and state that zenú is made up of the morpheme zen- meaning 'wife' and a morpheme -ú meaning 'accusative'), and for the relations among words by means of 'word-and-paradigm' (e.g. for ¿enú by stating the syntactic functions of the accusative and the other elements of the paradigm meaning 'wife'). In such a way, the two approaches cover complementary areas. A convention would have to be adopted according to which 'word-and-paradigm1 ac- counts for instances where 'item-and-arrangement' falls short, as is done with supple- tion. This viewpoint was generally adopted by the Set-theoretical School. On the one hand, 'paradigm' has been added to the base component of the morphosyntactic models of hte present chapter, which can be regarded as word-and-paradigm models. On the other hand, models are constructed for morphemic analysis according to the princi- ples of 'item-and-arrangement'. The interesting point is, of course, the relative posi- tion of all these models in the implicit full model: if paradigms are used for the defini- tion of "morpheme1 and morphemes for the definition of 'paradigm', the model is circular. In the models, three possible statuses are reserved for 'paradigm' in a hypothetical full model. 1 Paradigm" is derived through an intermediate definition of 'morpheme'. 2 Paradigm' is derived directly from R[. 3 Paradigm' is a, provisional or absolute, primitive, which does or does not serve as a basis for morphemic segmentation. A survey of available models of 'morpheme is given in §3.0.4. It will be argued why they need not be worked out in this study. Marcus' model of 'paradigm' will be dis- cussed in §3.0.5 to §3.0.7. In all other models, 'paradigm' is part of the base component. These models do, however, impose certain implicit or explicit constraints on paradigms. Some of these constraints will be discussed in §3.0.8 to §3.0.13, before the presentation of the actual models. 1 E.g. Robins 1960(3): 118ff.</page><page sequence="425">CHAPTER 3.0: INTRODUCTION 403 S 3.0.4 Models of morpheme': a survey This section mentions some models of morphological analysis which are chronologi- cally or materially related to the gap between ñ' (the base component of Part 2) and 5Ï2 (the base component of Part 3). No mention is made here of morphemic models which are connected with later models containing more sophisticated semantic primi- tives. The interest of the models for the present study is determined by their ambition to provide a logical basis for the derivation of paradigms from more primitive units, i.e. the extent of their success in deriving the base component of Part 3 from the base component of Part 2. The base component of Mel'ouk's 1961 model of morphological analysis contains morph types besides W.1 The model segments words into token morphs using a list of these types. Since the base component of the model is richer than the models dis- cussed in the present part and the model therefore does not contribute to morphosyn- tactic modelling, it is left out of consideration. Revzin's 1961 model2 is based on phonemes, strings and words, and derives mor- phemes and the distinction between stems and affixes; but it does not immediately dis- tinguish flexional and derivational endings, which should provide the key to the defi- nition of paradigms. Besides, Revzin uses a list of given morphs of which morphemes represent a subset: morphemes are determined as a subset of this set of morphs. Abraham &amp; Kiefer consider this the most serious shortcoming of Revzin's definition and provide the following consideration. The procedure would be linguistically satisfactory only if the "morphs" could be obtained by an efficient procedure from the set of all possible sequences of sounds or letters. Unless this has been done, one may argue that it would be a theoretically equivalent and practically more useful procedure to compile the list of morphemes directly.3 In Revzin's 1962a model of morpheme segmentation, paradigms are a part of the base component, which reduces their interest for the present study.4 The base component of Fitialov's 1961 model, which was worked out by Marcus in 1967, contains case and gender categories, as well as paradigms.5 In 1965, Abraham &amp; Kiefer provide an algorithmic definition of the morpheme.6 Besides an alphabet and a harp over it, the base component includes words as types and tokens and a set of word stems. This leaves little difference with Revzin's 1961 model. Abraham &amp; Kiefer propose tapping the set of word stems from a derivation in a generative model,7 but, since all categories are considered given in a generative model,8 one may argue that it would be a theoretically equivalent and practically more useful procedure to install a list of morphemes directly in the generative part of their model. 1 Mel'cuk 1961 (2): 209. 2 Revzin 1961b. 3 Abraham &amp; Kiefer 1965: 5. 4 Revzin 1962a (4.31): 101-105; 1966b (4.31): 101-104. 5 Fitialov 1961; Marcus 1967c (4): 104-142. 6 Abraham &amp; Kiefer 1965. 7 Abraham &amp; Kiefer 1965: 7. 8 Cf. §1.3.1.</page><page sequence="426">404 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS This leaves only Marcus' model to be discussed. It derives 'paradigm' directly, with- out the mediation of morphemes. It is presented in the following section. S 3.0.5 Marcus1 model of 'paradigm': base component The base component fljc of Marcus' model of 'paradigm' is a variant of fli:1 5llc = (F,//, W,P',&lt;I&gt;) (3.0.5.1) The interpretation of the symbols is as follows. Symbol F is an alphabet of elements which explicitly allows for different interpre- tations.2 It is possible to interpret them as phonemes; in that case, F coincides with set F of îi'a in §2.1.3. In Marcus' exemplification, the elements of F are interpreted as letters, which qualifies the model as substitutional.3 Since the model will have enough trouble keeping afloat as it is, the same interpretation is adopted in its present treat- ment. This means that Russian words in the examples are not accentuated and the additional problems caused by the non-linear behaviour of stress phenomena will be ignored. Set H is a harp over F; for details see § 2.0.2. Harp H can be interpreted as the set of grammatically correct strings of phonemes. Set W is a segmentation of //, which can be interpreted as the word segmentation. If the word segmentation models which were discussed in Chapter 2.1 are rejected, W must be considered a real or provisional primitive. The set W of word types can be derived from W.4 Set P' is a partition of W.5 The interpretation and status of P' is unclear: Marcus does not explicitly indicate any reality claims. Marcus' examples suggest that the ele- ments of P' are unordered paradigms: his set { za vod, za voda, za vodu, za vodom, za vode } (3.0.5.2) contains different forms of the noun zavod ('factory'). But P' cannot be the set of paradigms; a model of 'paradigm' which contains paradigms in its base component is rather pointless. For the time being, the elements of P' will be referred to as proto- paradigms. Their status will feature in the discussion of the model. Finally, &lt;i&gt; is a set of constraints the specification of which is not essential here. S 3.0.6 Marcus1 model of 'paradigm': development component Marcus defines 'paradigm' after defining a considerable number of intermediate con- cepts. The present presentation skips those intermediate concepts and auxiliary def- initions which are not immediately used in the logical path toward 'paradigm'.

The preceding models provided definitions of concepts as sets of objects which can be derived from the base component for any values of the symbols in the base component within the indicated constraints. Thus, the definition of 'family1 in §2.2.5 provides fami- lies whatever the values of W and H' this does not of course exclude the definition 1 Marcus 1967c (3.6): 81. 2 Marcus 1967c (3.9): 83. 0 Marcus 1967c (3.11): 84.</page><page sequence="429">CHAPTER 3.0: INTRODUCTION 407 from yielding trivial results for certain values: the set of families may, for instance, coincide with the improper partition or the unit partition of W. Marcus* definition of a "language with a regular morphology", on the other hand, does not define concepts for any values of the base component: it classifies the very values of the base component. If the (intensional) base component is a definition of the set of possible languages, Marcus' definition singles out a set of possible languages with values for F, W, and P' such that all subsets in P' are regular. Being a typological definition, it defines two sets of possible languages: languages with and without a regular morphology.1 As an example of a typological definition, this particular instance may be confusing because the reality claims of the concepts of regular set and regular morphology are not quite clear: as we have seen in (3.0.6.20), a subset of forms of stol, which is a po- tential proto-paradigm (to say the least), qualifies as irregular; on the other hand, the set of Dutch words { eett at, gegeten } (3.0.6.22) 'eat'; 'ate'; 'eaten' qualifies as regular because ßi(eet, at) = ßKai, gegeten) = X (3.0.6.23) In fact, a partition P' of W into subsets Pt each of which contains words beginning with different letters will provide a language with a regular morphology. The last auxiliary concept of Marcus' model of 'paradigm1 is complementary distri- bution. Two words w' and W2 are in complementary distribution if they are not T- substitutable,2 i.e. if there is no context which admits both W[ and w?. K{wi)nKÍW2)=8 (3.0.6.24) In Russian, the words lése ('wood, locative') and lésa Cwood, genitive') provide an example of complementary distribution because lése is only admitted after certain prepositions which do not admit lésa. Marcus' definition of paradigm' is restricted to languages with a regular morphol- ogy: for these languages, the set P of paradigms contains the proto-paradigms Pi the elements of which are in complementary distribution,3 i.e. P={p|PgP'aA A Kiwi) n Kkw2) = 0} (3.0.6.25) W' G P U£G P Marcus adds that a language such that all subsets in P' are paradigms, i.e. such that P' = P (3.0.6.26) is a language with a paradigmatic morphology. This is, again, a typological definition. Since the models of 'case' and 'gender in Part 3 are based on P as a partition of W, this statement suggests that case' and 'gender' occur only in languages with paradigmatic morphologies. 1 For the position of typological definitions in the meta-model. cf. § 1.3.3. 2 Marcus 1967c (3.12k 84.

The delimitation of the concept involves constraints of at least three different types: 1 An ordinary constraint on the set of possible languages: P' is given as a partition, i.e. proto-paradigms do not overlap. Since any paradigms are also proto-paradigms, this constraint applies to paradigms as well. This constraint exists for all models in Part 3 and will be discussed in §3.0.12ff. as Kulagina's constraint 2 A typological constraint on the distribution of a label. Paradigms are said to occur only in languages with a regular morphology. Note the difference with a situation in which a concept is trivial for certain languages. 3 A non-typological constraint on the distribution of a label. Paradigms make up a subset of the given set of proto-paradigms in a morphologically regular language. Previous definitions provided either a set of elements of a new constituency (e.g. contexts derived from phrases) or class systems over a given domain. The second and the third constraints involve the status of P'. Since concrete reality claims for it are lacking, it must be assumed that the base component is intensional, at least with respect to P': The base component determines the set of possible lan- guages. This implies that, for a given interpretation of W and F, any partition is an ac- ceptable set of proto-paradigms.1 Since many potential sets of proto-paradigms are not feasible paradigms, Marcus' second constraint sorts out the languages with a P' which contains feasible paradigms. His third constraint sorts out the feasible paradigms in such a P'. The model can be falsified in a great many ways, but it suffices to show that the two major criteria, regularity and complementary distribution, are counter-intuitive as either of them excludes intuitive paradigms and includes intuitive non-paradigms. As to the regularity condition, consider example (3.0.6.20). The fact that certain endings of the same word begin with the same letter implies, according to Marcus' model, that: 1 either Russian is not a regular language and so does not have paradigms; 2 or the different forms of the traditional and intuitive paradigm of stol belong to different paradigms. Neither situation is intuitively satisfactory. At the same time, the model allows for paradigms in possible languages with non- sense proto-paradigms containing words which all begin with different letters, such as: { dom, gorod, stul } (3.0.7. 1 ) 'house1; 'town'; 'chair' The complementary distribution criterion, on the other hand, excludes practically all feasible proto-paradigms from the set of paradigms. On the level of morphosyntax, instances of complementary distribution are rare, if only because most noun forms occur in the empty context (X, X). The lése versus lésa example which was adduced 1 For a meaningful use of proto-paradigms, see the discussion of Revzin's well-givenness constraint in §3.0.11.</page><page sequence="431">CHAPTER 3.0: INTRODUCTION 409 toward the end of §3.0.6 is the only valid instance of complementary distribution in the Russian noun system of which the present writer is aware. At the same time, the complementary distribution criterion allows for paradigms which contain words belonging to different parts of speech, some of which do tend to occur in complementary distribution. Marcus points out that paradigmatic morphology is an ideal situation.1 He does not clarify what he means by ideal. There are at least two possible interpretations: 1 a situation which is approached by the morphologies of actual languages; 2 or a situation which is prescribed for the morphology of an ideal language. The examples given above show that actual languages far from approximate paradig- matic morphology, and that the deviations are more substantial than the dust on Wilks' billiard balls.2 This rules out interpretation 1. As for interpretation 2, it may be questioned whether it is a linguistically relevant activity to develop ideal languages with properties diverging from those of actual lan- guages;3 but even even if we beg this question, we may wonder whether paradigmatic morphology is a desirable property for an ideal language. As a sign system, an ideal language would be expected to consist of signs with an arbitrary relation between signifiant and signifié, and which are constructed from a limited stock of building blocks. This implies that the smallest elements of form which are associated with meanings cannot be expected to avoid sharing arbitrary parts in arbitrary places, as long as they are distinct as wholes. More concretely: in view of the limited number of available phonemes or characters in an ideal language, ordinary morphemes may or may not begin with the same phoneme or letter; there is no reason why flexional end- ings would differ from them in this respect. Furthermore, the existence of complemen- tary distribution of morphemes in a language, which is one of Marcus' requirements for a paradigmatic morphology, implies that his ideal language refrains from using the complete set of possible differences between morphemes for conveying information: there is, a priori, no reason why an ideal language should use flexional endings to convey information to a lesser degree than other morphemes. In fact, the Estonian cases (comitative and abessive) or the Russian tenses, which Revzin considers to be used in identical contexts and to convey different information,4 suggest that the ar- gument for assigning ideal status to a situation in which elements of a paradigm occur in identical distribution deserves as much support as that for complementary distribu- tion. 1 Marcus 1967c (3.12): 84. 2 Cf. § 1.0.8. 3 Every now and then, linguists or logicians develop ideal logical languages the study of which purports to enhance our knowledge of natural language. Examples are Lincbax 1916, Carnap 1937 and, essentially, Montague grammar. The underlying assumption, i.e. that artificial languages are natural languages in vitro, is rejected by Chomsky, who [1955: 43] points out that, while physicists rightly claim that the behaviour of a ball on an inclined plane resembles that of an avalanch, and psychologists might claim that the behav- iour of a rat in a laboratory resembles that of a rat, or even another animate being, in the outside world, no such claim can be substantiated for logical languages. "The ball rolls [...] exactly as it does; the rats behave exactly as they do-, but an artificial language has whatever properties its maker determines it to have." 4 Cf. §2.2.15; the issue will be pursued in §3.0.9 and §3.3.16.</page><page sequence="432">4 1 0 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS Thus, Marcus' criteria for paradigms seem largely irrelevant to the concept of paradigm. Marcus later introduces quasi-paradigmatic morphology, which allows for elements of a proto-paradigm to be in contrasting, i.e. overlapping but not coinciding, distribution.1 A set P" is defined: P"={P|PeP'A A A KiwiiuKíwà^Kíwò} (3.0.7.2) w' e P XV2 e P Marcus does not indicate any reality claims for this concept, but it is clear that P" would be a little more feasible as the set of paradigms than would P. The definition allows for two words to belong to the same paradigms if they belong to different fami- lies which do not dominate each other.2 This criterion is related to one of Revzin's constraints, which will be discussed in the following sections. Marcus' new definition does not put an end to the other side-effects of his criteria; some of them are even exacerbated. Marcus' model of paradigm' is followed by definitions of flexion classes. Since they do not directly affect the subject of the present study, they will not be discussed here.3 § 3.0.8 Revzin's constraints on paradigms: introduction In view of the apparent impossibility to derive the concept of paradigm from more primitive notions, the models of Part 3 consider set P of unordered paradigms given in the base component. The sets Pi in P are interpreted as containing the flexional forms of a word. There is of course also a historical reason for considering paradigms given. One of the main concerns in the early days of the Set-theoretical School was machine trans- lation. Since machine translation was viewed as a simulation of manual translation, a dictionary containing the lexical items which generate paradigms was considered a basic component of any translation system. Also, memory and speed limitations were severe in those days, and dictionary entries seemed to represent an optimally storable set of items from an economical point of view: storing a smaller number of morphemes would complicate the processing rules to an incalculable extent, whereas storing word forms would cost about ten times as much memory space and a lot of speed, which were expected to be gained by the introduction of relatively simple rules relating word forms to dictionary entries. Revzin points out that the reality claims of P are somewhat ambiguous. The most obvious shared property of the members of a paradigm is the presence of a common stem morpheme (except for a few instances of suppletion, such as idú ('go') : Sei ('went')). But this does not always enable drawing the line between flexion and word 1 Marcus 1967c (3.23): 91. 2 Dominance between families: §2.2.16. 3 Marcus 1967c (3.13-16): 85-87.

Long before the Set-theoretical School, Russian grammarians had been concerned with finding criteria to answer such questions as the following. 1 Do diminutives make up separate paradigms? Do dorn Chouse') and dómik ('little house'), belong to the same paradigm? 2 Do the long and short forms of the adjectives, such as nóvyj ('new') and nóv Cis new'), belong to the same paradigm? 3 Do different degrees of comparison of the adjectives (molodój, 'young'; molöle, 'younger') belong to the same paradigm? 4 Do the singular and plural forms of nouns belong to the same paradigm? 5 Do the aspects of the verbs {re$at' 'solve, imperfective'; re$ft' 'solve, perfective') belong to the same paradigm? Revzin proposes to solve these problems by imposing some labelling constraints.1 As in Marcus' model of paradigm1, the constraints have a hybrid status: since paradigms are given, the constraints do not define paradigm. Yet the model purports to make clear that some given paradigms are better than others: the criteria are formulated in terms of the model itself. Revzin provides the criteria in his typological definition of a language with well-given paradigms, which is based on a number of auxiliary typological definitions, given in §3.0.9 and §3.0.10. § 3.0.9 Revzin's constraints on paradigms: R-simplicity Revzin's definitions are based on Kulagina's base component %2 fl2 = (W,//, P) (3.0.9.1) where W is the set of words, P is the partition of W into paradigms, and H is a harp over W. The set of families is derived from W and //as in §2.2.5. A large number of typological definitions have been derived from %¿. The most ex- haustive surveys of these definitions are found in Revzin 1965b and Marcus 1967a.3 Only the definitions pertaining to Revzin's labelling constraints will be discussed here. A language is simple in the sense of Revzin, or R-simple, if no family contains more than one word from a paradigm,4 i.e. if A P(w)nF(w)= {w} (3.0.9.2) uigW where ?(w) is the paradigm containing word w, and F(w) is the family containing w. Note that R-simplicity is almost identical to Marcus' quasi-paradigmatic morphol- ogy: in languages with a quasi-paradigmatic morphology, two words iüi and wi are in the same paradigm if: 1 Revzin 1967b (5.35): 127-129. 2 Kulagina I960: 228, 1958: 203.

R-simplicity corresponds to the first condition of simplicity in the sense of Kulagina; cf.

WR = {w | w g W A P(u&gt;) n Fiwi = {w } } (3.0.9.3) It is obvious that all words are R-simple in an R-simple language. Revzin points out that Russian is not an R-simple language if it contains the words proféssory and professora, which are doublet forms for the nominative plural of professor ('professor'): proféssory and professora belong to the same family.2 A slightly different instance is presented by rukój and rukóju, where the endings -oj and -oju are alternative forms for the feminine instrumental singular (here of ruká, 'hand').3 Revzin terms both examples instances of eliminable non-simplicity.4 He indicates a procedure, which in itself is not of interest here, to unite such doublets on the basis of their status as "grammatical variants". Two words are grammatical variants of each other if they are in "free variation".5 Two words wi and w2 are in free variation if: 1 i^i and w2 have the same distribution (i.e. belong to the same family), and- 2 there is no phrase in which their mutual substitution alters the meaning of the phrase.6 This definition makes sense but involves the concept 'meaning of a phrase1, which is not accounted for in the model. But let us assume that R2 has been extended with the equivalence relation R of "having the same meaning', as has been done by Revzin in other models.7 Then, we can proceed with a set of languages in which matching grammatical variants count as one word, or in Revzin's terms, with normalized lan- guages.8 1 Revzin 1967b (5.32): 117. 2 Revzin 1966b (4.28): 83: Revzin 1967b (5.32): 117. 3 The difference consists in the fact that the doublet proféssory : professora is lexically determined: one can only list the words for which -y and -á concur. The doublet rukój: rukófi, on the other hand, is morpho- logically determined- -oj and -oju concur in all singular instrumental forms of feminine nouns the nomi- native form of which ends in -a or -ja. The latter type is not mentioned by the Set-theoretical School. 4 Revzin 1966b (4.28): 83. 5 Revzin 1967b (5.32): 118. 6 Revzin 1967b (2.13): 56; modification in Revzin 1967b (5.32): 1 17. 7 An example is Revzin's formalization of Jassem's word model, discussed in §2.1.12ff. Revzin in fact de- fines free variation for words by substituting word for sound in his definition of phonological free varia- tion. Note, however, that the interpretation of the relation is radically different. In segmentation models, identity of meaning between strings must rule out phonetic variants: assigning the same meaning to rukój and rukófo there would create havoc. This example exposes the weakness of the ad hoc approach to seman- tics which characterizes a great deal of the work of the Set-theoretical School. 0 Revzin 1967b (5.32): 118.</page><page sequence="435">CHAPTER 3.0: INTRODUCTION 4 1 3 There are also instances of non-eliminable non-simplicity, in which families contain two or more words from one paradigm which cannot be interchanged without affect- ing the meaning of a phrase. There are no obvious examples in the set of Russian nouns, but Revzin points out that the situation is quite common in the Finno-Ugric lan- guages.1 In Estonian, the forms of the comitative belong to the same family as the forms of the abessive: one can say (3/0/9/ 1 ) Suure rõõmuga tulen sinna. 'I shall come here with great joy*, literally 'great with- joy I-shall-come to-here' as well as (3/0/9/2) Suure rõõmuta tulen sinna. 'I shall come here without great joy', literally 'great without- joy I-shall-come to-here' Roomuga and rõõmuta are not grammatical variants: their mutual substitution changes the meaning of the phrase. Zaliznjak2 points out that roomuga and rõõmuta will prob- ably not be found in the same family, as "secondary" uses of such locative cases (e.g. as complements of specific verbs) will nearly always distinguish the families of the comitative and the abessive. Zaliznjak is right,3 but Revzin's observation is essentially correct within the chosen framework. The question is whether there can or cannot be a language such that two words belong to the same paradigm and to the same family and still distinguish different meanings. The Estonian example shows that instances which approach this situation can be found. This seems sufficient to rule out a con- straint forbidding such languages. A model with a base component which determines the set of possible languages must therefore take account of languages with non- eliminable non-simplicity. Yet, Revzin employs R-simplicity as a criterion for deciding some of the problems raised in §3.0.8. If the aspectual system of Russian is treated as operating within paradigms, it approaches non-eliminable non-simplicity. The forms reSáli ('solved, im- perfective plural') and reàíli ('solved, perfective plural') tend to occur in the same contexts. If renali and resili belong to the same paradigm, the language to which they belong is not R-simple. Since R-simplicity is desirable, as will be shown below, the ar- gument of greater R-simplicity impels Revzin to decide that the aspects of the Russian verbs make up different paradigms.4 Similarly, dorn Chouse') and dómik ('little house') cannot be in the same paradigms, since their forms belong to the same families. But Revzin points out that R-simplicity does not take care of such instances as delovék Chuman being') and õelovédestvo ('mankind'): since these words belong to different genders, their distributions of do not coincide.5 Revzin therefore formulates the condition of homogeneity, which is treated in the following section. 1 Revzin 1966b (4.28): 83; Revzin's examples were used as (2/2/15/1) and (2/2/15/2) for a related issue in §2.2.15. 2 Zaliznjak 1967a: 2. 3 Cf.

Apparently, Revzin's formal and semantic criteria are not sufficient to separate the paradigms of õelovék and äeloveöestvo.</page><page sequence="436">4 1 4 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS §3.0.10 Revzin's constraints on paradigms: homogeneity Revzin calls a language homogeneous {odnorodnyj or formal'no odnorodnyj) if any two paradigms are either represented in the same families or have no families in common,1 i.e. if: A A (P(iui) n Fiw2) *0=&gt; ?(w2) n Fiwi) *Jd) (3.0.10.1) u^eW w2eW A language without morphological homonymy is homogeneous: the same formal case distinctions are found for all nouns.

Consider the conse- quences for homogeneity of uniting õelovék Chuman being') and õelovédestvo ('mankind') in one paradigm as compared with the paradigm of morják ('sailor').4 Fig. 3.0.10.3 Fi 1 delovék morják ... | F2 I L1J õelovédestvo ' Celovék is non-homogeneous: its family contains morják, the paradigm of which does not contain a word that is contained in the family of õelovéõestvo. 1 Revzin 1966b (4.28): 85. 2 Kulagina I960: 232, 1958: 206 iprostoj). Marcus has adopted homogeneity from Revzin but retains simplicity in the sense of Kulagina (e.g. in Marcus 1967a (2.3): 46). 3 The main exceptions to this observation are due to stress phenomena. Thus, stala ('became, feminine') coincides with stab ('became, neuter1). But some morphological distinctions in the verb even survive re- duction rules which are normally considered phonological, i.e. automatic: the normative pronunciations of the endings of the third person singular {xódit, 'goes') and the third person plural {xódjat, 'go') for verbs which stress the stems in these forms are distinguished [it] versus tet] or [ut].

The application of the homogeneity criterion is not devoid of arbitrariness. If Revzin's semantic criteria for the delimitation of paradigms are in fact so crude that they leave doubts about õelovék and õelovéõestvo, they may as well allow neuter words in the paradigm of morják, say more Csea') or morexódstvo ('navigation1), so that a homogeneous language is obtained. The same applies to R-simplicity. If it serves to separate verbal aspects, what keeps us from applying it to the Estonian comitative and abessive? The problem is the hybrid nature of Revzinfs labelling constraints. On the one hand, the native speaker, intuition or another model is trusted to provide the set of para- digms, which is therefore located in the base component. On the other hand, the set of paradigms is tested against particular criteria of simplicity and elegance (concealed as R-simplicity and homogeneity) which the investigator is free to apply when he intuitively distrusts his own or someone else's intuition. This double appeal to intuition creates a methodological vacuum the ultimate consequence of which is the abolition of the concept of paradigm by assigning trivial values to it, such as the unit partition, which are most certain to fulfil all requirements of simplicity and elegance. What is needed here is a clear-cut distinction between what is really given (and must be located in the base component) in Revzin's conception of 'paradigm' and what can be derived in the model itself. §3.0.11 Revzin's constraints on paradigms: well-given paradigms Revzin acknowledges the arbitrariness of R-simplicity and homogeneity and proposes to set a limit to their application. He provides the following typological definition. A language is a language with well-given {xoroSo zadannyj) paradigms if any parti- tion which is broader than the given partition into paradigms entails an increase of the number of non-simple and non-homogeneous words,1 i.e. an increase in K-simplic- ity.2 Consider the déti case for exemplification. The neutral translation of English child is rebënok; the neutral translation of children is déti. Some grammarians consider 1 Revzin 1967b (5.35): 128.

This yields two possible situations. Consider Pi. Pi: Fig. 3.0.11.1 P P P Fi otéc rebënok 8 'father'; 'child' F2 1 otcy | 8 1 déti ' 'fathers'; 'children1 In the language of Pi the paradigms are not well-given: there is a partition P2 which is broader than Pi and does not yield more non-R-simple and non-homogeneous words: P2: Fig. 3.0.11.2 P P Fj otéc rebenok F2 1 otcy I déti In the language of P2, the paradigms are well-given: the only possible broader parti- tioa which unites Piotéc) and Pirebënok), yields non-R-simple words. It will be examined now whether the criterion of well-givenness solves the prob- lems for which it was devised. Consider the question of whether the singular and plu- ral forms of a noun belong to the same paradigm.1 The question can be reduced to choosing between giving paradigms as P3 and giving them as P4 below. The word sútki ('period of 24 hours') is a plurale tantum, a noun which has only plural forms. P3: Fig. 3.0. 11.3 P P Fi górod 8 'town' F2 gorodá sútki 'towns'; 'period of 24 hours' P4: Fig. 3.0.11.4: Y Y Y Fi górod 8 8 F2 1 8 1 gorodá ' sútki Partition P3, in which singular and plural are united, belongs to a language with well- given paradigms because the only broader partition, which unites Pigórod) and Pisútki), entails a loss of R-simplicity. But P4, in which singular and plural are separat- ed, is also part of a language with well-given paradigms: consider set P of the parti- tions which are broader than P4. P = { {P(górod) u Pigorodá), P(sútki)}, {Pigórod) u P(sútki' Pigorodá)}, {P(sútki) u P{gorodá' Pigórod)}, { Pigórod) u Pigorodá) u Pisútki) } } (3.0. 11.1) 1 This was considered an important topic among Russian grammarians: frequent reference is made to "the Fortunatov tradition", which can probably be traced back to Fortunatov 1901-1902/1956: 162, and in which singular and plural are regarded as constituting separate paradigms. The point will be returned to in §3.3.14 and §§4.6.37ff.</page><page sequence="440">4 1 8 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS It is easily verified that any partition broader than P4 entails a loss of R-simplicity and homogeneity. Well-givenness is in fact a derivative of a relative concept which could be called better-givenness. For a partition Pi which is broader than partition Pt-i, there can be a partition Pj+i which is broader than Pj, so that chains of subsequently broader partitions can be identified. Revzin provides a procedure to identify, for each chain, a partition Pj of optimally given paradigms, which is broader than Pj-i but does not entail a lesser degree of K-simplicity than Pj-i, and which is finer than PJ+i but shows a greater degree of K-simplicity than Pj+j. This does not mean that Revzin's definition provides a single optimally given set of paradigms for each language (in that case P would not be a derived concept). As was shown in § 1.1.13, chains of increasingly broader partitions are not usually unique for a set of words: there are pairs of partitions (Pi, P2) such that Pi is neither broader nor finer than P2. The relation 'broader than1 determines a dominance relation (more precisely, a lattice with certain special properties) on the set of partitions of a set, which is illustrated with a simple example in Fig. 1.1.13.1. There is an optimal partition for each possible chain of subsequently broader partitions that can be set up from the unit partition to the improper partition. Linguistically, not all possible chains are of interest. Consider, as an example, partitions P5 and Pa. P5: Fig. 3.0.11.5 P P P P Fi otéc 0 0 0 'father* F2 0 Otcy 0 ¿ëny 'fathers'; 'wives' F3 1 0 1 0 1 ¿ená 1 0 1 'wife' P6: Fig. 3.0.11.6 P P P Fi otéc 0 0 F2 0 otcy ¿e'ny F3 1 ¿ená ' 0 ' 0 The nonsensical partition Pq, in which otéc and ¿ená are united in one paradigm, is optimally given: any broader partition diminishes K-simplicity, and the only finer par- tition, viz. P5, does not increase K-simplicity. The distinction between what is given and what is derived in Revzin's conception of 'paradigm' can now be pinpointed: we must presume that Revzin deems semantic (and possibly morphological) criteria insufficient to provide the set of paradigms directly, but trusts them for the choice of the linguistically relevant chains of increasingly broader partitions into paradigms. His real base component is %¿a, fl2a = (W, //, P) (3.0.11.2) where P is a set of chains of proto-paradigmatic partitions. For each language, Revzin's criterion of well-givenness sees to the identifying of the correct set of paradigms along a chain of given proto-paradigmatic partitions: it has become a model</page><page sequence="441">CHAPTER 3.0: INTRODUCTION 4 1 9 of paradigm based on proto-paradigms. Revzin has implicitly provided the interpreta- tion and reality claims for proto-paradigms that Marcus could not give. This implies that, if it is assumed that P3 and P4 belong to a given chain in P, then P4 is to be preferred to P3, since, although P3 is broader, P4 is K-simpler. This does not imply that Revzin's model resolves the problem of the treatment of Russian singu- lar and plural in favour of separate paradigms: the fact that P4 is better-given than P3 does not mean that it is the optimally given set of paradigms in its chain. Consider the following example, which contains singular nouns only. P7: Fig. 3.0.11.7 P P P P Fi górod 0 0_ 0 'towa nominative masculine' F2 0 góroda 0 okná 'town, genitive'; 'window, genitive' F3 0 1 0 1 oknó I 0 1 'window, nominative neuter' We may assume that P7 is found somewhere in the chain between the unit partition and the partition in which all singular forms of a noun are united. Since the syntactic properties of masculine and neuter coincide in the genitive, góroda and okná belong to the same family; this does not apply to the nominative. Here uniting ?(górod) and ?(góroda) into one paradigm already causes an decrease of K-simplicity. The resulting situation is identical to Revzin's example in Fig. 3.0.10.2: Fig. 3.0. 11.8 Pi P2 Fi 1 górod 1 F2 1 góroda L1J okná ' F3 I oknó ... I Thus, although Revzin's criterion of well-givenness is interesting from a technical point of view, it cannot be applied to solve the problems for which it has been devised. It does not provide a solution for the interpretational problems of the set of paradigms. Moreover, when applied to Russian, it qualifies a counter-intuitive set of paradigms as optimal. In conclusion, the various constraints on paradigms which have been proposed by Revzin and Marcus provide counterintuitive results. In a way, this is to be expected. The set of paradigms has been assigned to the base component so as to enable the morphosyntactic models to abstract from the problem of establishing it. It is, then, in- consistent to assign criteria for P inside the model. The base component determines a set of possible languages. The labelling constraints suggest that some languages are more possible than others. (In this, they are different from ordinary constraints, which 'stipulate that languages with certain properties are impossible.) But each time that the labelling constraints stipulate that simple and elegant structures are optimal, it turns out that the data of natural languages show non-simple and non-elegant patterns. It is</page><page sequence="442">420 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS improbable that constraints which are imposed for reasons of simplicity and elegance are valid for paradigm' if reality claims are attributed to both the concept of paradigm and the label paradigm. Even though paradigm can be replaced by a label without re- ality claims (which in fact happens in models which refer to the concept as neighbour- hood[)t the reality claims of the concept of (unordered) paradigm as a set of words with the same lexical meaning remain. And there is, a priori, no reason why such a set must be subject to Revzin's and Marcus' constraints. S 3.0.12 Kulagina's constraint: presentation and falsification Marcus' and Revzin's constraints on the set of paradigms are explicitly added to the base component. But the mathematical specifications of the elements in the base com- ponent itself also contain a few implicit constraints. One of these constraints will be discussed in this section. Other constraints implicit in JI2 will be discussed in Chapter 3.4. Kulagina has introduced unordered paradigms in the base component (as neigh- bourhoods). She points out that the paradigms of a language make up a partition of the set of words.2 This is a constraint on the set of possible languages: it rejects those languages in which words can be elements of two or more unordered paradigms. The advantage of the constraint is that each word token is unambiguously identi- fied as an element of a paradigm through its type: it is known for each word in running text to which paradigm it belongs. But the constraint is not entirely valid. Certain Russian words are elements of more than one paradigm. Here are two examples. 1 Beregú is the first person singular of the present tense of the verb beret* ('collect') and the locative II singular of the noun béreg ('coast', 'bank'). 2 Supriiga is the nominative singular of suprúga ('wife') and the genitive or accusative singular of suprúg ('husband'). This turns P into a system of tolerance classes. If it is desirable to know to which paradigm token words belong, these token words can be labelled by non-homonymous elements of their paradigms. Thus, occurrences of beregú are marked as belonging to P(beréo') or to Pibéreg). This is not possible for homonyms which have all forms in common, such as ikrá, which means 'spawn, caviar' or 'calf (of the leg)'. But this kind of homonymy need not be indicated, because it has no morphosyntactic consequences. The matter is different when the forms of one paradigm make up a subset of an- other paradigm: if one paradigm is a subset of another paradigm, P cannot be repre- sented as a system of tolerance classes.3 Most Russian examples of the inclusion of paradigms in other paradigms of which the present writer is aware can be disputed because there is a semantic link between the two paradigms. Consider the following examples. 1 Cf. §3.0.2. ¿ Kulagina I960: 229, 1958: 203. 3 Cf. §1.1.19.</page><page sequence="443">CHAPTER 3.0: INTRODUCTION 42 1 1 Cás ('hour'): the plural forms coincide with the forms of the plurale tantum õasy meaning 'watch'. 2 Lés ('forest'): the plural forms coincide with the forms of the plurale tantum lesa meaning 'scaffolding'; the singular forms coincide with lés meaning 'wood'. 3 Krúg ('circle'): when meaning 'group of people', krúg has a locative II krugú, which is absent when it indicates a circle in the mathematical sense. 4 had ('harmony'): when harmony between people is referred to, lad has a locative II ladú, which is missing for 'harmony' in the musical sense. 5 Pol ('floor', 'sex'): the meaning 'floor' has a locative II at its disposal, which is miss- ing for the meaning 'sex'. This fails to be a good example because of a stress differ- ence in the nominative plural ('floors': poly-, 'sexes': póly). 6 Par ('steam', 'fallow'): the meaning 'steam' possesses a locative II, which the meaning 'fallow' does not possess. This seems to be the only perfect example for Russian nouns. 7 For verbs, one may think of instances where an impersonal verb is homonymous with a verb occurring in all persons; polomát'sja, for example, occurs only in the third person when meaning 'to be broken collectively (of things)' and in all persons when meaning 'to spend some time breaking'. 8 For adjectives, one may think of such words as stolóvyj ('related to a table'), the feminine (stolóvaja) and inanimate plural forms of which are also used to express the meaning 'refectory'. Whether or not the given examples are acceptable, a model must take into account the possibility that such examples exist. A language *L which coincides with Russian except that póly is found meaning 'floors' instead of poly is perfectly possible: there is no reason to exclude *L from the set of possible languages with a constraint which stipulates that paradigms make up systems of tolerance classes. This implies that P can no longer be given in terms of the relation 'have the same lexical meaning as1 in W. We must consider giving W as a set of feature classes, i.e. as a set of sets without further restrictions.1 (Note that this still accommodates the two meanings of ikrá in one paradigm.) This implies for token words that occurrences of homonymous words are marked with labels that are not elements of W: there is no form of par which can be used to indicate that it belongs to the paradigm for the meaning 'fallow*. A special conventional label must be introduced, e.g. cf allow or cparj'. But even a representation of P as a system of feature classes is not sufficient. There are lexical items with identical sets of forms (like ikrá) which are not morpho- syntactically interchangeable, because their forms, although identical, are not used for the same functions (unlike those of the two meanings of ikrá). Here are some examples. 1 Liik ('onion', 'bow'): the form lúku is dative singular for both meanings but is also genitive II for the meaning 'onion'; the meaning 'bow' does not have a genitive II. 2 Brak ('spoilage', 'marriage'): the dative singular form bráku is also used as a genitive II for the meaning 'spoilage', but not for the meaning 'marriage'. 1 Cf. §1.1.24.</page><page sequence="444">422 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS 3 Lieo (Tace1, 'person'): the accusative plural lica is identical to the nominative plural for the meaning 'face'; the accusative plural lie is identical to the genitive plural for the meaning 'person'. 4 Rák ('crawfish', 'cancer'): the genitive and accusative coincide in both singular and plural for the meaning 'crawfish' iráka, rákov' the nominative and accusative co- incide in both singular and plural for the meaning 'cancer' (rák, ráki). The same happens with the noun kulak, which has an animate meaning 'kulak'1 and an inani- mate meaning 'fist*. 5 Volokita ('red tape', 'ladykiller'): the endings are used like those of reká ('river') for the meaning 'red tape' (i.e. accusative plural coincides with nominative plural); the endings are used like those of sirotá ('orphan') for the meaning 'ladykiller' (i.e. ac- cusative plural coincides with genitive plural).2 The existence of words of this type implies that it is not possible to denote P as a system of synthetic features, i.e. as a set of sets.3 If two words have identical unor- dered paradigms but nevertheless show deviant behaviour from a morphosyntactic viewpoint, they cannot be described in terms of paradigms. Thus, Kulagina's constraint, which is implied by giving P as a set of sets of ele- ments of W, is not warranted. Lexical meanings as features of words are not subject to any constraints. The relation between words and lexical meanings itself must be given, as a feature system which admits equivalent features. §3.0.13 Kulagina's constraint: an alternative presentation The feature system which replaces P contains pairs each of which consists of a word and a label which indicates a lexical meaning. When introducing paradigms for mor- pho-syntactic modelling, one cannot escape introducing a semantic representation for the set of words: words can only be given as pairs, consisting of a string (e.g. of phonemes) and a label which distinguishes lexical meanings. Note that it is sufficient here to attach extensional labels to the lexical meanings. Thus, the label cclock&gt; or c£asy&gt;, when used to indicate the lexical meaning of õasyy does not indicate a universal concept clock' but is a language-specific label which is assigned to a unit in a relational structure which meets the specifications provided by the base component. The fact that lexical meanings do not define classes of words has consequences for the way in which the base component is denoted. Base component 5Ï2 is replaced by 5Í26, which can be denoted as follows.4 *2t&gt; = (CP&gt;. W, W'H') (3.0.13.1) 1 Cf. §0.6. 2 In the dictionaries, the rather old-fashioned noun volokita Cladykiller') is marked as masculine, but its semantic and formal similarity to the group of common-gender nouns which denote persons with bad habits in a derogatory manner (such as son ja 'sleepyhead', p'jánica 'drunkard', xaniá 'bigot', stilßga 'mod') raises the suspicion that the dictionary marking is only based on considerations of pragmatics: perhaps dic- tionary compilers consider it improbable that people using an old-fashioned word for 'ladykiller' (or people using the word in an age when it was not old-fashioned) can imagine a female specimen. 3 Cf. §1.1.25. 4 A more precise denotation would be «2b * H'[Wt?' W))).</page><page sequence="445">CHAPTER 3.0: INTRODUCTION 423 where CP&gt; is the set of labels of lexical meanings; W is the set of words; set W is a subset of the Cartesian product of CP&gt; and W, i.e. W c &lt;P&gt; * W: it is interpreted as the set of pairs (cpi&gt;, Wj) of lexical meanings and words; H' is a harp on W: it contains the grammatical strings of pairs which each consist of a word and its lexical meaning. Thus, if CP&gt; contains the elements 'father, conion&gt; and cbow&gt; and W contains the ele- ments otéc, otcá, otcú, ¡úk, Iúkat and lúku, then W may contain the pairs ('father, otéc), (conion&gt;, lúk' (cbow&gt;, lúk' («father, otea), (conion&gt;, lúka' (cbow&gt;, lúka), ('father, otcú' (&lt;onion&gt;, lúku' (&lt;bow&gt;, lúku) (3.0.13.2) Harp H' may then contain the string of pairs Mather, oféc)(&lt;onion&gt;, lúka) (3.0.13.3) 'the father of the onion' Base component fyb is equivalent to % except that the unwarranted constraint on the set of paradigms is removed. Kulagina's constraint can be maintained, or reintroduced, as a trivial consequence of defining paradigms over the set of pairs of lexical meanings and words. We can de- fine a new set Ps which is a partition of W and contains the sets of pairs of lexical meanings and words the first place of which is occupied by identical lexical meanings. PS={P|PC'TA A ( A &lt;p'&gt; = &lt;p&gt; A A &lt;p"&gt; * &lt;p&gt;) } (3.0. 13.4) (cp&gt;, w) e P (cp'&gt;, w') e P (cp"' w") e W'' P The lexical meaning of a subset in Ps is unique by definition, so that it identifies the subset. The s-paradigm Ps(cp&gt;) belonging to a meaning cp} can be defined as follows. Ps(&lt;p&gt;) = {(&lt;p&gt;, w) | w e W A (&lt;p&gt;, wie W'} (3.0.13.5) Since sharing a lexical meaning is an equivalence relation for the set of pairs consist- ing of a lexical meaning and a string, s-paradigms make up a partition: s-paradigms meet Kulagina's constraint. Two sets of strings can be derived from the strings of pairs in H': set Hw of the strings of words which occur in the second place of each pair in a string in //', and set H? which contains the strings of semantic labels in the pairs which make up the strings in H' Hw={w[...wn' A (lui e W A V (&lt;pi&gt;, w') . . . fyn', Vhù e Hi) } isisn {£Pi&gt;,..,cPn&gt;}ccP&gt; (3.0.13.6) The reality claims of Hw coincide entirely with the reality claims of H in Kulagina's original base component. Word segments are now a derived concept instead of a primitive. H? = {&lt;pi&gt;. . . &lt;pn&gt; | A (&lt;pi&gt; G &lt;PJ A V (&lt;pi&gt;, lui) ...

The representation is rather sim- ple, the semantic units being only lexical units in a one-to-one correspondence with word occurrences, but it is a start. The strings will be called P-images. They corre- spond to what is called Pstructures in set-theoretical linguistics1 and will be dis- cussed in §3.1.2. S 3.0.14 Six conceptions of 'word' The above state of affairs may create confusion as to the concept or concepts cov- ered by the word word. In this section, a list of six different uses of word is given. A similar list of five concepts corresponding to word was compiled by Zaliznjak. The present list differs from Zaliznjak's, which was based on different types of semantic elements [nominative (nominatif, nominativnyj) and syntactic, grammatical and non- grammatical, and their intersections) which are undefined and cannot be related to the present base component.2 Some of the concepts listed here are found in Gladkij's model, however.3 1 Word i is what is called word token or occurrence in the present study:4 a segment of segmentation W in the strings in H or Hw.5 Zaliznjak labels this unit concrete segment: a unit of the external side of a text (or, probably, an utterance in a non- determined degree of identification abstraction; cf. the discussion of identity in §2.1.10). 2 Word2 is what is called word type in the present study, i.e. an element of set W. Word2 is Zaliznjak's abstract segment. According to Zaliznjak, it is the result of "abstraction of identification", i.e. f"the abstraction which enables us to speak of two similar objects as one and the same object".6 3 'V0rd3 is a two-sided token, i.e. a pair of elements of CP&gt; and W which occurs as a minimal segment in H'. It does not coincide with Zaliznjak's concrete word form (forme lexicale, slovoforma) or concrete syntagmatic word, as the meaning label of the latter includes grammatical meanings.7 It does, however, correspond to Glad- kij's (lexically meaningful ) segment.8 4 Word4 is a two-sided type, corresponding to the tokens represented by words, i.e. an element of W. Zaliznjak's abstract word form or abstract syntagmatic word again contains grammatical meanings. 1 E.g. Marcus 1967a (1.5): 8. z Zaliznjak 1969 (1-7): 43-52, 1967b (1.1-1.7): 19-29. Zaliznjak's semantic conception will be returned to in §4.6.43. 3 Gladkij 1983 (l&gt;. 192-194. 4 Types and tokens: cf. §2.0.1 and 2.0.2. 5 Cf. Chapter 2.1 for attempts to establish such segmentations. 6 Zaliznjak 1969 (2.3): 43, 1967b (1.2): 19. This property is, incidentally, not distinctive, since the text it- self is the result of abstraction of identification- after different utterances or texts have been determined to be identical for linguistic Durooses. the same criteria can in principle be used to identify their segments. 7 Zaliznjak 1969 (2.4): 44, 1967b (1.2k 20. 8 Gladkij 1983 (I* 193-194.</page><page sequence="447">CHAPTER 3.0: INTRODUCTION 425 5 Words is Zaliznjak's word as paradigmatic word or lexeme, i.e. ras a unit of the dictionary, that is, as the two-sided extra-textual unit of language which arises on the basis of an analysis of all the texts of a given language".1 A lexeme is obtained, according to Zaliznjak, by means of the identification abstraction of all word forms with the same lexical, or properly nominative (proprement nominatif, sobstvenno nominativnyfi), meanings. Zaliznjak's lexemes correspond to s-paradigms, i.e. ele- ments of Ps, i.e. sets of elements of W with the same cp&gt;: Gladkij's neighbourhoods.3 The two-sidedness of the lexeme is not essential: paradigms are in a trivial one-to- one correspondence with simple lexical meanings in CP&gt;, so that it makes no differ- ence whether we speak of lexemes as paradigms or as lexical meanings. Zaliznjak does not distinguish concrete (token) and abstract (type) lexemes, pointing out that they are necessarily abstract. Yet in certain set-theoretical models of part of speech1, the concept of token lexeme (or token lexical meaning) is in fact employed,4 so that a sixth concept can be added to the list. 6 Wordß is the lexical meaning of a concrete minimal segment in running text, i.e. a minimal segment of a string in H?. The six different conceptions of 'word1 can be visualized in the following scheme.

It is possible to do so and nevertheless to remove Kulagina's constraint by changing the interpretation of the symbols. So far W has stood for the set of words2 and H for strings made up of words2, which are consequently words3. Since words i and words2 will not be needed in the remain- der of this part, W can now be used to indicate words4, so that the segments in H will be words3. Thus, what was denoted by W in the preceding section will henceforth be indicated by W, and what was denoted by H' will be denoted by H.

S 3.0.16 The range of derivations determined by the base component of twin string models Base component fl2 determines a range of derivations. Consider the following invento- ry. 1 Base component fl2 determines two kinds of type words: a word forms (words4); b lexical meanings or paradigms (i.e. words5&gt;. 2 Base component ^2 determines two kinds of contexts:2 a formal contexts made up of token word forms (words^; b P-contexts made up of token lexical meanings or paradigms (i.e. words6&gt;. N-contexts, which were derived from the numeric images of phrases in §2.2.27, will be left out of consideration in Part 3. 3 The two types of words and two types of contexts can be combined to yield four kinds of admission: a word forms in formal contexts; b word forms in P-contexts; c paradigms (lexical meanings) in formal contexts; d paradigms (lexical meanings) in P-contexts. Technically, two different uses of P-contexts can be distinguished. In the interpre- tation which will be worked out in Chapter 3.1, a distributional feature is obtained for a word or paradigm by assessing its admission for at least one of the potential wordi contexts determined by the words6 in the P-contexts. In the alternative in- terpretation, a feature is obtained by assessing admission for all of the (grammatical) generated wordi contexts. The latter interpretation seems to have little linguistic relevance and will be left out of consideration.3 4 Since both words and contexts can make up the domain of a category, each type of admission determines two feature systems (words as features of contexts and con- texts as features of words), so that eight feature systems are obtained:4 1 Reverse function off. cf. §1.1.6. 2 The list is not exhaustive: N-contexts (as defined in (2.2.27.2)) and various kinds of frames which allow for multiple susbstitution (one of which is implicitly used in §2.2.26) have been excluded from considera- tion. á An analogous class of "bold high P-neighbours" will be formally defined in terms of dependency pairs in (4.2.14.20), followed by some exemplification. But for bold high P-neighbours as well, little linguistic use has been found. 4 Feature systems: cf. § 1.1.21 to § 1.1.23.</page><page sequence="449">CHAPTER 3.0: INTRODUCTION 427 domain features a word forms; formal contexts; b word forms; P-contexts; c paradigms (lexical meanings); formal contexts; d paradigms (lexical meanings); P-contexts; e formal contexts; word forms; f formal contexts; paradigms (lexical meanings); g P-contexts; word forms; h P-contexts; paradigms (lexical meanings). (3.0.16.1) The three following chapters discuss models which focus on part of speech1, gender and case', respectively. It will be shown that models remaining closest to the basic relations that can be derived from the above feature systems are most successful. 5 Each of the eight feature systems in fact yields the following set of basic relations for the domain of Jk1 a equivalence, which yields a partition; b tolerance, which yields: i a system of tolerance classes, which in turn yields other partitions such as: ü the nucleus partition; iii the transitive closure; c dominance, which yields at least three systems of tolerance classes: i the set of progressive products of initial elements; ü the set of regressive products of final elements; iii the tolerance classes yielded by SOtolerance. Each of these systems of tolerance classes in turn yields a nucleus partition and a transitive closure (which coincides for most of these systems of tolerance classes). The relation of U-dominance, which was proposed by Gladkij and produces another, slightly deviating, system of tolerance classes, is left out of considera- tion in Part 3: U-dominance will be defined and compared in §4.6.22. Most of these basic derivations were identified by the Set-theoretical School, and their correspondence to the aforementioned linguistic categories was, to some extent, explored. The equivalence relation (i.e. 5a in the above inventory) usually served as a starting point: it was studied for nearly all feature systems. Thus: - type 4a is represented by DobruSin's and Kulagina's families;2 - type 4b is represented in Trybulec's U-families, which will be discussed in §3.3.10; - type 4c is represented by Mayoh's B-types, which will be introduced in §3.2.34; - type 4d is represented by V.A. Uspenskij's and Kulagina's U-types, which will be introduced in §3.1.2; - type 4e is represented by the kappa families of Revzin's first case model;3 - type 4f is represented by Marcus* P-admission (which serves as an auxiliary con- cept in his case model) and will be discussed in §3.3.2ff. * Relations derived from feature systems: cf. § 1.1.24. 2 Cf.

There have been at least two major approaches to this notion. They can be referred to as morphological and syntactic. In the morphological approach, a specific part of speech is defined by the gram- matical categories which it distinguishes. This results in statements such as: (3/1/1/1) A noun distinguishes case' and number1; an adjective distinguishes case1, number' and 'gender'; a verb distinguishes 'tense' [Zeitwort), 'mood' and "per- son". This approach is typical for linguists who deal with inflectional languages, such as Russian, Greek or Latin. In the beginning of this century, Fortunatov founded a the- ory of 'part of speech on such morphological criteria.1 In the syntactic approach, parts of speech are defined by the sentences in which they occur and their relative position in the sentences. Thus, we find statements such as: (3/1/1/2) Classifiers occur in numeral expressions and connect numerals with the nouns which are determined by the numerals.2 This approach is typical for linguists who deal with isolating languages, such as Chi- nese or Vietnamese. Definitions of 'part of speech which are based on the morphological approach nec- essarily presuppose definitions of morphological categories, or the explicit statement that morphological categories are primitives. Since this study deals with the very definition of morphological categories, the morphological definitions of 'part of speech are only of secondary interest here. It is perhaps for this reason that the Set-theoret- ical School was mainly attracted to the syntactic approach; as was discussed in §2.2.2, most of its definitions of morphological categories either presuppose a definition of part of speech" or are independent of the concept of part of speech. In this chapter, an account is given of the attempts of the Set-theoretical School to apply, within the twin string framework, a syntactic approach to the definition of 'part of speech' which is valid even for morphologically oriented languages such as Russian. The models are based on %¿ (which means fl^: cf. §3.0.15). §3.1.2 V.A. UspenskiJ's U-types: presentation Relational system 5^ is the classic base component of the Set-theoretical School. It is used in a large number of models of 'part of speech, 'gender' and 'case'3 and is the basis of a number of typological distinctions.4 The mathematical properties of ft¿ received 1 Cf.

Uspenskij, who employs the label type (tip).3 Kulagina employs this label for two concepts, the second of which coincides with V.A. Uspenskij's types.4 The latter are also identical to Mayoh's C-typesP They are labelled (J-types in this study, so as to avoid confusion with what is called types in the usage of the present volumes (i.e. the counterpart of tokens). Thus, V.A. Uspenskij's model is based on % Ä2 = (W,«P) (3.1.2.1) where set W is a set of words4;6 set H is a harp on W; set P is a partition of W into paradigms: its elements contain words4 which share the same words. The paradigm of a word w will be denoted as ?{w). Since P is a partition, a paradigm is identified by any of its elements: vf e Hw) =&gt; Hw) = P(ií;') (3. 1.2.2) A convenient auxiliary concept, variants of which will return in future definitions is that of the P-image of a phrase, i.e. the string consisting of the paradigms of the words which occur in the phrase in the order in which they occur in the phrase. In its defini- tion, the free monoid of P will be denoted as H*{P). If h is a phrase in Ht where h=w' . . . wn, then its P-image flh) is defined as follows.7 f(h)= {Pi...Pn|Pi...Pne /T(P)A A Pi = Phüt)} (3.1.2.3) ISián Thus, for each string h of words in //, there is another string P(h) of word classes, the classes being the paradigms of the words of h. Here are some examples; the paradigms are labelled by their dictionary forms. (3/1/2/1) Stáraja kúkla leíala na polú.

It is now easy to see that the family partition of §2.2.5 is only a special case of a derivative partition, viz. that of the unit partition of W. It follows that families coincide with U-types in languages without flexion, i.e. languages with paradigms containing only one word each, or: A Phü)= {w} (3.1.2.16) we W Such languages, which are often referred to as isolating, are called amorphic or amorphous2 in the terminology of the Set-theoretical School. The favourite examples of the school are Chinese and Vietnamese.3 It was shown in §3.0.13 that there is one-to-one correspondence between the to- kens in the strings of H? and the paradigms occurring in P-images: since wordss are lexical meanings and paradigms are sets of words4 with the same lexical meaning, a one-to-one correspondence between lexical meanings and paradigms is assured. This implies that the denotation of #3/1/2/1) as &lt;stáryj&gt; ckúkla&gt; &lt;lezát'3 cna&gt; cpól&gt; (3. 1.2. 17) is equivalent to (3.1.2.4). The latter denotation will be used in the following sections, for P-images as well as for P-contexts. Thus, one of the P-contexts generated by (3.1.2.17) is (&lt;stáryj&gt; &lt;kúkla&gt;, &lt;na&gt; &lt;póW (3. 1.2. 18) which admits the lexical meaning clezát' This shows clearly how the Set-theoretical School has professed the syntactic ap- proach when defining of parts of speech. P-images are essentially semantic represen- tations of the phrases in H (whether they are satisfactory as such is another matter). Parts of speech are defined in terms of the syntactical behaviour (i.e. combinability and position in the sentence) of the only semantic units in the model, viz. of words which are stripped of their morphological properties.4 S 3.1.3 V.A.

'the old table was lying on the doll' The results suggest that there is indeed a fit between U-types and the traditional parts of speech. But the model is less satisfactory in other cases. The success of the model is due to the fact that the substitution of lexical meanings for word forms neutralizes the impact of strong case government, i.e. the restrictions on the choice of case forms of a word which are determined by specific verbs and prepositions. But there are related phenomena which are not neutralized in this ap- proach. Certain grammarians of Russian identify the phenomenon of strong parataxis</page><page sequence="456">434 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS (as far as this translates siVnoe primykanie).1 The range covered by this term varies:2 in this study it is only informally used in a sense which approaches Cesnokova's use of the term:3 to cover any restrictions on the part of governing words which are not covered by agreement, strong government, and strong prepositional government Core examples include selection restrictions which particular verbs impose on lexical items. The subordinate clause marker «eto* Cthat'), for example, can be combined with Revzin's informative verbs,4 i.e. the "verba dicendi", such as cgovorit'&gt; ('say'), but not with other verbs. Due to strong parataxis, the P-context (&lt;já&gt;, &lt;õto&gt;&lt;ljubít'&gt;) (3.1.3.13) T; 'that (subordinate clause marker)1; 'love' admits 'govorit*' ('say') but not crabótat'&gt; ('work'). Similarly the P-context (&lt;já&gt;, &lt;rabótat'&gt;) (3.1.3.14) Ti 'work (infinitive)' admits cxotét'&gt; ('want') but not «govorit'' or crabotat'&gt;. As a consequence of the presence of these instances of strong parataxis, verbs are assigned to various U-types. Strong parataxis is not the only phenomenon to affect part of speech assignment of verbs. Consider the following phrase, which contains an instance of strong preposi- tional government: the verb is connected with its complement through a fixed prepo- sition. (3/1/3/7) Vláznyj klímat vlijáet na zdoróv'e. 'a damp climate affects one's health', lit 'damp climate influences on health' This phrase yields the following P-image. Máznyj' cklímat&gt; cvlijat'&gt; cna&gt; zdoróv'e' (3. 1.3. 15) Semantically, we are dealing here with a single unit vliját ' na 'to affect'. If strings in which forms of cvlijat'&gt; are followed by cv&gt;, such as (3/1/3/8) ?Vláznyj klímat vlijáet vo zdoróv'e. are considered ungrammatical, then the set of P-contexts which admit cv&gt; is different from the set of P-contexts which admit cna&gt;: consequently cvliját'&gt; belongs to a sepa- rate U-type, which is distinct from that of other verbs. Moreover, cv&gt; and cna&gt; belong to different U-types. Also, the P-family of Miját'* will differ from that of other verbs. Some languages contain more sources of unintended U-types. Romanian possesses indefinite articles, but definiteness is expressed by an enclitic which is part of the noun, at least orthographically. When Romanian nouns which denote persons occur as direct objects of transitive verbs, they can be preceded by the "direct object marker" pe, especially when the nouns are determined.5 This implies that, say, the context 1 Cf., for example, Mrazek 1964a: 55; Svedova &amp; al. 1970 (1202-1204): 515-516. ¿ Skoblikova 1971 (3-18): 10-30 is an informative survey of the varying use of weak and strong govern- ment and weak and strong parataxis by various grammarians. Mrázek's [1964a] strong parataxis includes strong prepositional government; in Svedova &amp; al. 1970 obligatory presence of the selected word seems to be essential; Cesnokova [1980: 551 emphasizes the fact that a specific non-case form is required. 0 Cesnokova 1980: 55. 4 Cf.

Moreover, Romanian also possesses an indirect object marker lui which is only used with proper names. Thus, the context idau lui, o carte) (3.1.3.22) 'I give + indirect object marker'; 'a book' with P-context iPidau)Pilui), Pio)P(carte)) (3. 1.3.23) admits Piloni but does not admit Pibärbat) or P(pom). Thus, since the distribution of each of the adduced nouns is different, the Roma- nian nouns are spread over at least three U-types. Revzin's proposals for amendments which must prevent such counterintuitive re- sults will be discussed in §3.1.5. §3.1.4 V.A. Uspensklj's constraint V.A. Uspenskij discusses the relation between U-types and families2 and proposes a constraint. Ht appears, however, that the fact that two elements belong to the same family does not logically im- ply that they belong to the same [U-ltype. (It is possible to construct an artificial example of a language where two elements belong to the same family but to different [U-]types.) In real languages, on the other hand, two elements of the same family apparently belong to the same [U-]type as well. We have to add this property to our postulates by requiring that all languages be regular [pravil'nyji? 1 Assuming that the preposition pe Coa to') and the direct object marker pe are distinct lexical items: if they are considered identical, (3.1.3.18) will admit pom, producing the meaning 'I see while sitting on a tree*.

V.A. Uspenskij calls languages with this property regular.1 This is a typological definition: base com- ponent 9Í2 allows for languages that are not regular. Subsequently, V.A. Uspenskij pro- poses the requirement that natural languages are regular: he turns the typological definition into a constraint by assigning an reality claim to it. The constraint is valid if all possible natural languages are regular. (Revzin provides an example of an artificial language which is not regular.2) V.A. Uspenskij's constraint is the first constraint to be treated in this study which is possibly valid. Its validity depends on the way in which paradigms have been delimited. If, for example, the forms of participles are regarded as parts of verb paradigms, then Russian is not a regular language. If the example of §3.1.3 includes phrases such as (3/1/4/1) IgrájuSõij xuligán stojál na Skafú. 'the playing teddy-boy was standing on the cupboard' with its P-image cigrátf&gt; cxuligán&gt; cstoját'&gt; cna&gt; cSkáf&gt; (3. 1.4.2) then P-context (3.1.3.7) admits verbs as well as adjectives: any verb can take adjecti- val values through its participle. If, at the same time, there are contexts which admit verbs but do not admit adjectives, such as (3.1.4.3) and (3.1.4.4), ('tby) (3.1.4.3) counted" actual particle (ón prodoliálX) (3.1.4.4) 'he continued' then verbs and adjectives do not belong to the same U-type: although it is true that igrájuSõije F(molodój) (3.1.4.5) it is not true that igrájuSdije Tbnolodójl (3.1.4.6) because &lt;igrát'&gt; e Ft&lt;molodój&gt;) (3.1.4.7) Then, V.A.

As we have seen in Chapter 3.0, such models are not available in early set-theoretical modelling.1 §3.1.5 Revzin's elementary T-categories and hypertypes: presenta- tion In §3.1.3 it was shown how specific selectional properties of lexical items, such as strong parataxis, strong prepositional government and direct and indirect object markers, prevent identification of U-types with parts of speech. Revzin examines some instances of lexical selection and proposes a number of amendments.2 Revzin's material shows that certain cases of lexical selection do not affect the re- sulting U-types. The noun ovladénie ('seizure') governing the instrumental3 belongs to the same U-type as oknó ('window'), which requires the genitive for any nominal that depends on it, as is illustrated by the following phrases and their P-images. (3/1/5/1) Já smotrél na oknó dòma. 'I looked at the window of the house' cjá&gt; csmotrét'5 cna&gt; &lt;oknó&gt; 'dorn* (3. 1 .5. 1 ) (3/1/5/2) Já smotrél na ovladénie dómom. 'I looked at the seizure of the house* cjá&gt; «smotréf* cna&gt; ovladénie' cdóm&gt; (3. 1.5.2) However, Revzin notes that unintended U-types appear in instances of what is called strong parataxis in the present study. The noun iskússtvo Cart') requires the infinitive ('the art to') or the genitive ('the art of). But paradigms containing infinitives (i.e. verbs) and paradigms containing genitives (i.e. nouns) have different distributions, so the P- family of iskússtvo» does not coincide with that of «oknó5 and ovladénie5. This is illus- trated by the following strings and their P-images. (3/1/5/3) Ón znál ob iskússtve risovát'. 'he knew about the art of painting1, lit. 'he knew about the art to paint' &lt;ón&gt; cznát'&gt; co&gt; ciskússtvo&gt; crisovát'&gt; (3. 1.5.3) The P-context (cón&gt; cznát'&gt; co&gt;, Risovát'') (3. 1.5.4) does not admit covladénie&gt; or coknó&gt;, because P-images (3.1.5.5) and (3.1.5.6) are un- grammatical, i.e. there are no grammatical phrases h in //such that (3.1.5.5) or (3.1.5.6) is the P-image of h. *cón&gt; cznát'&gt; co&gt; covladénie' crisovát'&gt; (3. 1.5.5) "«on» cznát'&gt; co&gt; coknó&gt; crisováf&gt; (3. 1.5.6) * A solution in the vein of the period would be to turn regularity' in V.A. Uspenskij's sense into a label- ling constraint on paradigms, which would both solve the problem of determining paradigms and yield the required set of regular languages. The disadvantages of this approach were discussed in §3.0.1 1. For a model which distinguishes between lexical and grammatical meanings, cf.

Compare: (3/1/5/4) egó predpolozénie, oto oná priédet 'his assumption that she will come' (3/1/5/5) *egó oknó, õto oná priédet 'his window that she will come' 2 The noun vozmóznost1 ('possibility') requires the infinitive and the genitive, but can also be followed by dependent clauses introduced by õto or dto'by ('in order that'). Compare: (3/ 1 /5/6) vozmóznost' riso vát' 'the possibility to draw' (3/ 1 /5/7) vozmóznost' vojny 'the possibility of war' (3/1/5/8) vozmóznost', oto oná priédet 'the possibility that she will come' (3/1/5/9) Emú sózdali vsé vozmóznosti, õtóby stát' grámotnym õelovékom. 'they created all opportunities for him to become a literate person' 3 The noun sposóbnost* ('capability') requires the infinitive and the genitive, but is also followed by the preposition k ('toward'). Consider: (3/1/5/10) egó sposóbnost' k múzyke 'his talent for music' 4 The noun ¡jubo'v' Clove') is followed by the preposition ky but can of course also be combined with another noun in the genitive. Compare: (3/1/5/11) egó ljubóv' k ródine 'his (he, genitive) love for the fatherland' Revzin points out that these words have one thing in common: besides being admitted by certain special P-contexts, as in the above phrases, they are also admitted by contexts which admit ordinary nouns. Compare: (3/1/5/12) iskússtvo studénta 'the art of the student' (3/1/5/13) predpolozénie studénta 'the assumption of the student' (3/ 1 /5/ 1 4) vozmóznost' studénta 'the possibility of the student' (3/1/5/15) sposóbnost' studénta 'the capability of the student' (3/1/5/16) ljubóv' studénta 'the love of the student' (3/1/5/17) oknó studénta 'the window of the student' The converse is not true. This suggests that the relation between T(okno') and special U-types such as T{iskússtvo' l(predpolo¿énie' Tivozmóínost'X Tisposóbnost') and T(ljubóv') can be described in terms of substitutability dominance among lexical</page><page sequence="461">CHAPTER 3.1: PARTS OF SPEECH 439 meanings: e.g. the set of P-contexts admitting coknó&gt; is a subset of the set of P-con- texts admitting cljubóv' The dominance relation among the aforementioned U-types can be represented in the following scheme. Fig. 3. 1 .5. 1 T(oknó) H predpolozénie ) T( iskússtvo) li ljubóv') livozmóznosV) li sposóbnost) The definition of substitutability dominance given in (2.2.16.4) and all definitions of derived concepts in the sections following it, have their analogues for substitutability dominance of U-types; there is no need to repeat them here. The counterpart for U- types of initial family1 is labelled initial U-type. Fig. 3.1.5.1 suggests that l(okno) is an initial U-type. The counterpart for U-types of elementary grammatical category (i.e. the progressive product of an initial U-type)2 is labelled elementary T-category.3 The graph suggests that all U-types contained in it belong to the elementary T-category of oknó since they are dominated by l(oknâ. Revzin also considers the transitive closure4 of the set of elementary T-categories and calls the classes of this partition hypertypes. In Fig. 3.1.5.1, the elementary T- category of oknó and its hypertype coincide. Both concepts apparently account for the Russian part of speech called noun. Similarly, verbs can be united into a single elementary T-category or hypertype by an impersonal verb without any selectional properties, such as morózit' ('freeze'). But as Revzin introduces more material, the fit becomes less close. Revzin points out that personal pronouns can always be replaced by nouns but that the converse is not true. Consider: (3/1/5/18) Onó võerá bylo tám. 'it was there yesterday' (3/1/5/19) Oknó võerá bylo tám. 'the window was there yesterday' (3/1/5/20) Bol'Sóe oknó võerá bylo tám.

This is shown in the following figure. Fig. 3.1.5.2 Konó ) ^ T(oknó ) Tipredpolozénie ) TÜskússtvo ) T( ljubóv' ) T( vozmóznost' ) Tisposóbnost ' ) A similar situation is obtained for adjectives: pronominal adjectives dominate other adjectives. For example, mój ('my') and étot ('this') can always be replaced by a regular adjective, but the converse does not hold. Consider: (3/1/5/22) mój dòn 'my house1 (3/1/5/23) borsójdóm 'big house' (3/1/5/24) óoen' bol'Sój dorn Very big house' (3/1/5/25) *óõen' mój dorn Selectional properties single out special U-types of adjectives, such as T(sposóbnyj) ('capable') and Tigrámotnyj) ('literate').

But it is the P-images of phrases that count: even if (3/1/5/35), is ungrammatical, its P-image «ol'Sóf &lt;2ízn'&gt; &lt;studént&gt; (3. 1.5. 1 1) is in fact acceptable, since it is also the P-image of (3/1/5/36) borsája zízn1 studénta 'the big life of the student* This phenomenon will be returned to in Chapter 3.4 and §4.4.3. The precise position of words such as pólnyj in the U-type dominance graph does not affect the present models as long as no reality claims are maintained for intermediate derivations. The connection between nouns and adjectives depends on one's views of grammat- icality. Consider the somewhat elliptical phrase</page><page sequence="464">442 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS (3/1/5/37) ?Ön govorít o bol'Sóm svoëm.

'he is talking about about the big house' Let us assume that (3/1/5/37) is rejected. Then there are P-contexts which admit nouns but do not admit adjectives. In that case the position of the so-called substan- tivized adjectives must be considered. Take, for example, slepój Cblind'), which can be substituted for nouns as well as adjectives. Compare: (3/1/5/39) uõílisõe dlja molodyx morjakóv 'teaching institute for young sailors' (3/1/5/40) uõíliSee dlja molodyx slepyx 'teaching institute for young blind people' (3/1/5/41) uõíliSõe dlja slepyx morjakóv 'teaching institute for blind sailors' The following situation obtains.

T+(onó)1 and T+(j7io/), which overlap in Tislepój) and can be interpreted as the set of nouns and the set of adjectives, respectively. T+(onóì and T+(mój) are united into one hypertype. These results do not conflict with the concept of part of speech. In linguistic tradi- tion, parts of speech have often been regarded as a hierarchical system of classes, consisting of subclasses and superclasses: it can be considered an asset of a model when it unites nouns, adjectives and pronouns into one class of nominais, while at the same time distinguishing nouns and adjectives at a lower level. That pronouns end up divided between nouns and adjectives is nothing novel: even in traditional grammar, 1 Set T+{w) is the progressive product of a U-type T[w). Cf. its analogue for families in §2.2.16.</page><page sequence="465">CHAPTER 3.1: PARTS OF SPEECH 443 pronouns are considered a heterogeneous class, united on the basis of considerations which deviate from those determining other classes. The above material has been given mainly for the sake of an example. Revzin him- self points out that the actual complexity of the phenomenon of substantivized adjec- tives is not reflected in the model. He quotes Jodlowski, who distinguishes at least four degrees of substantivation for adjectives on the basis of considerations which cannot be formalized in the model.1 A detailed discussion of the problem is outside the scope of the present study, but the point is connected with the recurrent problem of the grammatically of a phrase. Let us assume a more lenient view of grammaticality and consider "spontaneous" substantivation to always be possible: we can always conjure up a situation in which (3/1/5/37) is a grammatical phrase, say, as an answer to the question (3/1/5/42) Reo' idet o kakóm rebënke? 'about which child is one talking?' Adjectives will in that case be dominated by nouns and end up in the same part of speech (in both the same elementary T-category and the same hypertype) with them. Thus, the adequacy of Revzin's manipulations of T-dominance depends on judge- ments of grammaticality. But even if the above results could be considered both at- tainable and desirable, the question remains whether the success can be repeated for other languages. Consider the Romanian example given in §3.1.3. Paradigms P(pom) and P(bärbat) in fact belong to the same elementary T-category and the same hypertype as P(pom) dominates Pibärbat): the former is admitted by P-context (3.1.3.19) whereas the latter is admitted by (3.1.3.19), (3.1.3.20), and (3.1.3.21). But Pilori neither dominates P(pom) or Pibärbat) nor is dominated by either. To the present writer's knowledge, there is no nominal lexical meaning which dominates both cIon&gt; and cbärbat&gt; (i.e. can be replaced by either in all of its P-contexts) or is dominated by both (i.e. can replace cIon&gt; after clui&gt; and cbãrbat&gt; after cun&gt;). Therefore it is not excluded that the model, as it is conceived to work, will not assign all traditional Romanian nouns to a single T- category or even hypertype. S 3.1.6 Revzin's auxiliary words Certain parts of speech, such as prepositions, create further complications for the models of elementary T-category1 and 'hypertype1. In §3.1.3 it was shown that, due to strong prepositional government, the prepositions v and na belong to different U- types. Consider, again, example (3/1/3/7), which determines context (3.1.6.1) and P- context (3.1.6.2), admitting, respectively, na and cna&gt;, but not v(or vo) and cv&gt;: ( vláinyj klímat vlijáet, zdoróv'e) (3. 1 .6. 1 ) MáZny j&gt; cklí mat' cvliját' &lt;zdoró v*e&gt;) (3. 1 .6.2) Judging by the examples which have been adduced so far, v and na will be united into one elementary T-category or hypertype because T(v) dominates Tina). But if (P-)contexts are included which admit v but do not admit na, there is no dominance relation between v and na. In fact, we find a context: 1 Revzin 1967b (4.27): 107; Jodtowski 1961 (4&gt;. 62.</page><page sequence="466">444 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS [célitsja, vorónu) (3.1.6.3) 'aims'; 'crow* with its P-image (&lt;célit'sja&gt;, cvoróna&gt;) (3. 1.6.4) which admits v to make up the phrase (3/1/6/1) Célitsja v vorónu. 'he aims at the crow' but is not generally considered to admit na. Now it may be the case that both U-types are dominated by a third preposition, say ü Cat'), or that cna&gt; is in fact admitted to indicate the location of the event: (3/1/6/2) TCélitsJa na voróne. 'he aims (while sitting) on the crow' In that case the problem may not be urgent for Russian. But even thea the base com- ponent of the model contains languages in which there will be at least one instance of strong government for every preposition, i.e., assigning each preposition to its own one-member part of speech. This state of affairs is too feasible to be excluded by a constraint. A similar situation is found for classifiers. Consider the Indonesian example of §2.2.5. In principle, classifiers occur in mutually exclusive contexts. Thus, the context (saya ambii mahasiswa dua, X) (3. 1.6.5) 'I take student two' admits the classifier orang but not ekor or pucuk; the context isaya ambii ay am dua, X) (3. 1.6.6) 'I take chicken two' admits the classifier ekor but not orang or pucuk; the context {saya ambii surat dua, X) (3.1.6.7) 'I take letter two' admits the classifier pucuk but not orang or ekor.1 This implies that classifiers do not belong to a single U-type. Whether or not they end up in the same separate elementary T-category depends on the status of their lexical meanings. As long as P is given as a partition of W, they must have a lexical meaning. There are three possibilities. 1 The lexical meaning of a classifier coincides with the meaning of its etymon. Orang means 'man' when not used as a classifier. The same lexical meaning is denoted when orang is used as a classifier. As a consequence, orang is admitted by contexts which admit other, ordinary, nouns as well as contexts in which it is admitted as a classifier. As a result, orang is dominated by ordinary nouns and belongs to the same elementary T-category and hypertype as ordinary nouns. Consequently, the model does not yield a special part of speech containing the classifiers of a lan- guage. This situation is not altogether satisfactory. Also, it separates orang from 1 Since this fragment of Indonesian is amorphic, P-contexts are in one-to-one correspondence with ordi- nary contexts and need not be given separately.</page><page sequence="467">CHAPTER 3.1: PARTS OF SPEECH 445 classifiers which do not formally coincide with other words, such as ¡abuh, which is used as a classifier for curtains and fishing nets but has no independent meaning.1 2 Classifiers and their etyma are treated as homonyms, i.e. orang meaning 'man' and orang as a classifier are treated as different words3. The meaning of the classifier orang can then be denoted as CCLASSHUM&gt;, that of ekor as CCLASSANIM&gt; and that of pucuk as CCLASSSHOOT&gt;; or the meanings can simply be denoted as «CLASSI5, «CLASSI I&gt; and «CLASSI 1 1' In this way the position of the classifiers corresponds to that of the prepositions described above: there are differential P-contexts for each classifier and there is no initial P-family which dominates all classifiers and ac- commodates them in one elementary T-category. This situation, in which each classifier makes up a separate part of speech, is even less satisfactory than the situations described above. 3 All classifiers have the same lexical meaning, say CCLASS' This is tantamount to stating that the classifiers make up a paradigm. The definition of classifiers as parts of speech is now largely trivial from the point of view of the model, since the elements of a paradigm automatically belong to the same part of speech (whether U-type, elementary T-category, or hypertype) and the element which unites them is given from outside. This approach does have some interesting side-effects: classifiers often occur in languages which are considered to be amorphic, i.e. in which paradigms have only one member, such as Chinese or Vietnamese. The paradigm of «CLASS' would violate the amorphic status of these languages. Another side-effect is the existence of paradigms lacking a morphological basis. Revzin, who considers the problem only in passing, seems to consider the second pos- sibility as inevitable within the present conception, but is not satisfied with it: fIt is interesting to see that our classification of the parts of speech works only for words with a full meaning {polnoznadnoe slovo) and is not appropriate for words which do not have a full meaning, be- cause for the latter group it assigns almost every word to a separate hypertype. For this reason it is nec- essary to provide a preliminary classification into auxiliary isluiebnyj) words and words with a full meaning [...] and to carry out the partition into parts of speech only afterward for the set of non-auxiliary words.2 Thus, auxiliary words must be found before parts of speech can be defined. In the Set-theoretical School, several attempts have been undertaken to define auxiliary words. P.S. Kuznecov's phonic definition was discussed in §2.1.9 and §2.1.11. Revzin has defined words having a full meaning in semantic terms as r words which designate certain objects or phenomena in extra-linguistic reality".3 It follows that the remain- der are auxiliary jwords. Revzin does, however, realize that the distinctions on which the definition is based are not present in base component %&amp;), which does not contain the difference between intra-linguistic and extra-linguistic meanings. He therefore 1 In Omar 1972/1975 (1): 243-245, four degrees of motivation for classifiers are distinguished 1 fully transparent classifiers: orang means 'human being1 and is a classifier for human beings; 2 partly transparent classifiers: pucuk means 'shoot (of a plant)' and is a classifier for bamboo shoots, but also for letters and fire-arms; 3 non-transparent classifiers: mata means 'eye' but is used as a classifier for steps and dishes; 4 exclusive classifiers: cf. labuh above. 2 Revzin 1967b (4.29): 112. á Revzin 1967b (3.14): 60.</page><page sequence="468">446 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS proposes two definitions of auxiliary words in terms of fl2. The definitions are based on two auxiliary definitions of special types of words which have been provided by Marcus. The first auxiliary definition determines set A of amorphic words:1 A= {w'we WAP(uj)s {w}} (3.1.6.8) This set contains all words that are the unique elements of their paradigms. It singles out na, but not v if its variant vo is considered to be contained in the paradigm of v.2 Set A also contains words which are not considered auxiliary words, such as the unin- flected loan-word metro ('subway, underground'). It goes without saying that in amor- phic languages all words are amorphic. Revzin proposes to eliminate words of the metro type through the definition of set AP of properly amorphic words which contains the amorphic words which are S-domi- nated by no more than one word from each paradigm:3 A/&gt;= {w'we A A A A (w'-+wAw"-+w)=*{?{w')?iP(w")Vw' = w")} (3.1.6.9) u&gt;'eW u/'eW The word metro is excluded from AP because it is dominated by more than one word from the same paradigm, e.g. by otcú ('father, dative') and otcóm ('father, instrumen- tal').4 Revzin mentions conjunctions as examples of properly amorphic words, such as / ('and') and /// Cor'). The second auxiliary definition determines a class G of words which are the only members of their families. These words are labelled purely paradigmatic by Marcus5 and absolutely grammaticalized (predel'no grammatikalizovannyj) by Revzin.6 G= {w'we WAF(iy)= {w}} (3.1.6.10) It is obvious that G contains classifiers irrespective of their semantic treatment: each classifier has a special distribution and makes up its own family. Class G will also con- tain prepositions occurring in strong government expressions, such as vliját* na, since strong government secures a unique context for such prepositions. Revzin mentions personal pronouns as examples of absolutely grammaticalized words, such as já CD and ty ('you'), in view of their unique occurrence in conjunction with verb forms of the present tense, which is inflected for person and number: (3/1/6/3) Já idú; ty idea'; on id«. 'I go; you go; he goes' 1 E.g. Marcus 1967a (2.3): 48; Revzin 1967b (5.30): 113. 2 Note that the relative distribution of vo and v cannot be fully accounted for in morphonological terms: vo dvoré ('in the court1) but v dveri ('in the door')). See §5.22 for details on this question. 3 Revzin 1967b (5.30): 114. 4 See Fig. 2.2.18.1. 5 Marcus 1967a (2.4): 48. 6 Revzin 1967b (5.30): 114.</page><page sequence="469">CHAPTER 3. 1: PARTS OF SPEECH 447 Revzin introduces two definitions of auxiliary words on the basis of KP and G. Set Aux of auxiliary words contains both properly amorphic and absolutely grammaticalized words:1 AUX = APUG (3.1.6.11) This definition is obviously too weak. For amorphic languages, the complete set of words will be auxiliary since every word is the only word in its paradigm and cannot be dominated by two words from the same paradigm. Furthermore, the personal pro- nouns mentioned above will be considered auxiliary words, which seems counter-in- tuitive and contradicts Revzin's semantic definition of words with a full meaning which is quoted above. Revzin's second definition determines set Aaux of absolutely auxiliary (predeVno sluiebnyj) words: words which are both properly amorphic and absolutely grammati- calized:2 Aoux = APnG (3.1.6.12) This definition gets rid of the disadvantages of the definition of Aux. Set Aaux contains conjunctions (i, ///), prepositions (at least na) and classifiers (which suggests that the condition that auxiliary words be amorphic is superfluous) and excludes personal pro- nouns, which are not amorphic. Furthermore, Aaux contains words which traditionally do not belong here. Revzin's example zámuz, which is part of the collocation vyjti zámu¿ ('marry'; etymologically 'go out behind husband'3), can be removed if we con- sider it to belong to the paradigm of zámuzem ('married'; etymologically 'located be- hind husband'). But it can be replaced by other nouns such as baklúSi, the use of which is entirely limited to the set expression bit1 baklúèi ('twiddle one's thumbs', lit. 'beat "baklúSi"'). This is not blatantly counter-intuitive: one can hardly classify baklúSi as a word with a full meaning. On the other hand, one cannot attribute the meaning of bit* baklúSi to bit 'either. To at least some speakers of Russian the paradigm of baklúSi is restricted to one word.4 Whether it belongs to Aaux depends on the existence or non-existence of some other word which would occur only in fixed expressions with the verb bit', and would, for that reason, be contained in the family of baklúSL If there be such a word, baklúèi turns into a word with a full meaning. This is one of the weaknesses of this model of auxiliary words: the membership of Aaux depends on the marginal properties of a lan- guage. The baklúSi case raises the question of redundant membership of Aaux, but there are also instances of words which one would intuitively expect to belong to Aaux but are absent from it. Set Aaux does not contain v, which fails to be amorphic if vo is in- cluded in its paradigm, or õtóby and dtob (variants of a conjunction meaning 'so as to', 1 Revzin 1967b (5.30): 115. 2 Revzin 1967b (5.30): 115. 3 Cf. the symmetry example in § 1.1.8. 4 The present writer's informant belongs to this group.

Thus, auxiliary words can only be approximated in models which are based on % Since the defining of auxiliary words must precede the J^-based models of 'part of speech1, these models cannot be maintained without alteration of the base component. In the last section of this chapter, a suggestion to that effect will be presented. S 3.1.7 Revzin's elementary T-categories and hypertypes: discussion Just like the class systems which have been derived from S-dominance for word forms, the existence of words which are admitted only by the empty context (or words which are admitted by all contexts) may be a blow to elementary T-categories and hypertypes. If the distribution of such interjections as Russian po¿álujsta! ('please!') is restricted to the empty context,1 its (one-member) paradigm will dominate all words with paradigms containing a word which can occur as a separate sentence. As a re- sult, Russian verbs and nominais will be united into a single elementary T-category or hypertype. S 3.1.8 The correspondence between occurrences of words and lexi- cal meanings The representation of the meaning of a phrase by means of P-images implies several constraints on the properties of possible languages. The most obvious constraint is that of linear order, which will be discussed in Chapter 3.4. This section discusses another constraint to which P-images are implicitly subject: one-to-one correspon- dence between token word forms (words3&gt; and token lexical meanings (words6&gt;. The set-theoretical approach to morphosyntactic categories is based on an implicit difference between two kinds of values or meanings (znaõenie means 'meaning' as well as 'value'): lexical meanings and grammatical values. The models based on fy presup- pose that grammatical values can be calculated from the lexical meanings but they also imply the assumptions that every word has a lexical meaning and that every lexi- cal meaning correponds to a word. The baklúSi example shows that the latter assump- tion is unwarranted, but Revzin's main problem is the former assumption. Assuming that there are such things as grammatical values, there is, a priori, no reason why their occurrence should be restricted to words which also carry lexical meanings. In fact, in the first quotation in the preceding section, Revzin indicates a difference be- tween words with a full meaning and auxiliary words, but he does not take the obvious step and allow this state of affairs in his model. As discussed in §3.0.12, assigning paradigms to each word implies the assignment of meanings to each word: in such cir- cumstances one can hardly expect to find words without meanings. The simple solu- tion for the problem of auxiliary words is to abandon one-to-one correspondence between words3 and words6 in base component %¿b and, consequently, abandon the condition that P be a partition in %¿. Thus, only one lexical meaning is left to be de- noted for bit' baklúSí 1 Cf. §2.2.25.</page><page sequence="471">CHAPTER 3.1: PARTS OF SPEECH 449 This implies for the Indonesian classifiers discussed in §3.1.6 that they have no lexical meanings. Having no lexical meaning, the classifier orang is not present in the P-image of a phrase and is not subject to a classification into parts of speech. Similar considerations also apply to the Russian prepositions v(vo) and na. This is not to say that prepositions never have a lexical meaning: in the phrase (3/1/8/1) knigana stole 'the book on the table' the preposition na has a clear-cut lexical meaning: 'on top of. But the presence of a lexical meaning can be disputed in instances of strong prepositional government, which are exactly the instances that cause the difficulties for the classification of prepositions in one part of speech, such as vliját' na in example (3.1.3.7). It may seem artificial to split na into two homonyms, one of which has an empty meaning, but the practice is entirely parallel to a rather acceptable treatment of the classifiers: orang is split into a noun meaning 'man' and a classifier for which a zero lexical meaning is denoted. Such semantic neutralization is intuitively more satisfacto- ry than the introduction of CLASSIFIER' as a separate lexical meaning. The zero meaning and neutralization option will not be worked out formally here; the material which is discussed in the following chapters enables us to ignore the consequences of the one-to-one correspondence constraint. The constraint will be discussed in Chap- ter 3.4.</page><page sequence="472">CHAPTER 3.2: TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS §3.2.1 The set-theoretical approach to 'gender' The models of gender' which are treated in this chapter are closely related to the models of 'part of speech treated in the preceding chapter, both types deriving word classes on the basis of their distribution. But, whereas the models of part of speech take the distribution of lexical items into account, irrespective of the morphological differences among the words in the phrases, the models of this chapter take the mor- phological identities of words into account as well. The models of 'gender1 evolved out of attempts to model 'part of speech. The early models, which occupy a transitional space between the two concepts, will also be dis- cussed.1 All models in this chapter are based on the following general properties of 'gender'. 1 The gender of a word w usually influences the morphological composition of the words which are syntactically connected with it. The masculine noun dorn Chouse') occurs in the context (Knóvyj) (3.2.1.1) 'new (masculine)' But the feminine word iena ('wife') requires a different form of nóvyj fnew') and oc- curs in the context (Knóvaja) (3.2.1.2) 'new (feminine)' This implies that it is the actual morphological form of the context which is rele- vant to the determination of the gender of a word: not the P-image of a context. Therefore, the family concept, which reflects the distribution of words in formal (word3&gt; contexts, is employed in the models in this chapter. 2 'Gender' is a property of lexical items: words sharing the same lexical meaning are supposed to belong to the same gender. The gender of the nominative oknó ('window') must not be different from that of the genitive okná. Therefore, the con- cept of paradigm, which unites the words sharing the same lexical meaning, is em- ployed in the models in this chapter. There are two ways in which the concepts of family and paradigm can be combined. 1 'Family' is defined on the basis of fli and the result is combined with the concept of paradigm, which is given. The combination is expressed as the union of the equiva- lence relations of family membership and paradigm membership. This practice is common to all gender models of this chapter except Mayoh's B-types (G16).2 2 A new definition of family is provided which utilizes the newly introduced concept of paradigm. Mayoh's model of 'B-type' is the only example of this. 1 This refers to G1, G2, G3 and G4 below. ¿ See §3.2.34. 450</page><page sequence="473">CHAPTER 3.2 TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 45 1 § 3.2.2 'Gender' and parts of speech The relation between models of "part of speech1 on the one hand and gender' and case1 on the other presents a deductive order problem. The labels of case1 and 'gender1 are traditionally reserved for certain parts of speech: nouns are said to be in a certain case, but verbs are not. But the models of part of speech1 in Chapter 3.1 do not derive nouns and verbs as such. The models de- fine part of speech', not specific parts of speech: the label part of speech is consid- ered an intensional label, whereas labels of individual parts of speech, such as noun and verb (but not auxiliary wordi, are extensional labels: the model does not determine their distribution, which usually proceeds language-specifically. It follows that models of case1 and gender' based on specific parts of speech cannot simply utilize the results of models of part of speech, even if the results of the latter models would be satisfactory. This induces us to consider the position of concepts such as 'noun' in the models of 'gender' and 'case. Here are some options. 1 'Gender' and case' are defined for specific parts of speech. The concepts noun, 'nominal, and others are not defined in the model but are added to the base compo- nent, which is consequently provisional. 2 The models of 'gender1 and case are applied to the complete set of words, i.e. to all parts of speech. If there are parts of speech other than nominais for which the models yield non-trivial results, we can: a acknowledge the existence of 'gender' and case1 in non-nominal parts of speech, or: b assign the labels case and gender, or their reality claims, only to (extensional) nominal parts of speech, such as noun' and adjective1. This implies that inten- sional label status is denied to 'case' and 'gender1: the distribution of these con- cepts is now at least partly determined by language-specific considerations. The concepts explicitly receive secondary intensional status.1 In this chapter, the choice among these options will be avoided. The models will define 'gender' for the complete set of words, but their results will be evaluated only as far as the traditional nominal words are concerned. S 3.2.3 V.A. Uspenskij's sections (G1) The first model to be treated is a straightforward combination of families and paradigms. It is based on a proposal from Revzin, but its oldest presentation is from V.A. Uspenskij, as a borderline instance between 'part of speech' and 'gender'.2 The union of two equivalence relations is a tolerance relation. Thus, if Ew is the equivalence relation 'occurs in the same contexts as' among words4, and P denotes the equivalence relation 'has the same meaning as1 among words4, a tolerance relation S can be defined S=EWUP (3.2.3.1) 1 Secondary intensional status: § 1.4.4. 2 Uspenskij, V.A., 1957: 25f. Cf. Revzin 1966b (4.27): 81.</page><page sequence="474">452 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS The classes which are directly determined by this relation are labelled sections (razdeV Thus, the section Gl(w) of a word w is defined as follows. Gl(w) = {w' | li/ G W A V A (lui G Ftwt-i) U Pdtfi-i) A W[ = lu A iün = w') } i¿&gt;l...u;n l&lt;i£n (3.2.3.2) The definition requires that each pair of elements in a section be mutually connected by a chain which consists of words, and in which consecutive elements share either their lexical meaning or their distribution. These chains will be referred to as PF- chains.2 Here is an example. Fig. 3.2.3.1 Pi P2 Fi [ Otéc LL1 syn J 'father'; 'son' F2 otcy L_1J synov'já ' 'fathers'; 'sons' Here synov'já belongs to G[(otéc) because synov'já and otéc are connected by PF- chain otéc - syn - synov'já (3.2.3.3) or by PF-chain otéc - otcy - synov'já (3.2.3.4) An example from written French: the contexts (ie beau, X) (3.2.3.5) 'the beautiful (masculine singular)' (la belle, X) (3.2.3.6) 'the beautiful (feminine singular)' (les beaux, ') (3.2.3.7) 'the beautiful (masculine plural)' (les belles, X) (3.2.3.8) 'the beautiful (feminine plural)' and the paradigms {père, pères} (3.2.3.9) 'father, fathers' {frère, frères} (3.2.3.10) 'brother, brothers' {mère, mères} (3.2.3.11) 'mother, mothers' {sœur, sœurs} (3.2.3.12) 'sister, sisters' yield the two sections: 1 Uspenskij, V.A., 1957: 24. ¿ Most investigators leave the chain unlabelled; Popescu [1972 ('l 132] uses chaînette.</page><page sequence="475">CHAPTER 3.2 TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 453 GKpère) = {père, pères, frère, frères} (3.2.3.13) GHmêre) = {mère, mères, sœur, sœurs} (3.2.3.14) as is illustrated in the following table.

The distribution of voix and nez differs from that of inflected words in that the former words take plural as well as singular agreement. Arbre is admitted by the context (ZU) (3.2.3.15) the' which excludes père and mère. Apart from these cases, sections apparently correspond to genders in written French. The Russian situation is different, which can be illustrated in the following figure. Fig. 3.2.3.3 P P Fi otéc 8 •father' F2 8 zená Vife1 F3 I otcy 1 zëny ' 'fathers'; 'wives' Zená belongs to GKotécì in view of the PF-chain otéc - otcy - ¿ëny - iena (3.2.3. 16) Thus, masculine and feminine nouns are united into one section: the absence of gen- der distinctions in plural agreement entails the unification of all Russian nouns into one section, with the exception of amorphic nouns such as metro ('subway'), which share neither distribution nor lexical meanings with inflected nouns. V.A. Uspenskij concludes that written French is a homogeneous language,2 at least with respect to its nouns, whereas Russian is not; he employs the criterion of homoge- neity as a basis for the typological comparison of languages.3 This view has been subject to modification: the fact that sections correspond to gender is not directly connected with homogeneity. The existence, for example, of a plurale tantum like fiançailles ('engagement') distorts the homogeneity of French with- out affecting the correspondence between genders and sections:4 this is shown in the following figure. 1 Amorphic words: §3.1.6. 2 Homogeneous language: §3.0.10. 3 Uspenskij, V.A., 1957: 24f. 4 Cf.

[ Since Pintóre) n Ft fiançailles) = { mères } * 0 (3.2.3. 17) and P(fiançailles) n F(mère) = 0 (3.2.3. 1 8) the language under consideration is not homogeneous. The validity of homogeneity as a typological criterion is also threatened by the existence of a word such as amour Clove'), which takes masculine agreement in the singular and feminine agreement in the plural: it establishes a PF-chain between mas- culine and feminine words and unites the two genders into one section. Even if one dispenses with amour by denoting different lexical meanings for the singular and plu- ral forms, the fact remains that the homogeneity status of a language is subject to denial through the existence of one anomalous word. If it is decided that one anomaly is not enough to shatter a model, it may be wondered how many words are needed. Words with masculine singulars and feminine plurals are more frequent but not really numerous in Italian; cf. il paio ('the pair1) and le paia ('the pairs'). But their number is considerable in Romanian.1 If homogeneity does not reflect a relevant property of a language, it does reflect a peculiarity of linguistic description: the love of linguists for pattern congruity. The non-homogeneity of Russian is considered a defect; V.A. Uspenskij proposes two remedies, which perpetuate the linguistic tradition to assign "hidden" or "dummy" cate- gories to certain words in certain contexts because other words express those cate- gories in those contexts. Thus, the word otcá ('father') is said to be in the accusative in the phrase (3/2/3/1) Já ljubljú otcá. 'I love (my) father' and in the genitive in the phrase (3/2/3/2) Eto dóm otcá. 'this is the house of the father' because other nouns, such as starSiná ('sergeant-major'), would express those cases. Compare: (3/2/3/3) Já ljubljú staráinú. 'I love the sergeant-major' (3/2/3/4) Ëto dorn starsiny. 'this is the house of the sergeant-major' 1 See §3.2.4.</page><page sequence="477">CHAPTER 3.2 TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 455 V.A. Uspenskij's first proposal to "homogenize" Russian introduces hidden genders in the plural. Thus, a plural adjective form is taken to represent different forms: instead of nóvye ('new, nominative plural'), a phrase is considered to contain nóvyem, nóvyen or nóvyef, according to the gender of the modified noun. V.A. Uspenskij virtually re- vives pre-revolutionary orthographical tradition, which prescribed the spelling nóvyja when the adjective was combined with the plural of a feminine or neuter noun and nóvye for the plural of masculine nouns. V.A. Uspenskij's first proposal achieves pattern congruity by splitting up tokens (words3). His second proposal splits up types (words^ by introducing dummy genders for singular nouns: the model accounts for non-existing feminine and neuter forms of masculine nouns. Thus, W contains górodn and górodf besides górodm ('town'). No false analyses will result, as górodn and górodf will simply never occur as tokens. Górodm will be analyzed as the masculine form of górod. V.A. Uspenskij's proposals can hardly be considered relevant for the modelling of 'gender1, because preliminary assignment of gender indicators to types and tokens implies that any definition of 'gender' based on them is circular. Another possibility, which was not considered by V.A. Uspenskij, is the manipulation of the lexical meanings, i.e. the paradigms, of the model. The concept of lexical mean- ing is based on Zaliznjak's distinction between grammatical and non-grammatical or properly nominative meanings: the lexical meaning of a word is its properly nominative meaning.1 But Zaliznjak also introduces the distinction between nominative and syn- tactic meaning.2 Comparison of these concepts and his examples shows that the only kind of meaning Zaliznjak considers grammatical (i.e. not properly nominative) and nominative (i.e. not syntactic) is number'. Zaliznjak's semantic conception will not be discussed in detail here,3 but see what happens when lexical meaning is identified with his nominative meaning instead of his properly nominative meaning, i.e. when number' is considered a part of the lexical meaning of a noun. In that case, the singular and the plural paradigms of a noun are split into separate words4 because the meanings CSING&gt; and CPLUR&gt; are denoted as parts of the lexical meaning: this produces, for example, the following words4. {górod, 'górod, SING&gt;) (3.2.3.19) 'town' {gorodá, &lt;górod, PLUR&gt;) (3.2.3.20) 'towns' This is not a novelty in Russian grammar, as will be pointed out in §3.3.14. The result is, for Russian, that masculine and feminine nouns are no longer connected by a PF- chain through the common families of their plural forms; also a separate section of plural forms appears, making up a plural "gender". But even then, the results are not entirely satisfactory: consider the following scheme, which contains masculine and neuter nouns. 1 Zaliznjak 1969 {11 50, 1967b (1.7): 28. 2 Zaliznjak 1969 (4) 46-47, 1967b (1.4): 23. 3 More details will be given in §4.6.43.</page><page sequence="478">456 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS Fig 3.2.3.5 P P Fi górod 8 'town, nominative or accusative' F2 8 oknô 'window, nominative or accusative* F3 górodü oknú 'town, dative1; 'window, dative' Thus, the masculine word górod and the neuter oknó are still connected, viz. by the PF-chain górod - górodu - oknú - oknó (3.2.3.20) so that masculine and neuter nouns belong to the same section. It follows that natural languages offer no immediate interpretation of the base component of a model which enables us to identify sections with genders in a non- trivial way: it is counterintuitive to include case meanings in the lexical meaning of a word. It is, however, possible to construct a model of case1 and to utilize the results in a model of 'gender'. This practice will be discussed in §3.2.12. But first, some minor modifications of the concept of section will be discussed. S 3.2.4 The Romanian gender problem The Romanian noun provides exemplification for the modifications which lead from the concept of section to the classic gender models of the Set-theoretical School. It was stated in §2.2.21 that the Romanian adjective inflects for masculine and feminine in both singular and plural. But many grammarians distinguish three genders in Roma- nian (abstracting from the singularia and pluralia tantum): 1 nouns which take feminine agreement on both singular and plural and are either animate or inanimate: casa Chouse'), nominative plural case; 2 nouns which take masculine agreement in singular and plural and denote either male living beings or inanimate objects: bärbat ('man'), plural bärbafi; pom ('tree'), plural pomi; 3 nouns which take masculine agreement in the singular and feminine agreement in the plural, and denote inanimate objects: scaun ('chair'), plural scaune. The third type has been the subject of a popular polemic in Romanian linguistics, the documentation of which would require a separate publication.1 The question is whether the third group presents a third gender, and if so, whether it can be called neuter. The answer to the first question hinges on the definition of gender', the an- swer to the second on the definition of neuter'. Most Romanian grammarians call 1 Even a list of relevant references would take too much space. The issue has been popular not only among specialists of Romanian, but also among European structuralists (Bazell, Jakobson, Togeby). HofejSi 1964 mentions many of the older contributions, the oldest of which is Graur 1928. But even nowadays rarely a year passes without two or three papers entitled "Encore le "neutre" en roumain" or the like. The amount of dispute on a limited body of relatively simple facts can perhaps be explained by the very simplicity of the facts, which provides an easy access to the Parnassus of theoretical verdicts, but also by the cultural and political significance of the relationship between Romanian and Latin. G. Weigand, in his review of the journal Dacoromânia, the title of which ralready represents a programme" [1926: 286], qualifies the at- tempts by the contributors to Dacoromânia to deny the impact of neighbouring languages on Romanian as latinomania [1926: 261; 1927: 3121 much to the satisfaction of the Marrists (cf. §0.6), who tended to view Romanian as a product of language crossing: cf.

S 3.2.5 Kulagina's K-classes (G2, G 3) Kulagina proposes a first modification of the section concept. She introduces classes? a term which is hardly distinctive in the present study. They are equivalent to Revzin's morphological classes;4 and will be referred to as K-classes. If K-classes are defined in terms of PF-chains, an auxiliary concept is needed.

In Fig. 3.2.4.1, it is obvious that n(pomi, case) = 5 (3.2.5.12) Both pomi and case are connected with scaun by PF-chains of length 3. Thus, in terms of PF-chains, G3 is defined as follows.

G^ = {pomi, barbati pom, bärbat, scaun, . . . } (3.2.6.3) G2 = {p°m&gt; barbai, scaun, scaune, . . . } (3.2.6.4) G^ - {scaun, scaune, case, . . .} (3.2.6.5) G} = {scaune, case, casa, . . .} (3.2.6.6) The important property by which 'section, 'K-class' and 'PS-class', concepts without reality claims, are distinguished from 'gender' is their splitting up paradigms. It is obvious that: - Gf splits up P(scaun); - G| splits up ?(pom) and Pibärbat); - Gì splits up P(casá); - Gj splits up ?(scaun). In grammatical practice, however, 'gender' is usually considered to encompass complete paradigms (even if it is not excluded that a complete paradigm belongs to two or more genders). This property will be secured for the classes in the models of the following sections. S 3.2.7 Marcus1 'concrete gender' (G5): presentation In his model of concrete gender,2 Marcus introduces three novelties with respect to the preceding models. 1 Revzin's proposal to limit the length of relevant PF-chains to 3 is applied to com- plete paradigms instead of individual words. Thus, for paradigms and families as in Fig. 3.2.3.5, oknú will no longer be in the same class with górodu as their paradigms contain words which can only be connected by a PF-chain longer than 3, viz. oknó and górod. 1 Revzin 1967b (4.26): 99. ¿ Marcus 1962a, Marcus 1963a, Marcus 1964, Marcus 1967a {4k 115-155, Marcus 1970 {4&gt;. 156-207.</page><page sequence="482">460 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS 2 Marcus provides a model of specific genders as well as of 'gender*. In order to de- fine the masculine gender and the feminine gender, he implicitly employs an un- named auxiliary concept, which will be identified by Revzina, who calls it semantic specimen (semantiõeskij predstaviteÏÏ.1 As the function will turn up in other models without its having a semantic origin, and its impact is not restricted to determining the category of which it is a specimen, this study will employ the more general term catalyst. 3 Marcus' concrete genders make up a partition (although it is a secondary one: the nucleus partition of a system of tolerance classes). In each language as defined by base component JÍ2, catalyst status is assigned to some words. The discussion on the methodological status of this device is postponed for the moment.2 A word w belongs to the catalyst class C(c) of a catalyst c if each word in the paradigm of w can be connected with each word of the paradigm of c by a PF-chain of three or fewer links: C(c) = {w'weW A A A n(w' c') * 3 } (3.2.7.1) w'e ?{w) c'e ?{c) Or, avoiding the concept of PF-chain: C(c) = { ™ I ^ e W A A A (Phi/) n F(c') * 0 V P(c') n F(u/) * 0) } (3.2.7.2) w' 6 P(iu) c' e P(c) In terms of K-classes, catalyst class C(c) is defined as follows. C(c)={w'weWA A we G2(C) } (3.2.7.3) c'e P(c) Marcus assigns two catalysts to his model, which can be labelled m and /. The cata- lyst classes C(m) and C(/) make up a system of tolerance classes over W. The nucleus partition3 which can be derived from this system of tolerance classes contains a maximum of four subsets. Marcus labels these subsets genders: each language has the following genders. G5m= {w'weW Awe C(m) A w e Cif)} (3.2.7.4) G5f= {w'weW Awe dm) Aw e (if)} (3.2.7.5) G^={ií;|ií;gWAiü^ C(m) Awe Cif)} (3.2.7.6) &amp;c= {w'weV(Awe C(m) A w e C(f)} (3.2.7.7) Of course, certain genders can be empty for certain values of the base component. It is not true that two words which belong to the same (concrete) gender can be connected by a PF-chain of three words or less, as Marcus suggests.4 Longer PF- 1 Revzina 1966 (2a): 85. 2 I.e. until §3.2.10. 3 Nucleus partition: §1.1.15. 4 E.g.

Compare the following scheme. Fig. 3.2.7.1 Pi P2 P3 Fi[ w' ... c ] F2 ' c' ... w2 1 Here both w' and w2 belong to the gender of catalyst c, although n{wh w2) = 4 (3.2.7.8) Such situations occur if w ' is a singulare tantum, a noun which posseses only singular forms, and w2 is a plurale tantum, possessing only plural forms. Compare also the Rus- sian word mglá ('haze'), which has no genitive plural, and drovéc ('firewood'), which has only a genitive plural. PF-chains of infinite length can occur within G^. Consider, for example: Fig. 3.2.7.2 Pi P2 P3 P4 Fil m f ' F2 1 wi 1 Here both w' and w2 belong to G^ because: wi £ C(m) u C(/) Au)2i dm) u C(f) (3.2.7.9) However, there is no PF-chain connecting ix^i and w2, so, by convention, n(iülf w2) = 00 (3.2.7.10) As we shall see, such infinite distances between nouns can be assumed for Italian.1 Marcus defines m as representing the "prototype" of the natural masculine gender.2 Catalyst m is a noun3 explicitly referring to a male person, "such as man in English". Catalyst / is defined as the prototype of the natural feminine gender: woman in English. Concrete gender G^ is consequently identified with the masculine grammatical gender; concrete gender G} with the feminine gender, and G^ with the neuter gender. The words in G^, i.e. in the union of C(m) and C(A were identified by Marcus at a later stage, and are considered to be of the double gender. For some languages, the term common gender is more appropriate. 1 See Fig. 3.216.1 for the eventual situation established for Italian. 2 E.g.

Let m = man and / = woman. Since m and / occur in the same contexts, and this also applies to their plural forms, it follows that, for all forms m' of m and f of /, n(m',/'U3 (3.2.8.1) The PF-chain which connects the forms of any other noun, say book, with m' or /', contains three or fewer links. Thus, all English nouns end up in one double gender class (G51 Compare the following scheme. Fig. 3.2.8.1 P P P FiS man woman book Fare men ' women ' books 2 Consider Spanish. Let m = varón f man') and / = mujer Cwoman'). We find that V V n(m',/')&gt;3 (3.2.8.2) m'ePím) fe ?{f) In fact this statement applies to any elements of P(m) and Of).

Compare the following table. Fig. 3.2.8.2 P(m) P P ?(f) Fej varón libro 8 8 F ¡os varones libros # 8 F/a 8 0 casa mujer Fias 8 0 casas mujeres It follows that Spanish has a masculine gender G^ which contains varón and libro, and a G^ which contains mujer and casa, but no neuter gender and no common or double gender (i.e. G^ = 0and G5c=8).2 1 E.g. Marcus 1967a (4.3): 1 18ff. ¿ This observation ceases to be correct if certain substantivized adjectives are regarded as separate nouns. Bueno ('good') can be employed as a noun ('the good'). It is then preceded by a special "neuter" definite arti- cle lo, which does not occur with ordinary nouns.

Let m = man ('man') and / = vrouw ('woman'). Assume that phrases (3/2/8/1) to (3/2/8/6) below are correct:1 (3/2/8/1) de oude man 'the old man' (3/2/8/2) een oude man 'an old man' (3/2/8/3) de oude vrouw 'the old woman' (3/2/8/4) een oude vrouw 'an old woman' (3/2/8/5) de oude mannen 'the old men' (3/2/8/6) de oude vrouwen 'the old women' We then find that: A A n(m'fU3 (3.2.8.4) m'eP(m) fe?{f) Other words are either connected with the forms of both m and / by a PF-chain of three or fewer links (e.g. tafel 'table') or they are not connected with the forms of either m or / by such a chain (e.g. boek, 'book'): A ( A A A (n(m',wU3An(f'wU3) weW w'ePiw) m'ePím) fe P(f) V V V V (n(m&gt;1&gt;3An(f&gt;")&gt;3)) (3.2.8.5) w" e ?{w) m" e P(m) f e ?{f) Compare: (3/2/8/7) de oude tafel 'the old table' (3/2/8/8) een oude tafel 'an old table' (3/2/8/9) de oude tafels 'the old tables' (3/2/8/10) het oude boek 'the old book' (3/2/8/11) een oud boek 'an old book' (3/2/8/12) de oude boeken 'the old books' 1 The correctness of the Dutch phrases in this section applies only to the stylistically unmarked variety of northern standard Dutch. In the South, het oud boek occurs besides (3/2/8/10) (at least in idiolects in which boek is neuter, as in the standard language). As southern speech enjoyed a high status for centuries, the southern variety is used in the North in certain circumstances: set expressions of an official nature, comparative degrees, multi-syllable adjectives, etc.</page><page sequence="486">464 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS It follows that Dutch has two genders: the double or common gender G5C, containing man, vrouw and taf el and the neuter gender G^, containing boek. Compare the fol- lowing table. Fig. 3.2.8.3 P P P P Yddeen man vrouw tafel 0 F de mannen vrouwen tafeis boeken Fhet/een I 0 I 0 I 0 1 boek ~ Similar results are obtained for Danish and Swedish. 4 Consider Romanian. Let m = bärbat ('man') and / = femeie ('woman'). Statement (3.2.8.2) applies to Romanian as well as Spanish: catalysts m and / do not belong to the same gender, which entails the existence of a masculine gender G5m and a femi- nine gender G^. Gender G^ contains barbai, it also contains pom:1 all forms of pom can be connected with all forms of bärbat by a PF-chain of three links or less. Gen- der G5f contains femeie, it also contains casa since all forms of casa can be con- nected with all forms of femeie by a PF-chain of three links or less. But there are words, such as scaun, which cannot be assigned to G5^ or G5m because their paradigms contain forms which cannot be connected to all forms of m by a PF- chain of three or fewer links, as well as forms which cannot be connected to all forms of / by a PF-chain of three or fewer links, i.e. V ( V V n(m',u/)&gt;3A V V n(/Mx/')&gt;3) (3.2.8.6) we W w'e Hw) m'e P(m) w"e ?{w) fe P(/) In the paradigm of scaun, the plural form scaune possesses the first property, while the singular form scaun possesses the second property. Consequently, scaun belongs to the neuter gender G5n. Thus, Marcus provides a concrete answer to the K-questions posed in §3.2.4. Compare the following scheme. Fig. 3.2.8.4 P(m) P P P P(/) Fmasculine plural bärbafi pomi 0 0 0 Fmasculine singular bärbat pom scaun 0 0 Ff eminine plural 0 8 scaune case femei Ff eminine singular | 0 1 0 | 0 | casä ' femeie~ 5 Consider Italian. Let m = uomo ('man') and / = donna ('woman'). Assume that alter- nations which can be described in morphonological terms can be ignored, so that, say, servo ('servant') and studente ('student') can be accommodated in one gender, in spite of phonologically conditioned -o which distinguishes the distributions of these words in (3/2/8/13) un servo 'a servant' (3/2/8/14) uno studente 'a student' 1 For pom, scaun, and casä, cf. §3.2.4.</page><page sequence="487">CHAPTER 3.2: TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 465 Then at first sight, the Italian situation is very much like the Spanish one: consider the position of libro ('book') and casa ('house') in Fig. 3.2.8.5. Statement (3.2.8.2) applies to Italian as well as to Spanish and Romanian: Italian possesses a masculine gender G5m containing uomo and libro and a feminine gender G^ containing donna and casa. Marcus mentions the existence of words like giovane ('youngster'), which take both masculine and feminine agreement, depending on the sex of the referent. Kigiovane) contains:1 (vecchio, X) (3.2.8.7) 'old (masculine singular)1 and (vecchia, ') (3.2.8.8) 'old (feminine singular)' This distinguishes it from Kiuomo), which does not contain (3.2.8.8), and Kidonna), which does not contain (3.2.8.7). Thus, giovane € F(uomo) A giovane £ F(donna) (3.2.8.9) which implies that (3.2.8.6) applies to Italian as well as Romanian. In fact, if w = gio- vane, then n(m' w') and n(f' w") are infinite for all values of w' w'' m' and /'. As a consequence, giovane is classified as a neuter (G5n) noun. Marcus could have men- tioned similar nouns for Spanish (e.g. estudiante 'student'). He does not mention, for Italian, another type of neuter: Italian possesses several nouns which present a complete parallel to the Romanian neuters by having masculine agreement in singu- lar and feminine agreement in plural. An example is il paio ('the pair'), plural le paia. Marcus' model of concrete gender1 accommodates both types in the same neuter gender, G^, although their positions are obviously quite different.

Let m = homme ('man') and / = femme ('woman'). Fig. 3.2.8.6 shows that (3.2.8.2) applies to French. French possesses a masculine gender G^ which contains homme and a feminine gender G5f which contains femme. Most nouns are masculine or feminine (again, ignoring morphonological, or rather mor- phographological phenomena). Marcus mentions two types of neuters. a Nouns of the type of élève ('pupil'), which are comparable with Italian giovane. b Nouns which syncretize singular and plural, such as voix (Voice1) and nez Cnose'), which were discussed in §3.2.3. These words share no families with homme and 1 The set Khv) of contexts which admit a word w was defined in (2.23.1).</page><page sequence="488">466 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS femme because the latter nouns take either singular or plural agreement, whereas the former take both.

The inclusion of these nouns adds to the heterogeneity of the neuter. The model classifies traditionally masculine nouns (such as nez) and feminine nouns (such as voix) as neuters only because they syncretize singular and plural. Marcus states that these discrepancies can be removed once the sample of phrases is expanded beyond the limited set which is implicitly employed (viz. nouns with modifiers),1 but it is not clear how this result can be achieved: one of the conditions for nez and homme to be united into the same family is their interchangeability in all contexts. If, for a given set of phrases, there is a context x which does admit nez but does not admit homme, one can only hope that expansion of the set of phrases will one day provide a compatible pair2 (x, homme) (3.2.8.10) But it is also possible to establish an expanding set of non-grammatical phrases, and once (3.2.8.10) is found in that set, there is no point in expanding the set of grammatical phrases: phrases cannot be both grammatical and ungrammatical. In fact the combinations of nouns and modifiers on which Marcus' observations are based provide a context (petits, ') (3.2.8.11) 'small (masculine plural)' Context (3.2.8.1 1) yields grammatical compatible pair (3.2.8.12) and non-grammatical compatible pair (3.2.8.13), which prevents nez and homme from ending up in the same family: (petits nez) (3.2.8.12) '(petits homme) (3.2.8. 13) This result cannot be undone by expansion of the set of phrases, but only by changing grammaticality judgements. 1 Marcus 1967a (4.3* 122. z Compatible pair, see §2.3.9.</page><page sequence="489">CHAPTER 3.2: TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 467 7 Consider Latin. Let m = vir ('man') and / = mulier ('woman'). Observation (3.2.8.2) applies to Latin: m and / belong to different concrete genders. Hence Latin pos- sesses a masculine gender G5m and a feminine gender G5^. There is a word w, say w = tempus ('time'), containing forms which can be connected with all forms of m and / only by a PF-chain containing more than three links; this implies that statement (3.2.8.6) holds for Latin and furnishes this language with a neuter gender G5n. The neuter gender also contains words such as civis ('civilian') which takes masculine and feminine agreement, like Italian giovane. Marcus points to the noun capra ('she-goat'): its paradigm contains caprœ, a syncretized form of the genitive and dative singular1 which shares no family with any form of mulier, as the latter noun distinguishes a genitive mulieris and a dative mulieri. This implies that nicaprae, mulieris) = 4 (3.2.8. 14) The situation is illustrated in the following table. Fig. 3.2.8.7 P P(/) Ffem sing nom capra mulier Ffem sing gen 0 mulieris Ffem sing gen + dat caprœ 0 Ffem sing dat 0 mulieri Ffem sing ace capvam mulierem Marcus' concludes that "despite common intuition and traditional grammar, capra is not a feminine noun."2 It is interesting to see that, if Marcus would have considered / = f emina ('woman'), which inflects like capra, the noun capra would have been feminine and mulier would have been neuter because nifeminae, mulieris) &gt; 3 (3.2.8. 1 5) Similar instances of case syncretism also distort the picture for German and Rus- sian.3 The problem will be returned to when Revzin's gender model (G10) is dis- cussed.4 Note that, among the examples given so far, all languages which distinguish a mascu- line and a feminine gender have no double gender words, and that nouns which are intuitively or traditionally attributed to this class are assigned to the neuter gender. This applies not only to fuzzy gender words of the type adduced by Kiefer,5 but also 1 The nominative plural meaning of caprae is not taken into consideration. 2 Marcus 1967a (4.3): 120. There is an incorrect Latin PF-chain *dies - diem - rem in Marcus 1967a {4.2}. 1 17 and 1970 (4.2): 158 (replace dies by fades and diem by faciem), and a printing error in Marcus 1970 (4.3): 163, line 3 from the bottom: mulleres must be mulieris. 3 There is an incorrect German PF-chain *Knabe - Knaben - Vätern - Vater in Marcus 1967a (4.3): 122 and Marcus 1970 (4.3): 1 16. 4 See §3.2.19. 0 In 1968 (2.6): 41, Kiefer adduces German fuzzy gender words to show the inadequacy of Marcus' model: German Dschungel ('jungle') can be masculine {der Dschungel}, neuter {das DschungeD or feminine {die Dschungeh. Such instances seem rather marginal. Since the flection of Dschungel differs according to the gender to which it is assigned, it is reasonable to assume that we are dealing here with different words4</page><page sequence="490">468 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS to nouns which are commonly described as common gender words and denote living beings of either gender (Russian sirotá ('orphan'), Italian giovane, French e7ève). But an empty G^ is no mathematical necessity in languages which distinguish a masculine and a feminine gender. Revzina criticizes Marcus' model for allowing Russian nouns to end up in two genders, while rin natural languages a noun occurrence belongs to one, and only one, gender".1 8 The Russian nouns in question are the pluralia tantum, which the model assigns to the double gender G5C. If m = muzõína fman') and / = ¿énSõina ('woman'), and if ob- servations are restricted to forms of the nominative case, the following situation is obtained. (Molodozëny 'newly-weds' is a plurale tantum; õudóviãde 'monster' is neuter; sirotá 'orphan' is a common-gender noun). Fig. 3.2.8.8 P(m) P ?{f) P P Fmasc sing nom mucina ti ti ti ti Fpiur nom muSöiny molodoïëny zénSõiny oudóviSõa siróty Ff em sing nom 0 0 ¿énãõina ti ti Fneut sing nom 0 0 0 dudóviSde ti Fmasc + fern sing nom 1 0 1 0 | 0 1 0 1 Sirotá In the given representation of Russian, masculine and feminine make up different G5-genders because: n(m,/) = 4 (3.2.8.16) But molodoZëny is connected with all forms of both muiöina and ¿énSõina by a PF- chain of three elements or less. Consequently, molodoiëny belongs in G5C One way of dispensing with false neuters such as giovane, élève, estudiante and sirotá is to regard them as instances of syncretism, i.e. as syncretic counterparts of pairs such as Italian ragazzo ('boy') : ragazza ('girl'), French étudiant ('male student') : étudiante ('female student'), Spanish muchacho ('boy') : muchacha ('girl'), or Russian suprúg ('husband') : suprúga ('wife'). If the members of these pairs are considered dif- ferent words, giovane, élève, etc. can be considered homonyms of the lexical mean- ings cmale youngster' and cf emale youngster», etc., which determine masculine and feminine paradigms. But if ragazzo and ragazza, etc., are considered elements of the same paradigm we find a large class of double gender words. Giovane, etc. will be in- stances of syncretism of the male and female forms of a paradigm, which is compara- ble to the syncretism of singular and plural in re and radio and the syncretism of genitive and dative in caprae.2 As pointed out above, Marcus does not provide a solu- tion for instances of syncretism. with partly overlapping words2- Or they can be removed from the material as instances of idiolectal and register variation which should be described in sociolinguistic terms: within each linguistic system Ä2 as determined by a combination of values on sociolinguistic parameters, there is only one value for the gender of Dschungel. 1 Revzina 1966 (2): 84. 2 This treatment is proposed by Zaliznjak: see §3.2.25.</page><page sequence="491">CHAPTER 3.2- TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 469 9 Finally, consider the Indonesian example of §2.2.5. Let m = laki ('husband, man') and / = wanita ('woman'). Laki and wanita belong to the family of mahasiswa, being ad- mitted by contexts with the classifier orang.1 Consider: (3/2/8/15) Saya ambii laki dua orang. 'I take man two classifier MAN1, i.e. 'I take two men' (3/2/8/16) Saya ambii wanita dua orang. 'I take woman two classifier MAN1, i.e. 'I take two women1 Assuming that P coincides with the unit partition in Bahasa Indonesia, it can be concluded that the catalyst classes of m and / must coincide with their families: laki, wanita and mahasiswa belong to the same, double, gender G5C. All other noun families are not connected with m or / by a PF-chain (i.e. by a PF-chain of inif inite length: assuming that Indonesian is an amorphic language, PF-chains coincide with F-chains, which are only two links long). It follows that all noun families except F(mahasiswa) are united into one neuter G5-gender. Even if one argues that South-East-Asian word-classes and Indo-European genders are not the same thing and that a model of 'gender' is not supposed to yield word classes, the fact remains that a model of 'gender' does yield for Indonesian non-trivial results which do not tally with intuition and tradition. If a language does not possess a grammatical category X, the model of X must yield trivial results for that language. If the results are not trivial, either our opinion of the language concerned must be re- vised and the existence of X must be acknowledged, or the model must be rejected. S 3.2.9 Marcus1 gender typology Marcus' model of 'concrete gender' will be discussed in §3.2.10; first, a short account is given of his typological proposals based on the model. The length of (minimal) PF-chains can be used as a measure of distance between genders. The numbers can be employed as typological indices. The index is the num- ber d of links in the longest minimal PF-chain which connects two elements of the paradigms of two words. For a formal definition, set NP(w', W2) of minimal PF-chains connecting the forms of the paradigms of w' and w2 is defined: NP(wh w2)= {JV|JVC//*(W)A V V N=N(w',u/2)} (3.2.9.1) Subsequently, subset ZXu&gt;i, w2) of maximal minimal PF-chains in NP(w'y w2) is defined ¡Xwu W2)={N'NZ NP(wh w2)A A A n(v) á n{V) } (3.2.9.2) ve NP[w',W2) v'eN The unique number d(iui, w2) of elements in the PF-chains in ZXu/, w") is the distance between w' and w2.2 The distance between words of the same paradigm equals 2. The distance between two different words within the same gender is 3 for G5m, G^ and G^., 1 Cf. (2.3.5.7). ¿ The system of quantification given here is that of Marcus 1962a (9): 109-1 1 1.

The distance between masculine and feminine is 6 for Romanian, in view of the PF-chain2 barbati - bärbat - scaun - scaune - femei - femeie (3.2.9.5) which yields dim, f) = dibärbat, femeie) = 6 (3.2.9.6) The distance between masculine and feminine is infinite in French since there is no PF-chain which connects homme and femme.3 The same is reported for Italian: Mar- cus ignores nouns of the paio group, which reduces the distance between masculine and feminine from °° to 6: cf. the PF-chain4 uomini - uomo - paio - paia - donne - donna (3.2.9.7) He probably considers the paio group too small to be significant: in a similar manner, he explicitly leaves out of consideration three French words iamour, 'love1; délice, 'delight'; orgue, 'organ'), which behave like Romanian scaun and Italian paioP This il- lustrates one of the flaws of this way of establishing typologies: there seems to be lit- tle point in explicit quantification of distances if it is posterior to so much implicit quantification. The French and Italian "neuter" nouns make up limited, non-productive groups which are, respectively, infinitesimal and small. But the productivity of the Romanian neuter is also reported to be coming to an end: new words are assigned to the masculine and formerly neuter words have moved to the masculine.6 Thus, an im- 1 Cf. §3.2.7. 2 Cf.

Of course amour hardly counts, in view of the additional semantic difference between singular and plural: 'love* as against 'female lovers'. 6 The observation that f"the neuter is beginning to lose ground to the masculine" is made in the Romanian Academy Grammar [Graur &amp; al. 19662a (57): 57]. But the present writer's impression is that the "neuter" is the more productive of the two. Most Romanian masculines belong to a limited number of semantically definable domains: they comprise (besides persons) trees, mountains, coins, etc. [cf. HofejSí 1964 (2): 406]. All examples mentioned in the Academy Grammar to illustrate the shift toward the masculine (for both new and existing words) are related to the same register of technical terms: e.g. coeficient, 'coefficient'; typi- cally, element is usually "neuter" but becomes masculine as, say, an element of a central heating system). So what may actually be going on is that another semantic domain is being added to the masculine while "neuter" remains the default gender for inanimate nouns. This assumption is supported by a Romanian va- riety of Z-phrases. Not only do "neuter" nouns, which take masculine agreement in the singular, take fem- inine agreement when co-ordinated- (3/2/9/ 1 ) Parcul si lacul sunt frumoase.

Within the philosophy of the model, there is a serious objection to its present use for typology. The typology is based on an implicit constraint which stipulates that the distance between two words i^i and W2 is identical for any pair of words from the gen- ders of w' and u&gt;2- This is not necessarily true if neuter (or double gender) nouns are involved. Consider the Italian "neuters" paio and giovane. d(paio, uomo) = dipaio, donna) = 4 (3.2.9.8) d(giovane, uomo) = d(giovane, donna) = oo (3.2.9.9) In this case, it is impossible to determine unequivocally the distance between the neuter gender and the masculine and feminine genders. §3.2.10 Marcus1 concept of catalyst Revzina considers the introduction of semantically motivated catalysts ^extremely es- sential" because it reveals the distinction between gender and animacy, and because it enables the identification of corresponding genders in different (Slavic) languages, which is necessary for their typological comparison.1 The Indonesian example in §3.2.8 suggests that the heterogeneity of the neuter gender is caused by Marcus' limiting the number of catalysts in the model to two (viz. m and /). This supplies languages with a maximum of four genders, whereas intuitively some languages may have developed more such classes. It is, of course, a different question whether those classes can still be called genders. But intuition tells us that some languages possess more of whatever the model purports to define. Revzina points out that the model in principle allows for any number of catalysts for each language,2 but this only draws our attention to the uncertain methodological status of the concept. It is not immediately clear where catalysts come from. They are not explicitly in- cluded in base component % In Marcus 1962a, m and / are defined as semantically masculine and semantically feminine words.3 But the base component does not contain semantically masculine or feminine words. The base component contains semantic units, viz. lexical meanings which determine paradigms. Certain lexical meanings (in fact any lexical meanings) can be labelled cman&gt; and 'woman*. But these labels are ex- tensional, i.e. are assigned language-specifically. The base component as a definition of language does not stipulate the presence of the lexical meanings cman&gt; and but even masculine nouns denoting objects, which take masculine agreement in plural, take feminine agreement in these circumstances: (3/2/9/2) Muntele si codrul sunt frumoase. 'the mountain (masculine) and the forest (masculine) are beautiful (feminine)' (The latter example is from Bazell 1952: 81, where it is used to prove a different point.) If "neuter" is in fact the default gender for inanimate objects in Romanian, Marcus has a point here. 1 Revzina 1966 (2a): 85. 2 Revzina 1966 (2a): 85. 3 Marcus 1962a (6): 105.</page><page sequence="494">472 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS vornan', nor does it presuppose common properties of these labels when they are employed in different languages. Marcus' introduction of m and / in fact entails a universal referential representa- tion of the lexicon for all languages, in which 'male' and 'female1 are intensional labels. Now let it be assumed that the base component is altered so as to make a similar rep- resentation possible. It then turns out that 'typically male" and 'typically female1 do not serve to distinguish even masculine and feminine. Even leaving aside the fact that in a possible majority of languages the words denoting 'man' also mean 'human being' and in that quality refer to women also (cf. also 'boy' and 'child'), there are many languages in which masculine and neuter nouns denote typically female human beings. Compare: 1 Romanian masculine baboi fold woman'); 2 Old English masculine wJfmon ('woman'); 3 German neuters Weib ('woman') and Mädchen ('girl'). The latter word has even at- tracted towards the neuter a group of loanwords which denote young women: das Gogo-girl Conversely, feminine nouns may denote masculine human beings. Compare: 4 French feminine sentinelle ('sentry'); 5 German feminine Rothaut ('redskin'); 6 Italian feminine guida ('guide'). (Note that the examples of the latter group are not symmetrical to those of the first group: examples 4, 5 and 6 do not exclude reference to women, whereas examples 1, 2 and 3 exclude reference to men. The present writer has not succeeded in finding ex- act feminine counterparts to examples of the first group. The widespread asymmetry in reference to men and women in the languages of the world does not seem to affect the present issue, which pertains to defining gender* in all possible languages: a sym- metrical language is possible.) Marcus warns us not to take Weib as a catalyst,1 but he does not tell us how to select the correct feminine noun. His instruction in fact introduces circularity into the model: only feminine nouns can be used to define feminine nouns. This will apply a for- tiori if new catalysts are introduced in order to distinguish various kinds of neuters. Their selection is necessarily language-specific (and less likely to be rooted in some universal semantic representation). The conclusion is, and has been, that the concept of catalyst must be modified or abandoned. The following sections discuss Horecky's model of 'gender', which employs a modified catalyst concept, and Marcus' model of 'abstract gender' and Revzin's model of 'gender', in which catalysts are abandoned and genders define themselves. In the latter models it is no longer attempted to define specific genders intensionally. S 3.2.11 The Polish and Slovak gender problem The material that Horecky uses to illustrate his model of 'gender' is taken from the West Slavic languages, the gender systems of which have been the subject of a num- ber of discussions. Polish, for example, is said to possess three, five, six or seven gen- 1 Marcus 1967a (4.2&gt;. 1 16.</page><page sequence="495">CHAPTER 3.2 TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 473 ders, depending on the linguist.1 The following presentation will focus on Slovak, with some reference to Polish. In both Slovak and Polish, the three traditional genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) are found. These genders are distinguished in the singular. Only in the nomi- native and accusative singular is neuter distinguished from masculine . As in Russian, animate masculine nouns in the singular take the genitive form when functioning as direct objects of transitive verbs, whereas inanimate masculine nouns appear in the nominative form. Neuters always take the nominative form here, whereas most feminine nouns have a special form for the accusative, the remaining feminine nouns taking the nominative. In the plural, the situation is quite different from the Russian one: Russian simply generalizes the distinction between animate and inanimate which exists in the singular masculine. Polish and Slovak introduce new distinctions. In Polish, the endings of modifiers and the preterite verb split up the plural nomi- native into a personal group, which contains nouns denoting male persons (but not all such nouns), and a group containing the other nouns. Thus, context (3.2.11.1) below admits the plural forms of masculine personal nouns, while context (3.2.1 1.2) admits all other plural nominatives: (Kposzli) (3.2.11.1) 'went1 (Kposzty) (3.2.11.2) 'went* Most linguists report that the same group of personal nouns also takes the genitive for the direct object function, whereas the remaining nouns do not. This would imply that the two features yield the same distinction. But Wertz points out that the situa- tion is more complex: certain plural nouns denoting male persons, such as the mascu- line noun karzei ('dwarf ') and the neuter noun chiopisko ('big fellow'), have non-per- sonal agreement in the plural nominative, but nevertheless employ the genitive plural to indicate the direct object. Wertz employs the term devirilized to refer to these classes.2 The situation is similar for the Slovak plural. According to Chifimia, the Slovak gender distinctions coincide with the Polish ones (except for the karzei and chiopisko groups).3 Horecky's model of this situation will be presented in the following section. 1 Chitimia I960: oassim and Wertz 1977: 50 orovide relevant references on Polish. 2 Wertz 1977 i2&gt;. 59. The agreement pattern for Polish nouns which results when Wertz's observations are taken into account will be provided in Fig. 4.6. 12.3. 3 Chifimia I960: 157. Normative grammar seems to have a stake in the Slovak situation. Miko [1962 {3&gt;. 47] and Stanislav [1977 {3}. 63] allow for three animal names, pes ('dog'), vták ('bird') and vlk ('wolf), to behave like nouns denoting male persons; Miko takes the trouble to qualify further deviations as archaic and dialectal. In the speech, explicitly elicited, of a young informant of the present writer, who considers herself to speak standard Slovak, animal names are distributed over three groups: 1 animal names which are always treated like nouns denoting male persons; 2 fuzzy animal names; 3 animal names which are definitely non-personal. Group 1 includes vták Cbird') and vlk Cwolf), which is in agreement with Miko and Stanislav but contra- dicts Kollár, who classifies them as fuzzy [1976: 745]. Group 1 also includes various bird names [slávik, 'nightingale') and types of dogs {vlõiak, 'Alsatian'), but also less-related animals {krt, 'mole'). Group 3 in-</page><page sequence="496">474 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS The above implies that an approach to Polish and Slovak nominal flection which leaves fuzzy classes out of consideration involves the following parameters: 1 masculine - neuter - feminine; 2 animate - inanimate; 3 personal - non-personal; 4 singular - plural; 5 nominative - genitive - dative - accusative - instrumental - locative. The problem consists in the following K-question. Which of the distinctions involved can be qualified as gender distinctions, and how can mutual interference, as well as interference on the part of the other categories, be ruled out? For example, the dis- tinction made in the plural between masculine personal nouns and other nouns is not matched by any distinction in the singular: it does not coincide with the distinction between animate and inanimate, as some animals count as animate but not as personal. Examples are given in the actual discussion of Horecky's model. §3.2.12 Horecky's model of 'gender' (G6): presentation Horecky1 points out how a model can account for more than four genders without giving up the catalyst concept. His model is presented as a rigid approach to Miko's criteria2 for the delimitation of 'gender1, using the technical ideas of Marcus and Za- liznjak.3 The model contains two novelties with respect to Marcus' model of concrete gender1. 1 Horecky defines only one catalyst. 2 Following Zaliznjak,4 he rules out the distorting influence of case and number syn- cretism, by assuming pre-established knowledge of case' and number'. Thus, the Slovak word iene ('woman') as a dative is distinguished from ¿ene as a locative. Supposedly, the model is provisional or partial, being based on another ^2 model which defines case.5 The latter point will be discussed first. When formalizing Horecky's and Zaliznjak's definitions, one is confronted with the problem that case and number1 are considered given, but it is not decided in what form this knowledge is provided. It is not sufficient to give cases and numbers as sets of words. In that case, the Russian genitive forms reki ('river') and nòdi fnight1) will eludes exotic animals {tiger, 'tiger'), but also domestic ones {kotì, 'horse'). But most animal names appear to belong to the fuzzy group 2, including jeleñ Cdeer'), which is Horecky's prototype of group 3. The dif- ferences were sometimes associated with style (personal forms for zape Chare') were qualified as colloquial), and sometimes with referential properties (personal forms for somár ('ass') were used to refer to persons), but in many cases (small animals and insects) no such explicit associations were present. A semantic dis- tinction may be suspected. Similarly, according to Miko 1962 {3k 51 and Stanislav 1977: 68, nouns ending in the actor suffix -tel' when used to indicate abstract concepts continue to behave like animate nouns in the singular. For the pre- sent writer's informant, öiniteVis inanimate when meaning 'factor', but animate when meaning 'public per- son*. 1 Horecky 1966. 2 Miko 1962 (1): 18-37. 3 Marcus* model of concrete gender': §3.2.7ff.; Zalizniak's agreement classes will be discussed in §3.2.23ff. 4 Zaliznjak 1964. 5 E.g.

In order to secure this knowledge, contexts too must be marked for case1 and number1, to match the marking of the nouns which they admit. It seems expedient to provide the knowledge of case and number' in the following form Consider given a set C of case-number classes. Each set C in C contains compati- ble pairs (fc, w) of contexts k and words w.1 Each set C is a sub-language of 5Ï2 for which the distribution of words and contexts can be determined separately (even if different case-number classes overlap, or if words and contexts occur in different case-number classes). Set W(C) of case-number forms in a given case-number class is derived as follows: W(C) = {w | w g W A V (fc, w) g C} (3.2.12.1) keK Within each case-number class C, the distribution Kc(w) of a word w, where it; g W, can be defined K%v) = {k | k g K A (fc, w) g C } (3.2. 12.2) Each case-number class C, being a sublanguage with the mathematical properties of a language, determines a set of families, the C-families of C. These Of amilies corre- spond to Revzin's hyperfamilies igipersemejstvo)2, save for the position of number1, which Revzin leaves out of consideration. The C-family F^it;) of a word w is defined as follows. ¥%») = {it/ | W g W A Kc(w) = Kc(w')} (3.2.12.3) If this terminology is applied to his model, Horecky assumes 12 case-number classes for the West Slavic languages: 6 cases * 2 numbers. The vocative case is not taken in- to consideration. The conception of case1 and number' which has been set out above must be accom- panied by several assumptions, such as that a paradigm is represented in only one O family of a case-number class. These assumptions, which either result from an implied derivation of case and 'number' or are added as constraints on C, are not made ex- plicit in Zaliznjak's and Horecky's models and will not be taken into account. Horecky makes use of minimal PF-chains.3 These chains must be redefined in terms of case-number classes. The set Nc((it/, C), (it;", C")) of (minimal) PFC-chains which con- nect word it;' in case-number class C with word it;" in case-number class C" is defined as follows. 1 Compatible pairs: §2.3.9. 2 Revzin 1967b (6.45): 162. 3 Minimal PF-chain: §3.2.5.</page><page sequence="498">476 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS N%i/, C), (w", CO) = {((lui, Cl), . . . , (wn, Cn)) | A lui € W(Ci) lSün A A Wj e Piwj-i) U Y^JÍWj-i) A (itfi, Cl) = (it»', C) A (iun, Cn) = (w", C") KjZn A A (( A w°h e W(C7i) A A w] e ?(w°k.l) u F^íu^.,) ((it;;, C°l), .... {w°mtCm)) 1 í hi m ì*k*m A (w], C°l) = (lu', C) A (w°m, Cm) = (u;", C")) =&gt;m*n)} (3.2. 12.4) The number of links in the chains in Nc(x, y) is denoted as nix, y).

A leading word form must meet certain requirements. 1 It undisputably belongs to the masculine natural gender.1 Chlap apparently fulfils this condition. Compare Marcus' characterization of m.2 2 Within the paradigms of words fulfilling condition 1, nouns can be assigned catalyst status if their case-number classes contain the maximal number of C-families (i.e. the forms of the cases which distinguish the largest number of genders).3 If a lan- guage has no gender distinction in the plural but distinguishes gender1 in the singu- lar, plural forms cannot be leading word forms. 3 Within the set of words which fulfil conditions 1 and 2, leading word form assign- ment is arbitrary. The existence of case syncretism entails the possibility that a word form fulfils condi- tion 2 in one case but not in another. Therefore, condition 2 implies that catalyst sta- tus is assigned not to a simple word form but to a pair consisting of a word form and a compatible case-number class. For Slovak, Horecky assigns the status of catalyst to (chlapa, CSing ace)- The catalyst will hence be denoted as t. As an auxiliary derivation, set A(u&gt;) can now be defined, containing the elements, marked for case' and number1, of the paradigm of word w which are connected with t by a PFC-chain consisting of three or less links: Aiw) = {hi/, 0 | vf G ?{w) A C g C A vf g W(C) A n'((u/, 0, t) S 3} (3.2.12.11) As in all other models treated thus far except for V.A. Uspenskij's sections (G1), the chain concept can be avoided. Definitions, equivalent to those given above, can be given in terms of Kulagina's K-classes.4 Then A(w) is defined as the intersection of the paradigm of w and the K-class of t. The definition of 'K-class1 must of course be adapted for C-families, so we obtain the following definition of the KC-class G2C(wt C) of word w in case-number class C: G2C(u;, 0 = {(it/, C) | C g C A vf g W(C') A (?(w) n F^hi/) * 8 V Phi/) n F^w) * 0) } (3.2.12.12) Paradigms must also be redefined so as to contain pairs of word forms and case-num- ber classes. The C-paradigm ?c(w) of a word w is defined as follows. pcforì = {(ií/, O I vf g W A C g C A w' g ?(w) n W(C)} (3.2.12.13) This is in fact a definition of ordered paradigm. In contrast to what has been called paradigm so far in the present book, an ordered paradigm is an ordered set, or rather an n-ary relation in which n-1 labels of grammatical categories are related to one or more word forms of an unordered paradigm. Gladkij reserves the label paradigm for 1 Horeckv 1966: 4. 2 Cf. §3.2.7 and §3.2.10. 3 Horecky 1966: 6. 4 Cf. §3.2.5.</page><page sequence="500">478 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS ordered paradigms and refers as neighbourhood to what is called {unordered) paradigm in the present study.1 Now the definition of A(w) is simple: A(w) = pChrì n G2C(f) (3.2. 12. 14) Fig. 3.2.12.1 shows that, if t = {chlapa, Csing gen), then A{¿ena) = {{¿ien, Cpiur gen), {¿enám, Cpiur ¿at), {¿enách, Cpiur ioc), {¿enami, Cpiur instr)} (3.2.12.15) Horecky is not interested in A(w) itself, but in the number a{w) of its elements. Thus, it is considered relevant that a{¿ena) = 4 (3.2.12.16) It is clear that the number of possible values of a(w) is a function of the number of case-number classes of a language. For Slovak, the range of a{w) runs from 0 to 12. Now Horecky's actual definition of 'gender' is arrived at. The G6-gender G6(w) of a word w contains the words with the same a{w): G6(w) = { w' | vf e W A akvA = a(w) } (3.2. 12. 17) The G6-genders make up a partition of W. Note that Horecky's model is not only an intensional approach to 'gender' but also provides a set of individual labels for individ- ual genders: the number a(w) is a universal indicator of the gender of a word. We can refer to it as gender index. The important difference with Marcus1 intensional labels for specific genders masculine, feminine, neuter and common is presented by their reality claims: Marcus' labels carry reality claims, which are lost for Horecky's labels (but not for the concepts which are covered by these labels2), which are simply num- bers. Here are some examples. The word ¿iak ('pupil') shows the same agreement pattern as chlap. This implies that ntx,t)S3 (3.2.12.18) for all forms x of ¿iak marked for case1 and 'number1. This yields okiiak) = cAchlap) = 12 (3.2. 12. 19) The noun ¿aba ('frog') has the agreement pattern of ¿ena, so that a(¿aba) = aizena) = 4 (3.2. 12.20) Thus, ¿iak and chlap belong to Gf2 and ¿aba and ¿ena belong to G% The results of Horecky's gender model for Slovak are shown in the following table.3 All vertical bars separate words belonging to different C-families;4 the squiggle will 1 The distinction is exploited in Gladkij's [1983 (4-5): 203-214] dependency models of gender, which is treated in §4.6.13ff. (In the formalization of Gladkij's model which will be presented in the present study, ordered paradigm' is dispensed with as an auxiliary concept.) 2 The reality claims of labels and concepts can be separated.

It is clear why Horecky selects the accusative singular of chlap (i.e. the compatible pair (chlapa, CSing acc)) as the catalyst: its row contains the largest number of bars.

Consequently, there are five gen- ders in Slovak, which are labelled intensionally by their gender indexes, and are ac- companied by the following extensional labels. G^2: (masculine personal) { chlap, ¿iak, . . . } ('man1; 'pupil') G|: (masculine animal) {jeleñ, owl • } ('deer'; 'eagle') G|: (masculine inanimate) { dub, stroj, . . . } ('oak'; 'machine') G|: (neuter) {mesto, srdce, ...} ('town'; 'heart') G$: (feminine) { ¿ena, ¿aba,...} ('woman1; 'frog') (3.2. 1 2.2 1 ) The squiggle between (duby, Cpiur acc) and {mesta, Cpiur acc) and between (duby, Cpiur nom) and (mesta, Cpiur nom' is solely motivated by the contexts (dva,') (3.2.12.22) 'two' which admits masculine non-personal plural forms, and (dve,') (3.2.12.23) 'two' which admits feminine and neuter plural forms. If these forms are left out of consideratioa the structure of 3.2.12.2 coincides with the traditional representation of the Polish gender system, which will be used in the discussion of dependency gender models in Chapter 4.6.2 1 The identification of G610 is actually incorrect.

Horecky implies that this does not apply to the compatible pairs (jelene, Cpiur acc) and (jelene, Cpiurnom) in view of the bars separating these pairs from (chlapov, Cpiuracc) and (chlapi, Cpiurnom): these bars obstruct the PFC-chains *(chlapa, Csing acc) - (chlapov, Cpiur acc) - (jelene, Cpiur acc) (3.2. 13. 1) *(chlapa, Csing acc) - (chlapi, Cpiur nOm) ~ (jelene, Cpiur nom) (3.2. 13.2) But the illegitimacy of the three-element PFC-chains (3.2.13.1) and (3.2.13.2) is not a sufficient condition to separate the G6-genders of jeleñ and chlap: consider the fol- lowing PFC-chains. (chlapa, Csing acc) - (jeleña, Csìng acc) - (jelene, Cpiur acc) (3.2. 13.3) (chlapa, Csing acc&gt; - (jeleña, CSing acc) " (jelene, Cpiur nom) (3.2. 13.4) The existence of the three-element PFC-chains (3.2.13.3) and (3.2.13.4) implies that G*(jelefi) = G612 = GHchlap) (3.2. 13.5) This would suggest that there is no masculine animal gender. It is obvious that Horecky did not intend this result. It is shown below that it is quite possible to modify the model in such a way that that it tallies with Horecky's intended results. The chain concept is in fact a survival from Marcus' model, which can be dispensed with in Horecky's approach. 'Gender1 has so far been determined by taking as the rele- vant index the number of elements x' in the C-paradigm of word x such that n'(x',t)*3 (3.2.13.6) But what Horecky really counts is the number of word forms (labelled for case1 and number') in the C-paradigm of x which belong to the same C-families as words in the C-paradigm of t: chlap and jeleñ belong to different genders because there are two case-number classes (viz. Cpiuracc and CpiurnOm) in which the corresponding forms of chlap and jeleñ belong to different C-families. It is this criterion that must be formal- ized. Instead of A(w), which was a nameless auxiliary concept, defined in (3.2.12.14), set A'(w) is defined: the set of pairs in the C-paradigm of w belonging to the same C-fami- lies as the corresponding pairs in the C-paradigms of word t of the C-paradigm of t. Atw) = {(w' C) | w' e P(w) A C e C A w' e W(C) A V V e F^u/) } (3.2. 13.7) fGP(t) Let alw;) denote the number of elements in A'(iu) and serve as the gender index in- stead of a(w). A new definition of 'gender' can now be constructed. The G7 -gender G7(w) of a word w contains the words with the same revised gender index.</page><page sequence="503">CHAPTER 3.2 TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 48 1 G7(w) = {w' | vf € W A a'w') = aXw) } (3.2. 13.8) It is no longer necessary to select a specific form of a Oparadigm as the catalyst. Any form of the same paradigm will do equally well. This enables us to speak of the catalyst paradigm instead of the catalyst form. Fig. 3.2.12.2 shows that aïjelefù = 10 (3.2.13.9) For all other nouns w, the values of alii;) coincide with those of a(w' so that the model of G7 yields the results which Horecky had intended for G6. S 3.2.14 Discussion of Horecky 's gender model: catalysts (G8) Besides Slovak, Horecky reports to have applied his model to Czech and Polish and obtain similar results. Four genders are given for Czech:1 ti[2' masculine animate G^o: masculine inanimate g£: neuter G75: feminine (3.2.14.1) Five genders are given for Polish:2 G'2: masculine personal G'o: masculine animal3 G9: masculine inanimate G7Q: neuter g£ feminine4 (3.2.14.4) Horecky does not indicate which Polish and Czech words have served as catalysts. Yet the choice of the catalyst (or the catalyst paradigm) continues to present a prob- lem. In §3.2.10, some technical and methodological problems were pointed out which are connected with the concept of catalyst. It was shown that Marcus' semantic cri- teria are not sufficient to establish a practicable intensional definition of catalyst1. It 1 There is an error in the top right cell of Table 4 in Horecky 1966: 9, which suggests that the gender index is 6 for feminine nouns. 2 The results for Polish are based on the traditional descriptions, which do not take marginal {karzei, 'dwarf'), fuzzy [chtopisko, *big fellow') and mixed {sierota, 'orphan') noun groups into account. A more so- phisticated account of Polish is provided in §4.6.32, where Gladkij's gender model is applied to Wertz's Polish data. 3 In Table 5 of Horecky 1966: 9, the first bar, which separates personal CA) and animal (D) in the accusa- tive singular, does not belong there. If the accusative singular would really distinguish between personal and animal, a masculine personal noun would be useless as a catalyst because animal and inanimate nouns would have the same gender index. 4 Or G74 for feminine if the numeral contexts {dwoma,') (3.2.14.2) 'two, instrumental masculine and neuter' (dwiema,') (3.2.14.3) 'two, instrumental feminine' are excluded. These are the only modifiers to separate genders in the instrumental plural.</page><page sequence="504">482 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS will be examined here to what extent Horecky's material contributes to an intensional definition of catalyst1. The choice of the catalyst is not arbitrary. It is simple to deduce from Fig. 3.2.12.2 that the results of Horecky's model depend on the choice of the catalyst. If it would be decided to take ¿ena as the catalyst instead of chlap (i.e. Marcus' / instead of m), then only three genders would obtain, since, in that case, a'(chlap) =a'(jelefù =a'(dub) = 4 (3.2. 14.5) If the potential catalyst which yields the larger number of genders is considered op- timal, then chlap (five genders) is to be preferred to iena (three genders). This may indicate that Horecky's model employs an implicit criterion for the assignment of catalysts which is independent of language-specific considerations: if one wishes to find the optimal catalyst for a language, one must establish, for each paradigm ?{w), the number of genders which result if w is regarded as the catalyst of the language, the result of this procedure for Slovak can be deduced from Fig. 3.2.14.1 below: each cell shows the gender index which results for the word of the row if catalyst status would be assigned to the word of the column. The bottom row shows the maximum number of different values for the revised gender indicator for the word of the column.1 Fig. 3.2.14.1 chlap jelerí dub mesto ¿ena chlap 12 10 9 8 4 jeleñ 10 12 11 8* 4** dub 9 11 12 8* 4* mesto 8 8* 8* 12 6 iena _4 4** 4* 6 12 5 5 5 3 3 As shown in the bottom row, the use of mesto or ¿ena as the catalyst does not provide maximal gender variation. On the other hand, it does not make any difference whether ïichlap) or PijelefÙ or Pidub) is taken as the catalyst paradigm: the number of different values of their gender indices is the same for each. The selection of any of their paradigms will yield equally satisfactory results. The present procedure does not, however, guarantee satisfactory results in all in- stances. So far, only West Slavic word class systems have been dealt with, which show at least one instance of coinciding gender agreement, i.e. 1 Fig. 3.2.14.1 is a corrected version of Horecky's [1966: 7] Table 2. The figures which are marked with one asterisk differ from Horecky's. His figures are not correct if the contexts (dva,') (3.2.14.6) 'two, nominative masculine and neuter* (dve,') (3.2.14.7) 'two, nominative feminine' are taken into consideration, as in Horecky's Table 1 [1966: 71. If, however, these contexts are excluded, Horecky's figures (10 for 8*; 10 for 8*; 6 for 4*) are correct, but then Horecky's 4 which is marked with two asterisks must be replaced by 6.</page><page sequence="505">CHAPTER 3.2: TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 483 A a'iw)* 1 (3.2.14.8) lueW Genders have been distinguished, not by their very differences in gender agreement, but by the quantity of these differences. An artificial example is given below, which shows that reduction to quantification can obscure relevant qualitative differences. Consider a language which contains paradigms P(a), P(b) and P(c), and families F(a), F(a') and Fia") as listed below. There is no case syncretism, so case-number classes are not relevant and can be omitted. P(a)= [a,a'a"} P(b) = {b,b'b"} P(c)= {cyc',c"} (3.2.14.9) Fla) = Fib) * Fie) Fib') = Fid * Fia!) Fie") = Fla") * Fib") (3.2.14.10) The following table is obtained. Fig 3.2.14.2 Pia) P(b) Pic) abc a' b' c' a" 1 b" | c" The values of the revised gender index for the different possible values of the cata- lyst are shown in the following table. The bottom row shows the number of different values for each paradigm. Fig. 3.2.14.3 Pia) P(b) Pic) Pia) 3 1 1 P(b) 1 3 1 Pic) 1 1 3 2 2 2 According to the maximal gender variation criterion, any paradigm may be taken as the catalyst since the number of different values for the gender index is maximal for all paradigms, viz. 2. Yet the resulting inventory of genders varies according to which catalyst is chosen. If Pia) is the catalyst paradigm, then P(b) and Pic) end up in one gender G7lt since the gender index of both P(b) and Pic) will equal 1. But if P(b) is taken as the catalyst paradigm the gender index will equal 1 for Pia) and Pic), etc. The situation sketched out above is not entirely artificial: it occurs in an extreme form in quite feasible languages where word class differences are indicated consis- tently, i.e. independently of case1 and number1. Consider the Indonesian example which was adduced in §2.2.5 and §3.2.8. The analysis depends, of course, on the nature of the case-number classes, but, for any</page><page sequence="506">484 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS quantity of case-number classes, the gender index will assume zero value for all fami- lies except the family of the catalyst as long as there are no special case-number classes for numeral expressions with classifiers.1 Presume that any case-number class can contain a numeral expression with a classifier, which distinguishes the families mentioned in §2.2.5. The gender index for the family of the catalyst will then equal the quantity n of case-number classes. As a result, there will be two G7-genders in Indo- nesian for any value of the catalyst: G7n, which coincides with the family of the cata- lyst, and G7, which contains all other nouns. Thus, it is apparently impossible to establish an unambiguous procedure to find the catalyst of a language. But it will be argued now that the concept of catalyst is in fact superfluous in Horecky's model of "gender. In Fig. 3.2.12.2, not all Slovak nouns are taken into consideration: in fact, only five are. The other words w in W were left out because, for each w, there is a word in Fig. 3.2.12.2 which, when identified as the catalyst, would provide aíw) =12 (3.2.14.11) In other words, all forms in the C-paradigm of any Slovak noun would be in the same C-family with those of one of the words of the table. So actually, Horecky's genders had already been established before the catalyst was: all words for which the gender index equalled 12 with respect to each other had already been united. The catalyst only provided the labels for the established gen- ders: for example, it assigned the label G74 to G7(2ena). Thus, Horecky's model contains an implicit definition of 'gender' which does without the concept of catalyst. This "spontaneous" definition of 'gender' is formalized as fol- lows. Let c{w) be the number of elements in the C-paradigm of w. Let a"(w[t W2) be defined as a'{w') for W2 = t. It can be proved that ertivi, w2) = a'íwz w{) (3.2. 14. 12) The spontaneous gender G8{w) of a word w is, thea defined as follows. G8(u&gt;) = {W I w' e W A a'tw, W) = chi;) = chi;') } (3.2. 14. 13) 'Spontaneous gender' is equivalent to Revzin's gender" in its final form,2 which is ar- rived at along entirely different lines: Revzin's definition is a reinterpretation of Za- liznjak's gender model,3 which is, in turn, a modification of Revzin's earlier gender model. We have seen how subsequent modifications of Marcus' 'concrete gender', viz. by removing chains, and catalysts, eventually result in Revzin's "gender1. A more direct definition of G8 will be introduced in § 3.2.24. 1 Indonesian having no morphological case and number systems, it is reasonable to assume only one case- number class. The reduplication plurals mentioned in §2.2.26 are left out of consideration. 2 Cf.

This implies that no attempt is made to pro- vide a definition of specific genders, such as 'masculine1. The only concept being modelled is 'gender1, or, if one decides to resign from reality claims for the label, agreement class1. 2 The system C of case-number classes, which occurs in Horecky's and Zaliznjak's models, is not added to the base component. Any solutions to the problem of case syncretism are attempted within the framework of base component ñ^1 3 The application of the definition of gender' is explicitly geared to a specific set of phrases which does not necessarily coincide with H: Marcus' model of "concrete gender" was implicitly restricted to the set of phrases of the type NOUN + MODI- FIER(s). In the new model, Marcus extends his obervations to phrases which include verbal expressions. This subset of the set of phrases is given from outside. This practice is comparable to the extension of the base component with the given set C of case-number classes. But whereas models with base components containing set system C define 'gender' for all subsets in C, the definition of 'gender' in the new model will be restricted to a single subset of phrases. The methodological im- plications of this practice will be discussed more extensively in §3.2.32, but it is clear that, if a language is supplied with different subsets of H for each of which 'gender' is defined separately, more than one gender system will be obtained for the language. A consistent application of this approach may produce different gender systems for each case and number.2 Marcus' approach in the present model can be illustrated with an extended version of the Romanian gender problem. It was shown in §3.2.4 that adjective agreement has given rise to the problem of the Romanian neuter because the agreement pattern of the scaun group differs from that of both masculine and feminine nouns. The principle of different distribution for the complete paradigm, which was involved in the estab- lishment of the scaun group, yields similar problems for other groups of nouns if it is applied consistently to an expanded set of phrases including "simple sentences". In §3.1.3 it was pointed out that nouns which denote persons and occur as direct objects of transitive verbs, can be preceded by the "object marker" pe, especially when the nouns are determined. Thus, the context3 (vädpe,') (3.2.15.1) 'I see + object marker' admits bärbat ('man') and Ion (proper name), but does not admit pom ('tree'). Romanian also possesses an indirect object marker lui which is only used with masculine proper names. Thus, the context4 1 Onlv Revzin is concerned with this Droblem. See §3.2.20. 2 This point will be taken up in §4.6.39. 3 Context (3.2.15.1) is identical to (3.1.3.17). 4 Context (3.2.15.2) is identical to (3.1.3.22).</page><page sequence="508">486 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS (dau lui, o carte) (3.2.15.2) 'I give + object marker'; 'a book' admits Ion, but does not admit bärbat or pom. Confrontation of this material with Marcus1 definition of concrete gender' (G5) and m = bärbat results in the removal of Ion and pom from the masculine gender: they be- long to the neuter gender on account of contexts containing pe and lui. Comparable phenomena also relegate most traditionally feminine nouns to the concrete neuter gender. In fact, on the basis of the above and similar observations, Marcus' "discovery" of the Romanian "neuter" is followed by discoveries of more Romanian genders.1 It is in this light that Marcus' proposals to settle the question of gender1 must be viewed. §3.2.16 Marcus1 'abstract gender' (G9) Marcus' model of abstract gender defines a system G9 of tolerance classes which is closely related to Revzin's gender (to be discussed in the next section): two words w' and u&gt;2 belong to the same abstract gender if each word in the paradigm of w' is con- nected to each word in the paradigm of W2 by a PF-chain containing no more than three links:2 G9={G|GCWA A A n{wh w2) £ 3 A A V n(w^w4)&gt;3} (3.2.16.1) w' e G i¿&gt;2£ G w$£G u&gt;4eG Marcus' use of PF-chains can be avoided: G9 can be defined directly in terms of paradigms and families: G9={G|GCWA A A ( A V F(w') = F(w'j w' e G W2^ G w' g P(w]) iv'2e Pdi^) A A V F(w'{) = F(u#) A A V ( V A F(W3)*F(v/A) V V A FOt^Fm»} (3.2.16.2) w'je Piw+i lüg g ?{w¿ Finally, G9 can be defined in terms of PF-classes: G9={G|GCWA A A A V (w' g Gì A w'2 g G?) w'eG W2eG w'eP{w') GJg G4 A A V V A (w'3£G)VwAeG4)} (3.2.16.3) IU3É G W4G G IÜ3G ?{w¿ Gf £ G4 Marcus' model of abstract gender1 yields eight different genders for the Romanian material described in §3.2.15.

Fig. 3.2.4.1 suggests that pom and bärbat belong to the same abstract gender since it is true for any form w' of pom and for any form w" of bärbat that n(w'w'U3 (3.2.16.4) The paradigms of scaun and casa belong to different G9-genders because, for example, nicasä, scaun) = 4 n(casä, bärbafi) = 6 niscaune, barbati) = 4 (3.2.16.5) Thus, for the present material, the results of the concrete and abstract gender mod- els coincide, except that the model of abstract gender1 does not tell which gender is masculine, which is feminine, etc. This is an advantage whenever gender patterns are dealt with which deviate from the "classic" pattern in number and semantic rooting, as in the Indonesian example, where each word class is defined as a separate abstract gender.3 Compare also the Italian example, where the concrete neuter gender is now solit into at least four abstract Benders.4 Fig. 3.2.16.1 PPPPPP F; uomini 8 8 8 8 8 'men' F a uomo paio 0 0 8_ 8 'mari; 'pair* Y 'e 8 paia donne 0 8 8 'pairs'; 'women' F ja 8 0 donna # 0 8 'woman' Fji+ia 8 8 8 giovane 8 8 'youngster' F/f le 8 0 8 giovani 8 8 'youngsters' Fia+ie 8 8 8 8 radio 8 'radio', 'radios' F;7+/ '0'0'0'0'0're' 'king1, 'kings' For the latter three paradigms, all PF-chains are infinite. The position of paio corre- sponds to Romanian scaun. The results are not entirely satisfactory for the words which show gender and number syncretism (viz. giovane, radio and re), but at least the different types of syncretism are separated and no longer classified with paio as neuters. Note that abstract genders, constituting a system of tolerance classes, can over- lap. This is relevant to the treatment of defective paradigms. Consider, for example, the way in which the model handles the Romanian pluralia tantum zori ('daybreak1), which takes feminine agreement, and cîlfi f tow'5), which takes masculine agreement. 1 Cf. §3.2.8. 2 There is an error in Marcus 1967a (4.9) 151 and Marcus 1963a (5): 106: the gender which is listed fifth and is referred to as the first non-personal feminine gender must be called the first personal feminine gender. 3 Cf. §2.2.5 and §3.2.8. 4 Cf. §3.2.8. 5 I.e. the shorter fibres of flax which are separated by heckling from the fine and long-stapied ones.</page><page sequence="510">488 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS Fig 3.2.16.2 p p p p p Fmasculine plural cW PO™ 0 0 0 Fmasculine singular 0 /»m scatin 0 0 Ff eminine plural 0 0 scaune zori case Ff eminine singular 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 casa Here ci''i belongs exclusively to the gender of pom, extensionally labelled masculine, since it can be connected with any form of pom by a PF-chain containing three or fewer elements. But zori belongs to two G9-genders: it is connected with all forms of scaun by a PF-chain of three links or less, and also to all forms of casa. Speaking in terms of extensional labels, zori is both feminine and neuter. There is no limit to the number of genders to which a word can belong. Consider the Russian plurale tantum sani ('sledge'), which, if observations are limited to the nominative,1 belongs to three genders: Fig 3.2.16.3 P P P P Fmasculine singular gõrod 0 0 0 'town* Fneuter singular 0 oknó 0 0 'window' Ff eminine singular 0 0 reki 0 'river' Fpiurai 1 gorodá ' ókna ' réki ' sani In spite of Revzina's opinion, quoted in §3.2.8, that gender values should be uniquely assigned, the model handles defective paradigms in a reasonably satisfactory manner: assigning sani to a specific gender would be arbirtrary; leaving it genderless would be less satisfactory. But there is a limit: consider a situation in which two defective paradigms occur in complementary distribution. Let us regard kartófeV Cpotato(es)') as a singulare tantum.2 The following situation results.

But n(kartófeì' sani) = 4 (3.2. 16.6) which implies that there is no common G9-gender for kartófeV and sani: the model yields two masculine genders: one of them includes the pluralia tantum, the other in- cludes the masculine singularia tantum. This situation will be eliminated in Revzin's model of gender1, to be discussed next. The major objections to Marcus* abstract gender' concern case syncretism. Since 1 For a sample which is relevant for all cases, cf. §2.2.9. 2 KartófeV is a mass noua- it remains singular even when more potatoes are referred to.

In terms of PF-chains, Revzin's criterion can only be expressed in a rather roundabout way: the requirement stipulates that there be at least two minimal PF- chains of length 3 to connect each pair of elements of the paradigms of w' and w^ Note that G10 is a partitioa whereas G9 is a system of tolerance classes. This dif- ference results in disparate treatments of incomplete paradigms.

Since F(sadu) n ?(górod) = fò (3.2. 19.1) sád does not belong to Gì0{górod) but to a separate G10-gender: compare the fol- lowing figure.

The result is that FtréJtü)nP(tó/2l = 0 (3.2.19.2) so that íén'and reká belong to different G10-genders.

(3.2.19.3) In this list, nouns which syncretize exclusively different cases (i.e. families) of singular and plural have not been considered. Thus, baba ('woman') and kréslo Cseat'), which syncretize genitive singular and nominative plural, and soldât ('soldier'), which syn- cretizes nominative singular and genitive and accusative plural are not accounted for. Also, the syncretism of the instrumental singular and the dative plural of portnój is left out of consideration. These instances present no special problems as to the issue concerned here. The above list is not exhaustive: the series of Russian G10-genders can probably be expanded with singularia tantum of deviant flexion types which show syncretism or have sub-cases. Also, words with "accidental" empty cells in their paradigms have been left out of consideration., such as mglá ('haze'), which has no genitive plural, or drovéc ('firewood'), which has only a genitive plural. The number of G10-genders would also increase if a phonological notation of Russian would be considered instead of accentuated orthography: many endings which are distinguished when stressed or written, coincide when they are not stressed in pronunciation. Thus, podleZáSdim (instrumental singular of podleíáSõee) and podleláéóem (locative singular) are pro- nounced alike and would not, in a phonological denotation, belong to the same G10- gender as ¿arkóe Croastmeat') where the pronunciation distinguishes between the in- strumental singular zarkim and the locative singular ¿arkóm. Although Revzin's model of gender' does not really model gender', its results are not devoid of linguistic interest. Each resulting word class unites words requiring an identical treatment from a morphosyntactic point of view. The classes do not coincide with the declension types of traditional grammar, since the model abstracts explicitly from the internal morphological composition of the words. If, for example, otéc ('father') and syn ('son') are taken to belong to different declension types because the nominative plural ending of otéc is -y (to obtain otcyi and that of syn is -ov'já (to ob- tain synov'ja), they will still belong to the same G10-class as their forms have identical syntactic agreement and show the same syncretism. In this light, it may be appropriate to return to Revzin's original label, morphologi- cal isub-)class for the classes of G10, or even to coin morphosyntactic class.</page><page sequence="517">CHAPTER 3.2: TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 495 §3.2.20 Revzin's kinds (G n) Revzin recognizes the problems which arise for the preceding model as a result of case syncretism. He proposes a modification based on DobruSin's relation of substitut- ability dominance.1 It was shown in §2.2.16 how the words in Fig. 3.2.19.1 and Fig. 3.2.19.2 can S-dominate each other. Thus, sadú -+ sáde sadú -* górode reká - ten' réku-+tén* (3.2.20.1) This relation can be exploited in order to provide a closer approximation of intuitive gender' by unifying G10-classes. Revzin does not consider employing substitutability dominance itself, but proceeds immediately to the transitive closure of SOtolerance, which is in turn derived from substitutability dominance.2 In his modified definition of gender', families are replaced by classes of this partition.3 Revzin defines the follow- ing class G^ti^i) for a word w'. G1 Kwi) = { w2 1 w2 e W A A V FSTC(u;i) = F^u^) w'e ?{w') w'2e P(u&gt;2) A A V FSTC^^pSTC^)} (3.2.20.2) w'2 e ?[w2Í u&gt;'{ e ?{w') He calls these classes, which make up a partition, kinds iporoda).4 The definition as- signs ?{reká) and Piten) to the same G^-class: re*a- ten' (3.2.20.3) entails reká e FSTC(fé/î0 (3.2.20.4) and réku -* ten' (3.2.20.5) entails réku € FS^ÍfénO (3.2.20.6) Similarly, sád and górod are united into one G1 1 -class. But, charged with the reality claims of 'gender', the kinds in G11 are too broad. Revzin himself points out that the new definition erases the distinction between ani- mate and inanimate nouns, in view of, say, the S-dominance pairs otéc -► sád (3.2.20.7) 1 Cf. §2.2.16. ¿ Definition (2.2.25.1). 3 These classes were defined in (2.2.25.4) and labelled F^Ru;). 4 Revzin 1967b (6.45k 161.</page><page sequence="518">496 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS sáda -* oteé (3.2.20.8) implying that, respectively, otéc e Frisad) (3.2.20.9) oteas FSTC(sáda) (3.2.20.10) But in fact all distinctions are erased. In §2.2.25, it was concluded that the transitive closure of SC-tolerance allowed for too much spillover for it to be acceptable as a model of part of speech1. But the model of G11 in fact demands that, for two words w' and W2 to belong to the same gender, all pairs of words in ?(w') and ?(w2Í must belong to the same part of speech in the above sense. Since we can presume that all nouns belong to the same part of speech, this requirement will apply to any pair of nouns, so all nouns end up in the same kind. S 3.2.21 Revzin's kinds: a first amendment (G12) It is possible to employ DobruSin's relation of S-dominance in a different way. In this section, a possibility is worked out which was not considered by exponents of the Set- theoretical School but can be added for the sake of completeness. The revised kind or revised Revzin gender Gi2(w) of a word w contains the words the paradigms of which represent an identical series of elementary grammatical cate- gories. If E is the set of elementary grammatical categories,1 set Gi2{w) is defined as follows. Gì2(w) = {tu' | w' g W A A (En ?{w) /0^En P(iu') * 0) } (3.2.21.1) EgE Thus, vrémja ('time') and õudóviSõe ('monster') belong to the same G12-class because both the paradigm of vrémja and the paradigm of õudóvièõe represent the same ele- mentary grammatical categories, viz.:2 (singular) (plural) Eisáda) E(¿eny) E(otcú) E(ókon) Eiotcóm) E(óknam) E(sadú) Eióknami) E(oknó) E(óknax) (3.2.21.2) Fig. 3.2.21.1 below shows the intersections of the elementary grammatical categories which are generated by the initial families given in (2.2. 17.3),3 with the paradigms rep- resenting the morphosyntactic G10-classes listed in (3.2.19.3). The G10-classes which do not intersect with the same elementary grammatical categories are united into G12-classes. Thus, G12(oféc) includes: 1 Elementary grammatical categories: definition (2.218.1). 2 This can be checked in Figures 2.2.18.1 to 2.2.18.4. d Elementary grammatical categories are the progressive products (definition (2.2.16.12)) of initial families (§2.2.17).</page><page sequence="519">CHAPTER 3.2: TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 497 G10(ofe'c) Gi0(star$iná) G^ipodmastéféì G[0(portnój) (3.2.21.3) But G12(oféc) does not include, say, Gì0{górodì.

One would wish the model to treat them consistently, either as gen- ders or non-genders. But the model yields the distinction only for masculine nouns: not for neuter and feminine nouns and not for pluralia tantum. This is due to the fact that the latter groups distinguish 'animacy1 only in the plural: 'animacy' in the plural is dis- tinguished not by special endings, but by a different use of the endings. In the mascu- line singular, on the other hand, there is a small group of animate nouns with a special accusative singular (viz. the starãiná group), which serves as a catalyst for all mascu- line animate nouns since it makes up an initial set which generates an elementary grammatical category. §3.2.22 Revzin's kinds: a second amendment (G13) A further modification of Revzin's model can be considered. Rather than from elemen- tary grammatical categories gender1 can be derived from quasi-elementary grammati- cal categories. If EQ denotes the set of quasi-elementary grammatical categories,1 then the re-revised kind or Gl3-gender Gìd(w'ì of a word w' is defined as follows. G130üi)= {w2'w2e WA A (EnP(u&gt;i)*0&lt;=&gt;EnP(u&gt;2)*0)} (3.2.22.1) EeEQ Since E^iókna) and Enfierà are included in the set of quasi-elementary grammatical categories, and since ókon does not belong to E^iZën), and ¿ëny does not belong to Etyókna), the new definition will distinguish animate and inanimate in the plural: it will yield special G13-classes for animate neuter and feminine nouns and for animate plu- ralia tantum. There is, however, also a quasi-elementary grammatical category EQ(ofcé), which includes górod but excludes masculine nouns with a separate locative II, such as sád with locative II sadú, as the latter are not S-dominated by oteé.2 A similar situation arises for the genitive II. As a result, górod, sád and õáj will belong to different Gi- classes because their paradigms are represented in different quasi-elementary gram- matical categories. In coming to a conclusion, we suggest that the modifications of Revzin's model ap- proach gender' to a certain degree. But their performance decreases when they are confronted with the less regular parts of a case and gender system. Since natural lan- guage has the right to possess irregularities, Revin's models are not the last word on gender'. 1 Definition (2.2.19.9). 2 This is visible in Fig. 2.2.18.1.</page><page sequence="526">504 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS S 3.2.23 Zaliznjak's agreement classes: non-formal presentation Zaliznjak provides a sophisticated gender model1 which combines aspects of the models from Marcus, Revzin and Horecky introduced in this chapter. Zaliznjak's point of departure is the following definition. fAn agreement class is a set of nouns such that any pair of its elements, taken in any grammatical form (but the same form for both elements) requires, in attributive connections, the same set of words of any adjectival.2 Zaliznjak's terminology requires some explanation, which is given below. 1 Agreement class isoglasovatel'nyj klass). The reality claims of the concept which is covered by this term coincide with those of gender in the preceding models. Zaliz- njak avoids the possibly incorrect reality claims of the latter label with respect to the category of animacy. He proposes to restrict the label gender to the traditional genders. This point will be returned to in §3.2.31. 2 Grammatical form. Zaliznjak employs this term to indicate a combination of case and number features. As in Horecky's model, the feature system of words and con- texts is decomposed into a series of case-number classes, each representing a sub- system of it.3 These subsystems either presuppose a preceding definition of case1 and number' which is based on 5Ï2, or are added to the base component. 3 Attributive connection iattributivnaja svjazl Initially, Zaliznjak restricts his set of phrases to combinations of adjectivais (adjectives, numerals, etc.) and nouns. Thus, the definition is a partial model, presupposing a preceding definition of adjectivais and nouns, or considering these concepts given.4 Presumably, Zaliznjak employs the term connection in order to expand the validity of the model over non-linear phrase structures: an attributive connection can exist between words independent- ly of their places in the linear sentence. He does not specify the alternatives for linear structure in connection with his gender model, which would entail a modifi- cation of the base component. Thus, the model can be dealt with as if his contexts were linear. Technically, Zaliznjak's definition is ambiguous where it speaks of "any grammatical form (but the same for both elements)". He does not quite make clear what happens if elements do not occur in certain grammatical forms, i.e. in the case of defective paradigms. Obvious examples are singularia and pluralia tantum, which are extensive- ly discussed in Zaliznjak's work;5 but consider also mglá ('haze'): there is no form of mglá to correspond to the genitive plural of reká ('river'), viz. rék. This implies that one of the following interpretations holds. 1 The genitives plural of reká and mglá cannot be compared and the grammatical form is left out of consideration. Then, in view of their corresponding remaining forms, reká and mglá will belong to the same agreement class. 1 Zaliznjak 1964. The same material is also found in Zaliznjak 1967b (2.14-2.19): 62-80. 2 Zaliznjak 1964 (1): 26; Zaliznjak 1967b (2.15): 66. 3 Distribution as a feature system- cf. §2.2.2. 4 This restriction will be relaxed at a later stage: cf. §3.2.29.

Then reká and mglá end up in different agreement classes as zero distri- bution is necessarily different from any other distribution. In the first interpretation, Zaliznjak's definition corresponds to Marcus' model of ab- stract gender' (G9);1 in the second interpretation, it corresponds to Revzin's model of gender' (G10),2 the difference with these models being that Zaliznjak adds case1 and 'number' to the base component. In the second interpretation, Zaliznjak's definition is equivalent to the spontaneous gender1 (G8),3 which has evolved from Horecky's gen- der model (G6).4 S 3.2.24 Zaliznjak's agreement classes: two formalizations (G8, G14) Revzin opts for the second interpretation in his formalization of Zaliznjak's definition. He considers it to be a model of 'gender' employing the concept of hyperf amity (giper- semejstvo).5 This concept corresponds to the concept of C-family, presented in definition (3.2.12.3). (Only, Revzin does not explicitly differentiate hyperf amilies for singular and plural.) In the present rendering of Revzin's formalization of Zaliznjak's definition, the con- cepts introduced in §3.2.12 will be employed: wherever Revzin involves case', our pre- sentation also involves 'number1. Since both case1 and 'number' are given from outside, the alteration does not affect the structure of the model itself. Thus, the agreement class or Gß-gender GP[w') of a word w' is defined as follows.6 C«UJi)-{w2k2€WA AAV F^U^-F^il^ Cle C i^i g P(u&gt;i)nW(Cl) u^e Pktf2) A A A V FC2(utf-FO(u#} (3.2.24.1) C2e C w'± e P(iü2)nW(C2) w'{e ?[w{) Note the similarity to Revzin's own model of 'gender' (G10):7 what is defined for the complete set of contexts in Revzin's model, is defined for each case (or pair consisting of a case and a number) separately in Revzin's interpretation of Zaliznjak's model. The resulting G8-classes constitute a partition of W. But Zaliznjak's further discussion suggests that he himself intends the other, first, interpretation of his non-formal definition.8 This prompts the following definition of his set G14 of agreement classes. 1 Cf. §3.2.16. 2Cf.§3.2.17ff. 3 Cf. §3.2.14. 4 Cf. §3.2.12. 5 Revzin 1967b (6.45): 162. 6 Revzin 1967b (6.45): 162.

This implies that the difference between Revzin's gender' and Marcus' abstract gender' corresponds to the difference between Revzin's interpretation of Zaliznjak's 'gender' and our present interpretation: the resulting Gi- classes make up a system of tolerance classes, in which defective paradigms are as- signed to one or more classes with corresponding full ordered paradigms. The ap- pearance of unexpected genders as a result of complementary defective paradigms2 is still possible, but Zaliznjak's thorough analysis of the Russian material suggests that it is not likely to occur, at least for this language. It will be shown in the next section how Zaliznjak establishes the agreement classes of Russian. S 3.2.25 The agreement classes of Russian In the first round of his applicatioa Zaliznjak limits his set of phrases to the combina- tion ADJECTIVAL + NOUN. Note that other phrases are indirectly represented if it is presumed that cases are defined in a preliminary partial model on a wider set of con- texts. Zaliznjak points out that, in practice, it is possible to restrict the set of contexts under consideration to those in the nominative singular and accusative plural, since these two combinations of 'case1 and number1 represent all distinctions which are rele- vant for agreement. Thus, the following set of contexts is sufficient to reveal the in- ventory of Russian agreement classes. (bélyjA) (3.2.25.1) 'white, nominative singular masculine' ibéloe, X) (3.2.25.2) 'white, nominative singular neuter' {bélaja, X) (3.2.25.3) 'white, nominative singular feminine' (bélye, X) (3.2.25.4) 'white, accusative plural inanimate' 1 Definitions (3.2.16.1), (3.2.16.2) and (3.2.16.3). 2 Complementarity defective paradigms: §32.9, §3.2.16.</page><page sequence="529">CHAPTER 3.2 TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 507 (bélyx, X) (3.2.25.5) 'white, accusative plural animate* Other contexts can at most reproduce the differences established on the basis of these contexts. Note that the same applies to Slovak: any bar which separates forms of paradigms (i.e. C-families) in Fig. 3.2.12.2 crosses the nominative singular or the ac- cusative plural. Consider the following phrases grammatical.

Zaliz- njak mentions the proposal to split words of this type into homonyms, so that two nouns are obtained: sirotám denoting male orphans, and sirotái denoting female or- phans.1 But this entails further complications when plural forms refer to mixed groups, unless yet another homonymous plurale tantum siwtymf is accepted which patterns like molodozëny.2 Zaliznjak considers the possible existence of a special masculine personal G14- class, in view of the optional use of the collective numerals dvóe ftwo1), troe ('three'), etc. with nouns denoting male persons. Besides the compatible pair3 (3/2/25/20) below, we find a grammatical compatible pair (3/2/25/21): (3/2/25/20) dvá svna 'two (masculine or neuter) sons (singular genitive)' (3/2/25/21) dvóe svnovéi 'two (collective numeral) sons (plural genitive)' (The singular genitive syna of syn ('son') is obligatory with dvá; the plural genitive synovéj is obligatory with dvóe.) This optional use of collective numerals is not possi- ble with masculine nouns denoting animals. Compare grammatical (3/2/25/22) below with ungrammatical (3/2/25/23). (3/2/25/22) dvá vólka 'two (masculine or neuter) wolves (singular genitive)' (3/2/25/23) *dvóe volkóv 'two (collective numeral) wolves (plural genitive)' Zaliznjak argues that this is a marginal issue, if only because (3/2/25/23) does in fact occur in the spoken language. He leaves this case out of consideration.4 S 3.2.26 Zaliznjak's approach to defective paradigms When Marcus' abstract gender' was discussed, it turned out that co-occurrence of singularia and pluralia tantum results in unintended genders.5 Mathematically, this possibility exists for Zaliznjak's model of agreement class1 as well. Before Zaliznjak's 1 Zaliznjak 1967b (2.15): 67. 2 See §3.2.27. For a detailed discussion on the sirotá group, see §4.6.51. 3 Compatible pair. §2.3.9. 4 A curious question is the case-number class of the compatible pairs (3/2/25/20) and (3/2/25/21): are they singular or plural, nominative or genitive? But, case-number classes being a part of the base compo- nent, the question is outside the score of the model. 5 §3.2.16.</page><page sequence="531">CHAPTER 3.2: TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 509 dealing with this problem will be discussed, attention will paid to Zaliznjak's approach to defective paradigms in general.1 Zaliznjak's work offers three ^interpretations of what grammarians commonly unite under the heading defective paradigm. The three underlying phenomena can be described as follows. 1 The lexical meaning of a word is such that there is rarely a need to combine it with certain grammatical categories in actual usage, so that the corresponding forms simply do not occur. The Russian adjectives are a case in point: they are usually divided into two groups, according to whether they possess a morphological category expressed by the short form. The short form of an adjective, which is restricted to predicative use, contains implicit reference to other degrees (including zero) of possession of the quality indicated by the adjective as compared to the one attributed to the subject. Thus, (3/2/26/1) Ón vésel. 'he is cheerful (short form)1 can be interpreted as 'he is cheerful enough', or 'he is too cheerful1, or 'he is being cheerful today', or 'he is cheerful in this respect': in all interpretations, degrees of cheerfulness other than the one expressed are implicitly taken into consideration. The opposed long form simply expresses that the subject belongs to the group of objects which possess the quality which is labelled by the adjective: (3/2/26/2) Ón vesëlvi. *he is cheerful' implies 'he belongs to the group of cheerful people', 'he is a cheery person*. Traditional Russian grammar commonly distinguishes between qualitative (kadestvennyj) and relational {otnositeïnyj) adjectives. Qualitative adjectives pos- sess morphological short forms {vésel vs. vesëlyj), whereas relational adjectives do not {kámennyj, '(made of) stone'). The reason for the non-occurrence of the short form of kámennyj is, according to Zaliznjak, the fact that it is rarely necessary to express the meaning of the short form: 'stone' has no antonym, it knows no degrees and is not usually a temporary quality. But he points out that, if there would be a need to express the meaning of the short form with kámennyj (r which is always possible, if only because human fantasy knows no limit"2), a short form could easily be made: fin reality virtually any relational adjective can, in an appropriate context, acquire a "qualitative" shade of meaning (which in otherwise favourable circumstances enables it to produce short forms).3 By "otherwise favourable", Zaliznjak refers to possible defectiveness of other types, which are discussed below. Defectiveness of the present type can be re- 1 The present exposition is a synthesis of Zaliznjak's separate remarks on the subject which were published over a long period of time [1964, 1967b, 1977]. The present writer does not know whether it reflects Za- lizniak's coherent oninion at anv ai ven Doint of time. v * i - / o i 2 Zaliznjak 1964 {Aï 32 (on another example of this type of defectiveness). 6 Zaliznjak 1967b (2.22): 90.</page><page sequence="532">5 1 0 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS ferred to as semantic defectiveness, or defectiveness ¡, or even false defective- ness. 2 Zaliznjak's second type of morphological defectiveness occurs when grammatical categories not formally present in a paradigm are in fact combined with the mean- ing of the lexical item, but coincide in their formal expression with other categories which can be expressed with the lexical item. A case in point is the verb veléV ('command'): its forms express both the imperfective and perfective aspects. In Za- liznjak's conception, this kind of morphological homonymy not only includes de- tached forms, but extends to the syntactic connections of the words concerned, as will be illustrated in the next section. This type of defectiveness can be labelled morphosyntactic homonymy, or defectiveness^ 3 Besides the above types of defectiveness, Zaliznjak recognizes "real" defective paradigms: some words simply lack certain forms. In some cases, the gap can be accounted for in terms of morphonological properties, in other cases the absence of a certain form of an individual paradigm is practically arbitrary. A classic case in point is the verb ubedit' ('convince'), which lacks a first person singular. When- ever a speaker wishes to express the content ('I shall convince') of the non-exis- tent form, he must resort to synonymous lexical items (ugovorju) or to circumscrip- tion [já suméju ubedít' 'I shall succeed in convincing'). This type of defectiveness can be called real defectiveness, or defectiveness^ or morphological defective- ness. The group of morphologically defective words is apparently smaller than is usually assumed: Zaliznjak's grammatical dictionary marks several famous examples of defectiveness3 not as absent but as cumbersome [zatrudniteVno). Examples are ?ube¿dú CI shall convince') and ?méõt (genitive plural of medtá, 'daydream'). He points out that it is impossible or cumbersome to draw a sharp line between "impos- sible" and "cumbersome" forms, and that many decisions in this area are to a certain extent arbitrary.1 But this does not eliminate the fact that Zaliznjak in principle ac- knowledges instances of undisputable defectiveness3, such as the missing impera- tive of éxat' Cride, imperfective determinative'; compare idi from idtf, 'go, imper- fective determinative').2 Different types of defectiveness can be combined: relational adjectives with stems ending in -si:-, such as rússkij ('Russian'), cannot produce short forms even if human fantasy manipulates a qualitative shade into it. But this absolute lack of short forms must be accounted for in terms of morphological rather than semantic restrictions.3 S 3.2.27 The agreement classes of Russian: singularia and pluralla tantum We can now turn to the question of to which kinds of defectiveness Zaliznjak assigns the defective noun paradigms of Russian. The most urgent groups are the singularia and pluralia tantum. 1 Zaliznjak 1977: 8. 2 Example from Zaliznjak's grammatical dictionary [1977 (exaf): 684]. A classification of possible gaps in nominal paradigms is given in Zaliznjak 1967b (3.4): 99f. 3 Zaliznjak 1967b (2.22): 90.</page><page sequence="533">CHAPTER 3.2: TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 5 1 1 As to the singular ia tantum, examples of which are kartófel' kartóãka and dobro,1 Zaliznjak points out that they are all defective '. Thus, in his opinion, the singulare tantum láj ('barking') can be manipulated into a plural lái which, then, indicates differ- ent kinds of barking.2 Thus, there are no "real" singularia tantum in Russian. The matter is more complex for the pluralia tantum. According to Zaliznjak, the majority are defective2- This implies that the forms of sani ('sleigh')3 are homonymous for singular and plural. This morphosyntactic homonymy goes further than the mor- phological homonymy of metro. Adjectivais which modif iy metro distinguish singular and plural; consider: (3/2/27/1) béloe metrò 'white subway' (3/2/27/2) bèlve metrò 'white subways' But adjectivais to sani always show plural agreement: (3/2/27/3) bélye sanising 'white sleigh' (3/2/27/4) bélye sánipiur 'white sleighs' This approach implies that the paradigm of sani is represented in the nominative sin- gular case-number class and belongs to a separate C-family with respect to that class: the adjectival agreement of sani as a nominative singular is different from that of any other nominative singular C-family. Compare, say, (3/2/27/3) with (3/2/25/3), (3/2/25/7) and (3/2/25/11). This applies to all other cases of the singular as well. The above implies, in turn, that sani belongs to a separate G14-class, which must be added to list (3.2.25.6). Zaliznjak adduces some interesting additional justification for this approach. Cer- tain adjectivais occur only with singular nouns. Consider káídyj ('each', 'every') and odin Cone'). These adjectivais have special plural endings which occur only with plu- ralia tantum. Thus, the compatible pairs (3/2/27/6) to (3/2/27/9) below must be consid- ered grammatical, whereas the compatible pairs (3/2/27/10) and (3/2/27/11) are re- jected. (3/2/27/6) kázdyjgórod 'each town' (3/2/27/7) kázdve sani 'each sleigh' (3/2/27/8) odinonegorod 'one town' (3/2/27/9) odnw sani 'one sleigh' (3/2/27/10) *kázdye gorodá 'every towns' 1 Cf. §3.2.18. 2 Zaliznjak 1964 {4&gt;. 32, footnote 10. 3 Cf. §3.2.18.</page><page sequence="534">5 1 2 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS (3/2/27/1 1) *odníone gorodá 'one towns' In order to qualify (3/2/27/11) as ungrammatical, the meaning 'only towns' must be ruled out for it: Zaliznjak reckons that the use of odin for 'only' and 'alone', as in (3/2/27/12) My ostális' odni. 'we were left on our own1 represents a separate lexical meaning.1 From a morphosyntactic viewpoint, Zaliznjak's additional evidence is not conclu- sive. The assumption that odin and káídyj have no plural turns them into defective paradigms (of whatever type). As a result, Zaliznjak's line of argument amounts to dis- proving the defectiveness of an apparently defective paradigm by assuming the de- fectiveness of an apparently complete paradigm. This is not to dispute the content of Zaliznjak's observations and conclusions, but only to express doubt as to its distribu- tional basis. Zaliznjak's arguments are more convincing in a semantic approach. It seems to make sense that odin (when meaning 'one') implies the meaning of the singu- lar: it follows that the use of the plural form odni (when meaning 'one') is limited to plu- ralia tantum, so that there is no opposition between its singular and plural forms. But even here there are problems. Consider the situation in Czech, where the sin- gular and plural forms of jeden Cone') can be combined with the same noun: (3/2/27/13) jednasirka 'one match' (3/2/27/14) jednésirky 'one matches', i.e. 'one packet of matches', 'matches once' In Russian, such usage is traditionally subject to lexical restriction. Certain nouns, such as dás ('hour'), have plurals which may be used with odni when they express a lexically determined collective meaning: the plural dasy means 'clock' besides 'hours', and is, then, usually treated as a separate lexical item. (3/2/27/15) odnione Casy 'one clock' But in certain varieties of colloquial Russian, such as the one spoken by an informant of the present writer, the Russian situation is identical to the Czech one. Here we find (3/2/27/16) odnáspí õka meaning 'one match' besides 'only a match'; (3/2/27/17) odni spíõki meaning 'one packet of matches' besides 'only matches'.2 Thus, the semantic correlate of the opposition between singular and plural seems to be independent of that of odin and cannot be used as evidence for plurale tantum status. 1 Zaliznjak 1967b (2.21): 84. 2 And, consequently, the present writer's informant uses collective numerals to order two or three packets of matches: {3/2/27/ 1 8) dvóe spíôek 'two packets of matches'</page><page sequence="535">CHAPTER 3.2: TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 5 1 3 However, the feasibility of Zaliznjak's treatment of the meaning of grammatical categories does not affect his model. Semantic decisions enter his model through the case-number classes, which are considered given. The decision to bar the context (odn/one,X) (3.2.27.1) from the nominative plural case-number class belongs in the base component of Za- liznjak's model: it is not new evidence for the singularness of sani but only a corollary of the decision to regard sani as a singular noun. As additional supporting evidence for his treatment of the pluralia tantum Zaliznjak adduces the fact that the pluralia tantum of the sani type are obligatorily accompa- nied by the collective numerals. One cannot combine dvá or dvé with a form of sani: the only correct way of saying 'two sleighs' is: (3/2/27/19) dvóesanéj This evidence only serves to show that pluralia tantum such as sani make up a sepa- rate agreement class. It does not prove that sani is homonymous for singular and plu- ral. The decision about the latter issue is made outside the present model, when it is decided which compatible pairs belong to which case-number classes. But once it has been decided that sani can be singular, it is more comfortable that the new agreement class G14(sám) be based on contexts such as (3.2.25.4) admitting sanding and not hinge on peripheral contexts such as (3.2.27.1) or (kázdye, ') (3.2.27.2) 'each, plural' (dvóe, X) (3.2.27.3) 'two, collective' The additional evidence is only necessary to corroborate a separate agreement class for pluralia tantum if Zaliznjak's thesis on the homonymy of sani is rejected: in that event, the exclusive occurrence of the pluralia tantum in (3.2.27.1), (3.2.27.2) and (3.2.27.3) yields unique distribution of plurale tantum nouns for the nominative and genitive plural. (Note that Revzin's interpretation of Zaliznjak's gender would have yielded a separate G8-class for pluralia tantum even without these contexts.) Zaliznjak does not consider all pluralia tantum to belong to the sani type. There are also pluralia tantum which are defective i, i.e. their lexical meanings restrict the oc- currence of singular forms. He mentions iniciály ('initials'). Also, there are pluralia tantum which belong to the sani type (i.e. are defective2&gt;, but are singularia tantum with defect i venessi within this type. An example is temila ('ink'), which has plural in- flexion and plural agreement while its meaning does not easily give rise to plural use, although plural use is, in principle, possible ('various inks'). Zaliznjak does not provide examples of pluralia tantum with defect i venessi within pluralia tantum with defective- ness2- So far, Zaliznjak's reinterpretation of defective paradigms does not differentiate the results of Revzin's (G8) and the present writer's (G14) interpretations of his model. But Zaliznjak also recognizes a group of "real" pluralia tantum, with defectivenesss. He lists as such moîodoiëny ('newly-weds'), roditeli ('parents') and rebjáta ('lads', 'boys',</page><page sequence="536">5 1 4 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS '"kids"').1 The existence of real defective paradigms is explained in morphological terms. Zaliznjak argues that there are no semantic obstacles for the singular because singular functions are in fact found for such words in Z-phrases: (3/2/27/20) odin iz molodozènov 'one (masculine) of the newly-weds' Thus, if the Russians had a singular form of molodoïëny, they would use it. It may be questioned whether the circumscription test suffices. The fact that all real pluralia tantum listed by Zaliznjak share the semantic property of referring to groups of persons of different sexes, either necessarily (molodoiëny) or potentially (rebjáta' favours a semantic barrier: the singular gender distinctions impose a speci- fication for sex, whereas the lexical meaning of the word exploits the lack of sex dis- tinction in the plural. On the other hand, the sex position of rebjáta does not seem to be much different from that of siróty ('orphans'), which does possess singular forms. The problem is that semantic defectivenessj and morphological defectivenessa will at least partly overlap: a language is more likely to tolerate morphological barriers to the formation of certain categories where the need to employ these categories is small. Zaliznjak implies this situation when he remarks on the short forms of the ad- jective that being a relational adjective is not enough to ensure the lack of short forms, but that the (all but exclusively) relational adjectives with stems ending in sk- never have short forms.2 This does not imply that all defective paradigms are subject to semantic limitations: there is no semantic reason why just the genitive plural of mgìa Chaze') is not in use. The position of pluralia tantum will be returned to in §4.6.21, where Gladkij's treatment is discussed. The solution to these particular problems, however, does not affect the model itself. The fact is that Zaliznjak's reinterpretation of singularia and pluralia tantum, by admitting a number (however small) of "real" pluralia tantum, does not result in the complete disappearance of defective paradigms. More generally, his corroboration of defectiveness3 implies that there is no constraint which stipulates that paradigms are necessarily complete. This implies that G14-classes can overlap. In fact, Zaliznjak's real pluralia tantum of the molodo¿eny type make up the intersection of all animate agreement classes (viz. G14(ofec), G14(/icd), G14tóe/]á), G14(s/roté) and Gì4(Simpanzé)l This result is not fully sat- isfactory insofar as the above discussion suggests that molodoïëny is more closely related to sirotá than to otéc. This problem will be returned to in §3.2.29. S 3.2.28 Zaliznjak's agreement classes: complementary defectiveness (Gis) Like Marcus' model of abstract gender', Zaliznjak's model of agreement class1 does not, mathematically, exclude possible redundant genders caused by paradigms which are defective for different case-number classes.3 This situation has been ruled out for Russian with respect to singularia and pluralia tantum by the elimination of real 1 Cf.

But there are defectives paradigms of other types which bring along unintended genders. Consider mglá, which possesses no genitive plural, and drovéc ('firewood'), which has only a genitive plural. Their paradigms cannot be united into one G14-class with, say, P(reká). This implies that there are at least two feminine inanimate agreement classes: one including mglá and excluding drovéc, the other ex- cluding mglá and including drovéc. This inconvenience can be removed by the assignment of a catalyst: a noun with perfect agreement, which is represented in all case-number classes. (This is not pos- sible in Marcus' model of abstract gender1, which does not have case-number classes.) The set WT of nouns with perfect agreement is defined as follows. Vf*={w'weWh A P(u&gt;)nW(C)*j&amp;} (3.2.28.1) CeC Set WT contains all words except defective paradigms. The words in WT are the cata- lysts for the agreement classes of the remaining words. The revised agreement class G15dü) of a catalyst w in WT unites the G14-classes to which w belongs: Gi5(w) = {W | w' g W A V (vf e G14 A w e G14) } (3.2.28.2) G14eG14 Thus, reká is a catalyst, since it is represented in all case-number classes. Mglá and drovéc are not catalysts as they are not represented in certain case-number classes. Gi5(reká) unites all G 14-c lasses containing reká, i.e. the one which includes mglá and excludes drovéc, and also the one that includes drovéc but excludes mglá. The re- vised definition continues to assign drovéc to all inanimate agreement classes and molodoïëny to all animate agreement classes. S 3.2.29 Zaliznjak's set of contexts Thus far, Zaliznjak's set of phrases has been restricted to structures of the type ADJECTIVAL + NOUN. Zaliznjak also considers the results of the model for a larger set of phrases, viz. the set which contains all instances of agreement connection (soglasovateVnaja svjaz'). This concept is characterized, in a somewhat circular fash- ion, as: *[...] any syntactic connection (either direct or through other words) between a noun and an adjectival {slovo-attribut) in which the choice of the adjectival {segment slova-attributa) depends on the choice of the noun and (or) of its grammatical form.1 The set of instances of agreement connection is not the complete set of relevant phrases: it quite explicitly excludes phrases of the type NOUN + VERB, which also show agreement phenomena in the preterite.2 The new set of phrases provides Z-contexts3 of the type 1 Zaliznjak 1964 (3)29; 1967b (2.16): 69. 2 Cf. the discussion on (2.2.6.6). Revzin's interpretation of Zaliznjak's contexts in fact refers to the complete set of contexts.

Zaliznjak points out that, at least as far as Russian is concerned, the results of his model for the expanded set of contexts coincide with those for the original set. It can be added that the results are in fact even improved. It was pointed out in §3.2.27 that the only dissatisfactory result of the revised model (G15) is its handling of the molodozëny group: it is allotted equally to all animate genders. This result is amended when the present expanded set of contexts is considered: the context (X, odná iz kotóryx iz Dél'fta, a drugój iz Kaliningráda) (3.2.29.5) 'one (feminine) of whom is from Delft, and the other (masculine) from Kaliningrad' admits only words from G15(sirofa) and G^Simpanzé) and the molodoïëny group, so that molodozëny can no longer be allotted to other animate agreement classes. But Zaliznjak's main reason for expanding his set of contexts is that the identifica- tion of agreement classes is no longer the result of the examination of complete or- dered paradigms: Z-contexts show the agreement class of a noun for any of its case- number forms. Compare the following dative singular contexts. (já podoèël k tornii X) (3.2.29.6) 'I went to that' (Já podoèël k tornii kotóryj já uvídet) (3.2.29.7) 'I went to that', 'which I saw' {já podoèël k tornú, kotórogo já uvídeti (3.2.29.8) 'I went to that', 'which I saw' Context (3.2.29.6) admits only the dative singular of masculine and neuter nouns. The relative pronouns in (3.2.29.7) and (3.2.29.8) impose the gender distinctions of the accu- sative on the dative set which has already been obtained,1 and select masculine inanimate nouns and masculine animate nouns, respectively. The same applies to num- ber1: Z-contexts endow singular forms with plural agreement categories and plural forms with singular agreement categories (¿fa, X) (3.2.29.9) •that' (éta, bylá iz téx kotóryx vy vídeli) (3.2.29. 10) 'that', 'was one of those which you saw' Context (3.2.29.9) admits feminine singular nominatives; (3.2.29.10) admits only animate feminine singular nominatives.

Zaliznjak suggests that the establishment of agreement classes does not depend on the examination of the complete set of contexts, but that a small number of diagnostic contexts can be selected, from which the agreement class of a noun can be uniquely determined. But, as Revzin has pointed out,1 these diagnostic contexts can only be selected when it is already clear which classes are looked for, and these classes have, in turn, been derived for the complete set of phrases. So Zaliznjak's diagnostic phrases neither define nor determine agreement classes, but serve as a heuristic de- vice for determining to which of the preestablished agreement classes given words belong. § 3.2.30 Zaliznjak's constraint The use of Z-contexts as a heuristic tool implies a constraint, which stipulates that the agreement classes yielded for the complete set of case-number classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the C-families of each of the case-number classes taken separately:2 A A ( V ¥%»{) = ¥%V2&gt; =* V (lui e G A w2 e G)) (3.2.30.1) w'eW iu2eW CeC GeG15 The Russian material presented so far does not invalidate Zaliznjak's constraint. How- ever, the constraint is protected in two ways. 1 For the output of the derivations, a label without reality claims is used: instead of traditional animacy classes or genders, the model produces intersections of these classes, called agreement class. Animacy and gender1 are in fact yielded in differ- ent C-classes: the singular nominative determines 'gender1; the plural accusative determines animacy.3 The constraint would not be valid for each category consid- ered separately. This point will be returned to in §3.2.31. 2 The input set of phrases, i.e. the harp under consideratioa is limited to expressions which express agreement connection, i.e. contain modifiers and relative pronouns. The informal definition excludes verbal agreement. This excludes certain compli- cating cases in the fuzzy gender area.4 An example is presented below. Consider a group of traditionally masculine nouns denoting persons who exercise certain functions, such as vráõ ('physician') or tovártéõ ('comrade'), and which are to a certain extent amenable to feminine agreement when they refer to women. The exact degree to which this group takes feminine agreement varies between grammars. 1 Full Quotation is given in §3.3.14. 2 The constraint is similar to Revzin's fundamental thesis: cf. §2.2.1 Iff. 3 Revzina will utilize this circumstance: see §3.2.33. 4 Cf. §2.2.6 2.</page><page sequence="540">5 1 8 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS PeSkovskij, for example, states that, in the event of a female referent, nouns of the vráõ group allow feminine agreement for verbs but not for adjectives.1 The following phrase is an example.2 (3/2/30/1) VydajúSõijsja sovétskij uõènyj professor LepeSínskaja dokazála osíboõnost' étogo poloZénija. 'the outstanding Soviet scientist Professor Lepesinskaja proved the erroneousness of this thesis' Here the adjectives vydajúSõijsja ('eminent') and sovétskij ('Soviet') are masculine. The substantivized adjective uõenyj ('scientist'), which theoretically allows for a feminine ending,3 is masculine. It is in apposition to the masculine noun professor ('professor'), which belongs to the vráõ group. The verb form dokazála ('proved'), on the other hand, is feminine. For future reference, the variety of Russian which conforms to this rule is labelled PeSkovskij Russian. When phrases of the type NOUN + VERB are included in the H of PeSkovskij Russian, a separate gender is yielded for the vráõ group. More recently, Russian grammarians state that the use of feminine agreement with nouns of the vráõ group has progressed to adjectivais.4 In Bulanin's scheme, feminine agreement with vráõ is accepted in the nominative case of long forms of adjectives; however, feminine agreement never occurs in the oblique cases.5 The variety of Rus- sian which conforms to this observation will be called Bulanin Russian. Thus, for fe- male referents, both (3/2/30/2) and (3/2/30/3) below are found in the nominative, whereas only (3/2/30/4) is found in the genitive, (3/2/30/5) being considered ungram- matical.6 (3/2/30/2) molodójvráõ 'young (masculine nominative) doctor1 (3/2/30/3) molodájavráõ 'young (feminine nominative) doctor' (3/2/30/4) molodógo vraõá 'young (masculine genitive or accusative) doctor' (3/2/30/5) *molodúju vraõá 'young (feminine accusative) doctor1 The situation in Bulanin Russian would invalidate Zaliznjak's constraint: it implies that the oblique cases of the words of the vráõ group have the same distribution as the corresponding forms of oféc, whereas the nominative occurs in the same contexts as sirotá. Zaliznjak's constraint can be saved if it is assumed that vráõ is admitted by Z-con- texts with "mixed" agreement. Consider the following contexts: 1 PeSkovskij 19386 (10): 193. 2 Phrase (3/2/30/1) was found in Aleksandrov 1952a (1.7): 126-127. 3 Cf. the analogous substantivized adjective voíàtyj ('pioneer leader'), whose feminine form voiátaja is used in certain circumstances. 4 E.g. Muõnik 1971: 205ff. For details on feminine agreement for the vráõ group, see 4.6.62. 5 Bulanin 1976 (11): 52. 6 This is not to suggest that (3/2/30/2) and (3/2/30/3) are interchangeable. The present writer suspects that there is a semantic difference which is comparable to the difference which exists, in all grammatical cases, between voiátyj '('pioneer leader, masculine') and vozátaja ('pioneer leader, feminine') and which will be explored in §4.6.52.</page><page sequence="541">CHAPTER 3.2: TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 5 1 9 (zenílsja molodój, kotóraja tám rabótala) (3.2.30.2) 'the young (masculine nominative) married1, 'who (feminine) worked (feminine) there' (. . . svád'ba molodógo, kotóraja tám rabótala) (3.2.30.3) 'the wedding of the young (masculine genitive)', 'who (feminine) worked (feminine) there' If the nominative vráõ is admitted by (3.2.30.2), which excludes sirota, and if the geni- tive vraõá is admitted by (3.2.30.3), which excludes ofcá, then vráõ belongs to a sepa- rate C-family in each case-number class, and its group makes up a full-fledged agreement class in Zaliznjak's sense, which perfectly conforms to his constraint. But, even if we accept all of Zaliznjak's conditions, his constraint is possibly falsi- fied. Pedersen points to a group of nouns which includes the names of folk dances (gopák, 'hopak') and forms of deliberate short-lived physical contact (pinók, 'kick1, tumák, 'punch'), which assume an animate accusative with certain verbs.1 Mel'ouk points out that these nouns never yield animate accusatives of relative pronouns. Consider Mel'ouk's example:2 (3/2/30/6) Ón poluo íl takógo tumaká, kotóryj ón búdet pómnit' vsjú zízri. 'he received (such) a punch as he will remember all his life' Here tumaká ('punch') is usually taken to be an animate accusative of tumák ('punch'), in spite of its genitive form and non-animate referent,3 while kotóryj ('which') can only be an inanimate accusative form. For Zaliznjak's constraint, this implies that, although Fnom{tumák) coincides with Fnom(sad), where sád ('garden') is a typical inanimate masculine noun, the correspond- ing accusative families do not coincide: the context {ón poluo il takógo, kotóryj ón búdet pómnit' vsjú ¿ízn) (3.2.30.4) does not admit sád. Irrespective whether Zaliznjak's constraint is valid, detailed study takes us to the question of which contexts must be considered for the determination of agreement classes. It is possible to restrict the set of phrases under consideration to instances of attributive connection or agreement connection. In that case, however, not only the concepts of connection and part of speech must be accounted for, but it also turns out that the results are satisfactory to only a limited degree and are very language-spe- cific. It is possible to assume a separate agreement class for professions, another one for dances, and another one for punches, but it may be wondered whether the reality claims of such classes are comparable with the reality claims of the other agreement classes. Consider the following example from Dutch. 1 Pedersen 1907 (1.27): 153-154. 2 Example from Mel'ouk 1985 (Pril. II): 467. 3 Pedersen 1907 (1.27): 154. Mel'ouk [1985 (Pril. II): 487-488 (= note 1 1 to page 479)1 adduces a number of arguments why tumaká is not a genitive object: 1 not all masculine nouns which denote dances or forms of deliberate short-lived physical contact take this form; 2 there is no opposition with the accusative, in contrast to other instances of verbs taking a genitive ob- ject; 3 the accusative returns for numerals when the punches received are counted. Mel'éuk does not indicate what happens in the plural. Historically, however, tumaká is perhaps explained as a genitive. The now extinct genitive of temporary involvement, which was formerly used with many verbs, but especially with verbs indicating transfer of possessioa is a likely candidate.</page><page sequence="542">520 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS Dutch nouns are usually divided into two genders: common and neuter.1 Nouns which denote persons generally belong to the common gender, but diminutives tradi- tionally belong to the neuter gender. In urban speech, the diminutives of proper names have passed from the neuter into the common gender:2 (3/2/30/7) de kleine Jantje 'the (common) little John' But the situation is more complex for other diminutives denoting persons. Articles and adjectives always show neuter agreement with meisje ('girl'), but there is a variety of spoken Dutch in which neuter agreement for meisje does not extend to relative pro- nouns, so that a phrase like (3/2/30/8) Ik zag het meisje die daar Hep. 'I saw the (neuter) girl who (common gender) walked there* is grammatical for that variety of Dutch.3 Zaliznjak's model here yields a special animate neuter gender agreement class. It is possible to settle for this result, but the outcome obscures the fact that we are in fact dealing with two different types of agreement, viz. adjectival agreement and agree- ment of relative pronouns. Moreover, the factors which determine the two kinds of agreement do not necessarily coincide. Zaliznjak's model reveals only one kind of agreement for any set of phrases to which the model is applied. This implies that the model either operates on the complete set of phrases, to yield intersections of agree- ment classes rather than agreement classes, or presupposes a preliminary selection of the sets of phrases which are relevant for a specific system of agreement classes. But this takes us back to Revzin's criticism mentioned in the preceding section: prese- lection of subsets of phrases is useful as a heuristic device but circular as an answer to a K-question: (3/2/30/10) 'Gender' is what is yielded by the model for the set of phrases which are relevant for 'gender1. S 3.2.31 Zaliznjak's conception of 'gender' and animacy Taking the results of the preceding sections into account, Zaliznjak's revised gender model yields the following agreement classes for Russian. 1 For details, see §3.2.8. 2 At least in the Netherlands: in Belgium neuter agreement is normal. 0 The systematic character of this variety is not recognized by many speakers of the standard language, who ascribe (3/2/30/8) to lack of concentration. The variety comprises many idiolects in the region of The Hague and covers not only etymological diminutives such as meisje, which have no corresponding non- diminutives, but also productive diminutives. Cf.: (3/2/30/9) het mannetje die daar loopt 'the (neuter) little man who (common gender) walks there*</page><page sequence="543">CHAPTER 3.2: TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 52 1 G15(otec) masculine animate G l ^(górod) masculine inanimate G15(/icd) neuter animate G^ioknó) neuter inanimate G ì5{zenaì feminine animate G15(re/ca) feminine inanimate G15(sa7î/) plural inanimate G l5{sirotá) masculine-feminine common G^lSimpanzé) masculine-neuter-feminine common G15(vrá¿) professional Gl5(tumák) short-lived physical contact (3.2.31.1) Zaliznjak considers the label gender less appropriate for most of these classes, argu- ing that the difference between otéc and górod is not one of 'gender'. The label agreement class was introduced for that reason. It may be wondered what an agreement class represents. It corresponds to a com- bination of traditional word-class features, e.g. {MASC, ANIM} (3.2.31.2) These combinations of features are, conceptually, a variety of Revzin's categorial bundles. 1 And like Revzin's families, which do not model the features in the bundles themselves but only certain words corresponding to certain bundles of features of unknown internal composition, Zaliznjak's agreement classes do not provide any in- formation as to which word-class features correspond to which agreement classes. They do not even yield the relevant categories (dimensions) of word-class features. Zaliznjak proposes representing the G15-classes as being marked by features of two dimensions, which are labelled animacy and gender. Animacy contains features labelled animate and inanimate, 'gender' contains masculine, feminine, neuter and a feature for pluralia tantum of the sani group, labelled twin (parnyj). But neither the dimensions nor the features they contain are modelled. The assignment of the labels is language-specific and motivated by convenience: Hn other words, if it is convenient for the descriptioa we can represent a classificatory grammatical cat- egory as a collection of two or more such categories which are superimposed {nakladyvapSäijsja) on one another. It is understood that such a decomposition can be carried out in various manners, depending on the choice of the distinctive features.2 Note that Zaliznjak's category corresponds to what is called feature in the present study. His distinctive features correspond to what we call categories. Zaliznjak's features and categories are chosen so as to yield the following agree- ment class system. (The various common gender agreement classes are left out of consideration.) 1 Categorial bundles: §2.2.1 1. 2 Zaliznjak 1964 (5): 36.</page><page sequence="544">522 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS Fig. 3.2.31.1 Gl5(w) masculine feminine neuter twin 'gender' inanimate górod reká oknó sani animate otéc ' zená ' lieo ' - 'animacy' Thus, gender, masculine, feminine, etc., are regarded as extensional labels, which are available to be assigned to certain agreement classes in a language-specific manner, as motivated by convenience. This implies that gender' and the individual genders are not defined in the model. The model only serves to narrow down the use of the labels to agreement classes. 'Agreement class' itself is the only concept which the model de- fines: agreement class is an intensional label. Thus, we have arrived at a situation in which the set of phrases is extensionally manipulated in order to arrive at the intended agreement classes, while, subsequently, additional features must be extensionally assigned to the agreement classes in order to arrive at the intended genders and animacy classes. Revzina's proposals to simplify this state of affairs will be presented next. S 3.2.32 Revzina's modifications of Zaliznjak's model: differentiating subsets of phrases It seems reasonable to introduce, as a next step, the requirement that a model of word classes furnish criteria to distinguish different kinds of agreement. This does not necessarily imply that the model must define specific agreement classes, such as 'gen- der', let alone specific genders. But the model must define a concept which could be called agreement category and which includes (extensionally or intensionally) phe- nomena such as gender1 and animacy. In §3.2.30, it was shown that different agreement categories are reflected in dif- ferent contexts or parts of contexts. Dutch meisje is neuter with respect to adjecti- vais, but belongs, at least in certain speech varieties, to the common gender with re- spect to relative pronouns. It is only to be expected that no agreement categories are distinguished if the model is a simple %¿ model having no means to preselect different types of (parts of) phrases. But Zaliznjak's model in fact ceased to be a simple fy model when such undefined concepts as attributive connection and agreement con- nection were introduced. These concepts imply that the phrases in the complete set H are considered to possess certain distinguishable structures other than, or besides, linearity, and that these structures can be known. This knowledge was used to ex- clude from consideration phrases with finite verb forms which were likely to split some of the intended agreement classes if they were not removed. But this knowledge can also be used to differentiate among various types of contexts, and consequently to apply the model to each of the resulting subsets of contexts separately. Thus, if the set of Dutch contexts is split into attributive contexts and relative contexts, and Za- liznjak's model is applied to each subset separately, then two gender systems are ob- tained for the variety of Dutch which was adduced in §3.2.30: attributive gender, in</page><page sequence="545">CHAPTER 3.2: TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 523 which meisje is classified as neuter, and relative gender, in which meisje belongs to the common gender. Such a proposal was in fact put forward by Revzina. She distinguishes two subsets of relevant phrases:1 1 noun groups: ADJECTIVAL(S) + NOUN; 2 simple sentences: (TRANSITIVE) VERB + ADJECTIVE + NOUN. Revzina applies Zaliznjak's model to a large number of Slavic languages and indicates that, for Russian, the first set of phrases yields three agreement classes, which corre- spond to the masculine, neuter and feminine genders, whereas the second set splits these classes into the corresponding animate and inanimate classes. Revzina does not provide many details. The following situation seems to be implied. The animacy distinction is found exclusively in the accusative. Wherever the accu- sative has no separate ending, it is identical to the nominative for inanimate nouns and with the genitive for animate nouns. This pattern includes the adjectivais which make up noun groups with these nouns. Consequently, it is assumed that the instances of the accusative which are identical to the nominative or the genitive disappear as sepa- rate cases in an H which contains only noun groups. Since these are the only forms distinguishing animate and inanimate, the model will reveal only the traditional gen- ders of Russian if it is applied to a fragment containing only noun groups. (One may object that the interpretation of H as the set of noun groups does not in fact result in the disappearance of all phrases which are relevant for animacy. Words of the starSiná group are animate and masculine. They possess a separate accusative (starnimi), which is distinct from both the genitive istarãiny) and the nominative (starSiná), whereas their modifying adjectives (e.g. boïèoj, 'big') take the animate geni- tive-accusative ending (bol'èógo). In the actual models, however, this is not the case. When any of the models treated thus far is applied to noun groups only, the distribu- tion of the accusative starSinú coincides with that of the genitive starSiny: both forms admit the same, genitive, adjectival forms. Starnimi will simply be treated as a free variant of starSiny.) If the above interpretation of Revzina's conception of 'gender' and animacy is cor- rect, the position of the cases in the model presents a problem. If cases are not given in the base component, the problem of syncretism returns, which is unresolved at this stage: the models treated so far which do not consider 'case' given, produce additional genders for flexion classes with disparate syncretism.2 If, on the other hand, cases are given (as case-number classes), it is not possible to discard the accusative. Therefore, when a model operates on noun groups in order to define agreement classes including animacy, cases must be given so as to eliminate the effects of syn- cretism; on the other hand, when a model operates on noun groups in order to define 'gender' in its proper sense, cases must not be given so as to eliminate the accusative as a separate case wherever it does not have accusative agreement. So in fact we are dealing with two different models, with different base components. 1 Revzina 1966 (2b): 85. ¿ For a solution see §3.2.34.</page><page sequence="546">524 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS S 3.2.33 Revzina's modifications of Zaliznjak's model: differentiating subsets of cases In an earlier model from Revzina,1 the problem described at the end of the preceding section is avoided. Instead of the set of phrases, the set of cases is differentiated. Revzina's model of 'gender' is based on all case-number classes except the accusative classes; the model yielding the intersections of animacy and gender classes is based on all case-number classes. The disadvantage of this solution is the implicit introduction of yet another unde- fined concept. It is one thing to consider a set of case-number classes given; it is an- other thing to consider the labels of individual cases given, and to assume the exis- tence of a universal procedure to indicate which cases to manipulate in order to ob- tain agreement classes. In practice, the given sets of phrases in Revzina's models correspond to Zaliznjak's device of the diagnostic context: a nominative phrase is diagnostic for 'gender1, an ac- cusative phrase is diagnostic for animacy. But Revzin's objection continues to apply: cases which are indicative for 'gender' and animacy can only be identified when gen- der' and animacy are already known. As an answer to a K-question, the model contin- ues to be circular. The possibilities of fy gender' have not yet been exhausted. The next model offers a solution for the Russian syncretism problem and for part of the problem of disen- tangling gender1 and animacy for Russiaa even without extending base component % S 3.2.34 Mayoh's B-types (G16) In one of Mayoh's contributions to Set-theoretical linguistics, three types of gram- matical category are defined.2 Their labels {A-type, B-type, C-type) carry no reality claims with respect to traditional linguistic concepts. The A-types and C-types need no special attention: A-types mathematically coin- cide with Revzin's genders (G10),3 and C-types with V.A. Uspenskij's U-types.4 Mayoh states that his B-types coincide with Kulagina's K-classes (G2),5 but B-types are in fact an essentially different mathematical construct. B-types deserve more attention: while covering the same area of empirical interest as Zaliznjak's agreement classes, they are defined in a simpler way and without extending the base component with additional categories such as 'case' and number'. All models treated thus far in this chapter are derived from 5^ or its extensions and share the following property: they exploit the properties of various combinations of families and paradigms, the reason being that these combinations (e.g. in the form of PF-chains) bring to light that 1 Revzina 1964 (1): 62. 2 Mayoh 1967 (2): 844. 3 Cf. definition (3.2. 17.1). 4 Cf. definition (3.1.2.14). 5 Cf. definition (3.2.5.3).</page><page sequence="547">CHAPTER 3.2 TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 525 rç...] the gender of a word form arises at the intersection of its syntagmatic connections (i.e. concord and agreement) and its paradigmatic connections (i.e. the fact that a word belongs to a specific lexemeM It has been taken for granted in all models that families are defined independently from paradigms, as if in a ñ' model, and that the results are confronted with paradigms at a later stage. But, within the framework set by % there is a more straightforward way to integrate the syntagmatic and paradigmatic properties of word forms. Consider the following two properties, which are generally postulated for the concept of gender (or other word class systems). 1 'Gender is a category which characterizes lexical meanings, i.e. complete para- digms. 2 The gender of a noun is manifest in individual forms of its contexts. Because of property 1, it seems reasonable to examine the distributions of complete paradigms instead of the sums of the distributions of their individual members. This eliminates the problem of case syncretism, which occurs only within paradigms and does not interfere with the syntagmatic relations of complete paradigms. Property 2 implies that we must study the distribution of paradigms (i.e. lexical meanings) in con- texts which consist not of paradigms but of concrete word forms. These considerations turn a model of gender1 into a rather basic construction, which is developed naturally after the basic models which have been introduced so far, once the latter are formulated in terms of the different types of words introduced in §3.0.14. Families are officially defined in §2.2.5 as sets of words2 with identical dis- tribution in wordi contexts.2 But since no provisions were made for homonymy, they were actually defined for words4 with identical distribution in word3 contexts. U- types, on the other hand, were defined in §3.1.2 as sets of words5 with identical distri- bution in wordô contexts. What is in fact looked for as a definition of gender1, are sets of words5 in word3 contexts, i.e. of lexical meanings in word-form contexts. Mayoh's model of 'B-type' in fact provides these classes within the framework of base component % In defining the sets, one auxiliary definition is required: the P- contextual class KP(w) of word w contains the contexts which admit at least one ele- ment from the paradigm of word w3 KPiw) = {it | k e K A Hw) n W(fc) * 0} (3.2.34.1) Then the B-type G16(tü) of word w can be defined as follows. G16(iu) = {w' | w' e W A KPiw) = KP(w') } (3.2.34.2) Thus, the B-type of a word w contains the words the paradigms of which contain one or more words admitted by the set of contexts which admit one or more words from the paradigm of w. 1 Revzina 1966 (2): 83. 2 For the distinction of six conceptions of word. cf.

Each kind of defective paradigms represents a separate B-type. Thus: KP(säni) = {(2.2.7.4), (2.2.7.7), (2.2.7.8), (2.2.7.11), (2.2.7.16), (2.2.7.20), (2.2.7.23)} (3.2.35.3) In contrast to Zaliznjak's model, the present model does not distinguish between plu- ralia tantum with number homonymy of the sani type and real pluralia tantum. This is to be expected: the initial distinctive property of the words of the sani group is their occurrence in given case-number classes. Since Mayoh's base component does with- out case' and number', the difference between singular and plural which is supposedly syncretized in the sani group does not exist in Mayoh's languages. The two types of plurale tantum are nevertheless manifest for Russian in Mayoh's model because Za- liznjak's real pluralia tantum all happen to be animate (viz. the molodoiëny group1), and also because contexts (3.2.27.1), (3.2.27.2) and (3.2.27.3) do not admit real pluralia tantum, with plural meanings such as molodoiëny, but do admit sani. S 3.2.36 DP-tolerance classes (G17) and the transitive closure of P- dominance (G18) The unintended genders which arise as a result of the existence of defective paradigms can be removed by means of the relation DP of P-dominance among B- types, which is defined as follows. DP = {toi, w2) | u&gt;i e W A w2 € W A KP(w{) c KP(w2)} (3.2.36.1) As a notational convention, (wìt w2) e DP (3.2.36.2) may be written as u&gt;i -p~+ iü2 (3.2.36.3) The Russian noun material of §3.2.35 yields the P-dominance relation which is shown in the following graph. 1 Cf.

But a definition of gender1 is still missing: it seems impossible to decide which animate agreement classes are related to which inanimate agreement classes.2 The other results for animacy1 are also rather suspicious, however. Although the definition of animacy1 is intensional, its applicability to Russian seems very much a matter of chance, a success which cannot necessarily be repeated for other lan- guages. For Slovak, the transitive closure of DP-tolerance does not regularly reflect either the distinction between animate and inanimate or the distinction between per- sonal and impersonal.3 Besides, intensional definitions of 'gender' and animacy are not in order at this stage: what is sought is a way to arrange agreement classes into unspecified cate- gories, two of which happen to be labelled case and gender in Russian. It is not prob- able that this general principle is found in a construction like the transitive closure of DP-tolerance, if only because the number of such mathematical structures is limited, while there is no specific limit to the number of agreement class systems in a language (even though their number is likely to be small). Also, there is no reason why, of the three types of tolerance which can be derived from P-dominance, only one should possess reality claims and represent something linguistically relevant. The intuitions connected with agreement classes suggest that it is more likely that different types of agreement categories are related to different types of contexts rather than to differ- ent mathematical structures defined on the same (viz. linear) type of context. In this respect, Revzina's approach is quite natural. It was pointed out in §3.2.32 that her proposal to differentiate between different types of context in order to de- 1 Compare definition (2.2.25.4). 2 Unless, of course, Z-contexts are resorted to, which contain relative pronouns.

In the following sec- tion, it is shown what happens when the model of B-type is applied to Revzina's phrases. § 3.2.38 Application of Revzina's proposals to Mayoh's B-types In Revzina's model, cases were necessary to prevent the distorting effects of case syncretism, but at the same time they prevented the (intensional) removal of the accu- sative forms, which was essential for the distinction of gender' and animacy. In Mayoh's model, the problem of case syncretism is solved without reference to cases. Assume that K is limited to Zaliznjak's attributive connections, which are repre- sented by the following contexts. (to/SdJX) (3.2.38.1) 'large, masculine animate singular nominative* or 'large, masculine inanimate singular nominative' or 'large, masculine animate singular accusative' or 'large, feminine singular genitive' or 'large, feminine singular dative' or 'large, feminine singular instrumental' or 'large, feminine singular locative' (bol'Sógo, X) (3.2.38.2) 'large, masculine animate singular genitive' or 'large, masculine animate singular accusative' or 'large, masculine inanimate singular genitive' or 'large, neuter singular genitive* (bol'Sómu, X) (3.2.38.3) 'large, masculine animate singular dative' or 'large, masculine inanimate singular dative* or 'large, neuter singular dative' (boftim, X) (3.2.38.4) 'large, masculine animate singular instrumental' or 'large, masculine inanimate singular instrumental' or 'large, neuter singular instrumental' or 'large, animate plural dative' or 'large, inanimate plural dative' (bol'Sóm, X) (3.2.38.5) 'large, masculine animate singular locative' or 'large, masculine inanimate singular locative' or 'large, neuter singular locative' (bol'Sóe, X) (3.2.38.6) 'large, neuter singular nominative' or 'large, neuter singular accusative' (bol'Sája, X) (3.2.38.7) 'large, feminine singular nominative' (ftofiWM X) (3.2.38.8) 'large, feminine singular accusative* (bol'Sóju, X) (3.2.38.9) 'large, feminine singular instrumental' (borSie,') (3.2.38.10) 'large, animate plural nominative' or 'large, inanimate plural nominative' or 'large, inanimate plural accusative'</page><page sequence="553">CHAPTER 32: TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 53 1 (bol'Êíx,') (3.2.38.11) 'large, animate plural genitive1 or 'large, animate plural accusative' or 'large, inanimate plural genitive' (to/3/miX) (3.2.38.12) 'large, animate plural instrumental' or 'large, inanimate plural instrumental' The results for these contexts are as follows. KP(otéc) = KP(sád¡ = {(3.2.38.1), (3.2.38.2), (3.2.38.3), (3.2.38.4), (3.2.38.5), (3.2.38.10), (3.2.38.11), (3.2.38.12)} KP(õudóviSõe) = KP(oknó) = {(3.2.38.2), (3.2.38.3), (3.2.38.4), (3.2.38.6), (3.2.38.10), (3.2.38.11), (3.2.38.12)} KP(ïena) = KPirekaï = {(3.2.38.1), (3.2.38.4), (3.2.38.7), (3.2.38.8), (3.2.38.9), (3.2.38.10), (3.2.38.11), (3.2.38.12)} (3.2.38.13) Thus, the three traditional Russian genders are obtained. It was shown in §3.2.36 that the set of simple sentences splits them into animate and inanimate agreement classes (if provision is made for defective paradigms). So Mayoh's model of B-class1 yields the results which are intended for Revzina's modifications of Zaliznjak's model. A number of complications will not be worked out here. Nouns of the sirotá and Simpanzé groups make up separate B-types but, as they unite the features of the above B-types, they can be joined to them by the application of P-dominance. Some complications will be discussed in §4.6.3ff., when the dependency version of this model will be introduced. S 3.2.39 An overview of twin string gender models In this section, a schematic survey is provided of the models which have been intro- duced in this chapter. The models are classified by certain properties. These proper- ties do not always exhaust the differences between models, but they provide an overall impression. The superscript numbers in the survey refer to special properties which cannot be reflected by the pluses and minuses in the scheme. They are ex- plained below. The properties to which the signs in the scheme refer are the following. 1 + indicates that the classes which the model defines contain complete paradigms only: A A we G*P(w)cg (3.2.39.1) Ge G idgW - indicates that the classes which the model defines may contain fragments of paradigms . 2 + indicates that the classes which are defined in the model make up a partition of W. - indicates that the classes make up a system of tolerance classes or a set of sets with no special properties.</page><page sequence="554">532 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS 3 + indicates that the use of a chain (PF-chain, PFOchain) in the model is indispens- able. ± indicates that the use of a chain is convenient in the formal presentation of the model - indicates that chains are trivial in the model. 4 + indicates that the base component of the model contains auxiliary classifica- tions, such as case1 and 'number1. ± indicates that the model employs auxiliary classifications which are derived from the same base component, such as elementary grammatical category1. - indicates that the base component of the model is restricted to K¿. 5 + indicates that the model employs one or more primitive catalysts. ± indicates that the model employs derived catalysts. - indicates that the model does not employ catalysts.

(3) Revised K-classes and PF-classes differ only in the length of their chains. (4) The partition of Marcus' "concrete gender" is in fact only secondary, being the nucleus partition of a system of tolerance classes.</page><page sequence="555">CHAPTER 3.2 TWIN STRING GENDER MODELS 533 (5) The last amendment to Horecky's 'gender makes it mathematically equivalent to Revzin's interpretation of Zaliznjak's model. (6) In the model of 'kind1 and the transitive closure of DP-tolerance, the chains are not PF-chains or PFC-chains but S- and P-dominance chains. (7) In the first amendment to Revzin's model, the auxiliary classes are elementary grammatical categories. (8) In the second amendment to Revzin's model, the auxiliary classes are quasi-ele- mentary grammatical categories. (9) Zaliznjak's and Revzina's models differ only in their manipulation of the contexts. This distinction is not covered in the survey, since it does not concern the struc- ture of the model. (10) Revzina's manipulations of the set of contexts for Zaliznjak's model can be applied to Mayoh's model. But this does not affect its structure. (n) The essential difference between these models and the other ones is the position of paradigms: in Mayoh's models and its derivatives, the point of departure is the distribution of paradigms (i.e. lexical meanings); the other models depart from the distribution of separate word forms. S 3.2.40 Conclusions on twin string gender models Two types of conclusion can be drawn at this stage: technical conclusions concerning the structure of the models and conclusions on their linguistic relevance. Of course, the two types are interrelated. On the technical level, the following conclusions can be drawn. 1 The concept of PF-chain is largely irrelevant to gender modelling; it may be con- ceptually harmful inasmuch as it treats the syntactic and paradigmatic relations of a word form as interchangeable. 2 Catalysts are undesirable inasmuch as they implicitly or explicitly involve an ex- tension of the base component. Their introduction into the base component either entails an ad hoc extension of linguistic theory or defers their definition to an- other, unfeasible, model. 3 The same applies to a certain extent to case1 and 'number'. But, given the present linguistic approach to 'gender' as a category characterizing lexical items, the ne- cessity of their introduction may be questioned, since the results of the most so- phisticated model using 'case and number' are emulated by a model which does without given 'case and 'number1. From a linguistic viewpoint, the following conclusions can be drawn. 4 All models view 'gender as a selectional category: they exploit the restrictions which a language imposes on the compatibility of words and contexts. Depending on whether a semantic core (sex) is considered relevant to 'gender', genders are identified with agreement classes or are considered to make up a specific subsys- tem of agreement classes. By regarding 'gender' as a selectional category certain other conceptions 'gender' are ruled out, e.g. gender" as a semantic category or as a morphological category.</page><page sequence="556">534 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS 5 The models of gender' are in fact extensions of DobruSin's model of 'elementary grammatical category'; whereas the latter model operates on selectional restric- tions between word forms and word-form contexts, the models of this chapter ex- ploit the selectional restrictions between lexical items and word-form contexts. This rules out a view of 'gender' according to which 'gender' characterizes not lexi- cal items but combinations of lexical items with case or number features. The latter view is proposed by Wertz, who insists on distinguishing at least two different gender systems for singular and plural.1 He does not draw Mariczak's conclusion that it is inconsistent to posit one set of distinctions in the singular and another one in the plural without at the same time doing so for other grammatical categories in similar situations.2 Thus, in Manczak's consistent approach, the set of Latin cases is reduced in the plural, as dative and ablative always coincide there and can therefore be conflated. Wertz sets a limit to Manczak's practice by pre- scribing generalization of a distinction in spite of syncretism whenever one set of distinctions is an amalgamation of the other set. In Polish or Slovak, the only agreement distinction in the plural (personal vs. impersonal) does not correspond to any distinction in the singular, whereas the distinction between dative and ablative in Latin is provided in the singular and can therefore be considered syncretic in the plural. This matter is more complicated, however, because Wertz's criterion does not in all cases offer unique solutions. The problem will be returned to in §4.6.38ff. For the time being, it will be presumed that agreement classes do not split paradigms. 6 The most unsatisfactory aspect of the models is the set of contexts (or rather the set of phrases from which the set of contexts is derived). In all models, H is tacitly, or explicitly, assumed not to be the complete set of sentences, but a subset of it, or two or more subsets. Limitation, manipulation and fragmentation of the set of con- texts each time turned out to be necessary in order to obtain relevant results from an intuitive point of view. Thus, Zaliznjak uses relative clauses to expose cate- gories which have gone covert in certain cases,3 and Revzina limits H to a set of phrases with a special structure, in order to separate 'gender' from animacy.4 Yet, from a mathematical point of view, contexts have continued to be presented as strings of word forms which can only be differentiated according to their identi- ties and their lengths.5 Other subsets are accounted for in the base component on only an ad hoc basis. The most interesting classes that "flat" contexts of this type seem to offer are the intersections of various systems of agreement classes, such as that of 'gender' and animacy. But if the complete set of phrases is taken into ac- count, which is the logical consequence of this approach, fuzzy gender categories manifesting themselves in relative clauses may cloud the relevant distinctions within each category and provide a picture which bears little linguistic relevance.6 1 Wertz 1977 (3): 61-63. 2Manczakl956:119ff. 3 Cf. §3.2.29. 4 Cf. §32.38. 5 For length differentiation of contexts, cf. §2.2.27. 6 Cf. §3.2.30.

These options, which involve essential modifications of the base component, will be explored in Part 4.</page><page sequence="558">CHAPTER 3.3: TWIN STRING CASE MODELS S 3.3.1 Paradigmatic case modelling The available models of case1 which are based on 5!2 are less numerous than the mod- els of 'gender1, but show a greater structural variety. A major division is brought about by the domains of the definitions: case' is either defined as a system of classes of words or as a system of classes of contexts. It was pointed out in §2.3.8 that the choice is to a certain extent arbitrary because set systems over words which are based on the distribution of words in contexts can also be described in terms of the contexts which determine them, and vice versa. But sometimes one of the possible ways of presenting a state of affairs is preferred to the other if the resulting class system possesses additional special properties: e.g. if it is a partition, or involves the complete set of elements of the domain. For example, it will be shown that a model from Zaliznjak which is discussed in this chapter is nothing more than the kappa-family model of §2.3.3, defined on the set of diagnostic contexts as proposed by Zaliznjak. The only difference is that the model as discussed in this chapter defines all concepts directly in terms of the words which are admitted by the contexts concerned. Thus, there are few essential differences between the case models based on %2 and those based on flj. The newly introduced concept of paradigm is either employed as a secondary auxiliary concept, as in Zaliznjak's model, or creates the possibility to decide for which of the conceptions of 'word and 'context' introduced in §3.0.14 the concept of case' must eventually be defined. Words2 in wordi contexts were discuss- ed in Chapter 2.2; the results can be converted for words4 in word3 contexts, which were implicitly used in Chapter 2.3. But the introduction of paradigms, i.e. lexical meanings, provides the option of utilizing words5 and wordsç in the definitions. This option is exploited in Schwartz-Popa-Burcäfs and Trybulec's models. § 3.3.2 P-admission Marcus presents the oldest full-fledged case models based on Jk1 He proposes to uti- lize the concept of paradigm in order to eliminate certain inconveniences of Revzin's first case model (namely interference between 'case' and gender1).2 Marcus' models are based on a proposal from V.A. Uspenskij,3 which was in turn based on suggestions from Mel'ouk and DobruSin.4 V.A. Uspenskij's formulation allows for two non-equivalent formalizations. Hence Marcus' two models: of case' and of 'complete case. A novelty in these models is P-admission? which is introduced as an auxiliary con- cept: set WP(fc) of words P-admitted by context k is the set of words the paradigms of which contain words admitted by kß 1 Marcus 1963c (I* 586-602; Marcus 1967c (6.2-6.18): 197-212; Marcus 1970 (5.2-5.18): 209-228. 2 Cf. §2.3.8. 3 Uspenskij, V.A., 1957/1993 {21 1202-1204. 4 As stated in Uspenskij, V.A., 1957/1993 (2Y 1202.

Uspenskij and Marcus classify formal contexts by the lexical meanings which they admit.2 Here is an example: the Russian word zenój ('wife, instrumental singular') is P-ad- mitted by the context (já govorjú prot X) (3.3.2.2) 'I talk about' (takes the accusative) because P(zenój) contains the word zenú ('wife, accusative singular1), which is admit- ted by (3.3.2.2). The word v ('in'), on the other hand, is not P-admitted by (3.3.2.2), be- cause (3.3.2.2) does not admit any word from the paradigm of v. § 3.3.3 Marcus1 model of case1 (C1) Marcus' model of case1 requires concordance as another auxiliary concept besides P- admission: two contexts are concordant if: 1 there is at least one word which is P-admitted by both contexts (i.e. they admit the same lexical meaning), and 2 for each word which is P-admitted by both contexts, there is at least one form which is admitted by both contexts.3 Thus, set C°(k) of contexts which are concordant with a given context k is formally defined as follows. C°(/c) = [K I k' e K A WP(fc) n WP(fr') * 0 A A ?(w) n W(/c) n W(k') 5* 0} we WP(fc)nwP(fc') (3.3.3.1) For an example, consider context (3.3.2.2) and the contexts (já govorjú pro xoróSego, X) (3.3.3.2) 'I talk about a good (animate masculine accusative)' (já govorjú pro xoróSuju, X) (3.3.3.3) 'I talk about a good (feminine accusative)' models are described in terms of increasing sophistication. It just shows that a discipline does not neces- sarily develop along the lines of increasing sophistication. More examples of this will be found in Part 5: see, in particular, §5.38. 6 Set W(fc), where k is a context (h' , h2), was defined in (2.2.3.2). 1 Cf. definition (3.2.34.1) of KP(w) in Mayoh's model. 2 Marcus [1967c (6.2): 197; 1970 (5.2): 209] refers to WP(fc) as words admitted (dopustimyj) by k, and to W(fc) as words directly admitted (neposredstvenno dopustimyj) by fc. There is a printing error in 1967c (6.2): 197, line 14: "un mot a est admis . . ." must be "un mot b est admis . . .". 6 These conditions are found in, e.g., Marcus 1967c (6.9): 201f. V.A. Uspenskij [1957/1993 (2): 1203] speaks of immediately equivalent (neposredstvenno èkvivalentnyj) contexts (although concordance is not an equivalence relation), but, due to an ambiguity in V.A. Uspenskij's verbal definition (he does not make clear whether the sets of words from two paradigms which are admitted by a context must overlap or coin- cide in order to be equivalent), this term may also correspond to Marcus' complete concordance (see defini- tion (3.3.4.1)).</page><page sequence="560">538 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS Context (3.3.2.2) P-admits iena, otéc ('father'), etc.; context (3.3.3.2) P-admits otéc, but not iena-, context (3.3.3.3) P-admits iena, but not otéc. It is obvious that (3.3.2.2) € C°(3.3.3.2) (3.3.3.4) because there is a word otéc which is P-admitted by both (3.3.2.2) and (3.3.3.2), and there is, for all words which are P-admitted by (3.3.2.2) and (3.3.3.2), a form which is admitted by (3.3.2.2) and (3.3.3.2). For otéc, this form is otcá. Also, (3.3.2.2) g C°(3.3.3.3) (3.3.3.5) because there is a word iena which is P-admitted by both (3.3.2.2) and (3.3.3.3), and there is, for all words which are P-admitted by (3.3.2.2) and (3.3.3.3), a form which is admitted by (3.3.2.2) and (3.3.3.3). For iena, this form is ienú. But: (3.3.3.2) € C°(3.3.3.3) (3.3.3.6) because the lexical items admitted by (3.3.3.2) and (3.3.3.3) do not coincide.1 This shows that concordance is not an equivalence relation. Marcus' case1 is subsequently defined as the transitive closure of concordance.2 Thus, the Crease CKk) of a context k is defined as follows. C1*) = {k' | k' g K A V A (ki&lt;= C°(fci-i) A k' = k' A kn = k) } (3.3.3.7) {fcl kn}cK [&lt;i*n Thus, contexts (3.3.3.2) and (3.3.3.3) belong to the same Cucase since they are con- nected by a concordance chain via context (3.3.2.2). Creases constitute a partition over the set of contexts. Marcus' model of case' is discussed in §3.3.5, jointly with his model of complete case1, which is presented in the following section. S 3.3.4 Marcus* model of 'complete case' (C2) Marcus' definition of complete case1 is identical to his definition of case, but is based on a different definition of concordance. Two contexts are completely concordant if: 1 there is at least one word which is P-admitted by both contexts (i.e. if they admit the same lexical meaning), and if: 2 for each word which is P-admitted by both contexts, the same forms are admitted by both contexts.3 Thus, set Cco{k) of contexts which are completely concordant with a given context k is formally defined as follows. 1 In order to keep the exemplification simple, words of the sirotá group are considered homonymous in the sense of Zaliznjak (cf. §3.2.25). ¿ Transitive closure is the term used in the present study (cf. § 1.1.15). In Marcus 1967c (6.17): 209, the specific transitive closure of concordance is labelled congruence. In Marcus 1967c (6.18): 210, congruence classes are identified with cases. In V.A. Uspenskij's [1957/1993 (2): 12031 terminology, words belonging to the same Crease are absolutely equivalent [absoljutno èkvivalentnyj}, due to an ambiguity in one his verbal definitions, this term may also refer to C^ase', which will be defined in (3.3.4.7). 3 Marcus 1967c (6.10): 203.</page><page sequence="561">CHAPTER 3.3: TWIN STRING CASE MODELS 539 Cco(fc) = {k' | k' € K A WP(fc) n WP(fc') * 0 A A ?(w) n W(/c) = P(n;) n W(fc') * fd] (3.3.4.1) iue WP(fc)nWP(fc') Complete concordance implies concordance but the converse does not hold.

From the paradigm of õáj, the genitive I õája is admitted by both (3.3.4.2) and (3.3.4.3), whereas the genitive II õáju is admitted by (3.3.4.3) but not by (3.3.4.2). This implies that (3.3.4.2) and (3.3.4.3) are concordant because Hàáj) n W(3.3.4.2) n W(3.3.4.3) = {õája} *8 (3.3.4.4) But (3.3.4.2) and (3.3.4.3) are not completely concordant, because Hàáj) n W(3.3.4.2) = { õája } * { õája, õáju } = P(õáj) n W(3.3.4.3) (3.3.4.5) Contexts which are both concordant and completely concordant are, say, (3.3.2.2) and (3.3.3.3), which admit the same form of all words that they both P-admit.2 Like concordance, complete concordance is not an equivalence relation. Marcus defines his complete case1 as the transitive closure of complete concordance.3 Thus, the complete (C2-)case C^k) of a context k is defined as follows. C2(k) = {k' | k' € K A V A (fci g ccofti-i) A Iti = k' A kn = k)} (3.3.4.7) {fcl,...,fcn}cK Ki*n C2-cases constitute a partition over the set of contexts. Contexts (3.3.2.2), (3.3.3.2) and (3.3.3.3) belong to the same complete (C2-)case, as well as to the same Crease. § 3.3.5 Discussion of Marcus* case models: case syncretism As early as 1957,4 V.A. Uspenskij pointed out the drawbacks of Marcus' case models, which arise as a result of two types of syncretism: case syncretism and context syn- cretism. The former type is treated in this section, the latter is discussed in §3.3.6. Marcus' case models handle interference on the part of 'gender' correctly: contexts (3.3.3.2) and (3.3.3.3) are accommodated in one case, whereas Revzin's ^-based case 1 Contexts (3.3.4.2) and (3.3.4.3) are identical to (2.3.5.2) and (2.2.7.8). resnectivelv. 2 Thus, the present writer does not share Kiefer's [1968 (2.7): 48] conjecture that Marcus' distinction of two types of concordance reflects the distinction between semantic and grammatical correctness of phrases. 3 Transitive closure is this the term used in the present study (cf. § 1.1.15). Marcus defines the specific transitive closure of complete concordance in 1967c (6.17): 209 as complete congruence. In Marcus 1967c (6.18): 210, complete congruence classes are identified with complete cases. 4 I.e. long before Marcus published the formalization of V.A. Uspenskij's [1957/1993 (2): 1202-12041 sketch on which the present presentation is based.</page><page sequence="562">540 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS model assigns such contexts to different cases.1 But Marcus1 approach is not up to the combination of 'gender' and case syncretism. Consider the following contexts. {já govorjú pro boVèój, X) (3.3.5.1) 'I speak about a large (inanimate masculine)1 (¿st' X) (3.3.5.2) 'there is' {èst' bol'Sój, X) (3.3.5.3) 'there is a large (masculine)' Context (3.3.5.1), commonly said to admit the accusative, and context (3.3.5.3), said to admit the nominative, are concordant (and completely concordant) because they admit the same forms of all words P-admitted by either context. Thus, for sád ('garden'), which syncretizes these cases: Pisad) n WÖ.3.5.1) = Pisad) n WÖ.3.5.3) = {sád} (3.3.5.4) Since (3.3.5.1) is also (completely) concordant with (3.3.2.2), and (3.3.5.3) with (3.3.5.2), the overlapping (complete) concordance classes of (3.3.5.1) and (3.3.5.3) provide a bridge between nominative and accusative which unites these traditional cases into single C1- and C2-classes. V.A. Uspenskij proposes to dispense with these instances by banning contexts con- taining adjectivais from the set of contexts under consideration.2 Kiefer rejects this solution, doubting the feasibility of a formal procedure to this effect.3 But Revzin in fact provides an almost nearly adequate procedure when he proposes to deal with gender interference in his own model by eliminating contexts which do not admit all paradigms of a given part of speech. Contexts (3.3.5.1) and (3.3.5.3) are then eliminated, since they admit only masculine nouns and are thus prevented from establishing unin- tended bridges between nominative and accusative.4 This procedure works to the extent part of speech1 can be modelled adequately on ife.5 It would not of course work if two cases would admit exactly the same forms of all nouns. Thus, the underlying as- sumption is that, if nouns of all genders employ the same forms for two contexts, these contexts belong to the same case, which is quite plausible.6 S 3.3.6 Discussion of Marcus' case models: context syncretism Context syncretism occurs when a context can admit two or more case forms. Unex- pected concordance chains are yielded here, which unite intended cases into larger Ciciasses, while splitting intended cases into smaller G2-classes. An instance is 1 Cf. §2.3.7. 2 Uspenskij, V.A., 1957/1993 (2): 1203. 3 Kiefer 1968 (2.7): 48. 4 This proposal will be discussed in §3.3.13. 5 But cf. Chapter 3.0. 6 Kiefer remarks that the elimination of adjectives would not help for Hungarian, because they do not take case endings. This is beside the point: if adjectives do not take case endings, their removal does not do any harm, as it does not entail loss of any information which is indicative for case. At any rate, adjectives would not be removed by Revzin's procedure, because contexts containing them would not exclude any groups of nouns. See §3.3.16 for the nature of the problems that such languages as Estonian or Hungarian present for case modelling.</page><page sequence="563">CHAPTER 3.3: TWIN STRING CASE MODELS 54 1 [jáneviiu,') (3.3.6.1) 'I do not see* which takes accusative and genitive (both I and II).1 Context (3.3.6.1) admits the same paradigms as (3.3.2.2) and (3.3.4.3).

Consequently, they belong to the same C^class. But, since ?(¿ená) n WÖ.3.2.2) = {¿enú} * ?(¿ená) n W(3.3.4.3) = {¿eny} (3.3.6.7) H¿ená) n W(3.3.2.2) = { ¿enú } * ?(¿ená) n WÍ3.3.6. 1) = { ¿eny ¿enú } (3.3.6.8) ?(¿ená) n WÍ3.3.4.3) = {¿eny} * ?{¿ená) n WÍ3.3.6.1) = {¿eny, ¿enú} (3.3.6.9) i.e. since each of the contexts admits a different selection from the paradigm of ¿enát none of them is completely concordant with the others. As a result, the three contexts belong to different Ciciasses. So, both Marcus' model of case1 and his model of complete case yield unsatisfacto- ry results. The result becomes even less satisfactory if the empty context is consid- ered, which P-admits almost any noun and admits most forms of each paradigm:2 The empty context unites most contexts into a single C*-class, and makes up an indepen- dent C2-class. V.A. Uspenskij here proposes to eliminate from the set of contexts under consid- eration those which admit more than one form from a paradigm.3 This assumes that singular and plural can be regarded as determining separate paradigms, and that provisions can be made for paradigms containing doublet forms, such as professor (professor', plural nominative professora and proféssoryl reká ('river', singular accu- sative rekú and réku) and all nouns with singular nominative on -a/-ja, which have a singular instrumental on either -q//-e/or -ojuf-eju. As a result of this elimination proposal and the one in the previous section, H will contain only contexts which admit exactly one form from each paradigm within a given part of speech. This leaves the majority of contexts caseless: the corresponding K-questions cannot be answered. Of course, solutions can be developed which expand the results for the restricted set of contexts over the remaining contexts by means of 1 Context (3.3.6.1) is identical to (2.3.5.9); cf. §2.3.5 for more examples. 2 Except for the locative forms, which occur only in combination with certain prepositions: cf. §2.2.4. á Uspenskij, V.A., 1957/1993 (2&gt;. 1203-1204.</page><page sequence="564">542 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS the words which are admitted by the former contexts. In this approach, Marcus1 case models are, after the application of V.A. Uspenskij's limitations, no more than varieties of Revzin's sets of case-forming contexts, which serve as the input of the models of 'token case1 and cleared case discussed in §2.3.9 and §2.3.11. As such, they need no special attention here. S 3.3.7 Schwartz-Popa-Burcä's case models: their general principle The Romanian mathematician Schwartz-Popa-Burcä presents two models of case1,1 which are based on Trybulec's concept of U-equivalence.2 The models define case' as a partition of the set of words. The following presentation of the models is mathemati- cally equivalent to Schwartz-Popa-Burcä's and Trybulec's presentations but differs from the latter in that P-images for contexts are employed as an auxiliary concept.3 This facilitates comparison of Schwartz-Popa-Burcä's models with V.A. Uspenskij's U- types4 and Mayoh's B-types.5 It was pointed out in §3.0.14 that P-images of phrases are in fact strings of lexical meanings (i.e. of wordsô). V.A. Uspenskij's U-types were based on the distribution of type lexical meanings (i.e. words5&gt; in token lexical meanings (i.e. words6&gt;. Mayoh's B- types, on the other hand, were based on the distribution of lexical meanings (i.e. wordsö) in token word forms (words3&gt;; Marcus' and V.A. Uspenskij's P-admission6 is based on the occurrence of token word form (i.e. word3&gt; contexts in combination with lexical meanings (i.e. wordss). Schwartz-Popa-Burcä's models, in turn, are based on the distribution of word forms (i.e. words^ in token lexical meaning (i.e. worc^) contexts. The rationale of Schwartz-Popa-Burcä's choice to explore the relation between word forms and P-images of contexts as a base for case' is the following. In the distri- butional approach, the case of a word is assumed to depend on certain other words in their contexts, but is also assumed to be independent of the concrete form of the words of the contexts. Thus, the government properties of a verb do not change with the form of the verb. The context (ón ovladéet,') (3.3.7.1) 'he will seize* takes the instrumental the verb ovìadéV Cseize') continues to do so in all of its forms. On the other hand, interference on the part of gender phenomena is ruled out if the model does not take the word forms in the contexts into account, but restricts itself to lexical items. This is illustrated by the following examples. (já víin xorôSij, X) (3.3.7.2) 'I see a good (masculine inanimate)' (já vííu xoróSuju, X) (3.3.7.3) 'I see a good (feminine)' Contexts (3.3.7.2) and (3.3.7.3) have the same P-image, viz. 1 Schwartz-Popa-Burcä 1971. 2 Trybulec 1967b (3&gt;. 142. See also §3.3.10. 3 Cf. definitions (3.0.13.7) and (3.1.2.3). 4Cf.§3.1.2ff. 5Cf.S32.34ff. b P-admission: §3.3.2.</page><page sequence="565">CHAPTER 3.3: TWIN STRING CASE MODELS 543 (?(jâí?(vídef)?(xoróSij' X) (3.3.7.4) T, 'see', 'good' or: (&lt;já&gt; &lt;vídet'&gt; &lt;xoróSij&gt;, X) (3.3.7.5) Thus, the choice of the forms of xoróSij does not affect the distribution of the possible objects of the sentences. The P-context admits both masculine {sad, 'garden') and feminine (iena, 'wife') nouns and is therefore insensitive to gender1. This offers a short cut compared to Revzin's and Marcus' models, where special precautions had to be devised to remove gender interference. S 3.3.8 Schwartz-Popa-Burcä's model of 'case' (C3) Schwartz-Popa-Burcä's "weak" model defines case1 as the transitive closure of the relation of substitutability tolerance of the set of word forms with respect to the set of P-contexts.1 In the formalization that follows below, certain auxiliary concepts are convenient. P-contexts make up a feature system for the set of word forms. Set K?(w) contains the P-contexts that admit a given word form u*2 K?(w) = {k? | k? e K? A V (fcp= k?(k) Ake K(w))} (3.3.8.1) keK Schwartz-Popa-Burcä defines what is called substitutability tolerance in the present study3 under the label weak distributional concordance.4 The weak distributional con- cordance class C°(u;) of a word w is defined as follows. CPiw) = {w' | w' e W A K?(w) n K?(w') * 0} (3.3.8.2) Thus, otcá ('father, singular genitive or accusative') and ¿end are weakly distribu- tionally concordant because there is a P-context (?(võerá)?(já)?(vídet')?(xorôèij' X) (3.3.8.3) 'yesterday' T 'see' 'good' which admits otcá through the context (võerá já videi xoróSego, X) (3.3.8.4) 'yesterday I saw a good (singular masculine animate accusative)* and admits ¿end through the context (võerá já videi xoróSuju, X) (3.3.8.5) 'yesterday I saw a good (singular feminine accusative)' because contexts (3.3.8.4) and (3.3.8.5) share the same P-image Í3.3.8.3).5 1 P-contexts were defined in (3.1.2.10). 2 Set K ?{w) is to be distinguished from KP(w), which is used to indicate the set of word form contexts which admit the paradigm of w (cf. definition (32.34.1)). 3 Definition (22.4.1). 4 Schwartz-Popa-Burcä 1971 {A}. 413. 5 P-image (3.3.8.3) corresponds also to context {võerá menjá videi xoróSij, X) (3.3.8.6) •yesterday saw me a good*</page><page sequence="566">544 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS Schwartz-Popa-Burca identifies case with the transitive closure of weak distribu- tional concordance, calling it distributional congruence.1 Thus, the C3-case C3(w) of word w is defined as follows. tfKw) = { vf | vf e W A V A (lui g C°(wi-i) Awi = wAwn = w')} (3.3.8.7) {w't...fwn) l&lt;iin It is hardly probable that C3 is a useful model for linguistic case1: most words will end up in the same weak distributional concordance class, if only because they are admitted by the empty P-context. Therefore, this model will not be discussed any fur- ther. In the next section, Schwartz-Popa-Burcä's model of complete case will be turned to. S 3.3.9 Schwartz-Popa-Burcä's model of 'complete case1 (C4) Schwartz-Popa-Burca's model of complete case1 is in fact the transitive closure of substitutability connectivity tolerance of words with respect to P-contexts.2 First, Schwartz-Popa-Burcã defines SC-tolerance of words with respect to P-con- texts under the label strong distributional concordance.3 The strong distributional concordance class Cco(iü) of a word w is defined as follows. Cc°(w) = {vf | K?(w) c K?(W) V mw) c K?(w)} (3.3.9.1) Thus, otéc ('father') and sád ('garden') are strongly distributionally concordant, be- cause all P-contexts which admit the nominative otéc also admit the nominative-accu- sative sád. Note that the converse does not hold: there are P-contexts, such as [PijálPigovorírtPiprdIPiborsój), X) (3.3.9.2) T 'speak' 'about' 'large' which admit sad, as an accusative, but do not admit otéc, which is exclusively nomina- tive. Similarly, otcá and sáda are strongly distributionally concordant because any P- context which admits the genitive sáda also admits the genitive-accusative otcá. Again, the converse is not true. The word forms otcá and sáda both belong to Ccoi¿enú' since both words can re- place the accusative zenú ('wife') in any P-context. The converse does not hold. Thus, strong distributional concordance is the tolerance relation resulting from ref lexivization of subsitutability dominance between word forms and P-contexts. Subsequently, Schwartz-Popa-Burcä defines the transitive closure of strong distri- butional concordance as complete distributional congruence and identifies it with complete case.4 The C^-case C4(iu) of a word w is defined as follows. which admits the masculine nominative. This shows the crudeness of P-images with respect to syntactic relations. This point will be returned to in Chapter 3.4. The present issue is not affected by this circum- stance: the example can be replaced by another context which exclusively admits accusatives. 1 Srhwartz-Pona-Bnrca 1971 (6): 417. (7): 418.

But their transitive closure provides undesirable connections after all: the above examples show that the chain otéc - sád - ¿end - otcá - sáda (3.3.9.4) is possible: otéc dominates sád; sád dominates ¿end; ¿end dominates otcá; otcá is dominated by sáda. All these words, which traditionally and intuitively belong to three different cases, end up in one C4-case. It is clear that the model does not provide for case syncretism. Schwartz-Popa- Burcä recognizes this1 but does not propose a solution, thus leaving the impression that linguistic relevance has been sacrificed to the desire to maintain the mathemati- cal esthetics of a partition: it is impossible to account for syncretism (which forces the investigator to assign two or more synthetic features to a word) by means of a parti- tion (by which each word is assigned to only one class). S 3.3.10 Trybulec's U-equivalence Technically, Schwartz-Popa-Burcä's case models are derivations of the more basic relation of U-equivalence, which was identified by Trybulec.2 U-equivalence is the simplest relation which can be derived from the feature system determined for W by the set of P^contexts: the admission of a word w by a P-context determines a feature of w. This implies that all set systems which were introduced in Chapter 22 for words in word-form contexts can also be defined for words in P-contexts. It then turns out that Schwartz-Popa-Burcä's case models correspond to marginal set systems, viz. the transitive closure of substitutability tolerance and the transitive closure of SOtoler- ance. The relation of U-equivalence is more basic: it determines a partition of W into sets containing words admitted by the same P-contexts. Popescu identifies these sets and examines their mathematical relationships with V.A. Uspenskij's U-types, labelling them generalized families (famille au sens généralisé);3 the present study employs the term U-family. The U-f amily Fu(u&gt;) of a word w is defined as follows. ?V(w) = {vf | vf g W A K?(w) = K?(w')} (3.3.10.1) U-families are illustrated in the next section. 1 Schwartz-Popa-Burcä 1971 (7&gt;. 419. 2 Trybulec 1967b (3&gt;. 42. 3 Popescu 1972 (2&gt;. 133-138.</page><page sequence="568">546 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS § 3.3.11 The U-families of the Russian nouns The material which was used to identify the Russian noun families1 can be employed for the identification of Russian U-families.

The forms of the 25 nouns presented in §2.2.9, which yielded 47 families, make up 20 U-families. It is mathematically evident that the U-family partition is broader than the family partition, so that two words which belong to the same family also belong to the same U-family.

A context like (já viïu krasotú v bol'Síx, ') (3.3. 11.11) 'I see beauty in large (plural)' must be added, which has the same P-image (3.3.11.8) as contexts (2.2.7.24) and (2.2.7.25). It is clear that U-equivalence effectively eliminates the problems of gender inter- ference as compared with ordinary substitutability equivalence. The problem of case syncretism is not solved: every instance produces a separate U-family. §3.3.12 Elementary and quasi-elementary U-categories (C5, C6) It is examined in this section to what extent case syncretism can be removed by the relation of substitutability dominance among U-families. For this purpose, the con- cepts of §2.2.16 and §2.2.17 must be redefined for U-families. Thus, set WUi of U-initial words is defined as follows.1 VfW={w'we WA A (K?(W) c K*(w) * K^W) = K?(w))} (3.3.12.1) w'e W A U-family containing a U-initial word is an initial U-family.

The position of the genitive II is as curious for U-families as it was for families. It contains words of the õáju type and all the instances of syncretism between genitive and dative, but fails to contain forms in which genitive I and genitive II are syn- cretized. Also, the position of the locative II is not very convincing, the locative I being a subset of the locative II. The graph also shows that Schwartz-Popa-Burcä's 'full case'1 is not adequate: all Russian cases will be accommodated into the same class of the transitive closure. Naturally, the model remains subject to the general objections to the concept of P- image and the 5^ base component, which will be discussed in Chapter 3.4. Neverthe- less it must be noted that, as in the case of Mayoh's B-structures, the results of rela- tively simple abstract structures which were developed quite early in set-theoretical modelling and to which no reality claims with respect to case were attributed fit this 1 Cf. §3.3.9.</page><page sequence="573">CHAPTER 3.3: TWIN STRING CASE MODELS 55 1 traditional concept better and in a less counterintuitive way than the more recent and more complex derivations specifically designed to model case1. §3.3.13 Amendments to Revzin's case model: adding 'paradigm* to the base component The preceding sections of Chapter 3.2 discussed case models that are originally de- rived from %¿. There is another line of research, in which the addition of paradigms to the base component is introduced in order to amend a case model which is basically derived from 9L'. In §2.3.7 it was shown that the fli case model developed by Revzin was unsuccessful, due to interference on the part of gender' and number1, which caused a host of insufficiently capacious contexts. This essential drawback of the model could not be removed within the framework of ?L'. Two proposals were made for elimininating insufficiently capacious contexts. The proposals involve an extension of the base component, with the set of paradigms or with the set of numbers. The first proposal turns the base component of the model into % which motivates its treatment in the present chapter. The second proposal implies an ad-hoc extension of the base component and will be discussed in the follow- ing section. Both proposals are integrated in one of Zaliznjak's case models, which will be treated subsequently. The first proposal, which was presented by Revzin,1 is simple. The base component is extended with the set of paradigms, and parts of speech are considered to have been derived.2 Then, contexts which do not admit at least one form from each paradigm of at least one part of speech are considered to have no case values: they are considered non-diagnostic3 for case1. In the example worked out in Fig. 2.3.7.1, Revzin's proposal excludes contexts (2.3.7.1), (2.3.7.2) and (2.3.7.3) from the set of relevant contexts, as they admit only a subset of the set of nouns. The set of contexts being thus limited, K2.3.5.1) regains its previous status of initial kappa family. According to Revzin, this is where the proce- dure stops: since (2.3.7.1) and (2.3.7.4) admit words from the same paradigm (singular and plural respectively), the set of contexts cannot be reduced any further and (2.3.7.5) cannot be considered an initial family. In fact, there is a possible treatment of number' which can be used to support Revzin's solution for getting rid of number interference. Russian possesses singularia tantum, such as kartófeV ('potatoe(s)'),4 and pluralia tantum, such as sani ('sledge(s)'). The inclusion of these words would have eliminated (2.3.5.1) and (2.3.5.4) from the set of contexts taken into consideration, as (2.3.5.1) does not admit forms of sani and (2.3.7.4) does not admit forms of kartófeV. This proposal is in line with Zaliznjak's treatment of pluralia tantum as a separate agreement class.5 1 Revzin 1965a; Revzin 1967b (6.40): 142. 2 The introduction of paradigms and the derivation of parts of speech were discussed in Chapter 3.0 and Chaoter 3.1. resDectivelv. 3 Diagnostic contexts: §2.0.8: §2.3.8ff. 4 Cf. 3.2.16. 5 Zaliznjak 1964 {5k 36. But Zaliznjak does not recognize singularia tantum for Russian. Cf. §3.2.26 and §3.2.27 for details on incomplete paradigms.</page><page sequence="574">552 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS The reason why Revzin did not consider this option is perhaps the incidental char- acter of these words. A consistent approach causes problems here with words that have accidental gaps in their paradigms, such as mglá ('haze'), which lacks a genitive plural.1 §3.3.14 Amendments to Revzin's case model: adding 'number* to the base component The second proposal comes from Zaliznjak. Like Revzin, he proposes to deny case relevance to contexts which are not sufficiently capacious: contexts which do not admit both singular and plural forms of words distinguishing number1 are excluded from the set of relevant contexts.2 Zaliznjak's proposal implies that the category of number is either included in the base component or derived. If number1 is included in the base component, then knowledge of paradigms is also required: one must know which word forms belong to the same lexeme in order to know which words distinguish number1. Knowledge of part of speech1 is also implied because number' does not occur in all parts of speech. So a base component which in- cludes number1 is an extension of %¿. If number1 is not included in the base component, it must be derived from R' or % Set-theoretical linguistics has paid little attention to this category. It was stated more than once that number' is not comparable to gender1 and case1, because it cannot be established on the basis of its "syntactic" properties, which means that it cannot be derived from ñ'. But Revzin points out that number1 cannot be established even if the paradigms are known as sets of words (i.e. on the basis of 5^): it is one thing to know that dómu Chouse, dative') and domám Chouses, dative') are in the same case and that dómom Chouse, instrumental') and domami Chouses, instrumental') are in the same case, but it is another thing to know whether dómu belongs together with domami or with dómom in the same number.3 Zaliznjak's Z-contexts at first sight seem to be a means establishing number'. Con- sider: (Kkotórye idút) (3.3.14.1) 'which go* (X, kotóryj idët) (3.3.14.2) 'which goes' Context (3.3.14.1) admits only plural nouns, while (3.3.14.2) admits only singular nouns. But here Revzin rejects these contexts as a post hoc device. He writes: fThis is a characteristic example of a distributional peculiarity which comes to light only when the partition into number classes is already known. It is clear that it is impossible to select this partition [i.e. the partition of W yielded by these contexts] out of a series of other partitions which are determined by other contexts if we do not know which partition we are looking for.4 1 Cf. §3.2.23 and §3.2.26. 2 Zaliznjak's proposal is known from Revzin's reports: cf. Revzin 1969b: 69 and 1977 (4.2.2): 143. 0 Revzin 1969b: 71; Revzin 1970: 231. 4 Revzin 1977 (4.4.1): 152. For Zaliznjak's Z-contexts, cf. also §2.0.8, §2.2.6, §2.2.12, §2.2.13, §3.2.3, and §3.2.29.</page><page sequence="575">CHAPTER 3.3: TWIN STRING CASE MODELS 553 In other words: if number is to be an intensional label, then the base component must provide a procedure which is not language-specific and is geared at finding contexts which are indicative for number' in each language. Contexts (3.3.14.1) and (3.3.14.2) are language-specific in their identification of number', and no criterion is provided which distinguishes them from other contexts such as (K kotóryj Set) (3.3.14.3) 'which went (masculine singular)' ('ykotóraja SIA (3.3.14.4) 'which went (feminine singular)' (Kkotóroe ãló) (3.3.14.5) 'which went (neuter singular)1 which distinguish between the genders. As a result, no distinction between 'number' and "gender can be made, except if it is assumed that (3.3.14.1) and (3.3.14.2) admit dif- ferent forms of the same paradigms whereas (3.3.14.3), (3.3.14.4) and (3.3.14.5) do not. But the same difference is proposed by Revzin for use in the present model in order to distinguish between different cases: this implies that the model would treat number' as an instance of case1, which is exactly what the introduction of number" as a provisonal part of the base component purported to avoid. Thus, no satisfactory definition of number' can be derived from the present base component. Revzin works out a defition of number' which involves extension of the base component with semantic entités.1 There is no objection to this, but in the actual definitions a specific semantic item CMULT&gt; is used, which may raise objections similar to the ones quoted above: one can only select CMULT&gt; from a series of semantic items if we know what category we are looking for. Although no explicit connection with the present problem is indicated, Zaliznjak's full model offers a solution to the problem: using semantic criteria, Zaliznjak intro- duces two dichotomies of categories, one of whose intersections happens to contain 'number' as its only element in Russian.2 Thus, number does not stand for 'number' but for any category with certain properties. Zaliznjak's conception involves an extension of the base component and is outside the scope of this chapter.3 In Zaliznjak's 1967a model, which is treated in the next section, 'number' is added to the base component as an independently given entity.4 1 Revzin 1969b: 72-73. 2 Zaliznjak 1969 (4-6): 46-50, 1967b (1.4-1.6): 23-27. 3 Details will be provided in §4.6.42. 4 It will be clear, however, that the impossibility of deriving number' from fl2 and giving it in a base component is a time bomb in H2 case modelling: since it is quite improbable that a feasible theory will postulate the grammatical category of number as a defining property of language (there are languages which do without number* as a category), number' is not likely to feature in the base component of a full model {full model: cf. § 1.0.6 and Chapter 1.5). If, however, new sets of primitives are essential to the definition of number', they may very well serve as feasible alternatives for the present models of 'gender' and case. This point will be returned to in Chapter 4.6, when Gladkifs "internal" and "external" categories will be discussed.</page><page sequence="576">554 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS §3.3.15 Zaliznjak's paradigmatic case model (C7) One of Zaliznjak's case models1 is basically derived from %¿, and integrates the amendments to Revzin's fli model which were discussed in the preceding sections. This implies that Zaliznjak allots the following concepts to the base component of his (partial or substitutional) model besides the basic entities of %2 1 The parts of speech of a language. It was shown in §3.1.2 and §3.1.3 how U-types provide an approximation of parts of speech. If this approximation is considered acceptable, or if it is assumed that an acceptable approximation of parts of speech can be derived from %% then parts of speech entail no extension of the base com- ponent. 2 The nouns of a language. The knowledge of which part of speech contains the nouns of a language cannot be derived from % The problem of given nouns has certain mathematical aspects which were touched upon in §2.2.8: the application of a model to a subset of words or contexts instead of the complete set does not have to be accounted for if a possible addition of material to the set results in an expan- sion of the defined sets. But if the addition of new material can unite and split es- tablished sets (i.e. annihilates the original results), the matter is more serious. The latter situation occurs in Zaliznjak's present model (which defines a set of sets without special properties): the inclusion, into the set of nouns, of one or two unin- tended words can influence the results of the model for other words. For this rea- son, the set of nouns must be explicitly added to the base component. 3 The number of a given noun. As Revzin was quoted as stating in the preceding sec- tion, no model of number1 can be based on %¿. Consequently, the base component must be extended with this concept. So Zaliznjak's base component in fact looks as follows. Jfec-(W,tf P,S,N) (3.3.15.1) Here S is the subset of W which contains the nouns in W, and N is a system of sets over S, each set N in N representing a number of the grammatical category of number. Unlike the models discussed so far, Zaliznjak's model refrains from defining case1 as a strong or weak category: it defines a set of sets of nouns without any special prop- erties. This is a logical step, as the application of the proposals of §3.3.13 and §3.3.14 results in the removal of contexts from the set taken into account. In his formulation of the model, Zaliznjak even avoids the concept of diagnostic context:3 all definitions are immediately stated in terms of sets of words. Zaliznjak first of all derives the set K's of feature classes for the set of contexts for nouns: the subset of the set of feature classes which contains sets each containing nouns that are admitted by the same contexts.4 K'S = { w¿ | Wi c w A V Wt = w; n S } (3.3. 15.2) w;gK' 1 Zaliznjak 1967a. 2Zalizniak 1967a: 1. 3 Cf. §2.3.8. 4 Set K' of feature classes is defined in (2.2.3.3). A general definition of feature classes is given in § 1.124.</page><page sequence="577">CHAPTER 3.3: TWIN STRING CASE MODELS 555 The introduction of K's enables the explicit exclusion of all non-nominals from the set of words being taken into consideration. Zaliznjak's model exclusively deals with the distribution of nominais. This is important, as non-nominals, such as adverbs, may in- terfere with the results of the model. Consider, as an example, the contexts (jáuví¿u,') (3.3.15.3) 'I shall see' (jáuvídel,') (3.3.15.4) 'I saw* Assume that (3.3.15.3) does not admit the adverb võerá ('yesterday') and (3.3.15.4) does not admit závtra ('tomorrow'). Then if these adverbs are included in the set of words on which case is defined, (3.3.15.3) and (3.3.15.4) cannot be associated with the same case. Set K/S is a set of sets without special properties. But, as pointed out in §2.3.8, sets of feature classes reflect special properties of the features which characterize the objects in the sets: for each set in K/S, there is a kappa family of contexts (which admit the same set of nouns). These contexts make up a partition of the set K of con- texts. Zaliznjak calls a set in K' a column {colonne), and a set in K's a noun column (co- lonne substantívale), although unlike what the term seems to suggest, the sets are not ordered. A complete noun column contains at least one form of each number from each paradigm.1 Set K'c containing the complete noun columns is defined as follows. K'C = {Wi | Wi c w A Wi g K'S a A A (P(s) n N n Wi = 0 ^ P(s) n N = 0)} (3.3.15.5) seS NgN Thus, noun columns which are yielded by, say, context (2.3.7.2) (which admits feminine singular nominatives) are not complete, because they lack forms from certain paradigms (e.g. from the masculine noun otéc) and numbers (e.g. from the plural ¿ënyo. But the noun column yielded by (2.3.7.5) (which admits any nominative) is complete, since it admits forms of each number of each paradigm. Zaliznjak in this manner elimi- nates the effects of gender interference by removing the noun columns corresponding to contexts which are insufficiently capacious.2 The set of complete noun columns is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of diagnostic contexts.3 Subsequently, Zaliznjak identifies and removes the noun columns which correspond to contexts which are too capacious. His C7-case (série casuelle) is defined as a com- plete noun column which does not contain another noun column:4 C7 = { Wt I Wt c W A Wi g K'C a A (W7- c Wt =» Wf = Wt) } (3.3. 15.6) W^eK'C The C7-cases are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of elementary contex- tual categories5 for a set of diagnostic contexts which admit forms of each number of 1 Zaliznjak 1967a: 1. 2 E.g. contexts (2.3.5.1), (2.3.7.1), (2.3.7.2), (2.3.7.3) and (2.3.7.4) in Fig. 2.3.7.1. 3 For the term diagnostic context, cf. §2.3.8. 4 Zaliznjak 1967a: 2. 5 §2.3.5.</page><page sequence="578">556 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS each paradigm. So in this respect Zaliznjak's model is a notational variant of the case model discussed in §2.3.5. The definition of C7 excludes, for instance, the noun column which is yielded by context (2.3.5.13) (which admits nominative, genitive, dative and accusative), because it contains the noun columns which are yielded by (2.3.5.14) (which admits nominative and genitive), (2.3.5.15) (which admits nominative and dative) and (2.3.5.16) (which ad- mits genitive, dative and accusative).1 The results of Zaliznjak's model can be illustrated with the material shown in Fig. 2.3.5.1, where the non-diagnostic contexts were already left out of consideration. Contexts (2.3.5.1), (2.3.5.2), (2.3.5.4), (2.3.5.5), (2.3.5.6) and (2.3.5.8) correspond to com- plete noun columns which contain no other complete noun columns and represent the six traditional cases listed in (2.3.5.17). Context (2.3.5.3) (the genitive II) admits all nouns admitted by (2.3.5.2) (the genitive I) besides the genitive II forms. So the model does not yield a special second genitive case. Assuming that all contexts which admit locative 1 1 forms also admit locative I forms,2 a similar relationship is established for contexts (2.3.5.8) and (2.3.5.7), respectively. The inconvenience of the lack of any status for the genitive II, and possibly for the locative II, can be eliminated. Zaliznjak does so in another model by replacing the condition that cases not contain other complete noun columns by the condition that cases not be the union of other complete noun columns.3 Under that condition, cases are in a one-to-one correspondence to quasi-elementary contextual categories, which were discussed in §2.3.6.4 Note that, in that case, the genitive II contains all genitive I forms besides the typical genitive II forms, and the locative II contains all locative I forms besides the typical locative 1 1 forms. Another inconvenience of the model is its sensitivity to defective paradigms: the definition of K'c excludes not only noun columns which are generated by contexts containing adjectivais or verb preterites with gender endings, but also noun columns corresponding to cases for which at least one noun paradigm is defective. Consider the noun mglá ('fog'): the fact that it lacks a genitive plural implies that no context which admits exclusively genitive forms can produce a complete noun column, as a re- sult of which the noun column which contains the genitive disappears from the inven- tory of Russian cases. On the other hand, there is the noun drovéc ('firewood'), which only possesses a genitive plural: this removes all other cases. The present writer is not aware of a solution to this problem within the definition of language operated with. Finally, the domain of the model is a point of interest. The model can tell us to which cases a type word (i.e. a word4) can belong and what form a word takes in a particular case. It also provides us with the (or a) number of Russian cases, which an- swers Kolmogorov's second K-question (1/0/1/2). But, like Revzin's models and its re- visions which were discussed in Chapter 2.3, it cannot always tell us to which case a token word (i.e. a words) or a context, or a compatible pair, belongs: it does not really answer the relevant K-question. * The fact that all these contexts admit accusatives expressing duration is abstracted from in Part 3. 2 Cf. the discussion on examples (2/2/7/1) and (2/2/7/2). 3 Zaliznjak 1967b (2.4): 40; see §5.13. 4 See also §2.3.9.</page><page sequence="579">CHAPTER 3.3: TWIN STRING CASE MODELS 557 There is no need to pay more attention to the model here, because the comments on Revzin's model given in §2.3.8 apply here as well. Except for the defective paradigm problem, the model can be amended in the same manner as described for Revzin's model in §2.3.9 to §2.3.11. An improved version of Zaliznjak's model with a different base component will be discussed in Part 5.1 §3.3.16 Further options for deriving 'case' from the twin string base component In §3.0.16, a survey was provided of the basic feature systems which can be derived from % Most of these systems, and the basic relations which can be derived from them, have been discussed by now: the Set -theoretical School studied their mathemat- ical properties and explored their linguistic relevance, or restricted itself to their mathematical properties, as in the case of Mayoh's B-types.2 Only feature systems 4g and 4 h have been left out of consideration so far, both by mathematicians and lin- guists; this seems justified for 4h, which obscures any morphological differences which might characterize a pair of words. But in a complete survey of the possibilities of deriving case from % feature system 4g, in which P-contexts are treated as fea- tures of word forms, cannot be left unexplored. Consider again the basic idea on which %¿ case modelling is based. Recall that fy gender modelling deals with the classification of lexical meanings (lexemes) on the basis of the influence which they exercise on the choice of the forms of their contexts. This is reflected most immediately in feature system 4c. fl2 case modelling, on the other hand, deals with the manner in which lexical meanings (lexemes) in the contexts influence the choice of the forms of the words which they admit. This approach to 'case was never made clearly explicit. It comes to light most ob- viously when the discussion touches upon instances where the choice of case forms is not, and cannot be, prompted by any lexical items in the contexts. This situation is ap- proximated in Estonian3 and in Kiefer's Hungarian. In Hungarian the inessive case, which denotes location inside an object, and the superessive case, which denotes lo- cation on top of an object, must occur in just about the same contexts. From a gram- matical viewpoint (i.e. ignoring pragmatic considerations) it is possible to interchange hajóban ('in a ship') and hajón fon a ship') in all contexts. Zaliznjak makes the following remark on this phenomenon. Hiie described model [Zaliznjak's case model as presented in §3.3.15] might meet with certain difficul- ties in languages with several locative cases (e.g. in the Finno-Ugric languages). Still, the secondary uses of these locative cases (e.g. as complements of certain verbs), which nearly always exist, must en- able us to distinguish these cases within the framework of the model.4 And, as it seems, certain Hungarian verbs, such as részesül Oto be honoured with, to receive'), and adjectives, such as búnõs ('guilty'), require a complement in the inessive 1See§5.10ff. 2 Cf. 3.234. 3 Examples are given in §2.2.15 and §3.0.9; for an exception cf. (2/2/15/3). 4 Zaliznjak 1967a: 2.</page><page sequence="580">558 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS case, as a result of which the distributions of the inessive and superessive forms di- verge. Zaliznjak's remark clearly suggests that case1 is conceived of in terms of contexts: the lexical items in the contexts are considered to determine the case of a word. Note that we are not dealing here with the question of whether this view is correct, but are only observing that it is operated with by exponents of the Set-theoretical School when they derive case1 from fl2. This observation explains, for example, why the geni- tive II is not yielded as a full-fledged case in Zaliznjak's model: since it can always be replaced by the genitive I, contexts cannot fully determine its use; they can only de- termine limitations on its use. Since, at least in this %¿ conception, it is the identity of the lexical items in contexts that determine case' and not the forms of the lexical items, and since the forms of certain lexical items in the contexts must even be explicitly disregarded in order to avoid gender interference, it seems natural to regard P-images of contexts as the do- main of case. Since, on the other hand, case is manifest in the forms of individual words, it is logical to regard word forms, not lexical meanings, as carrying the fea- tures which are indicative for case1. In this 4 g approach, Trybulec's P-con texts are combined with Revzin's and Zaliznjak's context-oriented approach. It provides a mir- ror to Mayoh's 4c approach which resulted in B-types. S 3.3.17 Kappa P-families In approach 4g of §3.0.16, word forms are treated as a feature system for the set of P-contexts on account of their distribution. For each P-context k?, we can define set W(fcp), containing words w such that there is a context k which possesses image fcp and admits wl W(fcp) = {w | w e W A V (k? = k?(k) Awe W(fc))} (3.3.17.1) keK The kappa P-family FK?(k?) of a P-context k? contains the P-contexts corresponding to contexts which admit the same words: F*p(fcp) = { fcp' | fcp' g tfp A W(fcp') = W(fcp) } (3.3. 17.2) Kappa P-families are the contextual counterpart of the P-families of Trybulec's U- equivalence. Kappa P-families are illustrated in the next section. S 3.3.18 The kappa P-famllies of the Russian nouns The material used to identify Russian contextual families2 can be used for identifying the Russian kappa P-families.

P-contexts (3.3.18.1) and (3.3.18.13) to (3.3.18.17) belong to the same kappa P-family. The set of words which they admit is the union of the set of words admitted by P- contexts (3.3.18.2) to (3.3.18.6) and (3.3.18.18). P-context (3.3.18.19) makes up a separate kappa P-family as it P-admits any noun form except the locative. S 3.3.19 Kappa P-dominance (C8, C») Relation DK? of kappa P-dominance among kappa P-f amilies is established as follows. D*p = {(fc~, *~) | fc~ g K? A k' e K? A WftÇ) c W(fc~)} (3.3.19.1) There is no need to spell out the formal definition of the progressive kappa P-product of a P-context fcp, nor the definitions of initial kappa P-contexts and initial kappa P- f amilies. It suffices to substitute fcp for k and K? for K in formulas (2.3.4.5), (2.3.4.7) and (2.3.4.8). The same applies to quasi-initial kappa P-contexts, which can be obtained by making these substitutions in formula (2.3.6.1). Now the progressive products of initial contexts are defined as P-contextual categories, or C8-casest and the progressive products of quasi-initial contexts as quasi-P-contextual categories or Cß-cases. Kappa P-dominance for the Russian noun material introduced above looks as shown in Fig. 3.3.19.1, where the figures refer to the kappa P-f amilies of the corresponding P-contexts, and arrows indicate kappa P-dominance.

But there are important differences. Unlike Revzin's model, the present model is not sensitive to interference on the part of gender1 and number'. This means that the identification of diagnostic phrases is not necessary and the base component does not have to be expanded with undefined auxiliary concepts. The re- sults which Zaliznjak has attained by adding number1 to the fy base component (to obtain ^2C), have been derived directly from ñ2 here. It is the present writer's impression that this is the most adequate model that can be expected to be derivable from % S 3.3.20 Disadvantages of case models based on kappa P-dominance Although a case model based on kappa P-dominance solves some of the problems that are encountered in Revzin's and Zaliznjak's models, it offers fewer prospects in other respects. The possibility exists that the model cannot distinguish cases which occur in exactly the same contexts. As discussed in §3.3.16, this will not easily occur even in Estonian and Hungarian. But the chance that it will occur increases when P-contexts are considered instead of formal contexts. Comparison of Fig. 2.3.5.1 and Fig. 3.3.19.1 shows that the blurring of morphosyntactic information which occurs as a result of the substitution of P-contexts for formal contexts has greatly increased the overlap among the sets of words which are admitted by the respective contexts. What is more important, the domains for which the model defines case consist of types: case' is expressed either as a system of tolerance classes covering the set of P- contexts, or as the corresponding set of sets covering the set of words, as in Zaliz- njak's model. As discussed in §2.3.8, such models do not yet answer the classic K- question: the case of a given word token is not yet determined. Revzin's model of 'to- ken case, which was introduced in §2.3.9, can of course be transferred to the present model of 'type case'. But the disadvantages were sketched in §2.3.10: it was pointed out that the model allows for certain varieties of homonymy, (morphological and context syncretism, and combinations thereof), which in some instances may produce counter- intuitive results (as it did for compatible pair (2/3/10/3)). The number of such instances increases when P-contexts are used in compatible pairs instead of formal contexts. If contexts in compatible pairs are replaced by P-contexts, a P-compatible pair1 such as (3/3/20/1) P(otéc) nvidert dó£ is ambiguous for nominative and accusative, whereas each of its corresponding com- patible pairs is not: (3/3/20/2) Otéc vf dit dóõ' 'father (nominative) sees daughter (nominative or accusative)' (3/3/20/3) Otcv vídiat dóõ' 'fathers (nominative) see daughter (nominative or accusative)' 1 An ad hoc term, which is not formally defined, as it is only used here. The analogy with ordinary com- patible pairs will be clear. In example (3/3/20/1) a provisional representation is used, the interpretation of which is easily deduced by analogy.</page><page sequence="584">562 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS (3/3/20/4) Otcá vídit dóe1 'father (accusative) sees daughter (nominative or accusative)' This reduces the empirical interest of C8 and C9: their use in the definition of 'token case1 entails loss of intuitively relevant information. §3.3.21 Conclusion on twin string case models Whereas it was considered obvious that the domain of gender1 is the set of words (though it is pointed out in this study that the set of lexical meanings offers more prospects), the domain of case remains a problem in J^ case modelling. Some (e.g. Schwartz-Popa-Burca) consider the domain of case1 to coincide with the set of words, whereas others (e.g. Marcus, Revzin) consider it to coincide with the set of contexts. Zaliznjak defines case1 as a set of sets of words, but his model actually employs the set of contexts as its domain, since the former set does not possess any special properties and its elements are in one-to-one correspondence with those of a system of toler- ance classes (derived from a dominance relation) in the set of contexts. The present writer has shown that Zaliznjak's results can be achieved without the introduction of auxiliary primitive concepts if the set of P-contexts is considered the domain of case1; the derivation of case" as a set of sets of words without any special properties is triv- ial here. The only domain that offers the prospect of providing meaningful answers to K- questions is, however, a set of compatible pairs of words of some kind and contexts of some kind. In this domaia no progress is made as compared with Revzin's token case model and its modifications discussed in §2.3.11. On the contrary, the instances of doubtful homonymy, exemplified by compatible pair (2/3/10/3), increase if P-contexts are substituted for formal contexts: as was shown with P-compatible pair (3/3/20/1), P- contexts may eliminate morphosyntactically relevant information. The cause of this drawback is easily pinpointed. Contexts suffer from an inherent lack of precision. Of the words that make up a context, only one or two usually affect the case form of the admitted word: the other words just clutter the picture. This as- pect will be discussed in the next chapter.</page><page sequence="585">CHAPTER 3.4: CONCLUSIONS ON TWIN STRING MODELS The models which were presented in Part 3 illustrate the phenomenon which made the first automobiles look like coaches and the first transistors like lamps. When a new option is introduced it is only availed of as a prosthesis: it is used for local amend- ments to identified shortcomings of the existing options. It takes relative outsiders, who are not biased by the old preoccupations, to survey the total range of available options and integrate them. Thus, most case and gender models which are based on %¿ are essentially fli mod- els. They employ flpbased definitions of the concepts of family and contextual family, and only then apply the partition into paradigms as added to fy. In several models, in- adequate results are subsequently amended through the ad hoc introduction of addi- tional undefined concepts. Only in the second stage, are the options offered by the addition of paradigms (i.e. lexical meanings) explored more thoroughly and systematically. The simpler option of the immediate involvement of paradigms in the derivation of families and their domain, instead of using them post hoc as a means to connect and split original flj families, was explored by outsiders such as May oh1 and Trybulec,2 who, as pure mathemati- cians, were only interested in examining the derivations which were determined by ^¿ as a mathematical object, and were not bothered by linguistic preoccupations. They developed the simplest models with the most useful derivations of H2, but did not, or did not fully, explore the possibility of relating these derivations to traditional gram- matical concepts. This was done in the preceding chapters of Part 3. The above does not mean that the derivations obtained are the last word on case' and 'gender1; it only suggests that they provided optimal results given the conception of language operated with. At this point, it may be useful to consider some of the dis- advantages which result from the present approach to feature systems between words and contexts in general, rather than from their particular derivations. The fol- lowing discussion does not concern the relevance of the distributional approach itself, but only the choice of the feature systems and the related constraints which are in- herent in base component % At the end of Chapter 3.2, it was shown how various models of 'gender' were unsat- isfactory due to their inability to distinguish between different kinds of agreement. Intuitively, animacy and 'gender1 influence contexts in different ways: to be precise, they affect different parts of contexts. At the end of Chapter 3.3, it was contended that adopting complete linear contexts as the domain of case1 is counterintuitive be- cause, intuitively, it is only certain words in the contexts which determine the case of an admitted word, and not contexts as such (at least if the distributional approach to case1 is accepted at all). In fact the word-context scheme as a whole, even after the introduction of lexical meanings, is too crude to provide the domain for intuitively satisfactory definitions. In 1 §3.2.34. 2 §3.3.10. 563</page><page sequence="586">564 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS certain cases, it is even bound to provide counterintuitive solutions, as in Zaliznjak's example:1 {ón ob"javíl éto reSénie, X) (3.4.1) 'he announced this decision1 Intuitively, this context admits not one single set of words but two: a set of words which indicate to whom the decision was announced, and a set of words which indi- cate whose decision was announced. The first set contains the words which can de- pend on ob"javil ('announced'); the second set contains the words which depend on reëénie ('decision'). The sets intersect: the intersection contains the word kollégii ('committee'), which syncretizes the endings which are used to indicate the two func- tions. Thus, if case and agreement class phenomena must at all be accounted for in terms of distribution, it seems intuitively preferable to describe them in terms of relations between token words, not between words and contexts. This is illustrated by linguistic statements such as: (3/4/ 1 ) Vladéf governs the instrumental. (3/4/2) Adjectives agree in gender with nouns. The relations between token word as determined by base component %¿ are rather straightforward. As shown in Fig. 3.0.14.1, base component 5^ provides phrases as se- quences of pairs of lexical meanings (words6&gt; and word forms (words i). This provides structures of the following kind. Fig. 3.4.1 Pi P2 Pa P4 Thus, the distributional relations of a token word form (i.e. word3 which consist of a pairs of a wordo and a wordj) are linear: words are in a direct relation to the preced- ing and the following words. These relations are not really relevant to case and gender1: a word w which pre- cedes a noun s can be an adjective, which agrees with s, but can also be a verb, which governs s. Or w can have no determination relation with s, even when w is an adjec- tive or a verb. A chance that linear arrangement reflects the relations which are re- quired for the definition of case and 'gender1 exists only for languages with an im- plausibly strict word order.2 Relations among token words which are more complex than linear order can be derived from linear order by comparing distributions of parts of the phrases and paradigms defined by base component % Kulagina, Revzin and Gladkij in fact worked out such proposals, deriving configurations from the set of phrases. As will be shown 1 Context (3.4.1) is identical to (2.3.10.1). ¿ Trybulec and Revzin explored some options offered by linear order in their model of syntactic cognate- ness, which approximates 'part of speech1 and was discussed in §2.2.27 and §2.2.28.</page><page sequence="587">CHAPTER 3.3: CONCLUSIONS ON TWIN STRING MODELS 565 in §4.1.1 to §4.1.21, the relations thus derived do not immediately yield new options for the derivation of case1 and gender". Attempts to derive non-linear relations (or relations which are not exclusively lin- ear) via parts of speech have also failed: it was shown in Chapter 3.1 that it is not possible to derive meaningful parts of speech from P-images, which are linear rela- tions among token lexical meanings. On the contrary, P-images tend to obscure rela- tions rather than clarify them. Consider Revzin's example of the P-phrases1 &lt;pólnyj&gt; &lt;zízn'&gt; 'student' (3.4.2) 'full' 'life' 'student' &lt;bol'§ój&gt; &lt;2ízn'&gt; &lt;studént&gt; (3.4.3) 'big' 'life' 'student' These P-phrases correspond to the phrases2 (3/4/3) pólnyj zízni student 'a student full of life* (3/4/4) bol'Sája zízn1 studénta 'the big life of the student' In (3.4.2) and (3.4.3), identical parts of speech are represented in the same linear or- der, but the relations which are relevant for agreement and government are entirely different for (3/4/3) and (3/4/4). It may be added that a single P-image can cover en- tirely different structures: P-phrase (3.4.2) can also represent the phrase (3/4/5) pólnaja zízn' studénta 'the full life of the student* This unsatisfactory situation is the consequence of certain constraints which are implicit in base component fl2. Kulagina's constraint, which stipulates that no word can have more than one lexical meaning, has already been discussed, as a result of which fl2 has implicitly been replaced with fl2b.3 But both fl2 and fl2&amp; harbour additional im- plicit constraints on the structure of language. Here are a few of them. 1 The word tokens (i.e. concrete segments, words i in the classification of §3.0.14) occur only in a linear arrangement. It seems in fact quite natural that the elements of formal expression of a language show linear order, because the physical ex- pression of language proceeds along the time axis. The question of whether this is still true when more abstract formal elements are introduced will not be discussed here, but it is clear that linear order will not do when stress and intonation are in- volved. 2 There is a one-to-one correspondence between token lexical meanings (wordsô) and token words as concrete segments (words j). This constraint implies that the only meanings of a language are lexical meanings. It was pointed out in §3.1.8 that certain problems can only be avoided if the constraint is abandoned. Since the Set- theoretical School persists in defining case1 and gender1 on entire words,4 it seems 1 Revzin 1977 (4.1.3): 130. P-image (3.4.3) is identical to (3.1.5.11). 2 Phrase (3/4/3) is identical to (3/1/5/34); phrase (3/4/4) is Identical to (3/1/5/36). 3 Cf. §3.0.12, §3.0.13 and §3.0.15. 4 I.e. practises the word-and-paradigm approach: cf. §3.0.3.</page><page sequence="588">566 PART 3: TWIN STRING MODELS convenient to adhere to the one-to-one correspondence constraint for the time being, and specify deviations individually. 3 The token lexical meanings (wordsç) occur only in a linear arrangement. This con- straint received attention in the Set-theoretical School. There seems to be no rea- son why the token elements of meaning in a language should be subject to linear arrangement. As far as elements of meaning can be said to reflect physical entities, these entities are certainly not arranged in linear order. Part 4 and Part 5 in fact discuss base components in which this constraint is no longer assumed. After the decision to drop the assumption on linear order between token elements of meaning, investigators face two options. 1 The linearity constraint on the relation among token elements of meaning can be replaced by another constraint, which is part of, or can be derived from, a differ- ent theory on the structure of language. 2 Models of case1 and 'gender1 can be made to adopt a base component which does not specify the structure of the relations among token meaningful elements of a language. This approach begs the question of whether: a a theory of language must in fact allow any relations among token elements of meaning, or: b models of case' and gender* can be constructed as modules which function inde- pendently of the constraints which any specific theory imposes on the relations among token elements of meaning. The models which are discussed in Part 4 (except Chapter 4.1) work out the first op- tion. Linear order is replaced by another constraint: dependency structure. The sec- ond option will be discussed in Part 5.</page></plain_text>
