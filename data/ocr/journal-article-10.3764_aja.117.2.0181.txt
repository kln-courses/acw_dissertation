In the following page, three more tombs are listed.  Since they follow the same numbering and no head- ing precedes them, it is possible that they might also  be associated with “Kornovigli (Dokathismata).” Düm- mler refers to these tombs by Arabic numerals in his  Skizzenbuch and by letters in the 1886 article (the for- mer are given in parentheses): A (1), E (3), F (4),  and no letter (5).22  Of these four tombs, only Tomb A (1) is provided  with a plan and a somewhat more detailed descrip- tion in Dümmler’s Skizzenbuch (fig. 2).23 As this was the  only known Early Cycladic tomb on Amorgos prior to  Tsountas’ excavations, the archaeology of which can  now be partially reconstructed, it deserves special men- tion. To avoid confusion with the different numbering  systems employed by Dümmler, I give his final number- ing of the objects in parentheses throughout.24  Tomb A (1) was a trapezoidal cist consisting of six  slabs: four standing side slabs, a floor slab, and a cover  slab.25 The maximum depth of the tomb was 50 cm  below the modern surface. Slab CD (see fig. 2), de- scribed as the “vorderen Vertikalplatte,” was 5 cm taller  than the other side slabs and was found 30 cm below  the modern surface.26 At point G, Dümmler found a  skull fragment at a depth of 42 cm. More bones, in- cluding what appears to be a 13 cm long bone, were  found at a depth of 43 cm near corner A.27 Bones were  also observed between points A and B. The concentra- tion of objects along the CB axis and the presence of  bones along the AB axis suggested to Dümmler that Fig. 2.

At point F, not far from point H, Dümmler  discovered a slashed handle (A2; ht. 3.5 cm), perhaps  from a collared jar (stamnos), at a depth of 35 cm from  the modern surface.29 At the same depth at point E,  he found a broken marble-footed goblet (A1; ht. 6  cm; diam. 10 cm). The cavity of the goblet, as well as  the earth found inside, bore clear traces of blue pig- ment. The most remarkable discovery, however, was  the “Gefäß aus grünlichem Marmor mit Deckel und  sehr gut gearbeitet” noted in the Skizzenbuch30—a stone  hut-lidded pyxis with carved spiraliform decoration  (A4; ht. 9.4 cm; diam. 11.3 cm); it was acquired by the  Antiquarium (now the Antikensammlung) in Berlin  in 1889 directly from Dümmler.31 The findspot is not  shown in the Skizzenbuch plan, although the object is  briefly mentioned and sketched.

Tomb D was reportedly  found at “ςτον κάπρον” (Ston Kapron), and Tomb G  at ancient Arkesine. Although drawings of the entire  group of objects associated with Tomb G are included  in his Skizzenbuch, from Tomb D only two objects are  illustrated: a cylinder seal and a silver vessel, now both  at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.39 Without going into any great detail, as the contents  of these two graves have been published and discussed  fully elsewhere,40 it is worth mentioning that the as- semblage of Tomb D, as presented in the 1886 report  (itself based on an unnamed “authentischer Ang- abe”), consisted of the following objects: three silver  and four green stone beads and a few drop-shaped  stone pendants reconstructed as a necklace (D1);  two stone handles, the best preserved of which (D2) Fig. 4.

Another of Wolters’ illustrated figurines ended up in  the Staatliche Antikensammlungen.47 All the other ob- jects are now at the Ashmolean Museum, having been  purchased in Athens in 1893 by Arthur Evans from the  same dealer who used to trade with Chester.48 Most  of the finds from Tomb D, as illustrated in 1886 and  1891,49 appear to date to EC I–II, with the exception  of the bone object (D4; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum,  inv. no. AE 165), which could be post–Bronze Age.  One should be very cautious in using the objects  from Tomb D to reconstruct the chronology of the  early Cyclades.50 For example, the Ashmolean’s Kapros  Tomb D assemblage now contains four figurines (fig.  6). Yet only two of these can be identified with those il- lustrated by Wolters.51 Since no drawings of the Kapros  figurines were included in Dümmler’s 1886 article, it  is impossible to tell whether the four pieces shown in  Wolters’ article are the same as those seen by Düm- mler.52 What is certain is that at least one of the four  figurines illustrated in Wolters’ article had already  been sold prior to Evans’ purchase of the Kapros Tomb  D material for the Ashmolean Museum in 1893. It is  possible that the Munich figurine was also sold before  that date. This would explain the addition of two more  figurines to the “original group” by the art dealer who  Fig. 5.

It should be mentioned that a  number of those involved in the early antiquities traffi cking as private archaeologists and “earth contractors” developed real inter- ests in the advancement of knowledge. A good example is the Cypriot Grigoris Antoniou, who worked in numerous excavations  in the eastern Mediterranean and was Evans’ foreman at Knossos. Born in Larnaca, he “had learned in a jeunesse orageuse spent in  tomb-robbing in Cyprus how to remove the most fragile objects without breaking them” (Evans 1943, 340). Arthur Evans remarked  that Antoniou’s “life-long application to his congenial pursuit on early Cypriote sites made him probably the most expert tomb- hunter of the Levant” and described him as “a superman among foremen” (quoted in Evans 1943, 340). Antoniou exemplifi es how  a tomb hunter could potentially turn, with the development of archaeology, into one of the fi rst skilled archaeological workers who,  with their expertise, have since contributed immensely to the discovery of the past. </page> <page sequence="23"> 2013] RESEARCH ON AMORGOS AND CYCLADIC ARCHAEOLOGY 203 tion.” In The Cycladic Spirit: Masterpieces from the Nicholas P.
