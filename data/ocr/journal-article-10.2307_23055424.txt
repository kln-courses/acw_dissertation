<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paolozzi in America by JOHN-PAUL STONARD the image of america radiates in the early collages of Eduardo Paolozzi, illuminating works such as those in the famous Bunk series with a 'kind of dynamism that the English could never capture', as Paolozzi later put it — implicitly invoking his own exotic origins as an Italian immigrant brought up in Edinburgh.1 Paolozzi's engagement with an imaginary world of American culture, and his status as the prophet of Pop art, is well known. Less appreciated is his actual encounter with America at the end of the 1950s, and his success, primarily on the East Coast, as an exponent ofBrutalist sculpture, European-style. His work figured in a number of important American museum exhibitions and entered their collections, laying the ground for what might have been a highly successful transatlantic career. Yet, in contrast to Henry Moore, who was receiving his first large North American commissions in the mid-1960s, Paolozzi's enthusiasm underwent a dramatic reversal during that decade. He taught at Berkeley for a short period in spring 1968, but found a different America from the one portrayed in the pages of Life magazine: 'my vision was coloured by a kind of America which was more like Updike rather than [. . .] Billy Wilder [. . .] it was more brutally realistic'.2 His disillusion emerged more fully in the 1971 Tate Gallery retrospective of his work, in which he took a highly critical position on the Vietnam War.3 This is unsurprising, and accurately reflects changing attitudes towards America during the period; yet it has meant that the earlier, more optimistic moment of cultural exchange has been obscured in accounts of Paolozzi's career.4 In addition, many of his important early sculptures, made before the dramatic change from cast bronze to welded aluminium in 1962, remain in the storage rooms of American museums. This article describes some of the events surrounding Paolozzi's 'bigger splash' on the East Coast, in particular his relationship with the American dealer Betty Parsons. Day books recording sales from the Hanover Gallery, London, show that a number of Paolozzi's works were sold to North American collectors following two exhibitions at the Gallery in 1956 and 1958.5 Most of these were relatively small works, the largest being Figure at just over sixty cm. high (sold to Robert Scull in June 1959). Since his first works made as a student at the Slade School of Fine Art just after the War, Paolozzi had been searching for both a style and technique that gave a sense of strong physical presence, and at the beginning of the 1950s began 38.

Guggenheim Museum, New York; photograph copyright Nathan Rosenberg; courtesy of the Conway Library, Courtauld Institute, London). experimenting with methods for making life-size and over life size cast metal sculptures. Such works could provide a sense of real physical encounter, comparable with Giacometti's standing figures in the post-War period, and could also equal the ambition of the mural-sized painting of the day. Paolozzi's discovery in 1956 of a way of constructing figures for casting with sheets of wax provided the key.

I began with clay rolled out on a table. Into the clay I pressed pieces of metal, toys, etc. I also sometimes scored the clay. From there I proceeded in one of two ways. Either I would pour wax directly on to the clay to get a sheet or I would pour plaster onto the clay. With the plaster I then had a positive and a negative form on which to pour wax. The wax sheets were pressed around forms, cut up and added to forms or turned into shapes on their own.6 Two of these imposing figures, Figure and St Sebastian no.2 (Fig.38), stood in the first museum display of Paolozzi's work in America, part of the 1958 exhibition Sculpture and Drawings from Seven Sculptors at the Guggenheim Museum in New York.7 'Paolozzi is the bad boy of sculpture, loaded with talent and capable of anything', wrote Sidney Geist in the New York-based Arts Magazine.8 Geist's description of the figures is one of the best contemporary responses to these works: 'In his lexicon a man is an upright structure with two rude nether supports that serve as legs, a central block for the torso, and a topping mass, punctured and pushed to suggest the cavities and protuberances of eyes, mouth, nose and ears'.9 The hollow intricate construction of the sculpture was achieved by welding together five separately cast pieces, creating what was in effect a three-dimensional collage structure.10 As a result of the exhibition, and thanks to the interest of James Johnson Sweeney, the Guggenheim purchased the large St Sebastian no.2 and an accompanying drawing. Interest in Paolozzi's work was gathering, witnessed by the publication in May the following year in Arts Magazine of the extensive and much-cited interview with Paolozzi by Edouard Roditi.11 The crucial moment, however, came the year after, with two major exhibitions. European art today: 35 Painters and Sculptors was held at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts in late September 1959, with the intention of countering the chauvinism of American artists and critics for whom European art could only be an epigone of American abstraction.12 Four sculptures by Paolozzi were included: Roman figure, Box-headed figure (both 1957), Figure no.70 and Little king (both 1958). 'The popular image of the human body, expanded by surgery, stiffened by injury, scarred by 6 Letter from Paolozzi to Angelica Rudenstine, 5 th August 1983, cited in R. Spencer, ed.: Eduardo Paolozzi: Writings and Interviews, Oxford 2000, p.80. 7 Four bronzes and a selection of drawings by Paolozzi were included. The bronzes were listed as Head (1957, bronze, h. 14Xin.); Small monument (1956, bronze, h. 13 in.), at that time in the collection of Mrs Henry (Irina) Moore; Figure (1957, bronze, h. 48# in.); and St Sebastian no.2 (1956, bronze, h. 64X in.). The exhibition ran from 12th February to 27th April. Although works by Paolozzi are often listed as having been included in an exhibition at the Galerie Chalette, New York, in 1956, there are no records of this in the Gallery archives; see Spencer, op. tit. (note 6), p. 3 36. 8 S. Geist: 'Month in Review', Arts Magazine 32/6 (1958), p.51. 9 Geist continues: 'Paolozzi works in wax, attaching odd shapes and bits, casts and prints of objects, to an integument which is already pierced and broken. He adds his material with what appears to be a rough, childish carelessness, but, in the bronze, his surprising, not to say shocking surfaces are suggestive when they are not merely fussy, while the profiles of his figures are always active and unpredictable. The general effect is crude, primitive and vitalistic'; ibid., p.51. 10 New York, Solomon R.

The method led to structural difficulties, a common problem with Paolozzi's work from this period; the sculpture was sent back to Paolozzi in summer 1959 for repair, after breaks were found at the point connecting the torso to the legs, causing the figure to begin to lean forward; '5/21/58 statement from Mr. Joseph Tembach', 10th November 1958; SGM. 11 E.

Selz included four works by Paolozzi, pungently describing them in the exhibition catalogue as 'necromantic fetishes of the technological world, automatons born of fragmentation'.18 The highlight of the display was undoubtedly the large figure Jason (1956; Fig.39). It is in fact just under life-size, and has a delicacy and fragility missing from other large figures, such as St Sebastian no.2. Paolozzi was inspired by a figure that could draw together the everyday and the world of myth: 'The subject was suggested by the music for the ballet MEDEA by Samual [sic] Barber(?) commissioned by Martha Graham. The briefing by the choreographer being that the symbol for Jason should exist on two time levels, the ancient and the modern worlds'.19 It was undoubtedly Paolozzi's most popular work, and certainly the best travelled. Although the Museum of Modern Art had purchased Jason in 1957 from Ten Young British Sculptors, the British section of the Sao Paulo Biennale, it was not available for display as a recent accession until 1963, 'because it has been touring Europe and South America including Venice (Biennale) and Sao Paulo (Bienal) [st'c] as a loan to the British Council; or it has been on loan to exhibitions in the U.S. — making a total of 17 cities', as Alfred Barr noted, adding that 'Ulysses' would have been a more appropriate title.20 Two further works in New Images of Man, Icarus II and Little king, had been lent from the Betty Parsons Gallery. Parsons had purchased Box-headed figure (Fig.40), included in the Pittsburgh International in 1958, and at the end of that year wrote to the artist asking to represent him in America.21 Paolozzi was enthu siastic, and replied that as he did not intend to renew his contract with the Hanover Gallery, he would be 'free to make my own decisions about the disposal of my work'.

The photographs of the wax model are a rare record of Paolozzi's method of fabrication using pre-formed sheets of wax into which various objects had been pressed, 'ghosts of forms that still haunt the bronze', as he later put it, and show how much of the 'antique' effect of the sculpture was due to the surface effect of the metal cast.23 Paolozzi's new association with the Betty Parsons Gallery meant that he was able to travel to America for the first time, arriving in New York on 18th March 1959.24 He was impressed by Parsons's sophistication: she belonged, he later wrote, to 'a vanishing breed of American cultured women like Elinor Ward of the Stable Gallery or even the American expatriates living in Paris after the war, perhaps in the shadow of Alice B. Toklas and Gertrude Stein'.25 But it was the spectacle of Manhattan that made the deepest impression. Paolozzi wrote in abbreviated style to his wife, Freda: 'First impressions emphasis on steel &amp; glass razor edge detailing very clean &amp; immaculate, lustrous quite nice. The drive in from Idlwild [sic] to Midtown, terribly interesting, everything as one imagines a few trees thousands of cars as far as the eye can see European ones rare. First glimpse of Manhatten [sic] with foreground of enormous cemetery covering acres and acres'.26 Later in life Paolozzi recalled this first visit, of walking down Madison Avenue, passing 'the most amazing windows of IBM containing giant bowls of bonsai and ikebana mixed with printed circuits. The IBM gallery was around the corner with an exhibition of Leonardo da Vinci models and was next to a dream toy-shop of immense size and invention'.2? It was in his memory an antediluvian moment for New York, 'still unaffected by drugs or muggings, still gentle and elegant like the wonderful Golden Era of cinema, the innocence of early Micky Rooney films or penthouses inhabited by William Powell and Myrna Loy'.28 Photographs of the first exhibition of Paolozzi's work at Betty Parsons's Gallery, at 15 East 57th Street, during March i960 of twelve sculptures, including Jason, show a strange collection of figures and animals that may well have appeared at odds with the elegant context (Fig.42).29 Scant documentation and Paolozzi's habit of giving generic titles to his sculptures — particularly often used is 'Figure' — and also the change and re-use of titles, make the few surviving photographs in the Betty Parsons Archive valuable for the purpose of identification. The exhibition was a success, eight of the works being sold, including the large standing figure Japanese war god, featured on the cover of the catalogue, to the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo (Fig.45), and the smaller work Little king to Mrs Albert A. List.30 Dore Ashton wrote in the New York Times of Paolozzi's bronze surfaces as 'complex as a cartographer's fantasy', and held the exhibition as confirmation of his 'indubitable position in Europe as one of the most vital artists of the post-war generation'.31 Even as Paolozzi's particular variant of European Brutalism began to find its way into a number of American public and private collections, his own work was undergoing a transforma tion, at least in part under the influence of what he had seen in America — the clean and immaculate architectural detailing, the glamour, the effortless combination of Leonardo da Vinci and IBM. And of course also from the art he saw: Diane Kirkpatrick has suggested that beginning with works such as Karakas (1964) Paolozzi was influenced by the sculpture of David Smith; indeed, Karakas was repainted in 1965 in a way that detracted from its similarity to the polished aluminium boxes of Smith's sculpture.32 To this name should be added that of Louise Nevelson, whom Paolozzi had met during his 1959 visit, and from whom he subsequently acquired a sculpture.33 It was a clean, industrial aesthetic that could also be seen in the work of Anthony Caro, whose work Paolozzi had recommended 23 Roditi, op. cit.

Although Robin Spencer has suggested (in conversation with the present author) the possibility of an earlier visit around 1954. It is, however, unclear how Paolozzi could have afforded such a trip, and why such a momentous experience, in the context of early Pop art, would have gone unrecorded. 25 NLSC; see also L.

I am very keen on creating a new kind of image employing methods other than wax'.37 The change in technique may have been in part due to the prohibitively high cost of casting — he was constantly complaining of this, and in February 1962 wrote to Parsons of the 'madness' of spending four thousand pounds in 1961 on casting, and that without 'a few sales to Patrons at a high figure the whole thing would have fallen apart'38 - but it was also part of a more fundamental shift in his work from figurative organic forms to architectural and engineered structures. This change was evident at the second exhibition of Paolozzi's work at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1962 (Fig.43).39 By contrast with the 'recent sculptures' approach of the i960 show, this display figured more as a retrospective, featuring earlier works such as Forms on a bow no. 2 and Two forms between two columns, both of 1948—49.40 More recent works, such as Wedding of the rock and dynamo (i960) and Triple fuse (i960; Fig.44), show clearly the new architectural impulse. Reviewing the exhibition, Brian Doherty reflected that Paolozzi's sculp tures were more successful when considered as architectural forms, particularly the large heads: 'They are composed of gaunt turrets, golden and burnished and perforated with holes leading into the darkness [. . .] one can walk around them as around a tower . . .'. By contrast, anthropomorphic figures such as Monkey man have a 'structural slackness like a badly inflated spacesuit'.41 Indeed, rather than develop a relationship between sculpture and architecture, as Moore was to do, Paolozzi responded to the crucial question of the public presence of sculpture by evolving the simple metaphor of the human figure seen as an architectural post-and-lintel construct: 'architecture as people', as Lawrence Alloway was to put it in the 1963 book on Paolozzi's work, The Metallization of a DreamA2 The large sculpture Tyrannical tower crowned with thorns of violence (1961; Fig.46) was meant to be included in the exhibition, and was in OPENING 4-7 P.

Betty Parsons's second exhibition was less successful, and two months after it had closed she wrote to report that only one work had sold, FSZP (1957). In fact it had been purchased in January before the show had opened.44 Six works were shipped back to Paolozzi that August,45 and the association between Paolozzi and Parsons swiftly dissolved. In response to a telegram from her in March 1964 suggesting an exhibition of drawings at her new gallery at 24 West 57th Street, Paolozzi responded briefly that he did not wish to be associated with any gallery during that year.46 Parsons wrote to Paolozzi in September expressing shock to learn that he had left the Gallery.47 The reply came from Robert Fraser, Paolozzi's new dealer, who pointed out that 'in view of the exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, and others in the offing at Museum level, neither of us quite frankly see what purpose could be served by a New York gallery at this juncture'.48 For Paolozzi, Fraser was the embodiment of the glamour and sophistication he had admired in America and, Paolozzi held, 'would have flourished much better in Manhattan, which, of course, he adored', but was more conveniently located in Mayfair, London.« By the time of Fraser's letter to Parsons, an exhibition was already installed in his Duke Street Gallery of recent aluminium sculptures by Paolozzi.5° The Museum of Modern Art display he referred to also consisted of four new aluminium sculptures, alongside related prints (Fig.48).51 These works were made in Ipswich, at C.W. Juby's 'Alpha' Engineering Works, where Paolozzi had been working since May 1961.52 It is true that Paolozzi did not completely sever his ties with America, and was subsequendy represented by the Pace Gallery.53 Yet it is clear that after 1962 America was no longer a source of illumination, and that Paolozzi was no longer an exotic European whose negative, grimly dystopian work could provide a counterpoint to triumphal American abstraction. Later in life he reflected on this striking reversal, perhaps with a touch of over-emphasis, commenting that 'people who don't live in America don't see the dark side, I mean the Saul Bellow America, the mountain of damaged souls, you know, that kind of lake of corpses, you tend not to see that when you live in Europe'.54 44 Not unfairly, Parsons pointed to the stock market crash of Spring 1962 as the prin cipal cause; letter from Betty Parsons to Paolozzi, 25th July 1962; the work was sold to Dr John Cook for $2,000, according to an invoice dated 24th January 1962; AAA-BP. 45 These were Paris bird (1948); Legs as lintels (1960/61); Table sculpture (1949/50); Two forms between two columns (1948/49); Flower no.2 (i960); and Asleep head (1957); untided document, 2nd August 1964; AAA-BP. 46 'how about showing drawings and collages march third-twenty EIGHTH TO identify YOUR NAME WITH THE NEW GALLERY STOP LAWRENCE ALLOWAY IS VERY enthusiastic ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY STOP YOU COULD AIRMAIL and we will frame them love betty'; telegram from Betty Parsons to Paolozzi, undated (probably January 1964); telegram reply, Paolozzi to Betty Parsons, 2nd February 1964; AAA-BP. 4? 'I am very shocked to find out from Douglas MacAgy, who is also very shocked, that you have left the gallery. You never mentioned this to me or conveyed and [sic] such thing when I saw you in London.
