<plain_text><page sequence="1">Concepts of Force: A Study in the Foundations of Dynamics. By Max Jammer. Harvard University Press. London: Oxford University Press. 1957. Pp. x + 269. 45s. A NOTABLE feature of modern history and philosophy of science is the abandonment of that kind of inductivism which undervalues the influence of conceptual ideas in the formation of theories and assumes that the truth is read off observations by the most empty minds and the most accurate instruments. There are still however too few studies of the development of the key concepts of science, and it is pleasant to be able to welcome this new work from Professor Jammer, who has already put us in his debt with his Concepts of Space. With a wealth of historical detail and citation of source material, much of it not easily available, Jammer traces the vicissitudes of the concept of force from its mythological origins to the present day. A chapter on 'Ancient Thought' shows force as a very general notion moulded by analogy with ordinary experience and having animistic, mythological, and theological connotations. A chapter on' Greek Science' shows the gradual disentanglement of ' force' from 'body' and its subsequent identification (by Plato) with soul, and (by Aristotle) with the power of self-movement residing in some bodies. The Stoic conception of forces as propagated universally by pneumata is then described and contrasted with the mechanical contact-action of Aristotle, and this is followed by a review of Aristotelian and Stoic influences in medieval and Renaissance science. In the work of Kepler we find the first quantitative discussion, and an explicit rejection of an animistic in favour of a corporeal notion of force as a result of his dis- covery that the velocity of a planet, supposed caused by the sun, diminishes with its distance from the sun. Next we see the classical mechanical ideas coming to birth in Galileo, Descartes, and Huygens, culminating in a detailed discussion of Newton's concept of force in the Principia and his speculations about an aetherial medium for gravitation. Regarding Newton's work as the watershed in the history of the concept of force, Jammer then leaves the discussion of technical developments in mechanics itself and devotes the 69</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS next four chapters to various interpretations of the notion of force-the theological interpretations of More and of Newton's immediate disciples; the dynamism, that is the metaphysical account of force as a primary property of substance, of Leibniz, Boscovich, and Kant; the mechanistic view which led to many attempts to develop a corpuscular theory of gravitation; and the 'critical' analysis of force as a relational construct, from Berkeley to Mach. Finally there is a chapter on contemporary science in which brief sketches of the place of force in quantum, nuclear, and relativity theory are given, concluding with the possibility of its ultimate elimination in the projected unified field theories. Jammer has sought to be comprehensive rather than to argue any specific theses, nevertheless form his assembled sources a general pattern emerges which might be called the ' life-cycle ' of a concept. We see the concept of force growing up amid a welter of animism and metaphysics, its coming to maturity in Newton, its struggles even then to cast off the clinging hands of false metaphysical interpretations, its subsequent emanci- pation as a pure construct justifying itself solely in terms of the work it does in the correlation of experience, and its final supercession by younger concepts (energy or space-curvature) and death, its work being finished. That the book falls into this pattern is due to the fact that Jammer has chosen to take as definitive of 'force' what appears under that name at a particular stage in the history of physics, namely in the Principia Mathe- matica. Now obviously some method of selection has to be adopted in writing history, and this is a legitimate one, but it does suffer from certain disadvantages. In the first place there is the temptation to read the 'pre- history' of the concept wholly in terms of a fumbling after things half- realised, and to look for the main significance of early science in its supposed anticipations of later, successful, theories. On the whole Jammer's detailed and sympathetic accounts of Greek and medieval thought avoid this tempta- tion and are given with a real feeling for historical context, but there are some jarring notes. I am not convinced for example that the true flavour of the Stoic theories of pneumata is conveyed by comparison with the action at a distance of classical physics, nor that justice is done to the real originality of Aristotelian mechanism, in comparison with which Stoic theories of force were a reversion to the primitive. Again, Jammer's interpretation of Roger Bacon's 'multiplication of species ' as analogous to the propa- gation of a wave, and as containing some inkling of conservation of energy, obscures the wholly non-modern character of this theory, in which trans- mission of the image of an object to the eye, and of magnetic force, is comparable with the reproductive propagation of an animal species. Jammer is careful to explain the linguistic variations and ambiguities in the word 'force' from the Greek dynamis to the nineteenth-century German Kraft, but he surely has the cart before the horse when he suggests 70</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW S (p. 13 and elsewhere) that ambiguity of terms led to confusion of thought. It is not that precise senses distinct in themselves had to be disentangled from vague and ambiguous words, but that the precise senses had to be created by discovering the theories in which they are used. The history of the distinctions made between ' force', 'energy',' momentum',' work', is the history of mechanics. Another danger inherent in tracing the history of a particular concept rather than a perennial problem (for example, 'how do bodies act upon one another ? '), is that its metaphysical accompaniments must seem in the end to be accidental and dispensable. The impression is also given that the progress of science in general (not merely the concept of force) is (in Comtean fashion) from an animistic, through a metaphysical, to a positivistic stage, and this does indeed seem to be Jammer's philosophy of science, as outlined in his first chapter. Here he remarks that today science does not offer 'a photographic picture and true image of reality' (p. 2), but only a description of experience and general principles under which experience can be sub- sumed and by means of which predictions can be made. The resulting theories are described in terms of a conceptual deductive system and its rules of interpretation into the data of experience, and Jammer remarks that the choice of concepts is arbitrary, since various systems could be made to work by changing the rules of interpretation. Thus the history of a concept in its formative period is the study of the extra-scientific influences which led to one conceptual scheme rather than another. Now if this were true, it would surely be unnecessary to enter into these accidental formative influences in order to understand a concept in modern physics-only an understanding of the formal relations within the deductive system and its interpretations would be necessary, and it is indeed in this belief that most scientists consider the history of their subject to be fundamentally irrelevant. Jammer clearly does not believe this, for one of his declared aims is to address himself to ' the frightening discrepancy between our technical "know-how" and our philosophical incomprehension . . . [which] seriously endangers the integrity of our intellectual outlook' (p.v.), and he believes that his historical-critical analysis will meet this need. His insight into the importance of historical background is not consistent with his explicit philosophy of science. Jammer has, I think, been misled by a false analogy between the de- velopment of a single concept and the conditions of progress of science as a whole. Of course if attention is concentrated on a concept whose sense and use is fully determined by its place in a finished theory, such as the concept of force in classical mechanics, then its metaphysical ancestry and con- temporary interpretations will be irrelevant, but, as clearly emerges from Jammer's account, the concept is then as good as dead and ripe for elimination. What does not clearly emerge from this way of treating the matter is that 71</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS the various metaphysical interpretations of Newtonian force were pro- ductive of new concepts, for example fields of force and energy. How can Jammer assert (p. 187) that 'the conception of force as the primordial element of physical reality . .. was not very fruitful and productive for the advancement of theoretical physics ', when only three pages earlier he has described its influence on Faraday, and has previously discussed the Leibnizian concept of energy ? A similar confusion arises in connection with the mechanistic theories of gravitation. Because Jammer regards the 'critical' view of force as a relational construct as not merely reflecting its use at a particular period of its history, but as the only ultimately correct view for this and any other concept, he considers that 'any attempt of a mechanistic theory to replace . . . this functional concept of force by the assumption of a chain of causal contiguous actions, was doomed to failure ' (p. 249). This is both to underestimate the influence of a metaphysical demand for contact-action (shown for example in modern field theory) and to mistake the positivist interpretation of theories for a prescription as to what kind of theories they shall be. Even if the positivist interpretation is accepted, there is no reason why theories involving spatio-temporal contiguity should not be more satisfactory than action-at-a-distance theories. It should also be remarked that the concept of cause in general is not to be identified with the concept of force, even though this identi- fication may have been reasonable in the time of Kant, and the elimination of force from physics does not imply the elimination of cause. Finally, is it true that the concept of force in modern physics merely 'plays the role of a methodological intermediate comparable to the so- called middle term in the traditional syllogism' (p. 244) ? Jammer thinks that a reconstruction of force in this sense will eliminate the metaphysical, a priori, intuitive and anthropomorphic elements which he claims (pp. 121, 124, 162, 209) to find in Newton. But Newton here shows more insight than most of his commentators. In the Principia (end of Scholium to Definition VIII) Newton's argument is this: if two bodies are accelerated relative to each other there will be observable effects of a definite accelera- tion in one or both of them (tension in a rope or concave surface of water in a rotating bucket). Hence acceleration is an absolute property of a moving body. Hence we can identify a system of inertial frames (Newton thought one of these was primary, but this is here irrelevant). Newton now defines force as that which produces acceleration, in his Definition IV (since he explicitly makes this a definition it is somewhat gratuitous to assume as Jammer does on page 124 that after all he meant to do something else). Hence force can be said to be an absolute cause of the acceleration. Nothing in the theory of relativity has altered this situation, for we do in fact distinguish inertial from accelerated frames, however the difference between them may be explained. That this is so is shown by the following 72</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS example: suppose we observe two mutually accelerated bodies A and B of which only A shows internal effects of acceleration (e.g. two trains in one of which the passengers feel their backs pressing against the seats). Then we can interpret the situation in two ways: either as the acceleration of A, or as the effect of a force acting on both bodies creating an acceleration effect in A (which is actually stationary) and exactly cancelling out the effect in B (which is actually accelerating). Now if there are no other bodies in the vicinity which could explain the force in the second interpretation we always prefer the first interpretation. This shows that we regard force (the ability to produce acceleration) as a property only of bodies. Hence, although the mathematical sign for force may be a mere intermediate and eliminable term, the interpretation of this term is not. We must know what kinds of entities exert what kinds of forces even in order to calculate accelerations, and Jammer tacitly admits this (p. 244) when he defines force in terms of configurations of masses, charges, magnets, etc. In this sense, and in this sense only, our (and Newton's) concept of force remains absolute. If I have found matters of philosophical interpretation to criticise in this book, that should not detract from our gratitude to Professor Jammer for his highly stimulating and informative study.
