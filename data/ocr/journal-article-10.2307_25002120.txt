<plain_text><page sequence="1">EQUALITY OR DIVINITY A False Dichotomy? Morny Joy The French feminist Luce Irigaray has always shown an interest in religious themes. In her first major work to be translated into English, Speculum of the Other Woman, she explores the world of feminine mysticism in "La Mysterique."' Irigaray frankly admits that this is a world of passivity and powerlessness, yet one that allows a woman some measure of autonomy and self-expression. Nevertheless, divine election to this state could be regarded as a dubious privilege, given the language Irigaray uses to describe the condition. And perhaps He has chosen her body to inscribe His will, even if she is less able to read the inscription, poorer in language, "crazier" in her speech, burdened with matter(s) that history has laid on her, shackled in/by speculative plans that paralyse her desire.2 In her other work from this period Irigaray was concerned with delineat ing a specific feminine identity based on an understanding of difference that did not subscribe to the traditional forms of opposition.3 Woman-as-other was not to be construed according to inferior, negative or antagonistic modes. Her difference was a separate but equal realm that had its own distinct form 1 Luce Irigaray, Speculum of the Other Woman, trans. Gillian C. Gill (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1985), 191-202. Originally published in French as Speculum de l'autrefemme (Paris: Les Editions de minuit, 1974). "La Mysterique" is not translated, for as the translator notes on 191, "The French title's economy and richness cannot be matched in English. Four elements are fused in Luce Irigaray's neologism: mysticism, hysteria, mystery, and the femaleness [la mysterique] fundamental to the previous three." 2 Ibid., 198. 3 Irigaray's use of the term feminine is problematic. She is well aware of the distinction between the biological and social aspects of a woman's identity, but it is extremely difficult in her texts to distinguish the exact meaning of the term. This is due to Irigaray's expressed intention, within the rubrics of a deconstuctive approach, both to avoid and to question the ambiguity that has existed in the term's previous usages. See This Sex which is not One, trans. Catherine Porter (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1985), 155-56. As a result, Irigaray's theory seems at times biologically based, at times metaphorically exuber ant, while at others her work encourages the redefinition of the notion of "feminine" as a social construction. It would appear such "imprecision" is inevitable if one endeavors to "think and speak beyond" current usage.</page><page sequence="2">10 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion of expression. For Irigaray articulation of this difference remains the question of ultimate importance. She understands its status as crucial for this era. Sexual difference is one of the important questions of our age, if not in fact the burning issue. According to Heidegger, each age is preoc cupied with one thing, and one alone. Sexual difference is probably that issue in our age which could be our salvation on an intellectual level.4 There are numerous studies that endeavor to elaborate Irigaray's ideas on this difference and its possible forms of expression.5 In recent years, however, her attention has turned more specifically to the question of religion and its implications for her theory of difference. Though only avail able in French, the articles on this topic are of immense interest, particularly the one entitled "Equal to Whom?" which is a critical review of Elisabeth Schiissler Fiorenza's In Memory of Her.6 It is a pity that Irigaray's review indicates she is unaware of the various debates that have been conducted in print and verbally in the Women and Religion Section of the American Academy of Religion over the past fifteen years.7 Schiissler Fiorenza's work, though monumental, is not an isolated effort, and it has been enriched by the varying viewpoints of other feminists in religion. Nevertheless, Irigaray's review of Schiissler Fiorenza merits discussion both because of the issues she raises and as an indicator of the priorities inherent in her approach. It also helps focus the current state of debate in women and religion on the subject of divine imagery, and in this article I would like to address both these concerns. The initial stumbling block for most North American feminists confront ing Irigaray's work is its highly theoretical nature. In her ideas she is indebted to the work of two maverick male thinkers, Jacques Derrida and Jacques Lacan. Both men supported structures of knowledge that are charac terized by a signifier that no longer has any intrinsic relation to what it 4 Luce Irigaray, "Sexual Difference," in French Feminist Thought, ed.

Nevertheless Irigaray has visited North America and taught here, and so she could have informed herself to some degree about the context out of which Schiissler Fiorenza's book arose. This would seem a reasonable scholarly demand for a review that is so highly critical.</page><page sequence="3">Joy: Equality or Divinity-A False Dichotomy? 11 signifies. That is, no meaning has any stability, let alone claim to truth. Whether the result of this maneuver is merely to acknowledge that meaning is culturally constructed, or to open wide the floodgates of relativism, is still a matter of some debate.8 Derrida's position in particular undermines the old logic of opposition and its concomitant dualistic mind-set that has pervaded Western thinking. In this respect Derrida's approach has proved attractive for those feminists who believe that such a mode of thinking has been inimical to women. It is questionable, however, whether Derrida's crafty deployments of language can in any way be construed as supporting the feminist cause. At the same time, the revised psychoanalytic theory of Lacan, enshrining the phallus as the dominant symbolic mode of our culture, is highly suspect as a feminist ally. So before investigating Irigaray's critique of Schiissler Fiorenza and its implications, I would like to examine in some detail the basis of Irigaray's construct of feminine difference. It seems to me that her theoretical founda tion relies on two somewhat specious analogies drawn from Derrida and Lacan that put her whole program into question. Derrida's deconstructive invocation of difference, a neologism that stands for a pluralist, nondichotomizing mode of differentiation, has come to mean many things to many people.9 Most specifically it indicates a strategy for unmasking the univocal pretensions of any text. When meaning is con strued as inherently multiple, then truth, as defined either by the meta physics of presence or according to the correspondence theory, no longer prevails. More broadly, difference and its deconstructive approach has come to represent anything that does not conform to the standards of logic, rightness, goodness, respectability that have demarcated the rules of the game within the Western tradition. Thus, anything that has been cast to the underside of the good/bad configuration can now assert its rights. The trouble is that the list of those who can claim deconstruction as their ally is endless. Deconstruction can be invoked in the name of the class struggle, the underdeveloped world, racial injustice-as well as sexism. Of itself, deconstruction does not favor feminism, though the principal analogy that Irigaray wants to emphasize is one between deconstruction and a feminine expression of difference. If he is to be consistent with his theory, Derrida cannot, in delineating his position, use one term as the name of his approach. Consequently he 8 For some differing opinions on this matter see: Christopher Norris, Deconstruction: Theory and Practice (London: Methuen, 1982); Richard Bernstein, "Serious Play: The Ethical-Political Horizon of Jacques Derrida," The Journal of Speculative Philosophy 1/2 (1987): 93-117; G. B. Madison, "Postmodern Philosophy?" Critical Review (Spring/ Summer 1988): 166-182. 9 For Derrida's own attempt to explain his understanding of the term see Positions, trans. Alan Bass (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), 8-10.</page><page sequence="4">12 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion employs key terms in addition to difference, such as pharmakon, supple ment, gram, spacing, to indicate his rejection of any "teleological and totaliz ing dialectics."'0 I was startled to find such words as hymen and invagination also used as exemplars in some of his writings. Apart from shock tactics, why is Derrida using such loaded expressions as rubrics of deconstruction? It soon becomes obvious that for Derrida these two latter words are neutral terms, and carry no connotations whatever of femininity. They are used in the same destabilizing spirit with which he entertains the term dissemination (where Derrida himself alludes to its "common parentage of seme and semen") which he attests has no overt masculine implications. They are all asexual terms, part of Derrida's verbal pyrotechnics. If Derrida is not a feminist (and he has certainly been evasive about any allegiance) and yet employs such sensitive female-related terms in a provocative and gratuitous fashion, I feel it is in order to question feminists such as Irigaray who, without hesitation, have adopted his tactics as appropriate to the feminist cause. I would question this approach even if it is undertaken in the name of a pluralism that undermines "masculine" monolithic meanings. In my opinion, what deconstruction contributes to the feminist cause is essentially a theoretical postulate, which is at best suspect, and should be treated with caution. This is not to say that feminists may not use deconstruc tive techniques to demonstrate how certain texts have presumed a mag isterial status they do not deserve, but one must be wary of the resultant claims. Deconstruction is a critical tool of a limited nature, that lends itself to a retrospective analysis of texts. Of itself it cannot provide grounds for formulating any creative response-for arriving at a feminine mode of ex pression, if that is the aim of the exercise. What deconstruction provides as a result of its disruptive tactics is a disjunctive space in which women may explore appropriate ways and means of a self-articulation that is predomi nantly critical and reactive. Irigaray's theoretical form thus has need of a particular context and content if it is to answer more pertinently to women's needs. To do this Irigaray implements her Derridean format with a second analogy that she adapts from Jacques Lacan's rereading of Freudian theory. Lacan's elliptical texts, especially those concerning women, do not at first offer any consolation for those seeking a revised Freudian insight into women or the nature of the feminine. Several women scholars have bravely ventured plausible interpre tations,ll but it is Irigaray alone who has both explicated and challenged Lacan's thought. 10 Ibid., 42-45. 11 See the two introductory essays by Juliet Mitchell and Jacqueline Rose in Feminine Sexuality: Jacques Lacan and the Ecole freudienne, ed. Juliet Mitchell and Jacqueline Rose (New York: W.W. Norton, 1983).</page><page sequence="5">Joy: Equality or Divinity-A False Dichotomy? 13 A central tenet of Lacan's development of the Freudian script is his distinction between the Imaginary (pre-Oedipal) and the Symbolic. The Imaginary as the pre-Oedipal phase is marked by a symbiotic relationship with the mother involving a state of total satisfaction and absorption. It is preverbal. The subsequent Symbolic stage is characterized by the resolution of the Oedipus complex, which entails acceptance of the law of the father, that is, of societal norms, including gender roles. For Lacan, as distinct from Freud, this admittance to society is marked by the acquisition of language the principal instrument by which the rule of the father is enforced. The phallus stands as the symbol nonpareil of this negotiation. The phallus, however, is also a symbol of the desire for the lost plenitude of the Imaginary period. In this connection, Lacan enlarges the Freudian observation that slips in language are clues to repressed conflicts that result from the acceptance of civilization's rules. Lacan holds that language is a perpetual symptom of the state of constant desire that marks our exile from the bliss of the Imaginary. This desire can never be fulfilled. And so it is that language is caught in a structure of signifiers that can never adequately capture meaning. Lacan's phallic displacements are a psychological equivalent of Derrida's tactics of constant deferral of closure in meaning. Lacan's theory, though it is an amendment of Freud, never renounces the definite male bias evident in Freud and his followers. It portrays women as less likely to accede to these demands of civilization and so as having weaker super-egos, while at the same time it implies that women are far more likely to exhibit pathological behaviour, for example, hysteria and paranoia. Irigaray understands this disparaging portrayal of women as a repression on the part of male analysts in trying to understand women. This accounts for Freud's lifelong perplexity over women's needs. Irigaray herself was expelled from the Ecole freudienne of Paris (presided over by Lacan) for daring to voice what she felt were appropriate responses to Freud's question and Lacan's provocations.12 Concomitantly, however, and this is the basis of her analogy, Irigaray identifies this Freudian repression of women with the exclusion that they have suffered from Western mainstream thought. Her book Speculum of the Other Woman is a brilliant multifaceted exploration of this theme. This sexual repression and textual (structural) omission has led Irigaray to postulate forms of sexual/textual liberation where jouissancel3 and le parlerfemme ("womanspeak")'4 are the key terms. It is here that body and 12 Jacques Lacan, "God and the Jouissance of -he Woman," Ibid., 146. 13 Irigaray, "This Sex Which Is not One," This Sex, 23-33 and Speculum, 353-64. 14 Irigaray, "Any Theory of the 'Subject' has always been Appropriated by the 'Mas culine,'" Speculum, 140-44.</page><page sequence="6">14 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion expression can combine in a unique fashion that is markedly feminine. Irigaray hesitates to formulate the exact nature of such expressions, yet questions whether the feminine does not, in part, consist of what is operating in the name of the unconscious? Whether a certain "specificity" of woman is not repressed/censured under cover of what is designated as the unconscious? Thus many of the characteristics attributed to the unconscious may evoke an economy of desire that would be, perhaps, "feminine. "15 In other words Irigaray is proposing the provocative and revolutionary idea that virtually all things feminine have been relegated to the Western unconscious. It is for this reason that, though she questions Freud and Lacan, she does not reject psychoanalysis. It may provide her with the clue for what she is seeking. But this idea of itself does not solve all problems. There would have to be a period of preparatory sifting out to determine just what it is that the unconscious contains of the feminine before Irigaray could ever hope to begin to articulate what would constitute an authentic feminine unconscious, let alone an authentic feminine. This would involve a type ofhermeneutics of suspicion or an ideological critique of the historical determinations of all those theories, including psychoanalysis, that have repressed women-a mammoth task, the beginnings of which appear in Speculum. This critique, however, still does not provide sufficient ground for Irigaray to begin to formulate just what the feminine unconscious and feminine expression might resemble. Irigaray realizes that such an articula tion may not be possible for the present, if ever. Irigaray is aware that she is held captive by the structures of the very system that she is trying to change. How can we speak so as to escape from their compartments, their schemas, their distinctions and oppositions: Virginal/deflowered, pure/impure, innocent/experienced. ... How can we shake off the chain of these terms, free ourselves from their categories, rid our selves of their names? Disengage ourselves, alive, from their con cepts?'6 But for the moment she feels there are forms of expression that are open to her and to women. As noted, Irigaray has appropriated a sexual/textual form of liberation where le parler femme ("womanspeak") is a term in her own search for an appropriate mode of expression for women. Her tactics are those of adopting, consciously and deliberately, the predominant male voice but always in a parodying, undermining mode. Irigaray's prose becomes elliptical and evocative. At times literal, at times figurative. Always subtle 15 Irigaray, This Sex, 123. 16 Ibid., 212.</page><page sequence="7">Joy: Equality or Divinity-A False Dichotomy? 15 and evasive, another variant on Derrida's subversions. But can such mimicry achieve anything? Her plan seems to be to show by ridicule the excesses and overdeterminations of men's methods. It is a tricky path. If this ironic mode constitutes for Irigaray the grounding of that autonomous expression of the difference that is woman, it would seem that women are still trapped in the confines of a theory that originally omitted them or defined them as re pressed. The type of expression that this location allows women may question but never overturn the dominant matrix out of which that theory arose. As a result, I believe that Irigaray's explorations, though bold and innovative, raise as many questions as they answer. Andrea Nye voices her misgivings about the basis of Irigaray's notion of feminine difference in the following way. The hope of "ecriture feminine" was that feminism could finally move beyond masculine political, economic and psychoanalytic thought. However, once post-structuralist theory identified masculine thought with symbolic meaning, the feminine "beyond" became a vacuum which could only be filled with fragments of poetry and fantasy. What was to have been outside masculine thought became what rational thought was not-a definition that prescribed a specific place and function for the "feminine." Again, femininity was placed within men's accounts of their own conflictual relations.17 Irigaray's essentialist view of women is then indeed a puzzling one. 18 In positing a feminine difference she invokes a radical otherness that would function on its own terms beyond the world of the phallus, that is, beyond language and gender as it is presently constituted. Apart from its use as a hypothetical measure of inspiration, it is difficult to understand the actual parameters of such a vision. The only possible locale would be communities of women completely isolated from men, a separatist situation that Irigaray, as evidenced by her other writings, clearly does not endorse. Irigaray's world never excludes men. It is this ungrounded utopian dimension that I believe is the basic problem with Irigaray's vision-a vision that results from purely theoretical constructs. Irigaray's work is inspirational and persuasive, yet unsatisfactory in terms of its practical applications. This preliminary excursus is a necessary preface to Irigaray's critique of 17 Andrea Nye, Feminist Theory and the Philosophies of Man (London: Croom Helm, 1988), 208. 18 The debate as to whether Irigaray is an essentialist or not is a heated one. Perhaps the most trenchant criticism of Irigaray is Monique Plaza's "'Phallomorphic Power' and the Psychology of'Woman,'" Ideology and Consciousness 4 (Autumn 1978): 57-76. Originally published in Questions feministes 1 (1978). More recent discussion tends to focus on whether this essentialism should be construed in a negative light. See Diana J. Fuss, "'Essentially Speaking': Luce Irigaray's Language of Essence," Hypatia 3/3 (Winter 1989): 62-80.</page><page sequence="8">16 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion Elisabeth Schiissler Fiorenza, where the construct of difference figures prominently. The basic premise that informs Irigaray's criticism is that to achieve autonomy (and hence the status of difference) in religion women must be able to envisage themselves as God. Are we capable of imagining, of portraying God as a woman? The perfection of our subjectivity? The goal which encompasses all the strivings of our subjectivity?19 As previously observed, Irigaray's work unfortunately reveals an un familiarity with the richness and complexity of the recent discussions by North American women thinkers in religion. Sallie McFague's book, Meta phorical Theology: Models of God in Religious Language, draws up prelimi nary, if somewhat simplistic guidelines for making distinctions between two main camps of thought.20 In comparing revolutionists and reformers McFague states that revolutionists view the Jewish and Christian traditions as irredeemably patriarchal and concentrate their efforts on affirming female experience and principles. (According to this qualification Irigaray could be classed with the revolutionaries.) Reformers, on the other hand, are com mitted to re-visioning the tradition in ways that honor the feminine element, as well as women, in other than compensatory fashion (i.e., the hackneyed image of the Virgin Mary as the idealization of womanhood, or as the feminine side of God). This is not the place to contest McFague's assignation of various thinkers, for example, Carol Christ, Judith Plaskow, Naomi Goldenberg, Mary Daly as a group within the revolutionary camp, or her amalgamation of the diverse stances of those she names reformers, for example, Rosemary Ruether, Phyllis Trible, Elisabeth Schiissler Fiorenza.21 But she does present suc cinctly the core issue involved in a way that mirrors Irigaray's concerns. Nonetheless, from the reformers' point of view, the greatest contribu tion of the revolutionary feminist theologians lies in asking the ques tion: whether a feminine model for the divine-human relationship is not only needed but also desirable, not just for women or for ad herents to a new religion, but for all people and for Christianity? The revolutionaries have posed the question; it will be up to the reformers to see if the Christian paradigm has any resources for answering it.22 19 Irigaray, "Femmes Divines," 299 (translation mine). 20 Sallie McFague, Metaphorical Theology: Models of God in Religious Language (Phila delphia: Fortress Press, 1982). McFague's division of reformers and revolutionaries is not new. I believe its earliest use was in Sheila Collins, A Different Heaven and Earth (Valley Forge, Pa.: Judson Press, 1974), 41. 21 There are many rich discussions and debates of the works of these prominent feminist religious thinkers available. I do not wish to be repetitive in this regard. For a good overall summary see the work of Anne Carr, Transforming Grace: Christian Tradition and Women's Experience (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1988). There is an especially extensive bibliography. 22 McFague, Metaphorical Theology, 164.</page><page sequence="9">Joy: Equality or Divinity-A False Dichotomy? 17 In her own attempt to take a position on this issue, McFague identifies herself with the reformers. She believes that what is at stake is a reinterpreta tion, or rather reaffirmation, of the root metaphor of Christianity. For McFague, this root metaphor is one of liberation, of a founding principle of a type of relationship, which embraces all people in their struggle for freedom from any form of domination. In this attitude she walks in the company of both Ruether, who espouses the prophetic tradition within the Jewish and Christian heritage, and Schiissler Fiorenza who supports solidarity with all oppressed who seek liberation. But it is McFague alone who advocates a metaphorical theology. For her this founding metaphor designates a fluid relationship, not an entity.23 This relationship between God and human beings is an open-ended one and cannot be confined by the constraints of a particular time and period. Nor can it ever be entirely encapsulated in any model or metaphor. In that the relationship is also one that promotes human flourishing, it mitigates against any expressions that are restrictive. Hence, it rejects any sexist formulas that have prevented women from participating in religious activities as part of the Christian legacy and promise. In a later work, Models of God: Theology for an Ecological, Nuclear Age, McFague discusses the need for referring to God in both male and female imagery.24 Here she focuses primarily on retrieving positive and embodied images of God, for example, the notion of mother to balance the image of father, as a way of extending the metaphor of parental love. In that both male and female forms of the deity are reassessed, this work remains steadfastly within the reformist agenda. McFague is only too aware of the criticisms that have been levelled at this consolidatory movement, and attempts to balance it with a reference to the weakness of the revolutionary attitude. The dangers of both positions are obvious: those who focus on women's liberation can be accused of merely "turning the tables," advocating a matriarchy to replace the patriarchy, while those who focus on human liberation can be accused of being "co-opted by the establishment," engaging in a softheaded reform which can do little to undermine the power of patriarchy. 25 Rosemary Ruether in her book Sexism and God-Talk has also adopted a 23 Sallie McFague is aware that her metaphorical theology will not meet with approval from all adherents of Christianity. Early in the book Metaphorical Theology (28), she presents her apologia. "The aim of metaphorical theology, as we recall, is to envision ways of talking about the relationship between the divine and the human which are non idolatrous but relevant: ways which can be said to be true without being literal; ways which are meaningful to all people, the traditionally excluded as well as the included. Such a theology, I believe, is appropriate to the Protestant sensibility and I have suggested clues to its character from the parables of Jesus and Jesus as parable." 24 McFague, Models of God: Theology for an Ecological, Nuclear Age (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1987). 25 McFague, Metaphorical Theology, 152.</page><page sequence="10">18 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion provisional scenario of classification regarding the various attitudes of women towards reformulating a religious world view.26 Initially Ruether describes these options according to socioeconomic variations as liberal, Marxist, and radical. On the religious question these categories become somewhat more complex, with gradations along a spectrum of psychosocial motivations which range from romantic-separatist to integrationist-equal. Ruether's own path toward an articulation of a feminist theology is a pluralist (not relativist) one: she believes that neither orthodox nor heretical Christianity incorporates the totality of perspectives needed for an authentic feminist vision. Adherents of all positions, in Ruether's view, should become aware of the limitations inherent in their approaches, though her own preference is for those reform ers seeking a re-visioning of a unitary conception of deity according to the Jewish and Christian traditions. Ruether is also wary of the Romantic sepa ratism and/or complementarity she feels an ahistorical adoption of Goddess religion introduces. Nevertheless, Ruether's final invocation of the deity is startling to those who expected merely a revised standard version of the divine. To return Home: to learn the harmony, the peace, the justice of body, bodies in right relation to each other. The whence we have come and whither we go, not from alien skies but here, in the community of earth. Holy One, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth. ... A new thing is revealed; the woman will encompass the warrior. Thou shalt not hurt, thou shalt not kill in all my holy mountain. The Shalom of the Holy; the disclosure of the gracious Shekinah; Divine Wisdom; the empowering Matrix; She, in whom we live and move and have our being-She comes; She is here.27 Irigaray, ignorant of the niceties of these developments, bases her rebut tal of Schiissler Fiorenza on a simplistic reading of the reformist agenda. As Irigaray interprets Schiissler Fiorenza's thesis, the latter's understanding of liberation for women depends on their being allowed access to those forms of the Church's structures that have been denied them. For Irigaray this is tantamount to a sellout to those masculine forces that have dominated Christianity and formed God in their own image. In contrast, the reading that Irigaray gives to the Christ event is that by becoming human God has divinized humanity. For Irigaray the denied inheritance that women must claim is that of divinization. In this connection Irigaray does not appear to want to make a sharp distinction between (a) changing the God image to that of the feminine, and (b) divinizing the female of the species. She uses the two ideas interchangeably. (Irigaray also has no intention of avoiding heretical imperatives; in fact she courts them, e.g., the 26 Rosemary Ruether, Sexism and God-Talk (Boston: Beacon Press, 1983). 27 Ibid., 226.</page><page sequence="11">Joy: Equality or Divinity-A False Dichotomy? 19 divinization of humanity.) Surprisingly, for Irigaray this divinization involves a celebration of God made couple: man and woman together, in the divine as well as human sphere. This is because Irigaray believes that it is sexuality within the human sphere that has proved to be the stumbling block for divinization of humanity. In this she may not be wrong, but the problematic issue of feminine difference again enters the scene. If it is to be the sexual relationship itself that marks the locus of divinity, how is the feminine difference that Irigaray seeks to express itself in the feminine mode? Irigaray's argument here seems to establish two distinct claims: one, that human sexuality should finally be accorded an apotheosis of sorts; the other, that it is women who need to be able to appreciate their own exaltation as god/goddess. Given the disastrous history of the identification of sexuality and women within Christianity, these claims may not be incompatible. But Irigaray leaves her argument in a rather nebulous form with regard to the expression of feminine difference in a divine state. It is in connection with this need for divinization that Irigaray discloses her principal discomfort with Schiissler Fiorenza's work. She suggests that at work in Schiissler Fiorenza is a spirit similar to that found in women in contemporary post-religious Europe. Irigaray feels that these women in their quest for equality have become "neutered" and have never reclaimed the heritage of their female identity. If Irigaray means that feminine identity requires an appreciation of female autonomy that does not deny a woman's particular qualities, Irigaray is in accord with many other feminists. In this instance, Irigaray's notion of feminine difference can be appreciated without the encumbrance of heavy theoretical baggage. Such a move requires re evaluations and reclamation of certain "feminine" characteristics that have been marginalized or tokenized by the dominant tradition. Whether or not one regards these traits as essential or cultural designations is a further matter for debate.28 An equally important issue, however, and one that Irigaray evades is the need to question alleged "masculine" traits and women's appropriation of them. For what is at stake here is both the self-respect and empowerment of women. Irigaray is vitally concerned that women realize their full poten tialities. In that she sees this as fundamentally a task of psychological and spiritual growth, Irigaray believes that the only means commensurate with the desired effect is employing the most potent symbol possible-that of divinity. It is not enough to concede that the son of God was born of woman, or that in complex configurations of esoteric doctrine Mary figures as mother/ daughter/wife of God. Nothing short of divinity in her own right will satisfy Irigaray. 28 At this stage I do not consider the evidence conclusive on either side, if it ever can be so.</page><page sequence="12">20 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion The basic question, of course, is what type of discourse is being used here. Is it metaphorical or symbolic, psychological or theological? In a response that may seem flippant, I ask, Does it matter? To take a cue from Derrida, I suggest that we have a case of the logic of both/and, and the drawing of doctrinal or theoretical distinctions at this stage of exploration into our heritage is somewhat premature. Speculative experiments of possible ways of being and imaging are in order. But unfortunately this is one instance where Irigaray does not follow in Derrida's footsteps, or remain consistent with her own approach. For she makes her argument depend on either equality or divinity, and concludes that Schiissler Fiorenza's text is not effective because it is written in the cause of equality. Anyone who has done a close reading of Schiissler Fiorenza is well aware that equality of women with men is not the ultimate concern in this work. Schiissler Fiorenza's thesis could hardly be described as a proposal that women achieve parity with men in the cultic practices and structures of the church as they exist today. Her depiction of the ekklesia of women grounded in the sophia lineage, which supports a discipleship of equals, has as its primary inspiration the empowerment of women-not as participants in ritual, but as agents of their own liberation. It is, in fact, a definite rejection of church structures as they exist today in the name of a different ekklesia that once existed, yet has been denied women. Why then can churchmen not understand and accept that Christian women gather together for the sake of our spiritual survival as Chris tians and women persons? It is not over and against men that we gather together but in order to become ekklesia before God, deciding matters affecting our own spiritual welfare and struggle.29 Schiissler Fiorenza would deny that women have been unilaterally re pressed. It is the fact and significance of their participation in the narrative of humanity that they have been deprived of. Schiissler Fiorenza would be in basic agreement with Gerda Lerner, who asserts that, like men, women are and always have been actors and agents in history. Since women are half and sometimes more than half of humankind, they have always shared the world and its work equally with men .... Women have "made history," yet they have been kept from knowing their history and from interpreting history, either their own or that of men. Women have been systematically excluded from the enterprise of creating symbol systems, philosophies, science and law.30 Schiissler Fiorenza understands her task as a New Testament scholar precisely to answer this challenge. As she describes it, acknowledging her 29 Schiissler Fiorenza, In Memory of Her, 347. 30 Gerda Lerner, The Creation of Patriarchy (London: Oxford University Press, 1987), 4 5.</page><page sequence="13">Joy: Equality or Divinity-A False Dichotomy? 21 debt to Joan Kelly-Gadol, the task is not only "to restore women to history and history to women, but also to reconceptualize history and culture as the product and experience of both men and women."31 Equality per se is not the issue. Nor, as her comments later in the same chapter indicate, is she concerned with retrieving an essential feminine identity. Schiissler Fiorenza's purpose is to reconstruct the social climates that have influenced the official Western Christian narrative and have been responsible for the debased images of women within the tradition. There is an extremely intri cate network of forces needing clarification here that no appeal to a divine female can automatically remedy. A reconstruction of women's history not based on the mere fact of biological sex as a timeless heuristic category, but on gender under stood in social terms with reference to patriarchal relationships of inequality within the private and public spheres, is also theoretically able to account for the variations of social status, class difference and cultural identity.32 In short, Schiissler Fiorenza's work, In Memory of Her, as a number of reviews point out,33 is not merely concerned with equality as a social issue, but with restoring women to their rightful place in the order of things. Equality is a particularly simplistic description of the problems involved. Though Schiissler Fiorenza does not dwell on the issue of the image of divinity, she dismisses the prevailing male model. "A feminist Christian spirituality ... rejects the idolatrous worship of maleness and articulates the divine image in female human existence and language."34 Schiissler Fiorenza's concern (like Irigaray's) is with women's attaining full spiritual autonomy, breaking free from domination and suppression by men. Never theless, Schiissler Fiorenza's perspective is different. For autonomy to be achieved, Schiissler Fiorenza believes, women must be given back their heritage, their history-only then can they recreate themselves. Liberation movements have pointed out that it is a sign of oppression not to have a written history and historical self-identity. History is not a collection of facts or a meaningless chronicle, but either a means of domination or the heritage of a people that looks to the past for its vision of the future. Therefore, if oppressed peoples are to have a future, freedom, and autonomy, they must recover their historical 31 Schiissler Fiorenza, In Memory of Her, 86. 32 Ibid., 86-87. 33 "Review Symposium," featuring Pheme Perkins, John Koenig, Rosemary Radford Ruether, Beverly W.

In fact, the issue is not one of the divinization of femininity, but that as women regain their sense of identity, they begin to reflect in somewhat more subtle ways on the issue of the god-image itself. Women become all too aware of the images that society has used and continues to use to control women. In this regard the image of divinity is particularly potent. It is on the topic of divinity that the concerns of reformers and revolu tionaries today are becoming increasingly similar, for what certain reformers now advocate is akin to what proponents of the Goddess have sought all along. The latter have not advocated divinization of female humanity, as Irigaray seems to be proposing, but formative and intimate symbols that affirm female ways of being. As Carol P. Christ argues in her early classic essay: The symbol of Goddess has much to offer women who are struggling to be rid of the "powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations" of devaluation of female power, denigration of the female body, mistrust of female will, and denial of women's bonds and heritage that have been engendered by patriarchal religion. As women struggle to create a new culture in which women's power, bodies, will, and bonds are celebrated, it seems natural that the Goddess would reemerge as symbol of the newfound beauty, strength, and power of women.36 As the understanding of the Goddess has matured away from literalist invocations, it has certainly not lost its revolutionary stance. Yet, today there seems more of a rapprochement between the advocates of Goddess-based religion and the reformers who have remained in mainstream traditions. Along with Schiissler Fiorenza's call to liberation and self-determination there has developed an appreciation of the need for female divine symboliza tion that is not a recapitulation of such mystical notions as Julian of Norwich's God as Mother. The reformers have been slow to voice such a claim, but it is appearing with greater frequency. 7 At this stage, it appears that, for women 35 Elisabeth Schiissler Fiorenza, Bread not Stone: The Challenge of Feminist Biblical Interpretation (Boston: Beacon Press, 1984), 146. 36 Carol P.

Yet, there is a subtle shift. Women are not necessarily claiming God in their own image, but they are realizing the necessity of expressing themselves, in moments of deepest awareness and conviction, in terms that respect women's own experience, rather than intoning masculine attributes, however benevolent. This is indeed a tricky point. One could argue, along with Mary Daly, that the time for conceiving God in any anthropomorphic form is long past. Or again, one must heed McFague's proviso that no metaphor can ever exhaust divinity. But at the present time such an articulation does seem important, and is obviously filling a need that many women, of both reform ist and revolutionary persuasions, feel deeply. And this returns us to Irigaray's critique of Schfissler Fiorenza. For is it not a false dichotomy, in light of the above developments, to pose the issue as one of equality versus divinity? For at root, it seems that one necessarily involves the other. True, some feminists will place an emphasis on a social agenda of empowerment and downplay any psychological perspective, but if the path of social justice is followed, it is inevitable that psychological questions of identity, relationship and autonomy accompany the process of social redefinition. Social roles do not exist in a psychological vacuum, any more than psychological questioning arises in the absence of social con ditioning. In my opinion Schiissler Fiorenza's works offer support and encourage ment to women in their present complex situation: women are keenly aware of injustice within religious traditions without commensurate possibilities of remedying these injustices. Her work provides invaluable sustenance in this struggle. Admittedly the nexus of forces that arise if one has opted to remain within traditional religion has different nuances than those that beset revolu tionaries. Whether Schiissler Fiorenza will be able to continue to articulate fully the role of women who have come into their own within the Catholic system is a matter of conjecture.38 In this regard, the revolutionaries, who have rejected the arduous task of reforming traditional religious roles and structures, do have a lighter burden to bear. But a burden still remains-for even if women have reached a sense of their own worth and dignity, and have conceived and honored the divine in forms that are in harmony with their beings, the problem of interaction 38 At the moment it is difficult to evaluate the situation. While the recent Pastoral letter of the North American bishops, "Partners in the Mystery of Redemption," made some conciliatory steps, it has had a mixed reception. See Center Focus 85 (July 1988) from the Center for Concern. It seems, however, that the latest obsolescent proclamations on the subject of women from Roman Headquarters, "On the Dignity of Women," provoked more mirth and amazement than the rage and sorrow of yesterday, at least among my Catholic acquaintances.</page><page sequence="16">24 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion with unjust, retrograde societal and institutional norms will always impinge, however secure one becomes in oneself. Questions of lifestyle will always be sensitive issues, given these circumstances. Ideally it seems that the battle must be waged continuously on two fronts-the social and the psychological. Neglect of one will always im poverish the gains made by the other. This is not to deny that temperamen tally there will be variations. Some women will gravitate naturally to domains of psychological research and introspection where questions of identity and creative imaginings of being and doing otherwise will sustain them. Others of a more activist bent will turn their attention to issues of social justice and reform. But both are ultimately concerned with the nature of women's empowerment, of autonomy, of liberation, whatever the genre-appropriate words may be. Rather than set one concern in opposition to the other, it would seem that the cause of feminism, particularly within a religious framework, would best be served by a frank acknowledgment by each preference of the strengths of the other. We live in a diverse and pluralistic world where divisive tactics weaken the impact of a movement that needs cohesion to be effective. It is for this reason that I would question Irigaray's reading and critique of Schiissler Fiorenza where she makes the issue one of dramatic choice. I would also hope that by discussing the controversy such a review raises, I have contributed in some measure to a productive and continuing debate on this topic.</page></plain_text>
