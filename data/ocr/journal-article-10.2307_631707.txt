<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTICES OF BOOKS decontextualised fractions of images, processed by close-up excerption from the artefacts into 'Greek Art-For the Coffee-Table'. H. longs to replace all of this with an 'authentic view': 'The alabastron means to be held and beheld-not eyed through museum glass or inspected in 'Greek Art' books. But his craving is never to be satisfied, since, as he says: 'we never can recover a sighting of the orig- inals, an original sighting of them, not just because of the accidents of survival, but because they come to us in the particular frame of our studies'. There are two points to be made here: first, it is self- contradictory that H. should regard his idiosyncratic reading of a 'handful' of Greek vases as somehow standing outside the 'frame of our studies'. In the place of two hundred years of scholarship, what is being offered is a sort of totalitarianism of viewpoint, center- ing on what H. chooses to call social context. While for him this appears to be singular, others might prefer to think in terms of a variety of contexts-all of them social-in which vases might be found, both in antiquity and during the course of their transmission to the present. These include the maker's workshop, the market-place, household, religious sanctuary, tomb, and latterly, collector's cabinet, art-dealer's window or museum exhibition. All these situations can be thought of as authentic ones. The second part of the book is more successful. Collectively the contributors offer a stimulating set of ideas about how images, real or imagined, are treated by poets and prose-writers in their respective literary genres. Zeitlin explores the 'dialogue' between theatre spectator and the network of images, real and imagined, projected by the Euripidean stage. G. emphasises the self-reflexive function of ecphrastic poetry in the Hellen- istic age, setting up a discourse between image and viewer and often presenting the self-conscious act of viewing itself as the subject rather than the image viewed. Bryson quarrels with Lehmann's treatment of Philostratus's Imagines as a description of a literal art gallery and his failure to recognise a literary topos, which is embedded in the text and is not open to archaeological reconstruction. Elsner emphasises the subjectivity of the viewer as travel writer, contrasting Herodotus's Hellenocentric confrontation of the 'other' in outlandish Egypt, with Pausanias's treatment of what Elsner calls the Greek 'self' in the Description of Greece. There is a coherence in these essays which is absent in those dealing with archaeological subjects. The idea for a book examining the relationship in antiquity between words and images is a good one which might have been tackled differently. The vast area of narrative in art and myth might have yielded some interesting comparisons, perhaps exploring the reasons why there is so rarely a fit between pictorial image and literary text. This book, however, is not primarily concerned with either image or text, but with the viewer/reader's perception of them. Those contributors who took literary viewing as their subject wisely rose to the challenge by writing about writing about writing about art in antiquity, or, as in the case of Bryson's deconstruction of Lehmann's attempt to reconstruct Philostratus's art gallery, by writing about writing about art. By choosing the tragedian, poet or travel writer for a subject, an actual viewer is located who, together with his projected audience-theatre-goer, reader of epitaphs, ancient tourist-is convincingly shown to engage in a discourse of viewing. By contrast, the archaeological essays are on much less certain ground. Lissarrague's is the most successful attempt, sensibly opting for the relatively well defined context of the symposium. Hoffmann, by contrast forces a context for the viewing of his chosen vase by making far-fetched claims for the sacred function of all Greek vases and arguing on the most tenuous of evidence that the specific ritual context for the viewing of his kantharos was the annual Athenian festival of the Anthesteria. Osborne does not even attempt to identify his viewer, while Henderson's self-conscious, and somewhat laboured 'reading' of Amazons on Greek vases seems substantially to be about his own subjective viewing. The solipsism of his approach is not declared for the one man's view it is, but instead he claims a curious privilege of exclusivity, which deteriorates into a sort of new dogma for old: 'Now that we no longer have the imperialist's need for an alibi to allow utensils to count as 'Classical Art'-with its trustees: the collector's cult of connoisseurship and genius, the museum's amassing of treasure-trove and genuineness, ??? are $$$-we may begin to contemplate vases in their own terms, this side of hyperventilation'. Hyperventilation, indeed; and what a mass of irony there is in that 'in their own terms'. The subjectivity of viewing that is the overriding theme of this book takes as its premise the assumption that vases cannot be understood or explained 'in their own terms'. If the editors were as stringent in examining their own metho- dology as they are that of others, this might have been a better book. IAN JENKINS British Museum VITELLI (K.D.) Franchthi Neolithic pottery, 1. Classi- fication and ceramic phases 1 and 2. (Excavations at Francthi cave, Greece, 8). Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1993. Pp. xxi + 500 + illus. ?50. Franchthi cave is virtually the sole source of evidence in Greece for the transition from mesolithic foraging to neolithic farming and reports that the earliest levels with domesticates were aceramic raise the possibility of piecemeal acculturation of local foragers rather than wholesale introduction of farming by immigrants. The aceramic levels at Franchthi (as elsewhere in Greece) contained a few pieces of pottery, however, in contexts where stratigraphic mixing is plausible, so the existence of an aceramic neolithic phase remains an open question. With more than 1,000,000 fragments of pottery spanning the entire Neolithic, Franchthi has much more to offer. Traditional typologies are inconsistent, with 'wares' variously distinguished by fabric or paint colour, wall thickness, firing regime, decorative motif, etc. V.'s hierarchical alternative is based on the production process: all sherds are categorised into wares, on potter's 225</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS choice of raw materials (non-plastic inclusions), and then into varieties, on surface finishing (burnishing, painting etc.). Details of building procedures, shape, firing regime or decorative motifs, detectable for only a few fragments, are then tabulated for each variety. The result is a fully quantified record of ceramic variability which reveals both long-term trends and periods of relative stability or innovation. Five ceramic phases are distinguished (FCP1-5), the present volume covering FCP1-2 (traditional Early and Middle Neolithic) and a forthcoming volume FCP3-5 (Late and Final Neolithic). V.'s relative chronology allows different excavation areas within the cave and on the open Paralia below to be correlated, and within FCP2 she distinguishes five sub-phases. Diachronic variation within FCP1 is less consistent between trenches. The core of the volume is a thorough presentation of the excavation contexts and then of the ceramic var- ieties. Stratigraphic evidence for pits, the rarity of joining fragments and the virtual absence of recognisable activity areas suggest that the neolithic deposits are heavily disturbed. As V. observes, such disturbance poses potentially serious problems for bio-archaeological analyses which, because of Franchthi publication policy, have been conducted without the benefit of the ceramic relative chronology. V.'s ultimate focus is on potters' decisions and on the social and economic context within which they are made. In the final section 'From potsherds to people', she first considers the location and scale of pottery production. Most FCP1-2 wares (and vessels) were arguably produced locally, because of their abundance or diversity at Franchthi, because of their rarity else- where, or because they include vessels too large to be transported easily. For FCP1, detailed differences of technique suggest that each ware was made by different potters, and irregular shapes suggest limited expertise. FCP2 vessels are more adventurous yet more successful- ly executed, implying more experienced potters. FCP1-2 pots were hand-made, and firing clouds attest to baking in a fire in direct contact with fuel rather than in a kiln. The incidence of firing circles from the stacking of pots during firing, however, suggests that pots were made singly in FCP1 and in batches in FCP2. This argument is further supported by 'admittedly speculative calcula- tions' of the numbers of vessels discarded per year: perhaps c. 12-13, from at least five potters, in FCP1; c. 125-150, possibly from fewer potters, in FCP2. The assumption that most pots manufactured were disposed of on-site is unjustified, but the contrast between FCP1 and FCP2 in quantity of pottery is parallelled at Knossos. Turning to function, cooking pots are first identified in late FCP2, when two wares with good thermal shock resistance were used to make distinctive round-based bowls, often discoloured by use on a fire; with estimated volumes of c. 4-6 litres, these vessels are consistent with food preparation by family households. Cooking pots only account for perhaps 5-20% of the late FCP2 assemblage. Most of the FCP2 assemblage consists of fine 'Urf' ware (roughly equivalent to traditional neo- lithic Urfirnis). Through FCP2, Urf became progressive- ly harder and more fragile and was used for increasingly elaborate and ambitious shapes. Potters risked failure during manufacture, and early breakage thereafter, to make vessels more suited to display than everyday use. V. suggests a primarily ceremonial use for Urf, including feasting (for the common bowls), the burning of aro- matic or psycho-active substances (for many pedestalled basins and saucers with traces of scraping in the base of the bowl), and the consumption of fermented beverages (for a few deep bowls and jars with internal pitting). A ceremonial function can be inferred more tentatively for FCP1 pottery. The Franchthi material is not directly comparable with that from other EN-MN sites, because of the absence of fully quantified data from the latter, but some broader consideration of V.'s stimulating conclusions would have been welcome- if only because Franchthi may have been a seasonal herding camp or periodic meeting place rather than a permanent village like the more typical 'tell' sites. This omission does not, however, undermine the excellence of this imaginative, rigorous and admirab- ly lucid study. Publication of Franchthi has been slow, but this volume was well worth waiting for.

Pp. vii + 257 + illus. PNS. During the fourth millennium BC in Cyprus there arose a highly distinctive sculptural tradition for which the island is well known, comprising representations of females in pottery and stone. Like their precursors of Upper Palaeolithic Europe, they have traditionally been interpreted as 'mother goddesses' or 'fertility figures', the latter being a particularly attractive concept in Cyprus, the mythological birthplace and chief cult centre of Aphrodite in classical times. The temptation among scholars to 'read back' from the Graeco-Roman deity to the period of her supposed origins has been seductive and compelling, and many interpretations have chosen to treat the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age figurines precisely in this way, as prototypes of Aphrodite, normally referred to as the 'Great Goddess' or 'Mother'. The vague, generic image of a 'mother goddess' embodying all aspects of 'fertility', from sexuality and fecundity to procreation, motherhood, and life in general, may be contested on theoretical grounds as being subjective, undifferentiated, ahistorical and gender biased, much in the same way that recent critical studies of the Upper Palaeolithic 'Venuses' have done. Compounding these theoretical problems has been the lack of securely dated and provenanced material from Cyprus. Most female figurines of supposed Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age date are fragmentary and have unknown provenances or uncertain find contexts. Even when provenance can be determined, precise dating is hampered by lack of securely datable examples from settlement levels and, for the Bronze Age, the discovery of figurines in tombs spanning the course of several centuries. The author of the present book aims to chart a different course in the interpretation of this material. Shunning a priori interpretations and acknowledging the 226</page></plain_text>
