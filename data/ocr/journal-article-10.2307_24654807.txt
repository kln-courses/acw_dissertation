<plain_text><page sequence="1">Heidegger's Deliberations Martin Heidegger. Besinnung. Gesamtausgabe, Third Division: Unpublished Essays, Volume 66. Edited by Friedrich-Wilhelm von Herrmann with an Afterword. Frankfurt am Main: Klostermann, 1997. 437 pages. Composed in 1938-39, Deliberation (Besinnung) is the first of four attempts by Heidegger, following the completion of his Contributions to Philosophy (1937-38), to think through the historical turn introduced by the latter work. According to the editor Friedrich-Wilhelm von Herrmann, Heidegger personally em phasized to him the closeness and importance of these deliberations to the project initiated by the Contributions. They comprise Heidegger's first look back at his attempt to have philosophers look forward, to turn from thinking of being-metaphysically as something in principle ever present or already accom plished to "thinking being-historically," as something itself emerging. The "deliberations" are divided into 28 parts and 135 sections of quite vary ing lengths and genres. In addition to a sampling of verse (not poetry, Heideg ger insists!) and free translations (Part I—the "Introduction"—opens with texts of Periander, Aeschylus, and Pindar), there are glosses on themes addressed in practically every work in the Heideggerian corpus composed between 1926 and 1939. Heidegger even has some intriguing remarks about his earl iest essays, dissertation, and habilitation, which he conceives as the first of several "steps" (along with the intensive work on Aristotle and Husserl that culminates in Being and Time) in preparation for the transition to a different way of thinking (406, 41 Iff). The work is thus Heidegger's deliberation not only on the Contributions but also on his contributions to philosophy before 1937. Most of the parts of Deliberation are quite brief (several are comprised of a single section; eighteen of them are ten pages or less). Yet Heidegger cau tions against construing the sections as aphorisms any more than as compo nents of a system or doctrine. He conceives them instead as "a series of short and long leaps of questioning into the preparedness for the appropriating event of being (Ereignis des Seyns)" (434). These "leaps" continue the project, initiated in the Contributions, of attempting to make the transition from phi losophy's first beginning (metaphysical thinking) to a new beginning (thinking being-historically). By virtue of being's very historicity, however, the outcome 254</page><page sequence="2">REVIEW ARTICLES 255 of the attempt is anything but decided. "Thinking being-historically" is the preparation for such a decision, the deliberative batdeground in which the alternatives are abandoning being or belonging to it (or, equivalently, total technological domination of human beings, the nihilistic result of metaphysi cal thinking, or the resolve to be and thus create historically). Given the pre paratory character of such thinking, in the Contributions Heidegger quite appropriately characterizes it as a "deliberation" and the subsequent work by that name is also conceived as laying the groundwork for a decision between nihilism and "the truth of being." What is entailed by "deliberation" is, among other things, "liberation from the 'freedom' of the 'subjectum'" and "the overturning of reason," whether 'reason' be understood as merely taking up (nous) what is given to it or as cal culating and reckoning (ratio) or as planning and securing (48, 160). In more positive terms, "deliberation" stands for an attunement to human beings' basic disposition (Grundbestimmung) insofar as this disposition determines them to be part of the grounding of the truth of being (Griinderschaft der Wahrheit des Seyns). Deliberation transports human beings into being-here (Da-sein), assum ing that they have been appropriated by being (vom Seyn er-eignet). Part II, "The Leap Ahead into the Singularity of Being," provides a preliminary glimpse of this appropriation, capable of "leaving behind" all thinking that remains be holden to "machination" and "metaphysics": "the culmination of modernity" and "the groundless dominance of 'to be' (Sein) determined by re-presenta tional thinking" (24f.). In Part III, entitled "Philosophy," Heidegger characterizes philosophy itself as a kind of deliberation, more precisely, a deliberation on itself and "what, as essential thinking, it has to think," not to be confused with a "reflection" after the fact in the form of a philosophy of philosophy. Heidegger identifies philosophy's deliberation with grounding the truth of being (60), i.e., bringing being (Seyn) to words through a "critical engagement with its history (as meta physics)" (49f., 57f., 74f.), yet in a way that always belongs to those to come (61, 77, 80). Philosophy does not treat "of" something, neither "of" entities as a whole nor "of" being. It is the image-less saying (Sage) "of" being itself, a saying that does not assert being, [but] rather the saying as which it [being] unfolds (west). Philosophy is such saying or it is nothing at all. All the rest remains circumstantial learnedness that has overlooked itself in its object and hence neither is "useful" in the sciences nor ever even merely touches on a deci sion in philosophy (64f.). A clear indication of the lack of deliberation is provided, Heidegger adds, by the various reigning relationships to philosophy: extensions of an earlier philo sophical position, efforts to figure out a philosophy that is more objective and comprehensive than any in the past, repudiations of philosophy as useless or</page><page sequence="3">256 REVIEW ARTICLES disheartening, indifference to philosophy, or some combination of the above (71-75). In Parts IV through VI ("Towards the Projection of Being," "Truth and Knowing," and "Being"), Heidegger turns to the struggle of giving expres sion to being and truth, on the basis of thinking being-historically. Heideg ger labors to show how thinking being-historically is not a matter of merely reversing or establishing the contrary of some metaphysical conception of "to be" (Sein). Attempts to construe the opposite of "to be," e.g., as "becoming" or "nothing" still remain within a metaphysical framework. Not even broached by metaphysical thinking, the uniqueness of being first-allows the respect ive "time-play-space of its truth" to emerge (128). "Here," in "the clearing," there is no recourse to entities (keine Zuflucht in die Seiendheit) and no place to hold up with them (kern Anhalt). Yet this clearing is not the void; inso far as we listen to it, we are already appropriated by the "refusal" that un folds in it, a refusal that presents us with our questionableness and the gods with the neediness of being (129). "The 'to be' as the beingness of entities" (Das Sein als Seiendheit des Seienden) is something that human beings find by way of representing, producing, and taking advantage of entities (albeit only to for get, take for granted, and be indifferent to it). By contrast, "the 'to be' as being—as the abyss of all entities" (Das Sein als Seyn aber—als Abgrund allem Seienden) is something that human beings never find. It only comes into the open, as Heidegger puts it, insofar as it appropriates human beings to itself in the refusal mentioned above. Being as this appropriating event directs us back to our role in grounding its truth and to our essential powerless ness, alien to all otherwise "effective" entities. In the process, it safeguards the uniqueness of the clearing and "clears for the gods the time-space of a near ness and distance" (130). The term verweigem is typically used in connection with obedience and po litical obligation as in, for example, refusing to obey or refusing to serve in the military. These uses and the role that Heidegger assigns to "refusal" in this work in 1939 deserve special scrutiny, especially in light of his empha sis that thinking being-historically requires human transformation. Bounty hunters will not be pleased by the many criticisms of National Socialist themes in the Deliberation, e.g., remarks about the ineptness of the notions of 'coun try' and 'blood' (167; see, too, 145, 160, and the reference to Chamberlain on 402). It is also possible, of course, to see in such criticisms further evi dence of Heidegger's bad faith. In any case, the final section of Part V, sec tion 47, "Truth and Use," deserves particular attention in this regard. Heidegger begins the section with a quotation from Hitler, declaring that there is no behavior that could not find its ultimate justification in its use for the collec tive whole (Gesamtheit). For the next page and a half, Heidegger does not write a single declarative sentence but instead poses a litany of critical questions,</page><page sequence="4">REVIEW ARTICLES 257 all disparaging Hitler's statement and making clear, in no uncertain terms, that the views expressed in that statement represent "the final renunciation" of everything that Heidegger is trying to accomplish (122f.). At various junctures throughout the book, Heidegger continues the work, begun in the Contributions, of correcting various anthropological or subjectivis tic misconstruals of the meaning of Da-sein and, thereby, of his early work, Bring and Ήπιε (see, for example, 146). This effort is particularly evident in Parts VII through IX where Heidegger addresses the relation of being to human beings and "anthropomorphism" buttressed as the latter notion is by metaphysics. By "anthropomorphism" Heidegger has in mind not simply a wholesale, power-obsessed humanizing of things (or, what amounts to the same, a divinizing of the world), as pretentious as it is dangerous (154). More important in his analysis is the role anthropomorphism assumes as "the flight from any demand of decisive questioning" (159). Following this treatment of human beings, Heidegger turns to "History" (iGeschichte), the tide of Part X. In this brief part, containing a single section by the same name, Heidegger manages in four pages to address the distinc tion between historicity (Geschichtlichkrit) and the cultural technology, culmi nating in historicism, of giving a historical accounting {Historié) of the past with a view to determining the essence of humanity definitively in the present. These themes also take center stage in Parts XI and XII, which are devoted to "Technology" and "Historical Accounting and Technology" respectively, as Heidegger emphasizes the role of deliberation in liberating history and over turning any such historical accounting. Being is the subject of Parts XIII through XVII, all of which have the term in the tide: "Being and Power," "Being and to Be \Sevri\," "The Thinking of Being," "The Forgottenness of Being," and "The History of Being." Being, Heidegger tells us, is powerless, but beyond (i.e., unrelated to) power and impotence. "To be," predicated of a subject that stands for an entity, is the categorialization of being (199). The staple of metaphysical thinking, this categorialization is the reason why it can never think being and, indeed, why we are so unfazed by this incapacity and generally oblivious to being (211, 218). Given this development, Heidegger flirts with the idea of construing the history of being as "tragic," though he quickly drops the idea (223f.). The theme of "divinity," despite its avowed centrality to "thinking being historically," is treated with alarming brevity in the Contributions. Frustrated students can turn to Deliberation, Part XVIII, "Gods," where the thematic treat ment is three times as long. In Parts XIX through XXV Heidegger returns to several themes at the intersection of metaphysics and thinking being historically: the craziness {lire) of the essence of the truth of being, Schelling as the philosopher with the profoundest grasp of the spirit in the history of German metaphysics, the joindy metaphysical and transitional question of why</page><page sequence="5">258 REVIEW ARTICLES there is something rather than nothing, the completion of Western metaphy sics in Hegel's and Nietzsche's treatments of being, becoming, and negativity, and, finally, to be (Sein) and thinking. Revisiting Being and Time in this con nection, Heidegger attempts to show its continuity with thinking being historically, though he also offers qualified criticism of the early work by remarking that in it he spoke and presented things metaphysically "and yet thought otherwise" (32If.). Aptly bearing the rich titles "A Collection of Deliberating" and "Thinking being-historically and the question of 'to be'," Parts XXVI and XXVII contain Heidegger's attempts to elaborate what it might mean to think the "appropriating event" of being, truth as "the clearing belonging to being as the appropriating event" (314), and "the timeli ness of the here" (fatlichkeit des Da) as the clearing (326). While the Contribu tions make clear how metaphysical thinking in general must be construed from the standpoint of "thinking being-historically," Part XXVIII of Delibera tion details the specific relation of metaphysics to ontology, θεωρία, φύσις, "worldviews," and mysticism. He also continues to sketch the particular roles played in the history of metaphysics by Plato and Aristotle, Leibniz and Kant, among others. Another gem in this work, begging for translation, is the Appendix, "A Look Back at the Way," composed in 1937-38, presenting Heidegger's two-part retrospective on the course of his thinking to that point. In the first part ("My way up to the present"), he gives a revealing and at times highly per sonal review of his journey from the dissertation to the Contributions to Philo sophy. He explains the unfinished character of Bring and Time, for example, by noting that "in the initial draft, the actual, 'systematic' section on 'Time and Being' remained insufficient and external circumstances (the growing size of the Jahrbuch volume) fortunately prevented its publication" (413). Having destroyed it, he began anew, as he puts it, "on a more historical path" with the lectures of the summer semester of 1927 (Fundamental Problems of Phenomeno logy). He adds with a note of regret that, in retrospect, the publication of that section would have prevented the misunderstanding of Bring and Time as a mere "ontology of human beings" from getting as far as it did. But then Heidegger quickly dismisses such second-guessing with the observation that the difficulties in thinking being are far more fundamental than any asso ciated with a particular attempt to do so. In this way he explains his new fine of inquiry, which begins with "On the Essence of the Ground," and read dresses the entire history of Western philosophy (from his 1932 lectures on Anaximander and Parmenides to his 1937 lectures on Nietzsche). Signaling the theme of the entire work, Heidegger speaks of how, "in the unity of this historical and fundamental deliberation on the basic question, the transitional position of the entire [line of] questioning first became clear" (415). After noting the difficulty of demonstrating that actual historical need,</page><page sequence="6">REVIEW ARTICLES 259 and not some contingent, recondite erudition made such questioning neces sary, Heidegger adds a comment that reveals a struggle at once personal, philosophical, and religious: And who would fail to see that the critical engagement with Christianity silendy accompanied me on this entire previous way—a critical engage ment that was and is no "problem" that happened to be taken up, but rather a preservation of the origin that is most my own—the house of my parents, my homeland, my youth—and a painful detachment from them, a preservation and detachment in one. Only someone who was so rooted in a Catholic world that was actually lived, may have an inkling of the necessities that worked like subterranean jolts on the previous path of my questioning. It is inappropriate [awkward: unschicklich] to speak of these innermost crit ical engagements that do not turn on questions of dogma and articles of faith, but only on the one question whether God is in flight from us or not and whether we ourselves still truly and, that is to say, as creators, ex perience this. (415) In the retrospective's second part ("On preserving what has been attempted"), Heidegger surveys his unpublished writings, dividing them into seven cate gories, each of which he then elaborates: lectures, addresses, outlines or dia grams for exercises, preliminary studies for a work (including self-criticism of Being and Time), reflections and hints in notebooks, studies of Hôlderlin, and the Contributions. Particularly valuable in this survey are Heidegger's assess ments of the progress that he makes in these various writings towards the themes of the Contributions. At one point, for example, he states that from the spring of 1932 he had planned, at least in its basic features, what first took shape as the Contributions (424). Accordingly, the lectures in the intervening years, including Introduction to Metaphysics, are to be understood as "running starts" (Anlaufe) towards that culminating work. He touts, too, the importance of the lectures of 1930-31 on Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit for "the unfold ing of the question," but attributes the "insufficiency" of the 1933 lectures to the demands of being rector (422). Both parts of this retrospective, midway in his career and shortly before his fiftieth birthday, suggest that Heideg ger is struggling with the question of his "Nachlafl." The worst thing that could befall these efforts is, as he puts it, a "psychologically-biographical divi sion and explanation" of them, thus the very opposite of what could alone make them worthy of consideration, namely, to indicate a way of asking the only question.
