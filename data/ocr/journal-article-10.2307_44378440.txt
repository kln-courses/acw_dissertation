<plain_text><page sequence="1">1 Elizabeth E. Knauer Of Dogs, Daughters, and the "Back Bedroom" School: Woolf's Flush (1933) and Women's Education Scholars are beginning to acknowledge that what Virginia Woolf termed "that silly book Flush"- certainly her most critically under- valued work- should not be written off so readily (Diary 4:153). Until recently, the consensus was that, as Woolf herself had dismissed Flush (1933) in her diaries and letters as "slight and too serious," a "waste" (Diary 4: 133-4), and a "foolish witless joke" (Letters 5:169), literary history was jus- tified in doing the same. Consequently, most of the scholarly attention paid to Flush has concentrated merely on establishing a place for it- on address- ing questions of its status as biography or as fiction, its canonicity, or its (ir)relevance to other works by Woolf from the 1930s, such as The Waves and The Years.1 But I would like to suggest that this "silly" mock-biography of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's cocker spaniel also offers readers insight into one of Woolf' s chief political concerns throughout her career: the subject of women's education. Chronologically situated between the feminist treatise A Room of One's Own (1929) and the pacifist polemic Three Guineas (1938), Flush contributes to Woolf's ideas on women's education by functioning as a transitional work. In it, Woolf follows her canine protagonist through a number of loca- tions, including the patriarchal Victorian home, the hierarchical social worlds of London in general and Regent's Park in particular, and freedom- loving Italy, where Flush mingles with dogs of all ranks and pursues his own course of uninhibited study. In Flush , Woolf explores the possibilities for learning in all these sites, while criticizing the restrictive practices of nineteenth-century women's education, challenging the twentieth-century British university system, and, more generally, examining the intricacies and ramifications of gendered knowledge. Throughout, Woolf uses the character of Flush as a vehicle to determine which type of instruction, if any, is most productive, especially for women. And she appears to reach a con- clusion, one that she will articulate more decisively five years after the pub- lication of Flush, in the more activist-oriented Three Guineas. Much has been made of the difference(s) between A Room and its "sequel" Three Guineas, especially regarding Woolf's evolving feminism. Michele Barrett, for instance, writes that while the former "takes up a posi- tion that aspires to gender neutrality," Three Guineas is marked by "a much more 'difference' -oriented stance," asserting that women must act as women, but with men to make progress (xxii). In A Room of One's Own, The CEA Cr√¨tic 73.2 (Winter 2011)</page><page sequence="2">2 Knauer Woolf had insisted that the best woman writer, like the fictional Mary Carmichael, has "mastered the first great lesson; she wr[ites] as a woman, but as a woman who has forgotten that she is a woman" (A Room 84). In Three Guineas , Woolf places less emphasis on androgyny. Barrett summa- rizes the feminist debate and the shift that she sees in Woolf' s thinking: Feminists are, of course, divided as to whether, or in what circumstances, one might support gender neutrality, or the so-called 'equality' position, versus an awareness of the distinctive situation or attributes of women and the need to build progress on the recognition of 'difference' between women and men. It must be said that here, in the manifesto that [A Room] . . . has become, Woolf's model of androgyny is the nearest she came to the 'equality' position and it is no doubt because she pitched art at the level of general truth- more abstract than sexual difference. Elsewhere in her work, as we . . . see clearly in relation to . . . [Three Guineas ], her position was quite different, (xxiii) While Barrett's distinction between the feminism of androgyny in A Room and the feminism of difference in Three Guineas is, by her own admission, perhaps too simplistic to account adequately for Woolf's nuanced positions, these divisions do help to establish a continuum along which we can track changes in Woolf's thinking about education. For my purposes, they are helpful when looking at the more serious functions of the "dog story" that, as Pamela Caughie notes, has for a long time been inaccurately classified as a valueless "waste of time" (47). 2 On the spectrum of Woolf's attitudes toward women's education, Flush stands midway between her earlier feminism of equality and her later fem- inism of difference. The fate of Flush, an androgynous, non-human charac- ter reared in the feminine atmosphere of the Victorian bedroom, both proves the argument in favor of better education through independence, financial and otherwise, found in A Room and suggests that something more is necessary to complete that education. Indeed, Flush is unfulfilled until he is in contact with a variety of dogs and humans who are all fighting for the same cause, a cause that Elizabeth Barrett Browning sums up at the end of the narrative as being "educat[ed] into gladness" (Flush 123). As a non- threatening, furry, domestic, yet also identifiably male animal, Flush embodies the best of the solidarity-inspired, androgynous feminism of A Room and gestures toward the more collaborative, feminism-of-difference ideal of Three Guineas. In A Room , Woolf considers the subject of "Women and Fiction" and makes the case that, if women are to succeed as creative writers, they must have their own economic autonomy and ownership of a space in which to work. For art to flourish, money is essential, and along with it, experience,</page><page sequence="3">Critic 73.2 3 motivation, and education. Initially delivered as a lecture to the students of Girton College, Cambridge, Woolf' s argument encourages women to com- bat their historical exclusion by recovering the lost tradition of Shakespeare's sister and by forging ahead, armed with money and with their own places for writing, to make a new tradition. While she advocates feminism in A Room , she is not interested in a "pitting of sex against sex, of quality against quality," for "all this claiming of superiority and imputing of inferiority, belong to the private-school stage of human existence where there are 'sides'" (A Room 95). Here, Woolf is not concerned with winning a battle against men but with gaining what she calls "intellectual freedom," which "depends upon material things," things that women have not had since "the beginning of time" (A Room 97). Yet, despite Woolf's assurances to the contrary, A Room of One's Own is, at times, surprisingly exclusive, and it does take sides in terms of gender. Woolf addresses only women- mid- dle-class, "educated" women, moreover, enrolled in institutions of higher education- and, paradoxically, pushes them to advance a specifically woman-centered agenda by writing not as women but as writers who hap- pen to be women. As in the case of A Room , the text of Three Guineas began as a talk- one that Woolf gave in January 1931 to the Junior Council of the London branch of the National Society for Women's Service. According to Naomi Black, as well as Woolf's own diaries and letters, the idea for an anti-war essay had been in Woolf's mind for years. Black writes in Virginia Woolf as Feminist (2004): "by 1932, then, we can say in respect to the future Three Guineas only that Woolf was planning a sequel to A Room of One's Own , not a novel, to be documented from a range of older as well as contemporary reading, and to include pictures. She was also quite clear that the result would be feminist and would offend men" (60). In her diary, Woolf described what would become Three Guineas as having a "didactive demonstrative style" and as something she was eager to write, because it was "sucking at [her] brain" (Diary 4:6-7). She had a point to prove. Black emphasizes the fact that Woolf "used a massive number of sources for the book. Almost a hundred books and half as many periodical items are cited or referred to in Three Guineas" (160). By heaping up evidence, Woolf hoped to make a statement about war, fascism, and also patriarchy, as well as about women's and men's responsi- bility to prevent the spread of all three. Although some have seen Three Guineas as more militant and more exacting than A Room in its feminist pronouncements, its form, rhetoric, and "answers" for preventing war and ensuring better education for women ask us to reconsider this notion. A February 1932 diary entry reveals that, while formulating the ideas for this text, Woolf struggled to contain her enthusi- asm and thought it prudent to temper her feminist intent: "whats it to be called? - "Men are like that?" - no thats too patently feminist: the sequel then, for which I have collected enough powder to blow up St. Pauls" ( Diary</page><page sequence="4">4 Knauer 4:77). Despite this fiery excitement, Woolf seems more willing in Three Guineas than in A Room to work with the existing masculine system of edu- cation and not to discount it completely- more willing to make feminist inroads where there exist roads initially paved by men. Upon receiving a letter from a male barrister, the female narrator of Three Guineas is com- pelled to "make the attempt" to answer the question the writer poses, "since when before has an educated man asked a woman how in her opinion war can be prevented?" (117). She recognizes that she must make her voice heard where it is usually forbidden, and she seizes an opportunity to invite men into her own feminist discussion. This is a significant change, for in A Room , men are merely the absent "they"; in Three Guineas, the narrator addresses them directly as "you." Woolf' s goal, as she states in the latter work, is progress, and progress can only be achieved through collaboration between the sexes. The narrator, representative of women, confidently claims to the barrister that there is an "effective way in which we can help you" (158). That way is through better education for women. Woolf is keen to emphasize that working together does not require the erasure of difference. Her narrative persona in Three Guineas - speaking as a woman and for women, but writing to a man- concludes that "it seems both wrong for us rationally and impossible for us emotionally to fill up your form and join your society. For by so doing we should merge our iden- tity in yours; follow and repeat and score still deeper the old worn ruts. . ." (Three Guineas 231). It is far better that the "daughters of educated men might found and join outside your society but in co-operation with its ends" their own "Outsiders' Society" to keep men on the straight and narrow anti- war path (231). Each woman has a responsibility to counter whatever men may say to justify war, "not by forced fraternity, but by human sympathy" (233), because there are some duties "which are specifically appropriate to the daughters of educated men" (235). Here, Woolf urges collaboration, but without sacrificing female identity; she upholds the idea of a feminism of difference, while believing that cooperation can bring about an end to patri- archy, domination, fascism, and war. Something altered in Woolf's thinking during the nine years that elapsed between the publication of A Room and of Three Guineas . Flush, which appeared between these two works, bears witness to, and helps to explain, the change. The dog biography that seems to have little to do with either of Woolf's more serious works on female education anticipates this shift in its play with audience and style, form, and genre. In her essay "Of Fanciers, Footnotes, and Fascism: Virginia Woolf's Flush/' Anna Snaith locates Flush on a continuum of Woolf's anti-fascist efforts during the Thirties. Asserting that " Flush becomes not only a political text in its own right, but one that needs to be placed alongside Woolf's other texts of the decade, particularly Three Guineas " (emphasis in original), Snaith offers a method of contextualization and comparison that we can extend to the issue</page><page sequence="5">Critic 73.2 5 of education (615). In Flush, Woolf presents, through the story of a dog's development, the outlines of a solid British education for middle-class men. The non-human protagonist achieves what neither the nineteenth-century women writers discussed in A Room nor the twentieth-century "daughters of educated men" in Three Guineas were allowed - a well-rounded and sat- isfactory education, leading to a sense of utility and self-fulfillment. Most notably, Flush's education is filled with upward progress. Although he is initially bound by the same gender-and-class-based limitations imposed upon his mistress, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, he later is able to transcend these in ways that she cannot. A Room attests to the restricted and largely domestic education "allowed" even women of privilege in the nineteenth century who, accord- ing to Woolf, suffered from Victorian patriarchy's hunger for power and dominance. As Woolf says, men have needed validation, so they oppress women: "Men insist that women are inferior because it bolsters their own sense of superiority"; women are a reference point to men, which "serves to explain in part the necessity that women so often are to men" (A Room 32). Born and reared in the late Victorian period, Woolf experienced firsthand the consequences of masculine domination in the domestic and public spheres. She remarks in A Room that even "the most transient visitor to this planet," upon reading the newspaper, "could not fail to be aware, even from this scattered testimony, that England is under the rule of a patri- archy" (30). In Flush , the patriarch is visible in the domineering persona of Mr. Barrett, the Victorian father who not only requires his "invalid" daugh- ter to languish at home, but who otherwise shows up in the text as an over- bearing, intimidating man. Flush feels "shivers of terror and horror" when- ever Mr. Barrett's "dark body" approaches, and he notes that his mistress also displays a change in behavior when her father is near (Flush 51). Indeed, she must pretend in order to satisfy her father's demands: "Had the meal been eaten? Had his commands been obeyed?" (Flush 51). Considering this oppressive atmosphere, biographer Julia Markus calls it a "miracle" that "locked as she was into the drama of her own family, into illness, mor- phine, and dreams," Elizabeth Barrett experienced any sort of pleasure in life (5). She is accustomed to assuming a submissive persona at odds with her reality, in order to appease her father. Flush is eyewitness to the gendered tyranny in the Barrett household, and he is unsettled by it. The dog, who offers a new perspective on the inequity of the Victorian back bedroom, forces readers to see it afresh. Mr. Barrett's behavior may have been routine in nineteenth-century society, but Woolf suggests through Flush that such unjust conduct, regardless of its typicality, should not be any less startling. The "typical," Flush indicates, is not quite right, a sentiment that comes through in Woolf's other texts. In Orlando (1928), for example, Woolf had commented scathingly upon the "educated Victorian class" by drawing attention to its largely mis-educated</page><page sequence="6">6 Knauer women. Orlando, Woolf s time-traveling and gender-bending hero(ine), who is temporarily caught up in the oppressive, marriage-minded atmos- phere of the mid-nineteenth century, is "positively ashamed of the second finger of her left hand," which bears no wedding ring (165). In the midst of such expectation, where there seem to be no other options for women, even the free-spirited poet Orlando feels compelled "to yield completely and submissively to the spirit of the age, and take a husband" (167). 3 The story of Woolf' s regrets over her own lost educational opportuni- ties is well known. While there is no record of Woolf having "pester[ed]" her father, Leslie Stephen, to send her to Cambridge, we know from her diaries and letters that she sometimes thought longingly of it. The Stephen brothers went away to school; the sisters stayed at home. Hermione Lee's 1996 biography of Woolf depicts a rather envious young Virginia who, though eager to hear of her brothers' experiences at school, felt her exclu- sion keenly. While the men of the family went off to college or to work, "the daughters' days were split in half. There was the life that was thrust upon them of female duties and the life they wanted to make for themselves, of independent habits and passionate absorption in books and art," as they pursued learning without the assistance of university tutors (141). Susan Squier refers to Woolf's "very feminine education at 22 Hyde Park Gate" (27), where "the distinction between 'male' intellectual and 'female' social/ emotional education" was maintained (26). Lee notes that Woolf, determined to make the best of her situation, "took refuge in her secret life in the 'daytime' half of her room, where she studied Greek, and read and wrote, standing up at her high desk" (Lee 142). Still, she yearned to be part of the scholarly circle of her brothers, and her "most eloquent memory of [her brother Thoby] is of his coming home from his prep school for the first time and walking up and down the stairs with her, telling her shyly and excitedly about Greek literature. Later he would tell her vivid narratives of his schoolfriends, later still of the brilliant men he was meeting at college" (Lee 117). These were all arenas closed to the young Virginia, who taught herself Greek and composed her own "vivid narratives" with her pen. Woolf's earlier biographer, her nephew Quentin Bell, has provided a less gloomy account of the young Virginia's educational opportunities, emphasizing Leslie Stephen's readiness to give his daughter Virginia free rein in his library, although "he managed shyly to convey" that there were "certain books" not "entirely suitable for young ladies" (Bell 51). Bell, more- over, has praised his great-uncle as an unofficial schoolmaster in the home, who might have been "a disastrous teacher of mathematics," but who "made up for it as a teacher of English literature" (51). Indeed, Bell's biog- raphy paints a picture of Woolf as a willing recluse, happy to pursue her own studies without the interruption or direction of an "outsider." A "rather tall, rather thin overgrown girl reading or writing in a back room at Hyde Park Gate," Woolf was, according to Bell, opposed to any other sort</page><page sequence="7">Critic 73.2 7 of education, reluctant "to leave the sober, but to her important, comforts of her work place" (Bell 51). Virginia's own letters, however, indicate that she was not a contented occupant of what, in Flush, she would call the Victorian "back bedroom," but instead someone who longed for better instruction and more regular conversation with intellectual peers. Writing to her broth- er Thoby, she gave way to envy: "I have to delve from books, painfully and all alone, what you get every evening sitting over your fire and smoking your pipe with Strachey etc. No wonder my knowledge is but scant. Theres nothing like talk as an educator I'm sure" (Letters 3:241). Rebecca Nagel con- curs in suggesting that Woolf "always regretted that she did not receive the formal university education" her male friends and relations did (65). And in Three Guineas, Woolf draws attention to that regret when, with evident sarcasm, she dares to suggest that, like their brothers, women "actually desired to be educated themselves" (146). During the 1920s and 1930s, as Woolf was writing first A Room, then Flush, and finally Three Guineas, middle-class British women were granted and did enjoy greater opportunities to pursue the education that they might "actually" desire. The women's colleges Girton and Newnham were estab- lished at Cambridge over fifty years earlier, in 1869 and 1872, respectively, and Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall were founded at Oxford in 1879. By the Twenties, women at both Oxbridge institutions could attend lectures, live on campus, and act as tutors to other women. In No Distinction of Sex? Women in British Universities, 1870-1939 (1995), Carol Dyhouse reports that twentieth-century women responded eagerly to these changes by enrolling in increasing numbers. Although, at the turn of the century, the sight of "women students graduating was still unusual enough to provoke public interest and merriment," by the late Thirties, "nearly one quarter of the total" number of British University students were women, and these women were thought to be ushering in "revolutionary changes" (17). The First World War played a part in this revolution, by removing men from the home front and leaving educational and professional gaps for women to fill: "During the 1914-1918 war, the government's attitude had been to empha- size the need for a continuing supply of teachers and trained professional workers. Women undergraduates were persuaded to stick to their studies, as part of the national war effort. There were important gains while the men were away" (Dyhouse 241). But a gain in numbers alone was not sufficient for Virginia Woolf who, in 1928, censured the girls at Girton College for being "disgracefully igno- rant" and docile, merely accepting what they were given and ceasing to push for more (A Room 101). Woolf believed that there were greater things to be achieved by and for women. Indeed, although both Oxford and Cambridge allowed women to sit for university examinations in the 1880s, they did not post female students' passing grades alongside men's, consid- er women students part of these universities, or grant them full university</page><page sequence="8">8 Knauer degrees. It was not until 1920 that Oxford began conferring full degrees upon women and recognizing them as members, and Cambridge resisted until 1948. In Three Guineas , Woolf laments these inequities and worries that, despite the successes that marked the first years of the twentieth cen- tury, women were not advancing beyond them. After World War I, pre-war challenges for middle-class women pursu- ing higher education and/ or careers in the professions revived. According to Carol Dyhouse, "Any notions of steady assimilation or easy integration tend[ed] to disappear," for male soldiers, returning from the battlefield, resented the rapidly increasing numbers of women students and graduates, whom they viewed as threats (240). Contending that "sexual divisions were reasserted after 1918" (240), Dyhouse notes that "an undercurrent of misog- yny lingered on, and occasionally surfaced in more sustained and seriously argued attacks, such as the much publicized and controversial contention in the 1930s that higher education was wasted on women, who would marry and fail to make use of their degrees" (242). The Victorian influence persist- ed. As Felicity Hunt emphasizes in Gender &amp; Polio/ in English Education : Schooling for Girls 1902-1944 , "twentieth-century femininity is informed and shaped by nineteenth-century values in a way which was not true, say, for the relationship between eighteenth- and nineteenth-century gender con- structs" (22). In particular, the twentieth century perpetuated the previous century's anxieties over questions of domesticity: would formal education unfit women for the home? Would it make them undesirable as wives and mothers? Anger at this persistent Victorian "expectation" that women were first and foremost meant for domestic lives pervades Woolf' s Three Guineas. In that text, Woolf expressed her fear that women might lose the gains they had made; she feared that, given the late-1930s climate of fascism abroad and militarism in Britain, middle-class women would once again cave to the demands of patriarchy. To surrender any advances, to regress, when so much was at stake, was unthinkable: Woolf would "make the attempt" to further encourage women's progress and activism, "even if it [was] doomed to failure" (Three Guineas 117). Perhaps it was a desire to prove women's worth and equality that caused the women's colleges, in the early twentieth century, to conform to traditions of masculine English higher education. In attempting to "prove," however, that women undergraduates were as capable as men, they lost something crucial; Woolf noted that women became so committed to estab- lishing their places in the hierarchical educational system that they risked enslavement by the very thing that they had hoped would free them. One graduate, for instance, affirmed Woolf's suspicions that women's colleges were forfeiting their individuality and abandoning their initial revolution- ary mission through their "slavish imitation of men's education" ("To the Editor"). In a 24 March, 1928 letter to the Times of London, Isabel Wood insisted that if women's education were "to be worthy of its foundations,</page><page sequence="9">Critic 73.2 9 we must again break away from tradition and build something that is our own, not a poor copy of past generations." Wood was particularly con- cerned that devotion to the curriculum deprived women of the more pow- erful teacher of experience: The women's colleges of today with their entrance exami- nations are putting a premium on cramming girls into schools with text-book knowledge, and effectually prevent- ing them from having time even to see, much less to think about, those great problems of women's lives which are so vital to the well-being of the whole community and which surround them on every side. ("To the Editor") There was, of course, a backlash against Wood's apparent disdain for the guiding principles of women's higher education, and the Times printed sev- eral letters of outraged response. But Wood's letter did raise a concern that later found its way into Woolf's Three Guineas : namely, that women should not be satisfied with the traditional masculine education, but should instead reform it, reshape it, use it to address all realms of life, and turn to direct experience. How could women best accomplish this? In 1933, Virginia Woolf gave a partial answer by picturing a dog's education, introducing as both pupil and teacher a little red spaniel who, despite possessing "only" a dog's brain, outshines his Victorian human acquaintances. As Woolf's biographer Herbert Marder writes, Flush effectively "dissolve[s] the spell of those pow- erful ancestral figures," the Barretts and Brownings, felt by the author her- self (82). In large part, the dog's schooling is a success, for he learns what it is to love both emotionally and sexually, and he gains intellectual and spir- itual understanding. Flush's education is intentional, requires his effort and awareness, and produces longterm effects; moreover, it involves careful instruction. Like Elizabeth Barrett, Flush finds his classroom in the Victorian domestic interior, where he grapples with issues of language, mis- interpretation, and cognition. He endeavors, for instance, to make sense of his mistress's writing, skeptically studying her "straight stick," which is "for ever crossing a white page" (Flush 46). He also struggles, when he first comes to the Barrett house, to acclimate himself to the oppressive surround- ings of the Victorian "back bedroom": Only a scholar who has descended step by step into a mau- soleum and there finds himself in a crypt, crusted with fun- gus, slimy with mould, exuding sour smells of decay and antiquity, while half-obliterated marble busts gleam in mid-air and all is dimly seen by the light of the small swinging lamp with which he holds, and dips and turns, glancing now here, now there - only the sensations of such an explorer into the buried vaults of a ruined city can com-</page><page sequence="10">10 Knauer pare with the riot of emotions that flooded Flush's nerves as he stood for the first time in an invalid's bedroom, in Wimpole Street, and smelt eau de cologne" (Flush 27-8). Used to a life of liberty in the country, where he had enjoyed "gambols" and had rim "hither and thither" through endless fields (20), the sensitive and newly-confined Flush must approach his environment "very slowly, very dimly, with much sniffing and pawing" (28). It is so unnatural to him, so fabricated and foreign, that he advances with trepidation; he must labor consciously to accustom himself to what he instinctively finds oppressive. Finding "door after door" of the Barrett house "shut on freedom," Flush comes to understand what it means to be both closed in and forced to behave unnaturally: "To suppress the most violent instincts of his nature- that was the prime lesson of the bedroom school, and it was one of such portentous difficulty that many scholars have learnt Greek with less" (43). Of course, this severely limited, even stifling, scholastic environment had long been considered normal for a Victorian gentlewoman, such as Elizabeth Barrett. Thus, in the "back bedroom school," Flush experiences solidarity with his mistress - and with most middle-class women of Virginia Woolf's generation. In her biography of Woolf, Julia Briggs notes that after Leslie Stephen's death, Woolf recalled her early home as a restric- tive and unpleasant place, ruled by "a domestic tyrant, a flea-bitten old lion, penned up with his children in the cage of Hyde Park Gate," an atmosphere that sounds very like the Barrett home in which Flush is forcibly impris- oned (361). While Jacqui Griffiths accurately emphasizes Flush's "identifi- cation with the human values embodied by Elizabeth Barrett," this identifi- cation links him broadly with all such "educated" nineteenth-century "daughters" (168). Yet Flush's situation does not prove as hopeless as it seems at first; like many actual "daughters," the anthropomorphized Flush achieves a measure of educational success despite his oppressive surround- ings. Flush and Elizabeth Barrett occupy a room, but it is not a room of their own , for it belongs to the Victorian father, "the most formidable of elderly men- Mr. Barrett himself" (Flush 51). In Flush , Elizabeth Barrett may appear to enjoy a life of privilege, but every privilege has been "allotted" to her by someone else. A real room of one's own, as Anna Snaith writes in Virginia Woolf: Public and Private Negotiations (2000), is "'silent, private', becomes liberating, a place from which women can speak without restric- tion, and from which the variety of women's experience can be spoken" (161-62). For a writer, moreover, the "dictated" back bedroom in Wimpole Street room is not enough; outside experience must inform her art. Breadth of experience was what Victorian ladies - including Elizabeth Barrett, until the time of eloping and living abroad - so painfully lacked. The "back bedroom," while marked by constraint and submission, is nevertheless the site of the most "scholastic" and intellectual aspects of</page><page sequence="11">C≈Ñtic 73.2 11 Flush's education (Flush 35). In it, he learns of music and of language, rec- ognizes the strength of his own reasoning, and determines to gain from instruction. As a "high-spirited, yet reflective" pupil, he "look[s] and lis- ten[s]," and he "ponder[s]" the questions his mistress sets before him: does he think a harp, which produces live music, is itself alive? Is his reflection in a mirror reality? Is he real? (55-56). From his infrequent and well-moni- tored trips outside of the bedroom and into London's streets, he acquires a "nucleus of knowledge" that supplements his bedroom study (39). Many of these outside lessons are cultural ones and, reflective of London's social order, are somewhat ridiculous, for they are discriminatory and class- based. He learns that in Regent's Park "dogs must be led on chains," and that in London in general, dogs "differ; some are high, others low" (39). While Woolf underscores the outlandish nature of these "discoveries" by attributing them to a dog, she does not condemn Flush for thinking they must be true. Patriarchal and hierarchical Victorian society has encouraged him to make such foolish distinctions, and the narrative here leaves open the prospect of his re-education- of his examining them thoughtfully and fairly and then re-evaluating his relationship to others. This, of course, was precisely what Woolf had urged middle-class "daughters" to do, closing her own speech to the women of Girton College by "saying briefly and pro- saically that it is much more important to be oneself than anything else" (A Room 100). Flush begins to sort through difficulties as he is exposed to alternative realities. In "Whitechapel," probably the chapter with the best-known inci- dent of Flush , the pampered Flush is abducted by a gang of dog-nappers and held prisoner in one of London's worst slums, until Elizabeth Barrett pays ransom. The Whitechapel episode has been studied as an example of class disparity, of urban environments in Victorian England, of relational struggle, and of the increasing autonomy of women, especially of Elizabeth Barrett, who determines to retrieve Flush in defiance of the dictates of the men in her life- father and fiance alike.4 For Flush, the Whitechapel prison is also a place of learning, a vastly different schoolroom from the back bed- room to which he had been accustomed. Described by the narrator as "the most terrible experience of [Flush's] life," in which "he was bewildered in the extreme" (Flush 90), Whitechapel forces Flush to consider the wider world, to make room for other ways of life than his own, and to wonder at the privileged Victorians' insistence upon maintaining standards of "jus- tice" and "morality," which looks to Flush like an excuse for lazy inaction. For days, "Mr. Browning storm[s] and vociferate[s]" and writes scathing letters to the head dog-snatcher, Mr. Taylor, but no one comes to free Flush from his prison (100). During that time, Flush begins to question the reality of the Wimpole Street life and the usefulness of his former education: "All Flush's past life and its many scenes- Reading, the greenhouse, Miss Mitford, Mr. Kenyon, the bookcases, the busts, the peasants on the blind - had faded like snowflakes dissolved in a cauldron" (Flush 105).</page><page sequence="12">12 Knauer Whitechapel is frightening, dark, filthy, damp, and full of "thieves" and "murderers," but it is also a political revelation for the previously na√Øve Flush who, upon returning at last to the Barrett house, is able to place the back bedroom in the context of the wider world. For him, "the old gods of the bedroom- the bookcase, the wardrobe, the busts - seemed to have lost their substance. This room was no longer the whole world; it was only a shelter . . ." (Flush 109). The "typical" Victorian environment takes on a new meaning (and a new unreality) after Flush encounters the conditions in which the poor live, unheeded by the rich; he reevaluates his life based on his Whitechapel experience, calling educational practices and environments into question. Woolf had been keen to emphasize the importance of first- hand experience in A Room of One's Own , asserting that the work of the nineteenth-century woman novelist "would have profited" if "experience and intercourse and travel had been granted her" (A Room 64). For Elizabeth Barrett- at least, in Woolf' s version of her story- merely becoming aware of Whitechapel' s existence proves highly educative, opening her mind to poverty and hardship and compelling her to act autonomously, outside the bounds of Victorian decorum. Warned by "threatening" and "dissuading" male relations that going in person to Whitechapel to pay the ransom for Flush would be "madness," Elizabeth Barrett feels the familiar crush of patriarchal rule and begins to chafe under it. She considers "how easy it would have been to sink back on [the] pillows and sigh, 'I am a weak woman; I know nothing of law and justice; decide for me'" (Flush 100). But she does take bold action, realizing that she will retrieve Flush only by "[standing] her ground" (107). For her, Whitechapel is an awakening, as it is for her little dog. Both learn something about a way of life that is far from the over-decorated, oppressive safety of the back bedroom, and both strive to act in accord with this new understanding. In Flush, however, Woolf does not suggest that the Victorian "back bed- room" education was without value to those who received it. Indeed, her own history as a successful learner in this context proves otherwise. The inadequacy of the standard nineteenth-century feminine education is a cat- alyst to Flush's fuller education; when he is at last able to run free in Italy, he can appreciate that freedom, because he has known both the Wimpole Street and the Whitechapel schoolrooms. His regulated schooling at the Barrett house and his confinement in the prison of Whitechapel, although both intensely painful, have at the very least prepared him to rebel effec- tively and meaningfully, when the time is right, and to understand the importance of liberty as a principle. For Virginia Woolf and other "daugh- ters of educated men," the time had long been right. In A Room of One's Own, Woolf reminds the women of Girton that ("at least two") colleges had been opened to women since 1866, that they could now own property, vote, and legally join "most of the professions," but that legal rights do not easi- ly translate into realities (A Room 101). By the third decade of the century,</page><page sequence="13">C≈Ñtic 73.2 13 long after women were allowed access to higher education and to the pro- fessions, Woolf continued to be disgusted by the inequities in both of those spheres. Thus, throughout Three Guineas , Woolf's narrator voices her resolve to see justice prevail. It is time, she writes, for action, and her aim is "to assert 'the rights of all- all men and women- to the respect in their per- sons of the great principles of Justice and Equality and Liberty/ To elabo- rate further is unnecessary" (272). By the 1930s, when Woolf was writing both Flush and Three Guineas , regard for tradition and strict adherence to a system of instruction- what Isabel Wood called angrily, in her letter to Times , "slavish imitation of men's education" - seemed to order and define women's higher education. Such a conventional attitude was distasteful to Woolf, who considered experience just as important as formal schooling and who emphasized both travel and adventure as parts of the well-rounded education. The Oxbridge women's colleges, however, thought differently. When Woolf's contemporary, Vera Brittain (1893-1970), who had served in World War I as a military nurse in France, returned to Somerville College in 1919 to finish her course of study, she found that her wartime experience was lightly valued. In a post-War section of her 1933 memoir, Testament of Youth, revealingly titled "Survivors Not Wanted," she wrote of her hope for a warm reception, marked by respect and understanding, from her fellow undergraduates: "These young Somervillians were bound, I thought hopefully, to feel an interest in some- one who had had first-hand experience of the greatest event of their gener- ation, and, being interested, perhaps they would be kind" (475). Unfortunately, her optimism was misplaced, for Brittain was "considerably shaken" by her tutors' "grim" reception and her classmates' insensitivity; the latter appeared "astonished and almost affronted" by her inability to readily immerse herself in their insular, strictly academic world (4 77). But Woolf, unlike Vera Brittain's Oxford acquaintances, insisted upon experience, particularly the kind that comes by travel and by encountering challenging circumstances, as essential to true education- as, in fact, an invaluable source of teaching. To make this case, she situated Flush in a number of locations, from the "back bedroom," to Whitechapel, to Three Mile Cross, to Florence, and each of the little spaniel's forays and voyages contributes to his learning. As Flush is a transitional work, positioned between A Room of One's Own and Three Guineas , it is especially illuminat- ing to examine Flush's move from London to Italy in light of Woolf's esteem for experience, and in relation to those other texts. Such an examination calls for a r√©√©valuation of Susan Squier's assertion that, in Flush , London is patriarchal and stifling and Italy is matriarchal and nurturing; for Flush the dog, both countries offer new opportunities for learning and are therefore instructive.5 Woolf does not assert in A Room , Flush , or Three Guineas that women must flee English patriarchy and gain true education by living abroad. On the contrary, she advocates travel as a respected supplement to,</page><page sequence="14">14 Knauer not a replacement for, reform of the existing British educational system, a project on which she focuses her exhortations and energies. Flush points the way toward educational equality by absorbing what is best in conventional instruction for women, while challenging the needless- ly restrictive and injurious aspects of it. In Italy, no longer obsessed with learning and following the "rules" of Regent's Park, he enjoys absolute free- dom in pursuing his desires. As he becomes "his own master" later in life, Flush forsakes further traditional schooling in favor of physical sensation. The thoughtful and well-educated Flush eventually recognizes that a truly fulfilled way of life includes pleasure- eating, drinking, "spending a quiet evening" at home, story-telling, and playing (163): "It was not to stare at pictures, to penetrate into dark churches and look up at dim frescoes, that Flush scampered off when the door of Casa Guidi was left open" (126-27); instead, he goes in search of sexual adventures- "love that brings no train of care in its wake; that has no shame; no remorse" (127). Woolf holds up Flush as a model student: as one, however unprepossessing- who is, after all, "only" a dog- who deserves to be emulated. In truth, Woolf' s Flush is only "silly" in the sense that it reveals silliness, especially the absurdity of British social norms of gender and class. The lit- tle spaniel comically, playfully, and effectively asks readers to reflect upon the unreasonable restrictions that were in actuality placed upon the nine- teenth-century and, indeed, even upon the twentieth-century middle-class woman. Edward Moulton Barrett, who treats his daughter as an invalid and forbids her to marry, may, in the particulars of his conduct, seem more severe than most Victorian fathers, but his abuse of authority is representa- tive. Flush is terrified of this "force that he was powerless to withstand," and Elizabeth Barrett, reared under that force's watchful eye, responds in fearful and "silly" fashion to his rules (Flush 51), carrying on a clandestine courtship with Robert Browning and running away in order to marry him. No wildly romantic impulses drive her to take such covert action; rather, the unbending rule of her father and the conventions of her social world appear to leave her little recourse but to behave melodramatically. Restriction breeds such silliness, it seems, an idea Woolf also highlight- ed in A Room of One's Own. As Michele Barrett notes of that earlier text, "In pointing to instances- the education of women for instance- where exter- nal constraints hamper freedom of mind, [Woolf] implies that where such constraints do not exist some absolute mental freedom would exist" (xxi). Flush embraces mental freedom when he assumes control of his own edu- cation in Italy; he runs, rests, begs, explores, and lives by his own direction. Elizabeth Barrett Browning, however, has not learned her lesson so well. Although much more her "own mistress" in Italy, as Flush is "his own mas- ter," she is unable to escape entirely the deforming effects of the patriarchal rule that shaped her. In Italy, Flush recognizes that his mistress at times misuses her freedom, particularly when engaging in spiritualist practices</page><page sequence="15">Critic 73.2 15 that lead her to ignore the material world in front of her. This "preoccupa- tion" with seances causes her to waste "a fine hot day" by sitting at a table and waiting for it to move, or to spend "a dark starry night" predicting woe for the unfortunate servant, Wilson, who fled Wimpole Street with her (162); the wiser Flush determines that this is a "highly unpleasant way of spending a quiet evening. Better far to sit and read one's book" (163). Regarding the fascination with spiritualism as an enslavement of the mind, not as evidence of free-thinking, Flush mirrors the opinion of Woolf's nar- rator, who censures Elizabeth Barrett Browning for falling prey, even while abroad, to yet another "convention" of Victorian life- a "silly" craze that blinded the intellect and defied logic. Flush successfully plays the role of a transitional text between the better known A Room and Three Guineas , in part because it represents a hybrid genre: it is biography and fantasy, fact and fiction, history and polemic, and it presents as its main character a dog living in a human's world. Woolf uses Flush to great advantage in the realms of both fact and fiction, allowing him to speak to a myriad of issues; as she writes in A Room , "fiction here is like- ly to contain more truth than fact" (4). Conceived as a parody of Lytton Strachey's Eminent Victorians , undertaken as a respite from the exhausting work of The Waves (1931), and designed, as Pamela Caughie has demon- strated, to make money for its author, Flush is not an easy work to pin down (Caughie 53). It cannot be brushed off merely as a lighthearted critique of Victorianism, but neither does it present only weighty themes. As a "histor- ical biographical figure," Flush connects with the literary Barretts and Brownings and becomes both a likeable and a credible figure in his own right. Yet as a dog, and a nineteenth-century one at that, he is never a whol- ly reliable commentator. In a letter of March 1933, Woolf herself admitted that "very little is known about [Flush], and I have had to invent a good deal. I hope however that I have thrown some light upon his character" (Letters 5:167). Unlike the statistics about women's wages in Three Guineas , there are no tables and charts about Flush's reality to which Woolf is beholden; she can endow him with whatever attributes and insights she sees fit. At the same time, his pronouncements have far less authority than those of Woolf's personae in A Room and in Three Guineas. Flush does make political points - about feminism, art, education, and professionalism- though never as systematically or insistently as does A Room or Three Guineas. In A Room , Woolf asserts that "when a subject is highly controversial - and any question about sex is that- one cannot hope to tell the truth" (4); instead, "One can only show how one came to hold whatever opinion one does hold" (4). The example of Flush indicates that, while there is no patently easy solution to the educational injustices of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, progress is possible. For Woolf, improvement always begins by educating women and encouraging them to enter realms from which they have been barred. Flush does this when he</page><page sequence="16">16 Knauer disregards the raised eyebrows of Robert Browning and chooses to scamper about Florence at all hours of the night. He also crosses boundaries when he assumes the unlikely role of the infant Penini' s playmate and traveling part- ner (they are similarly uninspired by the supposed beauty of the Apennines), when he reclaims his sexuality in Italy and when, at an advanced age, he becomes tutor to the neighborhood mongrels. Under a statue in the center of town, the sagacious Flush recounts "his stories of Whitechapel and Wimpole Street" to the "young dogs" that gather eagerly around him (Flush 155). Similarly, as Jacqui Griffiths notes, the "enlightened Flush" shares his "views" and "tastes" with the Brownings' baby (168). In every context, Flush pushes the limits, transcends the prescribed function of domestic pet, learns, and applies his knowledge beyond the limits of the Victorian house. The roles that he assumes are progressive, but they are also increasingly right, just as they could and should be right for women. Even so, Flush is a male dog, which forces readers to consider whether gender has anything, or much, to do with his success as a student and rev- olutionary. Certainly, he suffers the same confinement as the "educated man's daughter," Elizabeth Barrett. In Wimpole Street, he is similarly "priv- ileged" with material luxury but has nothing to call his own, and he is weighed down by the patriarchal British world of rules and regulations. But, unlike the nineteenth-century lady and more like the nineteenth-centu- ry gentleman, Flush also has opportunities for outside education, experi- ence, travel, sexual liberty, and achievement of a position of honor. Rather than merely reinforcing, however, the conventional point that men have advantages and women do not, Woolf uses Flush as an example to modern women readers, encouraging them to be bold. If a dog can learn, travel, pur- sue pleasure, and teach the art of living, surely they can too. Elizabeth Barrett Browning, as a Victorian gentlewoman, could not, at last, realize freedom to the degree that Flush does, but her successors are better equipped and better educated. They can, as Woolf writes in A Room , devel- op a "habit of freedom and the courage to write exactly what [they] think" They must, nonetheless, be forceful about withdrawing "a little from the common sitting-room" and declaring their independence (102). In addition to being identified with the Victorian woman, Flush, because he is male, also represents a new kind of masculinity. He is an androgynous and almost anonymous figure: a male dog educated as a nine- teenth-century female, and a non-human version of an "everyman" charac- ter. Julia Briggs echoes this idea when she calls Flush "a profoundly ambiguous hero: while his masculinity may act as a literary liberation for his author, his fine-timed social sensibilities and lack of social agency sug- gest the feminine" (277). His androgyny is both enigmatic and illustrative- embodying the repressed Victorian female, while also serving as an inspir- ing model for men. As an "everyman," Flush effectively initiates communi- cation between the sexes. He figures in what had been an exclusively</page><page sequence="17">Critic 73.2 17 woman-centered conversation in A Room and gestures toward the collabo- ration across gender that Woolf endorses in the later Three Guineas. He is not Elizabeth Barrett, yet is like her, because he has similar experiences; he is not the male barrister of Three Guineas , yet is like him, because he has simi- lar privileges. Ultimately, of course, Flush is himself, a dog- lovable, non- threatening, and different from both his female mistress and from the human men in the narrative. Audiences are inclined to accept him on the basis of this difference. Through the creation of a furry-eared animal, one who is privy to the quiet conversation and daily routine of the "back bed- room," Woolf casually invites a male figure into the nineteenth-century domestic realm and into feminist conversations about education. With Flush , Woolf opens lines of communication- lines unplumbed in A Room , which addresses women as a group, but not men- and prepares readers for the more dialogic Three Guineas. The character of Flush is the forerunner, the androgynous animal that paves the way for cross-gender communication between humans in the later work. In his own story, he is always a bridge-figure; his first owner, Miss Mitford, finds it "unthinkable" to sell him, yet gives him away as a proof of friendship: "Flush was worthy of Miss Barrett; Miss Barrett was worthy of Flush" (Flush 22-23). Elizabeth Barrett and Miss Mitford remain connected because of Flush, and he thinks of them both with great affection. As a symbol of shared love and sacrifice, Flush's presence influences the relationship of husband and wife and seems to bind Elizabeth and Robert closer together. In Italy, Elizabeth Barrett Browning comments happily that "'Robert is as fond of Flush as I am'" (Flush 142). Flush fills an additional role as mediator between mother and child by acting as Baby Pen Browning's nurse, and he functions as some- thing between friend and teacher to the Italian neighborhood dogs. As a transitional figure himself, Flush underlines the transitional work that text in which he appears is out to accomplish. Thus, he prepares read- ers for the more complex, more extended feminist debate that surfaces in Three Guineas. As Ellen Bayuk Rosenman writes in A Room of One's Own: Women Writers and the Politics of Creativity, "the essence of Three Guineas is to explain the interlocking patriarchal oppressions of sexism, imperialism and class struggle. Woolf does not so much abandon the cause of women as join it with related causes" (34). In Three Guineas, Woolf wrote about fascism as a wake-up call for men, too - even for those who previously had been blind to the need to counter patriarchy: The whole iniquity of dictatorship, whether in Oxford or Cambridge, in Whitehall or Downing Street, against Jews or against women, in England, or in Germany, in Italy or in Spain is now apparent to you. But now we are fighting together. The daughters and sons of educated men are fighting side by side. (Three Guineas 228)</page><page sequence="18">18 Knauer Flush anticipates this emphasis on understanding and collaboration, linking men and women, politics and locations, diverse identities and ideals. With Flush , Woolf challenges her audience to look closely at evolving views of women's education, even as she explores her own evolving views. Presented to readers in the early 1930s, between the publication of A Room of One's Own and o√≠ Three Guineas, and at a time when concerns over war and fascism were escalating, Flush recalls the history of gender-based exclu- sion from places and ways of learning that Woolf had expounded in A Room, while setting the stage for her impassioned pleas to educated men and women in Three Guineas, on behalf of preventing war. Flush's political principles are also Woolf' s, expressed through its protagonist's joyous cele- bration of the comradeship he achieves with both Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning: "We are all three conspirators in the most glorious of causes. We are joined in sympathy. We are joined in hatred. We are joined in defiance of black and beetling tyranny. We are joined in love" (Flush 81). This is what a successful education produces- whether for women, men, or dogs. Univeristy of Delaware Notes 1 Jutta Ittner, Craig Smith, and Jacqui Griffiths all question biographical and narra- tive aspects of Flush. In Virginia Woolf and London , Susan Squier considers the dog Flush as a "stand-in for the woman writer," and as occupying "a marginal position in society" and so deals with both biographical and canonical issues (124-25). Pamela Caughie's "Flush and the Literary Canon: Oh where oh where has that little dog gone?" (1991) furthers Squier's efforts by considering Flush's excess as proof of its canonicity. Gillian Beer examines Flush in relation to Woolf' s other works in "The Victorians in Virginia Woolf: 1832-1942." 2 Pamela Caughie argues that there is, in fact, great value in wasting time. She con- siders that "the value of time- wasting lies in the change it brings about in our way of valuing"; see "Flush and the Literary Canon: Oh where oh where has that little dog gone?" (1991). 3 Such disgust over women's entrapment manifests itself in other works written by women in the late nineteenth century, as evidenced by Vera Brittain's memoir Testament of Youth, published in 1933. This contemporary of Woolf provides a detailed picture of the common nineteenth-century relationship of fathers to daugh- ters and highlights the unreasonable nature of parental attitudes toward the daugh- ter's education. 4 See, for example, Alison Booth's "The Scent of a Narrative: Rank Discourse in 'Flush' and 'Written on the Body'" (2000), Anna Snaith's "Of Fanciers, Footnotes, and Fascism," Craig Smith's "Across the Widest Gulf," Susan Squier's Virginia Woolf and London, and Pamela Caughie's Virginia Woolf and Postmodernism. 5 In Virginia Woolf and London: the Sexual Politics of the City (1985), Susan Squier has argued that Flush is a "stand-in for the woman writer" (124) and that his eventual move "from imprisonment in London to freedom in the foreign cities" of Italy is</page><page sequence="19">Critic 73.2 19 indicative of female psychological liberation (122). Squier contends that in contrast to free and matriarchal Italy, an environment which Woolf seems to idealize, Flush's London is confining, patriarchal, hidebound, and repressive. While location is cer- tainly a major factor in Flush's education, it is possible to overstate the importance of this dichotomy between London and Italy.
