<plain_text><page sequence="1">192 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES Purposive Evolution, by Edmund Noble. (London, George Allen &amp; Unwin, Ltd., 1927.) The purposiveness of Nature that is discussed, in this volume, with scientific learning and wealth of quotation, with comprehensiveness and in detail, in eloquent and dignified style, is not what ' purposiveness ' means, but might, with more propriety and regard for established mean ings, be called non-purposiveness. It is not identical or coextensive with internal teleology, the striving for self-betterment which is at tributed to organisms ; nor with the external or transcendent teleology invoked by the theist. It is rather the Zweckmàssigkeit, as contrasted with Absichtlichkeit, that only implies adaptedness in things, and con ceivably may find explanation, such as Kant sought, otherwise than in terms of the category of end. Indeed it is regarded by the author as the outcome of unintelligent ' force'. The emergence of adaptation suggestive of purpose is, of course, then left an enexplained mystery. Contrivance or design in Nature, we arç told (p. 524), 'is the ele mentary form of the end-reaching we witness and practise in our lives as organisms. Out of a process which has endurance for its goal emerges in both living and not-living the intelligence of "intelligent" adaptations. In accepting this view we deliver purposiveness from its supposed origin in psychic elements ; the notion of a cosmos ruled by mind widens out into the thought of a cosmos potential of mind ... ; the appeal to the argument from [sic] design yields to the argument from the nature of power.' The ' ancient thought of conscious design ' is rejected (p. 525) ' for the conception of an omnipresent primordial intelligence identical with things '. These citations so speak for themselves as to need no comment. And they are typical illustrations of the author's habit of mind. Indeed the generatio aequivoca and ' the naturalist's fallacy ' are favourite in struments in these chapters. Thus it is said (p. 531) that ' any worthy view of the cosmos process requires us to reverse the procedure of subjectivism by using for tjie interpretation of Nature not the super ficial characters of life, but rather the fundamental characters of universe power'; and it is argued (p. 533) that inasmuch as 'such personality as we know rests on a foundation of impersonal characters neither con sciously originated nor consciously directed ', the voluntary activities of the organism are determined by the properties of matter. Thought that is so ' comprehensive ' as to identify heights with depths, fruits with roots, the emergent with the ' superficial ', and so levelling as to obliterate the difference between intelligence and unintelligent things, and to absorb the category of end into that of unconscious cause, can</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 193 hardly illumine cosmic problems : to blur vital distinctions does but reinstate pre-scientific nebulosity. To attribute the adaptedness of the world to a potency for adaptive ness does not solve, but only restates, the problem set by the facts of adaptation and of progress. Teleology, invoking purposiveness proper, whether it be a true or a false explanation, at any rate explains. And it is belated to decry it as subjective or anthropomorphic, now that we know the category of cause or power to have the self-same origination as that of end, and to know none but the pragmatic justification obtain able by any ' regulative ' concept.</page></plain_text>
