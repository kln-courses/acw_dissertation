<plain_text><page sequence="1">METAPHOR AND MYTH IN SCIENCE AND RELIGION By EARL R. MACCORMAC. Durham, N.C., Duke University Press, 1976. Pp. xviii, 167. $7.95. George Eliot makes some wry comments about metaphor in The Mill on the Floss. She complains "It was doubtless an ingenious idea to call the camel the ship of the desert, but it would hardly lead one far in training that useful beast," then ridicules those sages who so rarely speak without a metaphor that they cannot say what a thing is except by declaring it is something else. Earl MacCormac defends metaphor against Eliot's charges. His aim is to prove that religious language cannot bejudged meaningless in comparison with other sorts of discourse. To establish this claim, he argues that metaphor is essential to both science and theology, and that metaphor functions similarly in both fields. MacCormac believes that metaphor is essential to science, that without it scientists could neither change the meanings of terms nor suggest new hypotheses. Thus MacCormac claims that whenever a scientific theory changes, or whenever one theory succeeds another, this is accomplished through the use of metaphor. Scientists employ metaphors to convey ideas about the unknown, and "old scientific terms that change their meanings in, new theories are necessarily metaphoric" (p. 100). I can't say I find this claim too plausible. It is not clear that when 299</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS Ptolemaic astronomy gave way to Copernican theory any terms became metaphorical. Nor do I see any grounds for insisting that Copernicus had to envision metaphors (the sun as a grapefruit) in order to formulate his theory. MacCormac associates speculation and tentative imaginings with metaphor, but this construes meta- phor too widely, counting any new and surprising flight of fancy as a trope. Fantasies and lies needn't be metaphorical. Nor is metaphor an essential vehicle for speculation; consider our attributions of motives to people, of prices to objects, of answers to riddles. The religious counterpart to MacCormac's claim is easier to accept. Metaphor does seem essential to theology. If God is a trans- cendent being with properties beyond human ken, we can't know Him the way we know our neighbors. We can only approximate His nature through a series of metaphors. And these will undoubtedly strike us as puzzling and paradoxical. In addition to arguing that metaphor is equally essential to science and religion, MacCormac claims that metaphor functions in precisely the same way in these realms. MacCormac subscribes to a tension theory of metaphor: metaphors generate shock and surprise because they are literally false and often patently absurd. He extends the ten- sion theory by distinguishing two different aspects of metaphor, the suggestive and the expressive. Borrowing terminology from Philip Wheelwright, he labels diaphors those metaphors which are primarily suggestive, and epiphors those which are primarily expressive. Mac- Cormac holds that epiphors express experience analogous to that of the hearer and that therefore they are confirmable. Diaphors, by contrast, are suggestive. They offer presentational juxtapositions rather than discursive comparisons. Diaphors resist paraphrase and they cannot be tested by common experience. MacCormac's account of metaphor rests on a shaky foundation, for many of his assumptions about meaning, language, and psychology are questionable. For example, his use of the term "expressive" is seriously misleading. Emotive theorists contrast the expressive function of language with a cognitive or fact-stating function. Expressive utterances are those which vent the feelings and emotions rather than make factual claims. Yet MacCormac takes epiphors- expressive metaphors-to be those whose cognitive or asserted con- tent can be more or less pinned down. More seriously, MacCormac recasts the claim that diaphors are untranslatable as a claim about confirmability. He suggests that one difference between ordinary and metaphorical discourse is the degree of confirmation available for each type of language. The more suggestive metaphors-that is, 300</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS diaphors-are not testable or confirmable in common experience. In fact, a pure diaphor would, MacCormac claims, be wholly unintel- ligible. The problem with this talk of confirmability and testability is that it sets MacCormac's entire theory of metaphor within the framework of a positivist theory of meaning. Conformity to every- day experience and confirmation by everyday experience measure the intelligibility of metaphor. Yet a rejection of the positivist view under- lies MacCormac's basic thesis that the languages of science and religion are equally meaningful, equally indebted to metaphor. As an additional worry, MacCormac's actual examples are per- plexing. Insisting that despite the traditional tenor/vehicle analysis, a metaphor needn't be composed of two words, he offers the follow- ing words as metaphors: particle, God, force, light, and tachyon. MacCormac classes some of these terms as metaphors because, like "tachyon," they inhabit the speculative and hypothetical edges of our going scientific theories; others because, like "light" and "parti- cle," they are ambiguous; still others because, like "God," they stand for things which we cannot fully specify or explain. I don't find these "becauses" compelling. The terms "light" and "tachyon" are not metaphorical just because light can be conceived as a wave or a particle, or because the existence of tachyons remains unconfirmed. Nor is the term "God" itself a metaphor, although we may well have to try to understand God through metaphors. Thus MacCormac's identification of individual metaphors is idiosyncratic. Moreover, since he recognizes too many instances of metaphor, his specification of the correlative realm of the literal is correspondingly shrunken. MacCormac uses his theory of metaphor to ground a theory of myth. He first stipulates that myth is the mistaken attribution of reality to a hypothetical description, then allies myth and metaphor by singling out a particularly fundamental and comprehensive set of diaphoric metaphors-root metaphors-as the basis of our myth making. Thus myths are the mistaken attribution of reality to root metaphors like "the world is like a machine," "the world is chaotic and meaningless," "the world is an organism," "religion-is-the- objective-truth-in-the-Bible," and "religion as the experience-of- the-divine-in-human-life." Myth is a pejorative notion for MacCormac. By its very definition, it involves us in mistake and error. He proposes a simple remedy, however: we ought to replace the language of myth by the language of metaphor. In effect this means that we ought to view all our 301</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS theories as tentative, not risk error or embarrassment by taking them to be absolute or final. I have already criticized MacCormac's account of metaphor; his view of myth suffers from further weaknesses in addition to those inherited from the theory of metaphor on which it is founded. Most noticeably, MacCormac conflates the revisability of scientific theories with their (proven) falsehood. And anthropomorphic stories about the gods and their doings aren't distinguished from vastly different sorts of mistaken explanations, like that of phlogiston theory. The result is a skeptical view of science and a misleading picture of scientific activity. In sum, MacCormac has singled out an extremely interesting problem but his theory is not sufficiently freed from the positivist underpinnings it was meant to replace. Nor are its details sufficiently worked out. MacCormac discusses various sorts of vision. It may well be that we always "see" the world in the guise of one theory or another, but MacCormac hasn't distinguished this sense of "seeing" from the more literal seeing which begets optical illusions nor the "metaphorical" seeing which arises from figures of speech.
