The weavers in this society produced embroidered textiles, which, having been remarkably well preserved in one of the driest deserts on earth, are windows into the art and culture of this prehistoric people. The members of Paracas/Topar? communities buried their dead, prepared as bundles, in cemeteries on the arid Paracas Peninsula of south coastal Peru, from at least Early Horizon epoch 10 through Early Intermediate Period epoch 2 (approximately 100 b.c.-a.d. 200).] The largest of the bundles excavated from a burial zone called the Necr?polis de Wari Kayan were packed with wrapping cloths and woven garments. Paracas Necr?polis garments are untailored (that is, apparel is always fashioned from uncut rectangular webs of cloth), and most comprise a plain weave ground cloth that is the support for stem-stitch embroidery. Embroidered borders are a prominent visual component of these garments, and some of the border design features were remarkably persistent through space and time. For instance, the specific border format on each garment type did not change significantly during three centuries, a design decision that may have been governed by the fact that the border arrangements themselves encoded key symbolic information.2 Another persistent feature of borders?and the theme of this essay?concerns one level of their iconography. I will explore the thesis that borders provided a symbolic, protective boundary on Paracas Necr?polis weavings by partially "sealing" their edges with references to twisted or interlacing strands. Background: the Paracas/Topar? tradition The south coast of Peru between the Ca?ete and Grande rivers teemed with human activity by the early epochs of the Early Horizon, and by EH 9 (circa 200 B.c-100 b.c.) habitation sites, ceremonial centers, and cemeteries were present throughout a region that encompassed numerous valleys, littorals, and the Paracas Peninsula (fig. 1; see Raul 1991a and 1999 for overviews of the archaeology in the geographical area mentioned here). Scientific explorations on this peninsula were undertaken in the late 1920s by the Peruvian archaeologists Julio C. Tello and Toribio Mejia Xesspe. Tello and Mejia excavated three zones called Cavernas, Arena Blanca, and the Necr?polis de Wari Kayan (Tello 1959, Tello and Mejia 1979). They provide descriptions of some of the architecture on the peninsula: deep bottle shaped tombs that had been cut into terraces on the summit of Cerro Colorado (named the Cavernas precinct); underground residential units made up of rows of small, rectangular stone rooms at Arena Blanca (these had been used as cemeteries after having been abandoned as habitation structures); and the remains of retaining walls and subterranean rooms packed with mummy bundles at the Necr?polis precinct. This article has benefited from discussions with Denise Arnold, Sophie Desrosiers, and Susan Ni les, and from comments by anonymous reviewers. In addition, Diane Mott and Helmut Schindler helped in my research by drawing my attention to, and sending me photographs of, artifacts that were relevant to my discussion. I thank each of these individuals. 1. The chronological framework used here includes major time units called horizons or periods; the details that define these units have been filled in by numerous scholars, including D. Menzel, J. Rowe, and L. Dawson (1964), who established a ceramic sequence in which the beginning of each unit is marked by a change in the pottery styles of the south coast lea Valley. Thus the Early Horizon?an arbitrary block of time comprising numerous epochs?begins with the appearance of resin-painted pottery in the lea Valley and ends with the introduction of slip painting on pottery. The sequence of this valley is used as the master sequence to which other objects are assigned on evidence of their contemporaneity with one of its phases. The absolute dates of the Paracas and Paracas/Topar? objects assigned to this system of relative chronology and mentioned in this article are: Early Horizon epochs 3-6 (ca. 700 B.c-400 b.c.); Early Horizon epoch 7 (ca. 400 B.c-300 b.c.); Early Horizon epoch 8 (ca. 300 b.c-200 b.c.); Early Horizon epoch 9 (ca. 200 b.c-1 00 b.c.); Early Horizon epoch 10 (ca. 100 B.c.-O); Early Intermediate Period epoch 1 (ca. 0-a.d. 100); and Early Intermediate Period epoch 2 (ca. a.D. 100-200). These time units will be abbreviated elsewhere in the text as "EH" and "ElP." 2. See Paul 2000a for a description and interpretation of poncho border arrangements. Footnote 7 in this article describes another strictly applied design feature present in the borders of these textiles.</page><page sequence="3">146 RES 38 AUTUMN 2000 Figure 1. Geographical area of the Paracas and Paracas/Topar? cultural traditions on the south coast of Peru (after Paul 1991a:fig. 1.1). Two very different ceramic assemblages were excavated from the peninsular sites (for a detailed discussion, see Peters 1997). Pottery from the Cavernas tombs is the older of the ceramic assemblages, and includes a postfire resin-painted polychrome ware as well as a negative-painted ware. The ceramic fineware found in association with the Necr?polis burials, in contrast, is typically thin-walled, with red or white slip; bottles are frequently modeled in the form of gourds, and have two short spouts connected by a bridge. This pottery belongs to the Topar? tradition and is distinguished from Paracas Cavernas-style pottery by different vessel shapes, decorative techniques, iconography, and technology. While the fineware from the two traditions is strikingly different, many of the utilitarian wares are practically indistinguishable (Peters 1991:241). Some scholars see Paracas Cavernas and Topar? pottery as the products of separate cultural and social formations with discrete art styles; the two pottery styles can also be viewed as the artistic expressions of autonomous societies that shared a common cultural tradition. Large quantities of textiles accompanied the burials on the peninsula. This article focuses on the fabrics from the bundles buried in the Necr?polis cemetery. These textiles share certain traits with the older Paracas Cavernas textiles, but they also introduce different structural, iconographie, and stylistic elements. The Necr?polis burials contained textiles that share some features with earlier Paracas Cavernas fabrics, but they were interred with Topar? pottery, one of the material culture indicators of a major change in south coast societies around EH 10. Hence, I refer to the cultural tradition with which the bundles are associated as Paracas/Topar?. It is not known with certainty where the populations who buried their dead on the peninsula resided, although one strong possibility is in the nearby Pisco and Chincha valleys. Monumental Early Horizon pyramidal mound constructions in the Chincha Valley, for example, reveal the presence of an urban society that had an elaborate ceremonial component. Some scholars hypothesize that the high-ranking individuals who participated in the ceremonies performed at these sites were those who were buried in the cemeteries on the Paracas Peninsula (Canziani 1992:100; Peters 1997:872-873). Paracas Necr?polis border imagery One of the striking aspects of the Necr?polis cemetery was the extraordinary wealth?represented in terms of the number of elaborately decorated fabrics? displayed in certain bundles. Among the 429 bundles originating from the cemetery, 33 were classified as large sized (roughly 1.5 m high by 1.5 m in diameter) and 42 as medium sized (1 m high by 0.9 m in diameter), and their bulk was created by huge quantities of cloth. Many of these bundles have been unwrapped and their contents dated according to the relative chronology referred to above. In this study, my discussion of the Paracas Necropolis-style woven garments is based on a sample of 543 items, including 245 mantles, 111 headcloths or turbans, 106 ponchos,</page><page sequence="4">Paul: Protective perimeters 147 52 skirts, 16 loincloths, and 13 tunics.3 Most of these embroideries originated from 39 of the large and medium scientifically excavated Necr?polis burial bundles (each of which contained the body of an adult male); the sample also includes textiles that lack exact provenience but can be attributed to Paracas/Topar? culture based on style. The earliest specimens date to EH 10A (circa 100 b.c.) and the latest to EIP 2 (circa A.D. 200). Thus the sample is substantial in size, representative of most of the high-status population at the Necr?polis de Wari Kayan, and chronologically comprehensive for Paracas/Topar? culture. It has been over fifteen years since M. Frame (1986) first pointed out the ubiquitous presence of visual images of fabric structures in ancient Andean textiles.4 In her groundbreaking study, she identified both explicit and implicit depictions of such structures?twisted strands and oblique interlacing in particular- in a wide range of stylistically diverse textiles. While Frame mentions the fact that borders are often the carriers of fabric structure iconography (1986:56), the possible symbolic implication of putting such imagery around the perimeters of cloth is not her primary concern. My study uses Frame's work as a springboard to explore the use of this imagery specifically in the borders of Paracas Necr?polis garments. In the sample of borders that I examined, there are very few literal depictions of twisted strands, and none of oblique interlacing, though both structures are common motifs on Necr?polis oblique interlaced headbands (see Frame 1991 :figs. 4.1, 4.2, 4.5-10). The most explicit representation depicts adjacent rows of two twisted strands, one pair with an S twist and the other with a Z twist (fig. 2a).5 In this example, curiously, each individual strand in a pair changes color where it passes behind the second strand so that color does not work in tandem with structure.

These numbers do not represent the total number of extant Paracas Necr?polis textiles because (1) my slide documentation of each fabric does not always include a sequence of at least two border images, the minimum requirement for the analysis that follows, and (2) those fragmentary textiles for which it is not possible to reconstruct the garment type are not included in the sample. 4. Frame presented the ideas developed in her 1982 master's thesis at a conference held at The Textile Museum in Washington, D.C. in 1984, the proceedings of which were published in 1986. 5. The direction of twist is designated either S or Z according to the orientation of the slant of the twisted fibers.</page><page sequence="5">148 RES 38 AUTUMN 2000 fCX.rTTl 7 / / / ? 7\ kl v / / mi?k.li^Himi^.wwi^HHitfUi.mlfi Figure 3.

Peters. of twisted strands, even if not immediately perceptible on the textiles themselves (see fig. 3a), uses the outlines of twisted-strand imagery as a framing device for linear style serpents and felines (figs. 3-4). There are also rare examples of twisted strand images along the edges of the clothing depicted on the anthropomorphs embroidered in the borders (fig. 5; see also Uhle 1914: fig. 2; Brinckerhoff 1999: 11, cat. no. 13). One step removed from these relatively straightforward images of fabric structures are those that show two snakes twisting around each other like threads (Rickenbach 1999:pl. 47; Stone-Miller 1992:fig. 198; Bird and Bellinger 1954:pl. VIII left). Finally, there are representations of double-headed snakes that give the impression that they are twisting strands, because the bodies are placed diagonally across the border width and the head at the end of each threadlike body interlocks with the head of an adjacent snake to suggest twining (figs. 6-7; for additional illustrations, see Raul 1983 :figs. 4-10). While snake imagery lends itself to replicating strands, the other figurai types on Paracas Necr?polis embroideries do not (figs. 8-10). Nonetheless, fabric structures may be a meaningful aspect of the textile iconography in a less overt, more abstract form. When Paracas Necr?polis embroiderers stitched images in borders, they may have been concerned with both the orientation of each iconographie unit and with the types of one-dimensional repeating patterns that could be generated by the symmetrical relationships between</page><page sequence="6">Paul: Protective perimeters 149 Figure 4.

For instance, the borders in figure 8 have feline depictions oriented in two different ways relative to the edges of the cloth, regularly alternating vertical and horizontal orientations. A visual shorthand notation for this figurai arrangement, comprising crooked arrows, appears on the right side of figure 8. Here, if we imagine one feline (or one arrow) turning around a point midway between itself and the adjacent motif, we see that they are congruent. The symmetry operation employed in their repetition is bifold rotation, the same symmetry that underlies twisted strands (Frame 1991:fig. 4.20). 6. The motions of symmetry that will discussed in this article include (1) translation, a "shift of position without change in orientation" (Shepard 1948:219), (2) glide reflection, defined as "simultaneous translation and longitudinal reflection resulting in alternate right and left images along the axis of the bands" (ibid., p. 219), and bifold rotation, 180 degree "rotation about a series of equally spaced axes" (?bid., p. 219).</page><page sequence="7">150 RES 38 AUTUMN 2000 a? ??Mk @ @]&lt;r I -4r?r r W&lt; &gt; ? nfrT?

The interlocking feline motifs, indicated by arrows, repeat in bifold rotation in the borders. After Paul 2000a:fig. 8. References to the structure of oblique interlacing are incorporated with even greater frequency into border iconography, as seen in the diagrams in figures 9 and 10, where glide reflection is the basis of the symmetry patterns of figurai repeats. In this symmetry operation, there is a change in orientation as well as a shift in position: the motif glides up or down in the border as it simultaneously reverses itself as though it were reflecting in a mirror. Here, the repeating pattern of the embroidered images "is generated by the same axes of glide reflection that generate the structure of an oblique interlaced fabric" (Frame 1991:138-139, fig. 4.22).</page><page sequence="8">Paul: Protective perimeters 151 Figure 9.

An anthropomorphic figure in a bird costume repeats in glide reflection in the two borders on this garment. After Paul 1991 b:fig. 5.6. In other words, while not pictures o? fabric structures like the imagery in figures 2-7, the alternation pattern of the embroidered images in borders seems to be determined by "the underlying skeleton of fabric structure symmetry. . . ." (Frame 1986:54). Why encode twisted/interlaced strand imagery in this fashion rather than depict it literally? One possible explanation is that different types of images serve different purposes. I have argued elsewhere (Paul 1990) that the people who made and wore these garments utilized a complex visual symbol system in which embroidered images of animals, plants, and anthropomorphs functioned as ideograms, relaying information about Paracas/Topar? world view and the religious obligations of their leaders. The symmetry patterns of these same motifs convey something else. Paracas Necr?polis textile border iconography, then, functions on at least two levels. Figure 10.

Shaman figures repeat in glide reflection in the exterior and interior borders of the poncho. After Paul 1991b:fig. 5.21. While Frame argues that the symmetry of fabric structures is at the core of the symmetry of figurai repeats, she is careful to point out that there are "limits to identifying specific structures on the basis of symmetry" (Frame 1986:n. 4). For one thing, as is the case in some of the border repeats described below, more than one type of symmetry can be present in the repetition of a design unit. In such a case, which of the symmetries should be used to identify a specific textile structure? For another, "the symmetry of one fabric structure in a band can overlap with a different structure in a limited field repeat" (ibid., n. 4). I view band patterns and the two-dimensional field repeats as discrete design elements that occupy distinct areas of the cloth, a point that I will return to shortly. The sample examined here provides statistical and contextual data that support and strengthen Frame's thesis and mitigate the above reservations, at least as they pertain to Paracas Necr?polis borders.</page><page sequence="9">152 RES 38 AUTUMN 2000 i [ f |-? g ? ? ? ? 4? 4* ? &lt;~ * J Figure 11. Sketches showing the range of band patterns in Paracas Necr?polis borders. The possibilities include (a-d) asymmetrical design units and designs with point symmetry parallel to the edge of the band; (e-g) asymmetrical design units and designs with point symmetry at right angles to the edge of the band; (h) bilaterally symmetrical design units parallel to the edge of the band; (i) bilaterally symmetrical design units at right angles to the edge of the band; and (j) design units that are symmetrical on two axes. Glide reflection occurs on a, e, and h; bifold rotation occurs on b, c, f, g; glide reflection and bifold rotation both occur on i and j; and translation alone occurs on d. In Paracas Necr?polis embroidered borders, a design unit can be asymmetrical, bilaterally symmetrical, or symmetrical on two axes, or possess point symmetry, and it can be positioned in the border so that its body axis is either parallel or at right angles to the edge of the band (fig. 11). These choices run across all styles of formal construction (that is, linear, broad line, or block color; see Paul 1990 for descriptions of embroidery styles). Normally, a single iconographie type appears on a textile; when this motif is repeated along a straight line, as it is in borders, a band pattern results. Mathematicians have enumerated seven different types of regular band patterns (see Shepard 1948:218ff., fig. 2; Washburn and Crowe 1988:57-58, fig. 2.26), each characterized by a particular motion of repetition. Paracas Necr?polis borders, however, almost always employ just two of these, either glide reflection or bifold rotation (see table 1). It is possible to have more than one essential motion of repetition in a single band. The design units in figures 11c, 11 g, and 11 h, for instance, repeat in a combination of (1) bifold rotation and translation, or (2) glide reflection and translation. Even though translation is present, these one-dimensional patterns are generally described "by the other motions which clearly distinguish them . . . without explicit mention of the translations which are present, by definition, in all repeated patterns" (Washburn and Crowe 1988:94). More ambiguous are the borders on 23 textiles that combine the motions of glide reflection and bifold rotation (figs. 11 i, j); in these cases, I do not know if one fabric structure is meant to be evoked over another. Of particular significance for this study is the fact that over 97 percent of the borders in the sample have symmetry patterns that are either glide reflection or bifold rotation.7 7. Another aspect of Paracas Necr?polis border design for which the rules are rigid is the clockwise or counterclockwise orientation of figures around the outer edge of a weaving. When a motif is aligned so that its central axis is parallel to the edge of an exterior border, the tops of figures almost always point in a clockwise direction; when it is positioned at right angles to the edge of the cloth, the feet or head of the image (depending on iconographie type) face clockwise (figs. 9-10). Out of a sample of well over 500 garments, the ?mages on nearly 68 percent are oriented in this way. A great number of other figurai types are positioned so that their orientation is simultaneously clockwise and counterclockwise (figs. 3, 4, 6, 7, 12a). This configuration comprises roughly 27 percent of the sample. The orientation choice that is avoided in Paracas Necr?polis-style textiles</page><page sequence="10">Paul: Protective perimeters 1 53 TABLE 1 TYPES OF SYMMETRY REPETITION IN PARACAS NECR?POLIS BORDERS Type of symmetry repetition Number of examples Percentage of total Glide reflection 393 72.0% Bifold rotation 115 21.0% Glide reflection and bifold rotation 23 4.3% Translation alone 4 0.7% Exceptions* 8 2.0% * In most of the exceptions there is more than iconographie type per garment, so we can not speak of a design unit repeating itself in a band pattern. This finding is especially interesting in light of Washburn and Crowe's observation that: symmetry classifications of bodies of data from ethnographic groups have revealed that cultural groups (i.e., interacting peoples who share a common life system) have preferential ways of arranging design elements. That is, rather than randomly using all seven one-dimensional classes and all seventeen two-dimensional classes and numerous of the infinite number of finite classes, a given cultural group will consistently use only several specific symmetries in their design system. Washburn and Crowe 1988:24 Though the range of iconographie types on Paracas Necr?polis textiles is large, the number of ways of arranging them in borders is severely limited?so restricted, in fact, that it is probable that symmetry type itself constitutes another level of iconography. In so far as Paracas/Topar? societies are concerned, part of the answer to Washburn and Crowe's (1988:29) key question "Why do people consistently prefer and choose certain ordering systems?" is that the artisans' preferences for the structural arrangements described above reflect the importance in their culture of manipulating fiber. Some Paracas Necr?polis garments have figures embroidered in their fields in addition to those in the borders, and the motions of symmetry present in these field patterns are related to those in borders. They include glide reflection, bifold rotation, translation, and mirror reflection. Using these four isometries, Raracas/Topar? weavers produced a variety of patterns, some of which may also allude to the symmetry of fabric structures (Raul 2000b). Borders and the visual information they carry, though, seem to hold a place of primacy in the hierarchy of design elements on the fabrics. First, although almost all Paracas Necr?polis embroidered garments have borders, only 165 have additional figures in their fields (ibid.). It is exceedingly rare that a finished Paracas Necr?polis garment has no borders (and in the few cases known to me, there may originally have been borders that are no longer attached to the cloth), but it is not uncommon to have undecorated fields. Second, during the final epoch of the cultural tradition (El 2), the border isometries described above continued to be used, while the rigid motions in the field surface designs begin to change, probably reflecting a gradual transformation of the system that determined the underlying organization of figurai orientation in the fields. The tenacity in the rules of border design emphasizes the conservative nature of borders and may underscore their particular importance to the garment. It is unclear if any of the one-dimensional symmetry patterns present on the borders work in conjunction with color-pattern symmetry. In borders with bifold rotation symmetry patterns they might: my sample includes borders with anywhere from two to eight differently colored figures (or color blocks) arranged in regular alternation, possibly suggesting the number of strands twisting together (figs. 6-8). In the embroidered depiction of actual twisting strands (fig. 2b), however, a single strand changes color at each point where it passes is one in which the exterior design units face counterclockwise; a mere 5 percent of the textiles fall into this design category. Interpretation of these particular orientation preferences is beyond the scope of this article, but they are mentioned to underscore the fact that purposeful choices of long duration permeate Paracas Necr?polis border design.

Hence, even in the most overt representation of this textile structure, color pattern and underlying symmetry are disconnected. Most glide reflection patterns clearly divorce color from the underlying symmetry type (figs. 9-10). The borders in this class usually have four or more color blocks (there are a handful of examples with three color blocks) so that there is a disjunction between the implied structure of three-strand oblique interlacing and the number of "strands" alluded to. The borders on at least one mantle (fig. 12a) may have two discrete but overlaid references to oblique interlacing: first, there are two parallel rows of figures repeating in glide reflection, each row mirroring the symmetry of three-strand oblique interlacing (fig. 12b) and, second, the color blocks of these figures are staggered so that when like color blocks are joined by lines, the image of a four-strand braid is invoked (fig. 12c).8 It is possible that allusions to oblique interlacing are added to the perimeters of Necr?polis weavings in yet another way. Supplementary edgings constructed of cross-knit looping are regularly attached to the exterior edges of borders (fig. 13). These edgings are single element constructions in which the movement of the hand making the loops is not unlike that of the hand movement followed for stem-stitch embroidery. Though these edges do not resemble twisting or oblique interlacing in structure, visually "the effect of the face of cross-knit looping is sometimes described as braided" (Emery 1966:32, figs. 12, 14, 373). The insistence with which this accessory fabric was joined to the garments' edges suggests that it may have been a supplementary boundary and a visual reference to one of the structures discussed above. Finally, twisting and interlacing appear on edges of another type of Paracas Necr?polis fiber artifact. Speaking of the baskets that held the elite dead buried at the Necr?polis de Wari Kayan, King (1965:253) says that "the usual Paracas funeral baskets were large, shallow, coiled baskets with a 'false' braid rim" (fig. 14). According to King (1965:265-266), these rims are one of the important distinguishing traits of Necr?polis coiled basketry (for 8. The mantle in question is from a bundle that has several textiles that have innovative features, including color patterns (see Paul 1997:122-123, 142). I know of one explicit embroidered design of four-strand oblique interlacing, in the borders of an EH 10 Ocucaje tunic (King 1965:fig. 65; A. Rowe 1991:fig. 9).</page><page sequence="12">Raul: Protective perimeters 1 55 additional visual references to Paracas basketry rims that have a braided appearance, see Yacovleff and Muelle 1932:figs. 26-27;King 1965:fig. 52). Iconographie precursors in early Paracas material culture Paracas/Topar? culture evolved in certain respects from the distinct yet closely related Paracas culture, and one of their common points is a preoccupation with fabric structure imagery, especially twisted strands and oblique interlacing (Frame 1986:figs. 11-13). Many of the earliest fabrics affiliated with the Paracas textile tradition come from the lower and middle lea Valley (from sites near Callango and Ocucaje), and from other unspecified sites in the same valley. As a group, these are given the style name "Paracas Ocucaje" to distinguish them from other south coast fabrics. In addition, the Cavernas site on the Paracas Peninsula was a repository of some of the oldest known Paracas textiles, identified by the style name "Paracas Cavernas." The total number of extant Paracas Ocucaje-style and Paracas Cavernas-style textiles is considerably less than the number of Paracas Necropolis-style textiles, and they are less extensively published.9 Although I am less familiar with this material than with the fabrics affiliated with Raracas/Topar? culture, some general characteristics can nevertheless be identified. The earliest textiles (EH 8 and 9) often carry explicit images of fabric structures, both in borders and/or in their fields. For instance, one half of an EH 9 Ocucaje mantle has a depiction of a strand twisted back on itself along both side edges (fig. 15).10 Other Figure 13.

Courtesy of the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog?a, Antropolog?a y Historia del Per?. textiles have more abstract depictions of three twisted strands: the top and bottom panels of the EH 9 mantle illustrated in figure 16a have representations of feline like bodies connected by diagonal lines executed in three different colors. The iconography on each of these webs may be a conventionalized image of three twisted strands (fig. 16b), an identification that is based on an 9.1 estimate that worldwide there are at least 1,600 Paracas Necr?polis-style textiles in public and private collections (not counting the plain cloths used as wrappings in the funerary bundles). In contrast, there are published references to roughly 325 Paracas textiles with an lea Valley provenience and approximately 140 said to be from Cavernas; some of these are entire garments and some are small fragments. 10. In addition, the bottom borders on two EH 8 ponchos in a private collection have a design that probably represents three twisted strands, while its side borders have feline images separated by depictions of two twisted strands {Rediscovery of Pre-Columbian Textiles 1994:86). There are also two different EH 8 double cloth fragments that have two twisted strands along their lateral edges and between design bands in their fields (Hughes 1995:pl. 1a, c). Likewise, an Ocucaje border fragment is painted with an image of twisted strands (King 1965:423), and an EH 9 textile fragment has embroidered border images of twisted strands (Sawyer 1997:fig. 15). An EH 9 lea Valley mantle has triple cloth longitudinal borders with images of two twisted strands, in addition to images of twisted strands that demarcate ?mages on the lateral edges of the cloth (Kajitani 1982:pl. 20). One interlocking warp and weft EH 9 tunic has triple cloth side borders with depictions of two twisted strands, as well as ?mages of three twisted strands along the bottom edges and at the shoulder, first described as such by Frame (1986:fig. 11 ); this garment also has a field pattern that derives from the structure of oblique interlacing. Another EH 9 tunic has depictions of twisted strands in its field (ibid., fig. 29).</page><page sequence="13">156 RES 38 AUTUMN 2000 Figure 14.

Images of three strand oblique interlacing are present also on early Paracas weavings: each feline figure on an EH 9 double cloth band is bounded at its top and bottom by an image of a three strand braid (fig. 17), and an EH 9 mantle is patterned with dye-mordant representations of three interlacing strands along its side edges (fig. 18).12 The presence of straightforward depictions of fabric structures on later (EH 10) Paracas Ocucaje and Raracas Cavernas textiles seems to be less common, with certain exceptions (see n. 8). 11. In describing that tapestry, Frame states that "the three strands are defined by a combination of serpent head and crossbar that is consistent with a strand that underlaps and passes behind two others" (1986:50, fig. 16). Other Raracas Ocucaje fabrics that have similar allusions to this fabric structure appear in A. Rowe 1977:fig. 129 and Paul 1999:fig. 3. 12.

Redrawn from original drawing published in Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino 1989:86. Courtesy of the Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino. Of special interest to the present discussion is the fact that many of these images of fabric structures occur either at the edges of garments or in bands that mark the boundaries between design units in a weaving. There also are garments that have actual accessory structures attached to their edges. One, an Ocucaje fragment, has a border that "appears to have been braided, but it now consists mainly of loose threads caught to the edge of the fragment with a whipping stitch" (King 1965:452, fig. 28). Another is a Cavernas tunic with a braid sewn to its sides and bottom edge (Carrion 1931:45, fig. 4g). Finally, the rims of early Raracas basketry also are repositories of this imagery: in describing small bowl shaped twined baskets from Ocucaje, King (1965:259) says that the inside rim of the basket has a braided appearance, while the outer edge of the rim has a corded aspect. Images of fabric structures are not the exclusive iconographie domain of fabrics; they also appear on Early Horizon Paracas ceramics. There are numerous pottery vessels with twisted-strand motifs around their interior or exterior lips and upper walls (fig. 19); in bands around their circumferences, sometimes marking the edge of the design field (Rickenbach 1999:pl. 17); and at boundaries that outline major design units (fig. 20). Whole vessels and shards with this imagery come from sites in the upper, middle, and lower lea Valley and date primarily to epochs 7-9 of the Early Horizon. I am aware of one published example that dates to EH 3 (Menzel, Rowe, and Dawson 1964:pl. 2a); a few pieces date to EH 7 (ibid., figs. 6b, 37c, e, k), and a considerably larger number have been assigned an EH 8 date. There is a moderate-sized EH 9 sample of vessels with fabric structure images, with only a few published pieces dating to EH 10.13 Though much less numerous (at least in the published literature), there are also braided patterns on or near the rims of ceramics. A few EH 8 and 9 bowls have images 13. For illustrations see, among others, DeLeonardis 1997:figs. 6.8c, 7.28b, 7.29a; Lapiner 1976:figs. 188, 192; Massey 1986:figs. 2.2k, 2.3b, 2.3e, 2.6b, 2.7e, and 1991:figs. 8.6g, o; Menzel, Rowe, and Dawson 1964: pi. 8b, figs. 39b, 40d, 43b-1, 47c, 48a, 55d; Museums of the Andes 1981:26; Rickenbach 1999:pls. 6, 35; and Sawyer 1966:figs. 104, 189. Frame (1986:fig. 28) illustrates numerous stylized images, drawn from Raracas pottery, that she believes are derived from twisted strands. She does not give the context of these designs on the ceramic vessels, and hence it is not possible to say which ones may mark the edges or boundaries of design fields.</page><page sequence="16">Raul: Protective perimeters 1 59 Figure 18.

At least two pottery fragments have depictions of both twisted strands and oblique interlacing alternating around the rim (Menzel, Rowe, and Dawson 1964:fig. 45b; Massey 1991: fig. 8.6g). In addition to ceramic containers, there are early Raracas Ocucaje pyroengraved gourds that are decorated with representations of twisted strands in bands around the upper wall or rim (Tello 1959:figs. 32, 34, 36).

All in all, there is a rather striking number and variety of early Paracas artifacts in which twisted or braided strands establish the boundary between the object and what lies beyond. The tenacity through time of this imagery, viewed in the context of its frequent appearance on edges and borders, indicates to me that twisted and interlaced strands?whether in the form of actual fabric structures, in realistic depictions of fabric structures, or in oblique references to fabric structures? were a principal iconographie means of defining limits or separation. Is there any way of understanding why these fabric structures appear in borders and at edges? Iconographie antecedents in Chavin material culture There are Andean antecedents to this iconography of peripheries, in particular on the earliest known textiles from the area of the south coast where Paracas and ParacasATopar? cultures flourished. Chavin-style textiles from the site of Carhua (between the Paracas Peninsula and the lea Valley) hint that images of fabric structures occupied niches similar to those described above. The illustrations in an article by D. Wallace (1991) show painted representations of (1) twisted snakes/strands Figure 21. Ocucaje 8 ceramic bowl, probably from upper lea Valley, EH 8.

These fabric fragments date to Early Horizon epochs 3-7 (circa 700 b.c-300 b.c.). Since the time of their discovery, it has been argued that the Carhua textiles were the type of portable artifact representative of the highland center of Chav?n de Hu?ntar, based on iconographie comparisons (see, for example, Burger 1992, Wallace 1991). Other Chavin style artifacts include goldwork, stonework, and ceramic fineware, and these share with the textiles certain elements of iconography. For instance, a Chav?n gorget of gold, silver, and copper alloy has twisted strands around its outer edge (Burger 1996:pl. 5), two rows of twisted strands frame ?mages of human heads on a gold crown discovered on the summit of Kuntur Wasi ?n the shaft tomb of an elderly elite male (Burger 1992:fig. 226), and a Chongoyape gold ornament may have two twisted strands framing a human head (Lothrop 1941:fig. XXn). Additional artifacts with twisted strands depicted around their rims include a shard of Rocas pottery and a stone vessel, both found at Chav?n de Hu?ntar (Lumbreras 1971 :figs. 9a, 27d). The above items date to the Initial Period (circa 1200-700 b.c.) and Early Horizon (circa 700 b.c.-O). The argument for the symbolic importance of twisted strands within the Chav?n world is bolstered most by their prominence on the Lanz?n, one of the oldest</page><page sequence="18">Paul: Protective perimeters 1 61 Figure 22.

Twisted strands appear at four places on this stone monument, referred to inappropriately as "guilloches" in this otherwise illuminating description14: The guilloche has a long history in the art of Chav?n de Hu?ntar. The main cult object of the Old Temple, known as the Lanz?n, had a long vertical guilloche running down its back from its uppermost section, set into the rafters, to its lowermost section, lodged in the floor. This guilloche seems to visually underscore the role of the Lanz?n as an axis mundi, and it appears as a rope connecting the world above with the underworld. On the same sculpture, three other smaller vertical guilloches appear on the lower section of the Lanz?n, which, along with the main guilloche, seem to mark four cardinal directions, perhaps corresponding to a cosmogram of the world or universe in its horizontal dimension.

Reprinted from Anne Paul, Paracas Art and Architecture: Object and Context in South Coastal Peru (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1991), Courtesy of D. Wallace. The iconographie significance of oblique interlacing in Chav?n iconography, like that of twisted strands, is underscored by a prominent architectural context: a fanged mythical individual on a sculpture placed prominently in the upper register of the Circular Plaza frieze at Chav?n de Hu?ntar has braided hair (fig. 25). Images of three-strand oblique interlacing appear on portable artifacts as well. A gold gorget, probably from Chav?n de Hu?ntar, has a braid around its outer edge (fig. 26). A gold and silver snuff spoon, from the same site, has a figure holding a ceremonial conch-shell trumpet; he sits on a cylindrical stool, the circumference of which is decorated with an ?mage of oblique interlacing (Burger 1996:pl. 3). At Chav?n de Hu?ntar, ?mages of twisted and interlaced strands are associated with hallowed locations, sacred icons, and precious ceremonial artifacts. Could it be that the fabric structures themselves were sacrosanct and that they imparted a spiritual aura to the ?mages and objects on which they appeared?15 If so, they may have been among the Chavin-related iconographie features that were 14. "Guilloche" is more accurately a term for architectural ornamentation that consists of interlacing or twisting bands that curve around circular voids. 15. W. Conklin (1994:358) suggests that textile structures may have been deified by pre-Hispanic weavers.</page><page sequence="19">162 RES 38 AUTUMN 2000 1 igmarn^n Figure 24.

Burger. transmitted to early Paracas material culture via such artifacts as the Carhua textiles. Viewing this component of Chav?n iconography as something sacred raises the possibility that the ubiquitous references to these fabric structures in Paracas borders functioned as markers of sacred space, separating something hallowed (the cloth) from the profane world beyond. Borders and boundaries in the Andes While well aware of the hazards of using modern ethnographic data as a means of understanding the past, I believe that analogies made between cultures that are separated by many centuries can help us think of new ways to look at ancient textiles. In particular, the proposition that borders and their iconography symbolically reinforce the edges of Paracas cloth sounds more plausible when we consider the fact that elsewhere in the Central Andes?far beyond Paracas both geographically and chronologically?there is a preoccupation with establishing boundaries and marking the edges of things. I am unaware of studies that focus specifically on the presence and meaning of borders on pre-Hispanic cloth,16 but there are a number of interesting studies that deal with boundary issues in public performances, activities, and rituals among contemporary Andean people, and on the cloth they produce. A description by D. Arnold of public performances of the way?u in highland Bolivia is particularly intriguing, because it recounts how an element of interlacing defines a boundary within a dance (1992). The public performance of the way?u, a genre of dance and song, is typified above all by its various elements of interlacing and a complex pattern of weaving and braiding techniques. One element of interlacing structures its choreographic movement and is unique to the way?u. It is the characteristic 'plaiting' of arms . . . which links together the chorus of singer-dancers. . . . This interlacing of arms creates an immovable wall of dancers, which lock inside their common embrace the much smaller circle of pinkillirus, the devilish young men playing pinkillu flutes, and the smaller circle of 'chorus-girls/ . . . Any rupture in the wall is quickly repaired. The only occasion when the wall of dancers is broken on purpose is in the very final dispatch of the jira mayku devil-spirits of the dead, when the central core of disguised human devil warrior-musicians is thrust out of the centre of the circle at the place of Takawa, to return to the high hills. Arnold 1992:51, and see fig. 5 What does the circle of interlaced hands here keep /n? Arnold, Yapita, and others (2000:386) compare the 16. L. Crickmay (1997:532) analyzes textile border terminology in sixteenth- and early-seventeenth-century Aymara and Quechua lexicons, demonstrating that each of several groups of terms includes both a masculine element and a feminine element.</page><page sequence="20">Raul: Protective perimeters 1 63 Figure 25.

Burger. entrapment and eventual release of the warrior spirits (jira mayku) to something that occurs during weaving. When Andean women weave, they revive ancestral spirits that are simultaneously dangerous and fertile, and these captive forces are incarnated in warrior spirits that are trapped inside the textile by its borders during the creation of the textile (ibid., pp. 404, 423). According to Arnold (pers. comm. 2000, citing the young weaver Elvira Espejo, who related to Arnold her vision of weaving cloth), what seems to happen is that the jira mayku are made to dance on the warp threads as you weave, and move the sheds up and down, which happens mainly in the rainy season when you weave most. They dance and dance more frenetically as you get near to finishing the weaving, then they escape finally from the cloth. And then you finish the boundaries, to keep them out! Arnold, Yapita, and others (2000:386) conjecture that, in the way?u, the powers of the warrior spirits are trapped Figure 26. Chav?n gold pectoral, EH 7-9, circa 400-200 b.c..

Though direct analogies with the Paracas Necr?polis textiles obviously are not possible, the use of interlaced edges as a means of keeping in potent spirits or keeping out malevolent ones is suggestive of the possible symbolic function of the borders on the ancient fabrics. Another study compares weaving and agricultural activities in Chuki?api, Bolivia, showing how both textiles and fields are converted into living things at the moment when their borders are finished: The verb jaqichasi?a has various meanings here. On one hand, we are talking about the action of 'finishing well the work at the edge of the field' with a hoe. On the other hand, we are talking of the analogous action of 'finishing the border of a textile.' At the completion of both, we are talking equally of transforming them into a person, of giving them life. . . .

These expressions are said when we start a weaving. We say, for example, that converting fabric into a person is difficult/ Arnold and Yapita 1996:378, 38017 Could the borders that are added to a plain weave Paracas Necr?polis textile, too, infuse life into the rectangular webs of cloth whose edges they mark? The same authors draw analogies between the boundaries of fields and the borders of textiles, quoting an informant who says that "this boundary of the field is like the border of the textile. . . . Moreover, the boundary of the field has an important duty during the production process, because it does not let the products escape from the field. It stops them" (Arnold and Yapita 1996:380). Furthermore, "the part of the textile border that we call pulu is the 'boundary landmark' of the field: mujuna. This boundary landmark, or qurpa, is that which does not let anything enter into the field. The boundary marker is very important" (ibid., p. 381). The idea expressed by the Chuki?api informants that the borders of a textile offer some sort of protection to what is inside, that they keep the inner life of the fabric protected from what is outside its edges, seems to be a notion present among other communities of Andean weavers. E. Phipps observes that a subtle striping called lluq'e, effected by employing backward-spun yarn, "is generally confined to the outer edges of cloth" and that "contemporary Andean weavers believe that I'loque [sic for lluq'e] keeps the 'spirit' of the cloth contained" (1996:184). Is it conceivable that the ever-present borders on Paracas Necr?polis garments similarly 17. See also S. Desrosiers (1982:21), who proposes that pre Hispanic weavings should be viewed as living beings; L. Crickmay (1997:545), who describes postconquest Andean textiles as being alive; and D. Arnold (2000), whose essay is a reflection on the nature of Andean textiles as living beings.</page><page sequence="22">Paul: Protective perimeters 1 65 protected the inner field of the cloth from exterior threats and prevented the cloth's soul from leaving? Human bodies dancing, hoed edges of agricultural fields, woven edges of cloth?each of the diverse references to boundaries cited above in some way concerns the use of borders as symbolic markers, protectors, or creators of vital, sometimes sacred, space. While it is not my intention to suggest that the specific uses and meanings of borders, boundaries, and edges present in the examples of contemporary Andean society mentioned here can be used to interpret the iconography of Paracas textile borders, I do contend that there is a pan-Andean conceptual importance attached to these peripheries and that interest in them may extend as far back in time as the Early Horizon. To conclude, I would like to envision for a moment the spectacle of a Paracas/Topar? man attired in some of the embroidered garments described here (fig. 27). An oblique interlaced headband with images of either twisted or interlaced strands embedded in its structure encircled his head several times. The head may also have been covered by a headcloth that either wound around it like a turban or hung down the back of the body. A poncho or tunic enveloped the neck and torso or waist, a loincloth covered the groin, a skirt encircled the pelvic region, and a mantle shrouded the torso. Each of these pieces of clothing carried along its edges either explicit or implicit references to fabric structures that, I suggest, established a protective perimeter around the fabric, "shielding" it from the nonwoven world outside its edges. When draped over, on, and around the human body, the garments may have both provided symbolic protection to the individual who wore them and enclosed and defined a zone of personal sacred space, because the entire body of the wearer would have been enveloped in a cocoon of twisted or braided strands. The insistence with which certain border design features, such as those presented here, endured over nearly three centuries of Raracas/Topar? cloth production points to their importance in a tradition within which cloth was the expressive medium par excellence.
