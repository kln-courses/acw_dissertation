<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hemingway's Barbershop Quintet: The Garden of Eden Manuscript MARK SPILKA At the end of Scott Fitzgerald's Tender is the Night Dick Diver and his wife Ni- cole have gone to the barber's together, as is their custom, to "have haircuts and shampoos in adjoining rooms." As they reach the Carleton Hotel in Cannes, Nicole's lover, Tommy Barban, sights them from a passing car and follows them to the barber shop for a dramatic showdown. Though Dick is half-shaved and Nicole half-shorn when Tommy enters, they agree to talk things out at a nearby cafe. There Tommy holds that the Divers' marriage "has run its course" and demands a divorce for Nicole so the lovers can marry. After a few parries Dick accedes, cuts off further discussion, and, leav- ing the lovers behind, returns to the barber shop to finish his shave. Their talk at the cafe has been twice interrupted, first by an American newspaper vendor heralding the Tour de France with a cartoon clipping of "millions of Americans pouring from liners with bags of gold," next by the commotion of the Tour itself as the cyclists swarm by, all but the confident leader expressionless, indifferent, weary, "endlessly tired." As Fitzgerald's all- too-evident ironies suggest, Dick Diver, the man who loved to be loved, the inventive host for the first American summer guests on Riviera beaches, the indulgent doctor who married his mad client to effect her cure, has finished among the losers with some style. In the previous chapter Dick has characteristically gone to the rescue of an old friend, Mary North, who seems to have been engaged in a proto-lesbian escapade with Lady Caroline Sibley-Biers. Mary and Lady Caroline have dis- guised themselves on a "lark" as sailors on leave and have picked up "two silly girls" who have in turn "got the wind up and made a rotten scene in a lodging house." The police have arrested the larkers, who have then appealed to Dick to bail and bribe them out of jail. His response when he ar- rives and hears their tale is instructive: Dick nodded gravely, looking at the stone floor, like a priest in the confes- sional--he was torn between a tendency to ironic laughter and another tendency to order fifty stripes of the cat and a fortnight of bread and water. The lack, in Lady Caroline's face, of any sense of evil, except the evil wrought by cowardly Provenqal girls and stupid police, confounded him; yet he had long concluded that certain classes of English people lived upon a concentrated essence of the anti-social that, in comparison, reduced the gorgings of New York to something like a child contracting indigestion from ice cream. 1 Tender is the Night, in The Portable F. Scott Fitzgerald, intro. John O'Hara (New York: Viking, 1945), pp. 531-32.

In 1946, when Ernest Hemingway began writing The Garden of Eden, Scott Fitzgerald had been dead for nine years, Rudyard Kipling for ten. Both writ- ers were much on Hemingway's mind as he fashioned what now seems to be his most experimental and easily his most ambitious novel. Fitzgerald's life and work, particularly Tender is the Night, would offer precedents for the trou- bled triangles in Paris and on the Riviera which dominate the main narrative; Kipling's Jungle Books would inspire the African tale of an elephant hunt, the composition of which becomes a dynamic counterpoint to that narrative. Hemingway would measure himself, as always, against expired and admired competitors and try to beat them at their own games; but it would be his game, as always, that mattered. As early as May 28, 1934, Hemingway had written Fitzgerald a predictive letter, complaining about his tragic stance in Tender is the Night, his failure in that novel to use rather than abuse his personal dilemma in caring for his mad wife Zelda: Forget your personal tragedy. We are all bitched from the start and you espe- cially have to be hurt like hell before you can write seriously. But when you get the damned hurt use it--don't cheat with it.... You see, Bo, you're not a tragic character. Neither am I. All we are is writers and what we should do is write. Of all people on earth you needed discipline in your work and in- stead you marry someone who is jealous of your work, wants to com- pete with you and ruins you. It's not as simple as that and I thought Zelda was crazy the first time I met her and you complicated it even more by being in love with her and, of course you're a rummy. But FITZGERALD," as he called it, and probably reread the novel in that edition by 1946, when he began writing Tihe Garden of Eden. Thus, in a retrospective letter to Fitzgerald's biographer, Arthur Mizener, on July 6, 1949, he shrewdly diagnoses John O'Hara's introduction to the edition as being "wrapped in O'Hara's old coonskin coat that he never wore to Yale" (Selected Letters 1917-1961, ed. Carlos Baker [New York: Scribner's, 1981], p. 657). Certainly O'Hara's closing nostalgic note-"And always, without fail, whether I'm going to the Plaza for a haircut or a drink ... I am half prepared to see Scott himself" (p. xix)-must have roused his own more critical memories of Scott's drinks and haircuts, or coincided, at the least, with ruminations about barbershops in his own and Fitzgerald's and perhaps even their common predecessor Ring Lardner's fictions.</page><page sequence="3">MARK SPILKA I HEMINGWAY'S QUINTET 31 you're no more of a rummy than Joyce is and most good writers are.... All you need to do is write truly and not care about what the fate of it is. (Emphasis mine)2 By 1946 the Fitzgerald dilemma, as Hemingway saw it, became the basis for his own novel about artists with mad wives who must learn to stick to their jobs in the face of "tragic" circumstances. But it was the curious late se- quence from Tender is the Night-the "lesbian lark" and the "barbershop showdown"-that seems to have set him off. There were, of course, still other and much more private urgencies. Ac- cording to Jeffrey Meyers, Hemingway's second wife, Pauline Pfeiffer, had become disillusioned with men in the years following their divorce in 1940, and "about 1946 ... [had] turned to her own sex" for love.3 By this time Hemingway had been divorced by his third wife, Martha Gellhorn, for whom he had left Pauline, and had just married his fourth wife, Mary Welsh. His sympathies with Pauline had been reawakened by his rueful experience with the fiercely independent Martha, and perhaps also by his new marriage to a better caretaker, a petite, devoted, and rather boyish woman like Pauline. By 1947 Pauline herself was in Cuba, helping him to cure their ailing son Patrick in Mary's absence, and on such good terms with Mary when she returned as to become her nurse and host in Florida, later that same year, while Mary was recuperating from the flu. The good relations between these wives, as colored by Pauline's emergent lesbianism, and perhaps also by the resumption of androgynous sexual practices with Mary that recalled Pauline, seem to have confirmed and perhaps even shaped his decision to create fic- tional versions of his first and second marriages with Hadley Richardson and Pauline: for in those marriages too good relations with lesbian shadings had seemed to obtain between paired wives, and the hair fetishisms from child- hood (which Pauline especially had exploited) had similarly led to or been bound up with androgynous experiments. His first awareness of such connections seems evident in the fiction written during the early years with Pauline. Thus, late in A Farewell to Arms (1929), ex-Lieutenant Henry describes in oddly suggestive terms his visit to the hair- dresser's in Switzerland where his common-law wife Catherine is having her hair waved: It was exciting to watch and Catherine smiled and talked to me and my voice was a little thick from being excited. The tongs made a pleasant clicking sound and I could see Catherine in three mirrors and it was pleasant and warm in the booth. Then the woman put up Catherine's hair, and Catherine looked in the mirror and changed it a little, taking out and putting in pins; then stood up. "I'm sorry to have taken such a long time." 2 Selected Letters, p. 408. A version of this passage also appears in Arthur Mizener's biography of Fitzgerald, The Far Side of Paradise (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1951), pp. 238-39, which Hemingway received from Mizener in January 1951 and read with mixed feelings (Letters, pp. 716-19). 3 Jeffrey Meyers, Hemingway: A Biography (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1985), p. 346.</page><page sequence="4">32 NOVEL FALL 1987 "Monsieur was very interested. Were you not, monsieur?" the woman smiled. "Yes," I said. We went out and up the street. It was cold and wintry and the wind was blowing. "Oh darling, I love you so," I said.4 The sexual excitement recorded here seems to have been based on Pau- line's early efforts to distinguish herself from Ernest's first wife, Hadley, through tonsorial stylings and seductions. She had apparently sensed a simi- lar excitement in Ernest, a kind of secret identification with her own three- mirrored stylings that she might appropriate for herself, even as Catherine appropriates it, a few pages later in the novel, when she asks Henry to let his hair grow longer while she shortens hers: "Then we'd both be alike. Oh, darling, I want you so much I want to be you too." "You are. We're the same one." "I know it. At night we are." "The nights are grand." "I want us to be all mixed up... " (299-300) The androgynous direction of these early romantic scenes-even their la- tent threat of male unmanning and female manning-now seems clear. What Hemingway had brought to Fitzgerald's novel, what he had pieced together for himself over the years with Pauline and Martha and in the new life with Mary, was his own understanding of why Fitzgerald had put lesbian and ton- sorial fiascos in zany sequence and what he himself might make of such con- junctions out of his own long-nurtured hunches. II Among Fitzgerald scholars the connection between his homosexual anxieties and his writing problems has become a critical commonplace. In a recent con- tribution to this view Angus Collins speculates that certain homosexual se- quences in "The World's Fair," an early version of Tender is the Night, are "projection[s] of vocational insecurity." Fitzgerald's paralyzing fear of "vocational emasculation" had become identified in his mind with gay and lesbian sexuality; he had in effect chosen a homosexual vocation whereby his notoriously "insecure masculinity" had become "related to matters of craft"; and only when he "had mastered any suspicions of himself as emasculate art- ist" could he make significant progress on Tender is the Night: 4 A Farewell to Arms (New York: Scribner's, 1929), pp. 292-93.</page><page sequence="5">MARK SPILKA I HEMINGWAY'S QUINTET 33 Homosexuality therefore defines the circle of his creative difficulties in that he is homosexual both in his moral and artistic commitment and in his proneness to moral collapse: homosexuality can convey to him both his own much greater emasculation (the attenuations of art) and his own capacities for self-abandon- ment (the perils of self-indulgence). The novel is completed only when the sense of apostasy begins to predominate, when Fitzgerald learns that his choice of ca- reer is far less reprehensible than his failure to practice it.5 Here Collins argues that, in writing Tender is the Night (1934), Fitzgerald would break the homosexual circle, resolve his creative difficulties, and so ex- ercise the very discipline that Hemingway had denied him. But as Arthur Mizener notes in The Far Side of Paradise, Hemingway would soon modify his original harsh judgment, and in 1935 would tell Maxwell Perkins of how strange it was that "in retrospect" the novel "gets better and better."6 Mean- while he had correctly identified Fitzgerald's "dangerous self-indulgence," his importation of "feelings about his own decline" into the character of Dick Diver, as a problem he would himself have to face in his own version of the writer's struggle with "tragic" circumstances (238). Thus David Bourne, his chief persona in The Garden of Eden, would make of the act of writing a stoic buffer against such circumstances and would stubbornly resist their debilitat- ing power. He would confront the hazards of androgyny that Fitzgerald (though he had oddly caught their form) had only dimly understood, and would overcome them through courageous masculine artistry. The interesting point in this standoff with Fitzgerald is that Hemingway sensed how lesbianism connects with soldier Tommy Barban's barbarian tri- umph over the Divers' barbershop androgyny-their oddly tonsured har- mony, their symbiotic alliance as Riviera prima donnas. He would give Bar- ban's healthy claims a far less cynical twist in his own view of masculine artistry, and would exploit the Divers' civilized shavings far more deviously than Fitzgerald had imagined. Whether he understood that Abe and Mary North were based upon his boyhood hero, Ring Lardner, and his wife Ellis, or that Fitzgerald's barbershop scene was surely influenced by Lardner's "Haircut" (that famous early narrative model for his own juvenile style), or that Abe and Mary together offer fictional analogues for the Divers' decline and fall-whether or not he understood all this, he decidedly sensed that Mary North's emergent lesbianism after her husband's death was like Pau- line's after her divorce, that it reflected upon Nicole Diver's man-hating pro- pensities, and Pauline's too, and upon Nicole's previous madness, and Zel- da's too, and that of his mistress Jane Mason during the troubled years with 5 Angus P.

In this 1951 biography Mizener had reviewed Hemingway's relations with Fitzgerald, quoted from Hemingway's letters, and opened up slants on Fitzgerald's work and world that seem to have fig- ured in Hemingway's ongoing work on The Garden of Eden. See for example the poem "Do you remember ... That I hated to swim naked from the rocks/While you liked absolutely nothing better?" p. 235, which Hemingway would reverse for David and Catherine; or Zelda's "empty shell" letter, p. 236, which becomes a model for Catherine's farewell letter, in The Garden of Eden. In his correspondence with Mizener Hemingway grudgingly admitted that "your book did tell me many things I did not know.... I learned a lot and I was very grateful." Letters, p. 718.</page><page sequence="6">34 NOVEL FALL 1987 Pauline: for this would be the pith and point of his own adventures into bar- bershop disharmonies in The Garden of Eden with the fictional likes of Pauline, Zelda, Hadley, Jane, even of later loves and wives like Adriana and Miss Mary, perhaps Miss Martha too. More interesting still, he seems to have un- derstood that in all this biographical scramble, androgyny, and not homosex- uality per se, was Fitzgerald's underlying problem as well as his own, many critics of both writers and much patriarchal and even feminist sentiment to the contrary notwithstanding. All of which helps to explain why The Garden of Eden, in its roughly com- pleted manuscript form, is chiefly a novel about haircuts--or about haircuts and the narratives and counter-narratives they inspire. Ring Lardner's talka- tive barber has in this respect little or nothing upon Hemingway's talkative heroines and their emotional investments in hair styles. Indeed, the first chapter of the 1500-page manuscript swings upon newlywed Catherine Bourne's account of her "dangerous" surprise for her husband David, her trip to the barber shop for a boy's haircut like his-an account excised like so much else from the 247 pages of the printed version of the novel issued by Scribner's in May 1986.7 One can understand the excision. The account is not on the surface the "dangerous" adventure that Catherine makes of it as she tells of her fright when the barber holds "everything out to one side" and goes "snip-snip-snip," then does the back and the other side, and explains that she felt confident nonetheless about going on because she had seen him cut Da- vid's hair the week before and had now told him "to cut mine just the same as yours" (Ms. 1/i/insert 18). But the excision of this "little drama" is in fact a violation of the novel's manuscript style, its attempt to get at unsuspected depths through selective descriptions of supposedly insignificant (even silly) actions, its claustrophobic concentration upon the surface details of eating, drinking, swimming, diving, tanning, barbering, bantering, bickering, but above all talking, and below all, writing and making love-a violation, then, of the novel's narrative status as an expansive account of an inner journey, a "sea change" as seen from inside the iceberg, and therefore not an ordinary novel at all, like his own early icebergs, or his recent war epic, For Whom the Bell Tolls, or for that matter, Fitzgerald's Tender is the Night, with its solidly re- alized social context and wide cast of characters-as Hemingway's persona al- most explains ("It's not a novel ... It's an account. Travels and Voyages," Ms. 3/16/27) in one of many excised implications of the author's conscious in- tent. One of the nicer signposts of that inner journey, the Rodin statue from "The Gates of Hell," based on Ovid's Metamorphoses and Baudelaire's Les fleurs du mal, has also been removed from the opening chapter, quite possibly be- cause it ties in directly with the Paris couple, Nick and Barbara Sheldon, whom Scribner's editor, Tom Jenks, decided he must remove along with the 7 The Garden of Eden (New York: Scribner's, 1986), 247 pp., cited hereafter in the text as GE plus page numbers.

Thus, on the evening after her barbershop story, when the newly shorn Catherine asks Da- vid to make love to her as she is, she also asks him in an excised passage if he remembers "the sculpture in the Rodin museum," and with that in mind, if he will now- "try and be good and not think--only feel." A moment later she asks, "Are you changing like in the sculpture? ... Are you trying to?" Then, as his resistance slackens until they cannot tell "who is who," she be- comes even more insistent: "Now will you please be that way now? ... Will you change and be my girl and let me take you? Will you be like you were in the statue? Will you change?" He knew now and it was like the statue. The one there are no photographs of and of which no reproductions are sold. (Ms. 1/1/170) The statue in question, from a group sometimes called "The Damned Wo- men," consists of two lesbians making love, the more active of whom looks (in the bronze version in the museum) like a naked man with a woman's breast plainly visible on his chest as he enfolds a naked woman, but who proves on closer inspection to be a naked woman with a short haircut like Catherine's (see plates). About the lack of photographs and reproductions in the 1920s David may be right; but in 1939 and again in 1953, while Heming- way was writing the novel, a reproduction did appear in a German edition of Rodin's work and others have since become available.8 Still, whatever its ac- cessibility, the important point is that Hemingway chose not to describe it, even as he chose not to describe with any exactness the lovemaking between his sexual seekers after dangerous knowledge. For them as for us, it is the edenic invitation to forbidden mysteries and disturbing sexual ambiguities that matters. As Catherine tells David, she has thought about the statue "Ever since.... that day in the Rodin," and though she doesn't understand why "it works," she knows that it does; and David too not only feels its me- tamorphic powers but admits them to himself while struggling with his con- science: You know the statue moved you and why shouldn't it? Did it not move Rodin? You're damned right it did and why be so holy and so puritanical? You're lucky to have a wife that is a wild animal instead of a domestic animal and what is a sin what you feel bad after and you don't feel bad. (Ms. 1/1/23-24) In Book Two, which consists solely of the excised Paris chapter, we learn more about this "moving" statue, this public inspiration for troubling private changes. Indeed, the book opens with a clumsy overview of its effect on both couples: 8 "The Metamorphoses of Ovid," Rodin Sculptures, Phaidon Edition (London and New York: Allen and Unwin Ltd., Oxford University Press, 1939), plate 62; (London: Phaidon Press Ltd., 1953), plate 52; and in the white plaster version, Rodin Sculptures, ed. Jennifer Hawkins (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1975), plates 10-11; and The Sculpture of Auguste Rodin, ed. John Tancock (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1976), plates 36-1, 36-3. Interestingly, 36-3 is called "Daphnis and Chloe," as if the figures were male and female.</page><page sequence="8">36 NOVEL I FALL 1987 With the other two it had started at the end of February. It had really started long before that but there had been no actual date, as there was for the day in May that Catherine had ridden up to Aigues Mortes and back to Le Grau de Roi [sic], until this night and the following morning at the end of February in Paris. None of them remembered the actual dates of commitment and none of them remembered the dates on which they had first turned in off the rue de Var- ennes to the Hotel Biron with the beautiful gardens and gone into the museum where the changings had started. One girl had forgotten that it had started there and, for her perhaps, it had not but she too had seen the bronze long before. "Let's think of something fun to do that we've never done that will be secret and wicked," the girl had said. (1) Hemingway's revision here of the biblical Garden of Eden plot seems plain enough: two couples pass through the beautiful gardens at the Hotel Biron, enter the Rodin Museum, and are so moved by the statue there of meta- morphic love that they begin their own androgynous experiments; and in each case the "girl" is the active agent, the Eve-like tempter. The editorial loss of this magic matter seems sad enough; but the loss too of the Paris plot with its lively change of pace and its range of useful meanings, is perhaps sadder. We soon learn, for instance, that Nick and Barbara Sheldon are poor but happy artists and therefore healthy foils to the rich unhappy Riviera Bournes. Indeed, they have experienced androgynous love without previous qualms, and as the chapter opens they experience it again, in their cold and barren Paris flat, with Barbara pressing down lightly but firmly upon her supinely cooperative spouse. Thus it is not androgynous love per se that causes trouble ("We've always done that when you wanted to," says Nick on p. 2 in response to his wife's enticement), so much as its public expression through statues, hair styles, and conversations-especially as they convey controlling female power. And even then a thoughtful, cooperative, and sympathetic spouse like Nick can let his hair grow long over a five-month period as a sur- prise present for his wife, without her discovering it, in true O. Henry fash- ion. We witness a second excised barber scene, at any rate, as-after their simple breakfast of brioche, ham and eggs-Barbara shapes Nick's hair to re- semble hers, then shares the excitement of his gift by making more androgy- nous love: "It ruins work," she said, "but it's so exciting. Why should something so simple be so exciting?" "I'm not sure it's so simple." "It's so much fun it must be very wicked." "I'm pretty sure it's wicked." "But Nickie how did you get it so long?" "It took five months." "It must have. But how did you do it?" "Don't you remember when you asked me to?"</page><page sequence="9">MARK SPILKA I HEMINGWAY'S QUINTET 37 "I always asked you to." "Well anyway this time I told the barber I wanted to let it grow because you liked it. The same barber that cuts yours. The Spanish one. He said how long? I said like yours." (12-13) How Nickie did it is indeed a mystery (and perhaps cause in itself for Jenks' editorial clippings), but presumably he combed it back and up rather than out and down, and so hid the change from Barbara. What counts is the liveliness of the telling, the cheerfulness of these loving American babes in foreign woods who "go to sleep like good children" after another crazy day (19, 23), who seem at ease with androgynous changes ("It's just like all the Indian kids were," says Nick on p.15 as if recalling his namesake's life in northern Michigan), and whose inner life seems only mildly troubled with thoughtful moments at night and ebullient stream-of-consciousness wonder- ment. In Book Three of the manuscript, however, when the Sheldons meet the Bournes and Barbara and Catherine respond to each other with erotic inten- sity, the latent danger of "possession" by androgyny is openly acknowledged. Thus, in a confessional passage, Barbara tells David of her troubled feelings about herself: ... I know I'm strange. But I'm not a queer or I never was. Crazy if you like and with special things or one thing that I wanted and got it or have it or had it. It was just a simple delight or ecstasy. It was private but I made it public. That's the danger, the necessary danger. And I didn't know things took posses- sion of you. There's where you've gone wrong of course." (Ms. 3/4/8 bis 1) The "necessary danger" of making things private public-that's where, ac- cording to Barbara, they've all "gone wrong." Their experiments with andro- gynous coiffures-long for the Sheldons, short for the Bournes--are public expressions, then, of private love modes which now possess them, and which ultimately lead to sexual betrayals and beckoning disasters-madness for Catherine, suicide for Barbara, accidental death for Nick, expulsion from Eden for David and his new "girl" Marita. From such impending consequences, moreover, the explicit barbershop scenes acquire their curious resonance. Where David and Catherine are concerned, the Scribner's edition does some justice to this fateful dimension. For them it may be enough that we hear Catherine's account of her Eton haircut in Chapter Five and witness the coiffeur's artistry in Chapter Nine as he bevels and blonds the couple's hair to make them look alike. Catherine's hysteric fear of death, and the meeting with their common mistress Marita, follow hard upon these public expres- sions of androgynous "possession," and after they dye their hair again in an- other elided scene in Chapter Twenty-One they both feel appropriately "damned." Still, the riskiness of art itself-the coiffeur's, David's, Cathe- rine's-is lost by the disconnection of such scenes from the Rodin statue's fa-</page><page sequence="10">38 NOVEL FALL 1987 tality, and from Marita's recognition too (another sad excision) of how well Catherine's artistry in talking matches David's writing skills. And again the editor shears too close, in Chapter Twenty-Nine, where Marita loses her Afri- can haircut and the novel ends without the fateful implications of her impend- ing possession by androgyny. She has by this time shown extraordinary sympathy for David's work, and thereby won his love, and Catherine herself has numbed his loyalty by bum- ing his African stories so as to leave unrivalled his narrative account of their "journey" into androgynous wilds. Marita has become the good wife, then, the one who admires all his writing and shares with him its mystery (another excised dimension). Further, he has rescued her from her purely lesbian past (also excised) and converted her to heterosexual love of the missionary as well as the androgynous order, as if to counteract his own conversion to an- drogyny and his wife's to lesbian love. All the more "dangerous," then, when Marita tells David, at the end, that she wants her hair cut to resemble that of his first girlfriend during his African boyhood. If she in turn has converted him from a sick sense of severe "perversion" to a healthy sense of "variety," the signs of her own Catherine-like obsession with androgyny burgeon in the late chapters-largely excised, alas, along with the complexities of her nature and her alarming African haircut which, as it turns out, makes her look more like a street Arab than a tribal princess. III We are all bitched from the start and you especially have to be hurt like hell be- fore you can write seriously.... Was that "All-American bitch" Grace Hall Hemingway on Ernest's mind when he admonished Scott Fitzgerald with such a grim view of childhood and its painful aftermath? Certainly his mother had twinned him from the start with his older sister Marcelline, dressing them alike in infant smocks and frocks, arranging their hair in matching Dutch-length cuts, holding Mar- celline back a year so they might start school together, and when Ernest re- ceived his first boy's haircut that pre-school summer, giving Marcelline a boy's haircut too. Was Ernest in that sense paired with a bitch from the start, or paired with one bitch by another, as he later saw it? Or was that triangu- lated pairing in fact edenic at first and only gradually too grim and painful to acknowledge? It is at any rate to Marcelline and Ernest, their mother's twin Dutch dollies in infancy, at seven and six her gradeschool gamins, that we must turn for childhood models of the longhaired Sheldons and shorthaired Bournes-even for the painful aftermath of such dangerous stylings. As Mar- celline herself reports, her hair grew out unevenly that fateful summer, after her first boy's haircut, and was further botched in the fall by a helpful scis- sors-wielding playmate. As punishment her mother sent her to school in sis- ter Sunny's baby bonnet until a wise teacher intervened, some two weeks</page><page sequence="11">MARK SPILKA I HEMINGWAY'S QUINTET 39 later, and persuaded Grace to remove the bonnet and let Marcelline escape to the second grade, where she belonged.9 No wonder then that hair styles be- came the observant Ernest's lifelong measure of female manipulations, andro- gynous twinnings, arrangements of the heart and breasts and loins; no won- der that the Bournes in The Garden of Eden see themselves as brother and sister as well as brothers with matching hair styles, or that Pilar sees the cropped Maria and Roberto as brother and sister in For Whom the Bell Tolls, or that Littless cuts her hair short to become Nick's forest brother in "The Last Good Country," or that Catherine Barkley proposes matching hair styles to Lieutenant Frederic Henry in A Farewell to Arms, or that Marie Morgan dyes her hair blond to excite her pirate husband Harry in To Have and Have Not--even as Pauline surprised Ernest by dyeing her hair blond on her thirty- fourth birthday in July 1929, or indeed, even as Ernest first urged his fourth wife Mary to bleach her hair blond, then doused his own hair copper bright, during the composition of The Garden, claiming that he had mistaken the bot- tle for his ex-wife Martha's "old shampoo."10 As his frequent chapter nota- tions-"Hair," "Hair Cutting," "Hair Symbol"-attest, hair was for Heming- way the public expression of his own private obsession with androgyny, his easy imaginative access to a woman's manipulative, talkative, stylistically in- ventive powers, his secret envy of her breasts and womb, his unconfessed desire to rest confident in her supine passivity, and his honest awareness of her oppression by men much like himself. Beyond that he obviously liked women, liked having them around as adoring wives or "daughters": indeed, he desperately needed their attentive presence, and in The Garden of Eden he finally attested to that terrible dependency, as when the betrayed David tells his returning wife Catherine and future mistress Marita, after their first lesbian experiment, "I missed you both" (Ms. 3/21/31). Vulnerability and dependency, then, were the blissful conditions that "hurt like hell" after four serial marriages, and that moved Ernest to write about "the happiness of the Garden that a man must lose."" His ambivalent feel- ings about androgyny had become the very subject of his novelistic search, his three-mirrored account of inner voyages, his condensation of successive marital and extra-marital entrapments, with only his African pennings to pull him through his own Ulyssean weakness for long- and short-haired sirens, his own Samsonian blindness and loss of hairy strength (cf. Ms. 3/25/29). As we shall see, these inner weaknesses are intimately bound up with the hero's writing skills and with the novel's curious construction as an account that could only have been written by David Bourne, whom we constantly observe either in the act of writing something like it or of living what he writes. This is Hemingway's most self-reflexive novel about the art of and need for writing his own kind of "found" and "invented" fictions; and that art is inti- mately bound up with his life and work during all his marriages, but espe- 9 Marcelline Hemingway Sanford, At the Hemingways: A Family Portrait (Boston: Little, Brown, 1962), pp. 109-11. 10 Jeffrey Meyers, Hemingway, pp. 435, 437. 11 Carlos Baker, Ernest Hemingway: A Life Story (New York: Avon, 1969), pp. 583, 891.

One biographical question this novel speaks to, for instance, is what kind of husband and lover was Ernest Hemingway? The complicated an- swer-since Ernest plays all the main male roles, assigning aspects of himself or stages of his life to Nick Sheldon (Paris), David Bourne (the Riviera), An- drew Murray (Spain), and David's unnamed father (Africa)-can be put into simple if painful terms: he was an extremely dependent man in all these roles. As Chapter Seven in the Scribner's edition opens, for instance, the edi- tor excises a long passage from Book Three, Chapter Thirteen, of the manu- script in which David muses over the word "Innocence" on which the previ- ous chapter ends, his friend Andy Murray-a square character who refuses to change his hair style and whose initials point in this respect to Archibald Ma- cLeish and to Hadley's second husband, Paul Mowrer-his friend Andy hav- ing held there that the Bournes bring more saving innocence to the time they're in than he does. Certainly David's musings over their life together are at this point innocent enough, that is to say honest and to the heartfelt point, as he makes "a head for a coin" (p.6) out of his sleeping wife's face, imagin- ing lines and angles like a sculptor, then acknowledging that "She's the sculptor with her lovely head. I see why she likes to do it" (p.7). Then, hav- ing emulated her close-cropped artistry with loving and imaginative care, he reviews his own emotional progress, his new freedom from remorse, his less- ened anxiety about where they're heading and about his continuing failure to write, his concern all the same with the danger of such heady freedom, and with the lack of helpful "signals from the pits" to "tell you where you stand" ("or maybe there are and you can't read them," p.9); and then thinking of their latest experiments- The only signal was she asked you this time and you said yes. And do you still say yes? I said yes and I neither apologize nor explain. You know the danger? All right what would be the danger of No? You don't think it would be greater? How do I know? I didn't say no. You don't think that you will have to learn to say it? Very possibly. (9) The danger of saying no, then, as reviewed by a man who obviously can't say no, or who says it rather so that it always means yes-as both his wife and mistress understand. Thus when David calls her "an intriguing corrupter" after she provides them with a common mistress, Catherine tells him "an old secret": "You aren't very hard to corrupt and you're an awful lot of fun to corrupt" (GE 150). And when she persuades him to dye his hair once more to resemble hers, she says, "I love to make you do things you really and truly don't want to and then you like them when we do them"-at which point David begins to realize "what a completely stupid thing he had permitted" (GE 178). And again, as her illness increases and David becomes "sick of crazy things," she repeats what he also knows: "You always do everything I want because you really want to do it too" (GE 196). Even his</page><page sequence="13">MARK SPILKA I HEMINGWAY'S QUINTET 41 mistress Marita tells him playfully and definitively, late in the novel, that she loves to hear him say no: "It's such a non-definite word the way you say it. It's better than anybody's yes" (Ms 3/45/5); and then, being a better and more protective caretaker than Catherine, she reassures him that she loves his weaknesses as much as his strengths, for "they're what makes the strengths." That seems to be the second self-revelation from Hemingway: that his emo- tional dependency on his wives and mistresses, his androgynous complicity with their several obsessions with hair, skin, dress, gender, and lesbian at- tachments, is what makes for his strength as a creative writer. That crucial ar- gument occurs again and again in the actual manuscript, as when in Book Three, Chapter Twenty-Three, David ponders the division between his life with Catherine and Marita, whom he sorely misses though he knows it is wrong "to want them both," and his creative work: If you live by the senses you will die by them and if you live by your invention and your head you will die by that too. All that is left entire in you is your abil- ity to write and that gets better. You would think it would be destroyed. By everything you have been taught it should. But so far as you corrupt or change, that grows and strengthens. It should not but it has. Is it possible that the only creation that is a moral act is pro-creation and that is why all other kinds are suspect? It could be but it seems too simple and too much like a justifying. All you know is that you have written better, clearer and plus net, he used the French phrase in thinking, as you have deteriorated morally. But that could be temporary or it could be a building up and strengthening by what good there is trying to build against the destruction. That could be. Don't apportion blame for the destruction now. It will all be apportioned in due time and not by you. (9) Scribner's editor elides this passage, and all others like it, and appropriates only the ending as it applies to David's newly triangulated love (GE 132); but in the actual manuscript it is the entanglement of the menage a trois with the writing process that matters, the complicity in "corruption" that increases cre- ative strength. Thus in Book Three, Chapter Twenty-Seven of the manuscript, when Marita tells David that he writes now in his own defense "and under impossible conditions," David thinks that "maybe the impossible conditions make it [possible for him to write]" (12); and again in Book Three, Chapter Twenty-Nine of the manuscript, as he thinks about another African story, he speculates on the probable androgynous sources-whether disastrous or en- abling-of his new effectiveness: It is going to be rough to do but so far they have gon'e well and maybe you can thank Catherine and her disasters for them. Not her disasters, her disaster that embraces everything. You can thank the other girl who loves you and handles and canalizes you like an engineer or tries to when you don't impede her. You probably would have blown up with Catherine here alone.... But would any of it have happened if you'd been alone? Of course it would. It had built steadily to</page><page sequence="14">42 NOVEL IFALL 1987 happen. Don't go into that now. That is as useless to go into as to think what would have happened if you and Kibo had not learned to hunt at night with the full moon. How wrong that was to do. If life was only conducted for survival ... how much you would have missed. What happened with Catherine goes in the narrative. Don't confuse things. (10-11) The extension of the fateful principle to his African boyhood, and the imagination of his own passivity in the hands of the two women he loves, are instructively alike. He understands his complicity in the events of the "found" narrative we read-the one Catherine has asked him to write about their life together-and in the boyhood events of the counter-narrative, the African tales he "invents" for himself. That it is David's mirrored narrative we read in either case becomes strikingly evident in Book Three, Chapter Three, of the original manuscript, in which David and Catherine run into the Shel- dons at Hendaye and David starts to write about events in their lives that we have already witnessed in Book Two, the Paris chapter: He had started to write about the Sheldons, taking it up when he had seen them in the bistrot [sic] together at dinner on a cold night in Paris at the end of last February and how excited and happy they had looked and how absorbed they had been in each other. He put down how Barbara had smiled at him as though he were a co-conspirator and he remembered being in the coiffeur's when they had come in together. It had gone simply and easily. So easily that it was probably deceptive and that, having seen them only the day before, he saw them so vividly himself that he might not be making them come alive to some one else. But as he read it over it seemed to be what he had tried to get in its complex simplicity and he thought that perhaps he was writing so easily because, not having tried to force any writing before, he was coming fresh to it now. If it is worthless, he thought, it will be good five finger exercises to get started with. God knows I do not have to write about them nor the length at which they choose to wear their hair while living in the Vth arrondisement [sic] in Paris. That's banal enough. Certainly I am not limited to that as a subject and what importance has it? He is a painter and a damned good painter and what difference does it make, any of it. (1) The effect of this passage is startlingly reflexive, perhaps because it is more detailed than the similar moments when David indicates how he writes about himself and Catherine, but more probably because it involves other characters whose lives he must invent from the few events he has witnessed-and that five finger exercise in complex simplicity, as he calls it, is not a bad descrip- tion of the Paris chapter and its lively change of pace, its bed and brioche harmonies. B3ut the point is that David fuses at such moments with his own creator, Ernest Hemingway; he becomes an aspect of his creator's life and work in the way Stephen Dedalus figures as the young artist who will even- tually write Ulysses and A Portrait of the Artist, only now our portrait is of the</page><page sequence="15">MARK SPILKA I HEMINGWAY'S QUINTET 43 artist as a young newlywed on a disastrously overextended honeymoon, and that too is not a bad description of Hemingway's life with Pauline, or with his later wives, once the purifying poverty and cultural richness of the Paris years with Hadley were over. As with Joyce, at any rate, the invitation to read the novel, or the account of inner journeys, biographically is a built-in aspect of the text. And in that light the connection between androgynous "corruptions" with wives and mistresses and the author's writing strengths becomes a matter of critical speculation and concern. Whether in the printed or manuscript version, that connection is conveyed by the two kinds of narrative David writes, the main narrative on which Catherine wants him to concentrate, and for which she tries to find illustra- tors like Picasso, Marie Laurencin, and Nick Sheldon, and the African tales that she resents so much she ultimately burns them. One can see, from the tension between these narrative impulses, why the Sheldon subplot remains unfinished in the manuscript, only sketchily continued in three later frag- ments called "Andy's Story," and why Scribner's editor decided to scrap it: for how could David continue to speak for the Sheldons, in his ongoing ac- count of his own triangulated troubles, without altogether becoming Ernest Hemingway? It was a problem in point-of-view narration that Hemingway himself could not altogether solve, as his decision to let Andy Murray solve it suggests. What Andy tells us about Nick's accidental death while Barbara and Andy make love, and about Barbara's eventual suicide while under Andy's care, David could not have witnessed, and therefore could not reinvent as a plausibly imagined part of the main narrative, an integrated part of his own ongoing quarrel with androgyny. And the alternative device of a story within the story-the old Fielding strategy-must have seemed a bit too tired to pur- sue. So the later Sheldon story was left in fragments and could not be sal- vaged by Scribner's editor without connecting links of his own invention. Nor could he answer for himself the questions David initially raises about the sub- plot-"what importance has it? ... and what difference does it make, any of it?" A great deal, of course, for Hemingway scholars, or for any biographical critic with half an eye for literary dynamics. For plainly the Sheldon subplot was Hemingway's substitute for the missing link in David and Catherine Bourne's life history: David's previous marriage to another woman, someone like Barbara Sheldon, whom he had betrayed at Catherine's urging in order to marry Catherine herself. David Bourne-whose very name suggests (among other things) that hidden burden?2-was instead created "innocent," that is to say previously unmarried and therefore free of Hemingway's guilt in leav- ing Hadley for Pauline, again at Pauline's manipulative urging ("You aren't 12 The name Bourne contains "born," "burn," "borne," and "bourn" as its obvious implied meanings, with borne suggesting either bearing burdens or being carried along passively. Hemingway himself plays with the second and fourth meanings late in the novel, as David and Marita find relief in verbal banter from the burning of the African tales: "Who burned the Bournes out? Crazy woman burned out the Bournes," says David, and then decides "I'll write in the sand.... That's my new medium. I'm going to be a sand writer. The David Bournes, sand writers, announce their unsuccessful peek into that undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveller returns who hasn't been there. That's from a poem Shakespeare and I wrote together. He was extremely talented and Duff Cooper believes he was a sergeant.... It's a very convincing theory" (Ms. 3/44/24-25).</page><page sequence="16">44 NOVEL FALL 1987 very hard to corrupt"). And Catherine too was created free of Pauline's previ- ous manipulations. The "innocent" Bournes, then, who just happen to begin their honeymoon year at Grau du Roi, as did Ernest and Pauline Hemingway in 1927, are juxtaposed with another happily married pair of "innocent" Americans, painters Nick and Barbara Sheldon, who just happen to live in Paris in the manner of Ernest and Hadley Hemingway, circa 1925. And these fictional versions of Hemingway's second and first marriages just happen to cross paths at Hendaye Plage, in the south of France, before going their sepa- rate ways! Hemingway's pleasure in creating such conjunctions seems evident enough, as when Barbara Sheldon smiles at David Bourne in that Paris res- taurant in February "as though he were a co-conspirator" (Ms. 3/3/1); or when Barbara and Catherine regard each other with mutual admiration and desire, upon meeting at Hendaye (Ms. 3/1/2-3), or wish each other well, upon part- ing, and Barbara says, "Have ... a lovely life, and take good care of David" (Ms. 3/8/4); or similarly when Barbara advises David to get Catherine out of the Riviera ambiance if he loves her (Ms. 3/5/7). These moments are not sur- prising, given Ernest's continuing use of Hadley, long after their divorce, as friendly adviser and admired first-married love, and given also her relieved and friendly transfer of Ernest into Pauline's hands, as those of a better, richer caretaker, back in 1926. But the insistence upon the mutual lesbian at- traction between Barbara and Catherine, or Hadley and Pauline, is indeed surprising. We know from recent biographical diggings that Hadley left Bryn Mawr because of her mother's grim suspicions of her roommate's overly fond mother, Mrs. Rapallo, whom she naively admired.13 We know that Pauline's sister was a lesbian, and that Pauline became one after her divorce from Er- nest; and we know from the Hadley tapes preserved by her biographer that Pauline liked to crawl into bed with Ernest and Hadley in the mornings dur- ing her visits with them at Schruns and Juan-les-Pins.14 We know also that Ernest was obsessed with lesbianism, that he considered his mother "androgynous"-probably because of the newly discovered incident in the summer of 1919 when his father banned from the house for unspecified rea- sons his mother's adopted protege and "girlfriend," the young and pretty family helper Ruth Arnold, and because of Ruth's return in later years as his mother's paid companion.15 And, finally, we know he was sexually drawn to Gertrude Stein as to a literary version of his "androgynous" mother during the Paris years with Hadley.16 From all of which we may surmise, more broadly, that Ernest was drawn to women with lesbian and/or androgynous propensities, as with Hadley, Pauline, Gertrude, and Mary, and perhaps also 13 Peter Griffin, Along with Youth: Hemingway, the Early Years (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985), pp. 142-43, 184-85; Jeffrey Meyers, Hemingway, pp. 58, 346. 14 According to Peter Griffin, in private conversation, October 1986, on the tapes taken by Emily Hahn.

In this light the lesbian link between Barbara and Catherine is itself the missing link in the Bourne's life history, the sanctioning of real betrayal by fictional admiration and desire-as if Ernest had simply acted out the desires of Pauline and Hadley in leaving one wife for another. "Do you have the faintest idea how beautiful you are and what you are doing to people?" asks Barbara/Hadley of Catherine/Pauline upon seeing her latest haircut (Ms. 3/7/3). What she has already done to David/Ernest is thus blessed, forgiven, exonerated, if not altogether explained. One possible explanation-that Ernest identified with supposedly lesbian lovers, or projected his own androgynous feelings upon them-must wait till we discuss the menage a trois between Catherine, David, and Marita-whose very name compresses those hitherto missing wives, Martha and Mary, into verbal complicity with these strange arrangements. IV Meanwhile there is the counter-impulse to consider, the Kipling impulse, the writing of the African tales. Just before his honeymoon with Pauline Ernest had put together a collection of stories called Men Without Women from which he said "'the softening feminine influence' was missing ... whether as a re- sult of 'training, discipline, death, or other causes."'17 While at Grau du Roi with Pauline he had then completed two new stories for the collection, one about Nick Adams' boyhood called "Ten Indians," the other-called "Hills Like White Elephants"-about an insensitive man who tries to persuade his lover to have an abortion. The African tales that David Bourne composes on the Riviera are invented boyhood stories like those that Hemingway wrote about Nick Adams in northern Michigan, and David's disillusionment with his father in the crucial elephant tale is like Nick's disillusionment with Dr. Adams in tales like "Indian Camp," "The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife," "Ten Indians," and much later, "Fathers and Sons." The lovely metaphor of "hills like white elephants," which the woman faced with abortion voices as the second story opens, suggests also the violation of the sacredness of life that young David witnesses in the elephant hunt; but that mystery and that sacredness derive as well from Kipling tales like "Toomai and the Elephants" and "The White Seal" from The Second Jungle Book, "My Lord the Elephant" from Many Inventions, and "Letting in the Jungle" and other Mowgli stories from The Jungle Book itself.'" Indeed, Hemingway's favorite poem from The 17 A Life Story, p. 234; Letters, p. 245. 18 Hemingway read Kipling in boyhood and later owned all these works, but "The White Seal" reference requires some ex- planation. In Book Three, Chapter Forty-Four, Marita and David see each other as seals in the water or on the beach (pp. 13-14). When Marita asks "Are seals nice?" David replies: "Did you read the Naulahka by Kipling? ... That's all I know about them except in arctic and antarctic chronicles and circuses and zoos" (p. 14). Hemingway's mistake is interesting: there are no seals in The Naulahka: A Story of East and West, the action of which takes place in India and the American West; but its plot-the persuasion of an American woman to give up her independence, her mission work in India, for mar- riage-is decidedly relevant to Marita's voluntary status as an adjunct wife in The Garden of Eden. The Kipling work that Hemingway misremembers here is "The White Seal" in The Second Jungle Book, about the search by a white seal for a safe haven for his much-hunted species-hence Marita's remark in the chapter: "When he kissed me he looked like a white-</page><page sequence="18">46 NOVEL FALL 1987 Jungle Book-the animals' lament when Mowgli leaves the jungle to get mar- ried-is a childhood paradigm of the tension in this late novel between the "marriage" story on the Riviera and the boyhood tale of men without women in Africa; and the writing of the latter tale is an act of manly resistance to the "corruptions" of the androgynous married life which apparently make it pos- sible. For unlike Fitzgerald's Dick Diver, who accedes to his own corruption through triangulated love, David Bourne resists his complicity in things femi- nine by writing manly tales about African wars and hunting expeditions. His preoccupation with African stories is like Hemingway's preoccupation with such stories in the 1930s, or with sporting tales about bullfighting, skiing, boxing, and fishing in the 1920s; and his oscillation between such stories and the main narrative is like Hemingway's oscillation between novels of failed sexual relations (The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms) and tales of stoic male endurance; indeed, it constitutes a curious paradigm, a defensive rationale for the manly author's creative history and its apparent source in reactive strength, in self-defining resistance to his own androgynous propensities, his own failed or failing marital and/or extra-marital relations. The long unhappy strenuous playboy life of Ernest Hemingway becomes more devious and more valiant than we have supposed, given this resistive creative strength and its frank location in his own androgynous weakness, his own dependency and openness to the manipulations of many wives and mistresses whom he des- perately needs, and with whom he secretly identifies. E.L. Doctorow's puzzlement over the hero's curious passivity, in his re- view of the published novel, is in, this light relevant to our understanding of the manuscript version and the life behind it.19 Doctorow locates "the ulti- mate deadness of the [published] piece" in David's character: "His incapability in dealing with the crisis of his relationship does not mesh with his consummate self-assurance in handling the waiters, maids and hoteliers who, in this book as in Hemingway's others, come forward to supply the food and drink, the corkscrew, and ice cubes and beds and fishing rods his young American colonists require." Doctorow goes on to mock this evidence of travel writing for provincial American readers, the lack of any substantial disaster like war or postwar disorientation to lend plausibility to the charac- ters' suffering, the consequent "tone of solemn self-attention" which rises to unjustified "portentousness" over 70,000 words of text. But then he also spec- ulates about the missing 130,000 words, the excised subplot, the clear evi- dence of Hemingway's attempt to transcend the limitations of his famous pared down early style, and to remake himself on a grand scale after recog- nizing the stylistic insufficiencies of his previous epic venture, For Whom the Bell Tolls. This seems to me exactly right, though Doctorow's further guesses about "a large cast and perhaps multiple points of view" in the actual manu- script lead us toward his kind of ambitious fiction rather than Hemingway's. But the exciting evidence of Hemingway's attempted new development as a headed seal" (p. 13). 19 E.L. Doctorow, "Braver Than We Thought," The New York Times Book Review, May 18, 1986, pp. 1, 44-45.</page><page sequence="19">MARK SPILKA I HEMINGWAY'S QUINTET 47 writer is decidedly there; and Doctorow is again right to dismiss his failure in this regard, and the novel's failure also, as beside the point. What matters is "that he would have tried, which is the true bravery of a writer, requiring more courage than facing down an elephant charge with a .303 Mann- licher. ,20 That is indeed the point. The Garden of Eden is a novel about a writer's bravery-about Hemingway's bravery as he saw it in the daily struggle to transcend his own terrible dependencies and passivities. This is Hemingway's testament to the writer's trade as he practiced it, using his own hurts and weaknesses, his being five times bitched from the start, and then four and more times bitched again, by his own need to compete with women on hon- eymoon grounds, and to redefine himself therefrom by resistant actions and resistant writings, whether of found or invented fictions. The traveller's daily record of meals, bars, beaches, beds, and barbershops is there because that is how he chiefly lived, under "the softening feminine influence" of married love that he sorely needed to exist at all; and his bravery consists mainly of stripping away his daily portion of manly sports (save one marvellous fishing scene and much androgynous swimming), and of collapsing the essential iso- lation of his post-Hadley marriages into a single honeymoon year of touring, tanning, eating, drinking, and making androgynous love-as if to force the lonely essence of the writer's inner life into felt existence for us, while at the same time indicating, indeed demonstrating, the power, range, and varied richness of his writing. The most direct demonstration comes from the tale of the elephant hunt, the writing and reconstruction of which (after Catherine burns the African tales) constitute the writer David's comeback, his triumph over those "tragic" circumstances to which Fitzgerald supposedly succumbs in Tender is the Night-or at least Dick Diver does. Lacking the revelations about art and an- drogyny in the actual manuscript, Doctorow suggests that Hemingway might have succumbed in a different way: David Bourne's passivity goes unexamined by the author, except as it may be a function of his profession. But the sad truth is that his writing, which we see in the elephant story, does not exonerate him: it is bad Hemingway, a threadbare working of the theme of a boy's initiation rites that suggests to its own great dis- advantage Faulkner's story on the same theme, "The Bear."21 Hemingway would have hated that last comparison, especially with regard to the one novel wherein he tries courageously to do new things, as Faulkner once said he never did; but there is a bit of "The Bear" in this initiation story, and some Sherwood Anderson too, and a great deal of Kipling, about whom Doctorow fails to speculate. Moreover, other reviewers-notably John Up- dike-found the elephant tale engaging.22 Certainly it is a new kind of ani- 20 Doctorow, p. 45. 21 Doctorow, p. 45.</page><page sequence="20">48 NOVEL IFALL 1987 mal story for Hemingway, who prided himself on avoiding sentimental iden- tifications with animals as in the Mowgli stories, but who here unashamedly allows his young protagonist to find in the elephant a hero and brother, to re- sist and resent his killing (though he has himself enabled it by discovering the elephant at night while hunting with his African dog Kibo), and to react to the elephant's feelings as to human feelings. At stake here is the alliance between children and animals that Kipling as- sumes in the Mowgli stories, the assumption of common ground as subhu- man, prehuman, or demonic species, and the acquisition of animal power and mystery in the vengeful struggle against adult inequities, as when Mowgli directs the elephants to trample down the native village in "Letting in the Jungle," or when Toomai rides his musty elephant far into the jungle at night to watch the wild elephants dance, and returns from the forbidden ground to tell his tale in triumph. Hemingway tries to temper and improve on such assumptions through his characteristic theme of disillusionment; and in fact the alliance between the boy and the dying elephant does improve on Kipling, and on Faulkner too, in that it aligns the killing of such jungle mon- archs not simply with the breakdown in trust between boy and man, father and son, but also between male friends. For the odd anthropomorphic point of the tale is that the old, tired, great-tusked elephant had been visiting the grave of a friend whom David's father and the native hunter Juma had killed the previous year, so that David thinks of the latter pair as "the god damned friend killers" (GE 198) and relishes the elephant's revenge when he throws Juma aside-as if recognizing his friend's killer-while charging off to his death, leaving David with "the beginning of the knowledge of loneliness" (GE 201) as recalls the lapse of "dignity and majesty and ... beauty" from the dy- ing beast's sad eyes (200). "It was a very young boy's story," thinks David as he finishes it (GE 201), thus underscoring the Kipling connection. Given its placement as the "hard story" David has wanted for a long time to write, it seems to me also a very self-critical story, in that David's father is more obviously based on Heming- way himself as a hardened big game hunter and an insensitive father to three sons, than on his own father; and yet Hemingway's lifelong problem with male friendships does seem to be attributed here to his father's "friend-killing" role. Was the elephant's death, and the boy's reaction to it, a kind of breakthrough then of boyhood resentment against Dr. Clarence Hem- ingway for teaching his son how to kill rather than love, how to suppress rather than share his deepest feelings? If so, it provides some balance to the indictment here of Grace's androgynous ways, and indicates-perhaps for the first and only time-how much he felt his father-an obtusely sentimental if not a ruthless man-had failed to teach him how to be a friend. And perhaps also how much that hurtful failing had helped to shape his early stoic style. As David puts it in the tale, "I'm going to keep everything a secret al- 22 John Updike, "The Sinister Sex," The New Yorker, June 30, 1986, pp. 85-88.

V Interestingly, it is Catherine rather than David Bourne who invests the Kipling connection with its largest meaning. Early in the manuscript Cathe- rine and David meet Andy Murray in Spain and begin talking about things literary and artistic. Catherine has been reading Proust and James and visiting the Prado, trying to get outside herself by talking about her new interests, priding herself all the same on being "really sensational ... in the practical not the scandalous meaning" in the world she has made up with David, when suddenly she poses an unusual question: "... Andy do you believe it about women for breeding, boys for pleasure, and melons for delight?" "I only eat them." "'But isn't it a lovely proverb even if it isn't true?" "It's an outspoken proverb." "I always thought of it as everything Kipling left out," Catherine said. "Imagine how he would have been with all that in. Sometimes it's almost there but then it moves away. He knew it for a while and then he was ashamed of it. That's what I want David not to leave out." "What if the proverb isn't true?" "It must have been for someone. Or maybe it was a joke. But who it was true for ought to be in or who it was a true joke to. Anyway things you don't ap- prove of you should understand. There's nothing worse than people that are for things they can't help than people that are against them. I hate professional fors and againsts." "Let's eat the melon," David said. "It's delicious," Catherine said. "Even better than the one we had for break- fast." "It's sensational," Andy said. "In the finest sense. I'd like to have known Catherine when she was being sensational." "It was only four weeks ago," Catherine said. "I think maybe I will be again." "This afternoon?" David said. "Yes. Why not?" (Ms. 3/9/14-15) Why not indeed? From Catherine's point of view the improvement on Kip- ling is to include "sensational" things we need to understand, like the Greek credo whereby boys rather than women have priority on the pleasure scale. Her kind of amoral hedonism differs, however, from the Greek example (and from the "Greco-Roman household code" it epitomizes) in that women like herself, having bypassed breeding or sprung their biosocial bonds, now deter- mine the priorities. It is Catherine, not David, who "makes all the surprises"</page><page sequence="24">50 NOVELI FALL 1987 (Ms. 3/13/6), invents all the "dangerous" games, determines all the androgy- nous risks. Her appeal for David and Andy, both delighted by her artful talk, seems evident enough as this chapter ends. Indeed, as E. L. Doctorow points out, she is the novel's great surprise, the improvement by Hemingway on Hemingway himself as he takes his daring new direction: The story is told from David Bourne's masculine point of view, in the inti- mate or pseudo-third person Hemingway preferred, but its major achievement is Catherine Bourne. There has not before been a female character who so dominates a Hemingway narrative. Catherine in fact may be the most impressive of any woman character in Hemingway's work, more substantive and dimensional than Pilar in "For Whom the Bell Tolls," or Brett Ashley in "The Sun Also Rises." Even though she is launched from the naive premise that sexual fantasizing is a form of madness, she takes on the stature of the self-tortured Faustian, and is portrayed as a brilliant woman trapped into a vicarious participation in someone else's creativity. She represents the most informed and delicate reading Heming- way has given to any woman. For Catherine Bourne alone this book will be read avidly....23 Catherine's dominant role, as Doctorow rightly defines it, recalls that of an- other dominant Catherine, in Wuthering Heights, who lent her name, her an- drogynous outlook and her addled nature, first to Catherine Barkley in A Farewell to Arms, slightly dotty from the war's abrasions, and now to postwar Catherine Bourne. The latter's madness is not fairly defined, however, by sex- ual fantasizing, as Doctorow concludes from limited evidence, but rather by the new freedom to pursue to excess, to be possessed or "spooked" by, for- bidden pleasure in the Riviera atmosphere of changing styles and fashions and amoral upheaval; and the "evil" for these innocent Americans, these pio- neers in new delights, is precisely this maddening and rather spectral posses- sion. We see it in Barbara Sheldon as well as Catherine, both roused by the Rodin statue's mysterious appeal, and by such other foreign stimulants as ab- sinthe (which is supposedly "not good for girls" and makes them act strangely, Ms. 3/1/5), suggestive paintings by Marie Laurencin and others, and accessible partners like Marita and Andy Murray. "And don't you try to tell me when pleasure good lovely pleasure turns into vice because I know," says Barbara Sheldon to David Bourne at Hendaye (Ms. 3/7/8 bis 2). The conversion of innocent pleasure into avid vice, and the definition of vice by its maddening avidity, are shared assumptions among these postwar characters, as when David lovingly calls Catherine his corrupt- ing "Devil," or when each suffers a different form of remorse, he from andro- gynous practices, she from lesbian betrayal of their love; and yet these suffer- ing innocents also struggle to free forbidden practices from lingering taboos, and from time to time succeed, as when Catherine calls for understanding or when Marita later insists upon the difference between "variety" and 23 Doctorow, pp. 44-45.</page><page sequence="25">MARK SPILKA I HEMINGWAY'S QUINTET 51 "perversion." More skeptical than Fitzgerald about such innocence, Heming- way could also be more generous about its minimally effective presence, and more precise in defining it. It was the line between evil and madness that he most often blurred, perhaps because it "spooked" him as much as it seems to have "spooked" his haunted characters. But whatever the spectral mix of saving innocence and corrupting madness within her, Catherine is decidedly Hemingway's "most informed and delicate reading" of a woman character, as Doctorow holds. An amalgam of many women in Hemingway's life, she most obviously combines Pauline's posses- sive and controlling use of money, Mary's resentment of her own infertility and perhaps also of her gender, Zelda's artistic rivalry with Scott and her ulti- mately vengeful hostility, and Jane Mason's suicidal recklessness and emo- tional instability. Like Hadley, who once lost a suitcase containing her hus- band's early manuscripts, and who may have resented them, as Jeffrey Meyers asserts, for keeping her and Ernest apart, Catherine is jealous and re- sentful of David's African tales; and like Zelda, who once set fire to their bed- room while visiting Scott from the asylum, she rips in half and eventually burns the offending notebooks.24 Pauline too may have had cause to resent such African stories, given the open portrait of Jane Mason in "The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber" and of a rich wife like herself in "The Snows of Kilimanjaro"; but she was on most occasions, and by his own ad- mission, Hemingway's best and most trusted literary adviser. In inventing Catherine he therefore seems to have wedded Pauline's wit, intelligence, and style with Zelda's open and Hadley's covert resentment of their husbands' writings, and to have drawn her madness out of his own entry, whether real or imagined, into lesbian triangles after the remorseful gardens of androgyny. In any case, Catherine is the androgynous lesbian muse within himself against whom her husband David reconstructs his boyhood world of "men without women," for whom he writes the main narrative, and through whom he goes beyond Kipling in either direction. She is also, like Pauline, an extraordinary conversationalist. If, as Marita later argues, writing is David's "master" and therefore hers ("we are its ser- vants," Ms. 3/33/28), so too with Catherine's speech: "she tells things in the same way you have to write them probably. Maybe that's her master. You know how well she can tell something" (Ms. 3/33/28). And indeed he does, or at least Hemingway does, as the Kipling/proverb passage briefly attests. There and elsewhere we see Hemingway's delight in capturing Pauline/Cathe- rine's talent for talk, and the goodnatured repartee that apparently went with it. Such talk is everywhere evident in this dialogic manuscript, in which tag- lines like "sensation" recur with grace and delicacy at breaks and chapter ends. Hemingway's chapter-head notations, which mention "Talk," "Conversation" (five times), "Good Conversation" (twice), and "Verbal Fights," identify and confirm this aspect of the text, much of it ruthlessly ex- purgated by an editor who misses his expansive intention, or misconstrues it 24 Meyers, p. 70; Mizener, p. 230.</page><page sequence="26">52 NOVEL FALL 1987 as uncontrolled verbiage which Hemingway himself would have lopped off in his prime, in keeping with his iceberg principle, as no doubt he would. But the experiment with expansive conversation was, more plausibly, a crucial part of his ambitious attempt to remake his style, or as Doctorow says, to re- make himself, if only to accommodate the late emergence of the feminine in his makeup. Thus he tries to render for us the oscillating movement between "good conversation" and "verbal fights" as he had experienced it with four wives and several mistresses, but especially with Pauline, and to convey thereby that portrait of the "self-tortured Faustian," the "brilliant woman trapped into a vicarious participation in someone else's creativity," which Doctorow so nicely delineates. But of course it is not only the self-tortured woman who concerns him: he wants also to portray his own complicity, his own domestication, his andro- gynous participation in dialogic delights and entrapments against which he too can reconstruct his manly writer's world. And beyond that there is obviously a certain pride, as of a writer who has isolated himself from his kind, who has left the enriching Paris life with Gertrude Stein, Ford Madox Ford, Sylvia Beach, James Joyce, Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound and others for the honey- moon worlds of Cuba, Florida, Africa, Montana, even Spain, with only wives and sporting friends for company. One of the claustrophobic measures of this text, accordingly, is the smallness of its cast, the expansion of David and Catherine's world by one major character-Marita; and by limited contacts with only eight minor characters-Nick and Barbara Sheldon, Andy Murray, Colonel John Boyle, the hotelier's wife, Madame Aurol, Monsieur Jean the barber, Andre the waiter, and Marita's girlfriend Nina. Thus conversations between David, Catherine, and Marita, together or in pairs, are the main substance of the text, abetted in the manuscript version by stream-of-con- sciousness passages for two women characters (Barbara and Marita) and for David Bourne, of which only David's survives in the printed version. The elimination of Marita's as well as Barbara's soliloquies is understand- able-they are poorly imagined, badly written versions of Molly Bloom's me- anderings in Joyce's Ulysses; but the very attempt by David/Hemingway to think himself into women's inner worlds is cause for wonder. Hemingway's only previous attempt of this kind-Marie Morgan's painful musings in To Have and Have Not (1937) when her husband dies-again points to the influ- ence of Pauline on his own understanding of what a woman is-or suffers. Catherine's sufferings, as captured in dialogic form, are surely the triumph of this novel, as Doctorow argues. From the opening scene in which the whole village cheers as David catches a sea bass in the local canal, to the part- ing letter in which she likens the burning of the African stories to hitting a child with a car with "the crowd gathering to scream" ("The Frenchwoman screaming 6crasseuse even if it was the child's fault," GE 237), Catherine has been desperately competing with David, trying to assert some comparable form of creativity and self-importance through lookalike fashions (tanning, hair styles, fisherman's shirts and shorts and pants); quarreling with him over</page><page sequence="27">MARK SPILKA I HEMINGWAY'S QUINTET 53 publisher's clippings of reviews of his book which threaten her hegemony; in- sulting his childlike handwriting in the notebooks and his poor command of French; improving herself through Proust and the Prado and a Spanish gram- mar; setting him the task of writing about their life together, and then (in a marvellously recreated scene, Ms. 3/38/2-5) seeking out Picasso to illustrate that private book; buying David's time and work thereby with her money; and above all imposing her androgynous and lesbian needs upon him, as if taking over his creative male persona. Indeed, both David and Catherine con- sider her arrangement of their common affair with Marita, and of Marita's eventual succession as his wife, as her greatest "invention," her most sub- stantial "surprise" or "plot." She manipulates their lives, in short, like a ma- ternal novelist arranging close relations, though with no real sense of conse- quences; and thereby she commits her "maddest" and most maternal act, her enraged attempt to set David back on the right path-i.e. writing the main narrative which she dominates-by burning the African tales (as Nick Adams' mother burns his father's Indian relics, for instance, in "Now I Lay Me"). In- terestingly, David has grumbled from time to time about not knowing how that main narrative will come out; but when the burning settles that question, he generously ascribes the outcome to Catherine's being rushed-too much in a hurry-as if, given time, she somehow might have plotted a better ending for all concerned. Hemingway seems to have had similar fears about his own plotting. In May, 1950, when he thought that "something might happen before book would be finished," he composed a tentative ending in which Catherine re- turns from the asylum for another Riviera summer with David (Ms. 2/1/1; 3/post 46/1). They again lie together in a beach cove, taking in the sun, talking over old times in Madrid; but instead of tanning naked, Catherine now has "a scarf across her breasts and a towel over her waist." "Weren't we strange children then?" she muses as the chapter opens; but when she adds, "We were comic then.... We were a yell of laughter," David leaves her side, dives off a nearby rock into deep water, and "resists" breathing it in as he comes up for air. His suicidal intent prefigures hers, and becomes the mor- dant theme of the brief chapter. Thus Catherine, though she can no longer recall certain events (a second visit with Colonel Boyle, a trip to Africa), is gripped by a poignant sense of irreversible process: "Remember when I used to talk about anything and everything and we owned the world? All we had to do was see it and we owned it. And I was so proud and made everything in my image. I could change everything. Remember? Change me change you change us both. Change the seasons change everything for my delight. And then it speeded up and speeded up and then it went away and then I went away." (7-8) "Then you came back," adds David; but Catherine says, "Not really," waves off the return of her sanity and their love as "comic," then asks for an- other surprise "like in the old days":</page><page sequence="28">54 NOVEL FALL 1987 "If it goes bad again so I'd have to go back to the place can I, may I, do it the way Barbara did? I don't mean in a dirty place like Venice." "I couldn't let you." "Would you do it with me." "Sure." "I knew you would," she said. "That's why I didn't like to ask." "Probably it would never happen." "Probably. Who knows? Now should we have the nice swim before lunch?" (10-11) On that bittersweet note the provisional ending closes. Barbara has com- mitted suicide in Venice as self-punishment for betraying Nick with Andy on the day of his biking death on the Hendaye road. Catherine wants to follow her example rather than go back to the Swiss asylum, and David, who always goes along with her surprises, seems half-inclined to join her. More impor- tantly, perhaps, he stands loyally beside her in what seems to be a shared recognition of their common failure, and so avoids Dick Diver's aggrandized self-pity--or Fitzgerald's-at the end of Tender is the Night. By 1958, however, Hemingway seems to have decided upon a different ending. His extensive revisions in that year build upon the writer's life and wisdom, and on Marita's crucial relation to that ongoing vitality. Her future marriage with David seems assured when, with her encouragement, David successfully writes the African stories, then reconstructs them from memory after Catherine burns their first inscription. Thus, whatever happens to Cath- erine, the transfer of David to the new and better caretaker has been made; and in the original manuscript at least the terms of that transfer have been carefully defined. Marita is without effort the boy-girl whom David requires for his androgynous complicities. Already a lesbian who wants to please oth- ers, she is more nearly David's twin sister than Catherine, and her conversion to heterosexual love affirms his shaky maleness even as she keeps alive, as "variety" rather than "perversion," the androgynous option that his creative needs demand. Whether she too will become obsessed by androgyny remains to be seen. Meanwhile we see her intuitive grasp of the writer's mystique, in the uncut manuscript, as she reassures him that he can't miss as a writer now since he's having a belle poque, that his gifts are like those of a great weight- carrying horse who must be cooled down and washed off after each morn- ing's workout, that he participates in a mystere in which she too is an initiate, a kind of female trainer whose job is to keep him in good shape so as to serve their common master-and who even knows that he is his best self only when he writes. Scribner's editor, Tom Jenks, has eliminated from the published text this alter ego role, this bond in the mysteries of the writer's craft, as part of his rigorous paring down of Marita's character and of his sur- rogate distrust of Hemingway's ideas, and has reinforced thereby that embar- rassingly easy transition from "the girl" Catherine to "the girl" Marita which makes them seem like interchangeable wives. But Marita is much shrewder</page><page sequence="29">MARK SPILKA I HEMINGWAY'S QUINTET 55 about Catherine, David, and herself than his shears allow, and more interest- ingly knowledgeable about writing. Indeed, her several probing interviews of the writer David, who often seems closer to sixty than thirty in his gathered wisdom and experience, provide a compendium of Hemingway's late views on writers and writing which, along with his views on painters and painting, as elicited by mad Catherine, are among several good reasons why a complete scholar's edition of this unwieldy hybrid manuscript should be pub- lished. One can almost forgive Jenks, however, for reducing to a few hints Marita's stream-of-consciousness desire at one point to give the sleeping Da- vid sweet erotic dreams of his first African sweetheart by oral stimula- tion-one of the odder indications of how well she understands her man, and how far she will go to grant his deepest wishes. For the sad drift of this text is to reduce even more seriously "the girl," the replaceable androgynous/les- bian wife within and beside him, from the recalcitrant devil who strives for independent creativity at all costs, to the "good wife" who ministers to the creative mystery but has no creative life of her own, except as an adjunct of the great weightcarrying narcissistic male she has married. Of lesbianism and homosexuality per se David and Marita are meanwhile contemptuous and dismissive. As David puts it while discussing Marita's schoolgirl follies: "I'm glad you went through that nonsense and know t's worthless." "It's not for us. Anymore than queers would be for you." "I always tried to understand and to be fair," David said. "We've always had them and I'm never rude unless I have to be. But they give me the creeps." (Ms. 3/46/23) So ends the inner journey into the wilds of androgyny. For the time being at least all sexual dangers are diffused, all aberrations trivialized or safely "spooked." David has recuperated his manly strengths as a writer and a lover with Marita's help; Catherine's devilish struggle has been sympathetically portrayed; the enormity of her "crime" has been sharply rendered, and her replacement by the good androgynous wife Marita has been made to seem plausible and inevitable as "a grave and violent thing" (GE 238); indeed, Marita herself seems plausible in preferring her new adjunct status over her early lesbian lostness: but neither David nor Hemingway seems to realize that the new arrangement also constitutes a travesty of female selfhood, a betrayal of truly androgynous love, as between creative equals, and a denial of the primacy of the female within the male for his own "independent" creativity. That kind of colossal self-deception was, to his credit, beyond Fitzgerald, and no real improvement on Kipling's dancing elephants. But perhaps it does ex- plain why, on the night before his suicide in 1961, Ernest Hemingway joined his fourth wife Mary in singing from an adjacent bathroom the last lines of "a gay Italian song: 'Tutti Mi Chiamano Bionda'-'They all call me blond."'25 25 A Life Story, p. 713.</page></plain_text>
