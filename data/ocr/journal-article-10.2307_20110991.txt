<plain_text><page sequence="1">Historical Plays in the Art of the Han Period A. Bulling Philadelphia, Pennsylvania As on many other subjects, ancient Chinese literature is silent on the early stages of the Chinese theater. There is ample evidence that actors and performers of all kinds played an important part in Chinese society in the Chou and Han1 periods. There are a great number of stories about the deeds or misdeeds of actors; best known is one about Confucius who had actors put to death because they made derogatory remarks about their rulers. In general, it is believed that they functioned more as entertainers and court jesters than as actors in serious plays. In addition, there is a considerable amount of information on music2 and dances, including large pantomime-ballets as well as a great number of spectacles which in the later Han period were generally referred to, as pai-hsi?the hundred plays. Though kyuei-lei, puppet shows, were performed at funerals and weddings3 and plays with singers and dancers entertained the people4 at various occasions. There are no descriptions of performances in the literature of the Han period which would allow us to call them plays in the sense of the Chinese theater of later days, dealing with historical episodes or anec dotes, mostly including some dancing, singing or even clowning. In fact, the literary ma terial on pre-Sung plays collected by Wang Kuo-wei,5 Chou I-pai,6 Teng Sui-ning7 and others can only be described as exceedingly poor, proving?if it proves anything?that none did exist. Actually only from the Sung period onward does Chinese literature allow us to follow the manifold developments of the Chinese drama. Yet, this lack of literary sources does not necessarily mean that the Chinese theater did not exist; more likely the reason was that this kind of entertainment lay outside the range of activities writers of earlier times deemed worthwhile to record?perhaps because the audience consisted largely of illiterate people, conceived as the lower orders, including women. It is well known that reliefs and pictures on the walls of tombs and funerary shrines of the Han period provide us with a veritable picture book of performances of all kinds, including acrobats, dancers, jugglers, and other spectacles. These have already been dealt with by various writers.s Yet, the historical episodes and anec dotes of legendary happenings depicted, for example, in the well known funerary shrines of the Wu family in Shantung, are commonly held to be mere illustrations of the respective story. However, for a long time the particular realism of the artists of that period has convinced me that some represented dramatic re-enactments of the events.9 This has been confirmed by re cent discoveries of Han tombs in China. Espe cially interesting are some paintings in a tomb excavated northwest of old Loyang in Honan. It was built of hollow tiles and small bricks.

A report with a detailed description of the tomb has been published in Kaogu xuebao in 196412 and Kuo Mo-jo has added a short essay on the meaning of the vari ous paintings which was published in the same copy13 and with a few added illustrations in W?n-wu ching-hua.14 The main chamber is divided by a column and a partition gable into a front and rear chamber. The space above the lintel of the gate, both sides of the partition gable, the rear wall and the ceil ing, were decorated with paintings. That these were carefully planned is confirmed by the fact that all other hollow tiles were covered with in cised pattern except those on which the pictures were painted. The tiles were always first cov ered with white paint as a base for the pictures. Yet, only two of the paintings will be discussed in this paper; one on the partition gable (PI. 1) and one of the rear wall (PI. II a.b.). We might mention however, that sun, moon, and stars, were depicted on the twelve slabs forming the roof of the gable, emphasizing the prominent part played by heavenly bodies in the religious beliefs of the people of the Han period.15 Entering the tomb one would be faced with the painting on the partition gable (PI. 1). The pediment and central section is made of open work tiles. The scene we will deal with is on the architrave below. It depicts an episode or anec dote which Kuo Mo-jo quite correctly recog nized as illustrating the story of "?rh t'ao sha san shih"1?"with two peaches killing three knights". It is contained in the Yen-tzu ch'un chyiUyXX1Q "the Spring and Autumn of Master Yen". According to the Shih-chi17 he was a con temporary of Confucius and died about 500 B.C. Master Yen or Yen Ying, as he was more com monly called, is one of the many who in the manner of his time offered advice to heads of states. It is told in this story how once he used PL I.

Yen Ying asked a servant to bring him two peaches. These he offered to the three knights, explaining that only those deserved to eat a peach who could claim to have kungn: a word with a wide meaning, including achieve ment, merit, or, virtue. The first of the three knights, Kung Sun-chieh, immediately in terpreted hung as referring to acts of physical courage, believing that Yen Tzu wanted to find out who were the two bravest of them and, con sequently, one would have to go without a peach. Thus, in turn, the three began to boast about their exploits, telling their most courageous deeds. Those of the first two were acts of simple bravery such as catching a tiger with bare hands, or laying in wait for three armies. After having told their respective stories, each one stepped forward, taking a peach and declaring that cour age such as they had shown could not be sur passed. In fact, both were so sure of the superi ority of their deeds that they asserted that if these did not entitle them to a peach there would not be anybody else who could claim to deserve one. The story told by the third one, Ku Yeh tzu, was of a very different type. He told that once in his youth he drove to the river in the king's chariot. Suddenly a huge tortoise came out of the river, and taking hold of the outside horse on the left18 dragged it in his mouth into the river. Although he could not yet swim, he nevertheless jumped into the river, and follow ing the tortoise walked against the current for nine miles. Finally, holding on to the tail of the horse he killed the tortoise. Then, using its head as a stepping stone he climbed out of the river. Thereupon, the people standing on the banks of the river, seeing the head of the tortoise, hailed him as Ho Po, the Lord of the River. His deed and his metamorphosis into the River God, re flected a different type of "achievement" and was immediately recognized as superior to that of his two predecessors. And, Yeh-tzu did not leave anybody in doubt about his claim; he got up, raised his sword, and demanded that the two others return their peaches. They complied; but feeling humiliated about their lack of under standing and lack of modesty, both wanted to show that they were not afraid, not even of death, and to prove their courage both took their swords, raised their hands to their throats and killed themselves. Ku Yeh-tzu, realizing that his behaviour had brought about the death of his two friends, accused himself of lack of the two Con fucian virtues of jen and i? (benevolence and manner), returned the peaches and likewise killed himself. Thereupon, the servant who had witnessed it all, went to the Duke and an nounced that all three had died. The Duke piously ordered the three to be buried in state according to their rank. The picture shows the three knights on the right end (PI. 1 below) (Fig. 3 a) (Figs. 4 a-d). On a low table we see the bowl with peaches and one knight is shown bending down to take one of them (Fig. 4 a). The two on the right side are apparently in a state of great excitement. One is just drawing out the blade of his sword with his right hand, holding the scabbard with his left. This means that he is about to commit suicide (Fig. 4 c). The one next to him turns towards his companion as if making a desperate Fig. 1. Ground-plan of the tomb of Loyang. (Kaogu xuebao, 1964, No. 2, p. 108.) 22</page><page sequence="4">z_/ Fig. 2.

He bends his arm holding his sword pre paring to take his own life (Fig. 4 b). The third one must represent Ku Yeh-tzu, still pleased with himself, picking up the peaches re turned by his comrades (Fig. 4 a,d).19 The man standing on the side of the table looks like the messenger or servant who, watching the events, will bring the news to the duke. The gesture of the kneeling man next to him, pointing with his hands to one side, suggests that he plays the part of a narrator, reporting or interpreting what is going on to the audience, explaining who every body is, giving the background of the story, or pointing out its moral and meaning.20 (Fig. 3 a) The message will soon be delivered to Duke Ching of Ch'i, who is standing in the center of the middle picture (PI. 1, Fig. 3 b). At his side are two attendants holding standards. Their hands are covered by sleeves apparently belong ing to a garment worn underneath another with very wide sleeves (Fig. 5). In any case, the in elusion of this group shows that this was not a one act play, but that the story was enacted in its entirety. The center of the scene on the left side (Pi. 1, Fig. 3 b, 6) is a small man or child. Kuo Mo-jo is not sure whether it represents the story of the little King Ch'eng with the Duke of Chou on the right side, or whether it represents another phase in the life of Yen Ying?Master Yen. Accord ing to Ss?-ma Ch'ien's biography, Yen Ying was exceedingly small, and for that reason his con temporaries tended to make him the laughing stock, though, in the end, Yen Ying invariably got the better of them.21 However, I think that on a relief of the second century A.D. (Fig. 7) a similar small figure is depicted next to the three knights with the peaches, making it reasonable to assume that the small figure in both is meant to represent Yen Ying. This is corroborated by the man on the right who looks down on Yen Ying as if poking fun at him (Fig. 6) ; amusing interludes like this would certainly increase the entertainment value of the play. Moreover, the appearance of a Lilliputian on the stage always contributes to the merriment of the audience. Of the men standing left of the small man, one carries a large twisted stick and looks to the right. The picture of the rest is too disintegrated to show what they are doing, but they seem to be connected in a general way with the scene cen tering on Yen Ying. That the picture on the lintel in PI. 1 repre sents scenes from a play and is not merely an illustration of the story is made evident by various details. Assuming that a painter would have been given the task to illustrate the episodes, he would most certainly have selected the more visually interesting aspects of the story. We have only to look at the two knights at the right-hand side; their movements are those of actors, very ec centric, (Fig. 3 a; Fig. 4 a-c) as if performing a kind of grotesque dance. Such behaviour is not an intrinsic part of the story, but added simply to allow the actors to dramatize the story, to show their skill and to increase the value of the per formance. Though pictures of the Han period show that wide sleeves were fashionable at that time, their stiffness and the play being made with them by the knight in the middle (Fig. 4 b; Fig. 3 a) confirms that this is the picture of an actor. Even more important for the evaluation of drama in the Han period is the difference between the faces of the three knights and those of the Duke and his attendants and servants. The latter are all 24</page><page sequence="6">small and natural looking while those of the three knights are large, ugly, and wild-eyed. The rea son is that they wear masks. It appears that in these plays those who had to perform dances of some kind or other, had to wear masks; such a custom has hitherto been held to have been intro duced into Chinese theater during the Northern Ch'i period, when actors are described as having begun to wear masks in a dance about a beautiful prince who always donned a terrifying mask when going into battle to frighten his enemies.22 The artistic quality of the painting on the lintel (Pi. 1) is high, the distribution of the figures over the whole surface is extremely well balanced and subtle. The differences in the ex pressions of the various persons, for example, the bland faces of the attendants (Fig. 5) and the mocking expression of the gentleman bending down to Yen Ying (Fig. 6) shows that the paint er was an artist of superior ability and not a mere craftsman. Kuo Mo-jo compares this work with Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper, although that is debatable. The fact is that this picture in general layout, in details and brushstrokes shows that painting in the Western Han period had reached a much higher standard of perfection than has hitherto been assumed. I will not discuss the figures on the openwork tiles above the picture (Pi. 1) in detail. How ever, the presence of the Green Dragon on the left side, the White Tiger on the right, and a peacock-like bird above, symbolizing the Bird of Summer, shows that the rectangular panel in the center represents the universe with the crea tures of the four seasons as main figures. In the lower section we see a cat-bear?or pig-like ani mal, sitting in anthromorphic fashion, partly covered with a red cloth. This place is most com monly given to a picture of the Black Warrior, the serpent entwined with a tortoise, represent ing a constellation of winter, symbolizing north, darkness, and so forth; and it is possible that similar ideas were connected with this creature. The lower section of both sides on the pedi ments shows the figure of a running man grasp ing the tail of a winged horse. It is not at all impossible that this is meant to show Ku Yeh-tz? holding on to the tail of the horse following the tortoise. All the more so, because there is a defi nite resemblance; both have large teeth (Figs. 4 a-d), round eyes, a moustache and similar beards. Winged horses and winged stags (above) are denizens of the sky, which means that his adven ture could be interpreted in secular as well as in metaphysical terms. The fact that he was finally hailed as Ho Po, Lord of the River, might be of importance because he might have been linked with the Lord of the Milky Way, which in an cient China was conceived as a river. As I have explained elsewhere in speculations concerning the fate of the souls of the dead, the Milky Way and the River God played a very important part.23 This would have made this play suitable for performance during the time of mourning or during the funeral, and consequently its repre sentation in the tomb appropriate or beneficial for the souls of the dead. That this play was popular during the Han period is verified by a picture in one of the well known funerary shrines in the cemetery of the Wu family (Wu Liang Tz?) near Chia-hsing in Shantung, dated A.D. 147-168 (Fig. 7). It is still given a prominent place next to the reception scene in the recess, and it is possible that its mean ing was more intricate than outlined above. As in the earlier version the peaches are placed on a low table and one man is bending down to pick them up. The other two knights turn towards him; both carry swords. The participants are not individualized and all are dressed alike. Some have a rather peculiar type of hairstyle. It ap pears to flop forward and backward according to the movement of the wearer. This would cer tainly amuse the onlookers. The small figure on the right, as has been pointed out before, must be Yen Ying. In general, the difference between the earlier and later picture of the story suggests that the performance depicted in the funerary shrine was of a simpler type than the earlier one, lacking its subtlety of expression and diversity of movements. It gives the impression that this was a more summarized and much less refined performance; and the actors may well have be longed to groups travelling from village to village with a large repertory of simple plays. In the literature of the Han and of the follow ing periods?as far as I know?there is no record that the story was converted into a play. It was certainly popular among storytellers, and it is in cluded in the Lieh-kuo yen-i24q and other collec tions of novels dealing with historical or semi-his torical stories. Nevertheless, it seems possible that as a play it existed all the time. This would mean that in some cases, not the storyteller paved the way for the drama, but that, on the contrary, the storyteller was influenced by the theater. The 25</page><page sequence="7">episode was later included in the play "Chin t'ao hui"s (Golden Peach Meeting) which is known to have been performed in local operas in Szechuan, Shensi, and Yunnan.26 The Peking opera again took it up,27 as "Erh t'ao sha san shih", basing its account on the story as told in the Lieh-kuo yen-i. The architrave of the rear wall of the tomb in Loyang shows the Feast at Hung-men (Hung men yen11), (Pi. II a,b). This is a well known episode which took place in 206 B.C. after the collapse of the Ch'in dynasty. The story is told in the Shih-chf8 and in the Ch'ien Han-shu.29 It describes one phase in the struggle for supremacy between Hsiang Yii and Liu P'ei, who later be came Kao-tsu, the first emperor of the Han Dy nasty. The feast took place at the army camp of Hsiang Y? at Hung-men. The reason was that Hsiang Yii, trying to enter the Han-ku pass, leading into Shensi, found it blocked by Liu P'ei's troops, and discovered that the latter had al ready conquered the region and entered Hsien yang, the capital of the Ch'in dynasty. Both were generals of the State of Ch'u, but Hsiang Y? was by far the more important and more powerful. His advisers quite rightly suspected that the reason for Liu P'ei's advance had been his wish to set himself up as emperor before Hsiang Yii arrived. The latter was justifiably enraged about this presumption by a less power ful man than himself and decided to attack the army of his competitor the next day. However, Liu P'ei, being warned and realizing that his small army would be no match for that of Hsiang Yii, thought it wiser to apologize to Hsiang Yii. He therefore went over to Hsiang's camp and explained to him that he had entered Hsien-yang only to prevent robbers from plundering the city before Hsiang Yii's arrival. Apparently his speech convinced Hsiang Yii, who generously forgave him and invited him to stay for a banquet. Yet, Liu P'ei had not been able to assuage the suspicion of Hsiang Yii's counselor Fan Tseng, who, being aware of Liu P'ei's superior capabili ties, wanted Hsiang Yii to have him killed im mediately. Therefore, during the feast he sig naled repeatedly to Hsiang Yii, raising a broken jade ring as sign that it should be done now. But Hsiang Y? did not react and ignored his advice. At last, in desperation, Fan Tseng went to see Hsiang Chuang, Hsiang Y?'s cousin, and asked him to dance a sword dance in front of Liu P'ei and in the course of it to strike out and kill him. However, when the dancer entered the tent in which the feast took place, Hsiang Po, an uncle of Hsiang Y?, sensing his intention, got up and started to dance opposite him, shielding him with the movements of his body (and the swaying of his sleeves) and in this manner preventing him from carrying out the murder. According to a later version of the story, during the dance Hsiang Po constantly pleaded with Hsiang Chuang, saying: "kung-mo"?"Sir don't" or, more explicitly, "Sir, don't injure him"/ Chang Liang, Liu P'ei's counselor, watching the dance and realizing the danger his master was in went out of the camp to talk the situation over with Fan K'uai, the carriage attendant of Liu P'ei. The latter got so enraged that, without asking permission, he went into the army camp, burst into the tent, and, his hair standing on end, eyes flashing, he addressed Hsiang Y?, quoting sev eral examples of loyal men of old who had wrongly been mistrusted by their masters, thus admonishing Hsiang Y?, advising him to trust Liu P'ei. Again Hsiang Y? reacted in a kind way, and admiring the courage of the intruder, he in vited him to the feast, offering him wine and a shoulder of pork which Fan K'uai quite uncere moniously placed on his shield, cutting it up with his sword. The third dramatic event during the feast took place after Liu P'ei had left the tent, deciding that it would be better for him to re turn to his own camp as quickly as possible. To account for his sudden departure Chang Liang was sent back to excuse him, telling Hsiang Y? that his master had left because he already had too much to drink. He took with him presents which Liu P'ei had brought and not yet been able to hand over to Hsiang Y? and his counselor Fan Tseng. Thus, after returning to the tent and apologizing for the departure of his master he handed a pair of white jade disks to Hsiang Y? who graciously accepted them, yet when he handed over a pair of white dippers to Fan Tseng, the latter grasped them and in utter fury smashed them with his sword, realizing that Liu P'ei had escaped. The picture of this feast is perhaps even more informative about theatrical plays in the Han period than the other one. For example, the army was camped in a mountainous region, therefore it was held appropriate to show (green and purple colored) mountains as a background set ting. Yet that this is not a real landscape but one 26</page><page sequence="8">painted on a wall or large screen is made exceed ingly clear, by meat, including the entire head of an ox, suspended from hooks shown on the right hand side of the picture. The stylization shows that meat and hooks were part of the painted background (PL II a). In front of this setting the play proceeds. The central figures repre sent the two most important persons, Hsiang Y? and Liu P'ei. They sit side by side; one is holding a horn-shaped goblet with handle in one hand and a small knife for cutting the meat in the other. According to their movements they are engaged in lively conversation, proving that this is not a pantomime, but a play, in which actors engage in a dialogue. According to Kuo Mo-jo, the one on the right-hand side (in the magenta colored dress), is Hsiang Y?, and the one facing him (yellowish garment), is Liu P'ei.30 I am not so sure. According to the expression on their faces, I would say the first one, looking rather cunning, is apparently trying to convince the other with his arguments; this, then, should be Liu P'ei, and the one who listens, Hsiang Y?. Left of this group stands a man in a simple brown robe, turning his back towards the two central figures (PL II b. on right end). This must be Hsiang Po, who with apprehension in his expression looks towards Hsiang Chuang who just enters from the left, ready for his sword dance (Pi. II b. left; Fig. 8). Like the three knights in Pi. I, he wears a frightening mask with teeth sticking out and large protruding eyes. He holds an open sword in his hands and his movements are those of a dancer, including the placing of his left hand on his knee. The scene shown is thus the moment just before the famous sword dance with Hsiang Po, who is about to step forward to shield Liu P'ei. Kuo Mo jo identifies the two men standing next to one another as the respective counselors of the two heroes. The younger, frightened looking man with downcast eyes, a white face and fashion able elaborate hairdress (strands of hair of un equal length fall down on both sides of his face), he thinks, must be Chang Liang, who accord ing to Ss?-ma Ch'ien looked rather feminine, and the older one with beard and moustache, Fan Tseng. This would explain the expression on his face as keyed-up by the hope that soon Hsiang Chuang will kill Liu P'ei. On the right side (Pi. II a.) we see a man kneeling, roasting a piece of meat on a small iron stove, while another one coming from the right seems to be in a hurry to enter the scene. Kuo Mo-jo explains these two men as being no more than space-fillers, having no function whatever. His failure to see the part played by both of them is again due to the fact that he takes the picture as illustration of the story, not realizing that it portrays scenes in a play. The cooking stove and the meat hanging on the wall do not only re mind the audience that food and the preparation of meat is an essential part of the feast, but, more specifically, that the piece of meat is the shoulder of pork soon to be eaten by Fan K'uai, who just enters the scene; the audience of those days would immediately recognize him because as carriage attendant of Liu P'ei he had to wear tight trousers like most men engaged in work con nected with horses and the stable. According to the story Fan K'uai storms into the tent after the sword dance is over. This shows that in this per formance, not only the sword dance, but the whole episode was re-enacted. He was not an educated man but came from a low class family, and his whole behaviour, especially his manner of eating the pork shoulder as described above, might have had the same amusing effect on the audience of those days as the scene of Henry the Eighth tearing a chicken apart and throwing the bones over his head has on us. Fig. 8. Detail of pi. II. Hsiang Chuang entering for the sword dance. (Kaogu xuebao, op. cit., pl. IV.) 27</page><page sequence="9">The stove is not the only piece of removable stage furniture. Hsiang Po on Pi. II b. is stand ing behind a creature with a cat's or bear's (or pig's) head, sitting in anthropomorphic fashion. It resembles to a certain extent the huge figure on the openwork panel in the center of PL I. It holds a wine goblet in its hand and a stick or sword on its lap. It is covered with a white cloth with purple cuffs, the tips covering Chang Liang's robe. This shows that it must have stood in front of the stage; most probably it was a pic ture painted on a board serving as a kind of screen. It is certainly possible that both crea tures were associated with winter, cold, darkness, the underworld, and other frightening aspects and related to the word kungw "fear" which is written three times above the scene on the gable. Screens like this one may well have been used during mourning performances in a number of plays or in general placed on the stage to remind the audiences of dark forces active in the beyond; or else they may have been included simply in the hope that they would scare evil spirits away. In conclusion we can say that the plays of the Han period showing historical episodes or anec dotes were neither pantomimes nor necessarily simple re-enactments of stories in one act. The pictures show that the plays were not restricted to one dramatic action but that the story was enacted in its entirety in various scenes including dialogue, dancing, funny interludes and most probably singing, though unfortunately this does not show in pictures. Can such plays be called "drama" as the term is understood in later periods? In general, I think, the answer can be "yes"; at least in the case of the Hung-m?n yen there is definite development, the action rising to a climax?the sword dance?and happily end ing in the escape of Liu P'ei. Seen in this light it appears that the drama of the Sung and Yuan periods are not so much of an innovation but more an elaboration and stylization of traditional types of plays. Plays like those discussed above, and others, were most probably performed during the Han period at certain festivals or at particular occa sions. One should not forget that the function of the theater in China up to modern times was not restricted to entertainment, but played a promi nent part in religious activities. Plays were per formed at temples, and some were considered particularly appropriate as means to attract the help of certain gods or spirits. That these two plays were depicted in a tomb indicates that in the Han period they were performed at the time of the funeral, or during the period of mourning. This means that, besides their purely historical and entertaining values, they could be interpreted in eschatological terms as connected with the fate of the souls of the deceased. Wang Ch'ung in his Lun h?ng discussing auspicious portents, mentions Liu P'ei and the interludes taking place at Hung-m?n, and explains that nothing could happen to Liu P'ei because he was destined to sur vive and to achieve honour and wealth. His fate had been decided even long before his birth and his charismatic power was revealed at various times throughout his life. In fact he was believed to be endowed with the power of the dragon. When his mother conceived, the spirit of a dragon made its appearance, and when Fan Tseng watched the vapors above Liu P'ei's camp he saw with apprehension that all took the shape of a dragon with five colors, thus predicting his fu ture ascension to the throne. Wang Ch'ung con cludes that all things obeyed him and that men lent him their help and support.31 A play with Liu P'ei as main figure could thus be interpreted as being auspicious, and, actually, such plays are still considered in China as most appropriate for birthday celebrations, expressing a wish for honor and wealth. In contrast, Hsiang Y? in historical accounts is invariably described as cruel, a merci less killer. Whether this is true or not?most likely it is a later fabrication?for the people of the Han period he was the incarnation of anti human destructive forces, such as were associ ated with the constellation of autumn, the bringer of death in nature. Thus Liu P'ei and Hsiang Y? can be interpreted as representing the two great antagonistic powers, connecting the one with the constellation of spring, the Green Dragon, and the other with that of autumn, the White Tiger, or else, the one being imbued with the forces of yang, of life, and the other with that of yin, of death. Their controversy, and even the sword dance can thus be interpreted in cosmological terms and Liu P'ei's escape linked up with the fate of the souls in the beyond and with their successful overcoming of the forces of darkness. In contrast to the lack of information on the play about Yen-tzu, the sword dance and other scenes from the Hung-m?n yen are mentioned in early Chinese literature; for instance, among the dances performed at the Imperial Court of 28</page><page sequence="10">the Han dynasty, the kung-mo dance is men tioned together with such well known dances as the wu-hsing "Five Elements", wu-te "Martial Virtues", ss?-shih "Four Seasons" dances, and others. This must have been one reason why Chou I-pai, T?ng Sui-ning, M?ng Yao32 and others believe that it could not have been any thing more than just a dance. The other being that, although they realized that the kung-mo wu could have contained elements of play or pantomime, their preconceived idea that theatri cal plays of this type did not exist in the Han period made them disregard the possibility that it was part of a play. The kung-mo wu was certainly one of the dramatic highlights of the Hung-m?n yen play, since people enjoy looking at dances and com petitive fights more than listening to long dia logues. For this reason the sword dance may have been singled out as the most attractive part of the play. In addition, as has been explained, it could be interpreted in cosmological terms cor responding to the meaning of the play as such. Although the kung-mo dance was representative of the play in its entirety, it was only a part of it and could not properly be appreciated and un derstood without this background. The famous stone tomb in Yi-nan provides us with an excellent picture of another dramatic part of the Hung-m?n yen play. It is depicted on one of the panels installed in the lower part of the middle chamber and belongs to a group of pictures representing a number of stories of an cient, half legendary people, as well as historical incidents involving people of the Chou and Ch'in periods. At least one?perhaps even two?are connected with the feast at Hung-m?n. The ec centric movements, the capricious dress of some of the persons represented on this group of panels has already caused the author of the report to suggest that they are pictures of actors.33 On the western side of the northern wall on the lower part (Fig. 9) we see the scene in which Chang Liang, after Liu P'ei's escape, hands over his pres ent to Fan Tseng, who in his fury takes the white jade dipper and smashes it with his sword. Chang Liang is shown on the left side holding his sword under his arm. His face expresses consternation or disapproval at Fan Tseng's behaviour. Oppo site him, Fan Tseng's rage is well expressed in his face and by his movements. It appears that both actors are wearing face masks. The one worn by Fan Tseng is particularly easy to see in the line running down the side of his face, leaving the ear exposed. He is holding the vase in his right hand, trying to smash it with the sword in his left hand. His movements are intricate, he steps towards the right turning his body half-way back, looking, or perhaps even screaming at Chang Liang. The winged tiger placed at his feet links him with the constellation of autumn, the White Tiger, thus supporting his master Hsiang Y?'s association with it. The cartouches on this and on the picture above (Fig. 9) are empty and the authors of the Yi-nan report believe that the two men on the upper panel represent Hsiang Po and Hsiang Chuang just before starting the kung-mo dance. That both carry swords, speaks against this in terpretation because according to the story Fig. 9. (lower part) Fan Tseng smashing the dipper handed over to him by Chiang Liang. (Yinan ku hua-hsiang shih-mu fa-ch?eh, op. cit., pi. 56, no. 45, panel on north wall of middle chamber.) 29</page><page sequence="11">Hsiang Po is not armed and defends Liu P'ei only with his movements. The two men seem to be engaged in an argument rather than a fight. In a very theatrical manner the one on the right has moved his left arm forward, opening his hands, showing all five fingers, while the right arm is thrown backwards, but the hand turned up and twisted, so that the lines inside the palm can be seen. Whatever episode is shown on this panel, there can be no doubt that the people are highly skilled actors, a fact accentuated by their attire; for example, the stiffened wing-like, upturned sleeves, the starched ribbons and straps of their caps, the serrated edge of their coats and the huge tiger pouch worn by the man on the right. Apparently the episodes taking place at the feast at Hung-m?n never lost their attraction as material for plays and dances all through the following centuries. Under the name of chih wux the sword dance is known to have been per formed from the fifth century onwards and was still popular in the T'ang period. The name chih wu was given to it because a scarf used to extend the sleeves played an essential part in the de fensive movement of Hsiang Po.34 Another ballet or plav centering around Fan K'uai's ap pearance is known to have been shown at the Imperial Court of Chao Tsung in A.D. 901. It was called Van K'uai fao chiin nan.35 Later, in the Ming period Shen Ts'ai included the Hung men-yen episode in his Ch'ien chin chi,SG&amp;c which is written in the vernacular, and finally in 1926 Chou Hsin-fang37 wrote a play called "Hung m?n yen" which ever since has been on the reper tory of the Peking Opera. In the introduction to the play it is stated that he not only studied the description of the event in ancient literature, such as the Shih-chi, but also read Shen Ts'ai's play very carefully. If we take this as an atti tude tvpical of Chinese playwrights and actors, then the conclusion can be drawn that there is a certain continuity which allows us to view the development of the Chinese theater as an unin terrupted process. Because of changes in intel lectual outlook as well as in techniques of per formance, each period tried to interpret the sub ject in conformity to the ideas of its own time and to introduce improvements in production and presentation. Nevertheless, the force of tra dition must have prevented a complete severance from earlier prototypes. There are a great number of pictures of scenes from plays in tombs and funerary shrines of the Han period. Especially interesting are those in the tomb in Yi-nan, though they are surpassed in numbers by those depicted in the various funerary shrines of the Wu family near Chia hsing in Shantung.38 Only a very few scenes will be briefly discussed here just to show the scope of these plays. The story of an attempted and unsuccessful murder, in principle akin to that shown on PL II is represented in Fig. 10. It is part of the decoration of the so-called left shrine of the Wu Liang Tz'? and, according to Mrs. Fairbanks, was placed in the recess next to the center pic ture, opposite Fig. 7. It shows the well known story of Ching K'o's attempt to kill the King of Ch'in, who later became Ch'in Shih-huang-ti, the first Emperor of the Ch'in dynasty. This is one of the most popular subjects, depicted not only in shrines and tombs in Shantung, but as far apart as Szechuan and Shensi.39 The pictures all differ, though the pillar with Ching Ko's dagger stuck into it is invariably the center of the scene. The episode happened in 227 B.C., and is reported in the Shih-chi.40 Though most of the pictures have been described and analysed in detail,41 with the exception of the one in the tomb in Yi-nan (Fig. 11 below) ; all have so far been interpreted as illustration of the event and not as pictures of a re-enactment of the scene. An artist undoubtedly would have visualized the episodes in a less dramatic manner and would certainly have tried to include aspects referring to the environment, such as the splendor of the royal audience chamber, the impressive figure of the king in his attire surrounded by attendants. Yet the people in Fig. 10 are all dressed more or less alike and, if not for the ring held in his hand, we would not be able to identify the king. Ching K'o differs mainly in regard to his headdress, which most likely is meant to indicate that he was a man from a different state. The scene in Fig. 10 shows the most dramatic moment of the episode: the wild chase around the pillar in which Ching K'o had cut off the sleeve of the dress of the king (seen next to the pillar), and had just been halted by the king's physician who, using his medicine box as a weapon, restrained Ching K'o. Yet, he could not restrain him from throw ing his dagger at the king, which, missing him, got stuck in the pillar. To heighten the awe of the audience the lid of the box with the head of Fan Y?-shih in it is left open, and some hilarious elements are added by showing Wu-yang, Ching 30</page><page sequence="12">K'o's accomplice, falling down as if overrun by the two adversaries in their wild chase. This is a producer's invention because, according to the story, when approaching the king he became so frightened that he shook with fear and changed color. Though the authors of the report on the tomb in Yi-nan are quite correct to identify the pic ture (Fig. 11) with this event because the pillar with the dagger stands in the center, yet they do not offer any explanation for the different atti tude of the two participants. Instead of a wild chase as shown in all the other pictures, the king and Ching K'o are here shown facing one another as if engaged in a conversation. Ching K'o, standing on the right side of the pillar, is dressed like a barbarian, the upper part of his body being naked and his legs sticking out under a short skirt. He carries a sword in his belt and he grasps what looks like a stick with both hands. He wears a most extraordinary headdress deco rated with large pins or ribbons. He has a sneer ing grin on his face and looks at the king who stands on the other side of the pillar holding his sword in his right hand, while gesticulating with his left. He does not look frightened at all, but quite pleased, or rather whimsical. The small box at the foot of the pillar was probably the one which contained the head of the dead general. Right and left pendants are shown decorating the walls behind the figures. It seems to me that the scene on this panel is not based on the story as told in the biography of Ching K'o in the Shih-chi, but fits the event as told in the Yen Tan-tzu,42*B much better. This is a novel some times believed to have been the basis of Ss?-ma Ch'ien's account in the Shih-chi. The Yen Tan tzu, as the title says, centers around Prince Tan of Yen. It tells in greater length the story of his resentment against the king of Ch'in and his obsession with revenge, which at the end caused him to engage Ching K'o as helper. It is a more fantastic variant of the story with some romantic or fairy tale-like interludes. According to the Yen Tan-tzu, Ching K'o, entering the audience chamber, grasped the king's sleeve with his left hand, holding him tight in his grip, while with his right hand he aimed the dagger at the king's breast. Then, having subdued him in this manner, he started to har rangue him, accusing him of past misdeeds and evil plans for the future, telling him that he F/?. 20.

(Yinan, op. cit., pi. 60, no. 49, panel on west wall of middle chamber.) 31</page><page sequence="13">would be killed if he did not do what he wanted.43 The king asked, as an act of grace, to be allowed to sing a last song. Accompanying himself on the ch'in (zither) he sings a song not understood by Ching K'o, and, apparently acting out the songs in movements, he manages to free himself by first tearing off his sleeve, then turn ing half-round drawing his sword, and finally jumping over a high screen. Seeing that his vic tim was about to escape Ching K'o threw his dagger, which, after slicing off one of the king's ears, got stuck in the pillar. Then the king sud denly turned back, and with his sword cut off both hands of Ching K'o. The latter, realizing that his mission had failed and that he had been trapped, started to laugh and to sneer at the king. Though the story does not quite fit the picture (Fig. 11) insofar as Ching K'o's hands have not been cut off, the rest conforms to the situation. This kind of brutality, common in tales of an earlier period, might have been resented by the audience of the later Han period. The story as told in Sbih-chi, and, even more, the variant in the Yen Tan tzu, confirm our suspicion. They sound as if taken over from a play containing a number of songs. The last scene with the acro batic feat of jumping over a screen would be an accomplishment very much appreciated by an audience, and quite in character with skills de manded from actors in later Chinese drama. If the whole story would have been re-enacted in a play, beginning with the suffering and resent ment of Prince Tan of Yen, then the attempted murder would constitute just one scene at the end of the performance, yet, certainly, one of the dramatic highlights of the performance. The cartouches on this panel are all left unin scribed. The one in the upper register (Fig. 11) depicts a dance, in which the man on the left brandishes a sword, while the one on the right is unarmed, raising his arms as if protecting some body. Although the author of the Yi-nan report believes that they represent Nieh Cheng stabbing Hsieh Lei, minister of Han,44 it seems possible that this is the sword dance danced by Hsiang Chuang and Hsiang Po. Their movements give us an excellent impression of the art and skill of the actors of that period.45 Historical episodes like this one can be used as a vehicle or scaffold for messages of a less obvious nature. Both the story of Liu P'ei and the king of Ch'in's escape are based on the same idea; the men ordained to become emperor are imbued with supernatural powers which save them from being harmed. They are dragons. This, as has been previously explained must have been the reason why these scenes were chosen as meaning ful for a tomb. In both stories a sleeve plays an important part in saving the life of the hero. In a cave in Chia-ting in Szechuan46 the sleeve is shown winding around the pillar, looking more like a long scarf or a serpent than a cut-off sleeve, and in the kung-mo dance the sleeve was later extended by a scarf or ribbon, the movement of which could be made to look like the wriggling of a serpent. The pillar, split by the dagger, in variably stands in the center. It is sometimes described as made of wood, but more often of bronze, and according to the Yen Tan-tzu sparks, resembling lightning, fly when the dagger hits it.47 This would certainly please the audience. It is possible that the scene contains remnants of a very ancient rite based on the tree or pillar as a symbol of the cosmic tree, its inside being conceived as a womb and consequently its split ting as a sign of birth.48 The argument might be carried further: if the hero was believed to be imbued with the power of the Dragon, the split ting of the pillar may then be taken as a sign of the birth of the young dragon, the sleeve or ser pent symbolizing the constellation on its rise to the skv in spring. The close connection between cosmological and eschatological speculations, and the metamorphosis the souls of the dead have to undergo have been discussed elsewhere49 and the Dragon of Spring is of particular importance in the process because it is filled with the power of yang, the sun, the male, and so forth. This rela tionship is, to a certain extent, corroborated by the constellation wei,ai the tail of the Dragon, because it is known also as "the room of the queen" or else "the splitting of the tree".50 Ac cording to Wang Chung, Ching K'o's attempt to kill the king of Ch'in, had its repercussion in the sky, insofar as, at that time, a white rainbow was seen partly encircling the sun.51 This was re garded as an omen and is mentioned by various writers, for example, in the Shih-chi in Tsou Yang's letter.52 Some explain the rainbow as a weapon and the sun as a sign of the king,53 cor roborating the link between the king and the forces of light and the sun (yang). That pictures of Ching K'o's unsuccessful ad ventures have been found in tombs in very dif 32</page><page sequence="14">ferent regions of China, reflects the popularity of the story during the Han period; all of them are based on plays and their differences due either to regional variations of performances, or to the fact that some actors had to cater to groups pre ferring a highly dramatic but slightly burlesque show, while others had to serve a more sophisti cated audience, demanding a more strongly stylized performance. Although the literature of the Six Dynasties and the following periods does not contain any information of plays dealing with Yen Tan-tzu and Ching K'o, there is no lack of evidence that the story was popular throughout the time all over China. Herbert Franke quite rightly points out that knowledge of it was not limited to the educated classes who were able to read the Shih-chi and other sources, but was also known among the people.54 This supports the probability that it did not only be long to the repertory of storytellers, but that it was firmly imprinted on the minds of the people by plays enacted by local groups throughout the times. It thus stands to reason that dramas known under the name of I shui ko, "Song of the I River" (Ming period) or I-shui han&amp;k "The Cold I-river," (17th century)55 dealing with the whole story of Prince Tan of Yen and Ching K'o were the products of a long line of preceding plays56 even though re-written and slightly changed at that time. Among the many other scenes shown in tombs and funerary shrines, a few in the tomb at Yi nan may be mentioned because they are less well known than those of the Wu family shrines. Ac cording to the inscription, one of them (Fig. 12) shows Lin Hsiang-ju on the left side and M?ng Pen on the right (names are misspelled) .al Both are famous men. The first lived in the 3rd century B.C., the other, much earlier; in actual fact they are not contemporaries, but history has here been "improved" by the actors to make the story more impressive. The biography of Lin Hsiang-ju is in the Shih-chi.57 He was widely admired during the Han period and later, not only for the bravery he showed in returning the famous jade ring to Chao, but for other deeds of wisdom as well. In Fig. 12 Lin Hsiang-ju wears a most fantastic hairdress with either long pins or ribbons of varying length stiffened by lacquer, standing off his head. Both men wear long belted garments with wide sleeves, those of M?ng Pen, looking stiff, like wings, raised high above the shoulders. It looks as if the latter were wearing a face mask with his own head showing behind it. He has fewer headbands but they are just as long as those of his opponent. Hsiang-ju has a long sword sticking in his belt, of a type no longer worn during the Han period. He stretches out his right hand while holding the famous jade ring (pien ho) in his left, raising it high above his head, apparently arguing with his opponent who wants to snatch it from him. Between both stands a lamp on a stand. According to the story the king of Ch'in wanted to have the jade ring which at that time was in the possession of the king of Chao, and he promised to give him fif teen cities in return. The king of Chao, fearing that he would be cheated, and not be given the cities, sent his minister Lin Hsiang-ju to bring back the ring if his suspicion should prove cor rect. Apparently his fear was justified. Hsiang ju, trying to return the jade, encountered all kinds of difficulty, but succeeded in the end. The reason why his opponent in Fig. 12 is called M?ng Pen is that this was a man well known for his enormous physical strength, who could tear the horns out of a living ox. Apparently he is here playing the part of a strong man who is mentioned in the story as a helper of the king of Ch'in, trying to force Hsiang-ju to hand over the ring. The name of M?ng Pen would certainly impress the audience, heightening their admira tion for Hsiang-ju.58 The scene is also depicted in one of the shrines of the Wu family. This was Fig. 12. Lin Hsiang-ju holding up the jade ring of the king of Chao and Meng Pen. (Yinan, op. cit., pi. 55, no. 44, panel on north wall of middle chamber.) 33</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 13. Duke Ling of Chin, his dog, and Chao Tun or T'i Mi-ming. (Yinan, op. cit., pi. 58, no. 47, panel on eastern wall of middle chamber.) F/?. 24. Duke Hs?an of Ch'i, Wei Chi, and maid servant. (Yinan, op. cit., pi. 53, no. 42, panel on south wall of middle chamber.) most likely only one scene in a longer play in which other episodes of Lin Hsiang-ju's life were re-enacted. A drama dealing with the same sub ject called wan piam?"the unbroken jade-ring" existed in the Ming period; and again we might ask how much did it owe to tradition and how much was it the work of a writer of the Ming period?59 The numerous pictures of historical or semi historical episodes and stories in funerary shrines and tombs of the Han period provide us with a fairly accurate picture of the scope of such per formances, which must have ranged from short one-act plays to long ones lasting for hours on end. The festoons with pendants, for example, Figs. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, invariably placed above the pictures, most likely imitate a canopy hung over the stage. Furniture includes screens, tables, lamps, stoves, animal or monster figures, and other easily movable objects. Apparently a living dog is introduced into the play in Fig. 13. It jumps and barks at the man at right. According to the inscription, the man at left is Duke Ling of Chin,an a brutal tyrant who lived in the sev enth century B.C. He wanted to kill his minister Chao Tun during a banquet, but the latter, warned by his loyal servant T'i Mi-ming, went out of the hall well in time and the Duke, seeing him leave, sent his mastiff after him. Yet, before the fierce dog could attack Chao Tun it was killed by his servant. The man on the right is, thus, either Chao Tun or T'i Mi-ming.60 Al though the actors wanted to introduce a dog into the play they used a small one, which could hardly be a serious threat to Chao Tun. More over, they dressed it up, putting some material on its shoulder, making it look like a winged dog.61 The actors must in most cases have been pro fessionals, able to express the required sentiments in their faces; for example, in Fig. 14 Duke Hs?an of Ch'i (on the left side) looks rather de jected while listening to Wei Chi,a0 who re proaches him in no uncertain terms for planning to attack Wei (her father's country) and is apt, in general, to criticize his moral conduct. She has shown her dismay over his aggressive inten tion by taking off her jewels (carried by her maid servant seen on the right) and prostrating herself when she heard him coming.62 In conclusion we can say that the plays de picted in the tombs of the Western and Eastern Han periods were not primitive at all, but had already reached a state of considerable perfection or even sophistication. The question might there fore be asked: did this kind of theater begin with the ascent of the Han dynasty or did it start earlier? Unfortunately, the art of the previous dynasties has so far not supplied us with similar visual evidence, yet this does not mean that it did not exist. In fact, I have suspected for a long time that the questions in the T'ien-wen?3 were based on ritual plays and performances of all 34</page><page sequence="16">kinds. According to Wang I (second century, A.D.), Ch'? Yuan was inspired to write the Tyien-w?n after looking at pictures in an aban doned ancestral temple of the kings of Ch'u. In case I am right, it would mean that the people of the Han period followed an ancient custom when they filled their tombs?like temples?with pic tures of plays in which the deeds and misdeeds of people of the past were re-enacted. In fact, such a custom has survived in China up to the present, as Professor Eberhard has shown;64 walls of temples are still frequently adorned with pic tures of plays that are performed in local theaters. Perhaps even more convincing evidence for the existence of pre-Han plays in which historical or semi-historical events were enacted, is provided by their description in ancient Chinese literature. For example, the story of the feast at Hung-men in the Shih-chi reads like a scenario for a play with detailed directions in regard to the seating, coming and going of each person, including their conversation given in direct speech. However, this type of dramatic report of events has by no means been invented by Ssu-ma Ch'ien, but has been used by writers long before him. The use of direct speech, as Burton Watson points out65 is characteristic of early Chinese literature and in the Tso-chuan, for example, "it is the speech portions which carry the burden of the story". Although he shares the general opinion that drama did not exist in ancient China and that Chinese history was designed to be read, never theless, he remarks that in the story of Duke Hsien, the three ministers appear "as though on a stage stating their respective opinion and then exit",66 or else he observes that the manner in which a battle is described reminds him of scenes of battles in Elizabethan plays.67 So far, actual evidence is lacking, yet much speaks for the possibility that long before the Han period legendary or historical episodes were re-enacted in plays. Though they may have been very dif ferent in style from those of later periods, such plays would certainly have provided an excellent method to let the illiterate section of the popula tion participate in the lore and actual experience of past generations on which their political, social and emotional values were based.

Herbert Franke; "Die Geschichte des Prinzen Tan von Yen", Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl?ndischen Gesellschaft, Bd. 107 (1957), pp. 412-458. According to tradition the story of Prince Tan of Yen dates back to the end of the Ch'in or beginning of the Han period. It contains many features which would fit in well with such an early date. Yet it might have undergone considerable changes in the course of the Han period, and its date has been widely discussed by scholars. 43. Although Ching K'o in the story actually says that he wants to kill the king, this description sounds as if he only wants to take him prisoner. Actually Wang Ch'ung; Lun-h?ng, trans. Forke, op. cit., Vol. II, p. 136, states that Ching K'o wanted to bring the king back to Yen alive. 44. This story is told in the Shih-chi (ch. 86.12-20). 45. Toschio Nagahiro; The Representational Art of the Han Period,^ Tokyo, 1965. Page 137 (figs. 7, 8, 9) shows excellent drawings of the movements and steps of actors shown on the panels in the tomb in Yi-nan. Seeing them, one gets the impression that postures in these various dances and plays were strictly regulated. 46. See: R. Edwards; op. cit., figs. 3, 5. 47. Franke; op. cit., pp. 441, 449. 48. A.

The names of the two plays l-shui ko and 1-shui han are linked with the story of Prince Tan of Yen. The Prince and his followers accompanied Ching K'o when he set out to go to Ch'in. When they reached the I River (l-shui) Ching K'o began to sing a song (ko) of farewell about the cold water of the I River (l-shui han) and a young hero who failed to return. All felt sad and wept. This crossing of the river is one of the most important parts in the story. 57. Biography of Lin Hsiang-ju: Shih-chi (ch. 81). 58. M?ng Shuo is the same as M?ng Pen. He is often mentioned in the Han period as an example of gigantic strength. The admiration felt for Lin Hsiang-ju is reflected in Ss?-ma Hsiang-ju's name. (See: Yves Hervouet; Sseu-ma Siang-jou, Paris, 1964, pp. 13-14.) 59. This play is mentioned in an article by Wolfram Eberhard; "Orakel und Theater in China", Asiatische Studien, Vol. XVIII-XIX (Bern, 1965), pp. 11-17. 60. The authors of the report on the tomb in Yi-nan, op. cit., pp. 24, 25, 40, believe him to be Chao Tun, whereas K. Finsterbusch, op. cit., holds him to be T'i Mi-ming. 61. The story is told in the Tso-chuan (Duke Hsiian, second year); the banquet took place in the ninth month. 62. This story is in the Lieh-n? chuan ("Biographies of famous women") by Liu Hsiang (B.C. 80-A.D. 9) and in the L?-shih ch'un-ch'iu. Translated by R. Wilhelm; Fr?hling und Herbst des L?
