[Apart frown the analogies of experience, not yet consi(lered, nothing is left of the entire Analytic but the demonstration of the presence in all experience and knowledge of the activity of a unitary self-consciousness. We now pass to substantiality and causality: reciprocity may be, omitted. As regards the former, Kant failed to see that the notion of substance is not an epistemological condition, but a scientific hypothesis. So with eausality: Hume transformed the old anthropomorphic conception of it into that of insubstantial events temporarily related. Kant appropriated this view, but sought to extract the causal principle a priori from the pure category of dependence. And even if Kant is so far justified that the ideal of the new causation is to subordinate the laws of nature to the logical principle of ground and consequence, the relation between logical thought and the order of cosmical events could never transcend analogy.] W. Caldwell. 'Von Hartmann's Moral and Social Philosophy.-I. The Positive Ethic.' [Analysis of Das sittliche Bewusstsein. (1) Brief critique of hedon,ism and of objective morality (ethies of feeling and taste). (2) Objective morality as heteronomous needs no comment; as rational mnorality, it "inevitably collapses into the ethic of the 'end"'. (3) Social morality, the programme of social democracy, implies the general- happiness principle: happiness and enjoyment are nmore cared for than culture and development. Or, if not, it is culture and development of heart and character (not of intellect) that are desired, and the ethical standard has altogether eha,nged. The evolutional philosophy is respon- sible. (4) We may now look, with Hartmann, for a superhumain end to human evolution; or we may seek a deeper correspondence between the aims of personal and social evolution. Hartma,nn has, in any case, broken up the apparent objectivity of the notion of social development as the suprenme end of conduct.] J. D. Logan. 'The Absolute as Ethical Postulate.' [We are free, in so far as our morality on its inner side passionately reaffirms the ideals of the absolute. And "whether the individual's days be few, or whether he live again in another world, he is just as mortal or immortal as he can be, i.e., so far as. he, by his active co-operation with the mind and will of God, perfects the life of the absolute ". The teleological world is constituted by the conscious relation of the world of the absolute as such and our describable world as such; and finality is the category of our inmost being.] G. A. Cogswell. 'The Classification of the Sciences.' [The attempts of Comte, Spencer, Wundt, with criticism.

No. 22. J. Halleux (' Le probleme philosophique de l'ordre social') divides the various theories on the meta- physical foundation of the social order into the Christian, which bases the social order on a natural necessity of the moral order resting, in the last analysis, on the will of God; the "contract" theory, originally pro- pounded by Epicurus, and advocated in nmodern times by Hobbes and Locke, but finding its chief defender in Rousseau, which represents the social order as a result of mere convention; and the evolutionist, which regards the social order as an expression of the blind necessity of things. C. Plat ('La valeur morale de la science d'apres Socrate') maintains that "to convert men to virtue by means of knowledge" was the chief aim of Socrates. But by what kind of knowledge? If Socrates appears at times as a pure moralist, or, in the words of Marbach and Khron, " a simple reformer of practical life," he appears at other times as a mere "speculator" who desires knowledge for its own sake. But Socrates was above all things a moralist, insists M. Plat. Even when he en- couraged to speculation his final intention was a moral one. It was not sufficient to set before the Athenians a high ideal of life. It was necessary to make them grasp this idea in all its beauty and majesty. But cultivated minds alone could so grasp it. But speculation is mind cul- ture. Hence the efforts of Socrates to promote speculation. C. Noel ('La conscience de l'acte libre et les objections de M. Fouillee') contends for the freedom of the will and replies to the arguments advanced in support of Determinism. D. Mercier ('Un cri d'alarme') defends Neo-scholasticism from the strictures which have recently been passed upon it by Prof. Billia of Turin. M. de Wulf (' La SynthUse scolastique'-suite et fin) shows that Scolasticism is far removed from any system of Monism. Its Theodicea presents a personal God and establishes'the fact of creation. Its metaphysic of contingent being is at once a moderate dynamism (act and potentia, matter and form, essence -and existence) and a resolute defence of individualism. Its psychology is experimental, objective and spiritual. Its moral science and its logic borrow from its psychology their distinguishing characteristics. L'ANNIE PSYCHOLOGrQUE (Cinquieme annee), 1899. This volume like its predecessors is edited by Dr. Binet, with the assistance of Dr. Beaunis and Prof. Th. Ribot, and it adds to the obligations under which students of psychology already lie towards these indefatigable workers in the field. They have once more given us a serviceable record of recent research and opinions as well as some some interesting original papers. The analysi? of recent books and articles occupy less room than those</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 283 of last year. They extend to about 150 pages as against 270 in 1898; but they do not fall in any degree below these in interest, and present in a convenient and readily consulted form the results of a great deal of the latest work done by French, German and American psychologists. Once more the English make a very poor appearance. You may turn over dozens of pages without seeing a single British name. Is it not about time that somethilng should be done to remove this reproach? During the last few years we have produced some admirable general works of a theoretical character, but in systematical experimental re- search, at any rate as regards human consciousness (for we inust not overlook the inquiries of Prof. Lloyd Morgan), we have done next to nothing. There is no doubt need to review and co-ordinate the researches of men engaged in comparatively small and isolated corners, and in psychology, even more than in other sciences, excessive limitation of interest can lead only to unsatisfactory consequences. But while this is true, yet the divorce of theoretical exposition from exact quantitative research must have in the long run an effect almost equally deplorable. Work in properly equipped laboratories is necessary in order to keep the psychologist in touch with fact. The theorist, who deals largely with loose generalities and who bases his opinions on casual data obtained by more or less unsystematic introspection, must be at a. considerable dis- advantage. It may be a question whether general theory is not too much neglected in the psychological teaching of some foreign universities. Whether this be so or not, it is clear that we Englishmen are making a mistake in devoting our whole attention to it, and trying to study and teach without any serious experimental and quantitative work. The original papers which take up the first 600 pages of the volume seem on the whole somewhat less important than usual. The longest is an article by M. Victor Henri, entitled " Revue generale sur le sens nusculaire," which contains a historical and critical account of the subject, running to more than 150 pages. The writer includes in his survey the various sensations (articular, dermal, etc.) which accompany and make known to us states of rest and motion, as well as those which may more properly be called miuscular. He recalls some of the main contributions made by different psychologists and physiologists from Berkeley to Goldscheider and makes clear the exact nature of the various questions they have attempted to solve. M. Henri shows him- self as usual a fair and acute critic. His own position is seldom very decided, though he takes sides against Goldscheider in regard to the existence of muscular sensation. He argues that Goldscheider's negative view on this subject rests on an insufficient basis of fact. The non-visual sensations of movement cannot be entirely resolved into those arising from the surfaces of the joints. If they can, how is it we have such sensa- tions through the eye and the tongue ? Goldscheider apparently examined only cases of passive movement, that is changes of position of a member when the subject remains passive, while the member is moved by external means. Henri rightly objects to our extending to the case of active movement results which have been found to hold good only in the case of passive movement; also to our assuming that in movements of a whole limb only the same sensatfons will be involved as when a single digit is lifted. It is reasonable to expect that the psychical processes involved in the wide and complex movements of an arm will be in many ways different from those which accompany the displacement of a single finger. The whole question needs a great deal more experimental in- vestigation. It seems to me that M. Henri overlooks the importance of tendon-strain as a possible factor. In the main his attitude must com-</page><page sequence="5">284 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. mend itself to those who prefer to weigh their facts in quiet rather than be in the front of a new movement of opinion. He holds that the existence of innervation-sensations can at present be regarded as neither proved nor disproved. Here again there is much need for fresh observations. both of normal and abnormal subjects. The omission of any discussion of Miinsterberg's very complicated view as to the character of the so- called innervation-sense, a view which Wundt now accepts and in which. he seems to claim a paternal interest, is unfortunate. Next in length and perhaps in importance is a me'moire by the Editor himself on Suggestibility. It seems to group together without sufficient justification many different types of mental process; but it contains some very interesting details as to conjuring, automatic writing, the tendency to double personality and the liability to hallucination. The experiments made by Seashore at Yale, and first reported in 1895, show us, clearly that, given certain conditions (e.g., authority, routine, etc.), there are few persons who do not readily become victims of perceptional hallucination. Even American students who had been warned that, tricks would perhaps be played on them were deceived; when thrown off their guard by a few repetitions of the experiments with actual stimuli they appeared to perceive stimuli which did not actually occur. These. and much else in the paper have an obvious bearing on reports of miracles, spiritualistic phenomena, and hypnotic experiments. Dr. Zwaardemaker gives some account of the present state of know- ledge as to the physiological and physical conditions of olfactory sensation. He is of course a great authority on the subject, but one is surprised to. find that he uses an olfactometer with indiarubber tubing and sometimes, mnixes his solutions of odorous substances with paraffin. More interesting is a short article by Dr. Bourdon on the alleged apparent decrease in the, size of objects, e.g., the sun and moon, as they rise above the horizon. He comes to a negative conclusion, and thus contradicts the results obtained by Stroobant about fifteen years ago. Diagrams would have been welcome in this paper. The impression it leaves on one's mind,. at any rate on my mnind, is that sufficient care has not been taken to avoid entirely the suggestions of distance. A.nother interesting- paper is that on our perception of solid objects by M. Claparede,. who urges that " form " is an abstraction, and that it is impossible to establish in any absolute way that the perception of it depends on some particular type of sensation. Sensations of temperature, contact,. pressure, movement, and others are concerned. He draws an inteiesting distinction between primary and secondary identification of objects, between apprehending the form and recognising the object as one of a certain definite kind. There are papers on muscular and intellectual fatigue, and one on what the French call audition color6e, first clearly- described by Galton. Dr. Blum gives us some useful criticism on certain recent coiltributions to " Pedology," and pleads for caution in proclaim- ing general laws of intellectual development on the strength of nuluerical, results obtained from a single country or even a single district. Several papers on apparatus serviceable in the psychological laboratory will be found of interest; but two or three on cephalometry would be more in place in an anthropological year-book. There is a good deal of biblio- graphical information-in the volume, which may be recommended to most students as almost indispensable. It is, considering its character,, commendably free from misprints, though I have noticed a few. ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PSYCHOLOGIE UND PHYSIOLOGIE DER SINNESORGANE. Bd. xxii., Heft 2. G. Abelsdorff.

Such a view is more exact than Meinong's theory of the play of attention upon aspects of the simple contents. (2) Complex contents. The form- qualities are rather attributes than contents; and are not an explanation, but simply designations of empirical data. They cannot be explained as relations (relations form one class of them) or as modes of feeling. (3) Judgmnents of comparison require the presence of the two contents to be -compared, and the knowledge that they belong to that group of such complexes which has determined the meaning of the predicates ' so far alike,' 'so far different,' etc. The second factor is, in turn, composed -of the after-effect of this group, and of the knowledge of the similarity of the new complex to the old.] F.
