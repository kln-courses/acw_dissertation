<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi: The Zoroastrian Iconographie Program on a Sogdian Sarcophagus from Sixth-Century Xi'an1 ZSUZSANNA GULÄCSI AND JASON BEDUHN NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY In 2004, Chinese scholars introduced the world to a Sogdian sarcophagus, dating from 579 c.e., which was unearthed the previous year from a single-chambered burial site in the capital city of Chang'an (modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), and is housed today in the collection of the Xi'an Municipal In stitute of Archaeology.2 In the decade since, this monument has been the subject of a number of studies about the narrative reliefs covering its exte rior surface, which fall into two subject categories: a set of biographical panels portraying events from the life of the deceased, and a set of religious pan els initially identified as Zoroastrian.3 Soon there after, however, a Manichaean interpretation was put forward for those religious motifs whose exact identification within a Zoroastrian milieu offered greater challenges. In subsequent studies, this Manichaean understanding has been embraced, repeated, and expanded upon to the point of being treated as the standard and established view. These Manichaean interpretations, however, do not hold up to critical assessment and, as we shall show, the motifs in question are better explained in harmony with the overall Zoroastrian iconographie program consistent throughout the religious panels. According to the Sogdian and Chinese inscrip tions engraved above the entrance door, this sarcophagus held the remains of two Sogdian individuals. The male occupant, Wirkak, came from the Sogdian territory located around the city of Kes (Ch. Shi) and thus was known by the Chinese name Shi Jun ("Master Shi").4 From a highly positioned family, he was appointed to the office of sabao (Sogdian srtp'w) of the Sog dian expatriate community in Liangzhou during the Northern Zhou dynasty (557-581 c.e.). The female occupant, Wiyusi, hailed from Samarkand (Ch. Kang) and so was identified in Chinese as the "wife from the Kang clan" (Ch. qi Kang shi) and more explicitly described as Wirkak's wife in the Sogdian text that provides a more egalitarian view of her.5 Wirkak and Wiyusi died a month apart in the summer of 579 c.e. Their three sons (Vreshmanvandak, Zhematvandak, and Protvan dak) arranged to have them interred together in a house-shaped stone sarcophagus (Ch. shitang, lit. 'stone chamber') on February 23, 580 c.e.6 The funerary monument of this Sogdian couple is made of originally painted and gilded stone slabs to create a miniature model of a timber-framed Chinese house or temple (fig. I).7 Its four exterior sides are densely decorated in low relief carvings to convey blind architectural details and a com plex figurai program. Its front (South) side is or ganized in strict formal symmetry around a large two-winged door (fig. la). Above the door are the Sogdian and Chinese inscriptions. Flanking the door is a pair of inner panels with a guardian deity in each, and an additional pair of outer panels that feature three sections. From top to bottom, each outer panel contains a group of musicians, a styl ized window flanked by a pair of foreigners, and a half-man half-rooster composite being standing before a fire in a portable brazier (identified as a symbolic representation of Sros, the embodiment of the Zoroastrian priestly function). Its three ad ditional sides feature narrative scenes wrapped around the exterior of the structure in a clock-wise</page><page sequence="2">guläcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi a: Frontal View (H: 158 cm) Fig. 1.

The six biographi cal panels (scenes a-f ) start on the middle panel of the left side and conclude on the last-but-one panel of the back (fig. 2). They are preceded and followed by two single religious panels, which continue with three additional religious panels on the right (East) side. The interpretation of some of the religious scenes is somewhat complicated by their layouts. While some are carved one panel at a time framed by the prominent blank edges (as seen on the left side of the structure), others are spread across three panels (as seen on the right side). Again others take up only smaller parts of a panel without being framed (as seen on the back). The sarcophagus of Wirkak and Wiyusi is one of ten known, high-quality funerary monuments made for rich and powerful Sogdian merchants resident in the capital or in nearby centers dur ing the second half of the sixth century,8 most of which display Zoroastrian themes.9 Their re lief carvings share basic Zoroastrian iconography with other Sogdian funerary monuments both from the Sogdian homeland and China, including figures of priests—mouths covered in padäms, holding the sacred barsom before portable ritual fires—as well as characteristic rooster-human hybrids with similar attire and activity. The iconographie program on this sarcophagus goes even further by referencing more complex Zoro astrian concepts, such as the Cinwad Bridge of post-mortem judgment, and Garödmän, i.e., the Zoroastrian Paradise as the "House of Song." The adoption of a Chinese stone structure for burial, although not in accord with the standard Zoro astrian practice of exposing the dead, still abides by the religion's strictures to prevent corpse pol lution of earth, water, or fire.10 The front of the tomb, with its entrance door, faces south, the di rection of Paradise in Zoroastrian teaching.11 The Sogdian inscription above the door, although not overtly religious in content, refers to the two de ceased attaining 'xwstm'xw (Avestan vahistdm ahüm), that is, the Zoroastrian "Best Existence" or Paradise.12 All of these details about the tomb attest a solidly Zoroastrian religious context for Wirkak and Wiyusi in life and in death. In line with the above observations, the tomb's discoverer, Junkai Yang, together with Frantz Grenet and Pénélope Riboud, interpreted the ma jority of the iconographie motifs in Zoroastrian terms, while acknowledging that some motifs eluded such interpretation.13 It was the desire to solve these iconographical anomalies that led Etienne de la Vaissière to appeal to a possible per sonal religious syncretism on the part of Wirkak, evidenced in what the scholar interpreted as subtle references to Manichaeism in the artis tic program of the sarcophagus.14 There is noth ing wrong hypothetically with such a scenario, Wirkak and Wiyusi certainly could have encoun tered Manichaeans either in Sogdiana or along the Silk Routes,15 and it would not be impossible or even surprising for a layperson to split allegiance between religions whose sacerdotal proponents insisted were incompatible. The only question is whether this scenario best accounts for the fea tures of this sarcophagus. Our position is that the fragmentary knowledge modern research has about the Zoroastrian reli gion in the time period in question, as well as of the form it took among Sogdians (more specifi cally expatriate Sogdians living in China) must be taken into account, and that one should not be too hasty to resort to other religions to explain iconographie elements in an artistic program that by wide consent is overwhelmingly Zoroastrian. Just because an artistic motif is not immediately identifiable in the earliest surviving Zoroastrian literature from four centuries later does not pre clude it representing some poorly attested or unknown theme of the religion during the 6th century. Since a large amount of the iconogra phy is unmistakably Zoroastrian, we should as sume everything else is, unless there is a reason it cannot be. Before reaching such a conclusion, we must engage in a thorough search of Zoroas trian sources for possible correlates, keeping in mind that originally non-Zoroastrian sources for the iconography may have been appropriated to convey Zoroastrian themes. Nine motifs on the five religious panels have been hypothesized to contain Manichaean themes (fig. 2). They are located on panel 1, which is the first panel along the left side of the structure; on panel 8, which is the last panel along the back; and on panels 9-11, which are the three panels on the right side. Previous scholarship argued for the Manichaean interpretation of these motifs in light of Manichaean literature as well as Uygur Manichaean art dating from the 10th-century Ko cho, Chinese Manichaean art produced and used in the region of Ningpo around the 13th/14th centuries, and a story about Mani's cave known from Central Asian Islamic literature starting 3</page><page sequence="4">gulàcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi Fig. 2. Sequence of Narrative Panels. After Yang 2014: fig. 80.</page><page sequence="5">gulâcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi from the 12th century. Our first goal is to eval uate the proposed Manichaean identification of these nine motifs in light of Manichaean teach ings documented in text and art. After the critical analysis of the proposed Man ichaean iconography of the sarcophagus, in the second part of this study we will offer literary and artistic evidence in support of alternative, Zoro astrian interpretations of the motifs in question. Our second goal, therefore, is to begin the pro cess of filling the gaps in the previous Zoroastrian identifications of the religious panels, and provide an overall reading of these carvings as a consistent program, conveying a coherent message about the afterlife aspirations of Wirkak and Wiyusi within their Zoroastrian faith. If our arguments are ac cepted, this remarkable archaeological find would have to be recognized as a major new source on the history of Zoroastrianism, centuries earlier than the oldest surviving Zoroastrian texts. Motifs With Questionable Manichaean Connotations The nine motifs previously claimed to represent Manichaean themes will be surveyed below in a sequence that accords with the viewing direction of their panels on the sarcophagus. While discuss ing these motifs, we provide a brief description of them and an overview of the arguments that have been put forward in support of their Manichaean meanings, followed by an assessment of these claims in light of Manichaean sources. 1. Divine Being Giving a Sermon The motif of a divine being giving a sermon is part of panel 1 located along the left side of the sarcophagus, where it occupies the upper third of the carving surface (fig. 3a). It constitutes a scene that organizes nine figures in a clear visual hierar chy: one main figure interacting with two laypeo ple flanked by two groups of three seated figures overlapping one another vertically along the two edges of the scene. The main figure is shown on the largest scale just to the right of the midline as the focus of a radial composition—all figures direct their attention to him. His iconography is equipped with that of a sermonizing deity, includ ing the body of a well-fed older man with a mus tache and a pointed beard, a topknot on pulled back hair, a monk's robe worn without covering the right shoulder, cross-legged sitting on a lo tus base, and a large mandorla that encloses this figure from torso to head. Prominently placed in front of the deity at the lower left is a lay couple (referencing Wirkak and Wiyusi), sitting on their heels while assuming gestures of homage and prayer with their hands clasped. The three figures on the right are given minimal visual attention, by being shown squeezed between the deity's mandorla and the blank vertical frame of this panel. Their hands are clasped in either gestures of homage or prayer. In contrast, the three figures on the left are spaciously portrayed with their topknots, long robes, and animated hand gestures in clear view as if they were reacting to the teach ings given by the main figure. A Manichaean interpretation of the main motif in this scene has been hypothesized by Étienne de la Vaissière. He readily admits that the "composi tion of the arrangement" of this scene is Buddhist (2005c: 358) and that the main figure, sitting on a lotus and surrounded by a mandorla, derives from Buddhist art, while noting several atypical details such as the mustache and beard and the "strange" hand gesture (2015: 97).16 He claims that the beard is "sans parallèle aucun dans l'art bouddhique" (2005c: 359). He compares this ico nography to what he calls "Buddha-Laozi syn cretic" images "quite frequent in 6th c. China" (2015: 97). The absence of a headgear charac teristic of Laozi figures, however, rules out this identification, de la Vaissière thinks.17 He further argues that, "Pishyotan, Saoshyant, Zoroaster, Mazdak or whoever might have been the Prophet or Savior of the Khurrami"—i.e., unorthodox Zo roastrian sects—"should not be dressed as a Bud dhist Monk, on a Lotus throne, with a mandorla of light, and preach to Chinese Daoists" (2015: 105-6). He thus arrives at an identification of the divine being as Mani by a process of ruling out other major religious figures of the age. His sup port of this argument is his identification of the three figures in tall hats (located directly below and to the right of the main figure) as Manichaean elect. The three figures in tall hats, however, be long to a separate scene on this panel (as indicated by the direction of their gaze, which excludes them from this radial composition) and so, we will consider the question of their identification below. Frantz Grenet has accepted de la Vaissière's 5</page><page sequence="6">GULÄCSI AND BEDUHN The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi interpretation, and summarizes it succinctly as "The preacher is therefore Mani, the 'Buddha of Light/ who having already converted the Western barbarians is now persuading Chinese wise men, probably Taoists" (Grenet 2007: 475).18 This argument is problematic for the follow ing reason. In Manichaean art the images of Mani systematically display a standard iconography, which includes a robe and a cloak that fully cover the body up to the neck, and never a Buddhist monastic robe with one bare shoulder. Further more, Mani is shown with long loose hair, and never with a topknot in Manichaean art. These markers go back to third-century Mesopotamia, from where Mani's own sealstone survives with his portrait,19 and continue through Chinese de pictions from the 13th-14th centuries.20 These identifying features of Mani are never compro mised in Manichaean art by any Buddhist influ ence. This iconography distinguishes Mani from that of a Buddha figure even in a Manichaean con text, where the Historical Buddha is shown with his distinct Buddhist iconography, as seen on an Uygur picture book fragment depicting the Pri mary Prophets of Manichaeism around the Light Mind.21 De la Vaissière's interpretation of this fig ure as Mani cannot be accepted, since it depends entirely on a process of elimination of other can didates, without consideration of the evidence of surviving iconography of Mani from both before and after the time of Wirkak. 2. Three Figures in Tall Hats The motif of three figures in tall hats is located on panel 1 of the sarcophagus, directly below the lotus seat of the divine being, along the right edge of the carving (fig. 3b, upper right). The forward direction of their gaze, and their horizontal align ment with two animals integral to the scene, indicate that they belong to the episode unfold ing before and beneath them, rather than to the separate scene above them on the panel. Concern ing the positioning of their bodies, all these are seated on their heels holding their hands clasped in front of their chest in gestures of prayer. Con cerning their garments, these figures are dressed in long robes with flaring sleeves. The hats of the three are uniformly tall, but of two distinct de signs. The one worn by the figure on the right is distinguished from the others by having an even surface and a conical shape. The other two figures wear a headgear with three panels, the middle of which protrudes higher than the rest. Concerning their projections, their faces and upper bodies are shown from a frontal view, while their lower bod ies, that is, their sitting positions are portrayed from a three-quarter view. Analogously to their heads, their hats are also shown in what appears to be closer to a frontal, rather than a three-quar ter view. A Manichaean interpretation of the motif of these three figures has been argued by Étienne de la Vaissière, proposing it to be the earliest repre sentation of Manichaean elects in Chinese art. He contends that their "loose long garments and tripartite tall hats are without any iconographical parallel in contemporary mixed Northern Chinese Society" (2015: 98). He acknowledges the general similarity to the robes and tall hats of Chinese of ficials, but contends that the specific form of the hat is unprecedented among such Chinese digni taries. For comparison, he points to depictions of headgear in Uygur Manichaean manuscript il lumination from tenth-century Kocho (e.g., MIK III 4979 recto). In relation to the smooth conical headgear of the figure on the right in the carving, he points to tall black hats in the Uygur paint ing and states, "Le parallèle est absolutement exact pour les robes at les tiares." In relation to the headgear of the other two figures he sees a less exact match with the tall white hats worn by male elect in the Uygur Manichaean painting: "mais n'est qu'approché pour les coiffes trilobées: les coiffes des electi de Turfan possèdent une par tie centrale plus large et de meme hauteur que les parties laterals, tandis que sur le relief de Xi'an le lobe centrale dépasse les autres" (2005c: 360). He explains the differences by the four centuries that separate the two images.22 His interpretation has been adopted by Grenet (2007: 475). The above argument faces numerous problems. Firstly, it must be noted that there is no evidence about how Manichaean elect dressed during the 6th century, or if they wore headgear of any kind. It should not be assumed that their garments al ready took their later-documented forms. Men in loose long garments and tall hats are ubiquitous in Chinese art during the 6th century, and most often represent courtiers or other official dignitar ies. Indeed, it is quite likely that the "classic" sac 6</page><page sequence="7">gulàcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi Prophecy of Sosans Scene Prophecy of Sosans Scene Fig. 3. Interpretation of Panel 1. After Yang 2014, figs. 103, 104. erdotal garments of the elect seen later in Uygur art originated from such traditional Chinese garb of the non-laborer intelligentsia. Secondly, the quasi-frontal portrayal of what de la Vaissière calls the "tri-lobed" or "tripartite" hats, worn by the inner and middle figures in this motif on the sarcophagus, is different from the tall headgear of male elect depicted in Uygur manuscript illumination to which he compares it. The latter (1) does not have a bottom rim, (2) has a distinctly four-sided construction with a solid front of the same height as the rest of the headgear, and thus (3) culminates in an even flat top. Shown from a three-quarter view in Turf an Manichaean painting, only the front and one side of the Manichaean hat are visible, which is unlike what is carved on Wirkak's sarcophagus. In that carving, the design in question, seen from the front, consists of a prominent rim and three un even components, which gently curve backwards, including a protruding tall middle panel flanked by two recessed and shorter side panels. The head dress of Chinese court officials with a comparable design is documented on a high-quality Buddhist relief carving from 6th-century Longmen that portrays Emperor Xiaowen and His Court, dated to 522-523 c.e., in the collection of the Metro politan Museum of Art in New York.23 Thirdly, the Manichaean identification of the third hat on Wirkak's sarcophagus—a conical, single-pointed hat that has a prominent rim—is also problematic. The headgear seen in an Uygur Manichaean manuscript illumination, to which de la Vaissière compares the former, is a black rounded-top tall fez of a simple local design with a rimless smooth body (accessorized with a pur ple-brown scarf) worn by what appear to be two young novices, who are already dressed in sacer dotal white robes, but still have what appear to be lay belts and lay hats.24 In contrast, the third cap on the Wirkak carving compares more favor ably to the tapering design and rolled rim of the tall felt hats seen on Tang terracotta figurines of Sogdian traders.25</page><page sequence="8">gulâcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi Fourthly, the robes of the three figures on Wirkak's sarcophagus also cannot be equated with the garments of the elect from Uygur Manichaean art. When shown in an active pose (such as hold ing a book or gesturing during a sermon) the rather roomy sleeves are always tight around the elect's wrist.26 In contrast, on the Wirkak carving, the hands of the inner figure are actively posed in prayer, but protrude from extremely wide sleeves, which look similar to what is seen on the robes of courtiers in the above-mentioned relief carving from 6th-century Longmen in New York. There fore, one must conclude that the three figures in question most likely represent two Chinese courtiers in the company of a Sogdian merchant. 3. Encounter between Predators and Prey A large scene depicting a placid encounter be tween predators and prey in a bucolic setting is found on panel 1, where it occupies the lower two thirds of the carving surface (fig. 3bj. In this landscape, the foreground features a body of wa ter. The rest shows human beings, seated on their heels with hands clasped in prayer, and animals calmly lying on their bellies—all arranged in groups facing each other along the banks of a meandering stream. The visually most promi nent group consists of five men in the lower left. Further away in the upper left are what appear to be a male and a female lion (or a lion and a wolf). On the other side of the stream, the rest of the composition features five herbivores (boar, deer, mountain goat, reindeer, and another deer like animal), and three men that are shown fur ther away from the stream at the right edge of the carving, as discussed above. It is important to note the compositional integ rity of this scene in relation to the upper scene of this panel. These two scenes are visually sepa rated from one another by actual lines that are formed by the curving edge the lotus throne of the deity and a curving line that defines the area where Wirkak and Wiyusi are seated, and implied lines that are introduced by the direction of the figures' gazes and body positions. While the upper scene is organized radially centered on the deity, the lower scene by contrast is arranged sym metrically along a vertical axis with the animal and human beings facing toward each other. The two compositions show no visual ties and thus, remain separate from one another, forming two independent compositional units on this panel. A Manichaean interpretation of this scene has been raised solely by default. Building on de la Vaissière's earlier argument for Manichaean ele ments in the sarcophagus reliefs, Frantz Grenet has extended that interpretation to this scene, contending that "The respect for living crea tures and the abstinence from eating meat was a common tenet of Buddhism and Manichaeism" (2007: 475). In turn, de la Vaissière has embraced Grenet's observation, and declared such a theme to be "foreign to Zoroastrianism" (2015: 98). These statements are left undeveloped by both scholars, and the Manichaean interpretation of the scene is implicit only in the context of their remarks. These broad generalizations, however, can not be supported in light of historical evidence. While both Buddhism and Manichaeism enjoin non-violence toward animals, neither historically prohibited eating meat—Manichaeism did so only for the elect, not for laypeople, while Bud dhism had no prohibition for either monastics or laypeople. Moreover, Manichaeism foresees no future harmony with animals of the sort depicted in the scene. Animals are part of the evil creation in Manichaeism, "abortions" of demonesses.27 Not only predators but also their prey are murder ers and suppressors of the light, the one by con sumption of other animals, the other by eating plants. Animals do not join humans in salvation, and Manichaeans look forward to being free of the sound of animals in Heaven.28 4. Sage in a Cave The motif of a sage in a cave is located on panel 8, where it occupies the upper third of the carving (fig. 4a). It belongs to a symmetrically composed scene set in a forested mountainous landscape framed by flowering trees. Directly on the right of the vertical axis is a visually dominant oval shaped entrance to a cave where a figure in profile is shown with the characteristic Indie iconog raphy of a sage—unclothed and emaciated up per body, pointed beard, long hair, and hair bun. The body of the sage is seated casually with legs crossed and gesturing with right hand to a small four-legged animal with a tail that looks like a monkey. Bowing to the sage, this animal is shown 8</page><page sequence="9">g u L a c s i and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi Two Scenes of Panel 8 Two Scenes a: Komayaputta Jataka Scene b: Eschatological Resurrection (Ristaxez) ScenT"] of Panel 8 Fig. 4. Interpretation of Panel 8. After Yang 2014: figs. 138, 139. next to a meager food ration, symbolized by a jar and a small bundle placed at the sage's feet, per haps suggesting that the animal provided these alms. The animal's pose of worship and the sage's interaction with this animal introduce an aspect of humor to this scene. A Manichaean interpretation of the sage in a cave motif has been put forward by Étienne de la Vaissière (2005c: 362; and 2015: 101-3). In his ini tial study, de la Vaissière (2005c: 362) focuses only on the figure of the ascetic, identifying him as Mani in a single sentence, because Mani is some times called "the great ascetic."29 It is primarily the Manichaean reading of the rest of panel 8 that shaped de la Vaissière's argument, despite the fact that the "Mani" in this panel looks nothing like the other "Mani" he sees in panel 1. In a more re cent study, de la Vaissière adds to his argument by citing a story about Mani in a cave from Marwazi (2015: 101-3). The latter story is first attested in the Book on the Nature of Living Beings (Ar. Tabä'i' al-hayawän) completed around 1120 c.e. by Sharaf al-Zaman Tahir al-MarwazI (ca. 1056 after 1120 c.e.). In this polemical story, Mani fools his followers about the origin of his Book of Pictures (Ar. Arthang) by faking a heavenly trip and a divine gift. Standard elements of this story mention Mani traveling through China, finding a remote cave in the mountains, secretly storing enough food for a year, telling his followers that God summoned him for a year, descending into the cave to create the remarkable painted book, after a year emerging from the cave with the painted book, claiming it to be a gift from God, and convincing his followers, through its amaz ing beauty, that he is a true prophet.30 Several facts contradict the thesis that the sage in a cave motif seen on Wirkak's sarcophagus is a representation of the story of Mani in a cave. Firstly, the story of Mani in a cave is not a Man ichaean story, but a polemical anti-Manichaean one. It is not known from any primary Manichaean</page><page sequence="10">gulàcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi texts, and would not have been familiar to Man ichaeans during the 6th century, for it is first at tested across the Iranian cultural region starting from about 600 years after the sarcophagus was made. Secondly, key elements of the polemical cave story are missing from the sarcophagus: the latter shows neither a group of people, who in the Islamic story come to greet Mani when he emerges from the cave, nor any book (a picture book) with which Mani emerges from the cave falsely claiming it as his prophet wonder. Thirdly, singling out one motif without explaining it with the other motifs from this scene is methodologi cally problematic, since it leaves key elements of this iconography unaccounted for, including the animal prostrating itself before the ascetic, the ascetic's engagement in conversation with this animal, as well as the Indie iconography of the ascetic. 5. Angelic Rescue A salvation scene occupies the lower two-thirds of the carving surface on panel 8 (fig. 4b). This scene has a symmetrical composition that features five figures in a landscape: a man and a woman (pos sibly symbolizing Wirkak and Wiyusi), who are being pulled from a body of water; two winged females, who are pulling the couple from the wa ter while hovering in the air; and a third winged female, who is portrayed as the main figure of this scene descending along the vertical axis in between two hills. She is holding what has been interpreted as a crown, but is more likely a footed plate, in her right hand and a vase with a flower (or possibly water bubbling or splashing out) in her left hand. A Manichaean reading of this scene has been put forward by Étienne de la Vaissière (2005c: 361 and 2015: 104), who has interpreted it as an angelic rescue from the "Ocean of Rebirth"—an originally Buddhist concept whose phraseology is adopted in some Central Asian and Chinese Manichaean texts. As the first component of his argument, de la Vaissière interprets the waters from which the two human figures are plucked by their winged rescuers as "an image of the Ocean of rebirth with its makaia common to Buddhism and Manichaeism but totally foreign to Zoro astrianism" (2015: 98). He draws attention to a Buddhist analogy of the layout of the entire panel to be seen in a narrative banner from Dunhuang (2005c: 361 ).31 Grenet agrees that "Iconographi cally, as de la Vaissière has shown, the compo sition derives from Buddhist models attested in Dunhuang: here the future Buddha, exhausted by fasting, is rescued by the gods, who bathe him in an invigorating river" (2007: 476). Both de la Vaissière and Grenet go on to note that, despite this artistic parallel, key differences of detail render the meaning completely different on the sarcophagus, wherein they see a rescue of Wirkak and Wiyusi from the sea of samsara. De la Vais sière cites Parthian Manichaean funerary hymns from approximately the same time period as the sarcophagus, containing references to both roiling seas and terrible beasts (2005c: p. 361 n.l 1). These are valid conceptual parallels. Yet, even in these hymns, the imagery is derived from Buddhism, so the question remains, what makes the imagery on the sarcophagus Manichaean instead of Bud dhist? De la Vaissière's answer is the wings on the rescuing figures, atypical for Buddhism (2005c: 361-62). The second component of his argument is based on a supposed partial match between the implements carried by two of these three winged figures (which he sees as a crown and a vase with a flower in the right and left hands, respectively, of the upper figure, and a piece of clothing in the right hand of the lower left figure) and those car ried by three deities (drinking vessel, clothing, headcloth, crown, diadem) accompanying the "Wise Guide" to greet the deceased in a passage of Al-Nadim's Fihiist (2005c: 362-63). The Fihiist passage, however, does not provide a relevant point of comparison with this scene, since it regards the post-mortem experience of an elect—that is, a member of the Manichaean sac erdotal class, whereas laypeople such as Wirkak and Wiyusi would have a completely different fate. Even setting aside this most basic problem with de la Vaissière's argument, a number of other problems beset his use of the Fihrist in the interpretation of this panel. The main figure of Al-Nadim's passage, the "Wise Guide," is missing from the scene. More over, unlike in Al-Nadim's description, only the main winged figure carries any implements, while the other two are shown as agents of rescue. They are portrayed in a symmetrical arrangement punctuated by time, their hands reaching toward the human beings in order to pull them from the Water one after the other. Their respective inner 10</page><page sequence="11">gulâcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi hands grab hold of the humans, while their outer hands swing down to complete their grip. The angel on the right is further along in its rescue, its outer hand almost touching its subject, who is already almost fully out of the water (knee-deep). The angel on the left is only beginning to swing its outer hand forward, and so its rescuee is still mostly in the water (waist-deep).32 No such ac tion of rescue is involved in the less dramatic and more placid description in the Fihrist passage. In addition, the objects de le Vaissière sees brought by the winged figures actually do not match Al-Nadim's list, which he cites in com parison. Al-Nadim does not mention a vase and flower, while the image does not show the drink ing vessel, headcloth, or diadem mentioned by Al-Nadim. As noted above, it is doubtful that the right hand of the lower left winged figure carries any implements, such as clothing, eliminating one of the only two points of connection between the carving and the Fihrist. Whether the only remaining matching object is indeed a crown is also debatable. Its design does not compare to the designs of crowns (panels a-c), but rather to that of large footed plates (panel /) depicted in the bio graphical scenes of this sarcophagus. The manner in which it is held also better compares to the way footed vessels are handled in other scenes of the sarcophagus (panels c, d, and /), as well as in the depiction of a large footed drinking vessel held by a merchant in a Sogdian banquette scene pre served on a mural fragment from 7th/8th-century Panjikent in the collection of the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.33 There are additional problems with the argu ments for a Manichaean interpretation of this scene. While it is true that wings on superhuman beings are atypical in Buddhist art, they are a stan dard feature of Iranian art generally, so they cannot be used as an identifying feature of Manichaean art. The assertion that monstrous makaia figures in roiling waters do not belong to Zoroastrian im agery is belied by the use of precisely these mo tifs to symbolize Hell beneath the Cinwad Bridge elsewhere on this sarcophagus (panel 10). Finally, despite the appearance of the isolated poetic ex pression "rescuing from the ocean of rebirth" in some Manichaean texts influenced by Buddhist concepts, there is actually no such soteriologi cal moment in Manichaean belief corresponding to the scene depicted here. In other words, Man ichaeism does not imagine laypeople being pulled from a physical or spiritual ocean by angelic res cuers at any point in their progress towards salva tion.34 Based on the above, therefore, a Manichaean interpretation of this scene cannot be sustained. 6. Admittance to Paradise A scene located on the upper half of panel 9 shows a couple (symbolizing the souls of Wirkak and Wiyusi after death) greeted as travelers who have just arrived, seated on their heels holding a footed plate and a drinking cup, respectively (fig. 5b). They are greeted by three beings, the leader of whom is winged, while each of the other two hold objects in one hand. This reception takes place below the formal, frontal image of a deity— dressed in a long belted robe, wearing a scarfed tiara, seated regally with legs crossed on a bull throne, holding a small trident in the right hand, and resting the left hand just above the knee also in a regal manner. This divine figure is enclosed in a mandorla flanked by two winged attendants who stretch a billowing scarf above it. A Manichaean interpretation of this scene has been put forward by Étienne de la Vaissière, fo cusing on iconographical elements that he regards as "divergent" from a Zoroastrian interpretation put forward by Grenet, Riboud, and Yang. In de la Vaissière's view, Wirkak and Wiyusi are greeted by three female figures that he interprets as "the three deities" of Al-Nadim's Fihrist (2005c: 362 63), who accompany the "Wise Guide" bringing a drinking vessel, clothing, headcloth, crown, and diadem, which the soul receives before ascending to Heaven. He finds reference to a flower as a gift for the deceased in another Manichaean text.35 He notes that, while not all the elements of the Manichaean teaching on the post-mortem fate of the soul are present, "la plupart des details de la composition sont néanmoins précisément mani chéens" (2005c: 363). Expanding upon the above claim, Guitty Az arpy has designated this scene as the "judgment of the soul" (2011: 61), in which she sees the deity in the mandorla as the judge, Wirkak and Wiyusi as the plaintiffs, and the three winged females as the Light Maiden with two attendants (and not the three deities that accompany the "Wise Guide" in the Fihrist) who come to intervene on behalf of the plaintiffs (2011: 63-66). She introduces ar tistic sources not only against Frantz Grenet's 11</page><page sequence="12">guläcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi interpretation of the main winged female as the Zoroastrian Den, but also in favor of identifying it as the Manichaean Light Maiden, comparing it to the 13th-century Chinese Manichaean silk painting, Sermon on Mani's Teaching of Salva tion, in which the Light Maiden appears with two attendants. Writing in 2015, but without ref erencing Azarpay, de la Vaissière similarly com pares the judgment scenes on two of the Chinese Manichaean paintings (discovered after his ini tial publication), which he considers "strikingly similar to the one depicted on Wirkak's panel" (2015: 100). He contends that "the assistants of the Daênâ," (under which he seems to mean the three assistants of the "Wise Guide")36 hold the same items on both the sarcophagus and the above-mentioned Chinese paintings ("a vase and a flower" 2015: 100). None of these interpretations, however, can be supported in light of what is known today from Manichaean teachings about the post-mortem ex periences of the dead. In Manichaean canonical art, scenes depicting Mani's instructions about judgment after death constitute one of the most extensively attested and best-understood subjects. They are documented for Mani's Book of Pic tures by early texts and, starting from around the 9th/10th century, also survive (separately from picture books) as modified versions of canonical scenes incorporated into Uygur illuminated ser vice books in 10th-century Kocho and Chinese hanging scrolls in 13th/14th-centuries southern China.37 Based on the evidence preserved in such primary sources, the argument for a Manichaean iconography of judgment in the portrayal of the three beings facing Wirkak and Wiyusi beneath the image of the deity cannot be maintained. Firstly, key elements of Manichaean judgment iconography are missing from Wirkak's sarcopha gus. On the one hand, the couple in the carving are not shown as plaintiffs. They are neither humili ated by being stripped to their loincloths, nor do they express signs of fear. Rather, they are shown elegantly attired and at ease in a festive setting. On the other hand, the iconography of the office of a judge is also missing from Wirkak. There are no raised fingers, canes, and evidence of past sin as seen in Uygur Manichaean images,- nor are there any desks, clerical aids, and evidence of past sin as seen in Chinese Manichaean art. Therefore, the deity portrayed here cannot be equated with the figures of judges in Manichaean art. Secondly, the deity highest in the picture plane is meant to be in the sky, that is, above the couple on the right and the three greeters on the left be low him. This arrangement bears only a superfi cial similarity to judgment imagery seen on the Chinese Manichaean Diagram of the Universe, where the judge is shown higher on the picture plane in order to signal his distance on the ground plane, that is, a location in the background in re lation to the plaintiff on the right and the Light Maiden and her two attendants on the left, in the foreground.38 Such a symmetrical composition is characteristic only of late Manichaean art pro duced in Ningbo heavily influenced by Chinese Buddhist iconography and workshop practices.39 Buddhist influence on the depiction of Man ichaean judgment is attested only from 13th/14th centuries southern China—some 600 years after the sarcophagus. In fact, the earliest Buddhist de pictions of the Kings of Hell that come to influ ence Chinese Manichaean judgment iconography are also quite late, dating from 10th-century Dun huang and 12th-century Ningbo, which Wirkak and Wiyusi precede by 400-600 years.40 The ar gument that this part of panel 9 depicts a Man ichaean judgment, therefore, cannot be accepted. Moreover, an undisputed reference to judgment already appears just below this subscene by show ing Wirkak and his family successfully crossing the Zoroastrian Cinwad Bridge.41 Finally, it is also problematic to equate the winged figure facing Wirkak and Wiyusi with the Light Maiden. Undoubtedly, in Manichaean teaching the primary function of this deity con cerns the early stages of personal salvation,- and accordingly, she is described and depicted to ap pear to the righteous elect at the start of their af terlife (with the task of ferrying their souls to the Realm of Light).42 The Light Maiden, however, is not a winged deity—she is neither described nor portrayed as such in Manichaean sources. Depictions of her three angelic (i.e., winged) and gift-bearing attendants do not survive among the currently known remains of Manichaean art. The iconic portraits of the Light Maiden in Uygur Manichaean art do not show such attendants. Her depictions in didactic images of judgment in Chinese Manichaean art show her with two attendants who are not only wingless, but also (contra de la Vaissière) carry objects (vase with a flower and a banner) different from both what is described by primary Manichaean texts and 12</page><page sequence="13">guläcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi From Death to Paradise (Garodman) Scene c: Riding into Garôdmân Subscene • b: Admittance to Paradise Subscene (panel 11) I (panels 9-10, upper half) a: Death Ritual and Judgment after Death Subscene (panels 9-10, lower half) From Death to Paradise (Garodman) Scene c: Riding into Garodman Subscene a b: Admittance to Paradise Subscene (panel 11) (panels 9-10, upper half) a: Death Ritual and Judgment after Death Subscene (panels 9-10, lower half) Fig. 5.

A Winged Figure, a Falling Figure, and a Pair of Winged Horses In the upper half of panel 10; three motifs have been considered as Manichaean elements of the sarcophagus (fig. 5b). In the upper right, a winged figure, carrying a small object in the left hand, is shown flying ahead of a pair of winged horses. Directly below, is a unique falling figure, dressed in a long robe with hair piled up into a topknot, pointedly portrayed facing away from the viewer. A Manichaean interpretation of the two anthro pomorphic figures was proposed by Étienne de la Vaissière, making use of the description of the post-mortem experience of the elect taken from Manichaean sources by Al-Nadim in his Fihrist (2005c: 362-63), wherein the "Wise Guide" comes with three deities, turning back approach ing devils from the soul of the deceased, while the latter's body is cast down into the darkness. He contends that the winged figure holds in its hand "un petite personnage" (2005c: 362), which he proposes represents the soul of Wirkak (2005c: 364). While recognizing that no Manichaean text describes the soul as a homunculus, he notes that various Gnostic texts do (2005c: 364-65), and Buddhist art in the Pure Land tradition also uses miniature human forms to represent those reborn in the Pure Land (p. 365 n. 23). But he adds an alternative interpretation, suggested to him in an oral communication by Frantz Grenet, that the small figure could symbolize the "Last Statue," a concept from Manichaean world eschatology, rather than the individual eschatology of the post-mortem experience (2005c: 365)—a sugges tion Grenet has put into print in his subsequent article (2007: 475-76). In his own later article, de la Vaissière continues to maintain both possibil ities, either the Last Statue or the soul of Wirkak (2015: 100 and 110), and compares the small ob ject held in the angel's hand to the small heads held in the hands of the Light Maiden in the Chi nese Manichaean Diagram of the Universe (2015: 110). Concerning the falling figure, de la Vaissière en tertains the idea that it might represent Wirkak's body, in line with the Fihrist passage; but goes on to note that, since it has a topknot, and Wirkak is never shown with one, one must look for a dif ferent interpretation (2005c: 364).43 The iconog raphy is that of an apsara, and he gives examples of similar ones in falling postures from Dunhuang (2005c: pi. 5, figs. 4 and 5). Since apsaras at times represent sensuality, he suggests that the figure is meant to represent Az or Concupiscence, a pri mary demonic being in Manichaean mythology (2005c: 364), shown here being driven off from Wirkak's soul by the winged figure.44 Grenet has adopted de la Vaissière's interpretation by see ing in these motifs "the fall of the woman who is apparently threatened by a heavenly creature brandishing a small human statue" (2007: 474), claiming that in Manichaean eschatology, "Con cupiscence in human shape will fall from heaven and be thrown on the ground" (2007: 475-76). These interpretations, however, cannot be sup ported in light of what is known today about Man ichaean art and doctrine. Firstly, the small object held by the winged figure cannot be explained as the Manichaean eschatological concept known as the Last Statue. Depictions of the Last Statue are undocumented in Manichaean art and text about art. As already pointed out by Gunner Mik kelsen, this entity is discussed only in doctrinal texts about the end of time, which is incongru ous with the subject matter of this entire wall of the sarcophagus (2016: 122). Furthermore, it also appears implausible that the small figure could be meant to represent the soul of Wirkak, which is shown in the previous panel at full size, equal to the winged figure. His soul is again shown at full size in the subsequent panel, riding a winged horse in ascent to Paradise. Moreover, in both of these subscenes flanking the one under consid eration, he appears alongside of the soul of his wife, Wiyusi, not alone. Indeed, it must be ques tioned if the small object is a human form at all. If it was such in the exemplar used by the art ist who carved the sarcophagus, the latter failed to render it distinctly. Rather, one might suspect an anthropomorphic illusion on the part of its modern viewers, and that instead it is a small, lidded jar, perhaps meant to indicate the elixir of immortality. Secondly, the identification of the falling fig ure as Az, while not an implausible choice in a Manichaean context, has nothing to recommend it here, on a sarcophagus where other supposed 14</page><page sequence="15">gulâcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi Manichaean features have proved to be illusory. We do not possess any comparative Manichaean iconography of Az, and indeed it cannot be safely assumed that this figure in the carving is repre sented as female, since the long robes and top knot also typical of male figures in Buddhist art of this period. Any interpretation of this figure, therefore, depends entirely on the overall icono graphie program within which it is read. Finally, the pair of horses brings us to yet an other problem stemming from isolating motifs and interpreting them without their narrative context of their scenes. Both Grenet (Grenet, Ri boud, and Yang 2004: 283; and Grenet 2007: 474) and de la Vaissière (2015: 99) separate the winged figure from the two winged horses seen together in the scene on the upper part of panel 10, despite the fact that they are visually linked not only by neighboring one another, but also by flying into the same direction (towards the right). Instead, they arbitrarily treat these two horses as belong ing to the final scene on panel 11, where all fig ures are shown flying in an opposite direction, that is, towards the left. Taking the two winged horses from the latter scene in combination with the two from the previous scene, they explain them as a four-horse team pulling the (omitted) chariot of the sun-god. But, in fact, the two horses in panel 11 cannot be part of a quadriga, because they have riders—a man and a woman evidently representing the souls of Wirkak and Wiyusi. The context of their ride, surrounded by heavenly musicians, clearly references their entrance into Garödmän, the "House of Song" Paradise of Zo roastrianism.45 In light of this last scene of the sarcophagus, therefore, the two winged horses in the previous panel almost certainly represent the same two horses being led to Wirkak and Wiyusi, who await their rides in the reception scene on panel 9. Zoroastrian Identification of the Religious Scenes The above arguments raise serious doubts about the previously proposed Manichaean identifica tions of nine motifs spread through the religious panels of the sarcophagus. New interpretations are needed, therefore, for the five scenes impacted. Our proposals build on previous scholarship that noted clear Zoroastrian iconography in the carv ings, and take their initial identifications further in a comprehensive reading of the religious imag ery within a Central Asian cultural environment where Zoroastrianism, in a popular and Sogdian form, intersected with popular Buddhist artistic traditions. 1. The Prophecy of Sosans Scene Encountered as the first scene along the left wall of the sarcophagus, the carving on panel 1 por trays a Zoroastrian prophecy about a Paradise like ideal future of the world ruled by a "savior" named Sosans (fig. 3). This interpretation of the subject matter is gained through a complemen tary reading of two subscenes—one in the upper one-third and the other in the lower two-thirds of this panel. All scholars agree that the iconography of the main figure of the upper subscene employs a Buddhist-looking visual language (fig. 3a). The topknot, the monk's robe with one shoulder bare, the pose of the body, the lotus seat, the mandorla, and the overall setting demonstrate this. While the topknot, the robe, and the lotus seat suggest a Buddha, other elements seem to point to the bodhisattva Maitreya. The informal sitting posi tion with legs loosely crossed, the forward lean ing upper body with neck and head at an angle to the torso, and the right hand raised close to the face all approximate the pensive pose (Ch. siwei) that had become standard in Maitreya images.46 Since the cult of Maitreya was at its height dur ing the time of Wirkak across East Central Asia and China, such images were readily available as artistic resources.47 The iconography of the figure in this subscene, however, is clearly differentiated from Maitreya images through features that reference prestige from the visual language of late Sasanian art of Iran. Firstly, as commented upon by others, facial hair distinguishes this figure. He is shown bearded. But beards are used most sparingly in Buddhist art—never for an enlightened being (Buddha) and rarely for someone on the way to reaching it (bo dhisattva). In Iranian art, beards signal dignity and prestige in the iconography of gods and monarchs, who also wear mustaches. This figure, too, has a prominent horizontally straight mustache, con sisting of a pair of long and thick whiskers pulled straight to the side. While mustaches are frequent 15</page><page sequence="16">gulâcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkalc and Wiyusi in Kushan (and some early Chinese) bodhisattva and even Buddha images, none is quite as promi nent as this. This mustache design is comparable to what is seen as an attribute of kings in late Sa sanid coinage and metal ware around Wirkak's time.48 The distinctive combination of a straight mustache with a pointed short beard is also com parable to a nagaraja image that survives from 6th/7th-century Peshawar.49 Secondly, a unique right-hand gesture also distinguishes this figure. Whereas Maitreya's characteristic mudra typically touches the face in the siwei pose, the hand on Wirkak's sarcophagus does not. The latter holds a different gesture, in which the middle two fingers are folded down while the first and fourth fingers are not.50 This gesture communicates "victory" in Iranian art as first identified by Carol Brem berg and later supported with further evidence by Frantz Grenet as part of his interpretation the fig ure in question.51 Whichever way the first finger was intended to be carved, this composition repre sents not the idle, lost-in-thought siwei pose, but a communicative gesture conveying a meaning to the group of people seated around the main figure in this subscene.52 The identification of this sermonizing deity (as well as the overall scene portrayed on this panel) would remain beyond our grasp, were it not for the message conveyed below it in the lower subscene (fig. 3b). As noted above, the theme of a cessation of hunting, and a resulting harmony of predators and prey, such that "the lion lies down with the lamb," is not predicated for the future in Man ichaeism. Buddhists told stories of humans aiding animals, rather than hunting and killing them, as reflections of the ethic of compassion,- but for hu mans to be joined in this compassion by animal predators is not an expectation of Buddhism, un less perhaps as a condition of a Pure Land. Zoro astrian belief, however, explicitly taught that the future would bring about a cessation of hunting and the eating of meat. Zoroastrianism of the Sasanian era taught the imminent coming of three successors to Zara thustra, reinforcing and reforming spiritual life and combating evil. In the time of the second of these, Usëdarmâh, hunger decreases, such that, "when fifty-three years of that millennium of his remain, the sweetness and oiliness in milk and vegetables are so complete that, on account of the freedom of mankind from wanting meat, they shall leave off the eating of meat, and their food becomes milk and vegetables" (Dênkaid 7.10.8). In the following millennium comes the third suc cessor, Sosans. During his first fifty-seven years, there are "seventeen years of vegetable eating, thirty years of water drinking, and ten years of spiritual food" (Dënkaid 7.11.4), culminating in the Renovation (fiasegiid), when "the whole of the good creation is provided with purity and per fect splendor" [Dênkaid 7.11.7). The Bundahisn compares this gradual withdrawal from meat and then solid food altogether to a dying person's loss of interest in food, and as a reversal of the first hu mans gradually expanding their diet (30.1). This passage continues as follows: Thus, too, in the millennium of Usëdarmâh, the strength of appetite (azj will so diminish that men will be sated for three days and nights by eating one single meal. And then after [that], they will desist [from] meat food, and will eat vegetables and drink the milk of ani mals; and then, they will abstain even from [that] milk diet, [and then] they will abstain even from vegetable food, and will be drinking water, and ten years before Sosyans will come they will remain without food, and will not die (Bundahisn 30.2-3; facs. 221.5-11, tr. 283-85).53 Other Zoroastrian literature speaks of the proc lamation of an edict in that time forbidding the killing of animals: Asavahist will come on earth with the cooperation of the messenger Airyaman, and will demonstrate to the creatures, as regards the grievous sinfulness of smit ing the species of animals and giving them the least injury . . . When it will be near to the performance of the Renovation, the listeners of Asavahist's mandate will then turn away from slaughtering animals and eat ing flesh [Vizïdagihâ 1 Zädspiam, tr. B. T. Anklesaria, 1964: 34.38-39). This injunction appears to be the "ordinance of Sosans . . . which sets aside distress from the creatures, and gives the ordinance to the whole material existence, that which is living and also that which is dead," and characterized as his "tri umph" (Dênkaid 9.58.10). Hence, the scene in the lower portion of panel 1 does have an inter pretation within the same religion that is refer enced on the rest of the sarcophagus. With the significance of the lower part of the panel identified, we may now consider the pos sibility that its subject illuminates the identity of the figure in the upper part of the panel, as a rep 16</page><page sequence="17">gulâcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi resentation of Sosans. In Zoroastrian literature, Sosans is consistently given the epithet "trium phant, victorious" (saosyant- wdidOrajan-, Yast 13.128-29; 13.145; 19.89; Yasna 26.10; Denkard 7.10.17; 7.11.1). As noted above, the hand gesture of the figure has been identified as an Iranian sym bol for triumph or victory, and so may be intended to communicate this epithet or quality of Sosans. It is also said of him in Zoroastrian sources that his body is as radiant as the sun (Dênkaid 7.11.2), that he bears the glory (xwanah, 7.11.3, cf. Yast 19.89), and indeed "all the splendor, glory, and power which have arisen in all those possessing splendor, glory, and power" (7.11.5). Hence the adoption of a mandorla in his iconography, as well as the gilding that apparently covered him from head to toe, would be appropriate. The pos ture of the figure likewise reflects what is said of him, that "he will gaze with the eyes of wisdom, he will behold all creation; he will gaze with the eyes of sacrifice upon the whole corporeal world, and heedfully will he make the whole world un dying" (Yast 19.92-94). Seeking to portray Sosans, a Zoroastrian Sog dian community in 6th-century China would naturally have recourse to the iconography of the parallel Buddhist figure, Maitreya. With a few small changes (beard, gesture of triumph), they could adapt Maitreya's iconography to suitably communicate their own anticipation of a future Utopian existence, overseen by a foreordained en lightener. Maitreya's own future Pure Land (Skt. Ketuvati) has many similarities to the perfected world expected by Zoroastrians, including fantas tic physical health and vigor and immunity from any of the present world's evils. By implication, it is also a land where people have given up past bad conduct, wherein "they killed, ate flesh, and drank blood." In fact, the classic description of Maitreya's coming and establishment of this Pure Land, the Maitreyavyäkarana, is given the alter native title, "Sutra of the Mind of Lovingkind ness, Not Killing and Not Eating Flesh" in the Chinese translation made by Kumarajiva in the early 5 th century. 2. Komayaputta Jataka Scene The scene that centers on the interaction between a sage in a cave and a monkey on the upper third of panel 8 may be best explained as the depiction of a jätaka story (fig. 4a). The Indie iconography along with the fable-like subject matter of this carving evokes a genre of popular tales preserved in collections such as the Pancatantra, Avadana, and Jätaka literature. Fairy tales of Indian origin together with animal fables and stories about wise judges were known in Sogdian folklore through direct contact with India, as well as by encounters with Indian merchants, both Hindu and Buddhist, across the Silk Routes.54 The closest match to the iconography of this scene is found in the Komäyaputta Jätaka. In the latter tale, a monkey is a regular visitor to a cave, whose antics entertain a group of men dicants who reside there. When the mendicants depart, the monkey's behavior annoys the cave's new occupant named Komäyaputta, who snaps his fingers to get the monkey's attention and then proceeds to teach it self-discipline and vir tue with great success. Following Komäyaputta's instructions the monkey becomes well-behaved and virtuous, and states: The words of highest wisdom have I heard From sage renowned, Komäyaputta called; Pray deem me not the same as I ere was, For now I live a meditative life.55 The carving on this sarcophagus reflects this jätaka in three regards: it shows a cave set in a mountainous landscape, an ascetic (whose hand gesture may represent the snapping of fingers) in teracting with a monkey, and a monkey submit ting to the ascetic's instruction. Keeping the focus on the core of the story, the group of mendicants is omitted from the carving. The lesson of the tale together with its humor is captured effectively on the sarcophagus by showing the ability of even a previously undisciplined and light-hearted in dividual, represented by the monkey, to acquire self-discipline and earnestness, and advance in virtue. This message, with its humble self-depre cation, may have seemed appropriate to Wirkak and Wiyusi in the closing years of their life, after the high life they had enjoyed, as attested in the directly preceding biographical panels. The choice of this scene as one of the subjects portrayed on the walls of Wirkak's and Wiyusi's eternal resting place might be explained not only by the employment of artists with experience in rendering scenes of Buddhist content, but also either their personal contact with popular Bud dhism or the secular circulation of such tales in 17</page><page sequence="18">gulâcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi Central Asian popular culture familiar to Wirkak and Wiyusi from Sogdian folklore. They may have encountered the story in the latter form, since it is widely thought that jätakas, and other literature of this kind, were adopted by Buddhists from popular tales of Indian folklore with wide circulation and secular use across South Asia. Artistic evidence for popular Buddhism that echoes the iconography of this scene is ubiqui tous among the wall paintings of 5th/7th-century Kizil, including motifs of monkeys in various moralistic roles and scenes of emaciated sages instructing animals, preserved both in situ56 and in the Central Asian collection of the Asian Art Museum in Berlin.57 Such murals confirm that Sogdian merchants passing through this part of the trade routes on their way to and from Xi'an were familiar with Indie stories and their distinct iconographie repertoire during the 6th century, and found their teachings relevant for their own lives.58 Such tales could be adapted readily for use in the context of any of the region's religions. 3. Eschatological Resurrection (Ristâxëz) Scene The lower scene of panel 8 clearly portrays a mo ment of rescue (fig. 4b). The interpretive question is: rescue from what? As noted above, Etienne de la Vaissière and Frantz Grenet have seen in the roiling waters from which Wirkak and Wi yusi are saved a representation of the "Ocean of Rebirth"—an originally Buddhist concept also attested in some Central Asian and Chinese Manichaean texts. But is that the only feasible ex planation in an iconographie program that is oth erwise predominantly Zoroastrian? Furthermore, how should one account for the redundancy with the adjacent scene that portrays Wirkak's and Wi yusi's post-mortem judgment and reception into Heaven in unmistakably Zoroastrian terms? There is a possible Zoroastrian explanation to what this scene represents. Zoroastrianism, which does not have a doctrine of rebirth or re incarnation, teaches about two distinct phases of the afterlife: an immediate post-mortem judg ment of the soul leading to residence in Heaven or Hell, and an eschatological physical resurrec tion (ristâxëz) of the body leading to an eternal existence in a perfected world where evil no lon ger exists. It is our contention that both of these teachings are on this sarcophagus. The post-mor tem judgment of the soul and its consequent fate is featured across panels 9-11 in the last scene of the carving program, as noted by Grenet and others. The scene on panel 8 offers a good candi date for a portrayal of the eschatological resurrec tion even though no other artistic renderings of this subject are known today in Iranian art. The scene on the sarcophagus employs a re gionally attested resurrection iconography—par tially exposed human forms reaching towards divine beings in the role of rescuers or agents of resurrection.59 Resurrection images in Jewish and Christian art of late antiquity typically feature the deceased standing (sometimes emerging from the ground or a coffin) with arms raised up toward supernatural agents, who are either a symbol for God (such as his hand), angels, or a savior figure such as Christ. Examples closest to the Sogdian world survive from 3rd-century Northern Meso potamia among the remains of Dura-Europos. The Ezekiel scene in the synagogue depicts the Valley of Dry Bones, where corpses and body parts await resurrection next to reanimated people with arms raised to the sky. Both the hand of God reaching from above and butterfly-winged female figures (usually interpreted as psyche s rather than angels) serve as agents of resurrection.60 Comparative ex amples from Christian art are all but nonexistent before the 8th century, when a fully developed standardized iconography of resurrection appears to suddenly emerge. It features Christ taking hold of a person's outreaching arms and pulling the figure from an open sarcophagus.61 The bap tistery of the Church at Dura offers the earliest example with Christ gripping the upreaching arm of Peter, half-submerged in water,- although ren dering an episode from the life of Christ, it may have been chosen for depiction in the baptistery for its symbolic resonances connecting baptism to salvation/resurrection.62 Alternative images may feature winged angels in the role of agents of resurrection, often by blowing trumpets over a landscape from which people emerge from the ground. A more direct similarity to the scene on the sarcophagus can be seen in a relief carving on a 5th century Coptic tombstone, now in the collection of the Ikonenmuseum in Recklinghau sen, where two angels lift up a partially emerged person by the head.63 The plausibility of a con nection between Christian art and the iconogra phy on the sarcophagus is strengthened by their 18</page><page sequence="19">guläcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi common symbolism of Hell. On the sarcopha gus (panel 10), as well as in Christian (and also in Manichaean) art, the figure of a sharp-toothed mouth of a monster waits to consume the falling soul.64 The resurrection iconography on this sarcoph agus is analogous to Jewish and Christian ex amples with the exception of the substance from which the dead rise, which here is what appears to be water rather than earth or the fires of Hell. Christian texts and works of art close to the time of Wirkak and Wiyusi did envision resurrection from the sea as well as the earth.65 Similarly, one Zoroastrian text, the Dädistän 1 dënïg, speaks of Ohrmazd gathering the dead from the dust of Mount Osdästär and the water of the river Arekd visur (37.118); while another, the Bundahisn, re fers to Ohrmazd reforming the body "which the wind has blown away and the water has dragged down" (34.4; facs. 222.13; tr. 285). But why is resurrection set in a fluid environment on this sarcophagus? Identical iconography of monster-infested wa ters appears below the Cinwad Bridge on panels 9 and 10, where it evidently symbolizes Dusox, the Zoroastrian Hell into which the damned fall from the bridge. The same imagery employed here, therefore, might be meant to convey the resurrection of the dead from Hell, which is part of the eschatological event in Zoroastrian belief. Yet, since only a single man and woman rise from their watery grave, it seems likely that they rep resent Wirkak and Wiyusi here, although one would not expect them to need rescue from Hell. Perhaps the carver made use of only part of an exemplar that had scenes of resurrection from various locations, choosing the watery one for use here to maintain the consistency of bodies of wa ter across the bottom of all of the religious panels on sarcophagus. Another possible explanation may be found in the Zoroastrian description of the eschatological purification of the dead (and indeed the whole earth) by a flood of molten metal.66 In the sum mation of Shaul Shaked: The metals within the earth will melt, and a river of molten metal will cover the earth. All humanity have to go through this fluid, which acts as another phase of mechanical judgment. The righteous feel the liquid metal like a bath of warm milk while the wicked suffer from the scorching heat. This incident in the drama of the universal eschatology serves the double purpose of reward and punishment as well as that of the purifica tion of the wicked from their evil.67 The lava "will remain on this earth like a river" (Bundahisn 34.18; facs. 225.7; tr. 289), and the res urrected will bathe in it for three days, purifying themselves of all sin, and in this way eradicate the last traces of evil from the renovated world (Dädistän i dênlg 37.110-111). The texts fail to describe how the resurrected bodies emerge from this river of molten metal. Zoroastrian literature says nothing about fravasis (the "guardian angels" of Zoroastrian belief) acting as agents of the resurrection, even though there is little doubt that the winged fe males in this scene represent such beings.68 The parallelism with the similar figures in the Admit tance to Paradise subscene (panels 9-10) perhaps suggests that these three winged figures may symbolize the promised comfort and fulfillment of the (in this case physical) afterlife. Or they might constitute an element of some otherwise undocumented eschatological ideas of Sogdian religious folklore. Or they might derive from ar tistic models applied to the Zoroastrian concept of resurrection without fully according with the latter. Either way, winged divine beings portrayed as the main motifs of a resurrection scene con stitute a core component in an iconography that effectively conveys a Zoroastrian eschatology on this sarcophagus. 4. From Death to Paradise (Garodman) Scene The final scene on this sarcophagus depicts the stages of the journey that leads the soul of the deceased from death to Paradise, shown across the combined surfaces of panels 9, 10 and 11 along the right wall of the sarcophagus, encoun tered last when accessing the narrative program clockwise (fig. 5). The complex subject of this large scene is narrated by organizing numerous motifs into three subscenes. They communicate the ideas of (1) death ritual and judgment after death, (2) admittance to Paradise, and (3) riding into the land of Paradise. In the expert opinion of Frantz Grenet, "most details of this scene on the eastern side, though not all, can be interpreted by comparison with Zoroastrian texts describing the journey of the soul after death" (2007: 472). 19</page><page sequence="20">guläcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi Although firm identifications for all elements of this afterlife depiction might not be possible at this stage of scholarship, a variety of Zoroastrian interpretations can be proposed for the as-yet un identified elements. The first subscene is located on the lower half of panels 9 and 10, and has as its subject Death Ritual and Judgment after Death, thoroughly explicated by Grenet (fig. 5a). It starts along the right with images of Zoroastrian funerary rites carried out on the morning of the fourth day fol lowing a person's death-—the yast-i cahäiom. Two priests who have been identified by Grenet as the zöt and his assistant, the räsplg, conduct the rites with their iconic set of ritual implements: sacred fire, mouth covers (padâm), and barsom branches (Grenet et al. 2004: 281). Above the priests sit a pair of dogs, who during the ceremony are brought in to view the deceased in the ritual act of sagdld, symbolizing the canine escorts for the afterlife. The dogs thus tie the ritual to the imagined pas sage into the afterlife, and are mentioned as com panions of the deceased's daêna [Vidêvdâd 19.30) and guardians of the Cinwad Bridge (ibid.: 13.9; Grenet, Riboud, and Yang 2004: 279). This ritual magically opens the entrance to this bridge,69 making a smooth transition in the scene as it con tinues along the rest of the lower half of these two panels, where Wirkak and Wiyusi are shown suc cessfully crossing the Cinwad Bridge. The bridge is portrayed as a single shallow arch supported by a span of 12 pillars, each of which is topped by a stylized animal-headed capital. The last third of the bridge with its final 4 pillars is omitted, as the farther shore is left to the viewer's imagina tion. Below the bridge is a swirling body of wa ter inhabited by monsters. For those to whom entrance to Paradise is denied, the bridge would turn to its side under their feet throwing them into the abyss beneath. But in this depiction, a merchant family walks across, including a couple (symbolizing Wirkak and Wiyusi) with two chil dren and a large group of animals: horse, sheep, cattle, donkey, camel, some dogs, plus a cat and a chicken. The camels are loaded with bundles of goods. The position of Wirkak and Wiyusi on the bridge "shows that they have victoriously passed the test of the bridge and are no longer under the threat of falling into Hell" (Grenet, Riboud, and Yang 2004: 281). The second subscene occupies the upper half of panels 9 and 10, and portrays events that take place after the successful passage of judgment across the Cinwad Bridge, which may be best la beled as Admittance to Paradise (fig. 5b). Once again the narrative begins along the right edges. Here, just above the two dogs, in a mountainous landscape,70 three divine beings welcome a couple (symbolizing Wirkak and Wiyusi), who are shown being greeted as travelers who have just arrived: seated on their heels holding a footed platter and a drinking cup, respectively.71 This reception takes place below the formal, frontal image of a deity, dressed in a long belted robe, wearing a scarf-decorated crown, seated re gally with legs crossed on a seat of resting bulls (facing the cardinal directions), holding a small trident in the right hand and resting the left hand in a regal manner just above the knee. This divine figure is enclosed in a mandorla flanked by two winged attendants who stretch a billowing scarf above it. Based on this deity's iconography, Frantz Grenet has identified it as Wesparkar, a prominent Sogdian equivalent of the Iranian god Vayu, shown with the iconography of Siva Mahesvara (Grenet et al. 2004: 281).72 This deity may have displaced Ohrmazd as supreme deity among the Sogdians, as he appears to have among the Kushans. A Chi nese text from the early Tang period (7th cen tury) seems to suggest this when it states, "The god of Heaven of the Western Hu(-people) is the one which Buddhist sutras name Moxishouluo (Mahesvara)."73 But even in orthodox Zoroastrian Pahlavi literature of later centuries, Vayu/Wäy has specific functions in connection with the fate of the dead. He is divided into "bad" (Way 1 wat tai) and "good" ( Wäyi weh) aspects, the former as the cause of death, the latter as kindly host of the dead. According to the Bundahisn: When the soul (gyän) of the righteous crosses the Cinwad Bridge, the Good Way takes his hand and brings him to his own place . . . When the Bad Way strikes the soul (gyän) from the body, the Good Way receives it and gives it contentment (Bundahisn 26.29 30; facs. 166.7-11, tr. 217).74 In this subscene, therefore, Wesparkar appears in the role of the good host of the dead, overseeing the reception of the righteous souls of Wirkak and Wiyusi. The interpretation of the three greeters is one of the problematic elements of this subscene. Their portrayals are similar in their attire (long-sleeved 20</page><page sequence="21">gulâcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi garments, diadems, and necklaces), but also dis tinguished from one another in subtler ways. The leading figure is winged, while the other two are not. Moreover, the leading figure is placed in an unusual posture: with legs and feet angled for ward and apparently crossed, as if seated at lei sure on a high seat. The depiction of the feet with anklet probably signals a female being. The figure raises one hand in a gesture used when holding a footed platter or a drinking vessel. But this hand is empty, perhaps intended to signal that Wirkak has just accepted the vessel from her hand. The proposal to identify the leading, winged figure as the Manichaean Light Maiden falls short, as discussed above, and alternatives must be sought within the Zoroastrian pantheon. Grenet's identification of the main figure as the daênâ of Wirkak well suits the afterlife context of the scene, and although one expects this be ing to be shown meeting the deceased on the ap proach to the Cinwad Bridge, she is also said to escort the righteous soul up above the bridge, to the mountaintops, to meet the gods (Vendidad 19.30). Nevertheless, this identification has been critiqued by Azarpay on iconographie grounds (2011: 63). Moreover, since Wirkak and Wi yusi are received together, we would expect two daênâ s to greet them. Alternatively, the group of three might be interpreted collectively as a del egation of fiavasis, considering the similar attire shown on the angelic fravasis of the previous and subsequent panels (see panel 8 and panel 11), and the fact that these beings are invoked in the yast-i cahâiom (Dâdistân 1 dênîg 28.7; Sâyest né sâyest 17.4). Yet, given that only the front figure bears wings, as well as the greater prominence of this being relative to the other two, it most likely rep resents an individual distinct from them. Among Zoroastrian deities possibly matching the feminine iconography of the front figure of the three greeters, one might consider Anahid,75 Ashi Vanguhi (M.Pers. Ahriswang),76 Vanaintï Uparatät, Dahmän, and Astäd. Even without ar guing for a definitive conclusion, it is important to survey evidence relevant for each possibility. Anahid was the most popular Zoroastrian goddess in the Sasanian period, and the only one with pos itively identified representations in art from the period. Among the latter, she appears to be repre sented on two ossuaries, indicating her relevance for a funerary context.77 Ashi, as the embodiment of fortune, also would be a logical choice, and is associated with the key judges of the dead, Sraosa, Rasnu, and MiGra (Yast 17.2.16). The repeated stress on her feet stepping into the household of the righteous (Yast 17.2.6; 18.4) seems to correlate with the visual emphasis on the figure's feet in the carving. By association with the Greek Tyche she may have picked up some of the latter's iconogra phy, which at times featured wings. Yet Ashi is de scribed in Zoroastrian texts predominantly in the role of the goddess of fortune in this life, and her afterlife associations are not particularly strong. Vanaintï Uparatät78 appears on Kushan coins with attributes of Nike under the name Oanindo,79 and for this reason makes a good match to a winged figure. It would be logical to portray her in the mo ment of spiritual victory when Wirkak and Wi yusi are welcomed to Heaven. Stronger cases can be made for two remaining possibilities: Dahmän and Astäd. Both are consis tently associated with the afterlife, and both are specifically invoked in the yast-i cahâiom, "wor ship of the fourth (day)," the very ritual depicted in the subscene immediately below this figure on the sarcophagus. Dahmän (or more fully Dahmän Afrin) is the embodiment and protector of the re ward of one's good deeds, particularly religious acts (Bundahisn 26.94, facs. p. 175.6-12; tr. 227). The offerings made in the yast-i cahâiom on be half of the deceased are sent on their way with the formula Dahm Yazad be-iasâd "May it reach Dahm Yazad!"; and it is believed that "Dahmän is the yazad who receives from the hands of Srös the souls of the just and leads them to the sky."80 She is likewise invoked on the tenth and thirtieth days after death, as well as the first anniversary.81 Astäd, the embodiment of justice, is typically paired with Rasnu, the judge of the dead who weighs their deeds on a set of scales (for example invoked to gether in the Rashn Yast), as well as other deities associated with judgment of the dead and entrance into the afterlife.82 In the yast-i cahâiom, one of the three sacred cakes is dedicated to Astäd and Rasnu stationed on Mount Ushi-darena/Ösdästär (cf. Siiözah 26), "the seat of holy happiness" (Yast 19 prologue), because "she is the ruler of glory (.xwanah) of that time when the account (of the deceased) occurs,- the souls are in the light of the dawn . . . when they go to the account" (Dâdistân 1 dênîg 30.2-3). The second cake is dedicated to the Good Wäy (Dâdistân î dênîg 30.4), the main deity of this subscene depicted in the mandorla, and the third to the fiavasi of the deceased and all 21</page><page sequence="22">gulâcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi fravasis (Säyest ne säyest 17.4). Correlations be tween the above references and the iconography of this subscene, such as the reception of the dead in the afterlife, the presence of the Good Way, the set ting on a holy mountain, and the yast-i cahärom (shown in the subscene below) point to a strong possible identification. Nevertheless, the signifi cant gaps in our knowledge of popular Zoroastrian beliefs in this period call for caution in drawing any definitive conclusion. Regarding the two secondary figures of the three greeters, one must consider several pos sible Zoroastrian interpretations. They could be simply attendants of the leading figure without further identification. Their gender is unclear. If female, the artist may have intended a grouping of some combination of the female deities discussed above. Their crowns and necklaces, however, can be worn by men as well, as is the case on mu rals of Kizil.83 If male, they may represent male deities associated with the Zoroastrian afterlife, such as Rasnu and Srös. The objects they hold might be attributes signaling their identity, but unfortunately offer little help. The figure on the left holds what appears to be a cup, while the one on the right holds a stem downward, terminating in a trefoil shape, perhaps a leafy twig.84 In a continuation of the subscene in the next panel (a continuation signaled in part by the im age of the Cinwad Bridge crossing both panels), a winged being is shown approaching, flying to wards the couple at their heavenly reception, leading a pair of winged horses to them. As in the resurrection scene on panel 8, this figure probably represents a fiavasi. In her left hand is a small ob ject that has been interpreted as a small figurine, or alternatively could be a capped jar. Given the context of this object, it seems plausible to sug gest it to be a container of white höm, of which the Bundahisn says "whoever shall eat it will become immortal" (16.5), and to which earlier Avestan literature consistently gives the epithet "death-dispelling" (Yasna 9.4, 7, 10, 13, etc.). A falling figure, seen directly below the winged figure, is shown without wings and dressed in a long robe with hair in a topknot, tumbling head over heels as it falls backward, pointedly portrayed facing away from the viewer to communicate the vanished significance of this being.85 Its position and posture indicate some being that has failed to intrude into the happy fate of Wirkak and Wi yusi. The most likely identification of this figure is Vïzarasa/Wïzars, "the one who drags away," the demon who "contends with the souls of departed men, during those three nights" immediately fol lowing death (Bundahisn 27.22-, facs. 184.7-8; tr. 237). Of this being, it is said, "And the fourth day (after death), the demon Wizars comes and binds the soul of the wicked with that which is an evil chain . . . seizes that soul of the wicked, and mercilessly and maliciously beats and torments it, and . . . drags him, hopelessly, to that which is the nethermost Hell" (Mënôg 1 xiad 2.161-66; cf. Vendidad 19.28-29; Dädistän ï dënîg 32.4, 7). But other possible identifications cannot be ruled out.86 A recurring theme of these demonic post mortem threats is the noose by which they seek to seize the soul. In the Pahlavi commentary to Vendidad 19.29, it states that, "Everyone has a noose cast around his neck: when a man dies, if he has been a righteous man, the noose falls from his neck; if wicked, they drag him with that noose down into Hell." In light of references to such an implement, we might venture an expla nation for the indistinct object held in the falling figure's right hand. An oval shape flares out above the hand, while a narrow part of the object pro trudes from its grip below. It is possible that the carver did not understand his model, and failed to hollow out the oval, making it appear to be a solid object rather than a looped cord or noose.87 The third and final subscene occupies the en tire surface of the last panel, panel 11, and shows Wirkak and Wiyusi Riding into the Land of Par adise (see fig. 5c). The couple is portrayed here mounted on heavenly steeds, encircled by winged musicians playing a variety of instruments (from right to left: lute, cymbals, flute, string harp, and mouth harp). Beneath them, on the land, the gal loping bodies of domesticated animals (horse, cattle, camel, and ram) are shown as they trans form into swirling abstractions, or, in the words of Guitty Azarpay, "etherify into bursts of florid clouds."88 At the bottom of the panel is a body of water—but these are the waters of Paradise, where instead of monstrous makaias, three wa ter birds are contentedly swimming from right to left. As all figures in this panel, they too are lead ing the viewer's attention leftward, back to the front wall and the door of the sarcophagus. The Zoroastrian significance of this panel has never been in serious doubt, as the triumphant mounted ascent of the souls of Wirkak and Wiyusi into Garödmän, the heavenly "House of Song" in 22</page><page sequence="23">gulàcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi the Zoroastrian tradition, artistically realized here by a swarm of angelic musicians. The inclusion of animal spirits strikes another distinctly Zoro astrian note, since this religion has a much more positive view of animals than the contrasting Manichaean association of animals with demonic forms. As the culmination of the complex set of images arrayed across this side of the sarcophagus in panels 9-11, it signals the hope of the family for the immediate post-mortem happiness of their par ents, in anticipation of the eschatological events of the more distant future shown in panels 1 and 8. Conclusion The sarcophagus of Wirkak and Wiyusi retains valuable documentary evidence about certain aspects of popular religious beliefs relevant for Sogdians living in China during the 6th century. Appropriately to this funerary purpose, about half of its relief carvings concern teachings about death and afterlife. Fitted into the architectural frame of a Chinese temple with its pair of guard ians flanking a massive double door, already the front of this sarcophagus defines a Zoroastrian handling of death (see figs, la and lb): a pair of Sros figures, below the windows, references the Zoroastrian ritual management of death; and a pair of rows of musicians, above the windows, evokes the Zoroastrian Garödmän, the "House of Song." The door itself is oriented south, in the direction of this Zoroastrian Paradise. Additional themes of Zoroastrian eschatology are the focus of the five religious panels placed strategically on the other three walls. As our analysis above has shown, the total of eleven narrative panels form a well-planned iconographie program based in pop ular Zoroastrianism and Sogdian folklore, while balancing a series of scenes between personal life (narrative panels) and Zoroastrian doctrine (reli gious panels, see fig. 2). The very first of the religious panels (panel 1 ) sets up the overall soteriological theme of the iconographie program by portraying a utopie Zo roastrian vision for all humankind (see fig. 3). It forecasts a time far in the future that will take place eons after the death and the imagined (cur rently unfolding) afterlife of the righteous inhab itants of this tomb. It portrays the Paradise-like ideal future of a world without violence towards animals that will be established under the rule of a "savior" named Sosans. Sosans is represented by a gilded figure of a deity in the upper subscene. Sosans's teachings about harmony between pred ators and prey are in the lower subscene. Thus, this panel begins the narrative program of this sarcophagus with a Zoroastrian teaching about world eschatology—the Prophecy of Sosans. The subsequent set of biographical panels (pan els 2-7) also contributes important details that are needed to better comprehend the religious theme (see fig. 2). These six panels are inserted between two closely related scenes involving events of world eschatology. This juxtaposition effectively personalizes the eschatological message. The lat ter is transformed so that it no longer narrates a generic future, but one that is specific to the married couple entombed in this sarcophagus and named as Wirkak and Wiyusi in the Sogdian in scription. Whatever the artistic prototype of the subsequent Resurrection Scene on the lower part of panel 8 (see fig. 4b) and the Road to Paradise Scene on panels 9-11 (see figs. 5a-5c), placing them after the biographical scenes makes the re curring couple motif a clear visual reference to Wirkak and Wiyusi. Directly following the biographical scenes, the Koyamaputta Jätaka Scene on the upper part of panel 8 (see fig. 4a) also seems to add something personal to the eschatological message of this sarcophagus. Through its folkloric character and Indian origin, this scene appears to be an anom aly on the two soteriological panels that frame the life narratives. The allegory of a previously carefree being (the monkey) that miraculously transformed its life by following the teaching of a sage was most likely a readily understandable reference for Sogdians living in the 6th century. The moralizing message of the jätaka behind this scene perhaps had a special meaning to Wirkak and Wiyusi late in life as religion might have be come more important for them, following the in dulgences and lighter pastimes of their youth, as portrayed on the biographical panels. The analogous composition employed on pan els 1 and 8 distinguishes these two from the rest of the panels on the left (West) and the back (North) walls of this sarcophagus. They are visu ally linked to one another not only by framing the biographical narratives, but also by following a similar layout. They both divide their panels into two sections: one in approximately the top third and another in the lower two-thirds of the panel. 23</page><page sequence="24">gulàcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi They both place a prominent figure into the focal point of the upper section, encircled (either by the opening of a small cave or by a mandorla). In turn, the lower part of their panels are organized sym metrically beyond the bank of a body of swirling water shown in the foreground, in the bottom of their picture planes. They both utilize implied lines within these symmetrical arrangements to point upward, to the direction of the main figures. These compositional characteristics are also ob served on one other subsequent panel, located on the right (East) wall of the sarcophagus. On the upper half of panel 9, the even circle of a man dorla highlights the central deity shown above the symmetrically arranged episode along the right half of the Admittance to Paradise subscene (see fig. 5b). Thus, on all three walls there is one panel that features a prestigious figure (either a deity, a sage, or a "savior") in the upper part of the panel directly above a symmetrical arrange ment, and thus providing unity across the three busy walls of the sarcophagus. Among the three walls with narrative panels, the compositionally most meaningful is the last to be viewed, right (East) wall of the sarcophagus. The three panels that make up this wall portray one scene about the stages of the afterlife that the deceased must take in order to get from death to Paradise—dubbed here as the Road to Paradise Scene (see fig. 5). This complex scene is a testi mony to a conscious design that communicates not only via the symbolic connotation of its mo tifs, but also via their arrangement. As explored in detail above, the subject matter of this wall is straightforward, imparting a succinct message in three subscenes: Death and Judgment after Death (panels 9-10, lower half, see fig. 5a), Ad mittance to Paradise (panels 9-10, upper half, see fig. 5b), and Riding into the Land of Paradise (panel 11, see fig. 5c). The composition observed on this wall lends full support to the iconographie program by emphasizing a right to left direction that aims south—the direction of Paradise in Zoroastrian teaching. The Cinwad Bridge in the judgment episode and the winged steeds and all musicians in the riding episode are all oriented this way—just as Wirkak and Wiyusi are facing south every time they are shown on this wall. Thusly contextualized within a carefully planned and masterfully executed design, this scene is an appropriate culmination to religious theme por trayed on this sarcophagus. The identification of a comprehensible and sub stantial Zoroastrian iconographie program from 579 c.e. is significant not only for our knowledge of Sogdian religion and culture, but also for Iranian studies more broadly. The relief carvings on the sarcophagus constitute documentary evidence for a popular version of Zoroastrian eschatology dur ing the 6th century, with many points of contact with the later "orthodox" Zoroastrian literature of Iran. With the earliest surviving substantial Zo roastrian literature dating to the 9th century c.e., it has long been the ambition of Zoroastrian stud ies to uncover earlier sources, by which to verify the existence of various features of the tradition in the Sasanian period, and compare them to the later transmission and transformation of those features. For any historian of religion, this quest also has involved the wish to gain a window into the forms the tradition took outside of the narrow confines of its normative sacerdotal authorities, who may be suspected of carrying on a private discourse among themselves with only limited recognition in the communities of the Zoroas trian faith spread across the larger Iranian world. Beside a small set of outside reports from Greco Roman, Syrian, and Armenian sources, as well as the still underutilized Manichaean sources,89 textual resources from the Sasanian period re main meager. Art historical resources—including Sasanian monumental reliefs, engraved seals, and coins, Kushan coins, and Sogdian murals, portable works of art, and ossuaries—are largely iconic in character, demonstrating the relative importance of various members of the Zoroastrian pantheon in both official and private circles, and in only a few cases offering representations of rituals. The Sogdian funerary monuments from China have in recent decades introduced precious new evidence, and among them the sarcophagus of Wirkak and Wiyusi adds unparalleled imagery re flecting Zoroastrian beliefs. Only the notion that this imagery is intermixed with elements from non-Zoroastrian religions has clouded recogni tion of just what an important breakthrough this artifact provides in our knowledge of 6th century Sogdian Zoroastrianism in Central Asia, and its intriguing points of continuity with mainstream Zoroastrian tradition attested in the 9th century literature. Now that the cloud of uncertainty re garding the completely Zoroastrian character of the carvings on the sarcophagus has been cleared away, researchers from a number of disciplines, 24</page><page sequence="25">gulâcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi especially religious studies and art history, can work toward further insights into the meaning and significance of the iconography The sarcophagus of Wirkak and Wiyusi dem onstrates the presence among 6th-century Sog dians of two Zoroastrian eschatological idea complexes. In terms of personal eschatology, the carvings on panels 9-11 on the right (East) side confirm belief in a post-mortem process of judg ment, escorted welcome, and conveyance into Garödmän, initiated by a funerary ritual still in practice among Zoroastrians today A number of details of these death-related beliefs and practices find expression in the carvings. But other aspects of the latter require further study, particularly the dramatis personae of the soul's post-mortem ex periences. In terms of world eschatology, panels 1 and 8, flanking the biographical scenes of Wirkak and Wiyusi's life, appear to attest definite expec tations for a future Renovation of the earth. Thus, the dual eschatology distinctive of Zoroastrian ism is clearly represented on the sarcophagus, in cluding a future bodily Resurrection of the dead, and an idealized existence in a perfected physical world, overseen by an expected messianic fig ure, Sosans. The iconographie connections of the portrayal of the latter Zoroastrian figure to Bud dhist Maitreya imagery reopens an old debate about possible interdependencies between the messianic and eschatological beliefs of the two religions. All of these subjects may now receive fresh impetus from the unique visual library that encompassed the mortal remains of Wirkak and Wiyusi far from their Sogdian homeland. Notes 1.

Two additional funerary couches from the same context not included in Cheng's study are in the Shelby White and Leon Levy Collection, New York, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. 9. Grenet 2007: 469-471. The tombs of An Jia, Yu Hong, and the funerary couches in the Shelby White and Leon Levy Collection, New York (see Carter 2002) and in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (Mik kelsen 2016: 117-18) also have the half-man, half rooster priest figures tending fires. 10. See Cheng 2010: 96-98. As Judith Lerner ob serves, "[A] stone platform or container fits well with Zoroastrian belief as such furnishings elevate the bones from the floor of an underground tomb chamber and isolate them from contact with earth and water. Indeed, even the tombs of Sogdians that did not con tain stone furnishings, specifically the tombs of the Shi family, were each fitted with a rectangular stone, plastered earthen or brick platform between 30 and 60 centimeters above the floor to support a single or pair of wooden coffins" (Lerner 2005b: 8-9). Stone cham bers for either ossuaries or fully articulated skeletons are known from Panjikent (Lerner 2005b: 7). The time between death and interment would have allowed for exposure. This, however, cannot be confirmed because the tomb was robbed and the bones had been scattered and thus it is not known if they were articulated or unarticulated in the tomb (Yang 2005: 22). 11.

Nor is it implausible that Manichaeans could have reached Gansu by this time (de la Vaissière 2005c: 367). 16. He notes a parallel from cave 360 at Dunhuang (de la Vaissière 2005c: p. 359 n. 6). 17. He cites Stanley Abe on the consistent presence of a hat, among other features, identifying Laozi images (de la Vaissière 2005c: p. 359 n. 7). 18. Mikkelsen accepts identification of this figure as Mani (2016: 120-21), while admitting that all records indicate arrival of Manichaeism in China a century later (2016: 121-22). 19.

De la Vaissière acknowledges the problem that traces of paint show the headgear to have been red; but he thinks this may just be outline highlighting of these figures, as of several others (2005c: p. 360 n. 9). 23. On this Northern Wei carving, two figures are shown wearing a headgear with the above described de sign along the left half of the carving, including the fifth figure standing to the left of the emperor in the first row and the figure shown next to the left fan looking away from the emperor in the middle row.

The single depiction of the two novice elect dressed in what appears to be white sacerdotal robes but secular hats and belts is preserved on the verso of fragments b and c of MIK III 4979.

In their literary context, the words de le Vaissière cites from the Manichaean Parthian Hymn-Cycles refer to a frightening confrontation of the forces of good and evil over the ascending soul of the dead, not the rescue of a soul from captivity by evil forces. 35. See Reck 2003: 323-38. 36. Daënâ is a controversial term in Manichaean studies, often confused with the Light Maiden. The Avestan concept of daënâ connotes the deeds of the in dividual that confronts the soul after death in a female form. In 1981, Carsten Colpe demonstrated a problem with its use in reference to Manichaeism, in which nei ther the term nor the concept of the daënâ appears. He writes: "It follows that between daënâ and the Light Maiden no religio-historical connection may be found, since they have in common only the attribute of femaleness, which as such signifies nothing" (1981: 68-69). In contrast, Sundermann finds some evidence of Zoroastrian influence on Iranian Manichaeism that results in some amalgamation between the Light Maiden and the daënâ, despite the fact that the term itself is not used in Manichaean sources (1992:168-69). Azarpay also entertains the hypothesis that the Light Maiden of the Manichaeans and the Dën of the Zoro astrians might have a shared iconography (2011: 54-56 and 63-66). 37.

Her designation in a variety of languages refer ences an unmarried young woman with close ties to the divine element of light (Copt. Paithenos Nouaine and Parth./MP. Kanig Roshan, lit. 'Light Maiden'). De spite pioneering publications by Carsten Colpe, Werner Sundermann, Alois van Tongerloo, and most recently by Yutaka Yoshida, a comprehensive study on the Light Maiden is yet to be written. For a recent study of the Light Maiden including a diagram of the Man ichaean pantheon (Tab. 6/8), see Gulâcsi 2015: 345-54, 400-405, and 397-400. 43. Azarpay holds to de la Vaissière's initial sugges tion that the tumbling figure represents the discarded body of the deceased, in accord with the Fihrist passage (2011: 61). 26</page><page sequence="27">gulâcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi 44. Grenet, Riboud, and Yang originally interpreted the falling figure as male (2004: 278), but Grenet later considered it female (2007: 472). 45. As already observed by Grenet, Riboud, and Yang 2004: 283. 46. Although it must be noted that the inclination of the torso and head were used more widely in this period than the iconography of Maitreya. For a study about the evolution of this iconography, see J. Lee 1993:311-57. 47. For contemporaneous comparative examples on Chinese Buddhist relief carvings, see Leidy 1990: fig. 7b; S. Lee 1998: entry 154 upper corners; Rhie 2010: figs. 5.34c and 6.19 upper register, flanking center; To kyo National Museum 2000: entries 139 and 140; as well as Juliano 2006: fig. 18a-c,- and Kageyama 2005: fig. 4a. 48. On larger scales than coins, such mustaches are featured on images of rulers hammered onto two metal plates from Sogdiana (one from the city of Merv) dated to the 8th and 9th centuries in the collection of the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg (Marschak 1986: figs. 30, 32, and 193). 49. This nagaraja from 6th/7th-century Peshawar is housed in the collection of the Cabinet des Médailles in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris (Err ington, Cribb, and Claringbull 1992: 237-40). In con temporaneous Buddhist context, the combination of a straight mustache with a pointed beard and a version of what appears to be a topknot is employed in the depic tion of an emaciated meditating figure from a jätaka scene in Cave 38 of Kizil (see Feng 1992: fig. 21). 50. The position of the index finger is obscure on the carving as pointed out by Frantz Grenet (2007:475). Although it does not extend as far as it should if it is meant to be erect, it is not folded under the thumb in the carving as it is portrayed on the line-drawing of this figure by Junkai Yang. Thumb and index finger have not been successfully differentiated by the carver. Yang's interpretation is accepted by Étienne de la Vais sière, who thus considers the gesture unattested in Ira nian art (2015: p. 97 n. 6). 51. Bromberg 1992. "This interpretation cau tiously advanced by Bromberg is now confirmed by a gold medal showing Shapur I receiving the surrender of Philip the Arab, where the king executes this ges ture" (Grenet 2007: p. 475 n. 23, citing Alram, Blet Lemarquand, and Skjaervo: 2007: 11-40. Intriguingly, in a vyäkarana scene from Dunhuang Cave 423, while the bodhisattva does touch his face, he does so with the first and last fingers of his hand held in the "victory" gesture. 52. Both Grenet (2007: 475) and de la Vaissière (2015: 106) identify the three sage-like figures at the left as Chinese "Daoists," but the lower two, at least, are depicted with standardized Indie iconography of brahmins, who are commonly shown engaged in dis cussion with bodhisattvas or other divine beings in the contemporaneous Buddhist art of Kizil as seen for example in Cave 38, see Feng 1992: figs. 25 and 27. 53. Cf. Dädistän 1 dënïg 35.3: "And near to the time of the Renovation the bodily existences desist from eating, and live without food." 54. Boris Marshak emphasizes the secular, folkloric nature of these stories and notes that the narrative wall paintings of Sogdiana have no connection to Christian, Manichaean, or Buddhist doctrinal literature (Marshak and Livshits 2002: 159-60). 55. Jätaka no. 299; English translation taken from Morris 1885: 254-55. 56. E.g., details of murals from Kizil Cave 171, such as an emaciated sage seated in a cave with a monkey in front of it, and an emaciated sage sermonizing to a deer (Feng 1992: figs. 64, 65). 57. E.g., mural fragments from Kizil Cave 114, such as MIK III 9103 that features an emaciated sage with a topknot seated in a cave sermonizing to a deer,- and MIK III 8692 that shows a monkey in meditation dis turbed by another monkey (Yaldiz 1987: Abb. 43 and VII; as well as pp. 600-650). 58. Cave 117 is dated to the 5th and early 6th cen turies. For an overview of the dating of Kizil caves, see Howard 1991: 68-83. 59. Related to this iconography is the depiction of apo theosis in Roman art, in which the deceased (sometimes reaching up to the hand of God) rises to Heaven either on a chariot or lifted by one or more winged angels. For a 2nd-century example with a single angel carrying two people on its back, see Grabar 1968: fig. 62. For a 5th century example with two angels physically lifting one person with their hands, see Weitzmann 1979: p. 40, en try 60. 60. Kraeling 1956: 178-202. 61. See Kartsonis 1986. An alternative to being raised from a coffin is the anastasis of Adam and Eve that portrayed Christ pulling Adam and Eve from the flames of Hell, as seen for example on a 10th-century il lumination in an Exultet Scroll in the collection of the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana (see Evens and Wixom 1997: pp. 469-72, entry 308. 62. See Peppard 2011: 105. 63. The person being rescued is visible only to mid chest above the bottom frame of the scene,- see Gough 1973: fig. 25. Gough notes that it has been interpreted as the Ascension of Christ, the standard iconography of which features angels lifting Christ to Heaven. Either interpretation of the scene is possible. 64. In the Chinese Manichaean Diagram of the Uni verse, fiery jaws are shown at the four corners of the earth, to symbolize Hell, see Gulâcsi 2015: p. 373 and fig. 6/44. 65. In the 4th century, Ephraim Syrus states that, "All whom the sea has drunk . . . will awaken and arise and come forth at the twinkling of an eye" (cited in Bynum 27</page><page sequence="28">gulâcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkak and Wiyusi 1995: 75). An illumination in the Trier Apocalypse, a 9th century manuscript copying models of approximately the 6th century, shows bodies being reassembled from parts, some of which have been cast up by the sea (By num 1995: 197; on the dating, see Snyder 1964: 142-62. 66.

Compare the more abbreviated depiction of ani mals and people stepping onto the bridge, only the first few feet of which is shown, beside a Zoroastrian priest conducting the funerary ritual, on the Sogdian funerary couch in the Shumei Collection of the Miho Museum, reproduced in Juliano and Lerner 2001: p. 56, fig. 4a. 70. The daêna "makes the soul of the righteous one go up above Hara-berezaiti (mountain), above the Cinwad Bridge she places it in the presence of the heav enly gods themselves" (Vendidad 19.30). 71. Such a reception with food and drink is a typi cal expectation of the afterlife in Zoroastrianism: "The meals of the world are taken in two ways: one is the distribution of water in haste, and one is with enjoy ment to the end; but in Heaven there is no haste as to water, and rejoicing with much delight, they are like unto those who, as worldly beings, make an end of a meal of luxury" (Dädistän 1 dënlg 31.12; cf. Mënôg I xiad 2.152, 156). 72. Av. vayus uparö.kaiiyö, who already had assimi lated the iconography of Siva by the time he is portrayed on Kusän coins under the name OESO, i.e., Wëso/Wës. For the bull throne of this deity, see the panel painting from Khotan contemporaneous with Wirkak (6th cen tury) in the collection of the British Museum (1907.11 11.71), reproduced in Cocheteux et al. 1995: #231, p. 301. For an exact parallel in the pose of the deity, see the 7th century mural painting of the god Sürya from Kucha in the collection of the Museum für Asiatische Kunst (MIK III 9098), reproduced in ibid.: #222, p. 293. 73.

In one of the slrözah invocations, she is associ ated with Srös and Rasnu (7), and in another with Rasnu alone ( 18). In the Mihi Yast she appears in the company of MiGra, Data ("Law"), and Rasnu (Yast 10.32.139). In the Ardä Wiräz-nämag 5.3, describing a visionary jour ney to the afterlife, Astäd is described standing next to the Cinwad Bridge, together with Mihr, Rasn, Way, Wahräm, and other divine beings. A funerary äfrlnagän recitation is dedicated to Astäd and Rasnu on the third day after death (Boyce 1975: 330). In the Vispered she is invoked in the context of the path of the dead: "And we sacrifice to that better path that leads to that Best World. And we worship Arstât the good . . . who is the Mazdayasnian daênâ-, and with her we worship Rasnu the most just, and Mithra of the wide pastures. And we worship Parendi the wealthy" (Vispered 7.2). In the Bundahisn she along with Rasnu, Zämyäd, and the three glories (xwarrah) "judge the souls of men, for good and evil deeds, there at the Cinwad Bridge" (Bundahisn 3.19, facs. p. 37.10-14; tr. p. 43). 83. For men with similar diadems (consisting of three disks) and a neck ornament depicted in illustra tions of jätaka stories on the walls of Cave 38 at Kizil (see figs. 17, 24, 25 in Feng 1992: 52, 57). 84. Although the line drawing reproductions of the sarcophagus reliefs rendered by Yang are extremely ac curate in most details, the rendering of this object as five-petaled is inaccurate, and has led to its interpreta tion as a flower. 85. The figure falls in the same way that someone would fall from the Cinwad Bridge into Hell: "A soul of the wicked, the fourth night after passing away, its account being rendered, rolls head-foremost and tot ters from the Cinwad Bridge" (Dädistän I dênîg 32.4). This motif is similar to what is seen in contemporane ous Buddhist art, where the depiction of the Vyaghri Jätaka (popularly known as the Hungry Tigress Jätaka) in Cave 38 at Kizil shows the Buddha in a former life throwing himself down (tumbling with his back to wards the viewer) from a precipice in order to offer his body to a starving tigress and her cubs (Feng 1992: fig. 26; Yaldiz 1987: 57-58). 86. For example, it could be the Bad Wäy, "the de spoiler and destroyer" who is overpowered by the Good Wäy in the case of righteous souls (Dädistän 1 dënlg 30.4). Or it could be the demon Astôvïdotu/Astôvïdât, who also is identified as the causes of death ( Yast 13.11, 28</page><page sequence="29">guläcsi and beduhn: The Religion of Wirkalc and Wiyusi 22, 28; Dënkaid 9.12.17; 9.16.1-2; Dädistän I dënïg 37.52, 81), and tries to bind the soul. The righteous are those "whom Astövidät does not obtain for death by evil noosing (dus vadisno) from behind" (Dädistän 1 dënïg 37.108). He is associated (Vendidad 5.8, 9) or identified with (Bundahisn 27.43; facs. 187.13; tr. 241) the Bad Way. 87. See Cheng 2010: 95-96, on similar "mistakes" when an artist misunderstood an exemplar in render ing iconography across cultures in the Central Asian context. 88. Azarpay 2011: 61. 89. In addition to 8th-10th-century fragments of Middle Iranian Manichaean literature, the terminology of which provides significant data on Zoroastrian con cepts and practices in the Sasanian period (when most of the literature, including Mani's own compositions, was produced), a new set of references to Zoroastrian teaching and practice in the time of Mani has come to light in an early 5th-century Coptic Manichaean codex, the Chester Beatty Kephalaia; see BeDuhn 2015, and Dilley 2015.
