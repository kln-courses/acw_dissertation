<plain_text><page sequence="1">LANGUAGE AS A BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON ~ sINCE this is a philosophical congress, and Man has been chosen for its central theme, I feel that a philosophical examination of language should be a suitable topic for discussion. But for his faculty of speech, man would be a defenseless animal. Philosophy of language is not the same as linguistics. We can pretty well say what linguistics are. the examination into facts of actual language and into the causal laws controlling their changes. Less fruitful is the attempt to give a generally accepted definition of philosophy. Mr. Stutterheim, in his book, The Concept of Meta- phor, contends that it is altogether impossible to define philosophy. Indeed, a discussion of the concept of philosophy would be appro- priate. But since there does not exist a platonic idea of philosophy, the discussion may turn out to be a mere verbal one. For myself, I modestly take philosophy as a science of the limitations of our knowledge. Acquisition of knowledge belongs to the special sciences. The philosopher, as I see him, is the man with the red flag--the railwayman, of course,--who warns the special scientists against wasting their time on pseudo-problems, against trespassing, etc. The philosopher of language is thus fully entitled to inquire into the nature of the instrument which mankind possesses in the faculty of speech, hoping to find the natural limitations of the use of this instrument. This is no criticism of language as such, which, indeed, might be considered as self-contradictory, inasmuch as the critic would doubt the principal usefulness or validity of the tool he uses himself in criticizing. However, if an engineer uses an in- strument to test the aptitude and precision of another instrument, this is by no means an essential criticism of instrumentality. On the contrary. For if he did not trust instrumentality, he would not apply an instrument himself to test another one. x Paper read at the Tenth International Congress of Philosophy, Amster- dam, August, 1948.</page><page sequence="2">LANGUAGE AS A BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON 387 If language is taken to be a gift of the gods, made to measure for the otherwise completed masterpiece of creation, then there is nothing more to be said. For in this case mankind simply learned its language from the gods, much in the same way the child learns from his parents all sorts of words about all sorts of unknown and inconceivable things. Then we could conceive language as a means through which metaphysical powers reveal metaphysical truth, or try to do so. To the philosopher of language, all this is unaccept- able; first, because of the general rule: probatio incumbit affirmanti; secondly, because this solution places mankind apart from all other organisms. Now everything tends to make us consider homo sapiens as just one species among innumerable others. And if we call all the properties and faculties, exhibited by homo sapiens in his natu- ral and unsophisticated milieu, his biological properties and facul- ties, then the tenet that language is a biological phenomenon needs no further proof. (To avoid misunderstanding I add that psy- chology is just a branch of biology in this sense, since consciousness occurs only in living organisms. Hylozoism of any kind, and mon- istic materialism, are not worth serious consideration.) There is nothing mysterious about language if we consider it as an organic, biological instrument-as an organon to some practical purpose. But as soon as we take language to be a means of con- tacting an alleged metaphysical timeless reality, language collapses; it degenerates into empty pseudo-descriptions, usually put into the negative mood. I only need to remind you of the famous scene of the Mothers in the second part of Goethe's Faust to show that our best attempts in this direction do not go beyond mere negative descriptions. Although I certainly do not intend to discuss the somewhat sterile problem of the origin of language, there is no reason why we should see in language anything but a happy invention (not discovery) of some gifted specimen of the species homo. The de- velopment of articulate speech is, I contend, much easier to imagine than, say, the faculty of flying. Nobody thinks of denying the fact of the evolution of this faculty of flying, even though he has not the slightest idea of how it all happened; for we do not know how to explain the survival and especially the development of a wing which is not (or not yet) fit for flying and which thus has no biological function at all since it can not be exercised till the point of full- fledgedness has been reached. Not so with speech. We can quite well imagine man muddling along with nearly inarticulate animal cries, till he awoke one morning to hear a fellow, a gifted copy of his kind, singing in the wilderness, as Jespersen would have it, or perhaps amusing himself with exercises in articulation which we</page><page sequence="3">388 THE JOURNAL OP PHILOSOPHY call "lalling" in the very young child. Whether man had to de- velop the faculty of speech as a means of strategic social defense and groutp coordination as soon as he descended from the trees into the plains, as Mrs. de Laguna described it with so much force in the first chapter of her book,2 or whether he began lalling just for the pleasure of the thing, or to draw the attention of a female, or to put himself in the foreground as a leader of the tribe, is irrelevant for our theme. Personally I believe that man, who is a highly nervous animal, was bound to utter all sorts of different and specific cries under affective impulses such as wrath, fear, sexual excitation, hunger, thirst, or pugnacity. Since the animal cry is certainly not without its specific differ- entiations, man had not to acquire this faculty all afresh. But we have to ask here how the "meaning" of a cry came into the picture. The coordination of specific sounds to specific impressions was not entirely new, albeit that it was a long way from the hardly differen- tiated animal cry to the variety of meanings which men could ulti- mately attach to their articulate sounds. If I consider language as a biological phenomenon in the de- scribed sense, I do not mean to examine it from the behavioristic point of view. I do not believe the behavioristic method could teach us anything worth knowing about language itself if the ob- servers did not know beforehand practically everything about the subject-matter by way of introspection, from which we learn about intentions, response-feelings, volitions, commands, sexual excita- tion, meditation, etc. Behaviorism is quite appropriate to the study of animal behavior; it avoids the danger of anthropomor- phism here. But it ip a most inadequate method for the study of a typically anthropological phenomenon such as the faculty of speech. I do not intend to follow Ogden and Richards' behavioristic exposi- tion in their The Meaning of Meaning! As an anti-metaphysical antidote all these behavioristic ideas may be very useful. They all may help us to see language as a biological function, for behavior- ism incorporates man explicitly into the realm of living organisms, observable in time and space. But it does not contribute very much to the insight into the problems of meaning. What really happens is not elucidated by introducing artificial terms like "en- gram," "sign," etc., intended to discard psychological data. One of the best things of Ogden and Richards' book is the title The Meaning of Meaning. Here, indeed, centres the problem. To understand the meaning of meaning, we shall first have to state the fact that man, like most if not all living organisms, possesses the faculty to recollect impressions, and to recognize on repetition their 2 Grace Andrus de Laguna, Speech, Its Functions and Development (1927)</page><page sequence="4">LANGUAGE AS A BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON 389 general outlines and even some details. We do not commit the mis- take of anthropomorphism if we assume that man does not stand alone in these faculties. They seem to be typical for all living or- ganisms, i.e., for general biology. It has been said that the way in which man succeeds in connecting, uniting, and combining repeated impressions of outward and inward objects ("things" and "feel- ings") with definite and specific sounds, is a purely human achieve- ment. I am prepared to take this for granted, although I am not well enough acquainted with the inner conscious life of non-human living organisms to know whether or not they are in the habit of generalization. This should bring us to the question whether gen- eralization is psychologically possible without applying specific articulate sounds. But other questions interest me more at the present moment, and I shall therefore not enter upon the old prob- lem of the connection between thought and speech. I should like to stress that the co6rdination of meanings with specific sounds is rooted in a phenomenon of general biology, namely, the conditional reflex. The faculty of speech develops in the child on the basis of conditional reflexes, and there is no reason to think of the development of the faculty of speech in the genus in another way. What really happens is this. Man receives numerous inward and outward impressions. Many of them are similar. I do not say they are identical. I only hold that many impressions which are, as we saw, recognizable, and can be remembered, show marked points of analogy and similarity. If we should undertake to show the roots of the different kinds of words, of grammatical syntax, and of general meanings in those similarities of impressions, we would have to do no less than construct a complete theory of grammar and logic. As soon as man invented the trick of co6rdinating specific sounds to specific similarities of groups of impressions, con- ceptual meaning was born. The problem of conceptual meaning should not be confused with the well-known theory of definition by abstraction. Once a lan- guage has been born, and once it has arrived at a certain state of accomplishment, we can do all sorts of nice grammatical and logical tricks with it. Our results so far are undoubtedly a posteriori; but we can now interpret as a posteriori results what has been usually taken as the aprioristic elements of language. Kant made this quid pro quo. Not so Mauthner. What I mean to say is that "meaning" as the co6rdinator of "something" to specific articulate sounds is really nothing but a rule for deciding whether a special impression belongs to a general class or set of impressions, or not. Of course, the way in which</page><page sequence="5">390 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the individual impressions will be combined and compared with other impressions is wholly arbitrary. We can go very far in gen- eralizing, and obviously the more impressions we combine, the less they can have in comrmon. We even can try to abolish the natural narrowness of all conscious attention by imagining the merger of all impressions into one giant-impression, which combines into one all properties that can be perceived or thought, even if they are contra- dictory. In the latter case we speak of the Idea of Hegel, or else of the Ens Realissimum, with all possible properties, even that of reality, which is no property at all. Later on we shall understand these fancies as an overstraining of the biological function of speech. I may add that the meanings appear to exist in exactly the same way as the numbers which, in the Cantor-Frege-Russell theories, are properties of sets, that is to say, something in common to all sets of the same "number" (cardinal number). This is very different from asserting the existence of a pythagorean heaven where numbers and numerical relations dwell. (I do not like to use the words "concept" or "notion." I prefer the word "mean- ing" in the described sense.) Now if we wish to combine slightly different meanings by co- ordinating them to one sound for the sake of economizing thought, this is a matter of convention or rather of associative development of language. We need not follow Mauthner when he declares that language does not exist at all, even in one individual at a given mo- ment. But we certainly need not consider those associative combi- nations of slightly different meanings as the proof of the existence of concepts existing for themselves as a focus of meanings. Of course, practical and colloquial speech has to be much more lax than scientific discourse in the application of the in abstracto stringent rules or meanings, which define the classes or sets. Here is the so- lution of the very difficult epistemological problem of the existence of both "open " and "closed'" concepts or meaning. A closed meaning is, e.g., a square. One need not be in doubt as to what is the rule determining the set of squares. But what about, e.g., "bald-headed"? Is this a gentleman with 62 hairs, or with 188, or what? The extension of an open concept (meaning) can only be decided by voting or a Gallup poll. And most meanings are open in this sense. Most, if not all, closed meanings are artificial terms of science. But even in science this application is much more lax than it should be for really fruitful discussions. Mauthner criticizes on these grounds the use of language even for practical purposes. Yet he is wrong. Biologically originated instruments for practical purposes are never perfect, but this never makes them unfit for the only aim the organism tries to achieve: the</page><page sequence="6">LANGUAGE AS A BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON 391 continuation of the species by means of the self-preservation of the individual, the individual always being of minor importance. All this holds good for speech. We shall see that the biological function of speech was never intended for formal use. It was never intended as an instrument for logical precision, albeit it carries the germ of formalization in itself, because it has turned out that the rules determining meaning are the same as the rules determining classes or sets. Therefore class-calculus could be de- veloped as a close derivative of ordinary language. But it is hardly fair to expect this earthborn organ, language, to do the job of an abstract calculus. The function of language as a vehicle of truth is rooted in what Mrs. de Laguna describes as "belief." I must refer to the chapter "Belief and Thought" of her book. We can think here of Biihler's division of the functions of language into Kundgab e, Auslisung, and Darstellung-expression, impression (in the active sense of the word) and description. In speaking, one expresses oneself, tries to impress somebody else, and describes something, all in one. If we turn for discussion's sake to the descriptional function we can agree with Mrs. de Laguna that the hearer may take the description for granted. For the matter of that, no social coirdination and cooperation would be practically possible if the hearer should doubt on principle the truth of the description (information). In science, of course, all this is different. But since langua(ge is primarily and mainly an organ of group codrdination, it is clear that very much between speaker and hearer must be taken for granted. That is the social (biological) element of belief. Belief engenders expecta- tion. If the expectations are fulfilled, the verbal description has proved itself true. If not, it is falsified. Even the most refined arguments and tests of scientific cooperation show this same pattern of biological language: belief, expectation, truth (or falsity). From this we learn that there must be a fundamental difference between truth and correctness, namely, that between a material and a formal function. The practical necessity of being not too strict with meanings in colloquial speech, as indicated earlier, makes com- binations of meanings, of course, even more uncertain. Also we can erroneously subsume an impression under a specific articulate sound already engaged to carry another meaning. (Think also of Kant's definition of Dummheit as Mangel an Urteilskraft.) I can say only this. The testing of the formal correctness of combina- tions of meanings has nothing to do with the fulfillment of expecta- tions from beliefs. Incorrect combinations might, by chance, be confirmed by facts, fulfilling expectations, and vice versa. Demon- strations are a matter of formal testing. In the light of the modern theories of demonstration I doubt very much whether demonstra-</page><page sequence="7">.392 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tions are possible by means of ordinary language, e.g., where the method of producing identities is used. Moreover, in a formalized calculus every element must remain unchanged (constant) through- out the process of testing. Language was never originated for such abstract, non-practical purposes. Indeed, the view of a primarily logical character of language is refuted by the facts that (a) the purely logical use of language leads to self-contradictions, to elimi- nate which special formal languages had to be constructed; (b) the meanings are naturally somewhat vague and variable, as shown above; (c) calculus with words is impossible; (d) some results of scientific investigation can not even be expressed adequately in a word-language (e.g., quantum-physics, the infinitesimal calculus). The biological nature of language, as here outlined, explains sufficiently the fact that some special groups of abstracta can not be expressed in terms of a language, which is made up entirely from palpable, audible, and visible impressions, or of feelings of an or- ganic character. Here lies the problem of the legitimacy of meta- phors. Considering the fact that Mr. Stutterheim wrote a book of about 650 pages about metaphors, I can not be expected to say very much about this question here. But I wish to refer to the fact that the first users of language ("professors") were indeed com- pelled to make use of metaphors. Of course the stock of words (or sentence-words) must have been extremely small in the beginning. The attention of those first speakers was directed only to a very small number of objects and feelings. In opposition to Mr. Stutter- heim, who holds that the meaning of a proper meaning can not be indicated at all, I claim that the proper meaning is determined by the first occurrence of the coordination by way of conditional reflex of an impression to a specific articulate sound. One could speak of a semantical jus primi occupantis. Perhaps this implies that a proper meaning need not be exactly the same for different individ- uals. Be this as it may, if we take it for granted that the first articulate sounds had a proper meaning in the sense just defined, the problem of metaphor can be formulated as follows: Were those first articulate sounds with proper meanings applied to newly dis- covered objects also, or were such new objects always attached to newly coined sounds with new proper meanings? If the stock of sounds was exhausted and the inventive power for new ones was lacking, metaphors had to be used. Apart from poetical and rhe- torical metaphors, which are quite another story, I should be in- clined to claim that language is intrinsically metaphorical because of the situation just described, a situation of compulsion or distress. In any case, so much may be taken as certain: articulate sounds with their proper meanings must have remained very close to the impressions which claimed the attention of man as a natural bio-</page><page sequence="8">LANGUAGE AS A BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON 393 logical being. This language must have been from the very be- ginning most unfit for straying far away from its cradle. Not only that we can not expect language to yield information of a non- biological character, but it is now also clear why shifting sands were reached as soon as one tried to extend the use of these sounds beyond the field of their original concrete and finite biological ap- plication. Even the terms of science were originally closely co6rdi- nated with a biological meaning; think of the original meaning of such terms as "atom," "quantum," " differential," "integral," "reality," etc. E.g., faculty of speech could easily develop the use of an indefi- nite numeral, indicating the total of all single items known, or in sight, or reported by others, or that might be possibly encountered if one went in search for it. There is nothing mysterious, mystical, or paradoxical about this practically finite, indefinite expression, "all." As soon, however, as people extended this indefinite ex- pression beyond its natural field of application by extending its use to anything, even if nobody knows it or can possibly know of it, difficulties were bound to arise. One of the finest passages in Kant is his theory of Transcendental Delusion (transscendentaler Schein) based fundamentally on this overstraining of the indefi- nite numeral. In this connection I also refer to the pseudo-mean- ings: omniscience, omnipresence, omnipotence, eternity or sempi- ternity. Of the same order are the pseudo-meanings, "absolute truth," "summumm bonm," etc. The old meaning of "good" e.g., must have been the compliance of feelings with biological instincts, e.g., something devoutly to be wished for, by a family, or by a tribe, or a people, or perhaps solemnly approved by taboos, or something indispensable for the welfare of the species or the tribe. In another dimension lies the unexpected overthrow of apagog- ical demonstrations by means of the principle of the excluded middle. This overthrow was only possible by going back to the intrinsically concrete, natural meaning of Aristotle 's ontological principles, which refer to the conditions under which objects, exist- ing independently from the thinking subject, can be subsumed under the rules of a class or set. All this should warn any philosopher and any scientist against the danger that threatens those who venture beyond the natural boundaries of language, of language as a biological phenomenon. Dangerously far astray is the philosopher who takes a word for a card left by a visiting metaphysical ghost, and who then racks his brains in the vain attempt to infer, from the name on the card, the august visitor's "essential" properties.
