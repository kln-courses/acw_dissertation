Beusenberg TNO Crash-Safety Research Centre Andy Barnes and Geoff Platten TNO Ogle Safety Products, Ltd. Copyright 1997 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT The Q-series of child dummies is a new family of advanced child dummies covering the complete child population up to 12 years. The Q-series' design is not only advanced in terms of its biomechanical basis, it is also developed to be used in both front and side impact making it the first "multi-directional" series of (child) dummies. This paper presents the functional targets for the Q-series, a set of biomechanically based design and performance targets for a 3-year-old dummy and the validation of the prototype version of the 3-year-old Q- dummy, the Q3. INTRODUCTION BACKGROUND - Child occupant protection is still not at the level of adult occupant protection. The introduction of child restraint systems (CRSs) some decades ago, was a big step forward in passive safety, however, child occupant protection still suffers from a lot of controversy. Enhancements in adult occupant protection such as passenger and side airbags are not necessarily beneficial for child occupant protection. No consensus has been reached yet between legislative authorities, industry and research parties in standardizing anchorages for child restraint systems while the introduction of such systems, e.g. ISOFIX, could greatly enhance child protection [1]. Whereas for adult car occupant protection procedures have been standardized and regulated for both front and side impact, mainly front impact protection is addressed by current standards for CRSs. Developments are currently taking place to establish a procedure for side impact testing of CRSs, however, appropriate side impact child dummies have not been available up to now. [2,3]. In the 1 960's, TNO developed its first child dummy to evaluate child restraints. This dummy was named Pinocchio as most parts were made of wood. As a result of increasing attention for child occupant protection in the late 1 970's and early 1 980's, a complete series of child dummies was developed by TNO and others to cover almost the complete child population up to 12 years. Named after Pinocchio, the P- series dummies were introduced as test tools for the European regulation ECE-R44 and later also adopted by many other standards. Since then, other child dummies have become available for use in restraint system evaluation, from the infant CRABI-6 month dummy up to the Hybrid-Ill 3- and 6-years old [4]. Although recent child dummies have more up-to-date instrumentation, the need still exists for a family of child dummies with more representative biomechanical responses to help evaluate the performance of future child restraint systems in front and side impact conditions and realistically simulate child-airbag interactions. OBJECTIVE - In 1993 the international Child Dummy Working Group [5] was formed with the mission to develop the Q-series of child dummies as successor to the P-series. The 3-year-old version, Q3, has been developed as the first dummy of the Q-series.The new Q-series of child dummies is designed to be used in both front and side impact and is developed on the basis of a comprehensive set of biomechanical data. Unlike adult dummy development, child dummy development suffers from too limited human subject data to establish acceptable biofidelity response targets. Some quasi- static child response data is available [6,7] but their application is limited. Scaling of adult data is the most commonly used technique now to establish biofidelity targets for child dummies [8,9,10,11]. 3533</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1 Q3 head mounted on the neck and backplate with accelerometer housing. The current paper serves three main purposes. First, the definition of the functional design targets and basic features the Q-series. Second, presentation of an extensive set of biomechanically based design and performance targets for a multi-directional 3-year-old dummy. These targets include anthropometry specifications and front and side biofidelity response targets. Third, providing details of the current state of development, design and performance of the prototype 3 year-old version of the Q-series, the Q3. FUNCTIONAL DESIGN TARGETS OF THE Q-SERIES OF CHILD DUMMIES AND Q3 BASIC FEATURES The most important functional design targets for the Q-series are presented in this section and have been established in close co-operation with the Child Dummy Working Group (CDWG) [5] taking into account injury data of children [12]. HEAD AND NECK - A correct kinematic response of the head-neck system of child dummies is of great importance to quantify the protection offered by CRSs in terms of head excursion and acceleration. Whereas kinematic data of real children are rare, the dummy should at least simulate basic aspects of a child's anatomy and anthropometry. The Q3 dummy has separate joints at the occipital condyles (OC) and atlas- axis (C1-C2). These joints represent the low-resistance, large range of motion joints that are also present in the human neck and largely affect the head kinematics. The rest of the neck (C2-C7) is simulated by a flexible column, allowing bending, twist, and to a limited degree shear, compression and elongation. The Q3 head is a semi-rigid component (Figure 1). A multiple linear accelerometer array can be installed to assess rotational head accelerations. THORAX - The thorax should allow injury assessment based on deflection measurements or overall thorax accelerations. The Q3 thorax includes a Figure 2. The Q3 ribcage and shoulder complex viewed from the back. rib-cage type structure, mounted onto a rigid thoracic spine box. The shape of the rib-cage is derived from anthropometry data and analyses of X-rays of real children [7], SHOULDERS AND ARMS - No injury assessment takes place in the shoulder, however, the shoulder design has a large influence on the overall kinematics of the dummy. The shoulder of the Q3 incorporates a ball and socket joint to simulate the humerus-scapula joint, a scapula distributing load at the back, an anatomically shaped clavicle which is connected to the sternum area of the rib-cage by a flexible coupling and a flexible, compressible column between the ball and socket joint and the thoracic spine box (Figure 2). The flexible clavicle coupling and flexible column of the shoulder are tuned to represent the biomechanical shoulder response. The initial position of the upper arm is controlled by a click-stop. These features provide the shoulder with the following characteristics: • Interaction with belt systems Is realistic or tends to a worst-case condition. This means that the dummy is designed to amplify the effects of poor anchorages by sliding out of the belts in oblique loading, but also to work properly with acceptable anchorages. Load carrying parts of the shoulder are the clavicle in contact with belts, scapula in rearward facing impact and humerus in lateral Impact. Each of these elements is represented. • The anatomical shoulder is a "floating joint". This means that in real life a lateral impact to the shoulder primarily results in loading the ribcage. Loads on the Q3 shoulder are not directly transferred to the spine box nor to the shoulder at the non impact side. They will result in ribcage loading either through the arm or directly onto the ribcage. 3534</page><page sequence="3">The kinematics of the arm are very much affected by the kinematics of the shoulder. In a dummy they can have large effects on the measurements taken at the neck and thorax. Therefore the shoulder of the Q3 has appropriate ranges of motion in all main directions. The initial position of the arms is controlled since this affects the overall dummy kinematics substantially. ABDOMEN AND LUMBAR SPINE - The Q3 abdomen is designed as a one-piece deformable element, allowing considerable deformation which takes place both as a result of bending of the complete dummy and as a result of contact loading (Figure 3). The lumbar spine is represented by a flexible column. The Q3 incorporates transducers to study submarining: a lower lumbar spine load cell, accelerometers at the pelvis (see next section) and a load sensor at the back of the abdomen which is mounted onto a bracket connected at the lumbar spine-pelvis junction. Additional measurement of lap belt forces, not part of the dummy, is highly recommended to detect submarining. The abdomen is made of a high density, compressible material to obtain a correct mass distribution. PELVIS - Whereas the abdomen is at high risk of injury in case of submarining, this phenomenon starts at the legs and pelvis. A lot of attention has been paid to designing anatomically shaped bony parts of the pelvis, using anthropometry data and X-rays of real children [7], The Q3 pelvis is not a rigid element but is made of a semi-rigid plastic skeletal structure, covered by flexible flesh and skin. LEGS - The compression characteristics of the upper legs are tuned to biomechanical data which is important to assess the risk of submarining [7]. JACKET - The Q3 is provided with a soft jacket, not simulating an anatomical structure but representing the combination of skin and clothing (Figure 5). The jacket itself is not biomechanically validated, however, Table 1. Summary of Q3 available instrumentation.

The degree of human fidelity of a crash dummy is expressed as anthropometry and biofidelity. ANTHROPOMETRY - The Q3 dummy represents a 50th percentile 3-year-old child. All anthropometry data of this dummy have been derived from the TNO child anthropometry database CANDAT [13]. CANDAT includes over a hundred dimensions of children obtained from several sources, mainly originating from Northern America and Northern Europe. Individual data sets have been compared and pooled to obtain data sets describing the size and shape of children from 3 months up to 1 8 years. Gaps between individual data sets are filled using interpolation. CANDAT does not only provide external dimensions of children, but also can assist in creating linkage systems Table 2.

Table 2 includes main body dimensions of a 3-year-old child. Whereas anthropometry data is usually obtained with subjects in a straight sitting posture, the reference of the Q3 is reclined to better reflect a child's seating position in a CRS. The neck of the Q3 makes an angle of 22 degrees with the thorax, such that if the dummy is reclined at 22 degrees from the vertical, the head is horizontal. The pelvis angle of the Q3 has been chosen such that it represents a child sitting in a CRS [7], The dummy segments' masses and centers of gravity positions are established using regression formulas, based on a number of sources [14,15,16]. The total body is divided into 1 1 segments: the head and neck, the upper torso, the lower torso, the upper arm (2), the lower arm and hand (2), the upper leg (2) and the lower leg and foot (2). Currently available anthropometry data and regression formulas do not justify to segment the body in more detail to calculate the inertial characteristics. Table 3 gives the segment masses of a 3-year-old child. Segment moments of inertia are based on the same sources [14,15,16] but a slightly different segmentation is published. Table 4 gives the principal moments of inertia of a 3-year-old child as can be established from published regression formulas. Moments of inertia in x- and y-direction of most segments are equal since these segments are modeled as simple ellipsoids (transversal moments of inertia listed in Table 4), except for the torso for which a one ellipsoid model is considered too coarse. BIOFIDELITY RESPONSE TARGETS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROTOTYPE Q3 - At present, very little data exists on the biomechanical response of real children that can serve as a basis to define child dummy biofidelity response targets [17], Therefore, front and side impact response targets are established by scaling [18,19] according to the procedure presented in the Appendix. The scaling applied here is based on differences between adult and child subjects in terms of geometry and stiffness. Scaling factors for geometry are based on a well established set of anthropometry data for the 50th percentile male subject [20] and CANDAT [13]. Scaling factors for stiffness are based on published data of human tissues [6,21 ,22]. Damping is not scaled, for the lack of biomechanical data, implying equal damping characteristics for the adult and child subjects [8]. A summary of the front and side response targets established after scaling to a 3-year-old child, is given in Table 5. This set of targets is a result of a comprehensive review of biomechanical data of adult subjects, as presented in the Appendix. Note that the prescribed response targets should not be applied as strictly as for adults, due to the uncertainties and assumptions in the scaling procedure. 3536</page><page sequence="5">Table 5.

Head response targets are expressed as peak resultant head acceleration. The target was scaled to estimate the response of a 3-years old. The Q3 prototype head was dropped onto flat, rigid impact surface using an instant-release mechanism. The head for frontal testing was oriented so that the head z-axis made an angle of 28.5° with the horizontal when the mid-sagittal plane was vertical. For side impact testing, the mid-sagittal plane made an angle of 35° with the impact surface. The dummy head was instrumented with a tri-axial accelerometer located at the center of gravity. The CFC 1000 filtered resultant acceleration responses based on three tests each are presented in Table 6. The initial tests show the current Q3 prototype head does not yet meet the biomechanical design targets. More biomechanical tests will be performed after the head is modified. Neck - Flexion-extension and lateral flexion bending response targets have been established by scaling volunteer and PMHS sled test data of Mertz and Patrick [24], and Patrick and Chou [25]. Figure 6 shows the scaled moment-angle relationships. No equivalent sled tests with the Q3 have been conducted yet to compare the neck response with the scaled response target, primarily because this would include scaling of the test condition which has not yet been performed. Shoulder - The Q3 shoulder target is based on lateral impactor tests conducted by the APR [26]) and specifies the shoulder's reaction to prescribed lateral impact.

Frontal thoracic impact force versus deflection histories and response corridors at 4.3 (top) and 6.7 m/s. Thorax - Scaled Kroell [27] and GM/HSRI [28,29] corridors form the performance targets for the Q3 ribcage. In both cases the prescribed test condition is an impactor test, using a pendulum (mass 3.8 kg, 82 mm diameter) to strike the dummy chest at 4.3 m/s and 6.7 m/s. The actual impactor mass, 3.97 kg, used for verifying the Q3 prototype dummy exceeds somewhat the prescribed mass, for which the corridors presented here are slightly corrected (Figure 8 and 9). The dummy (with suit) was seated in an upright sitting position on a flat, horizontal surface without back support. For frontal testing, the arms and legs were extended horizontally forward and parallel to the mid-sagittal plane. In order to impact the ribcage in lateral direction, the arm on the impact side was raised and placed behind the head. The centerline of the impactor is centered either at mid- sternum (front) or on the rib structure at the level of the xiphoid process (side). The pendulum was released from heights that produced the required impact velocities of 4.3 and 6.7 m/s. The dummy was instrumented to measure the sternal/lateral rib deflection using the string potentiometer inside the thorax. The impactor was Figure 9. Lateral impact force-time (top) and T1 acceleration versus time histories and response corridors at 4.3 m/s. instrumented to measure its acceleration during impact. All measurements were recorded according to the SAE Recomm. Practice J21 1 , except for lateral impactor and spine accelerations that were filtered 100 Hz FIR. The impactor force versus sternal deflection corridors and responses are given in Figure 8 for 4.3 and 6.7 m/s front impacts. When comparing the test data to the scaled corridors, the initial peak force is too high. Although similar high peaks were noted in the original adult cadaver data (that were not taken into account for establishing the recommended corridors [30, 31]), the contact properties of the Q3 prototype ribcage should be improved. For 6.7 m/s impacts bottoming-out of the chest on the string potentiometer/ thoracic spine occurs. Figure 9 shows the side impact biomechanical targets and impactor force versus time and lateral T1 acceleration versus time histories at 4.3 m/s. Side impact thoracic tests at 6.7 m/s have not been conducted. Initial tests indicate that the peak force is on the high end of the scaled corridor. Further analysis indicated that the impactor face bottomed on part of the shoulder joint resulting in unrealistic peak T1 acceleration and impactor force. 3538</page><page sequence="7">Figure 10. Abdominal 0.5 m/s belt test response and performance corridor for Q3. Abdomen - Scaled abdominal response targets were developed on the basis of dynamic belt test data by Rouhana [32] and oblique impactor test data by Viano [28]. For belt load testing, the Q3 dummy was placed in an upright sitting position on a flat, horizontal surface with Figure 11. Abdominal impact force versus time histories at 4.8 m/s (top) and 6.8 m/s and response corridors. back support. The impacting object was a 381 mm (1 5") length of 25 to 30 mm wide polyester standard safety belt. The belt was attached to a yoke through two pivots and the yoke was attached to a horizontal pneumatically driven piston. Prior to impact all slack was removed from the belt. The Q3 abdominal load sensor was not installed. The abdomen was loaded by the standard belt at the level just above the iliac wings in the anterior posterior direction at 1 .0 m/s velocity up to 90 mm. Axial force developed and abdominal deflection were recorded. All measurements were recorded according to SAE Recommended Practice J21 1 . Figure 10 shows the test data and the scaled response corridor. The initial dynamic stiffness of the abdomen, 14 N/mm, is near the target value of 1 1 N/mm, the response is within the established corridor up to approx. 60 mm deflection. In practice, bottoming-out will occur after ± 65 mm as the abdominal load sensor will prohibit further deflection. Pendulum tests similar to those conducted for the thorax were conducted on the abdomen, but at 4.8 and 6.8 m/s and at 60° from the A-P direction as specified in the Appendix. The responses of three identical tests are shown in 11 and Figure 12 and are within or close to the design targets. Figure 12.

Lateral pelvic impact force versus time history and response corridor for the Q3 subjected to 5.2 m/s 3.8 kg pendulum impacts. Pelvis - The performance of the Q3 pelvis is defined for side impacts only. The performance target is scaled down from low severity lateral blunt impactor data by GM [28], For testing of the Q3 prototype pelvis, a 3.96 kg, 82 mm rigid cylinder with flat impact face was used. The dummy was seated in an upright position on a flat, horizontal surface without back support. The centerline of the impactor was positioned such that the impact was aimed at the greater trochanter. The pendulum was released from a height that produced an impact velocity of 5.2 m/s. Both pelvis and impactor are instrumented to measure the acceleration during impact. All measurements were recorded according to the SAE Recommended Practice J21 1 , except the impactor accelerations that were filtered 100 Hz FIR. For three repetitive impacts, the impactor force versus time histories of the dummy are shown in Figure 13. The responses show that the performance of the Q3 prototype pelvis design is very close to the corridors Thiahs - Strap force-lap belt penetration corridors have been proposed by Renault (Chamouard et al. [7]) as design targets for the thigh stiffness of child dummies aged 3 to 1 0 years. In order to test the Q3 dummy legs, a special support rest was made. The dummy was placed on its back with the upper legs parallel, and lying against the vertical board. A standard 47 mm belt (1 0% elongation) was looped around the upper legs. The end of the belt were fastened to a metal yoke, that was attached to a pneumatically driven displacement device. A force transducer was put between the yoke and pneumatic displacer. The displacement was defined as the average of the deformation of the left and right leg and was measured by a string potentiometer attached to a small metal plate put on top of the legs. After removing the Figure 14. Static belt loading responses of Q3 thighs and response corridor. slack from the belt, the thighs were loaded until about 50 daN and subsequently unloaded to record the recovery of the legs. A complete cycle took about 60 s. Figure 14 shows the response in terms of force-belt penetration and the targets defined by Renault. DISCUSSION - For a number of body parts, the responses of the Q3 prototype have been compared with the established corridors. Testing indicates that already some of these parts are close to the targets set for the design. Regarding the accuracy of the scaling method and the assumptions made in the process, it can be concluded that the abdomen, pelvis and thighs are now sufficiently biofidelic. Components that need to be modified for the next prototype are the head and thorax. The stiffness of the Q3 head will be reduced by increasing the skin thickness (and at the same time reducing the skull size to maintain the correct outer shape). The ribcage and its attachments to the vertebral spine and clavicles will undergo a re-design to prevent bottoming and to introduce more damping. The neck and shoulder parts not yet tested to date, will be tested as part of the ongoing biomechanical test program. The dummy will be refined once all the biomechanical tests have been conducted. CONCLUSION The development of injury assessing child dummies is in some ways more complex than that of adult dummies. Four to five sizes are necessary to cover the complete child population up to 12 years. Size limitations play a very important role in selecting instrumentation, mechanical constructions and materials. Limited data is available on actual child responses to impact, complicating the biomechanical validation of a dummy design. Injury data of children is available, however, their level of detail is limited, complicating the process of performing injury risk analyses. Child dummy development hence requires a 3540</page><page sequence="9">special approach, in several aspects different from that of adult dummy development. TNO in cooperation with the CDWG has initiated the development of a advanced series of child dummies as the successor of the current P-series. The Q-series of dummies will have improved anthropometry based on the CAN DAT database and actual child X-ray scans, biofidelity based on scaled adult targets and child biomechanical data, and enhanced injury assessment capabilities. The first dummy of the Q-series, the 3-year old Q3, has undergone prototype testing and will shortly be available for wordwide evaluation. A 6-year old and 9 months old version will be available by the end of next year. Early 1996, in the frame of the European CREST Project, the Q-series dummies have been selected and proposed as improved dummies for both front and side impacts. The criteria of protection will be defined for this new series of dummies, based on an extensive program of real-world accident reconstructions including both front and side impacts.

Rouhana, Viano, Jędrzejczak and McCleary, Assessing Submarining And Abdominal Injury Risk In The Hybrid III Family Of Dummies, SAE892440, 1989 APPENDIX SCALING OF BIOMECHANICAL RESPONSE TARGETS - In biomechanics, scaling is a mathematical technique to derive response characteristics or tolerance levels for a specific population based on knowledge of responses of another population. In the past, scaling predominately has been performed between different adult subjects in order to normalize the test data to a standard subject size [1] and to establish biomechanical response targets for adult size small female and large male dummies [2]. In both cases the differences in physical dimensions are not large and moduli of elasticity and mass densities of model and prototype are assumed the same. For scaling of adults to children, however, the developing mechanical properties of bones and tissues in children have to be taken into account. Melvin et al. [3] applied scaling techniques to estimate the injury assessment reference values (lARVs) for a 6-month infant dummy, that includes biomechanical knowledge on tendon and skull properties of children. A similar approach based on scaling of physical dimensions and elastic moduli, is used to scale biomechanical response targets for a 3-year old child. More on the subject of scaling can be found in [1 ,2 3,4,5]. Scale factors - Consider two bodies labelled adult and child respectively. For every key body dimension X, Y, Z (adult), x, y, z (child) the length scale factor is defined by, x/X := A.x ; y/Y := Xy ; z/Z := Xz (1) Assuming equal density for adult and child objects, the mass M scale factor RM can be defined as m/M = When both bodies are loaded statically so that an identical strain distribution exists in both bodies, the deformation components (or deflection) D will scale with, dyDx = Xx ; dyDy = ; dJDz - A.z (2) As adult and child do not necessarily have equal material properties, the scaling of force, F, from adult to child does not follow directly from the assumption of identical strain distribution. Assuming a linear stress- strain relationship, the force scale factor, RF, follows from the E-modulus and shear modulus which are assumed to scale both with the scaling factor RE f/F x = Re.'Xz ; f/FY = ReAA ; f/Fz = R,Uy (3) Linear stiffness K equals force divided by deformation, hence, the stiffness scale factors, RK, inx, y and z direction are given by, M&lt;x = RE.y.A (4a) k/KY = R E. (4b) kJKz = Be'yXz (4c) All other scaling factors for the physical quantities associated with the description of impact response can be expressed in terms of the scale factors for length dimensions, mass and stiffness. Scaling of head drop test response - Assuming that the head impact test condition can be represented as a single spring-mass system of mass, M, and spring, K, that strikes a rigid surface with a velocity V„ [3], the scale factors for peak displacement, RD, acceleration, Ra, and force, RF, can be expressed as, RD = d/D = (RM/RKr (5) Ra=a/A = (RK/RMr (6) RF = f/F = (RKRMf (7) Child head response requirements are obtained by substituting the mass scale factor for the head and the appropriate stiffness scale factor component for frontal and side impact. Scaling of neck bending response - The resistive moment to neck bending, T, is provided by the neck muscles. A scaling method based on the muscular moment arm and cross-sectional area of the neck muscles was presented by Wolanin et al. [6] and Mertz and al. [2]. Using 3542</page><page sequence="11">the same equations, the scale factor for the bending moment about the x- and y-axis, RT, can be expressed as, t/Tx = RAV; t/Ty = re-W (8) Given a certain elongation of the neck, the rotation angles are proportional to the length and inversely proportional to the effective arm. As noted in reference [2], this can be used to define the angle scale factor l' If R&lt;p is smaller than unity, this means the range of motion (R.O.M.) of a child is smaller than that of an adult. Wolanin et al. [6], however, stated that the R.O.M. of children is comparable to the various adult ranges (60°±10° flexion, 70°±20° extension for the male adult). Therefore head to torso angulation scaling is not performed. Scaling of impactor tests - For the shoulder, thorax, abdomen and pelvis tests, the impact conditions are represented by a rigid pendulum mass, Mp, striking the body mass, M, which has a spring stiffness, K, at a impact velocity V0 . The scale factors for displacement, Rd, acceleration, RA, and force, RF, and time, RT can be expressed as, Rd = d/D = (Rmp Rm (Mp+ M))1/2/(Rk (mp+ m))1/2 (9) RF = f/F = RKRD (10) RA = a/A = RKRD/RM (11) RT = t/T = 1/Ra (12) where R^ is the ratio between the impactor masses applied in adult (Mp, M, K) and child (mp, m, k) system tests. To establish the stiffness scale factor for the frontal thoracic response, an analogy can be drawn between the parameters that influence the stiffness of the thorax, and the stiffness of a rib with elliptical cross- section [2]. The scale factor is given by, rk = rE YzYX3 / V (13) where yz and yx are the ratios of the rib cross- section length dimensions. SELECTION AND PRESENTATION OF Q3 BIOMECHANICAL RESPONSE TARGETS - The majority of the requirements given for the Q3 are established by adult-to-child scaling of adult bio- mechanical impact response targets.The adult impact response targets to be scaled are the result of a critical evaluation of data selected from cadaver and volunteer experiments using the most-up-to date information available. In general, the following criteria were used for selection: • Impact response requirements should allow scaling techniques to be applied; • Scaling of biofidelity targets is based on linear elasticity and only tolerable when no fractures or severe injuries are produced (&lt; AIS 3); • Data should be of high quality and generally accepted by experts in the field; • Test conditions should be clear and well- documented; • Priority is given to targets that are already used for adult crash dummies and/or have been proposed by ISO or EEVC. • Priority is given to targets based on pendulum data instead of sled test data, as the test conditions are uncomplicated and tests are more easily reproduced. • Priority is given to dynamic data above static data. Besides these, EEVC [7] criteria for cadaver data to be useful for defining biofidelity targets, have been taken into account, if appropriate. A comprehensive report on the biomechanical data reviewed, the criteria used for selection and the scaling procedure can be found in [8]. Head - A summary of head impact response data is given in Table 7. The head biofidelity targets for most accepted adult dummies (e.g. Part 572, Hybrid-Ill, Eurosid-1) have been established from cadaver drop tests conducted by Hodgson and Thomas in the seventies [9]. The human head mechanical response characteristics presented in SAE J1460 [10] were selected for scaling. The factors used for scaling head drop data are given in Table 13. The corresponding peak acceleration limits for a 130 mm Q3 head drop on a rigid surface are 121 ± 32 G and 126 ± 33 G for front and side impact respectively (Table 6). Neck - In the past twenty-five years, a fair amount of experimental data has been published on the response of the human head-neck system in dynamic test conditions, as listed in Table 8. Best referenced are the so-called Mertz corridors [11,12] for sagittal flexion and extension and lateral flexion that quantify the head- neck response in terms of rotation of the head relative to the torso as a function of bending moments at the O.C. junction. Although moment-angle corridors are now generally considered to be an insufficient condition to ensure humanlike response [13], they are relatively easy to interpret and thereby attractive to use as design targets for the Q3 dummy neck. The factors to scale the neck bending response targets are given in Table 13. The corresponding corridors are shown in Figure 6. 3543</page><page sequence="12">Table 7. PMHS head impact data.

(1989) I cadaver [torsion Shoulder - Lateral impact responses of the shoulder have been obtained using two types of test conditions (Table 9): full-body lateral sled tests, the cadaver subjects striking a rigid/padded vertical wall, and lateral pendulum impacts applied directly to the shoulder. The Q3 shoulder requirement is based on lateral impactor tests conducted by the APR [14] and specifies the shoulder's reaction to prescribed lateral pendulum impacts. This requirement is recommended in ISO TR 9790-4 [15] as design targets for a side impact test dummy. For the Q3, an impactor mass is chosen to produce the same percent lateral compression as the mid-size male. To yield this condition, the impactor mass is equally scaled as the body mass. The scaled maximum lateral deflection is given in Table 13, the impactor force-time corridor is presented in Figure 7. Thorax - A summary of PMHS and volunteer impact response data on the thorax is given in Table 10. Two types of thoracic loading conditions were studied: blunt object impacts and diagonal belt loading. Dummy response definition recommendations for frontal thoracic impact have been set up by Lobdell et al. [22], based on two series of blunt-frontal, mid-sagittal impactor tests on adult cadaver chests reported by Kroell et al. [23,24], Nahum et al. [25,26] and Stalnaker et al. [27]. These impactor force-chest deflection corridors are well established and have been previously subjected to scaling in [2]. The force-deflection corridors for 4.3 and 6.7 m/s impacts are scaled for the Q3 using the scale factors in Table 13 and are shown In Figure 8. Not included in the scaling, however, are originally proposed adjustments of the load level upward by 667 N to account for the lack of muscle tone in the cadaver subjects [27]. These were excluded as for children muscle tone is believed to have relatively little effect on the chest response. 3544</page><page sequence="13">Table 9. PMHS lateral shoulder impact response data.

The original data were combined to set impact response requirements for dummies subjected to pure lateral impacts at 4.3 and 6.7 m/s respectively. The corridors for a 3-year old presented in Figure 9 were established with the scale factors given in Table 13. Similar to the frontal requirements, the scaled corridors do not include the proposed force increase. Abomen - In the past twenty years, there have been a number of laboratory studies on abdominal injury tolerance and response under blunt impact by a rigid object (steering-wheel or armrest) and belt loading conditions. These studies have used either animals, human cadavers or volunteers as test subjects. Table 1 1 presents eight main sets of abdominal response data which are published recently. Many sets are not suitable for establishing dummy design targets as test conditions can not be duplicated or the corridors contain massively injured cadaver data. In this perspective, the corridors for force-deflection and force-time responses for 60°oblique blunt abdominal impact proposed by GM [40] are considered more valuable and appropriate for scaling purposes. 3545</page><page sequence="14">Table 11.

The accuracy of adult-to-child scaling based on dimensions and stiffness in general is limited by the lack of accurate knowledge on material properties of children, and by the restrictions of the scaling technique itself.

Vertical pelvic impact response data were not reviewed due to their low importance in car accidents. An overview of pelvic response data sets in frontal and lateral impacts is given in Table 12. Performance targets for the Q3 peivis were defined for side impacts only. A set of requirements consisting of force-deflection and force- time corridors for blunt lateral pelvic impact at two severities was derived by Viano [40]. These requirements are particularly attractive to use as design targets, because the impactor and test velocities are similar to the thorax test. It was decided to scale the impactor mass to 3.8 kg, which allowed us to apply the same impactor for the thorax, shoulder and thorax performance tests. As the child dummy under identical test conditions would experience a higher percent lateral compression as the mid-size male, only the low severity data were selected. Using the scale factors in Table 13, the force-time corridor for blunt lateral pelvic impacts at 5.2 m/s for the Q3 dummy was produced (Figure 13). Thiahs - It is essential that the child dummy accurately represents the interaction between seat belt and thighs in order to reproduce the phenomenon of submarining. For this reason, Chamouard et al. [57] have carried out static thigh compression tests on children between 3 and 10 years. A strap force-thigh penetration corridor has been proposed that 3-to-10 year test dummies should comply to be considered as representative in terms of initial stiffness. This requirement based on actual child biomechanical data was added to the set of scaled requirements of the Q3. The corridor is shown in Figure 14. REFERENCES 1 .
