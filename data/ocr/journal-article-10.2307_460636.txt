<plain_text><page sequence="1">TYPE AND PROTO-PHENOMENON IN GOETHE'S SCIENCE* By Heinrich Henel AS MY STARTING point I shall take a statement about Goethe's -*"^ relation to science which is both recent and precise, and which was made by Ronold King, professor of physics at Harvard University. Ac? cording to King, Goethe was a true scientist in every respect, except that he limited his inquiry in two ways: he practiced observational science but rejected experimental science; and he formulated scientific insight in terms of fundamental principle, but not in terms of mathematical law. Goethe's aversion to experimental science is explained by King as a fear of analytical processes which do not lead to a subsequent reintegration or synthesis, and this fear, in turn, is attributed to Goethe's failure to understand that the application of mathematics to the findings of ex? perimental science produces precisely such syntheses. King believes that "if Goethe had anticipated that out of analysis and planned experiment might rise the great tower of systematic world-science . . . he would have met the challenge of mathematics in nature and in life as resolutely and as effectively as he had met the challenge of observational science to the anti-rationalism of his youth."1 I doubt that many scientists will be as broad-minded as King and admit to their ranks a man who avoids the use of apparatus and mathe? matics. And, more important, I doubt the correctness of King's assump- tion that Goethe did not know what he was doing when he refused to venture very deeply into experimental science, and when he rejected completely the use of mathematical concepts as a means of expressing general principles. It may be conceded readily that Goethe's under? standing of mathematics was slight, and that, in particular, he failed to grasp its erficacy as a tool for integrating knowledge; but I wish to argue nevertheless that he understood mathematics well enough to know that it would not do the things he wanted to do, and that its integrations were different in kind from the syntheses for which he strove. And I wish to argue also that Goethe was fully aware of the assistance which * Beginning and end of this study were presented as a paper at the Sixth Triennial Congress of the International Federation for Modern Languages and Literatures and have since been published in its Proceedings, Literature and Science (Oxford, Blackwell, 1955), pp. 216-221. 1 Goethe on Human Creativeness and Other Goethe Essays, ed.

I have said advisedly "the wrong kind of results," and not "wrong results." Unfortunately, Goethe himself did not make this distinction with sufficient clarity. He often spoke of his work as if it were part of the accepted science of his day, and when he admitted (as indeed he was forced to) the inconsistency of much of his teaching with that of science, he tried to win the scientists over to his side. Thus in the most obvious and celebrated case?his struggle against Newton's optics?he spoke and wrote as if he could not be right unless Newton were wrong, whereas in actual fact the two theories of colors are based on totally different basic assumptions and hence are not really comparable. In other words, Goethe did not always remember that scientific insight is insight of a special kind, and that scientific truth is not necessarily the only kind of truth available to man. Much is made, in the literature on our subject, of those parts of Goethe's work which have stood the test of science and have be? come part of its doctrine: his contribution to the physiology of colors, for example, or his role as one of the initiators of morphology. But these mat- ters can be overemphasized: if Goethe had not made these discoveries, other scientists would have made them.2 Had his way of studying nature not differed radically from scientific method, his name would be found in small print in some handbooks on the history of science, but would not otherwise be remembered in the annals of man's exploration of nature. The real importance of Goethe as a student of nature lies in the fact that he was the last great figure in the Western world to offer an alterna- tive to what is now known as science. He was wrong when he claimed superior truth or validity for this alternative; but he may have been right when, as on other occasions, he asserted that it was healthier and more in keeping with the needs of man. As regards experimental science, three points may be made. The first point concerns Goethe's dislike of manipulating nature or of "improving" upon it. He was convinced that there was a basic harmony in all creation, that man and nature are made for each other, and that the processes by which civilization modifies na? ture and turns it to more convenient use must be restrained by caution and reverence so as not to upset that harmony. Secondly, Goethe wished 2 Some of Goethe's discoveries, notably that of the intermaxillary bone in man, had actually been made before his time. His essays, "Meteore des literarischen Himmels" (JA, xxxrx, 37-43) and "Erfinden und Entdecken" (JA, xxxix, 44r46), discuss the ques? tion of priority.</page><page sequence="3">Heinrich Henel 653 to keep a direct relationship between the total sensibility of the observer and the observed phenomenon. Results obtained in this fashion are crude compared with those obtained with precision instruments, but they are true to the observer rather than true to his tools. They provide him with knowledge with which he can cope, not knowledge which may overwhelm him. The third point, finally, was put succinctly by Goethe himself when he said that nature falls silent when put on the rack ("Die Natur ver- stummt auf der Folter"). What he meant was that the answers extracted by the high-pressure tools of experimental science are not spoken by nature, or at least not by that nature which we see and feel around us. Here Goethe has been corroborated by a modern physicist, Werner Heisenberg, who in a paper published in 1941 pointed out that "science no longer deals with the world which offers itself to us directly, but with the dark background of this world which we bring to light by our experi- ments. Surely, then, this 'objective' world is produced, as it were, only by our active interference, by the refined technique of our observation."3 Goethe's point, then, was that experimental science produces a highly specialized view of nature, which is certainly not the only possible view and may not be the view most congenial to man and most conducive to his happiness. As regards Goethe's rejection of mathematics, I shall adduce only two passages explaining his reasons. In an essay written in 1784 or 1785 and published posthumously under the title of "Philosophische Studie," Goethe argued against measuring living organisms, because their iden- tity eludes comparison with other objects and because all measurement constitutes a comparison (JA, xxxix, 7). And in an osteological paper (on the bones in the forearm and the lower leg) written in 1795 and published in 1824, Goethe declared that "bare number and measurement nullify form and banish the spirit of living observation" (ibid, p. 205). The first of these reasons is philosophical, the second of a more practical kind. Science does not attempt to define individual identity and may therefore rely on the "magic of numbers" to reduce diversity to identity. Goethe, on the other hand, was concerned with identity of a totally diflerent kind?the identity of the one object before him, which he wished to pre- serve wrhole and unimpaired. The mental equivalents of physical reality which science produces are mathematical concepts gained through analy- sis and reintegration, whereas Goethe strove for mental equivalents re- sembling photographic images or rather moving pictures (because his idea of "Gestalt" or form in eludes the idea of change). Again this is not a question of right or wrong, but rather a difference of basic assumptions s "Die Goethe'sche und die Newton'sche Farbenlehre im Lichte der modernen Physik," Geist der Zeit, xrx (1941), 270.</page><page sequence="4">654 Goethe's Science and ultimate purpose. It is the difference between quantity and quality, between abstraction and intuition, between science and art. I shall re? turn to this later. Turning now to the positive content of Goethe's teaching about na? ture, we are faced with two terms which he coined and which have at- tracted a great deal of attention. I refer, of course, to the "Typus" or type and to the "Urphanomen" or proto-phenomenon. First of all it should be said that these two terms must not be confused or identified. The type concept arose from Goethe's biological studies and is clearly present in The Metamorphosis of Planls of 1790. The idea of proto- phenomena, on the other hand, was first foreshadowed in an essay of 1792, but the word was not introduced until 1810 in the Theory of Colors. The type is a morphological concept, a generalized form, a model or pat? tern according to which nature is supposed to fashion the individuals of a certain species. For example, Goethe believed he was able to discern the type "leaf," the type "annual plant," the type "skull," the type "bone structure of mammals," etc. The type is found by comparison of empiri- cal objects with one another, and it embraces both their similarity and their variations. It is a flexible norm allowing for the changes occurring during the life of an individual organism as well as for the variations oc? curring among the individuals of a certain kind or species. It is not, how? ever, a phylogenetic concept, that is, it does not include changes which appear in the evolution of the kind or species itself. Thus I cannot agree with those who have hailed Goethe as a forerunner of Darwin. Hans Fischer, a member of the Medical Faculty of Zurich University, has stated the case correctly in his excellent brief survey, Goetkes Nalurwis- senschafl. He says: "A few passages in [Goethe's] scientific writings indi? cate that he had an occasional inkling of evolutionary theory. . . . How? ever, this point of view was not important for him. The theory of evolu? tion was not a valid problem for one who was interested in comparative morphology and anatomy. He was satisfied with an understanding of the homologous structure of the vertebrates." And Fischer adds: "The modern geneticist cannot but view with a certain skepticism efforts to develop a theory of organic form wholly separate from the biological conditions of heredity and evolution."4 The type concept, like Goethe's thought in general, is difficult to grasp because it attempts to reconcile the notions of the static and the dynamic. It includes the idea of change, but not irrevocable change, not change as linear progress or evolution in history. Change in Goethe's sense is more like rotation, which reveals successively and recurrently * (Zurich, 1950), pp. 37, 39. Cf. Karl Vietor, Goethe: Dichhmg, Wissenschaft, Weltbild (Bern, 1949), pp. 395-399.</page><page sequence="5">Heinrich Henel 655 the qualities of a permanent and stable essence. Terms like "Bildung" and "Gestaltung," which he used in his morphology, are intentionally ambiguous, referring to both being and growth, and this ambiguity be? comes explicit in his famous phrase, "Dauer im Wechsel." The type is precisely this: it is the essential and permanent form which may be per- ceived through observation of changing shapes. A necessary corollary of these views, and a most important one for Goethe, was the belief that there are limits to what is empirically discov- erable. He was convinced that "nature creates according to ideas," and that his own ideas (the types) were commensurate with those of nature. The type, being the intellectual image of that which exists, at the same time excludes that which does not exist. It represents what is constant or recurrent in the infinite variety of empirical phenomena, and it draws a borderline between the possible and the impossible, the natural and the unnatural. Thus, to apprehend the type means to gain the power of prediction. Goethe's infinite delight when he got hold firmly of the type concept of plants?he called it "Urpflanze" at that time?sprang from his belief that he had won a significant victory over the strictly empirical scientists, because he could now foretell what plants, as yet unknown, might in the future be found to exist, and what other imaginary plants were purely fanciful and would never be found to exist. "Tell Herder," he wrote to Charlotte von Stein on 8 June 1787, "that I am very close to the secret of plant organization and that it is the simplest thing imag- inable. . . . The primal plant is going to be the most wonderful thing in the world. . . . With this model and the knowledge how to use it one could go on forever inventing plants that would be consistent and would have an inner necessity and truth."5 Similar remarks are found through? out Goethe's work, but I shall quote only one more, written in 1829 and therefore late in Goethe's life. It is the passage in which he confesses that he "moves consciously in the region where metaphysics and science overlap, and where an honest, faithful investigator prefers to dwell. For here he is no longer harried by the pressure of infinite detail, because he learns to appreciate the great effect of simple ideas which are capable of reducing variety to clarity in various ways."6 5 The translation is Barker Fairley's {A Study of Goethe, Oxford, 1947, p. 197). Goethe spoke in similar terms in a letter to Charlotte von Stein of 10 July 1786: "What pleases me most at present is plant-life. . . . The whole gigantic kingdom becomes so simple that I can see at once the answers to the most difficult problems. . . . And it is no dream or fancy; I am beginning to grow aware of the essential form with which, as it were, Nature always plays, and from which she produces her great variety. Had I the time in this brief span of life I am confident I could extend it to all the realms of Nature?the whole realm" (transla? tion taken from R. D. Gray, Goethe the Alchemist, Cambridge, 1952, pp. 62 f.). 8 Physiologische Bemerkungen (1829), JA, xxxix, 102; quoted by Fischer, p. 36. Cf. be- low, p. 663, n. 16a.</page><page sequence="6">656 Goethe's Science The concept of the proto-phenomenon is both more difiicult and more questionable than that of the type. It may be defined as a comprehensive phenomenon or a phenomenon of the highest order, because it reveals a principle which governs a whole sphere of nature. In everyday experience we are confronted with innumerable phenomena, no two of wThich are quite alike because of varying accidental conditions. The scientist de- termines the conditions through observation and experiment, controls them, and thus obtains a constant phenomenon. The scientific phenome? non is more comprehensive than the empirical phenomenon because it is subject to fewer conditions. Now, says Goethe, let us continue to elimi- nate conditions until we arrive at a point where only the minimum condi? tions are operative and where, if we remove another condition, no phe? nomenon will appear. The last, simplest phenomenon, subject to the few- est conditions, is the proto-phenomenon. It is the most inclusive, because once it is found we can reverse our procedure, add conditions, and thus derive all other phenomena from it. An example will show what is meant. When a light surface is seen through a turbid medium, the eye perceives a yellowish tint. Conversely, when a dark surface is seen through an illuminated turbid medium, the eye perceives a bluish tint. Only three conditions are present: light, dark? ness, and the turbid medium. This, then, is the "Urphanomen" of Goethe's color theory. He took it as proof that the colors are due to the opposition of light and darkness, and to turbidity mediating between them; that yellow and blue are the only basic colors; and that all other colors can be derived from them. Through other observations and experi- ments he found that green results from the mixture of yellow and blue; that orange and purple are produced through an intensification of yellow and blue, respectively; and that red is a combination of orange and pur? ple. Translating his results into general terms, Goethe declared that the colors reflect the polarity which is manifest in all nature (yellow belong- ing to the side of light and blue to the side of darkness), but that the polar opposites strive for totality through their reunification on a higher level. When yellow and blue are intensified, there appears in them a red- dish hue which is an enhancement or "Steigerung" of their original quali? ties; and when the enhanced colors orange and purple are combined, they lose their affinity to light or darkness and produce the "royal red," which is the highest color because it represents totality. Polarity and enhance? ment are the two great principles which operate in all nature and produce the great multiplicity of physical phenomena. As our example indicates, the concept of the proto-phenomenon was formed by Goethe in connection with his theory of colors; indeed this is the only example which he developed fully and methodically. On other</page><page sequence="7">Heinrich Henel 657 occasions, he spoke of the magnet, of the spiral vessels in plants, and of beauty as proto-phenomena, but these are incidental remarks which do not elucidate the term. In the context of Goethe's color theory, however, the concept has a definite function: it is intended to prove the epistemo- logical soundness of his methods. To understand Goethe's teaching about colors we must distinguish between his methods of investigation and his methods of explanation. Both differ from scientific method, but whereas the former are valuable and sound, the latter have aroused considerable doubt. Goethe's method as an investigator was to collect phenomena, preferably those observable in nature, but also those producible in the study or laboratory with comparatively simple apparatus. Whenever possible he observed with the naked eye, and when he used artificial aids such as the prism he trusted more in what he called subjective experi- ments (in which the object itself is viewed) than in objective experiments (in which the image cast by an object is viewed). In this manner he col? lected a vast amount of data, and it is his skill and diligence as an ob- server which distinguish him from philosophers of nature and from Pla- tonic idealists, and which have earned him the respect of professional scientists. On the other hand, he differs from scientists in that he took his observations not only as ultimate units of direct, empirical experience, but also as ultimate units of reliably ascertainable fact. He refused to break reality down into what in biology he called "Similarteile," homo- geneous elements of which we have no direct experience and which can be discovered only through a combination of intellectual analysis and ex? periments with complicated apparatus. And he was even less willing to reduce the visible world to a mathematical system in which differences of quality are expressed through numbers and numerical relationships. Just as in his biological studies he stopped short at fairly large units of form or organization such as the leaf, so in his physics he worked with com? paratively large units of experience which he called the phenomena. As he used it, the word phenomenon acquired a limiting quality: whatever lay beyond the phenomena was no longer solid fact but mere hypothesis and speculation. And since what he called a proto-phenomenon sum- marizes the evidence provided by the phenomena in a certain sphere of experience, Goethe, in at least three passages of his Theory of Colors, expressly forbade scientists to seek anything beyond it.7 The great attraction of Goethe's work, the joy it affords the reader, is due to its presenting a world which is immediately recognizable by all who can see. Indeed it teaches us to see, just as Goethe taught his col~ laborator Eckermann, and even his servant, to observe and to discover 7 H.

Reality to him was what the senses per- ceive; it was the great variety of shapes and forms and their qualitative differences. And this world of the senses will always be there, no matter what science says about it or does to it in its experiments. Hence it will always be valuable to observe nature in Goethe's way. He is the great antidote to science, or perhaps the touchstone of its adequacy to the needs of man as a natural being. Goethe as a student of nature is common sense and common sensibility personified. It is not possible to speak with equal assurance when one turns to Goethe's methods of explaimng the phenomena. Since he was un willing to push analysis to the point where he could operate with homogeneous elements (which are easily synthesized), he had to find the common denominator of fairly large units which were different in quality. Or, speaking paradoxically after Goethe's own manner, one might say that he wished to gain universals without abstraction, or that he attempted to grasp principles without letting go of the specific and the concrete. He himself gave two different explanations of how this might be done. The one, which he advanced in connection with his color theory and which in- volves the concept of proto-phenomena, seems implausible; the other, which he offered on many other occasions, is both more credible and more likely to describe his actual procedure. The Theory of Colors is predicated upon Goethe's struggle against New- tonian physics. He explained the color phenomena without recourse to mathematics, and this made it necessary for him to show that his gen? eralizations were just as reliable as mathematical formulae?indeed more so. He attempted to show this by insisting upon the strictly empiri- cal basis of his theory, or really by declaring that there was no theory at all and that the phenomena were simply allowed to speak for themselves. In the relevant passage of the Theory of Colors (? 175), Goethe says that the phenomena fall naturally into certain groups, that these groups in turn arrange themselves in categories of a higher order, and that the principles emerging from such a pyramidal arrangement of natural phenomena "are not revealed through words and hypotheses to the mind, but likewise through phenomena to the eye."8 These ultimate phenomena or proto-phenomena are arrived at without any interference by the hu? man mind and hence give a truer picture of reality than mathematical formulae. Nature has spoken in her own language, revealing her secret to the patient investigator who followed her step by step. The same ideas were advanced in an essay written eighteen years 8 Goethe's text is not entirely clear in this place. "Likewise" seems to refer to the groups just mentioned.</page><page sequence="9">Heinrich Henel 659 earlier and entitled "Der Versuch als Vermittler von Objekt und Sub- jekt" (1792).9 The essay mentions Goethe's Beitrage zur Oplik (published in 1791 and 1792 as the first fruits of his studies of color) and might be called a methodological appendix to them. Without actually naming him, the essay suggests that Newton's results were obtained by drawing con- clusions from a few isolated experiments and that his theories owed more to the observer's mind than to the observed phenomena; and it asserts that, by contrast, Goethe in his Beitrage attempted to find out what phenomena belong together in nature. To this end he repeated each ex- periment many times, varying the conditions only very slightly. Thus he obtained series of experiments which, as it were, amounted to a single experience viewed under various aspects. Such an experience Goethe calls "an experience of a higher kind." He compares it to a mathematical formula, for just as an algebraic formula expresses an infinite number of arithmetical problems, so an "experience of a higher kind" summarizes an infinite number of empirical experiences. It is the last statement which reveals most clearly Goethe's purpose in writing the essay. Here as in the Theory of Colors he is at pains to prove that his generalizations are at least as valid as mathematical generaliza- tions. He says "experience" instead of "phenomenon," and "experience of a higher kind" instead of "proto-phenomenon"; but it is clear that he means the same things. To be sure, this similarity was not seen by those who missed the connection of "Der Versuch als Vermittler" with the Bei? trage and therefore failed to appreciate that it is a piece of polemical writing.10 They have discussed the essay as if it were a wholly disinter- ested, definitive explanation of Goethe's methods. They have seized especially on the passage where Goethe describes how he arranged his ex? periments in series and, finding a formal similarity here to scientific meth? od, declared that he worked like a scientist. But they have overlooked the essential difference. Goethe asserts that nature itself prescribes the order in which the phenomena must be studied and arranged, and that his experiments were designed to discover this order. Scientific experiments, on the other hand, are made to test a hypothesis. Now it is true that no series of any kind can be established unless the mind has made a choice, unless there is a goal; and indeed I shall try to show presently that Goethe, too, proceeded from hypotheses. But the point which concerns us at the moment is that in "Der Versuch als Vermittler" Goethe denies this, 9 The MS. is dated 28 April 1792. It was sent to Schiller in 1798, but the essay was not published until 1823. 10 See, e.g., Ernst Cassirer, "Goethe und die mathematische Physik," Idee und Gestalt, 2nd ed. (Berlin, 1924), pp. 44, 63, 78.</page><page sequence="10">660 Goethe's Science that he speaks as if each phenomenon had only two neighbors and as if the problem were merely to find the one true linear series of phenomena. This presupposes an extraordinarily naive epistemology. It amounts to saying that physical reality is simply there, that it offers itself to the mind without being urged, and that the task of understanding consists merely in grasping what lies before the investigator's eyes. I have suggested that the concept of proto-phenomena as expounded in the Theory of Colors is untenable. The notion that it is possible to dis? tinguish between major and minor phenomena, that the latter may be subsumed under the former, and that nature itself guides the investigator in this enterprise seems no more than a pleasant fancy. And I have sug? gested also that proto-phenomenon is really a polemical term which Goethe invented in the heat of battle, but to which he clung and which tied him to an epistemology far too simple. The root trouble with the con? cept is that it denies, or at least minimizes, the intellectual element in cognition. This is also the reason for its inferiority (both epistemologically and in practical usefulness) to the concept of the type. For whereas the type is an idea (albeit nature's idea as much as man's), the proto-phenom? enon is a fact which reveals an idea, and this idea belongs to nature much more than to man. However, as I have said earlier, Goethe also gave a different explana- tion of how he understood nature, and this second explanation is much more convincing. Before we discuss it, we should note that both "Der Versuch als Vermittler" and the Theory of Colors contain passages which are irreconcilable with the concept of proto-phenomena. In the essay we read: "One may truly say of every phenomenon that it is connected with an infinite number of other phenomena, just as one may say of a freely suspended luminous point that it sends out rays in all directions." The conclusion to be drawn from Goethe's comparison is that there is no one true way (prescribed by nature itself) of arranging the phenomena in series. Strangely enough, he does not draw this conclusion, but immedi- ately goes on to say that when we have made an experiment we must find out "what borders it immediately, what is the next thing to follow" (Goethe's italics) (JA, xxxix, 23). In the Theory of Colors (? 359), on the other hand, Goethe does draw the necessary conclusions, but in so doing he destroys the basis for his concept of proto-phenomena. He says: "It should be remembered that even closely related natural phenomena are not linked together in a real sequence or continuous series, but that they are produced by overlapping activities [of nature], so that in a sense it does not matter which phenomenon is considered first and which last, because the only important thing is to have them all present in one's mind (as much as this is possible), so that they can at last be gathered</page><page sequence="11">Heinrich Henel 661 together from a single point of view, partly according to their nature and partly in human ways and according to human convenience."11 The essence of Goethe's second explanation is that his insights were gained by intuitions, and that the intuitions were occasioned by objects of symbolical significance. This explanation differs from the first in two vital respects: it admits the primary and active role of the mind, and it dismisses the notion that the phenomena are conveniently arranged in a hierarchy or pyramid at whose apex the investigator may behold truth incarnate. For now it is a single phenomenon or a single experience which leads to the general principle; and insight is not a revelation received passively, but is achieved by an act of the mind. Whereas Goethe's first explanation asserts that the phenomena, as it were, carry their own ex? planation with them and that his theories are simply empirical experience translated into words, the second explanation admits that knowledge is gained through an interplay of observation and thought. Indeed Goethe goes even farther and asserts that intuitions are not possible unless a person has potential knowledge in anticipation of actual experience. He ascribes to persons gifted for creative work in the arts or sciences a kind of inborn knowledge which he calls variously "an original feeling for the truth," "anticipation," and "presentiment," and he says that all real dis- coveries and all really new ideas are due to this gift.12 Making a discovery or forming an idea is a release or actualizing of potential knowledge which takes place with lightning speed when the right object or phenomenon is encountered. Every investigator makes only those discoveries which cor- respond to his anticipatory knowledge, for "what, after all, is invention? It is the end of searching" (MR, No. 1167). Finally, Goethe declares 11 To disabuse unsuspecting readers of the notion that they may safely read Goethe in translation, I will quote the German text followed by Eastlake's translation: "Was ferner die Ordnung der Kapitel uberhaupt betrifft, so mag man bedenken, dafi selbst verwandte Naturphanomene in keiner eigentlichen Folge oder stetigen Reihe sich aneinanderschlieften, sondern dafl sie durch Tatigkeiten hervorgebracht werden, welche verschrankt wirken, so dafi es gewissermaflen gleichgiiltig ist, was fiir eine Erscheinung man zuerst und was fiir eine man zuletzt betrachtet, weil es doch nur darauf ankommt, dafi man sich alle moglichst vergegenwartige, um sie zuletzt unter einem Gesichtspunkt, teils nach ihrer Natur, teils nach Menschenweise und Bequemlichkeit, zusammenzufassen."?"With respect to the order of the chapters, it should be remembered that natural phenomena, which are even allied to each other, are not connected in any particular sequence or constant series; their efficient causes act in a narrow circle, so that it is in some sort indifferent what phenomenon is first or last considered; the main point is, that all should be as far as possible present to us, in order that we may embrace them at last from one point of view, partly according to their nature, partly according to generally received methods" (Goethe7s Theory of Colours, tr. Charles L. Eastlake, London, 1840, pp. 151 f.). 12 Henel, "Goethe und die Naturwissenschaft," pp. 514 f.; "Der junge Goethe," Monats- hefte,XLi (1949), 155-157.</page><page sequence="12">662 Goethe's Science that such syntheses of mind and experience are possible only because of the preordained harmony between nature and man. This harmony even reaches down to a correspondence between certain phenomena and spe? cific sensory organs. The eye, for example, was created by light for the per- ception of light.13 And just as the eye is sunlike, so man is godlike: he re- ceives the most blissful assurance of the great cosmic harmony when in- tuitions are granted to him. The following quotation, already para- phrased, is best left in the original language: Alles, was wir Erfinden, Entdecken im hoheren Sinne nennen, ist die bedeutende Ausiibung, Betatigung eines originalen Wahrheitsgefuhles, das, im stillen langst ausgebildet, unversehens, mit Blitzesschnelle zu einer fruchtbaren Erkenntnis fiihrt. Es ist eine aus dem Innern am AuCern sich entwickelnde Offenbarung, die den Menschen seine Gottahnlichkeit vorahnen lafit. Es ist eine Synthese von Welt und Geist, welche von der ewigen Harmonie des Daseins die seligste Versicherung gibt. (MR, No. 1164) The role which intuitions played in the formation of Goethe's theories is amply documented by his biographical writings. The idea of the metamorphosis of plants was, if not conceived, at any rate firmly grasped and made into a permanent conviction when Goethe saw a palm tree at Padua (sample leaves of which he preserved and "venerated like fetishes") and when, the following spring, he studied the plants in the botanical gardens at Palermo. A sheep's skull he found at Venice in 1790 convinced him that all the bones in the skulls of mammals are meta- morphosed vertebrae. And his explanation of the origin of colors came to him the first time he looked through a prism: "After a moment's thought I realized that a border [between light and darkness] is needed to produce colors, and as by instinct I said out aloud at once that New- ton's theory was false."14 Goethe's accounts of these occasions emphasize not only the suddenness of his insights, but also that they sprang from the contemplation of specific objects. His pithiest statement of the theory of knowledge here implied runs as follows: "What is the universal? The spe? cific case. What is the particular? Millions of cases" (MR, No. 994). Or, to quote a less cryptic statement: "Truth, identical with the divine, can never be known by us directly: we perceive it only in its reflection, in an example, a symbol, in single and related phenomena."15 If I understand 18 Einleitung, Farbenlehre, ed.

Whereas of a multitude of cases no two are quite alike, so that their common principle can be grasped only by a process of abstraction, a single case can give rise to an intuition and thus acquire symbolical significance. In view of what has been said it may be possible to redefine, and thus to rehabilitate, Goethe's concept of proto-phenomena. A proto-phenome- non, we may say, is a simple phenomenon which explained to Goethe a large range of related, more complicated phenomena. Its importance is purely biographical. The term is a title of honor or a distinction which Goethe conferred on those phenomena which occasioned his intuitions and thus yielded him significant insights into nature. When Goethe says that a proto-phenomenon can be "found" (Theory of Colors, ?177), we must not take him literally. What he found was not different from other phenomena; it became different because of what he saw in it. He redis- covered in nature what had already existed in his mind: potential knowl? edge became actual knowledge. E. L. Stahl, in his excellent paper on The Genesis of Symbolist Theories in Germany (p. 311 f.), quotes a most instructive passage from Goethe's letter to Schiller of 16 August 1797. In this letter, Goethe declares that the Roftmarkt (an ancient market square in Frankfurt) and his grand- father's house are "symbols of many thousand similar cases, in this trad? ing city, especially for me" (my italics). And he defines symbols as "emi- nent cases . . . which represent many others, include a certain totality, demand a certain sequence, stir up in my mind related and remote mat- ters, and thus lay claim to a certain unity and universality both from without and from within." The definition is sufficiently close to what Goethe says about proto-phenomena to permit identification of the two terms: a proto-phenomenon is really a symbol.16 And if we ask why Goethe needed symbols in his study of nature, the letter answers that question also, for Goethe confesses that, rather than struggle, as he used to do, with the million-headed hydra of empirical reality, he would re? turn home, not look around in the world any more, and create imagina- tively, producing phantoms from his innermost being. Thus, just like the type, the proto-phenomenon is a means of simplifying the study of na? ture.16* It relieves the investigator of the need to go on forever collecting data, for truth can be perceived in symbolic phenomena, which, once 18 Vietor (pp. 396, 545) and Miiller (pp. Ixvi-lxviii) came to the same conclusion. "? See above, p. 655, n. 6.</page><page sequence="14">664 Goetheys Science found, will explain all similar phenomena, whether known or yet to be dis- covered.17 It might be objected that Goethe's letter deals with his problems as an author and that it is impermissible to apply statements about his literary work to his activities as a student of nature. However, Goethe himself would hardly have made such a distinction. He was fully aware (although he denied this when he argued with the Newtonians) that he was primarily a poet and that he could not shed his nature when he turned to scientific pursuits.18 He knew, too, that "the phenomenon is not separated from the observer; rather it is involved in, and intertwisted with, his individuality" (MR, No. 1020). Thus he could say of his journal Zur Morphologie that it was intended to explain "how I study nature, but at the same time, in a way, to reveal my inward self, my mode of being."19 17 There is, to be sure, an alternative to the modest and, if one will, skeptical interpreta? tion of the term proto-phenomenon which we have proposed. This alternative?it is the only one open to those unwilling simply to repeat the term in pious wonder?is to say that "Urphanomen" in the Theory of Colors means the basic opposition between light and darkness itself. A number of distinguished scholars, Karl Vietor among them, have in fact adopted this alternative, but if their interpretation saves Goethe's concept, it accuses him, implicitly at least, of an extraordinarily loose use of the language. For even if light and darkness might conceivably be thought of as phenomena, their opposition is not a phenomenon, because it cannot be observed. Moreover, those who took this view realized quite clearly that it makes the terms proto-phenomenon and type mean virtually the same thing. They declared that the proto-phenomenon has the same function in Goethe's physics that the type has in his biology. Now the type is not a phenomenon; it is an idea. Only during the earliest stages of his biological studies did Goethe search for an actual "Urpflanze," a primal plant or proto-plant. Not a trace is left of the "Urpflanze" concept in The Metamorphosis of Plants of 1790, and if he did cherish a lingering hope of finding the proto-plant in an actual botanical specimen, he was finally disabused of this hope by Schiller in their famous conversation of 20 July 1794. The proto-phenomenon, on the other hand, is definitely a phenomenon and not an idea. This is not only implied by the term which Goethe coined, but it is also confirmed by the definitions of it which he gave. Goethe's argument in the Theory of Colors is as clear as it is novel and challenging: he asserts that the phenomena carry their owrn explanations with them, and that the explanations can be found in phenomena of a special kind?the proto-phenomena. This argument becomes meaningless if we assume that Goethe said "phenomenon" but meant "idea," because there would be nothing new in the assertion that the observation of phenomena can give rise to ideas. It is preferable, I think, to believe that Goethe was mistaken than to believe that he uttered platitudes. 18 See my "Goethe und die Naturwissenschaft," p. 508, n. 2. 19 Bedeutende Fordernis (1823), JA, xxxrx, 48. Significantly, Goethe says in this pas? sage that his earlier essay, "Der Versuch als Vermittler," is a particularly clear revelation both of himself and of his methods in the study of nature (see p. 659, above). Goethe also reversed the idea: just as a man's character is revealed through his attitude toward nature, so he discovers who he is through observation of the world outside. Discovery Goethe defines as "becoming aware of one's inward self on the occasion of an external phenom? enon," and he adds: "Man gains certainty of his own nature through recognizing that the nature outside is like him, is governed by laws" (JA, xxxix, 38; cf. JA, xxxix, 49).</page><page sequence="15">Heinrich Henel 665 And he wrote: "My whole inward working proved to be a heuristic proc- ess, which, recognizing a yet unknown, but conjectured law, attempts to find the same in the external world, and to introduce it there."20 What strikes us most in this sentence is that "to find" and "to introduce" are used as interchangeable terms. This makes sense only if Goethe's theory of anticipatory knowledge is accepted. And if the phenomena are in- volved in the individuality of the observer, then surely the proto-phe? nomena are even more deeply involved in it: the character and approach of the investigator determine what proto-phenomena he will find. A more serious objection can be made to my distinction between the two ways in which Goethe explained his methods of gaining knowledge. He himself made no such distinction, nor am I able to say that the second explanation superseded the first in his writings. Nevertheless I believe the distinction is useful. Goethe made a great many statements about his methods and their epistemological foundations, but, as Gunther Miil? ler observed very wisely, they were rarely meant as final pronouncements. Most of them were made with a specific situation in mind?they were monologues continuing the conversation with friends or opponents. In his studies of nature, Goethe found himself in a position where he had to fight the pure empiricists on the one hand and the pure theorists, the mathematical physicists, on the other. When he argued against the former, he insisted that observation and thought are inseparable and that perception itself is a form of theorizing; but when he argued against the latter he stressed the importance of the phenomena and cautioned against the substitution of intellectual concepts for observable facts. His position was solid when he asserted that nature cannot be understood by merely cataloguing empirical data; it was much less solid when he at- tacked the abstractions of mathematical physics as mere chimeras. Hence his uncertainty, and hence his failure to notice the inconsistency of the two kinds of explanation which I have distinguished. The second explanation represents his true opinion; the first was produced by the exigencies of controversy. Let me summarize. Goethe declared repeatedly that he was not a born observer and that there was a conflict between his character and em? pirical experience.21 It was only at the age of thirty that he trained him? self to observe closely and that he became a systematic student of na- 20 MR, No. 486. The translation is R. D. Gray's (p. 96). 21 In the letter to Schiller already mentioned (p. 663, above), Goethe speaks of "the conflict. . . between my nature and immediate experience, wrhich in former times I was never able to resolve." And in Naturwissenschaftlicher Entwicklungsgang (1821) he admits that he "very soon turned against visible nature," that he was not born with a sharp sense of sight, and that this gave him (the poet's) ability to see the gracefulness of things (JA, xxxix, 46).</page><page sequence="16">666 Goethe7s Science ture. On the other hand, he had been interested in natural phenomena since childhood and had given them much thought. Thus he had formed ideas about nature long before he began to study it in earnest, and it is not surprising to find that these ideas determined the goals of his later work.22 Those who have difficulty in accepting Goethe's theory of antici- patory knowledge may, therefore, say that the principles which he redis- covered in nature were really ideas going back to his formative years. At any rate, whatever their origin, Goethe felt the need of confirming his ideas by a most painstaking study of nature, but at the same time the results of his studies were in large measure predetermined by his general beliefs. He was an ardent student of nature, but not a scientist; and he was a profound thinker, but not a philosopher. That is to say, his im- mense interest in physical reality did not prevent him on occasion from neglecting, or doing violence to, facts which did not fit into his general frame of ideas (a failing which was noted even by such early and devoted followers as Eckermann and Schopenhauer);23 while, on the other hand, he was not content with building a philosophical system which is valid because of its inner coherence and logical consistency. He spoke of a new kind of science which would be both methodical and mystical (MR, No. 896), and it is this dual or ambiguous position which has challenged (as well as embarrassed) innumerable interpreters, and which has defied a fully satisfactory analysis. Goethe called his new science also "ideell," i.e., governed by ideas, and perhaps this description is the most helpful, because it connects his stud? ies of nature with his creative work in literature. According to his own testimony, it was his purpose as an author "to give poetic form to reality" rather than "to realize the so-called poetic, the merely fanciful."24 A simi? lar purpose can be discovered in his studies of nature. He rejected the nature philosophy of the romanticists because it seemed merely a product of the mind and not based on observation. On the other hand, he rejected mathematical physics because it seemed to shatter the phenomena per- ceived by the senses, and to be incapable of piecing the fragments to- gether again and thus of producing a comprehensive view of nature. By contrast, Goethe kept intact the pictorial quality of the world around us and attempted to "see" the meaning of the pictures which nature pre? sents to the observer. Or, to change the metaphor, one might say that he 22 One such strain of early ideas was examined recently in R. D. Gray's book, Goethe the Alchemist. 23 J. P. Eckermann, Gesprache mit Goethe, 19 Feb. 1829, ed. Eduard Castle, i, 259 f. and n, 164. Goethe on his part reacted sharply against the heresies of his pupils. At least one of his poems on color theory is directed against Schopenhauer.

He himself described the process as "gegenstand- liches Denken" or "anschauliches Denken" (objective thinking or intui- tive thinking), and he insisted that it had served him equally well in his literary production and in his studies of nature.26 What he meant was that his thinking was stimulated by gazing upon specific objects and that the elements or units with which his mind operated were images and not abstractions. His imagination, being that of a poet, seized upon the phenomena and saw in them the manifestations of ideas which were also powers and almost like persons. Nature itself was to Goethe a living force, not dead matter controlled by laws which can be statistically established. This hylozoistic view of nature26 made it impossible for him to accept the materialism of science or to be satisfied with its explana? tions in terms of cause and effect. Like Schopenhauer, he distinguished between the elementary forces ("Urkrafte") which produce the physical phenomena, and the causes (Goethe called them merely conditions) which determine the manner in which these forces act on specific occa- sions. Therefore to understand the causes or conditions of the phenomena was not yet to understand their origin. It was merely a preparatory step which showed that the confusing variety of empirical phenomena was due only to varying accidental conditions. The greater task was to see that they were all produced by a few constant "Urkrafte." The colors, for example, Goethe described as products of the actions and sufferings of light. There is a "refined anthropomorphism"27 in Goethe's conception of nature, and his theory of colors, taken as a whole, might be called a modern mythology. It is a mythology because it resembles the myths of the ancients in hypostasizing certain phenomena like magnetism and light, and in explaining the physical universe as resulting from their co- operation, conflict, sublimation, and reunion on a higher level; but it is a modern mythology because it builds on, indeed contributes to, the body of fact collected by observational science, and because it is anthropo- morphic only on the highest level of theoretical explanation.28 Whereas the ancients identified every fountain, rock, and tree with a "local god" (Hermann Usener's phrase) and thus explained nature by creating a fanciful world of nymphs, oreads, and dryads, Goethe summarized (or better, integrated) the phenomena of everyday experience in images which are only faintly anthropomorphic. He offered a genuine theory, 25 Bedeutende Fordemis (JA, xxxrx, 48 f.). 26 Gxinther Miiller, Introd. to MR, pp. lxiv f. 27 Ernst Cassirer, p. 58. 28 Cf. MR, No. 895: "In the sciences it is most meritorious to return to the insufficient truths which the ancients possessed, and to improve upon them."</page><page sequence="18">668 Goethe's Science but since he was dealing with the pictorial world perceived by the eye, his universals, too, could not be abstracts but had to be visualized ideas ?the proto-phenomena. Goethe set himself a gigantic task: he attempted to rival science both as an observer and as a theorist. His theories were meant to explain the world around us in human terms and thus to reestablish the ancient be? lief in the psycho-physical unity of existence, in what former ages called the correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm. And his observa- tions, which he made in the conviction that "man himself . . . is the greatest and most accurate physical apparatus" (MR, No. 1265), were meant to support these theories. Thus, although he gave an immense amount of time and care to observation, it would be wrong to conclude that for Goethe the purpose of observation was the same as for the scientist. He observed as an artist observes, not to collect data for gen- eralized conclusions, but to acquire a personal skill or mastery. Observa? tion for Goethe was a means of training the observer, an exercise in the acquisition of intuitive assurance, a preparation for the ultimate task of perceiving types and proto-phenomena. Just as an artist might study hundreds of roses so that when the time came he could paint the rose (which is both a reproduction of the specific model before him and an image of what all roses are), so Goethe studied individual objects and phenomena so as to learn how to perceive types and proto-phenomena.
