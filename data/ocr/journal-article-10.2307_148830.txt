<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOPROSY FILOSOFII VOPROSY FILOSOFII (PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY), 3 (1948) THE journal Voprosy Filosofii was instituted after Zhdanov's speech to the philosophers in June x947 (see Soviet Studies, I, pp. 4off), as the principal philosophical journal published in the Russian language. It is issued by the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences, and its first editor was Professor B. M. Kedrov. The new stage in philosophy saw a further development between the publication of the second and third issues of Voprosy Filosofii for i948 (there are three issues a year); the Party applied the principles' on which it was insisting in various intellectual fields (including education and the arts) to the philosophic treatment of certain questions then being discussed in Voprosy Filosofii (see Soviet Studies, I, pp. 84ff and 2, pp. I8off). Just as the major inter- vention by the Party took the form of Zhdanov's attack on Alexandrov in 1947, so the further intervention within the new stage took the form of attacks on the writings and editorial policy of Kedrov and his associates in 1948. The consequent reorganization delayed publication of the third 1948 issue of Voprosy Filosofii until the middle of I949, when it appeared under the editorship of D. I. Chesnokov, who was not formerly on the editorial board. Professor Kedrov remains on the board, together with six of its former members, while four of their previous colleagues have been replaced by three new members, including Professor Mitin and the new editor. Thus the new issue of Voprosy Filosofii represents a new precision of function which is defined at length in the editorial. This editorial is summarized below together with contributions constituting about one- third of the total of 366 pages. The topics covered in the issue comprise 1 Three stages are discernible in Soviet post-war intellectual development. First, in 1946, Party statements are made on specialized activities which are immediately avail- able for popular consumption (literature, films and theatre repertoires). Second, in 1947 and 1948, the experience of this popular development is first generalized in the philosophical discussion, and also applied to music; it is then (in the summer of 1948) extended from the purely formulatory fields and brought down to earth in the biology discussion. Third, in I949, the extinction of scales of values not wholly derived from Soviet experience and requirements is ruthlessly completed. The immediate occasion for this last development was the removal from public life of a leading group of dramatic critics, who claimed a specialist independence of social conventions and values as defined by the Party. (See SIMONOV in Soviet Studies, 2 pp. I84-5). As is customary when the Party takes steps of this importance, the implications for their own work were discussed by other professions, including the philosophers: the attack on Kedrov and his associates was a consequence. The principles at issue in this third stage were (i) that principles and concepts derived from other cultures and unrelated to Soviet experience and requirements should not be used; (2) that principles and concepts derived from past historical experience and no longer applicable to the present stage of Soviet society should not be used; (3) that principles and concepts arising from the present stage of Soviet society should be formulated; (4) it is the function of each profession to be the agent of the Party in furthering, within its own specialist competence, the progress of Soviet society in the direction defined by the Party. 210</page><page sequence="2">(PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY) a very wide range of subjects, which may be grouped (apart from the editorial) as follows: I.

The papers on natural philosophy are part of a much wider discussion, and will not be considered in this review. In the following summaries of the material selected, the argument is reproduced without any attempt to repeat such current Soviet conven- tions of style and manner as are not essential to the thought. It is hoped by this means to reveal the thought itself more clearly than could other- wise be done. The passages below in square brackets and the footnotes contain our explanations and comments; otherwise the text is more or less condensed summary of the Russian material. THE EDITORIAL2 The struggle against the remnants of capitalism in the consciousness of people is a prerequisite of further socialist advance. Particular groups of professional people, such as biologists, physicists, philosophers, writers and artists, are prone to objectivism and muddle-headedness, which arise when they are out of touch with the people, and to cosmopol- itanism, which is a lordly and careless attitude to the people inherited from the Tsarist intelligentsia and ruling classes, who even ceased to speak Russian, fawned on the bourgeois culture of the West, believed in the eternal backwardness of Russia and ignored non-Russian cultures within the Tsarist empire. All the best minds of pre-revolutionary Russia struggled against this, but our enemies try to use it, to push our least stable citizens to treachery and betrayal. Cosmopolitanism, with its nonsense about 'archaic' national boundaries and sovereignty, intellectually disarms those on the alert against imperialism; its nonsense about the universality of culture blurs the differences between capitalism and socialism. The anti-patriots are dangerous not in number but because they aid the infiltration of the capitalist way of thought, and 2 Among the points essential to a correct reading of this editorial, the following are perhaps the most important: I. The only capitalist survivals in the U.S.S.R. are now held to be in the realm of ideas: there is no survival of capitalism in life, but only 'in the consciousness of people'. 2. Objectivism is a systematic refusal to evaluate facts, and must not be confused with objectivity, which is the capacity to face facts. (Accept- ance of the Marxist theory of process implies that every known event illuminates or is illuminated by that theory, and 'objectivism' is a refusal to see or state the relation- ship between the event and the process.) Other terms are explained by their context. VOPROSY FILOSOFII 212</page><page sequence="4">(PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY) because they are rooted in the remnants of capitalism in the conscious- ness of people. The fight is not finished when we uncover the carriers of cosmopolitanism: we must be critical in every way of cosmopolitan views, we must reveal their anti-scientific and anti-popular character and arm our own intellectual workers with Marxism. Philosophers have a particular responsibility, and must set their own house in order. Kedrov's work in effect asserted that the class analysis of historical problems excluded the national view; he replaced the history of philosophy according to national cultures by a study according to general historical stages, which led to national nihilism and to cosmo- politanism. Russian materialist philosophy was the highest development of pre- Marxist materialism,3 and no other country was so well prepared for Marxism. The Russian tradition was critically reworked and absorbed by Leninism. Of course, Russian philosophy was associated with western philosophy; Lenin was not purely Russian; but it is not parochialism to explore the native inheritance of Lenin. The achievements of the Russians are measured by the revolution, the defeat of Hitler and the making of the Communist Party, which is such that the Central Committee of the Party is not only the political but also the theoretical centre of the country. In the present develop- ment of Leninism, the Party acts as protector to its growth, while the anti-patriots claim the right to make mistakes. This is as unprincipled as objectivism, and the antidote is loyalty to principle (partiinost).4 Even after the discussion in 1947, Kedrov's work was objectivist; it ignored the struggles of classes and social groups, and the conflict between socialism and capitalism. His 'pure' world science is borrowed from the bourgeois view of the world. So too, Alexandrov's article in Voprosy Filosofii, I (1948) contains an apathetic, academic, treatment of the historical conditions of the rise of Marxism. Loyalty to principle (partiinost) in philosophy is the unity of theory and practice, of philosophy and politics, integrally connected with the practical struggle to construct communism; it is service by every word of our Soviet people and our motherland. The genius of Lenin and Stalin lies in their defence of materialism 3 Pre-Marxist materialism here means Russian materialist philosophy before Plekhanov, who introduced Marxism into Russia in the I88os. 4 Partiinost: of course, in the sense of 'loyalty to our principles'. The translation of this, and a number of similar terms, requires considerable study of usage of the words in their contexts, for the meanings develop as quickly as the society using the words. We have already noted Lenin's definition (Soviet Studies, I, p. 45, note 8) 'materialism carries with it, so to speak, partiinost, compelling one, in any evaluation of events, to take up directly and openly the viewpoint of a definite social group'. And we have remarked (ibid., p. 90, note 8) that a transition was discernible from a (working) class to a (socialist) society as the 'definite social group'. The present editorial is characteristic in demanding that specialist intellectual work regard the transition as complete. 2a3</page><page sequence="5">and development of its Marxist form. The importance of such a struggle increases with each step of social development. It was because of the imperfect development of criticism and self-criticism that there was such delay in uncovering Kedrov's serious errors, and an impermissible delay in uncovering the cosmopolitan views of Kamensky, Krivelov and other staff members of the Institute; it was for this reason that Beletsky, and others, in the Department of Dialectical Materialism in Moscow University, were allowed to propagate stupid vulgarisms, and that they overlooked the subversive activity of that enemy of the people, the cosmopolitan Goldentricht. However, the recent developments in principled criticism and self-criticism serve as a basis for serious successes in philosophy. Voprosy Filosofii has a most important part to play in the work. But it has permitted some crude errors. It published the anti-patriotic article of Kamensky [on Russian materialist philosophy of the eighteenth and nine- teenth centuries] which raised questions not proper for discussion, revised the Marxist-Leninist approach to the history of Russian social thought, and was suffused with the spirit of jingo internationalism. The journal also was objectivist in the biology dispute, and published an article by Krivelov, who attempted to reconcile materialism and idealism by looking for a 'rational kernel' in Weismannism; while another article by Schmalhausen, in spite of its scientific phraseology, was a defence of autogenesis. Markov's article on physics contained Kantian and Machist propositions. Kedrov's article on Lenin's Philosophical Note- books ascribed a Hegelian idealism to Lenin; and his Critical Observa- tions diverted attention from the struggle against cosmopolitanism and violated the Leninist principle of partiinost by concentrating on matters of isolated fact without regard to the socio-political basis of struggle. These articles were published because the other members of the editorial board did not draw the necessary conclusions from Zhdanov's statements on partiinost in philosophy. The journal tried to correct its first, crude, errors: there were articles against Weismannism in the last issue, the editors recognized the gross error of publishing Schmal- hausen's article, as well as Kamensky's, but their comments themselves commit the sin of abstractness, and minimize Kedrov's mistakes. Stalin's Dialectical and Historical Materialism was a development of classical Marxism, and philosophers have disseminated his ideas. But the further elaboration of method has hardly begun, and the philosophers are still in debt to the Party and people. New problems mean new work, and the distinctions and categories of dialectics do not appear in the same ways in living nature as they do in inorganic nature. The philosopher can no longer escape with general formulae that do not disclose specific peculiarities of the action of these laws in actual natural phenomena, VOPROS Y FILOSOFII 214</page><page sequence="6">(PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY) The elaboration of the dialectics of nature at the current level of natural science is a much more pointed question than it was to Marx and Engels 75 years ago. A consistent and militant defence of materialism is needed, especially in physics.5 Philosophers working in historical materialism and the social sciences do not study the post-war capitalist developments and the experience of the people's democracies, or criticize right-wing socialism and bourgeois thought in all its manifestations. The philosopher's duty is the provision of intellectual armament against the survivals of capitalism in the consciousness of people, and the working out of theoretical problems in Soviet patriotism; it is his duty to make known to the people the great cultural inheritance of the Russians and other peoples of the U.S.S.R., to assist the workers in literature and art to work out Marxist aesthetics on a Leninist basis, and to collaborate so that patriotism permeates all intellectual work. The editorial board is quite clear that one guarantee of success lies in co-operation with philosophers outside the capital, and with specialists in other fields outside philosophy. AESTHETICS [The new draft curriculum entitled 'Principles of Marxist-Leninist Aesthetics', drawn up by V. P. Berestnev and P. S. Trofimov, was published in Voprosy Filosofii, 2 (I948), and discussion invited. In Voprosy Filosofii, 3, it is reported that the curriculum has been discussed at meetings iN the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy, at courses for teachers of aesthetics organized by the Arts Committee of the Govern- ment, at Moscow University, Moscow Arts Institute, Moscow Con- servatory, the Institute of Dramatic Art, the Architectural Institute, etc. At the meeting in the Institute of Philosophy there took part the staff of the institute and teachers of aesthetics in Moscow, Sverdlovsk, Kharkov, Odessa, Riga, etc., and letters were read from absent contributors to the discussion. The place of honour in the report of the discussion at the Institute of Philosophy is given to the contribution by Nedoshivin, a lecturer at Moscow University and at the Academy of Social Sciences of the Central Committee of the C.P. His argument may be summarized as follows:] Since the organization of a discussion of this type on aesthetics was a 5 This would appear to be a development of Zhdanov's insistence that Marxism is not a complete - and therefore dead - system of results, but an instrument of creative inquiry. One of the functions of Soviet philosophy is to generalize from the results and methods of the sciences and thus to assist their further progress; their immense development since Marx and Engels has not been accompanied by a commensurate development of Marxist philosophy. 2I5</page><page sequence="7">new venture, certain mistakes should be noted, and avoided in future: e.g. the subject of the discussion should have been plainly stated as the concept of art as a special form of the reflection of objective reality in the consciousness of social man. That is, the discussion should start from the relations of art to actuality. In the curriculum itself, Marxist-Leninist teaching on realism does not appear as such. The problems of the history of art should be so handled as to disclose that the process of the development of art is the process of the formation and development of realist art in a struggle against anti-realist tendencies. This is a very complex problem since the greatest realists in art have used non-realist elements. But a really great artist must reflect in his work some, even if only a few, of the essential sides of life. The historical variety of forms of realism in the past (e.g. critical realism) must be treated. The curriculum contains no genuine critique of vulgar sociology, which, indeed, pervades it. There is now no student of art who relates changes in art to changes in import and export statistics, and a critique of such nonsense is a waste of breath; the sin of vulgar sociology is some- thing quite different, namely, to suppose that art is not a form of the reflection of actuality, a definable, socially explicable reflection of real life, but only an 'expression' of a frame of mind supposed to be charac- teristic of a given class or epoch. Thus vulgar sociology is not interested in the objective content of art, but only in its subjective form: that is why the 'social background' and artistic analysis always fit so neatly in vulgar sociology, which moves according to all the rules of formalism. As a result, historical and artistic analyses remain at different levels, and vulgar sociology perverts the history of art, because it fails to evaluate the objectivity of cognition of reality in a work of art, and is incapable of discovering the gradual development of realism which is the basic content of the historico-artistic process. In connection with the partiinost of art there are a number of problems. Progressive art is interested in the true image of reality and so moves towards realism. Reactionary artistic thought, however, is much con- cerned to mask its social position and to be independent of society. So there is the problem of the artistic ideal: the formulated artistic ideal has real historical bases which can be discovered, however fantastic the form. In the past, the ideal had to be imagined separately from the real. There is the problem of the relation of beauty in nature to beauty in art, and the problem of the relation between beauty and truth - the contradiction here is to be overcome in socialist realism, which in the true shows what is most beautiful in socialist reality. The difference between formalism and realism is not a choice between form and content, but realist art considers form as the true reflection of actual phenomena, while the 2I6 VOPROSY FILOSOFII</page><page sequence="8">(PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY) 217 formalist sees in art the expression of 'pure forms of thought'. For the formalist, colour, composition, drawing, are abstract forms of artistic thinking; for the realist, they are the imaging of the objectively existing properties of nature. The curriculum does not include the problem of realist form, so that no help is given in expelling the remains of formalism in Soviet art. 'Revolutionary romanticism' is an unhappy term, for socialist realism is not the mechanical sum of realism and romanticism. Better to say that revolutionary vision is the ability to see in the truth of today the creation of a real tomorrow. It cannot be distinguished from socialist realism, which has three basic principles: realism, partiinost, educative signific- ance. Soviet art respects the people, and though this quality of art in previous historical epochs is important, the relation of leading artists to the main current of ideas in their times is not shown in the curriculum. But in fact this relation aided the development of the people by stating the problems of the life of the nation. There should also be a critique of the spiritual expropriation of the people by capitalism. Aesthetic criticism should be a method of overcoming contradictions and imperfections in the development of our art, and the materialist tradition in aesthetic criticism should be brought out in the course.6 6 In spite of some fairly obvious errors of argumentation in Nedoshivin's thought, his contribution is the only one published which shows evidence of systematic attention to the subject, and subsequent discussion is likely to centre in his points. It is remark- able that he lays down, as a historical generalization, that the total historico-artistic process has been the struggle towards realism, and yet mentions, as evidence for this, only nineteenth-century critical realism and current socialist realism. In spite of the meagre evidence adduced, the thought here is important as being an attempt to apply to the history of art the assumption that a historical development of artistic concepts and forms must be traceable, and related to the historical stages of human experience and consciousness. (It may be noted in passing that some comments by Marx, from the introduction to his Critique of Political Economy, which indicate the contrary are quoted in the same issue of Voprosy Filosofii, p. 28). Nedoshivin is attempting an extension of historical materialist theory in his own field. His attempt is confused by the selection of a particular aspect of current Soviet aesthetic ideology as the historical artistic norm, and this is retrospectively imposed on the history of art, with the result that Nedoshiv- in's argument ignores a very substantial difficulty, namely, that popular and industrial art from neolithic times onwards has been very largely non-realist, and - which is only a particular instance of this - the political examples of Soviet visual art such as por- traits of Stalin show similar stereotypic tendencies. Thus in effect Nedoshivin con- centrates on the 'great artist' and ignores the majority of artistic creations made as an element in the production processes for use by other producers, and not by a specialist for contemplation by non-specialists. The form in which his proposition is cast therefore disguises its importance, and makes it incompetent to handle such problems of the history of art as the origins and motives of non-representationa 1 Moslem art and the iconoclastic phase in the Byzantine empire - movements which gave rise to theological aesthetic theories of some importance in tracing the development of human conscious- ness. Nedoshivin's argument is therefore of particular sociological interest as demonstrating the tenacity of specialist assumptions and modes of thought in the Soviet Union even after the intellectual revisions of the past few years. These assumptions have caused an obviously serious and responsible worker to ignore the evidence plain to his eyes in his household equipment and political art, and fail to explore the social realities not only of the formation but of the communica-</page><page sequence="9">VOPROSY FILOSOFII PSYCHOLOGY [The two articles on psychology in the current issue of Voprosy Filosofii take the form of a review of a Russian book, and a critique of some aspects of American psychology. The review is not at all concerned with non-Russian work, and is consequently more self-contained and informative about the current principles in use in Soviet work in this field. It is therefore summarized first, so that the kind of assumptions used in the critique are made familiar to the reader before he proceeds to a study of the critique itself. Both the review and the critique, being written for Russian readers, assume a familiarity with the Marxist-Leninist view of consciousness, which may perhaps be briefly summarized as follows: consciousness is an attribute of humanity, but not unchanging in quality: it has a history just as all other human qualities have a history. The individual derives his consciousness from his own way of life, and his society's way of life; and the social way of life, generally speaking, sets its own limits to the development of consciousness in the individual. Thus the general level of individual consciousness in any society ancient or modern corresponds to, and reflects, the general characteristics of the society, including its own total historical experience, such historical experience as it has inherited from previous societies, and the degree of its own awareness of the need to overtake or retard its own practical developments. Thus each general stage of human organization possesses a corresponding general level of consciousness, and each general mode of thought (totemic, animistic, cosmic-anthropomorphic, etc.) is the highest form of consciousness attainable under the given historical conditions. There is a Soviet assumption (possibly inherent in this view, though it does not seem to have been stated as a formal corollary) that the general development of consciousness and modes of thought tends on the whole to lag behind the general development of the life of society; that except- ional pertinacity and devotion to principles of method will enable individuals to think one or two steps ahead of the general experience of their society, and to anticipate its needs and requirements. Moreover, at those periods of history where two general stages of human organization and experience coexist and communicate, the contrast in practical life will be matched by a conflict in the realm of ideas, so that individuals at both levels of consciousness, and confused between the two, will be tion of stages of human consciousness through stereotypes and other non-realist elements. The visual stereotypes of a social group form one of its most obvious charac- teristics, and the struggle against the formation of specialist coterie stereotypes ('formalism'), inaccessible to immediate non-specialist apprehension, has been an important aspect of Soviet socio-aesthetic development. Further discussion on Nedo- shivin's concept of 'realist form' is likely to bring out some of the difficulties in the present cast of his thesis. 2I8</page><page sequence="10">(PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY) 219 found in both societies. Consequently - it is further assumed - those members of the less primitive society who do not themselves possess an exceptional capacity for the new intellectual disciplines in which the higher level of consciousness is contained, may be aided and fortified by calling upon their moral reserves of loyalty to and respect for their own people who have collectively achieved the higher social stage in practice. This view of consciousness, and these assumptions, are supposed by Chernakov and Yaroshevsky to be generally accepted by the readers of their articles.] (i) Chernakov's review of the second edition of S. L. Rubinstein's Theory of General Psychology The influence of recent Soviet developments in biology is now begin- ing to be felt in psychology. The materialist basis of our psychological studies comprises the propositions that the psychic is produced by the physical; the material world is represented in the psychic, which is not itself material. The psychologist is a dialectical materialist only if he does not restrict himself to thinking of the psyche as a product or function of the brain, but unreservedly regards the psyche as a reflection of the external world.7 Unless he does this, he is indistinguishable from a vulgar materialist or an idealist, and will find himself in the company of Freud, the heir of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. No Soviet psychologist would deny these propositions; but they are not always used consistently. Rubinstein holds them to be true only for one kind of psychic process, and admits the existence of another, sub- jective, kind, based on internal processes. Consequently he com- promises with various idealist notions and follows Schmalhausen's theories of inheritance. In fact, Rubinstein does not study Soviet man living in socio-economic conditions differing in kind from those else- where; but his subject is the man of capitalist society and the abstract universal personality beloved of all bourgeois psychologists. He distin- guishes between consciousness in its psychological sense, and conscious- ness in its social and ideological sense8 and so does not recognize the 7 This proposition follows from the social origin of consciousness in the Marxist- Leninist definition. The individual brain is regarded as the instrument which trans- lates the external world into representations, and consequently it is not admissible, on this hypothesis, to suppose that the brain itself can create a representation out of nothing independent of the action of the external world. It must of course be borne in mind that the relation of the individual to the external world is defined in accordance with the Marxist dialectical theory of knowledge: so that a psychologist who thinks of the brain as 'matter' in the ordinary sense of that word is a 'vulgar materialist', while one who believes the brain can create representations out of nothing other than itself is an 'idealist'. The dialectical materialist hypothesis does not confine reality to tangible matter; and in this differs from the 'vulgar materialist'; for the dialectician, the non- material relationships between things are as real as the things themselves. (See the paragraph on emotions below.) 8 Rubinstein is here alleged to distinguish a private consciousness of the individual, born of his own ratiocination, from a consciousness which comprises the individual's</page><page sequence="11">social nature of consciousness, the effect of class modes of thought on individual consciousness, the relation of social and individual con- sciousness: that is, he takes out of psychology the Marxist definition of consciousness. A Marxist understanding of emotions must see them as reflections of phenomena really existing in the external world in their real connection with us: that is, when we observe a phenomenon in the present or the past we relate ourselves to it, or to what we expect as possible or inevitable in the future. Emotions are not unconscious, for we cannot feel something unknown. Our views and convictions, the aspirations, tastes and habits of our emotions are not biological but social, and in principle they are social to the same degree as our thought-images of things, and are reflections of the external world. In everyday life will is aspiration, desire and endeavour: a strong will is persistence of aspiration, ability to realize our desire. We do not separate effort from consciousness and reason and see no need to sup- pose irrational impulses, for consciousness and reason are themselves impulses and excite us to activity9. Our endeavourings excite us to activity because they include contradiction, the source of motion: the aim is achieved ideally, in our representations, but not in practice. This contradiction is resolved by activity directed towards achievement of our goal. Will is therefore also a reflection of objective reality. The problem of the psychic properties of personality is always of the greatest interest and greatest practical value. This is the problem of the individual peculiarities of personality, of the ways of its development, of the causes and character of the individual differences between people, of the laws delimiting the degree and actual forms of these differences in the conditions of our Soviet reality. It is not accidental that this problem is in all psychology text-books discussed at the end, since its elucidation is the purpose of all psychological investigations.10 It is to be noted that Rubinstein sees the basic error of idealist psychology as the attempt to explain the behaviour of people by means 9 These two sentences are a description of everyday experience, not a formal, logical argument. The following sentences are an interpretation of the Marxist-Leninist theory of knowledge. 10 This definition of the purpose of psychological studies implies what is made plain in the critique below, that Soviet psychologists base none of their hypotheses on psycho- pathology. social experience and his formulation of it (ideologia). The passage is useful in defining the Russian concept of ideologia, which is the first general stage in the process of repre- sentation of experience. Thus the individual puts his total social experience (whether derived from his class or whole community) into representational form, and this ideologia, being naive and uncritical, is the raw material out of which disciplined and systematic concepts and principles are formed in philosophy. In the English word 'ideology' there is an implication that the naive and uncritical stage is permanent: this implication is absent in Russian thought. VOPROS Y FILOSOFII 220</page><page sequence="12">(PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY) of their ideas and notions. He is wrong: the basic error lies in the idealist view of ideas and notions as something primary. In fact, ideas and notions are (i) objective, true causes of the behaviour of people, and (ii) definable as reflections of their socially explicable requirements. What precludes the idealist from all possibility of a correct explanation of human behaviour is his failure to recognize the second of these points. Spiritual contradictions do exist, and materialist psychology should see behind the contradictoriness of our thoughts and views, as of our feelings, the existing contradictoriness of nature and of social life reflected in our thoughts, views and feelings. Rubinstein's abstract view of personality is also shown in his failure to mention the enormous experience of the Party in personnel selection techniques. (2) Yaroshevsky's critique of aspects of American psychology" Classical introspective psychology was insulated from the conditions of life (although consciousness is their reflection), and was subjective, studying consciousness by concentrating on images, ideas and mental representations. Marx and Engels created the materialist theory of consciousness, but in the second half of the nineteenth century non- Marxist psychology remained idealist. With the twentieth century there began the epoch of proletarian revolutions, and therewith con- sciousness became for the first time something to be feared; as on the one hand there were developed racial theories preparing for the exter- mination of colonial and semi-colonial peoples, so on the other the drift towards socialism became more conscious.'2 So there began a competi- tion between bourgeois and revisionist ideologues13 to attack the Marxist 11 This critique is interesting not for a novelty of ideas but for their systematic pursuit. The problem of what to do with consciousness in a mechanical society is perhaps discussed more knowledgeably in the West than the author of this critique would suppose, at least since the publication of Brave New World. 12 This does not mean, of course, that the author thinks of the 'drift to socialism' as being previously subconscious. On the contrary, since previously there could be no possibility of attaining socialism in life, so also its representation in the mind was impossible. The process envisaged is that participation in, and a dim awareness of, the early stages of the 'drift to socialism' leads by experience, through emphasis at first upon selected ideals of the old order, to an increase in awareness and purposefulness, an extension of consciousness. (The author here of course is assuming a restriction of the word socialism to its proper meaning, not including those last vestiges of tribal organ- ization ['primitive communism'] found, e.g. in the thought of Plato). 13 A revisionist is one who 'revises' Marxism by attempts to reconcile it with other philosophies. The 'ideologue' is a non-derogatory term for one who formulates the experience and aims of his social group, without submitting his formulations to the test of established philosophic standards. (In accordance with the Marxist-Leninist view of consciousness, it is assumed that work in dialectical materialist methods of investigation can only become fruitful in correspondence with the existence of societies experiencing the preparation for and achievement of socialism. Attempts to reconcile Marxism with other philosophies at the present day, or for some time to come, can therefore, it is argued, only lead to false syntheses; and the dissemination of such intellectual errors, whatever the intentions of their authors, inevitably helps to delay the practical achievement of socialist organization.) 221</page><page sequence="13">theory of consciousness. While Lenin's and Stalin's work on ideas in human development showed that the purely spiritual concept of ideas must be abandoned, and that the strength of ideas depends on their reflection of actual laws of process, elsewhere a hatred of the intellect and consciousness was born of the endeavour to destroy perception of the external world, for such perception condemns capitalism. So there arose more reactionary and unscientific theories than before, in which consciousness is subjected to dark, irrational forces or denied altogether. The stated aim of Behaviourism is to make psychology a natural science, that is, to reject consciousness, although consciousness is what differentiates psychology from physiology. The Behaviourists misinter- pret Pavlov's work, scorn to investigate the physiology of the brain, dismiss the scientific materialist conception of the work of the brain and reject the concept of the brain as the chief organ of co-ordination and integration of activity. Physiologists do not commit these errors. The supposed derivation of Behaviourism from animal psychology is as historically false as the derivation of Freudianism from neurological clinical work, and Gestalt psychology from experiments on auditory and visual concepts. Freud has admitted that the basic ideas came first (from Schopenhauer) in his case. By now the rat has become the hero of contemporary American bourgeois psychology, because that study is entrusted with the task of treating man as an animal, and the task derives from the need to eliminate consciousness and social consciousness from psychology. Even the theory of experiments is trial and error [instead of conscious planning]. The work of Wagner and Severtsev has shown that psychic reflections arise at a particular stage of living matter, and play an important part in adaptation to environment; but the whole passion of desire in the Behaviourists is directed to the expulsion of introspective observation from psychology. The Behaviourists also have sociological theories about what are called real problems of American life; their approach is said to revolu- tionize all the spiritual and moral sciences. This is an attempt to trans- form ordinary people into machines absolutely subject to external stimuli and with no internal activity; to change behaviour not by nurturing conscious attitudes, but by rooting them out and cultivating blind subordination to the external stimulus. So the growth of con- sciousness among millions of simple people is a threat to imperialism, and the fact of its growth leads to attempts to drown it. The superficial contradiction of Behaviourism by the impulse and deep analysis schools is obvious, but the factors common to both sides are more important. These schools have an unlimited hatred of recog- nizing human activity as the achievement of consciously proposed aims, and consider consciousness a pathetic delusion which must melt away. VOPROSY FILOSOFII 222</page><page sequence="14">(PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY) The impulses of McDougall are heritable, and so link up with the work of Weismann and Morgan. McDougall, like the Behaviourists, also has a social programme: to do away with intellect. The poisoned roots of Freudianism go deep into the bourgcois intelligentsia: this school is one of the most reptilian reflections of capitalist culture. Man is reduced to a struggle between powerless consciousness and the unconquerable sexual instinct, and pathological amoralism is made into a general law. The anti-rationalist movement began in Germany after I850, and Nietzsche is one of the exponents of consciousness considered as a mani- festation of unconscious forces. The influence of Weismann is seen in Freud's death wish, which represents the disintegration of bourgeois personality that makes its own devotio14 into an eternal law and provides a theory of war. New branches of psycho-analysis claim independence of Freud, for example Adler, with his inferiority complex and will to power, and Jung, with his libido as the psychic energy of the cosmos. If consciousness, reason, ideas, opinions, make social action, then it is important to define these notions of the deep analysis schools, which consider unconscious motives to be inherited and racial, and which see in industry their symbolic objectivization. The latest development is psychodrama, which claims that reservoirs of dissatisfaction are drained by psycho- dramatic action: that hostilities between social groups are transferred to drama. Deep analysis emphasizes motive, a problem imperfectly treated by nineteenth-century psychology. This problem of motive is said to arise from the investigation of hysteria, but in fact the sociologist, the historian, the economist and the jurist in capitalist society are not inter- ested in man for himself, in his thoughts, feelings, aspirations, with the whole wealth of the human psyche, but only in the motives of human behaviour, that is, that which impels. This usurpation of the central place by motive arises from an ideological need'l to replace social law by Psychological law, so that law, morals, religion or the class struggle are seen to arise not from the life of society but from the subconscious. Marxism has shown that classical psychology explains one psychic phenomenon by another, and not by the material conditions of life, of xNhich consciousness is a product. Deep analysis replaces one rotten theory by another. In the American development of intelligence tests, the IQ is supposed to measure all the capaLilities of man and to remain constant throughout life, no matter what the environment, like the germ plasm of Weismann and Morgan. It should be noted also that the 14 A formal vow, made by a Roman general when facing desperate odds, to die in the battle. 15 i.e. a need to make a naive and uncritical way of thought appear rational. 223</page><page sequence="15">VOPROSY FILOSOFII American 'environment' is not at all the same thing as the Marxist 'way of life' (byt) which delimits people's psychical habits. For instance, M/ill's experiments on mice are supposed to prove that a hot climate is bad for the intelligence: so that here 'environment', and not heredity, serves for a fascist theory [i.e. that Negroes are innately of low intelli- gence]. PHILOSOPHY PROPER [Siderov's report on the discussion (by an open session of the Academic Council of the Institute of Philosophy, December 23rd and 25th, 1948) of Leonov's book Outline of Dialectical Materialism is of interest in several ways. In the light of Zhdanov's condemnation of cliques, it is note- worthy that this discussion had about 40 participants, some contributing by letter, and many provincial names appear in the list, reporting on discussions organized by local bodies. Zhdanov's approach to the problems is used as a general framework, but there is no imitative repetition of his language. Among the points mentioned by Siderov are:] The main problems on which the discussion centred were: Bolshevik loyalty to principle (partiinost) in philosophy; the creative approach, including the development of theory and the application of Marxist- Leninist philosophy to big contemporary problems; and the con- nection of philosophy with the latest data of natural science. Leonov's formulation that 'every development is a contradiction because it contains in itself the unity of change and stability' was criticized as using a part of the concept of 'the old and the new' in mistake for the whole. Leonov was criticized for using Einstein's defective cosmology, instead of restricting himself to the critical use of Einstein's physical theories. An important aspect of books on dialectical materialism is their work as guides to Soviet youth, for our heroic youth, working out its view of the world, seeks in philosophy the scientific general basis of its patriotic feelings for Soviet morality and Soviet culture. Leonov was said to have criticized too mildly the tendency of idealism to be a parasite on the difficulties in science. It was pointed out that while in general the accidental may be identified with the particular and the necessary with the general, the relationship of these categories changes with the introduction of con- sciousness into society at the socialist stage. The relationship is elemental [and uncontrolled] in nature and in the exploiting stages of social development.16 16 This of course implies - since 'primitive communism' precedes exploiting society - that the earliest stages of human organization may be treated under the general 224</page><page sequence="16">(PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY) The report (pp. 348-50) on a conference of philosophers and econo- mists working in various departments of the Moscow State Institute of Economics summarizes papers on (i) Socialism as the first phase of Communism, (ii) Percentage annual rates of increase in Soviet industrial production, (iii) Criticism and self-criticism as the motive force of developing Soviet society,l7 and (iv) Mastery of the laws of social development in Socialism. The reporter concludes: It is hoped that this conference will at last move the Department of Philosophy to study the methodology of its subject, that is, the bearing of its lectures and seminars on the subjects which are found in economics. The staff and students of the Institute have long awaited this revolution in the Department of Philosophy.'1 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY A. M. Bogoutdinov announces that he and A. P. Kolpakov are prepar- ing a Russian translation of Avicenna's Donish Name (Donish Moe, or Khakmeti Alai) from the original Darian (old literary Tadjik). It has previously been published in the original, at Hyderabad in I891 (part only), and in Teheran in I938 (editor: Ahmed of Khorosan). The work is in two volumes (I) logic and metaphysics, (z) physics, mathematics, astronomy and music. In his Darian works, Avicenna makes proposi- tions avoided in his Arabic works for fear of heresy. For all his care, his cosmology (the world is an emanation of divinity, not less eternal than God, and due not to his will but to necessity) was condemned and Avicenna's library confiscated in 1160. Avicenna's classification of the sciences differs from Aristotle's in ways which show Avicenna's critical and historical capacity: he system- atized his material, saw the interrelations and generalized widely. He held that existence included the accidental but was not based on it: at the time of writing this work he was hostile to neo-Platonism. His 17 This paper by Docent S. D. Feld made the points that socialist competition is definable as 'criticism by action' and that in developing techniques of criticism and self- criticism the Party has to struggle against tendencies to humiliate or to seize on trivial- ities, etc., and against the repression of criticism. 18 In addition to the universities, almost all Soviet specialized higher educational institutions have departments (Kafedry) of Philosophy or of Marxism-Leninism, whose function is to teach Marxist sociology and philosophy, the latter with particular reference to the main subject of the institution. A conference of the heads of such Departments, convened in July 1949 by the Ministry of Higher Education, is reported at length in Vestnik Vysshei Shkoly (Bulletin of Higher Education) 8/1949. It was pointed out at this conference that there are more than 800 Departments of Marxism- Leninism in the U.S.S.R. heading of nature, and form a transitional phase between nature and society. This implication for historiographic theory may be compared with other implications in the same field found in the editorial criticism of Kedrov, and Alexandrov's article summar- ized below, to suggest that a Soviet critique of the definition and employment of the Hegelian and Marxist historical epochs will soon be overdue. 225</page><page sequence="17">definition of time was that it was the measure of different activities. He defined God as the first reason which was not wholly simple, for it included form; and the secondary reason comprised the soul and the form of the sphere. His theory of perception and its relation to thought was ultimately materialist, for he believed sense perception was primary; but it contains many idealist concepts. His psychophysiological theories of illnesses of the brain are based on his theory of perception and the eternity of matter. His criteria of knowledge are sensation, experience and acceptance by the people.'1 CRITIQUES OF FOREIGN INTELLECTUAL WORK [Two of the papers in this section have already appeared in English (Denisova in Current Digest of the Soviet Press, I, 25, and Trachtenberg in the same, I, 27), and are not summarized here. Varkar's article is not Russian work, and is therefore not summarized. Those remaining are Alexandrov on Cosmopolitanism, and Shishkin on Anglo-American ethical studies.] Professor Alexandrov's paper traces some aspects of the effects of cosmopolitanism in Russian intellectual history. He associates Russian cosmopolitans before the revolution with the influx of foreign capital; and derives from them the participation of the white emigres in talk about world government and intervention in the U.S.S.R. At the same time within Russia, Lenin was opposing Bukharin's slogan 'down with frontiers'; and Trotsky is regarded as the arch-cosmopolitan of Russia. The paper ends with a criticism of Professor Kedrov, who is said to have emphasized the importance of world epochs of thought to the detriment of national facts, which must be studied in their actual historical context. [It will be remembered that Professor Alexandrov's work was criticized in general and in detail by Zhdanov, and a later article of his is also criticized in the editorial summarized above. His recent articles have been concerned not with the history of philosophy, but with general aspects of Marxism and anti-Marxist thought, and these appear to be attempts to reach the heart of philosophy by studying its current formation.] [Shishkin's article on contemporary English and American ethical studies is not concerned with the whole range of western thought on this subject, but with a group of writings which are by no means representative of the main body of western ethical convictions and 19 Bogoutdinov's short critique of Avicenna's system is concerned to emphasize its independence of neo-Platonism. He does not discuss the phenomenon common in ancient and feudal thought of the personalization of process, nor compare Avicenna's divine personalization of eternal laws of process with other previous or contemporary divine personalizations.

Consequently the evidence led by no means supports his general conclusion, that western ethical thought is exhausted. More- over, although his judgments are based upon a wealth of quotation from his sources, he sometimes misinterprets their contentions completely, as for example when he translates the current cliche of a choice between anarchy and totalitarianism into a choice between western capitalism and Hitlerite fascism. The general line of his thought may be summar- ized as follows:] The crisis of values in capitalist life is reflected in the crisis of the capitalist theory of values; there is a quest for confidence but an aware- ness of future collapse which leads to pessimism. The influence of communism and the U.S.S.R. on the peoples of the capitalist countries, as well as on the dependent and colonial peoples, is obvious, and ethics has become nothing more than a justification of western moral culture. There is no belief in the possibility of a scientific basis for morals: the West holds that science deals with objective facts and philosophy with values. The students of ethics are objectivist in face of a third imperialist war, and so are responsible for encouraging the amoralism of the capitalists. Judgments are held to have no rational basis, to be emotive, and just as subjective idealism in philosophy reduces the world to 'my sensations', so in ethics it reduces the good to 'my approval'. A number of schools disguise the interests of the parts as the 'harmony' of the social whole: these, like ethical relativism and ethical absolutism, arise from an inability to study the laws of social development. Some blame 'the machine' for upsetting previous customary norms: by 'machine' they really mean capitalism. The chief struggle is against Marxist ethics, and its objective and rigorous norms and principles derived from a scientific understanding of society;20 ethical relativism was important in the thought of Rosenberg and Goebbels. 20 The author refers to a view of ethics familiar to his intended readers, which may perhaps be defined as follows. Just as each general stage of human development possesses a certain level of consciousness which is the highest attainable in the historical condi- tions, so it also possesses an understanding of good and evil which is the highest attainable in the same conditions. Since we needs must love the highest when we see it, it is the duty of each individual not to aim lower in his own morals than the ethical ideals of his society; and a society or social group which falls short in its ethical ideal of those ideals previously established is morally retrogressive. It follows from the general propositions of historical and dialectical materialism that a community in a higher stage of organization will reflect its social attainments in its higher stage of morals; and con- sequently ethical studies may be closely related to, and based on, the exact knowledge ('science') which is provided by sociology. Moreover, according to the Marxist-Leninist view of consciousness, the ethical ideal of any society is first formed in practice and stated in ideology, then disciplined by philosophy. It is next the function of such specializations as education and literature to disseminate the philosophically criticized moral ideals in society at large. Since all these processes are continuous, the philoso- phical form of the ethical ideal will often lag behind the formative process in life, and this 'struggle between the old and the new' will be uncovered at the stage of dissemin- ation. 227</page><page sequence="19">But relativism cannot be taught to the masses, who must be given 'eternal' values: hence the concept of indoctrination, the use of religious propaganda, the distinction between rational and irrational conviction and the study of methods of mass excitation. The emphasis is placed on the internal world of the individual, for individual self-love strengthens bourgeois society: consequently some propose reforms of individuality and retardations of technique and science. Others apply Christianity to private life, and its cleansing of fear and sin. Others speak of an abso- lutely free man, outside society; the existentialist flight from necessity is really a flight from freedom, an elemental subordination to necessity instead of its conscious harnessing. The cry for independence of all moral norms is an echo of Nietzsche. The opponents of extreme individualism attempt to reconcile the individual and society by collectivizing both society and the individual through world government, through cosmopolitan ethics and through the enjoyment of profits in full idleness: the 'general good' is defined in capitalist terms. There is a supposition that morals and law are separable,21 that morality is higher than law, and that amoralism is justified. There is a regret at the absence of moral unity (which cannot exist in capitalism), and an increasing borrowing from fascist experience. Bourgeois ethics are not in a condition to produce a moral ideal capable of quickening decomposing bourgeois culture and raising its authority in the eyes of the people. The morals of the productive classes, on the other hand, are created and tempered in the class struggle, and find their real development when socialism is victorious. This is a morality which is new in kind, and for all society; it begets a new kind of human culture and a new universal morality.22 21 The author refers to a view of law and morals familiar to his intended readers that in general, after making all allowances for the effects of conflict of interests and delay in turning ideology into disciplined thought, it may be said that the law of a society is the formulation of its morals as attained and consolidated at a given stage of its develop- ment. Moral progress is accompanied by changes in law: consequently - it is assumed - attempts to dissociate morals and laws belong typically to the promoters of moral decay. 22 In addition to the articles by Denisova and Trachtenberg, those by Shishkin, Bogoutdinov and Varkar have appeared, in condensed translation, in Current Digest of the Soviet Press under the following general headings: 'Analysis of Anglo-American Ethics' (I. 38), 'Avicenna as an original thinker' (I. 38), 'The Class Nature of the Gandhi Doctrine' (I. 37).

The main divisions of the list are Dialectical Materialism, Historical Materialism, History of Philosophy, Emergence and Development of Marxist-Leninist philosophy. The list contains 367 titles, and as an example we append the 32 titles given in the Historical Materialism section under the subhead of Soviet way of thought [ideologia], Ethics Aesthetics and Culture.] Soviet politics and way of thought Principal features and laws of the development of socialist consciousness Formation of socialist consciousness amongst the kolkhoz peasantry Overcoming of capitalist remnants in the consciousness of people Socialist psychology and the socialist way of thought Function of work in communist education [kommunisticheskoye vospit- aniye] Cultivation [vospitanye] of a communist attitude to work Principles of communist morality The personal and social in socialist conditions Concept of social duty Morality of Soviet man Moral and social [politicheskoye] unity as a motive force of Soviet society Proletarian internationalism against bourgeois cosmopolitanism Cosmopolitanism as the reactionary way of thought of the imperialist bourgeoisie Soviet patriotism as a motive force of Soviet society National traditions in Soviet patriotism Principal features of Soviet patriotism Cultivation of Soviet patriotism Function of the socialist way of thought in the development of Soviet society.

The changes are not numerous in the section under consideration: there are four alterations, as follows: Psychology of Soviet people and the socialist way of thought [instead of 'Socialist psychology and ...'] Social duty of Soviet man [instead of 'Concept of social duty'] Struggle of proletarian internationalism against bourgeois cosmopolitanism [the words 'Struggle of' are added] Principal methodological features of socialist realism [instead of 'Principal features of socialist realist aesthetics'] The first two changes move away from the contemplation of abstractions; the third excludes the possibility of a merely contemplative study; the fourth again turns the emphasis away from contemplation to method. There is one omission-'Partiinost in the social sciences'-of a subject plainly too large for a first research degree; and four additions: The morale of class society Marxism-Leninism on religion (to include new data on the history of religion and atheism) Marxism-Leninism as militant atheism Marxism-Leninism on war.</page></plain_text>
