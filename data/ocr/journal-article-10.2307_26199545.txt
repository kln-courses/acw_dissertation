<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tbeologie, Philosophic und Mystik im zwolferschiitischen Islam des 9./15. Jahrhunderts. By Sabine Schmidtke (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2000), 363 pp. Price HB $103.00. ISBN 90-04-11531-5. Islamicists studying the history of Muslim theology and philosophy have generally adopted one of two methodologies. The first is to take a particular theological problem (anthropomorphism, the created/uncreated status of the Qur'an, or predestination) and produce what might be called a 'genealogy' of the debates connected with these issues. This approach has the advantage of introducing the untutored reader to an account of the development of Islamic theology generally, and the specific terms of the debate selected by the author in particular. The alternative approach is to select one theologian and analyse his theology in toto. This approach has the advantage of demonstrating the consistencies (and perhaps inconsistencies) between different elements of a scholar's theology, thereby informing the reader of the interconnected nature of the issues normally included in works of kalam. It is often thought that the student of Islamic theology should begin with the general accounts, and only after mastering the 'geography' of Islamic theology can he or she move on to more specific, individual studies. I am not so convinced, and Sabine Schmidtke's fine work on Ibn Abl Jumhur al-Ahsa'I (d. 906/1501) goes some way towards persuading me that isolating individual topics of kalam discussion and tracing their development through history may yet prove to have impoverished our understanding of the richness and interconnected nature of Islamic philosophy, theology, and mysticism. While Schmidtke may not use these words, she presents a case for a 'strong' reading of an individual scholar's authorial input into his works. She works on the premiss that through an analysis of Ibn Abl Jumhur's works one gains access to a scholarly mind, whose theology can be systematized (though not necessarily considered entirely coherent) through the citation of different works on linked topics. Close reading of the texts attributed to Ibn Abl Jumhur, detailed citation of works in manuscript (and the variants therein), and a laudable attention to detail characterize this book. It continues the high standard of scholarship displayed in her earlier work on another ImamI theologian, al-'Allama al-Hilll, The Theology of'Allama al-Hilli (d. 726/1325) (Berlin, 1991). The appendices alone provide scholars of Imam! Shfism with essential tools for research. They consist of (a) a list of Ibn Abl Jumhur's works (together with manuscript locations and dates); (b) an index of citations in Ibn Abl Jumhur's essays, al-Mujli and al-Nfir al-Mimji from the illuminationist</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 8l work of al-Shahrazuri, al-Shajara al-Ildhiyya, and (c) a detailed examination of Ibn Abl Jumhur's scholarly pedigree through the ijazas, linking him to the grand masters of previous Imam! scholarship. It will be some time, I feel, before we need additional reference material for a study of Ibn Abl Jumhur. From the analysis of his thought presented in the body of the book, Schmidtke presents Ibn Abl Jumhur's philosophical theology. After an intro duction (chapter 1) and a comprehensive biography and list of works (chapter 2), Schmidtke describes Ibn Abl Jumhur's thoughts on the nature of God (chapter 3), justice (chapter 4), prophethood (chapter 5), resurrection (chapter 6), and the Promise and the Threat (chapter 7). There is an 'Exkurs', appended to chapter 6 on Ibn AbT Jumhur's theory of resurrection, concerning the Ishraqi school of philosophy and its views on metempsychosis, which enables the reader unfamiliar with these matters to place Ibn Abl Jumhur's theory in perspective. Unsurprisingly (for an Imam! theologian), his thoughts are broadly based around Mu'tazill themes, though mixed in with this influence is a clear, philosophical understanding of God, justice, and prophethood drawing on (and responding to) an Avicennan understanding of these issues, with clear influence from Ibn al-'Arabl also. The main source for Schmidtke's analysis here is Ibn Abl Jumhur's Kashf al-Barahin, which unfortunately remains in manuscript (India Office 471 (1)), together with the various essays found in the printed edition of al-Mujli. What is perhaps surprising is that there is little in Schmidtke's analysis of Ibn Abl Jumhur's theology that one might consider distinctively ImamI, let alone Shl'T. Of course, Ibn Abl Jumhur does make reference to past ImamI scholars, and never fails to identify himself as one of the Imamiyya (in the familiar expression ashdbuna). The analysis of Ibn Abl Jumhur's theory of Prophecy, for example, draws on a number of Muslim conceptions of prophecy—both philosophical and strictly theological—but there is little reference to imama, and the intriguing differences between this and nubuwwa. This was a topic of sectarian importance, for obvious reasons, and one would have expected it to have a more prominent place in Schmidtke's analysis—though this may reflect its sidelining by Ibn Abl Jumhur himself. Another area of Ibn Abl Jumhur's activity which is touched upon, but not explored, is his famed role as a transmitter of Hadith, and how this relates (or does not relate) to his theological and philosophical views. His Hadith collections Durar al-La'all and Ghawali al-La'dli were used extensively by Safavid scholars. For example, Muhammad Baqir al-MajlisI mentions them as works utilized for his Bihar al-Anwar (Tehran, 1948-68) vol. i, p. 12. His treatises on legal theory would surely have further deepened an understanding of Ibn Abl Jumhur's theology. Because of my own research interests, I would be particularly curious to investigate the theological and philosophical discussions that are undoubtedly present in the works of usul al-fiqh, mentioned in the book's first appendix: al-Risala al-Jumhuriyya, the commentary on the Tabdbib, Qabs al-iqtida', and al-Ma'alim al-Sandbisiyya (the last two may, of course, not be extant). Schmidtke's clarity of expression and diligent referencing of sources make this work not only an excellent study of a fascinating theologian and</page><page sequence="3">8z BOOK REVIEWS philosopher, but also a useful account of ImamI philosophical theology generally. The bibliography in appendix 4 serves as a 'state of the discipline' reference work, and further enhances the utility of what is already a ground breaking study.
