<plain_text><page sequence="1">HUME ON IDOLATRY AND INCARNATION BY DONALD T. SIEBERT David Hume's quarrel with religion is well-known.1 In the Dialogues concerning Natural Religion he subjected theological arguments, whether a priori or a posteriori, to a devastating scrutiny and whittled away the basis for any belief in a God who is more substantial than a mere possibility of a First Cause bearing "some remote Analogy to human Intelligence" (D, 260).2 As we gather from the stimulating interplay of disputants in that work, Hume enjoyed the challenge of such argumen- tation; it was a subject that he could pursue with detachment and serenity of mind. Hume's real objection to religion, however, was not that it failed of proof, its conviction relying finally on faith, not reason. That was surely a matter about which he could afford to be indifferent or even amused. Rather, Hume's quarrel with religion stems from his claim that piety is an enemy of morality, and indeed the main enemy. This charge is iconoclastic, for the usual recommendation of religion, even by those who reject it otherwise, is that at least it makes men moral: Cleanthes 1 Among the better general discussions are James Noxon, "Hume's Concern with Religion," in David Hume: Many-Sided Genius, ed.

Hume attacks even this last bulwark of religious belief-in the Dialogues, and most vigorously in The Natural History of Religion.3 And on his deathbed he shocked James Boswell by his contempt for all aspects of religion, including its vaunted morality. According to Boswell's Journal, "He then said flatly that the morality of every religion was bad, and, I really thought, was not jocular when he said that when he heard a man was religious, he concluded he was a rascal, though he had known some instances of very good men being religious. This was just an extravagant reverse of the common remarks as to infidels."4 Yet as Hume acknowledged in The Natural History of Religion (hence- forth NHR), religious belief would not disappear once philosophy brings its light, even in the unlikely event that clergymen should lose interest in proseletyzing and intimidating helpless men. Religion's "root strikes deeper into the mind, and springs from the essential and universal prop- erties of human nature" (NHR, 92). Hume emphasized in NHR that it is one thing for physico-theologians, deists (Hume referred to them as genuine theists), and theodicean apologists to point upward to the splen- dor of Newtonian order, to the reign of universal law and harmony voiced succinctly by Alexander Pope, Nature, and Nature's Laws lay hid in Night. God said, Let Newton be! and All was Light.5 Mankind in fact is more disposed to look downward at the events of life, shrouded in darkness. Men suffer pain and disappointment, and dread the future, especially death. They sense mysterious and invisible power and desperately seek some means of placating it: "No wonder, then, that mankind, being placed in such an absolute ignorance of causes, and being at the same time so anxious concerning their future fortunes, should immediately acknowledge a dependence on invisible powers, possest of sentiment and intelligence" (NHR, 34). This whole disposition of mind exacerbates their suspicions and fears and leads them to grasp any sup- posed remedy, however selfish or unworthy of reason, which promises to protect them. It is not a situation calculated to bring about that Humean ideal of a civilization marked by open-mindedness, toleration, cheerfulness, service to others, and an enterprising concern with the things of this world. 3 In the first Enquiry (see the edition of the Enquiries listed above, p. 147), Hume mentioned the possible moral influence of religion, but his own position is somewhat ambiguous because the speaker for Epicurus does not reply. Later, as we see, Hume unequivocally rejected the possibility of moral influence. 4 The Yale Editions of the Private Papers of James Boswell: Boswell in Extremes, 1776- 1778, ed. Charles McC.

To the privileged few Hume offers the salvation of being like him, enjoying "a manly, steddy virtue, . .. the calm sunshine of the mind," before which "these spectres of false divinity never make their appearance" (NHR, 91). But what about "the ignorant multitude" (NHR, 27, 33), that is, the "vulgar, indeed, all mankind, a few excepted"? (NHR, 57) Philosophy hath neither light nor charms for them, and, as Hume made abundantly clear in NHR and in his History of England, their delusions born of spiritual mania threaten the stability of a society which the fit, though few, might otherwise enjoy to the fullest. Hume has no programme, as such, no ready answer, but as I hope this paper will show, implicit in NHR and other works published later in his career is a growing appreciation of the power of religious rites and images to control or even neutralize the dangerous caprices of pious zeal. And we shall see an important shift in Hume's attitude toward certain forms of Christianity. Central to the problem of pious zeal is man's attempt to understand the nature of his God, indeed to make his deity concrete. Throughout NHR Hume tended to regard this effort to render the incomprehensible familiar to the feeble intellect of man as manifestly absurd. Still, if absurd, it is no less a fact of human nature: And thus, however strong men's propensity to believe invisible, intelligent power in nature, their propensity is equally strong to rest their attention on sensible, visible objects; and in order to reconcile these opposite inclinations, they are led to unite the invisible power with some visible object.... (NHR, 46) And as an invisible spiritual intelligence is an object too refined for vulgar apprehension, men naturally affix it to some sensible representation; such as either the more conspicuous parts of nature, or the statues, images, and pictures, which a more refined age forms of its divinities. (NHR, 49) It is important to stress that even though Hume's ridicule of idolatry is more often directed against primitive polytheism, his thesis in NHR is that polytheism and the more sophisticated forms of monotheism are not essentially different, except that, for reasons we shall soon explore, polytheism is actually preferable because by promoting sociability and materialism it is less immoral than monotheism. Men are idolaters by nature; the problem for Hume was to ensure that idolatry would be useful and constructive, instead of exerting that malign influence most often observed in human history:6 The universal propensity to believe in invisible, intelligent power, if not an original instinct, being at least a general attendant of human nature, may be 6 Cf. Philo's remark in the Dialogues: "If the religious spirit be ever mention'd in any historical Narration, we are sure to meet afterwards with a Detail of the Miseries, which attend it. And no Period of time can be happier or more prosperous, than those in which it is never regarded, or heard of" (D, 251).</page><page sequence="4">382 DONALD T. SIEBERT considered as a kind of mark or stamp, which the divine workman has set upon his work; and nothing surely can more dignify mankind, than to be thus selected from all the other parts of the creation, and to bear the image or impression of the universal Creator. But consult this image, as it commonly appears in the popular religions of the world. How is the deity disfigured in our representations of him! What caprice, absurdity, and immorality are attributed to him! How much is he degraded even below the character which we should naturally, in common life, ascribe to a man of sense and virtue! (NHR, 93-94) In this passage, even allowing for a degree of irony or overstatement, we see Hume ready to countenance the human desire to image the deity- "nothing surely can more dignify mankind"-except of course that men have invariably disgraced themselves in their actual efforts to fashion that image. But here we do see that Hume regards the disfiguring of the deity as the source of religious error. In other words, how man pictures his god and all his ceremonial means of communing with that god will determine the moral nature of his religion, and of course the degree to which he will be a useful or destructive member of his society. By 1757, the date of NHR, the question was not whether man should attempt to make his god concrete, but rather how and to what extent. By contrast, the early Hume regarded the use of icons, vestments, liturgy, and sacred rites of all kinds to be misguided and foolish-but of little consequence to society. In A Treatise of Human Nature (Bk. III, 1740) he had dismissed in passing religious ceremonies and symbols. They might be compared to certain legal ceremonies and practices, like those involving promises and contracts, but there is a fundamental difference: such forms do serve a purpose in the law because justice is necessary to society; they serve no purpose in religion except to bedazzle the masses (T, 515-16, 523-25). In An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals (1751) Hume developed this idea more fully.7 After admitting that "those, who ridicule vulgar superstitions, and expose the folly of particular regards to meats, days, places, postures, apparel, have an easy task ...," Hume takes up that easy task by ridiculing these superstitions: "A fowl on Thursday is lawful food; on Friday abominable: Eggs in this house and in this diocese, are permitted during Lent; a hundred paces further, to eat them is a damnable sin. This earth or building, yesterday was profane; to-day, by the muttering of certain words, it has become holy and sacred" (EPM, 198). Then, after suggesting that legal rites are often just as silly, he makes this striking distinction between legal and religious forms: 7 The first Enquiry also reflects Hume's contempt for religious ceremonies, but he never makes them a principal object of concern. Discussing "the effect of resemblance in enlivening ... ideas," Hume rehearses the reasons which Roman Catholics "usually plead in excuse for the mummeries, with which they are upbraided ..." (Enquiries, 51- 52). Hume's reference to these ceremonies is scornful, but his main purpose here is merely to exemplify his argument concerning the power of resemblance.</page><page sequence="5">HUME ON IDOLATRY AND INCARNATION 383 But there is this material difference between superstition and justice, that the former is frivolous, useless, and burdensome; the latter is absolutely requisite to the well-being of mankind and existence of society.... Were the interests of society nowise concerned, it is as unintelligible why another's articulating certain sounds implying consent, should change the nature of my actions with regard to a particular object, as why the reciting of a liturgy by a priest, in a certain habit and posture, should dedicate a heap of brick and timber, and render it, thenceforth and for ever, sacred. (EPM, 199) Two points stand out that will be of significance later in our discussion: (1) as late as 1751 Hume considered religious forms "nowise concerned" in "the interests of society"; and (2) his language reveals an undisguised contempt for this useless mummery. I shall show how this attitude under- went a marked change. Another important source of Hume's early opinion of religious forms is a letter written in 1743 to William Mure of Caldwell. In a part of that letter, Hume first divides "every thing we commonly call Religion" into "Devotion &amp; Prayer" and "the Practice of Morality, &amp; the Assent of the Understanding to the Proposition that God exists" (HL, I, 50). It is a division Hume would characteristically make throughout his writings on religion, and we sense that even that early he was formulating the ar- gument that devotion and prayer could become the bane of the "Practice of Morality." The remainder of the letter concerns the abuses of worship, and it is significant that Hume identifies the conjunction of invisible spirit and concrete object (to which in this paper I am applying the general term "incarnation") as the germ of the problem. Consider Hume's observations: ... I assert [the Deity] is not the natural Object of any Passion or Affection. He is no Object either of the Senses or Imagination, &amp; very little of the Un- derstanding, without which it is impossible to excite any Affection. A remote Ancestor, who has left us Estates &amp; Honours, acquir'd with Virtue, is a great Benefactor, &amp; yet 'tis impossible to bear him any Affection, because unknown to us; tho in general we know him to be a Man or a human Creature, which brings him vastly nearer our Comprehension than an invisible infinite Spirit. A man, therefore, may have his Heart perfectly well disposed towards every proper &amp; natural Object of Affection, Friends, Benefactors, Countrey, Children &amp;c, &amp; yet from this Circumstance of the Invisibility &amp; Incomprehensibility of the Deity may feel no affection towards him. And indeed I am afraid, that all Enthusiasts mightily deceive themselves. Hope &amp; Fear perhaps agitate their Breast when they think of the Deity: Or they degrade him into a Resemblance with themselves, &amp; by that means render him more comprehensible. Or they exult with Vanity in esteeming themselves his peculiar Favourites. Or at best they are actuated by a forc'd &amp; strain'd Affection, which moves by Starts &amp; Bounds, &amp; with a very irregular disorderly Pace. Such an Affection can not be requir'd of any Man as his Duty. Please to observe, that I not only exclude the turbulent Passions, but the calm Affections. Neither of them can operate without the Assistance of</page><page sequence="6">384 DONALD T. SIEBERT the Senses, &amp; Imagination, or at least a more compleat Knowledge of the Object than we have of the Deity. (HL, I, 51) Then, after raising several objections to the use of prayer, Hume con- cludes: "Thus all wise Men have excluded the Use of Images &amp; Pictures in Prayer; tho they certainly enliven Devotion; because 'tis found by Experience, that with the vulgar these visible Representations draw too much towards them, &amp; become the only Objects of Devotion" (HL, I, 52). We note in these passages that Hume categorically opposed worship on the grounds that it is impossible even to conceptualize the Deity to any meaningful extent, thus certainly futile to attempt bringing God nearer by means of images or anthropomorphic analogies; worship ac- cordingly degenerates into idolatry, which Hume dismissed with pe- remptory scorn. At that early stage in his life, Hume found such worship empty and useless. I am arguing that Hume's attitude toward idolatry and incarnation underwent a change evident by 1757 in NHR. The process of this change itself and a reason for the change are to be found in the first volume of the History of England (1754). As we observe the process, the reason for the change will begin to suggest itself. In the early part of the History, Hume treated religious ceremonies and forms in that reductive fashion so prominent in the second Enquiry, where he said that a priest's muttering a liturgy made "a heap of brick and timber ... thenceforth and for ever, sacred." An excellent example is Hume's satirical description of (then) Bishop William Laud's conse- cration of St. Catherine's Church (History, Ch. LII). Having emphasized that the Puritans regarded any ceremonial practice even faintly popish with "the greatest horror and detestation," Hume then portrays Laud as imposing such rituals on them almost out of spite, as if determined to rub their noses in abominations. That aspect of Laud's excesses must have amused Hume, for he pretends that Laud's main intention was to offend the humorless Puritans, who "considered not, that the very in- significancy of these ceremonies recommended them to the superstitious prelate, and made them appear the more peculiarly sacred and religious, as they could serve to no other purpose." It is surely not fair to Laud, but it does underline Hume's complete inability at this point to see any value in these empty forms other than that of vexing Roundheads. Hume then describes the consecration at great length, indeed in sufficient detail to serve as a guidebook for priests. Laud went about the consecration with exaggerated formality, bowing and kneeling, pronouncing blessings and imprecations with punctilious regularity and strained solemnity. Hume presents every symbolic nuance:8 8 I am omitting more than a page of detailed description. It is significant to note that the whole passage is a fairly close paraphrase of Hume's source-John Rushworth, Historical Collections (London, 1721), II, 76-77-except that Hume tends to dramatize</page><page sequence="7">HUME ON IDOLATRY AND INCARNATION 385 As he approached the communion-table, he made many low reverences: and coming up to that part of the table where the bread and wine lay, he bowed seven times. After the reading of many prayers, he approached the sacramental elements, and gently lifted up the comer of the napkin in which the bread was placed. When he beheld the bread, he suddenly let fall the napkin, flew back a step or two, bowed three several times towards the bread; then he drew nigh again, opened the napkin, and bowed as before. Next, he laid his hand on the cup, which had a cover upon it, and was filled with wine. He let go the cup, fell back, and bowed thrice towards it. He approached again; and lifting up the cover, peeped into the cup. Seeing the wine, he let fall the cover, started back, and bowed as before. Then he received the sacrament, and gave it to others. And many prayers being said, the solemnity of the consecration ended. The walls and floor and roof of the fabric were then supposed to be sufficiently holy. (History, Ch. LII) The whole description, particularly the final comment (which is not in Hume's source but is rather all his own), exemplifies the ideas of the second Enquiry. Clearly in this passage Hume regarded such forms as nothing but mummery. Their only function, as far as he was concerned, was to scandalize the Puritans, a bit of torment they apparently deserved. The general comments about Laud's innovations also reveal Hume's scorn for this pointless ceremony, consonant with his remarks in the letter to Mure: All kinds of ornament, especially pictures, were necessary for supporting that mechanical devotion, which was purposed to be raised in this model of religion: but as these had been so much employed by the church of Rome, and had given rise to so much superstition, or what the Puritans called idolatry; it was im- possible to introduce them into English churches, without exciting general mur- murs and complaints.... The crucifix too, that eternal consolation of all pious Catholics, and terror to all sound Protestants, was not forgotten on this occasion. Hume reminds us that ceremonial worship depends upon pictures or icons, and I suspect that at least in one respect Hume agreed with the Puritans that such worship might well be called idolatry. Once again Hume was simply contemptuous of this "mechanical devotion." This gleeful debunking of sacred rites is characteristic of Hume, and yet in the History we also notice a somewhat less derisive attitude toward these ceremonies beginning to develop. Hume enjoyed mocking super- the episode and exaggerate a few details. For example, whereas in Rushworth, Laud on two occasions bows "several" times, in Hume he bows "frequently" or makes "many low reverences." Other dramatic touches such as the clause "he suddenly let fall the napkin" are Hume's interpolation. And in addition to the final sarcastic remark, the tone of the passage reflects Hume's lack of sympathy with the entire affair. Thus Rushworth wrote, "When the Curses were ended, he pronounced a number of Blessings .. ."; Hume wrote, "The imprecations being all so piously finished, there were poured out a number of blessings...."</page><page sequence="8">386 DONALD T. SIEBERT stitious practice, without doubt, but he had to consider the implications of the other extreme, the amorphous simplicity of Puritan religion. What was the capacity of man for a spiritual communion liberated from the dross of material ornaments and liturgy? What would happen when these apparently meaningless forms were discarded? Writing of James I's efforts to introduce traditional ceremonies into the Kirk, Hume speculated on these problems in a passage which deserves complete quotation: The fire of devotion, excited by novelty and inflamed by opposition, had so possessed the minds of the Scottish reformers, that all rites and ornaments, and even order of worship, were disdainfully rejected as useless burdens; retarding the imagination in its rapturous ecstasies, and cramping the operations of that divine spirit, by which they supposed themselves to be animated. A mode of worship was established, the most naked and most simple imaginable; one that borrowed nothing from the senses; but reposed itself entirely on the contem- plation of that divine essence, which discovers itself to the understanding only. This species of devotion so worthy of the Supreme Being, but so little suitable to human frailty, was observed to occasion great disturbances in the breast, and in many respects to confound all rational principles of conduct and behavior. The mind, straining for these extraordinary raptures, reaching them by short glances, sinking again under its own weakness, rejecting all exterior aid of pomp and ceremony, was so occupied in this inward life, that it fled from every intercourse of society, and from every cheerful amusement, which could soften or humanize the character. It was obvious to all discerning eyes, and had not escaped the king's, that, by the prevalence of fanaticism, a gloomy and sullen disposition established itself among the people; a spirit, obstinate and dangerous; independent and disorderly; animated equally with a contempt of authority, and a hatred to every other mode of religion, particularly to the Catholic. In order to mellow these humours, James endeavoured to infuse a small tincture of ceremony into the national worship, and to introduce such rites as might, in some degree, occupy the mind, and please the senses, without departing too far from that simplicity, by which the reformation was distinguished. The finer arts, too, though still rude in these northern kingdoms, were employed to adorn the churches; and the king's chapel, in which an organ was erected, and some pictures and statues displayed, was proposed as a model to the rest of the nation. But music was grating to the prejudiced ears of the Scottish clergy; sculpture and painting appeared instruments of idolatry; the surplice was a rag of popery; and every motion or gesture, prescribed by the liturgy, was a step towards that spiritual Babylon, so much the object of their horror and aversion. Every thing was deemed impious, but their own mystical comments on the Scriptures, which they idolized, and whose eastern prophetic style they employed in every common occurrence. (History, Ch. XLVII) Here we see a rather different treatment of sacred rites. Faced with the other extreme-worship stripped of any ceremony at all-Hume was no longer as inclined simply to dismiss "mechanical devotion" as idolatry or superstition, pointless and absurd. He did not advocate these ceremonies, of course, though he seems quite sympathetic to James's</page><page sequence="9">HUME ON IDOLATRY AND INCARNATION 387 efforts toward reform. In any case, writing the history of this troubled age made him sensitive to a new problem, one much more far-reaching in its implications than the mere nonsense of idolatry. He still maintained that a mode of worship dependent on a rational contemplation of the Supreme Being is perhaps the most appropriate to a spiritual idea, but such a rarefied conception is far beyond the capacity of most worshipers. And what happens to these worshipers instead? They withdraw from the world of the senses, from an awareness of this life, and retreat into a state of uncontollable, self-deceiving rapture. This passage reveals Hume's essential objection to religion, as he expounded it later in NHR, partic- ularly to the religion of the enthusiastic Puritans. In its peak of fervor, enthusiasm is the least tolerant form of religion, and, of even greater but related significance, it is the most destructive of civilization. Rational behavior, sociability and politeness, concern for one's fellow creatures, and an enterprising, courageous spirit, are all displaced by the whimsies of solitary man; a chaos of inner passions, and those the most sullen and bitter, threatens to tear apart the outward fabric of society, established by centuries of tradition and gradual progress. A final irony is that their rage against idolatry notwithstanding, these extremists were themselves idolaters-bibliolaters-worshiping in the Old Testament a literature in style and subject least likely, in Hume's eyes, to make them rational or humane. The religion of the fanatics posed a threat to all that Hume regarded as sacred, to use a word which in any other Humean context would be unthinkable. So large did this threat bulk that later in the History Hume moved from ridicule of liturgy to an endorsement of ritual as a means of in- sulating worshipers from the consequences of unchecked spiritual zeal. Hume had earlier made Laud's liturgical excesses into an example of that prelate's own zeal and of the patent folly of superstition itself. When he came to evaluate Laud's place in history, Hume had changed his mind. It is surprising to learn that however sectarian were his motives or misguided his means, it is regrettable that Laud did not succeed in his liturgical reforms. Indeed, quite plainly Hume's first sentence reflects his own changing view: Whatever ridicule, to a philosophic mind, may be thrown on pious ceremonies, it must be confessed, that, during a very religious age, no institutions can be more advantageous to the rude multitude, and tend more to mollify that fierce and gloomy spirit of devotion, to which they are subject. Even the English church, though it had retained a share of popish ceremonies,9 may justly be thought too naked and unadorned, and still to approach too near the abstract 9 Although nearly all of Hume's corrections are stylistic, the wording of the first edition, compared at this point with the corrected version, may suggest a continuing shift in Hume's attitude toward sacred rites from one of antagonism to toleration: the first version's "popish superstition" is mollified into "popish ceremonies," a change consistent with Hume's desire here to recommend rather than condemn these practices.</page><page sequence="10">388 DONALD T. SIEBERT and spiritual religion of the Puritans. Laud and his associates, by reviving a few primitive institutions of this nature, corrected the error of the first reformers, and presented to the affrightened and astonished mind, some sensible exterior observances, which might occupy it during its religious exercises, and abate the violence of its disappointed efforts. The thought, no longer bent on that divine and mysterious essence, so superior to the narrow capacities of mankind, was able, by means of the new model of devotion, to relax itself in the contemplation of pictures, postures, vestments, buildings; and all the fine arts, which minister to religion, thereby received additional encouragement. The primate, it is true, conducted this scheme, not with the enlarged sentiments and cool reflection of a legislator, but with the intemperate zeal of a sectary; and by overlooking the circumstances of the times, served rather to inflame that religious fury which he meant to repress. But this blemish is more to be regarded as a general imputation on the whole age, than any particular failing of Laud's; and it is sufficient for his vindication to observe, that his errors were the most excusable of all those which prevailed during that zealous period. (History, Ch. LVII) Admittedly, Hume is not recommending "pious ceremonies" without qualification, nor championing the Church of England and its primate. Nonetheless, this final assessment of Laud reflects a considerable degree of new sympathy with practices formerly regarded as useless idolatry. For Hume it is a matter of accommodation, of making the best of human weaknesses. As long as mankind is religious-and that seems a disposition well-nigh universal-anything serving as an antidote to the poison of fanaticism is to be promoted. Such an antidote is found in religious ceremony and images, which have the additional advantage of readily engrafting themselves on the high culture of a society. Anything drawing man out of himself and into contact with his fellows or with the objects of this world is beneficial, and curiously for Hume sacred rites came to have that function. This new-found toleration of idolatry seems to have grown out of Hume's experience in writing the history of this peculiar age, one in which the religious principle was at the bottom of so much that went on: "Religion can never be deemed a point of small consequence in civil government: but during this period, it may be regarded as the great spring of men's actions and determinations" (History, Ch. LXI). We see Hume moving from amusement and incredulity at the antics of the Puritans, to genuine concern about the threat to a stable society which such fervor posed. It is this concern, once again, which explains his embracing any exigency, even idolatry, which might oppose this tide of delusion and hypocrisy. And it is well to remind ourselves that to Hume the ultimate consequence of unrestrained enthusiasm is immorality, a refrain heard frequently in the History: Among the generality of men, educated in regular, civilized societies, the sen- timents of shame, duty, honour, have considerable authority, and serve to coun- terbalance and direct the motives derived from private advantage: but, by the predominancy of enthusiasm among the parliamentary forces, these salutary</page><page sequence="11">HUME ON IDOLATRY AND INCARNATION 389 principles lost their credit, and were regarded as mere human inventions, yea moral institutions, fitter for Heathens than for Christians. The saint, resigned over to superior guidance, was at full liberty to gratify all his appetites, disguised under the appearance of pious zeal. And, besides the strange corruptions en- gendered by this spirit, it eluded and loosened all the ties of morality, and gave entire scope, and even sanction, to the selfishness and ambition which naturally adhere to the human mind. (History, Ch. LIX) The mockery of the biblical idiom-"mere human inventions, yea moral institutions"-reveals how much Hume had come to detest the canting Puritans, whose values gave the lie to everything he held dear. So much so, that we likewise see a shift in Hume's attitude toward the extremes of enthusiasm and superstition-that is, formless Protestant fundamentalism and form-bound, tradition-centered Roman Catholicism. Before writing his History, Hume had treated this dichotomy of Christian practice in his essay "Of Enthusiasm and Superstition," part of Essays, Moral and Political (1741). There Hume severely blames both extremes, but not to the same degree. He condemns Roman Catholicism without qualification because it ultimately enslaves mankind. And it is significant that among the causes of Catholic timorousness and melancholy, Hume lists "ceremonies, observances, mortifications, sacrifices, presents, or... any practice, however absurd or frivolous, which either folly or knavery recommends to a blind and terrified credulity" (Works, III, 145). On the other hand, Hume at least accords the enthusiasts or independent Prot- estants a kind of backhand praise: being marked by a spirit of liberty, their zeal finally levels out into an attitude of moderation and toleration, once the fury of enthusiasm has spent itself; because their religion is formless and independent, they soon cool off and become indifferent to anything save the common affairs of life (Works, III, 148-50). Hume repeats this characterization in the History, when he contrasts the more tolerant Independents with the more inflexible Presbyterians, who retain more forms and dogma and are thus less capricious, willy-nilly zealots than their Puritan brethren the Independents (History, Ch. LVII). By the time he had taken his account up to the Restoration, however, Hume had had ample opportunity to see how tolerating and moderate the Independents were, and by then he was in no mood to damn them with even the faintest of praise. If, according to his theory, they would finally subside into toleration, indifference, and worldliness, history showed no evidence thus far; on the contrary, it showed what pernicious mischief they could work in the meantime. Thus the neat antithesis "Of Enthu- siasm and Superstition," which implicitly favors enthusiasm, had dis- appeared by the end of the Commonwealth years in Hume's History. It is no longer weak, fearful, melancholy, and ignorant devotees of super- stition versus hopeful, proud, presumptuous, warmly imaginative, and ignorant fanatics (Works, III, 145). Both extremes are absurd, oftentimes</page><page sequence="12">390 DONALD T. SIEBERT dangerous, and those qualities like hope and pride which favor the en- thusiasts in any Humean catalogue of virtues are now given only the most unflattering interpretation. Likewise, the superstitious are no longer much blamed for their ceremonies. By this point in the History, and later in NHR, superstition is less objectionable than enthusiasm. We note that this remarkable shift in Hume's views is from the theoretical formulation which derives mainly from the Treatise to judg- ments elicited by the facts of history. The theoretical Hume makes little allowance for religious worship of any kind, but least of all for the "mechanical devotion" manufactured out of ceremonies and icons, out of superstition and idolatry. Those who practice it most, like the Roman Catholics, are most blamed. As Hume pronounces bluntly in the Treatise, "The Roman Catholicks are certainly the most zealous of any sect in the christian world ..." (T, 115). The historical Hume, on the other hand, perceives the dangers to civilization proceeding from a warm, unstable, uncontrolled imagination-the solipsistic zeal of fanatical Protestant- ism-and he shifts his ground. Enthusiasts are now most blamed, and those who observe superstitious forms are perhaps less to be feared. Formerly, idolatrous worship was absurd, distracting, and therefore use- less; now idolatrous worship is merely absurd, but distracting and there- fore useful. It is a change of some moment. The implications of this change in NHR need to be explored next. It is first necessary to consider where Hume's thesis leads. I have indicated above that his essential objection to religion is a moral one: piety is in far too many cases no high recommendation of a person's character; indeed from an appearance of piety we may infer hypocrisy or self-deception at least, and perhaps some form of cruelty or knavery. No radical cure for man's religious bent is available. The moral philos- opher instead attempts to treat religious mania by encouraging a certain temper of mind. If this mania thrives on introspection, fear, and gloom, then the opposite state of mind should prove resistant to the mania. Perhaps the most important constructive passage in NHR occurs at the end of Section XIV: "Whatever weakens or disorders the internal frame promotes the interests of superstition [by this point in Hume's thought, "superstition" denotes all of the more zealous commitments to religious principles, including "enthusiasm"]: And nothing is more destructive to them than a manly steddy [sic] virtue, which either preserves us from disastrous, melancholy accidents, or teaches us to bear them. During such calm sunshine of the mind, these spectres of false divinity never make their appearance" (NHR, 91). Some may object that Hume's observation is valid enough on its own terms, but beside the point. One cannot will the "calm sunshine of the mind" any more than one can decide to be happy and thereby let the sunshine in. And, as I remarked earlier, such salvation appears designed for men who are already like Hume, in any case. However, is it possible</page><page sequence="13">HUME ON IDOLATRY AND INCARNATION 391 to cultivate those dispositions in all people which tend toward equanimity, a state of mind in which the world is accepted as it is? Hume saw that people have a natural tendency to believe in a spiritual order; they also have a tendency to connect or unite invisible power with visible object, to seek an incarnation of the spiritual order as it might be termed. The hold of the spiritual thus becomes much stronger, for it is now part of the world of fact and experience. The two are conjoined; indeed with many people, the two are one. The problem that emerges is an interesting one. For Hume there are two conflicting considerations. (1) Religious belief may be, probably will be, reinforced by this incarnation, and Hume certainly insists that even the highest forms of theism draw strength from the constant reference to an imaged or incarnate deity: Men "fluctuate betwixt these opposite sentiments. The same infirmity still drags them downwards, from an omnipotent and spiritual deity to a limited and corporeal one, and from a corporeal and limited to a statue or visible representation. The same endeavour at elevation still pushes them up- wards, from the statue or material image to the invisible power; and from the invisible power to an infinitely perfect deity, the creator and sovereign of the universe" (NHR, 58). (2) On the other hand, in the History when Hume appeared to commend Laud's return to ceremony, visible signs did draw people like the mad enthusiasts out of their theogenic reveries. Hume's remark in NHR that the Jews and Mahometans have banished "all the arts of statuary and painting ... lest the common infirmity of mankind should thence produce idolatry" (NHR, 58) may lead us to infer his approval, but he cannot have favored what was for him the fanatical spirit of those religions nor finally have opposed idolatry, within certain limits. Hume's implicit endorsement of pagan idolatry is based, I shall argue below, on the light hold which that religion had on the lives of the ancients, and on the energy and hope which grew out of Greek mythology, the offspring of a polyphiloprogenitive Zeus. How so? Hume claimed that men do not really believe in the ab- surdities of religious fables and dogma. They may try, but "nature is too hard for all their endeavours, and suffers not the obscure, glimmering light, afforded in those shadowy regions, to equal the strong impressions, made by common sense and by experience" (NHR, 74). But therein lies the difference between the two theisms, between the casually evolved, unsystematic, mythological religions and the scriptural, systematic, scho- lastic modern forms. The latter place the believer in an awkward position, straitjacketed by codified dogma, which happens to be even more absurd (said Hume) than the pagan, and thus tormented by doubt and guilt (NHR, sections XII-XIII). The monotheist cannot enjoy confident se- renity, that quality sine qua non to Humean virtue. His primitive cousin the pagan, on the other hand, wears a much looser, more comfortably fitting religious mantle. Hume in fact repeatedly uses such a metaphor:</page><page sequence="14">392 DONALD T. SIEBERT pagan religion "hung loose upon the minds of men" (NHR, 80).1? It follows that the ancient is happier, for the many fables of his religion, being at least plausible and certainly entertaining, do not make many demands on him or oppress him with guilt; he is freer to make the most of this life. One concludes that Hume does not object to the spirit becoming flesh, as long as it is the flesh of a worldly Jupiter and not of an unworldly Jesus. For that matter, whether frolicking on earth or disporting himself on Olympus, Jove remains very human, quite in contrast to Jehovah, who is often very mysterious and unapproachable. And what are the consequences of taking either conception of the Deity seriously? The entire history of persecution, including the seventeenth century in Eng- land, shows unmistakably what happens when a somewhat more so- phisticated type of incarnation is taken seriously, when the spirit is believed to illuminate the individual will. By contrast, the other sort of incarnation has a strikingly different complexion. The ancient mythology, to Hume, is inherently comical and absurd, and yet it makes for pleasant stories and even great art. It is vivifying and occasionally exemplary. We are hardly apt to give it much credence, but if we did, our mood would be happy and our behavior hedonistic at worst: ... the fables of the pagan religion were, of themselves, light, easy, and familiar; without devils or seas of brimstone, or any objects, that could much terrify the imagination. Who could forbear smiling, when he thought of the loves of Mars and Venus, or the amorous frolics of Jupiter and Pan? In this respect, it was a true poetical religion; if it had not rather too much levity for the graver kinds of poetry. We find that it has been adopted by modem bards; nor have these talked with greater freedom and irreverence of the gods, whom they regarded as fictions, than the antients did of the real objects of their devotion. (NHR, 75) Hume laughs at the reason why the Amphitrion of Aristophanes was staged at Rome: "The Romans supposed, that, like all old letchers, [Jupiter] would be highly pleased with the rehearsal of his former feats of activity and vigour, and that no topic was so proper, upon which to flatter his pride and his vanity" (NHR, 41). But how pleasant a repre- sentation, and how little calculated to excite superstitious forebodings! Hume keeps the "pious Alexander" in his place by mordant irony: "One great incitement to the pious Alexander in his warlike expeditions was his rivalship of Hercules and Bacchus, whom he justly pretended to have excelled" (NHR, 63). But the point, notwithstanding Hume's superior vantage, is that this "pious" emulation did contribute to human enterprise o1 Two paragraphs earlier Hume wrote, "... superstition sate so easy and light upon them" (NHR, 78), and at the very end of this section he used the same figure: mythology "sits also so easy and light on men's minds ..." (NHR, 81).</page><page sequence="15">HUME ON IDOLATRY AND INCARNATION 393 (as well as to drunkenness, but what of that?) Hume's title for this section is [A comparison of polytheism and theism] "With regard to courage or abasement,"' and there is no mistaking his celebration of the courage engendered by polytheism-that is, pagan idolatry. Despite his claim that men never in fact believe in a spiritual reality, so powerful are the "impressions, made by common sense and by ex- perience" (NHR, 74), Hume seemed to fear the possibility that religious preoccupations could supplant the reality of nature, unless men were constantly succored by contact with the external world. He did not mind the worship of an idol, as long as the idol remained more of a thing or object than an incarnation. If, to use Hume's phrasing, "profane reason" were to have any chance of defeating "sacred mystery" (NHR, 66), it would have to employ the weapon implied by the epithet "profane": it would have to commit sacrilege upon the sacred object, divesting the icon of its mysterious association and reaffirming instead its material reality. This is the intention behind much of Hume's rather crude raillery. The Egyptians worship cats-but only grown cats: they "drown the holy spawn or little sucking gods, without any scruple or remorse" because common sense dictates that "a couple of cats, in fifty years, would stock a whole kingdom" and "entirely starve the men" (NHR, 72). So much for feline incarnation. Even the more specious doctrine of transubstan- tiation, supported by all the learning of the Church of Rome, receives a similar jolt from everyday reality. In one of the "pleasant stories" mocking the real presence, Hume tells of a counter falling by accident among the holy wafers. The unfortunate communicant receiving this hard object exclaims at last to the priest: "I wish ... you have not committed some mistake: I wish you have not given me God the Father: He is so hard and tough there is no swallowing him" (NHR, 67).12 Confronted with such a real presence, there is indeed no swallowing any religious doctrine. Such is the effect of the numerous anecdotes interwoven into Hume's text. Thus subtly Hume fights religion on its own ground. His treatment of holy objects tends to reverse the sacramental precedence of invisible and spiritual over visible and material. Sensation is first, and the order of reality it suggests displaces the nebulous witchings of imagination. Is the image just an object or an incarnation of the spirit? With Hume the spiritual dimension was a threat, and it can never gain an ascendent over the imagination when one focuses on the physical properties of the object: " The section-titles do not appear in the first edition (Four Dissertations, 1757). Hume added them to "help the Reader to see the Scope of the Discourse," hoping to answer an objection to NHR "that it wants order" (HL, I, 250-51). 12 Hume next relates another blasphemous story concerning a converted Turk who so confuses his catechism that he concludes there is no God because yesterday he ate him during the Eucharist (NHR, 67-68).</page><page sequence="16">394 DONALD T. SIEBERT it is a shape fashioned from oak; it is made of cold, white, heavy marble.'3 Hume tolerated paganism because its gods were so palpably real, objects of human contrivance first and foremost, incapable of suggesting any large and mysterious spirit; and when they represented anything beyond themselves, it was usually something familiar-the sun or the moon, or deities with enough human frailty and passion to make them our distant relatives. To be sure, Hume found the ethics of paganism congenial, but that happy influence on man was, after all, a result of mythology's palpable incarnations. Though NHR is more pessimistic than the second Enquiry, Hume still believed that men can be basically moral if religion does not assume too much importance in their lives, and it never can when men are not seduced from believing in the primacy of mundane fact and experience. Hume seemed to recognize that man needs to invest objects with signif- icance, that he is a contriver of symbols, a Vates or Maker. The recog- nition of this fact in NHR, as it probably is in most of Hume's philosophy, is grudging and somewhat disapproving. But it exists nonetheless. Hume's many references to the poets-Homer, Hesiod, Sophocles, Euripides, Milton, to name only the more sublime-confirm this impression. The poets tell idle stories, it is true, but in so doing they can also demonstrate the extent of human capacity in this life, the resilience and resourcefulness of man the civilized animal.'4 The subject of art is not unrelated to the subject of religious images. It is not incidental that along with NHR, the 13 Kemp Smith regards this insistence on the literalness or concreteness of images in the thought process as one of the "chief defects in Hume's teaching in Book I of the Treatise," namely, "his professed denial of abstract ideas, and his consequent not infre- quent assumption that all intellectual processes have to be carried on in terms of images which are in all respects as specific and detailed as the happenings they recall." See Kemp Smith's The Philosophy of David Hume (London, 1949), 427-48. Whether or not it is a defect, this tendency in Hume's thought does support the argument that Hume considered concrete referents as essential to ratiocination and conceivably, then, as an- tidotes to theogenic fantasy. Thus consider, for example, this confident assertion in the Treatise: "A person, who desires us to consider the figure of a globe of white marble without thinking on its colour desires an impossibility ..." (T, 25); or this statement in the first Enquiry: "An extension, that is neither tangible nor visible, cannot possibly be conceived; and a tangible or visible extension, which is neither hard nor soft, black nor white, is equally beyond the reach of human conception" (Enquiries, 154-55). 14 No philosopher ready to banish the poets from the republic would remark in a footnote (and by the way, in Hume the footnotes often contain his most intriguing material): "The following lines of Euripides are so much to the present purpose that I cannot forbear quoting them: ... [and I cannot forbear quoting his translation, though Hume also gives the Greek first] There is nothing secure in the world; no glory, no prosperity. The gods toss all life into confusion; mix every thing with its reverse; that all of us, from our ignorance and uncertainty, may pay them the more worship and reverence" (NHR, 35n). The citation supports Hume's attack on religion, but it also underlines that sense of human frailty and helplessness which Hume actually pitied-what we might call the "poetical" dimension of NHR.</page><page sequence="17">HUME ON IDOLATRY AND INCARNATION 395 leading work in the Four Dissertations of 1757, two of the others, Of Tragedy and Of the Standard of Taste, concern art and its religious uses. Of Tragedy seeks to explain how a representation of human suffering can please. We need not follow the details of Hume's explanation here,15 but we should note that underlying Hume's reasoning is an assumption about art perfectly consonant with Hume's ideas about images. Tragic art pleases because it demonstrates man's ability to shape his suffering and thereby control it; he emerges a victor, not a victim. The emphasis is always to be on this life, not on an afterlife. For Hume tragic art must display man in an active role, wresting a kind of triumph from defeat, exhibiting "a noble courageous despair." The most pernicious art, on the other hand, panders to gloom and weakness, to otherworldly values, by showing only "passive suffering" in "such horrible subjects as crucifixions and martyrdoms" (Works, III, 265). That religion should foster this corrupting art comes as no surprise to a reader of NHR. The last dissertation is Of the Standard of Taste. For Hume taste was not just a metaphor. We taste art or we taste morality just as we taste food. It is interesting and significant that Hume would place so much emphasis on the objective reality of what taste discovers. In other words, this esthetic and moral faculty does not rely on inspiration from without-or from within, as in the case of a fanatical imagination-but detects only the secondary qualities of objects. Hume tells the story of Sancho's two kinsmen in Don Quixote who respectively tasted leather and iron in their wine; though ridiculed by their companions, they had their good taste confirmed by the discovery of a key attached to a leather thong in the hogshead (Works, III, 272-73). It is a real presence, we are tempted to think, but the wine's essence is altered by a very sensible and ordinary phenomenon. (I would suggest that Hume may be implying that taste would always belie the miracle of the consecrated wine.) Taste depends upon a clear understanding, experience, freedom from prejudice, but all these advantages derive from an accurate sensation of external reality. Few will have good taste, but those few will be capable of judging correctly, whether of wine, art, or morality. Hume simply left no room for the vagaries of a superstitious imagination.16 To an important extent, then, The Natural History of Religion and much of Hume's later work concern the nature of incarnate symbols. What are the implications of fusing outward and visible signs with in- visible, spiritual power? How strong is our belief in such incarnation, 15 A superb analysis is that of Ralph Cohen, "The Transformation of Passion: A Study of Hume's Theories of Tragedy," Philological Quarterly, 41 (1962), 450-64; and "The Rationale of Hume's Literary Inquiries," a contribution to David Hume: Many- Sided Genius, 97-115. 16 As with Of Tragedy, Of the Standard of Taste ends with a warning about how a corrupt taste, nurtured by religious zeal, can vitiate and disfigure art (Works, III, 283- 84).</page><page sequence="18">396 DONALD T. SIEBERT and what is its power for good or ill? How are the images of religion and art intertwined? I have argued that Hume came to appreciate how extensive and deep-seated is man's belief in this incarnation, and Hume concluded that such belief is not necessarily pernicious, if tempered and restrained by the precedence of object over spirit-rather more of the outward and visible sign than of the inward and spiritual grace. He may have begun with a skeptical rejection of any spiritual order and especially of the foolish idolatry, indeed the abject superstition, which faith in such an order often breeds. Hume saw, however, that skepticism is not for most men, and that even arrant idolatry, object-centered and buttressed by the world of sensation, is far more productive of happiness and stability in human civilization than the idle fantasies of a solitary imagination.'7 University of South Carolina. 17 In Hume's later Tudor (1759) and medieval (1762) volumes of the History, one will find no strong condemnation of idolatry per se. Certainly the enlightened Hume had little sympathy with anything medieval, most of all, the medieval Church; but he blamed the Church mainly for priestcraft and the reliance on terrifying mystery. Indeed, at one point he came close to defending the Catholics against Protestant ridicule: "Protestant historians mention ... with great triumph [various absurd relics]. But such fooleries, as they are to be found in all ages and nations, and even took place during the most refined periods of antiquity, form no particular or violent reproach to the Catholic religion" (History, Ch. XXXI).</page></plain_text>
