Epiphany: epiphany is the limit of the body, or that which has length and width only, but not depth; and it is spoken of in regard to concept and in regard to existence. But epiphany also is the incarnate dispensation of our Savior Jesus Christ. Suda 2739, v. 3, p. 391.13 Adler I. Introduction Epiphany is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as 1) "The festival commemorating the manifestation of Christ to the Gentiles in the persons of the Magi" and 2) "A manifestation or appearance of some divine or superhuman being." Many centuries ago, however, the Byzantine lexicographer of the Suda thought otherwise. His definition of the Christian sense, given as a second entry, was similar to the first entry of OED— though much more accurate, since it was not restricted to the Western (Roman Catholic) understanding—but he had nothing to say about manifestations or appearances of "pagan" deities. Instead, he gave the word its literal sense: "limit of a body, or in other words, what has length and</page><page sequence="2">228 Marinatos and Kyrtatas breadth only but not depth." By examining the relevant sources modern enquirers often get a similar impression. Much of what was written or artistically depicted refers to divine appearances, but without conveying a clear sense of a living experience. When Rudolf Pfister treated the phenomenon of epiphany in antiquity in an article in the Real-Encyclopädie (1950) he collected an astonishing amount of evidence. It is, however, practically impossible for the reader to navigate through the labyrinth of information provided by the German scholar, for it is hard to define epiphany as a phenomenon of religious contemplation, and even harder to give an account of it as an experience in antiquity. The word "epiphaneia" was not in fact often used by the Greeks. Although it implies vision, it does not only refer to clear images of the divine, but also to miracles, salvation, and natural phenomena as well as apparitions in dreams and dream-like situations. In Hellenistic times the epithet 'Epiphanes' took a specific political meaning referring to the rulers as saviors: the first to use it was the king of Syria Antiochus IV (175-164 B.C.E.). Christian connotations have made the meaning of the word "epiphany" even more problematic. Starting with Paul the Apostle some radical re definitions were attempted by early Christian writers; at the same time the early Christian church was seeking an appropriate narrative for the festival of Epiphany, which made the discussion part of its dogmatic controversies. Just how early and how important the idea became in Christian circles may be seen by the fact that already in the middle of the second century we come across the Christian name Epiphanes, which took the form Epiphänius in later years.1 This volume does not attempt a novel definition of "epiphany." Instead it explores the typology and circumstances under which gods were thought to appear in the ancient Mediterranean world, primarily among Greeks, Romans, and Christians. The essays exemplify the variety of analytical tools and methods available to modern scholars. It is hoped that through its multifaceted approaches, it will, in the end, give readers an idea of where future research can take us with the idea of divine epiphany. II. Voluntary Invocations versus Spontaneous Appearance of Deities One important question implicit in several papers is who controls the epiphany. There are two possibilities: Either the deities choose to appear by 1 The first known Epiphanes was a Christian leader with gnostic tendencies. Of him it was said that after his death he was divinized in his native island of Cephalonia and that he received honors on the first day of every month. Clem. Alex., Strom. 3.2.5-9.</page><page sequence="3">Conclusions 229 themselves or they appear when invoked by humans (ep ikies is). In the Greek and Roman literary tradition, confirmed also by inscriptions, gods were thought to appear mostly because they so decided. Not unexpectedly, they commonly chose to interfere in times of crisis in order to help their proteges, and also to request the establishment of their cult. It is often the case that crisis and cult go together: the cult is established subsequent to a crisis: the Athenians, for example, started worshipping Pan after the successful battle of Marathon. The second alternative is for humans to invoke a god or a hero, particularly in battles or other emergencies. Although the outcome could not be guaranteed, cases of unsuccessful invocation were rarely recorded. We are given a few hints about invocation procedures. The Minoan evidence (derived exclusively from the study of gold rings) suggests that summoning the gods was a deliberate, "programmed" action, involving the shaking of a tree and occurring at a specific location (Marinatos). The Greeks and Romans attempted to achieve similar results using other devices. Although no apparitions were guaranteed during sacrifice, there was always the possibility of visual fantasy crystallized in artistic representations, such as the votive reliefs discussed by Bravo. The art makes up for the lack of factual verification. Dreaming involved both the invocation of a god as well as a voluntary manifestation of a divinity. Quite often gods were thought to appear to dreamers when they chose so themselves to warn them of imminent danger, to announce an event or demand the establishment of a cult. It was also thought, however, that humans could provoke the dream, if they went to sleep at specific locations, under certain circumstances. This phenomenon is attested in most religions of the ancient world. In Assyrian texts there is mention of professional priest-dreamers, called shabru. The priests slept at sacred places and received divine messages. In the Hebrew Bible dreamers are a special class of diviners (cf. Deut. 13). In the Greek sanctuary of Asclepius at Epidaurus there was a dreaming place, the abaton, where patients could dream of the god and be cured (ey/cot/i^aic); the dream could be commemorated in narratives and images (Bravo). III. The Intangible Appearance of Gods The presence of gods was suggested not only by visions, but by many other types of signs. The faithful saw birds, meteorites or other "signs" of nature (Burkert). Star epiphanies have a long tradition common to the Near East, Greece and Rome (e.g. Hymn. Horn. 3. 441). In the New Testament, the birth of Jesus was said to have been attended by a special star (Matt 2:2). Apparently Manilius, too, saw the stars as divine epiphanies: this is an</page><page sequence="4">230 Marinatos and Kyrtatas instance where the "sign" is in itself a divine manifestation to the learned (MacGregor), as in Dio Chrysostom (Betz); so also, the text itself is a self referential divine manifestation (Thomassen). Divine presence could be also sensed through smell. We witness this phenomenon in several texts, for example the Homeric Hymn to Demeter (2. 275) or Paul's account of an olfactory experience (Mitchell). Gods were sometimes thought to appear surrounded by bright light. The experience of light was apparently reproduced in actual ritual. The cult statues of divinities were illuminated during the Eleusinian mysteries (Clinton). On votive reliefs of the Classical period heroes were painted white; this was an artistic convention to indicate that they emanated light (Bravo). Fire could likewise be a sign of epiphany (Burkert). Anthropomorphic apparitions do not necessarily imply that visions of deities were thought to be more than signs. They too had an indefinable quality about them. The Greek word phasma, used sometimes as an alternative to "epiphany," captures the fleeting quality of what the worshipper was supposed to have seen (both words epiphany and phasma share a root with phainomai: appear). We have no way of knowing what it was that people were thought to see, but the choice of vocabulary suggests the very two-dimensionality that the Byzantine lexicographer of the Suda associated with epiphany. Incorporeal images were subjective and seldom verifiable. It is perhaps for this reason that Euripides in his Bacchae uses two alternative verbs for cognition of the divine: to see (õpä, 500) and to know (yvcjoetai Aiõvuaov, 859-60). It may be confusing that gods sometimes took two forms simultaneously. On a relief from Oropus, dedicated to Amphiaraus, the hero is shown as both a snake and an anthropomorphic divinity (Bravo). Athena in the Odyssey changes her appearance from a young man to a woman, crossing over the boundaries of gender (3. 222). In the Iliad Apollo takes the form of a hawk (15. 237) when he spots Hector lying dejected on the ground. Hector recognizes his divine nature and asks him which god he is. But the poet does not feel it necessary to explain whether Apollo looked like a man or a bird when he spoke to his protege. Divine polymorphism was not unique to the Greeks: we meet it in most religions of the Eastern Mediterranean. Since many epiphanies were signs (semeia), they defied verification and depended on subjective interpretation (Graf). Odysseus and Telemachus were never sure that they recognized the divinity of Athena. Furthermore, the lack of recognition left humans insecure because they could be deceived. In Euripides' Bacchae the plot revolves around the very fact that Pentheus does not recognize Dionysus except when he is delirious. Another level of difficulty is that the true form of the gods could not be known: the poet of the Odyssey stipulates that gods do not appear clearly to all people:</page><page sequence="5">Conclusions 231 oü yap 1TWC iravteooi. 0€ol 4&gt;aivovT&lt;u evapyelg (16. 161 see also Hymn. Horn. 2. 111). In the Iliad, Athena must sweep away the mist from the Diomedes' eyes so that he may know the gods (5. 127-28). The Greeks suspected that divine form was not easily grasped and that anthropomorphism was too simplistic. Dramatic poets refer to Zeus as a powerful force but one difficult to conceive. "Zeus whoever he might be," says the chorus in Aeschylus' Agamemnon 160. It was often underlined that if they beheld the gods in their true divine form, humans would be damaged or could even die. Hera says in the Iliad that the true form of the gods is something terrible (xodeirol õe 0eol (jxxiveoGca evapyeli; 20. 131). When Zeus appeared to Semele in his true form, namely the thunderbolt, she is burned (Eur., Bacch. 6). In the Hebrew Bible Yahweh first appears to Moses as a burning bush. Later he tells Moses: "For no man can see me and live" (Exod 33:20, NASB). A consequence of the fluidity surrounding the experience of divine presence may be scepticism. Xenophon expresses himself with caution about the mysterious events that took place before the battle of Leuctra and calls them technasmata (Bravo). The skeptic would even deny the reality of god as represented in his/her cult image. Lucian records the miracles of Alexander as fraud (Dickie). The problem was raised by Dio of Prussa: How could a cult statue really embody the divinity? In a fictitious dialogue, Pheidias supposedly replied with a defense of his art. His reply elucidates philosophical problems of the theory of art and how it relates to divinity in the late Roman period (Betz). IV. Collective Epiphanies and Ritual Performances Natural phenomena (which are often interpreted as epiphanies) can serve to validate collective epiphanies because there is no problem with verification (Graf). There is another alternative. Priests (or magicians) stage carefully orchestrated performances that involve the impersonation of a god or goddess. There are many examples of divine impersonation rituals (Burkert). An important role is played by the cult image, which could be animated at special times and places. For the Eleusinian mysteries, Clinton reconstructs a cult drama. In early Christianity, the epiphany recorded by all four Gospels was reenacted ritually after a period of fasting, a long night of contemplation and a solemnly arranged collective baptism the following morning (Kyrtatas). The codification of the official festival and its connection with the Gospel narratives was far from simple. Ritual and narrative were related, but did not clearly determine one another.</page><page sequence="6">232 Marinatos and Kyrtatas V. How the Ritual Pattern of Epiphany is Reflected in Literary Narratives Divine presence and interference in human affairs is a widely-spread motif in literature; interestingly enough the structure of the narrative reflects patterns similar to those of ritual. It may be argued that the Odyssey is structured on the pattern of epiphany reaching a high point when Odysseus is recognized by his son. In fact, Odysseus is transformed as though he were a god (Bierl). Dickie uses a different method in his analysis of epiphanies in literature. He shows that human reactions to encounters with the divine consist of programmatic and predictable actions: proskynesis, makarismos, sacrifice. They draw upon ritual but ritual is reworked as a literary pattern. Texts can in themselves mediate an epiphany through words. For Thomassen Gnostic revelation dialogues are self-referential: the text is its own revelation, the medium is the message. The Christian scriptures may likewise be analyzed as making use of the ritual of epiphany to redefine literary form. Mitchell discusses Paul's epiphanic language as a novel way of thinking about Jesus and his relationship to Paul himself. VI. Epiphanies in Art The use of art in epiphanies is discussed only briefly in this volume (Betz, Clinton, Bravo, Marinatos). The role of images as vehicles for communicating epiphany should in no way be underestimated, however. By including the viewer in the experience, images are themselves "signs" of epiphanic vision. There are two options: either the viewer sees what other humans see in the picture (in which case the viewer of the picture identifies with the witness of the epiphany in the picture) or the spectator becomes privy to an extraordinary and personal experience. Much Christian art works this way. On the Minoan rings, the epiphany is mediated through prophets shaking the tree or sleeping on a stone (Marinatos). VII. The Experience of Seeing or Feeling the Presence of (a) God Encounters between humans and gods in Greek and Roman antiquity were not as rare as we moderns often think. As the papers collected in this volume amply testify on the basis of material ranging from Minoan rings to Lucian, the idea of a god or gods dwelling for brief periods among humans or making passing appearances was common. It is attested in both literature and art. The fact that the word "epiphany" was rarely employed shows that</page><page sequence="7">Conclusions 233 no specialized term was needed. The phenomenon was part of a shared culture and, therefore, anticipated and widely accepted. What we would like to know is how often the incidents reported or depicted represent experiences, as opposed to being common topoi serving literary, artistic or, more broadly, cultural and propagandistic purposes. In other words: did people ever believe that they had been personally affected by a divine presence? We seem to get very close to personal experience in the world of early Christianity, particularly since snippets of information come to us indirectly and, in passing, references to the baptism of certain individuals (Kyrtatas). The employment of certain generic Christian literary conventions also seems to presuppose human feeling aroused by mystical revelations to concerned readers (Thomassen). Despite his aggressive attack on what he took to be a faked epiphany, Lucian would have us believe that a multitude of observers sincerely believed that they had been privileged to witness the appearance of a god (Dickie). But as we move backwards in time and look at the evidence, concrete circumstances emerge as defining the occasion: it was mostly through ritualized feasts, including the so-called mysteries, that humans occasionally came close to something we could reasonably call mystical or epiphanic experience. In most cases rituals were (as they still are) collective rather than individual, organized rather than spontaneous, normal rather than supernatural procedures (Clinton). But genuine feelings can clearly emerge even in collective ceremonial feasts. Lucian's story of Alexander, although presented as a calculated and unique incident, ought perhaps to be seen as part of a well-known and common ritual. And since many early Christian experiences were connected to baptism for which initiates were being prepared over a long period of time, we seem to be dealing with ritualized situations in many of the Christian cases as well. The idea that epiphanies could be anticipated, organized, and even provoked contrasts with our own modern understanding of divine appearances as singular supernatural events, which seems to have been shaped under the influence of fully developed Christianity. Jesus Christ as son of God and God himself is understood by Christians as having appeared on earth at a particular time and place and within a specific historical context. He is also expected by Christians to reappear in his Second Coming, which will occur at the end of time. In both cases his epiphanies are understood as turning-points changing the course of history. Trying to read Greek and Roman culture in the light of Christianity can be very misleading. The Greeks and Romans never came close to such an understanding of divine epiphanies. And even Christians only gradually formulated their ideas to make them conform to their doctrinal concerns.</page><page sequence="8">234 Marinatos and Kyrtatas The New Testament authors had very vague and sometimes inconsistent views about divine manifestations. They were actually quite at home with the customary views of their pagan and Jewish contemporaries. The lexicographer of the Suda cited at the beginning of this chapter was not, after all, giving two completely unrelated definitions. Epiphaneia means appearance and manifestation: both material objects and divine beings are or become present to onlookers. The basic difference is that a material object, although not visible at all times, is normally in its place to be seen, whereas a divine being must first take a tangible form, human or other, in order to become visible. But both material objects and divine beings obviously have dimensions other than those conveyed to the spectator. Through experience people know that material objects have depth and other qualities besides a surface, i.e. length and breadth. Through ritual and myth human beings were given an idea of the other dimensions or properties of Gods, in essence their power. The papers collected in this volume should remind us that among Greeks and Romans "epiphany," as a concept, remained ambiguous and difficult to define precisely because it was never explicitly clarified by a well worked-out set of dogmas. Greeks, Romans and the early Christians provided through ritual and myth the essentials of an experience, allowing it to remain (as experience often is) elusive and vague.
