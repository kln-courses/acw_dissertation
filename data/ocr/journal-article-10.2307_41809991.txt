<plain_text><page sequence="1">BLACK BODY RETURNED A Response to George Lewis's talk "In Search of Ben Patterson: An Improvised Journey'7 by Francesca T. Royster As we've been thinking about translation so far at this conference, we touched on some powerful issues, including the translation of the artist's desires as it meets its subject and with that, the work of the critic as product of that alliance of desires. As Brent Hayes Edwards has reminded us: "mutual interest lies in mutual translation." This weekend, we continue to ask, "How do the objects of our inquiry translate us? Undo us? And how can the desires and questions that they arouse tell us how they operate?" These questions bring up not only how we are interested in the objects we study but also how the objects are interested in us. How might our inquiry into them reveal the ways that our objects of inquiry are seeking us out through their rhetorical and performative strategies, their modes of operation? For example, when last night during Dawn Lundy Martin's poetry reading, Charles Rowell revealed that he was haunted by Dawn's breaths between her language, that mutual interest then opened up the space for Dawn to talk about the opera- tion of her language in revealing trauma, how trauma affects language generally. We also get this sense of that mutual cycle of interest in the title of George Lewis's talk, "In Search of Benjamin Patterson" - this sense of a subject who is waiting to be asked, whose art, in fact, is meant as a catalyst for inquiry, for translation. Yet this meeting of desires is tricky. George warns us: "after you hear music, it's gone in the air. You can never capture it again." If we think of George's title as a real life or projected conversation with Ben Patterson, it brings us to a line of inquiry that would seem, in some ways, to be guided by the personal, the intimate, conjuring up the close relationship between dedicated scholar and elusive and / or neglected subject. (And as I write this, I'm looking at - and lifting - George Lewis's hefty, lovingly detailed volume, A Power Stronger than Itself, testimony to the power of the mutual haunting of subject and object of inquiry, and to his dedication to unearthing the details of his subjects.) On a very basic level, George Lewis's paper asks us to include and make visible Ben Patterson's body as a particular body among other bodies - as part of a movement. In that spirit of the personal, George's essay takes us to issues of identity and representation, including the erasure of Patterson from the canon of Fluxus performers, and more widely, the erasure of black participation in Fluxus, despite the fact that the Fluxus movement was born in the context of the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the Vietnam War, and, as George says, the black avant garde in jazz, including the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians. Yet in some ways, the work of Fluxus resists reading as a fully transparent response to social justice struggles and particularized issues of identity. This is reflected in art historian David T. Doris's assessment of the movement: Callaloo 35.4 (2012) 1015-1018</page><page sequence="2">CALLALOO Fluxus took the position of a sort of aesthetic Everyman, doing many small things in many small ways. . . . Fluxus challenged notions of representation, offering instead simple presentations that could provoke awe, laughter, disgust, dread - the entire range of human response. In the midst of an increasingly mediated world, the artists of Fluxus attempted to wake up to the experience of simply being human, a strange enterprise indeed. (Doris 92) In its interest in "the human" and in the interrelation of the body and object as "pure," opened up as sensation, there seems to be a weighting in this language toward the "strange" but translatable experiences of bodies in space. So one of my questions is what do we do with the Black body in Fluxus and in Patterson's work, especially as we recognize the intimate relation between subject and object of inquiry, as we recognize the ways that black bodies, names, and histories are erased from the generalizable histories about Fluxus (and much of art history as a whole), and even as we think about the embodied nature of Fluxus' s conception of the Event? Here's what Yoko Ono had to say about the Event, in a 1966 lecture at Wesley an University: It is not a get togetherness as most happenings are, but a dealing with oneself. . . . After unblocking one's mind, by dispensing with visual, auditory and kinetic perception, what will come out of us? My pieces are mostly spent in wonderment. We never experience things separately, but if that is so, it is all the more reason and challenge to create a sensory experience isolated from other sensory experiences, which is something rare in daily life. (qtd. in Lippard 13) How might we think of this desire to create a sensory experience separate from the sensory experiences of others as a kind of utopia? A challenge to history? Memory? Social location? Surely Patterson's score for "Licking Piece" might be seen as a provocation to "forget" the history of blackness and masculinity in order to remember it: Cover shapely female with whipped cream lick topping of chopped nuts and cherries is optional In a 1964 photo of Patterson and others at this event, of Patterson caught in a crowd of other (white) men preparing to lick a (white) shapely female covered in whipped cream (nuts and a cherry on top not included, he says), is in some ways indexing his own black body, the hysteria around the black rapist, along with the power and force of the crowd that can turn on you at anytime, the lynching. The ways that humor licks around these contexts of potential violence of the unspoken might be fascinating to explore further, as well. Even "Paper Piece" could, if we wished, take us to the association of black people in the newspapers and books, to ideas about representation in print and image. Might Patterson's chorus of tears and breaks reflect a desire to shape that news, to rumple and 1016</page><page sequence="3">C ALL ALOO bumple it, and if not to destroy it, to change the ways that the body (black and otherwise) interacts with it - so that as we think about how we are transposing newspaper or ads or maybe pages of a book into pure sound, we are at the same time reordering its meaning, postponing its meaning into the future, and changing the dynamic of its violence on black bodies? This performance not only forces us to think about the black body in relationship to objects, through this process of separation; in its repetition, we might also be haunted, remembering our bodies in the company of other bodies doing similar rituals of forget- ting to remember. We are connected to an invisible room of ancestors, even as we seek to transcend our selves through repetition of movement and pure sound. We might think of Patterson's works and the musics they make as provocations, as ko- ans - the awakening of a sense of consciousness, as "orders" that get us to think about the black body as it interacts in public space, with mundane objects, and the ways that those objects interact with blackness. In our everyday context these bodies when they interact with blackness can never be neutral. Or can they? Perhaps Patterson's work evokes this desire for freedom from these histories, a fugitive spirit for an elsewhere, a new country, where the loaded objects of every day - lunch counters, fire hoses, ropes - might also have transformed relationships (and note the title of a 1992/ 1993 show on Fluxus work, "Fluxus: a Conceptual Country"). In this way, Patterson's performances might prefigure the performance work of William Pope.L, including his crawl through downtown Manhattan. As Pope.L crawls through the space, black man humbled and on his knees, he forces his onlookers to think about the lack of neutrality of that every day space. Perhaps Patterson does so through the reverse, by taking (at least for the moment) these objects out of their overly determined contexts by reordering the body's relationship to them. And in that way reminding us of the need for such spaces to be reordered. Such reordering also takes place sonically in these pieces: the mixing up of sound hierarchies, the creation of new rhythms, altered senses of duration. In "Paper Piece," Patterson deepens and widens the range of sounds that we might hear in a tear, to hear buzzes and rumbling, an almost impossible range of sound that moves toward and away from the anthropomorphic: Shake Break Crumple Rumple Bumple Scrub Twist Poof Pop! In this way, we might think about Patterson's work as connected to the productively dis- orienting musical practices of one of my own objects of study, George Clinton and P-Funk music which asks us to reconfigure the black body in space and in the future. In interviews, in public appearances, and onstage, Clinton and other band members risk the notion of proper black masculinity, not just by cross-dressing, but by playing with 1017</page><page sequence="4">CALLALOO dynamics of humiliation, abjection, and exposure: wearing diapers or soiled bedsheets for robes, or see-through women's black lace panties; or creating the outsized and sexually anxious persona Sir Nose, with his pale, floppy, rubberized (and somewhat thinly) phallic schnoz for example - to disorient prevailing views of black masculinity and to open up new spaces for creation. Whether in Hazel's open displays of emotion or Clinton's self-parodic, shame-shedding laughter, P-Funk's performances embody and embrace nonnormative forms of desire and rage, as well as the unspoken loss that punctuates black male histories of embodiment in public space. In P-Funk's performances of eccentricity, and especially gender and sexual eccentricity, we might find a project of "creative historical knowing," to use Katherine Bond Stockton's phrase, that exposes among other things the racist logics of social debasement (Stockton 24). But if George Clinton and P-Funk get listeners to rethink the relationship of the black body in space in art that explicitly manipulates the highly theatrical persona of black "strangeness" or oddness, Patterson attempts another method - to help us locate the strange in the everyday object and action. Ultimately, like P-Funk, Patterson's pieces ask us who gets to transcend, and how is the demand to transcend the black body inherently political? Leading other black bodies to re-experience their own embodiment in public space (in the museum, in the classroom, on the street) is both artful and transformative. WORKS CITED Doris, David.
