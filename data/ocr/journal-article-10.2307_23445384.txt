<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUKUMARI BHATTACHARJI FATALISM - ITS ROOTS AND EFFECTS My first encounter with fatalism in practice took place thirty years back when a maidservant who was absent for a week said on her return that her two-year-old son had died of smallpox. When I asked her whether he had been vaccinated against it she said in a piously resigned tone that since the boy was 'fated' to die of smallpox no vaccination would have prevented his death. Of course, this attitude is born of ignorance, but what shocked me was her acceptance of the death and the peace and consolation she derived from this acceptance. Today, when an ignorant tiller resists the use of factory-made fertilizer and 'accepts' poor crops, he is motivated by this same fatalistic approach; 'This year the harvest was bound to fail, manure or no manure'. What is sinister is that such resignation holds back progress. Given proper enlightenment and economic progress much of this resistance to adopting modern technology and its benefits is bound to go. For example, an ancient Indian myth says that the earth rests on one of the hoods of the many-crested cosmic serpent Vâsuki and that earthquakes are caused by Vâsuki moving the earth from one of its tired hoods to another. Another myth says that solar or lunar eclipses take place when the demon Rdhu swallows the sun or moon. Now these betray the pre-scientific man's healthy instinct to understand, explore and explain natural phenomena beyond his control, phenomena which appear as cosmic disturbances. With knowledge, i.e., with the introduction of the seismograph and with progress in astronomy such explanations are invalidated; scientific, causal relations are established; and the inherent element of chance is no longer admitted. The pre-scientific tiller worshipped the field in the Sunâsïrïya sacrifice in Vedic times and the Ksetrapüjá in the Puranic age; he even invented gods like Ksetrapati and Haladhara to bless his cultivation.1 Droughts were sought to be remedied by the Kârïrï isti in Vedic times and by various pûjâs in the later Puranic period. Crop failure, similarly, was not traced to loss of chemicals in the soil but to supernatural agents, which if propitiated with due rituals would favour the supplicant with bumper harvests.

But irrigation, canal water and fertilizer also cost money, so there is a limit to the role of mere enlightenment. Hence, as long as the country cannot afford dissemination of enlightenment and the common man is not provided with the means to use the benefit of modern progress — fatalism holds sway in a very strong and significant manner and its roots go very deep and very far in history. If one is allowed to digress into the origin of the idea of fate it seems that fatalism stems mainly from three focal points — birth, accidents and death; of which the last is perhaps the most crucial. Birth is in the past, and death in the future, but accidents which dog us in Ufe mock man's faith in the inherent rationality of the scheme of life. These are in the present, hence all the more pressing. The element of fate involved at birth is that the child cannot choose his parents or the socio-economic circumstances in which he finds himself placed. This element of chance pursues him throughout his life because quite frequently his movements are circumscribed or his ambitions thwarted by fortuitous events. Finally, almost at each death, unfulfilled dreams and unachieved programmes make it appear as a cruel, premature end. Man is baffled because though rationality bids him plan his Ufe carefully and to act according to plans, yet accidents, diseases, misfortunes and bereavements come unexpectedly to decide his plans, and finally, death puts an end to it all. Most deaths seem senseless and life can never accept death, the supreme negation of existence itself. Hence in death man has to reckon with accidents and chance, the language he uses when he comes to terms with it is to call it 'fate'; for, in a very real sense such accidents mock human endeavour. No wonder, then, that Moira exists in most mythologies under myriad names. Fatalism is an old concept; Moira herself is an ancient goddess and the Erinyes appear as early as 15th c. B.C. in the Linear B tablets in Knossos. In Greece, Democritus held that atomism was a valid explanation of life but that eudaemonia or hedone was also within the grasp of man; while Diggenes Laertius said that God was one and the same with Reason (noûs), Fate, Heimarmene and Zeus. Providence was a slightly different concept and Cleanthes said that though all that comes through providence is fated it cannot be inverted; i.e., all that is fated is not providential.2 This view distinguishes between the benign and malevolent aspect of fate. The next problem that confronts fatalism is the concept of free will. Chrysippus sought to reconcile</page><page sequence="3">FATALISM - ITS ROOTS AND EFFECTS 137 the two, but with doubtful success. In Indian literature, too, fate as complete predetermination is sought to be assimilated in a single paradigm, sometimes making fate subservient to human endeavour, sometimes vice versa. Thus, as in Posidonius, we have passages in the post-Vedic literature which admonish men to challenge fate with Purusakâra, i.e., free will or effort. In the West, this attitude comes out more emphatically in Cicero's De Fato where fatalism is presented as moral escapism. In Indian texts there is a pronounced ambivalence regarding the rules of fate and free will. Various aspects of fate received various apotheoses in Moira, Heimarmene, Ate, Erinyes, Nike, Nemesis, and in several other names. Moira, the supreme theophany of this group has the closest association with death; but she is also connected with birth — the other terminus of life completely beyond human control. The earliest mention of Moira in the Iliad already associates her with fated death. But the conflict between determinism and the moral responsibility of the human agent is clear in the Odyssey where Zeus says that much of what man blames on fate or divine intervention he actually suffers because of his own action.3 The earliest religious literature in India, the Rgveda, however, does not know fatalism; it is the record of a warlike active people who achieved a series of spectacular victories through prowess and human effort, i.e., Purusakâra as opposed to Daiva, fate. Even the other Samhitâs and Brâhmams are not fatalistic; the supernatural agents, i.e., gods, in these texts exert themselves on behalf of the victorious Aryans who placate them with sacrifices accompanied by prayer and praise. The Brâhmanas clearly spell out the sacrifices suitable for each mundane need and predicament. Later in Jaimini's Pûrvamïmâmsâ, a system of philosophy brought into being by the sacrificial religion, it was postulated that the sacrifice, when properly performed, generates Apürva, a magic power which accomplishes the desired object. Thus in the intermediate agent between the sacrifice and its effect lies the concept of an unseen power which accomplishes what the gods did previously. As yet it is not strictly incalculable but correlates to the manner a sacrifice is performed. In a very vital sense this Apürva is above the gods, an abstract disembodied power which virtually acts independently of the gods. It contains the germ of the later concept of fatalism, though as yet it is calculable and predictable. The Aranyakas and Upanisads too, do not postulate any concept of fatalism as such. Words like Daiva, Niyati Bhâgya, Krtânta, Vidhilipi Lalâtalekhana, etc., are yet unknown in them. But actually this literature contains the essential</page><page sequence="4">138 SUKUMARI BHATTACHARJI constituent of the concept of fatalism. The 7th c. B.C. saw a spiritual ferment in the entire Mediterranean world from Greece, Rome and China to Iran and India. In India we see the rise of several ascetic sects like the Jains, Âjîvikas and Buddhists; also those whose representatives the Buddha met on his way, and the innumerable others which the early Pali Buddhist literature mentions. The country was then full of ascetic groups of various brands. Their point of departure from orthodox Vedism was a disbelief in sacrifices. As early as the Mundaka Upanisad we hear that sacrifices are unsteady boats. But something had happened to the religious climate of the country before this attitude could prevail. With the introduction of the iron ploughshare, vast tracts of lands could be ploughed. With the knowledge of brick architecture, surplus food could now be stored against a rainy day. With the resumption of trade with the Middle East, after a gap of a few centuries following the advent of the Aryans, the surplus in food and articles of cottage industries could be turned into profit for a handful of men at the top who exploited the labour of the tiller and the artisan whom they kept at bare subsistence level. With the invention of the calendar, agriculture could be undertaken with a great deal of certainty and the harvest was reasonably sure except for floods, droughts, pests and locusts. Along the Silk Route, trade spread to other parts of Asia and the introduction of rudimentary coinage put mercantile activity on a stable footing. Needless to say, all this directly benefited the risk merchant Vaisyas and Ksatriyas and indirectly the Brahmins; and it directly impoverished the vast majority of the primary producers, the poor farmer Viasyas and the innumerbale Südras. Life for them became really an evil. For them a theology had to be propounded which saw this life as an unmixed evil from which one must flee. In sharp contrast to the prevailing attitude of the RV where life is presented as sweet and covetable, to be prolonged and enjoyed to the full, Ufe is now depicted as an evil, a recurrent chain which should be snapped before one may taste the ultimate bliss. The belief in the theory of Karma, according to which each action acquires an equal and proportionate effect, to be suffered or enjoyed in this life or the next, gave rise to the theory of Janmdntara, rebirth. This is perhaps the cleverest solution man has ever devised to explain the anomalies of life; it succeeded eminently then and it succeeds even now. Many of the ascetic sects rejected the doctrine of Karma in the sense that good action is conducive to the realization that leads to liberation; some held that no matter how a man acted, liberation does not come, or comes after</page><page sequence="5">FATALISM - ITS ROOTS AND EFFECTS 139 8,400,000 lives. The major sects however, adhered to the doctrine of Karma and rebirth. Theories of heaven and hell, too, proliferated around this time, making the prospect even grimmer for the downtrodden masses. Heaven was a projection of the rich man's conspicuous consumption, a comparatively recent concomitant of the new prosperity. Hell, on the other hand, was a projection of the torture chambers where the social and political offenders were confined by the overlords of the new principalities. Both were drawn from real experience - hence exercised powerful control over the peoples' imagination. Although theoretically man was the architect of his own fate, actually he was a creature of his environments and felt under constraints which allowed him little real freedom of will. His growing hunger and pressing material needs did not afford him much choice in real life. For the common man life was indeed evil. He would give anything to prevent a repetition of the predicaments of his present life and escape into a better one in the next. Let us also remember that around the close of the Later Vedic Age, i.e., with the recognition and inclusion of the Atharvaveda in the canonical corpus, the Little Tradition in religion was gaining ascendancy. In the dissenting sects, in Buddhism, Jainism, etc., it was acknowledged in a more forthright and uninhibited manner. Even in Brahmanical literature the Atharvaveda, the later Brâhmanas and Upanisads present elements which signify a resurgence of the Little Tradition in its magical and Shamanistic elements. According to this tradition, which is also basically animistic, man's surroundings are infested with spirits, gnomes, demons, monsters, elves and goblins of various descriptions. These spirits are easily offended and, once offended, wreak their vengeance relentlessly. Hence living a pious life becomes doubly difficult. Even if one acts according to one's lights and does one's best to avoid acting wrong, one is exposed to the freaks and attacks of this spirit world. Thus man unwittingly offends powerful agents all around him. Life to him becomes an unmitigated misery. To explain his predicament, theologians offered the neat theory that he is reaping the fruit of his own actions of a previous birth. The natural corollary is that he should live an inoffensive life in order to avoid similar misery in the next birth, and in India as elsewhere living inoffensively means not offending the social, political and religious legislators. What the common man could not connect with any known action of his he calls adrsta, the unseen, i.e., fate. Appeasement of known and un known powers thus becomes his goal, he acknowledges the supreme role of fate.</page><page sequence="6">140 SUKUMARI BHATTACHARJI In the Vedâhga literature of the next age fate is openly mentioned; its numerous manifestations in the shape of the innumerable ills of life are enumerated; and minor new-fangled rites are prescribed to appease its wrath. A whole new literature-is born, the literature of expiation, Prâya'scitta, for sins committed consciously or unwittingly, for open transgressions and minor blemishes or remissnesses. Another auxiliary literature which flourished at the close of the Vedâhga literature is the Srdddhakalpa and Pretakalpa where rules are laid down for ameliorating the fate of the departed ancestors in the next world. These ancillary texts were composed because funerary and obsequial rites promised happiness to the departed souls, and to a large extent these rites and their results bordered on the unknown; so that there was an element of spiritual coercion of the ignorant masses by pleading that their loved ones would suffer in the next world unless such rites were performed. This was a by-product of fatalistic ideas prevalent in society. It is worth noting that in a Sraddha the appeasing agent is different from the offender; the appeasement is thus vicarious like 'masses' offered for a dead relative. It provides satisfaction to the bereaved survivor to serve a dear departed and it earns sumptuous fees to the officiating priest. It is not an accident that the Purânas which glorify the Sraddha are full of instruction for the proper fees to priests, the quality and quantity of articles to be given to them. The fear of the unknown regarding the life after death is fully exploited by the priests who thus managed to line their own nests richly and also to control the people's ritual actions. Thus not the dead man but the survivor's anxiety regarding the dead man's station in the next life was played upon, and a sense of an unknown future existence, i.e., one's fate even after death, extracted its dues from society.4 With the epics and Purânas, the scriptures of the masses, we enter a new stage, the final formative stage of Hinduism. Society had by now moved far away from the sacrificial religion of the Vedas. True, sacrifices were still performed by kings and rich patrons, but even before the rise of Buddhism the common masses had been reduced to mere passive on-lookers of ceremonies which they could neither afford to perform nor fully understand. With the break-up of tribal society the old religio-cultural homogeneity had disintegrated and the major collective sacrifices were offered for and by the kings and the nobility alone. The Upanisadic doctrine of liberation through gnosis' was beyond the comprehension of the masses. So, the common people were left with very little to fall back upon; this vacuum was filled by the</page><page sequence="7">FATALISM - ITS ROOTS AND EFFECTS 141 emergent epic-Puranic religion called Hinduism. This religion had inherited the Karma and rebirth theories which are used as its bottom-board. The epics and Purdnas invented myths, legends and anecdotes to communicate their religious message effectively to the masses. Let us examine one such tale from theMahâbhârata. (XIII: 1). GautamVs son died of snake-bite ; she charged the snake for the premature death of her son. The snake pleaded not guilty, saying that the boy's time had run out; Kdla there fore, was to blame; the word Kdla means time and death. When accused, Kdla said he was a mere agent, the boy's own Karma in the previous birth had determined both the time and manner of his death. So, in the final analysis a man's own actions are responsible for his life and death. Kdla, Antaka Yama are all called Dharmardja, the Lord of righteousness, in different passages.5 Significantly, in this period even the gods become subservient to these abstract entities. The Bhavisya Purdna, for example, makes Visnu act on Kdla's behest.6 For a time Yama as Kdla and Antaka becomes an approximation of justice and retribution.7 But the inscrutable power which controls human destiny is not death but fate and it is acknowl edged as such both by the Little Tradition and the Great Tradition. Story after story in the epics and Purdnas emphasize the inscrutability and inexorability of Fate. During the period under discussion, Buddhist and Jain compositions, espe cially the Jdtakas and A vaddna-sataka, are replete with stories of rebirth in which the agent is rewarded or punished with birth in exalted or lowly stations in the next life according to his actions in this life. The epics, too, are full of such accounts; beginning from the major characters down to insignificant characters they simply illustrate the Karma theory. As yet Karma has notionally proportionate results; it can be vaguely controlled and predicted and so it cannot quite be equated with fate. But essentially it gives rise to the concept of fate; let us see how. The theory of Karma predicates that each action begets an equal or proportionate fruit, good or bad, which the agent enjoys or suffers in this or the next birth. But nowhere8 does this theory postulate an intelligent arbiter or judge who decides which act begets which result. Episode after episode in the Buddhist, Jain texts and Brahmanical epics and Purdnas narrates the pseudo-causal chain of action and reaction9 of Karman and its phala. These stories display ingeniousness and imagination; but that is hardly a substitute for real equations and exact equivalences which alone could make</page><page sequence="8">142 SUKUMARI BH ATTACH A RJI the theory acceptable to reason. A study of such stories betrays plenty of anomalies and discrepancies, for, frequently similar acts beget different effects. From this point of view the Buddhist tales perhaps contain greater uniformity or symmetry. The Puranic tales of good and evil deeds are perhaps more colourful and thrilling but they fail to put forward a coherent and uniform system of equations between action and reaction. Hence the element of incalculability persists and the inscrutable power beyond comprehension is called adrsta (unseen), a synonym of fate. The epic-Puranic tales emphasize the function of fate through episodes of curses and boons. Someone does a good turn to a sage, a god in disguise or simply to a distressed person who in gratitude blesses his benefactor with some element of good fortune — long life, cure from a disease, children if he is childless, wealth, heaven or some other happiness. Or someone harms an innocent person who curses him with some malady, loss, discomfiture, hell or some other form of misery. These come to pass either in this life or in the next. Again, the curse and the boon, but more frequently the curse is sometimes modified, limited, shortened or deferred if the agent is mollified with humble solicitations. In these instances the curses and boons once uttered acquire a mysterious power of their own. Like the Apürva generated by correctly performed sacrifices, the power generated by curses and boons are irrevocable; they are like arrows shot from the bow, but very rarely they can be slightly modified. This possibility places the cursed person in terrorized subjection to priests or sages who promise such modification, sometimes through penance but more frequently through appropriate rituals. To the recipient such curses and boons are to a great extent unintelligible elements of fate generally uttered by holy men or gods in disguise, hence they bear sure results. The curse and boon words, though uttered by human agents, are really logos charged with supernatural power, a surrogate for divine intervention. Quite frequently curses are unexpected, unjust, rash temper tantrums of irate sages, at such times, they can only be taken as fate because they are palpably disproportionate to the error or remissness which provokes them. This element of uncertainty, shock and surprise make them appear as expressions of an august power beyond the victim's control, an expression of fate. Although the Karma theory is not overtly fatalistic, in actual application it inevitably assumes a fatalistic colour. Let us examine how this happens. During the period between the Upanisads and the Purdnas religious doctrines</page><page sequence="9">FATALISM - ITS ROOTS AND EFFECTS 143 in India were in a particularly inchoate shape. India never had an organized church, or theology ; early Vedism had just the right amount of doctrinal uniformity to give some sort of cohesion to religious theory and practice. Needless to say, much of this can be accounted for by the tribal nature of the society which practised it, and by a body of myths and ritual shared in common by a comparatively close-knit society. With the dissemination of this religion to remote areas in this vast subcontinent, after the religio-cultural homogeneity had disintegrated through racial miscegenation and after tribal society had broken up to give rise to patriarchal family units, such a religion lost its raison d'etre. The major sacrifices were continued by the kings and the nobility while the family units reverted to the domestic rites and benefits of the Little Tradition, which had a significant resurgence during this time in Jainism, Buddhism and Brahmanism. The inherent animism of the Little Tradition peoples the upper air with all manner of ghosts and spirits. With the built-in incertitude of the Karma theory, eschatology also was disturbingly divergent. What happens to a man after death? If he has lived a pious life and has worked off the back-log of sins from his previous births he (a) either goes to heaven or (b) is reborn in a happy and blissful condition9 or (c) goes to hell where he suffers for a brief while and then ascends to heaven, or (d) if he has managed to snap his mortal ties and desires he is united with Brahman. If he has lived a wicked or sinful life he (a) either becomes an obnoxious and malevolent spirit and hovers in the upper air or (b) goes to heaven where he enjoys the fruits of the small merit he has managed to lay by in his wicked life and then descends to hell or (c) is reborn in a wretched and disgusting state. AU this complexity is doubly complicated by (a) the rather volatile norms of good and evil (for India never cultivated an ethics divorced from religion), by (b) the total uncertainty regarding which act would breed which reaction, by (c) the absence of a just, and omniscient arbiter who metes out rewards and punishments impartially, (d) by the intervention of the spirit world, and, finally, by (e) curses and boons which, though nominally provoked by the recipient's conduct are yet frequently unpredictable and disproportionate, the authors of such curses and boons acting as agents of fate. The many alternatives of the fruits of one's actions are nowhere classified and related proportionately with the actions which generate them. Here the situation is more muddled and uncertain than the Apürva which a correctly performed Vedic sacrifice would engender and which unfailingly ensured the</page><page sequence="10">144 SUKUMARI BHATTACHARJI desired object. Theoretically, the Vedic theological position was thus on a much sounder footing than the Puranic Hindu Karma theory. The theological chaos inherent in the fatalism prevalent in this age, however, was not only eminently suitable for the religious climate of the day, it was virtually indispensable. The cultivation of astrology also greatly fostered the growth of fatalism among the people. A whole tribe of astrologers grew up and the thraldom which this pseudo-science exercised over the masses is truly fearful in degree and extent. One of its formative factors was the deification of the planets and the formidable minutiae regarding their function and influence over human destiny. It was worked out assiduously till almost nothing in a man's career was left unexplained. Astrology was cultivated in every country because certain physical symptoms are really connected with the heavenly bodies; this observation led to the unwarranted conclusion that the course of a man's life is causally linked with the behaviour of the planets. Gradually in India idols named after the heavenly bodies were housed in temples and in strategic points in the capitals, forts, treasuries and city gates. Texts for their worship stated their specific jurisdictions and predilections as well as the benefits they promised the devotees.10 The widespread worship of Sani, Saturn, is quite recent in Bengal about a decade old. A small painting of this sinister god is put on a tray with flowers etc. and this tray is placed on a cart. People bow and place their money on the tray. The cult has an obvious socio-economic base : a substantial section of factory workers are temporary hence threatened with retrenchment which in mythical language is to be 'under the evil eye of Sani\ In order to avert this very real danger these men will naturally be tempted into worshipping Sani. What makes this whole syndrome really pathetic and sinister is that factory workers are paid on Saturday, Sani's day, and fear prompts them to appease the dread god lest he should destroy them. Thus the danger, viz. retrenchment which should properly be fought with collective resistance is sought to be averted through this peace-offering which these poor workers can hardly afford. Other planet gods govern other vulnerable areas of life and extort their dues wjiich go to fill up temple coffers or find their way to the officiating priests' purse. Naturally an elaborate mythology and liturgy would be spun round the planets, for the fear these gods evoked was in a sense more directly connected with man's everyday life. The wrath and protest which people in wretched conditions would feel is carefully channelled away from</page><page sequence="11">FATALISM - ITS ROOTS AND EFFECTS 145 their real targets; priests and texts help deflect it from its natural target. Socio-political upheavals are thus averted and incidentally progress is thwarted, if only temporarily. The epic-Puranic religion had several new post-Vedic features beside the theories of Karma and rebirth: unlike the Vedic religion it had temples, images, pilgrimages, vows, the concept of a personal saviour in Siva and the various incarnations of Visnu, the mediation of a family priest and a family ikon and the belief in spirits infesting the atmosphere. Spiritually there was a climate of uncertainly — uncertainly regarding the result of the neglect of one's duties to the gods, in general, and to the temple deities and family ikons in particular, also against priests who as intermediaries between the gods and the laity enjoyed an enviably exalted position. Invisible agents lurking in the mid-air like demons, discontented ghosts and unappeased spirits could also destroy his well-being and peace. Then, he could also unwittingly incur the wrath of holy men and be cursed with misery in this life and/or the next. A whole bulky literature grew up in the Puránas: it was composed by sectarian temple priests who laid down rules for cultic rituals and who improvised innumerable obligatory, cultic, seasonal, as well as expiatory rites for all conceivable predicaments. Such a religion on the one hand took notice of every domestic and social situation and by prescribing rites for them assuaged doubts and misgivings, and on the other hand, packed the familial and social Ufe with innumerable rituals. It was much more all-pervasive than the Vedic Srauta and Grhya rites taken together. In each rite a Brahmin priest presided and received fees for his services. Now, it was in the interest of this hieratic section to convince the lay clients that the future was thoroughly unpredictable. Then the priests could extract fatter fees, by improvising rites for real and imaginary dangers lurking in the atmosphere, for spirits prowling all around to attack and destroy the peoples' well-being,11 for curses in the previous birth bearing fruit in this or to prevent unwitting offences in this life bearing fruit in the next.12 Curses are thus treated as major agents of fate. Something like this is found in early Greek literature. In Homer, "the Erivyes often become devoid of their personal force,... and then they are simply synonymous with the curse or curses a person utters".13 The depersonalization involved in the idea of curses and boons being effective independently renders them into formidable spiritual agents. A logical concomitant of this exalts them not only beyond human control but sometimes even above the gods; mythology and theology thus become</page><page sequence="12">146 SUKUMARI BHATTACHARJI subservient to the abstract power of fate. To the common man bewildered by these multiple possible causes of his misery, of disease, loss and death, the causes of which he could never satisfactorily guess, nor could connect action with reaction, the whole syndrome appeared simply as the operation of fate. He resigned himself to this all-pervasive supernatural power which loomed above him; there was little he could know, guess, anticipate or do to prevent it from talking its course ; all that was left to him was to appease and expiate through the ever-multiplying rites. The concept of fate is not compatible with the theory of Karma on the ideological level, for the latter is posited as a causal chain. Neither is fate strictly compatible with any religion as such, because the benevolent gods, mostly soterial now, could be placated with proper worship. They could be mollified with bhakti, devotion, a comparatively new emotional approach to the gods. Pilgrimages and vows also theoretically expunge a multitude of sins not only of this life but of many previous lives. Hence, theoretically, the element of fate is negated by them. But eschatology has never been clearly or unequivocally enunciated, so that an element of incertitude is inherent in one's fate after death. The innumerable possibilities of pitfalls, remissnesses and transgressions also added to the common man's confusion. Another area which priests and shamans both concentrated on around this time was that of auguries, omens, portents and dreams — all of which could have sinister forebodings and for which appropriate ritual steps should be taken to avert the evils indicated by them. In Márkandeya P. Ch. 33 and in Bhdgavata P. 3: 17 we have long catalogues of omens and portents. In the latter the birth of the demons Hiranyâksa and Hiratyyakasipu was accompanied by many supernatural events. The Mahàbhârata is full of such augury at the birth of its major characters and also when they go out to battle in which they would eventually meet victory or death. Also "the Iliad . .. shows the beginning of a use of some adjectives derived from aisa in connection with good and bad omens".13 The assumption behind such an attitude towards omens and augury is that there is some unapprehended logical connection between what meets the eye and what it forebodes: it is because we are mere mortals that our vision cannot penetrate the veil. To emphasize this point sometimes sages, gods and holy men interpret signs and dreams, thus proving that some arcane knowledge, occult power or supernatural endowment is necessary to decode the language of omenology.14</page><page sequence="13">FATALISM - ITS ROOTS AND EFFECTS 147 India does not have oracles as such because here sages and holy men function as oracles. People in their bewilderment or in dire need of pre-vision before an important undertaking or when baffled in their endeavours come to holy men who sort out the spiritual things for them. Our Dodonas are most frequently temple priests who prescribe some ritual purification, vows or pious acts before they show supplicants if or how their desires will be fulfilled. According to the law of probability some come true and, needless to say, enough margin of error is provided to explain failures. Again faith in some supernatural scheme with the possibility of intervention (but only through arcane activity) is generated; since the scheme, agent and manner of divination are completely obscure these act as so many manifestations of fate.15 In the Raghuvam'sa of Kdlidasa the childless king Dillpa goes to the family preceptor, the sage Vasistha, for divination and remedy ; he acts on the sage's advice and gets a son. In the Mahàbhârata the sage Narada fore-tells Satyavat's life-span (III: 29). In most Puránas this kind of diagnosis of and prescription for human misfortunes are given by holy men, the assumption being that their piety and religious merits bring them into close touch with the invisible structure of the spiritual correspondences inherent in the universe ; hence they can know, and since they also know to the very end they can lay down proper remedial courses of action. The emotional climate was just right to foster all kinds of superstititions sanctioned by the Puranic texts. Belief in magic and the mysterious was fully exploited,16 but fate the inscrutable and omnipotent loomed large, daunting the common man, cocercing him to fall in line with whatever the priests and scriptures prescribed. Fear was the dominant motive and the very inscrutability of fate made it all the more formidable. Let us not forget that many significant religious movements belong to these long centuries in which the concept of fatalism matured. These movements of the Saiva and Vaisnava orders frequently used fatalism indirectly, in anecdotes which were composed primarily with the aim of inculcating sectarian doctrines. Islam too, had been introduced and gained converts. But nothing altered the prevalent atmosphere of a broadly fatalistic approach to life which was wholly conducive to an unquestioning acceptance of the powers that be — religious, social and political. If one is poor, diseased, bereaved or wretched it is his fate to be so. Quite frequently we hear phrases which mean fate is incontrovertible — Niyatih kena bddhyate. Thousands of verses in long poems, dramas or anthologies bear</page><page sequence="14">148 SUKUMARI BH ATTACH A RJI testimony to this attitude of acquiescence to Fate Supreme. True, we have statements which urge man to prove his mettle and fight fate, but such a fight is doomed to defeat. The Mahdbharata hero Kama says Daivâyattam kule janma madâyattam tu paurusam ; 'birth in a lowly station was ordained by fate, but prowess lies with me'. Yet all readers of the epic know that Kama's fight against a relentless fate was like the fight of the Greek tragic heroes who, pitted against incomparably superior powers, fought a lost battle if only to redeem the pride of their manhood. But in the Greek tragedies the heroes fought against rivals assisted by gods who had reasons justified by the socio religious code to help some and hinder others; thus even the defeated heroes did not feel betrayed by fate. Here in India Fate appears to man as a blind force because man himself is totally blind regarding its motivations. So a man has no way of knowing why in spite of living a pious life he is ruined. Sometimes the epic Puranic myths enlighten the victims about the function of fate, thus giving an inkling regarding the inscrutable ways of it, but since, for the overwhelming majority such flashes are at best sporadic and at worst non-existent, men remain totally in the dark as to why they suffer the way they do. Life for the vast majority during those long centuries was really barely tolerable. The tillers and the craftsmen lived on the bare minimum of wages, wealth accumulated in the hands of the wealthy few, accounts of whose conspicuous consumption fill the pages of court dramas and poems. The discrepancy in the life-styles at the top and at the base was so wide that it called for some theological explanation. The theory of karma and rebirth more than adequately explained it. Where man would normally cry out against want, disease, exploitation and wretchedness the protest was effec tively smothered by these vicious doctrines. Because actions in previous birth remain unknown and unknowable the so-called fruits of such actions which man suffers in this life are called a-drsta. Yet people did resist oppression and exploitation because no theory however cogent or however binding apparently can ever totally crush the life-urge in man. There are long controversies in the epics and Purdnas on the relative potency of fate and free will. Absolute determinism negates the life-urge, hence the different scriptural texts on this subject are widely contradictory. The first significant passage is in the Mahdbharata where we hear 'fate without effort is barren'.17 'What can fate do to a righteous man?'18 "A</page><page sequence="15">FATALISM - ITS ROOTS AND EFFECTS 149 proud and powerful man is not thwarted by fate" after which follows a catalogue of illustrations. 'As a lamp becomes dim when the oil runs out so fate grows weak when action (karman) is exhausted'.19 Chapters 116—119, and 144,145 in bk XIII illustrate and emphasize the ethical way of life and posit release (moksa) from karma and its effect as the summum bonum of life. The whole of Chapter XIX: 18 is a dissertation on karma and its effect; it begins with: 'neither good nor bad acts are ever obliterated, they ripen, i.e., bear fruit in appropriate fields'. Man's moral responsibility is not altogether swamped by express statements to the contrary; human effort in the face of apparently insuperable odds is praised and held up as worthy of emulation in many episodes. But instances of an opposite, i.e., fatalistic attitude implicitly calling for conscious even voluntary resignation to an inscrutable and irresistible power are too many and they succeed in setting the tone. They outline a universe where actions and reactions are foreordained so that it becomes useless to kick against the pricks. Because of the wide prevalence of this morally debilitating theory, which on an easily intelligible level told man that his fortune or future was essentially incomprehensible since Fate rules supreme, that the powers that guide the course of human destiny are essentially inscrutable, because of the deadening pressure of this, much potential protest must have been quashed. It suited religious and secular authorities to hold the common man in a spiritual and material bondage which thoroughly emasculated him, and Fatalism was a tremendously powerful tool in their hand with which they achieved their ends for many centuries. A religious climate which accommodates a large measure of magic, omenology, divination, oracles, astrology, curses and boons and above all was ruled by an increasingly potent priesthood which held the common man under bondage — this accounts for the inherent power this vicious doctrine has been exercising effectively for over fifteen centuries. Fatalism, we must remember is no philosophy; it offers no consistent world-view, has no cosmology, ontology, epistemology, teleology or eschatology, yet it affects all these in the religious and philosophical attitudes of a society which generates it. Again, as an attitude it is not essentially, necessarily or exclusively primitive, because it frequently flourishes among quite sophisticated sections of society. But generally speaking, it presupposes a backward stage in science and technology; when control over nature improves, when material wealth makes the fruits of technological advance</page><page sequence="16">150 SUKUMARI BHATTACHARJI available to the masses, the basis of fatalism is shaken. In most societies there is an inverse ratio between over-all material progress, dissemination of scientific, technological advance and fatalism. Mere knowledge of a non mythical or scientific explanation of nature, however, is not enough for a man to act upon such knowledge because quite frequently he is without the means to put such knowledge into practice (as in the case of the farmer and fertilizer), sometimes in-built resistances persist for quite some time even after scientific aids come his way, especially when the level of education is not high enough for him to co-ordinate an isolated piece of scientific information with the total ethos of his life (as in the case of vaccination, inoculation and family-planning). As long as vast areas of life remain beyond man's effective control fatalism flourishes, chiefly because it is easier to reconcile it with a mythical view of life which remains the prevalent view in India as well as in many other countries. The essence of fatalism is an emphasis on the accidental above the rational, on the incalculable above the predictable and controllable. The basis is the very real presence of the uncontrollable accidental element in life and fatalism as an attitude is a matter of this tilt in favour of the accidental rather than the rationally calculable areas of life. In India as also elsewhere fatalism contains an element of revolt against intel lectualism, especially where rationality or intellectualism fails to solve certain problems. Chronologically, the resurgence of fatalism coincides with the Upanisads. In other words, when the upper strata of the intelligentsia was advocating knowledge, gnosis, as the only valid approach to life and reality, the only potent religious action capable of ensuring release, moksa\that an antithesis to this approach made itself felt. Of course, the object of Upanisadic knowledge is different from the sceptic's adrsta, but by denying the supreme status to knowledge fatalism posed an epistemological void, a blind alley, where the reality of man's future remained unknown and unknowable. By tacitly asserting that not everything in life can be predicted, calculated or controlled, fatalism magnifies the role of chance above those vast areas which increasingly come within the purview of rational control. Such an attitude leads to passivity and stagnation, and up to a point it serves the interests of the powers that be. Fatalism also militates against any coherent theology. For if the gods represent a benign providence guiding man to the path of truth, beauty, happiness and fulfilment, then the necessary vacuum is not admitted in which</page><page sequence="17">FATALISM - ITS ROOTS AND EFFECTS 151 fate can operate. With the benign gods controlling man's course in life, determinism can only result in his happiness. But experience provides many rude jolts which shatter such an optimistic view of Ufe, hence "a profound scepticism or even pessimism not only about the goodness of the gods of legend but even any basis for morality ... (is) found in phusis."20 If the over all scheme were controlled by the powers of goodness then fatalism becomes inadmissible, especially because it negates the role of free-will, purusakdra: something like the Calvinistic controversy on pre-determination and free-will dominated the philosophical discussions in India in the epic-Puranic literature. Once again the cardinal point in the controversy is a matter of emphasis. One passage says that Daiva, Purusakdra and Kdla (Time); these three together bring about a man's fate.21 Another clearly states that "all misfortunes and accidents are controlled by Kdla; if Kdla is adverse and angry, how then shall we escape? It is an ordinance of Brahman that everything, all the strength of creatures, in the three words is subordinate to Kdla',22 while another passage says that Dharma (Law), Kdla and death always move together.23 A man is taken to Dharmardja's city twelve days after his death and (there) he sees Yama among Mrtya, Kdla and Antaka.24 Kdla creates all creatures, and destroys them, all are under Kdla\ domination, Kdla is under none.25 The elevation of time, Kdla, was necessary for fostering the growth of the concept of fatalism. Time that matters most vitally is the future, and the concept of Mahakdla, an embodiment of infinity, is the closest mythical approximation to futurity. In mythology Siva the dread ender of aeons is called Mahakdla26 the god of death. This god moves in the company of ghosts and spirits and is an alter ego of Yama. Hence myths which connect Kdla, Antaka, Yama and Dharmardja implicitly associate Siva with them. In and through Siva Time and Death are apotheosized. It is not an accident that the popular Dharma cult associates Siva with the god Dharma. It is a mythical language for saying that Time is a fair arbiter, that together Dharma (justice) Kdla (time) and Yama (death) dispense righteously. This is an effort to reconcile man to his lot, to assure him that nothing is arbitrary because these gods are at the helm of man's affairs, that ultimately nothing can or will go wrong. But this has never been clearly postulated in theology or mythology so that to the common man fate remains dark and inscrutable. A semblance of fair and impartial retribution is sought to be given by introducing the mythical character Gtragupta who writes down a man's sinful and righteous acts which deserve rewards and punishments in the next life.27</page><page sequence="18">152 SUKUMARI BHATTACHARJI Fatalism in a sense runs counter to the innumerable injunctions on the Srâddha rite, for, if the sráddha is effective, then sins committed by one can be vicariously expiated by another and the moral responsibility is shifted from the actual performer of Karma. Curses and boons which influence a man's course in life often appear as arbitrary and not strictly compatible with any cogent metaphysical theory. Similarly, if ghosts and spirits can really affect a man's life then the good and evil deeds done by the agent are reduced to the ineffective. If it is assumed that curses and boons, ghosts and spirits, Sraddhas and praya'scittas, even merit-sharing (which is occasionally illustrated in episodes in the Purânas) all fall within a general scheme of predestination, then karma becomes redundant or is relegated to a subordinate position. And if this scheme of fate or pre-determination itself is controlled by karman then the assumption of those numerous subsidiary agencies become redundant, even mutually contradictory. So rational cogency was never even attempted with regard to fatalism. Yet this all-enveloping obscurity of fatalism dominated the religious scene for millennia. It was in the interest of the priests to posit it with its myriad agencies and manifestations. And this was possible because of the backward economic condition of the multitudes and the lack of scientific knowledge about the universe and the manner of its functioning. When the dissemination of scientific knowledge and the raising of the economic level will make a non-superstitious and non-fatalistic world-view not only feasible but imperative and indispensable then the roots of fatalism will snap in the social intra-structure. It may linger for some time in the superstructure but it will lose the power to captivate the popular imagination through fear and awe. Social-economic progress will destroy its roots and such progress then, in its turn, will be greatly facilitated and expedited.

Chapters 51,126, 136: the course of the planets regulating the seasons, and the influence of the planets on nature is treated in Matsya P. Chapters 125, 126. Rites to celebrate certain positions of the planets were a late introduction, following their worship in anthropomorphic forms. These rites are prescribed in Agni P. Chapter 164 Matsya P. Chapters 54 ff, Chapter 73 and Agni P. Chapter 196. An offshoot of these grahadevatas (planet deities) and their worship is the connection of planets with precious stones supposed to avert evils caused by planets, Agni P. Chapters 121, 246, and Kürnw P. Chapter 42 are instances of this new 'science'. 11 Cf., section on spirits and seizures in Agni P.
