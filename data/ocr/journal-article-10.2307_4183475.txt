<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DIWAN OF AL-SHARIF AL-TALIQ HARRY NEALE University of California, Berkeley Abstract This article presents the reconstructed diwan of the Andalusi poet Marwan b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Marwan b. 'Abd al-Rahman al-Nasir al-Sharif al-Taliq (d. 400/1009). This reconstruction has been assembled from fragments of poetry attributed to al- Sharif al-Taliq that are found in various compilations of biographies of Andalusi poets. The late Spanish scholar, Emilio Garcia G6mez, included translations of a number of these fragments in his study of Andalusi poetry, Cinco poetas musul- manes: biografias y estudios (Madrid: Espana-Calpe, 1944). In addition to present- ing the existing fragments of the diwin, including fragments that Garcia G6mez did not have at his disposal, I undertook a thematic reading of the diwan with attention to the imagery and motifs that recur within the poems. In this way, I hope to dis- till a specific voice that is the lyric idiom of this little-studied poet. The frame of reference for the analysis of the diwan is a fragmentary qdfiyyah by al-Sharif al- Taliq. This qasidah has been selected because it offers the most complete repertoire of the imagery and vocabulary of al-Sharif al-Taliq's poetry available to us. The poetry of Marwan b. 'Abd al-Rahman al-Nasir Abfi 'Abd al-Malik al- Sharif al-Taliq (d. 400/1009) exists only in fragmentary form. However, the remnants of his diwdn merit an in-depth and critical reading, in particular the qasidah that has remained almost intact, "ghusunun yahtazzu fi di'si naqd/A branch which sways on a rounded sand dune." The primary source for the majority of the qasidah, the shorter poems, and fragments is a col- lection of biographies of Andalusi poets written by Ibn al-Abbar, entitled al- Hullah al-siyard' which Reinhart Dozy included in his Notices sur quelques manuscrits arabes.' In 1985, al-Hullah al-siyarda' was published separately in two volumes.2 The other fragments appear in al-Maqqari's Nafh al-tib, Ibn Bassam's Kitdb al-dhakhira ft mahdsin ahl al-jazira, and Ibn al-Jawzi's Dhamm al-hawd. Thus far, no study of the diwdn of this little-known but brilliant poet has been undertaken. In his book, Cinco poetas musulmanes, Emilio Garcia Leiden: E. J.

However, Garcia Gomez does not give a critical reading of the diwan. The first complete English translation of the qasldah (with the exception of one line) appeared in James T. Monroe's Hispano-Arabic Poetry: a Student Anthology.4 Thus far, Richard Serrano is the only scholar to have analyzed the qasidah in his insightful article that appeared in Homoeroticism in Classical Arabic Literature.5 It is the aim of this article to provide a translation into English of the diwdn of al-Sharif al-Taliq with a critical analysis thereof.6 Brief Biography of al-Sharif al-Taliq Barring the essential details, little is known regarding the life of al-Sharif al-Taliq. Most of what we do know about him is contained in al-Dabbi's Bughyat al-multamis, a history of the notable men of al-Andalus written in the late 6th/12th century. According to al-Dabbi, al-Sharif al-Taliq was an Umayyad prince and the great-grandson of the renowned Umayyad caliph, 'Abd al-Rahman III. Al-Dabbi refers to al-Sharif al-Taliq as, "a prolific poet and man of letters the majority of whose poetry was [composed] in prison."7 He also quotes Ibn Hazm, who compared al-Sharif al-Taliq to the celebrated 'Abbasid poet and prince, Ibn al-Mu'tazz (d. 296/908), "for his elegant poetry and beautiful metaphors."8 In his Tawq al-hamdmah, Ibn Hazm pro- claims al-Sharif al-Taliq to be the greatest poet of his time in al-Andalus.9 Concerning al-Sharif al-Taliq's imprisonment, al-Dabbi mentions that the poet was in love with a slave-girl whom his father had raised with him and designated for him. Apparently, his father decided to possess the girl 3 Emilio Garcia G6mez, "El Principe Amnistiado", Cinco poetas musulmanes: biografias y estudios (Madrid: Espasa-Calpe, 1944), 69-93. 4 James T.

Unfortunately, these fragments were unavailable to me at the time of the writing of this article. For the sake of completeness, I have translated these two fragments from Garcia G6mez's Spanish translations and have included them in appendix A [2]. 7 Ahmad b. Yahya b. Ahmad b.

The youth unsheathed his sword and availed himself of the opportunity that his father's seclusion with the girl afforded. He slew his father, for which crime he was imprisoned at the age of sixteen. According to al-Dabbi, al-Sharif al-Taliq's life can be divided neatly into three periods of sixteen years-his childhood and early youth, his imprisonment, and the remaining years of his life that he spent in freedom after the hdjib, al-Mansfir, had pardoned him. His release by al-Mansfir gave rise to his cognomen al-Sharif al-Taliq.10 We know almost nothing of the circumstances of his life following his release from prison. Fortunately, what has come down to us of his poetry informs us that he was a great poet: it is in his poems that we find subtle indica- tions of his character and aspirations. The Qasidah The qasidah is divided into four parts consisting of a nasib, khamriyah, nawriyah, and a fakhr. It must be emphasized that this qasidah is a recon- struction based on fragments preserved in various books and manuscripts. For this reason, we may only make conjectures as to the exact arrangement of the lines. In the first section of the poem, the speaker describes the beauty of the beloved; in the second, the drinking of wine; in the third, the gar- den's imbibing of rain during a thunderstorm; and in the fourth, the poet's own beauty, nobility, and accomplishments. Let us begin our analysis of the poem by examining the last two lines (41 and 42) that occur in the fakhr. In these lines, the speaker unveils his underlying motive for having composed the poem and manifests the foun- dation of its primary emotive pulse, by declaring himself the savior of his family's waning honor and glory: It is I who am the glory of the descendants of 'Abd al-Shams, while by me the worn-out portion of their glory is renewed. It is I who clothe in splendor the worn-out portion of their illustrious lineage with the ornaments of my resplendent poetry." The significant phrases in these two lines are jadda (to renew), and kasd bi-huld rawnaqi shi'ri. The concepts of revivification and illumination are the recurring motifs that a thematic analysis of the poem reveals to us. 10 al-Dabbi, Bughyat al-multamis, 462. " The entirety of the translation of the qasidah (line 26 excluded) is that of James Monroe from pages 154-159 of his book, Hispano-Arabic Poetry: A Student Anthology (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1974). For the complete English translation and the Arabic text of the qasidah, please refer to appendix A [1]. 22</page><page sequence="4">THE DIWAN OF AL-SHARIF AL-TALIQ These themes culminate in the last two lines of the poem wherein the speaker proclaims his worthiness for the task of reviving the glory of his lineage. Although the nasib and khamriyah do exhibit these two motifs, we must search for the theme of the poem in the nawriyah, where the metaphors of renewal and illumination occur most frequently. Having identified the central motifs of the nawriyah, we will be able to link them to corresponding motifs and imagery in the other three sections of the poem. In the first lines of the nawriyah, the clouds offer rain to the garden, thereby causing it to bring forth its plants: And many a cloud sending forth rain is such that its showers are a drinking companion to the garden, for it sings and pours out drink. Moreover, it is as though the earth were its jail and as though the plants were a criminal who has been imprisoned.'2 These lines evoke a strong metaphor of fertility and revitalization. In line 25, the clouds bring new life to the garden, which exudes moisture from the abundance of rain: While the thunder softly mourns, so that the cups of the rain flow over [the garden] exuding moisture. If we return to the earlier khamriyah, we encounter an image that corre- sponds with that of line 18 of the nawriyah. Here, in lines 11 and 12, the speaker offers wine to a "young gazelle:" Many a cup which dressed the wing of gloom with a tunic of light which shone from its flash, Did I spend the night offering to drink to a young gazelle in whose glance there was a sleepy languor the sight of my eye kept awake. These lines are worthy of note in that there is a reversal of roles: it is the speaker who gives wine to the cupbearer. This role reversal is an early indi- cation of what the speaker declares in the final lines of the poem: it is he who restores life and resplendent glory. Here, he reinvigorates the cupbearer with a draught of wine, in the same manner that the clouds revive the gar- den with their rains. In line 6, which is the middle of the nasib, the speaker informs us that, "a branch becomes beautiful when it has borne leaves." This is the culmination of the five preceding lines in which the speaker praises his beloved in highly metaphorical language that is couched in botanical terms. It is as if the speaker has caused the beloved to flower in '2 The second hemistich echoes the poet's own imprisonment. 23</page><page sequence="5">HARRY NEALE the same manner that the rain brought forth the plants and flowers of the garden in the nawriyah. The motif of illumination is prominent throughout the nawriyah. The cen- tral motif of the poem is located precisely in the middle, where we are pre- sented with two powerful images of lightning. In line 20, lightning clothes the sides of the cloud with the polychrome robe of its flashes. In line 21, lightning again pierces the darkness of a black thundercloud and renders it black and white: The lightning clothes [the cloud's] sides with its glittering brocade robe when it flashes, And it is as though the dark thundercloud in it were a black [horse] on whom [the lightning] has cast a motley hue. The image from the khamriyah, in which cups of wine dress the gloomy darkness with their brilliant flashes, anticipates the more intense images of lightning that occur later in the nawriyah. A prelude to the rising sun of the nawriyah is also apparent in the khamriyah. The wine shines "like the sun's rays as they meet the dawn" and in the subsequent lines, the cup, resem- bling a yellow narcissus, rises like a sun that sets in the mouth of the cup- bearer and leaves a rosy glow on his cheeks.13 Again, we may view the events of the khamriyah as a metaphorical prelude to the events of the nawriyah, and ultimately to the declaration by the speaker of his aims at the conclu- sion of the poem. In lines 23 and 24, the benevolent lightning illuminates the trajectory of the planets that have lost their way in the darkness: On certain nights of which the planets wander astray, losing their way without being able to distinguish their orbits, The lightning lights up its lantern for them so that the face of their gloom turns into a sunrise. The concluding images of illumination that appear in the nawriyah are in lines 27 and 28. Here, the sun, the ultimate symbol of radiance and illumi- nation, appears as a life-giving and munificent force that sustains the flowers that the rain has brought forth. The sun wraps the garden in the cloak of its own light (min sandhdi), thereby causing the beauty of the flowers to become manifest. In the same manner, the radiant wine in the beginning of the khamriyah dresses the gloomy darkness in a garment of its own light (min sandhd), whereas the lightning in the nawriyah clothes the sides of the cloud with a robe of light.'4 We may follow this motif of cloaking with light, which gradually becomes increasingly splendid and powerful. The motif first appears as a 13 See appendices, lines 14 and 15. 14 Ibid., lines 11 and 27. 24</page><page sequence="6">THE DIWAN OF AL-SHARIF AL-TALIQ bright glass of wine that metamorphoses into flashing lightning and culmi- nates as the manifestation of the sun."5 This is precisely what the speaker, a prince of the ruling family of Cordoba and a descendant of 'Abd al- Shams, intends to accomplish with his poetry. With his eloquence, learning, and nobility, he will compose poems that will clothe the reputation of his family in a robe of honor.16 The succeeding images of a light that renews what darkness has obscured, and sustains what rain has revived, gain momentum as the speaker dazzles us with his poetic ability. In his final lines of self-praise, we are convinced that he is the embodiment of the life- giving rain and life-sustaining sun.17 Let us turn to an analysis of the poem's opening lines and how they cor- respond to the lines of the final section of the poem in which the speaker praises himself. If nothing else of this qasidah survived, the opening lines of the nasib would suffice as an indication of Al-Sharif Al-Taliq's poetic genius. The speaker depicts an idealized beloved in language that is replete with imagery common to classical Arabic poetry.'8 The poet weaves his descrip- tions with subtlety and delicacy in an intricate and ethereal pattern. The pat- tern's harmonious whole attests to the poet's lyrical skill. It is no wonder that Garcia Gomez considered these lines to be some of the best examples of Andalusi poetry.19 The poet's praise of the beloved, couched as it is in metaphorical language, removes the object of his praise from the realm of the real to the realm of the ideal. No characteristics that would distinguish the beloved as a specific individual are evident. As Richard Serrano has indicated in his article, the imagery with which the poet describes the beloved is deliberately non-anthropomorphic.20 We may conclude that this idealization of beauty is representative of the nobility (majd) and glory (fakhr) that were once the defining features of the poet's ancestors, rather than the features of the body of the beloved. The language of the corresponding lines of the fakhr section of the poem contrasts sharply with the praise of the beloved. Having established his lyri- cal ability in the three preceding sections of the poem, the speaker boldly proclaims his own noble characteristics in line 35: What noble youth is like me in courage and generosity, in word, in deed, and in piety? 15 Ibid., lines 11, 20, 27, 28, 33. 16 Ibid., lines 36 and 42. 7 To which the poet appears to allude in his naming of his ancestor 'Abd al-Shams (Sun Worshiper). 18 See appendices, lines 1-6. 19 Garcia G6mez, Cinco poetas, 79. 20 Serrano, "Al-Sharif al-Taliq ...," 153. 25</page><page sequence="7">HARRY NEALE The poet describes himself in language that defines the ideal Arab of noble stock in direct and unequivocal terms. The lack of metaphorical lan- guage in these lines informs us that the poet is no longer appealing to our esthetic sensibility, but rather, to our definition of nobility. The conclusion of a poem in the classical Arabic tradition with self-praise is certainly quite conventional. However, this does not exclude this part of the poem from alluding to a more abstract ambition on the part of the poet. As we have already noted, the poet alludes throughout the poem to his self-proclaimed status as renewer of his family's glory. The succeeding lines of the fakhr serve as a resume of his qualifications as the quasi-messianic renewer of his lineage. He returns to the use of metaphor in his stylized portrayal of the attributes that make him worthy of being the one who will bring about this renewal. The poet's statement, "my nobility is my soul [or self]," establishes his aristocratic credentials. The phrase, "my ornaments are my knowledge," informs us that he has the well-rounded education in culture and literature necessary for a man of letters. His assertion that, "my sword is my elo- quence in the encounter," leaves no doubt as to his verbal virtuosity.2' In the subsequent line, he further extols the lambasting capacity of his tongue by comparing it to a "viper which no spells can avert."22 By underscoring the magical nature of his speech, the speaker reaffirms that he has the super- natural attributes necessary to restore the Umayyad family to its former grandeur. In the middle of the fakhr, the speaker proclaims that his generosity has revived the praise that had once been accorded his family, and reminds us that he is the grandson of 'Abd Al-Rahman III, the first caliph of Cordoba and most noble scion of the aristocratic Umayyad family: My right hand is the good fortune of any destitute seeker after largesse; it joined a praise that had come to be scattered. My grandfather is an-Nasir li-d-Din, he whose hands dispersed dispersal from him, The noblest of the noble both in himself and in his ancestors when they rival with him in superiority, the loftiest in rank. Thus, the poet subtly associates himself with the caliph who brought sta- bility and order to al-Andalus when he suppressed the warring factions and forced them to accept him as their ruler.23 This reassertion of the poet's lin- eage prepares us for his final declaration in which he avows that he is the 21 See appendices, line 36. 22 Ibid., line 37. 23 Marshall G.

We shall first examine the five longer fragments in relation to the qasidah and then turn our attention to the seven shorter ones. The qaslidah, which is also assembled from fragments, will serve as our frame of reference for the analysis of the other fragments, since the qasidah presents the most com- plete embodiment of the imagery and vocabulary of al-Sharif al-Taliq's poetry. The first fragment is included in Ibn Abbar's al-Hullah al-siyard'.25 This is the most pessimistic poem in the diwdn, a fact which would lead us to suspect that it was composed during the poet's imprisonment: Indeed, Fate, which obliterates all that we build, Will be afflicted just as it afflicts us And will perish as it causes us to perish. As for success in this world, it is success insofar as The youth who reaps benefit in it, does so by deceit. The pleasure of happiness in this world will be requited with misery And Death will reap that which his hand has reaped. There is no doubt that sadness will reach its zenith But the mind of man foolishly thinks otherwise.26 The speaker rails against the vicissitudes of life and the injustice of death in this poem. However, he intimates that Death and Fate will also meet their demise. In an Islamic context, this no doubt alludes to the End of Time and the Day of Judgment. In the context of the qasldah, the imagery of the destruction and ruin wrought by fortune and death recalls the waning glory of the Umayyad house which al-Sharif al-Taliq seeks to renew through his poetry.27 The first five lines of the next poem, also included in al-Hullah al-siyard', are replete with Islamic imagery.28 Following this section, the poet describes his beloved using standard lunar imagery: I say, while my tears pour forth abundantly And an agonizing, burning desire has stirred in my breast, Enough of seemly patience, for indeed, I have seen the beauty of patience wax repulsive in love. Verily, the Feast of the Sacrifice has provoked in me a desperate passion; 24 See appendices, lines 41 and 42. 25 1: 221. 26 For Arabic text see appendix B [2]. 27 See appendices, line 41. 28 1: 222. 27</page><page sequence="9">HARRY NEALE The loathsome fate of these beasts is restful to my soul, For it is as if the throat of every slaughtered beast is in my eyes and its heart in my breast when they slaughter it. Oh would that I knew if my lord had something with which to remedy in me a wounded heart That yearns for a full moon on whose cheek There is a rose in full bloom in place of a dark blemish. The full moon veils her face upon ascending For fear that one will approach her at night and disgrace her,29 Thus said I to her: 0 moon, unveil yourself, For a spy from our enemies has already appeared, and will not go. By my life, that moon is more lovely to look upon, more beautiful, more graceful, Than the full moon.30 With the words, "Enough of seemly patience," (da'uni min al-sabri al- jamili) the poet echoes Jacob in the surah of Yfisuf contained in the Qur'an, in which Jacob replies to the treachery of his sons with the phrase, "patience is seemly" (fa-sabrun jamilun).3 This oft-quoted phrase, coupled with the speaker's tears and anguish, is the result of his having lost the one he loves. The speaker thus identifies with Jacob who has lost his beloved son, Joseph. Unlike Jacob however, the speaker goes on to ridicule patience in the hemistich that follows, by declaring that patience may grow loathsome when love is unrequited. In the third and fourth lines, the speaker turns to the gory imagery of slaughtered beasts during the Feast of the Sacrifice ('id al-adhd) which concludes the Islamic month of Dhu '7-Hijjah. The suffering of the animals mirrors the speaker's own distress at not being near his beloved. The transition point of the poem is contained in the fifth line, wherein the speaker asks rhetorically whether God will cure his wounded heart that suf- fers because of a moon-faced beauty. In the second half of the poem, which follows the speaker's rhetorical question, we encounter the poet's descrip- tion of the beloved as a moon. In these lines, the poet returns to a concept of beauty that is similar to the description of the beloved that we find in the nasib of his qasidah. As in the qasidah, the poet's language locates the beloved in the realm of ideal beauty, couched in the tropes and topoi that are common to classical Arabic poetry.32 The third fragment is found in Maqqari's Nafh al-tib.33 The fragment is 29 Qadaha may also mean "to eclipse" as well as "to disgrace," a play on words that is lost in translation. 30 See appendix B [3]. 31 Qur'an, 12: 18, 83. 32 See appendices, lines 1-6. 33 Ahmad b.

It seemed that even the sun complained of passionate love for her And that the doves cooed plaintively on account of their love for her. The crepuscule wastes away from her absence As if it suffers what I suffer. The breeze has come recounting what was between us; It wastes away from love and its fragrance is pleasant. Nor is the garden, moistened by her dew at dawn, More fragrant than her memory. The blossom is her smile, her scent the zephyr, And the rose, moistened with dew, her cheeks. Thus, I am enamored of gardens, for they Always remind me of whom I love.34 The four important motifs that recur in this poem and the qasidah are: the speaker's identification with the sun as a reviving force, emaciation, dew, and the non-anthropomorphic description and idealization of the beloved's body with garden/botanical imagery. The poem begins with the speaker's bidding farewell to his beloved at twilight. His happiness is coterminous with the waning of the day. As night falls, he is left forsaken and dejected. The sun, with whom the speaker identifies throughout the qasidah (e.g., I am the glory of the descendents of 'Abd al-Shams), seems to share his grief as its light grows dim and it sinks below the horizon, thereby leaving the world in a death-like darkness. Thus, we encounter a reversal of the events that occur in the qasidah, in which, the sun rises and wraps the garden, "in a cloak... consisting of its own light."35 In contrast to the beloved, whom the speaker describes in this poem and throughout the Diwdn in non-anthro- pomorphic terms, the crepuscule and zephyr are anthropomorphized when he describes them as wasting away from passionate longing. Their emaciation recalls the portrayal of the beloved's waist in the nasib of the qasidah as being, "... so slender that I thought, from the degree of its thinness, that it was madly in love."36 In the last three lines dealing with this theme, the sun returns with the dawn, while life is restored to the garden. The importance of dew as a symbol of fertility and revivification in Arabic poetry is affirmed in both the qasidah and this brief nawriyah. The dawn and the dew-moistened garden revive in the speaker the memory of his beloved, 34 See appendix B [4]. 35 See appendices, line 27. 36 Ibid., line 7. 29</page><page sequence="11">HARRY NEALE thereby giving him comfort. The speaker then sees the garden as the embod- iment of the beloved: a blossom becomes her smile, the zephyr her fra- grance, and a dew-moistened rose her cheeks. These lines recall the first line of the nasib of the qasidah in which the speaker first evokes the standard trope of a branch rising from a sand dune as a metaphorical image of a slender waist and ample hips. His subsequent paean to the beloved's body in lines two through five of the qasidah results in the branch's bringing forth leaves. Thus, the speaker displays his poetic ability by transforming, in the qasidah, a human into a verdant bough and, in this nawriyyah, a garden into a beautiful individual. In the fourth fragment, also found in Nafh. al-tib, we encounter imagery shared by the brief nawriyah and qasidah: Oh, what an evening, like the morning of a holiday Uniting both joy and melancholy: The breeze blew in it like a lover Borrowing the good qualities of the beloved. I passed it between two suns, one Rising and the other setting. The crepuscular sun was coy in granting its favors, however, My sun did not cease shining above our hearts. O Lord, you created this as something marvelous! Who has seen the sun rising on a bough? Oh the times in which fate was kind, And fulfilled our heart's desires: We whiled away the time in drinking and intimacy And filled it with grave sins, When the face of happiness was unconfined in its joy And showed no sign of a frown. May God destroy him who wastes time in vexations and intrigues! The opening lines of the poem correspond to the motif of separation encountered in the preceding nawriyah. Again, the speaker identifies the twi- light with separation from his beloved and the dawn with reunification in the form of a pleasant recollection. The breeze of the shorter nawriyah returns, bearing a memory of a lover and his beloved. In the third and fourth lines, we return to the image of the sun as the reviver and sustainer of life, an image that figures in the nawriyah of the qasidah.37 In this fragment, the sun that never ceases casting its warm rays on the heart of the speaker is the beloved, rather than the actual sun that departs every evening. The fifth line of this fragment harkens back to the image of the branch and subse- quent encomium of the beloved's body in the nasib.38 The metaphor of the 37 Ibid. [5] and line 28. 38 Ibid., lines 1-6. 30</page><page sequence="12">THE DIWAN OF AL-SHARIF AL-TALIQ sun shining upon the bough and thereby accentuating the bough's beauty recalls the poet's praise that causes the branch to bear leaves. The second half of the fragment returns to key themes of the khamrfyah and addresses fate.39 The speaker in line six suggests that his former good fortune has departed, leaving him forsaken. His misfortune leads him to begin reminiscing about the joyous times spent drinking and carousing with his beloved. The poem concludes with the speaker calling upon God to avenge his current misfor- tune by destroying those who rendered him unhappy with their scheming. The fifth fragment, found in Ibn al-Jawzi's Dhamm al-hawd,40 was not included in Garcla G6mez's article. The first translation of this fragment appeared in Teresa Garulo's article, "El principe Amnistiado en el damm al- hawa de Ibn al-Jawzi."41 In this fragment, the speaker laments his fate in a manner similar to that encountered in the first fragment. The overt refer- ences to shackles and loneliness recall his long imprisonment: Death is more favorable than my present state. The least of my afflictions is my separation from family and wealth. I do not complain of God, but rather to Him. Indeed, how often do I weep while my sadness Is renewed without being worn out. My tongue and hands have become my feet's companions, Fettered, unable to utter a word or stir. In a tomb where my death is twofold; A forgotten death without distinction. Indeed, before me, no lion has suffered the tightness of shackles, Nor did they inter him among mountain goats. Each day brings misfortunes that Neither mind nor fancy ever contemplated. Every condition changes but mine changes not, And I do not live because Life seems to me more laudable; Rather, I live because Death is more alive to me. And how has it been allowed that this, my era, Should see me deprived of everything, When it is adorned with my glory? And how mighty is my time when I am so despised? And how abject is my nobility the day of my debasement? Oh would that I knew if a time will come, In whose days the superiority of a superior man will be revealed.42 39 Ibid., lines 11-17 and [2]. 40 bn al-Jawzi, Dhamm al-hawa (Cairo: Dar al-Kutub al-Hadithah, 1962), 462-463. 41 Teresa Garulo, "El Principe Amnistiado en el damm al-hawa de Ibn al-Jawzi", El Legado marroqui y Andalusi: la documentaci6n y la lectura, (Tetuan: Universidad Abdelmalek es- Saadi, n.d.), 49-57. 42 See appendix B [6]. 31</page><page sequence="13">HARRY NEALE The tone of this fragment is the antithesis of the fakhr section of the qasidah, in which the speaker declares himself the noble reviver of Umayyad glory. Although he alludes to his patrician and quasi-messianic status in the last lines, the prominent topic of this fragment is his degrada- tion, which he attributes to capricious fortune. The speaker longs for his family, friends, and material comforts, in addition to glory and the recogni- tion of his literary accomplishments that are his due. In the fakhr section of the qasidah, the speaker wins renown through his skill as a poet, thereby vindicating the assertion of his superiority that he declares in the last line of this fragment. In his Nafh. al-tib, al-Maqqari introduces the sixth fragment with a brief khabar, the authenticity of which is questionable, as the account could just as easily have been deduced from the poem itself. Nevertheless, the anec- dote presented in the khabar relates that al-Sharif al-Taliq was the guest of a relation of his, a notable of the Banfu Marwan. The host presented the poet with a chalice of silver containing golden wine and said to him: "Drink and declaim, for your host is your cousin!" The poet rose respectfully, drank a toast to his host's happiness, and then called for ink and paper on which he wrote the following fragment: Drink heartily, may pleasure not pass you by, The drink of a noble gentleman Who has brought you wine that is clothed In twilight's raiment fringed with bubbles, In a chalice in which no wine has been poured, Save for noblemen of illustrious glory. He did not err when he gave you to drink from his hand Liquid gold in solid silver. Rise gladly in obeisance to him And drink that his memory may endure forever!43 Here we encounter imagery shared with the khamriyah and fakhr sections of the qasidah. The description of the wine recalls the khamriyah in which, "Many a cup [of wine] dressed the ... gloom with a cloak of light from its flash," and then, "shone... like the sun's rays as they meet the dawn.""44 The wine, dressed in a crepuscular gown, illuminates the nobility of the poet who describes himself as a nobleman of illustrious glory. Here, we may recapitulate his declarations made in the fakhr section of the qasidah in which, he proclaims himself, "the noblest of the noble both in himself and in his ancestors," and "the glory of the descendants of 'Abd al-Shams.. .,4s 43 Ibid.

Although the speaker concludes by praising his host, the poem is unequivocally another example of self-praise. The remainder of the diwdn consists of seven short fragments, each com- posed of four hemistiches. Despite their brevity, many of these fragments offer succinct recapitulations of motifs encountered in the qasidah, shorter poems, and khabar of al-Dabbi. The khabar with which Ibn al-Abbar intro- duces the seventh fragment in Al-Hullah al-siyard' states that the poet com- posed the fragment as a description of his prison cell: In a room like the coal-black night Of somber contours and gloomy core. It is black, and al-Zahra' encircles it with light Like ink placed in an ivory inkwell.46 The contrast between oppressive darkness and illuminating light encapsu- lates the topos of darkness and dawn as a metaphor of isolation and despair. The isolation and despair may only be dispelled by the appearance of the beloved throughout al-Sharif al-Taliq's diwdn. The eighth fragment reiterates the topos of darkness and light in a manner akin to that of Imru' al-Qays when he addresses the seemingly eternal night: Indeed, you interminable night, will you not move on, so that dawn may appear? However, dawn is no better than you are. Indeed, what a night you are! It seems as if the stars were bound with flaxen ropes to massive slabs of granite.47 The speaker anxiously hopes for the return of his beloved who, as in the fragments discussed above, is portrayed as the dawn: What ails my dawn? Her footsteps should be drawing nigh, But she tarries so that I despair of her coming. It is as if the darkness has bound the night's stars, And has detained them in a place whence they cannot stir.48 The same topos alludes to the fundamental motif of the qasidah, that of the speaker's identification with the sun as a life-giving force symbolizing his status as renewer of Umayyad glory by means of his resplendent poetry.49 46 Ibid. [8]. 47 Al-Zawzani, Sharh al-Mu'allaqdt al-Sab' (Beirut: Maktabah al-Ma'arif, 1994), 39. ala ayyuha l-laylu 1-tawilu ala anjali bi-subhin wa ma l-asbahu min-ka bi-amthali fa-ya laka min laylin ka-anna nujufmahu bi-amrasi kattinin ila summi jandali. 48 See appendix B [9]. 49 Ibid., lines 41 and 42. 33</page><page sequence="15">HARRY NEALE The ninth fragment further alludes to the endless night in the mu'allaqah of Imru' al-Qays with its imagery of the stars' immobility and the speaker's direct reference to the celebrated pre-Islamic poet: It is an abode for whose inhabitants the stars sit still, Fickle fate has pierced them dexterously with her arrows. It happened so long ago, It seems it were the ancient abode of Imru' al-Qays in 'As'asa.5° Fortune is again portrayed as capricious and malevolent, which would sug- gest that al-Sharif al-Taliq composed this fragment while in prison. Indeed, the recurrent, almost obsessive, motif of oppressive and interminable dark- ness that plagues the speaker in the fragments throughout the diwdn may ultimately stem from his long imprisonment in a gloomy prison cell, as described in the khabar preceding the qasidah. The tenth fragment's imagery of a rainstorm corresponds to the nawriyah of the qasidah: The cloud is like an ardent lover Indeed, burning and suffering are in its thunder, And the lightning is like the fire of his passion, And the rain, like his tears that flow when he weeps.5' In both poems, we encounter the anthropomorphization of the cloud, thunder, and lightning. However, in the nawriyah, the cloud behaves as a cupbearer whose waters revive the garden, while the lightning illuminates the trajectory of the planets on a dark night.52 The beneficent role of the lightning and cloud in the qasidah contrasts with the thunderstorm's depic- tion in the fragment as the ardent lover pining after his beloved. The eleventh fragment seems to suggest the nasib of a traditional qasidah in which the speaker encounters an abandoned campsite that causes him to halt and reflect upon a past love: I remained alone in the courtyards after them, Bewildered in unfamiliar quarters; It was as though they were the abodes of Mayya when they became empty And I were Ghaylan reciting [poetry] in them.53 This oft-encountered trope is presented here in the urban guise of the empty courtyards and living quarters of an abandoned home.

'Uqba (d. 735- 736) by suggesting reflection upon happier times.54 In light of the primary motif of the qasidah, it may be possible to read this fragment as a meta- phorical allusion to the waning glory of the Umayyad dynasty which the speaker proposes to revive with his poetry, as suggested by the image of Ghaylan in the fourth hemistich. The twelfth fragment recalls lines 12 and 13 of the khamriyah in which the sleepy cupbearer is kept awake by the glance of the speaker who plies him with wine: The pupils of her eyes Seem, from confusion, to be like one given to wine-drinking. It is no man but rather, It is Harfits living in her eye.56 The girl's pupils move about in a manner that attests to her bewilderment, thus causing her to appear as if she were drunk. The description of the fallen angel Haruit in her eye suggests that someone is attempting to seduce her.57 The subtle indication of the speaker's intention to seduce the cup- bearer in line 12 of the qasidah presents a parallel image. The final short fragment depicts the beauty of running water in a manner that recalls the water imagery of the nawriyah in the qasidah: It is as though there were silvery serpents in the waters Rushing forth into the gullies, And as though the pebbles in the glittering water, Were sparkling pearls on a white neck.58 54 Ghaylan b. 'Uqba, whose cognomen is Dhu 'l-Rummah, was one of the great figures in the tradition of eastern Umayyad Arabic poetry. He was reputed to have been in love with a woman named Mayya who was married to a rich sayyid. He composed many poems which he dedicated to her and in which he lamented his separation from her. 55 According to the Qur'an, the angels once scoffed at men for their weakness in the face of sin. God challenged them to do better if lured by the same earthly temptations. Harit and Marut were chosen for the trial. They were admonished to avoid the sins of idolatry, drink- ing of wine, fornication, and murder. Shortly after their arrival on earth, they were captivated by a beautiful woman and succeeded in obtaining her favors. At the moment when she was about to fulfill their desires, they were unexpectedly discovered. They killed the man who had witnessed their transgression. God gave them the choice of punishment on earth or eternal damnation. They chose the former and were imprisoned and suspended by their feet in a well in Babylon. G. Vadja, "Harut and Mairut," Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd ed, vol. 3 (Leiden and New York: E. J. Brill, 1979), 236-237. 56 See appendix B [13]. 57 This is a pun, lost in translation: insdn al-'ayn (the man of the eye) is the Arabic idiom used to describe the pupil of the eye. 58 See appendix B [14]. 35</page><page sequence="17">HARRY NEALE A close reading of the qasidah and fragments reveals that the poet con- sistently returns to the same imagery and motifs. The last two lines of the qasidah are critical to an understanding of the poet's aims. The poet is indeed determined to do as he states in the concluding lines of the fakhr. With his poetry, he will revive the flagging glory of the Arabic poetic tra- dition and the declining reputation of the Umayyad house. The recurring imagery of revivification, fertility, and illumination links each section of the qasidah to the other poems and fragments of his diwan and, ultimately to his final statement in the fakhr. As an ensemble, the compositions provide an original and creative unity that underscores al-Sharif al-Taliq's self-pro- claimed status as prince of poets.

A branch which sways on a rounded sand dune, and from which my heart gath- ers a [harvest of] fire, 2. [Is such that] beauty causes a never-waning moon to arise from his face. 3. He charms [us] with the intensely white and black eyes of a white antelope whose glance is an arrow notched [to be aimed] at my heart; 4. He smiles from a necklace of pearls, so that I thought he wrested it from [our] necks [to adorn] his gums. 5. The lam described by the hair of his temples flowed down over his cheek as gold flows over silver plate. 6. Thus beauty reached its maximum proportions in him, [for] a branch becomes beautiful only when it has borne leaves. 7. His waist is so slender that I thought, from the degree of its thinness, that it was madly in love. 8. It is as though the hips had caught [the waist] in love's snares so that [the lat- ter] had become troubled and anxious over [the former]. 9. Being thin from emaciation it came along and attacked [the hips] which were in a state of ample luxury, like my beloved when she tarries in my embrace, 10. While it is wondrous indeed, if they both resemble us, that they have not begun to part and that they have not both been separated. 11. Many a cup which dressed the wing of gloom with a tunic of light which shone from its flash, 12. Did I spend the night offering to drink to a young gazelle in whose glance there was a sleepy languor the sight of my eye kept awake. 13. [The cup] hid itself from the eye until I thought that it feared from his glance what was feared [by us]. 14. [Then] it shone in a certain pure [receptacle] consisting of the palm of his hand, like the sun's rays as they meet the dawn. 15. It is as though the cup, in his fingers, were a yellow narcissus rising from a sliver [vase], 16. Which arose like a sun, his mouth being the West, and the hand of the shy cup- bearer, the East, 17. So that when it set in his mouth, it left a [rosy] twilight on his cheek. 18. And many a cloud sending forth rain is such that its showers are a drinking companion to the garden, for it sings and pours out drink. 19. Moreover, it is as though the earth were its jail and as though the plants were a criminal who has been imprisoned. 20. The lightning clothes [the cloud's] sides with its glittering brocade robe when it flashes, 21. And it is as though the dark thundercloud in it were a black [horse] on whom [the lightning] has cast a motley hue, 22. And as though the wind, when it blows along [that horse] starts a flock of mag- pies consisting of [its own substance] into the flight. 59 The fragments and line 26 of the qasidah are my translations. The entire translation of the qasidah (line 26 excluded) is that of James Monroe, from pages 154-159 of book, Hispano-Arabic Poetry: A Student Anthology (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1974). 37</page><page sequence="19">HARRY NEALE 23. On certain nights of which the planets wander astray, losing their way without being able to distinguish their orbits, 24. The lightning lights up its lantern for them so that the face of their gloom turns into a sunrise, 25. While the thunder softly mourns, so that the cups of the rain flow over [the gar- den] exuding moisture. 26. And [the garden] becomes drunk imbibing, and begins leaning over like one deep in his cups and falls to the ground [as if] cast aside. 27. The sun rose, weaning [the garden] having wrapped it in a cloak which sub- merges it, consisting of its own light. 28. Thus it is as though the sun which revives [the garden's] breath were the bright- ness of the beloved reviving the lover burning with desire, 29. and as if the rose, covered with dew, were the cheek of the beloved sprinkled with drops of perspiration, 30. Which bursts open beside a pure yellow narcissus, that I thought was conceal- ing a tender love for the rose, 31. Like two lovers intimately joined together, of whom the one appears [blushing] with shame while the other is [pale] with fear. 32. How lovely are they, namely certain stars of the garden that have risen to the horizon from their flowerbeds. 33. And gazed with delight from it at the morning [like] flower pupils which ensnare [our] pupils. 34. It is as though the rain, when it flowed generously upon [the starflowers], came to deposit drops of quicksilver on their petals. 35. What noble youth is like me in courage and generosity, in word, in deed, and in piety? 36. My nobility is my own soul; my ornaments are my knowledge, and in the encounter my sword is my eloquence, 37. Because, for him who tries it, my tongue is a viper which no spells can avert. 38. My right hand is the good fortune of any destitute seeker after largesse; it joined a praise that had come to be scattered. 39. My grandfather is an-Nasir li-d-Din, he whose hands dispersed dispersal from him, 40. The noblest of the noble both in himself and in his ancestors when they rival with him in superiority, the loftiest in rank. 41. It is I who am the glory of the descendants of 'Abd ash-Shams, while by me the worn-out portion of their glory is renewed. 42. It is I who clothe in splendor the worn-out portion of their illustrious lineage with the ornaments of my resplendent poetry. [2] The following two fragments are from a manuscript of Sharif al-Rundi's al-Wafi fi nazm al-qawafi, a treatise on rhetoric and poetry that Garcia G6mez found among the Gayangos collection in the Royal Academy of History in Madrid. Al-Rundi cited the first fragment as an example of improvisation and the second as an exam- ple of the opening lines of a qasidah: One of my masters related: Al-Sharif al-Taliq was a good improviser and a quick-witted man of spontaneous genius. Once, he met a youth who was jest- ing with him and towards whom he felt some affection. The latter handed him 38</page><page sequence="20">THE DIWAN OF AL-SHARIF AL-TALIQ 39 a stone, saying to him: "If you are a poet, say something about this." He improvised thus: This piece of inanimate rock that scarcely fits in my hand, Has the hardness of the heart of him whom I adore and the inflexibility of the miser's hand. I threw it at my adversary, who fell to the ground, the same as if I had wielded my polished saber with its sharp edges. When people lack weapons, I know that I will be able to find mine on any road. Among the beautiful opening lines of qasa'id is the following attributed to al- Sharif al-Taliq: There is no better armor against one's enemies than fleeing.</page><page sequence="21">I;; ' r Ls Gj C [ L * " .I - _ L. iu. - . c .
