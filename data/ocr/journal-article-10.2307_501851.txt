<plain_text><page sequence="1">News Letter from Greece EUGENE VANDERPOOL PLATES 73-76 There have been some outstanding discoveries in the past year. Early Palaeolithic remains have been found in the Larissa area in Thessaly, below the bed of the prehistoric lake. A remarkable anthropo- morphic stele, probably prehistoric, was found in the same district. In a Mycenaean tholos tomb at Marathon a pair of horses was found buried in the dromos, evidently sacrificed in the course of the funeral ceremony. The archaic Castalian fountain at Delphi has been discovered. A small sanctuary, probably that of Artemis Aristoboule founded by Themistokles, was found in Athens. At Brauron in Attica many fine classical reliefs and statues and an interesting fifth century inscription were dis- covered. At Olympia a drinking cup belonging to Pheidias was found. From Pheneos in Arcadia comes a colossal head of an acrolithic statue made by Attalos, son of Lachares, of Athens. The Oracle of the Dead in Thesprotia has been identified. ATHENS AND ATTICA MUSEUMS. In the Acropolis Museum three gal- leries of archaic sculpture have been opened to the public. They contain the poros pediment groups and many of the korai. The National Museum has opened five galleries of archaic sculpture containing many kouroi, grave reliefs and other pieces. An interesting experiment is a full sized reproduction in color of the well known painted stele of Lyseas which has been placed beside the rather faded origi- nal (Richter, Archaic Attic Gravestones fig. 94). In another gallery some of the recent discoveries at Brauron are already on display: see below. SANCTUARY OF ARTEMIS. The remains of a small temple were discovered by chance in the course of construction of a modern house just west of Kolo- nos Agoraios along the road leading to the Piraeus Gates (W. Judeich, Topographie von Athen', Plan I, D 4: at the short blunt end of the first block). Mr. Threpsiades conducted an excavation which revealed the plan of a small temple in antis facing west (pl. 74, figs. 4-5). The porch and the threshold block of the door were well preserved and the walls of the cella could be traced. The foundation for the altar which stood in front of the temple was found, and the poros altar itself was lying nearby. An inscribed stele that had been re-used in a late remodelling of the sanctuary contains a decree of the fourth century B.c. passed by the demesmen of Melite (the deme in which the sanctuary is ac- tually located) in honor of Neoptolemos, son of An- tikles, of Melite, a very wealthy Athenian known from the orations of Demosthenes. The decree con- tains the provision that it be set up in the sanctuary of Artemis. The sanctuary in which it was found is clearly then a sanctuary of Artemis, and may well be the famous sanctuary of Artemis Aristoboule which Themistokles established near his house in Melite and which was still standing in Plutarch's time (Life of Themistokles 22). PLATO'S ACADEMY. Mr. Stavropoulos has continued his work in the section to the west of the main areas excavated before the war (AJA 61 [1957] 282). His principal topographical discovery is a long stretch of enclosure wall which he has uncovered for a distance of about 130 meters but which continues both to north and south. It is not straight, but bends slightly at several points, evidently to enclose a large area lying to the east of it, i.e. the Academy. The wall is about o.6o m. wide, and 0.50 m. high, and what is preserved is evidently a socle for a super- structure of mud brick. There are buttresses at in- tervals of about 6.50 m. along the outer face of the wall. Various styles of construction are to be noted in different sections of the wall showing that it was kept in repair over a long period, but Mr. Stavro- poulos believes that the oldest sections go back to the sixth century B.c. The wall will thus be the Wall of Hipparchos recorded by Suidas, s.v. r? I7Ira'rdpXov 'reLXtov. This wall had been built around the Acad- emy by Hipparchos, the son of Peisistratos the ty- rant, at great expense which he compelled the peo- ple of Athens to defray; it thus became proverbial for any expensive project. At a point just inside the wall of Hipparchos part of a small building was uncovered. In the ground near it lay about a hundred inscribed slabs and fragments of slabs of most unusual form. They are of slate-like stone and are irregular in size and shape. Most of them have a hole for suspension near</page><page sequence="2">280 EUGENE VANDERPOOL [AlA 63 one edge. They resemble schoolboy's slates, and, in fact, this is what Mr. Stavropoulos believes them to be. The letters are scratched on lightly with a sharp instrument and in many cases can be quite easily rubbed off. The slates may be dated in the fifth century B.c. by pottery found in the layer with them as well as by the fact that the letters show a mixture of Attic and Ionic forms. A peculiarity of spelling which occurs on several plaques is the substitution of iota for eta, as for example on one of the largest plaques where we read the names of the gods AOINA APIS APTEMI and underneath the name of the pupil AIMOVOOENIX (pl. 75, fig. II). LONG WALLS. A section of the northern Long Wall between Athens and Piraeus was exposed when a deep drain was dug in Cyprus Street two or three hundred meters northwest of the Kallithea station of the electric railway. Mr. Mastrokostas investi- gated. Remains belonging to various periods were noted in different places. Most characteristic was a section of polygonal limestone which had originally served as a socle for a superstructure of mud brick. This belongs to the Kononian reconstruction of the early fourth century B.c. In our photograph (pl. 75, fig. 8) the original mud brick has been replaced by rubble and mortar construction of Roman times. BRAURON. Mr. Papadimitriou excavated again at Brauron on the east coast of Attica, concentrating on the level area north of the temple where he had discovered a stoa in an earlier campaign (Praktika [1950] 177-87). The results were astonishing. The stoa proved to have been crowded with votive of- ferings standing in two or three rows against the back wall between the doors leading into the rooms behind. Many of these votives were found lying as they had fallen when the stoa was destroyed. There were numerous marble reliefs, some of them of out- standing quality (pl. 73, figs. I and 2), and also several statues and many heads of young girls, no doubt the "arktoi" or "bears" who took part in the ceremonies. Many architectural members belonging to the stoa were also found lying as they had fallen. One of the most interesting discoveries was a com- plete inscribed stele of the year of the archon Arim- nestos (416/415 B.C.) recording the transfer of the treasures of the sanctuary from Brauron to the Acropolis, no doubt for greater safety as the re- newal of the Peloponnesian War and the expedition to Sicily were impending. The transfer was in the charge of one Demetrios of Halai. See also ILN for October 25, I958. MARATHON. The Mycenaean tholos tomb excavated in the nineteen thirties by the late Professor Soteri- ades has been the scene of further work (Praktika [1935] 105; AA [1935] 179-81). In the previous ex- cavations only the chamber, the doorway and the immediately adjacent part of the dromos had been cleared. Now the whole dromos has been opened up. Only a short section near the door is lined with masonry, the rest is simply cut out of hard-pan. As the tomb lies in the open plain where the ground is almost flat, the dromos is as much as 25 meters long and slopes quite steeply downward. Near its outer end a remarkable discovery was made. The skele- tons of two horses were found neatly laid out in a shallow pit, their heads towards the outer end of the dromos, their backs towards the sides and their legs interlocking in the center (pl. 74, fig. 6). They had clearly been sacrificed here as part of the funeral ceremony. The missing upper part of the cupola of the tomb has been restored. PELOPONNESOS GALATAKI. Mr. Verdelis has excavated for two sea- sons at Galataki, a village in the northeastern Pelo- ponnesos five kilometers from Kenchreai, Corinth's port on the Saronic Gulf. The village occupies the site of the ancient Solygeia which was the scene of a battle in the Peloponnesian War (Thucydides 4.42). About 300 meters west of the village the ruins of an apsidal building were discovered. Two periods could be distinguished, one of the second half of the eighth century B.c., the other of the early sixth; it was destroyed and abandoned in the early fifth century. The building was probably a temple, if we may judge from the F[]-shaped foundation near the apse, which is probably the place where the cult statue stood, and from the votive deposit found nearby. The votives had been buried in a ruined Mycenaean chamber tomb. About iooo small vases were found and about 50 figurines. They range in date from late geometric times to the early fifth century B.c. Their character suggests that they were dedications to Hera. PHENEOS. At the village of Kalyvia in the Pheneos basin (northeastern Arcadia), which probably occu- pies the site of the ancient city of Pheneos, a chance discovery of considerable interest was made. Miss Protonotariou followed up with an investigation.</page><page sequence="3">1959] NEWS LETTER FROM GREECE 281 Part of an ancient building was cleared. In one of its rooms, which had a mosaic floor with zones of decoration on it, there was found a large base built of squared blocks. The base bears the following inscription: EHI IEPEZ1, TOT AZKAAHIOT OHPIAAOT TOT HPI,,IAA KATEZKET1 OH TA APAAMATA ATTAAO02 AAXAPOT AOHNAIO2 EIIOIHO2EN Fragments of the statues mentioned in the in- scription were found on and near the base. They were colossal acrolithic statues. A female head in marble (ht. 0.80 m.) is in almost perfect condition with its inset eyes and eyelashes still in place (pl. 76, fig. 13). Several colossal feet were also found (pl. 76, fig. 12). The statues probably represented Asklepios and Hygeia. They date from Hellenistic times, perhaps the second century B.c. LERNA. Mr. Caskey made supplementary investiga- tions of limited extent at the prehistoric site of Lerna. A building designated as BG, parts of which had been observed in 1957 (Hesperia 27 [1958] 130 and fig. I), was examined further. It proves to have been another edifice of palatial size, almost certainly a precursor of the great Early Helladic palace known as the House of the Tiles. The plan appar- ently comprised a row of large rooms flanked on either side by corridors and is thus in general the same as that of the later palace. OLYMPIA. Some supplementary digging was done in the area of the Workshop of Pheidias and a re- markable discovery was made: a drinking cup be- longing to Pheidias himself and identified by an inscription incised on it under side which reads FEIMIO EIMI (pl. 75, figs. 9 and io). Black glazed mugs of this type are common in the second half of the fifth century B.c. but do not occur before the middle of the century: cf. Hesperia 22 (i953) 79, nos. 44 and 45 and the references given there. A fragment of a marble sima belonging to the Temple of Zeus and still retaining traces of color was found in a well of the fourth century B.c. This adds another item to the already large mass of evidence indicating that the temple was extensively repaired in the fourth century. The work of remaking the stadium is well ad- vanced. The south embankment has been com- pleted, the track is largely cleared and work has begun on the north embankment. CENTRAL AND NORTHERN GREECE EUTRESIS. Mr. and Mrs. Caskey conducted a sup- plementary excavation of the earliest strata at Eu- tresis in Boeotia at the suggestion of Miss Hetty Goldman, who had excavated the site in 1924-1927. Their purpose was to gain further information about the first inhabitants, and specifically to de- termine whether the site had been occupied in Neolithic times. A trench i m. long and 4 m. wide was laid out, and the excavation was carried down through suc- cessive layers of Early Helladic times. Towards the bottom several cobbled pavements belonging to the earliest E.H. phase were encountered. Below the lowest of these, in several cavities in the virgin soil, abundant fragments of Neolithic wares were found (pl. 76, fig. 14). These include fine black sherds with burnished pattern in reserved panels and frag- ments of vessels in light colored wares with designs in dull paint of one or two darker colors. A few sherds were coated with red-brown glaze (Urfirnis), and fragments of two steatopygous terracotta figu- rines were found. These earliest deposits, purely Neolithic in character, were tightly sealed by the pavements that passed over them and can therefore be taken as conclusive evidence of habitation on the site in Neolithic times. AULIS. Mr. Threpsiades did a little further exca- vation at Aulis where two years ago he discovered the famous temple of Artemis (AJA 61 [ 957] 283- 84). In front of the temple he found a spring, no doubt that beside which the Greeks sacrificed be- fore setting out for Troy "under a beautiful plane tree whence sparkling water flowed" (Homer, Iliad 2.305ff). The spring is enclosed in a small rectangu- lar basin and is reached by a flight of six steps. An ample supply of good drinking water still flows into the basin. DELPHI. The archaic Castalian fountain has been discovered. The rock-cut fountain which has always been visible and which is set deeply back into one side of the gorge probably dates from Roman times. The earlier fountain proves to have been lower down beside the road. It was discovered when the modern road was being widened to take care of the ever increasing motor traffic. It lies directly under the road as it was before the recent improvements and at a depth of about four meters (pl. 75, fig. 7). It consists of a poros basin about four meters wide and 0.75 m. from front to back which is fed by a poros channel. In front of this is a rectangular court paved with large slabs of grey limestone. The court was at some later time covered with a thick coat of stucco and apparently turned into a water basin. The all-lead clamps of swallow-tail form used in</page><page sequence="4">282 EUGENE VANDERPOOL [AlA 63 all the poros blocks indicate a date in the sixth century B.c. for the original construction of the foun- tain. Mr. Orlandos is undertaking the publication. THESPROTIA. Mr. Dakaris has located the famous Oracle of the Dead on the Acheron River in Thes- protia where the souls of the dead were called up and consulted; thus the envoys of Periander, tyrant of Corinth, called up the ghost of the tyrant's wife (Herodotos 5.92). It is on the site of the ruined monastery of St. John near the village of Mesopota- mos (formerly Likuresi), where the Kokytos River joins the Acheron, about 4 km. from the sea. Ruins have long been visible here, but no excavation had ever been undertaken so that their extent and char- acter were not known. Mr. Dakaris' excavations have revealed a large precinct, 62 by 46 m., enclosed by a wall of polygonal masonry, and within it a sanctuary 21 m. square. In front of the sanctuary is a dark labyrinth with three vaulted entrances closed by iron gates. The third of these entrances leads to a room 15-35 x 4.40 m. whose walls are preserved to a height of 3.25 m. Beneath this room there is an underground chamber of the same size, its roof, which is the floor of the room above, being supported by 15 stone arches. The complex appears to date from the third century B.c. Such an ag- glomeration of dark winding passages, gates, and an underground chamber are admirably suited to necromancy, and thus the identification of the ruin seems assured. LARISSA AREA. Messrs. Milojcic and Biesantz of the German Institute and Mr. Theocharis, the Ephor of Thessaly, have been active at several places around Larissa. Palaeolithic stone implements and bones of pre- historic animals were found at great depths in soundings made at a dozen or more points. Most significant is the sounding at the Gremnos-Argissa mound on the north bank of the Peneios a few miles above Larissa (earlier reports, AA [19551 I92ff; [1956] i41ff). Excavation has shown that this mound was occupied in Classical times and also in the Bronze Age and in the Neolithic period. The lowest habitation layers belong to a pre-pottery stage of Neolithic. A sounding carried out below this level revealed a number of sterile layers, including one of silt about four meters thick which had evi- dently been laid down on the bottom of the pre- historic lake that once covered a large part of Thes- saly. Under this layer of silt, and thus dating from a time prior to the formation of the lake, Palaeo- lithic stone implements of "Aurignacian" type were found. These indicate human habitation in Thes- saly at a very remote period, some twenty or thirty thousand years ago, far earlier than anything hither- to reported in Greece. The chance discovery of a remarkable anthropo- morphic stele (pl. 74, fig. 3) drew attention to Souphli, a prehistoric mound on the south bank of the Peneios four kilometers northeast of Larissa on the road to Tempe (No. 28 on the map in AM 62 [I9371 pl. 37). The stele is a tall narrow slab of greenish stone about the height of a man and deco- rated on all four of its sides. On the front the main human features are indicated in low relief; feet, arms held across body, breasts. From the neck hangs a sort of necklace indicated by a series of concentric semicircles. The head narrows to a point, and seven small holes symmetrically arranged perhaps stand for the seven natural openings. On the narrow sides of the stele serpents are carved in low relief. On the upper part of the back are decorative patterns. Nothing like this stele has ever been found in Greece, and the nearest parallels are the statue-men- hirs of southern France (V. Gordon Childe, Dawn of European Civilization," 312, fig. 145). Other pos- sible comparisons are suggested by Mr. Biesantz in a preliminary notice of the stele AA (i957) 53ff. The date of the stele is by no means certain. Investiga- tions made in the area after the accidental dis- covery revealed graves of various prehistoric periods, and nothing of later date. At the time the stele was found several small Mycenaean vases were found, evidently from a grave, but the relationship of the stele to the grave and pots could not be determined. Middle Helladic and Neolithic burials were also found nearby. The latter are remarkable since few Neolithic graves are known from any site, and even more remarkable is the fact that they are cremation burials. DEMETRIAS. The ancient theatre of Demetrias near Volo has been partly cleared under the supervision of Mr. Theocharis and with the support of the re- cently founded local Society of Antiquaries. This society is also publishing a periodical, Thessalika, for archaeological and historical studies concerning Thessaly; the first fascicle has already appeared. In the theatre the scene building of Roman times was cleared as well as the orchestra and the lowest rows of seats. An inscribed stele was found contain- ing a well preserved decree of the Koinon of the Magnesians in honor of one Demetrios, son of Orestes, of Demetrias.</page><page sequence="5">1959] NEWS LETTER FROM GREECE 283 STRYME. Messrs. Bakalakis and Andronikos with a group of students from the University of Salonica have done further work at the site which they iden- tify as Stryme (AJA 61 [1957] 285). It lies on a peninsula which runs out into a lagoon southwest of Komotini, Thrace. Remains of houses, cisterns, streets and the fortification wall have been found. The town appears to have been destroyed in the fourth century B.c., and the site was not re-occupied. Among the finds we may note a hoard of 28 silver tetradrachms of Maroneia of the period before 359 B.c. They were found in a bronze pyxis hidden in a chink in a wall. Two different types are repre- sented, one with a prancing horse on the obverse and the inscription EHI ETHOAIO on the reverse (pl. 76, fig. 15), the other with a head of Dionysos on the obverse and MAPNONITEfIN EHI MHTPO- [DA]NEO on the reverse (pl. 76, fig. 16). A nice fragment of a classical grave relief in sandstone was found in the area of the cemetery outside the town (pl. 76, fig. i7). An Attic red-figured pelike was also found in a grave.
