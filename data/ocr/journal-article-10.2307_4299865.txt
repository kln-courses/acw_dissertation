<plain_text><page sequence="1">CENTRAL ASIA AND THE INDO-IRANIAN BORDERLANDS* By Fredrik T. Hiebert and C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky Peabody Museum, Harvard University In this paper recently excavated materials from the late Bronze Age oases of Central Asia are compared to materials from Khurab, Shahdad, and Tepe Yahya in Iran. The occurrence of a specific assemblage of Central Asian finds in burials and cenotaphs on these Iranian sites suggests the movement of people from Central Asia in the early second millennium B.C. We propose that the interaction between the areas is typical of expansive states, and in this case, preliminarily may be correlated with the introduction of the Indo-Iranian language. Over the past decade considerable attention has been devoted to the important archaeological dis- coveries in Soviet Central Asia (Amiet 1986; Ligabue and Salvatore 1989; Sarianidi 1990; Kohl 1984). Dis- cussions pertaining to these archaeological discoveries have focused upon three issues. First, of central import- ance has been the archaeological definition and description of the material remains recovered from the various Bronze Age settlements in the ancient oases of the Kara Kum desert. The oases are called by the better known Classical names of Margiana and Bactria. In Margiana are located the principal Bronze Age sites of Kelleli 3, 4 (Masimov 1981; Udemuradov 1986); Gonur 1, Togolok 1, 21 (Sarianidi 1990); in northern Bactria: Sapalli Depe and Djarkutan (Askarov 1977); in southern Bactria: Dashli 1, 2, 3 (Sarianidi 1977); and in eastern Bactria: Shortughai (Francfort 1989) (Fig. 1). A second issue has been the effort to place the Bronze Age communities of Bactria and Margiana within a chronological framework. Recent refinements in both the analysis of ceramic types and their distribu- tions (Piankova 1989; Hiebert 1992), together with the careful isolation of stratigraphic units of associated materials (Hiebert and Moore 1991) and radiocarbon analyses, have shed new light on our understanding of both the relative and absolute chronology of the Namazga V/VI Periods (Sarianidi 1990; Doulak- hanov, Shchetenko and Tosi 1985; Hiebert 1991a). The chronological picture suggests an internal evolu- tion of Bronze Age communities within the foothill zone of Southern Turkmenistan which reaches back to the Eneolithic period; to the middle of the fourth millennium. In Bactria and Margiana, however, there is only limited evidence for archaeological settlement prior to the end of the third millenium. The earliest Bronze Age agricultural settlements within the Margiana oasis have strong affinities to the Late Namazga V archaeological cultures of Southern Turk- menistan (Udemuradov 1986). Although the reasons for the initial evolution of the settlements in Bactria and Margiana remains unclear, the archaeological evidence suggests the establishment of substantial com- munities in Margiana by 2200 B.C. (Late Namazga V). In the succeeding Namazga VI Period, beginning around 2000 B.C., there is a uniformity of material culture which extends over Bactria and Margiana and is identified on such sites as Gonur 1, Togolok 21, Sapalli and Dashli 3. The distribution of this Bronze Age culture in the Bactrian oases is extensive and uniform. Hiebert (1992; Sarianidi 1987) has recently referred to this rich material culture and related settlement as the Bactrian-Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC). The duration of the BMAC, and its relations to the subsequent Takhirbai Period are unclear. The radiocarbon dates from three building levels at Gonur (south) suggests a duration of no more than 250 years for the BMAC, thus dating to ca. 2100-1750 B.C. Considerable attention has been given to the arch- aeological finds of the BMAC discovered in regions distant from Central Asia. Characteristic objects of the BMAC have been recovered in Iran from Susa (Amiet 1989); Shahdad (Hakemi and Sajjadi 1989); Khina- man (Curtis 1988; Maxwell-Hyslop 1988); Shahr-i Sokhta (Tosi 1983); Hissar (Schmidt 1937; Dyson and Howard 1989), Khurab (Stein 1937), and from Tepe Yahya (illustrated below). Recent archaeological survey in the Dasht Plain and Nowak Band Piedmont, along the western rim of the Makran Mountains in western Pakistan, was undertaken by Roland Besenval (1990) who recovered a number of stamp seals of Central Asian identity. In Baluchistan, BMAC material remains have been recovered from Mehi (Stein 1931); Sibri (Santoni 1984); Quetta (Jarrige and Hassan 1989); Mehrgarh (Jarrige 1985); and Nausharo (Jarrige 1989). The evidence from Sibri and Nausharo indicate a strong Central Asian presence on the edge of the Indus Valley which certainly affected the Indus Civilisation at the end of the Harappan period (Hiebert and Meadow 1992). * This paper is dedicated to the memory of Academician Valery P. Alexeev, late Director of the Institute of Archaeology, Moscow. His enthusiastic support and deep dedication to international collaboration complemented his own fundamental contributions to the science of archaeology and physical anthropology.

Prior to discussing the Central Asian materials from Khurab, Yahya, and Shahdad, illustrated here for the first time, we briefly discuss the various ideas put forth on the nature of the interaction that brought Central Asia and the Indo-Iranian borderlands into signficant contact. First, it must be pointed out that Viktor Sarianidi, whose excavations of BMAC sites (Dashli 3, Togolok 21 and Gonur 1) has done the most to define this complex, continues to hold two positions which we believe are untenable. In his recent book on the Bronze Age of Margiana (Sarianidi 1990) he places the earliest material of the Kelleli Phase (Late Namazga V) and the latest material of the Gonur and Togolok Phase (BMAC) within the second half of the second millen- nium, 1500-1000 B.C. In light of the new radiocarbon dates of BMAC sites (Hiebert 1991a) and the carefully argued comparative stratigraphy for the external parallels of its material culture (Amiet 1986) it is clear that the Kelleli, Gonur and Togolok Phases are to be placed in the last century of the third millennium and the first centuries of the second millennium. For the most recent discussion of the chronology, ceramics, architecture, and ecological setting of the BMAC, as</page><page sequence="3">CENTRAL ASIA AND THE INDO-IRANIAN BORDERLANDS 3 defined at Gonur Depe, see the forthcoming Information Bulletin (Vol. 19) which is entirely devoted to our recent research at that important site. Sarianidi (1990) also continues to advocate an external origin for the Bactrian Margiana Archaeo- logical Complex. In doing so he looks to southeastern Iran as the point of origin of that archaeological culture. In so far as archaeological evidence is incontrovertible, we believe, together with Amiet, Tosi, Biscione, Kohl, Francfort and Masson, that the Central Asian Bronze Age has entirely indigenous roots. Furthermore, there is not a single site in southeastern Iran that offers the slightest evidence for the local development of the material culture which later characterises the BMAC. In fact, on every site in southeastern Iran where materials of the BMAC have been discovered, they occur in an intrusive context within a regionally defined local archaeological culture. Thus we are confronted by a major archaeological question affecting a very large geographical territory: What were the cause(s) for the southward movement of peoples from Central Asia to widely scattered regions of the Iranian Plateau and Baluchistan? We must distinguish between the movement of peoples from the movement of objects and/or styles by exchange and/or stimulus diffusion. We believe that the evidence recovered from burials on the Indo- Iranian borderlands strongly supports the contention that we are dealing with the actual movement of peoples. The cenotaphs at Sibi, the "Quetta Hoard", some of the individual burials at Shahdad, and the burial identified as Li at Khurab appear to contain materials that are exclusively of Central Asian origin. This evidence suggests that the people buried in the tombs, with an exclusively Central Asian material inventory, came from Central Asia. It is important however to point out that at Khurab, Shahdad, and Khinaman(?), there are burials of several periods which appear to include tombs that (1) contain material exclusively of Iranian type, (2) contain material of Iranian type with an object or two of Central Asian origin, and (3) contain, in the rare instance, material exclusively of Central Asian deriva- tion. A re-examination of these cemeteries, with a careful eye toward discriminating grave lot associa- tions and their chronological indicators, would be a productive undertaking. Nevertheless, the presence of burials containing an exclusive material inventory of Central Asian type suggests the movement of peoples from this region to the Iranian Plateau. Why? Amiet (1989) is the only person to have offered a specific hypothesis for an understanding of this move- ment. He has suggested that the distribution of Central Asian artifacts resulted from the movement of "semi- nomadic artisans" into "Outer Elam", that is, onto the distant reaches of the Iranian Plateau. This suggestion, in which the agents of the interaction are reckoned to be craftsmen, is apparently motivated by the recovery of splendidly carved stone bowls and cast metals that have been recovered on Iranian and Baluchi sites. Without doubting either the importance of craftsman and the dissemination of their technical skills (Wright 1989), or for that matter, the possible presence of materials due to intrusive nomadic contacts, we believe an even greater complexity was involved in this interac- tion. We have yet to sufficiently refine the chronology that would permit a distinction as to whether the Central Asian movement onto the Iranian Plateau was an "event" or a "process"; one of rapid and short duration or one which extended over the course of a few centuries. What role did the camel and donkey, now known to be present on BMAC sites (Meadow 1991), play in facilitating this movement? It is also of importance to recognise that the BMAC, within the Central Asia context, suffers what archaeo- logists conventionally refer to as a "collapse"; that is, an apparently precipitous decline in the urban context of settlement, a disappearance of seals, complex metal artifacts, and characteristic ceramic types. Was the "collapse" of the BMAC the result of internal ecologi- cal crises, i.e. over-irrigation, salinisation, the shifting of the delta, or the result of demographic pressures and settlement pattern shifts, resulting in what Adams (1981) has referred to as "hyperurbanisation" in Mesopotamia? Was the "collapse" of the BMAC related to the movement of peoples from Central Asia to the Iranian Plateau and Baluchistan? Finally, as recently addressed by Parpola (1988), what is the relationship (if any) of the BMAC and their cultural representatives on the Iranian Plateau with the sacred Vedic and Avestan texts and the Indo-Aryan "inva- sions"? Given the present state of our knowledge we remain unable to address these questions with a suf- ficient degree of specificity. Nevertheless, there can be little doubt that the Central Asian Bronze Age is of great significance, both within the context of its own geographic domain, and for its impact upon distant regions. It has been pointed out that the movement of the Central Asian Bronze Age onto the Iranian Plateau and Baluchistan replicates a pattern seen in other areas of complex society (Lamberg-Karlovsky 1978). It is of importance to recognise that the phenomenon of expansion and/or colonisation appears within an early context of emergent cultural complexity in various regions of western and central Asia. Territorial expan- sion, whether colonial, imperial, or military, appears to be embedded in the process of emerging state polities. Thus Egyptian expansion into the Sinai and Palestine occurs within the Naqada III period and takes the form of actual Egyptian 'colonies' in the above areas (Oren 1989; Ben Tor 1991). Sumerian expansion to the north in the Middle Uruk period and unto the Iranian</page><page sequence="4">4 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Plateau also involves the establishment of "colonies" in areas of indigenous culture (Algaze 1989). The expan- sion of the Uruk Period is replicated by that of the Proto-Elamites unto the distant reaches of the Iranian Plateau (Lamberg-Karlovsky 1978). Within the Indus Civilisation the site of Shortugai, on the banks of the Oxus River, provides an example of Harappan "colonisation" in a distant region of indigenous culture in Central Asia (Francfort 1989). This paper has documented the movement of peoples of the BMAC complex to distant regions of the Indo-Iranian border- lands. The universality of the phenomenon involving demographic expansion, colonisation, and a con- comitant increase in intercultural interaction can be further supported by the presence of this phenomenon in the Lungshanoid period in China (Chang 1986: 192-233) and at Teotihuacan in the New World (Millon 1981). Archaeological evidence suggests that demographic expansion into new territories accompanies the process of early state formation. It appears increasingly evident to us that conflict, warfare, alliance, and the manipula- tion of political power are categories as important to consider as the universal explanation, typically offered for the phenomenon of territorial expansion; namely, the economic need for trade and the control of resources. We would prefer to argue that increased trade and commerce was an effect rather than a cause of territorial expansion. The primary agents permiting this territorial expansion, which on some sites like Habuba Khabira involved thousands of Urukian immigrants, is to be sought in the political processes of alliance, conflict, coercion and outright warfare between the emerging power of a centralised state and the indigenous populations on its undefined territorial borders. Areas of cultural complexity are constantly confronted by both an internal and external competi- tion that extend beyond the need for resources. Increasing energy expenditures for maintaining an administrative bureaucracy, establishing networks of communication, increasing agricultural and com- modity production, and sustaining the costs involved in local conflicts, all which inevitably emerge in efforts toward centralisation, could all lead to expansionist tendencies. As society evolves towards greater com- plexity the costs to that society, in terms of production and energy expenditure, must neccesarily increase. At a certain point the costs may exceed the benefits derived; a point referred to by economists as the "law of diminishing utility". Ancient societies were dependent upon human, animal, and plant productivity, so the solution to declining marginal returns could be accom- plished by territorial expansion and the exploitation of new resources, land, people, etc. Clearly, far more research is required before we can comprehend the "causes" for territorial expansion within any of the above regions. It is of interest to note, however, that the Central Asian Bronze Age joins the community of Bronze Age civilisations in replicating this process of expanding into a distant periphery. THE BACTRIAN-MARGIANA ARCHAEOLOGICAL COMPLEX The Bactrian-Margiana Archaeological Complex, is a co-occuring assemblage of typologically similar artifacts which include carved soft stone objects, metals, seals, and ceramics. The development of a large and rich inconography in Margiana and Bactria including zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, and geo- metric designs from excavated contexts, is limited to the BMAC period. The Central Asian Bronze Age ceramic tradition consists of fine unpainted buff ware with conical shaped vessels, plates on stands, and larger vessels with a distinctive concave mold made base. Similarities, in both the manufacture and in the classes of ceramic types, indicate a continuous late Namazga V (Kelleli Phase) tradition extending from the foothills of the Kopet Dagh: Namazga, Altyn and Ulug Depe, to the BMAC sites in the desert oases of Margiana. Rim changes in vessels, such as the pots on stand, from late third/early second millennium sites of Southern Turk- menistan, allow for refined chronological distinctions to be made. Identical ceramic forms are found in domestic architecture, monumental architecture, burials, and cenotaphs (P'iankova 1989, Hiebert 1991b). In Bactria, there are no comparable settlements of the late Namazga V (Kelleli Phase). This leads to three interpretive alternatives: (1) the area was not inhabited by late Namazga V communities, (2) there was a local culture different from the Southern Turkmenistan tradition of Namazga V, which later adopted the BMAC tradition, or (3) the cultural antecedents in northern and southern Bactria have not been dis- covered. As for the last possibility, the catalogue of surface materials and excavated materials recovered by the Soviet expeditions in Bactria have yet to reveal any distinctive small finds, ceramics, or trade items of the late Namazga V (Kelleli Phase) in Bactria. The occupational history is different in eastern Bac- tria (Francfort 1989). At the site of Shortughai the BMAC type finds are found in the upper two phases, III and IV. The earlier Phases I and II do not contain ceramics or small finds of the southern Turkmenistan Central Asian tradition but they do contain materials of the distinctive Harappan Civilisation. At Shortughai Phases I and II would appear to be contemporary with the Namazga V period, a period otherwise unknown in the oases areas of north and south Bactria.

CHRONOLOGY OF THE BACTRIAN-MARGIANA AREA AND ITS NEIGHBOURS 3500-1500 BC. The small finds of the BMAC, like the ceramic inventory, have antecedents in the Namazga V period of Kelleli and southern Turkmenistan. Masson (1984) has argued for a Harappan influence in the forms of seals and decorated ivory sticks recovered from Altyn Depe. The BMAC is impressive for the wide range of exotic materials exploited: alabaster, steatite, lapis, precious metals, sea shells, and bronzes, which were all manufactured in a local style but of non-local resources. Equally impressive are the types of objects found together with distinctive iconography: miniature stone columns with grooves and inlay; shaft hole axes often decorated with zoomorphic designs; bronze pins with decorated heads; incised perfume bottles; mirrors; compartmented and cylindrical seals; alabaster bowls; and cups on stands. The iconography includes geo- metric designs, demons, animals, and humans, all of which suggest the presence of a complex ideological system. The most extensive collection of this material is known from the robbed tombs of Bactria in northern Afghanistan (Pottier 1984). The distinctive small finds that characterise the BMAC are not found in all contexts-such items as the figurative seals, and miniature columns, have been recovered only from contexts of monumental architecture, burials, and cenotaphs. Many of the objects which lack archaeological con- text, such as the plain seals, simple/undecorated shaft- hole axes, and softstone vessels, cannot be readily attributed to the BMAC. They have earlier proto- types and are difficult to date on stylistic grounds. Some of the more elaborate items, such as the bronze shaft-hole axe from the Oxus Treasure (Dalton 1964), can be attributed to the BMAC on stylistic grounds. We are beginning to analyse the characteristics of the raw materials within BMAC ceramics, metals and</page><page sequence="6">6 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES small find categories in order to better understand the extent of Central Asian interaction with Iran and Baluchistan. Khurab The archaeological reconnaissance undertaken by Sir Aurel Stein (1937) throughout southeastern Iran and northwestern India (present day Pakistani Baluchistan) had profound effects upon the later arch- aeological development of this vast region. Several of the sites which Stein first discovered, and in some instances excavated, were to become the focus of later important archaeological research programmes, such as Tal-i Iblis, Bampur, and Shahr-i Sokhta. Within the context of these archaeological explorations Stein undertook the excavation of a number of tombs at Khurab. Khurab is located along an ancient branch of the Bampur River and contained materials of several dif- ferent periods. We are fortunate in having a significant collection of this material, gathered by Stein on his reconnaissances, in the Peabody Museum at Harvard University. One of us (C.C.L-K) has studied this collection in two prior instances; one of which involved the metallurgical analysis of a shaft-hole axe, with recumbent camel, from Khurab (Lamberg-Karlovsky 1969; Lamberg-Karlovsky and Schmandt-Besserat 1977). In the 1969 publication Lamberg-Karlovsky suggested that the zoomorphic shaft-hole axe demonstrated an association with the Bronze Age of Central Asia. In this essay we return to a re-examina- tion of the materials from the Khurab cemetery. Over the course of several days Stein excavated a number of burials at Khurab which he catalogued by trench area and burial group. Trenches A and C contained disturbed burials which included glass bangles of the Islamic period. Trench B located in situ burials (primarily Bi and Biii) that contained typical Iranian painted black-on-grey ware, referred to as Emir Grey Ware, which dates from the later half of the third millennium (Wright 1989). The Khurab tombs can be divided into those that contained ceramics typical of the Iranian Plateau and those that contained materials typical of Central Asia. Of particular importance is the association of materials recovered from the burial in Trench L that Stein referred to as Li. The Central Asian parallels for ceramics contained in this burial are specific and relate to the BMAC recovered from the southern Bactrian site of Dashli. The date for this assemblage at Dashli can be placed between 1900-1700 B.C. (Hiebert 1992). The Khurab axe, which is decorated with a figure of a seated camel, and an agate bead with gold foil terminals (see Stein 1937), are from the burial in Trench E and are associated with ceramics of the BMAC type. A burial from Trench D, apparently a secondary burial, also contained unpainted ceramics typical of the Central Asian BMAC. Stein's description of the burial indicates an exceptional preservation of remains: "Within the high vessel on the left there survived thin rolls and small loaves of what was obviously bread. Human bones lay all along the collection of vessels, and a badly injured human skull near the northern edge of it ... among the plain vessels found here there are two conical cups, D.245, 246, which owing to their very small bases could scarcely have been for ordinary household use" (see P1. I). In fact, these vessels are typical in both the household assemblage of Central Asia and in their burials. This burial also contained painted ceramics familiar to the local traditions of the Iranian Plateau. The use of footed vessels for use in offerings, in this instance of bread, finds a ready parallel at Sapelli Depe in Bactria where grain was found in a footed vessel in burial 101 (Askarov 1977). We illustrate here the ceramics in the Peabody Museum from tomb Li at Khurab (Fig. 2), and reproduce the photographs taken by Stein document- ing the full burial deposits from Li and E (Pl. Ia, b). The identical form and ware of these ceramic types to those of the BMAC in Central Asia, and their intrusive nature within the ceramic repertoire of the Indo- Iranian borderlands, allow for the strong probability that we are confronted here by the burial of individuals from Central Asia. Tepe rahya Excavations at Tepe Yahya have also recovered specific objects of Central Asian type. These materials are illustrated in P1. IIa, b. It is important to note that these are isolated examples, within an extensive inven- tory of indigenous materials, and indicate their intrusive nature within a local cultural context. At Tepe Yahya the limited materials of the Central Asia BMAC were recovered from IVB/1 and IVA/4 con- texts, dated to the last centuries of the third millennium and first century of the second millennium. Among this material was a broken but reconstructable complete pot and a metal stamp seal(?) (P1. IIa, b). We take the opportunity to publish here a small fragment recovered from the surface of Gonur Depe (Fig. 3). This fragment, from a steatite bowl, appears to have a crudely incised "hut-pot" on its outer surface. Should this "reading" be accurate it is the first recovery of an "Intercultural Style" object from Margiana.

The site was excavated by Eng. Ali Hakemi (1972) from the late 1960s to the mid 70s and continued by Mr. M. A. Kaboli (1978) in the late 70s and 80s. Excavations at Shahdad have concentrated almost exclusively upon burials, although a large complex of domestic archi- tecture and a metallurgical installation were also uncovered. A short surface reconnaissance of the site recovered substantial evidence for craft production and suggested that the site ranged from 100 hectares to 150 hectares during the third millennium (Salvatore and Vidale 1982). If this estimate proves to be correct, it would make Shahdad one of the largest known sites on the Iranian Plateau. The wealth of materials recovered from the 382 excavated tombs and cenotaphs (P1. IIc) has impressed the archaeological community. Majidzadeh (1976), utilising both arch- aeological and textual evidence, has suggested that Shahdad represents an important settlement within the region identified in the Mesopotamian texts as "Aratta". Steinkeller (1989) suggests that the area surrounding Shahdad, and incorporating Tepe Yahya, involved the region referred to in the texts as the Kingdom of Marha'i. Vallat (1980), in a review of the cultural geography of the Iranian Plateau in the third millennium, identified the region of southeastern Iran as Gima'ki. Regardless of what this region was called in antiquity, the excavation of the tombs at Shahdad indicate the presence of an important regional centre. The settlement survey undertaken by Sajjadi (in press) along the Halil Rud, immediately southeast of Shahdad, indicates the presence of a dense settlement pattern of large communities; a settlement pattern more reminiscent of Khuzistan than other areas of the Iranian Plateau. From Shahdad a number of BMAC axes (Pl. IId), stone "perfume" jars (Pl. IIIa), metal seals (Pl. IIIb), and ceramics (P1. IIIc-d) have been recovered. THE QUESTION OF LANGUAGE REPLACEMENT Materials excavated from the tombs at Shahdad can be readily paralleled in the material inventory recovered from periods IVB and IVA at Tepe Yahya. Based upon both the archaeological sequence and the radiocarbon dates from Tepe Yahya, we suggest a chronological span of 2300-1700 B.C. for the materials recovered from the cemetery at Shahdad. A single inscribed sherd, recovered from one of the tombs, is</page><page sequence="9">CENTRAL ASIA AND THE INDO-IRANIAN BORDERLANDS 9 0 5cm Fig. 4. Pictographic-Elamite inscription from Shahdad, cemetery A. Inscription incised before firing on a red ware globular pot, diameter ca. 20 cm. Grave also included one black on buff painted vessel. incised in pictographic Elamite with six signs (Fig. 4). This type of script was utilised over a very short time- span and can be dated to 2100 B.C. (Steinkeller, pers. comm.). If the placement of Shahdad within the region of Marhali is correct it would indicate that the people of Shahdad spoke an Elamite language. This deduc- tion appears to be corroborated by the fact that many personal names from Marhali mentioned in Mesopotamian texts are Elamite (Steinkeller, pers. comm.). That Elamite was spoken in southeastern Iran is not without speculative significance. Recently, Fairservis</page><page sequence="10">10 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES and Southworth (1989) have argued that the language of the Indus Valley Civilisation belonged to the Dravidian Family. They are not alone in advancing this hypothesis (Parpola 1988; Zvelebil 1974). McAlpine (1981), in a classic study, had convincingly shown that Elamite and Dravidian were related languages which bifurcated in antiquity from an undif- ferentiated Proto-Elamo-Dravidian language (PED). If the above hypotheses prove to be true, then one would have an extensive territory, stretching from Susa to the Indus Valley, speaking a related language (PED) in the late third millennium. The phenomenon of a widely distributed single language family is believed to have existed prior to the collapse of the Harappan Civilisation and the arrival of the Iranian speakers on the Iranian Plateau. According to the views of historical linguists, the speakers of Indo- Iranian languages would have replaced speakers of the Elamo-Dravidian languages on the territory of the Iranian Plateau sometime before 1500 B.C. The BMAC is the current best candidate for the culture responsible for this hypothesised language replace- ment. Furthermore, distant confirmation for this hypothesis comes from Sarianidi (1989), who has suggested that elements of the BMAC iconography are Indo-Aryan and related to the iconography seen on Mitannian cylinder seals. It is to be noted however that the Mitanni Culture post-dates the BMAC of Central Asia (Salje 1990). Since the BMAC is clearly intrusive on the Iranian Plateau and in the hill country of Baluchistan, we suggest that the BMAC provides the first archaeological evidence that meets both the chronological and historical requirements for the introduction of the Indo-Iranian language onto the Iranian Plateau. While further indentification of BMAC remains on the Iranian Plateau and Baluchistan is anticipated, these cultural remains must be identified in secure archaeological context in order to evaluate the nature of the interaction. If, in fact, we have evidence for a southern expansion of the BMAC from Central Asia, we must examine the conditions under which such an expansion took place. PROCESS OF EXPANSION Recently, Kohl (1989) has adopted the perspective of Wallerstein's "World Systems" to suggest that Central Asia is but one segment of an interconnected world stretching from the eastern Mediterranean to South Asia. This approach is among the most recent that attempts to integrate various "interaction spheres" of resource utilisation, the development and transfer of technologies, and the social context of economic exchange and political centralisation, that stretch from Mesopotamia to the Indus and from Central Asia to the Gulf (Lamberg-Karlovsky and Tosi 1973). With respect to Central Asia, Kohl's analysis offers evidence for the centrality of this region's interaction with more distant areas. However, his analysis proceeds without considering either the internal cultural development of Central Asia or the institutional context in which that "core" related to the "periphery". It is these two important considera- tions we wish to briefly review here. There can be little doubt that within the Caspian littoral and the piedmont zone of southern Turkmenia there is a slow development of indigenous cultures from the establishment of early village farmers, i.e. Djeitun. Braidwood (1975) and Masson (1989) have documented the material parallels which relate late seventh millennium Djeitun with the "Zagros Group" (see Mortensen 1966). The subsequent indi- genous development of large villages in the southern foothills of Turkmenistan, is attested to by the recent excavation of the sixth/fifth millennium settlement at Ilyngych (Masson and Korobkova 1989). Excavations in the Geosyur oasis of the Tedjen River indicate the presence of numerous late fourth millennium villages practicing irrigation agriculture. These sites date to the late Namazga III and early Namazga IV periods, ca. 3500-3000 B.C. Excavations at Namazga Depe, as well as at Altyn Depe, indicate that by late Namazga III, towards the middle of the fourth millennium, settlements had reached a substantial size, ca. 20 hec- tares (Kohl 1984). Again, the material inventory, whether at Geoksyur or Altyn, suggests a slow process for the internal development of cultures within southern Turkmenia. It appears that the Geoksyur towns and surrounding villages experienced an increasing political integration and economic productivity that was based upon a shared irrigation system (for comparable later evidence in Bactria see the study of Gentelle 1989; Gardin 1985 and 1988). During this period, there is evidence for an increase in the size and number of settlements in the foothills of southern Turkmenistan, and for uniformity of material culture which charac- terised the region. It is exceedingly difficult to "define" the political structure that both characterised and integrated these communities. Settlement regimes indicate the existence of a two-tiered hierarchy; large centres surrounded by satellite villages (Biscione 1973). It is possible that the concomitant increase in both political integration and economic exchange united southern Turkmenistan into a single ethnos. Within this context it is possible to suggest the presence of a political integration emanat- ing from the centre and extending over the surrounding countryside. Each centre would have been presided over by a paramount headman or "chief' whose lineage would have held sway over both the centre and the surrounding countryside. Ethnographic evidence from Afghanistan offers an analogy for the existence of</page><page sequence="11">CENTRAL ASIA AND THE INDO-IRANIAN BORDERLANDS 11 powerful headmen, within the context of segmentary lineages, presiding over both city and countryside, integrated within a complex network of kin relations and reciprocal obligations (Tapper 1983). It is within the context of the Namazga III period that we have evidence for the first extensive relations between this region and distant areas. Ceramic parallels from the Geoksyur oasis with those from Quetta in Baluchistan were first noted by Piggott (1950). Ceramics of the Namazga III period can be readily paralleled at Mundigak II, Deh Morasi Ghundai II/III, Shahri Sokhta I, and at a number of sites surveyed by Fairservis (1956) in the Quetta Valley. Thus the Namazga III period is of consider- able importance for it indicates the first expansive interaction with distant regions of the Indo-Iranian borderlands. However, the Namazga III interaction with the Indo-Iranian borderlands indicates a very different scale from that which characterised the later period of the BMAC. Unlike the BMAC, evidence for Namazga III interaction is exemplified by a limited number of ceramic parallels between distant sites; neither the presence of burials nor the rich material inventory is evident during the Namazga III period. In this regard it is important to recognise that both this centralisation and long distance interaction were already character- istic of southern Turkmenia at the end of the fourth and beginning of the third millennium. This sets the stage and provides the foundation for the subesequent unfolding process of the Namazga V and VI inter- action. At Altyn Depe, in the late Namazga IV period, there is substantive evidence for a new scale of political integration of the community and its interaction with neighbouring areas. Excavations at Altyn Depe reveal, for the first time, the presence of monumental architec- ture, substantial quantities of elite products, and "activity areas" involved with the production of numerous crafts (Masson 1981). This evidence suggests an increase in the consolidation of power in the hands of an increasing number of elites. The site of Altyn Depe, in the Namazga V period, with respect to size, architectural complexity, technological achievement, and the presence of craft activities would seem to merit the designation "city". We note that within the context of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley, the designation of a community as a "city" is usually taken to be coterminous with the emergence of the state and literacy. On the vast stretches of the Iranian Plateau and Central Asia archaeologists have been reticent to use the term "city" for certain settlements and restrained in arguing for the presence of "state" poli- ties. We believe that this view is not only in error but that it continues to submerge the central importance of both particular sites and entire regions within this vast area. Altyn Depe, Mundigak, Shahr-i Sokhta, and Shahdad, are but a few examples of important cities within their respective geographical domains. Within each of their locales excavations and surveys have offered abundant evidence that these cities held sway over the economic and political development of the surrounding region. Altyn Depe appears to have not only dominated its immediate surrounding countryside but had contact with the cities and outposts (such as Shortughai) of the Harappan Civilisation. Based upon the archaeological record, at the begin- ning of the Namazga VI period, the following features appear clear: (1) there is a direct cultural continuity from the Namazga V to VI periods in Margiana (Hiebert 1992; Piankova 1989); (2) the heartland of the "Namazga Civilisation", that is southern Turk- menia, experiences a settlement crisis with the abandonment of its principal cities (Biscione 1977; Kohl 1984); (3) Margiana experiences the growth of substantial cities throughout the Namazga VI period; (4) a uniform single culture, the Bactrian-Margiana Archaeological Complex, is distributed throughout Bactria and Margiana; and (5) the material culture of the BMAC is evident on a number of sites in the Indo- Iranian borderlands, i.e. Sibsi, Khurab, Shahdad, Mehi, Quetta hoard, Hissar IIIC, Tepe Yahya, Mehrgarh VIII, Khinaman, etc. The extensive dis- tribution of the BMAC, together with the recognition of the considerable size of their cities, such as Gonur which extends over 22 hectares, and the monumental nature of single architectural units, such as the one hectare structure at Togolok-21, combine to suggest that we are dealing here with a socio-political phenomenon of considerable magnitude. Add to the above the evidence of a direct BMAC cultural presence in disparate regions of the Indo-Iranian borderlands and one is confronted by a process that involved a substantial region of Middle Asia. We are left to ponder the socio-political context which fuelled this process. Anthropologists are fond of discussing the social formations of particular types of political power, i.e. chieftainship and/or the origin of the state. An equal enchantment is expressed in their efforts to generalise and offer universal explanations for these varying types of political expressions. A detailed examination of both the ethnographic and archaeological record suggests, however, that numerous distinctive paths and identities characterise the nature of the same term, whether it be a "chieftainship" or a "state" (Maisels 1990). It is our belief that the BMAC, if not itself a state, appears to mirror a facsimile of a state structured polity of power. The 15km. distance from Gonur to Togolok in Margiana is no greater than the distance which separ- ates Lagash from Girsu in Mesopotamia. Nor is there a great difference in the relative size of these respective cities. The latter are taken, without qualification, to be important "city-states" within Mesopotamia, the</page><page sequence="12">12 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES former float without a socio-political identity. With respect to technology, settlement pattern, a dependence upon extensive irrigation agriculture and material culture, including the presence of cylinder seals in both areas, these regions appear to be entirely comparable in scale, save for the absence of writing in Central Asia. Two propositions, within the context of the BMAC, are worthy of careful investigation and theoretical discussion: (1) does the BMAC represent a social formation characterised by interacting city- states? or (2) does the BMAC represent an integrated single state? Thus, by analogy, is the BMAC more akin to the political structure of Mesopotamia or of Egypt? Research carried out within a specific exploratory framework that attempts to diagnose the socio-politi- cal structure of the BMAC is crucial to understanding its incorporation, however tenuous, within a "World System". Lastly, it is of interest to note that the BMAC probably endured for no more than 250 years. While there is abundant evidence for the presence of the BMAC in the Indo-Iranian borderlands, there is no evidence for artifacts of the indigenous cultures of the Indo-Iranian borderlands in the heartland of the BMAC. How does one explain this assymetry of arch- aeological evidence? It is possible that the movement of the BMAC into the Indo-Iranian borderlands was intended more to raid than to trade. Clearly, only future research, directed to addressing the patterns which archaeology discloses, can shed meaningful new light on the complexity of internal development and external relations of the BMAC. We note, however, within a speculative framework, that both the relatively short duration of the BMAC and its expan- sion onto the Indo-Iranian borderlands conforms to the pattern of short bursts of imperialism that charac- terised the Akkadians, Ur III, Han China, the Pre- Classic Maya, XVIIIth Dynasty Egypt, and the Abbasids. The BMAC represents a luminous moment, the earliest in a long line of Central Asian cultures, that impacted upon distant southern regions. One of the most impressive BMAC products was the splendidly decorated shaft-hole axe, a likely object of authority and power that was carried onto the Iranian Plateau and beyond, to Susa. The BMAC, like the examples of expansionist states mentioned above, represents a short "episode" but one with profound consequences if our interpretation of its Indo-Iranian affinity is correct. The BMAC, in manifesting a process of internal and indigenous urban evolution, experienced a period of extensive expansion to distant areas that was, in turn, followed by a "collapse" of its own "heartland". This historical sequence of events appears to replicate a process that characterised other Bronze Age Civilisations of Eurasia, i.e. the Harappan. The replication of a pat- tern leaves in abeyance an understanding of the specific processes that characterise individual case studies. Nevertheless, the recognition of an historical pattern is the first step toward generating research interests that address the specific qualities of each case study that appears to conform to the pattern. CONCLUSIONS Within the past decade the archaeology of Central Asia has revealed a distinctive Bronze Age civilisation in the desert oases. Its internal development and com- parative stratigraphy is still in the process of study. The impact of distant centres upon Central Asia, as well as the reciprocal impact of Central Asia upon distant areas in Baluchistan and Iran, has only begun to be investigated. With an increased understanding of any single region, be it the Indus, Baluchistan, southeastern Iran, the Gulf, or Central Asia, it becomes increasingly evident that an understanding of the interaction that characterised the whole becomes both more difficult and essential. In order to effect that understanding an increased rigour in the methods of excavating sites and the building of chronological systems, based upon carefully considered ceramic typologies and compara- tive stratigraphy, becomes of paramount concern. The significance of a rich material culture of Central Asian origin: bronze axes, metal compartmented seals, stone rod "sceptres", miniature stone columns, decorated chlorite "perfume" jars, and numerous ceramic types, recovered from an increasing number of widely scattered communities and cemeteries on the Indo- Iranian borderlands, can hardlybe underestimated. Prior to the emergence of the Achaemenid Empire there is simply no comparable evidence to that pro- vided by the BMAC for a dramatic foreign intrusion onto the disparate communities of the Indo-Iranian borderlands.
