<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CENTAUR'S ORIGIN: A PSYCHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE The origins of myths which arose in prehistoric times tend to be ob- scure. The present article considers a particular mythological hybrid, the ancient Greek centaur.' The article discusses the possible origins of this imaginary therianthropic creature, and then examines recent empirical psychological evidence that possibly helps to shed light on the Greek cen- taur's beginnings. I. Origin of the Greek Centaur A. Greek Centaur A composite of human and horse, the ancient Greek centaur was cus- tomarily represented with a human head, neck, arms, and chest, the lat- ter being attached to the head-less and neck-less body of a horse. The Greek centaur was also portrayed in other forms: for example, as a com- plete human to the small of whose back was attached the hindquarters of a horse. In each version of the Greek centaur, a body region of one of its "par- ent" species was augmented by the corresponding body region of the other parent species. Being quadrupedal and yet possessing arms, the centaur had one pair of limbs more than either of its parent species; it ap- parently also possessed human and equine duplicates of such vital inter- nal organs as the heart and lungs. The centaur's duplication of limbs and vital organs has been characterized as "almost un-Greek",2 but "aug- mented" fantastic hybrids may not have been overly common elsewhere in the ancient world.3 B. Myths Relating to Centaur's Origin The ancient Greeks provided various fabulous accounts of the cen- taur's origin. Thus, the centaurs were said to have developed from semen fallen from Zeus. The part-human, part-equine shape of the centaur Chiron was partly accounted for by the legend that Chiron's father Cronus transformed himself into a stallion, either to keep his wife Rhea from observing his sexual assault on Philyra, who consequently con- ceived Chiron, or because Philyra had transformed herself into a mare to escape Cronus. Philyra was said to be so distraught by the shape of her offspring that she prayed to be herself transformed and was changed into a lime tree.

Alternatively, Ixion and Nephele were said to have con- ceived Centaurus; Centaurus then mated with mares to generate the cen- taurs, whose lower portions resembled their dams and whose upper por- tions resembled their sire. In yet another myth Centaurus was reputed to be Apollo's son, as well as the father of the centaurs. Apollo was also in- volved in a myth in which he punished Chiron (originally a Titan, ac- cording to this myth) by turning him into the first centaur. C. Scholarly Hypotheses Regarding Centaur's Origin Like mythological accounts of the centaur's origins, scholarly at- tempts to interpret and account for the centaur's origins have been var- ied. One scholarly view, suggested by the ancient Greek emphasis on the drunkenness, lust, and destructiveness of virtually all the centaurs, is that the centaur symbolized wild life, animal desires, barbarism. According to a more complex interpretation, the union of a human head and torso or upper torso with equine quarters symbolizes the combination of human qualities such as reason with the strength, sexual potency, potential savagery, and unpredictability associated with the equine quarters. Such symbolism is reminiscent of the horse-and-rider imagery evoked in ancient Greek and later literature: compare, for ex- ample, Plato's image of the charioteer Reason, who restrains and guides the two winged horses, Courage and Appetite.4 However, Lawson I has expressed reservations about the violent and lustful connotations of the centaur's equine component, on the grounds that: a) artistic representa- tions of centaurs in combat depicted them fighting in human rather than animal fashion, the brunt of the fighting being borne by the centaur's hu- man component, which brandished a primitive human weapon, the tree branch; b) while early Greek artists were not too modest to produce ithy- phallic works of art, they rarely fashioned ithyphallic centaurs; and c) the nonviolent and nonlustful Chiron also possessed an equine compo- nent. Kirk6has suggested that the early Greek mythmakers seemed preoccu- pied with the opposition between nature and culture, freedom and con- straint, savagery and civilization. Kirk contended that these polarities, possibly symbolized by the contrast between the centaur's animal and human anatomical components, were expressed not in the psyche of each individual centaur, but by the contrast between the civilized traits of Chiron and the brutishness of virtually all the remaining centaurs. Fabled to be offspring of Apollo, the centaurs have also been thought to signify the sun's rays. And they have been interpreted as cloud-de- 4 Plato, Phaedrus, 246-247. s John Cuthbert Lawson, Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion: A Sludy in Survivals (Cambridge 1910) 247-48. 6 Geoffrey S.

One of the diverse hypotheses regarding the origin of the idea of the centaur holds that the image of the centaur was inspired by a tribe of wild mountain men. Proponents of this hypothesis have typically cited Homer and also Hesiod, neither of whom seemed to regard the centaur as a com- posite form. Assuming that Greek art first represented the centaur as a human with an animal adjunct attached to his rear, and only later repre- sented him in his more popular, equine-forelegged form, Harrison pro- posed that what was originally a shaggy wild man "became more and more of a horse",7 evolving by stages into the more popular form of the centaur. Harrison contended that "to indicate [the shagginess of the mountain men] in a horse-loving country [these men] have the hind-quar- ters of a horse awkwardly tacked on to their human bodies," I and "what was originally a primitive man develops [gradually, due to the malign imagination of others] into a mythological horse-demon." 9 To which Rose added, "compare our own [British] tradition that Kentish men have tails." 10 The wild mountain men, according to Lawson's version of this hypo- thesis, were a subjugated people whose conquerors construed them to be sorcerers who were capable of transforming themselves into animals. Ac- cording to Lawson: to distinguish the Centaur in his picture either from an ordinary man. . . or from a real animal. . . [surely the early artist's] only course was to depict the Centaur in his normal human shape, and by some animal adjunct to indicate his powers of transformation. And that is what he did; for in the earliest art the forepart of the Centaur is a complete human figure, and the hind part is a somewhat discon- nected equine appendage. [This artistic convention,] being misunderstood by later gener- ations. . ., contributed not a little to the conception of Centaurs in an invariable composite form; and that later art, by blending the two incongruous elements into a more harmonious but less signifi- cant whoie, confirmed men in that misunderstanding. . ."1 Lawson further supposed that the sorcerer was thought to be trans- formed into a bear, and that "the particular animal which Greek artists selected as a component part of their Centaurs [was] of minor impor- tance," 12 possibly being "due only to the aesthetic taste of a horse-lov- ing people." 13 7 Jane E.

This approach emphasizes the impact of the partnership, first formed in prehistoric times, between the horse and its human rider. For a swift and powerful beast such as a horse can, if unmastered, throw or run off with its rider. But the accomplished equestrian can har- ness the horse's energies with a minimum expenditure of his own ener- gies, so multiplying his own strength, speed, and stamina, and conse- quently enhancing his self-esteem. Consider the following imagined con- sequences of the first prehistoric horseback ride by a skilled equestrian: The world about [the rider] was suddenly diminished, the horizon was at once more extended in space, yet also brought closer. The mounted man had become larger than life, and he irresistibly looked down on his earth-bound contemporaries with condescension. . . .the man astride now shared [the horse's] powers directly and ful- ly, and for the first time he knew the excitement of performance be- yond his own physical limitations. . . . [The rider's] new power en- larged his vision and heightened his sense of worth. It also inflamed his vanity, engendering arrogance of the kind that is meant even to- day when someone is spoken of as being "on his high horse," or when the word "pedestrian" is used with overtones of contempt, or when a powerful leader is described as "the man on horseback." 15 The initial image of the centaur could conceivably have sprung from the fancy of an accomplished horseman who felt so exalted in stature, physical power, and confidence by his experience on horseback, and so much at one with his steed, that he fantasized himself as actually being merged with his mount. However, the rudeness, the intoxication and consequent release of unbridled passions in rape and other violent behav- ior, the incomplete predictability, and the overall brutishness of the great majority of the centaurs, taken together with the high probability that the Greek idea of the centaur originated before the Greeks became skilled equestrians, suggest that, rather than projecting the enhanced self-image of a confident rider, the Greek image of the centaur might have been somewhat anxiety-laden, conjured up by pedestrians frightened by first- '4 Arnold Toynbee, Some Problems of Greek History (London 1969) 119, n. 4.

Thus the Greek idea of the centaur has been attributed to the Greeks' earliest encounters with swift, skilled horseback riders, perhaps savage invaders from the uncivilized far north. It has been proposed that the original "centaurs" were rude and barbarous Thessalian cattlemen who were noted for their horsemanship, or Cimmerian cavalrymen, or Scyth- ian cavalrymen. One version of the horse and rider hypothesis has been stated by Toyn- bee: the notion of a composite creature of this kind [the classical Greek centaur] must have been formed by someone who was seeing, for the first time, a man riding on horseback. . . .Horsemen were not likely to have been seen in Thessaly before the seventh century B.C., con- sidering that the Cimmerians were the first riders [as contrasted with charioteers] whom the Greeks encountered. . . So far from the clas- sical centaur's being the Thessalian lowlander's picture of the Pelian highlander, he will have been the Pelian highlander's picture of his hated lowlander overlord when he met him mounted, Cimmerian- fashion, for the first time. The Thessalian plain is an ideal terrain for Centaurs of the classical format; the crags of Pelion are an im- possible terrain for them.'6 A slightly different version of the horse and rider hypothesis has been enunciated by Bronowski: For the rider visibly is more than a man: he is head high above oth- ers, and he moves with bewildering power so that he bestrides the living world. . . .mounting the horse was a more than human ges- ture, the symbolic act of dominance over the total creation. . . . [In antiquity,j the Scythians were a terror that swept over the countries that did not know the technique of riding. The Greeks when they saw the Scythian riders believed the horse and rider to be one; that is how they invented the legend of the centaur. Indeed, that other half- human hybrid of the Greek imagination, the satyr, was originally not part goat but part horse; so deep was the unease that the rushing creature from the east evoked.'7 The Scythians are said to have engaged in "fluid, foxy, devastating [cavalry] maneuvers [which] must have left the Scythians' unmounted foes feeling that they were at the mercy of centaurs." 18 And the impact of the Scythian cavalry has been compared with that of the Nazi tanks which swept all before them when they arrived in Poland in 1939.'9 I shall subsequently return to the origin of the Greek idea of the cen- taur, and especially to the horse and rider hypothesis.

II. Two Psychological Studies A. Preschool Children's Characterizations of Therianthropic Hybrids In the first study to be discussed, artistic representations of thirty-two therianthropic hybrids were displayed to American children between the ages of three and five years, children whose knowledge of these mytho- logical hybrids was minimal.20 As each stimulus figure was presented to a child, the child was asked, "What is this?" Not knowing the actual names of the hybrids, the preschool children improvised. The younger preschoolers typically gave one-word single- species responses, e.g., calling the centaur a "horse". The older pre- schoolers, by contrast, typically gave more complex responses which implicitly or explicitly acknowledged both the human and the animal fea- tures of a hybrid. While occasionally calling hybrids by familiar therian- thropic hybrid names (e.g., "angel", "mermaid"), the older preschool- ers more frequently referred to the hybrids by specially-formulated com- bination names (e.g., calling the centaur a "man-horse"). Some preschoolers acknowledged the complexity of a partially dupli- cated (e.g., two-headed) creature by characterizing it as two distinct crea- tures, as though they perceived the hybrid to have been cleaved and then regenerated into disjoined, identical single-species twins.2' The various hybrids appeared to differ in their potential for being cleaved and then reconstituted. Now consider the children's responses to a drawing of an equine-fore- legged centaur.22 Most preschoolers characterized the centaur as a single- species creature. Some preschoolers used combination names. Some oth- ers split the centaur into its human and equine components, regenerating each component into a distinct and apparently complete single-species creature, e.g., "he's next to a horse." Occasional preschoolers attempted to establish a relationship other than mere proximity between the human and the horse into which they had transformed the centaur, e.g., "man on a horse", "lady on a horse". 20 Generally depicted by indigenous artists, the hybrids were obtained from a variety of civilizations, e.g., ancient Greece, ancient Egypt, the ancient Near East. Brief verbal de- scriptions of the stimuli, references to their sources, and illustrations of a number of the stimuli are presented in Nash (note 1, above), who also presents the aims, methodology, and findings of the overall preschool study. 21 For example, a mermaid-like hybrid with two crowned human heads and a human fe- male trunk joined to a serpent's tail was occasionally characterized by responses such as "kings", "ladies", or "king and queen in a snake". 22 The children viewed a perspective drawing of the Capitoline Museum's centaur statue. This drawing displays the centaur with its beardless face in front view; with the erect, human portion of its unclothed trunk in part-profile, right arm raised; and with its equine fore- and hind-quarters in profile, right foreleg raised. The drawing was obtained from Alexander S. Murray, Manual of Mythology, revised William H. Klapp (New York 1935) 263; it is reproduced in Nash (note 1, above) 16;</page><page sequence="7">THE CENTAUR'S ORIGIN 279 The "man on a horse" response suggests that man and horse are act- ing on one another, that special muscular tensions have been induced in the two contiguous creatures as a consequence of their interrelation. For the horse supports not only its own weight but also the man's weight, while the man must maintain a posture appropriate to his position atop, and presumably astride, the mount. The relation between human and mount was even more intimate in such responses as "man riding a horse". For here, human and mount were involved in a dynamic and perhaps complex partnership: the horse being active and presumably tolerant of its human companion or burden, and the rider being sufficiently active to maintain his or her balance atop the horse, and perhaps also to exercise some control over the horse. Another bimanual and quadrupedal hybrid, an ancient Near Eastern man-lion,23 elicited fewer mounted human responses than the centaur, perhaps because the preschoolers less frequently attributed a horse component to the man-lion than to the centaur, and were relatively un- familiar with humans riding animals other than the horse or its close rela- tives. B. Adult Characterizations of Tachistoscopically-viewed Hybrids In the second study, American college students were asked to char- acterize the very hybrid figures to which the preschoolers had responded. Whereas the children were allowed an unhurried look at the figures, these adult subjects viewed the stimuli "tachistoscopically", i.e., they were permitted only the briefest glimpse (1/125 second) of each stim- ulus.24 The adults were, by and large, not overly knowledgeable about Greek mythology, let alone other mythologies, although they were clear- ly more sophisticated than the preschoolers. Several adults characterized the centaur as a human combined with part of a horse, e.g., "man with horse's body", "man with the bottom of a horse". From such descriptions, it would be difficult to tell that the respondents had viewed the more popular representation of the Greek centaur-a human from the waist up attached to the headless and neck- less body of a horse-and not the representation in which a complete hu- man is attached to the barrel and hind legs of a horse. More importantly, some adults dissociated the centaur into its human and animal components, each of which was then regenerated into a dis- tinct and apparently complete single-species creature. The two creatures into which the centaur was transformed were sometimes regarded as sim- ply being aligned in space and superposed, with the animal overlapping and concealing part of an unmounted human body; but the two creatures 23 Drawn from a bas relief, the bearded, six-limbed man-lion was depicted almost completely in profile, with a human head, neck, arms, and chest, the laiter attached to the headless and neckless body of a lion. The drawing was obtained from Zenaide A. Ragozin, Chaldea (London 1887) 77; it is reproduced in Nash (note 1, above) 16. 24 Harvey Nash, "Reaction to Tachistoscopically-presented Mythological Hybrid Figures" (unpublished study). Some of this study's findings are tentatively reported in Nash (note 1, above).</page><page sequence="8">280 HARVEY NASH were more frequently regarded as contiguous and touching, their inter- action occasionally being quite vigorous.25 Interactions between an ani- mal and an unmounted human had not been reported by the preschool- ers, perhaps because they had enough time to see that the centaur's ani- mal component was equine; the idea of a lower horse component com- bined with and supporting an upper human component then helped to suggest the idea of a human mounted on a horse. Some of the adults, however, who reported interactions between an animal and an unmount- ed human failed to identify the centaur's animal component as equine. Some adults characterized the centaur as a human mounted on an ani- mal, which was virtually always said to be a horse, e.g., "man on a horse", "man riding a horse and fighting". One mounted human re- sponse, "person sitting on top of a small horse", seems to acknowledge that horses are ordinarily built on a larger scale than people, and that a harmonious combination of the centaur's human and equine compo- nents would involve an expansion of the human contribution or a con- traction of the equine contribution. This reference to the relative propor- tions of humans and horses recalls Lucretius' assertion that the centaur is an unthinkable creature, as horses mature before humans, and conse- quently the centaur's equine component would dwarf its human compo- nent when it was three years old. The adults split the man-lion into distinct creatures about as frequently as they split the centaur. But only infrequently did the adults regenerate the man-lion's cleaved animal component into a horse. And only infre- quently did they report seeing the man-lion as a human mounted on a horse.26 Like the preschoolers, the adults less readily transmuted a bimanual and quadrupedal hybrid into a mounted human if the hybrid's animal component was not perceived as equine. The stimulus figures included yet another hybrid which fuses an an- terior, erect, bimanual component with a posterior, prone, quadrupedal component.27 Not once was this monster split asunder into distinct hu- man and animal creatures, either by the preschoolers who viewed it un- hurriedly or by the adults who glimpsed it fleetingly, in part perhaps be- 25 Adult characterizations of the centaur included "man standing in back of a horse" (alignment, superposition), "person. . . arm around neck of beast" (contiguity, touching), "guy fighting with a lion" (vigorous interaction), and "horse like animal jumping with a man trying to hold it" (vigorous interaction). 26 "Person and animal" was the most frequent type of adult cleavage response to the man-lion, the animal being labelled a "lion", "tiger", "cat", "dog", or "horse". Re- sponses such as "boy walking with dog" and "man leading a huge cat" implied that the creatures into which the man-lion was transmuted could act in concert, even if they might be perceived as noncontiguous. Closer and more dynamic relationships between human and animal were suggested by a response such as "an animal and a man carrying it, both walk- ing" and by the mounted human responses, e.g., "man riding a dog", "man on a horse". 27 Unlike the equine-forelegged centaur and the man-lion, this highly incongruous monster has human forelegs, as well as highly unnatural articulations between some of its human body regions. The monster was depicted in front view, with its distal, animal com- ponent dwarfed (a consequence of perspective distortion?) and partly concealed by its frontal component. The drawing was obtained from Bernard Rudofsky, The Unfashion- able Human Body (Garden City, NY 1971) 79; it is reproduced in Nash (note 1, above) 14.</page><page sequence="9">THE CENTAUR'S ORIGIN 281 cause its human component somewhat concealed and decisively over- shadowed its animal component, and in part perhaps because its exceed- ingly bizarre construction discouraged its cleavage into two familiar sin- gle-species creatures. Ill. Reflections on the Two Studies A. Transformations of Six-limbed Hybrid Figures Some of the subjects who viewed the Greek centaur, represented in its more popular version and depicted with its barrel in profile, mentally split the centaur asunder, perceiving it as a human and a horse. A similar but less marked cleavage tendency was also observed when subjects viewed another bimanual and quadrupedal part-anthropomorphic, part- theriomorphic hybrid which was depicted with its barrel in profile, but whose animal component was feline rather than equine. A fair propor- tion of the subjects who cleaved a six-limbed hybrid in two established a relationship between its regenerated fragments, for example, perceiving the centaur as a human mounted on a horse. B. Centaur Figure: An Ambiguous, Unstable Percept The following considerations are relevant to, and perhaps shed some light upon, the centaur's transmutation into a mounted human: 1. Various twentieth-century psychological movements, such as Gestalt psychology, psychoanalysis, and the projective test movement, have emphasized the perceptual reorganization of patterns of external stimulation that are ambiguous and perceptually unstable, particularly when conditions for viewing stimuli are less than optimal. Since brief exposures provide less than optimal viewing, they consequently increase the likelihood that a centaur will be transformed into a horse and rider. 2. Ames et al. state that the "drive to combine parts [of Rorschach inkblots] into total wholes is [for many preschool children] considerably greater than the ability to do so accurately." 28 Viewed from the perspec- tive of Ames et al., the transmutation of the centaur into a mounted hu- man by some preschoolers might be attributed to a need for such organ- ization which at least temporarily outstripped the preschoolers' develop- ment of the capacity for perceptual organization. Had preschoolers been the only ones to turn the centaur into a person on a horse, one might feel justified in dismissing this metamorphosis as a mere fancy of immature minds. But this perceptual change takes on added significance because it was also effected by more mature minds who only had a glimpse of the figures. The preschool and adult trans- formations can be inter-related by Werner's suggestion that microgenesis parallels ontogenesis, i.e., that the development of an act during a brief 2m Louise Bates Ames, Janet Learned, Ruth W. Metraux, and Richard N. Walker, Child Ror-shach Responses: Developmnental Trends from Two to Ten Years (New York 1952) 139.</page><page sequence="10">282 HARVEY NASH interval parallels development during the individual's life cycle.29 Werner would presumably say that an adult's very brief look at the centaur per- mits unfolding of only the earliest and most primitive of several adult perceptual phases, the most primitive adult phase resembling the primi- tive perception of the immature individual. The above comments suggest that the centaur figure provides an am- biguously structured pattern of visual stimulation that gives rise to a slightly unstable percept. Such a percept would have the potential for be- ing reorganized into a mounted human, this reorganization being fa- vored by the earliest and most primitive phases of adult perception, when the structure present in the stimulus figure is not yet fully evident, as well as by the primitive perception of the immature perceiver. IV. Further Thoughts on the Greek Centaur's Origin A. Relevance of Observed Transformations to Centaur's Origin? The present transformation of the centaur into a person on a horse un- does and essentially reverses the fusion of horse and rider which pur- portedly gave rise to the ancient Greek belief in centaurs. Is the presently reported anatomical transformation a mere coincidence, or does it have implications for the supposition that the reverse transformation took place in antiquity? B. Centaur and Mounted Human: Reversible Unum and Duo Organiza- tions It is here suggested that certain figures which juxtapose anatomical features belonging to different species: a) are perceptually ambiguous; b) have the potential for being perceived as one figure or as two figures (for being dominated by the "unum" or "duo" organization of the stimulus, to use the terminology of the Gestalt psychologist Koffka 30); and c) have the potential for undergoing reversible perceptual reor- ganizations, combinations as well as decompositions, when these figures are unfamiliar to perceivers, or when they are perceived hurriedly or un- der difficult viewing conditions. Thus the more popular version of the Greek centaur, displayed with its barrel in profile, appears to give rise to a slightly unstable percept which has the potential for being reorganized into a horse and rider when the centaur is unfamiliar to the perceiver or when it is seen indistinctly. Con- versely, a Thessalian, Cimmerian, or Scythian equestrian who seemed at one with his mount may have given rise to a slightly unstable percept which had the potential for being reorganized into a centaur by ancient Greeks who were unfamiliar with skilled equestrians and who saw horse and rider indistinctly from afar, or who were too dazed or terror-stricken 29 Heinz Werner, "The concept of development trom a comparative and organismic point of view," in The Concept of Development: An Issue in the Study of Hutnan Be- havior, ed., Dale B.

The probability of such a perceptual reorganization should have been enhanced in a superstitious age characterized by a ready belief in monstrous supernatural beings. The hypothesized union of horse and rider in antiquity hardly seems a more fantastic metamorphosis than the presently observed transmuta- tion of the centaur into a mounted human. C. Evolution of Art Form of Centaur Some commentators might contend that, although conceivably the product of a seeming fusion of an equestrian with his mount, the equine- forelegged Greek centaur (which some contemporary subjects turned into a mounted human) assuredly evolved from the Greek centaur whose equine barrel and hind quarters emerge from the rear of a complete hu- man; the origin of the latter centaur is not so readily attributable to an apparent union of horse and rider. The horse and rider hypothesis seems applicable, if at all, these commentators might assert, to the origin of the oriental archer centaur, Scythian warriors having been mounted archers. The prevailing contention that the equine-forelegged centaur evolved from the human-forelegged centaur was, however, challenged by Baur, who conducted the first careful investigation of the evolution of the cen- taur in archaic Greek art.3' Baur declared that the Greeks were ac- quainted with depictions of both equine- and human-legged centaurs from early times, and he suggested that the Greek centaur was initially portrayed with equine rather than with human forelegs. But a more ex- tensive investigation which included more recent archeological findings led Schiffler 32 to disagree with Baur's assertions. We have probably not yet heard the last of the evolution of the centaur in Greek art. The art form of the centaur suggests another possible reservation re- garding the horse and rider hypothesis. It has been estimated that the Scythians migrated from central Asia to the northern Black Sea region of southern Russia during the 8th-7th centuries B.C.,33 and that "the Cim- merian cavalry did not make their appearance in Western Anatolia and on the Black Sea steppe before the closing years of the eighth century B.C." 34, whereas the earliest of the known Greek depictions of the cen- taur was apparently fashioned in the 10th century B.C.35 A conclusive demonstration that the Greek centaur was visualized before the earliest Greek contacts with skilled equestrians would of course refute the pro- position that the initial idea of the Greek centaur sprang from such con- tacts. 31 Paul V.

Note that Greek representa- tions of mounted horsemen who display poor riding technique date back about as far as 1300 B.C.36 And note Jettmar's apparent suggestion that the idea of the Greek centaur derived not so much from the riding skill and speed of the early horsemen as from their prolonged stay on horse- back: "[The nomadic Scythians] spent their days in the saddle, as though they had become permanently linked with their animals. This was the origin of the Greek notion of the centaur." 37 D. Diffusion of Centaur The hypothesis that the centaur was borrowed and was not an inde- pendent invention of the Greeks poses yet another challenge to the horse and rider hypothesis. Dumezil, who formulated one version of the diffu- sion hypothesis, compared the myth-ritual complexes as well as the names of certain European and Asiatic therianthropic hybrids, including the Greek Kentauroi and the Indic Gandharvas, one species of the latter being somewhat centaur-like. Dumezil's analysis suggests that these var- ious myth-ritual-name complexes had developed differentially from a proto-lndo-European original.38 Dumezil's analysis further suggests that men riding ritual hobby horses or wearing ritual horse costumes at sacred but carnival-like end-of-winter festivals represented centaurs or centaur- like beings, although Nichols attributed to Dumezil an "unspoken as- sumption. . . that the centaur was born out of the image presented by such a man and straw horse [i.e., hobby horse] together." 39 However, Littleton 4 noted that: 1) comparative Indo-European lin- guists do not fully accept Dumezil's reconstruction of the proto-Indo- European name of his proposed class of supernatural beings; 2) the dif- ferential development of an idea may, but need not, parallel the differen- tial development of the name associated with the idea; 3) the meaning of the proto-Indo-European name may differ substantially from the mean- ings of the derivative names from which the proto-lndo-European name was reconstructed, e.g., a later interpretation in one locality may have diffused over the entire Indo-European domain; and 4) the proto-Indo- European name and its meaning may have originated in one locality and spread over the entire domain. More pertinent to this discussion is another version of the diffusion hypothesis, supported by Baur among others, which asserts that the 36 Trippett (note 15, above) 49. 37 Karl Jettmar, Art of the Steppes, trans.

But relatively few of the oriental-style fantastic hybrids with which the early Greek artists experi- mented survived in Greek art.4' Although the oriental centaur was usually winged, and Greek art and mythology did admit various winged hybrids, the Greek centaur managed to remain wingless. This version of the diffusion hypothesis would thus replace one unanswered question (how did the Greek centaur originate?) by others: why did the Greeks not borrow the oriental centaur simply and directly? and why were wings omitted from the Greek centaur but not from a number of other Greek hybrids? Furthermore, simple diffusion of the centaur from the Orient would not account for evolutionary changes in the artistic representation of the Greek centaur. In any event, the contention that the Greeks borrowed the centaur from the Orient has been challenged by Fittschen,42 whose viewpoint has been supported by Schiffler. E. Independent Origins Diffusion does not, of course, preclude independent origins. That the idea of the centaur had multiple independent origins is clear. Invading and terrorizing many lands, the Scythians and the equestrian kinsmen they left behind in central Asia undoubtedly provided many independent opportunities for having themselves transformed into "centaurs", word of whom could then be spread by their beholders. "Even later invaders like the Huns," Cohen noted, "continued to inspire an almost super- natural terror among the peoples of the Roman world. Roman writers mentioned again and again how Hunnish invader and horse seemed to be one." 43 Perhaps the most striking instances of multiple independent "inventions" of the idea of the centaur, as well as instances of the spreading of the newly invented idea, are those recorded in modern times in widely separated New World localities. According to Prescott, the Tabascan opponents of Cortes' cavalry were "'terrified at the monstrous apparition,-for they supposed the rider and the horse, which they had never seen before, to be one and the same."" 4According to Brundage, the Aztec ambassador to the newly landed Conquistadores was said to have reported to Montezuma that "The gods [Conquistadores]. . .were strangely served by beasts. They could join themselves to great hornless stags to become as if one thing." 4S And it has been reported that "the emotional condition of the [Aztec] people [before they personally wit- nessed the mounted Conquistadores] was peculiarly receptive to the 41 Rhys Carpenter, Greek Art: A Study of the Formnal Evolution of Style (Philadelphia 1962) 20. 42 Schiffler (note 32, above) I1, 162. 43 Daniel Cohen, A Modern Look at Monsters (New York 1970) 12. 44 William H.

This was a fall from his horse [draft animals were not then found in the New World), which so astonished the barbar- ians, who were not prepared for this division of what seemed one and the same being into two, that, filled with consternation, they fell back. . "This way of accounting for the panic of the barbarians," added Pres- cott, "is certainly quite as credible as the explanation, under similar cir- cumstances, afforded by the apparition of the militant apostle St. James, so often noticed by the historians of these wars." 47 One may wonder whether each of the Spanish chroniclers' interpreta- tions of observed panic behavior was correct, whether New World inhab- itants actually believed in centaur-like beings, or in cleavages of such beings, in each instance in which such a belief was attributed to them. But the over-all record leaves little room for doubt that a belief in centaur-like beings arose independently, possibly under similar circum- stances, in at least one New World locality and in at least one Old World locality. The clear demonstration that centaur-like beings can originate, and have originated, independently of one another affirms the possibility of multiple independent "inventions" of centaur-like beings in the Old World, including the possibility of multiple independent inventions with- in the same culture. F. Evolution of Centaur Evolution of the Greek idea of the centaur may have been influenced by various factors, once the idea had made its debut. 1) Witnesses who perceived horse and rider as if they were one being might have differed somewhat in their perceptions, or in the language used to report what they had perceived. Recall how some adult subjects who glimpsed the more popular version of the Greek centaur character- ized it in a way that could readily lead others to conclude that the re- spondents had viewed a complete human attached to an equine barrel and hindquarters. Might individual differences in perceptual reorganiza- tion or in verbal formulation have helped generate, or otherwise contrib- ute to, the variety of Greek centaur types? 2) Development of the idea of the centaur may have been influenced by the ways in which community members resolved conflicting reports of strange new experiences. Thus those who had not themselves beheld strange equestrians may have felt a need to somehow reconcile others' discrepant accounts of the experience. 46 George C.

This procedure was repeated with many series of subjects. Lacking opportunities to verify the reports which passed serially from person to person, the tellers tended to recast their reports in characteris- tic ways. The distortions introduced by a given teller depended somewhat on the teller's comprehension of, and memory for, what he or she had heard, as well as on his or her personal needs and interests. In one pic- ture, for example, a razor, held by a white man who is arguing with a black man, was frequently transferred to the hand of the black man dur- ing successive retellings. The Allport and Postman findings suggest that the original Greek centaur image(s) may possibly have been unintention- ally modified in the course of successive oral descriptions, e.g., by a need to render the original image(s) less incongruous, more coherent, or more meaningful, or by incompletely intended suggestions aroused in a listener's mind by the manner in which tellers formulated their descrip- tions. 4) Symbolism associated with the centaur or legends about the centaur might have affected the evolution of its artistic representation, even if symbolism or legend had emerged subsequent to the initial artistic repre- sentation. 5) Once the desire to depict centaurs arose, artists were undoubtedly impelled to ponder aspects of the centaur's anatomy which reporters or narrators could well have neglected-aspects such as the relative size of the centaur's human and equine components, or ways to join the forelegs to the human thorax and to the equine barrel. The desire to represent centaurs visually may thus have furthered the elaboration of the idea of the centaur by focussing attention on anatomical details that had not previously been specified. 6) Cross-cultural contacts might have influenced the evolution of the various Old World centaur-like beings, whether these beings had all initially been conceived independently of one another, or whether some had initially been conceived independently and others had initially been borrowed. Likewise, the development of the art form of the Greek centaur might conceivably have been influenced by the oriental centaur, even had the Greek idea of the centaur not at first been inspired by the oriental centaur, or even had the Greek art form not at first been an adaptation of the oriental art form. Thus the occurrence of both human- and equine-forelegged Greek centaurs might conceivably have been sug- gested by the occurrence of both human- and equine-forelegged oriental centaurs. 48 Gordon W.

Newcomb and Eugene L. Hartley (New York 1947) 547-58.</page><page sequence="16">288 HARVEY NASH 7) Ambiguously structured patterns of visual stimulation might be pro- vided not only by the horse and rider and by the equine-forelegged centaur, but also by the human-forelegged centaur. If so, transformation of either version of the centaur into the other, when the perceiver was un- familiar with the perceived form or saw it indistinctly, could conceivably have effected changes in the centaur's conception or representation. 8) Aesthetic considerations may have influenced the evolution of the centaur. Thus the artistic representation which Harrison described as having "the hind quarters of a horse awkwardly tacked on to their hu- man bodies" 49 tended to be given up in favor of what has been con- sidered a more harmonious and graceful representation, that of the more popular equine-forelegged form. 9) A concern not only with aesthetics but also with a supernatural hy- brid's conceivability or biological efficiency may have effected changes in the Greek idea of the centaur. Although monstrous composites are in- congruous by nature, Greek rationalism tended to downplay the more bi- zarre aspects of such creatures.50 Thus centaurs having equine hind- quarters "awkwardly tacked on" to the human component lack agility as well as attractiveness. And, though each centaur art type has an "incon- ceivable" duplication of essential organs (e.g., heart, lungs), more organs tend to be duplicated in the centaur whose equine hind-quarters are attached to the rear of a complete human form than in the centaur whose fore-quarters and hind-quarters are both equine, as only the former type has pudenda which are multiplied. It was just such less con- ceivable or biologically less efficient centaur types which the Greeks in- creasingly neglected. 10) Differential development of the art form of the centaur might have resulted from differences in the factors affecting development of the art form. Thus, whether associated with a myth-ritual complex, or symboliz- ing a wild mountain man, or whatever, the complete human with equine accessories attached might in some instances have had its human forelegs replaced by equine forelegs as an outgrowth of the initial Greek observa- tions of horseback riders. V. Concluding Comments A. Questions and Hypotheses Regarding Centaur's Origin The various hypotheses regarding the origin of the Greek centaur raise interesting questions. For example: Had the Greeks already conceived the idea of the centaur before they saw, or heard about, the art form of the oriental centaur? Was their initial idea of the centaur inspired by the Greeks' first sight of, or news of, the oriental art form? Was the Greek centaur conceived after Greek exposure to the oriental centaur, but as a 49 Harrison (note 7, above) 381. 50 Carpenter (note 41, above) 20; Charles Picard, "Monsirous and Imaginary Subjects," inEncEyclopediu of World Ar (New York 1965) x. 250-60.</page><page sequence="17">THE CENTAUR'S ORIGIN 289 species which the Greeks considered to be independent of and alien to, rather than a copy or modification of, the winged, oriental archer centaur species? Was the centaur imagined in a part-human, part-equine form because of a need to represent particular characters in a myth pic- torially? Was the germ of the idea provided by an actual group of rude or savage men whom the Greeks symbolically elaborated into centaurs? Did the myths precede the art form, or vice versa? Did a ritual carnival costume somehow become animated? Did the centaur originate from a Greek misinterpretation of a puzzling visual configuration which sud- denly confronted the Greeks? "There are few mythological figures about which more pleasant base- less fancies have been woven," 5' wrote Harrison over seventy years ago, commenting on previous scholarly attempts to account for the myth of the centaur. "Few questions," added Gardner, some years later, "have been more disputed among mythologists than the origin and interpreta- tion of the myth of the centaurs." 52 Today we may say that, while addi- tional hypotheses regarding the centaur's origin have been formulated since Harrison's time, and while evidence of one kind or another has been cited in favor of the various proposals made to date, these various suggestions are not readily proven, and may continue to remain in the realm of speculation. However, some explanations are more plausible than others, and the relative plausibility of particular explanations can be altered by newly discovered findings. B. Virtues of Horse and Rider Hypothesis The horse and rider hypothesis seems to be one of the more plausible of these scholarly suggestions. Correct or not, this hypothesis has the vir- tue of tracing the Greek idea of the centaur to a series of important de- velopments in the relations between humans and horses, developments which are known to have taken place in prehistoric and early historic times. For example: domesticating the horse, and using it for various purposes; mounting the horse and riding it, but with poor technique; rid- ing the horse as an accomplished equestrian; and using skilled horse- manship in invading and terrorizing lands whose inhabitants were either pedestrians, or at least unacquainted with accomplished equestrians. The estimated chronology of these developments, including the westward mi- gration of the Scythians and the spread of the art of riding from Scythian-held territories towards Greece, does not rule out the hypothe- sis that the Greek idea of the centaur is traceable to early Greek contacts with skilled equestrians; and it is clearly congruent with the hypothesis that the Greek idea of the centaur is traceable to early Greek contacts with mounted humans. The horse and rider hypothesis has the further virtue of accounting, in a more compelling manner than most of the alternative hypotheses, for 51 Harrison (note 7, above) 380. 52 Ernest A. Gardner, "Centaur," in Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, ed. James Hastings (New York, n.d.) 111. 306.</page><page sequence="18">290 HARVEY NASH the fact that: a) it is precisely the horse, rather than some other animal, that is combined with the human in the centaur; b) the centaur's upper component is virtually human (the ears are sometimes equine), while its lower component is substantially equine (completely equine, in its more popular form); and c) the centaur is both bimanual and quadrupedal. C. Relevance of New World "Centaurs " to Horse and Rider Hypothesis The suggestion that the Greek idea of the centaur might have been af- fected, if not initially stimulated, by early Greek experiences with invad- ing horsemen is plausible in its own right. This hypothesis is rendered even more plausible by recorded accounts of the seeming oneness of in- vading horsemen and their mounts, particularly by the documented awe and fear experienced in historical times by widely separated, indigenous peoples of the New World when confronted for the first time by horses and their armed riders. These relatively modern recorded experiences in themselves suggest: a) that it takes no extraordinary leap of the imagi- nation for intellectually and emotionally normal individuals who have not previously seen horses to conclude, after a first and perhaps indis- tinct glimpse, that a mounted horseman (especially an accomplished horseman) is fused in monstrous fashion to his mount; b) that awe and fear experienced by those who are unfamiliar with horses, or at least with horseback riders, can readily be heightened when the first horseback riders they see are invading warriors, and that such awe and fear can in- crease the likelihood that these pedestrians will interpret the mounted warriors as frightful six-limbed monsters; c) that ideas of centaur-like beings can readily arise in widely separated localities, independently of one another, under appropriate circumstances; d) that reports of newly discovered centaur-like beings can under certain circumstances readily be accepted, and can spread quickly among those who have not themselves witnessed these beings at first hand, these reports (particularly if they arouse awe or fear) being susceptible of transformation as they spread; and e) that those who have never seen a horse, let alone a mounted rider, and whose very first sight of a mounted rider leads them to believe that they are viewing a single being, may panic at the rider's fall from the horse-awed and perplexed by what appears to be a possibly ominous disintegration of a monster that had seemed one and indivisible. D. Observed Transformations and Centaur's Origin Nichols has stated "The centaur is a composite of man and horse whose very looks suggest a blurred image of horse and rider." S3 At about the time that Nichols seemed to be implying that the centaur image was ambiguous, and therefore unstable and susceptible of perceptual re- organization, the aforementioned empirical psychological studies began to reveal a mental transformation, in contemporary subjects, which undoes and in fact reverses the seeming union of the Conquistadores 53 Nichols (note 39, above) 74.</page><page sequence="19">THE CENTAUR'S ORIGIN 291 with their steeds, and which essentially reverses the mental transforma- tion that purportedly took place in ancient Greece. One could speak of this ancient Greek transformation more unqualifiedly if further research were to indicate either that the human-forelegged version of the Greek centaur did not precede the equine-forelegged version, or that the hu- man-forelegged version, like the equine-forelegged version, can be changed into a mounted human by contemporary subjects. Note that some of the adults who glimpsed the equine-forelegged centaur also glimpsed a virtual silhouette of the centaur Chiron, who was portrayed in profile as a draped human from whose rear an undraped equine adjunct protruded.54 The perceptual ambiguity and cleavage po- tential of Chiron apparently equalled that of the equine-forelegged centaur. But whereas the two creatures into which the equine-forelegged centaur was cleaved typically interacted with one another, the two crea- tures into which Chiron was cleaved interacted minimally, if at all.55 I suspect that an equine-forelegged centaur whose forelegs were simply re- placed by human legs would elicit many more mounted human responses than Chiron did. While possibly enhancing the plausibility of the horse and rider hy- pothesis, the empirical studies of reactions to visual representations of the centaur and other mythological hybrids serve the further functions of: a) demonstrating mental transformations involving the centaur image under specified experimental conditions; b) providing detailed information about the kinds of conditions which might favor such trans- formations; c) providing verbatim reports of the perceiver's characteriza- tions of the hybrid figures, reports which enhance our understanding of these transformations; and d) strongly suggesting that such transforma- tions could readily occur, under certain circumstances, in individuals who are well within the range of psychological "normalcy".
