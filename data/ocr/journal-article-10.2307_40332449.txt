<plain_text><page sequence="1">MYTH, TOTEMISM AND THE CREATION OF CLANS Howard Morphy Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford University This paper considers the relationship between two component types or categories of myth from the Yirrkala region of north-eastern Arnhem Land, which I define respectively as those of inheritance and creation. I argue that the existence of the two components of myth reflects conceptual problems associated with the transfer of power from the ancestral past to the present, in these clan-based societies in which the structure of the clan system is believed to be ancestrally preordained, yet the creation of clans is part of a continuing political process. The paper places Yolngu totemism in the context of the politics of group relations, and focuses on the tension between autonomy and exchange which provides much of the underlying dynamic to Yolngu social organisation. The totemic/mythological system has the flexibility to enable ancestral precedence to apparently underlie group organisation despite the latter's inherently imminent and contextual nature. The structure of the mythological system, and the particular way in which it articulates with the politics of group organisation, enables the network of ancestral tracks associated with the myths of creation to be perpetuated in a way that makes them both distal and protected from the disorderly changes of the present, yet an integral part of the process of social reproduction. INTRODUCTION This article is concerned with an apparently arcane problem of Yolngu totemism, the transfer of rights in the ancestral past (wangair), and power from the ancestral past, to the control of the human groups who today occupy the earth. The power is transferred in the mediatingform of the mardayin, the paintings, songs, sacred objects, big names and dances that make up the sacred law of the clans. Mardayin are ancestral products in two senses: they originated in wangarr time, and they are believed to have been passed on from the wangarr to the present day in direct succession from the wangair beings to the Yolngu.1 In his article on totemism in the first volume of Oceania, Firth characteristically seeks to clarify the case for totemism in Polynesia by applying to the analysis of his Tikopean data a definition abstracted from the way he has seen the term being employed by others. Firth (1931:292) sees two distinct sides to the phenomenon of totemism: a relationship between people and the species, and a relationship between the species and the supernatural being or the spiritual domain. In this view totemism essentially involves triadic relationships in which the totem is the point of articulation between a cosmological system and a sociopolitical system, of both of which it is a part. But this can create the illusion that the social relations arise through the cosmological relation. Both relations, however, are integrated within the same overall process of social reproduction. Nevertheless the distinction that Firth makes is one that can be usefully applied to Aboriginal religion. There 312 Oceania. 60. 1990</page><page sequence="2">Morphy are senses in which the sociopolitical and religious dimensions of totemism are functionally discrete. As Stanner (1965, 1967) argued, ontology and ontogeny can never be reduced to politics even though cosmology is subject to political action. Stanner (1961:7) wrote: The social order, and all that goes with it, maybe the referent of the religious order ... but the religious order is not the terminal of that relation; it is a sort of intervening relatum, one stated and acted in all the many languages of symbolism; and pointing not back to the social order, but indeed beyond itself, indeed beyond the two orders. The last thing in the relation, the relatum towards which the relation runs, is a metaphysical object, it is what the Aborigines in their own religions often call the Dreaming (cited in Hiatt 1975a: 14). In any system in which there is a posited relationship between an ancestrally created world order and the present ordering of social relations, there is going to be a problem in ensuring continuity between the two because of the nature of demographic change and political action. It could be argued that in the case of an oral tradition the problem never arises since the nature of the transmission process enables adjustments to be made both in the present and to the mythological past. However it cannot be assumed that this process of adjustment is unproblematic, and there is evidence that in some cases the structure of Aboriginal mythological systems is influenced to take account of just such logical considerations - that categories of myth exist to mark the differences between ideology and practice. This is especially true of some areas of Australia in which the individual's relationship to the ancestral past is relatively subordinate to the group's, or is at least theoretically nested within the structure of group relations. The more the situation fits the ideal type of Durkheinrs clan totemism, the more contradictions are likely to develop between cosmological order and social order, with continual adjustments having to be made. While the Yolngu of north-east Arnhem Land are by no means a Durkheimean ideal type, the system of clan organisation results in precisely the circumstances in which the articulation between cosmology and society becomes problematic, and I hope to demonstrate that certain features of the mythological system have developed to mediate the relationship between the two. Two conceptually distinct categories of myth can be discerned in Yolngu mythological texts. These may be labelled creation and inheritance, although it must be noted that both may figure in the same text.2 Myths of creation refer to the mythic events that resulted in the transformation of the landscape and which occur without reference to the existence of human groups. Myths of inheritance refer to mythic events that directly concern the institution of human beings in the landscape and the transfer of rights in the mardayin to the founding ancestors of the present Yolngu clans. Conceptually, myths of creation are logically prior to those of inheritance since the latter concern the inheritance of rights in ancestral law derived from or representing events that have already occurred in the myths of creation. However the two can be brought very close together and the land-transforming actions of the ancestral beings can often be presented as if they were viewed by, and in some cases involved the participation of, the first human beings (in for example the mythology of the Djan'kawu and the Wawilag sisters' [see Berndt 1952]). Nonetheless the set of ancestral beings who directly communicate with the founding human groups is a very limited one and conceptually they can be taken to represent the point of transfer from the ancestral domain to the human domain. 313</page><page sequence="3">Myth, Totemism and the Creation of Clans My main argument is that the myths of inheritance are the means by which myth is adjusted to accord with political process, the means whereby the members of clans project their ownership of a particular set of lands and the associated mardayin back into the ancestral past so that it can be said to have originated then. I would also argue that the intermediary category of myth represented by the myths of inheritance is concerned with a theological problem as well as a sociological one, and that it deals with them in the same way. It creates a disjunction between the ancestral past and the time when humans occupied the earth, layering the ancestral past so that some of it is more distal from human existence. The demarcation of these layers of time is not precise, and indeed there is much interpenetration and ambiguity. Williams (1986:31) conveys the sense of this relationship well: some time in the distant past spirit beings appeared on the earth. These spirit beings manifest attributes of human beings and other species, but they are neither anthropomorphic animals nor zoomorphic human beings... During their travels on earth, the spirit beings either brought spirit human beings into existence, or implanted the essences from which later human beings would come into being. During a time usually viewed as somewhat later, some of the spirits of these prototypical human beings entered and animated the land. They became, or entered, rocks, trees, wells, water-holes and animals. Some of the ancient, true human beings, participated in the events in which these transformations occurred. The transformation from the ancestral world, the cosmological dimension, to the human world poses a problem about the nature of being. Human beings are not ancestral beings even though they derive from them through spirit conception, and after death will eventually become reincorporated with them. During life they are separated from them and do not interact with them directly. Although stories of encounters with ghosts are not uncommon, there are few stories of living people encountering ancestral beings. The power of ancestral beings intervenes in the world but their physical presence does not, except through the signs that represent them. The Dreaming was in the past and is in the present, but in the past it was here on earth and resulted in the creation of the landscape, whereas today it exists in a different dimension. In neither case is it directly grasped. Aboriginal and anthropological attempts to build cyclical models of time (e.g. Stanner 1965:60; Williams 1986:30) fail to deal with this disjunction, for the past is active in the present in a different form. Human beings never return to that Dreamtime of world creation. Although they follow the footsteps of ancestral beings transformed into signs in the landscape they never catch up with them. 'Living the Dreaming' is a metaphor: it is not what people are actually doing. However persuasive it may be as a metaphor, the footsteps remain a sign of something that happened in the past which, if it exists in the present, exists on a different plane (cf. Maddock 1972:110). How the planes are linked and how humans appeared in the scheme of things are matters of speculation that many Australian myths are concerned with. A general model, realized in many versions, is that ancestral beings returned into the ground, partially removing themselves from the world they created. By their withdrawal they created the space that people now occupy (cf. Tonkinson 1978:16; Strehlow 1947:42). However, people still need to be positioned in the scheme, and the relationship established between them and the beings of the ancestral 'past' and of the below-ground present. Some Yolngu myths of the transfer of power seem to accept that there is a disjunction, and resolve the problem by creating beings who unambiguously have a foot in both worlds - the ancestral past and the human world - ancestors who occupy the space between the fading 314</page><page sequence="4">Morphy away of the creative ancestral beings below ground and the occupancy of the world above ground by humans. Some humans also occupied this space, the humans who were the founding ancestors of the clans. A second aspect of these myths is that they are concerned with the distribution of ancestral power among human groups, for the time of transfer was the time when the socially undifferentiated creative forces of the 'Dreaming' became the socially differentiated sacred knowledge of the clans. It is with this aspect of these myths that this paper is primarily concerned.4 In a previous paper (Morphy 1988) I addressed the problem posed by the contradiction between the ideology, that a perpetual relationship exists between Yolngu clans and the ancestral past, and the reality that the life of clans is finite. Clans are continually contracting and expanding; some die out, while others multiply. I argued that the contradiction was mitigated by the fact that there is a relationship that is relatively permanent, that is the one between ancestral beings and the land. Whatever demographic shifts occur there are pressures for the group actually 'owning' the land to maintain the same set of links that the previous owners did. One of the conditions of taking over an area of land is that those attempting to do so demonstrate that they possess knowledge of the sacred law of that land. Such knowledge legitimises the takeover, but it also enables the cosmological links among the ancestral beings to be maintained. If this principle is followed in practice then it must be a conservative factor in mythological change. A contrasting process would be one in which the group taking over institutes its own mythology and creates new sequences and connections with the myths of other clans, and out of them new myths. Though such changes unquestionably do occur in Australia there are countervailing pressures towards continuity. The particular way in which Yolngu groups succeed to other clans' territories and establish themselves by taking over existing positions in the mythological and ritual systems of the region has consequential linkages with the overall social formation. The process is constrained in certain ways (for example, succession follows intra- moiety lines); and the affirmation of linkages with particular land-based ancestral beings may be part of a core cultural structure for eastern Arnhem Land societies which influences their evolutionary trajectory over time (a structure analogous to that which Friedman (1981) has argued exists for the Pacific Islands). The pattern of cosmological linkages to land may, for example, place constraints on the median size of clan groupings and may be associated with the particular way in which people are distributed in relation to resources (cf. Peterson 1972, 1975). The maintenance of networks of interconnecting ancestral tracks that cross-cut large areas of land is a distinctive feature of Australian social organisation. And although mythological events are encoded in landscape throughout the world, nowhere does this seem to have been done as systematically as in Australia, where place is subordinate to mythology. The particular cultural form of succession is central to the reproduction of these networks and the maintenance of the mythological landscape. Another consequence of the maintenance of the mythological network is the creation of unresolvable tensions in the system of the distribution of knowledge, especially in areas like north-eastern Arnhem Land where clans are an important element of the system. Although Australian systems are ones in which group definition is associated with a system of restricted knowledge, the knowledge is always spread wider than the membership of groups so defined. One gets the impression from reading Barth's (1975) analyses of Mountain Ok societies that some New Guiñean systems of knowledge are essentially involuted or inward-looking, and that the ultimate identity of the group lies at 315</page><page sequence="5">Myth, Totemism and the Creation of Clans the vortex of the group's secret knowledge. Australian systems are by contrast outward-looking and the identity of a clan exists in part through its position in a cosmic network of connections. CREATION AND INHERITANCE The first narrative is primarily a myth of inheritance. It refers to the origin of the clan as it exists today and the way in which the clan members as a whole came to share a particular set of mardayin associated with different places. It is not concerned with details of the origin of the sacred objects as transformations of particular wangarr beings, or with the origin of the form of designs. Myth 1 Barrama, a wangarr being of the Yirritja moiety, emerged from the ground at Gaarngarn in Dharlwangu country. Barrama sent three emissaries from Gaarngarn, Laanytjung, Banatja and Galbarimun, to give mardayin to all other Yirritja clans. Galbarimun went to the southern clans, Banatja to the north and Laanytjung to the east. Laanytjung went through a number of places before coming to Wandapuy, a Galpiny place. Laanytjung came to Wandapuy where he met Banga, a Yolngu and one of the founding ancestors of the inland Galpiny clan. "Laanytjung had been travelling from place to place to tell people their ceremony, to show them what to do and what to keep in each place. He brought with him some paintings. He also painted himself on his body and was wearing arm bands. He looked back behind him to the fresh water and he saw sugar-bag5 named biirkiida - sugar-bag that lives in paper-bark trees called by a special name - tjuma" "I am going to make this a rangga (sacred object) for the Galpiny people at Wandapuy." And Laanytjung thought, "I will make for them a special miny'tji (painting) called ". "Next Laanytjung made a ground, a ceremony ground, a rule for people to come to go into that ceremony ground. Then he made a sacred dilly bag for Galpiny to use when they have a bunggul or when they are fighting. Laanytjung gave us everything we use in that land" (Djimbuy). After completing his work at Wandapuy, Laanytjung established the mardayin for three other Galpiny places: Barruwuy, Gawunydji and Yarrmadi, the mardayin being associated with swordfish, green snake and grey turtle respectively. I was first told by Djimbuy that Laanytjung went himself to each of these places in turn and taught the leaders of the Yolngu living there their sacred ceremonies, designs and songs. However Bima, Djimbuy's elder brother, said that this was not in fact the case. Laanytjung only visited the leaders at Wandapuy. He then instructed Banga to go to each of the other places and tell them the ceremonial law that he, Laanytjung had been given by Barrama. Banga went first to Gawunydji where he gave the law to Liminingi, the leader of the Yolngu group living there. Banga and Liminingi decided that the people living at the two places would become one clan. Liminingi and Banga then went together on Laanytjung' s instruction to Yarrmadi where they met Raymangi, the leader in that land. They passed on the messages that they had received from Laanytjung. Then Banga and Liminingi asked Raymangi to join them in a single clan sharing the same rangga and sacred paintings. Raymangi agreed and all 316</page><page sequence="6">Morphy became one clan, because 'we have all received the same story from Laanytjung' (Djimbuy). The three groups then held a ngaarra ceremony at Gawunydji to celebrate the fact that they were one clan.6 This myth is essentially concerned with the origin of the clan as a social group. The myth refers to the fact that the paintings, as part of the mardayin of the clan as a whole, were determined by Barrama, a wangarr being who never visited Galpiny territory but instead sent one of his messengers. It also provides a model of the transfer of authority from wangarr beings to Yolngu. Only Banga actually received paintings from Laanytjung. Banga then went to visit other Yolngu and taught them in the same way Laanytjung had taught him, by dancing and singing and producing paintings. The present day Yolngu learn in direct succession from the original clan ancestors, and in ceremonies they enact the law of Barrama in the same way Laanytjung did before. All other Yirritja moiety clans at Yirrkala today have a similar myth in which they acknowledge that the sacred law comes from Barrama.7 Barrama never ventured from his place of origin, Gaarngarn in Dharlwangu territory, but sent emissaries to different places. Each myth includes as part of its structure the order in which other clans learnt the law from Barrama. The myth thus not only links the different areas of a clan's territory, but also links the clan with all other clans of the same moiety in the surrounding area. The Barrama myth does not explain the form of the paintings associated with each area of the clan's territory, nor does it refer to any land-transforming events. The sacred designs and the sacred objects are explained only in the sense that they were allocated in a particular way on the instructions of Barrama. Neither Laanytjung nor Barrama is incarnate in the sacred objects referred to. Indeed the objects themselves pre-existed their formal allocation by Barrama.

The Yolngu referred to in the myth, Banga, Liminingi and Raymangi, the founding ancestors at each place, are said to be the actual founders of present-day lineages, or lineages which existed in living memory (one of the lineages, that headed by Banga, is today extinct). The myth explains why the group called Galpiny is constituted as it is, why they own particular tracts of land and hold particular ceremonies, in terms of interaction between wangarr beings and ancestral Yolngu. The myth also encodes the normative pattern of Yolngu behaviour as it is expressed today. Thus Laanytjung was described by Djimbuy as the first djirrikay, a ritual specialist who determines the correctness of the form of designs. Laanytjung taught Banga, a tribal elder, who in turn became a djinikay and taught other senior men. On deciding to become one clan, the elders agreed to share sacred objects and paintings just as clan members today acknowledge equal rights in the clan's paintings (cf. Williams 1986:95). They held angaarra ceremony to celebrate group unity and through it they taught succeeding generations the law they received from Barrama. The whole myth presents a picture of systematic order. As far as the clan's paintings are concerned, however, the myth seems to state little more than 'we have the paintings we do because Barrama allocated them to the founding ancestors of our clan, who decided to share them'. Myth 2 This myth belongs to a neighbouring Yirritja moiety clan, the Mardarrpa, and was given as an interpretation of a painting (Fig.l). It is primarily a myth of creation in that it concerns the origin of the mardayin, the designs and sacred objects of a clan, and events that transformed the landscape. However, the text also has an internal commentary on inheritance and attempts to influence the way in which the main text is interpreted. This commentary is enclosed in square brackets. This painting is of a place Gunmurrutjpl. Baaru, the Crocodile, is one of the creators of that land and made himself the culture of the Mardarrpa clan. A long time ago baaru was a man and he had a wife called dhamilingii (blue-tongued lizard). The crocodile made a house for himself to live in. Baaru's wife went out and collected fresh water snails. She collected a full dilly bag and returned to her camp and began cooking them on the fire. Baani was asleep in his bark hut. His wife wanted to talk to him and tried to wake him up. But baani kept sleeping. She wanted him to move over so that they could sleep together. But still baaru slept. So his wife made a huge fire and cooked more snails. She took them out of the fire and cracked them with a stone. She threw the scalding pieces on baaru's body. But still baani slept. Finally he awoke and feeling the pain asked his wife why she kept throwing pieces of snail at him. Dhamilingii took no notice and kept throwing the shellfish. Finally baaru became extremely angry, he got up from his sleep and rushed furiously at his wife, carrying the bark sheet from the house on his back. He began to act like a crocodile. He seized his wife and threw her into the blazing fire, shouting "I am the baaru, I am the fire, I am the crocodile, I am the Mardarrpa". After baaru and dhamilingu had finished fighting, he went to live in the sea. Dhamilingii turned into the blue-tongued lizard, a lizard with short legs, because her husband baaru had thrown her into the fire and burnt them off. 318</page><page sequence="8">Morphy Baaru went down to the river and said "I will live in the river, but I will be leadership for the Mardarrpa. I will be the leader belonging to this land and owner of it. The Yolngu can copy this ceremony from me". That's what baani said. [But baant had an order from Laanytjung to say these same things. Baani didn't make himself owner for this land, but had orders from this man Laanytjung.] And baani went into the sea and he carried the fire with him. He dived deep under the water and created a special rock of fire, and said, "this will be mardayin for the Mardarrpa". The crocodile didn't live there but he went into the water there with the house on his back bursting into flames, to try and put the fire out. And you see those marks on the back of the crocodile (the serrated tail), that's the house stuck to his back. And you see those white marks on his back (dots) that's the pieces of snail sticking to his back. See those marks you can see on his body (the diamond pattern in the painting) that belongs to the baani, that's the painting he does on his own body. When Yolngu are going to see the rangga for baani that's the design they must paint on their bodies. That bundle of fire around his body that's . And the fire is still burning in all the places he has been. After this another baani carried the fire from Gunmurrutjpi to Caledon Bay to the Gumatj people at Ngalarrwuy. Really though the ownership is with the Mardarrpa people, all people on the Gumatj side and on the top (inland) side got their ownership from Gunmurrutjpl. That's where the crocodile was before he went from place to place, making the mardayin, making the dreaming, making the land. In the dry season he stayed in the sea, in the wet season he made rain come so that he could go back to the land and make his nest and lay his eggs. Baani is the ownership of this land, and what I do is the ceremony that I am acting: when I make the nest, when I make the place, when I make the fire, when I make young crocodiles, when I make Yolngu themselves, Mardarrpa themselves. Yolngu people will do the same things that I do. [Because this baani had the ownership, the right from Laanytjung. Laanytjung had talked to him, had told him what to do, which sacred objects to make, which sacred dilly bag, which paintings, - and baani did exactly like that because Laanytjung told him to.] The myth of baani and the myth of Laanytjung clearly function in different ways in this account. The myth of baani explains in a direct way aspects of the form of the Mardarrpa painting, relating it to specific mythological events which caused the crocodile to take the shape it did. The painting encodes many elements of the myth of baani, the bark hut, the hot snails and the fire, each of which is embedded in an elaborate sequence of mythological action. The painting and the myth also refer to features of the landscape at Gunmurrutjpi, which are transformations of events that took place there, such as the stretch of beach where the crocodile lived and the rock offshore where he threw the fire. (People avoid both these places today and say that anyone going there will be destroyed by fire.) As far as the myth is concerned, the diamond-shaped clan design is the main component of the painting that is iconically motivated. The design is not said to be derived from pre-existing markings on the crocodile's back, but to be the product of the mythological events leading to the creation of the form of the wangarr crocodile: and it signifies this transformation. The baani myth also connects Gunmurrutjpi with other wangarr beings who directly or indirectly interact with the crocodile. For example, there is a Mardarrpa place called 319</page><page sequence="9">Myth, Totemism and the Creation of Clans Yatikpa offshore from the mouth of the Gunmurrutjpi River. At Yatikpa the wangarr dugong was hunted by mokiiy ancestral spirits. The dugong dived down, pulling the boat and hunters with it, to the rock of fire left by baam, and all were incinerated beneath the waves. The dugong is usually represented with the diamond design on it, signifying the event and its connection with the crocodile. The crocodile myth and the associated paintings signify connections between the Mardarrpa clan and other clans of the same moiety which are also associated with crocodile and fire. The link with the Gumatj clan is specifically referred to in the above text. The coastal Gumatj share a similar design to the Mardarrpa, and similar clan designs signify a relationship between the mardayin held by the respective clans. Their presence on a painting signifies that the places referred to are on the same wangarr track. As the case of the dugong shows, a wangarr track does not necessarily refer to the route taken by a single ancestral being. It may reflect instead the existence of an interconnected chain of land-transforming events involving the interaction between members of the same set of wangarr beings along its length. Laanytjung's role in the interpretation is quite different from that of the crocodile. He is nowhere signified in the painting (except by implication as a wearer of the design) and does not explain the form the design takes. In the performance of ceremonies relating to Gunmurrutjpi neither Laanytjung nor Barrama plays a major role, though songs referring to their actions in designating certain mardayin as belonging to the Mardarrpa clan may be part of the accompanying manikay (song) performed at intervals throughout the ceremony.8 The dances, however, enact the events involving the wangarr crocodile, and the power names (sacred invocations) called are those of baani. The power (maarr) of the painting is the maarr oibaani and not of Laanytjung. In a sense what Laanytjung does is authorise the design and, to a certain extent, direct events; he does not create the design. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TWO CATEGORIES OF MYTH The categories of creation and inheritance need to be understood in the context of certain ideological features of Yolngu social organisation. Yolngu clans are constituted, as Williams (Ì986) has argued, through rights in, or the ownership of, certain areas of land and the mardayin associated with them. Yolngu ideology sets the establishment of particular clans at the point of intersection between the ancestral past and the time when humans occupied the world, at a time when ancestral beings still journeyed on the surface of the earth. However, the journeys of the ancestral beings cut across the territories of many different clans and, far from being the basis for the unity of a clan's lands, ancestral tracks provide linkages to the land of outside groups and form the basis of the internal subdivision of a clan's land. Rights in the mardayin of particular ancestral beings are spread beyond the membership of individual clans in two ways: through members of other clans who are related by descent to the 'owning clan'; and through the linkages established by the extension of the ancestral track across the land of many clans. Ancestral connections serve to link the members of a clan with other clans as much as they do to establish its separate identity. In effect Yolngu clans are established through the ownership of a section of a network of connected places and lands. That network transcends the individual clan. The Galpiny clan illustrates this situation clearly. Myth 1 shows that each area of Galpiny land is associated with a different main ancestral track. The grey turtle did not 320</page><page sequence="10">Morphy travel to Garrapuy or Wandapuy. Before the journey of Laanytjung the turtle mardayin belonged to Raymangi and the patriline living at Yarrmadi. One of the conditions of becoming a clan is to share joint rights in mardayin. After leaders of the three groups referred to in the myth made their decision to become one clan, the rights in the turtle mardayin were extended to the people living at Garrapuy and Wandapuy. However, the ancestral tracks themselves continue to provide the basis for connections outside the clan to other clans along their length, though the extent to which they are emphasised varies with particular circumstances. The track of the grey turtle, for example, provides the basis for linking a group of clans that own variants of the 'same' set of songs, dances, and paintings and who can come together for joint ceremonial performance. The green snake links the Galpiny to another set of clans and the sugar-bag to a further one (though the sets may be overlapping). Thus an ideological contradiction lies at the heart of the Yolngu clan. It is founded by ancestral action, yet the ancestral tracks themselves divide its lands and link it with outside groups. The clan's spiritual identity can easily be merged within the wider network. This contradiction is reflected in the fact that the same word baapumi can be applied both to the set of people connected by the same ancestral track and to the membership of a clan. In the first sense, baapumi unites a group of clans along a particular wangarr track with respect to shared affiliation to a particular set of ancestral beings. In the second sense baapumi membership cuts across wangarr tracks, linking the different mardayin by virtue of the fact that a particular social group agrees to hold them in common.0 These two senses oí baapurru are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Two senses of baapurru 3 2 1 •+■ a n p=ñ ♦- b n Q W p=ñ M- c H W e In Figure 1 the horizontal lines repre- sent wangarr ancestral tracks and the circles represent places assoc- iated with the mardayin of the respective wangarr in the territories of differ- ent clans. Clans linked by places on the same track potentially belong to a baapumi in the first sense defined above: thus each line (a-g) represents a potential basis of baapumi affiliation in this sense. The ovals which cross-cut the horizontal lines represent clans. The members of the clan form a baapumi in the second sense defined above by virtue of the fact that they have common rights in the mardayin of each of the places enclosed within the oval. Thus clan 1 has rights to mardayin of places on tracks a, b, and c, clan 2 has rights in c, d, and e, and clan 3 has rights in c, f, and g. All three clans form a baapumi in the first sense with respect to track c, which they all share. However, the shared rights and interests only operate with reference to that track. Members of clan 1 do not obtain rights to track d by virtue of their connection to clan 2. 321</page><page sequence="11">Myth, Totemism and the Creation of Clans We can now consider the way in which the two categories of myth, that which concerns the inheritance of a clan's paintings and their designation as the property of a clan, and that which concerns the creation of the designs themselves, reflect this pattern. The myths of inheritance cross-cut other wangarr tracks; they do not create groupings along the line of an ancestral track but rather designate the particular set oimardayin associated with each clan. These therefore correspond with the moiety level in that every Yirritja moiety clan is believed to have a section of the Barrama- Laanytjung mythology that specifies the set of places and objects uniquely owned by the clan. The myths of creation on the other hand, for example the baani and fire mythology, correspond with lines a - g. Although the two categories of myth at first seem to be complementary, each concerned with different levels of organisation, they can in certain contexts be used in opposition to one another. This is partly a function of the fact that the different levels of organisation - moiety, ritual alliance and clan - are, from a long-term perspective, best seen as principles of group formation, though in the short term they appear to correspond to different levels of groups on the ground. In order to illustrate how the two mythic dimensions can be used in opposition to one another I will return again to the Galpiny clan.

In wangarr time three turtles entered the sea off Green Island; they stretched out to the mainland still gripping the island with their back legs. They extended their bodies across the sea and touched the mainland at three places: Dhamarrutji in Gapuyngu clan country; Kapana, a Manapuy clan place; and Yarrmadi, the Galpiny 322</page><page sequence="12">Morphy place. Djimbuy drew me a map to show the relationship between these places connected by the turtle (Fig.2). The back of the turtle in Galpiny paintings of Yarrmadi represents a similar structure of relationship between places. The body represents Green Island and the fixed back legs and the tail represent (1) Kapana, (2) Yarrmadi, and (3) Dhamarrutji (Fig.3). All three groups share the manikay (songs) associated with the turtle mardayin. Green Island was once owned by an extinct southern clan. It was subsequently taken over by the Mangan, another southern clan represented in 1975 by two men, one of whom has subsequently died. The Manapuy clan, however, claimed joint ownership of the island with the Mangan, and by 1980 they had all but taken it over from this virtually extinct clan. Indeed one Manapuy man told me that they were simply reclaiming land which had once belonged to them. The remaining Mangan man no longer speaks his own dialect but speaks Manapuy and it appeared likely that he was being incorporated within that clan. Figure 3: The back of the turtle 1 2 3 The painting and the texts thus refer to a complex series of connections between a set of clans on the same ancestral track, a group which potentially forms a ritual alliance. When I pressed Djimbuy further about these connections he retracted his interpretation, or rather he suppressed it. He stated that Yolngu today did not really know about the connections between the places: 'We know these three places but we know them separately - Laanytjung in Yolngu time established that Yarrmadi was Galpiny and that's all I know'. At a later stage Djimbuy told me: The turtle came straight to our land and Yolngu people began to copy it. Then Laanytjung came to Yarrmadi and made it Galpiny and said "you make the turtle rangga because he cares for this place." From then on the Yolngu made this painting for Yarrmadi.' Djimbuy's reinterpretation in effect involves switching from a myth of creation, the turtle myth, to a myth of inheritance, the Barrama- Laanytjung myth. The two offer substantially different interpretations of the same fact, that is of the existence of the turtle mardayin at Yarrmadi. The former focuses attention on the turtle ancestor and creative forces independent of any one social group; it emphasises relationships between groups. The latter focuses attention on the ownership of a particular place by a particular clan. In this case it is possible to explain why the myth of inheritance was favoured over that of creation in the construction of the text. In the majority of cases Galpiny clan members were quite happy to expound on the inter-clan connections reflected in the tracks of wangarr beings that cross-cut clan territories. The green snake, for example, connects Galpiny with many other Yirritja moiety clans, though in each case a different manifestation is involved: The snakes are friends.' I was told 'they are all one company like we are one company for ceremonies today'. The connections can be viewed positively. In the Manapuy case this is not so. Manapuy, I was told, had given away their land. They were one of the clans that had revealed their sacred objects publicly at the Elcho Island memorial, in the context of a syncretic religious movement (see Berndt 1962), and were also reputed to have given some of their sacred objects to another clan. In neither case had they received anything in return. They could thus be seen by some as having ceded control over their own paintings and mardayin, and as a consequence they were thought liable to make claims 323</page><page sequence="13">Myth, Totemism and the Creation of Clans over other people's clan territories by activating mythological links. In this situation Djimbuy thought it undesirable to stress connections with Manapuy through acknowledging shared mardayin : If I show too much knowledge about their land then they will come and take over mine.' CONCLUSION In this paper I have been concerned with two component categories of Yolngu mythology which I have referred to as inheritance and creation. The first of these concerns the inheritance of paintings by a particular clan, the designation of its mardayin and the sanctioning of its ownership of land. The myths of inheritance, or aspects of mythological texts that contain programmatic statements about inheritance, represent public declarations of a clan's rights and relationships. The myths of creation concern the transformational and creative powers of wangarr beings manifest in the clan's paintings and sacred objects. Knowledge and control of these kinds of meanings of objects and paintings are also central to a clan's identity with the land and to its sense of corporateness as a group, as they manifest and represent the power of the wangarr ancestors over which the clan's members exercise the greatest degree of control. As far as the creative aspects of wangarr beings are concerned, however, control is exercised by restriction on knowledge, but it is not restricted only to clan members. In the Galpiny clan's case we can see clearly the relationship between the two aspects of myth that have been isolated, in particular as far as the dimension of paintings that relates to the integrity and independence of clans is concerned. We can see the relationship operating in terms of a dialectic between the control of wangarr powers by clans and the fact that the power itself, through the journeys of the wangarr beings, transcends group boundaries. The myths of creation concern the power of the designs and the land-transforming acts of the wangarr. Though they refer specifically to places owned by a particular clan, the wangarr being is not specific to that clan, but cross-cuts clan ownership. The external links refer to and contribute to the power of the designs, but they also provide a basis upon which other clans can make claims in the political sphere. The Galpiny as a small and weak clan are particularly conscious of this potential threat to their territorial integrity; hence they play down the significance of links between clans, or rather they emphasise the uniqueness of their own inheritance: 'we know these three places but we know them separately'. The Manapuy clan on the other hand is numerically large. Its members stress the connection between its territory and that of the Galpiny clan, emphasising that they share the same mardayin with respect to the turtle ancestral complex and stressing the similarity of the paintings belonging to the respective places. It is ironic that the Laanytjung Barrama myth of the Galpiny refers to events in the past that led to the creation of a single clan through the union of a number of small groups. The existence of the Galpiny clan is said to be the result of a conscious, though wangarr- directed decision, to unite. Implicit in the creation of a new clan are the possibilities of a clan's extinction and of the incorporation of the members of one clan by another - possibilities which dramatise the threat to a clan's existence from outside groups. I am not suggesting that the Galpiny clan myth refers to an actual historical event, but it does show the way in which such events could be given mythological sanction by projecting the restructured relationships back into the world of interaction with the wangarr ancestors. 324</page><page sequence="14">Morphy Myths of inheritance are part of the process of positioning the clans in that space/time created by the intersection of the ancestral past with the humanly occupied present. Thus we see that the two categories of myth are in many respects a reflection of the emergent nature of Yolngu clans. The way in which they are used and, in the case of myths of inheritance in particular, the reasons why they are created is a reflection of the tension between autonomy and exchange in Yolngu clan organisation. The clan is a core conceptual element and reference point of Yolngu social organisation, yet over time individual clans are continually merging and emerging. Clan identity is manufactured for the moment as if it always existed, yet the clan is always on the verge of non-existence. Clan identity is important in marriage, in land ownership, and in ritual, yet its importance lies in part through the position it occupies in a network of exchange which often operates at the level of the individual. Ironically this network of exchange and alliance is both integral to the individual clan's existence but at the same time provides the context for its disappearance. The networks of exchange are themselves fluid, changing according to contingent factors and political action, and the identity of the clan is always liable to be merged in the network of tracks, and reabsorbed in other people's myths of inheritance. The Yolngu clan exists in the temporary assertion of control over part of a network of connections which are used as the ideological bases for action and existence. The Yolngu system of knowledge involves a tension between the inner control of knowledge and the outward spread of knowledge which parallels the tension between autonomy and exchange. The clan is connected through kinship and exchange to other groups, its sacred knowledge is connected to that of other clans, its mythological tracks cross those of other countries, and rights in and knowledge of its sacred law extend to members of other groups linked by descent or ancestral track (cf. Morphy 1988, Keen 1990:100). Yet each clan will also assert that its inheritance is unique, that its paintings differ in some way from those of any other, and will try to maintain control over its religious knowledge. In maintaining control, however, it will still recognise the rights of others, will still use their mardayin in ceremonies that involve many groups, will still claim connections with other groups and other mardayin when relevant. And when, for some reason, the group whose identity was so bound up in asserting a unique relationship with a particular mardayin ceases to exist, then the mardayin itself will be incorporated into someone else's identity; when the clan ceases to exist the network carries on. The potential for isolating groups for some purposes or in some contexts, and for merging them for other purposes or in other contexts, is reflected in the structure of the Yolngu system for naming groups, as Williams' (1986:42ff.) detailed analysis shows. There are names which refer to subsets of clans along an ancestral track, or to sets of people associated with a region, or who are gathered together for a particular purpose, as well as names which identify particular groups at the level of organisation I refer to as clan. All such names have mythological reference, and the same ancestral track may be involved in labelling groups of differing degrees of inclusiveness. The system is one that allows identities to be merged in some contexts, and over time group identities can disappear either through the elimination of lower levels of distinction or through the reconstruction of the membership of the set. When relationships cease to exist at one level of the system over time because a group's membership has died out, relationships at other levels can continue. The politics of Yolngu clan organisation involves the continual maintenance of a balance between autonomy and exchange. Religious knowledge is integral to this process since the exchange of mardayin is one of the means of extending relations, and because 325</page><page sequence="15">Myth, Totemism and the Creation of Clans social and political relations are framed in terms of ancestral precedent. The strategy of Yolngu political action is to increase the number of people one is related to actively through exchange relations, marriage, ceremony, and generally through acquiring knowledge of others' mardayin , while at the same time ensuring autonomy by maintaining control of the exchanges and of one's own mardayin. The corollary of this is the ever-present threat to weaker groups and/or individuals of losing their identity and merging with others. Myers (1986) shows the interplay of similar factors in the case of the Pintubi, though in their case the absence of a strong system of clan organisation means that the struggle is worked out on a more individual basis. In the Pintupi case the ideology is no less strong than among the Yolngu that peopled 'identity, including rights and social identity, stems from the Dreaming' (Myers 1986:145). Nonetheless there is more room for the individual to negotiate his [or her] relationship with the Dreaming by claiming association with particular places or tracks and, if the claim is accepted by relevant others, the person thereby becomes accepted as a member of the cult group associated with the particular site. As Myers (1986:138) writes, In Pintupi society there are multiple pathways to membership of estate owning groups', and indeed 'the possibility of achieving a relationship to place through an active process is basic to Pintupi conceptions of identity' (ibid. :151). The cult group in this case is constituted on a fundamentally different ideological basis to the patrilineal clan, even if there is greater overlap in some of the mechanisms of group formation in the two cases than is sometimes allowed for. In eastern Arnhem Land the process of group formation is masked by the creation of clans, whereas in the case of the Pintupi there seems no need to hide the multiple bases of totemic cult formation. A sign of this may be the fact that myths of inheritance or their equivalents do not seem to have been reported from parts of Australia such as the Western Desert where totemic cult groups are the product of a negotiated amalgam of individual ties to place. In such cases there is no need to state the once and for ever transfer of authority to a particular group of people since the group is continually emerging and transforming through the coalescence of individual ties to land and the ancestral past, as part of a process of 'reallocating people to place' (Myers 1986:155). Myths of inheritance occupy the space between the world of the ancestral beings and the human world, the space in which continuous adjustments are made to make the social order and the cosmological order correspond. They protect the mysteries and the independent orderings of the ancestral past by separating them off to an extent from political process, allowing the ancestral domain to remain a potential force in world creation that is independent of the exigencies of everyday life. Employing Firth's distinction, myths of inheritance are concerned with establishing the relationship between people and totemic species or, perhaps more accurately, with creating the cosmological transects and associated areas of land that clans claim to own and that are integral to their identity. Myths of creation, on the other hand, are largely concerned with the raw materials of the cosmos, ancestral power, and the creation of the totemic landscape. Myths of inheritance are concerned with those untidy aspects of Australian totemism that Worsley (1967) thinks so incompatible with structuralist order. The sets of mardayin associated with each clan are indeed Vygotskean heaps (Vygotsky 1962), lumped together because over time they became integral to a particular clan's existence, yet liable to be rearranged into new heaps of different composition as clans rise and fall. But Worsley overlooks two things. One is that we are not dealing with sets of animal species as labels for human groups, but with animals, objects and ancestral beings that have a context and meaning through their 326</page><page sequence="16">Morphy incorporation in myths; totemism is a system of relations and a set of stories or sequences of events. The second is that the order transcends the heaps. Clans create their temporary heaps but the cosmos can always take them back again. For myths exist as part of a more abstract network of connection that the Yolngu system of knowledge keeps intact by ensuring that the rights and interests in the mardayin of a particular clan are spread widely among groups and individuals related on a variety of different bases. I am not arguing that the network itself never changes, nor that new tracks never emerge, nor that contemporary politics cannot have an effect on the form of the ancestral past and on the myths of creation. I am arguing that social reorderings do not necessarily result in cosmological change, and that in their content Yolngu myths of creation are not on the whole a Malinowskian charter for clans. That latter role is sometimes fulfilled by myths of inheritance, and it is also signified in those details of the form of the songs, paintings and dances (Morphy 1988) that differentiate one clan's mardayin from another's along the same ancestral track. NOTES 1. Research at Yirrkala between 1973 and 1980 was funded by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies and the Australian National University. This paper was given in a very different form at a seminar at University College London in 1988. I would particularly like to thank Danny Miller who helped me see what the paper was about, and Frances Morphy who helped restructure the argument. The case studies are partially disguised to protect sensitive information. 2. The distinction I am drawing here is between types of theme with which mythic discourse is concerned, here called categories , and the narrative forms in which the tokens of these categories are conventionally realised and often combined, here called texts. For reasons of style I use the term myth as a shorthand for both, except in contexts where disambiguation is necessary. 3. The myth of the Djan'kawu sisters combines myths of creation and myths of inheritance in the same actions when the sisters give birth both to the people and to the sacred objects of the coastal clans of the Dhuwa moiety (see Keen 1990:9 Iff.). The wombs of the Djan'kawu sisters provide a space within which the adjustment of totemism to group organisation takes place and at the same time allow for the collapsing of mythological time. The sacra associated with other ancestral beings such as the sand goanna are reabsorbed into the Djan'kawu sisters, to be born again with the first humans. More generally, it may be productive to view myths of swallowing and regurgitation (see Hiatt 1975b), in particular as they occur in Amhem Land, as referring to the process of the restructuring of human groups - they certainly provide powerful images of reconstitution. 4. The relationship between the human and ancestral domain as an aspect of Aboriginal metaphysical systems is insightfully analysed by Morton (1985). The space between the ancestral past and the human present is, I would argue, the space within which many metaphysical problems are worked out or addressed, presented in the many different forms of myth, ritual and sacred law. It is within this space that there exists possibility of conceptualis- ing and reconceptualising the problem of the relationships between men and women, parent and child, descent through men and descent through women, all the problems associated with the definition of categories and the differentiation of one thing from the other - for the Dreaming, as Munn (1970) has shown, is in part the creation of a fixed external form through the process of differentiation and the freezing of certain transformations. The reworking of myth enables those processes that resulted in the forms of the present, in the fixing of distinctions, to be re-experienced and for the boundaries between the categories to be re-examined. In his analysis of Central Australian myths, for example, Morton shows how the logical problem involving the relationship between continuity and disjunction, wholeness and differentiation, in the transformation from the ancestral to the human domain articulates with psychoanalytic themes associated with the Aranda unconscious. 5. Sugar-bag is an Aboriginal English term for 'bee-hive', but also the honey and larvae found within it. Since the Yolngu term which it translates has the same range of meanings I shall use the term sugar bag throughout this paper. 6. The myths recorded here are abridgements of interpretations recorded at a single telling except in the case of the second section of Myth 1 where alternative versions are referred to. Gaps have been left in the text in a few places to avoid revealing secret names. 7. Barrama as an ancestral being of the Yirntja moiety appears quite late in the literature ot the Yolngu (e.g. Wells 1971). I was told that Barrama was the Yirritja moiety equivalent of the Djan'kawu sisters, but that it had only been decided late to release the name to Europeans. Another interpretation is that the need for myths of inheritance that operate on a moiety-wide basis is in part the product of the colonial context. The past hundred years or more in north east Amhem Land may have resulted in greater instability in clan organisation and in a widening of polity - both circumstances that may favour myths of inheritance. 327</page><page sequence="17">Myth, Totemism and the Creation of Clans 8. Ian Dunlop' s film Mardarrpa Funeral at Gurka'wuy features a Mardarrpa crocodile dance which is discussed in detail in Morphy (1984:99). 9. From the writings of Donald Thomson onwards, baapurru has been seen to be a key concept of Yolngu social organisation. Its precise meaning varies according to the reference point adopted but a key component of its meaning is *a group thought, of in relation to the sacred or ancestral basis of its existence* - the group can include both the living and the dead. Williams (1986:65-70 and elsewhere) provides some very useful discussion on the topic (see also Keen 1978:31). REFERENCES BARTH.F. 1975. Ritual and Knowledge Among the Baktaman of 'New Guinea.
