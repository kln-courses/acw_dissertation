ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of the chestband in side impact conditions by conducting validation experi- ments, and evaluating its feasibility by conducting a series of human cadaver tests under side impact crash scenarios. The chestband validation tests were conducted by wrapping the device around the thorax section of the Side Impact Dummy at its uppermost portion. The anthropomorphic test device was seated on a Teflon pad on a platform to accept impact from the side via a pendulum system. Tests were conducted at 4.5, 5.7, and 6.7 m/sec velocities using round and flat impactors. Retroreflective targets were placed at each strain gauge channel on the edge of the chestband. The test was documented using a high-speed digital video camera operating at 4500 frames/sec. Deformation contours and histories were obtained using the chestband electronic signals in combination with the RBAND-PC software. These data were compared with the digital video information processed using a computer tracking system. The overall mean change in the difference in the normalized chest deformations obtained from the chestband sensors differed by 1 .38% (± SD: 0.65) when compared with the data from the video motion analysis system. When the deformations were subdivided into the medial-lateral and antero- posterior directions, and into the flat and the round impactor groups, the results indicated the mean differences to be within 2%. These findings illustrated the feasibility of the device to be used under side impact conditions. Five unembalmed human cadavers were tested with varying velocities, under rigid wall and padded interactions, and with and without initial pelvic offsets, to demonstrate the feasibility of this device to be used to obtain biomechanical data. The surrogates were instrumented at three levels: the upper band was just under the axilla at the level of rib 4, the middle band was at the level of the xiphoid process anteriorly, and the lower band was at the T10 level. Detailed autopsy was conducted following the test. Padded tests demonstrated lower AIS scores with fewer rib fractures than the rigid wall tests. The pelvic offset test produced the greatest number of injuries with a significant fracture of the acetabulum on the struck side. Chest deformation contours typically demonstrated inward compression on the struck side and outward expansion along the anterior direction. The chestbands demonstrated consistency in the output from the upper, to the middle, to the lower levels, and from test- to-test indicating their robustness. 1752</page><page sequence="2">INTRODUCTION Although frontal crashes constitute the majority of motor vehicle crashes, 25 to 35% of serious injuries in motor vehicles are caused by impacts wherein the principal direction of force is lateral to the vehicle. Federal standards for side impact protection have perhaps influenced the reduction in percentage of fatal side crashes from 34% in 1989 to 25% in 1994. Injuries due to side impact have not been reduced as much in the same period (34%, 1989 to 29%, 1994) [12]. To protect the occupant in a side impact collision there are numerous variables that may be considered including effect of arm position, padding, door design, and armrest features. The current tolerance criteria for assessing injury severity in a side impact dummy includes measures of acceleration on the body at various locations. New instruments for measuring injury severity have been developed however, such as the external peripheral instrument for deformation measurement (commonly referred to as the chestband) to gain understanding of the injury to the thorax under impact loading conditions. The use of new transducers to assess cadaver response will lead to improved understanding of human tolerance in vehicle crashes and will guide the development of future safety technologies. The purpose of this paper therefore, is to assess the use and accuracy of the chestband in side impact crash conditions, and evaluate its feasibility by conducting a series of human cadaver tests under different side impact crash scenarios. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chestband Validation Tests Experiments were done using a single 40- channel chestband and a NHTSA side impact dummy (SID) to assess the validity of chestband data under side impact loading conditions. The 40 channels of the chestband (Robert Denton, Inc., Rochester Hills, Ml) consisted of four-bridge strain gauge transducers that measured the local curvature changes of a thin metal band. Each bridge configuration was placed 25.4 mm apart and the RBAND-PC software was incorporated to convert the curvature time histories into band contours. The reader is referred to the original article by Eppinger on the development of the chestband [5]. The SID was disassembled to include only the thorax, pelvis, and upper leg structures. The head-neck structure and the outer skin and arm pads were removed (Figure 1). The chestband was wrapped around the thorax section of the SID at its uppermost portion. The chestband was viewed on end by a high-speed digital video camera system operating at 4500 f/s (Kodak Corp, Mountain View, CA). To enhance the viewing and digitizing of the chestband, retroreflective targets (3M Corp, St. Paul, MN) were placed at each strain gauge channel on the edge of the band (Figure 2). The SID was seated on a Teflon pad on a platform to accept impact from the side via a pendulum system. Tests were conducted at 4.5, 5.7 &amp; 6.7 m/s impact velocities with both round and flat surface impactors. Video output and RBAND- PC contours were compared. Digital video image data were processed using a computer tracking system (Motion Analysis Corp, Santa Rosa, CA) to determine chest deflection measurements in the medial-lateral and anteroposterior (AP) directions. The computer tracking software determined the centroid of each retroreflective target based upon relative optical density.

Retroreflective targets were placed at each gauge location to enhance viewing during high-speed video taping. Surrogate Tests A series of human cadaver tests were done incorporating increased instrumentation to assess the feasibility of using new trauma assessment measurements. A Heidelberg- type side impact sled test apparatus [8] was built for use on the deceleration sled at the Medical College of Wisconsin. The apparatus consisted of a 1 .3 meter long Teflon-coated bench with horizontal tubing that offered support for the back and head. The surrogate was seated on the bench at a predetermined distance away from the loading wall such that sled deceleration from impact caused the surrogate to slide down the bench and strike the loading wall surface. The loading wall surface consisted of four plates instrumented with a total of eleven uniaxial load cells (Interface, Ine, Scottsdale, AZ) to record the force time histories on impact (Figure 3). The loading surface was configured such that the upper plate contacted the mid thorax, the middle plate contacted the abdomen, and the lower plate contacted the pelvis of the surrogate. A lower limb plate served as a contacting surface for this region of the body. The upper edge of the thoracic plate was 40 cm vertically from the middle of the seat such that the shoulder of the surrogate did not contact the plate. This configuration was chosen to represent the approximate average window sill height for real world automobiles. The sled buck was instrumented with an accelerometer and a velocity measuring device.

The dotted circles indicate approximate locations for load cells. 1754</page><page sequence="4">Fresh human cadavers donated through the Medical College of Wisconsin's Anatomical Gift Registry Program, which has been in place for over 75 years, were used in the tests. Subjects were screened for HIV and Hepatitis A, B, and C by drawing blood prior to use. Radiographic examination of all body regions and a patient history to exclude specimens with bone disease and metastatic cancers were used to assess skeletal normality; subjects deaths were attributed to cardio- pulmonary disease. The cadaver surrogates were cleaned and dressed with a tight fitting cotton/Lycra leotard and a head/face mask to insure confidentiality. Accelerometers were fixed to the following body regions: a triaxial accelerometer on the head, triaxial accelerometers at T2 and T12, a triaxial accelerometer at the sacrum, a uniaxial accelerometer on the lateral portion of rib 4, a uniaxial accelerometer on the lateral portion of rib 8 (lateral to medial acceleration), and a uniaxial accelerometer on the sternum (anterior to posterior acceleration). The surrogates were then instrumented with three 40-channel chestbands: the upper band was just under the axilla at the level of rib 4, the middle band was at the level of the xiphoid process anteriorly, and the lower band was at the level of T10 (Figure 4). Due to limited instrumentation amplifiers available for recording, certain gauges of each chestband were not recorded such that a resulting 32 to 36 channels per band were recorded for contour assessment. A femoral cut-down was done on the right side of the specimen to obtain access to the femoral artery. A Foley catheter was inserted up the femoral artery to the iliac artery and into the descending aorta and the balloon was inflated. Pressurization of the vascular system was done through the Foley catheter immediately prior to the test by pumping approximately 1200 cc of Heparin, a blood substitute mixed with a blue dye, into the vascular system through the catheter. This was tied off immediately prior to the impact event. A tracheostomy was performed and a tube inserted to maintain access to the lungs. Post mortem fluid was pumped out of this tube Figure 4: Approximate chestband locations for human cadaver surrogates tested under side impact configurations and the lungs were exercised using a hand air pump and maintained open to the atmosphere during impact. Tests were conducted to assess the feasibility of the use of increased instrumentation at two velocity settings, with and without 10 cm of Ethafoam LC 200 padding (stiffness = 103 kPa, Merryweather Foam, OH) and with pelvic offset [9]. In total, 1 24 to 1 28 transducer channels were recorded during each test. Immediately post test, a series of x-rays of the entire body were done to assess bony damage. Chest x-rays included AP, PA, and oblique views to assess rib fractures. Pelvis x-rays were also done from multiple angles. A full autopsy was done after each test to assess the trauma to the internal tissues. Transducer data were processed to obtain resultant acceleration time histories, resultant load plate force histories, and chestband contours during the event. High-speed 16-mm film cameras and the digital video camera documented the event; there was one overhead view, one onboard anterior view and two offboard posterior views. 1755</page><page sequence="5">RESULTS Chestband Validation Tests Out of the six tests that were conducted for validation of the chestband, only slight differences were found between the video output and the RBAND-PC output. Differences between chest contours were evaluated at various time points during impact and were found to be virtually identical when overlapped (Figure 5). Figure 6 illustrates a representative output of the deformation history from the chestband sensor (RBAND- PC computation), and the overlay of the video motion analysis. The data are shown for medial-lateral and anteroposterior deformations. Qualitatively, a very good agreement was found between the deformation patterns in terms of contours and specific deformation history magnitudes obtained from the chestband sensor and the continuous motion analysis results obtained from videography. For all the tests in the medial-lateral direction, the mean change in the normalized chest deformation obtained from the chestband sensors was 1 .3% (SD: 0.5) when compared with the data from the video motion analysis. In the anteroposterior direction, the mean change in the deformation differed by 1.4% (SD: 0.8) comparing computed chestband sensor data to the video analysis. The combined overall mean differences in the two peak deflections were 1.4% (SD: 0.6). When the data were split into flat and rounded impactor groups, the above described medial- lateral deformations differed by 1 .4% (SD: 0.5) and 1 .3% (SD: 0.6), respectively. For this selected grouping, the anteroposterior deformations differed by 1 .9% (SD: 0.9) and 1.0% (SD: 0.5), respectively. These results clearly indicated that the chestband performed equally well under both flat and rounded impactors. In addition, the 40-channel output was also evaluated by removing channels to assess accuracy with less than 40 active gauges. Up to 10 gauges were deactivated prior to processing through the RBAND-PC program. With 10 gauges deactivated the contours were still accurate to within 5% throughout loading. mm 350 -.

Surrogate Tests To assess the new instrumentation techniques, five tests were done, each with a different configuration (Table 1). Two tests 1756</page><page sequence="6">Figure 6: Examples of output comparing the chestband data (dotted lines) with the video analysis (solid lines) for the medial-lateral (top) and anteroposterior (bottom) directions for a 6.7 m/s test with a flat-plate impactor. were done with padding, one at a lower velocity and one at a higher velocity of impact. One test each was done with a flat rigid wall at low and high velocities; one test was done with the pelvic load plate at a 12 cm offset. The two padding tests demonstrated lower AIS scores with fewer rib fractures than the rigid wall tests [1] The pelvic offset test produced the greatest number of injuries with a fracture of the acetabulum on the struck side. A summary of the maximum values from the various instrumentation used is given (Table 2). Maximum chestband deflections were in the range from 5 to 16 cm. The thorax and pelvic plates generally recorded higher loads than the abdomen and leg plates. Acceleration traces were filtered at SAE class 180 to obtain maximum values. High rib accelerations were recorded when rib fractures occurred on or near the rib mounted with the accelerometer. The data from the chestbands resulted in the chest contours during the event. The contours typically demonstrated inward chest compression on the left side (struck side) and outward chest expansion anteriorly (Figure 7). This anterior chest expansion was verified qualitatively on the overhead film camera and by the significant accelerations recorded by the sternum-mounted accelerometer. The chestbands demonstrated consistency in output from upper to lower and from test-to- test indicating their robustness.

Its use has been well documented in these studies and its output parameters have led to a better understanding of the impact response of the thorax under belt and/or air bag combinations [11, 14, 15]. Only recently, researchers have begun to use this device under side impact conditions with varying success. At the previous year's Human Subjects Workshop, some preliminary data were presented by the authors of this group regarding the efficacy of this device in lateral SID tests. The present work is an extension of this study aimed at providing more comprehensive data on the use and accuracy of the chestband, and as indicated in the Introduction, this was one of the purposes of this paper. The chestband results in terms of the contours as well as in terms of the deformation histories were compared with a high-speed video based motion analysis. The video information was directly transmitted to the continuous motion analyzer for processing. The RBAND-PC software provided the deformation data from the chestband sensors. The close agreement in the peak deformations which indicated an overall difference of approximately two percent (see Results section) with no apparent time shift in the deformation histories ( Figure 5) is indicative of the feasibility of the device under the studied laboratory testing conditions. It should be noted that these validation experiments were conducted with a relatively rigid testing device, and round and flat shaped impactors. These ideal conditions may not represent actual real-world scenarios. Despite these differences, and because of the relatively severe nature of the test, i.e., inducing a focal-type loading (round impactor with no load-sharing from the abdomen/pelvis region), it may be reasonable to use the chestband as a device to obtain crucial biomechanical parameters. This device has been shown to provide appropriate and meaningful data which can be used to compute secondary parameters such as the velocity of compression and the viscous criterion (product of the velocity and compression) in human cadavers and manikins [13]. After having established the feasibility of using the chestband in side impact, the second purpose of the paper, was to demonstrate its practicality in obtaining data from human cadavers with varying input conditions. Rigid wall and padded interactions, and with and without initial pelvic offsets at varying lateral impact velocities were among the conditions used to demonstrate the feasibility characteristics of the chestband device. In general, the higher velocity impact cadaver tests resulted in more trauma than the lower velocity tests. Injuries consisted mainly of rib fractures with some protruding into the lung pleura, causing a potential pneumo- thorax. The total number of injuries were generally less in this study compared to the sled test data reported by others wherein internal injuries with aortic rupture and other 1758</page><page sequence="8">35 -I 1 f upper 25~ XT X I15" -5 i 1 1 1 -20 -10 0 10 20 cm 35 -| 1 X" ' middle 25- -5 i 1 1 1 -20 -10 0 10 20 cm 35-1 1 / X lower 25- X^ i15- [ / ] -5 H 1 1 1 -20 -10 0 10 20 cm Figure 7š.

The contours are drawn such that anterior is towards the top, and body left is depicted on the left side of the graph. soft tissue trauma were documented [4, 8] The differences in test setup included shoulder contact in these previous studies in contrast to no direct shoulder contact with the load wall in the present test series. No internal soft tissue injuries occurred in the present series of tests. The only pelvic injury occurred in the test with a pelvic offset. Other pelvic offset cadaver tests in literature have reported pelvic fractures [2, 3]. Rigid wall tests done at 9 m/sec by the above cited previous study also produced pelvic fractures; however, tests done at this velocity for the present investigation did not demonstrate such fractures [3]. This may in part be due to the differences in the pelvic load plate configuration which was not large enough to engage the iliac crest region of the pelvis in the above cited study. The number and type of thoracic injuries found in the present study more closely resembled cadaver tests conducted in an actual vehicle struck by a deformable barrier [10]. The load wall forces and the accelerometer data are within the range reported in previous studies [2-4, 8]. The load wall forces, although comparable in magnitude with these studies, represent somewhat dissimilar quantities as the load wall plate configurations are not the same. The chestband data for side impact tests is a relatively new assessment tool and is therefore, difficult to compare with previous studies. One previous study however, used film analysis to obtain chest deflection of the half-thorax [4]. They reported 8.0 cm to 12.5 cm of chest deflection for rigid wall tests, 6.9 cm to 1 0.3 cm deflection for soft-padded tests, and 12.2 cm to 18.1 cm for pelvic offset tests [4]. These values are consistent with the present study's chestband deflection values. In all cases, the chest deformation pattern obtained in the form of thoracic contours at three distinct levels of the human torso, exhibited its potential to obtain biomechanical parameters. Similar extensive validation tests using human cadavers were not possible due to the inherent experimental difficulties. However, the trend in the results appears to conclude that the chestband is a very useful tool. The chestband offers a host of new data to be gleaned from side impact tests with surrogates. The shape of the contour 1759</page><page sequence="9">throughout loading, changes distinctively with the type of test condition and the body region of interest. It can be seen that a series of chest contours from the upper band (Figure 8) deform distinctively from the lower band (Figure 9). The padded wall test condition produced deformations later in the time sequence and over a longer time period than the rigid wall condition (Figures 8, 9). It can also be noted from these contours, that a single measure of displacement at a constant location may not appropriately describe the chest response under side impact. The regional and temporal changes that occur under impact conditions may be assessed with the chestband. These assessments should lead to improved injury measures and more biofidelic dummies. Despite these merits, a limiting factor lies in the amount of data acquisition as each chestband needs about 40 channels resulting in 120 channels for obtaining thoracic contours at three levels in the experiment. If one were to compute the thoracic trauma index (TTI) in a conventional manner, determine the side- wall impact loads, report the sled acceleration and velocities, record the multi-axis head accelerations in a human cadaver model, additional demands are levied on the data collection equipment [6, 7]. Needless to say, the subsequent data processing efforts also increase with these instrumentation devices. Despite these enhanced data gathering and processing difficulties, the chestband remains a promising surface mounted, non invasive, electronic tool to gather pertinent bio- mechanical information. Using the chestband data, chest deflection and velocities may be quantified at any point on the chest at sampling rates representative of the electronic data acquisition system. These secondary variables can be computed with relative ease which may assist in a better evaluation of the thoracic dynamic response and arrive at the most efficacious parameter/s to define human tolerance to side impact. The chestband is a valuable tool for assessing thoracic injury and as such will lead to improved injury indices and more biofidelic dummies.
