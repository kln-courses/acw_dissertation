<plain_text><page sequence="1">MYTHIC VISION AND IRONIC ALLUSION: BARBUSSE'S LE FEU AND ZOLA'S GERMINAL rrfr Tobin H. Jones The revival of interest in the Great War and its impact on the European's social and philosophical outlook1 has given new impetus to the critical study of the war novels of Barbusse, Dorgelès, Drieu la Rochelle, Giono, and Montherlant. Some of these novels have deserved renewed attention because of the relationships they reveal between their vision of reality and that expressed in earlier novels already judged to be of major moral, social, or artistic import. Such is the case of Henri Barbusse's Le Feu which, widely read and praised at the time of its publica tion in 1916, has been neglected since. Le Feu deserves further study by / reason of its relationship to Emile Zola's Germinal and because of the ques tions it raises about the role of literary allusion, intertextuality, and mythic consciousness in Barbusse's expression of the social and ideological im 'See Paul Fussell, The Great War and Modern Memory (London: Oxford University Press, 1975); Marc Ferro, The Great War 1914-1918 (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1973); and Frank Field, Three French Writers and the Great War: Studies in the Rise of Communism and Fascism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975).

Barbusse's Le Feu provides us with an in teresting example of how an author transforms his immediate experience of new and unfamiliar realities into mythic form and how, in turn, the mythic consciousness of his epoch may be reflected in his artistic expres sion. Perhaps most important of all, study of the novel's form leads to a sharper delineation of the relationships of literary allusion both to the broad, often unconsciously symbolic forms of mythic expression that ar ticulate a given society's image of itself2 and to the narrower linguistic concept of intertextuality whereby each literery text is seen as a transfor mation and absorption of prior texts.3 Barbusse, like many other writers during the war years, was deeply concerned about how the war and life in the trenches would affect those who served. Having fought in the Soissonnais, the Argonne, and the Ar tois, he had ample opportunity to experience with his fellow poilus the degradation and the absurdity of the war and their effects on the com mon soldiers' moral outlook. Barbusse first recorded his impressions of his war experiences in a series of notebooks in which we can see the first sketchy outlines of what was later to become Le Feu, Journal d'une Escouade.* These notebooks reveal that many of the incidents described in Le Feu derived from events he had observed at the front. They also suggest that Barbusse, a journalist imbued with the literary traditions of Naturalism and Symbolism, clearly recognized that the truth of his experiences would be most effectively rendered only as an image of his impressions. Thus despite the first-person narration and documentable origins of many of the incidents that make up its episodic form, Le Feu is not a journalistic account. The work is first and foremost an ideologically didactic novel with virtually no value as an accurate historical portrayal of the war. Bar busse neither pretends to dissect the war's political underpinnings nor inquires into why individuell battles were won or lost. His use of incidents that were verifiably part of his personal experience was to raise social and ideological questions having supposedly universal moral implications while focusing on the common man, his experience, his attitudes, and, 2/n Myth and Literature (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1975), William Righter argues that the same basic and broad presuppositions are shared by many scholars of myth—Calvocoressi, Eliade, Lévi-Strauss, Cassirer, Jung, and Barthes among them—namely that " 'Myth' is, at varying levels of consciousness and degrees of articulateness, a way of describing the foundations of social behaviour. . . . Societies depend in some fundamental way upon an elusive and indefinite body of beliefs, many of them not wholly conscious or susceptible of precise formulation, but which are crucial to any sense a society may have about itself' (p. 10). 5Julia Kristeva, in Sêmiôtikè Recherches pour une sémanalyse (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1968), says that a text "se construit comme mosaïque de citations, tout texte est absorption et transformation d'un autre texte. A la place de la notion d'intersubjectivité s'installe celle d'intertextualité, et le langage poétique se lit, au moins, comme double" (p. 146). ♦Barbusse's notebooks, written at the front in 1915, have not yet been published in their entirety. An edited selection of entries has appeared with the new edition of Le Feu. See Henri Barbusse, Le Feu, Journal d'une Escouade (Paris: Elammarion, 1965). Further references to Le Feu will be to this edition, indicated in the text by LF. 216 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">most important, his emerging awareness of his significance against the awesome background of world-wide war. Barbusse's war experiences convinced him that social change must occur and that a way must be found to correct the injustices of the class structure and class consciousness that had prevailed during the Belle Époque and that he believed nourished the nationalist sentiments reponsible for the war. His commitment to socialism and the Clarté movement and his visits to Moscow have all been well documented and studied. Le Feu also has been most thoroughly studied as a political and ideological statement and has consequendy suffered at the hands of those scholars such as Frank Field and Jonathan King who tend to see it primarily as an expression of Barbusse's social views.5 This critical view of Le Feu makes it easier to understand the relative obscurity that the novel has known since receiv ing the Prix Goncourt after its publication in 1916. Such an image of the novel is of the same cloth as that formed by a public increasingly ill at ease about the social unrest during the last years of the war and the postwar period. The study of Le Feu as an ideological statement only intensified what had already become a classic confrontation of artistic and social concerns and further contributed to the neglect of Le Feu's artistic character. This neglect now appears all the more unfortunate because Le Feu is richest in its implications as an artistic and social statement when studied from a literary rather than an ideological perspective. Barbusse's portrayal of the degraded society of the front lines realizes its greatest effects in exploiting the earlier literary traditions of Symbolism and Naturalism and the mythic consciousness of a reading public familiar with these tradi tions. More specifically, the novel draws heavily on its reader's awareness of Emile Zola's Germinal, to which it bears marked thematic resemblance and which provides a ready measure of Le Feu's originality and artistic merit. That Barbusse intended his reader to be conscious of the relation ships between his novel and Zola's is of course a moot point, but that he highly esteemed Zola's work is documentable fact.6 And though Bar busse neglects the mythic structure of Germinal almost entirely in his 1932 essay on Zola, there is substantial textual evidence to support the notion that Germinal serves as a formal and thematic point of reference in the reading of Le Feu. Because Germinal's form and moral point of view are now, as they were in 1916, the more familiar in any comparison between the two works, the present study will treat Barbusse's novel as a reflec 5See Frank Field's Three French Writers and the Great War and Jonathan King, "Henri Barbusse: Le Feu and the Crisis of Social Realism," in The First World War in Fiction: A Collection of Critical Essays, ed. Holgar Klein (New York: Harper and Row, 1977), pp. 43-52. 6In his Carnets, Barbusse lists those works which in 1915 he considered to be masterpieces of literature. Among them are the symbolist poetry of Verlaine and Mallarmé, Maupassant's Notre Coeur and Bel Ami, and, most important to this study, Zola's La Débâcle and Germinal (LF, p. 304). BARBUSSE AND ZOLA 217</page><page sequence="4">tion of and a response to Zola's novel and the moral and artistic vision that it expressed. Several critics, including Pierre Paraf and Jean Relinguer, have discussed Barbusse's interest in Zola's social ideas and the relationships between Le Feu and La Débâcle, Zola's novel of the Franco-Prussian War. There are some important similarities, for in Zola's portrayal of the brutal horrors of war we can see both stylistic and thematic préfigurations of Barbusse's novel. These resemblances have prompted Jean Relinguer to argue that Barbusse had sought through his work to carry the spirit of Zola's social ideas into the twentieth century.7 However many the broad affinities between Zola and Barbusse and despite the similar subject mat ter and thematic resemblances in the treatment of war as a social phenomenon, it is not Zola's La Débâcle that serves as a primary source of thematic and formal resonance in the reading of Le Feu. It is Germinal, as the referent in an allusive relationship, that places Barbusse's social vision in relief against Zola's positivistic faith in the eventual evolution of a new social order. As Allan Pasco has pointed out in his study of the allusive use of Stendhal's Le Rouge et le noir in Barbey d'Aurevilly's "Le Rideau cramoisi," allusion consists of the perception of a relationship between a minimum of two terms, at least one of which is explicit, perception stimulated internally by a text (if we limit ourselves to literature). In the most knowing examples of the device, one term does not equal the other; one term cannot, then, communicate the allusive meaning, be it semantic or affective; the meaning is communicated only metaphorically by the reader's synthesis of the two terms. Of course, the term "qu'on ne dit pas" has to be known to the reader; otherwise the text would never succeed through its own means in establishing the relationship and communicating the meaning.8 Professor Pasco goes on to detail the extent of the allusive relationship between the two works by describing clearly marked similarities and resonances among themes, images and verbal motifs, and patterns of ac tion, including those specific events or incidents in one work that echo events in the unstated work. These kinds of similarity are the benchmarks of allusion that serve to signal the presence of the metaphorical relation ship of which Pasco speaks. As he later points out, the similarities need not be grasped by the reader in a conscious way; they may present themselves to the unconscious.9 Indeed, even assuming that the reader of the allusive work is familiar with the work alluded to, it seems reasonable to believe that his grasp of the relationship may border on the purely intuitive inasmuch as it may never go beyond a precritical and unanalytical 7Jean Relinguer, "Le Centenaire d'Henri Barbusse," La Pensée, No. 172 (November-December 1973), p. 122. •Allan H. Pasco, "A Study of Allusion: Barbey's Stendhal in 'Le Rideau cramoisi'," PMLA, 88 (1973), 461. "Pasco, p. 463. 218 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="5">recognition that in one work there is resonance with another. Therein lies the indeterminate area between intertextuality, myth, and allusion. Myth, even as defined according to such widely different ap proaches as those of Cassirer, Jung, or Barthes, must be seen as operating on an intuitive as well as a conceptual level. Its appeal to the reader of literature is to recognize intuitively those patterns of structures that serve as a basis for analogous relations or parallels and that thereby render the unfamiliar more familiar. In its broadest, most basic, and least specific uses, myth may thus be seen as the already acquired or more accessible term of such unconscious metaphorical relationships. Intertextuality, though linguistically more determinate, is also broad in its scope. It borders on both myth and allusion because it does not necessarily preclude the role of the unconscious in the processes of expression and may borrow from myth those structured relationships that are characteristic of specific mythic traditions. Moreover, as Julia Kristeva argues, it may even refer quite overtly to specific literary models through stylistic resemblances in what she calls paragrammatic texts.10 Theoretically common to all three— allusion, mythic resemblance, and intertextuality—are the documentable similarities of the kind that Allan Pasco brought to light in his discussion of allusion. The distinctive characteristics of each lie in the relative specifici ty of the metaphorical relationships and, finally, in the reader's understand ing, formed on the basis of both extratextual and intratextual contexts, of what the implied intentionality behind their presence might be. Le Feu resembles Germinal in many of its thematic concerns and pat terns of action, occasionally with such an apparent resonant similarity that the existence of a purposeful relationship between the two seems quite unequivocal. The broad parallels that exist between the patterns of action of the two novels are the most obvious. Both works detail a struggle by an oppressed class seeking to change the social conditions responsible for its misery. Both works treat the oppressed initially as having been reduced to a nearly subhuman character (frequent animal imagery is common to both). Neither novel changes the conditions, but both hold out the pro mise of change as the consequence of a new social consciousness whose emergence occurs in conjunction with natural symbols (germination and dawn are the two most obvious). But although the patterns of action are Often parallel, one can also see certain structural similarities that create resonances of a formal, affective kind. "La vision," the first chapter of Le Feu, exemplifies how this resonance may result from similarities be tween the ways in which the exposition of thematic concerns in each of the two novels relates structurally to the novel as a whole. Zola presents his primary thematic concerns through a mystifying and often deceptive '"See especially Kristeva's chapter, "Poésie et négativité," in Recherches pour une sémanalysc, pp. 246-278. BARBUSSE AND ZOLA 219</page><page sequence="6">ly religious vision of the mine as it is seen from Étienne's point of view and the selective .lighting of the miners' lamps. The effect is to create of the mine, Le Voreux, an anthropomorphic image that conveys Étienne's uncertain understanding of the economic realities underlying established social structures. To achieve this, the scenes in the first part of the novel create a sense of disorientation and distancing against which the abstract, symbolic vision of Le Voreux and the deification of capitalism as "ce dieu repu et accroupi, auquel dix mille affamés donnaient leur chair, sans le connaître"11 are given tangible mythic dimension. "La vision" opens with a description of a sanatorium somewhere in the Alps. On its terrace, which "est isolée dans l'espace et surplombe le monde," gather rich but sick old men from the upper crust of Euro pean society. "Détachés des choses et presque de la vie," these "con templateurs placés au seuil du monde" (LF, pp. 8-9) envision impending social change as power passes to the thirty million soldier-slaves from all nations who have been forced by nationalistic powers to fight in a war they had not begun. This préfiguration of radical change in Le Feu has the same function with respect to the development of the novel as does the préfiguration of change that is implied as the "vent de mars" described in the first lines of Germinal becomes the "vent de révolte" that Etienne senses after his first descent into Le Voreux with the Maheus (OC, V, 75). The tone and social implications of Barbusse's metaphorical vocabulary echo the language Zola uses in establishing the mine as a mythic presence dominating the thematic developments of the novel. The last few sentences of "La vision" clearly evoke lines from the last chapters of Part One of Germinal as well as the description of Le Voreux's inundation at the end of the novel. Like Zola's metaphorical vision of the mine as a monstrous matrix of future revolt, the old men's vision in Le Feu serves as a symmetrical préfiguration of the emergence of a new life from the chaos of war that is promised in the novel's last two chapters. Dans leur vision des formes sortent de la plaine, qui est faite de boue et d'eau, et se cram ponnent à la surface du sol, aveuglées et écrasées de fange, comme des naufragés monstrueux. Et il leur semble que ce sont des soldats. La plaine qui ruisselle, striée de longs canaux parallèles, creusée de trous d'eau, est immense, et ces naufragés qui cherchent à se déterrer d'elle sont une multitude. . . . Mais les trente millions d'esclaves jetés les uns sur les autres par le crime et l'erreur, dans la guerre de la boue, lèvent leurs faces humaines où germe enfin une volonté. L'avenir est dans les mains des esclaves, et on voit bien que le vieux monde sera changé par l'alliance que bâtiront un jour entre eux ceux dont le nombre et la misère sont infinis. (LF, pp. 9-10) The parallels between the above passage from Le Feu and descriptions in Germinal extend even to the language. Not only are there overt references "Emile Zola, Oeuvres complètes. Édition établie sous la direction de Henri Mitterand (Paris: Fas quelle, Cercle du Livre Précieux, 1967), V, 75. Further references will be indicated parenthetically in the text as OC, V. 220 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">to germination in both novels, "Une rebéllion germait dans ce coin étroit, à près de six cents mètres sous la terre" (OC, V, 66), but certain elements of Barbusse's vision recall Zola's description of the mine and its surround ings: the "immense plaine" and the geometric line of the canal which cuts through its swampy terrain (OC, V, 74). Barbusse's introduction of thematic concerns is necessarily less symbolic in "La vision" than Zola's is in Part One of Germinal simply because his work is less extended, being both more explicit and less metaphorical in its representation of social conditions. But his allusions to Zola's imagery in the first part of Germinal and the parallels between the symmetries of themes and images of the two novels in their expositions and their conclusions are able to invoke the reader's familiarity with Zola's epic novel as a means to enhance the vision that Barbusse presents in a shorter, more compact work. Barbusse portrays the poilu' s involvement in global war against a background of natural and gnostic imagery that recalls the Naturalist and Symbolist traditions of the nineteenth century.12 His use of the imagery of earth, water, air, and fire to represent the impact of war on the natural order and to set the stage for the revolt of nature recalls the quaternary imagery in Germinal. Zola's use of this imagery serves two ends: it func tions narratively to describe the physical conditions of the miners' misery and as part of a mythic structure to mark each stage in the emergence of their social awareness. The earth in Germinal is both a generative matrix and a hostile environment. Le Voreux swallows men and uses them; yet it is from the mines, seen mythically as the bowels of a natural Earth Mother, that a new race of workers will rise and go forth to do battle with the ogre of capitalism. Air also has a dual character—it is both the life-giving air pumped by the lungs of the mine-monster and the dread subterranean "grisou" responsible for slow asphyxiation and sudden ex plosions. Like earth and air, fire and water may be seen in both "real" and mythical roles, and the latter are again associated primarily with the subterranean: there are the underground fires of Tartaret and the vast underground sea of Le Torrent that eventually engulfs Le Voreux. Barbusse's use of the quaternary, with its emphasis on earth and water imagery, is sufficiently comparable to Zola's uses to reinforce the notion that the mythic vision of Germinal was at least subconsciously at hand as he composed Le Feu.. However, there are also significant differences. The earth imagery in Barbusse's novel certainly resembles that in Ger minal inasmuch as it establishes an opposition between natural orders and the works of man and finally places natural order in a dominant role. But in Le Feu the Earth does not serve as a generative matrix; its role is primarily that of contrasting natural and social causes. Moreover, Bar 12For a convincing study of Zola's use of gnostic imagery and natural myth in Germinal, see Allan Pasco, "Myth, Metaphor, and Meaning in Germinal, " The French Review, 46, iv (1973), 739-749. BARBUSSE AND ZOLA 221</page><page sequence="8">busse's use of the elemental natural imagery in Le Feu, although thematical ly similar to the imagery of Germinal, has no truly mythic role. For in stance, the term boyau that Zola uses to suggest the anthropomorphic presence of Le Voreux as a giant earth-monster Barbusse uses in Le Feu only to represent the trenches in the argot of the poilu. This is less an example of mythic anthropomorphism than a metaphor rendering the un familiar more familiar through the association of perceivable characteristics. Barbusse's use of boyau is only one example among many of the inevitable assimilation of new wartime phenomena through the semantic extension of colloquial peacetime language. Other examples would be the use of moulin à café or machine à coudre as names for the machine gun and saucisse for the observation blimp.13 If Barbusse exploits the term boyau, it is less to evoke the earth as a devouring monster or a generative matrix than to reflect a vision of nature's wholeness whose integrity was being invaded, violated, and destroyed by man's war. Air and fire, like the imagery of the earth, further emphasize man's corruption of nature. The air is tainted by the acrid odors of sulphur, black powder, and human waste, fouled by the rot of flesh, and poisoned by gas. Fire is that of bombs, shells, and rockets; the stars that light the night sky are the flares and starshells fired to illuminate targets. This imagery is especially prevalent in the second half of Le Feu where Bar busse combines the imagery of fire and air in order to develop the Biblical themes of martyrdom and sacrifice in "Argoval" and "Le poste de secours." This in turn sets the stage for the apocalyptic imagery of the last chapters and the theme of retribution and the coming of social justice already prefigured in "La vision." It is primarily through the imagery of earth and water that Barbusse drives home his point in the final chapters, "La corvée" and "L'aube." The survivors of the narrator's work party, lost in the labyrinthine trenches and decimated by the heavy bombardment during the night, watch a trans formed landscape emerge in the half-light of dawn. Water covers the plain, flooding the trenches and erasing all visible evidence of the war. The nar rator and another survivor, Paradis, are stunned by what they see. On voit des lacs, et, entre ces lacs, des lignes d'eau laiteuse et stagnante. Il y a plus d'eau encore qu'on n'avait cru. L'eau a tout pris; elle s'est répandue par tout, et la prédiction des hommes de la nuit s'est réalisée: il n'y a plus de tranchées; ces ,3For a stylistic study of such analogies in Le Feu, see Pierre Van Rutten, "Le Style du Feu de Barbusse," La Pensée, No. 172 (November-December 1973), pp. 125-134. Van Rutten finds the analogies to be based on similarities in external form, especially in the representation of the human anatomy, such as "cylindre" for "ventre" and "macaroni" for "boyaux." As Van Rutten argues, "Ces métaphores ne manquent pas d'un certain humour noir qui serait un réflexe de défense, une tentative d'évasion du tragique" (p. 133). It should be noted that such imagery is not characteristic only of Barbusse's novel; it may be found in many World War I French novels (for example, Dorgelès' Les Croix de bois), and to my knowledge in none do terms such as boyau assume mythic functions. 222 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">canaux, ce sont les tranchées ensevelies. L'inondation est universelle. Le champ de bataille ne dort pas, il est mort. (LF, pp. 266) The water has not only obliterated the most obvious symbols of the war, but also all distinction between enemy and friendly soldiers, who slowly begin to rise from their graves of mud and water. It is a moment of death and of rebirth. Tous ces hommes à face cadavérique, qui sont devant nous et derrière nous, au bout de leurs forces, vides de paroles comme de volonté, tous ces hommes chargés de terre, et qui portent, pourrait-on dire, leur ensevelissement, se ressemblent comme s'ils étaient nus. De cette nuit épouvantable il sort d'un côté ou d'un autre quelques revenants revêtus exacte ment du même uniforme de misère et d'ordure. (LF, pp. 268-269) The storm of fire and water has brought about an awesome, apocalyp tic vision of the end of the soldiers' world as they had known it. The flood, like the Biblical deluge, symbolizes retribution, but, even more im portant, it gives rise to hope amidst the desperation of ruin. It is in this latter respect that the imagery of the deluge evokes parallels with Zola's Germinal and the drowning of Le Voreux. The imagery of the dawn, the whitening of the light, and the lactescent appearance of the water all cor relate with the thematic development of a new social awareness against the background of Biblical imagery of retribution that both novels share in common. As the counterpoint to such similarities in the thematic treatment of their respective social visions, there are some marked differences in how Barbusse and Zola each presents his vision as an expression of his ideological outlook. Some of these differences are quite obvious. For in stance, Zola employs simultaneous perspectives in the early chapters of Germinal to contrast the lifestyles of miners and mine owners. The most immediate effect is irony born of exaggerated opposition, but the technique has a second, somewhat more subtle, function as well, because it shows the multiplicity of conditions and causes from which the strike and responses to the miners' revolt will eventually evolve. This may or may not be an intentional reflection of the Darwinian evolutionary paradigm. But Zola's structuring of events clearly makes their relationships the con sequences of deterministic processes analogous on a social scale to those occurring in the natural selection of "the most fit" of competing alter natives from an extensive pool of potential causes. The implication of this structure in Germinal is that the reader witnesses the evolution of a new awareness of what can be a future society that, mythically presented as being today only in a stage of germination, will be tomorrow the in evitable consequence of today's conditions. In contrast, Barbusse gives his novel a chronological order without stressing causal relationships among the events. Absurdity rules as the chance of natural events and man's irrational actions conflict. Social change BARBUSSE AND ZOLA 223</page><page sequence="10">must therefore be imposed, and we see it promised as a reponse to social need. Instead of a causal, deterministic process, there is a structure of polar symmetry between social evil and social good, between injustice and justice, wherein the dominant presence of evil calls for the institution of good. Thus the impetus behind social change in Le Feu is not evolutionary but revolutionary. In keeping with this basic difference, many of the ap parent parallels between Germinal and Le Feu are in fact examples of a transformational use of Germinal's themes, images, and patterns of action and event to obtain a sometimes startling effect of negation. Thus, although the miners of Montsou parallel the poilus of Le Feu, whom Barbusse represents as both the "matière de la guerre" (LF, p. 279) and the "pauvres ouvriers innombrables des batailles" (LF, p. 283), the underly ing vision and mechanics of change in the two novels are very different. Barbusse exploits several modes of irony to establish the need for social justice and to show that it may be realized only through the radical elimina tion of existing social structures. The most obvious of these is a situa tional form of irony that results from the negation of the anticipated out come of an episode by a contrary event. The unsettling effect of this kind of irony usually depends on the reader's assumption that a set of norms are in force and on the presence of a necessary symmetry between the anticipation of an event and the satisfaction of its realization. It is a form of irony that, to be successful, requires a conscious awareness of prevail ing cultural norms. It also requires a degree of distance between the fic tional realm and the reader who must remain sufficiently uninvolved to be able to go beyond his immediate emotional response to the effect of the novel and consciously to recognize the implications of its author's treat ment. In this kind of situational irony the frustration or total negation of anticipation constitutes a failure in the system that the reader has as sumed to be in force. Viewed in this manner, it becomes clear why, just as poetic justice is a morally symmetrical response to the reader's expec tations, the negation of those expectations would be morally asymmetrical and thus a poetic injustice according to the same presumed cultural system. Some complex forms of this kind of moral asymmetry abound in the situational irony of Le Feu. An example of a fairly simple kind occurs in Chapter XII, "Le portique," where war turns a tranquil moment in springtime with all its pastoral bliss and promise of regeneration into a fatally deceptive interlude. In this episode, the narrator accompanies his comrade Poterloo on a visit to the ruins of his village. Despite the loss of his home, Poterloo is steadfastly optimistic about rebuilding his life after the war. During the return to the squad and the march of the troops back to the front lines, Poterloo remains optimistic. Suddenly he is decapitated by a single shell fired at random by an anonymous hand. Barbusse intensifies and complicates the irony of Poterloo's death by denying not only the validity of Poterloo's optimism but also the validity 224 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="11">of the reader's interpretation of the traditional literary symbols he used to invite the reader's initial belief that such optimism was well founded. Not only is there a contrasting lull in the war as natural order is restored in a harmonious, romantic correlation of hope and pastoral setting, but there is the presence of theatrical imagery to reinforce the reader's an ticipation of change. As the narrator and Poterloo pass what appears to be a doorway, the fog clears and the sun warms the fields that burst anew with natural life. The doorway reflects the feelings of the moment, and, although no more than an accidential composition from the debris of war, Poterloo and the narrator see it charged with a suggestion of symbolic paths, a transition to another world where natural order dares to reign. A la fourche des deux boyaux, sur le champ, au bord, voici comme un portique. Ce sont deux poteaux appuyés l'un sur l'autre avec, entre eux, un enchevêtrement de fils électriques qui pendent comme des lianes. Cela fait bien. On dirait un arrangement, un décor de théâtre. Une mince plante grimpante enlace l'un des poteaux et, en la suivant des yeux, on voit qu'elle a déjà osé aller de l'un à l'autre. (LF, p. 137) A second description of the doorway reveals the deceptive quality of this first vision. The weather abruptly turns foul as the troops move up to the assault trenches. The clouds mask the sun, and a heavy rain obscures the land. The support trench which Poterloo and the squad follow is no longer "blond, sec et sonore" admirable for its "belle profondeur géométrique, ses parois lisses polies par la pelle" {LF, p. 137); it has become a tunnel leading downward into blackness. Suddenly, like a not quite familiar landmark, the doorway looms, no longer as a sign of tran sition to pastoral peace but menancing in its presence, a brutal recogni tion of the "meaning" of context. Où sommes-nous? Je lève la tête malgré les vagues de pluie, hors de ce gouffre où nous nous débattons. Sur le fond à peine distinct du ciel couvert, je découvre le rebord de la tranchée, et voici tout d'un coup apparaître à mes yeux, dominant ce bord, une espèce de poterne sinistre faite de deux poteaux noirs penchés l'un sur l'autre, au milieu desquels pend comme une chevelure arrachée. C'est le portique. (LF, p. 140). Only moments later Poterloo is decapitated. It is through the ironic use of Germinal as the designated term in a pattern of allusion that Barbusse undermines his reader's faith in the system of conventions and values associated with the moral and aesthetic prin ciples of Naturalism. The two works in this relationship thus cannot be symbolically equivalent nor their mutual implication demonstrably deep, for that would make Germinal a thematic presence functioning as an ex planatory model for the reader of Le Feu. The use of Germinal is not primarily to render Le Feu more familiar or to make the understanding of its message or aesthetic import more easily accessible. Instead, Ger minal functions as the familiar model of a system that does not work; its allusive presence in Le Feu is to suggest how completely the madness BARBUSSE AND ZOLA 225</page><page sequence="12">and irrationality of the most unnatural war yet known to mankind had negated all natural processes including the evolutionary social vision it characterized. Thus, those events, themes, and images in Le Feu that evoke the mythic patterns of Zola's novel often have the ironic effect of alluding to a naturalistic system, faith in which can only encourage false hopes in the reader. By undermining the validity of this allusive content through the use of situational irony, Barbusse leads us to become more conscious not only of the moral asymmetry between the actual outcome of events and what the literary echoes of Zola's mythic vision lead us to anticipate but, most important, of the inadequacy of that mythic vision. An example of this ironic use of allusion may be seen in Barbusse's treatment of love. Love and sexuality play a central role in Germinal where Zola contrasts the natural instincts and animal sexuality of the miners with the spiritual and philosophical value of Etienne's figurative union with the dying Catherine in the flooded galleries of Le Voreux. Zola op poses these two kinds of love, the physical and the metaphorical joining of male and female, to provide a mythic correlative to the development of Etienne's social and philosophical growth. In Le Feu Barbusse merges the same contrasting modes of love in his portrayal of the simple but sensitive and good-hearted Lamuse who desires Eudoxie, a young, sylph like figure of innocence. Lamuse, "l'homme-boeuf ' (LF, p. 13), a man of earthly instinct and emotional sensitivity, is powerfully drawn to Eudox ie's ethereal beauty. Meanwhile Eudoxie is portrayed, also in a combina tion of physical and moral contrasts, as the "femme-biche" to Lamuse's predatory "faune" (LF, p. 59). In his portrayal of Eudoxie, Barbusse frequently opposes images of black and white that echo the imagery Zola used to describe Catherine in Germinal. The whiteness of both Catherine's and Eudoxie's skin con trasts with the blackness of the prevailing conditions: Catherine's chlorotic paleness is in sharp opposition to the coal she mines, and Eudoxie's brilliant hair and pale skin stand out against the smoke-blackened villages at the front. In both cases, whiteness has the symbolic connotation of purity and blackness that of man-made contamination and the disruption of naturell orders. Despite her relations with Chaval, Catherine reaches puberty only shortly before her union with Etienne and her death, and Eudoxie, as her name suggests, is persistently seen as the epitome of the still innocent and naive, well brought-up young girl. But that is about the extent of the parallels in their symbolic characterization. Barbusse avoids the metaphorical and mythic suggestions of the evolutionary pro cess that Zola emphasizes. Catherine's eyes are green, a color in keeping with her role as the symbolic Queen joined to Etienne's King in the gnostic progression from the Nigredo (blackness, death, chaos, corruption) whereas Etienne is trapped in the mine through the Albedo (whiteness, as in Etienne's changed hair, dawning) when he is rescued from Le Voreux 226 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="13">to the Rubedo (redness of the sunrise) at the novel's end.14 Eudoxie's eyes, on the other hand, are black as night, but they have no apparent sym bolic import: "on voyait dans sa face pâle, les taches nocturnes de deux yeux immenses" (LF, p. 51); "elle se penchait et présentait ses yeux de nuit et sa face pâle qui, vivement éclairée par tout un côté, semblait porter un croissant de lune" (LF, p. 52). The chiaro-oscuro imagery that Bar busse uses to describe Eudoxie may best be understood as a part of a greater system of contrasts between the light and the dark sides of the war and is of a kind with the contrasting imagery of earth and fire and night and day so prevalent in the middle sections of Le Feu where the contradiction of natural symbolic meanings bodes a constant menace of death. "Tire clearest parallels between Eudoxie and Catherine occur in the ways that death and love are linked to convey meanings transcending those explicitly rendered. Whereas the union of Etienne and Catherine in the bowels of the earth has overriding mythical meanings related to the growth of Etienne's social awareness and spiritual maturity, the "union" of Lamuse and Eudoxie has immediate social and moral im plications. As a false echo of Etienne's union with the dying Catherine, Lamuse unwillingly embraces Eudoxie's already putrescent body that falls on him when he accidentally unearths it in a sap. The negation of like* symbolic meanings that we might have anticipated by reason of the similarities between the two episodes frustrates all "natural" hopes and desires by placing them in a losing conflict with the brutally absurd realities of war. Thus, the episode of Lamuse and Eudoxie, like other examples of ironically undermined parallels between Zola's and Barbusse's novels, makes the mythic nature of our moral and social assumptions more visi ble. It forces us to go beyond intuitive acceptance of the conventional paradigms of the established social order to achieve conceptual understand ing of their negative moral function in Le Feu. Parallels with Zola's novel are, in this sense, visibly allusive in nature. Their ironic reversal in Barbusse's novel serves to uncover the underly ing mythological assumptions that, in an extension of these two novels' dissimilarities, we ultimately come to see as social and political in their implications. The mechanics of this process are essentially those which Wayne Booth described as typical of the reader's activity in dealing with all stable forms of irony.15 In understanding the form of ironic allusions seen in Le Feu, the reader passes through four stages: 1) a rejection of literal or of conventional literary meanings; 2) a trial proposal of alter ,4For a more complete description of the variant ways in which these states might interrelate in the literary use of alchemical and gnostic traditions, see Carl G. Jung, Psychology and. Alchemy, trans. R. F. C. Hull (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, Bollingen Series, 1968), XX, 227-232. 15See Wayne C. Booth, A Rhetoric of Irony (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1974), pp. 10-12. BARBUSSE AND ZOLA 227</page><page sequence="14">native meanings; 3) a decision about the author's knowledge or beliefs which may be based on evidence from outside sources but is more fre quently a consequence of broadly accepted norms which the work itself respects; and 4) a reconstruction of meaning in harmony with the set of norms established by the work itself. That these four steps are pro gressive, albeit nearly simultaneous in occurrence, is important primarily because they move the reader's activity from the intuitive, atemporal modes of grasping form and assimilating it as part of familiar patterns in his unconscious and unthinking perception of reality to a conscious activity that proceeds in the orderly, causal, and deductive manners necessary to the logical elaboration of explanatory concepts. Thus the most significant differences between Zola's Germinal and Bar busse's Le Feu reside not so much in the relative degrees of sophistication of their thought and social visions or even in their faith in the inevitabil ity of social change. The most meaningful differences lie in the manner in which each uses mythic patterns to realize his social vision. Zola's use is dependent for its effect on the reader's unconscious recognition of the similarities in pattern between a gnostic progression of thematic and animistic motifs on the one hand and social and philosophical developments on the other. The reader's intuition of the parallels among the patterns of image, theme, and event is primarily one of mutual reinforcement as myth supports a social vision and the social developments of the novel reinforce our subliminal awareness of mythic traditions as explanatory devices. In this process, we come to accept the social language of Ger minal as a natural symbolic order, just as the natural symbolic orders represented through mythic motifs are the metaphorical terms for the social orders that the novel depicts. One myth is thus mirrored in another. In Barbusse's Le Feu, however, the reader's activity cannot remain on an intuitive level because of the ironic negation of the natural mythic norms evoked by allusion to the model that Zola's Germinal represents. In effect then, the reversal of the norms represented by Germinal and alluded to by Le Feu becomes a mise en question of those myths that the former postulates as an explanation of the naturalistic substrata of reality. This leads to the questioning of conventional anthropomorphic views of natural orders in conflict with the absurdity of the new realities of trench war fare. Ultimately, we can see in Barbusse's ironic use of myth, especially the prior literary uses of myth to which he alludes, the need to reassess the then accepted social and philosophical beliefs. His novel thus stands with Germinal as a call for a new social awareness. But it also stands apart by reason of the revolutionary processes of change that Le Feu's contraven tion of literary traditions suggests as the inevitable consequence of the new social conditions created by the Great War. 228</page></plain_text>
