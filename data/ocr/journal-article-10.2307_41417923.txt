Railroad tracks, tele- graph poles, and mountainous landscapes unfurl before you through cinematic projection. Or rather, as soon as you have properly lost your bearings, you are pro- jected through the landscape by means of the cinematic ensemble. Thomas Edison's turn-of-the-century film catalogue described the film as follows: This scene was taken shortly after the completion of this railroad in 1899. The impression received by the audience is that of riding on the pilot of an engine. Shortly after starting, you plunge into the darkness of the tunnel, afterwards to emerge, and crossing a high trestle skirting the edge of a deep chasm, you continue to wind about among the mountains and gorges. The ice-covered peaks of the distant mountains form an ever changing background.2 This short description of Panoramic View of the White Pass Railroad (1899) - a section of which appears in the film installation in question, namely, Stan * This essay benefited from the feedback of audiences at Columbia University and NYU, conversa- tions with Alexander Horwath, and the assiduous responses of Malcolm Turvey. 1.

Overture. 1986.</page><page sequence="4">154 OCTOBER Douglas's Overture (1986) - served primarily to entice potential exhibitors to pur- chase the film, a so-called "panoramic picture" or "phantom ride" popular at the turn of the century. The descriptive text is nowhere to be found in Douglas's Overture ; instead, a voice intones six passages, which begin: When I had put out my candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time to say to myself: "I'm falling asleep." . . . At the same time, my sight would return and I would be astonished to find myself in a state of darkness. . . . Nearly midnight. . . . When I awoke in the middle of the night, I could not even be sure at first who I was; for it always happened when I awoke like this, and my mind struggled in an unsuccessful attempt to discover where I was, everything revolved around me through the darkness: things, places, years I had lost all sense of the place in which I had gone to sleep I would fall asleep again and, thereafter, would reawaken for short snatches only: just long enough to hear the regular creaking of the wainscot, or to open my eyes to stare at the shifting kaleidoscope of the darkness. . . .3 If you linger in the installation long enough - roughly six minutes - the dis- embodied voice begins the cycle anew. This aural loop is preceded by a visual one, precisely half its duration. Linked by a series of long, dark tunnels, three short (approximately one-minute) film segments follow in succession: one from Panoramic View of the White Pass Railroad and two similar sequences from Panoramic View of Kicking Horse Canon (1901). The result is a six-minute aural loop (comprising six literary passages) overlaid with two three-minute silent film loops. But because the three film sequences do not differ markedly to the untrained eye - one traverses a valley floor, another hugs the side of a mountain; all begin and end in tunnels - the structure of the piece cannot be discerned readily. The effect is that of déjà vu as the first film segments return accompanied by unfamiliar passages - or, more pre- cisely, accompanied by passages at once new and strangely familiar. For, as many listeners recognize, the text derives from the opening or "Overture" of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. 3. See Stan Douglas, Stan Douglas (Paris: Centre Georges Pompidou, 1993), p. 122.</page><page sequence="5">In Search of Lost Space 155 More familiar with Proust's novel than with Edison's panoramic pictures, most commentators have read Overture in terms of time and memory or as a con- fusion of reality and dream. Only one critic, to my knowledge, has looked closely enough at the films and listened sufficiently to the texts selected and edited by Douglas to identify the single recurring theme that unifies the passages and binds them to the image: darkness.4 Proust's bedroom, Edison's tunnels, and Douglas's installation are all dark spaces. Indeed, Douglas's Proust interrogates space much more than time. And his is hardly an aberrant reading. As Georges Poulet has aptly demonstrated, "From the first moment - one could almost say also: from the first place - in the account, the work of Proust asserts itself as a search not only for lost time, but also for lost space."5 It is the darkness of Proust's bedroom that serves as a space-time machine; his corporeal memory transports him to his child- hood room in Combray as well as to rooms in Tansonville, Balbec, Paris, Doncière, Venice, and into bed beside the warm, curled-up body of an oneiric girl; the bed- room, finally, is a proxy for the very darkened room in which Proust slept during the day and composed his introspective epic at night. Where Proust weaves an immeasurable text around these mnemonic destinations, Douglas tarries in the kaleidoscopic darkness of a gallery or a cinema. Like Proust's bedroom, Douglas's sites serve as space-time machines to cinematic sites now long forgotten. These spaces, after all, are not so different. As the Surrealist Robert Desnos avowed: "For us and us alone, the Lumière brothers invented the cinema. There we were at home. Its darkness was like that of our bedrooms before going to sleep."6 In Overture , darkness is the condition of possibility not only for the installa- tion, but also for the loop structure.7 For what appears to be a single, continuous panoramic picture or phantom ride is, in fact, a montage of three discrete sequences stitched together at the invisible seams of dark tunnels: the train enters one tunnel only to exit another. The years and miles that intervene between the short segments are elided by the darkness of the tunnels.8 And it is here, in the tunnels, that Douglas stages his most significant interven- tion in what is otherwise largely a work of appropriation and recombination. Douglas augments the darkness of the tunnels - a darkness marred by the residual light near 4. Mark Bartlett foregrounds the darkness but argues for its dispersal through light: "Douglas takes us directly to the filmic moment in which darkness is dispelled and time is revealed; not any time, but the symbolic liminal edge of the deep night, when all things dark are revealed."

Douglas's black box galleries were never entirely black. Current installation instructions for Overture stipulate a black wall only behind the projection screen; the other walls are to be painted a uniform 10-15% gray, the same shade as the carpet. Early installation practice varied. 8. There are also two subtle jump-cuts within individual panoramic views.</page><page sequence="6">156 OCTOBER the mouths of the tunnels and pocked with the scars of age and multiple media transpositions (from 35mm film to paper print and, finally, to 16mm film) - with the absolute darkness of black leader: the dark passages in the tunnels are artificially extended by opaque filmstrips. This artificial, interpolated darkness - long enough and foreign enough to refuse diegetic integration - belongs less to the film than to the space of reception. According to Douglas, "one is returned to the space in which one is standing staring at a blank wall beside this whirring machine producing the image."9 At regular intervals, Overture shifts the focus from the image to the space, from the work to the viewer, from the medium of film to the institution of cinema. In this regard, Overture is hardly unique. Comparable film installations, however, tend to isolate darkness as an obstacle to overcome. As Claire Bishop argues in regard to sev- eral multi-screen installations (including Douglas's Win , Place or Show [1998]): "Tellingly, many of these works do not immerse the viewer in darkness: dark space (with its mystical and mystifying atmosphere) would run counter to the focused ratio- nality and concentration needed."10 In Overture , darkness is not an impediment to critical inquiry but rather its vehicle. Douglas is thus "contemporary" as Giorgio Agamben recently defined it: "The contemporary is he who firmly holds his gaze on his own time so as to perceive not its light, but rather its darkness."11 What is metaphoric for Agamben is, for Douglas, literal, physical, corporeal. Douglas's darkness, however, is historical as well as phenomenological. The somatic experience of darkness opens onto its historicity: the contemporary is shot through with the past. The years traversed by the work - the years between the capture of Edison's panoramic pictures (1899-1901) and the composition and publication of Swann's Way (1908-1913), the inaugural volume of Proust's In Search of Lost Time - witnessed a radical transformation in the institution of cine- ma: not only its narrative forms but also its sites and technologies of reception. A multiplicity of improvisational, repurposed, and short-lived sites - with equally diverse sets of spectatorial conventions - gave way to the first structures built pri- marily for the exhibition of film, namely, the classical movie theater conceived and constructed as a standardized, if not quite monolithic, technology of cinemat- ic reception. Overture , in turn, arrived at a defining moment in the museification of the projected image: the work took its final shape over nearly a decade, begin- ning in the mid-1980s - a ten-year period that saw the rise of the black-box gallery as a standardized, if not quite monolithic, site of artistic reception.12 Overture s cur- rent form differs fundamentally from that assumed by the piece when first exhibit- 9.

The residues of its initial, hesitant presenta- tions forge an essential - if unintended or even unconscious - link to the initial, tentative presentations of film at the turn of the century. The strength of Overture - its modes of exhibition no less than its images and texts - lies in its capacity to bring these two media archaeological moments in dialogue. This essay, then, effects a double recovery: of the multifarious forms and exhibition formats of Overture and, through these forms, of the residual force of cinema archaeology in the art of the present. This essay argues that Overture was and remains at once a pioneering film installation and a meditation on the installation of film at the dawn and dusk of the twentieth century. Where the end of the century witnessed the dispersal of film across disparate sites and media - a trend that has accelerated wildly in recent years - the century began with the quest to secure for it a home. Overture links cin- ema's late dispersal with its early homelessness to foreground its potentialities and pitfalls, its unrealized dreams and thoroughly consummated nightmares. In Overture , the medium of both dreaming and waking is darkness. By granting a mul- tifarious history to this darkness, Douglas galvanizes alternative futures. His guid- ing query - enunciated alongside Samuel Beckett - is: "Why in another dark or in the same?"13 For Overture is, above all, a meditation on mediated darkness. * From the first, Stan Douglas was a cinematic artist, challenging the very foundations of cinema as a historical, technological, and ideological institution. Fittingly, his professional artistic career began in a cinema - but without films. Douglas's first solo exhibition, "Slideworks," was a midnight screening at the Ridge (Movie) Theatre, Vancouver, in 1983. Early work included slide pieces like Jazz (1981), which mimicked the staging and lighting effects of film noir, and Residence (1982-83), which consisted of a series of views of an apartment block.14 Built on the Omni-Q Projector Dissolve Unit, a programmable double slide projector and audio component designed by Commercial Electronics in Vancouver for corporate conventions, trade shows, and the like, Douglas's early slide pieces were pro- grammed for obsolescence. Neither Jazz nor Residence survives. At the Ridge Theatre, Douglas also exhibited Deux devises (1982-83), the sole slide work Douglas later migrated to Audio Visual Laboratories (AVL) slide-show computers and which, consequently, endures in the present.15 13.

As the title suggests, Deux devises was to be a double emblem inaugurating Douglas's career proper: all earlier works were abandoned. Deux devises consists of two formerly independent slide pieces, Breath (1982) and Mime (1983). Breath couples a sound recording of Charles Gounod's song for tenor "O ma belle rebelle" (с. 1864) with projected English translations typed in white script on monochrome gray slides. Mime shares its basic structure with Breath but substitutes a 1936 recording of Robert Johnson's "Preachin' Blues" for Gounod's Second Empire chanson and includes, in place of subtitles, close-up photographic slides of Douglas's lips not quite synched to the music. From a contemporary, white, North American vantage point, Breath's dis- tance is inscribed in language, continent, and century. Mime offers more familiarity, but distances its white audience through race. That Douglas's own biography shares little with Johnson's short, shadowy life disallows any simple identifications. From a media archaeological perspective, it is important to note that each part of Deux devises omits an integral component of the multimedia experience that is modern cinema. In Breath , the cumulative effect is something like a foreign- language film projected without images. In Mime , sound and images are roughly synchronized, but the latter proceed in fits and spurts that hint at the illusion of movement only the better to mock it. Placed within what Charles Musser has</page><page sequence="9">In Search of Lost Space 159 dubbed a "history of screen practice," where "cinema appears as a continuation and transformation of magic-lantern traditions," Deux devises adopts the role of perfect forebear to Overture , with its turn-of-the-century spectacle of motion and retrospective insinuations of continuity editing.16 But rather than repeat the emergence of cinema as tragedy or farce, Douglas mobilizes the incongruities and disjunctions of the cinematic ensemble to clear spaces for critical reflection - an aspect of Douglas's work identified early on by curator Barbara Fischer: Instead of simply producing a film, however, Stan Douglas makes use of the multi-faceted aspects of the cinematic "machine" - photography, film, sound recordings, and even, most recently, television - in order to exam- ine the way in which technology affects culture and functions in it. His projections and installations open onto the site of cinema as that theatre in which technology and, in particular, the simultaneous reproduction of image, sound, and text not only comes to represent but also produce cul- ture. Cinema here is realized as the site of an ongoing dialectic between culture and industry, technology and the imagination, and, most of all, between the spectator's desire and entertainment.17 In as much as Deux devises helped Douglas to question the various tech- nologies assembled and hidden by the cinematic apparatus and the mechanisms by which the assemblage constructs cultural meaning and viewing subjects, the work served its titular function as emblematic statement. Indeed, Deux devises mapped much of the terrain Douglas would later traverse, not least: obsolete technologies, constructed identities, and translations (linguistic, media, or oth- erwise). But Deux devises proved somehow insufficient - enough so that Douglas sought out yet another new beginning, yet another overture to his oeuvre. For if cinema would be realized as the site of an ongoing dialec- tic, he would have to begin with an interrogation of the sites of cinema. And if Overture marked the culmi- nation of this effort, its ori- gins lie not in Breath or Mime , not even in Jazz or Residence , but rather in an earlier slide piece, a hitherto unknown slide version of Anthony McCall's Line Describing a Cone (1973).

The film begins as a coherent line of light, like a laser beam, and develops through the 30 minute duration into a complete, hollow cone of light. . . . It is the first film to exist solely in real, three-dimensional, space. This film exists only in the present: the moment of projection. It refers to nothing beyond this real time. (In con- trast, most films allude to past time.)18 McCall Line Describing a Cone. 1973. With access to McCall's description but not to the work, Douglas, then a stu- dent at the Emily Carr College of Art in Vancouver, set out to re-create the piece with the more modest means at his disposal. He used two slide projectors, a dis- solve unit, and 162 slides. Douglas first drew a circle of India ink with a compass on a piece of vellum and covered it with a piece of white paper, exposing the circle frame by frame. To photograph the drawing, he enlisted the service of Kodak technical pan film in a camera with a motor drive and then mounted the high- contrast negatives in pin-registered slide mounts. To fill the room with haze, he utilized a Rosco chemical fog machine. Douglas's reconstruction not only antici- pated important aspects of his later work but also established the conditions for the eventual gallery exhibition of Line Describing a Cone. McCall generally relied on the dust, humidity, and cigarette smoke that gathered, along with assembled audi- ences, in 1970s New York lofts. Douglas capitalized on the 1979 commercial intro- duction of Rosco fog machines to free the piece from its reliance on assembled audiences and external contingencies. He thereby paved the way for the intermit- tent spectators of gallery installations. Second, unlike McCall's "normal" 16mm projector, configured for a single screening, the double slide projector and dis- 18.

What Douglas extracted from Line Describing a Cone is clear: the centrality of the real, three-dimensional space and actual duration of cinematic projection. His shift in emphasis is equally evident. McCall, still very much in dialogue with the London Filmmaker's Co-operative with which he was associated prior to his 1973 arrival in New York, polemically exclaimed that his piece referred to nothing beyond the real space and real time of its projection. Douglas's appropriation, by contrast, insisted not only on allusions to past times but also on highly choreo- graphed dialogues with past spaces. And whereas McCall punctuated the present through light, Douglas would recall the past through darkness. * In order to historicize the space of cinematic reception, Douglas first had to evacuate it. In the late 1980s, multiple forces conspired against the effort. First, materialist film theory demanded that the apparatus be bared. McCall, for exam- ple, stipulated that "the projector be inside the viewing space, i.e., it should not be inside a projection booth. As the focal point, and the source of light, it is an inte- gral part of the film."19 (Today the materialist stipulation has become something of a fetishization of the outmoded; it's thus no surprise that Douglas - and McCall - now work primarily in digital media.) Second, technical and logistical constraints necessitated the use of a hulking black box, which occupied the center of the galleries in which Douglas first installed Overture . The curator who first exhibited Overture described the ensemble as "a wood box painted black which looms ten feet high to dominate the Gallery space."20 The black box housed the primitive looping device, projector, and speakers. Despite efforts to minimize its presence, this black box garnered progressively more attention in each subse- quent exhibition. To no avail, Douglas constructed a somewhat less ponderous box when, at the end of the year, he installed Overture in the Vancouver Art Gallery's Broken Muse exhibition.21 A year later, installed in Perspective '87: Stan Douglas , a solo exhibition at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the black box suddenly shifted from eyesore to ersatz subject. Noting that the narrator's voice - that is, Proust's narrator as recorded by Vancouver-based writer Gerald Creede - emerged not from the image (as in traditional cinema) but from the black box, the curator averred that the box, "realized as a sculptural object, is prominently positioned in the midst of the viewing space. It is as though the booth embodied the position of 19. McCall, "Two Statements," p. 251. 20. Jane Young, "The Mechanics of Memory," ed.

Overture. Installation views: Witte de With, Rotterdam , 1994 ; Surrey Art Gallery , Surrey, Canada, 1986 ; Vancouver Art Gallery, Vancouver, 1 986. When installed, there's a quite large eight-and-a-half- foot-high projection box - vaguely anthropomorphic with the lens for an eye and the speaker for a mouth and I guess the fan for an ear - talk- ing at the projection, trying to understand its condition but never being able to leave this fascinating specular image.23 The sentiment was echoed succinct- ly in the pamphlet accompanying a 1991 San Francisco Museum of Modern Art exhibition on the projected image: "The machine is anthropomorphized."24 Cumulatively, these descriptions - issued by the curators and the artist - lit- eralized nearly to the point of parody that unsettling quality Michael Fried attributed to certain Minimalist works, which create an experience "not . . . entirely unlike being distanced, or crowded, by the silent presence of anoth- er person ; the experience of coming upon 22.

This description echoes the statement published in conjunction with the " Overture/ Television Spots" at Optica (Montreal, 1988): "As a metaphor for the position of the subject in relation to the object, Overture demonstrates the mechanics of our rela- tionship to the artwork - By installing the projec- tion equipment where the spectator is normally situated . .</page><page sequence="13">In Search of Lost Space 1 63 literalist objects unexpectedly - for example, in somewhat darkened rooms - can be strongly, if momentarily, disquieting in just this way."25 That Douglas would eventually replace the anthropomorphized black box with a black-box gallery testifies not to a Friedian struggle against "theatricality" in favor of "absorption." Quite the con- trary. As Fried cogently observed, cine- ma - that is, the physical absence of actors, the projection from behind the spectator, and the screen devoid of objecthood - is "automatically" absorb- ing.26 Cinema and other highly mediat- ed environments engender a phenome- nology fundamentally different from the immediacy or presence expected - at least until recently - of one's physical environment. As Alison Butler aptly notes: "In a mediatized environment, contemporary gallery filmmakers can no longer derive critical effects from refer- Douglas. Overture.

In an extended footnote, Fried recommended an inquiry into the phenomenology of cinematic reception - a recommendation at once presciently ahead of and pitiably behind its time: the phenomenology of cinematic reception had been a preoccupation of countless film critics and theorists (not to mention cinema operators) in the first decades of the century, but became a source of philo- sophical inquiry again only in the late 1960s and 1970s, shortly after Fried's seminal essay. In retro- spect, it appears that the agon between theatricality and absorption that Fried places at the center of modern art may be but a footnote to the conditions of cinematic reception (anticipated in various nine- teenth-century technologies). Forty years on, it seems Fried has shelved the issue indefinitely, or, in his words: "The whole question will have to be taken up again on a future occasion."

Furthermore, one cannot reveal darkness through illumination. The darkness of a cinema or black box gallery establishes a paradigm very different from that offered by Minimalism. In Overture , Fried's phenomenology of presence and theology of "present- ness" - the absorption achieved by great works of art - gives way to Douglas's media archaeology of absence. The eventual removal of the anthropomorphized machine from the gallery - an excision that unfolded over nearly a decade and that required a sojourn into the cinema - was an acknowledgement, on Douglas's part, that the site of cinema would have to be confronted on its own terms. First, as any number of film theorists have observed, the substitution of an artificial subject position for the spectator is most successful with the elimination of the camera/projector from the 27.

Whereas the Minimalist works attacked by Fried foreground the physiological and institutional construction of space, Douglas's media installation highlights the physiological and institutional annihilation of space that undergirds cinematic and, indeed, many other mediated environments. Any serious meditation on the site of cinema by Douglas would thus require the removal of the black-box "object-cum- subject" from the gallery. 28.

Television Spots , which was first aired during regular commercial breaks on local Canadian television stations in 1987, comprises twelve short works (rough- ly fifteen to thirty seconds each). Droll, incongruous, and devoid of commercial content, the videos proved disconcerting enough that home viewers reportedly called into the station "wondering if the spots were some form of teaser and ask- ing when the real ads would be airing."31 In 1991, Douglas refined this project and created another dozen short sequences for broadcast television under the banner of Monodramas . As with Television Spots , most of the works in Monodramas lack dénouements or even narrative arcs. Aired repeatedly, one per night, the pieces are utterly forgettable upon first viewing. The television pieces are short, but they feel long: the takes are long, the shots few, the messages withheld; they are exercises in endless deferral. Collectively, Television Spots and Monodramas are canny détournements of late-1980s commercial broadcast television in Canada. But only - and this is their most significant feature - when they were actually broad- cast on television. As Jonathan Crary observed at the time: "Video art, paradoxically, depends for its intelligibility on its isolation from television. It can exist only in the cloister of gallery-museum space or wherever the video monitor claims autonomy and independence from major networks of distribution."32 Douglas unabashedly situ- ated his work within precisely such networks of distribution rather than in art- world sanctuaries: In a way, showing them in the gallery is a cheap shot, it's an easy way to criticize commercial convention, because people will see them differ- ently in that environment. I use the galleries mostly for the conve- nience of having access to the letterhead, which makes getting access to the airwaves much easier; institutions like talking to other institutions. But I'm interested in the reaction of people who don't specifically set out to see them.33 30. This liquidation of the gallery coincided with the rapid decline of the cinema as the primary site of reception for movies. By 1986, according to Douglas Gomery, receipts for rentals and sales of prerecorded tapes (principally movies) for the first time exceeded the box-office take in the United States.

Organized, but did not host. For the Gallery itself housed almost nothing of substance.34 To be sure, the "monodramas" were on view in the gallery, but they were presented on monitors and interspersed with appropriated advertisements that re-created the experience of watching television at home - the site of the main attraction. The loops in question - Overture and Subject to a Film : Mamie (1989) - were not on view in the gallery at all but instead were screened at the nearby Starlight Theatre from noon to 5:00 p.m. on January 18 and 19, respectively.35 The presen- tation of Overture at the Starlight Theatre was the impetus for the removal of the hulking black-box projector from future gallery exhibitions. The fertilization of Overture across gallery and cinema is thus a seminal component not only of its exhibition history but also of the form it ultimately assumed. Nevertheless, Douglas recently disavowed the importance of theatrical exhibition in the history and structure of Overture. As co-curator of Beyond Cinema - a 2006 Berlin exhibi- tion presented in two venues, the Hamburger Bahnhof museum and the Kino Arsenal cinema - Douglas enumerated the criteria that undergirded the choice of venue for each work: Works that are materially realized, using projection as a material with extension in space, will be shown in the Hamburger Bahnhof and works that use the window metaphor are being screened in the Arsenal Kino - as opposed to making an art gallery into a cinema.36 Overture was exhibited in the Hamburger Bahnhof; projector, looper, and other equipment were removed from the gallery space and secured in a pròjec- 34. The Monodramas were broadcast on BCTV during late-night programming from January 13 through February 5, 1992. The works exhibited exclusively in the gallery were hardly independent; they were, on the one hand, framed photo-textual treatments of the Monodramas, i.e., the residues of an earlier piece, and, on the other, Accompaniment to a Cinematographic Scene: Ruskin B.C., a photo-textu- al mock-up for a future piece. 35. Douglas's Marnie is something of a 1980s remake of a pivotal office burglary scene from Alfred Hitchcock's late classic Marnie (1964). Shot on distressed black-and-white film (as opposed to Hitchcock's Technicolor), devoid of recorded sound, and looped just before the eponymous heroine can open the safe, Douglas's Marnie transforms Hitchcock's psycho (analytic)-thriller into glorified surveillance footage of an anonymous corporate office. In retrospect, the 1992 removal of Marnie from the gallery gains particular resonance, as the history of the Starlight Theatre quite nearly replicates the transformation effected on Hitchcock's film. Designed and built as the Bay Theatre by the Dominion Construction company in 1938, just as Hitchcock was lured West, the movie theater thrived during the golden age of Hollywood, struggled in the 1980s, and, in 1994, closed permanently, only to be landmarked and reopened as retail and corporate office space at the end of the decade. The five-hour exhibition of Marnie in the Starlight Theatre testifies to the productive imbrication of Douglas's works within the larger socio-economic media networks, not least the death and dispersal of theatrical film. 36.

And yet, as Douglas was well aware, Overture emphatically under- mined any simple opposition between the cinema and the museum, between the metaphoric window and material extension in space. It was the great merit of a 1998 exhibition in Vienna to exploit, rather than suppress, Overture s radically ambivalent position vis-à-vis exhibition venues, past and present. Ghost Story: Nachbilder des Kinos at the Künstlerhaus, Vienna, was orga- nized around the displacement of this opposition.37 Three 16mm film installa- tions by Douglas were augmented by the still works of roughly a dozen other artists. Douglas's work, in particular Overture , afforded the opportunity for an his- torical, conceptual, and institutional exploration of the relationship between the museum and the cinema - specifically, the Künstlerhaus gallery and its physically contiguous but programmatically distinct cinema. Built in the 1860s, the Künstlerhaus was the venerable home of Austria's oldest artists' association; after World War II, a cinema, known as the Künstlerhaus Kino, was appended to the original building. By the late 1990s, the cinema was a profit center for the Künstlerhaus, which outsourced the traditional art-house programming to Constantin Film Verleih. The curators of Ghost Story : Nachbilder des Kinos worked to bring the two exhibition venues into dialogue. At the center of this dialogue was Overture. On the one hand, there was a rel- atively traditional exhibition on the second floor of the Künstlerhaus, including two film-based installations by Douglas. On the other hand, there was a film pro- gram that ran - not unlike Douglas's first movie-theater exhibitions - outside nor- mal screening times, often while the exhibition was closed. These two venues cor- responded closely to Douglas's conceptual opposition between "material with extension in space" and "the window metaphor"; the link between them was Overture. Screened as a loop projection, daily from 10:00 a.m. until 3:00 p.m. (after which Künstlerhaus Kino film programming resumed), Overture was a film installa- tion installed in a classical cinema. Programmatically tied to the art exhibition on the second floor but occupying the same space, architecture, and technology as the film program, Overture made for a disconcerting bridge between the cinema and the gallery: the 280 seats in the theater remained largely vacant and the emptiness contributed to the sense of the death of cinema.38 And yet the ensemble of a continuous, repeated short film program with 37. See Alexander Horwath and Bert Rebhandl, Ghost Story: Nachbiler des Kinos (Vienna: Künstlerhaus, 1998). 38. This emptiness is a necessary component of the theatrical installation of Overture. As Scott Watson remarked in regard to the 1992 shift from the gallery to Starlight cinema of Overture and Subject to a Film: Mamie. "Both pieces have, however, evolved so that they can be screened in cinemas, again running contin- uously. There they address the legendary collective. But in actuality, unable to sustain the repetitiousness (potentially unending) of the work, the audience will be small and diminishing, coming and going, mak- ing a collective response all but impossible."

Alexander Horwath - co-curator of Ghost Story and now director of the Austrian Film Museum - recently issued the following dictum for film preservation: "In film the 'artifact' to be transmitted into the future is not just (but also) the strip, not just (but also) the apparatus [i.e., projector], not just (but also) the screening space; what needs to be transmit- ted into the future is the set of relations between them while they are in performance - the working system."40 Overture is in no way a historical reconstruction of the working system tied to Edison's panoramic pictures. And yet the parameters delineated by Horwath are not dissimilar to Douglas's stated ambitions: I had this notion of the idioms of media at certain moments. Instead of a medium being transparent . . . the possibilities of certain mediums are used at certain moments in history for particular purposes. And those requirements change over time. I was thinking "what kinds of possibilities, of representations of time, of duration, of space and of culture we lose as these idioms become historical and then disappear, or become anachronistic to audiences?" That's something which I've always been looking at in order to find and reconstruct an historical idiom that is contemporary with the subject-matter I'm just trying to address in the particular works.41 In place of medium-specificity, Douglas engages the historical specificity of media. Rather than fetishize technological obsolescence, he disinters historically contingent subjectivity. Douglas's media idioms - coupled with Horwath's working systems - provide a compelling matrix in which to situate Overture ,42 Overture does not preserve the original 35mm nitrates; the 16mm safety prints are reconstruct- ed from the Library of Congress paper film collection. Nor does the projector lay claim to historical fidelity, irrespective of its position inside or outside the gallery 39. This mode of spectatorship - punctuated by the declaration "This is where we came in" - sur- vived in North America long enough for Douglas to attend kung fu movies in this fashion. It also dove- tails with the expectations for gallery installations - expectations Douglas has thwarted in recent works like Inconsolable Memories (2005) and Klatsassin (2006). As Douglas has noted, the conceptual underpin- ning for these works is their variable loop structure, as first explored in Overture.

Nor, finally, does any installation of the work - in the Starlight Theatre, Künstlerhaus Kino, or any of the galleries and muse- ums in which it has been exhibited - reconstruct the original working systems associated with the Edison footage. Rather than attempt archival preservations of the film, the projector, or the screening space, Douglas inscribes the working systems within the work: "I usually hide the gear in my installations - because it's already visible. . . . All these things are in the image."43 In the case of Overture , that which is vis- ible in the image, that which preserves - and can- cels - past working systems and media idioms is artic- ulated through darkness. * Before we can delve back into Overture s dark- ness, however, it is imperative that the original work- ing systems associated with Edison's panoramic pic- tures or phantom rides be enumerated. For it is through these systems that we can best access Overture s darkness. Panoramic pictures are films that resemble the views from railway cars or, more pre- cisely, the moving panoramas that simulated them.44 Train travel, panoramas, early cinema, and a host of other nineteenth-century technologies of vision par- took in what Wolfgang Schivelbusch has termed "panoramic perception," a form of perception that "no longer belonged to the same space of the per- ceived object: the traveler [or spectator] saw the objects, landscapes, etc., through the apparatus which moved him through the world."45 Shown in 1900, the Trans-Siberian Railroad Panorama, for example, sat spectators in mock railway carriages and presented them with a plethora of screens moving at various speeds: faster in the foreground, slower in the dis- G.

Accompanied by sound effects and an explanatory narrative, the moving panorama simulat- ed the experience of train travel.46 Overture not only references but also re-creates the experience of early panoramic pictures or, more specifically, phantom rides. Phantom rides were a sub- genre of panoramic pictures shot from the front (often the cowcatcher) of a train. They construct a point of view that is at once highly subjective - the viewer assumes the perspective of the camera - and almost entirely inaccessible, even to a train conductor. As the rival components of the name suggest, phantom rides produce a sense of vision and motion at once highly corporeal and disembodied. Early reviewers of Overture , not unlike turn-of-the-century spectators, described the encounters as "vertiginous."47 In some phantom rides, the darkness of the tun- nels competed with the sublimity of the landscapes and speed of the train for the attention of the viewer. The raw attraction of the darkness of tunnels was described in the following terms in 1897: The train was invisible and yet the land- scape swept by remorselessly and far away. The bright day became a spot of darkness. That was the mouth of the tunnel and toward it the spectator was hurled as if a fate was behind him. The spot of black- ness became a canopy of gloom. The dark- ness closed around the spectator being flung through the cavern with the demo- niac energy behind him.48 As the novelty wore off, phantom rides general- ly - and tunnels in particular - were turned into vehi- cles for embryonic narrative structures. One such film was G. A. Smith's Kiss in the Tunnel (1899), which Bamforth. Kiss in the Tunnel. 1899. 46.

What Happened in the Tunnel. 1903. depicted a couple embracing in a railway carriage.49 Smith recommended that exhibitors insert the film into the mid- dle of a phantom ride, after the train entered the tunnel. (The black windows of the painted sets were thereby justi- fied by the ostensible darkness of the tunnel.)50 Others quickly developed the gag further. Ferdinand Zecca's Flirt en chemin de fer (1901) depicts the same basic scene, but with a window view of the passing landscape matted in so that the film no longer required a separate phantom ride. Sigmund Lubin's Love in a Railroad Train (1902) portrays a man's frustrated efforts to steal a kiss from a female passen- ger as the train enters a tunnel: when they emerge from the darkness, the gentleman discovers he has kissed her baby's bottom instead. Working for Edison, Edwin S. Porter com- bined elements from each of these films to create What Happened in the Tunnel (1903), the most famous exemplar of the micro-genre. The frustrated lover, played by Gilbert M. "Broncho Billy" Anderson, makes flirtatious overtures to a female passenger, who is accompanied by a maid, either black or in black-face. Extended darkness indicates that the train has entered a tunnel. "The tunnel," as Jane Gaines has argued, "is especially titillating as represented on the screen because it places us in relation to a double dark- ness - the theater auditorium and the screen - referencing the thrilling frustration of the old carnival attraction [i.e., the love tunnel] in which we are thrust into darkness and whisked out again."51 When they emerge from the dark tun- nel - and the image reappears on-screen - the man discov- ers that he is kissing the maid, the women having switched places and now brimming with laughter at his expense. In a variety of forms - during the same years in which Edison's phantom rides were shot and exhibited - the depicted darkness of tunnels figured prominently as cine- matic attraction and nascent narrative. The doubled dark- nesses - that of the spaces of reception - varied even more profoundly: music halls, dime museums, fairgrounds, the- aters, and makeshift spaces of all kinds. As institutional film historian Douglas Gomery argues, in the years immediately prior to the rise of nickelodeons (roughly 1900-1905), 49. The film was immediately remade by the Bamforth Company. 50.

Motion pictures had no permanent home."52 The doubled darknesses were similarly homeless - constituted by not one but many different sites, experiences, and subjects of cinema. The exhibition history of Overture attests to working systems in the throes of radical transformation and reinvention. So too the historical working systems that animated Edison's phantom-ride footage. At the 1904 St. Louis Exposition, George C. Hale introduced the paying public to Hale's Tours, a simulated, cinematic train ride. Spectator-passengers sat in a real railroad car and felt the jolts and the sways of railroad travel (manufactured by mechanical and, eventually, electrical equipment beneath); they heard the sounds of the rail, felt wind in their hair, and saw, in place of the front wall, a screen onto which phantom rides were projected from the rear. With the help of Hale's Tours and its many imitators, spectators could travel the world - phantom rides were shot in Tokyo, Switzerland, British Columbia, Ceylon, Hanoi, Vesuvius, and countless other exotic destinations. Hale's Tours were among the first permanent, widespread, specialized motion-picture shows, and they played an essential role in establishing dedicated cinematic spaces. They served as a short- lived but significant bridge between cinematic peep shows and vaudeville presenta- tions, dominant at the turn of the century, and the provisional moving-picture the- aters that dotted progressively larger swathes of the North American landscape dur- 52.

As home-video technology helped cement the dominance of television, the 1980s witnessed a return of cinematic homelessness (or its reluctant domestication) - a homelessness hardly conjoined with innocent openness.</page><page sequence="24">174 OCTOBER ing the second half of the decade.53 Overtures marginally diegetic darkness recalls these diverse and inchoate darknesses but also hints at a more fundamental dark- ness whose hegemony was still to come. As for the experience of these simulation rides, Lauren Rabinovitz argues that Hale's Tours "articulated a seemingly contradictory process for the spectator: they attempted to dematerialize the subject's body through its extension into the cinematic field while they repeatedly emphasized the corporeality of the body and the physical delirium of the senses."54 Such embodied viewing, like the cinema of attractions more generally, would soon be relegated to specific moments in genres like pornography, adventure, horror, and melodrama.55 But even these genres for- sook the elaborate trappings of Hale's Tours in favor of what would become the classical working system of cinema. According to Noël Burch: Hale's Tours are above all emblematic of a tendency which marked the first decade of cinema and which consisted in interventions from out- side the film, interventions in spectatorial space, destined to achieve a goal which history was to show could only be achieved, on the contrary, by blotting out spectatorial space.56 Nothing blotted out spectatorial space more effectively than darkness. By the time Proust published Swan's Way (1913), Paris and other major cities witnessed the rise of the first structures built primarily for cinematic projection and the isolation of spectators. Darkness was literally written into cinema operating manuals, and it is that darkness that still pervades major motion-picture theaters.57 Alongside the rise of permanent sites for the exhibition of cinema (c. 1905-1910) and the construction of theaters exclusively or primarily for the exhi- 53.

In a particu- larly telling incident, Adolph Zukor - operator of a Hale's Tours pavilion at Union Square in New York and future Hollywood impresario - inserted Porter's The Great Train Robbery (1903) into the middle of a phantom ride in a desperate attempt to lure back jaded audiences. A point-blank shot from the revolver of a bandit transformed the spectators into victims and inaugurated a captivating narrative no longer tied to railroad simulations. The gambit was a success. Zukor tore out the Hale's Tours acces- sories and established the first traditional theater in what would become a vertically integrated film empire that eventually included the Bay Theatre in Vancouver.

According to Frank Richardson, author of a popular handbook for managers and operators of motion-picture theaters, "The amount of light to be used in the auditorium is a matter concerning which there has been a great deal of pretty hot debate."58 Although a systematic excursus on the stan- dardization of cinematic darkness in the early decades of the twentieth century is beyond the scope of this essay,59 there can be little doubt that the historical peri- od staked out by Overture coincides with the disciplining of cinematic darkness through legal, architectural, and technological means; that is, an effort (not always successful) to suppress the body of the spectator, dematerialize the space of recep- tion, and prohibit the potentially salacious activities that could transpire therein. Despite the multifarious attempts to undermine it - by film-palace stage shows, drive-in teenagers, multiplex popcorn, and countless other incursions into the classical cinematic experience - this hegemonic form of darkness has solidified its reign over the theatrical reception of cinema; indeed, the cinema's decline as a primary site of film reception has coincided with an increased emphasis on cine- matic darkness in the movie theaters that survive. Every minute the spectator spends in Overture begins and ends in darkness. Landscapes change dramatically. Telegraph poles fly by punctually. Bridges and precipices and trestles come and go. But few seconds pass before a black point emerges in the distance. That point swells into the mouth of a tunnel. And that tunnel devours the spectator and gives her over to a darkness darker than any Hollywood film could bear. It is a darkness that crosses the threshold of the screen and infuses the space of reception. But even more, it is a darkness that negotiates the immediacy of the present and the radical diversity and alterity of the past. Overture is doubly situated at the cusp of hegemonic darkness. The first darkness is that of the standardized, late-twentieth-century black-box gallery in which, over the course of a decade, Overture found a stable home. The naturalness of this now familiar darkness is compromised by a second - but historically primary - one, which spans the inaugural decade of the twentieth century. In Overture , this dark- ness is figured in the vertiginous movement of Edison's phantom rides and the lugubrious prose of Proust, two seemingly irreconcilable sources. What their dark- nesses share is the wonderment produced by virtual travel and corporeal aban- don - that is, the capacity to inhabit other bodies and other spaces. As Douglas's Proustian narrator intones: "I could not even be sure at first who I was. ... I had lost all sense of the place." Just as Proust's narrator confuses the darkness of his bedroom with that of Combray, Tansonville, Balbec, and Paris, so too the specta- tor perceives not only the darkness of her surroundings but also that of fair- 58.

Rather than assert corpore- ality, Overture arouses a century of sensual dis- embodiment. Rather than insist on material extension in space, Overture activates a hun- dred years of structured spacelessness. Rather than parade outmoded technologies, Overture elucidates the enduring power of choreo- graphed darkness. In place of a pseudo-recov- ery of the body, an empty rehabilitation of space, or a fetishistic baring of the device, Overture blends the phenomenological dark- ness of the room with the residual darkness of cinema's inchoate first decades and a premoni- tion of its imminent hegemonic form. Rather than answer Beckett's question, Overture asks it historically and with the same inexorable per- sistence: Why in another dark or in the same ? Postscript Across bridges and trestles, through val- leys and tunnels, Overture compels the viewer inexorably forward. The viewer "cannot help but adhere to the movement of the train as though it were his own body."60 Overture demands neither the suspension nor the inter- rogation of disbelief. Rather, just as Douglas historicizes the darkness that envelops specta- torial bodies, so too does he marshal the cine- matic train toward the dialectical synthesis of dreaming and waking, immersive pleasure and critical distance, myth and démystification. For if the train of shadows emerged from the nine- teenth century as part of a distinct screen prac- tice, it traversed the twentieth century primar- ily as myth. Few topoi from the first decades of cin- ema are more overdetermined than trains.61 60.

Maxim Gorky captured the sentiment best: Suddenly there is a click, everything vanishes and a railway train appears on the screen. It darts like an arrow straight towards you - watch out! It seems as though it is about to rush into the darkness where you are sitting and reduce you to a mangled sack of skin, full of crumpled flesh and splintered bones, and destroy this hall and this building, so full of wine, women, music and vice, and transform it into fragments and into dust. But this, too, is merely a train of shadows.62 As implied in Gorky's account and confirmed in recent scholarship, the image of spectatorial flight is cinema's founding myth and nothing more: no evi- dence supports claims that spectators literally fled from before an oncoming cine- matic train.63 The lack of historical evidence, however, hardly proved an impedi- ment to the making of the myth. In 1901, Robert W. Paul, a pioneer of British film, shot The Countryman's First Sight of the Animated Pictures , which was quickly adapted by Edwin S. Porter, for Edison, as Uncle Josh at the Moving Picture Show (1902). In both films, the images onscreen are matted in, the action is framed rel- atively tightly, and the theatrical environment is difficult to discern. But as the extended descriptive title makes clear, the high-point of the action is impossible to miss: "a farmer viewing the approaching train on screen takes to his heels." This episode - one of three that mock the gullibility of fictive audiences - documents neither the conditions of cinematic reception at the turn of the century nor the primitive credulity of early audiences. Rather, the films promulgated a widespread myth regarding the subject formed by the cinematic apparatus. The myth of the train effect was revived with regularity in the first decades of cinema and survives as a reference point for avant-garde filmmaking to the pre- sent.64 Overture s first curator considered "Douglas' [s] use of train imagery [to be] an ironic salute to the first commercially released film [sic], the Lumière Brothers' Train Arriving at the Station ."65 The reference is real, even if the relationship between the two works is more complex.

The train has fig- ured the collective dream consciousness of a cinematic public and, inversely (through its subversion), the waking consciousness of the revolutionized masses. In the first instance, Buster Keaton serves as paradigmatic;66 in the second instance, it is the work of Soviet director Dziga Vertov. In Sherlock Jr. (1924), Keaton plays a film projectionist who projects himself into the film as its nimble and cunning protago- nist. The conceit's canonical status within the history of film was confirmed one year prior to Overture in Woody Allen's homage The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985). 67 In Sherlock Jr., Keaton the projectionist falls asleep on the job and - through the help of double exposures and other tricks of the trade - dreams himself into the film. Keaton 's first attempts to cross the threshold into the film are rebuffed as he is flung back over the orchestra and into the auditorium. The audience - utterly absorbed in its own collec- tive dream - does not register Keaton's shenanigans. Highly orchestrated mon- tage - theater sets followed by location shots - makes the transition from theater to film virtually imperceptible. With each sub- sequent montage, Keaton's brushes with danger escalate: perched at the edge of a cliff, surrounded by lions, and, most treach- erous of all, nearly run over by an oncoming train. Like Paul's countryman and Porter's Uncle Josh, Keaton takes to his heels. But unlike his mythical predecessors, Keaton dives from before a real train, one that trav- els across the screen rather than toward the 66. As Douglas notes in relation to Beckett's Film (1963), in which Keaton had his last star turn: "as a self-consciously silent movie it couldn't hope for a better Object than Buster Keaton."

Thus, Sherlock Jr. represents classical dream consciousness as it abandons the theater to enter the world of film.68 Despite the complexity of the montage sequence, however, Keaton's Sherlock Jr. retains strong ties to early comedic shorts: most of the gags in the film derive directly from the vaudeville stage and have little by way of trick cinematography. Keaton - that paragon of silent cinema unable (or unwilling) to translate his talents into the sound era - is the perfect proxy for the unfulfilled dreams and dreaming of classical cinema. Film critic Robert Aron went so far as to praise Keaton at the expense of Man Ray and Luis Buñuel, whose films he consid- ered the only ones of merit made in France. In Keaton's films the passage from the real to the unreal occurs without rupture; and in the American films adventure, love, and the supernatural are all tangled up with the material, the social, and the rational - the better to defy them and best them on the grounds which are most familiar to them. The revenge of individuals in the very space of their suffering.69 Finally, Keaton - along with other American slapstick eccentrics such as Charlie Chaplin and Mickey Mouse - established, for Walter Benjamin, the central bridge between cinema and dreaming: "less by depicting the dream world itself than by creating figures of collective dream . . . the eccen- tric . . . was the first to inhabit the new fields of action opened up by film - the first occupant of the newly built house.'"70 Dziga Vertov.

The dream house of cinema is precisely what Dziga Vertov sought to destroy: [T]he movie camera was unfortunate. It was invented at a time when there was no country in which Capital did not reign. The hellish idea of the bourgeoisie was to use the new toy for entertaining popular mass- es, or more precisely for diverting the workers' attention from their basic aim of struggling against their bosses. The starving and semi- starving proletarians, the unemployed, unclenched their iron fists in the electric fog of the movie theaters and succumbed without noticing it to the corrupting influence of the Bosses' cinema.71 If the electric fog of movie theaters attracted the masses in order to divert and placate them, Vertov would bring the cinema of truth, Kinopravda, directly to the masses in order to enlighten and revolutionize them. Early in his career, the primary vehicle for his propagandistic efforts was the agit-train.72 The superficial similarities 71.

A screening. The small place is filled with peasant men and women and workers from a nearby factory. Kinopravda is being shown, without musical accompaniment. The noise of the projector can be heard. On screen a train speeds past. A young girl appears, walking straight toward the camera. Suddenly a scream is heard in the hall. A woman runs toward the girl on the screen. She's weeping, with her arms stretched out before her. She calls the girl by name. But the girl disappears. On the screen the train rushes by once more. The lights are turned on. The woman is carried out, uncon- scious. "What's going on?" a worker-correspondent asks. One of the viewers answers: "It's kino-eye. They filmed the girl while she was still alive. Not long ago she fell ill and died. The woman running toward the screen was her mother."73 This is Vertov's most brazen attempt to construct a myth for cinema that would replace illusion and deception with reality and truth. In Vertov's myth, an onscreen train speeds past - twice! - in order to highlight its impotence: Vertov's enlightened audience will not be fooled by trains of shadows. Instead, the scream in the hall is the cry of true recognition, a woman mourning her lost child fortu- itously caught by Vertov and his kino-eye comrades. Vertov inculcated the story's basic tenets in audiences through purely cine- matographic means. The finale of Man with a Movie Camera (1929) is staged within a movie theater and is an overt attempt to disperse its electric fog - specifically, the Lumière myth. Vertov meticulously inoculates his real audience by way of the depicted audience: before he presents an image of an oncoming train (shot from beneath the tracks and thus much more violent and direct than turn-of-the-century forerunners), Vertov depicts an oncoming train in the film- within-a-film. The lack of fright - let alone flight - on the part of the depicted audience serves as a model for real audiences. The debunked train sequences are interspersed with images of the masses such that the personal, familial truth described in the village of Pavlovskoe is transformed into the public, social truth of the masses, now awakened to their revolutionary role. Famously, Vertov sets Man with a Movie Camera in motion through the parallel editing of a woman opening her eyes, a window opening its blinds, and a camera opening its iris. Man with a Movie Camera is the very image of waking consciousness. At certain moments, Walter Benjamin appears to stake the entirety of his unfinished Arcades Project - an archaeology of nineteenth-century Paris cata- 73.

The twentieth century must awaken from the nightmare of nineteenth-century modernity but retain the Utopian dreams it failed to formulate fully, let alone ful- fill. In his notes for the 1935 exposé of the project, Benjamin schematically identi- fied the flowering of the arcades under Louis Philippe as thesis (dream conscious- ness), their decline at the end of the century as antithesis (waking consciousness), and their (Surrealist) rediscovery as synthesis (awakening).74 The seminal model for this awakening - perched at the threshold of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries but named in neither of Benjamin's Arcades Project exposés - was none other than Proust: Is awakening perhaps the synthesis of dream consciousness (as thesis) and waking consciousness (as antithesis)? Then the moment of awak- ening would be identical with the "now of recognizability," in which things put on their true - surrealist - face. Thus, in Proust, the impor- tance of staking an entire life on life's supremely dialectical point of rupture: awakening. Proust begins with an evocation of the space of someone waking up.75 By way of Proust, Douglas, too, begins with the space of someone waking up. The nightmare from which he has awoken is the classical cinema as a regime of disciplinary spectatorship and subject formation - in other words, the electric fog of movie theaters. The dream that he still dreams is left more ambiguous, even inchoate. Indeed, the dream may be of an inchoate space, a space between - if not completely outside - regimes of discipline. Overture cannot be reduced either to dream consciousness or to waking consciousness; its absent train belongs neither to Keaton nor to Vertov. But inasmuch as it recalls the inchoate darknesses of early cinema and their eventual standardization, Overture affords the viewer the "now of recognizability" promoted by Benjamin and the Surrealists. That recognizability is preserved in the exhibition history of Overture - a history that traverses nascent black-box galleries and aging movie theaters. More immediately and importantly, the "now of recognizability" is materially and sensually manifest in the few feet of black leader inserted by Douglas between turn-of-the-century phantom rides. These strips of black leader - and the darknesses they produce and summon - bind Overture to the still unspent promise of cinematic darkness. If the cinema is our arcades, Overture is a moment of awakening. 74. Walter Benjamin, The Arcades Project, trans.
