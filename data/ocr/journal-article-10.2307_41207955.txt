Reviewed by Gordon Cuyler Julian Huxley has pointed out that man's opinion of himself in relation to the animal world has swung as a pendulum from Dar- win's time, when man believed he was just another animal striving for survival, to to- day, when he sees himself as biologically unique. With this in mind, it is not too surprising to find three books of 1954, all of which have animals as their point of de- parture, concerning themselves primarily with men. Thus, in Of Whales and Men, psychia- trist R. B. Robertson, embarked on a mod- ern whale hunt in a super-efficient factory ship, is more interested in the motives which led him and his shipmates to go whaling than he is in the magnificent prey they hunt with such unerring success; his- torian Mari Sandoz, in The Buffalo Hunt- ers, tells about the destruction of the four great herds in a series of vivid pictures of the pioneers who did the shooting; and, in Coro-Coro, cancer researcher Paul Zahl pauses frequently in his search for the breeding grounds of the scarlet ibis to search within himself. Whoever remembers with a quick rush of sympathy Ernest Thompson Seton's Lives of the Hunted will shudder a little at Of Whales and Men, a good subtitle for which might be "Lives of the Hunters." Each year twelve thousand men, tough, rough and ready, sail from Tönsberg for the Southern Ocean to feed whales to their ugly whale-processing ship - as different from the elegant "Pequod" as day from night. The factory ship is accompanied by thirteen chasers, equipped with the elec- tronic devices of a task force and fast enough to track the blue whales through the antarctic ice. Explosive harpoons, a Norwegian monopoly and shot only by Norwegians, kill whales by the thousands and make modern whaling profitable. The majestic blue whale, biggest and fastest of all the whales, is only a mass of flesh to these expert killers. In the factory ship's "Brobdingnagian Butcher's Shop," flensers cut into the huge carcass, carving out great chunks to be lifted away into the complicated machinery.

As Dr. Robertson describes it, "The whales floated belly upward in the sea astern of us, looking uncomfortably pathetic and ridiculous. ... A few hours before, they had been the lords and ladies of the ocean, the mightiest animals that ever knew life on this planet; and now they were so many tons of dead organic matter, waiting their turn to be converted into margerine and poultry feed." Although Dr. Robertson calls the mod- ern whalers and himself "psychopaths," he does not use the term in its usually accepted sense. He believes the psychopath, "the man with the suffering mind," is a superior being, akin to many of the great artists and scientists - Dostoevski, Columbus, Darwin - who were also too healthy to conform to civilization. These men forsake the well- worn paths of ordinary life and take off on their own. Rather than face the cares and vexations which beset less adventurous men, the whaler finds in the discomforts and de- mands of his strange calling a welcome and refreshing freedom. The hide men of Mari Sandoz' The Buf- falo Hunters are far from being psycho- paths, as Dr. Robertson uses the term. Un- encumbered by wife or family, they were attracted across the Missouri by scouts' tales and the prospect of getting rich, and there they found the Great Plains black with buffalo. At first, there were only sporadic clashes between the Plains Indian and the hunter. To the Indian, the buffalo was a main means of support: he fed on its good meat and kept himself warm with the skins. He killed only according to his needs. But as the white hunters increased, the Indian saw them slaughtering his buffalo with their big guns and profiting from the trade in hides from which he was excluded. As the in- credible slaughter proceeded, buffalo be- came harder to kill and the Indian could not procure the rifles and ammunition he needed. The lawless frontiersmen (green- horns, gamblers and gunmen backed up by the army) broke treaty after treaty, and the 222</page><page sequence="3">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR Now Ready . . .

The white men used any excuse to go marauding, and although the Indian sometimes could retaliate against a portion of the expedition or capture an officer, he was soon humbled and defeated. In making extensive use of incidents in the lives of the hunters to tell the story of the great slaughter, Miss Sandoz brings the reader a somewhat chaotic picture. Emerg- ing here and there are such characters as Wild Bill Hickok, Buffalo Bill Cody and General George Custer. Greedy and vain, and somehow very childish, they are any- thing but heroes. One wonders whether the same story would have been enacted on the Great Plains if the Pilgrims or the Quakers had first opened the country. Paul Zahl enters the llanos country of Venezuela not to kill or trade but to dis- cover the breeding grounds of the spectacu- larly beautiful scarlet ibis, known to the natives as coro-coro. This bird breeds only in the rainy season, when the swollen rivers of central Venezuela are monsters that threaten to turn the llanos country into one vast inland sea of flood waters. Watered by steady precipitation six months of the year, this primitive country seven degrees north of the equator has a constant tem- perature range of 80 to 85 degrees, an ideal climate for growing a profusion of tropical verdure. After following many a false trail, Dr. Zahl succeeds at last in discovering the garcero, or breeding place, of the dramatic birds and sets up an ingenious blind to photograph them in their natural habitat. In this sparsely populated land with its luxuriant vegetation and varied animal life, Dr. Zahl is stirred to reflection. Above all, he is impressed with the infinite provisions of nature to preserve the species and the urge to propagate common to all animals. He sees the continuation of the species as a way for the individual to cheat death in one sense, for, although the individual must die, the species goes on. "What," he asks, "in a broader sense, is the meaning of re- production? Why did nature grant her higher creatures little more time than to reproduce before turning them back into 224</page><page sequence="4">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR BOOKS FROM ^ggk Chicago Щ) EURIPIDES: FOUR TRAGEDIES Here, translated into contemporary poetry which retains the impact of the great originals, are ALCESTIS, translated by Richmond Lattimore; THE MEDEA, translated by Rex Warner; THE HERACLEIDAE, translated by Ralph Gladstone; HIPPOLYTUS, translated by David Grene.

Galileo Galilei challenged man's view of the universe, arousing a bitter storm of controversy climaxed by his imprisonment under the In- quisition. In this brilliantly excit- ing new book, Giorgio de Santillana presents the whole drama of Gali- leo's great "crime," vividly evoking the intrigue-ridden background against which the famous dispute occurred. Coming at a time when science and scientists are once again fighting for the right to unfettered inquiry, The Crime of Galileo con- tains a profoundly disturbing mes- sage for moderns. $5-75 At your bookstore, or from THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS 5750 Ellis Ave., Chicago 37, III. dust? Why is the vital energy of life fo- cussed on the perpetuation not of self but of race?" Questions such as these lift Coro-Coro from the category of a straight natural-his- tory book to the plane of zoological phi- losophy. Dr. Zahl's grasp of his subject is sound and the reader is treated to an excel- lent survey of evolution. Far from senti- mentality or anthropomorphism, Coro- Coro is the able work of a twentieth-century scientist and intellectual. In the three books here considered, the authors' eyes have been focused mainly on man: the escapist in Of Whales and Men, the opportunist in The Buffalo Hunters and the philosopher in Coro-Coro. This emphasis has not precluded, however, the presentation of a great deal of worth-while information on the natural history of whales, buffalo and scarlet ibises. This is not the kind of natural history that the gentle Gilbert White wrote in The Natural History and Antiquities of Selbourne, with his interest in the animal as a wonderful work of God. This is natural history writ- ten from man's point of view, with man's justified emphasis on his own importance as the chief character in the animal kingdom.</page></plain_text>
