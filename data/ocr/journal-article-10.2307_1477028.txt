<plain_text><page sequence="1">Patricia J. Thompson Beyond Gender: Equity Issues for Home Economics Education A major premise of feminism is that women have been defined as "the other" (de Beauvoir, 1952/ 1974). A corollary to this idea is that, in a society defined by men, women have been both invisible and voiceless. To the home economics profes- sional-whether in education, business, govern- ment, or the home-such ideas have special poignancy. Home economics can be described as the "other" women's movement. To many, it is not even there. Home economics is an invisible part of the curriculum. Its practitioners are routinely denied the opportunity to speak "in their own voice." These existential problems are a challenge for home eco- nomics, a female-defined discipline never intended to be "for women only." The field of home economics has been generally neglected within the literature focused on women, feminism, and education. During the ascendancy of the women's movement, some feminists saw home economics as "the enemy" (Cooper, 1972, p. 13). Home economics became a convenient scapegoat for the ills that had befallen women in their tradi- tional roles. In 1984, the same year that Gloria Steinem, a founder of Ms. magazine, celebrated her 50th birth- day, home economics celebrated its 75th anniver- sary as a discipline with a professional organization. The American Home Economics Association was founded in 1909 as a result of 10 Lake Placid Patricia J.

Lehman College, The City University of New York. Conferences. Most feminists are not drawn to a detailed study of home economics and its history. However, it is as true for women as it is for others that those who are ignorant of their history will be condemned to repeat it. Dorothy Storck (1985), a columnist for the Phil- adelphia Inquirer, mused on this odd state of affairs: I never took Home Ec in high school, but some- times I'd pass the class and glance in at the sewing machines and nutrition charts and up- turned girlish faces, and I'd dash to the hockey field, where, to my mind, freedom from housework lay. It never occurred to me that while I was fleeing the inequality of work in the home, I wasn't running toward much in the way of equal rights anywhere else. Nobody offered me a place on the boys' hockey team. Home Ec in those days was Home Ick. It was what you schemed to get out of at home. It was for girls who thumbed through Bride mag- azine instead of pre-law books. I confess I still clung to that notion this week when I went to the Civic Center to interview Geraldine Ferraro, keynote speaker at the 76th national convention of the American Home Eco- nomics Association. I was not prepared for the magnitude of the convention, for the range of the subjects and workshops, for the power of some of the speakers. I was not prepared, once again, for the shifts that have taken place in a part of society that has been unexamined-by me-while I have been</page><page sequence="2">battling elsewhere. It may be feminists' destiny always to look back in wonder. We do seem to concentrate on the surges of discovery rather than the ensuing waves. (p. B-1) Storck's commentary reveals the subtle ways in which gender stereotypes sometimes backfire. Storck raises important points that reach back over the past decades of the women's movement, wom- en's education, and the changing field of home economics. The Dilemma of Domesticity Twenty years after the modern women's move- ment, a new generation of women continues to invest self-esteem and energy in the maintenance of households and families. Even the daughters of feminists express the wish to marry and to mother (Bolotin, 1982). What was once "the feminine mys- tique" has become today the "dilemma of domes- ticity." Women still embark on long-term commitments to bear and rear children. So com- pelling is this need that women in surprising num- bers choose to become single parents rather than forego the domestic option. Is such commitment purely a product of sex role socialization, the result of collective stupidity, passivity, and oppression? Or is it, at least in part, something more? Feminist scholars offer fresh insights into the dynamics of female social and intellectual devel- opment. Miller, in Toward a New Psychology of Women (1975), observes that society does not rec- ognize most so-called women's work as "real ac- tivity" because it is usually associated with others' development rather than self-enhancement or self- employment (p. 53). She notes that a woman cannot use her own life activity to build an image of herself based on an authentic reflection of what she ac- tually is and does. Miller says: In the course of projecting into women's domain some of its most troublesome and problematic exigencies, male-led society may also have si- multaneously, and unwittingly, delegated to women not humanity's "lowest needs" but its "highest necessities"-that is, the intense emo- tionally connected cooperation and creativity nec- essary for human life and growth. (pp. 25-26) According to Gilligan (1977, 1979, 1982), girls and boys, women and men, pursue moral ends along different emotional and ethical vectors. Her work reveals the development of an "ethics of care" that motivates many women to remain connected, even when to do so leads to their physical or material disadvantage. Elshtain (1982) delineates the public/private di- chotomy and recognizes its challenge to feminists, saying that "the end point of the feminist argu- mentation . . . requires that women, in the name of feminism, embrace the terms of public life that was created by men who had rejected or devalued the world of the traditionally 'feminine' with its 'softer' virtues" (p. 447). She says: I would never tell any woman who claims such work (i.e., homemaking) made her life fuller that she was wrong-headed. But I would also never tell a harassed, exploited woman worker that labor outside the home was her freedom, whether she wanted it or not. (1983, p. 253) It is not fashionable today to ask the extent to which gender, intellect, interest, and knowledge are related and how they influence our perception of the "ideal" education for women as they do the "ideal" education for men. The assumption that gender generates intellectual dualism becomes un- tenable when we consider that males and females cross gender lines in aptitudes, interests, and oc- cupations (Klein, 1985). Needed: A New Paradigm for Women Male-defined elitism assumes that male-de- signed educational priorities, curricula, values, and social rewards are also best for women. According to Rich (1979): The early feminists, the women intellectuals of the past, along with educated men, assumed that the intellectual structure as well as the contents of the education available to men was viable: that is, enduring, universal, a discipline civilizing to the mind and sensitizing to the spirit. Its claims for both humanism and objectivity went unques- tioned. (p. 131) The model proposed here is in its conceptual infancy, yet holds promise to break the grip of a "masculist" paradigm on female thought. The French Annales school attempted (among other things) to demasculinize history. Annales historians employ a metaphorical model with classical roots that has singular applicability for home economics (Thomp- son, 1985, 1986a, 1986b). It may also have rele- vance for feminists and women scholars in other disciplines. In the Annales canon, the space of human action has a dual aspect that corresponds to the Volume XXV, Number 4 277</page><page sequence="3">public and private spheres so familiar in contem- porary feminist thought. The public space/sphere/ world is visible and masculine. It is called "Her- mean," after the messenger god Hermes, the Greek god of communication. By contrast, the private space/sphere/world is invisible and feminine. It is called "Hestian," after Hestia, the Greek goddess of hearth and home. Unlike other gods and goddesses who received anthropomorphic characteristics, the symbol of Hestia was the hearth's living flame. So powerful was this symbol that burning coals from a public hearth were ritually taken from an old city state (polis) to the public hearth of a new one. Hestia's flame symbolized family connection, continuity, and the interdependence of the public and private spheres. This invisible Hestian space is also the realm of everyday necessity that the ancient Greek male establishment devalued in favor of the life of the mind. This elitist dualism (as much as sexist gender dichotomies) has placed a mental straitjacket on subsequent Western thought and action. The Greeks assumed that slaves and women should perform the private sphere functions (i.e., "housework") de- manded for day-by-day survival. This arrangement gave males-i.e., the free male citizens of the polis- the leisure to engage in the "intellectual work" demanded in the public world of the agora and the secluded groves of academe. Behind this public facade lay the invisible, fem- inine Hestian space that is the life world of women as it exists historically and cross-culturally. Speak- ing phenomenologically, the Hermean world is con- crete and manifest. By contrast, the Hestian world is immanent and latent, a world continually in the process of becoming. The Hermean and Hestian domains are not mirror images of one another. They exist in relation. They are distinctive, yet complementary and inter- dependent. They are more amenable to systems thinking than to linear thinking. Males predominate in the valued Hermean sphere. Females predomi- nate in the devalued Hestian sphere. Consequently, it has become privatized, feminized, and otherized. However, the two systems form each other's boundaries. They exist simultaneously, each de- pendent on the other. In systems terms, they in- terface. Transactions (inputs and outputs) take place across their boundaries. The two spheres exist in dialectic relation-interdependent, interconnected, and interactive. To understand home economics requires a shift from a male defined Hermean mind- 278 Theory Into Practice set to a female defined Hestian mind-set. This per- ceptual shift brings a holistic reality into focus and takes us beyond gender to more complex levels of social and intellectual organization. Shifting the ground from gender-fixated dis- course to one of the Hermean and Hestian domains permits syntheses of woman-centered knowledge from many disciplines and allows women to recon- nect and to assert their primacy with respect to perennial human problems from a Hestian per- spective. Rich (1979) spoke in a Hestian voice when she wrote: If we conceive of feminism as more than a friv- olous label, if we conceive of it as an ethics, a methodology, a more complex way of thinking about, thus more responsibly acting upon, the conditions of human life, we need a self-knowl- edge which can only develop through a steady, passionate attention to all female experience. I cannot imagine a feminist evolution leading to radical change in the private/political realm of gender that is not rooted in the conviction that all women's lives are important; that the lives of men cannot be understood by burying the lives of women; and that to make visible the full mean- ing of women's experience, to reinterpret knowl- edge in terms of that experience, is now the most important task of thinking. (p. 213) This would necessitate rethinking attitudes toward home economics. The Birth of Domestic Science The idea of home economics (knowledge for the Hestian sphere) can be traced to antiquity in the Bible (Exod. 18:17-18), Book I of Aristotle's Politics, Xenophon's Oekonomicus, and Francis Ba- con's "Salomon's House" in The New Atlantis (Costantakos, 1984). These works share the con- necting thread of a Hestian focus on the practical matters of everyday life-what Miller (1975) calls humanity's highest necessities. Home economics education is the knowledge system organized to deal with such matters intelligently and effectively. In the United States, the first glimmer of the domestic science idea appeared in the work of Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford), a Tory phy- sicist, chemist, and humanitarian who once ap- pealed to King George III to establish a public institution for the application of science to the com- mon purposes of life. Rumford turned a measure of his formidable talents to practical innovations for the household and to the scientific study of nutrition</page><page sequence="4">(Brown, 1979). Other scientists followed, but when such applied study was proposed to Harvard, the idea was rejected as unsuited to a liberal arts college. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology was then established to meet the need for a school of applied science. Emma Willard proposed the retention of "housewifery" (i.e., Hestian knowledge) in women's higher education to provide the intellectual and es- thetic training necessary to regulate the practical, everyday concerns of households (Ferrar, 1964, p. 4). In 1841, Catherine Beecher laid out the first comprehensive, systematically organized knowl- edge for the Hestian sphere in A Treatise on Do- mestic Economy (Beecher, 1841/1848). It included state-of-the-art information to be utilized in house- holds. Beecher's plea was, in effect, that the com- parable worth of the Hestian and Hermean spheres must be recognized. Historically, public education has been dominated by the Hermean paradigm. The Hestian paradigm persists in home economics education. The 19th century domestic science movement grew, helped in large part by the establishment of the land grant colleges and universities in 1862. The Seneca Falls conference in 1869 called women to challenge male dominance in the Hermean sphere by spearheading the movement for women's suf- frage. There were, in effect, two 19th century wom- en's movements-one Hermean (the suffrage movement) and one Hestian (the home economics movement). The Hermean branch emphasized the ballot; the Hestian branch emphasized education, especially education grounded in the knowledge needs of women. Hilton (1972) points out that a comprehensive social and intellectual history of American women would have to take both move- ments into account. A Knowledge System-Not a Gender System Over a 10-year period (1899-1908), a number of women and some men, under the leadership of Ellen H. Swallow-Richards, a Vassar-educated chemist who was the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's first female instructor, met to define the focus of the domestic science movement for the 20th century. They identified it as the family and the home, both Hestian institutions. After much discussion, in which they rejected the name ecology, they agreed on home economics. They were, in fact, wrestling with issues of Hestian education in an era when immigration, industrialization, and ur- banization in the Hermean sphere were generating unprecedented pressures in the Hestian sphere. As defined in the Lake Placid Conference Pro- ceedings (1902), home economics (in its most com- prehensive sense) was to be "the study of the laws, conditions, principles, and ideals which are concerned on the one hand with man's immediate physical environment and on the other hand with his nature as a social being." It was to be the special study of the relation between the two fac- tors. Moreover, the founders characterized home economics as a "philosophical subject, i.e., a study of relation," while the academic subjects on which it depends were "empirical in their nature and con- cerned with events and phenomena." It is evident that the discipline was to be one of relation and connection. Home economics sought to "bind to- gether into a consistent whole the pieces of knowl- edge at present unrelated" (emphasis in original, pp. 70-71). Dean Sarah Louise Arnold of Simmons College made the following point in 1903 at the Fifth Lake Placid Conference: We have come upon an altogether new classifi- cation of knowledge, and, as we attempt to build a curriculum we discover that the extension of knowledge everywhere affects us too. We are part and parcel of all the rest. . . . Since we cannot compass all knowledge and include all subjects in our curriculum, is it not the part of wisdom for us to limit our subjects to certain essentials, certain fundamentals, and gather closely about these the related knowledge which science and art have made available for us? (Pro- ceedings, 1903, p. 10) From the start this discipline, in which women were the prime movers and most consistent sup- porters, focused on issues of knowledge rather than gender. While the early curricula in the schools focused on such then-essential household tasks as cooking and sewing, the tasks were sustained by knowledge of science, human relations, esthetics, and ethics. As a school subject, home economics aimed to provide the learning needed for "right living." By this was meant an ethically responsible life in the Hestian sphere to complement a similar quality of life in the Hermean sphere. As the home economics curriculum developed, and as it has evolved for over a century, it shows programmatic regularities, a consistent pattern. Its subject matter is grouped around such core Hestian concerns as family relations, child development, Volume XXV, Number 4 279</page><page sequence="5">shelter and home furnishings, food and nutrition, clothing and textiles, and the changing technologies and social institutions associated with their pro- duction, acquisition, maintenance, and consumption in households. In the secondary schools, this knowl- edge cluster and its subjects are most often found under the broad rubric "consumer/homemaking." In colleges and universities, departments of home economics, for political reasons (Hermean pres- sures), may go by other names, including "human ecology," "human development," and "family and consumer studies/sciences/resources." The First Women's Discipline Not surprisingly, a discipline defined by women will look different from one defined by men. Ac- cording to Chafe (1972), in the 19th century: The curriculum of women's education underwent a striking change . . . reflecting a growing con- cern with preparing women for marriage and the home. The founders of most women's colleges had sought as much as possible to make them carbon copies of Harvard and Yale . . . and (Vassar), Mount Holyoke, Smith, Barnard, and Bryn Mawr all insisted that they offer the same courses as the best men's colleges. By the early twentieth century, however, the older view of female colleges came under increasing attack. Ethel Puffer Howe, a Radcliffe graduate and later head of the Smith Institute, urged women's col- leges in 1913 to develop courses in domestic science, eugenics, hygiene, and the aesthetics of the home in order to train women for the domestic tasks which lay ahead. In a similar vein, an in- surgent group at the 1923 convention of the American Collegiate Association condemned women's colleges for not preparing women for the occupation of homemaking and child-rearing. (p. 101, citations omitted) Vassar introduced a short-lived interdisciplinary School of Euthenics which focused on the devel- opment and care of the family and offered a series of courses: "husband and wife," "motherhood," and "the family as an economic unit" (Chafe, 1972, p. 103). Marion Talbot of the University of Chicago proposed a graduate program in "sanitary science" that evolved out of "domestic science" and that would later become home economics (Fish, 1985). In the first quarter of the 20th century, interest in family care and home economics expanded (Chafe, 1972, p. 104). In part as a result of federal financing under the Smith-Lever Act, and in part as a result 280 Theory Into Practice of demand for teachers of cooking and hygiene in the public schools, this education area grew. Chafe describes the growing tension between Hermean and Hestian values in women's higher education: At a time when the sexual division of labor posed the primary obstacle to the advancement of eco- nomic equality, it appeared that the nation's col- leges and universities were reinforcing the image of woman as wife and mother. (p. 104) Home economics became a women's discipline, profession, and school subject by default. Although males and females share the same basic human needs, few men were attracted to work in the Hestian domain. So long as Hermean concerns are valued above Hestian, we can expect continued disequilibrium between the two spheres. Over the past decades, minor gender shifts in home economics enrollment at the secondary and post-secondary levels have been noted. However, data collection with respect to female and male enrollment has not been consistent over time and at each educational level. Nevertheless, a slight rise in male enrollments might be interpreted as a pos- itive trend. In 1985 Peggy S. Meszaros, associate dean in the College of Home Economics at Okla- homa State University, attributed an upturn in total degrees granted to men at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral level from 2.0 percent in 1968-1969 to 4.6 percent in 1978-79 to four factors: * program specialization trends * more male role models among college home economics faculty * increasing job opportunities * a changing social ethic that allows both males and females more flexibility in career choices. ("Issues and Answers," 1985, p. 7) In 1983 the figure had risen to 5.8 percent ("Col- leges Take Home Economics," 1985). Vocational Education MSnamed As the family shifted from a production to a consumption unit, needs that had traditionally been met in the privacy of the Hestian sphere could now be met through the service sector of the Hermean sphere. Initially, home economics was conceptual- ized as preparing women for work in the Hestian domain, i.e., for the vocation of homemaking. Housewifery, housework, and homemaking are all terms that have been used for this labor. As the field of economics became increasingly Hermean in</page><page sequence="6">character, it dropped out of its definition of work unpaid labor in the home-the Hestian domain. Vocational education and home economics- both vocational and general-are devalued when a back-to-basics movement focuses on Hermean con- cerns at the expense of Hestian ones. We may ask, "Whose basics?" There is a Hermean as- sumption, going back to the early dualism in Greek thought, that the basis of the "good life" is purely intellectual. But people every day define the good life as one in which their ongoing basic needs are reasonably well met. Even when the slave, house- wife, servant, and "labor saving devices" are re- placed by service workers, much invisible work remains to be done in households. The goal of a comfortable life with esthetic and ethical meaning is not reached by mastering the traditional disciplines alone. Personal life does not manage itself any more than does public life. Human beings must do the commonplace work of fixing fuses, detecting water leaks, changing linen or tires, and keeping up with things in general. Wires do not reconnect, linen or tires do not change them- selves, chicken soup does not make itself, clothing and dishes do not rearrange themselves after being automatically washed, and children do not become civilized adults without parenting. Admittedly, rep- etitious tasks can become onerous. But they are ineluctable and important parts of being human. In sum, the Hestian world, where invisible connections are made day by day, makes up a person's whole life. Home economics education can make the dif- ference in the quality of that life. Sex Bias and Stereotyping Mears and Haynes-Clements (1983) studied sex stereotyping and sex bias in educators' attitudes toward vocational home economics programs and found that principals', guidance counselors', and home economics teachers' perceptions of the sex- role characteristics of home economics students compared with their perceptions of non-home-eco- nomics students do not indicate sex bias. Their findings also suggest that both male and female home economics students are perceived as more expressive than non-home-economics students. This indicates that they are perceived as more helpful, kind, aware of others' feelings, understanding, and warm in their relationship to others. Traditionally, society has viewed such behavior as appropriate for females but not for males (p. 28). Sex role research has supported the concept of androgyny and the importance of individuals (ir- respective of sex) possessing both masculine and feminine characteristics. Mears and Haynes-Clem- ents's findings do not support the stereotypical view that students in home economics programs receive feminized socialization. To the contrary, "the males in home economics were seen as equally instru- mental by principals and guidance counselors and more instrumental by home economics teachers than were males who did not take home economics" (p. 28). Thus by conventional standards of masculinity, males did not appear less masculine when they enrolled in home economics. From tacit knowledge, observing males in child care, foods, or clothing labs reveals that they undertake nontraditional as- signments in typical male fashion, competing good- naturedly and exhibiting satisfaction and pride in doing Hestian tasks. Males can praise one another for successful non-sexist achievements. Mears and Haynes-Clements also found that females enrolled in home economics courses were perceived as more instrumental than those who did not take home economics. They, too, exhibited traits that were not viewed as feminine. While ster- eotypical perceptions of home economics would dictate that students in home economics courses would be high on expressive and low on instru- mental characteristics, this does not appear to be the case. Despite this, the investigators found that females are more frequently encouraged to take home economics than males, and this does reflect bias in the guidance and counseling process (p. 29). Clearly, home economics classrooms and lab- oratory settings offer a unique context in which to modify sex bias and sex stereotyping that needs further objective study. To the extent that shared work in the Hestian sphere is deemed as important as shared work in the Hermean sphere, home eco- nomics must be recognized for its potential to con- tribute to reduced gender role stereotyping of necessary everyday tasks. It also challenges the assumption that formal learning is essential for suc- cess in the Hermean sphere but not for success in the Hestian sphere. Equity and Gender In the past, home economics was not included in the conceptual frameworks related to sex equity in society and education. It was seen as a special case. It is helpful to remember that equity in Greek, Roman, and English law was the law of special cases devised in a civilized spirit to assure fairness Volume XXV, Number 4 281</page><page sequence="7">in treatment and to make up for "blind spots" or newly emerging circumstances not anticipated in either the written or the customary law. In this sense, equity in education demands a fair share for Hestian in relation to Hermean instruction. Address- ing sex equity issues primarily in terms of the gender of the participants may be a conceptual trap into which feminists, women scholars, home econo- mists, and male educational leaders collectively fall. Before the range of sex equity issues can be con- sidered settled, we must ask about the equity in- volved when a women's field of endeavor such as home economics is made invisible-even as women have been made invisible (Hoye &amp; Merrell, 1983). A plea for nondiscrimination on the basis of gender alone is insufficient to make the equity case for home economics. The equity issue must be framed in the Hermean and the Hestian contexts of knowledge. Certain essential learnings are nec- essary for leading a satisfying human life, and they mandate Hestian educational imperatives for both sexes even as Hermean imperatives are mandated for both sexes. Title IX makes this option feasible through scheduling both sexes for coeducational work in home economics and industrial arts. In a review of the implications of feminist research for home economics education, Bovy (1984) urges home economics educators to accept a mandate for re- commitment to sex equity (pp. 315-316). Wells calls for dialogue on women's equity and home econom- ics (1984, p. 2). Tittle (1985, p. 17) recognizes epistemological equality as a legitimate concern for educational research. Thus we are challenged to think of minds as well as bodies, ideas as well as statistics, to determine whether today's students are being ex- posed to a gender balanced curriculum. Home eco- nomics represents a "textbook case" for epistemological equality-for balance between Her- mean and Hestian knowledge. Solutions for women's disadvantaged position have been sought through expanding educational opportunities and opening the doors to traditional male professions for so long closed to them. Open- ing the doors of previously male institutions extends a Hermean measure of valuation invented by men for men to women. Data concerning gender equity today often measure women's achievements by the inroads they make into fields formerly dominated by men. What have we to say about the equity of an educational system that perpetuates male-defined values and masquerades them as benefits to women? How do 282 Theory Into Practice we count as equitable a system that encourages women to explore traditional male occupations but continues to ridicule men who choose traditionally female occupations? Conclusions Myths and stereotypes are hard to dispel. It is also difficult for a Hestian discipline to confront the Hermean establishment and negotiate for equitable treatment. Patriarchy is alive and well in the academy. Home economics does not promote homemak- ing as the only life option open for women. But home economists do make clear the potential dan- ger of ignoring and distorting the homemaking im- peratives of the Hestian domain. For those who advocate a single standard-a Hermean standard for both women and men-the Hestian world will continue to be devalued. Such devaluation is al- ready exacting a heavy price and can be postulated as a contributing factor in a variety of societal ills; e.g., family breakups, mental and physical health problems, spouse and child abuse, neglect of the aging, homelessness, and a quality of life that is increasingly materialistic and pointless. Is that what we want for the future? As science has brought invisible facets of the physical world to light, the social sciences and human sciences have helped to reveal invisible fac- ets of woman's private world and man's public world. In one way or another, we are constantly returning to the touchstones of our human and material existence: family relations, child develop- ment, food and nutrition, shelter and home fur- nishings, and clothing and textiles. The new scholarship on women in traditionally male-defined disciplines makes new empirical evidence concern- ing these perennial problem areas in human life available every day. If new knowledge for the Hes- tian sphere is available, is it moral or ethical to exclude it from public education? References Beecher, C.E. (1848). A treatise on domestic economy. (Rev. ed.)
