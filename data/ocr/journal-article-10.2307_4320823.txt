<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILIP KITCHER PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES' (Accepted 31 July 1997) I Biologists take an item of behavior to be altruistic just in case it raises the expected reproductive success of an organism other than the agent, while diminishing the expected reproductive success of the agent. In their usage, altruists are organisms who are disposed to perform altruistic behavior. Studies of kin selection and reciprocity have revealed that altruism of this sort might be favored by natural selection. But the mere fact that we, like other animals, might have dispositions to act in ways that promote the reproduction of those around us sheds little, if any, light on the connection between our moral precepts and practices and our evolutionary history, in part because the altruism that matters to us is not typically measured the Darwinian currency of reproduction, and in part because it has everything to do with the intentions of the agent. That there is a connection between human morality and our evolu- tionary past, I have no doubt. That the connection can be stated simply is surely belied by the history of brave, but disastrous, ventures in evolutionary ethics. If the connection is to be illumi- nated then we must start by distinguishing a number of projects. The most ambitious would be to attempt to derive fundamental new moral principles or to revise old ones by considering the regimes of natural selection that shaped human social behavior. In my judg- ment, those endeavors come to grief on the difficulty of wringing moral conclusions out of biological premises. More promising is the thought that we can learn important things about the nature of morality by conceiving ourselves as part of the natural order, that parts of meta-ethics - particularly moral metaphysics and moral epis- temology - should be reconfigured through the explicit recognition Philosophical Studies 89: 283-316,1998.

Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">284 PHILIP KITCHER of the fact that our practices and precepts have long histories and that those histories eventually terminate on the savannah in the psycho- logical dispositions of our remote ancestors and in the kinds of social arrangements that they fashioned. The central theme of this essay is that attention to our evolutionary past might offer us clues about human psychological tendencies, revealing us to be psychological altruists of a particular kind and providing us with a picture of moral agency and of the historical development of morality that leads us to rethink some main questions of moral philosophy. I shall begin by trying to explain the distinction that has already figured in my discussion, the contrast between altruism in the biologist's sense and "psychological" altruism, the altruism that matters to morality. II To a first approximation, we think of people as altruistic when they adjust their preferences to their perceptions of the wants and needs of others. Here is a stylized situation: there is some divisible good that is valued by both A and B; when A is alone and comes across this good, then A prefers taking it all to any other available option; however, if A recognizes that B is present (and, I assume, that B also values the good), then A no longer prefers consuming the good entire but, instead, wants most to share the good with B. Moreover, this preference is generated by A's perception of B's valuation of the good, and it is not explained by A's having some other independent end that would be advanced by sharing with B - A does not calculate that, in the long run, more good things will accrue from sharing with B.2 This stylized situation brings out what I take to be important features of our everyday notion of altruism, the one we link to morality and which we try to induce our children to follow. First, A's valuations differ between the solo situation and that in which B is present: it is not particularly unselfish for people to share things to which they attach no value. Second, A's preference when B is present is mediated by the perception of B's wants: altruism presupposes an empathetic ability to discern what others need or desire and to respond to it. Third, B's satisfaction is perceived as an end in itself,</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES 285 not as a means to the achievement of some of A's other goals, as if A were entering into a contract with B, or trying to impress B, or simply frightened of the consequences of not sharing with B. Although the usual framework of decision theory may not be an adequate representation of the psychological states of agents, it does provide a way of making some of these points more precise, and eliciting some of the nuances of the notion of psychological altruism. Let's say that a valuational structure (or valuation) for an agent is a set of alternative actions that the agent takes to be available and a mapping from that set to the real numbers, so that the number assigned to an option represents the value the agent attaches to the expected outcome of performing that action; or, more generally, when the circumstances involve interactions, the valuation identi- fies sets of alternatives for all the agents involved in the interaction, and maps each combination of actions to expected values for all the agents.3 We can now introduce a notion of psychological altruism as follows: The valuational structure that A forms in situation C is weakly altruistic with respect to B just in case: (1) in C, A ranks Oi ahead of Oj (2) in C*, which is like C except only in the fact that the actions available to A have no impact on the well- being of B, A would rank the analogue of Oj, 0 ahead of the analogue of Oi, 0* (3) A's ranking of Oi ahead of Oj is explained by A's perception of B's preferences (4) A's ranking of Oi ahead of Oj is independent of A's expectations about B's future actions (and, in partic- ular, about actions that would benefit A). I take this to be a definition of weak altruism because it may be satisfied with only a minor reversal of preferences.4 The most inter- esting notions are those in which the recognition of an impact on B produces a systematic change in A's assessment of all the options. To generate a stronger conception, suppose that the values assigned to all of the options available in cases where B is present are functionally related to the values assigned when B is absent and</page><page sequence="4">286 PHILIP KITCHER to A's perception of B's valuations, in such a way that increases in the latter variable would yield increases in the value of the function: i.e. if VAB is A's assignment when B is present, VA is A's assignment when B is absent, and V* A's perception of B's evaluation, then VAB -f(VA, V*B) where cflV*B &gt; 0. (The latter condition is intended to differentiate altruists who take others' values into account in a posi- tive way, from the spiteful for whom others' wants cause a lowering of the associated value.) In general, the function f can take many forms, and can be responsive to other facets of the social situation, as when individuals attach a high value to an outcome if it is brought about in a particular way (think of cases in which the value of a joint course of action, for both parties, consists in the fact that it has been brought about through an attempt to respond to the needs of the other).5 For the sake of simplicity in the present discussion, I am going to suppose thatf takes a particular form, and that VAB = OVA + ( -OVB) where 0 &lt; O &lt; 1. This view of the altruistic adjustment of preferences fits very naturally those situations in which there is the possibility of sharing a divisible good, although it is by no means restricted to them. When the relationship between the preferences in the presence and in the absence of the other takes this simple form, it is possi- ble to identify dimensions along which an agent's altruism can be measured. First, we can gauge the intensity of A's altruism by the parameter 0. Those who are completely selfish give full weight to their own preferences in the absence of others, setting 0 = 1. At the opposite extreme are hyperaltruists whose preferences are completely determined by their perception of the other's evaluation, and for whom 0 = 0. Between these values, agents count as more altruistic the lower their value of 0, an important special case being 0 = 0.5, the point at which A treats B's evaluations as equal in importance with his own (we might think of this as "golden rule altruism").6 A second dimension of altruism concerns the pervasiveness of the altruistic response, measured by the range of contexts C in which the interests of the other affect the valuation. Combining these two independent measures, we can recognize different types of altruists - for example, those who make a more generous response (charac- terized by lower values of 0) across a narrower set of contexts C, can</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES 287 be distinguished from people who are prepared to set 0 &lt; 1 across a broader range of contexts C but whose values of 0 are always somewhat higher. A third independent dimension of altruism, the extent of altru- ism, corresponds to the range of the individuals B whose perceived preferences A is willing to take into account. In a more extensive treatment than I shall attempt here it would be necessary to consider the ways in which A responds to the perceived needs of others in situations where several people might be affected by A's actions, differentiating those in which it is possible to form preferences that take all parties into account from those in which the responsive preference must give priority to some individuals over others, even though, had the privileged individuals not been present, A would have responded to the perceived evaluations of those who are cur- rently slighted. (Consider, for example, a case in which both B and D want an indivisible good, in which A can help either to attain it, and in which A would want to help either B or D if the other were absent. It seems that there should be a requirement of altruistic coherence: if VB &gt; VD, and if, in every context C, A is prepared to set the value of 0 for B lower than the corresponding value for D, then when B and D are in conflict over the indivisible good, A's preference ought to respond to B rather than to D.)7 For present purposes, I ignore multi-agent interactions and suggest that a third measure of altruism is the size of the set of individuals to whose perceived preferences an individual will respond. In addition to intensity, pervasiveness, and extent, we should also consider the character of an altruist's empathetic skill. It is an all-too- familiar fact that some people who try to respond to the preferences of those around them are very bad at recognizing what values others would place on various outcomes (VB is very different from VB). Yet we should also appreciate the possibility that an empathetically skilled altruist may adjust the preference of the intended benefi- ciary, precisely because the altruist wishes either to factor out the beneficiary's reciprocal wish for the altruist's own good or because the altruist thinks that the evaluation assigned by the beneficiary would be revised in the light of further information (clearer thinking etc.).8 So empathetic skill is compatible with various types of pater- nalism, including those that override the beneficiary's own altruistic</page><page sequence="6">288 PHILIP KITCHER responses and those that identify a failure of the beneficiary's prefer- ences to reflect what she "really" wants.9 With respect to this fourth dimension of altruism, I shall again simplify, supposing that A correctly identifies B's preferences, and that considerations of pater- nalism are not pertinent. A general theory of psychological altruism ought to investigate the various ways in which A's preferences respond (the forms of the function J, the character of the various dimensions and the require- ments (if any) on altruistic coherence. But we don't need a general theory to cope with the most elementary forms of altruism that are relevant to morality, and, for the sake of exploring evolutionary origins, we can start with cases in which one organism adjusts its preferences by weighing its own independent valuations with the valuations of others. It might seem that this simple conception is rather thin, compared to the full range of human possibilities, but, as we shall see, it will bring complexities enough. III I shall not defend at any length the idea that some nonhuman social organisms are cognitively sophisticated, that they can recognize the desires of organisms around them, and that, to the extent that our preferences can be represented in terms of valuations, theirs can too. 10 What is far more controversial is whether any organisms, including ourselves, have dispositions to construct valuations that are psychologically altruistic in my sense. There are two sources of doubt, one based on the traditional concern that natural selection cannot be expected to favor the emergence of such dispositions nor to maintain them if they become prevalent, the other stemming from the judgment, fashionable among primatologists, that the social organization of primate life reveals "Machiavellian intelligence", and even that increased powers of cognition in hominids reflect the need to manipulate others and to avoid being manipulated.11 The first version is relatively easy to rebut. Consider a very simple model of maternal care. Primates roaming on the savannah encounter carcases that could serve as food. Imagine that a female, encounter- ing a carcase in the absence of one of her offspring, would prefer to devour it entire, but that, if one of her young is present (or, more generally, can be summoned to the carcase before it spoils or is</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES 289 taken by another animal) prefers to eat half and to give half to the young. If we suppose that food has decreasing marginal value, then the valuations might be as follows: Mother's Valuation: Child Absent Devour All 10 Eat Half 7 Mother' s Attribution to Child Mother Devours All 0 Mother Shares Half 7 Suppose that the mother adjusts her valuation in the presence of the child using the parameter 0 of Section II. Then we have: Mother's Valuation: Child Present Devour All 100 Share Half 7 Mothers for whom 0 &lt; 0.7 will choose to share, and this action may be favored by kin selection. Hence, dispositions to give positive weight to the interests of relatives can be favored by natural selection. In similar fashion, one can show that natural selection can favor dispositions to reciprocate with non-relatives.12 Turn now to the second objection, which suggests that there will always be an alternative way to understand the proximal causes of behavior that benefits others, one that corresponds to the Hobbes- Machiavelli picture. How can we conceive the mother as calculating some future benefit to herself? One possibility, typically not made explicit but often, I think, underlying celebrations of the inevitability of selfishness, is that the very considerations that favor the evolu- tionary success of "altruism" undermine its genuineness. No doubt increased genetic representation in future generations is relevant to the evolution of psychological dispositions, but the important issue is whether organisms govern their behavior by recognizing such future "benefits". As a number of writers have pointed out, it is quite absurd to suppose that more than a few very select primates could calculate the genetic gains and losses (and those who do make their decisions in this way seem misguided, to say the least)."3 Natural</page><page sequence="8">290 PHILIP K1TCHER selection does not need us to be clever, and it's enough that we have dispositions that generate fitness-enhancing actions even though we are quite oblivious as to why those dispositions enhance fitness. Yet, even if we don't calculate in terms of future genetic "bene- fits", maybe we calculate nonetheless. A slightly more plausible suggestion is that maternal care proceeds from the expectation of future reciprocity - the child is expected to grow into a future ally, maybe eventually a caregiver. Here the consequences of the present action would be represented in terms we can imagine being within the mother's conceptual repertoire, but we are still supposing that animals have abilities to abstract from present conditions and to envisage a very different future, to overlook the weak juvenile and see a future strong ally. Even if we allow such amazing foresight, problems remain. If dispositions to share with young evolve under natural selection because of inclusive fitness considerations, then the expectations of future aid ought not to be an accurate guide to the kinds of behavior that selection would favor. Mothers ought to be providing some aid when there is little chance of reciprocity in the future, and should provide extra aid to offspring who can be expected to reciprocate. What this means is that, if the calculational story is to give values that correlate with the inclusive fitnesses, the perceived gains from future reciprocity have to be inflated. But why should mothers think that their care will be remembered, or, if remembered, that it will trigger a disposition to repay? Furthermore, if sharing is based on the expectation of returns, the young seem bad targets. Other, more mature, members of the group would appear to be better prospects for future aid. There is a final version of the Hobbes-Machiavelli story. Perhaps there's an immediate benefit from sharing, deriving from the mothers' relief from the distress caused by the crying of their young. Instead of acting from their perception of children's needs, they try to promote their own ease by preventing wails, facial expressions, and bodily gestures that would upset them. It is easy to recall occasions on which mothers bribe howling children with food. But we should ask why mothers are so distressed by the cries of their offspring. If the answer is that they attach a high value to situations in which the needs of the young are met, then the Hobbesian story fails to provide any real alternative to the view that attributes altruistic dispositions:</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES 291 mothers rank highly those outcomes in which they share with their young because they want to avoid the distressing cries and the cries are distressing precisely because of their disposition to value the well-being of the young. Even if the offspring are seen as manipu- lating their mothers, the susceptibility to manipulation is rooted in altruistic preferences. This last version leads into a slightly different objection, often voiced by non-philosophers. Surely, on my account, altruists do what they want to do - and isn't doing what one wants to do the epitome of selfishness? This is an illuminating mistake which distorts a genuine insight. Psychological altruism, as many philosophers have recognized,14 is not a matter of going against one's domi- nant desires but rather having dominant desires that are directed towards others. The insight that fuels the objection is that there is a connection between psychological altruism and self-denial, and my notion of psychological altruism makes that connection clear: the altruist prefers to do what she would not have wanted to do but for the benefit that the envisaged action would bring to the other. Altruism suppresses the wants one would have had in response to the perceived wishes of another individual. I conclude that there is no basis for thinking that all the apparently other-directed dispositions that figure in primate social behavior can be reduced to self-interested calculation of some proxies for fitness. Once this point is accepted, we can make sense of a number of examples which those concerned to resist psychological altruism can only treat in a strained fashion. Jane Goodall recounts the story of a young female chimpanzee, Little Bee, who, when accompanied by her partially paralyzed mother, Madam Bee, would routinely slow her gait and would scramble up trees for fruit which she would then share. 15 Frans de Waal, in an extensive catalogue of examples of apparent animal kindliness, reports how a young male chimpanzee saw an older female who had often been friendly to him struggle to loosen a tire partly filled with water, and, after she gave up, solved the problem and presented her with the tire.16 Finally, on at least one occasion, when zookeepers have tried to introduce a new male into a colony whose resident adult male has died, the remaining females have banded together to drive the newcomers out - until a seemingly ordinary male has been accepted, a male who is later</page><page sequence="10">292 PHILIP KITCHER discovered to have associated with one of the females when they were in the same group as juveniles.'7 In none of these instances is it easy to construct a self-interested explanation of the action - unless we assume that the agents are quite seriously confused - but, once we have acknowledged the general possibility of dispositions to form psychologically altruistic valuations, there is a natural account of what is occurring. Nonhuman primates, and, we may safely assume, hominids and humans too, have the capacity for sympathy.'8 IV How far, then, can we expect these altruistic dispositions to extend? My last two examples suggest that the boundaries of psychological altruism reach beyond the circle of immediate kin, but some may wonder whether charity inevitably ends at home. For, even though it is difficult to find a self-interested motivation for maternal care, the classic model of cooperative interactions among non-relatives, artic- ulated in terms of repeated Prisoner's Dilemma, invites the rejoinder that the animals recognize the possibility of reciprocation and resolve to cooperate in the hope of future benefits. If that were so, condi- tion (4) in the definition of weak altruism would not be satisfied. Thus it looks as though a regime of selection based on the recur- rence of PD situations will always leave open the possibility that the psychological dispositions selected involve clever calculation and not genuine altruism. I shall approach this important concern somewhat obliquely. Several years ago, I was struck by the implausibility of suppos- ing that our primate ancestors constantly faced situations in which they were compelled to interact with a particular partner, situations whose structure took the form of PD. Much more likely, I believed, were occasions on which animals had the opportunity either to inter- act with a conspecific or to opt out and to act by themselves, and on which they would have some chance to choose their partners. Consider, for example, social grooming. If we conceive of this as directed at the removal of parasites from fur, then animals can either groom themselves or enter into a grooming partnership; pursuing the latter lays them open to the possibility of exploitation, and, making some plausible assumptions about the benefits of various kinds of grooming and the costs of spending the associated amounts of time,</page><page sequence="11">PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES 293 it was possible to show that this has the structure of an optional game.19 Mathematical arguments supported the conclusion that high levels of cooperation were likely to develop and to be sustained in populations faced with a sufficiently large number of opportunities for playing optional PD with one another.20 Indeed, John Batali and I were able to demonstrate that cooperation emerged more reliably and was maintained significantly more robustly under a regime of selection involving optional games than in the standard scenario (due to Robert Axelrod) in which the games are compulsory. 21 The next obvious task seemed to be to examine the social interactions of primates, and to see how much of it could be reconstructed as a series of optional games. For reasons I can only summarize here, I am now convinced that emerging knowledge of primate social behavior belies the neat, mathematically tractable, models articulated by Axelrod, and modified by Batali and me. In brief, primate societies are typically inhomogeneous (not everyone is prepared to cooperate with every- one else, even when the others are not inclined to defect) and interac- tions are often asymmetrical (the beneficiaries do not always return the favor and are often not sanctioned for their failures to recipro- cate). Thus, in cooperative hunting, those who engage in bringing down the prey are sometimes not rewarded and those who haven't taken part end up with pieces of the spoils.22 Moreover, studies of the contents of chimpanzee feces suggest that meat does not play an important role in the diet of chimpanzees, thus undermining the idea that cooperative hunting is sufficiently significant for natural selection in these situations to shape altruistic dispositions. As I have already noted, social grooming, understood as bringing relief from parasitic infestation, can be viewed as an optional PD, but any account restricted to considerations of hygiene would be hard- pressed to explain the enormous amounts of time that primates spend grooming one another. During some periods in the recorded histories of primate troops - particularly when social tensions are running high - the animals devote three to six hours per day to plucking and smoothing one another's fur.23 Of course, as many primatologists have pointed out, grooming serves important social functions, but, until these are specified we have no basis for assigning the payoffs to</page><page sequence="12">294 PHILIP KITCHER various possible actions or for determining the structure of whatever game the animals are playing.24 The lack of fit between game-theoretic expectations and the character of primate social relations points to a more worrying prob- lem. Although Axelrod's suggestion that animals are forced into partnerships that repeatedly play PD provided an analytic break- through, it should always have seemed implausible as a description of our evolutionary past. The modification I proposed, that the games are optional, not compulsory, was a step in the direction of greater realism, but it did not go far enough. My scenario took it for granted that ur-social animals could be regarded as forming a pool from which potential partners for interactions could be drawn, but this is already to presuppose a minimal form of sociality. It is crucial to ask how these animals could have become sufficiently tolerant of one another's presence to form any such pool. Posing that question makes it apparent that there is an earlier stage of interaction out of which some level of mutual tolerance emerges, and the dynamics of that phase of interactions have to be reflected in understanding the games animals play when they hunt together, divide up resources, groom one another, and so forth.25 The extent to which social relations, tolerance, cooperation and altruistic behavior extends beyond the family varies greatly even within the Great Apes. Male orang-utans are mostly solitary, and, until recently, it appeared that female-female interactions were rela- tively transitory and brief, that the largest social unit was a female travelling with one or two offspring.26 Gibbons divide into small family groups (mother, father, and young) that are typically hostile to outsiders. Groups of gorillas typically contain several adult females, but often have only one adult male; to a first approximation, gorilla social life involves some cooperation among unrelated females and only aggressive interactions among adult males.27 Only in chim- panzees and bonobos do we find larger social units with cooperation among unrelated adults of both sexes. Chimpanzees live in bisexual groups (varying in size from about 20 to about 100), within which there are shifting pattems of alliance and dominance relations. Among bonobos, the groups are somewhat larger (roughly 50 to 150), with the same sorts of changing internal structures. A principal difference between the two groups is that</page><page sequence="13">PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES 295 the major associations in the wild seem to be among chimpanzee males and among bonobo females, although in both species, there are important social interactions among members of the other sex (and between members of opposite sexes). Study of hominid remains suggests that our ancestors lived in sexually mixed groups, and that their size was of the same order as that found in living chimpanzees and bonobos.28 How did the chimp-bonobo-(hominid?) pattern of sociality evolve? Any answer to this question must bring out the salient features that distinguish chimps and bonobos from the other great apes. I shall follow the approach developed by Richard Wrangham, who proposes that female behavior is shaped directly by ecological factors, particu- larly the distribution of food. Males have to adapt to this distribution, adjusting their behavior to maximize the chances of copulating with estrous females.29 Crucial for our purposes in Wrangham's idea that mutually hostile communities of chimpanzees have "evolved from a hypothetical solitary-male system because males could afford to travel in small parties, even though the optimal foraging strategy was to travel alone; they were forced to do so because lone males therefore became vulnerable to attacks by pairs".30 This remark identifies the source of sociality outside the immediate family as lying in the importance of coalitions and alliances. To put the point abstractly: for understanding cooperative interactions among unre- lated animals, PD (whether optional or compulsory) is not funda- mental; the dynamics are set by the problem offorming coalitions and alliances.31 We can develop this idea more generally than Wrangham does by not committing ourselves to his theses about the chief selection pressures on male and female behavior. Suppose, simply, that there is pressure on (sexually undifferentiated) organisms because there is competition for scarce resources, that the animals fight over these resources, and that stronger organisms typically win. We can envis- age a five-step process that might have led from a situation in which there was no cooperation beyond the immediate family to the kind of social structure found in chimpanzees, bonobos (and hominids?). I. Asociality - animals range in the fashion of organutans, finding some resources without contest ("scramble" competition) and competing directly for others ("contest" competition).</page><page sequence="14">296 PHILIP KITCHER II. First coalitions - some animals arise that are disposed to act together in contest and to share the resources so obtained (not necessarily equally). III. Escalation - because of the success of the early coalitions, larger coalitions form, sharing the benefits they earn in contests. IV. Comirunity stabilization - coalition size is ultimately limited by the difficulty of defending all the resources in a range, and the habitat becomes partitioned into ranges defended by stable communities, within which the resources are divided by the formation of subcoalitions. V. Fitness enhancement through cooperation - by engaging in optional games (some of them, perhaps, PD), and behaving cooperatively, members of the stable communities increase their fitness.32 The game-theoretic structure here is much more intricate than the familiar PD. The following sketch will omit virtually all the technical details (some of them important).33 Suppose we have a population of N organisms in a habitat contain- ing R resources. Any organism or coalition of organisms can visit v resources before those resources are renewed. Coalitions, however large, only visit the same number of resources as individuals. There are asymmetries in strength among members of the population, and contests among them are decided by a version of the standard Hawk- Dove game with assessment of strength.34 The crucial point, for our purposes, is that the organisms can detect one another's strength, and, in any interaction, the strongest organism (or coalition) always wins at trivial cost. Assume that the strength of a coalition is the sum of strengths of the members. Finally, this world is non-Rousseauian, in that there are not enough resources for all to acquire the maximum that they could: Nv &gt; R. For almost all ways of developing these assumptions (all ways that do not assign special values to the crucial parameters), it is possible to show the following results: (1) In an initial situation without coalitions, the population will con- tain at least one pair of organisms who can increase their fitness through coalition formation.</page><page sequence="15">PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES 297 (2) Once the first coalition has formed, there will be other pairs of organisms who can increase their fitness through coalition- formation. (3) As larger coalitions form, the fitness benefits are determined, in part, by sub-coalitional alliances. (4) There is a point at which those excluded from the dominant coalition do better to scramble for resources than to form a rival coalition that would contest resources. These results offer a non-constructive argument for the emergence under natural selection of the chimp-bonobo pattern of social inter- action among non-relatives: we expect a partitioning of the habitat into territories defended by groups that band together against rivals, and we expect that, within these groups, there will be subcoalitions that determine the fitness benefits.35 I suspect that it's not hard to see how the coalition-forming process begins and why it escalates, but the termination might appear more mysterious. Here's a quick version of the rationale. Suppose that there's a dominant coalition of size k that obtains v resources to split among its members. If N-k &gt; k, there will typically be a way of permuting the members of the population to form a new dominant coalition, larger than the formerly dominant coalition but in which the payoffs to the continuing members of the former coalition are increased. (The other members of the coalition have to settle for less than the shares formerly given to those whom they displace.) But, if (R-v)I(N-k + 1) &gt; vlk, the member of the k-membered coalition who receives the smallest share does better by simply avoiding the resources that the coalition visits, and scrambling for the remainder. Of course, this scramble competition is likely to give way to a situa- tion in which those excluded from the k-membered coalition contest the R-v resources that the k-membered coalition doesn't visit. Thus we obtain the partitioning of the habitat into territories controlled by sizeable coalitions. So far my conclusions have been about animal social behavior, not directly about psychological altruism. Now, equipped with a sketch of the conditions under which cooperation among non-relatives might emerge, we can go back to the question with which this section began: can we expect natural selection to shape and maintain dispositions to form psychologically altruistic valuations towards</page><page sequence="16">298 PHILIP KITCHER non-relatives? I think that we can. If the selection regime is as I have taken it to be, then it is crucial for animals like chimpanzees, bonobos, and our hominid ancestors, to belong to a society, with- in which they have a place in subsocietal coalitions and alliances. Specifically, young animals, no longer under the constant protec- tion of parents, will need allies if they are to gain anything at all in a competitive world. How are they to find their friends? Primatologists in the grip of the Hobbes-Machiavelli view of sociality-directed-by- manipulative-intelligence might propose that they are able to identify the fitness benefits and calculate their best option. That idea might have some plausibility if the animals could recognize themselves as engaging in something like iterated PD, but it is hopeless in the con- text of the many-person coalitional game. Game theorists are unable to identify best strategies for individuals playing that game, and I see no reason to think that our evolutionary ancestors and relatives had the cognitive resources to find a solution. The strategies that chimpanzees and bonobos adopt seem not to be based on any tallying of costs and benefits. Instead, animals appear prepared to support particular members of their groups with whom they have a history of interactions, often dating back to periods early in their lives. I suggest that these friendships are based on dispositions to construct psychologically altruistic valuations, and that the ability to form such valuations was crucial in the transition to society with internal coalitions. Animals with such dispositions were able to serve as stable coalitional partners. Those who attempted to substitute the clever head for the kindly heart would have been likely to do far worse. This results partly from the fact that the complexity of the coalitional game makes it impossible to pick out detailed solutions. But it is also important to note that the merits of a strategy for allying oneself with others are very sensitive to details about the distribution of resources, the relative strengths of troop members, the reliability of other alliances, and a host of other facts that animals cannot be expected to know and use in their calculations. Particularly in situations in which animals have little opportunity for winning contests by themselves, there will be a selective advan- tage to identifying with the interests of some of one's conspecifics (typically age-mates in the same predicament). The friendships of youth might thus be expected to be particularly deep and enduring.</page><page sequence="17">PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES 299 Perhaps the most dramatic expression of this is the acceptance into a colony of animals whom some residents have known when they were juveniles together. Thus I suggest that the basic disposition to identify and sympathize with close kin was extended in our evolu- tionary past. We share with chimpanzees and bonobos the capacity for forming valuations that are altruistic in the sense of section II, and, if we had not had that capacity, we would not have been able to form the large mixed social units whose traces are found in the prehistoric record. Far from being anthropomorphic, sentimental, or self-deceiving, the hypothesis that we have tendencies to psycho- logical altruism, towards kin and towards some of our non-relatives, seems the best explanation both of the behavior of living animals and of our having achieved the kind of sociality that we share with our evolutionary cousins. v The disposition to form altruistic valuations provides the weak with the opportunity to constrain the behavior of the strong, especially in situations where the consequences are complex and confusing. How- ever this immediately raises the possibility that powerful animals, faced with clear-cut opportunities for gain, might benefit from having quite different tendencies. I now want to acknowledge the genuine insights of the popular primatological perspective that sees social intelligence as Machiavellian. There are occasions on which animals appear to calculate the selfish returns from various courses of action, most notably when they have a clear chance of becoming dominant within their social group. Frans de Waal's original research on the Amhem Chimpanzee colony centered around the ways in which three high-status males - Yeroen, Luit, and Nikkie - related to one another and to the high- status females during times of transitions in power. Each of the males engaged in social interactions that are readily interpretable as directed towards improving their chances for retaining dominance, achieving dominance, or, at worst, serving as the principal lieutenant of the dominant male. In 1976, Luit aided the newly adult Nikkie in achieving dominance over the females in the colony, while Nikkie's diversionary tactics enabled Luit to dethrone Yeroen. Once he had</page><page sequence="18">300 PHILIP KITCHER attained alpha rank, Luit's policy changed. He consolidated his posi- tion by siding with the females and with Yeroen against Nikkie. De Waal interprets the switch as showing "just how much friendships among chimpanzees are situation-liked".36 De Waal elaborates the point as follows: Coalitions based on personal affinities should be relatively stable; mutual trust and sympathy do not appear or disappear overnight. And yet there had been no evidence of stability so far, at least not in the coalitions of the adult males.... If friendship is so flexible that it can be adapted to a situation at will, a better name for it would be oppotunism.37 The subsequent twists and turns of the story underscore de Waal's remarks. Yeroen deserted Luit to form a coalition with Nikkie, so that Nikkie eventually became dominant with Yeroen as his lieutenant. After a subsequent period of tension between the two allies, Luit re-emerged at the top of the hierarchy, apparently in a weak coalition with Nikkie. The uneasy situation was ended by a night fight, in which Luit was fatally injured by the other two.38 To say that there are no stable friendships within chimpanzee communities is too strong, for some coalitions endure for years, even for virtually the entire lifetimes of the animals (before the power struggle began, Yeroen and Luit had been long-time allies). What de Waal's fascinating story reveals - and what is demonstrated by similar instances, less fully documented, among wild chimpanzees - is that the presence of a clear opportunity for self-advancement can strain previous other-directed dispositions. In earlier sections, I've suggested that studies of animal behavior and evolutionary consider- ations support the attribution to our evolutionary relatives and evolu- tionary ancestors of dispositions to form altruistic valuations, but it should no more be supposed that those dispositions will be opera- tive in every context than that they will be evenly directed towards the surrounding individuals. The distinction of the dimensions of psychological altruism is crucial here, as it is to the understanding of the dynamics of coalitions and alliances. For the latter, it is impor- tant that altruistic dispositions differ in their extent. Now we should recognize that the dispositions to form altruistic valuations are not completely pervasive. Different degrees of altruism, characterized by different values of the parameter 0 can be triggered in different situations, depending on the salience of features in the environment and the nature of the background state of body and brain.</page><page sequence="19">PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES 301 De Waal's characterization of the stable dispositions he expected to underlie friendship tacitly supposed that the dispositions would be completely pervasive, and it's clear that Luit and Yeroen had no such tendencies to respond to one another's preferences. However, de Waal's recognition of the "situation-linked" character of their mutual attitudes does seem correct. The stable dispositions of Luit, Yeroen, and other primates, seem best characterized by supposing them to be of the form: If the values of background variables are in S, then the valuation formed is characterized by 0 = ... Animals do not have a fixed value of this parameter towards a conspecific, depending on the strength of the relationship. Of course, I don't know - and nor does anyone else - how to identify the important background variables or to explain how 0 varies with them: all that can be said is that states in which there are clear possibilities for great advantage are likely to increase the value of 0, even setting it equal to 1.31 If indeed we, like chimpanzees and bonobos, have evolved to have dispositions of this form, then we will be vulnerable to two forms of inconsistency. One, diachronic inconsistency, exemplified by the vicissitudes of the relations among Yeroen, Luit, and Nikkie, occurs as different situations generate values of pertinent variables that trigger different dispositions, leading animals sometimes to form valuations directed towards others, sometimes to form selfish valu- ations. Even more interesting is the possibility of synchronic incon- sistency. Suppose that there are two relevant background variables, x andy, and that A has both the following stable dispositions towards B: (a) when x &gt; r, set 0 = 0.5; (b) when y &gt; s, set 0 = 1. What happens to an animal that finds itself in a situation, where x &gt; r and y &gt; s? Both dispositions are activated, two valuations are formed, but (at most) one can be expressed in action. Possible, perhaps - but is there any reason to think that such situ- ations ever occur in the psychological lives of animals. I think there is. Anyone who has spent some time watching social interactions among chimpanzees and bonobos has seen behavior that seems to express two conflicting attitudes. An animal hesitates, torn between different courses of action: we observe the chimpanzee holding a</page><page sequence="20">302 PHILIP KITCHER branch, rich in leaves, poised to strip them off and eat, and, at the same time, we see the body set to acknowledge the presence of a coalition partner and to share. The configuration of limbs and muscles is genuinely a mixture, and the animal's expression reveals the tension of the moment.'" Of course, we're familiar with similar phenomena in our own experience, and philosophers interested in akrasia and free will have found them especially significant. People who are trying to lose weight find themselves tempted by the aromas from the kitchen. They describe themselves as both wanting and not wanting the food, and, in support of their description, we can adduce the active salivary glands as well as the quickened pace. In many such instances, one such preference - one underlying valuation - will be seen as having priority, as being what the person "really" wants. But not in all. Thomas Schelling has been concerned to undermine what he takes to be a fiction of standard decision theory, to wit that there's a stable set of preferences that characterizes a person across a single period of time.4" Schelling uses examples of programs of self-improvement to argue that we can't always identify one of the perspectives with the agent's "real" self. When we reflect on friends who struggle, more or less successfully, to master the Great Books, to play a musical instrument, or to set themselves a regular regime of exercise, we are often torn between thinking of someone as weak in resolve or as refusing to drive herself, interpretations that signal different ways of identifying which are the person's "real" values. So I think that there is some reason to believe that we have evolved to have dispositions to form altruistic valuations that are incom- pletely pervasive, and that, on occasion, we experience genuine conflict among different attitudes to others, including our kin and close friends. I now want to suggest that this picture of our imperfect altruism has some interesting consequences. VI If animals' valuations were genuinely in flux, then their social lives would be very difficult. They are. Peace and mutual tolerance are typically hard won. Precisely because of this, we see so much close social interaction, including lengthy bouts of grooming, within</page><page sequence="21">PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES 303 primate troops. The dispositions to form other-directed valuations makes it possible for the animals to live together; the incomplete pervasiveness of the dispositions means that they frequently act in ways that strain their social relations. Day after day, the social fabric is torn and must be mended by hours of peace-making.42 Perhaps this was once the situation of our ancestors too. However, I conjecture that an important step in hominid evolution liberated us from the oscillations between quarrelling and making-up that seem to dominate chimpanzee and bonobo social life, opening up possibilities for forming larger, and more stable, societies. There are two ways in which the problem posed by synchronically inconsistent valuations can be resolved. One rests on the internal melee. Given the state of background variables, a disposition to form one type of valuation may be rela- tively stronger or weaker, and the resultant action reflects differ- ences in strength. Thus we may suppose that the salience of the opportunity for sole dominant status reinforced Luit's disposition to construct valuations that gave zero weight to the preferences of Nikkie, making that far stronger than the dispositions to form valua- tions accommodating them (valuations that seemed to direct his behavior on other occasions). The other possibility for resolving valuational conflict supposes that agents are not simply passive in the face of competing disposi- tions but able to identify with some and to restrain others. Organ- isms that acquired a capacity for forming "higher-order volitions", coming to have desires about which of their valuations would be effective in action, or a "system of normative control", would be able to achieve a greater consistency in behavior, proving more reliable as allies, and avoiding some situations of social conflict.43 Chimpanzees and bonobos are "wantons", whose dispositions are activated by the pressures of the moment, and whose social lives are thus only held together because of large investments of time in reac- tive peacemaking. At some point in hominid evolution, I suggest, our ancestors replaced this reactive strategy with an approach based on prevention. By regulating, however imperfectly, our clashing dispositions, we became capable of avoiding some situations in which our evolutionary cousins would have been swept into con- flict.</page><page sequence="22">304 PHILIP KITCHER This is a hypothesis about the evolutionary function of morality. It is guided by the obvious problem of two simple alternatives: if we are, by nature, selfish and unscrupulous, then it is unclear how we ever became social beings at all; if we are, by nature, sympathetic and altruistic, then it is not obvious why we need morality. The answer I have suggested proposes that we have a fragile capacity for altruism, enough to bring us together (as other social primates come together) to form enduring societies. Because of the fragility of the altruistic dispositions, social bonds are easily broken, requiring our cousins (and, I assume, our ancestors) to develop and deploy time-consuming techniques of social repair. Even a primitive ability to govern our first-order valuations by norms enabled us to solve the problem of social conflict differently, by pre-emption rather than by reaction. Our first efforts at morality thus reinforced a part of ourselves, the part that had made the transition to complex sociality possible in the first place, and responded to the genuine difficulties that our divided psychology posed for our social predicament. I offer this as a hypothesis that identifies how the evolution of human morality might have gone in its earliest phases." To develop evidence in its favor, we would need to look much more closely at facets of human prehistory that I have ignored here, at the details of chimpanzee and bonobo sociality, at the results of psychological studies of human beings and other primates, at the behavior of people who live in hunter-gatherer societies and at the ways in which they regulate internal conflicts. As a brief illustration, it is worth con- sidering one aspect of those contemporary groups which seem most closely to resemble our hominid ancestors. From Westermarck on, 45 anthropologists have documented the pervasiveness and importance of systems of kinship, often apparently artificial. Being a member of a particular subgroup of the total community fixes the ways in which individuals are supposed to behave in situations of internal strife. A person is primarily identified as a member of the Bear Clan (say), imposing the obligation to show solidarity with another clan member who is in dispute with an outsider. Rules of the form "Always ally with the Xs against others!" are by far the most prominent among the imperatives that govern the lives of hunter-gatherers. Why is this? In light of the approach I've adopted, there's an obvious explana- tion. Recall that the most fundamental problems in social interaction</page><page sequence="23">PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES 305 involve coalitions and alliances. The incomplete pervasiveness of our dispositions to form altruistic valuations towards erstwhile allies is the chief threat to the stability of the coalitions on which social life depends. Hence it is hardly surprising that the primary normative rules should tell us who our allies are and command us to stick with them. The example I've just sketched foreshadows the way in which my speculations should be made more definite and how they should be defended. As with Darwin's "long argument", the defense must come in showing how a large body of phenomena can be coherently understood.6 My uses of various pieces of primatological data in this essay should be viewed as first gestures in this direction. I want to close this section by identifying, as clearly as possible, my view of the link between evolution and ethics. If my hypothesis is correct, then characteristics of moral agents, including incompletely pervasive dispositions to psychological altruism and the capacity for normative guidance have been shaped by natural selection. At some point in our prehistory, our ancestors developed a system of proto- morality, a set of rules that reinforced their fragile altruistic tenden- cies and that enabled them to live in social groups that were subject to less constant rupture and needed less frequent repair. The transition from proto-morality - consisting, perhaps, in a simple set of rules for identifying allies (apparently the core norms of hunter-gatherer societies) - to the complex moral systems and moral reflections of recorded history should not be seen, on my story, as a further elaboration of evolution under natural selection. I have made no explicit claims about the emergence of morality from proto-morality, but it seems to me overwhelmingly plausible that this history has been guided mainly, if not exclusively, by forces of cultural, rather than natural selection. The point of my conjecture is not to connect Darwinian evolution directly with contemporary moral norms, but to view it as yielding the preconditions for the historical develop- ment of morality, a process during which simple kinship rules have been profoundly enriched and, indeed, out of which the distinction of morality from other systems of rules has itself emerged. However, I do want to emphasize the idea that our moral demands have a long and complicated history, that, like other human practices, morality is not adopted by transcending one's society and one's training (and the</page><page sequence="24">306 PHILIP KITCHER long traditions that stand behind it). G.E. Moore may have found it evident that "[b]y far the most valuable things, which we know or can imagine, are certain states of consciousness, which may be roughly described as the pleasures of human intercourse and the enjoyment of beautiful objects",47 but I think it far more likely that Moore's judgment depended on the intellectual ontogeny that led him out of late Victorian England and into Cambridge and Bloomsbury than that it rested on any sudden insight, independent of the long moral tradition in which he stood. Moore's refined reflections are at a far remove from the social lives of primates, but, on the perspective I commend, they have been shaped by the long history that leads from the inconsistent altruists on the savannah to the civilized discussions at King's and Trinity. VII Why should the admittedly speculative story I have told be taken to have any relevance at all to contemporary discussions in moral philosophy? Although I once believed that the project of uncovering the historical processes through which modem moral practices have emerged, tracing them to distant biological roots, was perfectly legit- imate, I didn't view it as affecting either philosophical discussions in meta-ethics or substantive normative debates.48 I now think that that view was mistaken on the first score: understanding the genealogy of morals has meta-ethical implications. Consider some questions that are at the center of twentieth- century debates. Is there moral knowledge? Do moral statements have truth-values? Are moral reasons always overriding? Why should a rational egoist obey any moral rule? Such questions are typically treated as if the psychological character of moral agents could be ignored, as if the social contexts in which morality is learned are irrelevant, and as if the history of the tradition out of which contemporary moral practices come makes no difference. Moral metaphysics and moral epistemology look much like the analytic metaphysics and epistemology of the mid-century. I suggest that these areas of philosophy may benefit from the same kind of natu- ralism that a number of recent writers have urged in epistemology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of science.49</page><page sequence="25">PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES 307 Let me close by looking very briefly at one of the ways in which the story I have outlined might restructure debate. Persons, I've suggested, have the capacity for acquiring a store of rules and for deploying those rules to reinforce some of the valuations they gener- ate, so that those valuations become effective in action. Call the set of stored rules the individual's moral code. The rudiments of moral codes are acquired during youth, largely as the result of the incul- cation of standards to which the surrounding community professes allegiance, but moral codes can grow from there as a result of later experiences, including increasing awareness of other possibilities, frustrations born of attempting to honor demands that prove too tax- ing, efforts to achieve consistency and coherence, and so forth. Once a moral code is in place, it need not be confined to the task of iden- tifying with a particular valuation already generated. The injunction to obey a particular rule may produce a new valuation, one that overrides valuations generated from the background psychological state. Even at this schematic level of psychological detail, we should recognize four importantly different cases in which a person does what a moral rule commands. (1) Through a response to the situation which is quite inde- pendent of the rule, the agent constructs a single valuation that gives highest priority to the commended action, and that valuation leads directly to action. (A parent plunges into the water to rescue a drowning child, without having the thought that this is what duty requires.)5? (2) Incompatible valuations are present as the result of rule- independent responses, and the guidance of the rule reinforces one. (Someone has a sympathetic response to the predicament of two friends whose wants cannot be simultaneously satisfied, and the rule reinforces one.) (3) The single valuation present as a result of rule-independent responses is not in accordance with the rule, and the rule generates a new, overriding valuation. (A parent feels sorry for a naughty child but recognizes that it is best to punish him.)</page><page sequence="26">308 PHILIP KITCHER (4) Continued performance of an initially unpleasant duty produces a new disposition to generate a valuation in accordance with what the rule commands, so that later actions are unmediated by the rule. (Someone begins work to aid people who originally seem repulsive, but ultimately come to appear lovely.) Because contemporary moral philosophy has been beguiled by the idea that people have a single, coherent, set of preferences (at least at one time), two of these cases - (1) and (3) - have come to appear central, so that our choices in moral psychology are between a warm- hearted, but sloppy, Humean agent or a punctilious, but unfeeling, Kantian taskmaster.5" This is a mistake. Moral agency depends fundamentally on both the natural dispositions to sympathy and on the normative guidance that makes up for their shortcomings - (2) and (4) are as central to our moral lives as (1) and (3). Praiseworthy as sympathy can often be, there is a lurking distrust of the sympathy of the wanton because it is uncontrolled and unreliable. Likewise the worthiness of rising above inclinations has to be understood against the background in which normative control finds its functions, conditions in which we have incompletely pervasive dispositions to sympathize with others, dispositions that make sociality, and ultimately morality, possible. A being who had no natural dispositions to regulate would not seem fully human, and one who never had the appropriate sympathies would appear perverse. Our system of normative control is a capacity for adopting rules that govern existing valuations and that bring new ones into being (cases like (4)). We cannot think of the system as external to our wishes, for it reinforces some and is responsible for the presence of others, but neither can we view the operation of the system as determining what the person "really" wants.52 According to my evolutionary account, the capacity for regulat- ing the flux of our dispositions is a hominid solution for solving a recurrent problem in the lives of social animals. If that problem is to be solved, then the moral codes that individuals internalize must reinforce valuations that promote stable patterns of interaction with- in the community, and should thus contain directives to take into account the preferences of others - for it is precisely such valua-</page><page sequence="27">PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES 309 tions that inspire actions maintaining social order. With this in mind, the traditional philosophical question "Why should a rational egoist obey the demands of morality?" should be reconceived. A first response should be to protest that the rational egoist is a fiction, for (virtually) all of us have dispositions to form altru- istic valuations. Although these dispositions may sometimes conflict with other dispositions, they cannot be dismissed. Moreover, our dispositions are shaped, and, in some instances, brought into being, by the socialization that we receive from birth in which we absorb the moral lore of our communities. Insofar as we can make sense of a person as an agent with a determinate, coherent, set of preferences, those preferences are shaped through the adoption of a moral code. Prior to the internalization of the code, there is only a flux of often- clashing dispositions. The response invites a second version of the question - "Why should we not want to be wantons?". Surely the best approximation to the fictitious rational egoist is a character for whom the strongest valuation always wins out in the internal melee. Now this is not our predicament, for, on my hypothesis, our evolutionary history took a different direction, but, in any event, we should recognize that the social life of wantons would be very different from ours (perhaps like those of chimpanzees and bonobos). It would not have the unrestrained savagery Hobbes supposed to be the lot of people in the state of nature, but it would have the sporadic uneasiness found in the lives of our closest evolutionary relatives, and it is highly doubtful that it could accommodate most of the things that people have come to want. The third, and most interesting, version of the question stems from the recognition that a system of morality may chafe. In extreme instances, a person may have a disposition to construct valuations opposed to the demands of the prevailing moral code, a disposition that cannot be overridden by his system of normative control, even though there is no defect in his capacity for normative control. How should situations of this kind be characterized, and when do they provide agents with justification for rejecting parts of the moral code? In this form, the question leads into the largest and most difficult questions in meta-ethics, questions about the justification of moral change, the possibility of seeing moral change as progressive,</page><page sequence="28">310 PHILIP KITCHER and about the feasibility of viewing the historical development of morality as a process that tracks moral truth. I believe that exploration of this area would reconfigure contemporary debates between moral cognitivists and non-cognitivists, but I hope to have said enough already to have defended the claim that my speculative evolutionary history may have philosophical implications. NOTES 1 The present essay is a fragment of a much longer work-in-progress. Parts of this work have been presented to audiences at the University of California at Irvine, University College London, Princeton University, Stanford University, Wash- ington University, the University of California at San Diego, and the University of Illinois, as well as at the Pacific Division Meeting of the American Philosophical Association. Many people have given me helpful advice and constructive criti- cisms. I am particularly grateful to Richard Arneson and Brian Skyrms for their suggestions, and to David Brink for helpful written comments on the penultimate draft. 2 I should note explicitly that it is this last condition that seems to pose most difficulties for an evolutionary explanation of psychological altruism. It is also worth pointing out that I want to adopt a liberal conception of B's "presence", taking B to be present when A recognizes that the available actions have an impact on B's preferences. The third condition may be easiest to satisfy when, although B is not physically present, A can perceive that B would benefit from certain options available to A: imagine cases in which A has the opportunity to summon B to share a good. 3 Thus I intend the notion of valuational structure to subsume the concepts of utility matrix and of the representation of games in normal form. 4 The minimal condition for A to be altruistic is that A should take B's prefer- ences into some account in evaluating options - as my account of weak altruism requires. But we are typically interested in much stronger types of altruism, those which play a systematic role in the readjustment of preferences so that there is a difference to action. The ensuing discussion will show how these can be captured within the framework I am proposing. 5 For a relatively simple version of a case like this, see 0. Henry's short story The Gift of the Magi. A much more complex and interesting example occurs in the closing pages of Henry James' The Golden Bowl. Martha Nussbaum gives a brilliant discussion of the nuances of the Ververs' perceptions of their mutual accommodation in her essay " 'Finely Aware and Richly Responsible': Literature and the Moral Imagination" in Love's Knowledge, New York: Oxford University Press, 1990, pp. 148-167. 6 I used this term in "The Evolution of Human Altruism", Journal of Philosophy, 90, 1993, 497-516. It is important to note that, in that essay, I had a rather different conception of the relationship among the psychological states of altruists, so that although the earlier account is similar to that presented here it is not the same.</page><page sequence="29">PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES 311 7 I mention this putative principle, because it reveals the kinds of questions that my account of psychological altruism ought to address. This essay concentrates only on simple cases, and the relations among dimensions of altruism will be explored in future work. 8 In such instances, the altruist will think of the beneficiary's actual preferences as not according with the beneficiary's interests, either because the beneficiary intends to sacrifice her own interests to promote those of the altruist or because she fails to have a correct conception of what her interests are. If one subscribes to a view of a person's good on which it is not reducible to what the person would want under epistemically improved (or ideal) circumstances, then one may also think that there are further cases in which the altruist takes into account the beneficiary's real interests and not her preferences (or even her suitably refined preferences). 9 In "The Evolution of Human Altruism", my notion of paternalistic altruism was only partial. I am grateful to Richard Arneson for helping me to see this. 10 The recent literature in primatology supplies abundant evidence for the first two of these claims, and can, I think, be used to defend the third. See especially Dorothy Cheney and Robert Seyfarth How Monkeys See The World (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990) Chapters 3 and 8; Jane Goodall The Chimpanzees of Gombe (Cambridge MA.: Harvard University Press, 1986); C. Bachmann and H. Kum- mer "Male Assessment of Female Choice in Hamadryas Baboons", Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 6, 1980, pp. 315-321; and R. Byrne and A. Whiten (eds.) Machiavellian Intelligence (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988), partic- ularly the essay by Nicholas Humphrey. l l Many, though not all, of the essays in Machiavellian Intelligence adopt this perspective, and, for a more pronounced articulation of the theme that intelli- gence is a tool for calculating egoists, see James Barkow, Leda Cosmides and John Tooby (eds.) The Adapted Mind, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992. Interestingly, some of the papers that inspired the tradition explicitly allow that the Hobbes-Machiavelli picture of ruthless, self-interested agents may be inade- quate to account for the psychology of social animals. See, for example, Nicholas Humphrey "The Social Function of Intellect" (Machiavellian Intelligence pp. 13- 26) especially p. 23. 12 See "The Evolution of Human Altruism", where I offered both the kin selection example and a much more extensive argument for the possibility that golden-rule altruism can originate and be sustained under natural selection. For reasons that will become apparent later, the selection regime envisaged there, involving iterated optional Prisoner's Dilemma can only be a small part of the story of the evolution of psychological altruism. I should also note that my earlier discussion did not respond adequately to the second type of worry about altruistic dispositions, since if has seemed to some people that reciprocal altruism could be fuelled by explicit calculation. 13 See Mary Midgley Beast and Man, Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1978 and my Vaulting Ambition. 14 For a particularly lucid formulation of this point, see Joel Feinberg "Psycho- logical Egoism", reprinted in Feinberg (ed.) Reason and Responsibility, Belmont CA.: Wadsworth. 15 Goodall The Chimpanzees of Gombe, Cambridge MA.: Harvard University Press, 1986.</page><page sequence="30">312 PHILIP KITCHER 16 Frans de Waal, Good Natured, Cambridge MA.: Harvard University Press, 1996. 17 De Waal, Good Natured, pp. 131-132. 18 My usage of this term is intended to resonate with the suggestions of David Hume and Adam Smith, both of whom I take to have been broadly right about our sentiments. As we shall see, my picture of human agency diverges from theirs in some important respects. 19 This was worked out in John Batali and Philip Kitcher "Evolution of Altruism in Optional and Compulsory Games", Journal of Theoretical Biology, 175, 1995, pp. 161-171. 20 See "The Evolution of Human Altruism", and "Evolution of Altruism in Optional and Compulsory Games". 21 Axelrod's pioneering work is summarized in The Evolution of Cooperation, New York: Basic Books, 1984, which served as the stimulus for the work that Batali and I undertook. Interestingly what we showed is not quite what we (and our predecessors) set out to prove, to wit the stability of cooperation. Rather, we demonstrated the instability of the absence of cooperation, and indeed, the absence of high levels of cooperation. (In our simulations, the frequency of cooperation in any generation is either extremely low or else very high). In "The Evolution of Human Altruism", I argued further that the iterated optional PD regime would favor the emergence of golden-rule altruism. I would now put the conclusion a little differently: the formal relationship among preferences corresponds to the golden-rule value, H = 0.5, but it is possible that this relationship is set up as the result of explicit calculation of expected benefits (in defiance of condition (4) on weak psychological altruism). This conclusion hasn't yet been tested on computer simulations. 22 See, for example, Jane Goodall's detailed story of a hunt, The Chimpanzees of Gombe pp. 288-289. 23 See De Waal Chimpanzee Politics and Peacemaking Among Primates. Of course, it is possible that the high frequency of grooming is an artefact of the captive situations in which primates have been most closely observed, although studies of wild populations do support the idea that grooming occurs far more often than is needed for purely hygienic reasons. 24 Most obviously, if, in addition to the hygienic benefits, there's a sizeable social payoff that can only be achieved through cooperative behavior, then the game being played is no longer optional PD - indeed, the largest payoff by far may be associated with cooperation with animals who are longstanding allies. 25 This is not to deny that the phenomena investigated by Axelrod and his succes- sors (including Batali and me) don't have a place in the understanding of social relations, cooperative behavior, and altruism, but rather that these can only be properly understood when we have a clear view of the social matrix in which they are set. An analogous point applies to the kinds of interactions explored brilliantly by Brian Skyrms (Evolution of the Social Contract, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996). I develop this point in a commentary on Skyrms' book (to appear in a symposium in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research). 26 See Peter Rodman and John Mitani "Orangutans: Sexual Dimorphism in a Solitary Species" in Barbara Smuts et al. (eds.) Primate Societies, Chicago: Uni- versity of Chicago Press, 1987, pp. 146-154. I have heard from several people</page><page sequence="31">PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES 313 that the "standard view" outlined in this article has been challenged by further studies of female associations, but I do not know of any published sources. 27 See Donna Leighton "Gibbons: Territoriality and Monogamy", and Kelly Stewart and Alexander Harcourt "Gorillas: Variation in Female Relationships", both in Smuts et. al. Primate Societies (pp. 135-145, and 155-164, respectively). 28 It may be pertinent to note that some human groups of hunter-gatherers tend to undergo fission when their size exceeds 150 to 300. One example is the Yanomamo; see Napoleon Chagnon "Fission in a Yanomamo Tribe", The Sciences, 16, 1976, pp. 14-18. 25 See R.

Wrangham bases his approach on the idea that the principal determinant of female reproductive success will be her access to food, and that the principal determinant of male reproductive success will be the ability to copulate as frequently as possible with an estrous female. On his account orang- utans pursue their relatively solitary lives because females can most efficiently forage for fruit by working alone, and males have the physical abilities to defend a home range including the smaller home ranges of several females. As will be clear below, I'm going to abstract from some of the particularities of Wrangham's discussion, offering a more general model of which his explanation would be a special case. 3; "Evolution of Social Structure" p. 290. Compare Hobbes: "the weakest has strength enough to kill the strongest, either by secret machination, or by confed- eration with others that are in the same danger with himself" (Leviathan p. 183). However, Hobbes would not have thought that this could apply to the brutes, because, without speech "there had been amongst men neither Common-wealth, nor Society, nor Contract, nor Peace, no more than amongst Lyons, Bears, and Wolves" (Leviathan p. 100). Hobbes underrated the lions and the wolves, and knew nothing of the chimpanzees and bonobos. 31 For similar suggestions to the effect that the most important issues about evolution of cooperation and sociality need to move beyond PD, see R. Noe "Alliance Formation among Male Baboons: Shopping for Profitable Partners", in A. Harcourt and F. de Waal (eds.) Coalitions and Alliances in Humans an Other Animals, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992, pp. 285-321. Several of Noe's points about baboons are analogues of claims I have made about chimpanzees. See, for example, his finding that coalitions and alliances can persist even when one of the parties never receives what is apparently the main prize. 32 Note that the fitness values that occur in the payoff matrices for these games have to be computed by taking into account the consequences of the actions for the underlying alliances and coalitions to which the agent belongs. This articulates the point made earlier that the structure of animal interactions cannot be understood in isolation from the demands of the most fundamental game, here identified as the coalition-formation game. 33 I hope to present these in a book that will work out the project begun in this essay.</page><page sequence="32">314 PHILIP KITCHER 34 See, for example, John Maynard Smith, Evolution and the Theory of Games, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982, p. 108. 35 The argument is non-constructive because it says that there will be coalitional structure without saying what it is. As will become clear, I don't know how to determine the structure, even given full information about the initial conditions. So the claim is roughly as useful as the mean-value theorem, which tells us that there is a maximum of a function within a particular interval, without specifying where it is. That sort of information was good enough for a celebrated application of Reaganomics - and, in the present context, we'll see that the absence of a constructive argument has philosophical implications. 36 Chimpanzee Politics, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1984, p. 126. My subse- quent discussion will explain, and partially endorse, this reading of de Waal's. It's important to note, however, that the picture of cunning political agents, given in de Waal's first book is softened in his second (Peace-Making Among Primates, Cambridge M.: Harvard University Press, 1989), and replaced by an emphasis on animal sympathy and altruism in his most recent (Good Natured). Although I cannot fully document it here, I think that my analysis of the psychological altru- ism found in chimpanzees and bonobos explains the complex findings recorded by de Waal, offering a perspective from which all his observations fit together. 37 Chimpanzee Politics p. 128. 38 Peacemaking Among Primates Chapter 2. De Waal makes the important obser- vation that Luit's desire to remain with his troop was so strong that it was difficult to remove him, even after he had been severely wounded. 39 I should acknowledge that there are obvious concerns, given our ignorance of the nature of the dependence, about the testability of attributions of conflicting dispositions. A general response to these concerns would note that we should not be bound by any operational imperative; more specifically, I think that there are forms of behavior that provide evidence for the claim that an animal has a disposition to produce conflicting valuations (see the text below). The approach taken here has some kinship with Walter Mischel's emphasis on the failure of cross-situational consistency in people who have stable personality profiles (see W. Mischel and Y. Shoda "A Cognitive-Affective System Theory of Personality: Reconceptualizing Situations, Dispositions, Dynamics, and Invariance in Person- ality Structure", Psychological Review, 102, 1995, pp. 246-268; I am grateful to George Mandler for drawing my attention to the problem of trait consistency, and suggesting that I read Mischel's work). There are also connections between the approach I am adopting here and some of Anthony Damasio's work on decision- making and its neural disruption; see his Descartes' Error, New York: Putnam's 1994. For reasons of space, I can't elaborate the affinities here. 40 This provides a start on an answer to worries about testability. We can some- times suppose that conflicting valuations are reflected in different signals sent to various parts of the body - one valuation would be relevant to the state of one bodily system but not to another, and conversely, so that the overall state of he body is a mosaic. In general, we might test the presence of attitudes not by focus- ing on behavior but on readiness for behavior. 41 T. Schelling "The Intimate Contest for Self-Command", Chapter 3 of Choice and Consequence, Cambridge MA.: Harvard University Press, 1984, pp. 57-82. The discussions on pp. 60-61 are especially pertinent.</page><page sequence="33">PSYCHOLOGICAL ALTRUISM, EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS, AND MORAL RULES 315 42 For details of peace-making strategies, see de Waal Peacemaking Among Primates. 43 I deliberately use terminology of Harry Frankfurt ("Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person", Journal of Philosophy, 68, 1970, pp. 5-20) and of Allan Gibbard (Wise Choices, Apt Feelings Cambridge MA.: Harvard University Press, 1990). It seems to me that Frankfurt's and Gibbard's insights can be connected with the evolutionary perspective I am developing. I suspect that Gibbard would approve of this, although Frankfurt might view it as misguided and unnecessary. 44A number of people (most forcefully Bas van Fraassen) have expressed surprise that the author of a book critical of human sociobiology might want to speculate in this area. I am sensitive to this concern. My best attempt to lay it to rest runs as follows: human morality is a natural phenomenon, that must fit, somehow, into our natural history; the last chapter of Vaulting Ambition identifies some ways in which I think that it does not fit, but my criticisms there will never be fully convincing unless I can devise a better account; any such account should not aspire to do more than show how human morality could have begun (in standard terminology, it is a "how possibly" explanation - see Vaulting Ambition p. 72 ff.); but finding any account that coheres with what we know about other primates and about ourselves is very hard, and it seems to me that standard philosophical accounts of our moral psychology are in constant danger of conjuring illusory faculties and abilities that are quite at odds with what we take ourselves to know about animal behavior; thus it seems worthwhile offering an avowedly conjectural picture and exploring how the problems of moral philosophy look from its perspective. (Although this is my favorite response to a common concern, it does not satisfy me on every day of the week.) 45 Edward Westermarck's comparative survey of social rules in "primitive" societies, The Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas, London: MacMillan, 2 vols., 1906-1908, is a mine of comprehensive information. 46 For an argument that this was Darwin's strategy see my essay "Darwin's Achievement" (in N. Rescher [ed.] Reason and Rationality in Science, University Press of America, 1985). 47 Moore Principia Ethica, New York: Prometheus Books, 1988, p. 188 (section 113). 48 See Vaulting Ambition Chapter 11, and "Four Ways of Biologicizing Ethics", in Elliott Sober (ed.) Conceptual Issues in Evolutionary Biology (second edition), Cambridge MA.: MIT Press, 1994. 49 For representative versions of the kinds of naturalism I have in mind, see Alvin Goldman Epistemology and Cognition (Cambridge MA.: Harvard Univer- sity Press, 1986), Fred Dretske Naturalizing the Mind (Cambridge MA.: MIT Press, 1994), and my own The Nature of Mathematical Knowledge (New York: Oxford University Press, 1983) and The Advancement of Science (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993). 50 This, of course, is Bernard Williams' famous "one thought too many". See "Persons, Character and Morality", in Amelie Rorty (ed.) The Identities ofPersons, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976, pp. 197-216, especially pp. 213- 215. 51 Although (1) and (3) represent cartoon versions of what goes on in our moral lives, the cartoons are influential. A presently unpublished lecture by Barbara Herman has convinced me that Kant's actual views are much more nuanced</page><page sequence="34">316 PHILIP KITCHER and intricate, and Hume's moral psychology is also more sophisticated (as his discussions of artificial virtues make clear). But neither Hume nor Kant nor the philosophers they have influenced seem to escape the idea that we have a coherent set of preferences, and hence do not recognize the need to address the four types of moral agency as equally fundamental. 52 Partly, this is for reasons offered by Schelling in Choice and Consequence, which show how systems of normative control can be inept or incomplete. Further problems result from the fact that we can recognize dispositions in the agent that produce valuations clashing with the system of normative control as genuine expressions of the agent's character and desires. The philosophical tradition is heavily inclined towards the view of the system of normative control as consti- tuting the wishes of a "real" self, but psychodynamic conceptions stemming from Freud should remind us of the repressive possibilities of a system of norma- tive control. See, for two very different examples, Freud's The Ego and the Id, and George Ainslie's Picoeconomics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992). Samuel Scheffler has offered a penetrating account of the implications of some aspects of Freud's work for our understanding of central issues in moral psychology, and I think that the picture I sketch here could be articulated to capture his insights.
