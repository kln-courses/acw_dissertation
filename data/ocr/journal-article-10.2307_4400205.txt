<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dalits and Non Brahmin Consciousness in Colonial Tamil Nadu V Geetha S V Rajadurai The emergence of dalitpiolitical voice in the Tamil region in the 19th centlury predates the political expression of non- brahminism and wvas influenced by the transforrmations inaugiurated by colonialism. This article examines the oorks of some of the morepromlinent dalit intellectuials wsho lived and worked in the closing decades of the 19th centlury. THE emergence of a dalit consciousness and a dalit political voice in the Tamil country during the last quarter of the 19th century is a phenomenon that has received very little critical and scholarly attention. What is even less known is the fact that such expression of a distinctive dalit sensibility predated the political expression of non- brahminism in the Tamil regions of the old Madras presidency and eventually came to constitute an important and decisive flank of the non-brahmin movement. Tamil life and consciousness were transformed by the complex of events and intellectual practices inaugurated by colonialism and these trans- formations had contributed to the so-called 'panchamas' acquiring a measure of dignity and self-worth.' The last decades of the 19th century saw the emergence of dalit journalism as the newly literate andbilingual panchama intel- lectuals came to negotiate their lives and history in the changed circumstances. Like their upper caste counterparts, panchama intellectualswerewell-acquainted with con- temporary debates in history, historiogra- phy, linguistics as well as with develop- ments in the related fields of epigraphy, numismatics and textual herenutics. They werealsokeen observersandparticipantsin the game of appropriating and 'owning' history, a game which had become an al I -too serious occupation of native intellectuals and their colonial masters. Panchama intel- lectuals were actively involved in political and social reform activities aimed at the 'uplift' oftheircommunity and some among them were extremely sensitive to the poli- tics of caste that underwt'ote all nationalist and social-reform efforts. In this article we propose to examine the thoughts of some of the more prominent dalit intellectuals of the day, who lived and worked in the closing decades of the previ- ous century and in the early decades of this one. One of the most fascinating and sadly neglected figures of late 19th century Tamil intellectual life is Ayothidas Pandithar. A panchama by birth, he was born in a village, in Coimbatore district. His given name was Karthavarayan, butin lateryears, he adopted the name of his teacher-scholar, Ayothidasa Kaviraja Pandithar. Ayothidas' writings re- veal him to be well-acquainted with San- skrit, Pali, English and of course, Tamil. He was familiarwith ancient Tamil classicsand seemed to have been learned in the philo- sophical thought of not only Hinduism, but Buddhism, Jainism, Islam and Christianity as well. In his youth, he was attracted to Advaita Vedanta and founded the Advaitananda Sabha in 1870 in Nilgiris where he spent his early years. During this period in his life he mobilisedtribal people in the area under the auspices of the Sabha against the proselytising activities of Chris- tian missionaries. Later in life he came under the influence of Colonel Olcott and helped him and Annie Besant set up panchama schools in Madras city. Colonel Olcott seemed to have been instrumental in Ayothidas renouncing his Hlindu faith for Buddhism. He accompanied the former to Ceylon in 1898 and even addressed a Buddhist congregation there. On his return to Madras he founded the Chakya Buddhist Sangam in Royappetah with the avowed aim of reviving Buddhism in Tamil country. The Sangam organised regular lectures on Buddhism, Atheism and speakers included Lakshminarasu, M Singaravelu Chetty and Ayothidas himself. (By this time, Ayothidas had moved away from the theosophists in his outlook and views.) The activities of the Sangam pro- voked Saivite scholars such as Kathiraivel Pillai into refuting Buddhist philosophy. However, at least one Saivite scholar, the nationalist non-brahmin, Thiru Vi Kalyanasundaranar admitted that the talks and discourses that he attended and listened to helped to rnoderate his excessive Hindu feelings. Prior to founding the Chakya Buddhist Sangam, Ayothidas had founded in 1881 the Dravida Mahajana Sangam. In that year the Colonial Census was begun in earnest and Ayothidas, on behalf of the Dravida Mahajana Sanga, memoralised the colonial government on an issue that was to remain a concern of his all through his active and intellectual life: he submitted that the de- pressed classes (chiefly pariah) should, henceforth, be referred to as 'Poorva Tamizhar'. The first conference of the Dravida Mahajana Sangam was held on December 1, 1881 and it would be interest- ing to consider its charter of demands here, for they antici pate future demands and nmore important to our purpose, tell us something about the calibre of the men who constituted the Sangam: (1) A law should be enacted to severely punish those who refer to the de- pressed classes as 'pariahs' in order to de- grade and insult them. (2) Since education was crucial to progress, separate schools should be opened in each village for the children ofthe depressed classes, whoshould also be given a 50 per cent concession in school fees. (3) Out of those students from the depressed classes who pass matricula- tion exam every year, three students should be selected by the government for a stipend grant so as to enable them to continue their studies till graduation. (4) Employment in government service should be ensured to all those among the depressed classes who have passed their matriculation examina- tion. (5) There should not be any hindrance to people of the depressed 'classes from acquiringemployment opportunities invari - ous (government) services on the basis of their educational qualifications and con- duct. (6) Representatives of the depressed classes should be appointed in villages and towns who would report to the government on their grievances regarding employment opportunities. Even while taxpayers amongst the depressed classes are selected for em- ployment in government services, such se- lections should be based only on educa- tional qualifications and conduct. (7) Sec- tion 46 A of the Prison Manual should be abrogated, since it assigns only lowly jobs such as scavenging to depressed classes prisoners in jails. (8) Depressed classes should be allowed the right to collect drink- ing water from public wells and tanks with- out any hindrance. (9) The existing bar on pariahs which prevents them from entering and sitting in offices and courts where upper caste HIindus are employed should be lifted. (10) Persons from the depressed classes of good character and conduct should be cho- sen for the post of village 'munsiffs' and 'maniakatars'. When the district collectors visit the villages, people from the depressed classes should be given the opportunity to Economic and Political Weekly September 25, 1993 2091</page><page sequence="2">contact them directly and air their griev- ances and seek remedial measures. While most of these demands focus on the educa- tional and professional needs and expecta- tions of pariahs, some of them represent a will and desire on the part of the panchama to carry themselves with self-respect. Edu- cation is seen here as a great leveller and the chief means of access to secular as well as political power. These demandswere sent to Veeraraghavachariar, the general secretary of the Indian National Congress but there was no response and in 1908 Ayothidas recalled that even after a lapse of 17 years he had not heard anything from the Congress. He also noted that the demands had not elicited any response from even those Mus- lim organisations to whom they had been sent in 1881. Ayothidas was highly critical of Con- gress-nationalist representative claims and of their policy of 'reform along national lines'. He was not convinced of the immi- nent good of native self-govemment and found the British more acceptable than the brahmins. Heoftenobserved that itwasonly with the arrival of the British the panchama had been brought to a realisation of his own humanity, since it was the British who first affirmed his selfhood and treated him like a human being. As far as he was concerned, the Congress was a party of 'brahmanas' who were intent on perpetuating caste in- equalities and prejudices. Ayothidas was particularly harsh on Congress squabbles, aswere evident during the Surat Congress of 1906 which saw a scuffle break out between the 'moderates' and 'extremists'. He con- sidered such fights most unbecoming of an organisation that claimed its members were enlightened and educated. In this context he observed thattheCongZesswascharacterised by a lot of talk and noise and wondered whether such a body as the Congress would be able to act at all, if self-government were indeed made a reality: "Will they make pariahs governors and the brahmins army commanders? Never. Instead they will ar- gue that the low castes cannot govern, while the high caste brahmanas are not trained to fight. Will they at least agree to brahmins being given the posts of governors while the pariahs are asked to be army commanders? Certainly not. The reasori being that they (the brahmins) will seek to remember their historical enmity towards Buddhism and fear to make pariahs army commanders, since the latter might plan revenge." (Ayothida writings constantly play off the wisdom and egalitarianism of Buddhism, which he claims to have been the original religion of the pariahs, against the inherent folly and deceptions of brahmi nism, a theme we shall soon have occasion to consider.) To Ayothidas, self-government would be possible only when "Brahmins cease to run away in fear on seeing a pariah and when pariahs cease to chase away Brahmins and throw cow dung at them when the latter enter the pariah quarters in the village; and harmony prevails between the two and they come together as brothers and when the Buddha dhamma is realised." Ayothidas observed that self-government could not be had by the boycott of foreign goods and noted that what was, in fact, required and necessary was the boycott of practices of caste, religion and of t6ddy shops. The nationalist boycott of foreign goods, espe- cially cloth, said Ayothidas, merely results in the price of cloth going up which causes hardship tb the poor. Ayothidas' objections to self-government stemmed not only from his suspicion of Congress intentions but also from a deeply felt gratitude to the British. It was not that he saw the white man as a saviour for on a different context he wrote that employment in a white man's home brought only temporary relief to the pariah; while proximity to the white man confirmed the pariah in his own humanity, it also brought him uncertainty since he often had to move his home and belongings at the behest of his masters who were prone to travel. Ayothidas was not particularly enamoured of Christianityaswell. The C:hris- tian convert was still marked by caste and continued tobe referred toas a pariah Chris- tian and it seemed to him that one might as well look to the liberalism and egalitarian outlook of modern caste Hindus than to the church. But, fundamental transformations in pariah's life and consciousness had been effected by the coming of colonial rule and western learning and Ayothidas, like other panchama intellectuals, was acutely aware of these transformations and their far-reach- ing implications. In the context of the work- ing out of a perverse historical logic inaugu- rated by colonialism he and others like him stood steadfast on the side of the British. But what distinguishes Ayothidas from his contemporaries and marks him out as an intellectual figure of great originality was his appropriation and use of Buddhism in the context of 19th century colonial caste society. Buddhism was not a living tradition in the Tamil country during his times and, as we have seen earlier, Ayothidas donned the Buddhist faith only after his visit to Sri Lanka. Ayothidas' own intellectual roots lay in the ancient Tamil system of Siddha medicine and to this faith of healing he brought an adequate worldview as repre- sented in the Buddhist faith. Ilis thought was pervaded by a critical sensibility that derived as much from a hermetic healing system, conventionally practised and trans- mitted through the iconoclastic and radical Siddhars as it did from the strengths of Buddhist philosophy. Ayothidas' works also reflect their author's familiarity with con- temporary debates in history and religion as well as with the rejuvenated Tamil learning of the late 19th century. His works may be considered as falling into two parts; though it must be said here that this division is of a purely heuristic value, for the actual texts are sustained by a singular ethos or informing principle. Ayothidas sought to produce, on the one hand, a genealogy of brahminism, as a po- litical, religiousand social philosophy; while on the other hand he attempted to construct an alternative intellectual and spiritual tra- dition and one rooted in the life and histori- cal experiences of Hindus. This latter he located in Buddhism, but a Buddhism that he endowed with a new historical and social significance. Ayothidas relies on literary texts to corroborate his ideas and his writ- ings are often an exercise in hermeneutics. We shall consider here his understanding of brahminism and some of those hermeneutical re-readings that he articu- lated with great sophistication. GENEALOGY OF BRAHMINISM Ayothidas' ideas and views were system- atically argued out in a weekly that he launched in 1907. This weekly was called Oru Paisa Tamizhan (One Paise Tamilian) and its first issue was brought out on June 19, 1907. A year later the prefix 'one paisa' was dropped at the request of the readers. AfterAyothidas' death, hisson Pattabiraman took charge of the weekly from November 17, 1914 and continued until August 26, 1915. Later it was edited and published by G Appaduraiar, a discipleofAyothidasand an early self-respecter from Kolar Gold Fields (from July 7, 1926 to June 27, 1934). The weekly was read by Tamilianseverywhere- in those parts of India where ?(amilians had migrated, in Burma, South Africa. Tamizhan and several tracts which expounded Ayothidas' opinions constitute the archive, from where one may gl'an information re- garding his chief concems and theories. Tamizhant serialised a tract (Poorva Tamizhholi) that wassubsequentlypublished as a book in 1912. The trbict contains an argument that underwrites all of Ayothidas' major observations on history, religious life and cultural development in the sub-conti- nent. Hlere, hc argues that the pariahs were, in fact, the original Tamils whose religion was Buddhism. Pariahs were degraded and theirreligion systematicallydestroyed when Aryan invaders from the north (Ayothidas refers to them elsewhere as Arya 'mlechchas') imposed their rule and culture on these original Tamils. As farasAyothidas was concerned historical development in the Tamil country (and the subcontinent, as a whole) followed a pattern in which was visiblc the steady and gradual decline of Buddhism and the way of life it enjoined and their substitution, through the use of decep- tion and cunning, by brahminical h1induism. This Hlinduism had been imposed on Bud- Economic and Political Weeklv September 25. 1993</page><page sequence="3">dhist-pariahsby thoseAryan mlechchaswho attempted to arrogate to themselves the power of a class of wise men who were in fact the traditional custodians of ethical normsand valuesin pre-Aryansociety. These wise men had renounced the world and its 'joya' and had dedicated themselves to the education of their people in morality and ethics. Ayothidas characterised these men as yatnartha brahmanas-the real brahmanas-and noted that they were of Buddhist faith and were the original, au- thentic and genuine 'gurus' whose fame, learning and wisdom had been (mis)appropriated by Aryan mlechchas or Persians. These latter were thus veritable false prophets or as Ayothidas put it 'vesha brahmanas' (pseudo-brahmanas). In a tract titled 'Indirar Desa Charitiram' (History of Indirar Desam) Ayothidas de- clared that the subcontinent was, in the past, known as 'Indirar Desam', or the land of Indirar. Indirar was none other than the Buddha who had managed tocontrol his five senses('Indiriyams')successfully. The term 'India' to Ayothidas, derived from the ear- lier 'Indirar'. Likewise, Bharat was but a transmuted form of the word 'Varatha', one of the names by which the Buddha is known, Ayothidas held that it was the vesha brahmanas who had coined the word 'Hindu' and made it acceptable to even Mohammed- ans and Europeans, ensuring thereby its permanence as a term of reference. flow did the vesha brahmanas succeed in their endeavours? Ayothidas contended that they practised a fine art of deception and cunningness on the natives of I ndirar Desam and, having succeeded in their initial at- tempts to acquire power and glory, sought to perpetuate these by falsifying texts, re-writ- ing them in some instahces and Hinduising Buddhist works. Thus, "In order to acquire those honours and respect which accrued only to our spiritual teachers (the yathartha brahmanas), they (the vesha brahmanas) approaced the illiterate chieftains and citi- zens (of Indirar Desam) and claimed falsely that they were also 'arhats'; besides they also sent,their women to the kings, dis- tracted them into debauchery and thus cor- rupted them. They did all they could to pass themselves off as (yathartha) brahmanas, worthy of worship by all. Those who fell prey to the sophistry of the vesha brahmanas became Hindus. Those who rejected them were the Buddhists. The Buddhist scholars were then degraded and came to be known as pariahs." Ayothidas also argued that the so-called 'Vedic culture' and 'the pride of Indian civilisation' were nothing but the constructs of western Orientalists. lie observed that neither the Shankaracharya nor Ramanuja or Madhvacharya had worked to bring to- gether the four Vedas into a cohesive and unified text. When the British came into India, the (vesha) brahmanasdeclared them- selves tobe the highest caste, whereupon the English asked them for their religious texts. The brahmanas then sought to put together a religiousbookof the Hindus from avariety of texts espousing mutually contradictory ideas. Ayothidas pointed out that, after all, for the past several hundreds of years the vesha brahmanas had worked to erase the distinction between Buddhist texts and their own. For instance had they not succeeded in modifying and adopting as their own the Upanishads that were originally Buddhist creations? Therefore when the British asked to see their definitive religious text, "the vesha brahmanas appropriated some of the Buddhist historical and moral textsand added these to the incomplete translation of the Vedic myths done by the Zoroastrian Dara Shikoh. These were then presented to Colo- nel Bolier, Sir Robert Chambers, General Martin, Sir WilliamJonesand MrColebrook who, in turn, translated these manuscripts and brought them together into a single large work which, when published, became a book that could be claimed by the Hindus as their Veda. It is this textual rubbish that passes for the Hindu religious texts today". Ayothidas was extremely critical of Max Mueller's attempt toconflate Buddhist texts with the creations of the vesha brahmanas and of his granting precedence and impor- tance to the latter: "Max Mueller has failed to situate and judge the language that ex- isted in Buddha's time, his message, the languages that were refined by Buddha and the Upanishads of the Buddhist sangams in the context of their respective time frames. Thus he does not know which came first- the Upanishads that have reached his hands or Buddha Dhamma. Ile has expressed opi n- ions that are baseless. Are we to devalue the histories, evidence of copper plates and inscriptions on the basis of one man's opin- ion? Certainly not." Ayothidas' critical strategies reveal him to be working on several issues simulta- neously. On the one hand he re-interprets the historical defeat of Buddhism in India at the hands of brahminical Hinduism to sig- nify the corruption of an ethical and spiri- tual tradition that was inherently egalitarian and rational. On the other hand he locates this fact of a corruption in the systematic marginalisation and degradation of a sec- tion of society that ostensibly refused to be lured by the new faith;.that is, he identified the 'downfall' of the pariahs with the tri- umph of brahminism and the caste order. The brahminical victory was not merely a political act with far-reaching social impli-. cations but it also represented a semiotic conquest. As Ayothidas never tired of point- ingout, the slavery and degradation towhich the pariahs were submitted were facilitated in and through the skilful and treacherous deployment of language and meaning by the vesha brahmanas. In a series of remarkable tracts, Ayothidas established the details of thissemioticconquest. Heanalysed 'pumanic' and literary texts to demonstrate the various hermeneutic and textual tactics utilised by the vesha brahmrinas to reiterate the fact of pariah lowness. In Ayothidas' view, the late medieval text, Arichandra Puranan, based on the puranic tale of Harishchandra, narrated the tale of a king who was prepared to go to any extreme to please the brahmins and will- ingly accept self-humiliation. He pointed out several contradictions in Arichandra's behaviour, as described in the text and ar- gued that these instances prove that the hero had, in fact, lied on several occasions. Ayothidas indicated that Arichandra refused to part with his 'victory umbrella' to the two pariah-girls who had been created from the breath of the sage Vishwamitra and sent by him to please the king. The girls on the instructions of their begetter had asked for the umbrella and when refused had pleaded that the king take them as his consorts but he had angrily denounced their aspirations, noting, meanwhile, that they were lowly pariah women. When the sage came to intercede on their behalf the king had noted that the laws that govern kingship forbid the king from marrying a low-caste woman; whereupon the sage revealed their true par- entage and theking, known for his truthful- ness, confessed he had not known of this- which Ayothidas establishes to be a lie, for the girls had introduced themselves as the daughters of Viswamitra. Arichandra, to compensate for, his earlier lapse, now of- fered his kingdom to the sage who took his word to mean a promise and strove to accept the same. Thus Arichandra who had refused a gift of his umbrella to the pariah women came to willingly part with his kingdom and, eventually, his wife, all at the behest of a wily brahman who, in his turn was merely 'testing' his virtue. To Ayothidas this was further proof of the characteristic deception of the vesha brahmanas who thus concealed their true motives and intentions and came to a disrupt and re-order the lives of the credulous. To demonstrate a further instance of brahmana deception, Ayothidas said that Veerabahu, described in the purana as a pariah who cremates dead bodies, was actu- ally a king belonging to the Chakya dynasty and an ancestor of Buddha. The vesha brahmanas who subjugated the people of Indirar Desam had, thus, deliberately dis- torted the facts and portrayed this king as a lowly pulaya of the cremation grounds. If, in his re-reading of Arichlandra Puranam Ayothidas attempteq to demon- strate the deliberate denigratiorl of pariahs and the inferior status and role assigned to them in the narrative, in another thought- provoking tract, The Inquiry of the Skull- Bearer's Story, he showed the wilful Economic and Political Weekly September 25, 1993</page><page sequence="4">Hinduising of an original Buddhist practice and creed. Quoting from ancient and medi- eval literary texts, he argued that the present- day Mylapore in Madras was once the home of valluvans (chakyars) who\were not Hin- dus and were, in all probability, Buddhists. The existing Saivite mutt in Mylapore, ob- served Ayothidas, was, once, the abode of the valluvans and had contained in it a reclinitig statue (the Buddha is usually portrayed in a reclining posture). Further, the Shivarathri festival that is being celebratedin the templeand mutt atMylapore (as at all Saiva temples and places of wor- ship) was actually meant to consecrate the day of Siddharta's renunciation of his princely life and his leaving home, bowl in hand (for alms) as a day of rememberance. The Tamil word for the begging bowl, noted Ayothidas, is 'karabol' which later became twisted into 'kabbalam' (meaning 'skill') by the Saivites. Thus Karaboleeswaran (the lord withbeggingbowl in his hands, in other words, Buddha) became Kabaleeswaran (lord with skull in hand). Accompanying this change in name was a changed narrative as well. Now, the vesha brahmanas, the Saivites, in this instance, conceived of the myth of Siva removing one of the five heads of Brahma at the instigation of Parvathi; the detached head stuck onto Siva's hand and he, therefore, came to be known as Kabaleeswaran. In yet another version of the myth, Brahma was beheaded for having had sexual intercourse with his own daugh- ter and the severed head got stuck on Siva's hand. To Ayothidas these myths constituted enough proof of the folly and falsehood of the religion brought in by the vesha brahmanas. More importantly they also served to identify, by contrast, the signifi- cance attributed to the begging bowl in the lord's hand in Buddhism. Whereas Bud- dhism had sought to remember a noble and rational deed through the image of Buddha with the begging bowl in his hand, brahminical Hinduism had only served to vulgarise and erase the immense impor- tance of the Buddha's message and had replaced the original tale with a totally implausible and irrational patchworkof fan- ciful stories. Now Shivarathri was celebrated by the fai thful goi ng to the cremati on grounds the morning after keeping vigil for Siva the previous night and performing meaningless ntuals and the Buddha's day of renunciation had all but been forgotten. Ayothidas' most felicitous re-reading of texts and history was undertaken with re- gard to a text that has remained the most contested, desired and revered of all Tamil ancient and modem texts. The Tlhirukkural, a compendium of knowledge, morality, po- Jitical wisdom and romantic love as well of social conduct has, to this day, remained a sort of touchstone of 'Tlami lnevss', a honoured instance of the civilisational and cultural achievements of the Tamils. Ayothidascon- sidered this text as Buddhist in inspiration and observed that its author was a Buddhist. He also said that the text adhered to the three 'pitakas' taught by Buddha-the 'Dhamma pitaka', 'Sutra pitaka' and 'Vinaya pitaka'. The text was originally known as Tirikurql (tiri =three) and was the first Buddhist text in a Dravidian language. It was because the Tirikural was such an important text and an obviously Buddhist one that several myths had grown around it, said Ayothidas. For instance, Thiruvalluvar's parentage had in- voked a lot of interest, and as Ayothidas argued in his tract entitled The History of Thiruvalluvar, become an important means to confirm or reject the validity of his work. According to Ayothidas, the popular myth regardingThiruvalluvar'sbirththatdescribes him to be the child of a brahmin father and a pariah mother was a 19th century interpo- lation of partisan brahmin and caste Hindu scholars, who had come to deploy it to their own advantage. The myth was nothing but an attempt on the part of these scholars to allude the fact of Thiruvalluvar's valluvan origins and deny and mask his Buddhist sensibility. Ayothidas saw this myth as yet another illustration of vesha brahmana guile and cunning. He noted that when the British came to India, brahmin scholars who served as native instructors had sought to habitu- ally degrade pariahs in their masters' eyes and succeeded in depicting them as despi- cable and obnoxious. This, to Ayothidas, was in keeping with the historical practice of brahmins that had always characterised Buddhists and their spiritual leaders as pari- ahs. Thus, while the brahmins were careful in insisting that they were, in fact, a homo- geneous community they had come to iden- tify at least 13 sub-sects amongst the pari- ahs. IThey did not want to appear as if they, the brahmins, were split into a 'hundred and eight' groups since they claimed a singular descent from Brahma's head! It is small wonder then that they felt impelled to recre- ate the details of Thiruvalluvar's parentage, for they had to now account for the fact of a lowly valluvan's genius and wisdonm, with- out at the same time detaching him com- pletely from his 'origins'. Hence, the story of a birth through miscegenation. Ayothidas narrates the sequence of events that lead to the interpolations concerning Thiruvalluvar's birth: In 1825, Ellis, a Brit- ish civil servant set up a Tamil sangam in Madras and asked Tamil enthusiasts to bring to him ancient Tamil manuscripts for publi- cation. Manuscripts of Thtirukkural, Thiriwalluvar Malai (a hagiography of Thiruvalluvar and his work) and Naladi Nantnlurru were brought to Ellis by one Kandappan, a-butler in the service of an- other Englishman, George I Iarnington. Ellis published the manuscripts with the help of his manager Muthusamy Pillai and a Tamil scholar Tandavaraya Mudaliar. Ayothidas noted, in this context, that he had learnt from the magazine Suryodaya that Kandappan had complained to Ellis that four new verses had been added to the original version of Thiruvalluvar Malai. But neither this edi- tion which was published by Ellis in 1831 nor a 1834 edition mentioned Thiruvalluvar's parentage or referred to his being born to a brahmin father and a pariah mother. But, interpolations were found in later texts, especially ina 1835 edition of Thiruvalluvar Malai brought out by Vishaka Perumal Iyer and in a 1837 edition brought out by his younger brother Saravana Perumal Iyer. To Ayothidas, this discrepancy between the 1831 and 1834 texts on the one hand and the 1835 and 1837 texts seemed significant and even deliberate. He declared that the pub- lishing of the Thiruklural (by Ellis) must have made evident to the vesha brahmanas the existence of an ethical text of a very high order and one written by a valluvan, a mem- ber of the despi sed vall uvan caste (val l uvans were a sub-sect of the pariahs). Whereupon the brahmanas must have felt the need to reconcile their claims regarding the low and degraded status of the pariahs and valluvans with this newly discovered proof of their intellectual strengthsand achievement. Thus, concluded Ayothidas, they came to con- struct a new genealogy for Thiruvalluvar and began to circulate stories that said he was, originally, of a noble birth. Different versions of these stories seem to have been in vogue and in the 1847 edition of these texts by one M'uthuveerapillai and Vedagiri Mudaliar, we find that Thiruvalluvar's birth is being linked to puranic myths. To Ayothidas, the presence of these often ab- surd and mutually inconsistent stories indi- cated that they had all been conjured up with the avowed aim of alluding the Buddhist origins of Thiruvalluvar and with the inten- tion of co-opting him and his work into the brahminical Hindu value system. AN ALTERNATIVE WORLDVIEW What is important to note of Ayothidas' re-readings of history and literature is that they reflect a concern and anxiety over the semantic import of the term 'pariah'. Ayothidas' own research had convinced him that the present-day pariahs were the original inhabitants of this land whose religion had been the compassionate, ratio- nal and egalitarian creed of the Buddha. The historical defeat of Buddhism (and the conquest of the Buddhist faithful) had cre- ated the society of the pariahs. The venom and distaste with which the word was used in caste Hindu society and its various conno- tationsand denotationsseemed toAyothidas important aspects of a rhetorical and politi- cal strategy that had been in historical use for the sole purpose of keep)ing the formcr Economic and Political Weekly September 25, 1993</page><page sequence="5">Buddhists down and unaware of their glori- ouspast and heritage. For his part, Ayothidas sought to de-construct the.term and locate it in a history of brahminical domination. By doingsohe notonly provided anWideological understanding of the pariah's condition but alsocame toevolve an alternative worldview for the pariahs of the future and one that would link them to a forgotten past. It was for this reason that he discarded both Chris- tianity and Islam as inadequate contexts for the pariah to realise her/his subjectivity. For these religions were, after all, 'alien' and, while they would help the pariah to get out of the clutches of brahminism would leave them with very little else toconfront the fact of brahmin hegemony in the sphere of poli- tics and ideas; since the converted pariahs would always remain marginal to develop- ments in Hindu society as a whole. But if they could be shown to exist in a contradic- tory and antagonistic relationship to brahminical Hinduism, if they could be endowed with a history of which they were coiTce the agents they would, in time, evolve into a position of strength to combat the wiles of a corrupt priesthood. It was because Ayothidas did not desire to see pariahs co- opted into Hinduism that he strongly op- posed the social reform along national lines. He said: "Not content with characterising us as pariahs, they proclaim that they are going toreform the depressed classes. When asked who the depressed classes are, they say, the pariahs and chandalas". As far as Ayothidas was concerned this shift in terms of reference from 'pariah' to 'depressed classes' was indicative of rank hypocrisy on the part of the nationalist reformers. For one thing this change in name was only the continuation of the old brahmin practice of referring to Buddhists as pariahs (thereby refusing to acknowledge their Buddhist origins) in another form. The new term did not explain or refer to the pariah in his/her historical context and only served to reify their lowly status. Besides, even as they resorted to the use of the euphemistic term, the nationalist reformers sought to retain their old biases through other nmeans. They introduced the new prac- tice of putting up signboards inscribed with words such as 'Paracheri Street', thus ghettoising the pariahs' existence. The question arises, how did Ayothidas envisage the political and social liberation of the pariah? We had earlier referred to the demands of the Dravida Mahajana Sangam founded by him. His political principles were in keeping with the nature of the de- mands outlined in that charter. That is, he did not desire to confront with and replace the British raj with a native government for reasonswe have noted earlier. Like the non- brahmin/Dravidian ideologues he saw in brahmin power and hegemony a greater threat to the well-being of a majority of citizens in caste Hindu society than in the colonial presence. He was even willing to close ranks and work with non-brahmin Hindus-the sudras-against brahminism, though he never desisted from criticising caste Ilindus for their anti-pariah preju- dices. Unlike that other great pariah leader and activist, Rettamalai Srinivasan (who happened to be his brother-in-law), he did not wish to remain within the Hindu fold even if this meant losing privileges and concessions granted to pariahs by the gov- ernment. To him the future of the pariahs could not be resolved or even imagined without constructing a past that would ex- plain and condemn Hinduism. In this sense he may be said to have anticipated Ambedkar. Ayothidas left behind him a legacy of learning and a tradition of critical-political hermeneutics that was put to good use by those who came after him. This legacy and tradition proved inspiring to not only other panchama intellectuals but also to the self- respecters. The Sri Siddhartha Puthagasalai (Sri Siddhartha Publishing House) that his followers founded, continued to publish in- teresting and important tracts even after his death and in the 1930s published the writ- ings of the self-respecters. Now it remains to be seen how the legacy of Ayothidas was nurtured by his followers. OrHER PANCHAMA INTELLECrUALS We had mentioned earlier that there was no living Buddhist tradition in the Tamil country at the turn of the previous century and that Ayothidas constructed and acti- vated a Buddhist worldview. However we wish to point out here that he was not the only one todoso. Therewere other panchama intellectuals who also used Buddhism as a normative creed, against which the histori- cal as well as the spiritual deceptions of brahminical Hinduism could be measured. A tract titled 'The Example of tihe Caste Differentce' was published by the Sri Siddhartha Puthagasalai in 1929. This was obviously a later edition of a late 19th century text, as its content indicates. Its author was one M Masilamani who, like Ayothidas, seemed to have been a versatile and creative man of learning. This tract (unfortunately we have not been able to lay our hands on any of his other works) antici- pates not only the principal arguments of Ayothidas, who wrote most of his theoreti- cal and critical works in the first decade of our century, but also bears a remarkable resemblance to some of the ideas and opin- ions of E V Ramasamy Periyar. A short description of its contents seems, therefore, in order. This tract attempted to uncover the basis fordifference and hierarchy within the Hindu caste order. Its chief purpose, not surpris- ingly, was to establish the inconsistencies and contradictions that underpin the brahminical view of caste. Masi lamani was extremely familiar with current theories of race, history and society. I-le argued with great skill, utilising Max Mueller's theo- retical schema of historical development in the Indian sub-continent, that the brahmins were foreign invaders who imposed on a civilisation of great antiquity. This ancient civilisation, he observed, was pacific in character, eschewed vio- lence, abstained from the taking of alcohol and followed the creed of the Buddha. Pre- Aryan culture and society in India were also well-advanced in such fields as architec- ture, metal work and art. These former and glorious achievements had, however, been systematically denigrated, marginalised or simply appropriated by brahmin-Aryans, whom, Masilamani wrote, had never a good word to say about any faith but their own. However, pre-Aryan civilisational forms and identity, he insisted, may still be found in those human creations that sought to express a mortal person's needs and aspira- tions, pre-Aryan peoples had, thus, left be- hind traces of their existence in formal artisticcreationssuch as statues; in symbols such as the lingam; and in the orthographic evidence of the 'sasanas'. But Masilamani wasnotoverly sanguine about thisdarkened past. He pointed out that no sooner had the Aryan-brahmins established their domi- nance by conspiring against pre-Aryan kshatriyas and deceiving them, they came to erase the history of the conquered. They wrote their own histories, in the form of implausible and,fanciful tales and inscribed themselves into these texts of their own creation; so that all history seemed to exist only to gratify them and confirm them in their dominance. Masilamani also wrote of how brahmins came to reign supreme. First, they cheated and co-opted the rulers of the land and, secondly, they made themselves indispens- able not only as ministers and guides to political action, but also as astrologers, soothsayers medicine men and law-givers. Further, they made sure that the benevolent rulers of pre-Aryan times such as Hiraniya and Ravana were remembered not as good and selfless kings but as monstrous, anti- brahminical fiends. Masilamani recalled, in this context, the tale of Parashurama and noted that Parashurama's triumph signified the symbolic victory of the Aryan-brahmins over the native rulers, some of whom had remained firm in their resistance to them. Masilamani was careful in pointing out that the brahmin did not triumph by force and guile alone, but also by employing tactics of persuasion and co-option. Thus the four- fold division of castes was instituted with strict ordinances governing conduct, labour and even interaction amongst and between discrete caste groups. All castes, however, Economic and Political Weekly September 25, 1993 2095</page><page sequence="6">were to defer to the brahmin and fulfil his needs and consider such a task the highest virtue they could aspire towards. In other words, they were to willingly accept their lowly status and affirm the brahmin's supe- riority. It is interesting that Masilamani considers the effects of.brahmin dominance in terms of its materiality. For instance, he argued that as a mark of deference, castes such as the vaishyas and sudras dtade over their best grown grain, usually paddy and wheat, to the brahmins while they remained content with cereals such as jowar and mil- let. The brahmin thus ate the most nutritious food while other castes had to make do with lesser grains. What we have here is an attempt to explain poverty and lack of good food in terms of a power structure that was not interested merely in material wealth but required and asked for ritual homage and exclusive honours. Masilamani saw this mode of domination and control as perverse and claimed that it was in direct contrast to the pre-Aryan times when each person was as respected as the other and where all religions co-existed peacefuUy. Masilamapi found the four-fold division of castes arbitrary and unjust. He ought to criticisecaste using rational criteria. He said that elsewhere in the world a division of labour does not necessarily congeal into a stratified system, involving differences in the status and power of its various constitu- ents. He found brahmin assertions of their essential difference and inherent purity in- consistent and hypocritical. He argued that men such as Vyasa and Vishwamitra, re- vered as the greatest as sages, had not been born into brahminhood but had attained it through their deeds. But there were count- less others-such as Vamadeva who ate the carcassofa dog-who-not only flouted their own rules of purity and difference, but in- sisted that such a violation of codes did not affect their brahmanic status. Masilamani 's question was simply this? If non-brahmins could grow into brahminhood through good deeds, dobrahminsgrowout ofbrahminhood because of their transgressions? This ques- tion was a rhetorical one and by asking it Masilamani was only pointing out the ut- terly arbitrary manner in which certain quali - ties had been classified as lrahminical while certain others, such as the eating of meat and drinking wine, were considered quintessentially sudra qualities. Masilamani tested the creed of brahmin purity and difference by systematically in- terrogating the so-called brahminical vir- tues. l-ie observed that brahmins claimed they were pacific in nature and abhorred injury to any living creature and did not eat meat. But, asked Masilamani, they do not hesitate to subdue and chasten animals for dlomestic use. Brahmins were wont to argue that they attained brahminhood through a rite of passage deemed essential for them: the 'upanayanam' ceremony where the brahmin boy is invested with the sacred thread. The wearing of the thread was an act' that facilitated their passage from sudrahood to brahmin status. Masilamani considered this passage into superiority to be somewhat like a grafting operation wherein part of a plant is grafted on to another so that it would bear luscious fruit. But he was not con- vinced of its efficacy, for as he rightly asked, the graft does not workwith kamalas, chettys and valluvans, all of whom wear the thread but are never considered as pure as brahmins. Neither was Masilamani con- vinced of the brahmin's conventional de- fence of the superior status, that he was deemed superior because he was learned. Masilamani wondered how such a claim may be held in these modern times when, not only pariahs, but also white men have access to and have, in many instances, stud- ied the sacred texts. Masilamani did not believe, as was argued in some quarters, that brahminexclusivitywasperpetuated through the following of different habits of eating. Brahmins might claim their food was pure and clean, but had not the food been origi- nally produced and processed by the sudra and pariah? Brahmins might argue that they were a fair-skinned race different from their dark-skinned brethren, but itis the case that Dravidian brahmins are dark-skinned as well! Masilamani found it absurd that in spite of the contradictions between precept and practice, differences between brahmins and others should be made the basis of brahmin privilege. Brahmins are not differ- ent from other men in respect of their mortal and human needs. They were subject to the same fears, expectations and travails of the flesh and spirit as others, were subject to the universal process of birth, growth and de- cay. Their conduct was also unexceptional and, in fact, their history of deception stood testimony to their characteristic falsehood. Masilamani was scathingly critical of the argument that a 'sacred birth' was the basis of the brahmin's superior status. He won- dered whether the birth of a brahmin child was any less painful and traumatic to the woman on account of the child being a sacred creature. If brahmins were, indeed, sacred noted Masilamani, then why is that the brahmin widow undergoes untold suf- fering? Besides, are they spared all those travails their sex is routinely subjected to? Il-aving thus demolished brahmin claims to high ritual status, Masilamani went on to probe into the dynamics of the purity/pollu- tion idea. Brahmins, he said, do not mind standing with sudras and others at a ticket counter in a railway station to obtain their tickets, but are-averse to sharing the same carriage space with them. Likewise they did not mind working in a hospital run by mis- sionaries where they have to work with and touch pariahs for i t broughlt them money and fame. However, if the pariah so much dares to offer a glass of water to the brahmin outside of the hospital premises the brahmin perceives himself defiled. Masilamani con- sidered these and other such instances of flexible orthodoxy hypocritical and noted ironically that brahmins 'fix' the quantum of purity that may be considered to reside in an object on the basis of their own needs. Thus a mud pot is seen as being rendered unclean by the mere glance of a sudra is therefore broken as unfit for use. However, copper and silver vessels are not discarded thus, the argument being that vessels of pure metal do not secrete pollution. Gold, in this scheme of things, was a pure metal; so was paper money the equivalent of gold in its form of currency. Masilamani found the effects of a creed or caste on women's I ives most cruel. He noted that the logic of brahminism ordained even brahmin women to be sudras unti l such time as they were given in marriage and their marriage was consummated. Just as now wearing the sacred thread was supposed to produce a brahminisation of the male soul, so was consummation of marriage deemed the sole means through which a woman may loose hersudrahood and become a brahmin. But, pointed out Masilamani, women were not consistently pure like brahmin men. They menstruated and hence became de- filed at least four days a month. Besides, death of a husband effected a loss of brahminhood that could be redeemed only by such mortificatory acts as the shaving of one's head. Masilamani was acutely sensi- tive to the sexual politics of brahminism and wrote movingly about the wretched exist- ence of the Hindu widow. He saw the subor- dination of women and the sudras and pari- ahs the real basis of brahmin power and noted that in former times, women were free to even choose their husbands, a practice that the Aryan-brahmins had distorted to their own advantage. It is interesting to note that Masilamani 's views on women are very different from those held by Ayothidas. Ayothidas was convinced that a woman's glory lay in service to her husband and counselled women to be patient and sacri- ficing. Masilamani, on the other hand, saw women as active and desiring subjects who had been wilfully subjugated. Masilamani's opinions of brahmins it ig clear were not very different from Ayothidas'. The latter had noted that brahmins often wrapped them- selves in a 'mantle of jealousy', hid decep- tion in their hearts and spouted 'words as poisonous as poisoned steel' and that their minds were constantly 'fixed towards the disruption of communities'. Masilamani went a step further and exhorted sudras aid panchamas to abjure brahmin priestly ser- vices, renounce brahminical rituals, refuse the lowly aseriptive status granted them by the brahmin and eject from their minds the Economic and Political Weekly September 25. 1993</page><page sequence="7">time-honoured prescriptions of Manu. Like other panchama intellectuals Masilamani was deeply grateful for the white man's presence and he, in fact, saw the coming of the white man, the consolidetion of his power and his aptitude for government as symptomatic of a millennium that would disrupt and ultimately destroy brahmin tyr- anny and usher in a brave new egalitarian age. Ayothidas (and Masilamani before him) inaugurated a critical and polemical tradi- tion of tract-writing that had its adherents wri ti ng wel I i nto the 1930s. Promi nent among them were men such as Maduraiar and Appaduraiar, though the Sri Siddhartha Puthagasalai nurtured many such talents, many of whose works probably are some- where, waiting to be discovered. Maduriar in a tract titled In and OutReligions contin- ued the theme of Buddhist-pariah defeat at the hands of the scheming brahmana. This tract attempted to view the fact of brahmin dominance in the context of a religious history of the peoples of this subcontinent. Maduriar distinguished an 'internal' reli- gious system, comprising all those beliefs and practices that make up popular Hindu- ism, from those external religions, such as Jainism and Buddhism, that relied on hu- man reason and intelligence to comprehend theworld and humanity. Internal religions- Maduriar's concern, here, is only with brahminical Hinduism-are characterised by anthropomorphic features and compel the worship of the five natural elements, birds and animals, allow for the practice of mindless and irrational rituals, encourage superstition and, most importantly, enjoin a constant servility of the faithful before a conspiring, deceiving clergy. Hinduism, argued Maduriar, wasconstituted as a faith presided over by a brahmin priesthood, out of a plethora of practices that were amassed into a whole by a self-serving group of priests. As far as Maduriar was concerned, Ihinduism acquired its powers, chiefly be- cause it instilled in its faithful a fear of god and priest and because it rendered the act of worship passive; whereby the faithful were asked to be patient and parasitic upon the benevolence of deities that were shown to respond favourably to ritual homage and offerings. Thus religious practice became.a matter of giving and taking favours that flowed freely between the god and its worshippers. Maduriar also pointed out that the IIindu faith with its complex of lies, inventions and superstitions, possessed an infinite capacity to expand, absorb and co- opt new faiths and observed that it was not very surprising that Hindus today should proclaim they have no difficulty in accept- ing the teachings of Christianity and Islam. Madluniar drew a contrast between this 'internal' religion and those 'external' faiths-Jainism and B3uddhismboth of which he said were based on rational ideals of behaviour and conduct and which relied on the comprehensive powers of the human intellect toacquire true knowledgeand spiri- tuality. When these faiths had ruled over the land, people had lived in unity, eschewed differences and tolerated various ideas and opinions. Then, society was not divided into castes and men and women were known by the professions and occupations they fol- lowed, but such differences in occupation were not made the basis for a social and ritual difference in status, amongst various groups of people. Maduriar was convinced that these rational and egalitarian religious systems had been systematically destroyed by brahmins who came to view their reli- gion with its reliance on custom and precept as an 'internal' religion and all tho'se that opposed the brahminical faith as 'external' religions. Those that refused to give up on their 'external' faith came to be denigrated and marginalised as pariahs, while those that sought refuge in the 'internal' faith of the conquerors, thinking they could somehow redeem it from within, were classified as sudras. Elaborate rules were devised so as to preserve brahmin exclusivity and children born of brahmins and men (or women) from other castes were deemed to be sudras (if the mother was from a low caste), pariahs (i f the mother was a pariah woman) and chandalas (if the father was a sudra). Maduriar also argued, in a vein reminis- cent of Ayothidas, that the'adherents of the 'internal' religion appropriated and, some- what reluctantly, sanctified the spiritual teachers and prophets of the external reli- gions, such as Avvaiar and Thiruvalluvar, both of whom, it was claimed, were born of brahmin fathers. Maduriar further noted that with the triumph of the internal reli- gions, the occupational categories that had obtained during the time of the external religions were ossified into categories of caste. This caste classification was ex- tended to the non-human world of animals and birds as well. But, as Maduriar wryly noted, while there were brahmin as well as pariah horses and brahmin as well as pariah eagles, the dog, whether white (like the brahmin) or black (like the dark-skinned pariah) was invariably referred to as a pa- riah! The term pariah was also extended to include all those Buddhist practices and beliefs and also some Jain ones. (Maduriar held that, unlike the Buddhists, Jains had come to, eventually comprise with the ad- herents of the internal religion and had, therefore, managed to survive, unlike the Buddhists who turned away and were, hence, marginalised.) Like Ayothidas, Maduriar was deeply sensitive to the import of the term, 'pariah ' and considered it an instance of linguistic corruption; that is, language itsel fhad been made the basis of a difference and, thus, the pariah was damned to remain tied to his/her lowly status, since language habitually inscribe a circular world of mean- ing around its object. Thus a pariah is a pariah is a pariah... Maduriar analysed the various terms and euphemestic names that had historically been used to refer to the adherents of the external religions. He noted that the cat- egory of pariah w9rshippers known as 'thirukulathars' who were held to be ardent devotees of Vishnu had been created to mask the fact of their forced co-option. Likewise, in the course of their status quarrellswi th kammalas, brahminshadcome to designate the pariahs as part of the right hand group of castes-the 'valangai'-that was opposed to the left hand group castes- 'idangai' which included the kammalas. Pariahs had, thus, been used as pawns in an astute game of absorption, co-option and marginalisation, played to perfection by the brahmins. Maduriar considered this strat- egy of thus isolating and yet marking the pariahs as a special category to be alive and well in modern times and indicated how Gandhi's characterisation of pariahs as 'Harijans' was but a continuation of an old tradition of refusing to acknowledge the distinctive religiousandethical orientation of pariahs, who were the original Buddhists. It must be noted here that Maduriar was extremely critical of Gandhi and considered him a servant of the brahmins. He criticised in the strongest possible terms Gandhi's role in the signing of the infamous Poona pact and pointed out that on several occa- sions Gandhi had avoided coming to terms with the issue 'of pariah identity; which is why he attempted to reconcile the fact of their lowly status with his own belief in the varna system by resorting to neologisms. He said the pariahs were 'avarna Hindus' that they were 'athuvijar' who did not come within the four-fold division of castes and hence had to be dealt with separately. In other words, he refused to accept the fact of their deliberate exclusion by caste fIindu society and did not seek to demonstratc brahmin culpability in this matter. Maduriar, likeMasilamani andAyothidas, was satiric and scornful of brahmin clairms to exclusivity and refused to acknowledge their status as priests of the community. lie declared that, usually as is the practice in Islam, a religious leader or priest partakes of the joys and sorrows of the community and allows the community to share his knowl- edge, sorrow or happiness. Brahmins, how- ever, remained aloof from all other sections of the community and only sought charity from them, which they did not dispense amongst the poor and the needy but kept to themselves. Maduriar was convinced that brahminical cunning knows no bounds and observedl that with the coming of Europe- ans, brahmins had taken to calling them- Economic and Political Weekly September 25, 1993 2097</page><page sequence="8">selves Aryans. Thus they allowed them- selves the option of turning to the whi te man for succour, in the event of Hindus becom- ing unified and discarding differences of caste; at the same time, they maintained their links with Hinduism, for if the white man was to suddenly refuse an Aryan iden- tity, brahmins would have to fall back on their own. Maduriar ended his observations on religious systems in India by noting how, in spite of everything and against all odds, pariahs had attempted to recover and preserve their past learning in the fields of astronomy, medicine and other sciences by publishing longforgotten manuscripts. This, he considered, had been made possible by the efforts of the British to encourage publication of old texts. The British had, thus, served as a catalyst for pariahs to remember their lost intellectual glory. -Maduriar concluded his arguments by ex- horting pariahs to keep the Buddhist faith and follow its rational and egalitarian teach- ings. Buddhism, he wrote, alone possessed the capacity to endlessly correct itself and had, in fact, served as the basis for the modern philosophies of atheism, rational- ism and nihilism. In this sense the pariahs, by adhering to Buddhism, would be carry- ing ahead a historical tradition of dissent. For, had not Buddhism resisted brahminism in the past as well? Apart from such polemical tract-writing, panchama intellectuals also took to writing fictional accounts of presentd-day life, so as to demonstrate the folly, absurdity and downright cruelty of certain social conven- tionsand practices. Nellai Rathinasabapathy wrote an amazing piece of fiction titled The Tears of the Poor that sought to lay bare the horrors of widowhood. Instead of pious moralising, the author, created a piece of fantasy to make his arguments powerful. The tale begins in this mortal world, where a young widow is subjected to all sorts of humiliations and finally dies at the hands of her brother who is aghast that she should break the codes of widowhood by looking out of the window. The author comes to know of her fate and while reflecting on the dead woman's travails, drifts into sleep and dream. Next, we find the author sojourning in a world where women have taken over. In this dream-world, roles are completely reversed, with men suffering all those trials and tribu- lations traditionally reserved for women in our mortal world. The author is horrified to find that a friend from former times isbeing subjected to various kinds of torture, as would bc inflicted on a young widow on earth. lie comes to learn that men, such as his friend who had opposed widow-remar- riage and other schemes for women's wel- fare and progress, were all being similarly harrassed. He also learns that escape from this women's city is impossible, for the place was surrounded by a vast stretch of water that cannot be easily traversed. This stretch of water, he is told, comprises the tears of all those wronged women, espe- cially young widows, and unless the tears dry up there can be no reprieve for men. Even as the author is struck by the poetic justice of all that he had seen, he wakes up. What is remarkable about this tale is its ingenious mingling of moral with fable. Also, the author seeks to arouse the male conscience by appealing to their sense of faimess and justice. His credo is simple: Do unto other$ as you would have others do unto you. There were other such fictional tracts, all of which were written to unmask a social ill, recommend a particular course of reform, expose a certain hypocrisy...Some of the tracts were written during the days of the self-respect movement. Maduriar's study of religions, for instance, explicitly links the creed of self-respect with a Buddhist past. Others, such as Gopal Chetty's History of Adi-Dravidas attempted to disseminate at the popular level theories of panchama ori- gins and proclaim their former glory. In every instance, tract writers sought to com- municate the fact of panchama (though the writers and their imagined community of readerswere all pariahs) dignity and histori- cal worth and almost all of them identified brahmins and brahminism as the arbiters of the caste order and as the cause for the degradation of the panchamas. The sudras are looked upon as kindred castes who had falsely aligned themselveswith brahminical Hinduism and we find Maduriar pleading with his sudra readers that they ought not to treat panchamas in the same manner as the brahmins treated them. Whenever the tract writers referred to current political events they were all invariably critical of Congress nationalism and some like Maduriar and Ayothidas before him sought to make com- 'mon cause w'ith the sudras. It is in this sense that we consider panchamas as a very significant but ne- glected flank of the non-brahmin move- ment. While contradictions between panchamas and sudras arose many times remained a constitutive rather than a disrup- tive feature of non-brahmin politics; at least until the advent of the Gandhian consensus with respect to panchamas. Panchama intel- lectuals also accepted the characterisation of non-brahmins as Dravidians and men like Ayothidas were possessed of a deep and abiding sense of 'Tamilness'.
