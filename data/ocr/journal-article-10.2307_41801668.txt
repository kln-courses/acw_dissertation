<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THEOLOGY AND HISTORIOGRAPHY* by JAMES MOULDER ' History is the most comprehensive horizon of Christian theology ' WOLFHART PANNENBERG ' None of his certainties are worth one strand of a woman's hair. ALBERT CAMUS Amongst other things, Wolfhart Pannenberg's Theology and the Philosophy of Science grapples with some of the problems which arise at the inter-face between contemporary theology and histo- riography.1 Unfortunately, the whole enterprise is so massive that nothing can be gained from a brief summary of the arguments which propel his conviction that historians - and especially the historians of the fate of Israel and the fate of Jesus of Nazareth - are the best handmaidens that a theologian can employ.2 1 there- fore want to approach this thesis from another angle, and with a battery of quotations and insights which I have gathered from the philosophy of history. More specifically, because I do not share Pannenberg's conviction that 'all theological questions and answers are meaningful only within the framework of the history which God has with humanity',3 I want to sandwich three ques- tions which are generated by his work between two theses of my own. And although I suspect that he has used some of the strands in my argument to weave a very different garment, I will make no effort to labour any of the agreements or the disagreements which may exist between us. What I will do instead is to demonstrate that Pannenberg's theological method breeds scepticism about what theologians do, as well as irreverence for the gods. In addition, it suggests that theological questions ought to be explored within a metaphysical, rather than within a historical framework. By and large, therefore, I have assembled a set of denials. But they have been gathered for the sake of an affirmation which I hope to de- fend on another occasion. I All historiography is theory laden This thesis is a historian's version of R.G. Collingwood's more general thesis that 'every question involves a presupposition'.4 This is the text of a paper presented to the Eighth Congress of the Philosophical Society of Southern Africa held at the Rand Afrikaans University, 19-22 January 1981.</page><page sequence="2">2 THEORIA And these theses generate a cluster of problems that are hidden under the blanket phrases 'historical relativism" and 'epistemo- logica! anarchism'.6 This territory is full of interesting conse- quences for theological statements (that is, for statements which are about the gods) and for theologians (that is, for those human beings who are bold enough to talk about the gods). Firstly, if all historiography is theory laden, then theologians confer authority upon theological statements. The antecedent gen- erates this consequence for theologians and for theological statements because all religions, and therefore all statements about the gods, have a history. But if all theological statements have a history, then, amongst other things, a theologian is a his- torian of a religious tradition. And therefore he cannot escape Van Harvey's conclusion:7 The historian confers authority upon a wit- ness. He reserves the right to judge who or what will be called an authority, and he makes this judgement only after he has sub- jected the so-called witness to a rigorous cross examination. ... If the historian permits his authorities to stand uncriticized, he abdi- cates his role as a critical historian. He is no longer a seeker of knowledge but a mediator of past belief ; not a thinker but a trans- mitter of tradition'. In fact, Harvey's distinction between 4 a thinker' and 4 a transmit- ter of tradition' blunts the force of the point he wishes to make; namely, that historians, and therefore theologians, have to shoul- der the responsibility for the statements they make about the gods. And Harvey's distinction blunts this point because even a trans- mitter of tradition values some traditions about the gods more than others. In addition, there are so many traditions about the gods that it is never possible to transmit all of them on any given occasion. And so a transmitter of tradition is in the same boat as a thinker. Both have to decide what they want to say about the gods. And both have to explain why they choose to say one thing about them rather than another. It therefore follows that even the most conservative theologian cannot escape the fact that he, and no- body else, confers authority upon his theological statements. Secondly, if all historiography is theory laden, then all theologi- cal statements which are inspired by a historian's work are always open to debate and to revision. The antecedent generates this con- sequence for these theological statements because of a fundamen- tal presupposition of contemporary historiography; namely, that all our statements about the past, and therefore all our statements about the intervention of the gods in our affairs, must be seen as having only a greater or a lesser degree of probability. Henry Commager has provided us with an excellent account of why statements about the gods which rest on the work of historians are all probability statements and therefore always open to debate and</page><page sequence="3">THEOLOGY AND HISTORIOGRAPHY 3 to revision.8 But his discussion of the limitations within which a historian has to do his work is too long for a summary which is both brief and accurate. And so I will simply repeat one of his questions and one of his quotations. The question is a fundamental one: 'How do we know that what has come down to us is either the most important or the most au- thentic representation of past history?' The quotation comes from Veronica Wedgewood and it both underlines and extends the problem which is encapsulated in Commager's question: The his- torian ought to be the humblest of men; he is faced a dozen times a day with the evidence of his own ignorance; he is perpetually con- fronted with his own humiliating inability to interpret his material correctly; he is, in a sense that no other writer is, in bondage to his material'. Thirdly, if all historiography is theory laden, then a theology which rests on a historian's work cannot tell us what any of the gods are like unless 'the total content of time were spread out be- fore us', and 4 we were able to hold all that infinity of events in our mind'. These quotations and the ones which follow come from C. S. Lewis.9 And they underline two things which a theologian who employs a historian often forgets to do. On the one hand, if we believe that history, or the theology which we believe can be extracted from it, is 'a story written by the finger of Goƒè, then it is important to remember that 'a story is precisely the kind of thing that cannot be understood till you have heard the whole of it'. In other words, a theologian who employs a historian to help him understand the nature of the gods is like someone who is listening to a funny anecdote: 'to have heard all except the last six words in which the point lies, leaves you, as a judge of its comic merits, in the same position as the man who has heard none of it'. On the other hand, if we believe that theology ought to be based on history, then 'we must remind ourselves that the word History has several senses', and that we ought to explain in which of these we have located our convictions about how one discovers what the gods are like. For example, the word History 'may mean the total content of time: past, present, and future. It may mean the content of the past only, but still the total content of the past, the past as it really was in all its teeming riches. Thirdly, it may mean so much of the past as is discoverable from surviving evidence. Fourthly, it may mean so much as has actually been discovered by historians working, so to speak, "at the face", the pioneer historians never heard of by the public, who make the actual discoveries. Fifthly, it may mean that portion, and that version, of the matter so dis- covered which has been worked up by great historical writers. Sixthly, it may mean the vague, composite picture of the past</page><page sequence="4">4 THEORIA which floats, rather hazily, in the mind of the ordinary educated man'. I have quoted Lewis at some length because he has underlined so many of the fundamental problems which arise at the inter-face between contemporary theology and historiography. These prob- lems haunt the kind of theology which Pannenberg has developed and urged us to adopt. And they are so substantial that they breed a very thorough scepticism about the possibility of having a the- ology. At the same time they encourage a great deal of irreverence for the gods. Unfortunately, however, none of the quotations which I have gathered exhaust the questions that are raised by the thesis that all historiography is theory laden. As a matter of fact, I have not even tried to exhaust this thesis. What I have tried to do instead is to demonstrate that it is a very useful springboard from which to explore questions about any theology that claims to rest on the work of historians. But be this as it may. At the moment it is more important to recognise that each of the questions which I am about to explore has some roots in the thesis that all histori- ography is theory laden. II What is the point of the positivist historian's methodology? A positivist historian is usually characterised as someone who re- quires historical explanations to conform to the 'covering law' model of explanation.10 This theory of what counts as an adequate understanding or explanation of an event has generated a great deal of debate. And this has helped to clarify various methodologi- cal problems with which a historian has to grapple. Unfortunately, however, this debate has obscured the point of the positivist his- torian's methodology. More specifically, the debate has concen- trated on the question, What, if anything, is wrong with the 'cover- ing law' model of explanation?, rather than on the more important question, What is the point of the positivist historian's method- ology? On the other hand, if the second of these two questions is allowed to have a fair hearing, then it is possible to draw on Karl Popper's understanding of the difference between dogmatic and critical thinking to illuminate another aspect of the thesis that all historiography is theory laden. According to Popper, dogmatic thinking concentrates on questions about the verification or veri- fiability of a hypothesis or belief. Critical thinking, however, places the emphasis on questions about the falsification or falsifi- ability of a hypothesis or belief. These are, of course, no more than the bare bones of Popper's distinction. But a quotation from his intellectual autobiography adds some flesh to the point I wish</page><page sequence="5">THEOLOGY AND HISTORIOGRAPHY 5 to make. 11 The words are a comment on a lecture which Albert Einstein gave at the University of Vienna: 'What impressed me most was Einstein's own clear statement that he would regard his theory as untenable if it should fail in certain tests . . . Here was an attitude utterly different from the dogmatic attitude of Marx, Freud, Adler, and even more so of their followers. Einstein was looking for crucial experiments whose agreement with his predic- tions would by no means establish his theory; while a disagree- ment, as he was the first to stress, would show his theory to be un- tenable. This, I felt, was the true scientific attitude. It was utterly different from the dogmatic attitude which constantly claimed to find "verifications" for its favourite theories. Thus I arrived, by the end of 1919, at the conclusion that the scientific attitude was the critical attitude, which did not look for verification but for cru- cial tests; tests which could refute the theory tested, though they could never establish it' . What does all this have to do with the relationship between the- ology and historiography? At least two things. Firstly, I have argued that amongst many other things, the- ologians are the historians of a religious tradition because all statements about the gods have a history. But when Popper wrote The Poverty of Historicism he demonstrated the importance of his distinction between dogmatic and critical thinking for the his- torian's work.12 And so it is not unreasonable to believe that his distinction may be important to theologians as well. In other words, if Popper's work is the best clue to the point of the pos- itivist historian's methodology, then, to understate my case, we are a long way from having adequate answers to questions about what theology is and about how theology ought to be done. And we are a long way from these answers because theologians h√°ve not paid enough attention to questions about the falsification or falsifiability of our beliefs about the gods. For example, theologi- cal students are encouraged to collect proofs for, rather than refu- tations of, their beliefs about the gods. Secondly, if Popper's work is the best clue to the difference be- tween dogmatic and critical historiography, then some questions asked by Van Harvey are more important and more challenging than he himself believed.13 Here are the questions: Is Christian faith compatible with a historical scepticism about Jesus? Can one rest his faith on historical assertions which themselves do not seem capable of a high degree of probability? What is the relation be- tween faith and history? What is the believer to do when faced by widespread disagreements among New Testament historians con- cerning what can be known about Jesus? Shall he limit his belief to only those judgements about Jesus which can be said to represent a firm consensus? And what shall he do if any such consensus is</page><page sequence="6">6 THEORIA lacking? Can he pick and choose his favourite historian because this or that one buttresses his faith? And what shall we say of the Christian historian? What should he do when what he believes as a historian seems to conflict with his faith, or, as is more usual, when the probabilities of history do not seem to justify the certitude of faith? Can one and the same man hold the same judgement tenta- tively as a historian but believe it passionately as a Christian? It is, of course, much easier to ask these questions than to answer them. On the other hand, the questions which are gener- ated when one concentrates on the point of the positivist histori- an's methodology are very much more interesting, more signifi- cant and, in the long run, more creative than the questions which are generated by his problematic 'covering law' theory of explan- ation. In fact, questions of the kind I have paraded here are per- haps some of the most fundamental methodological questions which arise at the inter-face between theology and historiography. And if this is so, then questions of this kind ought to be put on the centre of the theologian's stage and not allowed to hang around idly in the wings. Ill Why is it problematic to talk about a god's activity in history? This question does not have a short, straightforward answer. More specifically, all the problems which I have already discussed may be used to provide this question with the comprehensive answer that it deserves. Nevertheless, it may be useful to underline two questions, and comment more briefly on three others, that are generated by anyone who talks about a god's activity in history. How does one discover which god did whatever some god or other is supposed to have done? If one is curious about what the gods are doing or have done, then how does one discover whether a statement about a particular god's activity in history is true or false? How can one discover what a god is like by studying the be- haviour of some human beings ? If we believe that we cannot be controlled by any of the gods, then how can we believe that 'his- tory is a story with a well-defined plot', or that Israel's god is 4 a God who completely controls the world'?14 And why do most theo- logians believe that we can learn more about the gods from dra- matic and catastrophic occurrences than from more modest and mundane events? Firstly, how does one discover which god did whatever some god or other is supposed to have done? This question is generated by any theological statement which declares that some god or other has participated in our affairs. And so we can employ two aspects of the traditional theological</page><page sequence="7">THEOLOGY AND HISTORIOGRAPHY 7 interpretation of the Battle of Blood River to understand why the question needs to be explored. On the one hand, neither the de- fenders nor the critics of the traditional interpretation seem to be aware of the fact that there may be more than one god.15 On the other hand, both the people who made the original vow and the people who comment on what they did proceed on a highly prob- lematic assumption. They assume that because these Voortrekkers thought that they were making a conditional promise to the god described by the Athanasian Creed, that this is in fact the god who heard their promise and who came to their aid. But why ought this assumption to be made or to be granted? More specifically, why ought I not to believe that these Voortrekkers were mistaken and that it was either Ares or Mars who heard their promise and came to their aid?16 These questions may sound facetious. But anyone who is inter- ested in the problems which arise at the inter-face between the- ology and historiography ought to resist the temptation to regard a question of this kind as a facetious or a frivolous one. On the con- trary, unless we know which god did whatever some god or other was supposed to do, we are unable to discover or to decide whether a statement about a god's activity in history is true or false. And so we are unable to do what Karl Popper has urged us to do with our beliefs; namely, to ask ourselves under what con- ditions we would admit that our beliefs are untenable. Secondly, if one is curious about what the gods are doing or have done, then how does one discover whether a statement about a particular god's activity in history is true or false? Once again, discussions about how to interpret the Battle of Blood River can be used to explain why this question must be asked. If someone shares James Dupor≈•s belief that quem Jupiter vult perdere dementai prius ,17 then the following interpretation of the battle is not an unreasonable one: although the Voortrekkers did not know it, Jupiter heard their promise and decided to partici- pate in their affairs. And he decided to help them win the battle because he wanted the descendants of the Zulus to govern this part of the world. More specifically, being wiser than they were, he knew that the Voortrekkers and their descendants would misinter- pret what had happened and that they would allow this victory to feed their nationalism. This is what he wanted; because Jupiter knew that many decades later this nationalism would give birth to Black nationalism and to various Black consciousness movements. And these developments would give birth to a chain of events which would destroy that nationalism which, amongst other things, feeds upon celebrations of the Battle of Blood River. Is Once again, some people may be tempted to regard this inter- pretation of the Battle of Blood River as a poor attempt to be</page><page sequence="8">8 THEORIA funny. But anyone who refuses to take my interpretation seriously owes me an explanation of why he regards it as facetious or frivo- lous. More specifically, I have suggested that quern Jupiter vult perdere dementai prius helps to explain why the Voortrekkers won the Battle of Blood River. But I know that De Zuid-Afrikaan came to a different conclusion; namely, 'that the hand of the Lord is with the Boers and that woe will be upon any man who opposes them'.19 These two interpretations of the battle agree that a god participated in the events of the day and that he was responsible for the Voortrekker's victory. But that is where the agreement ends. One interpretation claims that Jupiter was responsible for the Voortrekker's victory; the other that 'the hand of the Lord' (Yahweh?) was with them. Which of these suggestions is the cor- rect one? Are they perhaps both false? And most important of all: how can one discover whether a statement about a certain goƒès activity in history is true or false? Thirdly, how can one discover what a god is like by studying the behaviour of some human beings ? This question has its roots in a suspicion which can be traced as far back as Xenophanes:20 The Ethiopians say their gods are snub- nosed and black-skinned, the Thracians that they are blue-eyed and red-headeƒè. But the problem is not really that our concep- tions of the gods are anthropomorphic. When all has been said and done about the strengths and the weaknesses of an anthropomor- phic theology, there are at least three questions that remain for a theologian whose understanding of the gods rests on the work of the historian. Why do these theologians believe that the history of the ethnic or socio-economic group to which they belong is the slice of human history which enables us to discover what the gods are like? Because 4 die verlede toon vir ons so ' n verskeidenheid van omstandighede en menselike handelinge dat vir elke les wat ons kan aantoony die teenoorgestelde les ook aangetoon kan word',21 how can theologians hope to glean any reliable knowledge about the nature of the gods by studying what human beings have done and are doing? And, finally, why are so many (Christian) theologians convinced that it is only a theology which appeals to nature, rather than to 'some special decisive events of history', that must charac- terise the gods as 'blessing and harming, ambiguous, capricious'?22 In other words, theologians need to demonstrate, and not simply to assume, that history is a better guide to what the gods are like than, for example, our understanding of metaphysics, of myth- ology, or of nature. Fourthly, if we believe that we cannot be controlled by any of the gods, then how can we believe that 'history is a story with a well-defined plot', or that Israel's god is 'a God who completely controls the world' ?</page><page sequence="9">THEOLOGY AND HISTORIOGRAPHY 9 This question is generated by what some theologians believe about human nature and about history. These beliefs are two sides of the same coin. On the one hand, some theologians share P.S. Dreyer's conviction about what it means to be a human being:23 ' omdat vryheid die wese van die mens is . . . beteken die toekoms vir ons die moontlikheid om gestalte aan ons lewens en leefw√™relde te gee op so ' n wyse dat dit beantwoord aan ons norme van menswaardigheiƒè. On the other hand, and in the light of this so- phisticated admission that we are creatures who cannot be con- trolled by any of the gods, some theologians share Jacques Mari- tain's convictions about history and theology:24 The divine plan is not a scenario prepared in advance, in which free subjects would play parts and act as performers. We must purge our thought of any idea of a play written in advance. On the contrary, everything is improvised'. Both sides of this coin contain accurate reflections of what it means to be a human being. At the same time, however, they undermine the good news that 'history moves towards a cul- mination', and that 'within or beyond time God's will is to be ac- complished and His full sovereignty will be seen to have pre- vailed'.25 And this good news is called into question by an insistence that freedom belongs to the essence of a human being because, if this freedom was abused in the Garden of Eden, then it is impossible to guarantee that it will not be abused in the New Je- rusalem.26 In other words, beings who are free to choose between good and evil are able to astonish the gods as well as themselves! Finally, why do most theologians believe that we can learn more about the gods from dramatic and catastrophic occurrences than from more modest and mundane events? This question was born in a conjunction between something which C.T. Mclntire has observed and something which C.S. Lewis has asked. The introduction to Mclntire's very useful an- thology on history and theology observes that 'the renewal of in- terest in a Christian view of history' owes a great deal to 'the catas- trophes of our age and the search for an alternative view of human nature and human history . . . perhaps the twentieth century with its terrible civilization-wide calamities is not unlike the fifth when Augustine experienced evidence of the fall of Roman civilization and then developed his Christian view of history'.27 These are accu- rate observations. And they create more scepticism about what theology is, and about how it ought to be done, than Mclntire seems to have noticed. But be this as it may. As is so often the case, C.S. Lewis has put his finger on the place that hurts most:28 'Why should Gengis Khan be more important than the patience or despair of some one among his victims? Might not those whom we regard as significant figures - great scholars, soldiers and states- men - turn out to have their chief importance as giving occasion</page><page sequence="10">10 THEORIA to states of soul in individuals whom we have never heard of?' Amongst other things, these questions take us back to the thesis that all historiography is theory laden. More specifically, they underline the fact that a historian is very much like a butcher: the kind of sausages you get depends on the recipe you use! I have, of course, made no attempt to give an exhaustive answer to the questions which I have raised. What I have done instead is to employ a battery of quotations to explain why it is problematic to talk about a goƒès activity in history. The reason for this strategy is straightforward enough. At the moment I want to raise ques- tions rather than to answer them. In addition, I am convinced that these questions cannot be answered until we have a more adequate grasp of what theology is, and how theology ought to be done. I will therefore leave these questions to simmer while I try to explain why it is also dangerous to talk about a god's activity in history. IV Why is it dangerous to talk about a god's activity in history? This question has a short, straightforward answer. Anyone who talks about a god's activity in history is guilty of hybris ; that is, of forgetting that he is neither a god nor a devil but a human being. But why is hybris dangerous? This question does not have an answer which is both short and adequate. And so I will simply comment on two reasons why those who talk about a god's activity in history are playing with fire. Firstly, people who talk about a god's activity in history find it very difficult not to divide human beings into two groups. On the one hand, there are those who are favoured by the god in ques- tion. On the other hand, there are those who have earned his or her displeasure. And so those who talk in this way find it difficult to agree with Terence: ' Homo sum; humani nil a me alienum puto. '2V In fact, those who talk about a god's activity in history do not only find it difficult to count nothing human alien from them. They also find it difficult to 'humbly reckon others better than themselves'.30 For example, Cecil John Rhodes was convinced that 'only one race approached Goƒès ideal type, his own Anglo-Saxon race'. And Joseph Chamberlain believed that Anglo-Saxons are 'infal- libly destined to be the predominant force in the history and civilization of the world'. This kind of madness is infectious; and Afrikaners soon caught the disease. Frans Lion Cachet, for exam- ple, declared that 'Afrikaner Boers are summoned to be the pi- oneers of Christian and civilisation'. And D.F. Malan disputed</page><page sequence="11">THEOLOGY AND HISTORIOGRAPHY '' Rhodes' conviction that God is an Englishman: 'Our history is the highest work of art of the Architect of the centuries'. These are, unfortunately, only four samples from this kind of theological bazaar. But enough is as good as a feast. And, what is more to the point, the words which I have quoted are enough to explain F.A. van Jaarsvelƒès misgivings:" 'One wonders at times whether temporary political goals are projected on to our image of what we imagine Goƒès "calling" and "mission" to be. From the various views I have mentioned, it would seem that there is much confusion. Is there not a danger that a people may become too wrapped up in itself - to the point of self-deification?' Secondly, people who talk about a god's activity in history tend to obscure the fact that 'man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself.12 These words are used by Jean-Paul Sartre to underline the fact that we create the values, and therefore the economic and political structures, which either bless or curse the lives of our fellow human beings:33 'If I regard a certain course of action as good, it is only I who choose to say that it is good and not bad. I shall never find any proof whatever; there will be no sign to convince me of it. If a voice speaks to me, it is still I myself who must decide whether the voice is or is not that of an angel' . Sartre's emphasis on personal decision and responsibility under- mines the fatalism (van Jaarsveld34) and the historicism (Popper35) which seems to accompany talk about a god's activity in history. This fatalism and historicism are dangerous because these states of mind generate a belief in 'the "rhythms" or the "patterns", the "laws" or the "trends" that underline the evolution of history'.36 In addition, and more seriously, these beliefs breed a belief in histori- cal inevitability. They therefore breed either a moral quietism or a moral arrogance which are guided by the conviction that one must help to bring about the inevitable!37 But moral quietism and moral arrogance undermine moral sensitivity. More specifically, the moral offspring of fatalism and historicism undermine the hu- mility, compassion and tolerance which inspired Terence's epi- gram: 4 Homo sum; humani nil a me alienum puto' In addition, the morality of fatalism and historicism are insensitive to all those dimensions of the human condition which convinced Albert Camus that none of the prison chaplain's certainties 'was worth one strand of a woman's hair'.38 V Nobody needs a theology of history I began with the statement that all historiography is theory laden. Amongst other things, I used this statement to draw attention to the point of the positivist historian's methodology and to explain</page><page sequence="12">12 THEORIA why it is both problematic and dangerous to talk about a goƒès ac- tivity in history. Along the way I claimed that the questions I have raised cannot be answered until we have a more adequate grasp of what theology is and how theology ought to be done. At the same time I argued that, amongst other things, a theologian is a his- torian of his religious tradition. I am aware that these are all con- troversial claims. But this is neither the time nor the place to strain out the gnats which swarm around these controversies. What I will do instead is to try to swallow the camel!39 Ben Liebenberg has argued that it is not the historian's task to comment on the involvement of a god in this or that event of the past.40 1 agree. But if a theologian is a historian of his religious tra- dition, then it is not a theologian's task either. In fact, I suspect that, because of the problems which are raised by the enterprise, nobody has the task of talking about the involvement of a god in this or that event of the past. And nobody has this task, because it is unreasonable to expect anybody to do what is impossible. In other words, theologians ought to stop trying to perform the im- possible task of providing us with a theology of history. What they should do instead is to clarify the mythological and metaphysical presuppositions which underlie our basic religious beliefs and to try to help us to understand what our religious tradition requires us todo. In other words and with specific reference to Christian theo- logians: Christians do not have to try to understand what is happen- ing in history. What they have to do is to try to clarify the concepts which are involved in their conviction that Jesus of Nazareth is both truly human and truly divine. In addition, they have to try to make history by obeying his commands and by following his exam- ple. But if this is so, then a Christian theologian's task is to help his fellow believers to discover how they can formulate their basic convictions about Jesus as clearly as possible, and how they can translate his commandments and example into effective words and deeds. This, of course, is easier said than done. But it is this, rather than a theology of history which nobody can obtain and which nobody needs, for which I am groping at the inter-face be- tween contemporary theology and historiography.
