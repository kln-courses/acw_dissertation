Brooks Millikin University SUMMARY Effective hypermedia designs should meet four goals: • Minimize clutter so that the document looks and feels simple to use. • Create an image appropriate to the corporate sponsor and to the users' expectations. • Provide ready access to stored information. • Minimize the effort, technology, and resources needed. Although hypermedia publications have become more commonplace, many fail the technical communicator's basic mission of providing clear, simple, concise assistance to the users of the publication. With additional capabilities such as sound, animation, multiple fonts, extensive graphics, color, and hidden layers of additional information, hypermedia documents have become design nightmares - ugly screens full of multiple fonts, insignificant boxes, irrelevant noises, and confusing webs of possible interactivity. While most computer users have become more sophisticated users of publishing conventions through desktop publishing, hypermedia developers have not kept up. We need to develop adequate design principles to improve the usability of hypermedia. As technical communicators, we struggle to find appropriate ways to design hypermedia documents that will take advantage of multimedia capabilities without losing our focus on user needs. At present we lack established conventions or principles for hypermedia publication design. We must define new principles pr adapt related print-publication conventions for effective hypermedia design. This essay is a discussion of four practical design goals for effective, usable hypermedia design: 1. Simplicity of design elements This article has been peer reviewed. 2. Appropriateness of the document to the organizational sponsor and individual users' needs 3. Function of the hypermedia document as an aid to information access 4. Economy of effort, technological constraints, and financial resources necessary to publish hypermedia documents Nelson (1981) predicted that a merging of media and publication conventions would occur when documents became paperless publications on the computer screen. In his book, Literary Machines , he predicted that hypermedia publications would eventually be linked into a single entity: "Our universe of documents (or docuverse) is potentially very large, and will grow unpredictably" (Chap. 4, p. 11). Nelson's dream of a unified "docuverse" appears to remain in the distant future, but his predictions of the integration of media have become reality. Hypermedia is no longer simply a futuristic idea of a literary dream machine. Hypermedia publications are commonplace in businesses, schools, libraries, and homes. They have become the expected norm for software and hardware documentation, software demonstrations, company employee manuals, multimedia advertising campaigns, library reference systems, large medical databases, store directories, and literary or graphic collections. 422 Technical Communication, Third Quarter 1993</page><page sequence="2">In fact, the innovation of hypermedia has lost its novelty; now we expect hypermedia to not only function but also to be well designed for effective usability. F OUR GOALS OF ONLINE SCREEN DESIGN Hypermedia publications vary widely, from simple online help systems to slick sales demonstrations, so the following unsituated design principles are necessarily general. I have included practical tips, such as the fact that paragraphs of type set smaller than 12 points are very difficult to read on the computer screen, but for the most part this essay remains focused on broad design goals for useful online documents. These basic goals for effective hypermedia design are derived from four common print-media design principles: simplicity, appropriateness, function, and economy. However, each principle is discussed in the context of how it applies to the design of hypermedia documents for the computer screen. Design Goal 1 : Simplicity Simplicity refers to the overall esthetic experience of a hypermedia publication. The esthetic experience of a printed document is primarily visual, but hypermedia documents may include sound, animation, and flashing cursors, as well as more conventional text and graphic elements on the screen. Furthermore, the felt experience of using a hypermedia document certainly varies both within and between linked documents - from the confusing screen with multiple buttons flashing to the automatic progression of screens that force the user to wait passively for something of interest. With all these possible layers of sense perceptions, hypermedia screen designs may intimidate users because of the clutter of information, graphics, flashing cursors, and multiple buttons that probably do something if clicked. Hypermedia publications are inherently complex. To provide the user with multiple means of navigation/and to allow the users to follow their own paths of inquiry, the online document will probably include a density of elements that borders on clutter. Consequently, one of the key goals of hypermedia design is to minimize clutter so that the document appears, feels, and, ideally, is simple to use. Hypermedia Design Tip 1: Keep design elements to a minimum. Use only one or two fonts, use as few navigational controls as necessary, and avoid too many boxes, borders, and decorative graphics. In addition to keeping your design elements to a minimum, you achieve simplicity by establishing a consistent background that is maintained throughout the hypermedia document. This background provides the user with a comfortable mental model for the document as a whole and allows the user to interact by applying familiar processes and strategies. Horton (1990) refers to this as the immediate "transparency" of how to use a particular online document. When expectations match the resulting screens, the user is most effectively concentrating on the hypermedia document rather than trying to figure out how it works. Consistency should be carefully maintained by the deliberate repeated use of major design elements such as typeface, type size, location of particular kinds of information, location of titles and navigational controls, timing of sound effects, and anticipated screen transitions. Mehlmann (1981) recommends a general grid format for online screen design: title near the upper left of the screen, flags or icons for immediate instructions on the left, navigational commands near the bottom, and an escape hatch across the very bottom (Figure 1). This grid format may be a good strategy for many hypermedia documents, but a f Title Area Instruction Area Flag Area Body Area Message Area Command Area Escape Hatch Area y &gt; Figure 1.

Technical Communication, Third Quarter 1993 423</page><page sequence="3">main attraction of hypermedia is the great flexibility authors have in how or where they present information. Instead of attempting to create a single layout standard, as in commercial book design, authors should establish and maintain particular design solutions for specific situations or needs. Users need consistency in order to formulate effective strategies for using an online document, so authors must carefully provide consistent patterns throughout the entire document. Hypermedia Design Tip 2: Repeat the placement and format of major document-wide elements such as headings, text blocks, and navigational controls. By establishing and maintaining repetitious design elements, authors allow the user to pay attention to the changing element on the screen - new information, questions, titles, or illustrations. An author will be able to emphasize key data or significant information better when it is placed in the context of a familiar background. Hypermedia Design Tip 3; Avoid piling up special effects, so that those used will retain their attention- getting function. Simplicity in design lets authors establish design expectations which can be temporarily abandoned in order to focus attention on specific points. For example, designers don't need to use bolding and italics and outdenting to make a title stand out from the body of text. One or maybe two emphatic devices will usually be sufficient. If authors change type styles or type size continually, the reader will not be able to discern connections between similar levels of information. If every screen follows a different design layout, the user will have to go through the orientation process repeatedly, constantly trying to identify and understand how to interact with each screen. Design Goal 2-ê Appropriateness Every hypermedia publication conveys an image of the sponsoring publisher, an attitude toward the user, and an overall impression of its professional or unprofessional design. The choice of graphics, typeface, and screen layout determines the nature of the interaction between the user and the computer. If all screen elements fit the user's expectations as well as the sponsor's desired corporate image, these design choices work together to convey an appropriate interaction. For example, an online database of names and addresses might imitate a rotating file in appearance. It would be appropriate to place alphabetical browsing buttons on the top of individual cards, since that is where they are located on actual files. On the other hand, a spreadsheet of names and addresses might contain the same information, but only an experienced spreadsheet user or the creator of that particular database would find it easy to find desired information. The way the hypermedia publication prompts and responds to the user's actions creates an implied relationship. The user will appreciate the tone of the response if it is viewed as considerate and helpful - or it will be viewed as irritating if it is insulting or condescending. The author should design a hypermedia publication to convey an appropriate image of the organizational sponsor and to create an appropriate atmosphere or document tone for the user's interactions. Hypermedia Design Tip 4: Keep design elements as well as content in an appropriate tone for the sponsoring publisher of the online document. Appropriateness depends on the intended user and the sponsoring publisher. Hypermedia documents are by definition interactive, yet the nature of the interaction depends on the cueing of effective and appropriate user actions. For example, the promotional Ford Simulator II disk created by the Softad Group, a slick hypermedia catalog of Ford vehicles (Figure 2), begins with a zooming, animated Ford logo, followed by an "electronic showroom" of car models and features. Pressing the space bar moves the user from one screen to the next to let the user browse through pictures of various vehicles. Special innovations or new features, such as safety airbags, are shown as animated illustrations with appropriate sound effects. For example, when the "surround sound" stereo system is explained, the accompanying music grows louder and more complex as additional speakers appear within the illustration of the car interior (Figure 3). Overall, the hypermedia document is an electronic combination of sales catalog and simulated showroom. The only inappropriate part of the hypermedia catalog is a failed attempt to simulate the test drive, which is clearly more closely related to a video game than driving a new car. All of the car models "drive" the same way, with jerky mouse movements, and the object of the game is to drive without smashing into objects in the road that users soon discover are much more fun to run over than to miss anyway (Figure 4). I don't think Ford, the sponsoring organization, 424 Technical Communication , Third Quarter 1993</page><page sequence="4">Figure 2. Ford Simulator II is a hypermedia sales catalog.

Not only is the game poor by computer game standards, it is essentially not an appropriate part of Ford's otherwise effective hypermedia catalog. Hypermedia Design Tip 5: Do not simply dump word processing files or screens of spreadsheets online. To do so is the equivalent of taping a sketch to a block of marble and calling it a sculpture.

Appropriateness also addresses the types of information that should be developed into hypermedia publications. Space does not permit a full discussion of this concern here, but in general the most appropriate uses include the following: 1. Timely or evolving documents that require frequent updates 2. Documents that require extensive integration of visual, aural, and textual information 3. Documents that support computer operations. Hypermedia publications that require scrolling through screen after screen of text files are inappropriate uses of the technology. Design Goal 3: Function Function refers to how the hypermedia publication will be used. Hypermedia publications have a wide variety of purposes and uses, but the key design consideration is how to provide access to stored information or multimedia events. Depending on the type of hypermedia publication, the user may want to browse randomly through available screens until something interesting or useful appears, or the user may want to retrieve particular information quickly. Hypermedia Design Tip 6; Provide the user with multiple means of controlling his or her navigation Technical Communication, Third Quarter 1993 425</page><page sequence="5">through the document to encourage more than browsing or watching. Bill Atkinson, one of the key developers of HyperCard , released a stack of clip art to the public domain. Figure 5 is an example. This clip art stack is an example of providing multiple means of access: slow browsing using the arrow buttons, quick scanning using the "see all" button, or a word search approach using HyperCard's built-in "Find" command routine. On the other hand, Aldus Corporation's demonstration tutorial of Persuasion provides only a passive role for the user (Figure 6). Once the hypermedia demonstration has begun, the user can only choose to watch complete episodes of the animated demonstration. Aldus creates a professional image and lively atmosphere with background jazz riffs throughout the tutorial, but it provides only a passive means of interaction for the user. The user can only watch or pause the show, or quit. One of the primary differences between hypermedia publications and software, such as a database application, is that hypermedia publications require neither programming experience nor mastery of extensive software commands in order to begin interacting with available screens. Hypermedia publications are interactive packages of information, created to help users find needed information quickly. The design of a hypermedia publication must provide a transparent means of navigation; otherwise the user will be lost in layers upon layers of instructions. This could be worse than the circular nature of irritating dictionary definitions where synonyms are used to define each other. For the computer novice, most hypermedia publications include instructions on how to interact with the document. Hypermedia Design Tip 7: Provide help explaining or showing how the hypermedia publication functions as soon as the user opens the document, and maintain access to help throughout the user's interaction. Give the user a forecast of how the hypermedia publication interaction will work. The Aldus Persuasion demo, while not allowing much interaction, nevertheless is a good example of providing the user with necessary help before starting the user's interaction. The first screen explains basic control options available to the user, the second screen informs the user how to get to a more detailed presentation of any topic, and the third screen lets the user know how long the demo will last. The goal is to orient and prepare the user Figure 5. Bill Atkinson's Clip Art provides multiple means of navigation. Apple logo used by permission of Apple Computer, Inc. Figure 6.

Design Goal 4: Economy Economy is a design principle for hypermedia publications, because all designs are limited by constraints of time and money available for development and distribution. Technological wild 426 Technical Communication, Third Quarter 1993</page><page sequence="6">A hypermedia junkyard occurs when designers try to dump anything and everything into a single document simply because the capability was there. rabbit chases for the latest multimedia technique, such as video clips, may not be necessary or appropriate for many hypermedia publication designs. Don't let available equipment, technology, or project managers determine the hypermedia design. Too often, project managers will encourage the use of new equipment to justify the purchase of the equipment, but the tools should not determine the design of hypermedia publications. The right tools will certainly help you carry out your design plans, but there will always be trade-offs between ideal designs and the constraints of existing capabilities. Hypermedia Design Tip 8: Don't spend too much time or money creating an online document; you may be wasting time on a document that will be rapidly out of date, or cluttered with special features that may complicate distribution. Horton' s (1990) formula for determining what should go online is based on a consideration of economy: "Put a document online if the value of having the document online exceeds the cost incurred in putting it online" (p. 16). Extensive graphics, audio, and animation are complicated and time consuming to produce. If they are necessary or ideally suited to your hypermedia publication, they are probably worth the time and trouble to include them. However, most hypermedia publications should be kept simple so that they will not be difficult or time consuming to update and maintain. Good design includes consideration of the appropriate level of expenditure for publishing a document as hypermedia. A REVERSE SUMMARY: WHAT GOES WRONG WITH SCREEN DESIGN Because the Capability Was There A hypermedia junkyard occurs when designers try to dump anything and everything into a single document simply because the capability was there. You may have a button which activates Beethoven's ninth symphony, but don't make it sound off every time the user goes to a new screen. In fact, unless your online document is about Beethoven or music, don't include it anywhere. Keep Scrolling- Hypermedia Versions of Paper Documents Information dumped onto the computer screen that requires endless scrolling to locate relevant data is the online equivalent of unparagraphed prose. The user needs access to bits of information, not a new means of scroll-reading. The Babbling Computer Dialog The user needs to notice responses to his or her actions, but they do not need the computer to provide free therapy or babbling about unrequested information. Most computer interfaces and hypermedia publications avoid anthropomorphic interaction with the user, since it is immediately artificial and insulting. In the long term, these human-like simulations are simply too predictable, irritating, and uninteresting. Lost in the Web of Hypertext Some hypermedia documents create so many potential links and connections that the user easily wanders into a maze of screens and information. Too much freedom to create new links, new paths of exploration, and other personalizing elements may render the document useless to anyone except the creator of the hypermedia publication. To avoid difficulties with information quests, the user may need maps of progression or a series of standard cues to signal means of returning to more familiar electronic ground. Just Wait, You're Almost to the Good Part Some hypermedia publications are like a one-w,ay street with no exits available. The user must wait and see what comes next or give up completely. These hypermedia documents usually promise some great, upcoming event or gain in knowledge, if only the user will sit through the entire presentation. Cool, But Who Needs It? One of my favorite types of design mistakes is displayed by interesting hypermedia publications that nobody would ever need (except for the Technical Communication, Third Quarter 1993 427</page><page sequence="7">developer and a few friends). Typically, these hypermedia publications are art for art's sake; they demonstrate the latest techniques in multimedia or hypertext linking capabilities, but they don't really provide any useful information or necessary function for the audience. Numerous HyperCard stacks available in the public domain are examples of this kind of hypermedia - interesting to browse once but serving no long-term need for users. Summary of online design principles Simplicity is one of the most important goals of hypermedia publication design. Establish a background by consistently placing related elements of text, graphics, and navigational controls. Be consistent in your use of typeface, graphics, and labels. Save special effects for key moments of interaction, so that they will be noticeably different from the user's established expectations. Appropriateness requires that the organizational sponsor's image, the design elements, and the atmosphere or tone of interaction with the user all fit the purpose of the hypermedia publication. Function is a principle of design that suggests that the mental models created and the transparency of operation are determined by format expectations and navigational guides. Well-designed hypermedia publications help the user understand how to interact with the document and allow the user to control the nature of that interaction. Economy is a design principle that suggests that technological capabilities should not encourage authors to clutter hypermedia publications with expensive, time-consuming features that may not be necessary. The design should not be determined by available tools, nor limited by neglect. Each document should be developed and esthetically designed for economy of use by the intended audience. To achieve an artistic level of esthetically pleasing screen design, the hypermedia document designer must go beyond these or any other set of general principles. Some hypermedia publications are loaded with information but irritating to work with because of the implicit attitudes or tone established by the computer prompts and messages to the user. Many hypermedia publication designs are functionally adequate and yet esthetically ugly. Others have beautiful screens but lack ease of function. Ideally, function and esthetics merge into a unified design - a simple, appropriate, functional, and economical hypermedia publication. il REFERENCES Brockmann, R. John. 1986.
