<plain_text><page sequence="1">autobiography, in the novels themselves, and in other writings, as well as of paintings whose attributes in some way are evoked by Hardy's descriptive passages, in order to illustrate his hypotheses concerning Hardy's perception and presentation. Thirty-six of these paintings (including a few by Hardy himself) are reproduced on black-and-white plates, and in company with Bullen's acute commentary on them they constitute a substantial body of evidence about Hardy's manipulation of his visual imagination as well as about its origin and growth. Bullen in contemplat ing a painting has a way of remembering Hardy's phrases (or perhaps the process goes from reading the phrase to re membering the painting)?allowing him, for a minor in stance, to link a reference to a "new moon" in a descrip tion of Eustacia Vye to a new moon design in the hair of two women painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds (pp. 105, 107; and Plates 1 and 2). Bullen examines most of the novels in his study of the various concepts of focussed perception that Hardy ex ploits. For example, his explication o? Far from the Mad ding Crowd concentrates on Hardy's concern with the pri macy of vision itself, in interpretation and in physical accuracy (a variant of reality and appearance), within a context with universally accepted norms. A normative sit uation is not standard in Hardy's fiction; by the end of his career of writing novels there is no absolute norm, and all perceptions are relative. The great novels, Bullen sug gests, are founded on evolutions in Hardy's concept of vis uality moving over time toward this end-point of perva sive relativity. Thus, in The Return of the Native "the visual drama does not take place in the eyes of the charac ters. Now, it is the reader who is the principal spectator, and it is in his imagination that the spectacle unfolds." In this way Hardy employs "setting as a vehicle for emotion, of charging the visual image in such a way that it be comes a correlative for feelings experienced by the charac ters" (p. 89), a kind of "psychological landscape" (p. 90); anthropomorphic descriptions of Egdon Heath emphasize "the expressiveness of the human face" (p. 98). As evident from Bullen's comments on these two early novels, his sense of the way things "look" in an individu al novel encompasses a conceptual bias that ties together the novel's range of imagery and the possibilities of inter preting the portrayal of experience within the novel. To take further instances: The Mayor of Casterbridge is dis tinguished by its possessing a massive amount of specific details, for instance about Henchard's occupation and so cial standing but equally about his clothing. His rise and fall morally as well as financially are charted by whether he wears clothing fitting for the station he occupies at a given time?thus, he greets the Royal Visitor dressed in threadbare remnants of die clothes he wore as Mayor, but when he leaves Casterbridge upon fearing Newson's return J. B. Bullen, The Expressive Eye: Fiction and Perception in the Work of Thomas Hardy; pp. xviii, 279. Oxford: Clarendon Press; New York: Oxford UP, 1986. $54. Among the great number of critical studies of Hardy published within the last two decades, The Expressive Eye belongs in the first rank. In its touching interestingly upon a number of aspects of the stories it belongs with Jean Brooks's Thomas Hardy: The Poetic Structure (1971) and Ian Gregor's The Great Web: The Form of Hardy s Fiction (1974). As the purveyor of a "theme" approach to the great mass of Hardy's work it belongs with J. Hillis Miller's Thomas Hardy: Distance and Desire (1970) and Penny Boumelha's Thomas Hardy and Women (1982), al though its theme offers more varied entries into the fiction than do Miller's hypothesis about Hardy's standing aside from life or Boumelha's tracing his relationship with the New Woman fiction of 1880-1900. The only study rival ing Bullen's in its drawing upon concrete knowledge about Hardy's life and ideas is Michael Millgate's Thomas Hardy: His Career as a Novelist (1971). Bullen's approach is essentially two-fold. First, Hardy was a visual artist who developed aesthetic structures on concepts of "insight." Second, he drew upon conscious study of paintings and art-books (e.g., Ruskin's writings) to find expressive images for his instinctive, or artist's, sense of the need for a correspondence between image and idea. As the endpaper blurb says, Hardy's "imagery is not decorative but polemical." The customary critical view of Hardy as an auto-didact suggests a somewhat torturous, self-conscious use of artistic image; and there is much in Bullen's study to underscore Hardy's determination to learn about other people's responses to art, the most per suasive reminder of this determination being the "Schools of Painting" notebook (printed by Richard H. Taylor in The Personal Notebooks of Thomas Hardy /London, 1979]), which evidently represents note-takings and jot tings from a still-unidentified primer in art history. But the overall impression of Hardy's use of pictorial art, in cluding the frequent correspondence between Hardy's re sponses and those of his contemporaries, suggests not so much imitativeness as affinity. Throughout the book Bullen draws on an extensive knowledge of the paintings to which Hardy refers in his</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 41 he has acquired new clothing that re-identifies him as a hay-trusser in the same condition of life he had been in some 25 years earlier. Similarly, the "art" in Lucetta's get-up is contrasted with the "art" in Elizabeth-Jane's, which is only temporary and understood by her for what it's worth. As Hardy put it after finishing the novel, he wanted to make "the heart and inner meaning...vividly visible" by intensifying "the expression of things" (Early Life, pp. 231-32; Bullen, p. 142). In sharp contrast to this novel's vivid portrayal of the "physical constituents of life"?"their design, shape, and colour?[which] can be felt everywhere" in the novel (p. 141), in his next novel, The Woodlanders, Hardy skimps on details, distinguishing characters by their mental attitudes rather than their physi cal attributes. As Bullen says, it would be "difficult to mentally reconstruct the appearance of Giles Winterborne" or that of any of the other characters. Each character is a focus to a different "universe" (pp. 169-70), "intimately bound up with the author's own modes of perception" (p. 172). In other words, from the solidness and stability of Casterbridge the novelist moves into a world of flux, a world governed by ideas more than characterization, in par ticular the idea that society is not "an aggregate of separate individuals but as 'one great network or tissue' which 'quivers in every part when one point is shaken, like a spider's web'" (Early Life, p. 232; Bullen, p. 172). Justice cannot be done within the brief span of a review to Bullen's mode of argumentation, because he moves typically from a broad overview to close analyses of nu merous passages, analyses that draw in other material Har dy had available to him in contemporary metaphysics, ev olutionary theory, mythology, art theory, anthropology, and ethnology and to which he refers in letters and the like. With the exception of an extended (and richly sugges tive) chapter on the combined impact of Ruskin, Turner, and Pater upon Hardy's use of light in Tess of the d Urbervilles, Bullen discusses none of these materials ex tensively, but always with pinpointed relevance to the text of the novel at hand. It is this range of knowledge, as well as the tellingness of its application to Hardy's works, that makes this one of the most rewarding studies of Hardy in the last decade and a half.
