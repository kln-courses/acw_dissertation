BRUCE essays, all but one of which have been reprinted from other sources; consequently it offers no new theories with which the disciples of Alfred North Whitehead are not already familiar. The essays do, however, make a splendid exposition of the ideas which have marked the author as a great thinker and a liberal educator. "You may not divide the seamless coat of learning." That is the central thesis which runs through the book and which is demonstrated most clearly in the three chapters on the classics in education, the mathematics curriculum, and the place of technical education. Mr. White- head insists that the educated man must possess power of thought, power of action, and the imaginative initiative of art-all three. Three of the essays are distinctly the mathe- matician's treatment of "The Organization of Thought," "The Anatomy of. Some Scientific Ideas," and "Space, Time, and Relativity." DAISY B.

As the spectator of all time and all existence the philosopher must sooner or later give his view of the ultimate background of human life. Dewey has been so deeply con- cerned with distinctly human problems that it has not always seemed clear just what his metaphysical position was. This work comes nearer to an answer to this question. In his metaphysics he is a "Naturalist." But this term must not be taken as equivalent to "Materialist." Materialism is non-humanistic and finally pessimistic. Dewey is neither. The problem of life is the creation of value, and for human beings this means human value. Nature offers the raw material and the instruments for this creation. Nature is the mother of us all, and in her bosom we are nurtured. However, this does not warrant anthropomorphism, even of an idealisitic sort. Nature can become human, but it has not become merely that. On systematic classification in terms of traditional schools Dewey is very reserved. But the human has its place in the scheme of things, and we must concern ourselves with 307</page></plain_text>
