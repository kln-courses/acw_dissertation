<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Epistemology of the Kabbalah: Toward a Jewish Philosophy of Rhetoric* Identification is affirmed with earnestness precisely because there is division. Identification is compensatory to division. If men were not apart from one another, there would be no need for the rhetorician to proclaim their unity. If men were wholly and truly of one substance, absolute communication would be of man's very essence. It would not be an ideal, as it now is, partly embodied in material conditions and partly frustrated by these same conditions; rather, it would be as natural, spontaneous, and total as with those ideal prototypes of communication, the theologian's angels, or "messengers." - Kenneth Burke, A Rhetoric of Motives (22) In The Messiah of Stockholm by Cynthia Ozick, Lars Andemening, a Polish orphan of World War II who was raised in Sweden and is a bored literary reviewer for a young newspaper, seeks to find his true identity by searching for the lost manuscript of "The Messiah" by Polish writer Bruno Schulz, who had been killed by the Nazis and whom Lars believes to be his father. Lars also believes he will ultimately transcend his mundane existence through the discovery of the manuscript by finding in it a language in which all things are connected not only in spirit, or as Kenneth Burke would say, consubstantially, but materially, in substance, for the language of "The Messiah" is purported to be the language of God. The theory of language that Ozick allegorically subscribes to in this novel and that Burke gestures at in the quote above perhaps reveals the sublimated desire of rhetoric to be not just referential, a bridge over the gap between mind and reality created by consciousness, or merely eloquent, a harmonious medium paralleling the unity of the universe (Cicero, De Oratore III), but rather a transcendent material in which the experience of language is the experience of the universe. Operating against the fragmentation of empiricism and the duality of the rational cogito, such a rhetoric would be based on an epistemology in which matter and form are identical, the transcendental is written in the physical, and language and "reality" are one. Such a rhetoric, based on an ancient epistemology, exists. I refer not to Platonic or sophistic rhetorics, although traces of this epistemology may be found in these rhetorical philosophies; nor do I refer to deconstruction, but rather to its philosophical opposite which it thus ironically resembles. I refer to a Jewish mystical theory of language and knowledge embedded in the Kabbalah, which Harold Bloom has called "a theory of rhetoric" (18). In his classic 2 volume history, The Legacy of the Ancient World, W. G. De Burgh argues there are three pillars of Western civilization: Greece, from which we * This is an expanded version of "The Kabbalah as a Theory of Rhetoric: Another Suppressed Epistemology," which appeared in Rhetoric, Cultural Studies, and Literacy: Selected Papersfrom the 1994 Conference of the Rhetoric Society of America, Fred Reynolds, ed., Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1995.

RSQ 25 Annual Edition</page><page sequence="2">108 Steven B. Katz have inherited democracy; Rome, from which we have inherited law; and Israel, from which we have inherited faith. Almost from the beginning, the discipline of rhetoric in Western culture has been engaged in examining the rhetorical heritage of Greece, and later, Rome. However, the third pillar of the Western rhetorical tradition, the Jewish philosophy of language, to a large extent has been ignored by scholars of classical rhetoric except as it has been treated in traditional rhetorical (and literary) studies of the "Old Testament" (e.g., see The Book of the Honeycomb's Flow, where a systematic Aristotelian approach to the figures of speech is applied to the Pentateuch), Hellenized in Philo, rationalized in Maimonides, or transmuted in Christian rhetoric. In Classical Rhetoric and its Christian and Secular Tradition from ancient to Modern Times, George Kennedy does make passing mention of Jewish rhetoric, but by and large that the Jewish philosophy of language has been generally neglected, misrepresented, or misunderstood. This is especially true of the theory of language and knowledge found in Jewish mysticism, which finds a manifestation if not a culmination in the Kabbalah. Rhetorical scholars such as Brian Vickers have treated the Kabbalah within the context of occult views of language in the Renaissance, in opposition to science, as a confusion between word and reality (Introduction 34-44; "Analogy vs. Identity"). In fact, the Jewish philosophy has been relatively neglected if not actively opposed and suppressed even in mainstream Judaism (Scholem, Trends 1- 2, 22-34, 42); governed by the rational paradigm dominating Western culture, mainstream Judaism, like mainstream rhetoric, ignores or dismisses the hermeneutics of the Hebrew alphabet found in parts of the "oral Torah" (the Talmud, Midrash, and other rabbinical commentaries on the Torah) as well as the Kabbalah, as ethical allegory or fanciful story whose only purpose is moral edification or the instruction of children (also see Scholem, Trends 67). Yet, paradoxically, but not surprisingly given its spiritual and emotional dimension, the Kabbalah of the middle ages eventually exerted greater influence within mainstream Judaism than did rational Jewish philosophy (Trends 22-4). Elements of the mystical hermeneutics seem to underlie parts of mainstream Judaism today. This is not to condemn Judaism and Jewish rhetoric, but to praise them. For as a manifestation of Jewish mystical philosophy, the Kabbalah as a rhetorical theory explicitly addresses questions central in the rhetorical tradition of the West concerning the relationship between language, thought, and reality, but in a way not treated in any other rhetoric - certainly not that of the rationalists, Plato and Aristotle, nor even that of the empirical skeptics, the sophists. Indeed, as we will explore in this essay, the Jewish mystical theory of rhetoric, generally speaking, appears to fall right in between them. Questions concerning the existence of a distinct Jewish rhetoric (or rhetorics) and how best to define it have begun to occupy scholars committed to investigating its methods and developing a theories of it (e.g., the Preconvention Seminar on Jewish Rhetoric at the Speech Communication Association Convention, 1992-94). By and large, these attempts to define Jewish rhetoric(s) are based on the traditional elements of the communication paradigm: sender, audience, purpose, content. Yet, despite Vickers' treatment of Jewish mysticism as simply a part of a single occult tradition in the Renaissance ("Analogy vs. Identity" 105-109, 126), in the mystical strain of Judaism the cosmogonic interpretation of Hebrew letters constitutes a</page><page sequence="3">The Epistemology of the Kabbalah 109 unique hermeneutics, what Scholem calls "exquisitely Jewish ways of thought concerning the mystery of letters and language" (Trends 76); to my knowledge there is no other theory or method in which the letters of the alphabet are understood to constitute both the transcendental and material foundation of the universe (also see Dan, "Midrash" 128-29; Idel, "Infinities"). Thus, attention to the traditional elements of the communication paradigm, with its emphasis on the referential (and rational) dimension of language and meaning only, may not be enough to define all Jewish rhetoric(s) - particularly the mystical strain embodied in the Kabbalah. One way to define the epistemology of the Kabbalah (and of Jewish mysticism generally) as a rhetoric is to place that epistemology in the wider philosophical context of classical rhetoric. My approach here to the study of Jewish philosophy of rhetoric will be to place the epistemology of the mystical strain of Jewish rhetoric embedded in the Kabbalah within the philosophical context of Platonic and sophistic rhetorics. This will allow us to understand epistemological relationship of this Jewish rhetoric to these other rhetorics as well as to delineate the distinctive epistemology of this Jewish rhetoric. In fact, placing this Jewish philosophy of language and knowledge within the context of the Greek philosophies of rhetoric may be a necessary first step in defining Jewish rhetoric(s). Unlike the ancient Greeks and Romans, the ancient Jews did not seem to care too much about developing a theoretical basis for their "rhetorical practice." There are a few notable exceptions, such as the anonymous (?) author of the Book of Creation - "the earliest extant speculative text written in the Hebrew language" [Scholem, Trends 75]). But by and large ancient Jews did not extract and place their methods and beliefs in abstract philosophical categories, even in the early Merkabah mysticism (Scholem, Trends 62), though such philosophical speculation did exist among groups of Jewish gnostics (Scholem, Trends 74). "Classical Judaism expressed itself; it did not reflect upon itself," says Scholem (Trends 23). There are perhaps several possible reasons for this. First is the fact that Jewish rhetorical practice - methods of philological and ethical interpretation, persuasion, and belief - have been, and more or less still are, tacit and philosophically grounded in the Torah. The sacred object of hermeneutical desire and debate, the Torah obviates, at least ostensibly, the need for any further philosophical speculation of the kind we find in the more abstract and secular Greek and Roman philosophy. The Jews were indeed the people of the Book - a book representing if not containing the language of an omniscient and omnipotent God. Insofar as the Jews held to their belief in that God, no further metaphysics perhaps seemed necessary. (There is much evidence in the Mishnah, Talmud, and elsewhere that philosophical speculation about the 'true nature of things' was at different times and in different places restricted or forbidden by Rabbinic authority and mystic sage alike [e.g., see Scholem, Trends 47-48; 74; Origins 46]). Second, the interpretation of the Torah remained a remarkably oral enterprise, even when finally committed to writing in the "oral Torah" in the classical Rabbinic period (circa the 2nd through 4th centuries C.E.) in order to preserve the teaching of it in exile after the destruction of the Second Temple. In Midrashim and Talmud, the narrative quality of thought and agonistic nature of debate are preserved through story and marginalian commentary - not as a mere rhetorical device, as the dialogue quickly became in the hands of Greek dialecticians such as Plato, or as a</page><page sequence="4">110 Steven B. Katz literary convention only, but as the very purpose and essence of meaning: interpretation without end, amen. Given Walter Ong's discussion of the effects of the shift from orality to literary on consciousness and culture (Orality, esp. 31- 77), the preservation of the oral quality of Jewish interpretation and thought even in writing perhaps did not lead to the kind of philosophical abstraction written thought permits or is prone too. (As we will explore in this paper, just as the focus of Judaism is not an afterlife in heaven, but a working here and now to bring about God's Kingdom on earth, there is no definitive differentiation of "logos," no winnowing of word, thought, and thing that we get in other Western rhetorical philosophies, the result of which is either the privileging of things as Ideal Forms or empirical forms and the denigration of the word as a mere conveyor after/of the fact, or a privileging of the word over thing, which leads to probable knowledge only. Neither, as in Christianity, is the Word made flesh. Central to Judaism is the belief that God's name is one but unknowable to us except by many other names [see Schaya 136- 167; one prayer, "Bayom Hahu," expresses the belief that on the day God's Kingdom is established on earth, God's name will be one].) However, we may discover a third possible reason the ancient Jews did not attempt to develop a theoretical basis for their "rhetorical practice," did not abstract and place their methods and beliefs in philosophical categories: some ancient Jews, anyway, already may have been in possession of an epistemology grounded in the mystical strain of Jewish theology, culture, and texts - an epistemology at once material and transcendent, in which adherents, in theory and practice, tried to access and stay as close as possible to the subjective event of the mystical experience, as evidenced by the narrative and paradoxical quality of many a midrashim and mystical tract. At the same time, in their reading and interpretation of Torah, on which many midrashim and mystical tract are grounded, Jewish mystics developed an hermeneutics of ethics (see Dan, Jewish Mysticism), much of which centered around the alefbet (see Munk), especially God's name (Schaya, esp. 145-165) - a hermeneutics in which a material yet transcendent epistemology is manifest and perhaps embodied in prayer (e.g., the "Shema" and "V'havta"), contemporary instruction (e.g., Grishaver; Kipper and Bogot), and song (e.g., "Oyfn Pripetshik," or "At the Fireplace," originally "Der Alef-Beyz" by Mark M. Warshawsky). It is also this epistemology that we find in the Kabbalah. Although when we speak of the Kabbalah we primarily refer to a collection of texts composed by Moses de Leon, Moses Codovero, Abraham Abulafia, and Isaac Luria between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries, according to Gershom Scholem (Trends 18-19), the Kabbalah represents a continuous if irregular religious movement dating back at least to the classical Rabbinic period of the Talmud and the Midrash (and one may safely assume before that in the form of cult knowledge passed down orally [see Scholem, Trends 42; Ettisch; see Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah; Kabbalah; On the Kabbalah and It's Symbolism for an archeology]). Scholem's discussion suggests that the Kabbalah is not an anomaly in Judaism, but rather grew out of and transformed some mystical trends in ancient Judaism (Trends 40-79; cf. Trends 28-32, Origins 19, 46-47, passim, for differences between the Kabbalah and older forms of Jewish mysticism, and the philological and historical problems these give rise to).</page><page sequence="5">The Epistemology of the Kabbalah 111 What may be similar in these different forms of mysticism, and what I argue may be of particular importance in defining and understanding at least one strain of Jewish rhetoric, is the epistemology of language and knowledge found in it. Epistemology is a primary defining element of a rhetoric (e.g., see Scott; Berlin, "Contemporary Composition"). What is particularly noticeable in Jewish mysticism is the rhetorical attention paid to the letters of the Hebrew alefbet as epistemic paths to wisdom and knowledge. The theory of language centering around the Hebrew alefbet as the fundamental means and units of creation, which Scholem suggests "may well come from Judaism itself" (Origins 29), forms the backbone of the Kabbalah (see Scholem, Origins 24-34, esp. 33-4), and perhaps represents a Jewish philosophy of rhetoric that also may be found in the "oral Torah," including parts of the Talmud and the Midrash (see Hartman and Budick, esp. essays by Kugel; Dan, "Midrash"; and Idel). Indeed, the theory of the alefbet found in Kabbalah can traced back to at least the Safer Yesirah, the Book of Creation, written down around the first century C.E. (Trends 75-8, Origins 24-35); before that the theory of the alefbet probably existed as oral knowledge (see Kaplan, x, who adopts the traditional view within mysticism that Abraham was the oral author of The Book of Creation), and is perhaps concomitant with the invention of the alefbet itself (cf. Ettisch; Diringer 37-8, 55-6, 61-3). In this paper, then, I will not be looking at the differences in Jewish mysticism, at philosophy of religion, but rather at the philosophy of language and knowledge that seems to underlie and unite them, at epistemology. I wish to begin this examination of the philosophy of Jewish rhetoric by sketching the epistemology of the Kabbalah. Further research will be necessary to explore any philosophical connections between the epistemology of the Kabbalah and earlier forms of mysticism and other Jewish texts, especially Midrashim and Talmud, as well as with the origin and development of the Hebrew alphabet itself. Although there also is controversy concerning the authenticity of some of the manuscripts of the Kabbalah, including the Zohar, or Book of Splendor which de Leon claimed was an ancient original (see Ariel 33-4; Scholem, Trends 120-21), and although the Kabbalah "embraced an esotericism closely akin to Gnosticism, one which was not restricted to instruction in the mystical path but also included ideas on cosmology, angelology, and magic" (Scholem, Kabbalah 5), the Kabbalah embraces and constitutes a Jewish mystical theory of rhetoric which, although severed from the main trunk of that liturgical tradition, nevertheless seems to inform it. The word Kabbalah literally means "tradition." Existing outside the main body of Jewish practice (and yet built on and incorporating it), the Kabbalah constitutes among other things a nonrational, nonempirical, yet both metaphysical and material theory of language and knowledge. Whereas Plato believed that essence existed but could only be apprehended by the rational intellect, thus rendering rhetoric secondary if of any importance in obtaining knowledge, and the sophists generally denied the possibility of knowing essence, rendering rhetoric a nonrational basis of probable knowledge, these Jewish "rhetoricians" believed that essence is embodied in the material substance of the Hebrew language itself, in the shapes and sounds of letters (a position, as Vickers correctly points out ["Analogy vs. Identity" 97-100], that Plato ridicules in regard to Greek, as discussed below), rendering language the mystical basis of empirical reality and all true knowledge of it. As if to etymologically emphasize this point, the Hebrew word "d'var" means both word and thing.</page><page sequence="6">112 Steven B. Katz But a distinction must be made between theories language and reality in the Renaissance occult, in which word and referent are conflated (Vickers, "Analogy vs. Identity" 95-7, passim), and the Kabbalah as a rhetoric, which generally posits a direct connection only between language and the transcendental realm of truth that is invisible. In the mystical tradition of Jewish rhetoric, the material substance (shape and sound) of language does not attempt to imitate essence, which was the basis of Plato's charge (Cratylus 423e); rather, the material substance of language embodies "essence." Language is the essence of our knowledge. That is, in the Kabbalah, the Platonic and sophistic traditions seem to be combined (or not yet separated, depending on where one locates the temporal origin of the Kabbalah as a tradition); the transcendental not only exists but at a certain level can be apprehended through language and the senses, though with great difficulty. If they were contemporaneous, the epistemology underlying the Kabbalah would fall exactly between that of Plato and Aristotle, and their opposition, the sophists, though significantly sharing elements of both, and perhaps in the evolution of Western culture would represent an epistemology that is a primary phase in, if not the source of both strands of philosophic thought (see Diagram below). Note on Diagram: It is possible to imagine this pattern three-dimensionally as a historical spiral. For example, historically speaking, rational idealism could be first associated with Plato (and social-epistemicism with the sophists); naive empiricism with John Locke; positivism with Descartes; enlightened empiricism with Francis Bacon. Of course, all these positions have contemporary expressions we well: for example, it is obvious that social-epistemic rhetoric is a contemporary manifestation of sophism (see Katz, "Epistemic Trend"); thus this chart may predict the renewed interest in the relationship between rhetoric, mysticism, and magic, even in relation to science, which is taking place in various quarters (Vickers doesn't consider social-epistemic rhetoric and its relation to mysticism and science; in fact, social-epistemic rhetoric may reveal the link between them). It may also explain the renewed interest, since Ogg's The 26 Letters, in the origin and meaning of our alphabet, as evidenced by a recent relative spate of books on the subject (in addition to Ogg, see Firmage; Drucker). Looking at this chart we also can better understand how sophism taken to extremes becomes mysticism - how social-epistemicism becomes a kind of Platonic relativism (cf. Berlin, "Rhetoric and Ideology"; Katz, "Aristotle's Rhetoric" 40-44); how Platonic idealism grows out of mysticism - a kind of rationalization of mysticism; and how Ideal Forms become embedded in material reality - a mystical basis of empiricism. In fact, at any moment of history, all these epistemological positions exist simultaneously, with some (obviously on the right side of the diagram) dominating Western culture, but always contested by their suppressed philosophical opposites (cross- diagrammed). And yet, perhaps we can also understand mysticism as the nexus if not the source of both the subjective and the rational lines of philosophical thought. However, this reductive diagram also suggests a possible relationship of epistemological positions, and the connections between them, rather than only a historical cycle. In the three epistemologies on the top of the circle, mysticism forms the natural link between rational idealism (Platonism) and social- epistemicism (the sophists) - the two major strains of the philosophy of rhetoric, perhaps with Pythagoras falling somewhere between mysticism and rational idealism. The three epistemologies on the right side of the circle (including</page><page sequence="7">The Epistemology of the Kabbalah 113 positivism) from top down emphasize to increasing degrees objective reality, where the rational shades into the physical, objectivity becomes less mental and more material - or an avenue to the material world. The three epistemologies on the left of the circle (including mysticism) from bottom up emphasize to increasing degrees subjective reality, where the subjective (because of the need for validation) shades into the social, and the social becomes the subjective transcendental - or an avenue to it. Understood from another angle, what happens in the movement from social- epistemicism to mysticism is that over time the subjective and the social become, in Foucault's terms, the episteme, in which institutionalized points of power and control within the socio-linguistic matrix are reified in religion as divine attributes and authority. As we move over the top of the circle, this subjective transcendental qua religion becomes an objective transcendental, with vestiges of power, authority, and control increasingly attributed to an ostensible material reality. Thus, ideal rationalism can be regarded as simply a "degradation" of mysticism, a movement toward ideological objectivity where Ideal Forms are transferred to physical reality (Aristotle's move [Katz, Epistemic Music, Ch. 3, n.2], a move completed by Newtonian science and reaching its nadir in positivism), where the Ideal Forms as empirical facts are increasingly presumed to exist autonomously and observed objectively by the senses, after which the role of the subjective (the structure of the senses and mind) is once again recognized and allowed increasing transcendence. In any case, the Kabbalah seems to be a manifestation of another nonrational philosophy of rhetoric in addition to that of the sophists, one that has been suppressed by rationalist and empiricist philosophies both in Western civilization and in the religion that spawned it. The Kabbalah as a rhetoric connects the subjective with the transcendent, the personal with the universal - a rhetoric in which the individual hermeneutically seeks ethics in the material of the alphabet, seeks to experience and know the transcendental directly through language - the praxis of Jewish mysticism as a "rhetorical" endeavor. While the Kabbalah actually entails several variations of a philosophy of language (see Idel, "Reification"; Bloom 37-43), my purpose here is to briefly sketch out the epistemological thread that unites the various books of the Kabbalah as a theory of rhetoric, its relationship to other theories of rhetoric, and the implications of this rhetoric for understanding a different conception and use of language. Let's begin with some epistemological considerations. The dominant assumption in pre-Socratic Greek philosophy was that the word and the thing were one and the same (Kerferd 73). Thus, in the Cratylus, Plato explores the theory of origin and nature of language that the shape and/or sound of letters and words were directly related to (or more accurately, imitated) the objects they represent (423e). However, this is a theory that Plato has Socrates quickly dismiss as inconsistent and ludicrous (esp. 422b-440d). For Plato, there is a one-to-one correspondence between word and thing, but it is between name as visual sign (logos) and essence (or Idea) only, not shape or sound (389d-393d). For sophists such as Gorgias, on the other hand, there was apparently no correspondence at all between reality and language, either as visual sign or sound (Kerferd 98). For Gorgias and sophists generally, contradictory statements about</page><page sequence="8">114 Steven B. Katz phenomena were possible and equally valid (though not necessarily true) precisely because words bear no physical resemblance or direct relationship to the properties of phenomenon they purport to describe or explain. Thus, G. B. Kerferd believes that Gorgias' dictum, "Nothing exists; if it exists it can't be understood; if it is understood, it can't be communicated," is a problem of predication. The problem, Kerferd argues, is not whether some thing is or isn't, but what characteristics it possesses, and how we know it. Contra Plato, Gorgias believed we do so through language. As Richard Leo Enos demonstrates (78-83), the power of poetic language to create the sensory "illusion" of attributes in a powerfully persuasive simulacrum of reality, not through referential verisimilitude but through subjective response to the metaphorical and musical property of words, is necessary for belief, knowledge and action. (For a further discussion of this philosophy of rhetoric, see Katz, The Epistemic Music of Rhetoric). But a direct relationship between letters, names, words, and essence, is the basic epistemology of the Kabbalah. In the Sefirotic and Ecstatic Kabbalistic tradition of Codovero and Abulafia respectively, God in one fashion or another created the world using language (see Idel, "Reification"); because of this fact, through a process of ontic reversal (Steven T. Katz, Mysticism 31), these "rhetoricians" believed it is possible to directly experience and in some cases affect the cosmic realm that is real but invisible, hidden, unknowable except through the mystical experience of language - the alefcosmos. Just as Ernst Cassirer claims that language embodies and contains in its sensuous form the emotional impetus of the original drive that motivated its articulation in consciousness, the Kabbalists claim that all reality, all creation, is a language that bears the imprint of God's will and desire. The universe is what's left over, the smoking residue of God having spoken. Turning deconstruction on its head, Kabbalists hold that the whole universe is written - but by God. The major difference between the Kabbalists and deconstructionists, then, would seem to be the positing of a Final Transcendental Signified. But in the mystical tradition of the Kabbalah, no such notion exists - at least not the way we have understood it. The notion of God as Final Transcendental Signified, at least in part, rests on rational/empirical conceptions of God as anthropomorphic - as having attributes. In fact, in Jewish mysticism, not only cah God only be named metaphorically, as Ein-Sof - that which is infinite, without end - but is often understood as Ayin - Nothingness. As Bloom points out (24-5), this is an ironic subversion of traditional religious doctrine (which so often is used to clothe mystical experience in canonical garb [Scholem, Major Trends 9]). In the Kabbalah, God is not a Final Transcendental Signified, for there is nothing to refer to but more signifiers for God, who remains hidden, invisible in the language of creation - in the "difference," if you will. For Jewish mystics, God is in everything, and thus everything is at once a signifier and a signified in an endless play of signification. And yet for Jewish mystics, this interplay of signifiers, like language itself, constitutes a divine reality, is located in the transcendental realm, which is only apprehended through the mystical experience of language. This philosophy is the result of centuries of speculation which we will need to discuss briefly here to make sense of Kabbalah as a theory of rhetoric. For despite the heightened awareness and attention to the word - both written and oral - throughout the Jewish theological and cultural tradition, and ethnocentric theories</page><page sequence="9">The Epistemology of the Kabbalah 115 concerning the divine origin of the Hebrew alphabet (see Ettisch 1-8; Scholem, Major Trends 17), the metacosmic basis of the language of the Kabbalah is perhaps not only the self-conscious literacy we find in contemporary theories of literature and language. Rather, the metacosmic basis of the language of the Kabbalah is also an answer to questions concerning the nature of essences and attributes and their relation to human language and knowledge. For Jewish, Christian, and Muslim philosophers in the middle ages confronted with rationalistic Hellenic philosophy, particularly Neo-platonic and Aristotelian, these questions revolved around issue of the "physical" nature of God, and how we can know and describe it. As Isaac Husik discusses in A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy, for the Mutakallimun, an Islamic sect who followed the atomistic philosophy of Democritus, there was no distinction between essences and attributes since everything is composed of material atoms that impinge on each other directly. But if God has the different eternal attributes we ascribe, and essence and attributes are materially related, then there was either more than one God, or God was not of one essence. Both possibilities raised unresolvable questions concerning the nature of God because they flew in the face of monotheism - religious and philosophical. While this theosophy was adopted by some Jewish philosophers, it was rejected out of hand by the Medieval Jewish rationalists, most notably Maimonides (Husik xxiii), who followed Aristotle's reasoning concerning the necessity of a prime mover that moves but is itself unmoved. Thus Maimonides posited the notion of an objective, transcendent God who in essence is different from us, is pure Form, actuality, whose sphere is external to the universe, and whose Being is materially unrelated to the attributes of the sublunar world and not to be found in it (Husik xxxi-xxxviii). According to Husik (xxxvii-xlvi), Aristotle's view was, incorrectly it turns out, supplemented in other Jewish philosophies by a neo-Platonic doctrine of emanations, in which God is identified with the universe and in contact with the material world indirectly through the operation of linked spheres (Husik xxvii- xxviii). In a sense, in the neo-Platonic emanistic theory of Plotinus, the void that is opened in traditional religion (Scholem, Major Trends 13) between logos and material world is filled (and thus replaced) by spheres that are all materially related, one impinging on another from the supralunar to the sublunar. The neo-Platonic emanistic doctrine is similar to the Kabbalah (see Steven T. Katz, Mysticism 24- 32) - except in the all-important respect of the primary role of language (Idel, "Reification" 50; Bloom 25). The question of the nature and relationship of essences and attributes, then, can be understood to hinge on (or entail) different epistemologies of language and knowledge. In the philosophy of the sophists, essence either does not exist, is unknowable, or uncommunicable; this makes language all-important, for it is the only basis of knowledge, albeit probable, relative, and uncertain. In materialistic philosophies based on Democritus, there is no distinction between essence and attributes, which results in "the multiplication of essence" (Husik xxvi) and so renders language contradictory, problematic, useless. In the dualistic philosophies of Plato and Aristotle, essences and attributes are separate, and thus essence is knowable through the rational intellect alone (cf. Husik xxxv-xxxvi; xlv). For Plato, rhetoric was therefore rendered unimportant in obtaining "true" knowledge of</page><page sequence="10">116 Steven B. Katz Ideal Forms, and only good for communicating that knowledge after the fact (see Phaedrus); for Aristotle, style is a "necessary evil" "owing to a defect in our hearers" (Rhetoric III 1:8-9). The major difference between Plato and Aristotle, of course, is that Aristotle does not believe in a transcendental reality that corresponds to universal concepts (Husik xli). That is, Aristotle denies the existence of Ideal Forms, placing dialectic and rhetoric on equal footing and shifting the ground of certainty to apodictic, or scientific knowledge of empirical reality (Rhetoric I). But the Kabbalistic understanding of essence and attributes differs considerably from either the atomistic philosophy found in Islamic influences on Jewish philosophy, the Aristotelian view found in rational Jewish philosophies such as Maimonides, or the sophistic view which, not surprisingly, does not appear to be represented in religious philosophy where the existence of a transcendental realm of experience is more or less assumed. In fact, there is no distinction between essence and attribute for the Kabbalists (Scholem, Major Trends 11), for the problem was conceived from an entirely different ontological basis than the atomists conceived it: that of the mystical unity of essence and attributes in and through the language of the Sefiroth, which constitutes a rhetoric of the cosmos that is both speech and universe, made manifest in increasingly physical planes all understood as divine (see Ariel 111-21). This distinction also helps explain Vickers' misconception of the philosophy of language of the Kabbalah as simply a confusion of word and reality. Found most developed in the Sefer ha-Zohar, or the Book of Splendor, the "central work of classical Kabbalah" (Bloom 24) written by Moses de Leon in Guadalajara circa 1280-86, the Ten Sefiroth "became the divine emanations by which all reality is metaphysically connected and structured" (Bloom 22; cf. Scholem Major Trends 10-11; Katz, Mysticism 30-1). Furthermore, the Sefiroth are signs that increasingly constrict, unfold, and channel God's infinite thought in mystical (i.e., human) language (see Ariel 111-21). In [Neo-platonic] Plotinus, emanation is a process out from God, but in Kabbalah the process must take place within God Himself. An even more crucial difference from Neo-platonism is that all Kabbalistic theories of emanation are also theories of language. As Scholem says, "the God who manifests Himself is the God who expresses Himself," which means that the Sefirot are primarily language, attributes of God that need to be described by the various names of God when he is at work in creation. The Sefirot are complex figurations of God, tropes or turns of language that substitute for God. (Bloom 25) Thus, says Bloom, the Sefiroth "are not allegorical personifications, which is what all popular manuals of Kabbalah reduce them to, and though they have extraordinary potency, this is a power of signification rather than what we customarily think of as magic" (25-6). Contrary to Vickers' conception of the Kabbalah in the occult, then, what one gets in the Sefiroth are an interplay of signifiers situated in a transcendental realm that is also physical, every signifier reflecting in the other a hint of a divine presence that is hidden in them all (see Bloom 26-32). Language doesn't refer to a defined Final Transcendental Signified (nor to empirical reality only), but to other signs, which are themselves both material and "transcendental" [cf. Katz, Mysticism 8]).</page><page sequence="11">The Epistemology of the Kabbalah 117 A further explication of the Ten Sefiroth (see Bloom 27-47) is not as important here as the linguistic philosophy underlying the conception of them in the Kabbalah. If essence and attribute are unified, not atomistically, but metaphysically, linguistically, essence is represented in language not through imitation, but through the actual material substance of language, in the shapes and sounds of letters, names, words, and their numerical equivalents. It only stands to reason that if (social-epistemic) " reality" is constructed in and through language, the alphabet would constitute its essence. In the rhetorical philosophy of the Kabbalah, essence and attribute are joined in language, out of which both words and worlds are made (Katz, Mysticism 16). Thus, says Moshe Idel, "the letters are understood to constitute a mesocosmos that enables operations that can bridge the gap between the human - or the material - and the divine" ("Reification" 43; cf. 47). This cosmic dimension of Hebrew letters also is discussed, in a more esoteric way, by Ernst Ettisch, who investigates the ancient belief that the alefbet physically embodies in vowels and consonants astronomical knowledge of the stars. For the Kabbalists and Jewish mystics in general, language seems to be accorded a special ontological status, at once material and transcendental, at once physical and metaphysical, at once attribute and essence (Idel, "Reification" 44). This is perhaps best illustrated by the practice in ecstatic Kabbalism that centers on God's name in Hebrew, which is literally (physically) unsayable; the word standing in for God thus embodies the unknowableness of God, God's essence as Ein Sof, infinity, or Ayin, nothingness), in the material substance of language itself, by paradoxically expressing the transcendental in the ineffable (see Schaya 145-65). As Steven T. Katz demonstrates, paradoxical language, which was so problematic for Islamic and Jewish philosophers committed to an atomistic philosophy of essence and attributes, is necessary for this kind of mystical experience (Mysticism 16). If essence somehow embodied in the paradoxical substance of language, in attributes, then the transcendental could, theoretically, be known through the sensory experience of language, although mystics always warn of the difficulty of this process (Scholem, Major Trends 14-15). The contemplation of letters and sounds, the deconstructing and permutating of words and paradoxical phrases, according to Steven T. Katz (Mysticism), is supposed to lead the adept to a nonrational knowledge of essences! Through language the mystic as rhetor seeks to know the transcendental subjectively, through personal sense experience. In the mystical philosophy, unlike religion, personal experience within the context of a set of beliefs becomes just as important as doctrinal knowledge (Scholem, Major Trends 3-10). But this experience as knowledge is highly problematic and difficult to communicate, prove, or use precisely because it is highly personal, subjective. This rhetoric is ultimately a philosophy of nonrational, nonreferential experience, a pictogram of metaphysics and ethics, a signification of the unknowable. Perhaps it is for this reason more than any other that this nonreferential, nonrational use of language has been ignored, suppressed, or dismissed by rational and empirical philosophies - this despite the fact that certain aspects of mysticism may be retained, for example, in poetry as the affective apprehension of truth, in rhetoric's belief in the epistemic or persuasive power of language, in science as the faith in an immutable (and numerical) reality. Mysticism, even Jewish mysticism, may also form part of the foundation for other epistemologies that have influenced</page><page sequence="12">118 Steven B. Katz rhetoric, for example, the Pythagorean via Plato, or the philosophy of the sophists, though right now this is mere speculation on my part. Perhaps there also are ideological reasons that the nonrational, nonreferential use of language has been excluded from rhetoric. Although knowledge of this use of language is difficult to teach, communicate, or attain, and was meant only for initiates, in this "rhetorical tradition" the function of language is nothing less than the "transformation of consciousness" through the disruption of "the normal categories of thinking" (Katz, Mysticism 6; 7). (It is questionable whether Foucault would think that any language is free enough from any episteme to disrupt consciousness, however, or whether something like a koan would itself set the boundaries that would "institutionalize" and so circumscribe and linguistically limit thought - though perhaps by denying the referential and social functions of language as "commentary," perhaps mystical language escapes this epistemological prison). For Jewish mystics, as for the sophists, language is epistemic, In that the mechanisms of knowing necessarily impinge on, even create, the substantive knowledge gained in mystical experience no less than in the more mundane epistemological contexts, language is a, if not the, key issue in reforming those structures required for obtaining mystical awareness. Language creates, when used by the mystical adept...the operative process through which the essential epistemic channels that permit mystical forms of knowing and being are accessible. (Katz, Mysticism 8) If Platonic essence apprehended rationally grows out of mysticism, the stylistic indeterminacy of the sophists taken to extremes could theoretically lead to the experience of mysticism. But for Jewish mystics, unlike the sophists, there is a direct, physical connection between a sign and what it represents. And for the mystics, unlike Plato, these essences, as Ein Sof or Ayin, are knowable only through the language that embodies them, though that knowing is imperfect. This material yet metacosmic epistemology we find in the Kabbalah appears to underlie the rhetorical philosophy of the alefbet. And this rhetorical philosophy in one form or another seems to permeate Judaism, and at different times and different places to have occupied ancient and modem Jews alike. According to Scholem, the Sefiroth of the Kabbalah are a relatively new invention, the letters are not, and the ethical and metacosmic dimension of the alefbet are mentioned many times in the old Aggadah (Trends 77, ff.130, 368). As Scholem states, "While the numerical- mystical speculation on the sefiroth probably has its origin in neo-pythagorean sources....the idea of the "letters" by means of which heaven and earth were created" may well come from within Judaism itself" (Origins 29). Does this the epistemology, albeit muted, underlie not only those parts of Jewish hermeneutics, prayer, and song centered around the Hebrew alefbet, but also Pythagorean-Platonic and sophistic-epistemic philosophies of rhetoric that are in opposite ways built on a "metaphysics of language"? One thing we do know is that in the rhetorical philosophy embodied in the Kabbalah, language "does not say something, does not tell something, but it does something" (Katz, Mysticism 12). In this rhetorical philosophy, language not only creates social reality or poorly reflects transcendental reality; it is understood as a part of reality, and in some of the more extreme Kabbalistic theories is thought not</page><page sequence="13">The Epistemology of the Kabbalah 119 only to affect the consciousness speaker or hearer, but also to affect the cosmic order itself (Katz, Mysticism 21-4). (This is "symbolic action" taken to extremes. But unlike the popular understanding of the role of language in magic, or Vickers' account of the Kabbalah in relation to Renaissance science ["Analogy vs. Identity," esp. 96-7], language in the Kabbalah is not generally understood to evoke a change in physical reality, but only in cosmic or "spiritual reality." [In this regard, cosmic or spiritual reality may not be different from "social reality" created by epistemic rhetorics. However, this metacosmic reality always remains nonempirical and nonrational; it thus can only be intuited and experienced subjectively, and is not subject to validation.] Creating or changing physical reality through language is something only a Master Rhetorician, such as God, would be able to do.) The Jewish philosophy of language constitutes the epistemological basis of a unique hermeneutics and ethics, and so may represent a distinct rhetoric within the Western tradition. Suppressed by rational thinkers both in Judaism and in Western culture generally, this strand of Jewish rhetoric shows us a philosophy of language in which ethical behavior and spiritual existence rather than referential signification and rational thought is the focal point and primary concern of its practitioners. Whether one believes in a metacosmic realm or not, whether God is a transcendental Being or socially-constructed one, continually creating through language or created in it, the Jewish philosophy of rhetoric embodied in the Kabbalah and perhaps other sacred Jewish texts therefore can inform our understanding of the rhetorical tradition of the West, and deserves examination by scholars in rhetoric as well as Jewish studies. Not only would such an examination illuminate a rhetorical tradition, submerged yet vital, in Western culture, but also throw light on the relationship between Platonic and sophistic epistemologies and the mystical elements of each. Like the Hebrew letters themselves, the Jewish leg of the rhetorical tradition contains an epistemological vision in which all things are connected not only in spirit, but as Kenneth Burke might say, in substance.
