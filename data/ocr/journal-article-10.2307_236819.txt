<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Visual Theology of Victorian Popularizers of Science From Reverent Eye to Chemical Retina By Bernard Lightman* ABSTRACT This essay examines the use of visual images during the latter half of the nineteenth century in the work of three important popularizers of science. J. G. Wood, Richard Proctor, and Agnes Clerke skillfully used illustrations and photographs to establish their credibility as trustworthy guides to scientific, moral, and religious truths. All three worked within the natural theology tradition, despite the powerful critique of William Paley's argument from design set forth in Charles Darwin's Origin of Species (1859). Wood, Proctor, and Clerke recognized that in order to reach a popular audience with their message of divine wonder in nature, they would have to take advantage of the developing mass visual culture em- bodied in the new pictorial magazines, spectacles, and entertaining toys based on scientific gadgets emblematic of the reorganization of vision. But in drawing on different facets of the emerging visual culture and in looking to the images produced by the new visual technologies to find the hand of God in nature, these popularizers subtly transformed the natural theology tradition. RECOGNIZING THAT HIS YOUTHFUL READERS would find the frontispiece to his popular science book A Glance at the Globe, and at Worlds Around Us (1848), some- what confusing, Jefferys Taylor (1792-1853) included a "Description of the Plate" im- mediately after his preface. The illustration, Taylor explained, depicted a lunar landscape, not an earthly one, "and the spectator is considered on this occasion to be in the moon itself, surveying the chill and rugged features of that small planet as they probably appear during a lunar night under the secondary light reflected from the Earth." (See cover illus- tration.) It was an eerie, desolate, and alien landscape.

Taylor insisted that the artist had represented the view "with entire fidelity," guided by "the best scientific and telescopic authorities."' Placing the reader on a barren moon would seem to be a somewhat peculiar way to begin a book on natural theology. But throughout the chapters on astronomy, the earth as a residence for living creatures, botany, zoology, mineralogy, history, Greek and Roman civilization, and religion, Taylor encouraged his readers to entertain a larger, unearthly perspective in order to bring into view hidden worlds of wonder in nature. In his intro- duction Taylor emphasized the need to train the eye to see properly. He urged his young readers not to waste the "gift of eyesight." Presenting a variation on an old biblical theme they have eyes, but they do not see (Psalms 115:5)-Taylor wondered, "How many a brilliant youthful eye of first-rate visual powers ... [has] never perused the bright lesson traced by the finger of God either on the firmament or the flower!" Taylor believed that his book, in "assisting the opening eye," would lead the reader to discern the infinite power, wisdom, and goodness in nature. Such discernment was sorely needed, Taylor maintained, for "Natural Theology" was "too little attended to by young persons in general, and, indeed, by most of us." It is not surprising that a man with Taylor's family background would write a book on natural theology for children. His father Isaac Taylor (1759-1829), a Nonconformist pastor, engraver, and writer for the young, raised a family of writers, the most famous of which were Jefferys's older sisters Ann and Jane, renowned for their contributions to children's literature.2 But Jefferys Taylor's natural theological approach to the popularization of science was not unusual in Victorian England. Neither was his concern with the "gift of eyesight," nor his presentation of an illustration that served to reveal a wondrous new world. The frontispiece was the only visual image in the entire book, however. Other influential popularizers of science-such as John George Wood, Richard Proctor, and Agnes Clerke, whose collective work spans the 1850s to the 1890s-made spectacular visual images central to their work. During the latter half of the nineteenth century a series of overlapping cultural and social developments shaped the trajectory of science popular- ization. The growth of an educated middle class, and therefore a large reading audience, and the invention of new printing technologies made possible the birth of a mass market, which in turn opened up new career opportunities in journalism and writing. The latter half of the nineteenth century has often been seen as a period when the drive for profes- sionalization, spearheaded by T. H. Huxley and other scientific naturalists, transformed the face of Victorian science. Huxley and his allies managed to pry loose government funding for the establishment of modern laboratories and salaried positions for scientists.

As professional scientists began to pursue highly specialized research, a market emerged for popularizers who could act as mediators between the professionals and the reading public.3 Concurrent with the growth of a mass market in the mid-Victorian period, the devel- opment of a mass visual culture made images far more available to the reading public. Popularizers of science like Wood, Proctor, and Clerke deliberately used visual images- including drawings, maps, and photographs-in their efforts to keep natural theology alive at a time when Darwinian theory and scientific naturalism threatened to bury it forever. They presented themselves as scientific experts who had the ability to interpret images produced by the microscope, the telescope, and newly developed instruments such as the spectroscope and the camera. Through their visual theology, they attempted to train the eyes of their readers to see infinite power, wisdom, and benevolence at work in the uni- verse. But conceptions about vision itself were in the process of being transformed as the human eye became an object of knowledge during the nineteenth century. Embedded in new scientific instruments such as the spectroscope and the camera was the recognition that the human eye was fallible and limited. The popularizers who attempted to interpret the images produced by these instruments refashioned the natural theology tradition in light of the reorganization of vision. The result was a sophisticated use of visual images in popular science that maintained the credibility of natural theology without relying on a simplistic empiricism based on the primacy of the human eye. POPULAR SCIENCE, NATURAL THEOLOGY, AND VICTORIAN VISUAL CULTURE Detailed scholarly investigations of scientific illustrations in popular science books are rare.4 No doubt this is due to the scholarly prejudice against scientific popularizations, which were perceived, until recently, as simplified and even distorted accounts of genuine science disseminated to a passive readership. This historiographic point of view, the "dif- fusionist model" of popularization, treats illustrations merely as one of the popularizers' most effective tools of simplification: pictures supposedly have a special appeal for the less intelligent and require little sophistication on the part of those who deploy them. Any comparison of popular and professional science based on the diffusionist model would no doubt emphasize that popularizers relied more than their professional counterparts on vi- sual images. Since the late 1980s, however, this approach to visual images in popular science has been undermined from two different directions. First, as Brian Baigrie has pointed out, there has been a growing "appreciation of the complex role that illustration plays in the creation of scientific knowledge" that helps to correct the preference for theory and lan- guage "inherited from logical empiricism." It turns out that visual images are often used 3 Bernard Lightman, " 'The Voices of Nature': Popularizing Victorian Science," in Victorian Science in Con- text, ed. Lightman (Chicago/London: Univ. Chicago Press, 1997), pp. 187-211. 4 One of the few is Greg Myers, "Every Picture Tells a Story: Illustrations in E. 0. Wilson's Sociobiology," in Representation in Scientific Practice, ed.

We cannot adopt the diffusionist model as a heuristic guide to research because it uncritically assumes the existence of two independent, homogeneous cultures, elite and popular, and forces the latter into a purely passive role. But popular culture can actively produce its own indigenous science, or transform the products of elite culture in the process of appropriating them, or substantially affect the nature of elite science as the price of consuming the knowledge it is offered.6 Instead of approaching visual images in popular science with the idea that popularizers differed radically from professionals in using illustrations as a means of simplifying science for a mass reading audience, scholars should now begin to analyze the rhetorical role of visual images in both popular and professional scientific works, whatever the intended audience. An examination of the rhetorical role of visual images in science needs to be combined with research on visual culture in general. Scholars have explored several interconnected aspects of Victorian visual culture, though the larger picture is still far from clear. Patricia Anderson has discussed the development of a new and enlarged popular culture in England that was distinguished by its increasingly pictorial character. She examines the rise from 1830 to 1860 of illustrated weeklies like the Penny Magazine, which, thanks to advances in printing technology, made diverse imagery widely available and affordable for the first time.7 The publication in 1843 of a panorama by the Illustrated London News, one of the successors of the Penny Magazine, points to the link between the illustrated weeklies and a second dimension of the new visual culture, the spectacle, which became an increasingly popular form of entertainment during the nineteenth century."

Stafford has pointed out that one of the reasons why a mass visual culture did not develop in England before the early nineteenth century may have been the tendency of eighteenth-century Protestants to prefer a culture of reading and writing and to be suspicious of visual images as susceptible of manipulation by devious Catholics. This led to a prejudice against combining instructive science with entertaining images. See Barbara Maria Stafford, Artful Science: Enlightenment Entertainment and the Eclipse of Visual Education (Cambridge, Mass./London: MIT Press, 1994). 8 The Illustrated London News presented itself as providing its readers with a panorama of the world. In its first number, on 14 May 1842, the News stated that its goal was "to keep continually before the eye of the world a living and moving panorama of all its actions and influences": quoted in Ralph Hyde, Panoramania! The Art</page><page sequence="6">BERNARD LIGHTMAN 655 images of entire cities, historical events, or military battles, often from a height, which gave the spectator an intoxicating God's-eye view of the scene. The aim of the panorama was to trick audience members into believing that they were there-that they were looking at nature itself. Other spectacles, particularly in London, were geared specifically toward science; an example was the Crystal Palace's series of life-sized reconstructions of some of the more impressive fossil animals that geological research had revealed, built by the sculptor and illustrator Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins and first on view in 1854. Earlier in the century, William and Deane Walker's Eidouranion displayed recent astronomical discoveries on a moving musical planetarium twenty feet high and twenty-seven feet in diameter. Iwan Rhys Morus has explored how artisan instrument makers, eager to appear before the public as men of science, displayed electrical science in spectacles at such London venues as the Adelaide Gallery and the Polytechnic Institution during the 1830s and 1840s.9 Whether they took in a panorama at the Regent's Park Colosseum or one of the other shows of London, Victorian audiences were bombarded by a stream of spectac- ular new visual images that changed their relationship to the world and influenced how they were to observe it. The deceptive quality of the panorama suggests a link between spectacles and a third aspect of Victorian visual culture-the reorganization of vision that created a new kind of observer. Jonathan Crary has analyzed how the classical model of vision, based on the optical principles of the camera obscura with its passive, separate observer, slowly gave way in the early nineteenth century to a new model wherein the observer was not a passive receiver of sensation. Human vision itself became an object of knowledge and observation, and scientists created a series of optical gadgets, like the thaumatrope, the phenakistiscope, the kaleidoscope, and the zootrope, that demonstrated how the eye could be tricked. In Crary' s view, the lack of unifying order in the image produced by the stereoscope qualifies it as the paradigmatic scientific instrument of the new visual model.10 But, as Crary ob- serves, the results of scientific studies on vision were introduced into popular culture when the optical devices initially used in experiments were converted into forms of popular entertainment. Visual images and visuality played a key role in the development of Victorian science, in particular evolutionary theory. In order to undermine William Paley's design argument, however, Darwin also had to grapple with the theory of vision underlying natural theology. Paley had argued in his Natural Theology (1802) that the designed quality of the eye offered a compete proof of the existence of God. "Were there no example in the world of contrivance except that of the eye," Paley declared, "it would be alone sufficient to support the conclusion which we draw from it, as to the necessity of an intelligent Creator." To demonstrate the designed nature of the eye, Paley compared it to several humanly created instruments related to vision. Both the telescope and the eye were mechanisms constructed and Entertainment of the "All-Embracing" View (London: Trefoil, in association with Barbican Art Gallery, 1988), p. 38.

Paley even likened the chamber of the eye to a camera obscura to highlight its mechanical characteristics. But why, he asked, did an omnipotent power need to resort to contrivance, which, "by its very definition and nature, is the refuge of imperfection?" His answer is revealing. Only by displaying contrivance could "the existence, the agency, [and] the wisdom of the Deity" be "testified to his rational creatures." If contrivance were taken away, then "you take away from us every subject of observation, and ground of reasoning" and remove that which "constitutes the order and beauty of the universe."11 For Paley, contrivance was the ground of all rational insight-and all science. The eye of natural theology not only saw God in nature; it saw itself as designed and recognized that contri- vance made sight possible in the first place. The universe was transparent to humans, and God intended it to be that way. Darwin realized that in order to undermine the power of natural theology he needed to disengage rational insight from Paley' s Christianized theory of visualization. In the chapter "Difficulties on Theory" in his Origin of Species (1859), Darwin too compared the human eye to a telescope, admitting that the comparison was impossible to avoid. "We know," Darwin wrote, "that this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued efforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process." But, Darwin asks, isn't it presumptuous to assume that the "Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man?" 12 He goes on to argue that we can conceive of a nobler process whereby the eye was formed. Like any organ of extreme perfection, the eye could be the result of the process of natural selection, wherein a simple and imperfect organ evolves into a complex one through numerous gradations, each new grade being useful to its possessor and the result of variation. Darwin's rejection of Paley's analogy between the eye and the telescope entailed more than an attack on the design argument. As James Krasner has shown, Darwin was also undermining the connection between Paley' s concept of vision and his mechanistic natural theology. The tensions between evolutionary theory and natural theology were reflected in two different models of vision. While Paley adopted the classical model of vision based on the camera obscura, Darwin's "entangled eye" acknowledged the unreliability and limitations of human perception discussed by Crary as central to the reorganization of vision. According to Krasner, because evolutionary nature lacks stable biological forms, Darwin portrays the natural world as lacking distinct visual forms by using "representa- tional techniques that disorient the reader's mental vision-imaginative illusions that par- allel the perceptual illusions to which physical vision is prone." But the observer is also subject to the evolutionary process, which complicates the attempt to catch a clear glimpse of nature. Evolutionary nature can be seen only through an imperfectly adapted product of evolution, the human eye, and Darwin's narrative takes into account that the scientist sees through an eye entangled in its "own perceptual processes." 13 For Darwin, both the " William Paley, Natural Theology; or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity, Collectedfrom the Appearances of Nature (Houston: St. Thomas, 1972), pp. 55, 18, 28, 29.

Darwin tries to compensate for the lack of omniscience by presenting the reader with a proliferation of written detail; his language is highly visual so that he can imaginatively reconstruct what cannot be seen. The reorganization of vision, combined with Darwin's attack on Paley's mechanistic natural theology and the classical model of vision it rested upon, presented a difficult challenge for an important group of popularizers of science who attempted to perpetuate the natural theology tradition in the latter half of the nineteenth century. 14 How were they to keep natural theology alive in popular science when professional scientists such as T. H. Huxley, Herbert Spencer, and John Tyndall drew upon Darwinian evolution as a means of secularizing nature? Popularizers of science such as John George Wood, Richard Proc- tor, and Agnes Clerke made extensive use of visual images as a deliberate strategy to preserve natural theology. They recognized that if they were to reach a popular audience with their message about the religious dimensions of science, then they would have to take advantage of the developing mass visual culture embodied in the new pictorial magazines, spectacles, and entertaining toys based on scientific gadgets emblematic of the reorgani- zation of vision. Thanks to their awareness of such developments, popularizers were just as skilled as professional scientists in the use of visual images.15 But in addition to con- necting natural theology with the new mass visual culture, these popularizers established themselves as reliable guides to nature through their use of new visual technologies, es- pecially those associated with scientific instruments such as the spectroscope and the cam- era. In the process of bringing together the popularization of science with mass visual culture and the reorganization of vision, they subtly transformed the natural theology tradition. J. G. WOOD AND THE "REVERENT EYE" An Oxford M.A. and ordained Anglican minister who retired from regular clerical work in 1863 to pursue a writing career as a popularizer of natural history, the Reverend John George Wood (1827-1889) understood the importance of spectacle, at least in religion. Appointed precentor of the Canterbury Diocesan Choral Union in 1863, he was responsible at the cathedral for the musical component of the most important service of the year. Wood introduced several innovations into the service, including an impressive procession of all the participating choirs in full voice. (The procession was so long that once, after beginning in the key of G at the front of the line, the singers finished in F. Wood later added brass perceptual processes"). Krasner's point-that Darwin's evolutionary concept of the entangled eye is connected to the reorganization of vision central to Crary's argument-is supported by an addition that Darwin made to the sixth edition of the Origin. Near the end of Chapter 6, "Difficulties on Theory," Darwin quotes from Hermann von Helmholtz's work on optics to demonstrate that even in organs like the eye, which are supposedly examples of extreme perfection, there are imperfections. Darwin himself saw the connection between his evolutionary theory and the research of one of the most important contributors to what Crary describes as a new model of vision. See Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species, ed. Morse Peckham (Philadelphia: Univ. Pennsylvania Press, 1959), p. 373. 14 I have elsewhere discussed how popularizers of science such as Wood, Proctor, Clerke, Eliza Brightwen, Arabella Buckley, and Margaret Gatty presented a "voice of nature" in opposition to the "voice" of a secular nature presented by scientific naturalists; see Lightman, " 'Voices of Nature' " (cit. n. 3). 15 Recent studies have dealt with the use of visual images by both Thomas Henry Huxley and Charles Darwin. See George R. Bodmer, "The Technical Illustration of Thomas Henry Huxley," in Thomas Henry Huxley's Place in Science and Letters: Centenary Essays, ed. Alan P. Barr (Athens/London: Univ. Georgia Press, 1997), pp. 277-295; and Prodger, "Illustration as Strategy" (cit. n. 11).</page><page sequence="9">658 VICTORIAN POPULARIZERS OF SCIENCE instruments to the processional hymn to counteract the distressing tendency of the singers to go flat.)16 Spectacle played a role in his work as a popularizer of science as well. Wood developed a new technique for displaying visual images to the large crowds that flocked to hear his public lectures and made extensive use of illustrations in his many natural history books. They were an important component of his attempt to train the reader to develop a "reverent eye" that could see the hand of God in nature, especially the micro- scopic world. Though Wood delivered his first public lecture in 1856, it wasn't until 1879 that he decided to take up lecturing on natural history as a secondary profession. Realizing that he was entering a competitive field, Wood created an innovative speaking style that won him many invitations to lecture from 1879 to 1888, including the prestigious Lowell Lec- tures at Boston in 1883-1884. At the height of his popularity, in the 1881-1882 season, Wood delivered one hundred twenty lectures in a single year. Wood's "sketch-lectures" were successful thanks to his unusual talent for "descriptive freehand drawing." Instead of offering carefully prepared and elaborate diagrams or magic lantern slides, Wood illus- trated key points in his lectures with "rapid impromptu sketches" of battling ants, gigantic whales, and other creatures that gradually took shape before the startled eyes of his au- dience. Wood used color pastels, imported from Paris, that positively glowed on his black canvas drawing surface.'7 Besides the vivid colors of Wood's illustrations, the audiences were impressed by their magnitude. The sheet of black canvas was stretched on a wooden frame of his own design that gave him a surface of eleven feet by five feet six inches. Close up, the drawings appeared coarse and clumsy; but when viewed from thirty or forty feet away they were elegant pictures that were clearly visible in every part of the largest hall. The impact on the audience was electrifying. In one of his Lowell Lectures Wood spoke on the whale to a packed room. "When I opened the lecture," he reported to his family, "by drawing the whale, eleven feet long, in two strokes, there was first dead silence, and then such a thunder of applause that I had to wait." Like the panoramas on display in London, Wood's larger- than-life sketches catered to the popular audience's taste for spectacle."8 He realized that if science lectures were to become a popular form of entertainment, and if he were to succeed as a public lecturer, he had to satisfy the craving for visual images that was the hallmark of mass culture in this period. Wood was in competition with professional scientists like John Tyndall who had tre- mendous reputations as powerful speakers and great showmen. Tyndall's theatrics during his Royal Institution lectures were legendary. Once he accidentally knocked a flask off a desk while preparing for a lecture, but quickly jumped over the desk and caught the flask before it hit the ground. He then rehearsed the "accident" and included it in his lecture. Another time, in 1862, Tyndall had the chairman at his Spring Lecture light a cigar at the invisible focus of a beam of infrared radiation. Like Tyndall's total control over his ex- perimental apparatus, Wood's command of his pastels in the accurate depiction of the natural world served as proof of his scientific expertise. According to his son, the sketches were "always perfectly exact in every particular," and "no line was ever rubbed out or alteration ever made." Wood' s seemingly spontaneous sketches were the outcome of long 16 Rev. Theodore Wood, The Rev. J. G. Wood: His Life and Work (New York: Cassell, [1890]), p. 53. .17 Ibid., pp. 129, 254, 136, 145, 156. 18 Ibid., pp. 157, 203 (quotation). Unfortunately, copies of Wood's pictures have not been preserved. After every lecture he wiped his canvas clean, as if it were a blackboard.</page><page sequence="10">BERNARD LIGHTMAN 659 and careful prior preparation. First, he made a tracing of the object he wished to draw from some trustworthy woodcut. He would copy this two or three times upon a slate, always attempting to do so with the fewest possible lines. Next, he would make a very careful sketch in color upon the back of a small paper strip; then, finally, he would stand before his black canvas and practice drawing the sketch over and over until he could execute it without hesitation and without mistake.'9 Although the illustrations in Wood's books were not drawn by him, he paid careful attention to the visual dimensions of his published work. All of his natural history books were well illustrated. In Insects at Home (1872), for example, there were seven hundred figures drawn by E. A. Smith and J. B. Zwecker and engraved by G. Pearson, including twenty lavish plates and seventy-nine woodcuts. For Insects Abroad (1874) Wood used the same artistic team. But since here he was dealing with insects that could only be found outside of England, he took special precautions to obtain accurate drawings. His preface assured the reader that the six hundred illustrations had been made from actual specimens and that "in order to ensure accuracy in rendering the 'texture,' the engraver has taken the trouble to inspect the insects themselves before touching the block on which they were drawn." For Common Objects of the Microscope (1861), Wood was so busy with other projects that he allowed his illustrator, Tuffen West, to select the objects to be described on the twenty plates at the back of the book. But he was right to have complete confidence in West, who was responsible for thousands of illustrations in books and journals on microscopy and was widely considered the most famous microscopical illustrator of the second half of the nineteenth century.20 The visual images in Wood's books and lectures played a key role in his presentation of a subtle form of natural theology. In the preface to his Illustrated Natural History for Young People (1882), Wood stated that his "end" was to lead the reader to "notice how wonderfully each creature is adapted for its peculiar station by Him who has appointed to each its proper position." But Wood recognized that some readers had prejudices that led them to a "causeless abhorrence of certain creatures" such as snakes, spiders, or toads. Wood urged them to examine such creatures with "a more reverent eye," because they were beings that the "Maker saw at the beginning of the world and declared very good." The true naturalist, Wood declared, "will see as much beauty in a snake, spider, or toad, as in any of those animals which we are accustomed to consider models of beauty." When the organizational details of these supposedly ugly and frightful animals are studied under the microscope, we become "lost in wonder and amaze at the vastness of creation, which, even in one little, apparently insignificant animal, presents to our eyes innumerable mar- vels-marvels which increase in number and beauty as our power for perceiving them increases."21 19 Ibid., pp. 159 (quotation), 154.

Wood did not draw the illustrations for his books partly because he was too busy writing and partly because the skills needed to draw huge pictures for his lectures were different from those needed for small book illustrations. He could make more money letting the publisher hire an illustrator, or a team of illustrators, while he wrote more books. 21 Rev. J. G.

Unlike professional sci- entists such as Huxley, who claimed that proper use of the instrument was confined to those few trained to the task in modern laboratories, Wood believed that anyone could make important scientific discoveries with a microscope. His best-selling Common Objects of the Microscope (1861) discussed different types of microscopes, explained how to prepare cells, offered suggestions on interesting objects to view, and invited readers to compare what they saw with the twelve plates of illustrations at the back of the book. Plate III (Frontispiece) contains fifty-two images of various vegetable and flower structures disembodied from the original plants. Though Wood admitted that the drawings could not fully capture "the lovely structures," the symmetrical and geometrical shapes illustrate his point about the hidden beauty of the microscopic world. "Their form can be given faithfully enough," he affirmed, "and their colour can be indicated; but no pen, pencil, or brush, however skillfully wielded, can reproduce the soft, glowing radiance, the delicate pearly translucency, or the flashing effulgence of living and ever-changing light with which God wills to imbue even the smallest of his creatures, . . . whose wondrous beauty astonishes and delights the eye, and fills the heart with awe and adoration."22 While T. H. Huxley's future science teachers were trained to see a fully secularized material world at his lab at South Kensington, Wood's reading audience was expected to see divine beauty through the lens of the microscope. In Insects at Home and Insects Abroad, published within two years of each other, Wood offered his readers lavishly illustrated books that transformed the entomologist into a natural theologian. In the preface to Insects Abroad Wood stated his two objects. First, in keeping with the goodness of divine design, he hoped "to show the great and important part played by Insects in the economy of the world, and the extreme value to mankind of those insects which we are accustomed to call Destructives." The creatures most detested by humans-mosquitoes, ants, and wood-boring beetles and termites-were actually among our greatest benefactors. According to Wood, insects were "working towards one purpose, namely, the gradual development of the earth and its resources."23 But insects were not just good in the larger scheme of things; they were also beautiful. The second object of Insects Abroad was to encourage readers to "note the wonderful modifications of structure which enable the insects to fulfil their mission, and the surpassing beauty with which many of them are endowed." Insects at Home also emphasized this theme. "We find among insects," Wood asserted, "a variety and brilliancy of colour that not even the most gorgeous tropical flowers can approach, and that some of our dullest and most insignificant little insects are, when placed under the revealing lens of the mi- croscope, absolutely blazing with natural jewellery."24 Throughout both books Wood drew the reader's attention to the beauty of insect bodies and wings, making good use of his many illustrations. The frontispiece to Insects Abroad depicted different species of beetles, including the large goliath beetle that dominated the lower half of the image. In contrast to the disembodied images of Common Objects of the Microscope, the illustrations in the insect books presented their subjects in a natural setting filled with lush vegetation and 22 Rev.

Here was what Darwin termed the "face of nature bright with gladness" so central to natural theology. The striking frontispiece to Insects at Home (Figure 1), rendered in vivid color, presented a variety of different insects, including one of Wood's favorites, the "handsome Great Green Grasshopper."25 It was no challenge for Wood to highlight the beauty of some butterflies, moths, and beetles. But he was not satisfied unless he could persuade his readers that nearly every insect was aesthetically pleasing in some way. Of the dragonfly depicted in Figure 1 of Plate VII of Insects Abroad Wood said, "It is really a most lovely insect, its wings glittering with iridescent hues of metallic purple, green, blue and gold." Even as Wood turned to insects commonly seen as ugly and disgusting, his "reverent eye" found something attrac- tive or wonderful to praise. A giant earwig, on the left near the bottom of Plate VII of Insects at Home, was described as a "fine insect," while the common earwig, on the left near the top, was shown with "its beautiful wings extended" (Figure 2). In this illustration Wood also included a field cockroach and its egg case (bottom left), a field cricket (just below the center), and a mole cricket (center bottom), which, he remarked, is "shaped wonderfully like the mole." In some cases Wood was forced to turn to the microscope for help in finding the element of beauty he wanted his readers to see in all insects. "When placed under the microscope," Wood declared, "the Flea really becomes an interesting insect, with some share of beauty about it." Though "singularly unpleasant" in a room, the gnat was "marvellously beautiful under the microscope." Wood recommended that the gnat be examined with a succession of powers, beginning at the lowest and ending at the highest, so that the observer could appreciate its beauties of detail "by degrees." "As dull and colourless as the Gnat may appear to the unaided eye," Wood announced, "it has only to be placed under the revealing glass of the microscope to blaze out in a magnificence which would pale all the fabled glories of Aladdin's fairy palace."26 RICHARD PROCTOR'S SPECTROSCOPIC VISION Whereas Wood attempted to train his reader' s "reverent eye," sometimes enhanced by the microscope, to see the hand of God in nature, Richard Proctor could not rely on the human eye alone. Human eyesight needed to be supplemented by the power of a newly developed scientific instrument in order to discern the full extent of God's universal design. Toward the end of the 1860s, just after William Huggins had successfully used an optical instru- ment, the spectroscope, to compare stellar and terrestrial spectra in an effort to determine the chemical composition of heavenly bodies, Proctor became enthusiastic about the future of astronomy. He judged the spectroscope to be "the most wonderful method of research yet invented by man," revealing a universe filled with inhabitable planets populated by 25 Near the beginning of Chapter 3 of the Origin of Species, titled "Struggle for Existence," Darwin declares, "We behold the face of nature bright with gladness, we often see superabundance of food; we do not see, or we forget, that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life": Darwin, Origin of Species, ed. Burrow (cit. n. 12), p. 116. Here Darwin is reminding his readers that natural theology's focus on "the face of nature bright with gladness" is one-sided in its ignorance of the struggle for existence. Beer has explored the connection between the "face of nature" metaphor, natural theology, and anthropomorphism in the Origin of Species; see Gillian Beer, " 'The Face of Nature': Anthropomorphic Elements in the Language of The Origin of Species," in Languages of Nature: Critical Essays on Science and Literature, ed.

For Proctor, pluralism and natural theology went hand in hand. Since God had created nature to fulfill a certain purpose, and since nature' s "great end" was "to afford scope and room for new forms of life, or to supply the wants of those which already exist," the most decisive proof of God's existence would lie in the discernment of the existence of alien life.27 In the late 1860s and early 1870s Proctor's potent mixture of natural the- ology, pluralism, and spectroscopic evidence found its strongest test in the case of Mars. In arguing for the existence of life on Mars, Proctor presented his reading audience with visual images constructed through mapping techniques borrowed from imperial geography. But the meaning of his Martian maps, Proctor insisted, could be interpreted only by bring- ing the spectroscope to bear. Richard Proctor (1837-1888) was a prolific author who by his death had become "the most widely read astronomical author in the English-speaking world."28 While Wood was active during the 1850s and 1860s, the younger Proctor did not embark on his career as a popularizer of science until the late 1860s. Both published throughout the 1870s and 1880s. A product of St. John's College, Cambridge, where he studied theology and mathematics, Proctor was forced to live by his pen when he incurred a huge debt as a result of a failed investment. In 1866 he was elected to the Royal Astronomical Society and later held the office of honorary secretary. Proctor's first major publishing success, Other Worlds Than Ours (1870), was followed by triumphant lecture tours of America and Australasia. In 1881 he founded the London scientific weekly Knowledge and the Illustrated Scientific News, which he edited until his death. But it was Proctor's participation in the extraterrestrial life debate that gained him his vast popularity with the reading audience. Proctor's scientific arguments for pluralism hinged on demonstrating the resemblances between earthly and celestial processes. The spectroscope's comparative analysis of the spectral lines produced by earthly substances and heavenly bodies was perfectly suited for such a task. Proctor held that the spectroscope proved that the earth, the other planets in the solar system, and the sun were constituted of the same materials. Furthermore, spectroscopic evidence pointed to a resemblance be- tween the sun and all the stars. Since he laid down as a general rule that the planets in each system are constituted of the same materials as the star around which they orbit, he concluded that all the planets in the universe resemble the earth in their physical compo- sition. Proctor, then, used the spectroscope to set up a series of analogies: he started with the earth-sun analogy, moved on to the sun-stars analogy and then the stars-planets anal- ogy, and ended with the earth-other planets analogy. If alien planets were like the earth in their physical composition, then they were capable of supporting life. Proctor used his spectroscope and his string of analogies to take his readers to the ends of the universe and back; they learned that it was a familiar place after all.29 In the late 1860s and early 1870s, Proctor thought Mars offered the best opportunity to demonstrate the existence of extraterrestrial life. In 1868 he declared that Mars was "the only object in the whole heavens which is known to exhibit features resembling those of our earth," and he believed that continents and oceans similar to those on Earth could be 27 Richard Proctor, Other Worlds Than Ours (New York: A.

One of Proctor's maps of Mars, the stereographic projection, with its Eurocentric nomenclature.

Proctor not only established the astronomical practice of using particular types of maps for visualizing Mars; he was the first to apply an imperial nomenclature to the Martian landscape. Other Worlds Than Ours contained a total of thirteen illustrations, all drawings, of which four were colored. Some of the colored illustrations, such as the frontispiece of Jupiter and the drawing of Saturn, were included to impress on the reader the beauty of the heavens. But two others, a map of Mars (Figure 3) and four drawings of Mars on a single page, were designed to do serious scientific work: they constituted the visual centerpiece for Proctor's proof that Mars could sustain life. Proctor was among the first to construct a complete map of the Martian globe. He announced its creation in an article titled "Lands and Seas of Another World," which was published in Fraser's Magazine in August 1868, though the illustration itself did not appear. In this article Proctor launched into a detailed discussion of the Martian oceans and continents depicted on his map, inventing a new 30 Richard Proctor, "Lands and Seas of Another World," Fraser's Magazine, 1868, 78:249-256, on p. 249. Crowe has examined how Proctor's views on extraterrestrial life changed after 1870. As Proctor moved away from the view that the majority of planets are inhabited to a theory of planetary evolution wherein each planet at some point in its history is life supporting, his position on Mars was less critical for his pluralism.

Press, 1986), pp. 367-377.</page><page sequence="17">666 VICTORIAN POPULARIZERS OF SCIENCE scientific discipline that he called "areography" (this term replaced the "geo" in "geogra- phy" with "areo," the Greek word for the planet Mars). The map did appear in one of Proctor's popular science books, Half-Hours with the Telescope, published in the same year as part of Robert Hardwicke's series of "Plain and Easy Books for Natural History Students."3' A number of the subtle links between photography and the discourse of imperial ge- ography that James Ryan uncovers in his excellent book Picturing Empire can be traced in Proctor's map. Just as English photographers and explorers named features of African geography after famous European scientists, monarchs, and explorers, Proctor named the Martian continents and oceans after European astronomers like William Dawes, Norman Lockyer, William Huggins, Johannes Kepler, and Pierre Simon Laplace. Rendering the surface features of Mars in the nomenclature of European authority transformed the strange Martian exterior into something familiar and Earth-like. The use of standard mapping techniques also confined the Martian environment in the constituent categories of European scientific knowledge. Just as Victorian photography and geographical maps enabled the earth to be reduced systematically to a uniform, two-dimensional projection that could be imaginatively seen, explored, and possessed, Proctor's map opened distant Mars to an expanding imperial gaze.32 Proctor also constructed a second map of Mars, an indication of the significance he attached to cartographical representation of the planet of war. The stereographic projection in Other Worlds Than Ours was traded for a Mercator projection in an article on Mars published in 1869 in the Popular Science Review. The same map was featured as the frontispiece of The Orbs Around Us (1872) (Figure 4), where the 1868 essay "Lands and Seas of Another World" was republished. As the first investigator to use these two pro- jections to visualize Mars, Proctor established a tradition in Martian cartography. The Mercator projection, conceived in the sixteenth century and used for navigation, emerged in the nineteenth century as the basis for world maps. Since the areas near the earth's poles are greatly distorted in a Mercator projection, an equal area projection supplemented it in more complete atlases-usually a world projection but occasionally the equatorial stere- ographic, portraying the Eastern and Western hemispheres. Relied upon almost exclusively for hemispheres, the stereographic projection remained popular in the mid-Victorian pe- riod, though its use was diminishing.33 What did Proctor have to gain from using two different forms of representation?

See Jiirgen Blunck, Mars and Its Satellites: A Detailed Commentary on the Nomenclature (Hicksville, N.Y.: Exposition, 1977), pp. 13, 177.

Until challenged in 1877 by Giovanni Schiaparelli, Proctor's Martian nomenclature was widely used by astronomers. Schiaparelli's system eventually prevailed in the late 1890s.

Proctor's "Chart of Mars on Mercator's Projection. (From Richard Proctor, The Orbs Around Us [London/New York. Longmans, Green, 1902], frontispiece.) widely used Mercator projection permitted accurate mapping of areas closest to the Martian equator (note the inclusion of degrees of latitude), where the most important continents were located. In the Mercator projection Dawes Continent becomes the center of the map, lending it coherence. Since the polar regions of the earth were still being explored during the nineteenth century, the clear emphasis on the equatorial center in the Mercator projec- tion of Mars would not have seemed peculiar to Victorian readers. The reason for Proctor's use of the less familiar stereographic projection will not become clear until we delve more deeply into how he justified the application of terrestrial mapping techniques to an alien planet. In his 1868 article Proctor began by referring to a globe, exhibited at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society by one of the fellows, John Browning (1835-1925), that depicted the land and seas of Mars as upon an ordinary terrestrial globe. Browning, an important London instrument maker, played a key role in promoting the use of the spec- troscope in astronomical research, and the spectroscopes he constructed were "the best obtainable in England in their day." Neither the origins of Browning's globe nor those of Proctor's stereographic chart are revealed in the article. They serve as independent veri- fications of one other. Two years later, in the chapter on Mars in Other Worlds Than Ours, Proctor again pointed to Browning's globe-and to Browning's publication of an inter- esting series of photographs of this globe that "give fine stereoscopic effects." Given the</page><page sequence="19">668 VICTORIAN POPULARIZERS OF SCIENCE key role that Crary has assigned to the stereoscope in the reorganization of vision in the nineteenth century, Proctor's reference to stereographs seems significant.34 Though origi- nally created for the purpose of scientific observation, the stereoscope was one of a number of optical devices also used for popular entertainment. By referring to stereographs, a familiar part of Victorian visual culture, Proctor could count on piquing the interest of his reading audience. Moreover, he could use the stereographs as evidence for the accuracy of his cartographic representations of Mars. In their discussion of the unique status of stereographs, Thomas Hankins and Robert Silverman have noted that whereas human hands could tamper with ordinary photographs, stereographs were supposedly direct rep- resentations of nature. Proctor offered the existence of two sorts of visual images, stere- ographs of Mars and the globe from which they were derived, as one more tangible bit of proof that terrestrial mapping techniques could be applied with success to the red planet. But this was not his most important piece of evidence, for he revealed in Other Worlds Than Ours that the ultimate source of Browning's globe was none other than his own chart.35 Proctor's claim for the precision of his maps rested on the accuracy of the drawings of Mars by the astronomer William Dawes (1799-1868) and was supported by spectroscopic evidence. A member of the Royal Astronomical Society and a winner of its gold medal, Dawes was well known for his research into double stars and Saturn's rings. In choosing to base his maps on a series of drawings by Dawes, Proctor had selected visual evidence prepared by an astronomer whose skill and honesty were unimpeachable. Proctor reported that Dawes had given him a total of twenty-seven drawings of Mars, the "choicest speci- mens of a very large series, that I might chart the planet from them."36 But were Dawes's pictures necessarily accurate? Even trustworthy observers had been known to be wrong, particularly when it came to Mars. Proctor acknowledged the difficulty of ascertaining the real features of Mars, which presents "a continually varying configu- ration to the observer on earth." He proposed a test for determining whether details on drawings corresponded to real features on the planet's surface. If "features which present no apparent resemblance are found to resolve themselves into the same well-marked ocean or continent," Proctor declared, "when each is brought to the centre of the planet's disc," then they are genuine. Dawes's pictures passed this test with flying colors, at least in Proctor's estimation. "The numerous details on Mr. Dawes' drawings being shown in this way to correspond to real features on the planet's surface," he asserted, "it became feasible to construct a chart which should represent all these features exactly as oceans and con- tinents are represented in the maps and hemispheres which usually accompany terrestrial atlases." Proctor reproduced four of Dawes's pictures in Other Worlds Than Ours on the page previous to his map (Figure 5). He selected these four because together they provided an accurate depiction of the entire globe: the "features just coming into view in one are just passing away in the next."37 34 Proctor, "Lands and Seas of Another World" (cit. n. 30), p. 249; Anon., "John Browning," Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 1930, 90:359-362, on p. 360; and Proctor, Other Worlds Than Ours (cit. n. 27), p. 92.

Proctor then asserted a direct correspondence between the drawings and his stereographic map. The map distilled the drawings' surplus details into continents and bodies of water: Proctor made entities stand out by marking discrete borders, homogenizing textures within the boundaries of coherent things, and resolving points of overlap and ambiguity.38 His de- cision to use the less popular stereographic map, rather than relying just on the Mercator projection, becomes understandable in light of his strategic pairing of a map with Dawes's drawings. It was far easier for his readers to compare Dawes's globe-shaped drawings to the stereographic map. But Proctor's argument for the Earth-like environment on Mars was not yet complete. After presenting his maps and establishing them as accurate representations of Dawes's (likewise) accurate representations of Mars in his drawings, Proctor still had to interpret what Dawes's pictures meant for understanding the Martian surface. Here he drew on spectroscopic results to supplement his other evidence. Proctor believed that the spectro- scope confirmed that different colors correspond to different surface features: the dark spots on Dawes's drawings are seas, the light ochre-colored spots continents. "The stron- gest argument in support of a similarity in general physical relations between Mars and our own earth," Proctor affirmed, "is drawn from the revelations which have been afforded by the spectroscope." After a discussion of Huggins's recent paper on the spectrum of Mars, which showed that the atmosphere contained gases and vapors corresponding to those present on Earth, Proctor concluded that the atmosphere "most probably resembles our own in general constitution." Who can doubt, he asked, that the "Martial lands are nourished by refreshing rainfalls; and who can doubt that they are thus nourished for the same purposes as our own fields and forests-namely that vegetation of all sorts may grow abundantly?"39 Proctor's use of a pair of visual images, supported by chains of analogies and spectro- scopic research, to persuade his audience that celestial phenomena are familiar and Earth- like is not so unusual. It is a classic case of how representations of nature can function effectively, almost magically, as visual rhetoric. As Michael Lynch and Steve Woolgar observe, "to analyze representation is to expose the conjurer's tricks through which chains and networks of similitude are laboriously built-up and then 'forgotten' in the presumptive adequacy of their reference to an 'original.' " Proctor's maps so charmed his contempo- raries that the chief criticism from European scientists, according to Michael Crowe, con- 38 Proctor's use of Dawes's drawings is similar to the sophistical visual rhetoric deployed by scientists who present photodiagrams in pairs in their research reports and didactic texts, a technique Michael Lynch has deconstructed with great success. Lynch's scientists use this pictorial mode of argumentative persuasion-one of many at their disposal-to convince their professional colleagues, but Proctor presented it to his popular audience. Though Proctor did not make use of a photograph, Dawes's drawings played a similar rhetorical role. Pang has shown that during the 1860s and 1870s, a period of great instability in imaging technologies, drawings and photographs had the same status in Victorian astronomy. It was not until the 1880s and 1890s that astron- omers began to favor the mechanical system of making and copying photographs over drawing.

Proctor's deft sleight of hand, the application of terrestrial terms like "oceans" and "inlets" to features hardly discernible on the Martian surface, was not widely challenged.40 Skillful marshaling of illustrations and use of the spectroscope to supplement the human eye provided compelling support for his pluralistic natural theology. British and American audiences remained under its spell into the early twentieth century: the last editions of Other Worlds Than Ours appeared in 1909. AGNES CLERKE AND THE CHEMICAL RETINA In her best-selling Popular History of Astronomy during the Nineteenth Century (1885), Agnes Clerke noted that "the first really good map of Mars was constructed in 1869 by Proctor from drawings by Dawes." The map did not convince Clerke that life existed on Mars, and she was never an enthusiastic pluralist like Proctor. Yet in her many books and essays Clerke, a devout Catholic, presented a form of natural theology to the Victorian reading audience, as had Wood and Proctor. One of her central goals as a popularizer was to spell out the religious implications of the "new astronomy," which, through the appli- cation of new scientific instruments such as the spectroscope and the camera, had revo- lutionized the study of the heavens. Clerke held that spectacular photographic images best demonstrated the recent advances of astronomical science. Her interest in the camera led her to understand the important role of illustrations in science and increased her awareness of the reorganization of vision. Though Clerke attempted to train her audience to see the universe through Wood's "reverent eye" and took advantage of Proctor's spectroscopic vision, she privileged the insights of the photographic lens over the "fallible human ret- ina. "41 Agnes Clerke (1842-1907) burst upon the popular science scene in the mid 1880s, as Wood and Proctor neared their deaths. Active up until the middle of the first decade of the twentieth century, she was one of the great popularizers of science in the late Victorian period. Best-selling astronomy books and articles for periodicals, the Dictionary of Na- tional Biography, and the Encyclopaedia Britannica poured from her prolific pen. Clerke worked within a fairly well-defined female tradition of popularizing science. Like her sisters in science before her, she functioned as an educator, moralist, and religious teacher who explained new views of the physical and natural world to women, children, and the working classes. But as Clerke learned more about astronomy, she began to work on projects that were less accessible to a popular audience. Recognizing that the growth of specialization left isolated researchers in need of synthesis, she posed in her later works as an interpreter of the larger meaning of recent astronomical discoveries for professional astronomers.42 One of the few women during the nineteenth century to gain partial ad- mission into the male-dominated astronomical world, Clerke was elected an honorary member of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1903. 40 Michael Lynch and Steve Woolgar, "Introduction: Sociological Orientations to Representational Practice in Science," in Representation in Scientific Practice, ed.

She referred to it as "an encroaching instrument," asserting that once it gained a "foothold in any field of research" the camera "advances to occupy the whole, either as adjunct or principal." In solar eclipses, for ex- ample, telescopic and direct spectroscopic observations "are now altogether subordinate in importance to photographic records of them." Though Clerke recognized that in the past the accuracy of astronomical photography had suffered owing to difficulties related to distortion, she believed that for the most part astronomers had solved these problems and could now look forward to dramatic progress. Photography was the key to present and future advances in astronomical science. "The whole future of astronomy has indeed come to depend on the validity of photographic evidence," Clerke declared, "and specialties of manipulation and development, the idiosyncrasies of variously prepared plates, [and] the shrinkage of gelatine films."43 Throughout her career as a popularizer of science, one of Clerke's central goals was to bring the stunning results of astrophotography before the eyes of the public. Though the camera was already widely accepted as a legitimate scientific tool by 1875, when the gelatine dry plate was introduced, doubts within the astronomical community about the benefits of using it to resolve visual disagreements were not fully laid to rest until about the time Clerke began publishing her popular astronomy books in the mid 1880s. Astronomers were abandoning composite pictures, which combined the best fea- tures of photographs and drawings, for an increasingly mechanical system of making and copying photographs. But challenges to the camera's general scientific authority were voiced right up to the end of the century.44 Clerke could not assume that a popular audience would accept the trustworthiness of astronomical photography as a given. Clerke's use of photographic images served to reinforce the authority of the camera in astronomical science. She was among the first to present astronomical photos as book illustrations, and over the years she tended to increase the number of photos in her new books and in new editions of old publications. A Popular History of Astronomy is a case in point. The first edition (1885) contained no photographs, but in the second edition, two years later, Clerke included three. Two of the photographs (of Jupiter and Saturn) appeared on the title page, and the third, Thomas Common's photograph of the great nebula in Orion, served as the frontispiece. In the third edition of A Popular History, published in 1893, Clerke added five more photographs, including G. E. Hale's photoheliographs of solar prominences, William and Margaret Huggins's spectrum of Nova Aurigae, and E. E. Barnard's famous photograph of the Milky Way in Sagittarius. Clerke not only led the way in incorporating photographs into popular science; she also presented them as a demonstration of the accuracy and utility of the camera.

The measuring grid subtly reminded readers that astrophotos were valued for their "capability of exact measurement," not just their beauty. Clerke also included photographs of spectra, or spectrographs, in her books to emphasize the crucial role of the camera in interpreting data produced by the spectroscope. The "examination of spectra through the medium of the camera does not supersede, but essentially completes their direct obser- vation," Clerke argued, "the 'chemical retina' being mainly affected by impressions to which the eye is blind."45 In the second edition of The System of the Stars, published in 1905, nine of the twenty plates were photographs of stellar spectra. The authority of the camera served to bolster Clerke's authority as a popularizer of science. This was particularly important for a woman who had no formal university edu- cation in mathematics or science, who had no regular access to a powerful telescope, and who could not claim to have conducted original research. If the widespread dissemination of astronomical photographs, coupled with a sophisticated interpretation of their signifi- cance, could be seen as an important contribution to the field, then Clerke could overcome the obstacles women faced in becoming valued members of the male-dominated astro- nomical community. It is clear from Clerke's unpublished correspondence that she care- fully cultivated the friendship of those astronomers who could become sources for the latest, most exciting photographs.46 Clerke established a special relationship with Edward S. Holden, director of the Lick Observatory, and corresponded regularly with his successors J. E. Keeler and W. W. Campbell. She also maintained close contact with other important American astronomers like George Ellery Hale and E. C. Pickering. Holden sought her opinion on how to use images to understand the structure of nebulae, star clusters, and other astronomical phe- nomena. In 1889, for example, he sent Clerke one of the first of Barnard's famous pho- tographs of Milky Way fields and asked for her reaction. Clerke noticed an interesting connection between this photo and one by Isaac Roberts of the great nebula in Andromeda. If you hold Barnard's picture back from the eye, Clerke told Holden, the lines of Roberts's picture appear. "In fact," she declared, "this picture might be called the key to the other," for Barnard's photograph revealed what the Andromeda nebula would look like after the lapse of ages. "Not a mere solar system," Clerke wrote, "but just a stupendous stellar collection is forming from it. If this be so, the revelation is of far-reaching significance."47 Drawing on her knowledge of recently produced astronomical photographs, Clerke' s abil- ity to cross-reference images provided her with a method for interpreting complex images. Thanks to her analytic skills, Clerke was often the first in England to see the most spec- tacular triumphs of the Lick Observatory's photographic telescope. She had her pick of the latest, most interesting images for her books, and the association of her work with the respected names of those who contributed photographs could only help to establish her as an important astronomical authority.48 45 Clerke, "Sidereal Photography" (cit. n. 43), p. 24; and Agnes Clerke, "The Evolution of the Stars," Edinburgh Rev., 1900, 191:455-477, on p. 456. 46 M.

In the second edition of the same work, published fifteen years later, she expressed her gratitude to Gill, Hale, Pickering, Campbell, and Barnard, among others, for the use of photographs, most of which were entirely new.</page><page sequence="25">674 VICTORLAN POPULARIZERS OF SCIENCE L __ . _ .l . _ ._ _ _ _ z . . _ _ . z z _ _ _ I - _ 1J1 I I * ri _s' _ l. .

Clerke, Problems in Astrophysics [London: Adam and Charles Black, 1903], frontispiece.)</page><page sequence="26">BERNARD LIGHTMAN 675 An authoritative chemical retina could produce images that demonstrated the design and order in the limitless regions of space. This was a godsend for a natural theologian like Clerke, who saw the workings of a Supreme Power in all celestial phenomena. In The System of the Stars Clerke included a photo of the great nebula in Andromeda (Figure 7) and suggested that the image helped astronomers make sense of what had hitherto been an enigma. "The view given by this magnificent picture of the Andromeda nebula as a symmetrical, though still inchoate structure," she observed, "ploughed up by tremendous, yet not undisciplined forces, working harmoniously towards the fulfillment of some ma- jestic design of the Master Builder of the universe, is of a nature to modify profoundly our notions as to how such designs obtain their definitive embodiment."49 Clerke was able to reinscribe traditional concepts of natural theology into astronomy through the use of the most up-to-date technology. Clerke was particularly excited by plans for an international charting project, which for her not only symbolized the power and legitimacy of photographic methods in astronomy but also promised to reveal as never before the divine design of the heavens. In the Ed- inburgh Review she announced the results of the Astrographic Congress that met in Paris in April 1887 to organize a "photographic survey on a grand scale of the entire heavens." According to Clerke, the fifty-five delegates from fifteen different countries were so im- pressed by astronomical photography that they overcame national rivalries to "set prepa- rations on foot for the charting of over twenty millions of stars." The international project was to involve twenty-one observatories from around the world and called for a total of forty-five thousand plates to be taken.50 Just as photography became part of nineteenth- century imperial geography's cartographic ambition to, as James Ryan puts it, "explore and fill in all the blank spaces on the world map," the camera was seen by Clerke and other astronomers as the key to filling in all the blank spaces on the cosmic map that came to be known as the Carte du Ciel. Clerke expected that the project would take many years to complete and estimated that "about the year 2000 A.D. the seed planted in our time will have begun to bear fruit." But in "shooting for the stars" the astronomers had overreached themselves, and the Carte du Ciel remains unfinished to this day.51 Clerke knew that the Carte du Ciel would not be completed in her lifetime, and yet she wanted to inspire her audience to imagine just how spectacular the final result would be. The Carte du Ciel would resemble nothing less than the ultimate panorama: it would give the astronomer a God's-eye view of the entire universe. Who knew what evidences of 49 Agnes M. Clerke, The System of the Stars, 2nd ed. (London: Adam and Charles Black, 1905), p. 259. See also Lightman, "Constructing Victorian Heavens" (cit. n. 42), p. 67. 50 Clerke, "Sidereal Photography" (cit. n. 43), p. 36. There is some disagreement as to whether the Carte du Ciel represented a strong vote of confidence in astronomical photography. Herbert Hall Turner, Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, later regarded the international project as symbolic of the end of distrust in the accuracy of astronomical photography, a view echoed by Rothermel: Herbert Hall Turner, Modern Astronomy: Being Some Account of the Revolution of the Last Quarter of a Century (Westminster: Archibald Constable, 1902), p. 157 (which also notes the extent of the project); and Rothermel, "Images of the Sun" (cit. n. 44), p. 138. Norman, however, asserts that owing to the considerable doubt still expressed "as to the freedom from distortion of photographic emulsions," the Astrographic Congress decided that "an accurate r6seau should be applied pho- tographically to every plate taken": Daniel Norman, "The Development of Astronomical Photography," Osiris, 1938, 5:560-594, on p. 588. 5' Ryan, Picturing Empire (cit. n. 32), p. 23; and Clerke, "Sidereal Photography," p. 40. The international congress of 1887 actually planned two projects, the Carte du Ciel (which was to chart the entire sky down to the 14th magnitude) and the Astrographic Catalogue (which involved the compilation of a catalogue of the positions of all stars of the 11th magnitude and brighter to an accuracy of 0.5 arcsecond). For an account of how the Astrographic Catalogue was successfully completed see Sean E. Urban and Thomas E. Corbin, "The Astro- graphic Catalogue: A Century of Work Pays Off," Sky and Telescope, 1998, 95(6):41-44.</page><page sequence="27">676 VICTORIAN POPULARIZERS OF SCIENCE I. Figure 7. Photograph of a spiral nebula, the great nebula in Andromeda, by Dr. Max Wolf. Clerke pointed to the symmetrical shape of this nebula as evidence for divine design. (From Agnes M. Clerke, The System of the Stars, 2nd edition [London: Adam and Charles Black, 1905], page 260, Plate XIII.) design would be made visible to the human eye by this cosmic chemical retina? "When the photographic survey of the heavens is completed," Clerke mused, "conclusions of reasonable certainty on some fundamental points connected with the galactic structure will be within comparatively easy reach." The photographic survey would reveal "the laws governing the stellar commonwealth" by providing "extended knowledge" on the move- ments of the stars. Then "the motion-harmonies of the Cosmos will begin to sound intel- ligibly in the ears of humanity."52 If the Carte du Ciel symbolized the coming of age of the camera in astronomy and its 52 Agnes Clerke, "A Southern Observatory," Contemporary Review, 1895, 55:380-392, esp. p. 390 (inspira- tion); and Clerke, "Sidereal Photography," pp. 38, 39-40, 40.</page><page sequence="28">BERNARD LIGHTMAN 677 divine mission, it also signaled the eclipse of the human eye as the pre-eminent organ of truth. In Problems in Astrophysics Clerke argued that the telescopically enhanced human eye was ineffectual for an examination of subjects like the physics of the Milky Way. To capture the "colossal forms into which these stellar units are grouped," a canvas of "at least 100 square degrees must be available. Hence telescopes of the ordinary type, however powerful, are, for this purpose, entirely useless."53 On the following page she assaulted the senses of her readers with one of Barnard's photographs of the Milky Way-a picture stunning to late nineteenth-century eyes unaccustomed to such detailed astronomical im- ages-which underscored the vastness of this galaxy and the camera's ability to represent it faithfully. Not only was the human eye limited in its perception of scale and scope; there was also the issue of detail. Clerke constantly compared the power of the camera to the fallible human eye. Since the invention of gelatine dry plates, she wrote, the uses of the camera have "multiplied at a prodigious rate." As a result, "there are very few departments of astronomy left in which the eye has the advantage over it." While impressions faded from the organic retina after "one-tenth part of a second, leaving it a continually renewed tabula rasa," sensitized gelatine film possessed a retentive power. With no limits set to the time of useful exposure, light rays continue to impinge upon it, and "all the orders of the stars, all the secrets of the sky, disclose themselves to its patient stare." Common's photograph of the great nebula in Orion, which served as the frontispiece for A Popular History of Astronomy from the second preface on, symbolized for Clerke the superiority of the chem- ical retina to the human eye, even aided by the telescope (Figure 8). According to Daniel Norman, this photograph was probably the first to show a marked superiority to visual observations.54 But Clerke's reservations about the human eye's role in astronomy went much deeper than a recognition of its inability to perceive the big picture or significant details. She was also concerned about the unreliability of human perception more generally. Clerke's fas- cination with the camera and her critique of human perception point to the debt she owed to the reorganization of vision that took place in the nineteenth century. Because Crary asserts that the uprooting of the classical model of the observer took place prior to the appearance of photography, he does not discuss the camera at length, though he places it with instruments emblematic of the reorientation. Other scholars have shown, however, that by the close of the century photographs were seen as superior to anything produced by unaided human vision because the camera's mechanically produced images supposedly eliminated human intervention between nature and representation.55 The discovery in the early nineteenth century that human vision is flawed and subject to deception led to a yearning for an arbiter of truth that bypassed the fallible human senses. Like other scientists, Clerke pictured the camera as an instrument that can produce 53 Clerke, Problems in Astrophysics (cit. n. 41), p. 539. 54 Agnes Clerke, "Section I: History," in Clerke, A.

She claimed that the alliance of astronomy with photography carried sci- entists "deeper into the secrets of nature" because "the impersonal method confers a cer- tainty and power in dealing with obscure phenomena which can only in special cases be claimed for the eye." In a discussion of the use of photography in spectroscopic analysis, Clerke declared that photographic records are "objectively true; they escape the influence of subjective bias and personal error, and largely eliminate the effects of air tremors that baffle the eye in its efforts to interpret delicate spectral details."156 The chemical retina produced valuable scientific documents that were immutable and mobile. Since photographic records are permanent, Clerke declared, "they can be measured at leisure, consulted again and again, and examined at long intervals, for the resolution of questions that had not yet arisen when they were obtained." Photographs are therefore the "fittest means for collecting statistics of the heavens." For Clerke, the "patient stare" of the chemical retina produced permanent records of aspects of nature that could not be seen by human eyesight, even if enhanced by the telescope. It also revealed the invisible hand of God in the unalterable laws that guided the heavens "towards the continually more perfect embodiment of the unfolding Eteral Thought."57 S6 Clerke, Problems in Astrophysics (cit. n. 41), p. 5; and Clerke, "Evolution of the Stars" (cit. n. 45), p. 459. 57 Clerke, "Evolution of the Stars," p. 459; Clerke, Problems in Astrophysics, p. 5; and Clerke, System of the Stars, 2nd ed.

Clerke' s readers would have known that theories concerning the nature of the Orion nebula had been at the heart of an earlier debate between astronomers over the legitimacy of the nebular hypothesis, with its links to radical materialism. The Orion nebula was one of the most contentious astronomical objects in the nineteenth-century sky. As the frontispiece to a book that aimed to help readers "towards a fuller understanding of the manifold works which have in all ages irresistibly spoken to man of the glory of God," Common's photograph not only displayed the superiority of the chemical retina; it was also appropriated by Clerke to illustrate that astrophotography was unambiguously on the side of the angels.58 CONCLUSION: VICTORIAN VISUAL CULTURE AND SCIENTIFIC IMAGES The emergence of a mass visual culture presented popularizers of science with new op- portunities for preserving natural theology within science. Wood's impromptu lecture sketches and the elaborate illustrations of insects in his books were intended to attract his audience to the beauty and wonder of the natural world, as were his references to and illustrations of the hidden worlds revealed by the microscope. With the introduction of new visual technologies, such as those based on the spectroscope and the camera, popu- larizers had at their disposal even more opportunities for reinscribing natural theology into science. New visual technologies produced new kinds of images, and the Victorian audi- ence required instruction in reading them. Proctor and Clerke offered themselves as reliable interpreters of visual images that pointed to the hand of God in nature. Clerke used pho- tographs obtained from leading astronomers, while Proctor himself created a series of maps of Mars based on drawings by Dawes and confirmed by spectroscopic research. Produced by privileged scientific instruments that avoided intervention by the imperfect human senses, these images were, they argued, indubitably accurate and objective. In the Origin of Species Darwin relied on colorful literary images to compensate for the flawed vision of the entangled eye. Since there was no chemical retina available to Darwin, there could be no hope that an evolutionary equivalent to the Carte du Ciel, a compre- hensive mapping of the development of species, would ever be completed. But it is striking that even though Darwin perceived his "entangled eye" as replacing the "reverent eye" of natural theology, Agnes Clerke agreed with him on the status of human vision. The re- organization of vision discussed by Crary followed at least two trajectories in nineteenth- century England. Clerke's human retina was as flawed and limited as Darwin's nonom- niscient narrative eye. But although Clerke diverged from Paley's emphasis on the eye as an organ of perfection, she remained within the natural theology tradition. The develop- ment of the "reverent eye" into the "chemical retina" from Wood through Proctor to Clerke demonstrates how that tradition was refashioned in light of the reorganization of vision, just as Darwin's entangled eye represented a synthesis of a new model of vision with the evolutionary tradition. The reorganization of vision and the formation of a new visual culture challenged sci- entists and popularizers of science to come up with new ways of maintaining the authority of science without resorting to a simplistic empiricism based on the primacy of the human 58 Clerke, Popular History of Astronomy (cit. n. 41), p. vi.

It also led to the use of elaborate visual language and visual images. Popularizers within the natural theology tradition used visual images to cultivate in their readers the "gift of eyesight," so cherished by Jefferys Taylor, so that they could see the larger religious significance of science. Their use of images was designed to open up hidden worlds of wonder for their audience-worlds scientific professionals ignored, blinded as they were by their increasingly secular and specialized vision, or by their entangled eyes.</page></plain_text>
