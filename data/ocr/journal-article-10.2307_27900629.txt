<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. LEIBNIZ AND LOCKE. John Locke, the founder of the sensationalist school, who form ulated the principle of his philosophy in the statement Nihil est in intellectu quod non antea fuerit in sensu, and who therefore on the one hand denied innate ideas and on the other claimed that all knowledge rises from experience, devotes to an investigation of truth Chapter V, and also part of Chapter VI of his famous work On the Human Understanding from which we make the following extracts : " 'What is truth ?' was an inquiry many ages since ; and it being that which all mankind either do or pretend to search after, it cannot but be worth our while carefully to examine wherein it consists ; and so acquaint ourselves with the nature of it, as to observe how the mind distinguishes it from falsehood. "Truth then seems to me, in the proper import of the word, to signify nothing but the joining or separating of signs, as the things signified by them do agree or disagree one with another. The join ing or separating of signs here meant, is what by another name we call 'proposition/ So that truth properly belongs only to propo sitions : whereof there are two sorts, viz., mental and verbal ; as there are two sorts of signs commonly made use of, viz., ideas and words... "We must, I say, observe two sorts of propositions that we are capable of making: "First, Mental, wherein the ideas in our understandings are, without the use of words, put together or separated by the mind perceiving or judging of their agreement or disagreement. "Secondly, Verbal propositions, which are words, the signs of our ideas, put together or separated in affirmative or negative sen tences. By which way of affirming or denying, these signs, made by sounds, are, as it were, put together or separated one from an</page><page sequence="2">138 THE MONIST. other. So that proposition consists in joining or separating these signs, according as the things which they stand for agree or dis agree. ... "When ideas are so put together or separated in the mind, as they or the things they stand for do agree or not, that is, as I may call it 'mental truth/ But truth of words is something more, and that is the affirming or denying of words of another, as the ideas they stand for agree or disagree: and this again is twofold; either purely verbal and trifling or real and instructive, which is the object of real knowledge.... "Though our words signify nothing but our ideas, yet being designed by them to signify things, the truth they contain, when put into propositions, will be only verbal when they stand for ideas in the mind have not an agreement with the reality of things. And therefore truth, as well as knowledge, may well come under the distinction 'verbal' and 'real'; that being only verbal truth wherein terms are joined according to the agreement or disagree ment of the ideas they stand for, without regarding whether our ideas are such as really have or are capable of having an existence in nature. But then it is they contain real truth when these signs are joined as our ideas agree; and when our ideas are such as we know are capable of having an existence in nature: which in sub stances we cannot know but by knowing that such have existed. "Truth is the marking down in words the agreement or dis agreement of ideas as it is. Falsehood is the marking down in words the agreement or disagreement of ideas otherwise than it is. And so far as these ideas thus marked by sounds agree to their arche types, so far only is the truth real. The knowledge of this truth consists in knowing what ideas the words stand for, and the per ception of the agreement or disagreement of those ideas, according as it is marked by those words.... "Certainty is twofold; certainty of truth, and certainty of knowledge. Certainty of truth is, when words are so put to gether in propositions as exactly to express the agreement or dis agreement of the ideas they stand for, as really it is. Certainty of knowledge is, to perceive the agreement or disagreement of ideas, as expressed in any proposition. This we usually call 'knowing/ or 'being certain of the truth of any proposition.' " His great critic Leibniz wrote a voluminous book1 to refute ?New Essays Concerning Human Understanding, Translated by A. G. Langley. 2d ed., Chicago and London, 1916.</page><page sequence="3">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. Locke's sensationalism, pointing out that what Locke called re flection was not a product of sensation. He amended Locke's prin ciple to read : Nihil est in intellectu quod non antea fuerit in sensu, nisi intellectus ipse, and this amendment upset Locke's very lucid but superficial arguments. According to Leibniz the senses furnish us the material for positive knowledge but they offer nothing but particular instances, not methods, nor principles, nor general truths. Brutes have the same sensations as man, but brutes can never attain to necessary propositions. These conceptions of necessary propo sitions are innate in the human mind. The human mind is not a tabula rasa, but contains certain principles which, in the measure that experience furnishes the occasion, develop into ideas of eternal and necessary verities. From this standpoint Leibniz distinguishes two kinds of truths, necessary truths and contingent truths; the former are the eternal verities as instanced by mathematics, the latter the knowledge of par ticular facts furnished by experience. God is the ultimate source of both kinds of truth; the eternal verities correspond to his in tellect, the contingent truths to his will. The former are such and can not be different because God is such ; the latter could be different but are not because God willed them to be as they are and not other wise. Necessary truths reveal to us what is possible and what impos sible. Thus,e.g.,a regular decahedron (i.e., a figure bounded by ten equal plane surfaces) is impossible, and "all intelligible ideas have their archetype in the eternal possibilities of things." In reply to Locke's view of certainty, Leibniz says : "Our certitude would be small, or rather nothing, if it had no other basis of simple ideas than that which comes from the senses. Have you forgotten, sir, how I have shown that ideas are originally in our mind, and that indeed our thoughts come to us from the depths of our own nature, other creatures being unable to have an immediate influence upon the soul? Besides, the ground of our certitude in regard to universal and eternal truths is in the ideas themselves, independently of the senses, just as ideas pure and in telligible do not depend on the senses, for example, those of being, unity, identity, etc. But the ideas of sensible qualities, as color, savor, etc., (which in reality are only phantasms) come to us from the senses, i. e., from our confused perceptions. And the basis of the truth of contingent and particular things is in the succession</page><page sequence="4">140 THE MONIST. which causes these phenomena of the senses to be rightly united as the intelligible truths demand." It is not our intention to criticize any one of the philosophers but we wish to point out how far and in what respect we agree with Leibniz's views as here outlined. We select Leibniz because his philosophy is less onesided than any other and has incorporated all considerations, religious, scientific, mathematical and historical. What he calls innate ideas reflecting the eternal and necessary truths whose source lies in God, we denote as the purely formal and we have shown that purely formal conceptions have been gained by abstraction. Man alone has the faculty of abstraction and so he alone is capable of producing and operating with purely formal con ceptions such as numbers, geometrical figures, the notion of mathe matical or pure space, logical syllogisms, the formulas of causation and of the conservation of substance and energy. The principle pervading the function of these concepts is called reason, and reason truly reflects the cosmic order, which is due to the efficiency of purely formal interrelations?the so-called purely formal laws. Our senses furnish us particulars only, and these particulars, which are innumerable isolated sense-impressions, would remain a chaos of disconnected items if they were not classified and systematized ac cording to purely formal laws. The point overlooked by Leibniz and also later on by Kant is the question as to the origin of mind. The framework of reason, man's logical faculty, his notion of numbers and of space relations have indeed originated through ex perience as Locke claimed, but it was experience in a wider sense than either Locke or Leibniz conceived it to be. Experience in those days meant sense-experience, or the purely sensory element of sen tient creatures. In this sense Leibniz is right that no amount of sense-impressions can bring forth an eternal or universal or neces sary idea. Locke on the other hand, conscious of the fact that man was in possession of universal and necessary concepts and admitting no other source of knowledge than experience, insisted on the prop osition that all ideas, even the most complicated ones, were derived from sensations, as which he understands experience to be. Now it is obvious that there is nothing purely sensory, Sen sations are possessed of forms and the formal impresses itself to gether with sense impressions upon sentient creatures. We have on</page><page sequence="5">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. HI other occasions set forth how sensory impressions are by a mechan ical necessity so grouped that they are registered together, the par ticular ones being subsumed under the more general so that all of them build up a well-arranged system constituting a logical frame work of types. This framework is the mind which is built up not of mere sensations, but of the interrelations of sense-impressions according to their various forms. Experience in the current sense includes the form of the sensory, and in this sense the faculty of conceiving purely formal relations has indeed arisen from expe rience. The sensationalist school identifies the sense element of our knowledge with the formal and overlooks their radical difference. We must insist against the sensationalist school that everything formal is radically different from the sensory. The sensory is al ways particular while the formal can be generalized. By leaving out of sight everything particular our thought can operate in a field of pure relations, and we can exhaust all their possibilities. We can say what is possible as well as what is impossible and (all inter ference of unexpected particulars^being excluded) we can also say what result will always be obtained under definite given conditions. We can exhaust all possibilities of the purely formal and can sys tematize the whole field. What will always be, is called "necessary," and so these propositions which are inevitable are called by Leibniz "eternal truths." We agree with Leibniz that the source of these eternal truths is God; nay we go one step further in definiteness and claim that the eternal verities, of which our human notions of eternal truths are mental reflections, are God himself. All depends on our defi nition of God. Together with the whole cosmic order the necessary truths constitute an eternal omnipresence, an efficient system of norms which mould the world and determine all things. They form a kind of spiritual, or purely formal organism, a superpersonal presence which is the ultimate raison d'?tre and determinant of all things, the cosmos in its entirety as well as all particular events that happen in the course of its being. Any one who has once grasped the deep significance of the purely formal will have liberated his mind forever of the super stitious, mystical or allegorical conceptions of the deity, but he will at the same time understand the truth that underlies the God-idea and thus he will know the real nature of the true God, whose exist</page><page sequence="6">142 THE MONIST. ence is not a matter of belief, but a scientific certainty. All former proofs of the existence of God were necessarily failures, because in all cases the attempt was made to prove the existence of an anthro pomorphic God with arguments that prove the true God, the eternal norm of being, and here the argument breaks down, because it no longer applies to the idea of an anthropomorphic God. Leibniz has not overcome the mystical conception both of God and truth. He has unfortunately adopted the very primitive con ception of an atomic nature of reality which is described in his monadology. It is strange that a man of his caliber did not see how contradictory is the idea of God as the central monad. On the other hand his theory is vindicated if we interpret his God to be the universal and omnipresent norm that regulates every event and constitutes the cosmic order of the world. Insisting on the unity of the soul, Leibniz conceived all unities as local units, and these innumerable local units, the monads, were conceived as centers of force endowed with feeling and an entelechy, which means that they were capable of pursuing purposes. At the same time Leibniz held them to be separate entities, so as to render their cohesion and interaction a profound problem which could be solved only by the bold hypothesis of the preestablished harmony. The problem of unity together with all problems of combina tion and configuration belongs in the domain of pure form. Com bination of several parts working in cooperation constitute a unity and introduce something new. It did not exist before and will break to pieces again, but the law of its combination remains forever and constitutes the eternal background of its existence. The sensation alist school misses the main point of all philosophical considerations and thus loses the essence of the significance of religion ; but Leib niz who discovers the weak spot in their arguments has not suc ceeded in persenting a satisfactory solution of the problem but ends in proclaiming a mystical God-conception and a dogmatic proclama tion of a preestablished harmony. p. c. xCf.
