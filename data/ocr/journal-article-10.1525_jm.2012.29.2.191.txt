<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Brahms Rhapsodizing:  The Alto Rhapsody  and Its Expressive  Double ChRISTOPhER REyNOlDS For Donald C. Johns Biographers have always recognized the Alto  Rhapsody to be one of Brahms’s most personal works; indeed, both  the composer and Clara Schumann left several unusually specific com- ments that suggest that this poignant setting of Goethe’s text about a  lonely, embittered man had a particular significance for Brahms. Clara 191 wrote in her diary that after her daughter Julie Schumann announced  her engagement to an Italian count on 11 July 1869, Brahms suddenly  began behaving differently: “Johannes is quite transformed; he seldom  comes to the house and is monosyllabic.”1 Soon after the marriage on  The first half of this study began as a talk, “Brahms’s Forlorn  Wedding Song: The Alto Rhapsody as Musical Cento,” that has  evolved over time since I first gave it in 2004 at the workshop  Bedeutung und Erfahrung von Musik, at the Freie Universität  in Berlin, and subsequently at the 2011 annual meeting of  the American Musicological Society in San Francisco and the  Northern California Chapter meeting of the AMS  at Stanford  University. I am grateful to James Webster, Paul Berry, and  Albrecht Riethmüller for comments on versions of the talk. 1 Berthold litzmann, Clara Schumann: Ein Künstlerleben nach Tagebüchern und Briefen,  3 vols. (leipzig: Breitkopf und härtel, 1910), 3:230: “Den 16. Juli. Johannes ist wie umge- wandelt jetzt, kommt selten und ist einsilbig; auch gegen Julie, gegen die er vorher so sehr  liebenswürdig immer war.” There are many who have covered the biographical background  for this work.

Brahms’s choice of text and title led some to compare his work to  Johann Friedrich Reichardt’s “Rhapsodie (Aus der harzreise)” from  1792, a crucial precedent not only for the title but also for several musi- cal details. he evidently got to know the Reichardt setting in 1868, for  as he later recalled in a letter to hermann Deiters: “I remember in my  stay with you that I saw a book of songs by Reichardt (possibly Zelter),  in which there was a passage from Goethe’s Harzreise (‘aber abseits wer  192 ist’s’). Can you lend me this volume for a short time? I hardly need to tell  you that I have already composed my piece, and that I only want to see  that work of my predecessor.”4 he and Reichardt used the same verses  from the poem “harzreise im Winter” that Goethe had written in De- cember 1777. Of Goethe’s eighty-eight verses, Reichardt set sixteen and  Brahms twenty-two, as shown in table 1.  Max Kalbeck long ago identified  several musical correspondences to Reichardt’s song in his biography of  Brahms (his comparison of the two works appears in ex. 1). he marked  three spots at which Brahms set the same words to the same pitches:  first at “Gift ward” on G (with Brahms adding an appoggiatura), then  a measure later at “Der sich Menschenhaß” on G and D ♭, and again at  “Fülle der liebe” as the singer descends from F by step for several notes.5  2 Quoted in Berthold litzmann, Clara Schumann: An Artist’s Life Based on Material Found  in Diaries and Letters, trans. and ed. by Grace hadow, 2 vols.

Both singers begin on  the third of the C-minor triad and reach the note D at “Des,” a pronoun  that both composers accentuate rhythmically and elevate above the sur- rounding pitches. Both also dramatically emphasize the arrival at “Men- schenhaß” by the same diminished seventh chord (and when Brahms  repeats this verse, he too sets each syllable of “Menschenhaß” to D ♭). And  both Brahms and Reichardt precede the climactic F of “Fülle” with one  measure in which the singer sustains a D ♭.  It is striking that both composers begin in C minor and shift to major  (although Reichardt moves to E ♭ major), and both shift from duple meter  to 64 time. less obvious are the similarities in the cadential phrases that  lead into this change of meter. Brahms disguises the resemblance by the  dramatic shift in octaves, but his cadence is nevertheless related to the stan- dard recitative formula that Reichardt too had altered. Examples 2a and 2b  present this phrase as it appears in the scores, whereas in examples 2c and  “einige Takte der Singstimme so ähnlich verlaufen, daß auf eine vertiefende Nachgestaltung  des Musters nach offenbar gründlicher Beschäftigung damit geschlossen werden darf.” See  Salmen, Geschichte der Rhapsodie (Zurich and Freiburg: Atlantis, 1966), 49. </page> <page sequence="4"> Journal of Musicology 292 Examples, p. 1 Reynolds Reynolds, Ex. 1a (correx 2/7/12): � � � � � � � �� � �� �� � � � � � �� � � �� � � +�1 � � +�� 2 �� Ach, wer hei - let die Schmer - zen Des, dem Bal - sam zu Gift ward?

Brahms’s debt to Reichardt is better characterized as a for- mal modeling than as an allusion. But although these similarities convey a  sense of his reverence for musical traditions and his respect for a composer  who was close to Goethe, I think that Brahms’s reason for borrowing ideas  from Reichardt had more to do with the work’s designation as a rhapsody. </page> <page sequence="5"> reynolds example 2a.

It is in the sense of frag- ment and excerpt that Reichardt chose the title “Rhapsody” for his setting  of an excerpt from Goethe’s poem. That this was also Brahms’s conscious  intent in adopting Reichardt’s title is made explicit in his subtitle, Frag- ment aus Goethes Harzreise im Winter. In following Reichardt, Brahms was  fully conscious of his debt to the older composer, as he acknowledged in  a letter to Deiters: “I call my piece ‘Rhapsody,’ but believe that I already  have my distinguished predecessor to thank for this title.”8 Brahms’s use  of the word “Vorredner” (previous speaker or orator) instead of “com- poser” or even “colleague” implies that he thought of himself and his pre- decessor as rhapsodists. The element of passion associated with the work,  as documented in the accounts left by both Brahms and Clara, suggests  composition as a “spontaneous outpouring” fully in line with the genre’s  expectations. Also relevant as evidence that he understood the homer- ic heritage of the form are the declamatory recitative- and arioso-like  writing for the alto soloist in the first two sections of the work and the  6 “For a rhapsody is not ‘composed’; it is improvised, seemingly regardless of any rules  of form, a free outpouring guided only by the instinct of the creative musician and the mood  seeking expression.” louis Kentner, “Solo Piano Music (1827–61),” in Franz Liszt: The Man  and His Music, ed.

A study of German poetic forms published in a sixth edition in  1868 defined rhapsodies as poems that “either had more the character  of an ode or more that of a hymn,” a description that suits the stylistic  contrast between the opening and closing sections of the Alto Rhapsody  precisely (for the full quotation, see the appendix, no. 8). yet Brahms doubtless also knew of the patchwork associations of rhap- sody. his concern to adhere to literary and generic conventions has been  well documented. John Daverio, for instance, has concluded that Brahms  exhibited “a true sensitivity to the literary qualities of Tieck’s musical Märch- en” in his Magelone Romanzen, in which he realized the complex musical  implications of Tieck’s generically mixed poetry.9 Since Brahms consciously  adopted several other traits of rhapsody—spontaneous outpouring, frag- ment, the styles of ode and hymn—it is worth considering whether or not  he also accommodated one of the most important nineteenth-century  attributes of the genre: its use in wedding celebrations in the form of a cento  consisting of numerous fragmentary quotations from other works. We need therefore to examine the musical and textual links of the  Alto Rhapsody to other compositions that provided Brahms with material.  I will also identify the many ties between the Rhapsody and the Schick- 197 salslied, op. 54, another work for chorus and orchestra. Brahms seems to  have conceived these two works as companion pieces, as “expressive dou- bles” of each other, to invoke a concept proposed by lawrence Kramer.10  The results of my investigation suggest that Brahms likely conceived the  Alto Rhapsody at least a year earlier than previously thought. *  *  * In addition to the musical debts to Reichardt, there are several passages  in the Alto Rhapsody that draw on a broad range of works that reinforce  the meaning of Goethe’s text.  Two of Brahms’s sources are unsurprising  and involve citations that are close enough musically to be considered  quotations: his own Ein deutsches Requiem and Schumann’s oratorio Das  Paradies und die Peri. In his setting of “erquicke sein herz” (restore his  heart) in the closing C-major section of the Alto Rhapsody, he uses the  same pitches and harmonization as those in the C-major mezzo-soprano  solo “Verlassener Jüngling” (Abandoned youth) from Das Paradies und  die Peri (exs. 3a and 3b). This section of Schumann’s oratorio provides  9 John Daverio, “Brahms’s Magelone Romanzen and the ‘Romantic Imperative,” Journal of  Musicology 7, no. 3 (1989): 350. As Daverio identified the generic mix, “Tieck’s Märchen hov- ers between folk tale and Roman, narrative and lyric reflection, poetry and music.” 10 lawrence Kramer, “Beethoven’s Two-Movement Piano Sonatas and the Utopia of  Romantic Esthetics,” in his Music as Cultural Practice, 1800–1900 (Berkeley: University of  California Press, 1990), 21–71. </page> <page sequence="8"> the journal of musicology wedding imagery, since it deals with the unwavering love of a man and his  treue Braut (faithful bride). There are multiple elements of the text that  complement either Goethe’s text or Brahms’s life, including, for example,  the first verses: “Abandoned youth, only one thing remains that still gives  him comfort” (Verlassener Jüngling, nur das Eine bleibt, was ihm Trost  noch giebt), namely, a woman “whom he had loved faithfully for many  years” (die er seit Jahren treugeliebt) who is safe in her father’s house.  The existence of just one source of comfort (nur das Eine bleibt) occurs  also in Goethe’s text, when the alto asks the “Father of love” if there is  “one tone that can reach his ear” (ein Ton seinem Ohre vernehmlich, so  erquicke sein herz). And, finally, Goethe’s plea to open the springs for  those parched in the desert is matched in Schumann’s description “just  one drop from the sea to cool his feverishly burning brow” (einen Trop- fen nur aus der See, zu kühlen das fiebrisch brennende Weh). Among Brahms’s own works the third movement of Ein deutsches  Requiem shares a series of general musical ideas and textual images with  the Alto Rhapsody. like the Alto Rhapsody, this movement also progresses  from verses for soloist that proclaim the unworthiness of man to verses  for choir that offer a vision of comfort, with questions midway through  198 about where to seek healing (consider the correspondence of “Nun herr,  wes soll ich mich trösten?” in the Requiem with the Rhapsody’s “Ach, wer  heilet die Schmerzen?”). The passage in the Rhapsody at “Menschenhaß”  (hatred of people) corresponds closely to the setting of the Requiem’s  “Ach, wie gar nichts sind alle Menschen, die doch so sicher leben“ (Ah,  how worthless are the people, who nevertheless live so securely). In this  passage Brahms had composed a sequential line that appears first in the  oboe and then in the cellos, basses, and bassoons. he quotes this line in  the Rhapsody under the repeated word “Menschenhaß”; examples 4a and  4b show the second statement of this phrase in the Requiem and the first  statement in the Rhapsody. The other occurrences of this line—begin- ning on F ♯ and G ♯ in the Requiem, and E ♯ and G ♯ in the Rhapsody— also  correspond. Examples 4a and 4b also show an ascending motive in both  works (in the sopranos in the Requiem and violins in the Rhapsody) that  is intervallically similar. The resemblance is stronger at the second occur- rence of this sequential motive in the Rhapsody, because oboes and flutes  play the upper motive in quarter notes. Brahms turned to these motives in  both works in setting texts that express scorn for mankind.11 11 A third source is Schumann’s overture to his opera Genoveva, which involves a mo- tive that never appears in the opera with a text. Brahms quotes mm. 36–39 almost literally  at Goethe’s text “in ung’nügender Selbstsucht” (in insatiable self-pity). The arpeggiated di- minished seventh chord repeats imitatively an octave lower and breaks off in the middle of  the third statement. Brahms and Schumann both approach this phrase with a rising F-minor  arpeggiation. I am grateful to Paul Berry, who noticed this resemblance independently, for  communicating his impressions. </page> <page sequence="9"> reynolds example 3a.

Brahms seems particularly indebted to several compositions  based on Goethe’s Faust, which is surprising since, unlike most other suc- cessful nineteenth-century composers, Brahms never publicly admitted  to having composed a major work on the Faust theme.12 Not counting  the many lieder on Faust texts such as “Gretchen am Spinnrade,” I have  12 Kalbeck, Johannes Brahms, 3:258. Kalbeck’s opinion, expressed in 1883, that Brahms  had thought of the Third Symphony in connection with a performance of Faust at the Burg- theater in Vienna, is recounted in A. Peter Brown, “Brahms’s Third Symphony and the New  German School,” Journal of Musicology 2, no. 4 (1983): 451. </page> <page sequence="11"> reynolds identified at least sixty compositions on Faust written between Ignaz  Walter’s singspiel Doktor Faust at the end of the eighteenth century and  Mahler’s Eighth Symphony at the beginning of the twentieth.13 These  works include tragic operas, comic operas, symphonies, symphonic  poems, overtures, incidental music, cantatas, and sets of lieder and were  written by composers in Germany and Austria, of course, but also France,  Italy, Poland, Russia, and England. Among the most significant settings  are several composed in the 1840s and 1850s, notably by Berlioz, Wag- ner, Schumann, liszt, and Gounod. The extent to which there are musi- cal traditions within this vast body of music is as yet largely unexplored.14 For Brahms and the Alto Rhapsody the most relevant Faust associa- tion, both for textual parallels with the Harzreise verses and for musical  connections to earlier works by other composers, is the scene in Goethe’s  Faust—“Faust allein in seinem Studierzimmer”—in which a solitary Faust  broods in his study, tormented and despairing. Two Faust compositions  have related treatments of this text, Berlioz’s La Damnation de Faust from  1846 and Gounod’s Faust from 1859. The parallels between the text set  by Brahms and the adaptation of Goethe set by Berlioz extend through  the first two stanzas of text (compare tables 1 and 2). Moreover, Ber- lioz proceeds from a minor-mode solo to a four-voice male chorus sing- 201 ing an Easter hymn in major, a sequence from despair to comfort that  adumbrates Brahms’s soloist singing verses of self-pity who is answered  by a male chorus singing a C-major hymn. Berlioz’s setting of the text  portrays Faust with a learned, contrapuntal texture and a motive that re- turns at the fifth and octave above and then several times over a pulsing  C♯ pedal (ex. 5a). A decade later Gounod chose this motive, this scene,  and this texture to begin act 1 of his opera (ex. 5b). he too presents  Faust in his study with low strings, entries at the fourth above, and, in  the last statements of the motive as the curtain rises, the same chromatic  descent from the upper note as present in Berlioz’s Faust (mm. 15–16).  The steady pulse of a pedal underlies the entire section. Vocal scores of  Gounod’s opera began to appear in 1859 and a full score was published  in 1860. 13 See the longer list of works on Faust assembled by Janet I.

The “Faust in his study” motives of Berlioz and Gounod relate to  the opening motive of the Alto Rhapsody, shown in example 6. As in  Berlioz, Brahms’s motive is played by low strings; as in Gounod, the  first three pitches span a diminished fourth (the opening measures  of all three works are given in exs. 7a–7c). liszt too composed sever- al transformations of this motive in his Faust-Symphonie of 1857, first a  version of the motive near the beginning that employs two octave dis- placements (indicated in ex. 7d), and later several transformations in  the third movement, “Mephistopheles,” without octave displacements.  Example 7d also shows one of these, with the oboe playing against a  more common disjunct version in the violins.

The first notes of the Alto Rhapsody share with liszt’s work a pattern  of dynamics (loud, then immediately soft) and an orchestration with  muted strings (compare ex. 8 and ex. 6). Both composers launch into  a state of tonal aimlessness from the same conspicuous augmented  triad, B-E ♭-G—liszt melodically, Brahms harmonically; and both com- posed opening gestures that they then sequence one step lower. In using  the augmented triad, both chose a chord that the theoretical champi- on of the augmented triad, Carl Friedrich Weitzmann, had colorfully  16 Joachim completed this overture early in 1853, very much under the influence of  liszt, with whom he had been working closely in Weimar.

Weitzmann, who was close to liszt, began his 1853 treatise on  this chord in the following anthropomorphic terms: The augmented triad has until now been considered by all theoretical  and practicing musicians to be an “unwelcome guest” (unheimlicher  Gast), who one believed needed to be gotten rid of as quickly as possible.  his dubious lineage has awoken mistrust against him; his gruff appear- 208 ance as well as his apparent incivility was not designed to win him friends.  The testimonies of our best old and new theorists, which either denied  him all territorial rights (heimatrecht) or at best suffered him fleeting  passage, were not designed to stimulate interest in him.17 These are not merely anthropomorphic terms. Weitzmann’s depiction serves  well to represent Faust, as Goethe portrays him, alone and despondent, in his  study, or in “Harzreise im Winter”, “the one who stands apart”, the one who  “has lost his path,” who is scorned by those who encounter him. Brahms, like  Liszt, thus begins by invoking a sonority that expressed in three notes the in- trinsic character of the central figure. But Brahms could also have seen some- thing of himself in this description. In Michael Musgrave’s wording, “Brahms  was characteristically an outsider.”18   17 “Der übermässige Dreiklang ist bisher von allen theoretischen und praktischen  Musikern als ein unheimlicher Gast betrachtet worden, dessen man sich stets so bald wie  möglich entledigen zu müssen glaubte. Seine zweifelhafte Abkunft hatte Misstrauen gegen  ihn erweckt; sein schroffes Auftreten sowohl wie seine scheinbare Unbehülflichkeit wa- ren nicht geeignet, ihm Freunde zu erwerben. Die Zeugnisse unserer besten älteren und  neueren Theoretiker, welche ihm entweder alles heimathrecht absprachen, oder höchstens  seinen flüchtigen Durchgang duldeten, waren nicht geeignet, Interesse für ihn zu erregen,  und auch die praktischen Meister, welche ihn zuweilen, doch stets gebunden einführten,  erlaubten ihm nur zwei bis drei, ein für alle Mal vorgeschriebene Schritte zu thun.” Karl  Friedrich Weitzmann, Der übermässige Dreiklang (Berlin: Trautwein, 1853), 1.

Table 3 compares this section with the  choral ending of the Alto Rhapsody, showing the distribution of the text,  and the thematic, temporal, and tonal structures. In both sections the eight 209 verses of text are sung mostly in the first fifteen measures, then the motives  that set the verses 7 and 8 are repeated in three different keys, before text  and music begin a varied repeat. Brahms preferred E ♭ to A ♭ for his second  theme, but he and liszt both move to B major for the first repetition of the  second theme, and they remain in these secondary tonal areas only fleet- ingly.19 Brahms’s choice of keys for the second thematic group, E ♭, B, and  G, emphasizes the notes of the augmented triad that begins both works.20  And as he leads to his final plagal cadence, Brahms also emulated liszt’s  plagal closure, progressing from V7 of IV to IV, to  ♭VI (here liszt used an  augmented sixth containing both A ♭ and E ♭), and back to I. liszt provided a model for this choral section, but Brahms, as was  his habit, deviated from it. Gender roles, for example, were flipped. his  male chorus with alto solo, which sings of a loving, redemptive father,  contrasts blatantly with liszt’s male chorus with tenor solo singing of the  “eternal feminine.” yet although these two passages offer very different  musical representations of salvation, Brahms’s evocation of liszt is not  19 In the liszt Faust-Symphonie, the section that I have marked as being in G in parenthe- ses is essentially in C major but with an emphasis on the dominant, so that it also functions as  the G-major phrase does in Brahms: it prepares the return of the first group. 20 The theme begins successively on the notes G, D♯, and B.

By alluding to liszt’s setting of “Das Ewig-weibliche”  as he composed Goethe’s prayer to the “Father of love,” Brahms gave  210 common nineteenth-century views of male and female roles and capabil- ities a resounding endorsement. About the time that liszt composed his  Faust-Symphonie he (or perhaps actually Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein)  wrote a review of Wagner’s Der fliegende Holländer in which he described  Wagner’s representation of gender differences:  [T]he woman becomes .  .  . the revelatory agent of [man’s] perfect har- mony, the indispensable mediator of the victory, of his salvation. her desire  for devotion . . . and her atonement-worthy ability to love supplements and  fulfills the gaps in man’s ability to love. The sacrifice of the female heart,  existing in highest love, resolves all dissonances in the fate of the man.21 21 “Das Weib wird so das dritte ausgleichende Glied in der Natur des Mannes, das  lösende Agens seiner vollkommenen harmonie, die unentbehrliche Vermittlerin des Sie- ges, seiner Erlösung.

Julius  Kapp, 4 vols. (leipzig: Breitkopf und härtel, 1910), 2:205. On this passage, see the discussion  of Frank hentschel, “Das ‘Ewig-weibliche’–liszt, Mahler und das bürgerliche Frauenbild,”  Archiv für Musikwissenschaft 51 (1994): 275–76. According to liszt’s assistant Joseph Joach- im Raff, liszt’s article was either written or cowritten by Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein; see  James Deaville, “A ‘Daily Diary of the Weimar Dream’: Joachim Raff’s Unpublished letters  to Doris Genast, 1852-1856,” in Liszt and his World: Proceedings of the International Liszt Confer- ence held at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 20 - 23 May 1993, ed. Michael Saffle  (Stuyvestant, Ny: Pendragon Press, 1998), Analecta lisztiana, 1:188–89. </page> <page sequence="21"> reynolds liszt depicted men as having a flawed “ability to love,” living lives  of “dissonance,” having “limited” and “darkened” thoughts, and being  “misdirected.” All of these are traits expressed either musically or textu- ally in the opening C-minor segment of the Alto Rhapsody. Women alone  are capable of mediating between the flawed state of men and an “unlim- ited, absolute feeling that blossoms with thoughts.” That Brahms allowed  an alto the preeminent role in the concluding C-major section—Wallace  Berry called it a section of “diatonic purity”—is therefore fitting.22 It is a  woman who mediates, who reveals to man the path to salvation. As law- rence Kramer observed in his stimulating analysis of the Faust-Symphonie,  Faust’s themes are all chromatic, whereas Gretchen’s are diatonic, a pat- tern that Brahms mostly replicates.23 Consequently, even though he sub- stitutes an alto for liszt’s tenor, Brahms tacitly endorsed the convention- al notions about women’s powers. In the context of Brahms’s describing  the Alto Rhapsody as his “bridal song,” Faust probably symbolized his  recognition that he was doomed to strive for the unattainable. James Webster has discussed the many ways in which Brahms adopted  a Wagnerian voice at the start of the Alto Rhapsody. Webster cites in par- ticular the influence of Tristan und Isolde, where “the Isolde action in act  1 likewise manifests a psychological progression from C minor . . . to C 211 major.”24 Among the passages he finds Wagnerian is the cadential figure  we considered at the outset because of the falling ninth, what he calls the  “wide-leap motive,” as well as other details. he compares what we have  already seen in example 2b to what is visible in example 9a:  This complex recalls the striking climax near the beginning of Tristan,  when Isolde utters the fateful words ‘Todgeweihtes Haupt! Todgeweihtes  Herz!’ Although this passage has full harmony and is moderately loud, its  second phrase . . . is similar, in the same key and register: a pre-dominant  chord involving F ♯ leads to a half cadence, while Isolde’s wide-leap motive  is almost identical.25  22 Wallace Berry, “Text and Music in the Alto Rhapsody,” Journal of Music Theory 27, no.  2 (1983): 239–53, esp. 245.  23 lawrence Kramer, “liszt, Goethe, and the Discourse of Gender,” in his Music as Cul- tural Practice, 1800–1900 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990), 102–34, esp. 106.  Among other insights, he noted the significance of liszt’s chorus and soloist being male,  calling it the “most obvious element of male-centeredness” (130). 24 James Webster, “The Alto Rhapsody: Psychology, Intertextuality, and Brahms’s Artistic  Development,” in Brahms Studies 3, ed.

And, lastly, Webster  calls attention to a dissonant dominant ninth chord that occurs in a con- textually similar moment in act 1 of Die Walküre, where Siegmund describes  his sad life (a dominant ninth chord occurs several times in Schumann’s  overture to his opera Genoveva; indeed, it begins with one). The idea that the Alto Rhapsody was in some sense Wagnerian dates  at least to Richard Specht’s 1928 biography of Brahms.27 Although both  Webster and Specht identify a stylistic affinity with Wagner, neither of  them wished to suggest that Brahms intended to allude to Wagner. how- ever close Webster comes, he takes pains to distance himself from a her- meneutical interpretation of these similarities. he calls the “wide-leap  motive” an “intertextual echo” rather than an allusion, a distinction that  allows him to avoid the issue of whether or not Brahms intended these  similarities, and thus also whether or not Brahms meant these resem- 213 blances to convey a textual meaning. yet in the context of discussing not one but several possible musi- cal sources—not just Wagner but also Reichardt, Berlioz, Joachim, liszt,  and Gounod, as well as Schumann and Brahms himself—the combined  influences suggest a different interpretation, one that the Alto Rhapsody  fulfilled, a generic expectation of rhapsody that, however unfamiliar it is  today, was common in the nineteenth century: a composition that stitched  together fragments of other works. In the allusions and influences that I  have discussed, two features stand out; the surprisingly large number of al- lusions in a relatively brief work, and the relative literalness of the allusions.  A list of the moments I and others have identified indicates how many of  the allusions employ the same pitches as their sources (see table 4). *  *  * The primary “formal” implication of rhapsody, whether with regard to  music or to poetry, was that of a free-form work assembled from bor- rowed fragments. The notion that rhapsodies, like centos, are works  made up of passages taken from other works was common in the eigh- teenth and nineteenth centuries as well as in antiquity.

The  appendix presents definitions of these related words from 1748 to 1869,  demonstrating that the conception of a work that is patched together  takes precedence in more popular usages of the word over the defini- tions that are more familiar to us. A brief survey of the range of sources, popular as well as specialized,  will be useful. A German dictionary from 1811 of words borrowed from  other languages (appendix, no. 1) defines rhapsody variously as a Stop- pelgedicht, as a collection of writings that are not closely related, and as a  work that has been patched together. In more detail, a grammatical dic- tionary from 1830 (appendix, no. 2) provides two definitions for Stoppel- gedicht: a poem patched together from other works, that is, a cento; and  a poem put together from “torn out pieces,” that is, a rhapsody. That dic- tionary further describes a Stoppelwerk as a “learned work” patched to- gether from several other works. Similarly, a German-English dictionary  from 1843 (appendix, no. 5) considers rhapsody to be either a fragment  or something patched together, like a Stoppelwerk or Flickwerk. This is a 215 definition a German-English dictionary from 1868 retains, calling a Stop- pelgedicht a “compiled or patched poem, rhapsody, cento” (appendix,  no. 7). Other kinds of specialized works endorsed these definitions. In  1869, the year of the Alto Rhapsody, lessing’s book on the laocoön was  reissued in an edited version (appendix, no. 9) that explained cento for  its readers as something “put together from any old rags, then especially  a ‘Stoppelgedicht,’ which is assembled from the verses and words of the  most different poets.” Musical references include Carl Gollnick’s Hand- lexikon der Tonkunst of 1857 (appendix, no. 6), which defines rhapsody  both as a poem recited by a rhapsodist, especially individual snippets  of homeric poems, a torn-out piece, a fragment of a larger poem; and  as a gathered Stoppelwerk with various components. A few years later  the biographer of Schumann and Mendelssohn, August Reissmann, in  his Lehrbuch der musikalischen Komposition from 1866 (appendix, no. 10)  considers rhapsodies, like fables, to be of “no actual musical form” and  describes them as being “often assembled with changing rhythms from a  variety of related poems.”  Coming closer to Brahms’s sphere, and to the use of rhapsodies  to celebrate weddings, is the music historian August Wilhelm Ambros,  who in his 1864 Geschichte der Musik (appendix, no. 13) cited, like oth- ers in the nineteenth century, “Cento nuptialis” as an example of cento.  This was a notorious wedding poem by Ausonius of Bordeaux, a fourth- century Roman poet. Ausonius created his poem almost entirely from  </page> <page sequence="26"> the journal of musicology verses by Virgil, taken out of context and put together in a witty, obscene  celebration of Emperor Gratian’s wedding to the daughter of Constan- tius II.28 later poets used this as a model, but with serious rather than  satirical intent. Wedding poems of this kind were generally called centos,  although a popular Reales Schul-Lexicon from 1748 (appendix, no. 11)  distinguished rhapsodies from centos partly based on the length of the  citations. This source also suggests rhapsodies as a composition appro- priate for a wedding: “To be sure, rhapsodies are all and every Carmina,  or songs, that are cobbled together from something larger than centos,  in order to make something out of them that may be suitable to sing at  an auspicious occasion, like a wedding, birth, victory and the like.”29 Was Brahms attempting a modern-day wedding cento? The variety and  relative fidelity of his musical references and his assertion that the work was  a “bridal song,” whether his or that of the “Schumann countess,” would  seem to indicate that this is a reasonable conclusion. But the hesitation  I have of asserting this more strongly grows out of the uncertainty about  how quickly Brahms composed the work. If he indeed began composing  the Alto Rhapsody in July 1869, as his account indicates, then I think this  intent was there all along. Although such compositional speed is certainly  216 possible, it strikes me as being out of character for Brahms, particularly in  a work in which his style tilts so blatantly toward liszt and Wagner—a work,  moreover, that represents his first substantial setting of Goethe’s poetry.  The density and subtlety of the motivic interconnections, traits that have  generated much analytical commentary, suggest an earlier beginning.30 *  *  * A plausible alternative is to place the beginnings of the composition to  June 1868, when Brahms visited Deiters and, by his own admission, en- countered Reichardt’s setting in a volume in Deiters’s library. This would  place the origins of the work in the same period as the Schicksalslied, op.  54, a choral-orchestral work that is known to owe its origin to a chance  reading of a late eighteenth-century poem while visiting his friend Al- bert Dietrich. As Dietrich later recounted, Brahms discovered the poem  when he arose early in the morning, and then that afternoon he had  sat apart on the beach at Wilhelmshaven and sketched musical ideas.31  28 See Anthony Grafton, Glenn W.

Brahms chose three strophes from hölderlin’s two-volume poeticized  novel Hyperion, which reverse the dramatic sequence of the Alto Rhap- sody, proceeding from a vision of blissful life in the heavens to a con- trasting description of mortal sorrows, of humans who “have no rest- ing place,” who vanish, fall, and suffer, like “water thrown from cliff to  cliff.” In the two compositions the three strophes divide in opposite ways.  The Schicksalslied has two divine strophes set serenely leading to one an- guished mortal strophe, while in the Alto Rhapsody Brahms reversed  the proportions: two agonized strophes precede one comforting prayer  to God. By combining the first two strophes in the Schicksalslied into one  musical texture and then adding an instrumental postlude, Brahms cre- ated a three-part musical structure like that in the Rhapsody; and as in  the Rhapsody, he composed a second section in C minor, and a third  section in C major, an unusual closing key for the Schicksalslied, which  begins in E ♭ major. To judge from the way he set textual images to music, Brahms clearly 217 appreciated the connections between hölderlin’s and Goethe’s poems.  The presence in both poems of a stringed instrument (Goethe mentions  a psaltery, hölderlin a female artist with fingers on “holy strings”) sug- gested to Brahms in both of his works an accompaniment of pizzicato  strings. Other shared images—both poems contain references to seeing,  nature, and wandering—create contrasting meanings. Thus, for exam- ple, whereas Goethe prays that the mortal’s “clouded glance” (umwölk- ten Blick) be opened, hölderlin’s heavenly spirits have “holy eyes” that  gaze “in eternal clarity” (die seligen Augen Blicken in stiller Ewiger Klar- heit). Despite this opposition of meaning, Brahms devised comparable  textures with simultaneous duple and triple eighth notes playing against  each other.33 Most significant, two of the principal motives and their variants  correspond in the two works. As shown in example 10a, the first choral  motive in the Schicksalslied relates to the cellos’ first motive in the Alto  Rhapsody (ex. 10b), although the two contrast strongly, even maximally, in  32 Ibid., 93. 33 And, given the melodic and contrapuntal aspects they share, it seems as though  Brahms read hölderlin’s eternally blooming spirit (“Blühet ewig, Ihnen der Geist”) as being  comparable, oppositionally, to Goethe’s recluse who forever “consumed his sense of self- worth in insatiable selfishness” (conclusion of stanza 2). Thus in both works, over bass lines  that descend a minor seventh and then rise a fourth, the sopranos descend a diminished triad  from A ♭ (then F–D–C) to a phrase-ending, melodic 4–3 suspension. It may be appropriate  that the line for the spirit world is an octave higher. </page> <page sequence="28"> the journal of musicology example 10a.

While the motives share the same contours, in the Schicksalslied  the hymn-like rhythmic squareness of the motive, its diatonicism, and the  repetition at pitch in the French horns create a stability completely unlike  the chromatic sinking that obscures a tonal center in the comparable pas- sage of the Alto Rhapsody. Brahms further contrasts these ideas in their  phrasing: the first choral phrase in the Schicksalslied comes immediately  to rest, breathes, and then returns a second time to the tonic, whereas in  </page> <page sequence="29"> reynolds the Rhapsody the motive is clipped and elided with the next statement,  demonstrating movement that is literally without rest or arrival. The open- ing texts support this opposition between stability and uncertainty: both  speak of wanderers, but hölderlin writes of the blessed celestial spirits who  wander together in the light (Ihr wandelt droben im licht / Auf weichem  Boden, selige Genien), Goethe describes the solitary wanderer who loses  his way in the brush (Aber Abseits, wer ist’s? / Ins Gebüsch, verliert er sein  Weg). Reflecting the difference between happy group and anguished indi- vidual, the first phrase of the Schicksalslied is sung by the altos of the choir,  that of the Rhapsody by the alto soloist. In both works these motives return with variations that bring them  closer to the version that is primary in the other work. In the Rhapsody,  as Max Kalbeck was the first to realize, the alto sings the verse “Ah, who  can heal the pain” (Ach, wer heilet die Schmerzen) to a more diatonic  version of the cello’s motive.34 This version appears with the pitches of  the Schicksalslied (ex. 10c), as Daverio has observed.35 The exact reverse  of this transposition may occur in Brahms’s setting of hölderlin’s third  strophe, as the tone shifts with the change from heavenly to earthly ter- rain. Brahms perhaps portrays the suffering of mortals (emphasized tex- tually in his melodramatic insertions of repetitions at “leidenden, lei- 219 denden Menschen, blindlings, blindlings, blindlings”) by transposing a  transformed version of the opening motive downward to begin on B♮,  now on the seventh scale degree of C minor rather than on the tonic of  E ♭ major. After leaping up a minor seventh, the line begins its descent  but gets lost on its way back to the tonic, illustrating the “blindness” la- mented at this moment in the text and at the same time contrasting  those doomed to walk in darkness with the depiction of those who wan- der in light (compare ex. 10a and ex. 10d). One of the motivic links between the works lacks an accompanying  text. Instead, it serves the same structural function in both, closing off  the second of the three parts, just before leading in to C major. Shown in  examples 11a and 11b, this descending figure begins in the violins and  concludes two octaves lower played by the cellos and double basses. In  the Schicksalslied the pattern repeats with beginnings on D ♭ and A ♭; in the  Alto Rhapsody it begins on various pitches (also on A ♭ and D ♭ when it con- cludes the first A section of this part on mm. 69–72). Both in its half-step  emphases and its function as a closing gesture, it is anticipated in skeletal  form at the end of the opening period of the Alto Rhapsody (mm. 12–16,  ex. 11c). In this shape, position, and function, the idea is one of those  that Brahms appropriated from liszt’s Faust-Symphonie (ex. 11d). liszt  34 Kalbeck, Johannes Brahms, 2:307–8. 35 Daverio recognized this connection in “The Wechsel der Töne in Brahms’s  Schicksalslied,” 111–12. </page> <page sequence="30"> the journal of musicology example 11a.

The twin nature of the Alto Rhapsody and the Schicksalslied also  encompasses the sources of the texts (both are composed on three  stanzas excerpted from late eighteenth-century poems), their embrace  of conventions and characters from antiquity, and numerous elements  of the musical setting. The almost identical circumstances in which  Brahms found these texts (summer 1868, in books owned by friends he  happened to be visiting) also links them. It is worthwhile briefly to con- sider two other aspects of their composition: the unusual key scheme of  the Schicksalslied and Brahms’s long indecision about whether or not to  include voices in that work’s closing C-major section. These issues are 221 possibly related. As Daverio has noted, the Schicksalslied is “the only one  of his large-scale compositions to end in a key different from that in  which it began.”36 yet if the plan was all along to set two similar poems  and link them musically, then perhaps the overall key scheme of the  works in tandem should be considered. Together the six sections of the  two works are not at all unusual tonally: C minor, C minor, C major, E ♭  major, C minor and C major. And the internal emphasis on E ♭ major in  the last part of the Alto Rhapsody—which contains the verses about the  “clouded glance”—could be construed as preparatory for the beginning  of the Schicksalslied. Internally, the key scheme and text of the Schicksalslied replicate those  that Brahms originally intended for what would have been the fourth  and fifth movements of his Requiem before he added the soprano solo  (Ihr habt nun Traurigkeit). The fourth movement, in E ♭ major like the  beginning of the Schicksalslied, has a text that talks about heavenly dwell- ings and the happiness of those who live in them, as in the beginning of  hölderlin’s poem. This was to have been followed by the C-minor set- ting of similar verses that tell of the contrasting situation here on earth.  The verse from the Epistle of Paul to the hebrews—“Denn wir haben  hie keine bleibende Statt” (For here we have no continuing city)—is so  close to the first verse of hölderlin’s passage—“Doch uns ist gegeben,  36 Ibid., 84. </page> <page sequence="32"> the journal of musicology Auf keiner Stätte zu ruhn” (But to us is given, at no abode to rest), that  Brahms could hardly have missed the similarity with the composition  that he had triumphantly premiered just a few months earlier, in April  1868. hölderlin’s verses and the passage in hebrews differ crucially in  the continuation of the first verse, with hölderlin’s leading only to de- spair and the biblical verse leading to an expression of hope: “[B]ut we  seek one [a home] in the future.” Brahms, in composing the Requiem,  was able to cobble together biblical passages that allowed him to move  logically from C minor to a life-affirming finish in C major. This patch- work approach to texts was for him a model of how he might conclude  the Schicksalslied; indeed, he first thought to tack on a reprise of the op- timistic opening verses. Nevertheless, another aspect of the relationship between the Alto  Rhapsody and the Schicksalslied looms as at least a partial explanation  of why Brahms chose to begin the latter work in one key and end in  another: both poems are excerpts. For the Alto Rhapsody, the fragmen- tary nature of its three strophes is proclaimed once in the subtitle, and  again by beginning with a conjunction, “But” (Aber), that conjoins no  preceding text to the poetry that follows. The possibility that Brahms  222 composed the music for the Goethe fragment in such a way as to give  the impression that it too had been excerpted from a larger work has, to  my knowledge, never been suggested. yet the extraordinarily chromatic  and tonic-obscuring opening may well convey to listeners the sense that  they have been dropped into the midst of a work that is already well un- der way. It is as if we enter the work in, say, the middle of a development  section, in time to hear previously presented ideas being subjected to ex- treme transformations. In this regard the work is similar to the cadenza  that begins Beethoven’s Choral Fantasy, a free-form composition that  grows out of the works that preceded it in its first performance. Just as  Goethe’s text exists independently of its beginning, so too—fictively— does the music. For the Schicksalslied, also a setting of a fragment from a lengthy  work, the decision to start in E ♭ major rather than C major perhaps of- fered Brahms a comparable means of feigning a fragmentary identity for  the music. The precedent of Reichardt’s setting of the Rhapsody verses  beginning in C minor and ending in E ♭ major may also have influenced  Brahms. The naively happy text precluded beginning in a minor mode  or with tonal ambiguity; indeed, the first measures could not be more  tonally secure. But if the initial phrases of the Alto Rhapsody have a de- velopmental character, then the beginning of the Schicksalslied sounds  like a culmination, like a well-prepared conclusion—which is what it  becomes when it returns in the final measures, especially with the roll- ing timpani and the concluding plagal cadence. More pointedly, the  </page> <page sequence="33"> reynolds conclusion of the Schicksalslied specifically emulates the conclusion of  the Alto Rhapsody in its modal mixing of ♭6 and ♮6 (the C ♭ in m. 2 is can- celled in m. 4) and in the triplet pulse of the timpani on the tonic, which  recalls the triplet pulse on the tonic that the French horns have in the  last phrase of the Rhapsody. The abandoned choral parts in the final section of the Schicksalslied  would have communicated an even stronger echo of the Alto Rhapsody.  The autograph full score of May 1871 shows that Brahms had considered  having the choir sing a very simple chorale-like setting of the first two  verses about the blessed spirits who wander “up there in the light” (Ihr  wandelt droben im licht / Auf weichem Boden, selige Genien). The vo- cal parts are very much like those that begin the Alto Rhapsody prayer:  rhythmically square, homophonic writing that uses the same pitches in  the upper voice but one (c''–g'–f '–e '–a''–g ' in the Alto Rhapsody; c''–g'– f–a''–g '–f '–e' in the Schicksalslied).37 Additionally, the last eight measures  would have replicated the same sequence of forces and musical events:  over a low tonic C pedal, a male chorus would have sung alone for two  measures with one part descending from A to A ♭ to G (after which the  basses quickly supplied a low A ♮), and then, as they continued for three  more measures to the end, the women’s voices entered, as does the alto 223 soloist in the Rhapsody, with the plagal A to A ♭ to G repeating once  more. In both works, the descent through the A ♭ to G sounds against a  chromatic inflection in the uppermost voice that suggests an augmented  sixth chord: in the Alto Rhapsody, D ♯ resolves to E, in the Schicksalslied,  C ♯ resolves to D. Brahms ultimately rejected the notion that the choir should repeat  the earlier verses at the end, explaining that hölderlin’s poem “is not  the kind of text to which one can cobble something on [anflicken].”38 his  qualms did not, however, prevent him from patching on a seemingly un- motivated reprise of the opening instrumental music, which even with- out words bewildered listeners struggling to understand what Brahms’s  conciliatory ending contributed to hölderlin’s despairing text.39 Anoth- er possibility, though, is that Brahms omitted the choral ending to lessen  the resemblance between Schicksalslied and the Alto Rhapsody. The rep- etition of the opening line may have also too readily called to mind the  choral coda that liszt tagged on to his Faust-Symphonie, where the cho- rus mysticus repeats Goethe’s verse about the eternal feminine drawing  37 Daverio provides a transcription of these parts in “The Wechsel der Töne in Brahms’s  Schicksalslied,” 88–89. 38 Ibid., 90, quoting a letter of 25 December 1871. I substitute cobble for tack in the trans- lation, because flicken, like stoppeln, is a verb that one encounters in discussions of rhapsody. 39 Ibid., 87-90. Daverio surveys the work’s reception, which remains divided about what  exactly Brahms attempted to convey by following hölderlin’s bleak views of the real world  with the orchestral recall of the ideal world. </page> <page sequence="34"> the journal of musicology us upward: “Das Ewig-weibliche zieht uns hinan!” When Brahms had a  chance to conduct the Schicksalslied in Karlsruhe in October 1871, he  provided a Faustian setting for his new work by interpolating it between  portions of Schumann’s Scenen aus Goethe’s Faust.40 The scene in the gar- den, in which Faust woos Margaret, opened the concert, and the final  choral movement closed it, repeating over and over, “Das Ewig-weibliche  zieht uns hinan!”41 Motivically the reprise of the opening music was arguably more im- portant for completing a musical journey that began in the Alto Rhap- sody than it was for mitigating hölderlin’s pessimism. That is because of  another occurrence of the Faust motive tucked into the conclusion of  the Schicksalslied’s introduction, nine and ten measures before the altos  enter with the clear diatonic statement of the Faust motive. Examples  12a and 12b show this introductory statement along with the choral en- trance, which was accompanied by E ♭ horns. The first horn maintains  the rhythm that the motive had at the outset of the Alto Rhapsody. But  only by bringing this introduction back in C major in the finale, does  the motive appear at a pitch level (beginning on C) that resolves the  motive (beginning on B) in the Alto Rhapsody (ex. 12c). Moreover, in  224 these final measures, for whatever poetic purposes he may have had in  mind, Brahms links this diatonic version of the Faust motive to Tristan’s  descending sixth fate (or death) motive, G ♯–A–C, which had also been  heard in the introduction of the Alto Rhapsody (mm. 9 and 10), but  there immediately following the Faust motives. had Julie Schumann not pulled the domestic rug out from under  Brahms by announcing her wedding when she did, perhaps what he ini- tially intended was a double rhapsody (as he soon enough did in his pia- no rhapsodies op. 79, nos. 1 and 2), composing musically related settings  for two complementary poetic excerpts.

The Schicksalslied came between Schumann’s  Scene in the garden and two songs by Schubert that Brahms had orchestrated (“Greisen- gesang” on a text by Rückert and “Geheimes” by Goethe). The concert then ended with  Schumann’s concluding scene from his Faust Szenen.  41 Schumann’s revised chorus (1847) influenced liszt’s choral ending in a way that  Brahms references at the end of the Schicksalslied: all three have the same G-major dominant  ninth chord as they set the final word of text (liszt and Schumann continue with repetitions  of the text set to different music). All have the same voice leading: violins and sopranos move  downward by step in parallel thirds beginning on the notes a" and f ', with divisi violas and  middle voices moving upward in contrary motion also in parallel thirds. liszt has this as the  tenor reaches “hinan” two measures before rehearsal letter “E”; Schumann as the sopra- nos reach “hinan” eleven measures before the “Nach und nach schneller” conclusion; and  Brahms, at what would have been the last word, “Genien,” in m. 394. liszt had conducted  Schumann’s Faust-Scenen in Weimar in 1849; see “From the Biographer’s Workshop: lina  Ramann’s Questionnaire’s to liszt,” with introduction and annotations by Rena Charnin  Mueller, trans.
