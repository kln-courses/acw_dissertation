In his book Delirious New York, Rem Koolhaas not try to design them.  Drawing has always been a tool to speculate on the future. It forms   a surface for enacting the desires of society and proposing new ways  in which architecture can facilitate them. From the seminal speculations  of Archigram to Paul Rudolph’s hulking megastructures in pen and   Hugh Ferriss’ crystalline ‘Metropolis of Tomorrow’, the twentieth century  took drawing towards a multitude of possible futures. Most of these  futures will never come to pass, but the potent power of speculative  drawing continues on. If science fiction is always using the future to say  something about the present, then speculative and fantastical drawings  speak of our contemporary concerns. It could be the utopian desire   to build the world again from scratch, or simply the making of a critical  argument about today via the imagery of tomorrow – but either way,  fantasising through drawing remains an evocative and seductive act.  In the following chapter, we will see work that speculates on the future   of drawing as much as the future of worlds. Future Fantasticals takes   us on a journey from Neil Spiller’s singular world manifested in drawing  through to the work of science fiction legend and Blade Runner concept  artist Syd Mead. As we zoom towards the horizon, we will encounter  strange machines for drawing, buildings that combine with biological  creatures and cities that revel in their unrestrained scale. Within each   of these projects, there is a sense of contingency, of a future that might  never come into being except through the act of drawing it. Yet in each  Fig. 3: Dashilar Panorama (detail), 95 × 135 cm, 2015. case, there is the sense that drawing as a speculative tool, with its  human subjectivities and missteps, still has the power to pull us into its  138 Deviated Histories realm and let us dream of things to come. </page> <page sequence="2"> Key Note 142 D rawing as Communicating Vessels:  196  Rowhouse An Apologia (or Not)  Tom Ngo  Neil Spiller 198  Tokyo Backup City IRTBBC Papers 149  Paradoxical Sciagraphy  You + Pea  Nat Chard Contributor 202  MEGABEAM 155 T he Fall and the Rise:   Syd Mead Lebbeus Woods’ Metaphorical   and Narrative Drawings  Massimo Mucci 162  Creatures Afield:   Drawing the ‘Dioramatic’ Caricature  Joseph Altshuler   Julia Sedlock Projects 169 T he Digital Renaissance  Anna Andronova 172  New Lohachara  Kirsty Badenoch 176 T he Restored Commonwealth Club   Adam Bell 178  SCALEFULNESS  Kyle Branchesi 181  The Silt House  Matthew Butcher 184  Deviated Futures   and Fantastical Histories  Bryan Cantley 188  The Living Tableau  Pablo Gil Martínez 192  Speculative Morphology   of Recurring Terrains  Ryota Matsumoto </page> <page sequence="3"> Key Note 142 D rawing as Communicating Vessels:  196  Rowhouse An Apologia (or Not)  Tom Ngo  Neil Spiller 198  Tokyo Backup City IRTBBC Papers 149  Paradoxical Sciagraphy  You + Pea  Nat Chard Contributor 202  MEGABEAM 155 T he Fall and the Rise:   Syd Mead Lebbeus Woods’ Metaphorical   and Narrative Drawings  Massimo Mucci 162  Creatures Afield:   Drawing the ‘Dioramatic’ Caricature  Joseph Altshuler   Julia Sedlock Projects 169 T he Digital Renaissance  Anna Andronova 172  New Lohachara  Kirsty Badenoch 176 T he Restored Commonwealth Club   Adam Bell 178  SCALEFULNESS  Kyle Branchesi 181  The Silt House  Matthew Butcher 184  Deviated Futures   and Fantastical Histories  Bryan Cantley 188  The Living Tableau  Pablo Gil Martínez 192  Speculative Morphology   of Recurring Terrains  Ryota Matsumoto </page> <page sequence="4"> Drawing as Communicating Vessels: explore these issues.

In the later  instruments (Seven and Eight), the drawing pieces are  made so that the accumulations of paint will have an  effect on their subsequent performance – a memory   of previous throws – especially where transparency is  concerned. Within each throw there is some paint that  collides with the drawing piece and causes splatter while  the rest flies past. There are drawing pieces that, as well  as holding the capacity to characterise the deflection   of paint, are also made to hold onto the paint in different  ways so that it might be active in making a register on   the drawing at a later time than the particular throw when  they were hit – perhaps even after a subsequent throw.  One type of such a component is the hoop, which can  gain a meniscus of paint when hit (a little like the film   of detergent on a bubble-making hoop). Another is the  comb-like element, which behaves in a similar way to those  extruded pasta shapes that provide a large and accommo-  dating surface area on which the sauce might attach  itself.

The idea was to depict mega-projects that would  challenge contemporary techniques in architecture,  space exploration and extreme climatic adaptation.   I created MEGABEAM as an architecture project  anticipating the future of materials that would allow  massive self-supporting structures to serve as habitat. The construct is anchored at its lowest end at the edge  of the bay, with the upper end resting (also anchored)   on the top of a small mountain. The hexagonal cross  section is a robust choice for this huge structure.  Essentially, it is a load-bearing beam large enough to use  as a self-contained city. The structure is still in its finishing  process, as evidenced by welding light sources visible at   its centre, a hoist apparatus manoeuvring a frame section  into position and the foreground view of a mobile  contractor capsule.

Turning raw   data into digestible information – diagramming – is ever more important  as our world of networks becomes increasingly complex.  Each of the projects in the following chapter investigates the encoding  and transformation of information through drawing. We see LiDAR- scanned data compared to traditional drawing techniques, artificial  intelligence as a collaborator in the drawing process and the use   of robotic drawing arms and custom-built software to transcribe three- dimensional space into the planar. We even see cities created on the  ‘virtual graph paper’ of Microsoft Excel. All of these projects explore  ways in which drawing may take on new agency in relation to the   plumes of data accessible to us, allowing us to sort our way through  space and resolve that data into information – something readable   Fig. 1 (previous): Syd Mead, MEGABEAM. by another.
