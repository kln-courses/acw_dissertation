<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nikolai Zabolotsky: Play for Mortal Stakes. By Darra Goldstein. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1993. xiii, 306 pp. Index. Plates. Hard bound. While this is the first book-length assessment of Zabolotskii's life and work in English, there have been predecessors in Russian: Andrei M. Turkov, Nikolai Zabolotskii (1966); Inna I. Rostovtseva, Nikolai Zabolotskii (1984); and Adrian V. Makedonov, Nikolai Za- bolotskii: Zhizn'. tvorchestvo. metamorfozy (1987); the last is a solid account which gives full consideration to both Russian and western commentaries on the poet. In these several works the outline of Zabolotskii's life and work was established. He was born near Kazan' and learned from his provincial upbringing and early schooling to love nature and to see in it a foil to the follies of man. He entered literary circles in St. Petersburg during the waning years of the avant-garde and was a member of Oberiu. As a credo, he espoused a twentieth-century Naturphilosophie which appears to inform his verse. He was arrested in the purge year 1938 and spent eight years in a prison camp and exile. On his return, he adopted a more accessible style and wrote lyrics whose outlook is optimistic. In her monograph, Goldstein takes to task any critics who reject either the ex- perimental early poetry or the more traditional later verse, seeing in the whole oeuvre,</page><page sequence="2">444 Slavic Review as does her predecessor, Makedonov, a continuity in his philosophical premises. The attraction of Zabolotskii's first collection, Stolbtsy (1929), is a puckish irreverence re- garding many social attitudes, stereotypes and institutions. The animate and inanimate words are equally alive in this verse and any phenomenon at all may display an indomitable will. His irrational wit places him close to Kharms and Vvedenskii, while his democratic anthropomorphism recalls Khlebnikov's primitivism. Throughout her monograph, Goldstein follows in the footsteps of Makedonov; Zabolotskii's arresting images are thus compared with the paintings of Filonov, whom the poet admired, and where Makedonov sees a resulting predmetnost', she speaks of Zabolotskii's "tangibility." In time, Zabolotskii was beguiled into utopianism by the cosmism of the philos- opher Nikolai Fedorov, who predicted the attainment of physical immortality, and by the technological speculations of the physicist Konstantin Tsiolkovskii. Zabolotskii's narrative poem, Torzhestvo zemledeliia, which was written on the brink of this period and published in Zvezda in 1933, portrays the transformation of a collective farm into an idyll, where even the arts bloom. The poem marks the beginning of his ideological difficulties with the powers-that-be and the appearance of an arid style in his verse. Zabolotskii himself realized that the poem was read by some as an ironic hyperbole, and Soviet critics attacked the work as a "kulak" poem. Two subsequent narrative poems, not published in his lifetime, suggest the presence of a spirit in nature; Mak- edonov saw in them the ideas of Vladimir Vernadskii, a bio-chemist, and the Ukrainian philosopher Grigory Skovoroda. After his return from exile in 1946, Zabolotskii feared for his new position, but he published a translation of the Slovo o polku Igoreve (1946) done in prison and two collections of original verse (1948, 1957). These volumes include many meditative landscapes, as well as expressions of joy in man's achievements, in poems on Bee- thoven, Hesiod, Socrates and others. Makedonov and Goldstein both see in these lyrics meditations on such themes as the relationships between man and nature, and between reason and spontaneity. The keynote of the poems, in any case, is a cheerful sobriety. Zabolotskii also became a translator of European and eastern poetry, and was included in a delegation of Soviet writers to Italy in 1958. Goldstein's work does not land far from Makedonov's, but in some instances her work is fuller and she corrects some small factual errors. She is at pains to discover every "source" of Zabolotskii's; in the space of four pages, she finds sources for his "Bezumnyi volk" in Lomonosov, Pushkin, Saint Simeon, Christ, the Slovo, Gogol', Cher- nyshevskii, Dostoevskii, Zamiatin, Khlebnikov and Mandel'shtam. In what she is in- debted to Makedonov, she gives him no credit at all, while he was generous to his predecessors, including the westerners. Her book has a useful index and bibliography.
