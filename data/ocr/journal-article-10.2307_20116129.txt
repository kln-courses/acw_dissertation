<plain_text><page sequence="1">JERROLD L. ARONSON CONDITIONS VERSUS TRANSFERENCE: A REPLY TO EHRING* Ever since philosophers have struggled with the problem of formulating a precise analysis of causation and, in particular, an analysis which determines the direction of causality, two rival approaches have come into play. The first approach is the conditions analysis, in which a cause is an event or condition which has a special feature about it, a feature which is somewhat responsible for its efficacy. David Hume, for example, has us think of the condition as an event which is constantly conjoined with the effect or, sometimes, as a condition such that if it were not to occur, the effect would not result. John Stuart Mill did much to advance this view on causality with his famous methods of induction. The second approach, from which the transference model arises, uses fundamental physical processes to model the causal relation and, in so doing, comes up with a criterion that determines the direction of causation. It recognizes that there is an inextricable connection be tween causation and conservation principles; it is based on the fact that energy and momentum cannot be created or destroyed. The genidentity of these quantities throughout a physical interaction dictates that they can only be transferred or exchanged from one part of a system to another when interaction takes place. According to this way of pictur ing things, what makes the cause efficacious is that it possesses a quantity such as energy, momentum, heat, etc., which can be given up to the effect object when contact takes place. Of course, this analysis of causation readily yields a criterion of causal asymmetry: the cause is that object which gives up the quantity in question while the reception of the quantity is manifested as the effect. One virtue of this criterion is that the direction of causation can be determined without having to appeal to anthropomorphic criteria such as Gasking's manipulation approach. It is my contention that no matter how complicated or refined the conditions approach to causation may end up, we are still confronted with the age-old metaphysical question of how causation can be stronger than the mere correlation of events. That's the other virtue of Synthese 63 (1985) 249-257. 0039-7857/85.10 ? 1985 by D. Reidel Publishing Company</page><page sequence="2">250 JERROLD L. ARONSON the transference model, for it makes sense of the intuition that causation is stronger than correlation, an intuition that many of us refuse to give up: and, I don't think there is another model of causation that can do the job as well. For this reason, what I and other adherents of the transference model have insisted upon over and over again is that we are not offering an analysis of the word 'cause' as it is used in ordinary language; rather, we are trying to use physical models to make sense of certain ontological features of the causal relationship.1 Instead of coming up with a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of 'cause', conditions which are designed to handle any kind of a case in a straightforward manner, the transference model is committed to reducing complex, "macroscopic" cases of making things happen to combinations of fundamental processes of transference. Douglas Ehring tries to show by the use of counterexamples that what we ordinarily or intuitively would take to be the direction of causation in these commonsensical but complex cases cannot be identified with the direction of transference. But shouldn't the arena of debate focus on simple, fundamental interactions so that the issue is not clouded by the many-bodied problem? If the transference model fails, it should fail for simple cases of cause and effect, not, for example, because the energy and momen tum (sic.) of the first body in a chain of bodies becomes dissipated by the time the last member of the chain is effected, as it was in the case of the billiard balls. I'll return to this point but the real question should be 'Why do we say that the first billiard ball caused the second to move and not vice versal'. Let's examine Ehring's counterexamples. I think many of them can be brushed aside by applying the above strategy of reducing systems to combinations of fundamental processes. As an example of what I'm talking about, consider the switch being turned off causing the light to go out. The effect, in this case, is that electrons can no longer flow through the light filament. Why is this so? A potential barrier is transferring momentum to the impinging electrons. How did that barrier get there? Momentum was transferred from someone's hand to the light switch. Ehring claims that causation can occur within a system without interacting with other bodies. "A chemical substance undergoing internal processes or an atom transmitting radiation might constitute examples" of this. Pray tell, how can a chemical substance such as a gas</page><page sequence="3">CONDITIONS VERSUS TRANSFERENCE 251 undergo a change of internal state unless something is doing work on it or it is performing work on something else? How its internal state changes is readily understood when it is reduced to a collection of molecules while the state of the gas is thought of in terms of group properties of the molecules of which it consists. If work is done on the gas, the mean kinetic energy of its molecules increases, i.e., tem perature goes up. If the gas molecules do work on a piston, its temperature decreases accordingly. A defender of the conditions approach may retort that external forces can cause the internal state of the gas to change, requiring neither a second object nor transference of a quantity to take place. This is most certainly true but the transference model reduces causation by the exertion of forces to momentum and energy exchanges. For example, in Newtonian mechanics, instead of the sun capturing the earth by means of forces which act at a distance, the sun's momentum is transmitted to a surrounding field which, in turn, is carried to the earth. This strategy of reducing forces to transference is certainly in keeping with the most advanced physical theories which now have us think of a force as the transference of a "messenger" or "virtual" particle from one fun damental particle to another.2 For example, radioactive decay is accounted for in terms of the transference of an intermediate boson from a lepton to a hadron. This is how the weak force operates. Surely, Ehring does not wish to deny such a great scientific achievement of explaining radioactive decay by insisting that causation takes place here without the interaction of bodies, especially without any transference. If he is, then how does he propose causation takes place, in these cases, if not by means of interaction? Does he have a program for reducing the transference of messenger particles to causal condition? I suspect that such a program would require the very dismantling of physics. (In fact, the underlying strategy of grand unification theories seeks a messenger particle in common to all of nature's forces. The different forces, then, are manifestations of a fundamental process of transference.) This leads to another important difference between the two above approaches to causal asymmetry. The conditions analysis usually has the cause being a condition that is a member of a set of conditions which together are causally sufficient for the effect event. By this way of viewing causation, causes and enabling conditions are, ontologically, pretty much on par; they can all be equally considered as causes.3 For example, striking a match in the presence of oxygen and combustible</page><page sequence="4">252 JERROLD L. ARONSON material may cause a fire or an explosion. But insofar as these are all contributing conditions for the fire, we could just as well say that the presence of oxygen was the cause. So, the conditions analysis conflates the distinction between enabling or "triggering" conditions and causes. But it doesn't mean, as Ehring contends, that the distinction cannot be drawn. It only means that it can't be made if one is committed to the conditions analysis. The conditions analysis of causation, however, can never break down the distinction between boundary conditions, on the one hand, and energy, momentum and heat sources, on the other. In quantum field theory, there is no getting around the difference between the transference of a virtual particle from one fundamental particle to another and the background conditions which enable such a trans ference to take place.4 So, take any case one may supply which purports to leave it questionable as to what the source of change is vis a vis an enabling condition of that change, reduce that case to a series of fundamental processes while keeping track of energy-momentum-heat suppliers throughout these processes. The other features of the system in question which are necessary for the transference to take place are the enabling conditions. The distinction between cause and condition may break down for the conditions analysis; if so, so much for the analysis. As I have argued elsewhere5, unless fundamental quantities such as energy, momentum and heat can be reduced to combinations of conditions or observable events, no amount of philosophical analysis can make the distinction go away. In relation to the above distinction between transference and ena bling conditions for such a transference taking place, is causation possible in an indeterministic universe? According to the transference model, the answer is 'Yes', and I consider this to be another one of its nice results. In other words, no set of conditions will be sufficient for the transference in question to occur; however, once the transference does occur, causation has taken place. So, according to our most fundamen tal laws, there are no conditions which are sufficient to predict that an atom will decay at a specific moment but once it does decay, we can give a causal account of the event in terms of the transference of an intermediate boson from a lepton to a hadron. What caused this transference to take place? Nothing! Now, how can the conditions approach allow for indeterministic causation, especially since we no longer have sufficient conditions which allow us to predict the effect? The only way out of this, it seems, is to have conditions "generate"</page><page sequence="5">CONDITIONS VERSUS TRANSFERENCE 253 probabilities. But what if the probability for the event in question is extremely low, say, one in a billion? How can citing conditions for such an unlikely event causally explain it?6 I really don't think that Ehring's gear example poses any problem for the transference model once the physics of the situation is made clear. Which gear, A or B is Cs movement transferred once they are meshed? The answer, I suppose, is that it depends on how they are meshed. Once this information is supplied, along with the initial angular momenta of A, B and C, their respective moments of inertia, their final angular velocities, etc., any freshman physics student should be able to calculate the answer without begging any questions about the direction of causation. What is most important, however, is that if a determinate amount of angular momentum is transferred to the gears, it simply doesn't matter if we can't tell how much each gear receives. All it means is that we don't have enough information to identify the cause but it certainly doesn't mean that causation (or transference) did not take place. In short, the type of objection found in the gear example confuses epistemology with ontology.7 Many critics of the transference model claim that it cannot dis tinguish between A causing B and B backwards in time causing A. Since my detailed response to this problem has appeared elsewhere in the literature,8 I'll just outline my answer here. It is true that the direction of transference depends on what body has what quantity earlier in time and which one has it later on. Ehring feels that there is no difference between A transferring quantity q to B, where A has q in the past and B has q in the future, and B transferring q to A in a backwards manner, i.e., from the future to the past. But clearly there is an ontological difference between the two types of transference. In the case of forwards transference, A could have possessed q throughout the past while B could possess its newly acquired q throughout the distant future. However, if B backwards transfers q to A in the past, then B no longer has that q in the future although B could acquire a different q from some other source. Likewise, A cannot have q throughout its past history; A acquires q when B "sends it a message" from the future. We must be careful to realize that it really doesn't matter if we can't tell what q A and B had when. If it turns out that A was the recipient of momentum from the future then we have it that B causes A to move and a nice case of backwards causation, whether we realize it or not; otherwise, A caused JET s motion. Anyway to look at it it's still causal. As</page><page sequence="6">254 JERROLD L. ARONSON it was in the case of the gears, to deny a direction of causation between A and B because we can't find out whether A or B gave up q is to be guilty of confusing ontological considerations (Which was the cause?) and epistemological ones (How can we tell which one was the cause?).9 Ontological considerations aside, I do maintain that we can use the transference model to tell if backwards causation has taken place.10 But what is important here is that if there is such a thing as backwards causation, the transference model has the virtue of being able to make sense of it. However, this should not be taken as an endorsement of backwards causation; it's just that I think the model can handle these difficult cases, and in a much better way than the conditions approach. (Why I say this will be discussed below.) The last two counterexamples (the closed system where energy is exchanged among A, B and C and the chain of billiard balls) are intended to show that the transference model does not work because it violates the supposed transitivity of causality. We have causal chains where the energy of the first cause is dissipated before the end of the chain is reached. Notice, right away, that this can't work for momen tum; but no matter, the argument does not go through anyway. In order to see why, all we need do is go back to the age-old distinction between immediate and proximate causes, a distinction even Hume accepts. Immediate causes are not transitive and because the transference model is about immediate causation we shouldn't expect transference to be transitive. Surely, in order to say that A causes B, we do not have to claim that if A is the first member of a long causal chain, it must be the cause of the last member of that chain. So, A can transfer q to B without q having to show up in Z at the end of series of transferences. The above criticism of the transference model is ironic because Ehring develops a theory of causal asymmetry which is within the tradition of the conditions analysis.11 It seems to me, however, that any version of the conditions analysis of causation renders the causal relationship nontransitive. For example, striking a match in the presence of oxygen causes it to light and lighting a match in the presence of hydrogen will cause an explosion but striking a match in the presence of oxygen will certainly not cause an explosion. So, according to the conditions approach, we could not say that the first billiard ball was the cause of the last one moving. In other words, failure to have a common q throughout the causal chain is replaced by a failure to have a condition in common.</page><page sequence="7">CONDITIONS VERSUS TRANSFERENCE 255 There is something lurking behind Ehring's criticism of the trans ference model, and I think it's this. The hallmarks of the model are that (1) causation takes place by an interaction of two bodies whereby (2) a genidentical quantity is passed from one to another, (3) yielding a clear-cut distinction between causes and background conditions and, (4) in such a way that the effect need not have two independent causes. There is no doubt that 1-4 are intolerable for Ehring's own analysis of causal asymmetry. No wonder, then, he chooses to attack it so vigorously. Recent versions of the conditions analysis, including Ehring's, have employed the use of counterfactuals to capture our intuitions about causal dependence (and independence). In other words, the cause is thought of as a completing condition for the occurrence of the event plus a claim that the latter counterfactually depends on the former.12 For example, Ehring bases the asymmetry of causation on this: for any causal connection between two events, C and E, there is a condition, /, upon which this connection depends. The dependence here is a counterf actual one. Basically, / is a condition of the causal connection between C and E in that if / were not present C and E would not be causally connected. For example, oxygen is a condition of a causal connection between striking a match and its lighting simply because if no oxygen were present striking the match could not cause it to light and vice versa. Now add that / is causally connected to E but not C in that 'If / were not to occur, E wouldn't' is true but 'If / were not to occur, C wouldn't' is false. Thus, C causes E but not the reverse. So, striking the match causes it to light and not vice versa in that 'If oxygen were not present, the match would not light' is true while 'If oxygen were not present, the match would not be struck' is false. Counter factual dependence, then, is the key to the modern version of the conditions analysis. Causes are not counterfactually dependent on effects but effects counterfactually depend on causes. This advanced version of the conditions analysis has a major problem confronting it: Counterfactual dependence is not a strong enough relationship to generate causal dependence (or independence). The reason for this is that the fundamental laws of physics are such that for every counterfactual of the form 'If A were not the case B would not have been the case' we can construct a backwards conditional of the form 'If B were not the case A would not have occurred.' For example, in the case of a collision between A and B where A causes B to move,</page><page sequence="8">256 JERROLD L. ARONSON couldn't we say that given the conditions of the world before the collision if B were not to move at time2 A would not have moved (a certain way) at timel (where time2 occurs later than timel)? Cases like this can be easily multiplied, and I really see no way to rule them out without being guilty of some kind of arbitrariness. Of course, this is a well-known problem for those who seek to analyze causation in terms of counterfactuals. Using counterfactuals as the kernel of analysis has another serious drawback. To what kind of an ontology is the use of counterfactuals commited? For example, are we to embrace David Lewis' possible worlds approach or should we give a causal analysis of counterfactuals? While I favor the latter approach, Ehring surely cannot adopt it without begging the question. It is my contention that causal connections underly much of our counterfactual support, that causal efficacy as articulated in the transference model can make sense of why some counterfactuals are true and others false. For the modern version of the conditions approach, it's the other way around: the truth of a counter factual is what determines whether A has the power or stuff to cause B and not the reverse. I find such an intuition about causation completely unacceptable.13 NOTES * The counterexamples discussed in this paper are to be found in Douglas Ehring's 'The Transference View of Causation', this journal. 1 For details on this kind of an approach, see my 'The Legacy of Hume's Analysis of Causation', Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science 2, 1971, 135-156. 2 In fact, there are no caused natural changes according to this picture. The only case of a caused change of state which comes close to what Ehring is talking about occurs when a single particle emits a virtual particle, then captures it later - a case of self-transference or "playing catch" with itself. 3 John Stuart Mill was one of the first to maintain that the distinction between cause and condition breaks down. A very nice articulation of this view can be found in Arthur Pap's Philosophy of Science (Glencoe: The Free Press, 1962), pp. 251-58. However, there are philosophers who maintain that a distinction between cause and conditions can be made within the conditions approach to causation. See, C. J. Ducasse's Causation and the Types of Necessity, (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1924), p. 19 and, especially, Samuel Gorovitz's 'Causal Judgments and Causal Explanations', in Tom L. Beauchamp (ed.), Philosophical Problems of Causation, Dickenson Publishing Company, Encino: 1974, pp. 235-47. 4 In quantum field theory, the enabling conditions include things like the Hamiltonian of interaction, the states of the fundamental particles in question, etc. While these conditions</page><page sequence="9">CONDITIONS VERSUS TRANSFERENCE 257 are necessary for transference to take place, they do not guarantee it will. We can only go on a probability basis. (See the discussion of Fermi's Golden Rule in Subatomic Physics, Hans Frauenfelder and Ernest M. Henly, (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1974), pp. 227-234.) But this means that we must distinguish between enabling conditions and the causal relation in question here, for even if the conditions for causation are satisfied in a given case, the corresponding causal relation may not occur. 5 'The Legacy of Hume's Analysis of Causation', op. cit., pp. 152-156 and 'On the Grammar of 'Cause", Synthese 22, 1971, 429-449. 6 See F. Dretske and A. Snyder, 'Causal Irregularity', Philosophy of Science 39, 1972, 69-71. Steven Lauwers supplies a conditions analysis response in 'Reexamination of Causal Irregularity', Philosophy of Science 45, 1978, 471-473. 7 The details of this response can be found in my 'Untangling Ontology from Epistemology in Causation', Erkenntnis 18, 1982, 293-305. 8 Ibid., pp. 296-299. 9 Determining the direction of transference is an epistemological problem which presupposes that we can ascertain the direction of time in the region where transference takes place without begging any causal questions. I suggest we can do this by employing "entropy clocks." Entropy clocks are noninteracting systems where the distribution of the members of which each system is composed changes in time. The long-range increase of the random distribution of the members of the system (which is proportional to an increase in entropy) indicates the future. It is much too improbable that such a system will evolve from randomness to order as time goes on, especially if several systems in the region all evolve to a more random state. 10 Op. cit., pp. 297-298. 11 'Causal Asymmetry', The Journal of Philosophy 79, 1982, 761-774. 12 Ibid., pp. 770-774.
