ABSTRACT Numerous cadaver tests have been performed in the past to define the behaviour and tolerance of the thorax under side impact conditions. To take into account the various test conditions and measurements techniques or parameters, a lumped parameter model is used to reproduce these tests and thus to compute the protection criteria in the same way. The correlation between the calculated criteria and the observed injuries is then analysed as a basis for discussion of their consistency and relevance. The second part of the paper deals with the transposition of tolerance criteria to the Eurosid 1 dummy, using simulation tests under different conditions (impactor test, free-fall test, imposed velocity). The results show that this transposition depends on the test conditions, because of the limited biofidelity of the Eurosid 1 dummy. INTRODUCTION In order to establish criteria and their limit values in side impact, numerous human cadaver tests were performed, under very different conditions, i.e. free-fall tests, impactor tests, sled tests and complete vehicle tests. The difficulty in gathering the results and therefore with the assessment of the tolerance criteria, comes from the fact that techniques used to measure the parameters under consideration are different for each data base. For instance, some authors measure compression of the struck side half chest including or not the arm, whilst other authors use the whole thorax compression. Some are measured by film analysis while others are calculated from difference of accelerations. As far as injuries are concerned, similar difficulties are encountered with the description of the number of fractured ribs, the number of rib fractures, on the struck side or on the whole thorax, considering the hard thorax or excluding abdominal ribs. The aim of this paper is to propose an original methodology illustrated with an example, described in the first part, to compare cadaver test results in side impact coming from different sources. The rib injuries are presented taking into account the loading surface differences between the two data sources. By using a model, the criteria are computed in the same way and related to the rib injuries, in order to evaluate their relevance. The second part deals with the transposition of tolerance criteria to the Eurosid 1 dummy, by analysing the dependence of test conditions on the protection criteria. EXPERIMENTAL DATA BASE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP - The two series of tests on human cadavers in side impact submitted to analysis and comparison are pendulum tests [1] and sled tests [2]. Pendulum Tests - Sixteen lateral thoracic impacts on fourteen cadavers were conducted at the Wayne State University, using a 23.4 kg pendulum. The contact interface was a smooth flat, 15 cm diameter disc with the edges rounded. The tests were in an oblique lateral direction to prevent rotation about the spine, except two tests at high speed. The thoracic loading was centered 7.5 cm below the midsternum, and was applied with the arm up. We will name them Viano tests. Sled Tests - The tests were performed on a decelerated sled at the University of Heidelberg. After an acceleration of the cadaver and the sled up to test speed, the sled is rapidly decelerated to zero velocity. Thanks to a low friction surface, the specimen continues to translate laterally at the sled speed prior to deceleration and impacts the stationary wall. For this study, we have focused attention on the twenty-one tests with twenty-one cadavers with a rigid, flat impact wall. The thoracic loading is applied through the arm positioned next to the thorax . We will name these tests Heidelberg tests. 1813</page><page sequence="2">ANTHROPOMETRIC DATA - For each velocity range defined by the authors, the anthropometric data, in terms of age, mass, chest breadth are recapitulated in Tables 1 and 2, by mean values plus or minus one standard deviation. In the last column the global values of each series of tests are summarized . Between the two series, the differences are only significant in terms of age, with a mean value higher for pendulum tests.

For the two series, obviously when the speed increases, NFR or NRF increase also. The number of ribs involved in the impact is not the same for the two databases, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. For the pendulum tests, only ribs 2 to 8 show fractures ; geometrically, the 150 mm diameter disk impacts 7 ribs with a doubt for the second and the seventh ribs due to anthropometric dispersion. To be sure that the ribs we consider are actually loaded by the impact, i.e. direct disk load is applied on them, only the fractures of ribs 3 to 7 are used to compare the different data-bases. One can calculate the center of fracture for each test with the following formula : Center of fractures = Z(i.Ri)/Z(Ri) with : i = rib number Ri = 1 when 1th rib is fractured th Ri = 0 when i rib is not fractured For instance, if the second, third, fourth and fifth ribs are fractured, the center of fracture equals 3.5. This is a parameter to locate globally the fractures for each test or each series of tests. Although the loads to the ribs are not applied in the same manner between the two data sets, the center of fracture, located between the fifth and sixth ribs is not different. One can also point out that the ribs 9 to 12 are less fractured in sled tests.

This model was developed for reproducing WSU tests [4], It includes the arm in torso and abdomen performances. (Thorax and abdomen force responses are not delayed compared to shoulder response). We can consider that this model is in agreement with Heidelberg tests, even if there are some slight differences in test conditions, but which are difficult to quantify and seem to fall within individual dispersions [4]. The model was validated by King in relation to external forces and deflection [3] and is in close agreement with test results. Our goal is to have the same base for Heidelberg and Viano data, to be able to compare the same parameters (deflection and VC). For Viano data, the arm is not included and we need a model for this configuration. So we started from the King model as a base. The (k2f + c2f) spring plus damper is a model including the arm and a part of thorax (m2 is not directly the rib mass, but an equivalent mass for thorax). As a consequence, we split this spring in order to keep only the thorax part, the objective being to be in agreement with Viano corridors [5], This required a high value for the damper (c2fl = 500 Ns/m and k2fl = 90 N/mm). Figure 4 shows the model and Figure 6 shows the model response against Viano corridors. In order to calculate the same deflection and VC in the Viano and Heidelberg models, we then need to incorporate the last characteristics in the King model. This leads to a model (Figure 5) which put the arm characteristics in series with the second torso part of Viano model. k2fa =110 N/mm and c2fa =110 Ns/m permit the same dynamic response to be obtained as with the King model (see Figure 7 for comparison of time- history). For the two models (Heidelberg and Viano), the torso deflection is defined by the displacement between x5 and xl6 (see Figures 4 and 5). *5 - - 1 I *11 yi - , lis - *19 1 * - 1 - rh-Π ^ yi - p-i , «ι 1 μ j - H - ν®, __ cl ΑΛ-i "2 ■12 Kl)- cl2 Banki " ei ΛΜ W3 1% KD- c23 tí ΛΛ-Η KM «4 Figure 3 : Lumped parameter model for side impact (from [3]) *5 - 1 1 *11 - *15- 1 M Ph - WÍ - Q- - - vw- fcoi cl A/v H2 *20 ■12 eve* - , il - ι *14-1 |- - , _ J- - ι kZfi ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ - "vw Pendulum m c2 ΑΛ-ļ »3 Kl&gt; e» cveS ^ *3-. - 1 - [F c3í tí ΛΛ-ļ k34 c4 Figure 4 : Lumped parameter model for pendulum impact simulation (modified from [3]) x5 ι *11 , «il. x0 - - Γ- x5 ι *11 Jip-1 , "" «il.

CONSISTENCY OF CRITERIA - Since we have a common base (the use of a mathematical model) for the calculation of criteria on the two series of tests, it is possible to evaluate their consistency as injury criteria. The results are given in Tables 3 and 4, in terms of maximum deflection and Viscous Criteria. The length (named L) used to calculate the Viscous Criteria is 140 mm for the tests with the Eurosid 1 dummy and 350 mm for the cadaver simulations. It is to be noted that results for dummies are test results from [6] and [7] (except for high velocities for which they are extrapolated) and that results for cadavers are model results. Figures 8 and 9 show respectively the number of fractured ribs versus calculated criteria (deflection and VC) for the two test series. As we can see, there is no discrepancy between the two series for VC which can be considered as the best criteria at this stage. For deflection, there is a 1816</page><page sequence="5">shift of about 20 mm between the two series, but that does not reject deflection as a criteria. Indeed, our study does not include the bone characteristics (which should be defined by a test on each subject and not by a regression on a test series made to improve the relevance of a criteria) nor difference of impact angle between the two test series, that can slightly modify results. In any case, these conclusions should be verified with other test conditions. For this purpose, a series of impactor tests with low mass and higher velocity are in process with cadavers and Eurosidl.

It is to say that the transfer function between the dummy and Human should not depend on test conditions. The following analysis attempts to verify this assumption with Eurosidl. Tests were performed with Eurosidl in Viano and Heidelberg test conditions (see references [6 and 7]). In Tables 3 and 4, the results are reported, taking into account the impact speed of each test by establishing power type regressions between measured deflection or VC and impact speed. It is then possible to plot cadaver deflection or VC respectively against Eurosidl deflection or VC (see Figures 10 and 11). We see that this leads to two different relations depending on test conditions. For instance, with a VC=1 on Eurosidl, VC is 0.7 and 1.4 respectively for Viano and Heidelberg model test conditions, it is to say a number of fractured ribs between 2.5 and 4.2 as a mean on 5 ribs involved (ribs 3 to 7). As well, for a deflection D=40 mm on Eurosidl, the deflection on cadaver model varies from 67 mm to 94 mm, therefore the number of fractured ribs goes from 0.4 to 3.5 as a mean on 5 ribs involved (ribs 3 to 7). This leads to the conclusion that, whatever the relevance of deflection and VC as criteria, they are not tolerance criteria for Eurosidl, since they depend on test conditions. 1817</page><page sequence="6">Rigid wall tests - □ - Pendulum tests ~ 3'°° I 2,50 r 2,00 - ι uo ä 1.00 - T^: £ 0,50 0,00 0,00 0,50 1,00 1,50 2,00 2,50 3,00 Calculated VC Cadaver (m/s) Figure 10 : Relations between cadaver and Eurosidl VC - · - Rigid wall tests - □ - Pendulum tests IT 80,00 E y 60,00 9 40,00 W fi ■β 20,00 U V e ρ 0,00 1 ' ' 1 1 0,0 40,0 80,0 120,0 160,0 Calculated Deflection cadaver(mm) Figure 11 : Relations between cadaver and Eurosidl deflection SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Two series of cadaver tests in different conditions were analysed with the lights of a model. This leads to the conclusion that VC and deflection seem to be good criteria since they are intrinsic descriptions of injury, independently of test conditions. However, to give more reliability to this analysis, other cadaver test should be compared to our results. In particular, tests with low mass and high velocity are planned and should bring new couples of deflection and VC for discrimination between these two criteria. The study of corresponding Eurosid 1 tests (Heidelberg and Viano test conditions) show a clear influence of test conditions on the relation between injury and criteria. Since this difference doesn't seem to appear with cadavers, this leads to the conclusion that Eurosid 1 should not be appropriate to measure tolerance criteria and should be more biofidelic for such a purpose.
