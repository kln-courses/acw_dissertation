<plain_text><page sequence="1">Graeco-Roman Ruins in the New World BLAISE D. STAPLES THE PROTAGONISTS AN THE DAY I-WIND IN THE YEAR I-REED, the year of Quetzalcoatl, the plumed serpent, Mexican god of the wind, intellect and education, Hern?n Cort?s, gentle man, entered the Aztec imperial capital, Tenochtitl?n, the representative of a civilization that calculated the event as falling on the eighth day of November, 1519 Anno Domini, the year of Christ Savior. For the augurs, or the merely pre scient in Mexico, the portents surrounding this calendrical collision would have been chilling, since whatever other con cordant association their emperor Montezuma may have es tablished privately between himself and his Lord via his own communion with him during his reign, Quetzalcoatl, embod ied in his manifestation as "whirlwind" on this particular day, was the patron of robbers and wizards. The epithet "Whirlwind" was ominous and apt. In the mythological terms of the Old World he was Hermes, the thief; in the an cient Roman vocabulary, Mercurius: Mercury. His powers bestowed the opportunity upon the deceitful to bewitch their victims while asleep, instate themselves within their house holds and take possession of their earthly goods, animate and inanimate: as Cort?s was soon to ensorcel the valley he had come to inhabit and conquer. Thus the atmosphere on that day, beyond being electrified with the long awaited and de layed cosmic and religious conjunction of Cort?s and Mon tezuma, was filled with horror and was, as reported by one witness, Cort?s' own artillery captain Francisco de Orozco, "as if everyone had eaten stupefying mushrooms, as if they had seen something astonishing. Terror dominated everyone, as if all the world were being disemboweled. People went to sleep in terror." Where the New World viewed its apocalypse ARION 11.2 FALL 2OO3</page><page sequence="2">22 GRAECO-ROMAN RUINS IN THE NEW WORLD in the mirror the Spaniards held up to them, the Old World saw reflected back from the same looking glass the Hell which the Church had fashioned out of its own pagan ori gins. It would take but little more than a decade for the Christian fathers to rectify this theological diplopia. This bicultural mirror symbolized, for both the indigenous inhabitants of New Spain and the European invaders, the fis sure in the reality that each had to pass through in order to perceive the universe as the other had over the millennia con ceptualized it. Or more exactly, learned to conceptualize it. Cultural perception of the physical world is an inherent hu man capacity, as is the ability to communicate linguistically, but it is similarly a conception codified and refined by train ing and the reinforcement of a particular people's perspective through the philosophical systems that they have evolved to define it. Thus, for the educated European in the throes of the Renaissance, the lens through which he looked had been early ground by the Church and recently polished with the rediscovered cloth of classical antiquity; for the native Mexi cans?those who constituted the upper class?the calm?cac, the Aztec equivalent of the medieval University or the ancient Greek gymnasion, provided the paideia essential for their identity. As might be expected, the fusion of these two belief systems could never be completely successful: there would al ways remain the trace of an accent, an idiom that would for ever elude translation. The equations necessary to effect a complete union of the civilizations comprised both cultural and psychological determinants that would never precisely mesh, and the interpretations that were often incorrectly im posed upon the superficially familiar in the one people by the other frequently reveal more about the interpreters than the interpreted. Old European gods were discovered in the New World being worshipped, albeit reconfigured, in a strange new pantheon by a medieval Catholic clergy who feared pa pal censure, were they to ascribe specific Judeo-Christian demons, such as Beelzebub or Lucifer, no matter how loath some, to these long thought perished ancient deities who had</page><page sequence="3">Blaise D. Staples 23 resurfaced somehow across the sea; therefore, they referred to them most frequently simply as demons (demonios) or devils (diablos), choosing safety in the generic. (A deviation from this practice, however, revealing much about the late medieval Church's attitude towards women, is that the god dess Cihuac?atl, the woman of the snake [mujer de la cule bra] who as Ton?ntzin is the mother of us all [nuestra madre], becomes identified with Eve.) The uncharted At lantic itself, moreover, and all the unknown lands imagined within it that lay beyond the Pillars of Heracles, were be lieved to be inhabited by the descendants of children not born of Adam and Eve, a genealogy that made them, for the ological purposes, extrabiblical and thereby twice removed, as it were, from divine grace, and whatever religion they might have doubly false. Their libraries of the Greek and Latin classical texts had prepared the Spanish fathers for their meeting with the fabulous creatures of the New World's mythology, but their sacred texts and commentaries had not. Not since Julian the Apostate had attempted to revive the worship of the Old Gods in the fourth century had so much divinity been returned to the Olympians. Cort?s lived in a world whose events and destinies were de termined by the Wheel of Fortune: a "mechanism" like a clock, whose movements were presided over by Fortuna, a medieval personification of the ancient Fates into one god dess. Her impartiality and scientific precision gave her an im placable aspect and inevitable direction, not unlike those of her earlier predecessor, Athena or Minerva. She was a female deity, but a masculine device, appropriate to the Renaissance, that justified the outcome of history both personal and cos mic. The predetermined nature of her movements mimicked the astronomical regularities that governed the universe as it was coming to be perceived. In effect, she sanctioned time. Montezuma, on the other hand, belonged to a world which believed human matters were ruled by a complicated, sacred calendar whose workings determined the outcome of every moment that occurred throughout the cosmos and supervised</page><page sequence="4">24 GRAECO-ROMAN RUINS IN THE NEW WORLD all the actors involved in that moment. A metaphysical stasis was created by such a cosmological system and its im mutability was the basis for the laws controlling all physical action. This calendar, and the attention given to it by the Aztec priesthood, was the religion and "science" not only of the Mexica?the name by which the Aztecs referred to them selves?who were relative late comers to the region, but also of the much earlier though still extant Maya, as well as of the various other inhabitants of Mexico, such as the Toltecs, Tepanecs, the coastal Totonacs and Huaxtecs, and the peo ples of the adjacent lands farther south. Even the Otomi, who had their own religion, culture, and language, and dwelt amongst the Aztecs, observed calendars that were only slightly different?a difference that was based on calcula tions, not on world view. In other words, this calendar deter mined the nature of the universe as it was experienced in Mesoamerica. Because of this shared but different attitude towards Fate?Cort?s' being one of action drawn linearly to an unavoidable conclusion, and Montezuma's being one of an endlessly repeated cycle of preordained episodes his peo ple were compelled to live through again and again?the con vergence of these two protagonists and all they symbolized assumed the drama and formal progress usually associated with Greek tragedy. THE MISE-EN-SC?NE Disaster is bound to be the result when resigned passivity (personified on a grand scale by Montezuma) comes up against a force motivated by the impetus of ambition (epito mized by Cort?s), a characteristic that is only possible in an Aristotelean universe predicated upon the concept of the prote kinesis, primus motor, the prime mover, which en ables a freedom of will, even within a fixed order, once the cosmic mechanism is set in motion. In a very real sense, the conquistadores and the inhabitants of the New World each occupied a solipsistic mythological time that excluded the</page><page sequence="5">Blaise D. Staples 25 comprehension of the other. There were no means of com mon perception available, aside from the mythopoeic, through which the meeting of these contradictory realities? the "reality" of the European newcomers and the "reality" of the ind?genas?could be reconciled and accepted within the respective frameworks involved in the beholders' experi ence. A metaphoric paradigm would have to be created. For Montezuma, Cort?s had to be admitted to Tenochtitl?n as a returned Mexican god; for Cort?s, Montezuma and the world he symbolized had to be conceived of as Man in the pre-Christian condition?civilized as that state had been in the Classical Age?dominated by the evils inherent in such a condition and consequently, if unfairly, "damned." The in digenous peoples were seen as a combination of Adam be fore the expulsion from Eden in the Old Testament, and hu manity before the salvation conferred upon it by the Christian baptism in the New Testament, notions consistent with the precepts of Christian spiritual beliefs. This, as men tioned above, was the more charitable attitude towards the nature of this new race. The undeniable sophistication of the Mesoamerican peoples required an interpretation of and ex planation for their existence consistent with the splendor of the society and achievements they could boast. An architec ture that rivaled, and even surpassed, that of the Old World, combined with artistic and literary masterpieces that aston ished the newcomers, could not be dismissed as the works of primitives, as the earlier encounters between the first Span ish explorers and the native inhabitants of the Caribbean is lands had been. The use of mythological paradigms and equations was to be one solution to the philosophical prob lems posed by the discovery of these highly advanced civi lizations. This approach to the conundrum would afford them acceptable entr?e into the moral universe of the Church, their presence justified on the "logical" grounds of precedence. The history of the Aztecs, in itself a kind of mythology, was to be another. It will help to bear in mind that myth and history never occur as fully distinct.</page><page sequence="6">26 GRAECO-ROMAN RUINS IN THE NEW WORLD The mythico-historical biography of Quetzalcoatl?his de parture from the lands of Mexico and his eventual promised re turn?furnished a plausible and workable explanation within the religious schema of the peoples of New Spain for the arrival of the Spaniards under Cort?s, although it was by no means the only possibility considered when the intruders made their first appearance. The Maya, for example, after their martial deal ings with them along the Yucat?n coast at Champot?n, L?zaro, and Potonch?n regarded them as merely another tribe of in vaders who had come in order to plunder and pillage. The To tonacs, more in keeping with the "mystical fact" of their ar rival, thought that they were immortals, according to the contemporary reports, sent from "heaven," definitely gods, al though not familiar gods. They were new gods, previously un heard of, possessed of a somewhat capricious nature rather like the sometimes erratic and irresponsible Greek deities who behaved so frequently in a manner unbecoming to their august position in the heavens. They embodied the anthropomorphic aspects of the divine. Bernai D?az understood this interpretation perfectly when he wrote that "they [the Totonacs] called us teules, which is their name for both their gods and evil spirits." These teules were not divine as the Church of Rome and its faithful understood the term, nor were they gods in the formal classical sense, the dignified aloof Olympians who graced the Parthenon frieze, nor indeed were they even the awesome di vinities of the state, worshipped in the official religion at Tenochtitl?n and ministered to by the sacerdotal class through human sacrifice; rather, they were magical beings resembling the sprites and genii who inhabited the substratum of the established religions in pagan Europe (!)?dryads, nymphs, nereids, satyrs and so forth?daemons who persisted in a theo logical underground that the Spaniards would have called witchcraft, or in a more scientific context: alchemy. The irony was that in this manifestation they were in fact welcomed as the very precursors of the Christ who had replaced them. Strangely, the possibility that these foreigners were the am bassadors of a distant ruler hitherto unknown to them, one</page><page sequence="7">Blaise D. Staples 27 that logic would dictate as the most obvious explanation for their presence in their lands, seems never to have occurred to the pre-Hispanic peoples of Central America. However, the most compelling theory, the one that conformed to all the historical and mythological dicta of the sacred calendar that governed the events of Aztec time and that the priesthood clung to in a kind of desperation, was that the visitors were the great gods-returned, whether the uniquely Aztec war god Huitzilopochtli, the trickster Tezcatlipoca, or the benign, al most Apolline, Quetzalcoatl. This was the view taken by Montezuma whose own faith in his religion was beginning to falter at this time, an opinion that was consistent with his having been high priest, a scholar of the sacred cycles, mili tary general, and emperor. For him there was no other intel lectual or theological recourse open, short of spiritual sui cide: Cort?s and his "entourage" had arrived wrapped in the aura of Quetzalcoatl; therefore, he had to be Quetzalcoatl through the logical dictates of theology. The god had been born in "i-Reed" and he had died after a century of fifty two years in "i-Reed." The year 1519 was, as has been said, " 1-Reed" in the Aztec calendar. The year was designated as the hero-god's in the celestial realm that determined such matters. Years with the sign of the Reed always came from the east, as had Cort?s, and it had been into the east that Quetzalcoatl had sailed off, borne by his serpent vessel gen erations earlier. Furthermore, the conquistadores had landed clad in black, a color sacred to the god, although for reli gious reasons of their own: they had put to shore on Good Friday. But "i-Reed" was also a time ominous for kings and spelled doom; it cast a pall over his reign the significance of which Montezuma and his advisors could only have been too aware of. Nothing in Mexico happened by chance, and even in sixteenth century Europe the portents surrounding the Castilian invasion would have seemed sufficient to cause alarm, if not panic had the events been reversed. Add to this the fact that no novel exception was ever admitted to their cosmology that could in any way alter the eternally fixed</page><page sequence="8">28 GRAECO-ROMAN RUINS IN THE NEW WORLD chronological universe of the Mesoamericans?not even the reappearance of a god long departed?and Montezuma's re sponse to the historical situation becomes reasonable, if not rational. Is it any wonder, then, that when he finally discov ered himself face to face with the incarnate lord of the reli gion whose gods he had come to feel were abandoning him and his people, the emperor suffered what Octavio Paz has called a "sacred vertigo"? Por qu? cede Montezuma? Por qu? se siente extra?amente fasci nado por los espa?oles y experimenta ante ellos un v?rtigo que no es exagerado llamar sagrado?el v?rtigo l?cido del suicida ante el abismo? Los dioses lo han abandonado. Why did Montezuma give in? Why did he feel so strangely fasci nated by the Spaniards and experience before them a vertigo that it is no exaggeration to call "sacred"?the icy clear vertigo of the sui cide at the edge of the abyss? Because the gods had abandoned him. (Octavio Paz, El laberinto de la soledad, trans. B.D.S.) The tragedy that befell the Aztec Empire was a fate unlike the deaths that gradually overcame the older empires of Rome or Byzantium; those political states had evolved par allel with their religions over periods of roughly a millen nium, running their cultural courses from birth through adulthood to decadence, if not outright senectitude. They were all but lured into death by a taedium vitae that seems historically inevitable in hindsight. Their mythology had stagnated and had come to serve as an ossified embellish ment of Court or Ecclesiastical arts, the product of imperial lassitude. The Aztecs, by contrast, were smitten at the zenith of their civilization's youth precisely at the moment when they were poised on the pinnacle of their promise, entering the portal of their maturity. They had been a power for only two hundred years when the Spaniards arrived, and, as per sonified by Montezuma, they underwent a spiritual crisis that metaphorically can be viewed as one commonly associ ated with adolescence, that period of personal development</page><page sequence="9">Blaise D. Staples 29 that is notoriously characterized by self-destructive urges and a sense of isolation, the succumbing to the seduction of death, and a mood of despair and desertion. Thus were the Aztecs paralyzed. This in large part contributes a partial an swer to the enigma that has always surrounded the near in comprehensible fact of the conquest by a handful of foreign invaders of an empire that at any moment could have chosen to annihilate them. The stage was thus set for a drama that uncannily called for its actors to assume the r?les of the gods and heroes within their respective mythologies, as well as continue to function as the actual historical personages they were. THE TWO M?RIDAS The name M?rida is the Spanish corruption of the Latin "Em?rita Augusta," the city that was founded in 25 BC by Publius Carisius, legate of the Emperor Caesar Augustus, as a pension by way of land-grant for the veterans of the V and X Legions of the Roman army who had fought in Augustus' Cantabrian wars. It developed rapidly as the capital of Lusi tania?what is now Spanish Extremadura and Portugal? becoming an imperial cultural center of major significance for some four centuries. Its wealth and importance were early reflected in its architecture, both civic and private, whose magnificent Graeco-Roman remains are among the best preserved outside of Italy and Greece today. Temples, palaces, a theater, baths, and places of municipal grandeur were all lavished upon the settlement from the beginning. It was intended to impress. Without detailing the history of its ruins, many of which contributed to the construction of the monuments still standing from later periods of the city's his tory, suffice it to say that during the fifteenth century, the era of the conquistadores, it was a city and region littered with reminders of its ancient glory. Its most distinguishing physi cal characteristic was its pagan skeleton and it was from this land that Cort?s and the preponderance of his captains and</page><page sequence="10">30 GRAECO-ROMAN RUINS IN THE NEW WORLD soldiers hailed: Cort?s from Medellin and the majority of his cohorts from various towns of the surrounding province. On the other side of the Atlantic, or, for all intents and pur poses, on the other side of the world lay a similar city: a de serted ceremonial center of the Maya called Ichcansih?, later Tih?, and soon, M?rida. This M?rida was to become the Spanish capital of the Yucat?n peninsula on 6 January 1542, being officially founded on that day by Francisco Montejo the younger (El Mozo, "The Boy"). It lay within the Chakan principality of the Tutul Xiu Maya, rulers in the past of Ux mal, who had relocated in Man? after the defeat of Mayap?n in 1441. The lord of Man? at the time of the conquest, Ah Kukum Tutul Xiu, offered his alliance to the Spaniards at Tih? along with the site on 23 January 1542, and was bap tized there two months later as Francisco de Montejo Xiu, apparently neither side wishing any time to be wasted in the political or religious exchange. The Mayan ruins all about re minded the conquistadores of the Roman ruins back home in Extremadura, hence the change of Tih?'s earthly name oc curring nearly coincident with that of Ah Xiu's spiritual one. The monuments, relatively intact even in their antiquity, were leveled and used as the building materials for much of the new city, and thus the second M?rida came into being, a ge ographical "double" to its namesake across the sea. The Ex tremadurans interpreted their new province as a mirror im age of the one they had left and imposed the vision they were familiar with upon the strangeness of the universe they were beginning to construct, as they would continue to do when ever they encountered the otherwise inexplicable. The Yucat?n peninsula, it must be remembered, was essen tially a province of the Maya whose civilization encom passed?and still encompasses?the lands that now include Yucat?n proper (along with Quintana Roo), Campeche, Chi apas, Guatemala, Belize, and parts of Honduras and El Sal vador, thereby allowing them to maintain through relative proximity their commercial contact with the Aztecs while preserving their differences from them in many fundamental</page><page sequence="11">Blaise D. Staples 31 respects, and although there was a unifying adhesive cultur ally uniting all the peoples of Mesoamerica, a common de nominator that remains somewhat obscure even today in the historico-legends and hypotheses of an unrecorded or unde ciphered past, it remains imperative that the regions desig nated as Central America be understood as constituting a "continent" of nations, or city states, each with a separate history and moment within that history uniquely its own during the sixteenth century. That calendric designation itself was, as has been said, a European convention meaningless in the march of time and events in the New World. The Maya, then, who furnished the physical metaphor of classical antiq uity for the conquistadores and the Catholic priests who ac companied them, via their ruins at M?rida which evoked the broken stones of the pagan temples in the Spanish landscape, contributed the linchpin that was to hold together the inter pretations of innumerable otherwise incomprehensible con tradictions and metaphysical betrayals in the fixed notion of reality that the newcomers had brought with them. From the physical metaphor it was but a short step to the religious. The Maya were at this time in a state of extreme decline, far distant from the glories of their civilization which had at its apogee in the fifth and sixth centuries produced the great cen ters of Palenque in Chiapas and Tikal in Guatemala, and later?in the post-classic period (1000-1500 ad) with admix tures of Toltec, Putun, and Puuc influences?Chich?n Itz?. But the Maya whom the Spaniards encountered were still by no means without vestiges of their former magnificence. When Hern?ndez de C?rdoba sailed upon one of their forti fied towns along the coast in 1517, he was, according to Pe ter Martyr, an Italian humanist from Lago Maggiore who had come to Spain in the entourage of the Mendoza family in the capacity of "Professional Renaissance Scholar," impressed by reports of "houses with towers, splendorous temples, regular streets and marketplaces" and pyramids. Pyramids we can as sume, since the settlement was christened El Gran Cairo. This is significant not only for its furnishing a description of con</page><page sequence="12">32 GRAECO-ROMAN RUINS IN THE NEW WORLD temporary Mayan architecture, but because it shows that from the very beginning the explorers were attempting to place the indigenous inhabitants they encountered within a fa miliar framework. Whether they had actually been to Egypt personally was beside the point; sailors from the Mediter ranean, and especially those from a recently Muslim region of Spain, would have been familiar with the most distinguish ing architectural feature of the Egyptian Fatimid caliphate's skyline. Coming from Extremadura and sailing from Seville, arguably the most cosmopolitan and multi-ethnic European city of its day with a corresponding artistic tradition, gave the conquistadores a breadth of cultural experience that pre pared them well for their engagement with the exotic. Fray Diego de Landa, the Bishop of Yucat?n in the 1560s with his episcopal seat in M?rida, has left an invaluable ac count of the Yucatecan Maya as he knew them and the reli gion he so arduously tried to replace with his own and that of his sovereigns. His writings, Relaci?n de las cosas de Yu cat?n, relate the customs and mores of his "parishioners" in a manner that is strangely reminiscent of Caesar's De Bello Gallico while foreshadowing Margaret Mead's Coming of Age in Samoa. It was, in its way, something entirely new; a sort of proto-anthropological treatise that purports to be an unbiased account of the people he has studied and lived among. In reality it betrays an ambivalence about its subject that was unavoidable given the author's vocation and her itage: he both admires the grandeur and beauty (grandeza y hermosura) of the Mayan monuments?particularly those at Izamal, an enormous ceremonial complex and place of pil grimage not far from M?rida, where he had caused to be erected a Franciscan monastery upon the Popolchac, a temple of the Rain gods?and the manifold artistic achievements of their civilization, and is simultaneously repulsed by the prac tices they performed through them in honor of the natural and supernatural powers in their cosmos: namely, human sacrifice and corporal mutilation. He does, nonetheless, pres ent a vivid and credible account of the world that the Maya</page><page sequence="13">Blaise D. Staples 33 inhabited. He discusses in turn the mundane and the pro found in their universe, focusing on the routines of their daily life, their system of "writing" and select details of their his tory, and dwells at length on their sacred calendar, its hiero glyphs and festivals, these latter closely paralleling in spirit the codified progress of the Catholic church's liturgical year that he regards as the true one and the earlier ritual calendars of pre-Christian Europe. He describes, for example, "fiestas" that echo the pagan bacchanalia of Greece and Rome whose physical excesses are heightened by a wine of honey and wa ter (vino de miel y agua) that is intensified by the herbal ad ditive of the root of a particular tree (cierta ra?z de un ?rbol que para esto criaban), a wine exceptionally strong and?to him?repellent (fuerte y muy hediondo). The two faces of the same religious coin, however, seem to have eluded his other wise normally acute powers of observation. But more impor tant for the purpose of comprehending the interrelatedness of pre-cortesian indigenous religions, he connects their mythol ogy, which centers upon the god Kukulk?n at Chich?n Itz?, with the pan-Mexican mythology in which Kukulk?n is the transformed deity known to the Aztecs, and earlier the Toltecs, as Quetzalcoatl, thereby establishing the religious re lationships that united Mesoamerica despite regional enmi ties and political divisions. MYTHOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS The Spanish encountered the cultures of Mesoamerica dur ing what has come to be termed the late post-classic period (1250-1521 ad) and all the colonial texts that exist, whether written by the Spanish or the indigenous scholars, while fur nishing a profusion of information concerning the religious beliefs and practices of the peoples of this era and of their mythologies, cannot compensate for the loss of the screens, or codices, from prior eras that were destroyed in the con quest and the regional wars antedating it. Thus, excepting the archaeological evidence that sheds a different and nonlit</page><page sequence="14">34 GRAECO-ROMAN RUINS IN THE NEW WORLD erary kind of light on the subject, there is no continuous mythological narrative corpus that evolved over centuries such as that which remains from classical Greek antiquity in the Homeric poems and the tragedies, or the later Roman continuations from them in Vergil's Aeneid or Ovid's Meta morphoses?to choose but two random examples?out of which was built a unified mythopoeic construct. This is par tially due to the nature of the gods and heroes in Mesoamer ican mythopoesis. Unlike the "extended family" of twelve Olympians and the convoluted relationships that connect them in some way or other with every deity and hero, no matter how obscure, in the vast mythological community that is their realm, there was no family per se in the pan theon of the native peoples of Central America. There were consanguineous relationships?brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, etc.?but not on the scale that would have cre ated a dynasty such as Christian Europeans would have ex pected from a pagan religion. And the lack of this extensive genealogical tree of divine relatives necessitated a piecemeal interpretation of the major religious figures worshipped in New Spain by the scholars involved in that pursuit. There were, it is true, literary epics, the best known and greatest being the Mayan Popol Vuh, written down into Quiche Maya during the late sixteenth century in the Highlands of Guatemala and transcribed and translated into Spanish by the Dominican Fray Francisco Xim?nez early in the eigh teenth century at the church of Santo Tom?s in Chichicaste nango; but this poem, although technically mythological in its subject matter, is actually historical in its purpose, dealing with the sacred origins of the world, and, in accordance with the nature of Mesoamerican myths, serves the didactic r?le of providing paradigms for ethical behavior. The lowland Maya of the Yucat?n peninsula possessed a collection of books also, which were assembled under the name of the priest who compiled them, Chilam Balam, each "volume" being entitled for the town from which it comes; the most noteworthy of these are the Book of the Chilam Balam of</page><page sequence="15">Blaise D. Staples 35 Chumayel and the Book of Chilam Balam of Tizimin, al though there are many others, some being still written in re gions of Quintana Roo, but none of these works is earlier than the eighteenth century and hence, while of interest to contemporary research, they provide only tangential infor mation about the sources which were available to the first generation of Spanish missionaries. There was as well a highly refined school of N?huatl poetry among the Aztecs, but again its purpose was more lyric than religious. The dominant culture of the late post-classic period was that of the Aztecs. They had risen in little over two hundred years from a semi-nomadic tribal people, one of the Chi chimecs, whose origins were in the vague desert area to the northwest of Tenochtitl?n/Mexico City, to become the most powerful empire ever to rule in Central America. The ethnic name Chichimec denotes a primitive, almost derogatory term for various desert peoples but is also the generic word for im migrant. Thus the Aztecs were not essentially different in their geographic origins or social status from the other nomadic tribes that had entered the Valley of Mexico before them, al though they suffered from an inferiority complex for which they compensated by creating a history and mythology that was intended to glorify their lineage and obscure their roots. They went about this process of self-aggrandizement by ab sorbing the mythologies of the peoples they conquered and with whom they intermarried as their own and adding the deities of their new subjects and alliances to their ever ex panding supernatural world. In essence, they considered the gods of their defeated enemies and recently acquired allies captives and had a special "treasury" or "prison" in the great ceremonial precinct of Tenochtitl?n?the coateocalli?in which they housed the divine spoils plundered from con quered states and awarded to them as sacred dowry. But dis tinguished from among these foreign accretions was the quin tessential cult god of the Aztecs: Huitzilopochtli. The least complicated way to present Huitzilopochtli is still to follow the lead of the remarkable chronicler of Aztec</page><page sequence="16">36 GRAECO-ROMAN RUINS IN THE NEW WORLD civilization Fray Bernardino de Sahag?n who arrived in Mexico in 1529 and dedicated most of the remainder of his life to the study of the indigenous language and culture he discovered there. He was able to communicate with the na tive sabios?the shamans who had spent their lives in the pre-cortesian Aztec world?through his fluency in N?huatl, and, aided by former court scribes and imperial scholars, was able to work with the ancient codices, the repositories of the totality of recorded Aztec knowledge in the broadest sense of the word. His monumental Historia general de las cosas de Nueva Espa?a is the result of that labor and his de votion to a world he could see dissolving as he touched it. His work is a virtual encyclopedia of all things Aztec and is illuminated by over 1,850 illustrations. As a source for the study of any pre-Hispanic culture in the Americas it is un equaled. Composed in both N?huatl and Spanish, it com prises twelve books, three of which are of particular interest here: book one with its descriptions and drawings of the ma jor gods, book three relating a selection of the main Aztec myths, and book seven, which continues the astronomical cosmogony begun with the creation of the sun at Teoti huac?n in book three. The fate of the Historia general was such that it was nearly lost for politico-religious reasons back home in Spain, and indeed the first version was lost, presumably due to a royal decree issued in 1577 by Felipe II intended to confiscate the bilingual works of Sahag?n. For tunately, a second copy was sent to Spain in 1579 or 1580 which was forgotten until it resurfaced in 1779. This is the so-called Florentine Codex in the Mediceo-Laurentian Li brary in Florence, and it is this manuscript that provides the visual translation of the Aztec?and hence Mesoamerican? gods into the classical Graeco-Roman deities through whom the Spaniards were able to comprehend them. The gods of the Mesoamericans may not be as structured in their relationships to one another as are those of the clas sical Greeks and Romans, but they are as numerous, if not more so. Their functions and boundaries intertwine in a</page><page sequence="17">Blaise D. Staples 37 manner that makes them at times seem as though they are in a continual process of metamorphosing and thereby increas ing, as in point of fact they are, for the reasons stated above. Each adoption of a "foreign" family member brings with it an additional divinity who needs must be allotted a separate place in the supernatural universe. Whereas, in contrast, the nature of the classical deities and the mythological para digms which they configure is best demonstrated through the analogy provided by the various epithets that the gods are given in the Homeric poems?owl-eyed Athena, far-dart ing Apollo, cow-faced Hera, etc.?except that by the time the Greek gods become Greek they are sacred unities with attributes, rather than deified attributes lacking a unity. Thus, the multiplicity of divine personae is substantially re duced. To put it another way: all the aspects of Apollo, or of whichever epithetized god is being considered, that at one time denoted individual deities in a vast mythological arena are combined in the sole entity designated "Apollo." It is rather like the linguistic process of the grammatical cases be coming simplified over time by attraction?the dative case being absorbed by the genitive as in the evolution of Ancient Greek into the present Demotic, for example?until the lan guage has reached the level of regularization that best ac commodates its potential for expression at a given historical moment. Dialects persist?to continue the linguistic simile? that keep alive archaisms here and there, and the same holds true within isolated enclaves of ritual, where particular cults are maintained and autochthonous gods or atavistic heroes worshipped, despite the greater tendency of the people as a whole to create a universal theology when the overall politi cal situation changes and a city state or empire emerges from the member groups or tribes that bring it forth. The di chotomy that clearly delineated the "cultic" from the "offi cial" religions within the classical world was much less dis tinct in the schema of the Mesoamerican where, at least within the Aztec empire, the populace was universally served by the state's sacerdotal hierarchy.</page><page sequence="18">38 GRAECO-ROMAN RUINS IN THE NEW WORLD HUITZILOPOCHTLI: ANOTHER HERAKLES Heroes, perhaps to their embarrassment, usually enter the narration of their later exploits, for which they are more elaborately celebrated, during their infancy. This is true even of Zeus who, although not exposed to the humiliation of be ing displayed naked upon a fur rug and portrayed thusly for subsequent generations' amusement, is, nevertheless, re vealed in his Cretan nursery dependent upon the ministra tions babies require under the supervision of his nanny, Amalthea. Hermes, more famously and at greater length, also undergoes the hazing of having his baby antics immor talized in the Homeric Hymn that bears his name. Likewise, the birth of Herakles is made extraordinary and frightful by Hera who, jealous of his mother Alkmene, sent two prodi gious serpents to his cradle in order to destroy him. Pre dictably, the fearless godling grabbed one in each hand and crushed them both to death, thereby beginning his remark able career with typical bravura. In book three of the Florentine Codex is a series of illus trations depicting the birth of the hero-god Huitzilopochtli and the battle that ensued on this miraculous occasion. One scene shows him as a toddler crouching, his lap filled with writhing snakes. It is important to know that the circum stances of his birth made it imperative that his first act upon seeing light was to slaughter the Centzon Huitznahua, a vir tual army of brothers, the Four Hundred Southerners, who had arrived at that moment to kill his mother, Coatlicue, "She of the Serpent Skirt," i.e., the earth goddess. They had come at the instigation of their sister, Coyolxauhqui, Coat licue's daughter who was outraged by her mother's preg nancy. Huitzilopochtli, having learned of the plot in utero, as it were, promised his mother that no harm would befall her and emerged fully armed from the womb wielding his em blem, reminiscent of Herakles' totemic club, a flaming weapon, the Xiuhcoatl or Turquoise Serpent, and immedi</page><page sequence="19">Blaise D. Staples 39 ately cut to pieces his half-sister, Coyolxauhqui, throwing the remains of her body to the base of Mt. Coatepec, his place of birth and the scene of this monumental act of fratricide. In addition to whatever other mythicohistorical and cosmologi cal connotations this event contains, the massacre and throw ing down of the dismembered body of Coyolxauhqui to Coatepec's base provided the myth of origin for the ritual hu man sacrifices performed by the Aztecs on the Templo Mayor at Tenochtitl?n. There are subsequent depictions of the god as a young warrior in the manuscript taken from various events in his life clearly portraying him as a divine hero by means of the splendid regalia he is decked out in and the ac coutrements of rank that he wears. It is no wonder that Sa hag?n, in trying to establish a correlation between Huitzilo pochtli and a suitable god from classical antiquity with whom to connect him, chose Herakles/Hercules, and had in scribed in Old Spanish by the native artist who painted him, prominently across both sides of his feathered brow: Vitzilo buchtli (sic) otro hercules. His "history" could not be more martial and the sacrifices offered to him in the time of Sa hag?n and the first Spaniards could not have seemed to them more gruesome, despite the atrocities they themselves com mitted in the name of the God of their religion. And indeed, at times, because of Huitzilopochtli's later and more mature deeds and acts of violence, he was equated with Ares or Mars, Herakles seeming by contrast too tame a double. Nu merous instances of the transformations of the Central Amer ican deities into more or less successful simulacra of their Old World counterparts are given in the codex?Tezcatlipoca, a complex opposite of his brother Quetzalcoatl, is illustrated as "another Jupiter"; Paynal, a sort of surrogate or delegate for Huitzilopochtli, is drawn as "Huitzilopochtli's vicar," and so forth,?but the evidence of the attempt makes redundant the cataloguing of the result, and it is not necessary to list here each rendering. The educated Spanish friars repeatedly sought out paral lels from their own cultural heritage that would establish</page><page sequence="20">40 GRAECO-ROMAN RUINS IN THE NEW WORLD points of reference from which they could reconstruct the alien world they had entered according to the laws, customs and traditions of the one they had left behind. There were, however, certain supreme entities in the New World that re fused to be categorized according to the accepted character istics that defined the anthropomorphic deities who were re turning to life in renaissance Europe via the rediscovery of classical literature?the poetic Apollos and Artemises, the Aphrodites and Adonises, Zeus and his various consorts. This is largely because the "nameless powers," while once present in the pre-Christian sphere of the Old World reli gions, had long since been eradicated through the conver sion of the rural populations by the Church and were absent from the "vocabulary" of the priests. These pantheistic ele ments were too dangerous to be allowed reentry into the Eu ropean cultural mainstream and where they existed at all, they existed as associates and familiars in the heretical re gions of witchcraft and magic. These entities were, for lack of more precise nomenclature, the gods of nature, or forces of passion; they were legion, and permeated all aspects of life in New Spain: agriculture, meteorological phenomena, love, death, pleasure, and war, as well as the arcane celestial drama repeatedly unfolding in the heavens. Unlike the name less tutelary gods of the Romans who were all but culturally suffocated by the advent of the Greek pantheon in Italy and remained virtually hidden indoors as household guardian numina outshone by the state gods whose temples adorned the city of Rome, the Mesoamerican peoples gave particular and descriptive titles to their ancestral gods and accorded them a status that, because of their very antiquity, placed them at the pinnacle of their religion. These "primitive" powers shared sacred space, literally and figuratively, with the Mexican hero-gods, the ones that corresponded more readily to their European mythological counterparts whose masks they were beginning to assume. The first Spanish scholars were at a loss as to how to interact with such fla grant superstition and idolatry focused upon abstractions</page><page sequence="21">Blaise D. Staples 41 that behaved independent of the will of God; and unable to collate these theologically threatening gods of nature with specific deities within their own poetic tradition, deities which to some degree were sanctioned by the church as harmless, they designated them in the codices by function or analogy, maintaining a margin of spiritual safety while at the same time acknowledging their presence. Thus, Opuchtli was "the god who lived on the water," not Neptune, as might be expected, because he did not conform to the sanc tioned refashioning of the Neptune who had once again been invited to participate in art and literature under the auspices of the papacy. Interestingly, the god Yiacatecutli was an extremely important deity, the "god of merchants," and hence money, but he was not equated with Hermes, one of whose functions that had been in antiquity, an oversight or omission that may reflect upon the anti-Semitism ram pant in Spain at the time. Such gods fell outside the tolerance of the sanctioned classical revival and were in essence: evil. The Great Pyramid of Tenochtitl?n, the Templo Mayor, towered over the city much as Mt. Tlaloc looms over the eastern side of the Valley of Mexico, on the summit of which are situated the ancient ruins of the Temple of Tlaloc, the god of rains and lightning, whose preeminence in central Mexico dates back to the first century BC. Tlaloc was a di vine force par excellence, a god for purposes of worship, but in his very essence the phenomenon of rain and the source of life on earth made manifest. The pyramid at Tenochtitl?n was, in fact, a replica of his mountain erected in the hub of the urban t?menos, the sacred enclosure that was the focal point of the Aztec cosmos. It was a ziggurat-like structure atop which were the dual temples of Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc: the newer god anthropomorphic, symbolizing the Aztec cultural identity, and the older the collective religious powers of the land the "recent" empire had come to domi nate. This is of course an oversimplification of these para mount Aztec divinities, but it places them in the context that they occupied in the minds of their people and in which they</page><page sequence="22">42 GRAECO-ROMAN RUINS IN THE NEW WORLD were experienced by the conquistadores. Reflected contexts in a divided mirror that returned differing images to each viewer. The same pyramid with its twin temples was gazed upon by Montezuma and Cort?s; the same sacrificial victims who marched up the tiered steps in a procession to their deaths were witnessed by Aztec and Spaniard alike; the same blood that by day's end had saturated the precinct glistened in the eyes of both beholders. But the sacred mythology of Montezuma which had in that moment reached its apotheo sis had simultaneously revealed the ultimate horrors of perdition in Cort?s'. TEZCATLIPOCA: VIEW THROUGH AN OBSIDIAN GLASS Tezcatlipoca, brother of the benificent Quetzalcoatl, the cul ture hero whose very nature evokes harmony and order, epitomizes conflict and instability throughout the universe. Among the Aztecs he was known as "the adversary" or "he whose slaves we are." His name means smoking mirror, and he is commonly represented with an obsidian disk positioned at the back of his head and another replacing one of his feet? a prosthesis that locates him within the realms of both worlds: the upper world of light and life, and the lower world of dark ness and death. The smokiness of his mirror may refer to the chromatic quality inherent in obsidian, the volcanic black green glass that is created during the cataclysmic eruptions from the inner earth, but it is more likely that it alludes to the fog-enshrouded nature of the images he reflects.</page></plain_text>
