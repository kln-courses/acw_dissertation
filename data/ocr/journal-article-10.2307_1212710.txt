<plain_text><page sequence="1">William Johnson Sound and Image A Further Hearing Do we gain a more accurate insight into a film by viewing it slowly and carefully on a Steenbeck or Movieola? Too often the answer must be No, because the sound gradually dies away as the image strip is slowed and examined frame by frame. Ironically, the emphasis of film criticism and theory is skewed by a technological accident- the fact that the image strip happens to be divided into static and legible units. Although much has been written in recent years about the importance of sound, film studies continue to be based on the assumption that the image is the essence of cinema. Theories can and do flourish without acknowledg- ing sound as an integral part of film-in some cases, almost without acknowledging its existence. Both theory and critical practice suffer as a result. In an earlier article' I argued that sound was of equal importance to the image and that films could not be adequately understood without considera- tion of the relations between sound and image. The present article develops those arguments further and opens up new lines of attack. First, there is one counterargument to over- come: Is is plausible that so many critics, theorists, and film-makers, with or without benefit of frame- by-frame analysis, should have continued to operate on flawed premises? In one sense the tendency is un- derstandable. Film could assert its independence from theater and establish its own domain only by emphasizing the role of the image, and writers fol- lowed this lead. Film-makers whose work I admire, such as Hitchcock and Powell, repeatedly declared that the image is what counts in a film (while both unobtrusively took great care of their sound tracks).2 ....................

In Last Year at Marienbad, sound is as ambiguous as the image: as A and X prepare to leave, the chiming of a clock seems at first to be part of the incidental music. It is easy to cite poor films that are talky or rely on a continual wash of incidental music. The assump- tion of image primacy has, to some extent, served as a bulwark against mediocrity.3 It is therefore natural that most film theorists even today begin with the image. But then, however much attention they later give to sound, only a complete overhaul of their theories can dislodge the image from its position of primacy. Unfortunately, the usual kind of close study of films is likely to strengthen that position. The assumption that the truth of a film can be approached more closely by stopping time is understandable: it flows from the mainstream of philosophical thought that dates back at least to Parmenides. Ironically, the opposite conception of time-as a universal linear succession-that rose to power after the Renaissance and is still deeply en- trenched today also militates against the recogni- tion of sound-image relations. The conception of time as a single arrow fosters the idea that there must be one dominant succession of events in a film rather than a concurrence of two equally im- portant channels.' It is therefore no more adequate to refer to the (intermittent) "contribution" of sound to the film than it would be to refer to the (intermittent) con- tribution of the image. Sound always plays a part, 24</page><page sequence="2">even when reduced to a minimum, just as the image always plays a part, even during a fade or black- out (or all the all-black and all-white frames of an abstract film such as Kubelka's Arnulf Rainer). The basis of film is a continuous interaction be- tween sound and image.5 This interaction is quite different from the rela- tion between sound and image in other performing arts because, in film, the two channels are separate. Even with a scene recorded directly in cinema veritJ style the image and sound are mediated separately, and in most films any "natural" link in tone and intensity between profilmic sound and image is thoroughly broken. In this respect the archetype of the sound film is the animated cartoon, in which the often tightly knit sound and image have no pro- filmic communality whatsoever.6 The significance of this separation will become apparent in the course of this article. Relations between the two channels are consti- tuted primarily by the physical parameters of each. Both sound and image can vary in overall intensity (bright/dim, loud/soft, etc.), in composition (the number and relative importance of elements) and in frequency (rate of change or movement); thus at any given moment the relation between the two channels may range anywhere from complete sim- ilarity (which I call confirmation) to complete dis- similarity (opposition).' Since the relation itself is not a physical entity, however, it cannot be meas- ured objectively: its position on the confirmation/ opposition scale and its general effect on the viewer- auditor are influenced by content and context. It is easiest to perceive those relations that are closest to the extremes of the confirmation/opposi- tion scale and have some simple relevance to the content-a crude example being a loud musical chord with a close-up of a gun.8 But since sound- image relations occur continuously throughout a film, thorough analysis requires that we account for all types, however imperceptible or apparently irrelevant. The next section offers a classification of them. Types of sound-image relations Sound and image can vary independently with any intentional or unintentional movement of the camera, lens, microphone, or person(s) or object(s) being filmed, as also with any modification of the image strip or sound track made in editing, scor- ing, dubbing, or mixing; throughout almost any film, consequently, there is a continual shifting of minor sound and image elements and of the rela- tions between them. Since the duration of any such element may vary from a fraction of a second to a minute or more, and since the duration of any overlap between sound and image elements may vary across the same range, it is difficult to define the limits of a single minor sound-image relation; moreover, concurrent elements within each chan- nel can form more than one sound-image relation at the same time. How can all these elusive, barely noticeable relations be classified? The simple answer is that they can all be placed in one category, defined as relations that have no apparent significance and form no recognizable pattern. I will call them accidental relations. Ob- viously the definition is subjective: a relation that conforms to it for one person at a given time may appear significant or patterned to another person- or to the same person at a different time. Neverthe- less, the threshold between accidental relations and other types, although variable, does not leave any minor relations unaccounted for. It is also obvious that an accidental relation may have an unconscious effect on the viewer- auditor. Here again, to the extent that critical ex- amination reveals a latent significance or pattern the relation can be transferred to another category. In other words, accidental relations include em- bryonic forms of other types of relations. The foregoing paragraphs imply that sound- image relations cannot be systematically segmented or coded. Attempts to demonstrate the coding of film, such as Umberto Eco's,9 ignore the sound track completely, whether by itself or in relation to the image.'0 As to the latter, one could divide and subdivide the paired channels of a film, both dia- chronically and synchronically, without ever reach- ing any generalizable sound-image segments. (In physical fact, however, one could not divide a film beyond a certain point: as I indicated earlier, the more narrowly one observes the image strip, the more one loses the sound track. An equivalent of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle comes into play.) Does lack of coding in sound-image relations entail that semiotic bugaboo, the survival of the referent? Roland Barthes, for one, might have 25</page><page sequence="3">feared so: in discussing all forms of narrative (in- cluding film), he insisted on a complete distinction between the fuzziness of life and the signifying function of narrative. "A narrative is never made up of anything other than functions: in differing degrees, everything in it signifies. . . . Even were a detail to appear irretrievably insignificant, resis- tant to all functionality, it would nonetheless end up with precisely the meaning of absurdity or use- lessness. . . ."", Such details, which Barthes relegates to the remote conditional, are common in films, even in each channel considered alone (an in- trusive insect, a slight unsteadiness of the camera in an otherwise smooth movement, the dancing grain of the emulsion in a high-key area, etc.), and although many of them may be caused by profil- mic events, the mediation of the image and sound recording processes converts them into random fil- mic events in their own right. As for the interaction of such insignificant details from both channels- the accidental relations in question-these are at a further remove not only from profilmic events but also from any residual significance. In many cases an accidental relation arises not from the positive qualities of sound and image but from a transition between qualities in one or both channels (e.g., a pan from a light to a darker area while the same sound continues).I2 In short, the film does not have to smuggle the fuzziness of real life into the theater: it creates a new fuzziness of its own. As insignificant as accidental relations are (in both senses of the word), they do have two cumula- tive effects. First, they create an underlying impres- sion of randomness and complexity that contributes to the illusion of reality found in all except the most rigorously abstract of films. Since psychoanalytic theorists contend that the illusion of reality works to enthrall the viewer and obscure true subjectivity, it is important to note that-second-accidental re- lations prevent the completeness of the illusion. They do this not only by introducing extraneous and incongruous details but also through the basic condition of film, the separate mediation of sound and image. It is not the smooth simulacrum of real- ity but the ambiguity in the continually shifting background of sound-image relations that serves to hold the viewer-auditor's interest, promising sus- pense and surprise even where (as in such films as Brakhage's Creation or Sonbert's Honor and Obey'"3) there is no narrative. Turning to all the possible relations above the threshold of detectability, I find it necessary to di- vide them into only three main types, which I call structural, nodal, and disruptive. Structural relations are barely noticeable in themselves but form a cumulative pattern. In the simplest case, a particular tempo or intensity may predominate in one channel while the same or a dif- ferent tempo or intensity predominates in the other channel, so that one basic relation persists or recurs throughout.14 In Huston's The Maltese Falcon the images contain very little action; medium shots predominate; the prevailing tones are in the mid- dle range; and there is a very limited number of set- tings (nearly all of them interiors). In contrast to this pervasive restraint, the sound track is domi- nated by a profusion of speech (much of it drawn directly from the Hammett novel). Speech flows without naturalistic hesitations even from slower speakers such as Cairo (Peter Lorre) and Gutman (Sidney Greenstreet), while it pours under contin- ual pressure from Spade (Humphrey Bogart) and O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor). The individual rela- tions between image and sound, which can vary from scattered confirmations at one extreme (such as Archer [Jerome Cowan] silently meeting his un- seen killer at night) to many strong oppositions at the other (such as Spade and Gutman fencing ver-</page><page sequence="4">Both The Maltese Falcon (right) and The Big Sleep (left) have copious dialogue: in the former, this con- trasts with the sparseness of char- acters and settings; in the latter, it underscores their abundance. .. . ......... . . ..... . ........ ?gx M a ............ ....... ......... ... ?vY X", .... ......... .. ......

Structural relations can reveal major differ- ences between films that seem superficially alike. Hawks's The Big Sleep, for example, has much in common with The Maltese Falcon: it is based on a popular private-eye novel involving dubious char- acters and double-crossing, there is much rapid dia- logue, and Bogart again stars as the private eye. But The Big Sleep has a far greater variety of set- tings, including many more exteriors, and the ac- tion shifts continually from place to place: for example, whereas Spade's office is the dominant setting of The Maltese Falcon, Marlowe's office appears only briefly. At the same time, the dialogue is distributed among a much larger cast in The Big Sleep than in The Maltese Falcon. The diversity of both sound and image establishes a paradoxically solid framework for the ramifying complexity of The Big Sleep: the dominant structural relation is confirmation.'5 Unlike accidental and structural relations, whose effect is cumulative and depends at least as much on the change between relations as on each relation itself, the other two categories are more conspicu- ous and take effect individually. Nodal relations are those in which sound and image together con- vey a relevant meaning. Since these are the most easily recognized type (and were examined at some length in my earlier article'6) I will give just one example-a simple example that nevertheless dem- onstrates some of the complexity that underlies all sound-image relations. In Green's Baby Face Bar- bara Stanwyck plays a woman who escapes from a sordid background by using sex to climb to wealth and security in a Wall Street bank. Each rise in po- sition (and corporate lover) is summarized by an upward camera tilt from floor to floor outside the bank building together with a rising saxophone phrase. The sound-image relation is partly a con- firmation (both are rising) and partly an opposition (visual sobriety vs. aural casualness), so that the summary is tinged with irony and humor. If a conspicuous sound-image cluster does not seem relevant to the scene or sequence, or indeed seems to conflict with it, this constitutes a disrup- tive relation. An example occurs in Hitchcock's Vertigo when Judy (Kim Novak) recalls what hap- pened after she ran up the mission tower: the image strip cuts from the shadowy stairway to a flat, brightly lit process shot in which Judy emerges onto the top of the tower and Elster (Tom Helmore), waiting with his wife's body, pushes it over the edge. Meanwhile the sound track continues with the same agitato music that accompanied the origi- 27</page><page sequence="5">nal tower scene. This music belongs to a set of romantic passages that consistently represent the obsession of Scotty/Johnny (James Stewart) with Madeleine, since they begin with the first encoun- ter in Ernie's Restaurant and break off when-and only when-practical and unmysterious Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) is onscreen. In the flashback, however, the music accompanies a far less romantic image, and one that has no place in Johnny's ob- session. Not only the technical crudity but also the sheer narrative perfunctoriness of the image jolts the viewer-auditor, who sees a ludicrously elaborate murder plot exposed in a few seconds. With its disruptive clash between aural tension and visual bathos, the flashback rips the occult veil from Mad- eleine's earlier behavior and switches the viewer- auditor's viewpoint from Johnny to Judy. Thus the disruptive relation reverberates through the entire film, enlarging both its fascination and its poten- tial meaning. It might be argued that I am reading too much into a scene whose visual crudity and perfunctori- ness result merely from Hitchcock's lack of interest in its content, the film's Maguffin. As it happens, there are several other disruptive relations in Ver- tigo at the film's turning point (from Johnny's hospitalization to his encounter with Judy)"7; but whether these too arise from accident or error is un- important. It is not even necessary to invoke the deconstructionists' defense of errors and misread- ings. As indicated above, the ground state of sound- image relations consists of accidental relations. These are multiple and random, overlapping and often conflicting with one another, and too profuse to come under the film-makers' full control; thus they can also conflict with the overt meaning of any scene in which they occur.'8 While the result in A dn -NK som Ow some narrative films may be incoherence or lack of conviction, in others the continual friction with naturalism may generate a new field of meaning or enjoyment. In short, accident can play a positive role in all types of sound-image relations. Bennett's Backlash, for example, is dominated by what might be called accidental-structural relations. Two police officers arrest an aboriginal Australian woman for a mur- der she did not commit, drive her from Sydney back to the scene of the crime, and in the course of many misadventures come to befriend her and find the real murderer. The narrative is sometimes im- plausible and verges on a bland Stanley Kramer tract against prejudice. What redeems it is the gritty effect of a structural dissonance between images Mal ?x. . ... ...... 4x? 0 ... . ......... xx: . . . .... . . . . . . . . . . . . .. ...... 75 tzl 's. MM Throughout the Australian film Back- lash, there is a contrast between the precisely composed images and the partly improvised dialogue.</page><page sequence="6">&lt;i7 sy Sound and structure: In Vertigo, background music is rigorously absent from the scenes with Midge (left), present in those with Judy/Madeleine (right). and sound track: the former are carefully com- posed and often beautiful, while the dialogue is to a large extent improvised and casual. Although Bennett could have planned this dissonance, a film- maker is unlikely to consider that his own script needs to be saved by a continual dosage of contra- dictions. Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers il- lustrates an accidental-nodal relation after a woman declares that her uncle is no longer her uncle, al- though he looks and sounds the same. In scenes of the uncle mowing the lawn no attempt seems to have been made to have the bit player suggest any strangeness; both the performance and camerawork seem pedestrian. Yet in opposition to the niece's impassioned "He's not my uncle!" the blandness of the image becomes even more disquieting than any sinister display. As for accidental-disruptive relations, there are several examples in Fleming's Bombshell, in which movie star Lola Burns (Jean Harlow) finds her life continually being manipu- lated by her press agent Hanlon (Lee Tracy). The film opens with a crescendo of confusion as Burns confronts various demands and minor crises before leaving for the studio. Instead of following this with a quiet interlude that would let the humor sink in, the film cuts to a scene that begins at top pitch with a rival actress who rushes to an angry confron- tation with Hanlon as he gabbles on the phone. Since the film's structure shows other kinds of weaknesses (for example, the slack subplot involv- ing Burns's whim to adopt a baby) this disruptive confirmation is probably unintentional; yet such "errors" help to transform a routine screwball comedy into an unusual comedy of paranoia. Although I believe that the disruptive relations in Vertigo derive less from accident than from Hitchcock's sense of the dynamics of the narrative film, this belief is not essential to my present argu- ment. Whenever the ground state of accidental sound-image relations emerges in its most potent form, as disruption, it can force the viewer-auditor to reappraise what he or she is seeing and hearing. This is likely to enhance the film, no matter whether the disruption comes from error, planning, or serendipity. Putting Theory to the Sound-Image Test Many assertions about the nature of film are based either on the image alone or on the concept of a "perfect marriage" in which sound faithfully supports the image. This is true even when there is no mention of sound or image, as in Barthes's con- tention cited earlier that every element in a narra- tive is functional with respect to the narrative. With more extended theories, the test of sound- image relations may prove damaging to different degrees. For example, any theory based on the con- cept of film as a kind of language invariably as- sumes that film consists of a single channel, like a succession of written letters or of spoken sounds, and the syntagmas and paradigms of that chan- nel are invariably taken to be visual scenes. Here I focus on two well-known theories that draw on psychoanalysis. In general, the psychoanalytic ap- proach reflects the lack of interest in sound (as dis- tinct from language) that characterizes the work of Freud and Lacan. For example, Freud not only fo- cused on images as the source of symbols in dreams but also depreciated the role of sound by asserting that speech in dreams regularly repeats speech heard in waking life.19 With Lacan, the importance of the mirror stage in his theory of subjectivity has, when applied to film, kept the scales tipped in favoi of the image. As Mary Ann Doane says, "Freudian and Lacanian texts appear to be privileged at least 29</page><page sequence="7">partially for their ability to generate convincing scenarios which act as condensations of several larger psychical structures or as evocations of a particularly crucial 'turning point' or movement: the primal scene, the mirror stage, the 'look' at the mother's (castrated) body, the fort/da game, etc. Needless to say, many of these scenarios are chosen because they activate a specifically visual regis- ter."20 It is not surprising that one of the most often quoted psychoanalytic studies of film con- tains this statement: "The film is what I receive S. . and I only need close my eyes to suppress it."2 A central postulate of much psychoanalytic theory is that (classical) film reinforces the viewer's illusory ego by presenting a world of apparent plen- itude in which the film-maker's voice and methods of presentation are concealed. The most basic form of this postulate is the theory of structure. As applied to film, suture began with the asser- tion that the viewer is sustained by the apparent plenitude of shot/reverse shot alternation.22 This assumes not only that sound plays an insignificant role in the filmic experience but also that the shot is the sole basis of filmic structure. Although the structural dominance of the visual shot is rarely questioned23 it is easy to do so; in Vertigo, for ex- ample, a major articulation occurs in mid-shot. As I mentioned earlier, incidental music is absent from the scenes featuring Midge and present in those where Johnny's obsession flourishes unchecked; the latter gradually become longer at the expense of the former to the point where, in one scene with Johnny and Midge, the music resumes as soon as Midge leaves the frame. In any case, even in terms of the image alone, the assumption of the early suture theorists that clas- sical cinema depended entirely on shot/reverse shot alternation was so far out of line with reality that it had to be modified to allow for other and more prevalent types of cuts, as well as fades and other visual interruptions. One modifier, Stephen Heath, remarked on the exclusion of sound but made no attempt to include it; he also gave the ideological game away by conceding that there was suture in a nonbourgeois film such as Akerman's News from Home but "it did not suture in the way of the sys- tem. . . "24 In short, since suture could not be aimed at techniques used exclusively by bourgeois cinema, it would be defined as innocuous with ideo- logically acceptable films and repressive with all the rest. Kaja -Silverman tried to find a less Humpty- Dumptyish way of saving the concept of suture. While acknowledging that classical films may con- tinually disrupt the viewer's absorption-her anal- ysis of Hitchcock's Psycho adduces almost as many breaks as I find disruptive relations in Vertigo- she contends that they retain their psychic grip by means of narrative: "the more the operations of enunciation are revealed to the viewing subject, the more tenacious is its desire for the comfort and closure of narrative. ..."25 At this point the origi- nal concept of suture has been turned around to be- come the withholding of plenitude throughout most of the film. Its final refuge, according to Sil- verman, is the ending: "The standard format of the classic cinematic text . . . disrupt[s] the existing symbolic order, dislocat[es] the subject-positions within it, and challeng[es] its ideals of coherence and fullness only in order subsequently to reaffirm that order, those positions, and those ideals."26 In many classic films, however, this so-called reaffirmation is flimsy or perfunctory, and made even more so by sound-image relations.27 In Gould- ing's The Flame Within a woman psychiatrist (Ann Harding) declines the marriage proposal of a male colleague (Herbert Marshall) because he expects her to give up her practice. Right at the end, however, she accepts his proposal, and incidental music surges up as she leans her head on his shoulder. This strong confirmation was probably intended to be nodal, but because there has been no other inci- dental music since the opening credits the relation instead becomes disruptive, placing brackets around the "happy" ending and making it disposable. In Brown's Possessed28 Marion (Joan Crawford) be- comes the mistress of a prominent businessman, Mark (Clark Gable), who runs for political office. When his opponent makes a campaign issue of their relation, Marion announces that she will leave; but the film ends with Mark telling her that they will succeed or fail together. This reunion takes place on a street at night in a rainstorm, and the tender closeness of Marion and Mark is accompanied by the continuous hissing of rain-a sound that is new to the film. This unexpected opposition, like the confirmation in The Flame Within, becomes dis- ruptive and places brackets around the ending. 30</page><page sequence="8">Even without such brackets the assertion of su- tured endings is unconvincing because it is based on two incorrect assumptions. First, Silverman ap- pears to treat sound and image as a "perfect mar- riage": "The totality [my emphasis] of image and sound tracks permits it to engage simultaneously in the discourses of the unconscious and the precon- scious."29 Even in a later study that promises to focus on the sound track, Silverman does not reex- amine this assumption. "As other writers have noted, Hollywood's sonic vraisemblable stresses unity and anthropomorphism. It subordinates the auditory to the visual track, nonhuman sounds to the human voice, and 'noise' to speech. It also con- tains the human voice within the fiction or diege- sis. . . . The emphasis upon diegetic speech acts to suture the viewer/listener. . . . It is thus the sound analogue of the shot/reverse shot formation.""3 This attempt to depict sound as a simple reinforce- ment of visual suture in the classic Hollywood film overlooks the fact that, outside some documen- taries and experimental films, diegetic speech is dominant in virtually all cinema-including anti- bourgeois films and most independent feminist films. In any case, as I stressed earlier, even syn- chronized speech is mediated separately from the image and may be postrecorded and/or manipu- lated in various ways: there is always a gap between the image strip and the sound track. The second erroneous assumption involved in the concept of sutured endings is that the viewer- auditor experiences a film in "strikeover mode"- that nothing within the film leaves a durable mark on him or her but that each successive shot erases what has gone before. As Silverman puts it in an- other context, "the spectator is always caught up in the flow of cinematic images."'3 But of course there is no such soundless flow, and the cumulative effect of accidental and disruptive relations can leave a far stronger impression than a brief and contrived ending. Thus the ending of Vertigo, in which Judy is "justly" punished for complicity in murder, is far outweighed by the preceding disrup- tions that reveal the anger and insecurity beneath Johnny's romantic obsession with Madeleine. Another psychoanalytic approach to film that has been developed in recent years, especially by feminist theorists, focuses on the (male) viewer's gaze. The contention here is that the classic film is steeped in patriarchy: the camera's view represents the male characters, while female characters are de- nied (or tightly restricted in) the power to view and are, instead, viewed. The effect of this is to relieve the male viewer's anxiety over lack or castration by (a) masking the lack of real objects on the screen and (b) displacing the lack of the phallus onto the female characters.32 By now it should be clear that a theory founded on only one of the two channels of film is precari- ous: to gain conviction it must, if it can, take into account the continual interaction of sound and image. Any such revision of the theory of the gaze would also have to deal with two further problems. First, if photographic realism is needed to mask a lack that would cause anxiety, why are animated cartoons popular? With animation, as I remarked earlier, the junction of sound and image is mani- festly synthetic and there is no illusion of photo- graphic reality. Second, there is a mismatch between the ultimate target of feminist theorists-patri- archal society-and their immediate target, the classic film. For example, the locus of power in a film cannot be determined solely by camera place- ment, framing, and the editing of the image strip, as a critic such as Doane assumes in her shot-by- shot analysis of sequences from Negulesco's Hu- moresque.33 Voice quality and miking also play a crucial part, and so do the content and context of a scene. Thus a female character such as that played by Barbara Stanwyck in Preston Sturges's The Lady Eve or by Helen Vinson in Goulding's Nightmare Alley has more (personal) power than the male protagonist in large part because her voice is crisper and her speech more fluent. By contrast, when Stella Dallas (Stanwyck), at the end of King Sound qualifies the gaze: In The Lady Eve, Barbara Stanwyck's crisp voice emphasizes her character's personal power over men. .. ......... . ..... . . . . . . ........... ......... . ............. . . . ......... .. ......... ... ...... A-4 SO</page><page sequence="9">Vidor's film of that name, looks in through the window at her successfully married daughter, she has the view but certainly not the social power. Often the locus of power is more elusive, as in Cukor's Girls About Town, about two women, Wanda (Kay Francis) and Marie (Lilyan Tashman), who make a living as escorts. Within their cultur- ally subordinate positions Wanda and Marie con- tinually gain control over men as individuals, and this ambiguity emerges in the sound track and image strip, which sometimes are in direct conflict. Thus the film opens with the camera following the two women as they enter the powder room of a nightclub to repair their make-up. While the image may seem to be pandering to the male voyeur or fetishist, the sound track is doing something quite different: the women are making critical and de- risive remarks about the two businessmen who have hired them for the evening (and whose clumsy passes they later elude). Certainly a critic who as- sumes that power resides in the image will miss the irony of a scene in which Marie teaches another client (Eugene Pallette) to whistle a tune-a rever- sal of power in what was considered to be a male accomplishment. A scene in Whale's comedy-mystery Remember Last Night? offers an even more direct challenge to the theory of the male gaze. The female lead (Con- stance Cummings) knocks out a police aide and, with the help of two other women, drags him away by the ankles; they pass either side of a pillar, against which his crotch collides, until they back- track and maneuver him to a closet. Meanwhile a church bell begins to clang as soon as the aide is knocked out and continues through the rest of the image scene. Beyond the physical implication of the aide's brief contact with the pillar, psychoanalytic theorists will be aware that it represents, in Laca- nian terms, his illusory possession of the phallus. The sound track reinforces the physical implication by its unexpected sonority; as for its psychoanalytic implication, "bell" is a near-homophone of "ball," the suspension of bells resembles that of testicles, and both "clanger" and "clapper" are obsolescent British slang terms for "testicle" (director Whale was British). This passage, surely, is not defense but a castrative revel. Although theorists of the gaze might try to dis- miss the foregoing example as a comic exception to the rule, its insistent and narratively unmotivated layer of sound gives it unusual emphasis. By focus- ing on the image to the virtual exclusion of sound, theorists can too easily see only what they expect to see. Their confusion between the dynamics of the classic film and the dominant culture in which it operates may well derive from the 1934 Produc- tion Code, which attempted to impose the latter rigidly on the former. Thus Doane confidently as- serts that "prostitution is absolutely irrecuperable [in the classic film]" although a single pre-Code film is enough to refute her. In Buzzell's Virtue an ex-hooker, Mae (Carole Lombard), marries a cab driver, Jimmy (Pat O'Brien), who fancies himself as an expert on women and believes she worked as a secretary. When the truth emerges he is shattered at first but then decides to honor the marriage. Mae, however, accuses him of still treating her with underlying suspicion and resentment; she insists on -and eventually obtains-complete acceptance. Virtue is particularly relevant to sound-image relations because it contains two major disruptive passages that echo the disruptive content. After their city hall marriage, Mae and Jimmy are caught up in a group of press photographers who are fol- lowing and taking flash pictures of three politi- cians. The viewer-auditor is likely to assume (a la Barthes) that this incident serves a narrative func- tion-that one of the politicians will be a former john of Mae's, or that she will be recognized from appearing in a published photo-but Jimmy's dis- covery of her past comes from an entirely differ- ent source. The explosion of activity in both the image (rapid movement, flashes) and the sound (footsteps, overlapping voices) is almost pure dis- ruption. The other major passage is a melodramatic subplot involving one of Mae's fellow hookers, who prevails on Mae to lend her some of the house- hold savings for medical treatment but is actually working a scam at the insistence of her crooked boyfriend. At one point Mae goes to demand the money back while Jimmy suspiciously follows her. It is night and heavy rain is falling. On the window shade of the hooker's apartment Jimmy sees the sil- houettes of what he takes to be Mae and a man em- bracing; in fact it is the boyfriend holding the body of the hooker, whom he has hit and accidentally killed. Later Jimmy sees the boyfriend silhouetted against the frosted glass door of a bathroom and 32</page><page sequence="10">I.J. BJA ........ M. A sudden flurry of movement and sound creates a disruptive scene in Virtue: After a cabbie marries an ex-prostitute posing as a secretary, they find themselves confronting the media- whose interest is in the city pols in the background. immediately recognizes him as the man in the win- dow. Both passages are marked by unusual sound- image relations: in the former, the sound of rainfall (which, as in Possessed, occurs nowhere else in the film) accompanying a patch of bright light amid darkness; in the latter, Jimmy's sudden shout ac- companying the appearance of the silhouette as the bathroom light is switched on. Although it is easy to dismiss the subplot as implausible and redun- dant, the disruptive sound-image relations enlarge its impact. They crack open the smooth unfolding of the main narrative and challenge the viewer- auditor to fit the subplot into the film's structure and meaning-to find, for example, that it repre- sents a drama within Jimmy as he comes to recog- nize how his hurt pride and suspicion made him a would-be killer of Mae. Virtue demonstrates how the complexity of the narrative film and of its sound-image relations can make it as much an ob- stacle to as a vehicle for the patriarchal culture in which it is created.34 Taking Stock Although my analysis of sound-image relations and their effects applies to all types of films, includ- ing animation, documentary, and experimental, I have focused mainly on the classic Hollywood film because that is the source of examples favored by most current theorists. It also happens to be part of the broader realm in which sound-image relations are most easily misperceived-the photographic narrative in general, regardless of origin or ideol- ogy. In any discussion of the photographic narra- tive the realistic illusion plays such a central role- whether accepted or challenged-that the equally important role of sound-image relations in the film itself is easily overlooked. The interplay between what is seen and heard and how it is seen and heard is the basis for any full understanding of a film. This interplay is often marked by tension or dis- parity. As I have shown, there is also much tension and disparity on the basic level of sound-image re- 33</page><page sequence="11">lations, thanks to the separate mediation of the two channels. Such dualisms are typical of film in all its aspects, whether aesthetic, social, or economic. Film is ephemeral but repeatable; full of apparent movement but devoid of movement; a young me- dium that is already a relic of the mechanical age; the product of a multi-million dollar industry or of a loner working on a shoestring; immediate in its impact yet always presenting the past. Such polar- ities may account for the fascination of narrative film more convincingly than current psychoanalytic theories. After all, why do so many critics of bour- geois ideology reach back 40 or 50 years for their filmic examples? One plausible reason is that they themselves are fascinated by the dynamics of the classic film, which is usually shorter and filled with more incident (often digressive) than recent com- mercial films, so that the interplay between narra- tive and sound-image relations is more intense. The separate unfolding of the sound track and image strip gives every film a head start toward Bakhtin's dialogic imagination. Many films, of course, fail to go any farther, and others advance only a few steps here and there. But even the most routine narrative contains forces that can fissure its self-imposed limits. Notes 1. The Liberation of Echo: A New Hearing for Film Sound, Film Quarterly, v. XXXVIII, no. 4, Summer 1985, pages 2-12. This article will be referred to as FS1. 2. In "In Defense of Talking Film," Persistence of Vision, no. 5, Spring 1987, pages 17-27, Mary Devereaux dem- onstrates the importance of sound (dialogue) in an apparently image-dominated sequence of Hitchcock's Notorious. In A Life in Movies: An Autobiography (New York, 1987), while praising silent movies (e.g., page 168), Michael Powell also reveals his concern with sound in Edge of the World (page 258), One of Our Aircraft Is Missing (pages 289-91), A Canterbury Tale (page 448), I Know Where I'm Going (page 537), and Black Narcissus (pages 581-5). 3. Of course, the image can have its own excesses, as with the 1960s epidemic of rapid cutting, freeze frames, and the like. 4. Thus in "Moving Lips: Cinema As Ventriloquism," Yale French Studies, no. 60, 1980, pages 67-79, Rick Altman asserts the importance of sound by transferring primacy to it from the image. (Subsequently Altman reverted almost completely to belief in image primacy: see note 10.) Roy Armes, in "Entendre, C'est Comprendre: In Defence of Sound Reproduction," Screen, v. 29, no. 2, Spring 1988, pages 8-22, ends his often perceptive anal- ysis by arbitrarily dividing film into two realms, one ruled by the image and the other by sound: "The image may rule in conventional narrative, but documentary is self- evidently a form in which the diegesis is verbal." 5. There is a paradoxical analogy between the assumption that, in film, sound is inferior to image and the general assumption challenged by Derrida that writing is inferior to speech. 6. As Gerald Mast points out, most theorists have ignored animation when defining film (Film/Cinema/Movie: A Theory of Experience, Chicago and London, 1977/1983, page 4). 7. See FSI, pages 6-8, for fuller details. 8. These are in fact the kinds of relations that I chose mainly to discuss in FS1. 9. Umberto Eco, A Theory of Semiotics, Bloomington and London, 1976, especially the summary on pages 233-4. 10. There is, for example, no challenge to image-bound seg- mentation or coding in Genre: The Musical, ed. Rick Altman (London, Boston and Henley, 1981), even in Raymond Bellour's "Segmenting/Analysing," pages 102-133, or in Altman's critique of Bellour, page 203. In Altman's later study, The American Film Musical (Bloomington and Indianapolis, 1987), his only new state- ment about the role of sound is summed up thus: "The traditional classical narrative hierarchy of image over sound is reversed at the climactic moments of the musi- cal" (page 109). A decade earlier, in challenging the widespread acceptance of Christian Metz's grande syntag- matique, Brian Henderson had noted its failure to deal with such elements as sound and questioned the possibil- ity of establishing any systematic coding of film as a whole ("Segmentation," Film Quarterly, v. XXXI no. 1, Fall 1977, pages 57-65). 11. Roland Barthes, Image, Music, Text, New York, 1977, page 89. 12. Such a change may depend on the viewer-auditor's altered perception of a sound or image element that remains the same. In Hathaway's Kiss of Death, when Nick (Victor Mature) crouches in hiding in a shadowy corner of his house, the highlight on his white-shirted figure seems to turn him into a flat and abstract shape. And in Resnais's Last Year at Marienbad, an indirect remark in the dia- logue turns a percussive sound that seems to form part of the incidental music into the diegetic chiming of a clock. 13. These are, of course, "silent" films, and unlike commer- cial films of the era before synchronized sound they are projected without any separate music accompaniment. I cite them as a reminder that silence is itself a sound ele- ment that interacts with the image. 14. In FS1, my remarks about the use of sound and image in Naruse's Meshi and the films of Ozu and Vertov were about structural relations. 15. Here, as with many films, sound-image relations provide a supplementary tool for evaluating films. If The Maltese Falcon seems the better noir film, it may be not merely because it deals continually with loss, failure, and rejec- 34</page><page sequence="12">tion and has an appropriately downbeat ending but also because its structural opposition endows it with a continu- ous underlying tension that The Big Sleep lacks. 16. The examples on pages 7-9 of FS1 are all nodal, though not identified as such. 17. Several of these occur after Johnny's hospitalization, when the emphasis begins to shift from the romantic mys- tery of the first half of the film to the human tension of the second half. For example, Johnny's discharge from hospital is represented by a pan across sunlit white houses together with incidental music that progresses from a ro- mantic combination of strings, woodwind, and harp to a triumphant orchestral tutti. Although Johnny is ostensibly cured, he is still obsessed with the "dead" Madeleine, and the sudden euphoric confirmation is disconcerting. 18. Even the most minimal of abstract films cannot exclude accidental relations that result from the grain of the film stock, from scratches and other visual flaws, and (if the film has a sound track) from background noise, all of which play an increasingly prominent role as the visual and aural content is reduced. Landow's Film That Rises to the Surface of Clarified Butter is a study in the shift- ing relations between such cumulative accidents and con- tinuous silence. 19. This assertion occurs many times; for example, in The In- terpretation of Dreams, Dora: An Analysis of a Case of Hysteria, Jensen's "Gradiva, "Notes Upon a Case of Ob- sessional Neurosis, and Introductory Lectures on Psycho- analysis. In my experience Freud was wrong; but in any case the role of sound in dreams proves nothing about its role in films. 20. Mary Ann Doane, The Desire to Desire, Bloomington and Indianapolis, 1987, page 14. 21. Christian Metz, The Imaginary Signifier, Bloomington, 1982, page 51. While Metz intermittently mentions sound -e.g., he refers parenthetically to the signifier of the film flux as "images accompanied by sound and movement" (page 124)-it plays virtually no role in his psychoanalytic theorizing. 22. See Jean-Pierre Oudart, "Cinema and Suture," Screen, v. 18 no. 4, Winter 1977-8, pages 35-47; and Daniel Dayan, "The Tutor-code of Classical Cinema," Film Quarterly, v. XXVIII no. 1, Fall 1974, pages 22-31. 23. As Kaja Silverman puts it: "Theoreticians of cinematic suture . . . are . . . in fundamental accord with Noel Burch's remark that 'Although camera movements, en- trances into and exits from frame, composition and so on can all function as devices aiding in the organization of the film object . . the shot transition [remains] the basic element [of that organization].' Shot relations are seen as the equivalent of syntactic ones in linguistic discourse, as the agency whereby meaning emerges and a subject-posi- tion is constructed for the viewer" (The Subject of Semi- otics, New York, 1983, page 201). 24. Stephen Heath, Questions of Cinema, Bloomington, 1981, page 100. 25. Silverman, op. cit., page 213. 26. Ibid., page 221. In Mythologies (New York, 1972, page 41) Barthes had generalized this format as "Operation Margarine," citing as a cinematic example the shifting at- titudes toward the military in Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity. 27. In films such as LeRoy's I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang and Mayo's Black Legion, of course, along with such comedies as Bombshell and Conway's Red Headed Woman, there is no reaffirmation at all. 28. Not to be confused with Bernhardt's later film of the same title, also with Joan Crawford. 29. Silverman, op. cit., page 85. 30.

In its details, how- ever, the theory of the male gaze, originally due to Laura Mulvey, varies from one writer to another: compare, for example, Teresa de Lauretis in Alice Doesn't: Feminism, Semiotics, Cinema (Bloomington, 1984), Silverman in The Acoustic Mirror, Doane in The Desire to Desire, and Tania Modleski in The Women Who Knew Too Much: Hitchcock and Feminist Theory (New York and London, 1988). In any case, it is not so much the psychoanalytic details that are at issue here as the importance attached to the image. 33. Doane, op. cit., page 97ff. 34. Modleski, op. cit., is one feminist critic who does ac- knowledge this kind of complexity. IS THERE ANY WAY TO FIND MY FAVORITE OLD FILM ON VIDEO?
