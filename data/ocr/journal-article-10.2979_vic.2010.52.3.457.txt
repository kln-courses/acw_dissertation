<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> BOOK rEViEW Darwin and the Memory of the Human: Evolution, Savages, and  South America, by Cannon Schmitt; pp. xii + 243. Cambridge and new  York: Cambridge University press, 2009, £50.00, $90.00. Gowan Dawson in December 1832 H.M.S. Beagle reached the southernmost tip of South America, Tierra del Fuego. During an inland expedition from the ship, the Beagle’s gentlemanly naturalist witnessed, for  the very first time, the “sight of a naked savage in his native land.” This  was, Charles Darwin later reflected, “an event which can never be  forgotten” (qtd. in Schmitt 38). Darwin’s already much-discussed initial  encounter with this miserable and abject (or so he assumed) Fuegian  on a wild and desolate shore at the farthest reaches of the earth stands  at the very centre of Cannon Schmitt’s fascinating Darwin and the  Memory of the Human, and is, as it were, repeatedly circled around and  viewed from a number of different perspectives. As an instance of what  Schmitt describes as a “savage mnemonics,” this literarily unforget- table encounter instigates a “play of memory and forgetting” that is  actually “requisite to theorizing evolution” (56). While coming to terms  with evolution necessitates a forgetting of what is disagreeable (things  such as starvation or extinction), the memory of the Fuegian—and  so-called savages more generally—cannot be so easily erased, and,  Schmitt proposes, thus allows, or perhaps even forces, Darwin to think  through and understand the workings of natural selection. in partic- ular, the wretched Fuegian whom Darwin appears to have considered  somehow less civilized than charmingly anthropomorphic animals  with an incipient sense of virtue, such as loyal domestic dogs or brave  kindly monkeys, allowed him to recognize that the hitherto sanctified  concept of the human was in fact merely an arbitrary rhetorical  construct rather than an actual entity, and to instead postulate an  evolutionary continuum between the putatively human and inhuman.

At the same time, the  suggestion that an incipient racism might have helped facilitate  Darwin’s thinking about human evolution recalls george levine’s  argument in Darwin Loves You (2006) that Darwin’s thinking on issues  like sexual selection, with its radical emphasis on female choice, was  actually enabled by his own adherence to reactionary Victorian values,  which caused him to be disconcerted by the apparent agency of females  in animal courtship and thus to attend to it still more closely in  constructing his theory. Unlike levine’s book, Darwin and the Memory  of the Human also examines other evolutionary thinkers from a similar  perspective. Alfred russel Wallace’s own first encounters with the “true  denizen[s] of the Amazonian forests” in the late 1840s (65), for instance,  were themselves “not to be forgotten” because of his favourable impres- sion of their autonomy and self-possession (64); a “xenophilic comple- ment” to Darwin’s equally marked chauvinism according to Schmitt  (65). Yet Wallace’s delight in the remarkable dignity and capacities of  these indigenous peoples, whose customs he often views as more civi- lized than those of capitalist and industrial Britain, compels him to  postulate humankind as something unique and exceptional that must  have evolved to its high condition by the guidance of an external intel- ligence rather than merely through the secular processes of natural  selection. There is, Schmitt’s persuasive account implies (although it is  at no point made explicit), no contradiction between those “Victorian”  aspects of Darwin’s attitudes that we might now feel distinctly uncom- fortable with and the most radical and apparently modern components  of his evolutionary theorising. The central focus of Schmitt’s argument, however, is neither  Darwin nor his dismayed response to savage humanity in the raw, and  with the chapter specifically on Darwin actually the shortest in the  book—at just twenty-four pages, when there is a thirty-page chapter on  Charles Kingsley and ones of thirty-four pages each on Wallace and W.  H. Hudson—Darwin and the Memory of the Human is a rather misleading  title that most likely appealed to a publisher with an eye on the 2009  anniversaries. instead, it is the role of South America in the imaginary of   ViCTOriAn STUDiES / VOlUmE 52, nO. 3 </page> <page sequence="3"> rEViEW FOrUm On CHArlES DArWin AnD DArWiniAnA 459 nineteenth-century Britain that is the central concern of the book, some- thing that Schmitt shows to be a veritable “South Americomania” that  was every bit as significant as the Victorian fascination with other regions  of the globe (6). As a locus of the primitive or atavistic, or what Anne  mcClintock has theorized in Imperial Leather (1995) as an “anachronistic  space,” the South America that was explored by Darwin, Wallace, and  Hudson, or just imagined longingly by Kingsley, enabled a series of recol- lections and even recapitulations, of past explorations and conquests no  less than of phylogenetic genealogies, that “give coherence to a human  (modern, British) subject” that is defined by an assumed position on the  evolutionary ladder of progress and the historical destiny of Britain as an  imperial nation-state (26). in an intriguing and suggestive coda, Schmitt also speculates on  the “memory of loss” central to the evolutionary recognition that we are  defined (58), as products of natural and sexual selection, by what we are  no longer, the organisms we have evolved from, and never again can be,  even while we retain uncanny reminders or residual vestiges of what we  once were. As such, nineteenth-century evolutionism, Schmitt proposes,  can be understood as “both the discovery of and response to disaster”  and “bears surprisingly close resemblance to the diverse set of present- day intellectual practices united under the umbrella of memory studies”  (157). While the implicit comparison of the nature of memory involved in  Darwin’s theories and twentieth-century traumas such as the Holocaust is  not entirely persuasive, at its best Darwin and the Memory of the Human  affords a highly instructive model for integrating contemporary theoriza- tions of memory with the study of Victorian culture and science.
