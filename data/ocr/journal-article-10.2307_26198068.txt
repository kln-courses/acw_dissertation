<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Self-Disclosure of God. Principles of Ibn al-'Arabi's Cosmology By William C. Chittick. Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 1998. Pp. xl+483. Price PB $24.95. 0-7914-3404-4. Some books are almost too rich to be reviewed in a few pages because the wealth of information is so overwhelming that the reviewer stands before the volume, wide-eyed with admiration. William Chittick's new study of Ibn al-'Arabl's cosmology belongs to this category. During recent years publications about the great master have proliferated, and Chittick has proved himself the undisputed leader (besides Michel Chodkiewicz) in this field. After some dec ades of immersing himself in Ibn al-'Arabl's work, mainly the Futuhat al-makkiyya, he offers a fresh insight into the complicated web of the Andalusian theosophist, admired as the greatest master by many, hated as an arch heretic by many others. Chittick outlined Ibn al-'Arabl's thought system in his previous books, in particular in The Sufi Path of Knowledge-, and here he selects one very special aspect of his thought, that is the cosmology, which is central to his system as it comprises the 'self-disclosure of God'. (The sceptic will ask: 'But how do we know that this is what God really did?') For me, the lengthy introduction to the voluminous book is the best approach to Ibn al-'Arabl ever written because Chittick very clearly outlines the character</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS istics of his way of thinking and shows that he 'shifts perspectives ... He has no specific point to which he wants to get.' This, of course, makes impossible an approach by logic or rational argumentation, and the reader must abandon himself to the 'ocean without shore' into which Ibn al-'Arab! draws him. One of the key concepts of the relationship between humans and the Divine is summed up in the statement 'that we conceive of the Divine, the Real, only in anthropomorphical terms because we can only conceive things in terms of ourselves ... while human attributes are theomorphic as God is the only Real, and human beings are real only inasmuch as they possess a reality given to them by God' (xviii). For, as poets all over the Islamic world after the late thirteenth century have expressed it, everything created is like a mirror, like pieces of glass, which are real only in so far as they are touched by the rays of light that emerges from the Real, while the mirror's back is dark not-being. The above-mentioned remark about anthropomorphic and theomorphic qualit ies in God and man respectively answers also the question of many an orthodox reader: how can God be revealed, or recognized, by everyone as 'the god of his or her belief' and not as something Absolute? For nothing categorically firm can be said about the Essence of God, which cannot be discussed nor be referred to. Ibn al-'Arabl, as Chittick states, plumbs the depths of the Qur'anic universe, and such a plumbing, as we find in the meditations of all great Sufis, makes it difficult to translate certain keywords with all their overtones, and here a difficulty is encountered that is well known to everyone who has translated sacred texts from the Arabic or any of the Islamic languages. Chittick has chosen for this reason a more poetic approach to the translation of the Qur'an and the related texts; he criticizes, rightly, those who try to translate the scriptures in overly 'logical' or rationalist terms, which is true not only for English translations but also for those in other languages. It proves Chittick's scholarly honesty that he has listed a good number of new formulations of concepts he had translated differently in his earlier works: this list is most welcome and helpful to the student of Ibn al-Arabl. A fascinating part of the introduction is the scheme of cosmic degrees as expressed through the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet, which begins with the letter pronounced most deeply in the throat, that is, the hamza. This mystical alphabet must have been widely known among later Sufis; for in a modern Pakistani publication, Dhauqi's Sirr-i dilbaran (1968) (allusion to Rumi's Matbnawi, vol. I, line 136) the Chishti-Sabiri master teaches this alphabetical order to his students for the purpose of meditation. (See my Calligraphy and Islamic Culture (1990), 135f.) We have dwelt upon the introduction or, to be frank, small parts of the introduction without entering into the great problems of life, the question 'what is ivujud', or 'the Face of God', or the topic of the barzakk. As I said in the beginning, Chittick leads his readers in a very extensive way through the complicated web of Ibn al-'Arabl's thought, supporting his ideas with lengthy quotations from the Futuhat, so that the book contains almost an anthology culled from its different chapters. Worthy of mention are also some</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 305 excerpts about three early Sufis, al-Sabtl, Rabi'a of Basra, and Abd al-Qadir al-JTlanl whose fame was already remarkable during Ibn al-'Arabl's time (he died one year after the Andalusian master was born). The book contains numerous indexes, not only of persons and Qur'anic quotations but also of Arabic words, technical terms, etc., which form a little encyclopedia in themselves. One cannot but admire Chittick who so aptly brings to us the world of the great master, attracting even those of us who have difficulties in approaching, let alone entering into, this gigantic spiritual universe. We do hope that the next volume, The Breath of the All-Merciful, will follow before long, and congratulate the author on his breathtaking study. Annemarie Schimmel Bonn</page></plain_text>
