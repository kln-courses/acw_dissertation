"Religion as a Humanizing Factor," South. Hum. Rev., 4 (1970), 197 201. "The religious imagination, as the sense of the sacred and the holy, is the root of that ethical sensitivity which is the mark of humanity. In the culture of the university, there are signs of the recovery of this religious imagination in the humanities, while in the social sciences, a scientism precluding a sense of reverence is the established faith." [LB] 2800 Dean, William D. Coming To: A Theology of Beauty. Philadelphia: Westminster, 1972. Using the writings of Harvey Cox, David Miller, Robert Neale, and Sam Keen as a springboard for his argument, Dean per ceives in them the common themes of imagination and celebration, both dimen sions of the aesthetic in man. But Dean is disturbed that amid all the revelry of playing and dancing, festive comedy and games, the source and ends of imagina tion and celebration have not been explored. What Dean therefore proposes, relying on the writings of A. N. Whitehead, is a 39</page><page sequence="2">metaphysics and an ethics, in brief a theology, for this new worship of beauty. [NV] 2801 Detweiler, Robert. "Religion as a Humanizing Factor in Literature," South. Hum. Rev., 4 (1970), 201-206. "One cannot prove that Christianity has had a human izing effect upon creative literature... but Christianity has always been vitally involved in Western poetry, fiction, and drama." [LB] 2802 Hamilton, Kenneth. "Comedy in a Theological Perspective," Religion in Life, XLI (Summer 1972), 222-232. Comedy is powerless to deal with death. By itself it leads to despair or a frozen resignation. Tragedy has the last word in human existence unless faith perceives the God who alone brings life out of death in the comedy of redemp tion. [LAB] 2803 Hunter, Howard, ed. Humanities, Religion, and the Arts Tomorrow. New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1972. A dozen essays by several writers. Tom F. Driver, Stanley Hopper, Nathan Scott, and Robert Steele face theoretical issues and specific challenges within literature, painting, drama, and film. Intended either as a book for general readers or as a textbook. [NV] 2804 McGee, Michael C. "Thematic Reduplication in Christian Ritual," Quart. Journ. of Speech, 56 (1970), 196-204. "An examina tion of the pattern of Christian preaching from medieval times to the late eighteenth century illustrates the subtle but signi ficant impact of Christian attitudes on evolving rhetorical theory." 40</page><page sequence="3">2805 Manning, Stephen, "Typology and the Literary Critic," Amer. Lit., 5:1, pt. 1 (1970), 51-73. Typology takes many forms in medieval allegorical interpretations of Scripture and literature. For the contem porary critic, though he must handle typological interpretation with caution, there are two main types of typology — "exegetical . . . theological, pseudo historical, and allegorical" and "natural... either arbitrary or else rooted in the concept of analogy of being." Reprinted as "Scriptural Exegesis and the Literary Critic," in Typology and Early American Literature, ed. Sacvan Bercovitch [Amherst: U. of Massachusetts Press, 1972], pp. 47 66. [LB] 2806 Jarrett-Kerr, Martin. "Christian Faith and the African Imagination," Religion in Life, XLI (Winter 1972), 554-568. African poets and novelists express the conviction in their works that Christianity destroyed traditional African culture, religion, society. Probably Christian belief will not be found in African writers in the foreseeable future. Christian imagery and language is transferred to traditional African religion. Works concerned with the latter show valuable elements which cannot be ignored by Christians. [LAB] 2807 van Kaam, Adrian and Kathleen Healy. The Demon and the Dove: Personality Growth Through Literature. Duquesne University Press, 1967. 308pp. Bibliog raphy. $4.95 A psychologist and a literary critic demonstrate their exis tential psychological analysis of five pieces of literature which offer 41</page><page sequence="4">possibilities for personality growth through self-understanding. Part one, "Personality in Transformation," analyzes the role of psychology and literature in identifying the depths of human experience. Personality develop ment is shown to be possible only through continual death to an outgrown self, existential decision to rise above and beyond one's immediate experience, and rebirth to a new life on deeper levels of existence. Part two, "Personality in Literature," skillfully combines exis tential psychological theory with literary criticism and analyzes five characters to demonstrate the universal conflict between "the demon and the dove" in man. The characters are Angelo in Measure for Measure, Anna Karenina, John Marcher Tn~ The Beast in the Jungle, Jean-Baptiste in The FalTT and Querry in The Burnt-Out Case. The authors seem to have an educated interest in the religious dimension of psychological experience. This is espe cially clear in the discussion of Graham Greene's A Burnt-Out Case, which suggests that this is one of the finest modern novels offering a detailed psychological analysis of the close relationship between loss of belief and existential neurosis. [LAB] OLD AND MIDDLE ENGLISH 2808 Cozart, William R. "Chaucer's Knight's Tale: A Philosophical Re-Appraisal of a Medieval Romance," Univ. of California Studies in Comp. Lit., No. 1 (1968), 25-34. The KnightTT Tale's ending is based on Ockham: The essential tie 42</page><page sequence="5">between the justice of God and the arbi trariness of human destiny cannot be demonstrated but rests instead on faith." [LB] 2809 Earl, James W. "The Shape of Old Testament History in the Towneley Plays," Studies in Philology, 69 (October, 1972), 434-452. Selection of the OT episodes and their unhistorical sequence is dependent upon the Septuagesima liturgy (OT history looking forward to baptism—prefigured by the crossing of the Red Sea—as its climax, and providing the transition to the redemptive history of the NT in the liturgy of Easter), in which the events are typo logical, so that the Red Sea and Lazarus episodes are parallel, and the only two displaced to the end of the major divisions of history. [BC] 2810 Farrell, Robert T. "A Reading of OE Exodus," Rev. Eng. Studies, 20 (1969), 401-417. Dealing with figures which seem incongruous with the central epic theme: "A survey of the iconographical tradition of the theme of the help of God in early Christian art and liturgy shows that the figures of Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Israel in Egypt were often linked together . . . . OE Exodus is a poem which stresses obedience to the law of God and the faithful observance of the Covenant, as much as it is an account of a spirited epic adventure of the Jews under Moses." [LB] 2811 Marshall, Linda E. '"Sacral Parody' in the Secunda Pastorum," Speculum, 47 (October 1972). The links between the "positive" and "negative" typologies of Christ and Antichrist can be traced 43</page><page sequence="6">throughout the play, reinforcing the commonplace that separated plays must be seen in terms of the entire cycle which embraces a vision of first and last things unfolding like the apocalyptic dream of St. John), and offering a multitude of images which could help in the staging of the plays. [BC] RENAISSANCE 2812 Ayers, Philip J. "Degrees of Heresy: Justified Revenge and Elizabethan Narratives," Studies in Philology, 69 (October 1972), 461-474. The argu ment that we must keep in mind the Elizabethan "unanimous condemnation of extra-legal retributive justice. . . if we are to respond to the plays as a contemporary audience would have" is not supported by an analysis of a number of revenge stories: "they show that Elizabethans were reading of revenges whose actions were condoned by the authors and of whom the reader was often encour aged to approve." It seems fair to conclude that approval of, not only sympathy for, the actions of Hieronimo or Hamlet, at least within the confines of the theatre, was not impossible for an Elizabethan audience. [BC] 2813 Blythe, Joan Heiges. "Spenser and the Seven Deadly Sins: Book I, Cantos IV and V," JELH, 39(Sept., 1972), 342-352. Redcross1 confrontation of the Deadly Sins, rather than part of his education as a Christian, is evidence of his condi tion of "unconscious despair of pride and unacknowledgement of sin," as defined both by medieval and Renaissance theologians 44</page><page sequence="7">and by Kierkegaard. Redcross remains proudly aloof during the parade of Sins, concerned only with his worldly enter prises and fortunes. The Cave of Night episode serves as analogue to Redcross' "soul unilluminated by true Christian understanding and dominated by despair." [JSR] 2814 Toor, David. "Shakespeare's KING RICHARD II, IV, i, 237-242," Explicator, 31:3 ^November 1972), No. 23. Richard's anaolgies of himself with Christ and Bolingbroke with Pilate are emphasized by a pun on "Pilate — pilot." Boling broke "delivers" Richard "to his sore cross" just as a pilot delivers his ship to port (see Matthew 27:24). [LB] SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 2815 Bercovitch, Sacvan, ed. Typology and Earl.y American Literature. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1972. A selection of essays from the journal Early American Literature along with two original essays and a considerable annotated bibliography on typology, this volume argues for the comprehensive importance of Biblical typology as a shaping feature of early American thought and letters. Two essays by Thomas M. Davis and Stephen Manning outline the medieval and Reformation background of Biblical typology; three essays by Jesper Rosenmeier, Richard Reinitz, and Mason Lowance, Jr. deal with seventeenth century New England typology; three essays (Robert Reiter, Karl Keller, Ursula Brumm) consider typology in the work of Edward Taylor; and a final essay 45</page><page sequence="8">by Professor Lowance extends this survey into the eighteenth century and the work of Jonathan Edwards. The bibliography is selettive but long, and deals with many aspects of the study of typology in addition to its importance in early American letters. [LB] 2816 Blackburn, Thomas H. '"Uncloister'd Virtue1: Adam and Eve in Milton's Paradise," Milton Studies, 3 (1971), 119-139. Adam and Eve are free to choose sin and thus accept responsibility, even though they have had no "uncloister'd" contact with good and evil. [LB] 2817 Buchwald, Emilie. "The Earthly Paradise and the Ideal Landscape: Studies in a Changing Tradition, Through 1750," DA, 32 (Sept. 1971), 1465-66-A (U. of Minn.). In the Middle Ages, the classical stylized landscape was mingled with the biblical Garden of Eden, while in the Renaissance, authors like Tasso and Spenser implicitly compared the Christian earthly Paradise (a reminder of duty to God) with the hedonistic classical pleasure garden. In 17th century love poetry the beloved, or love itself, is hailed as the earthly paradise; and religious love poetry uses erotic imagery to convince the reader that the only true earthly paradise is in union with God. 2818 Burke, Delia Anne. "The 'I - Thou' Relationship in George Herbert's The Temple," DA 32 (July 1971), 381-A (Case Western Reserve). Problems inherent in the genre of devotional poetry prevented religious lyrists from Southwell through Donne from achieving 46</page><page sequence="9">the sense of personal communion which Herbert achieved. The narrative dimension of The Temple arises from the poet's pervasive regard for the personalities of his "I" at prayer and the "Thou" of God. Gradually the "I" comes to recognize and to respect God's point of view, "the one point of view ultimately emerging from the work as a whole." 2819 Chamberlin, John Stephen. "Increase and Multiply: The Medieval Arts of Discourse and the Development of Scriptural Figures in Donne's Sermons," DA 32 (July 1971), 382-A (U. of Toronto). In dealing with the particular elements of Scriptural language, Donne adapted much from the assumptions and practice of Patristic and Medieval preaching. "His principal means of enlarging upon the words of the text is to adduce other places in Scripture which serve to elaborate what a particular expression signifies. The several signi fications are enwrapped upon each other into a packet which can then be enfolded in any other Scriptural context in which that expression occurs." The influence of Augustine and Bonaventure is demonstrated. [VRM] 2820 Cohen, Kitty. "Milton's God in Council and War," Milton Studies 3 (1971), 159 185. Milton's anthropomorphic picture of God derives from Old Testament sources; it is therefore probable that Milton justified his portrayal of God as God's own version of Himself. [LB] 47</page><page sequence="10">Finnigan, David Francis. "Dark Designs: The Presentation of Evil in Paradise Lost," DA, 32 (July 1971), 397-A (U. of Oregon]? Milton stresses the importance of perspec tive in viewing good and evil, inextricably mixed in the postlapsarian world. "Evil, from the point of view of innocence, may appear good, just as good, from the point of view of evil, may appear terrible. Thus it is inaccurate to say that evil is either ugly or attractive; it is both, depending upon the reader's perspective, the form and role it assumes, and the imagery employed to describe it. It is presented through paradoxical imagery and action; the antitheses, the irony, the ambivalence, and the blurred imagery all stress the paradoxical mode of its pre sentation." Thus, those readers who find Satan attractive have not totally misread the poem. [VRM] Forrester, Kent Allen. "Supernaturalism in Restoration Drama," DA, 32 (Sept. 1971), 1469-A (U. of UtahT. The clash between the rationalistic Restoration climate of opinion and deep-rooted beliefs in the non-Christian supernatural resulted in plays that seem flawed both in concept and execution. Among the plays discussed are Restoration adaptations of Shakespeare, such as William Davenant's Macbeth; Restoration burlesques which satirize the supernatural such as William Mountford's Doctor Faustus; comedies which contain supernatural effects, such as Thomas Oevon's The Devil of a Wife; and tragedies contain ing the malevolent supernatural, such as Thomas Shadwell's The Libertine or Nahum Tates' Brutus of Alba. [VRM] 48</page><page sequence="11">2823 Friedman, Donald M. "Lycidas: The Swain's Paideia," Milton Studies, 3 (1971), 3-35. The poem's persona attempts to avoid direct knowledge of death by using artifical fictions, but is finally driven to "see a relationship to divinity that gives value to the poetic techniques and fictions" he had used for escape. [LB] 2824 Gnerro, Marco Lorenzo. "The Influence of Classical and Cinquecento Style Theory on British Invocatory Structure Through Milton," DA, 32 (Sept. 1971), 1471-A (Catholic U.). In Paradise Regained, the Muse is clearly the Spirit, but in Paradise Lost, although the Spirit (Holy Ghost) is the principal patron, the Muse Urania is the diffused patroness and the Holy Light is identified with the Logos—Wisdom. Urania preserves aspects of Aphrodite, Minerva, and Calliope as well as the predestined New Eve. The narrator of PL is Vergilian, with a majestic opening invocation and private, self-scrutinizing (meditative) internal invocations. 2825 Goldberg, Jonathan Saul. "Not Unto Death: The Devotions of John Donne," DA 32 (July 1971T 387-A (Columbia). The Devotions is "a Christian metaphor in which genre and style combine to describe a physical situation (autobiographical experience) transformed by a typological world-view into a spiritual event (devotional exper ience) with ramifications both Biblical and universal. Donne explicitly places himself in the context of Christian history and . . . invites the reader to recreate this experience by remaking himself in imitation of Christ." Direct formal influence of Ignatian meditation or the 49</page><page sequence="12">ars moriendi is rejected; rather, the traditional treatment of sickness in contemporary prayer books and the techniques of early autobiography are stressed. [VRM] 2826. Guilford, Charles Franklin. "Henry Vaughan and the Metaphysical Tradition," DA, 32 (Jan. 1972), 4000-A (Northern Illinois). Vaughan's poetry, far from derivative and uneven, is notably original and sustained in its vision of the world. His use of quest imagery and Hermetic symbols demonstrates a continuing quest for unity; and though he borrowed from Herbert, he also went beyond Herbert in struggling for union with God in this life. Because Vaughan is more conscious than Traherne of God's transcend ence, he places more emphasis on alienation and death than does Traherne; redemption for Vaughan is through an ego-death and rebirth in Christ, whereas for Traherne it is an Act of Understanding (fulfilment rather than denial of the self). [VRM] 2827 Hatlen, Burton Norval. "The Snake in the Garden: Milton's Comus as Pastoral," DA, 32 (Jan. 1972), 4001-2 A (U. of Cal., Davis). Christian humanists read Comus as positive toward nature; Platonists read it as re pudiating the body and the material world 1n general. But ambivalence toward nature is characteristic of Renaissance pastoral literature, and Comus shares that ambiva lence. Nature is good, but fallen; man should both purify himself by a return to nature, and also affirm his status as God's child by rising above nature. In the opening scenes of Comus Milton undercuts the positive pastoral images through ironies of juxtaposition and situation, and empha sizes the fallen condition of nature. But 50</page><page sequence="13">later the ironies disappear, and nature is carried toward the culminating vision of the gardens of Hesperus. [VRM] 2828 Jacobus, Lee A. "Self-Knowledge in Paradise Lost; Conscience and Contemplation," Milton Studies, 3 (1971), 103-119. The characters' "faltering efforts to know [themselves] are highly analogous to man's quest for unity with God." [LB] 2829 Morkan, Joel. "Wrath and Laughter: Milton's Ideas on Satire," Studies in Philology, 69 (October 1972), 475-495. Milton's apologiae and his critical description of satire are a personal de fense and a description of the way Milton handled satire in his prose and poetry. He subordinated satire to religious reform ation: he avoided base matter and low style; he struck out at what he considered the greatest criminals of the age (bishops) or of the ages (Satan). [BC] 2830 Lewis, Stephen C. "Edward Taylor as A Covenant Theologian," DA, 32 (Jan. 1972), 3956-A (N.Y.U.). Taylor7^ work is best illuminated not by metaphysical studies, nor by meditative practices, but by aware ness of Covenant Theology. This modified Calvinism formulated by Perkins, Preston, and Ames in England and John Cotton and others in New England, divided human history between the Covenant of Works (violated by Adam) and the Covenant of Grace. Taylor's poem "God's Determinations Concerning His Elect" contains the Covenant concept of salvation, requiring complete faith in Christ and abhorrence of moral corruption. "Huswifery," "He is a New Creature," and other poems show the process 51</page><page sequence="14">of sanctification by which the redeemed man learns to value his spirituality. His Meditations expresses the doubts and tensions of a Puritan saint who knows that conversion is gradual and that his sancti fication is imperfect. [VRM] 2831 Musacchio, George Louis. "Fallible Perfection: The Motivation of the Fall," DA, 32 (Nov. 1971), 2649-50-A. The Reformation concept of justitia original is, the original righteousness of Adam and Eve, clarifies Milton's handling of the Fall. Reformation theologians considered Adam and Eve perfect but fallible, with physical, mental, individual limitations and with the need to maintain temperance. Utilizing these limitations Milton created characters who were sufficient to stand but free to fall, perfect but mutable. [VRM] 2832 Parfitt, George A. E. "Donne, Herbert, and the Matter of Schools," Essays in Criticism, 22:4 (October 1972), 381-395. Herbert should not be assigned to a "school of Donne," because of basic contrasts in the poets' religious poetry: Donne is more personal, private, and formally experi mental—Herbert more conventional, public, and writing with a notion of the church as a community of believers as well as an individual worshipper. [LB] 2833 Sheehan, John Clement. "Form and Tradition in English Epithalamion, 1595-1641," DA» 32 (Jan. 1972), 3964-A (U. of Mich.). Spenser Christianized the epithalamion by using biblical imagery and a Protestant view of marriage. Donne followed suit in "The Lincoln's Inn Epithalamion" and other poems; Jonson's epithalamia were more 52</page><page sequence="15">didactic. Jonson was the first to use the epithai amion in a wedding masque, and was followed by Campion, Beaumont, Daniel, and Chapman. Brathwaite and Brome satirized various English epithalamia, and Suckling in "A Ballad Upon a Wedding" abandoned his fellow Cavalier epithalamists by setting a model for the crude satirical epithalamia of the Restoration. 2834 Sherwood, Terry G. "Reason in Donne's Sermons," ELH, 39 (Sept., 1972), 353-375. The role of reason in Donne's sermons is greater than critics admit who argue that his growing Augustinian spirituality was accompanied by Anti-Thomistic Renaissance skepticism. Reason is central to Donne's view of Scripture, and his view of Christian belief. The sermons abound with "rational elements," his use of syllogistic logic a major example. The 1626 Easter sermon and the Second Prebend sermon demonstrate that "spiritual experience is not free from the restrictions of rational understanding." [JSR] 2835 Startzman, Louis Eugene. "Images of Evil in the Formal Verse Satire of Joseph Hall, John Marston, John Donne, and Alexander Pope," DA, 32 (July 1971), 402-A (Ohio U.). The satirist's images are carriers of his understanding of human nature. Hall creates a comic picture of a wholly perverse age; Marston's "Satyr VII" shows man as a creature who has lost his Rational soul because of Appetite, and does so in images of clothes, filth, bestiality, and disease. Donne satirizes various states of evil within a religious context, whereas Pope's imitation of Donne's Satyre IV shows a conflict of wise worldlings vs. foolish 53</page><page sequence="16">worldlings as opposed to Donne's original conflict of Christian satirist vs. the world. Thus the religious and metaphysical perspective of Renaissance satire shifts to a social and ethical perspective. [VRM] 2836 Steadman, John M. "Herbert's Platonic Lapidary: A Note on 'The Foil,"' Sev. Cen. News, 30 (Fall, Winter, 1972), 59-62. This brief epigram subtly "combines Platonic and Christian allusions" to present the theme of the beauty of virtue. The foil conceit is definitive of the epistemological pro blem the poem treats, analogically and paradoxically suggesting that in the works of the Creator lie images which illustrate to the intellect "the essential attractive ness or repulsiveness of good and evil." [JSR] 2837 Stollman, Samuel S. "Milton's Samson and the Jewish Tradition," Milton Studies, 3 (1971), 185-201. In line with a more liberal Christian interpretation, Milton treats Samson in terms of moral and political liberty instead of the stricter Rabbinic tradition identifying Samson's sin as marrying a Gentile. [LB] 2838 Tillman, James Shannon. "Mythmaking in the Philosophical Proposals of Francis Bacon," DA, 32 (Sept. 1971), 14870A (U. of Rochester). Bacon characterizes his work as the recreation of Adam's perfect language of nature; as the inauguration and restoration of Adam's enlightened vision and harmony between man, nature, and God; and as a cultivation of human experience both of nature and of human affairs. These images are both imaginative arguments and myths, justifying Bacon's work to himself 54</page><page sequence="17">and to others. Although he divides philos ophy from relgion, his imaginative imagery goes a long way toward reunifying those division. Bacon was an almost mystical believer in himself as the divinely appointed redeemer of philosophic man. [VRM] 2839 Wilding, Michael. "Milton's Paradise Lost," Sydney Studies in Lit. (1969), 128. Wilding surveys the poenTs values, dealing with Satan's heroism/corruption, with Milton's difficulty in portraying God, and with the poem's end "with patience to the will of God." [LB] 2840 Yots, Algirt Michael. "Wycherley's Ironic Vision," DA, 32 (Nov. 1971), 2658-59-A (U. of Arizona). The moral ambiguity and almost schizoid ambivalence which have disturbed critics of Wycherley are manifes tations of Wycherley's ironic vision—a characteristically dual response to the ambiguous and paradoxical nature of human experience. To achieve a multiple ironic perspective, Wycherly employs a type of parody (e.g., Manley as a parody of the Herculean protagonists of Restoration heroic drama), the fiction of the satirist satirized, and a self-conscious emphasis on the play as play. His favorite ironic theme was self deception; and in his most mature plays, The Country Wife and The Plain Dealer, there is an ironic sense of coexisting worlds which each make such strong demands that neither can be thought of as Wycherley's ideal.

Pekuah's faith in ultimate rescue (salva tion), her resignation to events she cannot control, and her insight into spiritual realities hidden from Rasselas make her an exemplum of Johnson's Christian morality. The theme of imprisonment corresponds to the image as used by St. Paul in Romans and Ephesians. [LB] 2842 Odell, Daniel W. "Young's Night Thoughts as an Answer to Pope's Essay on Man," Studies in Eng. Lit., 12 (Summer, 1972), 481-501. Young addresses the rational philosophy of Essay on Man, opposing particularly Pope's attacks on anthropo centrists. Young deals with the problem of evil in the light of Redemption rather than in terms of the principle of plenitude, as does Pope; according to Young, man's position on the chain of being is not fixed, but because of the promise of immortality he is "capable of endless material, intel lectual, and spiritual progress." [JSR] 2843 Tatham, Campbell. "Benjamin Franklin, Cotton Mather, and the Outward State," E. Amer. Lit., 6:3 (Winter 1971-72), 223-33.

"Singer and Hawthorne: A Prevalence of Satan," Southern Rev., 8 (Spring 1972), 359-370.

Huck's final move to the Indian territory may be compared to Abraham's pilgrimage to Mount Mori ah as recounted by Kierkegaard in that it indicates Huck's resignation to God's conmand and his renunciation of conventional ethics." But Huck's move is optimistic and joyful rather than in "fear and trembling." [LB] TWENTIETH CENTURY 2847 Adams, George R. '"My Christ' in Dutchman," CLAJ, XV (Sept. 1971), 54-58. A key to understanding the myth underlying Amiri Baraka's (LeRoi Jones') play is the cry of Lula to Clay, 'My Christ.' Adams sees Clay as both the Old Adam, dead in sin and ejected from Paradise, and the New Adam through whose sacrifice and second coming 57</page><page sequence="20">the world is at first redeemed and later recreated as the avenging Judge brings a new h=aven and earth.
