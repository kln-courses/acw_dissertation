<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theoretical Biology. By J. von Uexkull. Translated by D. L. Mackinnon, D.Sc. (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trlibner and Co., Ltd. 1926. Pp. xvi + 362. Price 18s.) It is not easy to give within reasonable limits a critical account of this important book. Partly because of its ambitious scope?that of re-setting biological formulations in a new synthesis, and partly because there is an abundant use of new terms, some of which are far from being self-explanatory. Thirdly, the author's arguments are so radically important that they cannot be justly dealt with in brief compass. " In Nature everything is certain ; in Science everything is problematical." Yet not so problematical, it may be urged, that we cannot sometimes predict from even biological Science what will happen in Animate Nature. Yet von Uexkull is no doubt right that " science can fulfil its purpose only if it be built up like a scaffolding against the wall of a house," which will enable the workman to get a firm foothold and to pass to any point without losing a general view of the whoje. The scaffolding does not pertain to Nature, 4*3</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES but is always something extraneous. And now a new biological scaffolding is needed, for the physico-chemical scaffolding (the author finds no other) has broken down. It has refused to recognize the biological doctrine that " a conformity with plan " is the basis of life. Here we have one of the author's peculiar phrases, and it does not strike one as very happy. By "conformity with plan" is meant what others have called, not more fortu- nately, " organic purposiveness." It implies the operation of super- mechanical factors. Organism transcends mechanism. The author is a Kantian biologist. " All reality is subjective appearance. This must constitute the great, fundamental admission even of biology. It is utterly vain to go seeking through the world for causes that are inde? pendent of the subject; we always come up against objects, which owe their construction to the subject. . . . The task of biology consists in expanding in two directions the results of Kant's investigations: (i) by considering the part played by our body, and especially by our sense-organs and central nervous system, and (2) by studying the relations of other subjects (animals) to objects." The active human subject, expressing its " internal conformity with plan," receives impressions consisting of " sense- qualities " and arranges these into unities or objects, according to the forms already prepared in the mind. Thus the first part of Theoretical Biology is devoted to the forms prescribed by our space and time intuitions. According to the biologist, there are as many worlds as there are subjects, and all are worlds of appearance, which are intelligible only in connection with the subjects. " The subjective world consists (1) of places, the number of which is finite; (2) of movements, the extent of which is limited ; (3) of moments, in a series that has both a beginning and an end; and (4) of content- qualities, which are also fixed in number, and have laws which are also laws of Nature." Thus the third chapter of the book is devoted to the content- qualities, as distinguished from the ' order-qualities.* But Kant's doctrine is expanded, for von Uexkiill maintains that for all kinds of qualities there are forms which are present in our mind entirely a priori and precedent to all experience, such as ' scale ' in relation to sounds. " Not only are there fixed forms for each quality-material, but the number of individual qualities within their form is also absolute, and precedent to all experience." The biological elements are these qualities, each of which leaves behind it in our consciousness a sign?the " mark-sign." This is another of von UexkiilFs common terms. In English, at any rate, it seems very very bad. The fourth chapter is concerned with the living organism, and helps the biological reader towards an understanding of von Uexkull's position. Perhaps the gist of it is expresed in the following sentences. " In addition to mechanical, a living being also possesses super-mechanical capacities, giving it a character which would still be quite unlike that of a machine, even if the machine were constructed with the same perfection as are organs, and even if their counter-actions were real actions, i.e. were not referable to the action of a human being. The super-mechanical powers of all organisms consist in this, that they include the activities exercised on machines by human beings. They make the machine of their own body themselves, they run it themselves, and they undertake all its repairs. All three of these super-mechanical powers?the construction, the running of the machine, and its repair?appear to be bound up with the existence of protoplasm which machines do not possess." But in the protoplasm a distinction must be drawn between the framework or apparatus and the pure protoplasm, the seat of " impulse-sequences "?formative, controlling, and regulative?which express the characteristic conformity with plan. This 414</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS does not seem very different from the familiar statement of many biologists that the essence of life is resident in a characteristic idioplasm. The organism is so far like a machine, but the man in the machine is the unen- slaved protoplasm. The " impulse-sequence," as the secret of life is called, controls the activity of protoplasm ; and " thus shows itself to be an independent natural force, producing organs with differentiated framework, and then causing them to disappear again. Once the framework is there, the activity can proceed automatically within its limits. But since the framework is con? structed by the impulse sequence in conformity with plan, its action in the outer world is both in accordance with plan and also automatic. The question concerning the conformity with plan is the business of biology ; the question concerning the mechanical running belongs to physiology." If we understand this aright, it is a psycho-biological theory of life ; " there is a non-material order which first gives to matter its framework?a rule of life. . . . It is like a melody, which controls the sequence of sound and the rhythm in accordance with law, but becomes apparent only as it becomes operative, and then takes on the tone-colour which the properties of the particular instruments impose on it." We cannot help wondering if this is more than verbal elucidation. In this chapter, and in others, an unnecessary difficulty seems to be raised by the use of diffieult terms, which perplex the reader gratuitously. Thus the word " counter-actions " is applied to the work of implements which help or refine our own operations. But this is not what the word counter-action suggests! And again, the lay-reader will not be helped by the fact that the word " evolution " is used in the fourth chapter in three senses: (i) for the old non-epigenetic conception of development (" evolutio "); (2) for the phyletic racial process in the course of which new types (both retrogressive and progressive) have arisen; and (3) for the alleged advance- ment or progressive perfecting of organisms, as when the author says that all creatures are " equally perfect," and thus, " in this respect, there is no such thing as evolution." The author displays an anti-Darwinian bias in hoping that the idea of " vestigial organs " will soon disappear into oblivion, and in asserting that a functional significance is always revealed when the sup? posed vestige is studied with sufficient care. It is obviously diffieult to prove that any dwindled structure is quite useless, but it would be easy to mention a score of vestigial structures for which, as such, not even the ingenuity of the speculative biologist, which is considerable, has been able to suggest any present-day functional significance. We refer to such instances as the baleen whale's two sets of teeth which never cut the gum; or to the minute remnant of a pelvis in some small snakes ; or to the rudimentary right oviduct in the majority of birds. It seems to us fantastic on the author's part to compare the hereditary persistence of vestigial structures to the continuance of an absolutely useless tumour from generation to generation. The fifth chapter is a study of the world of organisms in their inter- relations. Every animal, in virtue of its peculiar structure as subject, selects stimuli from the outer world and responds to these in a certain way. The effects of the responses again influence the stimuli, and thus arises a self-contained periodic cycle, which the author calls the " function-circle " ?another of his characteristic terms. These " function-circles " touch and intersect, but each animal has its own, with various equally important, though not equally obvious, sectors. Every animal may be said to have three worlds. There is the world- 415</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES as-sensed?the sum of the stimuli by aid of which it directs its movements. But the animal itself, by exercising such direction, creates an inner world for itself. The actions of the animal on its environment form the world of action. World of action and world-as-sensed together make a comprehensive whole?the surrounding-world. Thus would von Uexkiill improve on the conventional formulae, organism, function, and environment. Function-circles in their totality may be divided up into circle-groups. First there is the medium, which exerts no stimulus until the organism forsakes it; another function-circle is food ; another is enemy ; and a fourth is sex. " All these circles, however far they lie separated from one another in the world-as-sensed, intersect in the steering-apparatus of the inner world, and then separate from one another again in the world of action." This is an interesting personal phrasing of common biological teaching. As the author throws about such adjectives as " amateurish," we may suggest that he is prejudiced in accusing Darwinism of not recognizing that the struggle for existence is an essential part of the plan of life. Darwin makes quite clear his basal conviction that the struggle for existence in multitudinous forms, co-operative as well as competitive, metaphorical as well as literal, is the natural outcome of the native insurgence of organisms as it beats against environing difficulties and limitations. Useful, we think, is the distinction von Uexkiill draws between a physio? logical 'stimulus* and a biological ?' indication.' Perhaps we may say that an ' indication ' is the outcome of the organism's selective synthesis of impressions. Much the same has been said in other words by those biologists who have insisted that stimuli come to acquire at least a low grade of ' significance ' for the organism. Another good point is made, though with unpleasant German arrogance, that in experiments on the form-perception of animals, e.g. responses to various shapes brought within their range, a start should be made with objects that come within the natural function-circle. How fallacious it may be to test an ape with human implements ! The receptor nerves, forming separate " part-organs," enter into a nerve plexus, the " mark-organ," where stimuli are collected and " indications " built up?a super-mechanical faculty. The "mark-organ" communicates with the motor centre or " action-organ " whence, through effectors, changes are brought about in the " world of action." Such term as " mark-organ " seems to us to handicap the reader unnecessarily; it means the sensory nervous integrate to which receptors lead. But it includes not only the established nervous framework, there is also the unused active protoplasm in so far as that serves for the creation of indications. Similarly, the action- organ comprises not only the established framework, there is also the active protoplasm in so far as that serves for the creation of a definite movement- sequence or action. There is a mark-rule and an action-rule, but there is also a rule of inter-adjustment, " when the effectors, as they deal with the things of the external world, create a temporary adjustment." According to the inter-adjustments between, let us say, organism and enemy, the various indications are constructed into ' indicators.' " If in the enemy-circle a simple movement of flight follows on a certain indication, whether that be of a chemical, acoustic, or optical nature, the indicator is merely the bearer of the property that is employed as indication by the fleeing subject. If, on the other hand, effectors come into action that serve for defence, the indicator has a counter-framework which fits in with the framework of these." Thus the "counter-framework" in a starfish, from a sea-urchin's point of view, will include the long tube-feet against 416</page><page sequence="5">NEW BOOKS which the pedicellarise offer defence. In the counter-framework " a con? nection is established between the world of action and the world-as-sensed; and the surrounding-world emerges as a self-contained unity, enveloping the subject on all sides. The function-rule, consequently, relates not only to the framework of the subject that it governs, but also to the counter- framework of the animal serving the subject as enemy or as prey." We have required this preamble in order to make clear what the author desiguates " the basic principle of biology. In all surrounding-worlds whatsoever, the indication-bearing and the action-bearing properties of a function-rule are held together by the counter-framework of the same object." This fifth chapter ends with a useful distinction between " knowledge" and " wisdom " in animals, the former often as meagre as the latter is rich. So the eyed-hawk-moth scares the small birds that come near; but it saves itself not by attending its mind thereunto, but by obeying the rules in its mark-organ. Von Uexkiiirs view of development is very interesting. " As function is bound to definite material organs, so is genesis bound to certain material particles in the nucleus of the germ-cell, which are called genes. The newly discovered natural force works rhythmically according to a definite plan; therefore it must be called a rule. The agency through which it materialized itself we called the impulse, and we identified it with the impulse that precedes our own voluntary actions." The ' genes,' which Mendel discovered and Johannsen named, are probably ferments activated by impulses. " We must ascribe to the impulses a semi-immaterial character, which permits them, on the one hand, to initiate new causal series, but, on the other, places their becoming effective under the control of a rule that is in con? formity with plan. As an analogy, we may refer to the way sounds appear under compulsion of the melody." But the old difficulty recurs: how the semi-immaterial can be thought of as operating regularly on the sequences of the material. But it is not without argument that von Uexkiill leads us to his conclusion that the animal differs from the machine in having an autonomous function-regulator and an autonomous genesis-regulator. " Thus the subject, as the visible manifestation of the union of both these regulators, forms the most important natural factor in biology." We are disappointed to find in this brilliant chapter more of the prejudiced depre- ciation of Darwinism to which we have already referred. The Darwinian theory has its weaknesses, and it is quite fair banter to speak of Mendel's contemporaries " strolling confidently along the comfortable high-road of Darwinism" ; but it is disappointing to have a thinker of von Uexkull's calibre repeating the libel that after Darwin " life was without autonomy." We should not think that von Uexkiill had much to teach Darwin himself (we do not say his mechanistic epigoni) in regard to the organism as " the most important factor in biology." It is an extraordinary misrepresentation (to pass to the seventh chapter) to say that " Darwinism referred everything to matter and the structure of matter, and had no eyes for the living con? tinuity." Von Uexkiill has done his thesis a poor service in including in its statement a caricature of Darwinism, which he accuses of " unconscious juggling" between (a) individual " evolutio," a process of simplification, and (b) racial evolution, a process of complication. We should like to have chapter and verse for the basis of this accusation, for we have had, for our sins, to read enormous quantities of Darwinian literature, and our impression is that the alleged confusion is extremely rare, except among incompetent * popular ' anti-Darwinians. It does not matter, for more than a short time, what carelessnesses outsiders allow themselves, but it does matter much 2F 4*7</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES when a biologist of distinction, like von Uexkiill, permits himself to gibe at Darwinism as the embodiment of an impulse to get rid, by every possible means, of plan in Nature. It is disappointing, we say, to find a big man condescending to " slang the opposite counsel." " Darwinism," we are told, " the logical consistency of which leaves as much to be desired as does the accuracy of the facts on which it is based, is a religion rather than a science. The idea of evolution has thus become the sacred conviction of thousands, but has ceased to have anything to do with unprejudiced investi? gation of natural phenomena." If ever prejudice spoke it is here ! The author fancifully envisages the evolutionary advance of life as the introduction of new protoplasmic melodies, a sort of " further composition " according to plan, the ' impulses ' striking the strings or genes in new ways. The inner cause of the new melody is not known, but " to compare this inner urge with a psychic affect is merely a sign of the powers of our human imagination, which is unable to free itself from a highly deceptive tendency to anthropomorphose natural processes. If Lamarckism would but throw off its psychological wrappings, it would pass over straightway into the biological doctrine of conformity with plan." The nature of this conformity is the subject of the last chapter of this provoking but illuminating book. What is this conformity with plan ? It is not " purposefulness," for that is an anthropomorphism. It is not the orderliness of the chemico-physical processes that go on in organisms. It is a super-mechanical factor, which may be demonstrated in the behaviour of the genes in development. This factor is called " impulse." Wherever in the genesis of animals new framework is formed, there a super-mechani? cal factor is in action. Accordingly, all we have to do is to determine in what actions new framework originates; and we are then in a position to say, " At this point an impulse must come in." This leads von Uexkiill to a very suggestive analysis of the different forms of animal behaviour? the reflex action, the form action, the instinctive action, the plastic action, the action based on experience, and the controlled action. But the term " form-action " seems to us very unhappy, for what biologist, without the text, could tell what it means ? We feel this difficulty throughout the book, that the new terms are difficult and obscure. No doubt new ideas require new terms, but the terms should suggest the ideas ! It should be noted, however, that the author gives graphic formulae for the different kinds of behaviour; and these formulae are luciferous. What then is ' conformity with plan,' the ultimate natural law embracing all living things ? The author tells us: " Conformity with plan is the guiding law of the impulse-systems, by aid of which it organizes all living matter into subjects, and the coming and going of which it controls, as well as the relations of the subjects to one another and to non-living Nature." In short, it is the task of biology to discover the conformity with plan for organism after organism. What bothers the sceptical reader most is the nature of the "impulses" and how they act. They organize the physical and chemical factors in the protoplasm, but how this activation comes about is a riddle. It seems that they are not to be thought of as psychic, whatever that means. " The great question of the future will be whether it is possible to isolate the impulses, and force them to influence substances other than protoplasm. Already there are indications that an isolation of the impulses may be effected." This looks like coming back to bio-chemistry?to the despised Darwinism that is libelled by the author as pre-occupied with matter, which was, however, much more appreciative than the author of the bio-psychosis 418</page><page sequence="7">NEW BOOKS of animals. The impulses that build up our bodies elude our knowledge, and so we come back to Huxley's biological agnosticism. "And so it is self-evident that the whole impulse-system, which is at once the architect and the director of our body, is for ever hidden from our view. As Kant would say, we have to do with a transcendental subject (i.e. a subject lying beyond what we can experience) far wider in its embrace than the spirit, which embraces only the life of our ego. And so it is quite hopeless to try to explain through our psychical experiences the life of other living organisms." We agree with the author in not understanding the organism, but we remain, by inertia of imagination perhaps, inclined to express our agnosticism in other, especially Darwinian, terms. But no one can read the book without feeling the thrill of an unusually acute mind, emancipated from the biological conventionalities of our time. Even his obiter dicta are often of high value. And even the inconclusiveness of his conclusions is, we think, nearer to lasting lucidity than the automatic-machine mechanistic theory of life. We should rather be uncomfortable with von Uexkiill than complacent with the easy-going mechanists?though most of those we have known have been much the reverse of either easy-going or complacent. We wish to congratulate Dr. D. L. Mackinnon on her remarkably suc? cessful translation of what we know to have been very diffieult German. No one but an organically philosophical biologist could have achieved such a conspicuous success. Not that the book can ever be easy-reading, even in the most lucid translation. We may notice sympathetically a few slips, such as Boldamus, Fritsch, Herrik, Johannson, and, to mention another that we feel surer about, " Prologemena." There should have been an index to a book of this importance. T. Arthur Thomson. Changing Backgrounds in Religion and Ethics, a Metaphysical Meditation. By Herbert Wildon Carr, Hon.
