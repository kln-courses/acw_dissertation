INTRODUCTION: THE VIEW FROM THE SHORELINE In the diary he kept during his five-year voyage on H.M.S. Beagle, Charles Darwin described an episode that would later be made famous by his pub- lished Journal of Researches (1839). The diary's version, however, included more detail. It was mid-December of 1832, and the ship was running sev- eral miles off of the northeastern coast of Tierra del Fuego, at the extreme southern tip of South America. From here Darwin and the crew members got their first glimpse of the land's inhabitants: "Shortly by the aid of glasses we could see a group &amp; some scattered Indians evidently watching the ship with interest." The following afternoon, after passing around to the south side of the island, the Beagle entered the Bay of Good Success, so named by Captain James Cook when his ship the Endeavour dropped an- chor there over sixty years earlier. Here again, Darwin said, a party of Fuegians were watching us; they were perched on a wild peak overhanging the sea &amp; surrounded by wood. As we passed by they all sprang up &amp;: waving their cloaks of skins sent forth a loud sonorous shout. This they continued for a long time.

The experience impressed him deeply: "It was without exception the most curious &amp; interesting spectacle I ever beheld. I would not have believed how entire the difference between savage and civi- lized man is."2 This encounter between Victorian Englishmen and primitive tribesmen has attracted considerable commentary: historians have been interested es- pecially in its bearing on Darwin's views concerning racial differences.3 Far more important for present purposes, however, are the events that came beforehand, events Darwin barely mentioned when he edited his shipboard diary to produce the published Journal, later retitled Voyage of the Beagle. There the initial sighting of Tierra del Fuego is recounted only in brief, omitting the description of the wild people watching from the cliffs along the shore.4 Only in the diary do we see Darwin and his companions gazing out at those distant figures - even as the latter gazed back, with evident "interest," at the approaching ship. Surely this scene helped to inspire an illustration found in the final chapter of Darwin's Origin of Species (1859): When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a his- tory; when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each useful to the pos- sessor, nearly in the same way as when we look at any great 1 Charles Darwin, Charles Darwin's Beagle Diary, ed.

The early manuscripts refer to a ship "or other great work of art," using the latter term in its older sense, as in "artifice." Writing in 1909, Francis Darwin incorrectly suggested that his father, when he wrote the Origin, changed the analogy from art (as in fine art) to technology.

It had served, that is, up until he wrote the Origin itself, as part of the illustrative climax to the presentation of his evolution theory. Here we will examine this analogy, focusing on three overlapping as- pects. First, I will suggest that the ship image epitomized Darwin's response to the traditional British belief in theistic "design" - an idea set forth by Robert Boyle and John Ray in the seventeenth century, and later given clas- sic expression in William Paley's Natural Theology (1802). (Archdeacon Paley, 1743-1805, was an Anglican churchman and an apologist for Chris- tian theism.) The phenomena of nature, the argument ran, manifested de- sign, which is to say, intelligent purpose. Hence nature had to have a wise designer, on the analogy of a skilled inventor or master craftsman as the maker of a complex instrument. Although Darwin did not consider his evo- lution theory to be atheistic, he did see it as opposed to the notion of design, specifically to the idea that the Creator had pre-adapted each organic form to its particular conditions of existence. This outlook, he said, rendered nature's facts "wholly beyond . . . comprehension," which was the naive viewpoint of the savage. For to regard a living organism- or a modern sailing ship - as having been consciously designed suggested a failure to understand how it actually had come into being. Darwin's alternative was to regard organic forms each as having a "history": every complex feature was the "summing up of many contrivances." Or, as he said in his 1842 and 1844 manuscripts, "the summing up of a long history of contrivances." The 1844 version added that an organism should be regarded "as a produc- tion that has a history which we may search into."11 Accordingly, Darwin declared that living nature should be viewed in "nearly the same way" as one would look at "any great mechanical inven- tion as the summing up of the labour, the experience, the reason and even the blunders of numerous workmen." Despite the reference here to "any great mechanical invention," Darwin cited only one such device as an ex- ample: rather than invoke the steam-driven technology of that era, he pointed to the sailing ship, a particularly apt vessel for conveying his anti- design message. This aptness shows itself especially if we contrast Darwin's ship with William Paley's famous comparison between the human eye and a telescope. The telescope (said Paley) had been constructed according to 11 Darwin, Foundations, 39, 189, emphasis added. 444</page><page sequence="5">Alter ♦ Darwin's Vision of Natural Selection strict optical principles and for a specific purpose. Could any less be said of the eye, or of any other organ of extreme precision?12 Although Darwin did not set his own illustration directly in opposition to this analogy, I will argue that the sailing ship in effect functioned as an alternative to Paley's telescope. The second task of this essay will be to identify the sources that in- spired Darwin's ship image. Although his experience at Tierra del Fuego was foundational, the illustration was actually a compound of several parts. Superimposed on Darwin's personal memories were ships and savages of a wholly speculative nature, these encountered in texts Darwin read in the years following the voyage of the Beagle. Especially influential were David Hume's Dialogues concerning Natural Religion (1779) and Bernard Man- deville's Fable of the Bees (1714), the one a classic critique of design think- ing and the other a conjectural account of the origins of human civility.13 Yet while they thus treated different topics, these writings each contributed something essential to the formation of Darwin's analogy. Finally, by situating these texts among a related set of works that Dar- win read in this period, we can clarify our understanding of how, in Dar- win's thinking, natural selection displaced the idea of a designing deity.14 As historians have noted, Darwin actually retained much of the logic and rhetoric that characterized design theory.15 He especially retained Paley's question about the well-made adaptations by which living forms are fitted for survival: how to account for these apparent manifestations of design? It is true that Darwin came to regard adaptation as imperfectly attained: he said in an early notebook that it was "perfect [only] to the then existing 12 William Paley, Natural Theology (1802; New York: American Tract Society, n.d.), chs. 3, 5, and 6. 13 "Darwin's Reading Notebooks," in The Correspondence of Charles Darwin, eds.

Even so, Darwin did not simply replace Paley's supreme mechanical inventor with an equally mechanistic view of natural selection. Rather, as I will suggest in the most speculative phase of my argument, Darwin viewed the selection process in terms of a particular kind of narrative, the kind found in eighteenth-century philosophical or "conjectural" history. That genre included works by Continental figures such as Montesquieu and Rousseau, yet it was developed most extensively by Scottish Enlightenment thinkers.17 Exposure to writings by the latter group would have taught Dar- win that blind-yet-cumulative historical experience could eventuate in spontaneous order. And, extrapolating from society to nature, he would have seen that such a process could substitute quite effectively for the calcu- lated workmanship of a Designer. The result, I argue, was more than just a vivid illustration appearing in the final chapter of the Origin of Species. For Darwin drew on the Scottish historical outlook not only to represent his response to British natural theology but also to conceptualize that response in the first place. II. DARWIN'S SHIP VERSUS PALEY'S TELESCOPE First we examine Darwin's ship analogy in relation to his published re- marks about design. The illustration and its immediate context actually made no direct reference to the design thesis. Rather, Darwin merely said that the study of natural history would become "far more interesting" as his evolution theory gained acceptance; he also made predictions as to how his theory would link together the various subfields of the life sciences. From this point, however, it was but a short step to Darwin's critique of design thinking. He made the connection explicit at the beginning of his book Fertilization of Orchids (1862), which was his first major publication following the Origin: "This treatise affords me ... an opportunity of at- tempting to show that the study of organic beings may be as interesting to 16 Darwin, Origin of Species, 201-2; Charles Darwin's Notebooks, 1836-1844, eds.

Yet the loss of that agenda would be more than made up for if disparate phenomena could be brought under a single unifying theory - for Darwin, the essence of what made an inquiry "inter- esting." Darwin also argued throughout his writings that facts could thus be explained that otherwise would remain isolated, hence "inexplicable."19 As he said at the end of his Descent of Man (1871), "He who is not content to look, like a savage, at the phenomena of nature as disconnected, cannot any longer believe that man is the work of a separate act of creation."20 Darwin confronted the design thesis more directly in chapter six of the Origin, in a section on "organs of extreme perfection." Here he alluded to the rhetorical centerpiece of William Paley's Natural Theology: It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope. We know that this instrument has been perfected by the long- continued efforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous proc- ess. But may not this inference be presumptuous? Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man? If we must compare the eye to an optical instrument, we ought in imagination to take a thick layer of transparent tissue, with a nerve sensitive to light beneath, and then suppose every part of the layer to be continually changing slowly in density. . . . Let this process go on for millions on millions of years [etc.].21 We should be clear as to why Darwin rejected the eye-telescope analogy. It was not because it invoked human endeavor per se; rather, the problem was its assumption that the Creator works "by intellectual powers like those of man," a critique (as we will see) taken straight from Hume's Dialogues concerning Natural Religion. It is true that Darwin referred to "long- 18 Charles Darwin, The Various Contrivances by which Orchids are Fertilized by Insects, 2, quoted in Campbell, "Darwin's Affective Decline," 169. 19 For Darwin's use of the word "inexplicable" in this way, see, for example, Origin of Species, 59, 97, 188,243. 20 Charles Darwin, Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, Intro, by J.

Yet he also (rightly construing Paley) characterized that in- strument as the work of "the highest human intellects," made by those who could envisage what they wanted and had a fair idea of how to go about producing it. By contrast, nature worked opportunistically. It made use of whatever was available, in terms of inherited structures and instincts, to bring about a gradual succession of relatively improved adaptations. This, of course, was the kind of process represented by Darwin's ship, which was the analogical antithesis of Paley's telescope. For the ship embodied a particular kind of technology: it had evolved from much simpler anteced- ents (before there were ships there were boats) and had undergone a long series of ad hoc improvements, involving the piecemeal discovery of what did and did not work. Further comment on the design argument appeared in the Origin's con- cluding chapter. Here Darwin spoke bluntly: "It is so easy to hide our igno- rance under such expressions as the 'plan of creation,' 'utility of design,' etc., and to think that we give an explanation when we only restate a fact."22 He went on to accuse design thinkers of adopting a double stan- dard: "Although [such] naturalists very properly demand a full explanation of every difficulty from those who believe in the mutability of species, on their own side they ignore the whole subject of the first appearance of spe- cies in what they consider reverent silence."23 That is, they tolerated in themselves an even greater inability to explain phenomena than that for which they would fault a transmutationist. Indeed, Darwin suggested, spe- cial creationists positively valued that inability. For, having pointed to evi- dence of purposeful adaptation in nature, it was essential for them to insist that these patterns could not be explained apart from invoking supernatural design. In this sense, creationists placed a premium on their own igno- rance.24 Darwin affirmed that natural selection acted for a "purpose," thereby retaining the language of design. Yet he jettisoned the traditional teleology that presupposed a grand plan, and taught instead that selection served the good only of individual organisms.25 Moreover, in describing complex 22 Darwin, Origin of Species, 481-82; also: Darwin, Foundations , 161.

Lloyd (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1992), 448</page><page sequence="9">Alter ♦ Darwin's Vision of Natural Selection organs and instincts as a "summing up" of their constituent parts, Darwin implied that these structures were formed by nothing greater than those parts. He illustrated this revised notion of teleology in Fertilization of Or- chids, in a passage that was almost an extension of the Origin's ship analogy: Although an organ may not have been originally formed for some special purpose, if it now serves for this end we are justified in saying that it is specially contrived for it. On the same principle, if a man were to make a machine for some special purpose, but were to use old wheels, springs, and pulleys, only slightly altered, the whole machine, with all its parts, might be said to be specially contrived for its present purpose. Thus throughout nature almost every part of each living being has probably served, in a slightly modified condition, for diverse purposes, and has acted in the liv- ing machinery of many ancient and distinct specific forms.26 In short, there was no preordained fit between an organic form and its function. Rather, the available materials were constantly redeployed. The unnamed machine in this illustration used "old wheels, springs, and pul- leys," these "only slightly altered" to meet new demands. III. LAW VERSUS DESIGN IN THE NOTEBOOK YEARS We turn now to the years immediately following the Beagle voyage, to see how this period set the stage for Darwin's ship analogy. The voyage ended in October of 1836, and, within months of that event, Darwin had em- braced the idea of species evolution; he had also decided to directly chal- lenge the Paleyan design outlook. A likely inspiration for this latter project was an open letter written earlier that year by the astronomer John Her- schel to the geologist Charles Lyell - two of Darwin's intellectual heroes. Herschel admired Lyell's Principles of Geology (1830, 1833), yet he called for something more than the vague treatment of the transmutation question given in that work. Although Lyell properly rejected Jean-Baptiste Lamar- 324-33; Kohn, "Darwin's Ambiguity," 233. The individual-utility view also was set forth by Hume in his Dialogues concerning Natural Religion: Phillip R. Sloan, "The Question of Natural Purpose," in Evolution and Creation, ed.

Herschel in- sisted that the appearance of new species be explained by "intermediate causes," that is, by a "natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process." For God, he said, must have operated by natural law in all spheres, not just in Newton's physical universe.27 In light of Hershel's challenge, it is significant that Darwin soon was reading his grandfather Erasmus Darwin's massive treatise Zoonomia (1794-96), on the "laws of animate life."28 Among its many topics, this work included an argument in favor of organic evolution. Accordingly, as he began his own evolutionary speculations in March of 1837, Charles Darwin did so with an emphasis on biological law. This he signaled by penning the title "Zoonomia" on the first of the series of theoretical note- books he would keep over the next two years. Erasmus Darwin's treatise is important to us also for a further reason, its gloss of a famous critique of theistic design theory: The late Mr. David Hume, in his posthumous works, places the powers of generation much above those of our boasted reason; and adds, that reason can only make a machine, as a clock or a ship. . . . [He] concludes that the world itself might have been generated, rather than created; that is, it might have been gradu- ally produced from very small beginnings, increasing by the activ- ity of its inherent principles, rather than by a sudden evolution of the whole by Almighty fiat.29 For the most part this was an accurate summary of the argument in Hume's Dialogues, and it was a message that Charles Darwin heeded: when he re- read his grandfather's book two years later, he jotted next to the above 27Kohn, "Darwin's Ambiguity," 222-23.

Cannon, "The Impact of Uniformitarianism: Two Letters from John Hershel to Charles Lyell, 1836- 1837," Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 105 (1961): 301-14, on p. 305.

Later, after reading Hume's actual work, Charles Darwin would re- flect its argument more faithfully, showing that ship-construction fell into a special category. Meanwhile, the younger Darwin had gained a fair idea of Hume's cri- tique of the design idea. This, combined with Herschel's agenda, produced a double-edged thesis that would permeate his writings from the notebook period onward. One aspect was the poverty of design thinking and the other was the need for "secondary laws" of nature applicable to the organic realm.31 As the historian David Kohn has argued, Darwin originally em- braced these ideas so as to promote the reform, not the destruction, of British natural theology.32 Darwin often railed in his notebooks against the idea ("from cramped imagination") that God had drawn up a blueprint for each separate species, including a "long succession of vile Molluscous animals. . . . How beneath the dignity of him who is supposed to have said let there be light and there was light." Indeed, "how far grander" it would have been for God to have created by means of "laws he established in all organic nature."33 In late September of 1838, Darwin read Thomas R. Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population (1798; 1826 edition), which pointed toward what he believed to be just such a law. As population growth outstripped the means of subsistence, only the best-suited individuals would survive and propagate, resulting (Darwin reasoned) in the eventual modification of the species in question. Darwin developed this idea over the next several months and thus got his "theory by which to work," what he eventually would call natural selection.34 During this period, he elaborated what he 30 Sloan, 'The Question of Natural Purpose," 129-30, 149 n.51. 31 See John Hedley Brooke, Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives (Cam- bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), 222; Cornell, "God's Magnificent Law," 384-90; John F.

First, he continued to com- plain of inconsistency on the part of those who attributed the cosmos to general laws yet explained living forms in terms of direct design. He wrote the following in his notebook that November: We can allow planets, suns, universe, nay whole systems of uni- verse to be governed by laws, but the smallest insect, we wish to be created at once by special act, provided with its instincts, its place in nature, its range, etc. [All] must be [either] a special act, or result of laws. Yet we placidly believe the Astronomer, when he tells us satellites, etc. &lt;^The Savage admires not a steam engine, but [if shown] a piece of coloured glass is lost in astonishment at the artificer. &gt; Our faculties are more fitted to recognize the won- derful structure of a beetle than a Universe.35 The editorial markings surrounding "The Savage . . . artificer" indicate an insertion later added to the original note.36 In part, this interpolated passage likely recalled Darwin's travels: the Beagle's crewmembers probably gave glass trinkets to the natives of Tierra del Fuego. (According to the ship's captain, the Fuegians greatly prized ornamental beads and pieces of broken glass.37) That aspect aside, the uncomprehending savage as such was a fa- miliar figure from the literature of the period: Darwin would have seen in Boswell's Life of Johnson, for instance, remarks about the way "ignorant savages" were unable to conceive of the advantages of civilization.38 Still, the most significant feature of the illustration in Darwin's notebook was something not to be found in the common literary culture. For here Darwin made his first appeal to the uncomprehending savage specifically as repre- senting the design theorist.39 There was a further way in which Darwin elaborated his previously- 35 Darwin's Notebooks, N36. 36 Sandra Herbert and David Kohn, "Introduction," Darwin's Notebooks, 12. 37 Robert Fitzroy, Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of His Majesty's ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836, 3 vols.

In the Mollusca the nervous system is endowed with the knowledge [that is, reveals a pattern] of trying a hundred schemes of structure, in the course of ages &lt;^step by step&gt;."41 Here Darwin por- trayed the Malthusian sorting process as bound by strict necessity yet never- theless improvised and contingent. That process established only the procedural conditions for adaptive change; it did not predetermine specific outcomes.42 Darwin thus evoked the Janus-faced historical tradition that he would epitomize later via his ship analogy. IV. OF SAVAGES AND SHIPS: THE TEXTUAL SOURCES OF DARWIN'S IMAGE Soon after his return from the voyage on the Beagle, Darwin began a wide- ranging reading program: this we see from the running list he kept of the things he read. Darwin had concluded, early on, that humans must have evolved from an ape-like ancestor, and so he was eager to explain the ori- gins of humanity's mental, moral, and social traits. Accordingly, he con- sulted an array of philosophical writings in search of insight into these subjects. The texts that helped to inspire his savage-and-ship illustration were part of this research, for in these works he discovered material that was useful for more than his original purpose.43 In February of 1839, Dar- win read the English chemist Sir Humphry Davy's Consolations in Travel, or, the Last Days of a Philosopher (1830), a series of dialogues in the British 40 Darwin's Notebooks, B114. Similar remarks appear ibid., B101 and M136. 41 Darwin's Notebooks, Macculloch Abstract 58. 42 For a useful discussion of Darwin's reconciliation of design and chance in the notebook period, see M.

In a discussion of the mind-body problem, the chief interlocutor concedes that the machinery of the body may be necessary to the function of the mind, yet he argues that something additional is required to produce the mind's essence. He illustrates his point with a commonplace image: A savage, who saw the operation of a number of power-looms weaving stockings cease at once on the stopping of the motion of a wheel, might well imagine that the motive force was in the wheel; he could not divine that it more immediately depended upon the steam, and ultimately upon a fire below a concealed boiler. The philosopher sees the fire which is the cause of the motion of this complicated machinery, so unintelligible to the savage; but both are equally ignorant of the divine fire which is the cause of the mechanism of organized [that is, living] structures.44 Here, then, was the ultimate source of the illustration Darwin inserted into his notebook entry of three months earlier: "The Savage admires not a steam engine [etc.]."45 No doubt it was Davy's text (along with his Tierra del Fuego experience) that prompted Darwin to put in that additional com- ment. This act in itself suggests the high degree of intentionality with which Darwin collected material for use in illustrations. In this case, however, he adapted the borrowed image in an especially significant way. He inverted Davy's theistic argument and suggested that savage ignorance actually rep- resented the outlook of the design thinker: it was he who found organic life "unintelligible." Six months later, Darwin read David Hume's Dialogues concerning Natural Religion (1779). Although this work did not reject theism, it did critique the kind of natural theology that had prevailed in Britain for nearly a century. Hume called into question the inference from apparent design to a grand designer: the intricate patterns found in nature, he argued, did not necessarily spring from the mind of a supreme craftsman. Hume made this point in a number of passages, including the following: 44 Humphry Davy, Consolations in Travel, or, The Last Days of a Philosopher (1830; London, Smith, Elder and Co., 1840), 340-41, emphasis in the original.

If we survey a ship, what an exalted idea must we form of the ingenuity of the carpenter, who framed so complicated, useful, and beautiful a machine? And [yet] what surprise must we entertain, when we find him a stupid mechanic, who imitated others, and copied an art, which, through a long succession of ages, after multiplied trials, mistakes, corrections, deliberations, and controversies, had been gradually improving? Many worlds might have been botched and bungled, throughout an eternity, ere this system was struck out [that is, fashioned]: Much labour lost: Many fruitless trials made: And a slow, but con- tinuing improvement carried on during infinite ages in the art of world-making.46 Hume thus suggested that there could be multiple versions of the human-contrivance scenario, most of them at odds with the portrait of a supernatural artificer. Was the consummately skilled craftsman really the best model on which to base our view of the creator? Why not a "stupid mechanic" who had followed someone else's plan, and whose predecessors (previous deities) themselves had proceeded by trial and error? Could not this theory equally explain the natural order? Indeed, said Hume, human fashioning of any kind was actually less plausible a model than was the notion that the natural world had developed spontaneously like a living organism in its own right: theoretically, at least, this hypothesis could better account for the known facts.47 (This was the idea of Hume's that Erasmus Darwin had mentioned in his Zoonomia.) Hence there were multiple possi- ble explanations of how nature had reached its present state of complexity. Especially important for our purposes, the alternative that Hume set forth in the greatest detail was the idea of "an art, which, through a long succes- sion of ages, after multiplied trials, mistakes, corrections, deliberations, and controversies, had been gradually improving."48 46 David Hume, Dialogues concerning Natural Religion, ed.

The book had long been notorious for its thesis that "private vices" promote "public benefits": civi- lized behavior had arisen because it was found to be necessary in order to gratify selfish desires. Uncensored displays of self-regard, for instance, would have been softened over time as humanity experienced the unpleas- ant responses such actions elicited: the long-term result would be politeness. Here, then, was Mandeville's cynical moral philosophy, a riposte to Lord Shaftsbury's theory of a "natural law" of ethics.51 Of special interest is the narrative form in which Mandeville cast his argument, for his book was an early and influential example of conjectural- historical writing. That genre often emphasized the unplanned character of human progress: Mandeville thus suggested that humans learned to be so- ciable mainly through unreflective imitation, "without being aware of the natural Causes, that oblige them to act as they do."52 To highlight this point, he compared the development of refined manners and morals to the rise of modern technology. The latter was usually considered the achieve- ment of highly gifted individuals, but Mandeville denied this: To Men who never turn'd their Thoughts that way, it certainly is almost inconceivable to what prodigious Height, from next to nothing, some Arts may be and have been raised by human Indus- try and Application, by the uninterrupted Labour, and joint Expe- rience of many Ages, tho' none but Men of ordinary Capacity 49 Mandeville composed the first volume of his Fable in poetic verse. Darwin, however, read only the second volume, which had been added as an apologetic in the form of a set of dialogues. 50 Following Mandeville's title on his reading list, Darwin wrote "second volume ex- tracted."

We often ascribe to the Excel- lency of Man's Genius, and the Depth of his Penetration, what is in Reality owing to length of Time, and the Experience of many Generations, all of them very little differing from one another in natural Parts and Sagacity.53 To illustrate, Mandeville considered the development of the sailing ship. On one hand, he declared, "What a Noble as well as Beautiful, what a glorious Machine is a First-Rate Man of War, when she is under Sail, well rigg'd, and well mann'd!" On the other hand, no individual mind had conceived of that invention in advance, and even now only a few could fully understand its operations: The Chevalier Reneau has wrote [sic] a Book, in which he shews the Mechanism of Sailing, and accounts mathematically for every thing that belongs to the working and steering of a Ship. [But] I am persuaded, that neither the first Inventors of Ships and Sailing, or those, who have made Improvements since in any Part of them, ever dream'd of those Reasons [that is, technical concepts], any more than now the rudest and most illiterate of the vulgar do, when they are made Sailors.54 (A similar point appeared in Humphry Davy's Consolations in Travel: "The processes of most of the useful arts, which you call chemical, have been invented and improved without any refined views, without any general sys- tem of knowledge. Lucretius attributes to accident the discovery of the fu- sion of the metals [etc.]."55) Mandeville, in his Fable, then drew the comparison between seafaring technology and the civilized virtues: I verily believe, not only that the raw Beginners, who made the first Essays in either Art, good Manners as well as Sailing, were ignorant of the true Cause, the real Foundation those Arts are built upon in Nature; but likewise that, even now both Arts are brought to great Perfection [sic], the greatest Part of those that are most expert, and daily making Improvements in them, know as little of the Rationale of them, as their Predecessors did at first. 53 Mandeville, Fable of the Bees, 2: 141-42. 54 Ibid., 2: 141, 143. 55 Davy, Consolations in Travel ', 354 (this passage appears in the fifth dialogue). 457</page><page sequence="18">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS ♦ JULY 2008 In sum, standards of civility, like improvements in ship construction, had developed in the absence of prior design: "But all this is done without re- flection, and Men by degrees, and great Length of Time, fall as it were into these Things spontaneously."56 The similarity to Hume's ship analogy is obvious, and, although it is not essential to my argument, one suspects that Hume borrowed from Mandeville on this point. We have seen Hume's remarks: "If we survey a ship, what an exalted idea must we form of the ingenuity of the carpenter, who framed so complicated, useful, and beautiful a machine?" Yet in spite of this initial impression, Hume argued, it was really more probable that the workman had been "a stupid mechanic, who imitated others, and cop- ied an art, which, through a long succession of ages, after multiplied trials, mistakes, corrections, deliberations, and controversies, had been gradually improving."57 Surely Darwin looked to Hume and Mandeville both when he formu- lated his own ship analogy. Indeed each writer contributed something es- sential to his picture. Both portrayed the ship as the product of cumulative historical experience - although Hume's wording seems to have been espe- cially influential. The similarity showed already in Darwin's 1844 "Essay," which said that we should view organic forms "nearly in the same way as when we look at a great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen."58 Hume's main contribution, however, was to posit slowly- accumulated experience specifically as an alternative to skillful and inten- tional design. Even so, Hume used the ship to suggest but one of several possibilities, while Mandeville placed that image at the center of his argu- ment. Mandeville's discussion of the sailing ship showed in far more detail how unplanned and piecemeal change could effect long-term improvement. Mandeville's Fable was thus the culmination of the process by which Darwin conceived of his multi-part analogy. Darwin naturally would link the hypothetical ships he found in his readings to the real-life Beagle, that being his personal point of reference on the subject of maritime technology. Yet this linkage, of itself, could not have evoked the scene he had witnessed from off the coast of Tierra del Fuego: something else must have pointed toward that specific episode. Clearly, Darwin's reading of Humphry Davy had set the stage. He had already recast Davy's analogy so that the savage 56 Mandeville, Fable of the Bees, 2: 144. 57 Hume, Dialogues, 167. 58 Darwin, Foundations of the Origin of Species, 189. 458</page><page sequence="19">Alter ♦ Darwin's Vision of Natural Selection represented the design theorist.

THE ROLE OF CONJECTURAL HISTORY The broader intellectual context surrounding Darwin's ship analogy was provided by eighteenth-century conjectural-historical writings, chiefly by the Scotsmen Henry Home (Lord Kames), Dugald Stewart, and David Hume (his collected essays). Reading these works would have prepared Darwin to see Mandeville's Fable in a particular light, not just as skeptical social philosophy but also as a way of understanding the path of historical development. In turn, more than merely helping Darwin to formulate an illustration of natural selection, the Scottish historical vision likely helped to shape the way he thought about natural selection itself - especially in relation to theistic design. The notebooks show that Darwin viewed the selection process thus: adaptation resulted from "ten thousand trials" and the "trying of a hundred schemes of structure, in the course of ages."59 This scenario paralleled what Darwin had already seen in works of philosophi- cal history. He left no commentary on these readings that directly indicates this linkage, yet the similarity between the themes in those texts and views he expressed in his own works suggests that one likely influenced the other. The conjectural historians sought to reconstruct the "natural history" of society by providing plausible explanations of how elaborate customs and complex institutions could have developed from simple beginnings.60 Although these accounts were speculative, they avoided sheer invention by emphasizing continuously-acting causes and deriving the most likely re- sults. Darwin was already oriented toward this approach via his affinity for Charles Lyell's uniformitarian geology, which downplayed "catastrophic" interventions.61 Indeed, in this sense, The Origin of Species was itself a work of conjectural history. We are interested especially in an ironic dual thesis that characterized this genre. On one hand, the Scottish thinkers cited intelligible causes: they regarded the laws of human nature and of material existence as history's 59 Darwin's Notebooks.

Past ages had stumbled upon arrangements that im- proved civilization, even as the actors themselves pursued only proximate ends. This latter theme was especially common.63 It should be noted, how- ever, that Darwin did not become acquainted with this idea specifically via the famous "invisible hand" thesis from Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations (1776): there is no evidence that he read that work.64 Yet he still would have been familiar with the concept, which was generally accepted among Victorian England's Whig middle class.65 It was the Scots' special genius to regard the two themes just described as mutually supportive: invoking the non-rational character of the histori- cal process was itself a mode of rational explanation. Significantly, both emphases appeared in works Darwin read in the months before he began to formulate his natural selection theory, that is, in the summer and early fall of 1838 (see Figure I).66 First, Lord Kames's Sketches on the Early History of Man (1774) argued that humanity's socio-economic develop- ment had been propelled by population pressure on food supply - this al- ready a widely-discussed issue prior to Malthus's famous essay.67 Here, then, was the element of law-like necessity. Yet Kames also emphasized unintended outcomes.

The latter would not have realized that they were taking the first steps toward creating a pastoral economy, thus inaugu- rating a new stage in the development of civilization.68 Also at this time, Darwin read a 1793 essay by the Edinburgh philoso- pher Dugald Stewart, a commemoration of the life and work of Adam Smith.69 Included here was a classic description of conjectural-historical methodology. Neither Smith nor Stewart was interested in the extraordi- nary events found in traditional historical narratives; rather, each assumed for the sake of rational explanation that a nation's institutions had de- veloped through incremental improvements, beginning from a state of unimproved nature.70 What is especially striking is the way Stewart's char- acterization of this procedure resembles Darwin's critique of the theistic design idea. Even when the historical record was far from complete, said Stewart, "if we can show, from the known principles of human nature, how [an institution] . . . might have arisen . . . a check is given to that indolent philosophy, which refers to a miracle, whatever appearances, both in the natural and moral worlds, it is unable to explain ."71 Resort to a miracle, or any other special intervention, was a mark of intellectual laziness, betraying an inability to provide a real explanation. This of course was precisely the kind of thinking for which Darwin faulted the natural theologians. A further work that Darwin read in this period epitomized our dual thematic. In his memoirs, Sir Walter Scott praised the lectures on law he had attended while a student at the University of Edinburgh: "I can never sufficiently admire the penetration and clearness of conception which were necessary to the arrangement of the fabric of [Scottish] law, formed origi- nally under the strictest influence of feudal principles, and innovated, al- tered, and broken in upon by the change of times, of habits, and of manners." Taming this body of knowledge required "combining the past state of our legal enactments with the present, and tracing clearly and judi- 68 Henry Home, Lord Kames, Sketches of the History of Man, 4 vols. (1774; Edinburgh: William Creech, 1788), 1:91. 69 According to Darwin's Notebooks, M108, Darwin's reading of Stewart's essay can be dated about 25 or 26 August 1838. 70 We can infer from Darwin's Notebooks, E4-6, that Darwin took this aspect of Stew- art's vision to heart. 71 Dugald Stewart, "Account of the Life and Writings of Adam Smith," in Adam Smith, Essays on Philosophical Subjects, ed.

Darwin suggested a similar procedure via his natural selection theory, especially as embodied in the ship analogy. These themes were summarized once again in David Hume's collected essays, which Darwin read in the spring of 1841. In "The Rise and Progress of the Arts and Sciences," Hume called for historical explanation to be based on the identifiable laws of human nature, stressing the superiority of such accounts to those that focused on chance events. The latter, he said, precluded further inquiry and led to a "state of ignorance."73 Then, in his essay "On Government," Hume noted that the rise of civic institutions had not emerged from any grand scheme: But though this progress of human affairs may appear certain and inevitable, and though the support which allegiance to justice be founded on obvious principles of human nature [sic], it cannot be expected that men should beforehand be able to discover them, or foresee their operation. Government commences more casually and more imperfectly.74 Darwin read these remarks well after he had formulated his natural selec- tion theory, and also after he had read Mandeville's Fable of the Bees. Still, Hume's essays must have reinforced themes that he had seen in this and other works of philosophical history. VI. CONCLUSION: MORE THAN SIMPLE REPLACEMENT It is often said that Darwin replaced the idea of special creation with his theory of natural selection, and in a sense this is true: natural selection took over the explanatory functions supplied by the Creator in design theory. Stephen Jay Gould thus analyzed the parallel arguments used by Boyle and Paley, on the one hand, and Darwin, on the other, showing how Darwin 72 John Gibson Lockhart, Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, 3 vols.

Abigail Lustig similarly describes Darwin's "inside-out transforma- tion of natural theology into evolutionary biology," with natural selection "replacing Paley's God." Alternatively, regarding this transformation as an effort to reform natural theology, John Cornell argues that Darwin "did not so much deny the notion of God's intelligent construction of particular 'living machines' as simply replace it with the idea of the intelligent ordering of general phenomena" - that is, with the idea of designed laws of nature.75 Although these formulations supply useful starting points, they hide from view Darwin's further conceptual move. In the aftermath of the Bea- gle voyage, when he first embraced transmutationism, Darwin indeed had wanted to replace belief in special creation with evidence pointing to ratio- nal laws governing (evolutionary) species formation. Yet even at this early stage, prior to coming up with the natural selection principle, he had seen the need for a theory that joined creative force with unpredictable out- comes. Did anything prepare him to view organic evolution in this light? Works he had read in previous months supplied concrete examples of how slow and unguided change could bring about the same sorts of ordered development as did preplanned design. The sailing ship well illustrated this idea because its history manifestly was one of very gradual improvement from simple beginnings. More than just an evolved technology, it fit within the same category as the many complex social institutions described by the Scottish historical writers. This was a scenario that a newer invention such as the steam engine, or even the telescope, could not quite capture. Recently, a number of historians have shown that Darwin held to a German-romanticist idea of nature, this starting even before his Beagle voy- age and continuing for the remainder of his career. Phillip R. Sloan, David Kohn, and Robert J. Richards have argued convincingly that Darwin did not view nature the way most of his English peers did, as a quasi-mechani- cal realm. For although he accepted the Paleyan problematic of seeking to account for adaptations, he was not obliged to retain Paley's mechanistic vision; rather, he viewed natural selection as an actively creative process. This romanticist celebration of nature provided an overarching framework within which Darwin developed his specific evolutionary ideas.76 The Scot- 75 Stephen Jay Gould, "On Transmuting Boyle's Law to Darwin's Revolution," in Evolu- tion, Society, Science, and the Universe, ed.
