<plain_text><page sequence="1">S. W. Sykes and J. P. Clayton (Ed.). Christ Faith and History: Cambridge Studies in Christology. Pp. x + 303. (Cambridge University Press, 1972.) This volume (which is intended as a successor to Soundings on the latter's tenth anniversary) is divided into four parts under the following titles: Beginning all over again?, Primitive Christologies again, Christology and historiography, the logical grammar of Christology. I shall deal with each part in the order given. Part i. Here the most important essays are the opening ones by M. F. Wiles' and Peter R. Baelz. Wiles tentatively suggests that Christology rests on the following mistake. The early Christians assumed that the creation of man was due to a supernatural act of God, and that the Fall was an historical event. They then inferred tha.t God's redemptive activity in Christ had the same supernatural and historically objective character-that Jesus was God incarnate. But if the assumptions are false the inference is also false. Wiles proceeds to claim that we must tell two different kinds of story. On the one hand there is the scientific story of evolution as a continuous process. On the other hand there is the mythological story told in Genesis. Similarly we must tell two stories of our redemption. The 'mistake' is to identify them. Wiles writes thus on p. 9. 'Can we not speak in a similar way of incarnation and redemption? Here too, I suggest, we will need to tell two stories. In the first place a human story of the partial overcoming in human lives of that repudiation of the fellowship with God of which the doctrine of the fall speaks. And also a mythological story of God's total self-giving, God's compassionate acceptance of pain and evil whereby that overcoming is made possible and effective. We may interweave these two stories in various ways; in the gospels themselves they are already so interwoven and for religious purposes we need to have it so. But we do not need-indeed on this analysis we would be wrong-to tie the two stories together by claiming that at one particular point, namely the life, death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, the two stories are literally united with one another. Nevertheless it could still be reasonable to give to the life of Jesus a special place as illuminating, as no other life, the significance of the whole story, as bringing home to us effectively the transcendent divine truth which the mythological story in its own way is designed to proclaim.' 1 His essay is reprinted from an article in this journal (VI, 1970 pp. 69-76). D</page><page sequence="2">354 RELIGIOUS STUDIES Wiles is fully alive to the question how, if Jesus was not God incarnate, Christians have a right to see in the 'story' of Jesus a redemptively unique revelation of God. The answer he gives is that for Christians this 'story' enjoys a causal, not merely temporal, priority over other 'stories'. 'The precise form of the answer to the question, 'Why this story?', would need to depend very largely on the context within which it was being raised. If it is raised in a specifically Christian context, where the alternative stories in mind as possible focal embodiments of the doctrine of redemption might be the stories of an Augustine or a Francis, it would be pertinent to point to the directness of the relation ofJesus to God in contrast to the mediatorial role of the person of Jesus himself in Augustine's and Francis' own under standings of their relationship with God' (p. IO). Baelz is dissatisfied with Wiles's thesis. His main points are these. Scientific and metaphysical explanations function at different levels, and they must not be confused. In particular 'the spiritual cannot be explained in terms of the material, which is by definition non-spiritual. There remains a gap, and it is this "gap" which the "special" creative action of God is introduced in order to "explain" ' (p. I7). Secondly, we all inherit the consequences of a deliberate rejection of God on the part of our ancestors (although it may be better to speak of many past 'falls' than of one original and all-determinative 'fall'). Moreover, we must take seriously the classical view that all theistic discourse rests on the principle of analogy that avoids (mythological) anthropomorphism on the one hand and sheer agnosticism on the other. Finally, Christians in the apostolic age were compelled to speak, implicitly if not explicitly, of Jesus as divine because they apprehended him as such. 'The evidence of history, experience and reflection will all have to be taken into account. But the questions themselves should be sufficient to suggest the possibility that it was Jesus himself, in his earthly life and in his risen presence, that compelled his disciples to modify the logic of their theological language, rather than any misconceived attempt to speak about him in a mythological language which already lay to hand. Was it the logical ambiguities in the word Kyrios which eventually led to the worship of Jesus and the puzzles of Chalcedon, or was it something dimly but com pellingly apprehended in Jesus himself?' (p. 30). The question is primarily one of vision not of language. 'There is, I repeat, a difference of vision. It is not the case that traditional theologians want an ontological backing for the same vision which is expressed in a reductive theology. The "ontological backing" is a constituent part of their vision. If their vision is veridical, then the logic of their language must be adapted to meet the demands of their vision. If their vision is illusory or misunderstood, then no such adapt ation will be necessary, and if any takes place it will be a logical mistake' (p. 3I). Baelz's queries and criticisms are, in my view, wholly cogent. In the next essay J. A. T. Robinson maintains that although there is</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 355 strong New Testament testimony to Jesus' moral perfection the attribution of sinlessness to him 'is a theological judgment rather than an extrapolation from the historical evidence' (p. 44). S. W. Sykes makes the same point more generally in contending that 'the question about the humanity of Jesus is a doctrinal one' (p. 56). If Jesus was divine, or anyhow uniquely related to God as the final agent of divine salvation, we must expect dis continuity as well as continuity between Jesus's humanity and any ideal or norm of human nature that we may independently construct. These writers raise Christologically crucial questions that are all too frequently evaded. I agree that Jesus' sinlessness cannot be empirically established with certainty, and that if he was divine he cannot be regarded merely as the highest exemplification of so-called 'normal' humanity. Part 2. The first contribution, by Sebastian Moore, is too impressionistic and emotive for profitable comment in this review. C. F. D. Moule examines, with a characteristic delicacy of touch, three paradoxes in New Testament Christology. The first is Christ's humiliation and exaltation. Moule (rightly, I think) holds that the second is 'the crux of the incarnational question' (p. I02). This is the paradox (that Sykes indicates) of the continuity and discontinuity between Jesus and the rest of humanity. Here Moule observes admirably that although the New Testament speaks of Jesus as an ordinary man, 'on the other side of the paradox is an affirmation of a newness and sinlessness which mark a distinction between Christ's humanity and ours. It is true that sinlessness is a negative quality for which there could be no direct evidence, and that, in any case, the explicit affirmations of Christ's sinlessness in the New Testament are all part of the expression of a belief, reached, no doubt, through experience, in his Saviourhood rather than being a part of a discussion of the quality of his manhood as such' (p. I03). Moule's third paradox is that in the New Testament Jesus is regarded as both an individual and an 'inclusive person'. He makes the interesting suggestion that 'somewhere in the Christian experience of the Holy Spirit through Jesus Christ lies the new synthesis of individuality and corporeity' (p. I09). The last essay in this section, by G. W. H. Lampe, brings us back to the fundamental categories of Christology. Although Lampe recognises the reasons that led the Church to speak of Jesus as the Logos incarnate, he proposes that instead we should speak of him in terms of Spirit-possession. We then do not regard Jesus as being 'substantivally' God. Nor do we regard him as being merely 'adjectivally' so-'that is to say, God-like or "divine" in the sense of being a man who possessed to an excellent degree the qualities that we attribute to God' (p. 124). Rather we acknowledge him to be God 'adverbially'. 'By the mutual interaction of the Spirit's influence and the free response of the human spirit such a unity of will and operation was established that in all his actions the human Jesus acted divinely' (ibid.).</page><page sequence="4">356 RELIGIOUS STUDIES However, to say that Christ acted divinely in this sense is not to say that he was divine. To claim that he was God 'adverbially' is not to claim that he was God. Lampe's terminology is exposed to the same criticisms that Cyril brought against the Nestorian usages of 'conjunction' and 'indwelling'. With an irony that attends so many modern reformulations of Christology we are brought back, ineluctably, to the eve of Chalcedon. Don Cupitt, having noted the variety of life-styles for which Christ's sanction has been invoked, concludes that the idea of 'One Church, one Faith, one Lord' is in irreversible decline. 'Christianity is rather a family of monotheistic faiths which in various ways find in Jesus a key to the relation of man with God. It has and continues to have almost as much internal diversity as Hinduism' (p. 142). Cupitt does not argue his case in detail, so that fair comment is difficult. Yet even if various life-styles have been designated 'Christian' it does not follow that the designation is valid in every case. Theologically, too, it is obvious that the Christian is not free to hold any beliefs. The comparison with Hinduism is so faulty in so many obvious ways that comment ought to be superfluous. It is enough to note that Hinduism tolerates every form of religion and sees no necessity to find in any historical figure 'a key to the relation of man to God'. Part 3. J. P. Clayton begins with an incisive critique of Tillich's views on the relation between the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith. His claim on p. I59 that historical statements can be certain is developed by Peter Carnley in the next essay which is subtly and trenchantly argued. Against current relativism he affirms that the difference between scholars' accounts of Jesus 'does not necessarily entail that all historical knowledge is uncertain' (p. I69); that 'even if we cannot write a biography of Jesus, it does not follow that we can know no historical facts concerning Jesus whatsoever' (p. I 75); and that 'logical possibility of error does not entail actual possibility of error, and to be able to thlink of possible evidence that would demonstrate that an event did not occur does not mean that an historian cannot be perfectly justified in asserting with absolute certainty that the event occurred' (p. I87). I find both these essays convincing. Next, G. N. Stanton shows that the gospels are close (in form) to Hellenistic biographies in so far as the latter are often not concerned with precise chronology or development of character. But he also stresses the fact that no account of any ancient Jew is so rich in detail as the evangelists' account of Jesus. J. C. O'Neill urges that Mark provides reliable evidence that Jesus' tomb was found empty. Part 4. J. K. Riches asserts that 'theology is a meditation on the mystery of the divine love in its engagement with the world as revealed in Jesus Christ' (p. 23I); but he does not develop the assertion sufficiently. S. T. Katz warns us against a premature and obscurantist appeal to 'mystery'. The warning is just. Yet the author's polemical tone and negative approach</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 357 prevent his essay from being especially helpful. I am sure that the next contributor, B. L. Hebblethwaite, is right in maintaining that 'it is the interaction of all three features-interpretation, event and experience-that creates and sustains a coherent system of doctrine' (p. 27I). This essay both requires and merits expansion. D. M. MacKinnon concludes the volume by contending (validly, as I think) that in Christology we cannot avoid ontology in general and the homoousion in particular. This symposium is valuable, not merely in revealing the theological interests prevalent in its place of origin, but also in providing a useful (though of course necessarily incomplete) conspectus of the Christological problems that are likely to occupy theologians in the immediate future. The dominant impression I receive from the volume is that on properly objective grounds a (negatively) radical and reductionist Christology is, to say the least, not self-evidently true. If it is only by registering a cautiously propelled swing of the theological pendulum this book will have served its purpose and earned the gratitugde of many readers. H. P. OWEN</page></plain_text>
