Xenophanes, fr. 38 (If god had not created yellow honey, much sweeter they would say were figs.) H isaye Yamamoto's short story "Epithalamium" (first pub- lished in 1960) opens with the protagonist, Yuki Tsumagari, finding herself married to Marco, a not-so-former alcoholic. An epithalamium (literally, "at the threshold") is a Greek wedding song whose theme is a girl's passage from childhood to woman- hood on her wedding night.2 In a series of flashbacks, we learn that Yuki was interned in Topaz, Utah, during World War II; once wrote for a small Japanese newspaper; reads the poet Gerard Man- ley Hopkins; and, still unwed at the age of 31, was teased that she might be a lesbian by her Japanese writer friends. These last two references are one of the story's more obvious links to the poet Sappho, a writer of epithalamia. Yamamoto's "Epithalamium" and Sappho's poetry are both concerned with love, physical desire, and lost innocence. The untouched beauty of young girls is celebrated wistfully and sadly in Sappho's poetry (see LP 27, 30, 44A, 49, 102, 104, 105, 107, 114); Yuki is Japanese for "snow," and the 1'An earlier version of this paper was given at the 1996 CAMWS Annual Meeting as part of a panel on pedagogy organized by Robert A. LaFleur. I would like to thank him, the other members of the panel (Peter M. Smith, Stewart Flory, and Thomas J. Sienkewicz) and the audience for their generous comments on my paper. I would also like to express my thanks to John F. Miller, the editor of CJ, and to the anonymous referee, for their helpful suggestions. 2 On virginity and its loss as the subject of an epithalamium, see the discussion of Sappho's epithalamia fragments in Burnett 1983: 216: "virginity kept was glorious, while virginity lost in a wedding-bed was an even more splendid thing."

A knowledge of the Greek genre epithalamium enables a reader more fully to understand why Yuki considers Hopkins' poem "God's Grandeur" ("The world is charged with the grandeur of God. / It will flame out, like shining from shook foil") to be the epithalamium she would most prefer (Yamamoto 1988: 69). For Yamamoto's "Epithalamium" is not only about Yuki's troubled past, but also the lost innocence, the "defilement," of Japanese-Americans (and American society as a whole) as a result of their internment during World War II. Reading "classical" and "multicultural" literature together can alert one to an author's use of classical motifs, but the interplay between classical and multicultural texts goes beyond such basic informative references. Classical-multicultural comparisons can foster real reexaminations of literature and the meanings it creates. They can reveal the vibrancy of ancient literature and suggest new approaches to the question "what is a classic?"; students can be asked to explain why they think a particular multicultural text will be able to survive for 2000 years and more, as have Homer and Virgil. I will examine a few multicultural works to show how knowledge of the classics is necessary to understand multicultural literature and its place in the history of Western literature: Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's Dictee, Toni Morrison's Beloved, and Rita Dove's The Darker Face of the Earth. I will then give specific suggestions for course syllabi integrating classical and multicultural literature.3 The last decade has seen a rise in the presence of multicultural or ethnic literatures on college curricula and as a subject of schol- arship.4 The introduction of courses on more "relevant" literatures has all too often occurred in place of the "traditional Western canon," the Greek and Roman classics (Phinney 1989).s A number of scholars 3 An Appendix of texts of multicultural literature for a course on classics and multiculturalism (some of which are herein discussed) can be found at the end of this essay. 4 For instance, a recent article in The Chronicle of Higher Education announces "A New Emphasis on Ethnic Studies: More colleges add classes and programs on Asian-American history and culture" (Cage 1996; see also D'Souza 1991: 59-93; Bloom 1994: 7). 5 Multiculturalism has also made its way into the secondary and elementary levels of our schools (Snowden 1996: 115). One of the textbooks for the seventh- grade history curriculum at Mary Institute and Saint Louis Country Day School is entitled A History of US, published by Oxford University Press (Hakim 1995), though students in ninth-grade take a full year of Western Civilization. Materials on cul- tural diversity in Greece and Rome are included in two packets by the American Classical League, "Exemplary Latin Programs for Elementary Schools" and</page><page sequence="3">READING THE CLASSICS AND MULTICULTURAL LITERATURE 57 have indeed sounded the alarm of a "crisis in classics" in the face of declining numbers of students taking Latin and Greek in high schools and colleges and the threat of the elimination of courses and even positions in Classics Departments (Clack 1989; Mellors 1989; Phinney 1989; Kitchell et al. 1995).6 Classicists have tended to approach multiculturalism "in the quite specific sense of deriving from many cultures."7 They have focused on revealing the inher- ently multicultural character of the ancient world, described as one in which Romans and Ethiopians and Greeks and Jews and Persians and peoples of many other lands mingled together. The 1995 Annual Meeting of the American Philological Association included panels on such subjects as "The Rim of the Frog Pool: The Interac- tion of Peoples and Cultures on the Periphery of the Ancient Greek World," and "Geography and Ethnicity." Erich S. Gruen's presi- dential address at the 1992 APA Meeting, "Cultural Fictions and Cultural Identity," specifically addressed the question of classics "Exemplary Latin Programs for Middle Schools"; a booklet, "Beyond Greece and Rome: Teaching Cultural Diversity in the Roman Empire" is also available from the Classical Association of New England. The current questioning of the place of classical studies in university curricula reflects a long-standing debate about classics and American education. In his work on the classical heritage in the United States, Meyer Reinhold (1984: 50-93) de- scribes the early Americans' doubts about the usefulness of a classical education in their new country. Said William Livingston, later the first governor of New Jer- sey, in A Letter to the Right Reverend Father in God, John, Bishop of Landaff: "The most intimate acquaintance with the classics, will not remove our oaks; nor a taste for the Georgics cultivate our lands. Many of our young people are knocking their heads against the Iliad [sic], who should employ their hands in clearing our swamps and draining our marshes" (36). In a new country that was said to be creating a new people and a new civilization, education was to have practical ends first and foremost. One of the most vocal opponents of classical learning, Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and the founder of Dickinson College, "conducted an unrelenting campaign from 1788 until his death in 1813 to eradicate the classics from American education" and "came to distrust the dead languages as fetters on the expansion of science, on the viability of democratic institutions, and on the material development of the country" (72, 74). 6 This "crisis" is the subject of such publications as Classics: A Discipline and Profession in Crisis? (Culham and Edmunds 1989) and "Self-Promotion and the 'Crisis' in the Classics" (Heath 1995). 7 SO writes Rogers (1996: 429) in a response to Martin Bernal's Black Athena. Similarly, Mario Liverani defines a "multicultural model" of studying world history as a "multicentered" one, "in which different centers and different political and cultural strategies are all granted equal attention and merits as due. . ." (1996: 423; on similar uses of the term "multiculturalism," see also Lefkowitz 1996: 19; Coleman 1996: 293). Some idea-and by no means an exhaustive one-of the confusion and con-</page><page sequence="4">58 KRISTINA CHEW and the "hot topic" of cultural studies8: "The proposition that multiculturalism and the study of classical antiquity are somehow at cross-purposes strikes me as peculiar and paradoxical. Few troversy over the word "multiculturalism" is reflected in the following scholars' defini- tions. The editor of Comparative Literature in the Age of Multiculturalism writes in his introduction that "comparatists are best equipped to undertake this important task [of articulating the value of literature to the individual and to society] because of the breadth of their knowledge of literature's construction and function in differ- ent cultures" (Bernheimer 1995: 16). He suggests that "multiculturalism, inherently pluralistic" should have "a natural propensity toward comparison" that has, however, "been checked by the mimetic imperatives of an essentialist politics" (9). I discuss below how "essentialist politics" defines and to some extent is multicul- turalism in the United States. "[T]oday's multiculturalists attack the imperialism of Western culture only to essentialize a supposedly universal (but actually very American) story of the struggle for autonomy from culture; not only do subaltern groups struggle for autonomy from dominant cultures, but individuals within sub- altern groups also struggle for autonomy from the oppressive values of their own cultures." So writes Christopher Shannon (1995: 676), an American intellectual historian, in discussing the growth of the liberal values of tolerance and pluralism in the wake of World War II. The classicist Karl Galinsky (1992: 116), noting the "fairly loose current definitions" of the term, defines multiculturalism as "the in- teraction between various cultures and their mutual awareness." In an article in MELUS, "The Journal for the Society for the Study of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States," E. San Juan, Jr. (1994: 61) critiques the current use of "multi- culturalism" and "diversity" among academics as the establishment's "strategic response" to placate the demands of minorities. After a brief survey of the speakers for the keynote event of the 1992 Modern Language Association Presidential Forum, including leading African-American literature scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and postcolonialist Sara Suleri, he writes: "Multiculturalism may be conceived as the latest reincarnation of the assimilationist drive to pacify unruly subaltern groups." 8 Cultural studies should not be too readily equated with multiculturalism. "At some campuses," writes the black feminist bell hooks (1990: 125), "cultural studies programs are seen as potential replacements for black studies and women's studies." She further notes the appropriation of cultural studies on race by white scholars: "Participants in contemporary discussions of culture highlighting differ- ence and otherness who have not interrogated their perspectives, the location from which they write in a culture of domination, can easily make of this potentially radical discipline a new ethnographic terrain, a field of study where old practices are simultaneously critiqued, re-enacted and sustained." Similarly, Rey Chow (1995: 110), a scholar of contemporary Chinese culture, warns against the assumption that the call for "diversity" has been sufficiently addressed: "My point is that we should not let the euphoria of oppositional thinking lure us into assuming that, by positing a multilingual, other-culture-oriented approach to comparative literature and by making the gesture of welcoming non-Western cultures and civilizations into our curricula, we are going to make real changes-when, already, in myriad forms for an extended period of time, the very disciplinary structures that we seek to challenge have been firmly established in the pedagogical practices related to non-Western languages and literatures. ..."</page><page sequence="5">READING THE CLASSICS AND MULTICULTURAL LITERATURE 59 societies have ever been more multicultural than those clustered around the Mediterranean" (Gruen 1993). Charles Segal's presidential address at the 1994 APA Meeting, "Classics, Ecumenicism, and Greek Tragedy," noted that "classical studies in the United States have some of the advantages of American cuisine," an allusion to the familiar metaphor of American ethnic diversity as a "melting pot"9 (Segal 1995). Karl Galinsky's book, Classical and Modern Interactions, offers abundant examples of the cultural interactions between the Greeks and their Eastern neighbors, and between the Romans and the cultures they absorbed into their empire, including those of Gaul, Spain, and northern Africa (1992: 116-53). Molly Myerowitz Levine (1992: 218) proposes that Classics Departments be abolished in favor of the multicultural alternative of "ancient Mediterranean studies," under which classicists (including linguists, "litterateurs," historians, and archaeologists) would be assembled along with Egyptologists, Indo-Europeanists, and Semitists. But classicists' assertion of the inherent and prior "multicul- turalism" of the classical world is limited in that it does not address the texts and the issues that concern scholars of ethnic, African-American, Asian American, Chicano, Latin American, and Native American studies, the "multiculturalists."10 Multicultural or ethnic literatures are believed to speak to the experience of these groups with an immediacy that literature by long "dead white male" Western writers cannot.11 According to scholars of ethnic 9 More recently, a "salad bowl," in which an individual's ethnicity remains distinct and separate rather than being assimilated and merged into a single, "main- stream," American identity. 10 For a definition of ethnic studies, see Okihiro 1994 and Hirabayashi and Alquizola 1994. According to Okihiro (151), "beyond recapturing historical and contemporary realities and extending the community's reach, ethnic studies fundamentally sought to move the pivot, by fracturing the universalism of white men and by repositioning gender, class, race, and sexuality from the periphery to the core, decentering and recentering the colors and patterns of the old fabric." Hirabayashi and Alquizola (354-55) similarly emphasize the political, activist, and community-based orientation of ethnic studies, documenting the origin of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University in 1969 as a result of the demands of the Third World Liberation Front. 11 Thus, although my scholarly training has been as a classicist and a literary critic and my knowledge of Asian American literature is based on my own reading and searches for Asian American literature through West Coast bookstores and many libraries, I have not been questioned about my qualifications to discuss Asian American literature by professional ethnic studies scholars. There is some difference of opinion between them and myself about the nature of my qualifications: Careful training in philology, close reading, and the classical tradition enables me to read</page><page sequence="6">60 KRISTINA CHEW studies, "culture" in America means "Western culture," and students' understanding can be "opened up" by studying the "diverse" cultures of Americans who do not trace their origins to Europe and who will increasingly make up the population of this country (Takaki 1993: 2).12 Classicist Bella Zweig (1993) uses Native American models any literary work critically, while it is because I am Asian American and have always since childhood read Asian American authors that has "naturally" quali- fied me to teach and write about Asian-American literature. 12 Okihiro (1994: 7) uses the Greeks to show how "Asians entered into the European American historical consciousness long before the mid-nineteenth- century Chinese migration to 'Gold Mountain' and, I believe, even before Yankee traders and American diplomats and missionaries traveled to China in the late eighteenth century." Okihiro sees Hippocrates' description of Asians as less cou- rageous and energetic because of their climate in Airs, Waters, Places and Aristotle's view of their "servile character" in the Politics as "[enabling] an exotic, alienating construction of Asians, whether witnessed or simply imagined" (8-10). He further describes how this view of Asia according to "polarities of Greek/barbarian, male/ female, and human/animal helped to define the citizens of the polis-Greek men- as the negation of their Other--barbarian, female, animal-who were linked by analogy such that barbarian was like female was like animal." Okihiro here draws on Page duBois's Centaurs and Amazons: Women and the Pre-history of the Great Chain of Being and Edward Said's notion of Orientalism, on which see below (12-13; duBois 1982; Said 1978). Okihiro's narrative of the West's "othering" of Asia encompasses texts ranging from Arrian's history of Alexander the Great's conquests to the thirteenth-century invasions of the Mongols, Marco Polo's accounts of Asia, Columbus' "discovery" or "colonization" of America, and subsequent European explorers' "penetration of Asia" in India and Southeast Asia. His point is that the current racism experienced by Asian Americans in the United States can be directly traced back to the Greeks: "My contention is that there is a remarkable familiarity to Orientalism's face on both shores of the Atlantic and that its resemblance extends to European constructions of American Indians and Africans" (19-20). Galinsky (1992: 120-21) in effect refutes Okihiro's observations in his discus- sion of multiculturalism in Greece, which examines many of the same texts as Okihiro's book. Hippocrates' discussion of the "mental flabbiness and cowardice" of Asians as caused by their climate is seen as " . . . typically undogmatic. Neither the Asian nor the European climate produces perfection .... Nor is there a conve- nient breakdown along the line of a Greek/barbarian antithesis: both Greeks and barbarians respond in the same way to climate and political institutions. Finally, allowance is made for differences among Asiatics. The recognition of such diversity is characteristic of Greek attitudes even at that time." The Greeks' notion of barbarians is "nonbiological" and stems from the observation of different peoples speaking different languages; Galinsky notes the intelligent and sympathetic depiction of Croesus and Xerxes by Herodotus and of Medea by Euripides as evidence of the Greeks' acceptance of cultural difference. Aristotle's comments on the slavelike nature of barbarians must be seen in light of "the larger debate ... whether virtue and intellectual skill could be taught or resulted from noble genes (again, it should be emphasized that genetic ability in Greek and Roman thought is not defined in terms of race)"; the orator Antiphon is quoted as saying that "by nature we are all equally equipped in every respect to be both barbarians and Greeks" (119-20).</page><page sequence="7">READING THE CLASSICS AND MULTICULTURAL LITERATURE 61 of "perception and discourse" to devise a non-Western framework with which to study Greece. Another classicist, Shelley P. Haley (1989), however, notes the uninterested response of classicists to a colleague's work in which W. E. B. DuBois was compared to Cicero. Scholars of ethnic studies are concerned about the multicultural character of American society today.13 The question classicists need to ask themselves, especially in the area of courses and curricula, is "what can the classics teach us Americans in our multicultural society today?" Classical and multicultural literature must both be studied and must be studied together, not simply to illuminate echoes of classical texts and myths in contemporary literature, but to demonstrate the resiliency of the classical tradition. The ultimate aim of reading them together would be to study the place of classics in America at the end of the twentieth century. We must unapolo- getically teach classics and contemporary literature together to remind and instruct students that an author need not bear the precise look of themselves, nor have gone through the exact experiences and history as they have, in order to "speak to them." Haley (1989: 335-6), for instance, recommends calling students' attention to the "influence of a classical education on the leaders of civil rights movements and minority groups," including Martin Luther King, Jr. Proponents of ethnic studies need to be alerted to the fact that, if they can so easily sweep away classics and Western culture's tradi- tions, how easily too can some generation after them alike accuse ethnic studies of its "irrelevancy," its failure to address the needs of the current student body. Scholarship on ethnic literature has focused on comparisons among different ethnic groups, as African- American and Asian American, and has tended to involve mostly sociological and historical analysis.14 Wernor Sollors (1986: 237), professor of American literature and African-American Studies at Harvard, calls on social scientists and historians to integrate an 13 It could be argued that the current notion of multiculturalism is unsuitably and ahistorically applied to the ancient world. Our notions of tolerance and pluralism, unspoken values among proponents of multiculturalism and American liberalism, are specific to our own 20th-century American culture. "The persistent equation of tolerance with some self-evidently neutral conception of 'freedom' has served merely to naturalize the social relations of modern, Western individualism," notes Shannon (1995: 660). 14 Typical articles are on such subjects as "Memory and the Ethnic Self: Reading Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club" by Ben Xu (1994) and "The Politics of Lan- guage: Latina Writers in United States Literature and Curricula" by Nina M. Scott (1994), both published in an issue of MELUS on "Varieties of Ethnic Criticism".</page><page sequence="8">62 KRISTINA CHEW understanding of literary form into their work: ... [O]nly a few attempts have been made to investigate the relationship of American ethnicity to cultural media and literary forms. Readers are most curious about the content of ethnic writing. . . . Influenced by older approaches to ethnic survivals, they search for supposedly "authentic" literature and are less concerned with formal aspects, let alone syncre- tisms and stylistic innovations. Comparisons across times and traditions add new dimensions to ethnic literature, whose quality has so far been judged on the basis of how "authentically" it portrays the "ethnic experience." They show how ethnic literature is a part of Western literature as it re- uses traditional motifs, characters, and literary structures. Ethnic literature can then be reassessed as the latest incarnation of the classics, rather than as an altogether sui generis creation of completely new and original forms and themes, a claim expressed frequently by ethnic studies scholars ("new styles and fresh language," Kim 1982: 217; "a new kind of writer-the Asian American writer," Hongo 1993: xxix). The end result of studying a "classical-multicultural" curricu- lum is embodied in Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's Dictee. Originally published in 1982, Dictee is a narrative in fragments, combining images and text, and English, French, and Korean. Cha creates a personal hybrid Asian American mythology and a uniquely Asian American voice, the "diseuse" (the voice speaking Dictee), by combining Greek mythology and literature, Korean legend and his- tory, and Roman Catholic ritual. For instance, Dictee-which presents the experience of a Korean American woman, an immigrant from Korea-is structured around the nine Muses of Greek mythology. The Muses are goddesses of the various arts, as Cha lists them in a kind of "table of contents" for Dictee: CLIO CALLIOPE URANIA MELPOMENE ERATO ELITERE THALIA TERPSICHORE POLYMNIA HISTORY EPIC POETRY ASTRONOMY TRAGEDY LOVE POETRY LYRIC POETRY COMEDY CHORAL DANCE SACRED POETRY15 15 See Hesiod's Theogony 75-79 for his naming of the Muses.</page><page sequence="9">READING THE CLASSICS AND MULTICULTURAL LITERATURE 63 Dictee begins by evoking the "myth of Sappho" in a "fragment," a "quote." May I write words more naked than flesh, stronger than bone, more resilient than sinew, sensitive than nerve. Sappho An examination of Sappho's fragments reveals that no such lines exist in the poet's extant writing. Cha has made them up; in doing so, she invokes Sappho's authority as archetypal woman poet.16 What she writes sounds "more Sappho than Sappho" in her mention of writing words and her comparison of them to the body. The lines evoke the memory of Sappho: That she was dark-haired and short; had a daughter (Cleis), a husband, a lover (Phaedon), taught young girls who are addressed in her poems.17 In their reference to the body, Cha's lines do have something of the sound of Sappho, as in the third and fourth stanzas of poem 31 LP: "For when I look on you, how soon my speech / can make not one sound-/ my tongue splits and now slight / over skin fire skips under and / my two eyes see not one sliver of sight, / buzz my ears go."'18 Cha's "quote" suggests what she would have her own words in Dictee do, last beyond the body, its "flesh," "bone," "sinew," "nerves." Words are to endure, to be "stronger, more resilient," and yet they are "sensitive" and vulnerable, as if they cringed when touched. What Cha has written suggests the idea or myth of Sappho from the perspective of our late 20th-century knowledge of how long her words have endured, far longer than the endurance of the body. Sappho is the so-called "tenth muse," a mortal member of the group of nine daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne.19 As the "tenth," she is outside the group of nine Muses Cha uses to structure Dictee. Within the nine Muses Cha lists, one stands out, "Elitere," the muse of lyric poetry. The name sounds vaguely Greek (the muse that Elitere has replaced is usually Euterpe, muse of the flute), but no such muse 16 See Voigt 1971. From Catullus (c. 51) in the first century BC down to the present, poets have been writing versions of Sappho with varying faithfulness to her text. 17 P.

Consider also / Sappho of Lesbos, the tenth."</page><page sequence="10">64 KRISTINA CHEW can be found in lists of the Muses in classical texts. This muse is linked to Cha herself: The first syllable of Cha's name Theresa is echoed in "Elitere." "Theresa" is from the Greek for "reaper"; reaping is an activity associated with the harvesting of grain and so with the Greek goddess Demeter. Cha also combines the myths of Demeter and Persephone and of Orpheus and Eurydice with figures from Korean legend and history. The figures of mother and daughter, of poet and beloved, recur throughout Dictee. The narrator's journey back to her mother and her motherland of Korea after exile in a foreign land are paralleled in Persephone's abduction by Hades and reunion with Demeter, in Eurydice's death and Orpheus' unsuccessful descent to Hades to bring her back. The first page of Dictee is a reproduction of the walls of a mine where Koreans worked as slaves for the Japanese. Korean letters (Hangul) in a childish script that have been scratched in the wall read "mother, I want to see you / I am hungry / I want to go home."20 Here is the Underworld of death and darkness, where Persephone resides in exile from the earth and her waiting mother, and Eurydice remains forever apart from Orpheus. Persephone is referred to as Kore ("maiden") in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter; an identification between Persephone, abducted and raped by Hades, and Korea, occupied by the Japanese, is suggested (the connection is more clearly hinted at in Corde, "Korea" in French, which Cha frequently intermixes with English in Dictee). Cha further combines Persephone with Yu Guan Soon, a Korean patriot who was executed at the age of 17 for her nationalist activities against the Japanese, and also to the medieval French Christian martyr Joan of Arc (in "CLIO HISTORY") and to the late 19th-century St. Theresa of Lisieux, "the little flower" (in "ERATO LOVE POETRY"). The sep- aration of the daughter and the return to the mother are the subject of Dictee's second section, "CALLIOPE EPIC POETRY," which contains materials from the journals of Cha's own mother, Hyung Soo Huo (1982: 43-60). The mother journeys north to teach in a rural school. She is already distant from her native land, a Korean born in Manchuria, where the family moved to escape from the Japanese. In exile from home, the mother becomes sick and finds herself in a house where three women tempt her with plates of food: "You cannot identify its origin, but it captivates you completely. / / Their spirit takes your own" (52). She refuses to eat until she has returned to the land of the living back among her parents. But she 20 For an examination of the Korean and its imperfect grammar, see Kim 1991: 21.</page><page sequence="11">READING THE CLASSICS AND MULTICULTURAL LITERATURE 65 is changed after her experience in the borderland world of stillness, an experience comparable to the immigrant's re-entry to her native land after exile: "You return and you are not one of them, they treat you with indifference....... They ask you [sic] identity" (56). In the "ALLER/RETOUR" ("departure/return") passages in "ELITERE LYRIC POETRY, " reference is made to the Eleusinian mysteries, the ancient religious cult whose patron deity was Demeter and which aimed at the "rebirth" of the initiates. Cha alludes to the nine days Demeter wanders over the earth with flaming torches until she finds Hecate (130):21 Dead gods. Forgotten. Obsolete. Past Dust the exposed layer and reveal the unfathomable well beneath. Dead time. Dead gods. Sediment. Turned stone. Let the one who is diseuse dust breathe away the distance of the well. Let the one who is diseuse again sit upon the stone nine days and nine nights. Thus making stand again, Eleusis. The themes of mother and daughter, sickness, and a journey reappear in Dictee's ninth and last section, "POLYMNIA SACRED POETRY." On an errand to find a cure to heal her mother's sick- ness, a young girl sees a woman filling two jars with water from a well. The woman provides the weary child with water and the needed medicines (168-69).22 As in "CALLIOPE EPIC POETRY," "the mother" is sick-here, it is her child who brings back a cure, even as the diseuse is both mother and daughter, their roles inter- woven; she is both Eurydice and Orpheus, the beloved in exile and the poet whose song tells of their separation from each other-in Dictee, from the mother and the motherland, Korea. In Dictee, the elements of Western civilization and culture are recast in terms familiar to a Korean-American woman. In no small part due to its use of classical motifs and sources, Dictee has posed a challenge to scholars of Asian-American literature, who were initially "put off" by it, thinking that "Theresa Cha was talking not to me but rather to someone so remote from myself that I could not recognize 'him"' (Kim 1994: 3). To a classicist, the retelling of the myths and Cha's "reinventions" of the Muses and of Sappho suggest new interpretations of familiar material. What arises in Dictee is a 21 As related in Hornm.

Cha's Dictee is noteworthy for its literary innovation: its heavily punctuated, ungrammatical language, its mixture of media and languages, and its explicit and frequent uses of classical sources. It is "multicultural" and "diverse" in everyone's sense of the term, even as it acknowledges the influence that Western culture has had, and continues to have, on American society-and, in so doing, re- vises classical forms for its own purpose. "Some writers would even attempt to deny the adequacy of any existing language for their vision, while others developed an alliance between modernist forms and ethnic subject matter," notes Sollors (1986: 253) in his discus- sion of ethnic literature and modernism. The creation of literary forms along with the use of the classics is also powerfully at work in Toni Morrison's novel Beloved. The "beloved" of the title is the ghost of a baby girl who mysteriously haunts 124, the house of her mother Sethe and sister Denver, former slaves from Sweet Home, Kentucky. Two other children, Buglar and Howard, have long since run away and mother and daughter live a quiet, grey existence until Paul D, also once of Sweet Home, appears and challenges the baby's ghost. Not long after, a woman who calls herself Beloved is found in front of 124. Could she be Sethe's baby, returned from the dead and grown up? A tug of war for Sethe's love erupts between Paul D and the "sisters," Denver and Beloved. It is a conflict between the pull of memory and that of the present. Beloved's narrative itself moves fluidly back and forth between the past and the present, so that the former becomes a very real presence in the latter, just as the baby's ghost had haunted Sethe and Denver. In a series of monologues in the voices of Sethe, Denver, and Beloved, the text breaks away from its narrative and literally, lyrically breaks down; in the fourth monologue, the voices of the three women become one (Morrison 1988: 216): Beloved You are my sister You are my daughter You are my face; you are me I have found you again; you have come back to me You are my Beloved You are mine</page><page sequence="13">READING THE CLASSICS AND MULTICULTURAL LITERATURE 67 You are mine You are mine It is not until the novel is half-over that we learn the reason for the haunting of 124, a deed recalling the crime of Medea. Sethe had cut the throats of her four children to save them from capture by their former overseer, the schoolteacher, for escaping from Sweet Home. This is what he sees when he arrives in Cincinnati to reclaim them (149): Inside, two boys bled in the sawdust and dirt at the feet of a nigger woman holding a blood-soaked child to her chest with one hand and an infant by the heels in the other. She did not look at them; she simply swung the baby towards the wall planks, missed and tired to connect a second time, when out of nowhere-in the ticking time the men spent staring at what there was to stare at-the old nigger boy, still mewing, ran through the door behind them and snatched the baby from the arch of its mother's swing. Right off it was clear, to schoolteacher especially, that there was nothing to claim. The three (now four-because she'd had the one coming when she cut) pickanninnies they had hoped were alive and well enough to take back to Kentucky, take back and raise properly to do the work Sweet Home desperately needed, were not. The murder of her own children is sickeningly necessary for Sethe. Beloved highlights the desperate nature of Medea's murder of her children and humanizes her even more than Euripides does in his tragedy. We are reminded that Medea is not simply a cold-hearted sorceress, but a mother desperate with love-to the point that, in Beloved, Sethe can believe the woman Beloved is the child she herself had killed. Aside from these narrative comparisons between Beloved and Medea, a joint study of both works can lead us to con- sider the nature and meaning of tragedy as a Greek literary genre with its features of hubris, peripeteia, catharsis, etc., and more generally. "Tragedy," one sees, is perhaps too suitable a genre and word to describe the African-American experience of slavery in the United States. Rita Dove's play The Darker Face of the Earth relocates the tragedy of Oedipus on a plantation in antebellum South Carolina. The central horror of Oedipus' fate as depicted in Sophocles' Oedipus Tyrranos- patricide and incest with his mother-are recast within the structure of sexual relations between the white plantation owners and their black slaves. Dove's Oedipus, Augustus Newcastle, is the ille- gitimate son of Amalia Jennings, the independent-minded mistress of the plantation, and a slave, Hector. Sent away at birth</page><page sequence="14">68 KRISTINA CHEW in a basket into which Louis, Amalia's husband, slips a pair of his spurs, Augustus is bought by Amalia after being raised by a generous sea captain. He and Amalia become lovers, perhaps, the slaves spec- ulate, as the mistress's way to control the young slave, who is known for his rebellious spirit against his masters. The seer Tiresias is cast as Scylla, a slave with conjuring powers, who alone seems to know who Augustus really is (Dove 1994: 61-2): "Oh, you may dance now, / but you will fall. / The evil inside you / will send you to your knees / and you will crawl, / crawl in front of us all!" Mean- while, Augustus becomes involved in a movement to start a slave revolt. The play ends with the slaves' successful uprising, at the very moment when Augustus' true parentage is revealed to him by Amalia (137-38): AMALIA. So you want to know, do you? You want to know your mother? I have one more story for you- and when I have finished you will wish you had never set your man's foot on this plantation. Yes, Louis, did take to slave girls; ask any of them. Diana has his eyes. But you- AUGUSTUS.Diana my sister? AMALIA. -you are not his son! Hector knew; that's why he went to the swamp. And I never touched him again. (AUGUSTUS looks slowly, desperately at her.) Now do you understand? I-am-your-mother! Dove transfers the irony of Oedipus' situation to that of the slave Augustus, to illustrate the unavoidably convoluted relations be- tween blacks and whites, slaves and masters. The horrors of patricide (Augustus kills Louis without knowing his true identity) and of incest are shown as almost inevitable in such a world, in which an individual's fate depends not only on his and her acts, but on the "accident" of birth.</page><page sequence="15">READING THE CLASSICS AND MULTICULTURAL LITERATURE 69 In addition to the classical and multicultural registers of Dictee, Beloved, and The Darker Face of the Earth, the following are suggestions for a course or courses that could be titled "The Classical Tradition in 20th-century Multicultural Literature." Epic poetry, with its journeys, heroes, and the grand scale of its narrative, contains much common ground with ethnic literature. Sollors (1986: 238) notes that the epic "is generally associated with ethnogenesis, the emergence of a people, and can therefore seemingly be appropriated transna- tionally by all peoples." Virgil's Aeneid can be read as a model for the "American epic," for the journey to the western "frontier," as depicted in Maxine Hong Kingston's telling of the journey West to America from China in China Men and Tripmaster Monkey: His Fake Book. "The Aeneid," Sollors says further (1986: 239), "lent itself to a sanctioning of the further transporting west of empires"; he men- tions the Historia de la Nueva Mexico (1610) by Gaspar Perez de Villagra as an "ambitious and consciously Vergilian epic." Epic elements can also be found in the novels of Rudolfo A. Anaya, including Bless Me, Ultima (Taylor 1994). Derek Walcott's Omeros is itself an epic poem, in which the Jamaican fisherman Achille and Hector the transport driver long for Helen, a some time maid in the house of the retired Major Plunkett, and the limping Philoctecte tends to his rows of yams. To complete the student's investigation of epic poetry, Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Apollonius Rhodius' Argonautica, and Lucan's Pharsalia could also be read. Milman Parry's studies of the oral composition and transmission of poetry could be discussed along with the notion of "talk-story" in King- ston's work, especially in her first book, The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts. Gender and sexuality can be readily investigated by studying a combination of classical and contemporary texts. Reading classical texts from this perspective is something of an antidote to right- wing defenses of the virtues taught by the classics, as can be seen in the following: depictions of homosexuality (Achilles and Patroclus in the Iliad, Sappho's lyrics to women and girls, Catullus' love poems to Iuventus); the construction of gender (the effeminate Bacchus of Euripides' Bacchae; Ovid's Heroides, letters of mythological women to their husbands and lovers); and incest and internecine violence (Aeschylus' Oresteia, Sophocles' Oedipus plays), not to mention the frank sexual and scatological language of Aristophanes' comedies (such as in the Birds and Lysistrata). The humor, carnivalesque tone, fantastic plots, and political critique in Aristophanes' plays are matched in Jessica Hagedorn's novel Dogeaters, which depicts Marcos-</page><page sequence="16">70 KRISTINA CHEW era Philippines through the pop-culture infested lives of a school girl, Rio, the junky Joey Sands, movie stars, and a long list of many others. Aristophanes' Thesmophoriazusae, in which Euripides per- suades Mnesilochus to dress up as a woman and join the women's assembly, and Euripides' Bacchae, when Bacchus dresses Pentheus up as a woman, can be read along with David Henry Hwang's M. Butterfly, a Broadway play about a French diplomat who falls in love with a Chinese opera singer, whom he (mistakenly) believes to be a woman. Cristina Garcia's Dreaming in Cuban portrays the generations of women in a family divided by politics (the Cuban revolution), culture and geography; the ensuing exploits and trage- dies of the characters can be compared to those of Antigone in Sophocles' Antigone and Oedipus at Colonus, and of Klytemnestra, Electra, and Orestes in the Oresteia. Incest haunts Morrison's first novel The Bluest Eye, while the friendship of Sula Peace and Nel Wright in Sula can be compared to the intimacies among women suggested in Sappho's poetry. Moreover, current scholarly work on orientalism and postco- lonialism suggests new interpretations for the portrayal of women in classical literature, such as Aeschylus' Cassandra in Agamemnon and Virgil's Dido, and other foreign-especially Eastern-women, from Medea to Cleopatra. Edward Said (1978: 56-57) in Orientalism, a seminal work in the field of postcolonialism, describes the Euro- pean creation of Asia as the opposite of itself, a dangerous and feminized culture, in Aeschylus' Persians and Euripides' Bacchae: "Europe is powerful and articulate; Asia is defeated and distant. Aeschylus represents Asia, makes her speak in the person of the aged Persian queen, Xerxes' mother." The West's response to the exotic and different East was, argues Said, to remake Asia as its other, opposite of what it would perceive itself to be, rather than attempting to understand the East on its own terms. Examination of Cassandra and Dido from these perspectives reveals ambivalent, even sympathetic, attitudes among the Greeks and Romans for the lands they conquered. The chorus of old men in the Agamemnon, while disbelieving Cassandra's raving prophecies of doom, treats her kindly; numerous scholars have puzzled over the pathos of Virgil's presentation of Dido, while Aeneas appears cruel and heartless in deserting her. Mythology can also serve as an organizing theme for a course of classics and multicultural literature. In addition to the texts and the many references to mythology I have already mentioned, Ovid's Metamorphoses could be used as the focal text for such a course. In</page><page sequence="17">READING THE CLASSICS AND MULTICULTURAL LITERATURE 71 nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas / corpora, "my mind impels me to speak of forms changed into new bodies," the poem begins. Contemporary ethnic writers' versions of the various myths could be read along with Ovid's poem, such as Cha's use of the myth of Demeter and Persephone in Dictee; Dove also incorporates this myth into her poems in Mother Love ("Persephone Falling," "Persephone in Hell," "Wiederkehr," "The Bistro Styx"). Further, the theme of the changing of one being into another-be it daphne tree, halcyon, or stag-in the Metamorphoses as a whole speaks to the experience of belonging to more than one culture, of hybridity and hyphen- ation, that is so often the subject of ethnic literature. Throughout Ovid's poem, both an awed fascination with change and the new and also sorrow for what is lost in the change-Daphne for the laurel, Niobe into stone-are expressed. These emotions are part of the ethnic American's dilemma of whether to assimilate into "mainstream American" or to retain a distinct "ethnic" and so foreign identity, to stay an immigrant stranger in the land one calls home. The compelling awe steeped in grief over this dilemma appears in the Indonesian-born poet Li-Young Lee's writing on the seed, a symbol for the displaced ethnic, in his The Winged Seed: A Remembrance. Note how the seed and the writing change, evolving, regenerating into ever-new forms (1995: 36): I hold in my left hand a morning glory seed, a hard, wedge-shaped, odor- less stone the size of a tear. My love, what is a seed? Is it its flower? Is it the leaves it utters? Is it a house? Where is the honey hidden, in which room? Where is the owner? How much room is a flower to a bee? Who could tenant a house so narrow as a seed? Only the last among us could live there. Its weight is imperceptible. Lighter than the flower, it is where the flower closes at evening. Yet, in it may be growing the flower that will overthrow all governments of crows or senators. This seed comes to divide me from all I thought I knew. This seed revises all existing bound- aries to proclaim the dimensions of an ungrasped hour. This seed carries news of a new continent and our first citizenship, and I hold it. The same mixture of extreme attraction to the new culture of America and the bond of the "old world" culture of one's parents and ancestors is the constant subject of the Mexican-American Richard Rodriguez's autobiography Hunger of Memory: The Education of Richard Rodriguez. The book begins with Rodriguez's entrance into the American educational system with only fifty words of English and culminates with his decision to leave academia and the study of Renaissance literature, when on the verge of being offered a number of academic positions, because (he realizes) of affirmative</page><page sequence="18">72 KRISTINA CHEW action (1982: 167-72). Rodriguez is an opponent of bilingual instruc- tion in schools; to him, English and Spanish express two different worlds (26-28): [The bilingualists] do not realize that while one suffers a diminished sense of private individuality by becoming assimilated into public society, such assimilation makes possible the achievement of public individuality. The bilingualists insist that a student should be reminded of his dif- ference from others in mass society, his heritage. But they equate mere separateness with individuality. The fact is that only in private-with intimates-is separateness from the crowd a prerequisite for individuality. ... In public, by contrast, full individuality is achieved, paradoxically, by those who are able to consider themselves members of the crowd. Thus it happened for me: Only when I was able to think of myself as an American, no longer an alien in gringo society, could I seek the rights and opportunities necessary for full public individuality. The social and political advantages I enjoy as a man result from the day that I came to believe that my name, indeed, is Rich-heard Road-ree-guess.... If I rehearse here the changes in my private life after my Americanization, it is finally to emphasize the public gain.... Once I learned public language, it would never again be easy for me to hear intimate family voices. More and more of my day was spent hearing words. Rodriguez's autobiography documents a reconciliation between the ethnic in exile and American, Western culture similar to that of Cha's Dictee. (Hunger of Memory and Dictee were actually published in the same year, 1982.) It is just such a reconciliation between classics and ethnic studies that I have tried to suggest in this essay. Multi- cultural literature is one of the newest kinds of writings, and much has yet to be written. By reading it we can see the latest changes, the newest incarnations, of the classics, metamorphosizing into something new that still partakes of the same old form at its core. Like Dictee, Hunger of Memory is about the search for a voice by an individual who is not altogether sure of which accent she or he should speak in. Both authors understand that something must be sacrificed for the creation of this new, public voice that can speak to an audience beyond the comforting center of the family and the familiar. Sometimes, in a society in which identities and ethnic, religious, and political allegiances have become overscrutinized, it is only by recourse to what seems most strange and other that one can hear what one needs to. This is what Rodriguez found in studying Renaissance lyric poetry, and is why Cha centers Dictee around the Greek muses and steps into the figure of Sappho. Some of my suggestions for a classical-multicultural curriculum were part of the syllabus for a course I taught at Williams College</page><page sequence="19">READING THE CLASSICS AND MULTICULTURAL LITERATURE 73 in the spring of 1995 on the classics and Asian American literature, which was entitled "Classics West, East, American." The course description read: This course will undertake a project of reading and relearning "classical" works of the Western literary tradition in order to question and refocus notions of what is a "Great Book," a "classic," a "canon." We will read works from Greek and Latin literature alongside Asian American texts. By reading such a current, up-and-coming writing as Asian American literature in close coordination with classical works, we will seek to evaluate anew "familiar" texts like Homer's Odyssey and Virgil's Aeneid. This comparative reading across literary and cultural traditions located at vast differences of time and space will also enable us to explore current notions of what is Asian American literature-and, indeed, what is an "ethnic" or a "national" literature-as we investigate Asian American literature's allegiance to and challenge of the Western literary tradition: To what extent is it American and Asian and Asian American, a product of Western Civilization that is rooted also in the East, in Asia? We will address such subjects as multiculturalism, canon and curriculum forma- tion, and issues of postcolonialism and the aftereffects of imperialism. The course was cross-listed in Classics, Literary Studies, and Asian Studies and drew a roster of predominantly Asian American students. (This is not unusual for ethnic studies courses, which are tacitly assumed to provide a personal experience in addition to, if not even more than, an intellectual one.) I organized the syllabus primarily according to genre; the students read, for example, Aeschylus' Oresteia, and then two plays, Frank Chin's "Year of the Dragon" and David Henry Hwang's "Family Devotions." In retro- spect, I would have reorganized the syllabus so that the first half of the course was spent reading either classical or Asian American literature, while the second half would be devoted to the other literature. Many of the students had no background in classical literature, or only a minimal one from high school (Williams College does not have a required "Great Books" course). The instructor of a classical-multicultural course must realize that students are increasingly introduced to multicultural and women's literature at the secondary school level, and thus may well not have a well- formed notion as to what the classics really are. A course like "Classics West, East, American," can serve as a different kind of introduc- tion to Western literature, including some of its early texts and some of its newest ones.23 23 Films on the ancient world and classical myths (Ben Hur, Spartacus, Jean</page><page sequence="20">74 KRISTINA CHEW Finally, it would be of interest to read Martin Bernal's Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization in a course on classical and multicultural literature. Bernal's suggestion that the origins of the ancient world stem from "the Levantine, on the periph- ery of the Egyptian and Semitic cultural area" (1987: 1) has been highly controversial among classicists, archaeologists, and other scholars of the ancient world.24 A special issue of Arethusa, "The Challenge of Black Athena" (Fall 1989) and a volume edited by Mary R. Lefkowitz and Guy MacLean Rogers, Black Athena Revisited, have documented the reactions to Bernal's work among classicists. From the lens of ethnic studies, Black Athena can be seen as another work asserting the unnoticed and deep "diversity" of ancient society by a scholar who is quite conscious of not being a professional classicist, whose earlier scholarly work was on modern Chinese history (Bernal 1987: xii-xiii). Bernal's theory of the Egyptian, "Afroasiatic" origins of the Greeks, and so of Western civilization, has been alarming because of the questionable nature of his scholarly methods (see, for example, Lefkowitz 1996: 12 ff.; Baines 1996; Jasanoff and Nussbaum 1996; Vermeule 1996; Hall 1996; Rogers 1996), and also because of the ready championing of such a claim by Afrocentrists (Lefkowitz 1996: 6; Snowden 1996: 113). The up- roar over Bernal's work also gets to the heart of why the notion of "multiculturalism," understood as the call by "ethnic" or "minority groups" for "inclusion in the mainstream," raises eyebrows among classicists, especially when the "multiculturalists" hold such ex- treme positions as the Afrocentrists. Black Athena alerts us to the tendency to see the Greeks, and the Romans too, as directly linked to ourselves and as our direct cultural ancestors (Palter 1996: 377), when they may in fact be more foreign to us than the characters and authors of multicultural literature, written in and for our own time.25 Reading Black Athena in the context of classical and multi- Cocteau's Orphee, My Fair Lady) could also be used in a course on classics and mul- ticulturalism. Two articles in Classical Journal discuss the ancient world and film and provide lists of films on classical subjects and containing classical references: Solomon 1996, who provides an extensive list of films since 1963 drawing on the ancient world, and Clauss 1996, who outlines a course on mythology using film. 24 As Bernal himself (1991: xvi; see also Bernal 1987: 2) is quite aware: "The publication of Volume I of Black Athena transformed my life," he states in the Preface and Acknowledgements to Volume II. 25 Lefkowitz (1996: 21) notes that subscribers to Bernal's theories are in danger of simply "claiming Greek history as their own" rather than "[learning] about real Africa and its own achievements and civilizations."</page><page sequence="21">READING THE CLASSICS AND MULTICULTURAL LITERATURE 75 cultural literature, students can be reminded of the extent to which ancient cultures mixed with and influenced each other, and also challenged to question their assumptions about "Western civiliza- tion" and the inappropriateness and naivete of the label of "dead white male Europeans."26 My proposal for teaching the classics and multicultural literature together is meant to encourage the study of literature across times and cultures together. Though I have suggested topics (the epic, gender, etc.) around which to organize such a course, it is my hope that the main business to be carried on in the course would be read- ing the books and thinking about what makes them literature. What aesthetic qualities, what traits of form and style, what techniques for crafting narrative and molding characters, what use and play of language, are at work in these texts? In an age of "multiculturalism" and "tolerance," classics is as necessary as ever, if only to remind us of what the motto e pluribus unum really means and of why we need to remember that meaning. "Out of many one": The phrase denotes the fifty different states of this country united into one, and describes too the "melting pot" and "rainbow" of peoples who have emigrated to America. "Pythagoras means by friendship that one arises out of more than one," says Cicero in De officiis 1.17.56 (Pythagoras vult in amicitia ut unus fiat ex pluribus). Friendship, amicitia, is no poor place to found a project of reading classical and multicultural literature together. We must all relearn an open- spiritedness to all and any texts and traditions, regardless of "what" the author is. The ancients cannot speak for their writings, and the same shall be the fate of today's writers of ethnic literature. It is the fate of any writer, but the literature remains if we can keep on reading. It is true that every day there are more and more books to read: "Who reads must choose," writes Harold Bloom (1994: 15) in "An Elegy for the Canon," "since there is literally not enough time to read everything, even if one does nothing but read." In the friend- ship of the classics and multicultural literature I envision-and here I use "classics" in its more general sense, to denote those major literary works of a culture, Dante and Li Po's poetry, the Ramayana and the Mabinogion-I hope that we can forge a renewed feeling 26 See especially Snowden 1996: 116 on how the Greeks and Romans described the physical appearance, and in particular the skin color, of the inhabitants of Africa, and on Bernal's incorrect equation of "black," "Egyptian," and "African." 27 On the origins of the motto e pluribus unum, see Reinhold 1984: 247, n. 87. Other versions of the phrase occur in Aristotle, Politics 1.5.3; Horace, Epistles 2.2.212 (de pluribus una); Augustine, Confessions 4.8 (ex pluribus unum).</page><page sequence="22">76 KRISTINA CHEW for literature and what it teaches us. I hope that we can learn how to choose the books for our shelves and for our students by reading, by choosing to read books that we may later set aside or that we may save, and by not fearing that a book by a strange name may have more to teach us than our most beloved classics, than Plato and Virgil. To see similarity in the most different and unrelated of things requires the ability to compare, to posit that there is something similar between unlike entities. That this is a difficult task which does not come naturally to us was noted by the sixth-century B.C. philosopher Xenophanes (frags. 16 &amp; 15): Ai0ion~ig ze [EO-' (YgErEpoig] gotlbog ELoav&amp;; TE OppIKE te yXIuKoi); KIt nuppog; [quXot n~,ooit]. The Ethiopians say their gods are snub-nosed and black, and the Thracians, that theirs have light-blue eyes and flame-red hair. iX'nno eiv ipx; nnov r36e; [i o t 'OUi ivtE i1 Yphxw~ x pEaPY K(XI EPYpXr teXeLv wtep iv8pe;, bo16'p8' o6v TCEp aitOi ECiax EiXov [KKtl]. But if oxen and horses or lions had hands, or could draw with their hands and do works as men do, horses would draw their gods' forms like horses and oxen like oxen, and their bodies they would make just such as each themselves had. Each ethnic group (Ethiopians or Thracians) or species of animal can only imagine and remake the world in the image of itself. Xenophanes' fragments criticize belief in the anthropomorphism of the gods (Kirk 1983: 169). But the presocratic philosopher's words also address the assumption that a work of multicultural, ethnic literature is only as authentically "ethnic" as its author is: Asian American literature must be written by Asian-American people, African-American literature by African American people, etc. Con- troversy and outrage arise when it is discovered that an ethnic text was written by a "non-ethnic" (i.e. white) author, as Henry Louis Gates Jr. (1991) describes in "'Authenticity,' or the Lesson of Little Tree." The "Native American" autobiography The Education of Little Tree was praised as a "masterpiece... that captured the unique vision of Native American culture," until it was discovered that the book's author was Asa Earl Carter, a member of the Ku Klux</page><page sequence="23">READING THE CLASSICS AND MULTICULTURAL LITERATURE 77 Klan and the author of Alabama governor George Wallace's speech calling for "Segregation now ... Segregation tomorrow ... Segre- gation forever." At the same time, literary portrayals of ethnic groups by "non-ethnic" writers are scrutinized for "exoticizing" their subjects, though stereotypical portrayals of "non-ethnics" by ethnic writers do not necessarily receive such analysis. One could critique Virgil for his "orientalizing" depiction of Dido and Ovid for "appropriating" the female voice in the Heroides-and do clas- sicists then cry out against Cha's Dictee for her "misuse" of Sappho and the Muses? How can we read, understand and learn from literature, if all that reading means is to read an experience we already know, to see ourselves reflected directly back from the text as in a mirror? Is it only in such literality, such a tautological comparison, that we are able to see ourselves in a literary work? "Multiculturalism" and "diversity," then, are not about "difference," but enforce a vision of sameness, urging us to look inward only and to project that image upon the world as the right one simply because it is familiar. This is indeed the anthropomorphism that humans apply to the gods in Xenophanes' fragment. Therefore, the second fragment continues, we cannot expect otherwise from animals, horses and lions-and how would we be perceived in their universe of four-legged beasts with hooves? Xenophanes also says in the fragment that is this essay's epi- graph (fragment 38): "If god had not created yellow honey, much sweeter they would say were figs." Without honey, figs would be our criterion for sweetness. Without Homer, Virgil's Aeneid would be Rome's national epic, but could we understand how it comes to be a part of and to create the classical tradition? Would we be able to judge the "sweetness" of Virgil's poetry without Homer's Iliad and Odyssey? Could we speak of epics and odysseys at all? Even if we do not like honey and much prefer figs, we cannot deny the existence of the honey and its intensely sweeter quality. We can also examine the different kinds of sweetness each offers; we can even mix the two together to make a new and strange flavor for us to taste and to compare with the original honey and figs. Before we decide which we like best, we will need to sample many other honeys-clover, heather, chestnut-and many kinds of figs- black missions, pale kadotas, rosy Adriatics. What we have discov- ered in the experiment is a new sweetness that we could not have imagined before. In reading classical and multicultural literature together, it is literature that is the sweetness that makes possible the comparison-the mixing. The texts are our honey and our</page><page sequence="24">78 KRISTINA CHEW figs. The taste of this combination awaits our willingness to try them together.
