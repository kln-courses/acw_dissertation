<plain_text><page sequence="1">B Y COMPARI S O N with the immense fame enjoyed by the painters, sculptors, and architects of the Renaissance, relatively little is known of their contemporaries in the applied and decorative arts. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the enormous production of pictures and statues and buildings was paralleled by a similar burst of creative energy in the fashioning of textiles, ceramics, glass, and all kinds of metalwork; but the artisans who worked with such skill and talent in these fields all too often go unsung- their handiwork unsigned, their names unrecorded. As a result, the references to such craftsmen that do appear in contemporary docu- ments are all the more valuable in establishing their identity and in recognizing their work. The chief source of information, for example, about one of the great armorers of the sixteenth century, whose distinctive creations grace several museums in the world, is a few sentences in an obscure book published in I 595, La Nobzlta di Mzlano, collected biographies of the locally illustrious by one Paolo Morigia. In it he describes a family of armorers named Piccinino: the father, Antonio, and one son, Federigo, were blade- smiths; a younger son, Lucio, was an armorer who, said Morigia, "in his ornamentation of iron in relief with figures, animals, and grotesque masks, etc., and likewise in his damascene work, produced masterpieces that are the most choice and precious." Lucio Piccinino would nonetheless be little more than a tantalizing name, were it not for the further, fortuitous remark by Morigia that among the notable pieces executed by him was "armor of great value for His Grace Alessandro Farnese, duke of Parma." With this clue and Morigia's fleeting description of Piccinino's style it has been possible to identify with certainty this suit (Figure 2), which once belonged to one of the most notable soldiers of the time. It is now in the Waffensammlung in Vienna; richly embassed and damascened, and so elaborately decorated that the duke could have had no other like it, this harness can only be the one he presented in I579 to Archduke Ferdinand of the Tyrol, who placed it in his collection of the armor of famous personages in Castle Ambras. The most important of these pieces, including the Farnese armor, were trans- ferred to Vienna in I806, and there they still remain.

Among these are a half-suit once belonging to Alfonso II, duke of Ferrara, and now in the Wallace Col- lection in London; another, that once belonged to Prince Philip (later Philip III) of Spain, in the Royal Armory of Madrid; a breastplate for a youth, in the Victoria and Albert Mu- seum; and a cuirass in the Louvre. At least two works by Piccinino, amply illustrating his diverse talents, are in the Metropolitan: a pair of gauntlets (Figures I3 and I9) from Prince Philip's suit, and a half-suit (Figure I) that belonged to Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, duke of Alba. Piccinino's masterpieces are representative of the last great development in the art of making body armor: the highly ornamented "dress" or "parade" harnesses that were a special product of the Renaissance. About the turn of the sixteenth century an impor- tant change occurred in the armorer's craft. Through most of the fifteenth century the principal emphasis had been upon structural strength and simplicity of contour, with form dependent upon defensive function even when the piece was designed essentially for display. Such Gothic armor was often extensively dec- orated, but with paint or with embroidered cloth or leather coverings that did not affect the form of the metal. The revival of classical art and thought, however, brought with it an interest in every aspect of antique culture, including armor - particularly the splendid decorative armor, described in ancient litera- tllre and shown in ancient sculpture, worn by victorious generals in triumphal processions. This interest did not manifest itself immedi- ately in actual armor; it was first expressed in the vigorous though often fanciful adapta- tions that appeared in paintings, sculpture, and prints (Figure 3). Not until the end of the fifteenth century did the armorers begin to follow where these artists had led, and to 2. Afrmor of Aflessandro Farnese, duke of Parma, by Lucio Piccinino. Afbout I570. Wafensammlung, Vienna</page><page sequence="5">create a style in which the surface of the metal itself provided the medium for complex orna- mentation. This new style required a new kind of craftsmanship, in which the talents of several artisans were required, among them the ar- morer, to fashion the contours of the piece, the ornament designer, to plan the pattern of decoration, and the goldsmith, to execute the design. Renaissance goldsmiths were not sim- ply craftsmen in precious metal; their trade was considared the epitome of all the arts of metalwork, for it necessitated a knowledge of painting, sculpture, and every kind of design. The goldsmith was expected to fulfill any commission in fine metalwork; he modeled and cast medals, carved sword mounts, and embossed armor- just as he would fashion a necklace or chalice -and worked in gold, sil- ver, copper, or iron with equal facility. Fur- thermore, Renaissance goldsmiths were closely allied with artists in other fields, and their shops were often the training grounds for painters, sculptors, and printmakers, among them Ghiberti, Donatello, Pollaiuolo, Verroc- chio, and Botticelli. These pupils frequently continued to produce metalwork or metal- work designs after completing their appren- ticeship. Pollaiuolo, for instance, in addition to painting, ran a thriving establishment in Florence that produced prints and metalwork of various kinds (one of his commissions was for a silver helmet presented by the city to the Duke of Urbino in I472). To show his mastery of both crafts, Francesco Raibolini, generally known as Francia, signed some of his paintings "Francia Aurifex," and his metal- work"Francia Pictor." It was therefore natural that as the art of armor developed from the shaping of contour to the embellishment of surface, the functions of armorer and goldsmith should blend. In many cases this was a matter of collaboration, for the different crafts involved were com- plex, difficult, and time-consuming. It could well take a year to make a complete suit of decorated armor, even when several masters were cooperating. Sometimes one man would have the ability to carry out every aspect of the job, such as the Mantuan Giorgio Ghisi, who was a painter, draughtsman, engraver, armorer, embosser, and damascener all in one. A parade shield in the British Museum bears his signature, and his prints are known to have inspired other works in armor. Even in the case of Piccinino, who, it seems certain, de- pended upon other artists for designs and the execution of details, the work is so consistent and individual in style that his personal super- vision at every stage cannot be doubted. The Piccinino pieces in the Museum all come from collections in Spain, and it is more than coincidence that so much of the fine ornamental armor of the sixteenth century was in Spanish hands. The Spanish royalty and nobility were about the best customers the armorers of this period had; their taste for the pomp and pageantry of formal proces- sions was well-nigh insatiable, and they squan- dered much of their Mexican and Peruvian gold on ceremonial dress -of which fancy ar- mor was the most elaborate and costly form. In reality, inflation and the drain of disastrous warfare kept Spain constantly impoverished, and the extravagance of ceremony was a lux- ury the country could ill afford. This, how- ever, did not prevent kings, nobles, and cities alike from vying with each other in making pageants and state entries as magnificent as possible, or from presenting distinguished lead- ers with specially commissioned helmets and shields on important occasions. The Spaniards were particularly fond of the richly sculp- tured, classically inspired armor produced in the Lombard provinces of northern Italy, of which Brescia and Milan were the chief cen- ters. Milan was in fact a political dependency of Spain for much of the sixteenth century, and exerted a good deal of influence on Span- ish culture through trade, gifts, and the ex- change of artisans. At any rate, the period of greatest brilliance in north Italian armor coin- cided almost exactly with the period of Spain's greatest power, and declined with the waning of Spain's hegemony toward the end of the sixteenth century. The armor of the Duke of Alba (Figure I) represents the ornate Milanese style at its 3. St. George, by Carlo Crivelli (active by I457 - after I495), Italian (Venice).

The original owner was one of the most famous soldiers of his day-one of the two really able generals who fought for Spain in its lamentable wars against the rebellious Netherlands (the other, incidentally, was the Duke of Parma). The suit remained in the family for almost three hundred years, and then was rescued from neglect by the famous American collector William H. Riggs, who provided an oral account of its acquisition when he gave it to the Museum in I9I3. Sometime between I 855 and I 865 he had been shown pieces of it, in a sad state of disrepair, during one of his visits to the Alba palace of Liria in Madrid. There was a family tradition that it had been damaged in a fire, although it is more likely that it was simply stored away in a trunk, wrapped in cloths that absorbed moisture and allowed the slower but no less destructive oxidation of rust to eat into its surface. Mr. Riggs nevertheless recognized the quality of the work even from these dismem- bered and disintegrating fragments, and know- ing of his host's interest in Spanish cup-hilted rapiers, he suggested a trade: attractive rapiers from his own collection in exchange for the damaged armor. These details are recorded in a letter of I925 from the Museum's curator Bashford Dean to the descendant of the duke who made the trade. The continuation of the account de- serves quotation in full: "In time the valet [of Mr. Riggs] appeared with a series of cham- pagne baskets packed with rapiers. These were 262</page><page sequence="8">O P P O S I T E : 5. Back of the left pauldron (shoulder defense) of the AMlba armor. Width as shown I2 inches 6.

The fine horse and the bunch of cup-hilted rapiers pro- duced such a favorable constellation, that the exchange was made then and there, Mr. Riggs using the same champagne baskets in which to carry the embossed armor out of the palace. I have no doubt that many of the cup-hilted rapiers which are now in your great hall there, and which I remember so pleasantly seeing on my early visit with you, are doubtless part of this plunder." Cleaning and repair have helped restore 263</page><page sequence="9">8. Lion mast on the left elbow of the Alba armor. Height 2 inches some of the original magnificence of this suit, and aside from a few restorations the whole ensemble is original. This is of no little sig- nificance, since so many supposed suits are "composed" (to use the professional euphe- mism) from miscellaneous elements. Further- more, the whole harness was originally so en- riched with decoration that what remains gives substantial evidence of its maker's skill and working methods. Every element-even in areas that would ordinarily be covered up by the overlapping of the plates - is decorated with luxuriant de- signs in relief, drawn from the classical reperto- ry (Frontispiece and Figures 4, 5, 7, 8, IO, and I2). These feature Medusas, satyrs, sphinxes, putti, bound captives, anthropomorphic lion masks, and figures of Mars and Victory-all derived, or rather adapted, from antique art, for both the choice and execution of these motifs betray a fascination for the grotesque that is characteristic of the mannerist phase of the Renaissance. The organization of these decorations is by no means haphazard; they are for the most part arranged in symmetrical, vertical bands, joined by festoons of fruit or by strapwork from which masks and bunches of fruit are suspended (Figure 4). This sys- tematic arrangement, its formality giving clar- ity and additional emphasis to the fanciful motifs, is so similar to that on the Farnese armor and other works attributed to Piccinino that there is virtually no chance of coinci- dence. Together with the motifs themselves, and the manner of using raised beads of silver to accentuate the framing strapwork (Frontis- piece), it can almost be considered a signature of Piccinino's work. This family resemblance becomes particu- larly clear when one compares an arm defense 9. Design for the left arm defense of the Farnese armor. Kunsthis- torisches Museum, Vienna</page><page sequence="10">and pauldron (shoulder defense) of the Alba armor (Figures 5, 7, 8, and IO) with drawings for the same elements of the Farnese armor (Figures 6 and 9), which still exist and are now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The Alba pieces are, as it were, variations upon the theme of the Farnese designs, with certain modifications in the subjects used but a remarkable homogeneity in the overall scheme. These drawings were an intermediate step in planning the decoration. It is probable that Piccinino himself did not conceive the basic motifs; like many of the armorers of the time he seems to have obtained them chiefly from prints - especially the ubiquitous en- gravings of Marcantonio Raimondi and his numerous followers (Figure I I), who provided all Europe with the decorative vocabulary of the Renaissance. But the choice, combination, and placement of these motifs were probably carried out by Piccinino or a draughtsman under his supervision, and mapped out on drawings from which the actual work was done. Once the elements were shaped, and the decorative scheme decided, the embossing of the relief was begun. The art of embossing -raising ornaments upon a metal plate by hammering from beneath-was known from antiquity, but was raised to new standards by Renaissance metalworkers. In this technique, so. Left arm defense of the Aflba ar- mor. Length as shown 20 inches 265</page><page sequence="11">the metal is treated as a plastic substance to be shaped to the desired form; iron and even steel are far from being the rigid, unyielding materials they seem, for given suicient pres- sure or tension they may be stretched or molded almost indefinitely. To emboss armor, the design was first drawn on the face of the element, and the essential outlines were ham- mered lightly with a blunt punch so they would show on the back. The plate was em- bedded face down in a yielding medium such as asphalt, and the relief hammered into it. The plate was then reversed and re-embedded face up, and the background was hammered down, the two steps being repeated until the desired height of relief was achieved. Fine details were then rendered by chasing - that is, chiseling - which gives the impression that the design has been carved out of the metal, whereas in fact the embossing process is essen- tially one of modeling. Embossing was not the only method of em- bellishing the surface. Areas might be mer- cury-gilded or chemically blued to create con- trasts of metal color, and flat surfaces could be intricately damascened to produce a sim- ilar result on a finer scale. The process of damascening, or inlaying fine wires into in- cised patterns, was introduced to Europe from the Near East in the Middle Ages, but in the sixteenth century became the special province of Italian armorers. The unembossed sections of the Alba armor were once entirely covered with graceful damascening, which now re- mains only on isolated parts that were pro- tected from rust (Figure I2). The surface of the element was scribed with the pattern desired, and the design either crosshatched or cut with burred edges to hold the inlay. Fine wire, usually of gold or silver, was then worked into the pattern, and hammered and burnished flush with the background, creating a lacy effect of great delicacy. If the ravages of time have ruined much of the surface of the Alba armor, the beauty of Piccinino's damascening is evident on the gauntlets (Figures I3 and I9) for Prince Philip's armor.

In the case of the Museum's pair there can be no doubt: even if the technical and stylistic relationship with the suit of Philip III were not so strong, the portrait would provide absolute confirmation. The Museum possesses still another pair of gauntlets (Figures I7 and I8) that can be asso- ciated with this group-and with Piccinino as well, although they have never been attrib- uted to him. They were unquestionably part of the Christie's sale in I839, described as "A Pair of Page's Gauntlets, the right-hand fin- gers of chain, chased and engraved with fig- ures." On these gauntlets, overlapping scales such as those shown in Prince Philip's portrait are used on the left hand, but are replaced on the right by bands of mail, which were appar- ently substituted for scales at some time be- fore the Christie sale. This difference is such an unusual feature that it makes the pair unique. There is another portrait of Philip III, show- ing him in the suit that matches these gaunt- lets - but without any gauntlets! There is some circumstantial evidence to link these gauntlets to Piccinino. The suit to which they belonged is known to have been given to Philip, as was the suit of embossed armor, by the Duke of Terranova, governor of Milan. It does not seem farfetched to sup- pose that both harnesses were commissioned from the finest Milanese armorer of his gener- ation. The strongest evidence of all, however, comes from direct comparison of the two pairs 270</page><page sequence="16">of gauntlets themselves. Although the relief ;A;00000 tt t;00^ 25t0WX _ decoratton of the pair with fingers is simply ! ;S;;;;i;; ;i--;? :jtt&gt;:i: - ? i fi i chiseled rather than embossed, the construc- &gt;400000000;0_ tton and damascen1ng are very sim1lar, and j.0f;0-- WiR?;*i4w? the armed classical warriors on the cuffs are 0 ; :y0f4-&lt;$i- S i almost exactly alike.
