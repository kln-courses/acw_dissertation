<plain_text><page sequence="1">Imagining a Wildlife Crossing Structure from an Animal's Perspective: The ARC International Competition's Finalist Janet Rosenberg Team Entry 'R-E-D' Janet Rosenberg and Raphael Justewicz ABSTRACT The story of our crossing structure unfolds with an examination of the dramatic forces that drive wildlife movement biol- ogy and behavior, along with the adaptive response we have taken against the ecological variability inherent within the Colorado landscape. We have relied on scientific knowledge, site evidence, and information on regional wildlife popula- tions to inspire our design. The questions we raised led us to closely examine animal anatomy, physiology, and behavior, and to imagine our design from an animal's perspective. We set our sights, minds, and challenges on an evolutionary step in the design of an animal road crossing, not simply a bridge, but a new "species" in form and function. At the heart of our crossing structure is a three-dimensional module with a planted deck, piers, and protective edges. On repetition, the module can produce curved paths as well as linear ones that respond to the clues to animal movement through the terrain, their living landscape, and their reactions to light, color, and sound that have influenced our design. Our cross- ing structure presents a variety of conditions suitable for a wide array of species and is adaptable to different preferences for site and science. The connections made between areas on one side of the road and the other generate a footprint that is not only modular, but more importantly for scientific research, is site specific, minimally intrusive on the existing landscape, continually changeable, and aims to make the crossing free of stress for wildlife.

It identifies the integration of cultural and scientific processes that led to the realization of an innovative three-dimensional wildlife crossing design. Any com- petition is about taking risk, and certainly in our war room', the debate centered on weighing risk. It was a process of synthetic exchange between landscape architects, archi- tects, structural engineers, cultural and road ecologists, animal scientists, fabricators and materials specialists, graphic designers, and artists.

We understood the potential con- tribution to the expanded role for landscape architecture within such movements as "Ecological Urbanism" (Mostafavi 2010). The ARC competi- tion was not just an intellectual exer- cise or an engineering problem to be solved with conventional technology. The competition, after all, came about because the group at Banff National Park (Alberta, Canada) had witnessed skyrocketing costs for basically the same design, one made by engineers (ARC 2010). More than engineering, and more than an academic study in the management of risks, our work for the competition introduced us to a broader ecological methodology to the design of a wildlife road cross- ing. The more we pressed into this new territory, the more we delighted at the opportunity for branding this as work through the lens of land- scape architecture and as a message we could use to inspire the general public at this high profile site. Close to 19,000 vehicles per day travel along this stretch of the 1-70 in West Vail, which bisects a landscape that sup- ports a population of 280,000 elk {Cervus canadensis), 10,000 black bears ( Ursus americanus ), and a small number of newly-introduced Cana- dian lynx ( Lynx canadensis) , released in a desperate attempt to strike a bal- ance in the ecosystem (ARC 2010, Salek 2008, Figure 1). For us, it was imperative that our design for a remedy to rising wildlife-vehicle col- lisions, which amounted to over $1 billion in insurance claims per year in the U.S. (ARC 2010), must include 370 % December 2012 ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION 30:4</page><page sequence="2">knowledge of how wildlife navigates under the picturesque blanket of the forest as seen from the road. Our teams restoration ecologist led the identification of clues of the movement of the animals through the landscape. These tracks, trails, bed- ding mats, and droppings revealed a finer grain than the objectifica- tion of landscape in the mappings of McHarg (1992) or the lens of land mosaics from Forman (1995). This "living landscape" (Steiner 2000) laid the foundation for what we began to refer to as a footprint for the struc- ture and the extent to which it would enter the forest habitat. Through the structures footprint, we could con- nect areas of familiarity from both sides of the road. We formulated the questions to weigh the risks in propos- ing a design that would play a role in scientific experiments regarding the variables that affect the animal s decisions when it comes to entering a man-made crossing structure. The science behind existing cross- ing structures acknowledges the role vegetation plays in guiding animals (Gunson et al. 2011). For wildlife, vegetation plays a significant role in their perception of the world, as well as for identifying sources of nutrition and refuge. We therefore created our planting palette by matching the antic- ipated growing conditions to a native reference community that has evolved under similar conditions. Vegetation has smell and taste, which are sensory cues for many different wildlife taxa. Therefore, the vegetation installed on a structure must be integrated into the surrounding landscape. Landscape architects especially like to think we know a little bit about how to navigate landscapes, and how to design them, through what we see, hear, smell, and feel; however, under- standing how wildlife perceive the world is a bigger challenge. We sought guidance from animal behaviorist Temple Grandin on how to think with an animal s perception. Grandin describes an animal s world as one of vision, sound, touch, and smell. "Its not about language," she said, adding that "you have to get into the sensory world in order to understand them." The impact of curved paths in decreasing stress is a specific attribute in her built work that we adopted. Even Charles Darwin explored the basis of mankind s compassion foot- print: the belief in the emotions of others as indefensible to life in human society. When we agreed to collect, and connect, animals across areas they were moving through and resting in - areas of familiarity - the process transitioned to one of materials and structure that would satisfy the chal- lenge for innovation and competitive cost. The Design We postulated the crossing structure should offer connections between areas where wildlife navigate or congregate (Figure 1). Think of our structure as a series of strands, each connecting 2 points in the forest landscape across the road from each other, with the strands converging over the road to create a greater width. These strands will minimally impact the forest habi- tat with a lightweight structure. The width of each strand is based on the quantity of strands and the effective width where the strands converge. Our science, with cost implications, determined the parameters of the crossing structure. To realize a design, we knew the strands should mimic the wildlife trails we saw in the forest and their relationship to topography. Animals are unlikely to go out of their way, so the slopes of our paths mimic the landscape. We developed a structural module that permits a larger footprint with the repetition of a smaller one, and 2 orientations of the module allowed us to create linear and curved segments that would become the building blocks for the strands. Moreover, the module could generate an infinite number of foot- prints for future sites, a response to the competition brief for flexibility and adaptability (Figures 1 and 2). To determine the parameters of our design, we delved into a science-based vetting for new criteria to inform the design, with Grandin introducing us to the sensory world of our target wildlife. Consider the fact that we smell before we see, yet relative to humans with about 5 million olfac- tory cells, representing only 5% of our genes, domestic cats {Felis catus) have 100 million, and domestic dogs ( Canis familiaris) have 200 million. Moreover, this illustrates how differ- ent wildlife species sense their world. In fact, pheromones become an ani- mal s unique fingerprint because each animal generates a map of the trajec- tories of other animals that identifies mood, illness, sex, or maturity. Many use this ability, together with prevail- ing winds, to detect any predators, to identify their offspring, recognize group or individual territorial bound- aries, or allow mature males to detect a female in estrus. The function of smell is also often hard wired as reflex responses. This critical role in the sensory stim- uli is therefore the connection to our approach to vegetation, and we identi- fied the need for 3 planting strategies (Figure 3). For each strategy, we deter- mined community target species with analogous growing conditions adapted to and tolerant of the native conditions (CVCP 2003). The first is simply a continuation of the species compo- sition in the surrounding communi- ties. The dry climate and yearly 300+ days of sunshine have made height an overwhelming characteristic of the tree cover. We applied this strategy to fill in the gaps between the strands as well, allowing the forest to creep in on the substrate in between the strands as they converge over the road. The second strategy introduces pre-vegetated trays for the deck of the crossing structure that mimic the native shallow soils, the infrequent and short-duration hydroperiod, and frequent freeze/ thaw cycles in winter. They also mimic the topography of the forest floor and the slopes needed to arch over the road and connect with the forest. December 2012 ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION 30:4 ^ 371</page><page sequence="3">The target communities include alpine shrubs, grasses and forbs, as well as some of the xeric communi- ties found in the mountains (CVCP 2003). An instant habitat is achieved because the vegetation is established in the controlled environment of a nurs- ery. The installation and changeability of these trays are also effortless. The third planting strategy takes advantage of the train railway tracks that are to be located along the central median of the highway. Over this future train corridor, we created a deeper cross section for the structure to act as a baffle against the vibration and noise from the train, and where we could anticipate trees to grow tall (Figure 2). Hearing is also a very important sen- sory tool for wildlife. Not all sounds are audible, and each species has a range of normal hearing, both loud- ness and pitch, measured in ampli- tude (decibels) and pitch (frequency). The human range for pitch (20 Hz to 23 kHz) is surpassed in domestic dogs (45 Hz to 60 KHz) and cats (45 Hz to 64 KHz); by reference, the lowest key on the piano has a pitch of 64-KHz. A dog can hear a whisper (measuring 30 dB), at a distance 3 times farther than humans can, as well as a silenť dog whistle in the ultrasonic range of frequencies (meaning greater than those of human perception). Snakes can sense frequencies, known as infra- sonic, lower than human perception through their bellies, and whales, giraffes, dolphins, and elephants use these frequencies for communication (Thompson 2011). This discovery led us to explore a possible solution to the road noise as the largest source of stress in cross- ing a road. Along the outer edges of the crossing structure, we integrated a continuous sound and light distur- bance attenuation barrier (Figure 4). The curvilinear shape of the barrier is determined by the typical profile of tractor-trailer high beams. The Doppler Effect makes sound ahead of moving vehicles much louder. Our team acoustic engineer analyzed our design and concluded that the space above the road enclosed by our struc- ture would be almost perfectly quiet (Figure 5). The barrier rises from 2.4 m (as set for road fencing) to a maximum of 5.5 m. The overlay of gentle arcs provides multiple interpretations, among them the sinuous curves of the landscape, and the fluidity of move- ment and form we often associate with animals. Perching areas for birds to occupy the structure reinforces the importance of bird song as a calming influence in the forest cross-section (Figure 6). There is substantial anec- dotal evidence of animals as sentinels of environmental hazards especially for humans, and by extrapolation for all forest animals, as in the expression "canary in the coal mine". A common explanation is their greater sensitivity, or perhaps that a greater exposure, has increased their ability to detect them (Van der Schalie et al. 1999). The current Banff model recom- mends a crossing width of 50 m or 60 m to diminish noise and to provide clear views across the road. Yet our road ecologist informed us of recent crossings in Europe and the province of Ontario in Canada that have been built 30 m wide. Our notes above on the keen sensory perceptions, particu- larly olfactory and auditory, in animals suggests there is more to the science of a crossing structure than a reliance on an anthropomorphic model for visual acuity and clear sightlines. We know that vision in dogs is 25:75, which is poor compared to the 20:20 ideal for humans. Animals, such as elk, whose eyes are set far apart, have panoramic vision that enables them to see behind their heads. Yet their vision has evolved to detect patterns of intense contrast of light and dark, a direct physiological extension of their better night vision, and there- fore one with lessened color acuity, and little depth of field (Wattie 201 1). Our target species, consisting largely of ungulates, have dichromatic vision and see the world through the purple, green, blue, and yellow gradient. For them, red registers as gray (De Valois 1990). Humans, in contrast, have the ability to see the color red. Birds and reptiles have the evolutionary advan- tage of detecting the 4 basic wave- length regions of light: ultraviolet, blue, green, and red. This struck us as the means to use red as a secret code to communicate to humans beyond the perception of other mammals. This potential for red as the color of the crossing structure was easily achieved when our structural engi- neers introduced us to a lightweight material called Wood Core Fiberglass (WCF). Wood Core Fiberglass, which consists of boards of lumber encased in fiberglass that together act much like a steel I-beam, is able to efficiently handle both tension and compression. The competition brief placed great importance on new materials, and WCF met this mandate with highly enviable facts because: 1) WCF decks can exceed 22 million cycles, whereas concrete decks typically fail at 2 mil- lion cycles; 2) at 30-cm deep, decks weigh 220 kg/m2 (45 lbs/ft2), but concrete decks weigh approximately 830 kg/m2 ( 1 80-lbs/ ft2) ; 3) the man- ufacturers assessment forecasts that 540 tons of carbon dioxide emissions would be prevented relative to a con- crete structure; and 4) the resin is soy-based, meaning volatile organic compounds are not present. In addi- tion, because the wood (which pro- vides the stiffness) is encased by the fiberglass (which takes the loading), rotting is eliminated. The fiberglass permits WCF to be custom-colored and consequently can be red, as well as graffiti-proof. Préfabrication of the assembly permits installation of the entire crossing structure in &lt;1 wk, thereby minimizing impact on traffic and habitat disruptions (Figure 2). Armed with this confidence for the material of the structure, together with the vegetation strategies, the distur- bance barriers, and the concept of splayed strands, we were able to gauge how the design compared with the Banff model and to finalize the shape and size of the footprint. The com- petition brief indicated that $12-15 million was the current construction 372 # December 2012 ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION 30:4</page><page sequence="4">target, yet because of the greater road width at our site in Vail, with 6 lanes compared to 4, in addition to the train corridor, we assumed our target budget could be considered 50% higher. Even with the need to carry a 30% contingency, the cost estimate for our submittal was less than the current Banff model: $1.3 million per lane of roadway compared to $3-3.75 million. We settled on a footprint with 3 strands to connect the key points of entry our ecologists identified in the landscape. These were principally the meadow areas on both sides of the road - on the north side associated with the topographical gully and on the south side with the river - as well as heavily used trails that would trans- late as collection areas, in addition to the road edge along a protective fence 0.5 km in each direction (Figure 4). The footprint could have been larger or smaller. The size was determined by what we knew about the scientific literature and the parameters of other crossings, our approach at creating distinct strands of movement to be expressed as separate elevated paths, and an economy of means. The foot- print came to 30 modules, with each module rhomboid in shape 10 m wide with parallel sides 12.5 m and 14.5 m long. Because the strands move gently into the forest at different points in plan as well as elevation, more ani- mals are being funneled towards the crossing because of this greater reach in the forest. We determined that our footprint, with an overall width of 30 m over the road, has an effective catchment of 80 m by including the strands, compared to the 50 m or 60 m in the traditional singular form of the Banff model. The splayed foot- print also gives animals 9 paths (3 for each of 3 strands) to follow rather than only one. This will help the study of predator-prey relationships by being able to monitor and control different entry points to different species. This is just one of the many laboratory-type opportunities this design offers scien- tists that include the role of topog- raphy, vegetation, and other sensory stimuli, and how they affect species differently (Gunson 201 1). Discussion From the beginning, we sensed the need for a departure from the status quo. We investigated the form of the crossing structures at Banff. We ana- lyzed the wildlife disturbances that are played out at a road crossing, which we described earlier as the sound and light of the road vehicles, and which influenced the design of the continu- ous sound and light attenuation bar- rier that provides the recognizable mimicry with the surrounding land- scape. We challenged the very prem- ise that a crossing structure at this location without additional structures elsewhere would by itself eliminate mortality, since other locations, even nearby, are deserving as well and were identified to us. The location of the site for the competition was deter- mined by the highest mortality rate, as the focus for this competition, yet was not the only potential candidate for Vail. Shouldn't we be putting up lighter structures at more locations? Dont we ourselves jaywalk on long blocks between intersections? Isn't the premise of one crossing structure out- dated? Wouldn't a forest fire, or the impending advance of the mountain pine beede (. Dendroctonus ponderosae ), result in a change in animal movement and render obsolete a particular road crossing? Our design responds to these questions in being adaptable, light- weight, and eminently changeable, or even moveable. The low weight of the materials is directly reflected in the lower cost of our structure and in the minimal pier footings required. Our design permits contemplating mul- tiple crossings because they are easily erected and also easily dismantled. We learned through science that for an animal to cross at the road it is a matter of heightened stimuli and response to stress. This is in terms of sound and light that is generated entirely by the presence of roads in the context of a forest that we had to learn about and reduce as much as we could (Clevenger and Waltho 2004). How- ever, the science of wildlife crossings is very much experimental. Our teams road ecologist worked many years monitoring the Banff model (Clev- enger et al. 2002), and she recently published a review of the existing lit- erature on wildlife crossing science (Gunson et al. 2011). An absolute does not exist for the ideal width of the crossing structure over the road. Our design, too, is experimental, because our crossing structure is unlike any- thing yet built. There is, however, a resemblance in the arcing of paths when compared with our competi- tors. The significant difference is that we have lifted the paths into the air as lightweight structures. Adding fill to make for a crossing would change the topography, and be a highly disrup- tive proposition in many respects: the existing habitats would be compro- mised, if not destroyed; the amount of infill required would undoubtedly close traffic for many weeks or months; trees and vegetation would take years to grow and once again provide pro- tective cover; the cost of the structure would rise unnecessarily; and wildlife would have to find an alternate route to cross the highway, perhaps to an ever greater risk of mortality. Nothing could be simpler than a post, beam, and deck structure (Figure 2). A modular unit that is pie-shaped allows for the creation of curved paths that can snake into the forest, around trees, and arch with the topography. These criteria clinched our assump- tion for adaptability to other. The only incursions on existing conditions of vegetation and topography are the column supports. We designed lit- erally and figuratively a lightweight structure made up of modular units that can be tailor-made for many sites. The competition brief did ask for adaptability and flexibility. It was worth the risk to present an intelligent approach that met the aspirations of the competition brief. The use of WCF further seemed to us an ideal solution. We had developed December 2012 ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION 30:4 M 373</page><page sequence="5">an innovative science-based approach, and it was now paired with a material that is technologically advanced and characterized by laudable environmen- tal properties. WCF s minimal weight makes even columns and footings less intrusive with the gentle meander- ing of the strands into the forest. The préfabrication of the panels and simple site assembly allows the road cross- ing to be erected within a matter of 5 days. Again, this adds to the flex- ibility in the design in that a strand can be moved in the future, either by necessity or in response to scientific understanding. In response to beetle infestation, the WCF can incorporate the lost timber, and even express it, since the fiberglass is soy-based and can highlight the wood core with its naturally translucent quality, or even through an integral color, which for us became the R-E-D banner of revolu- tion in red. In our planting strategies, we matched anticipated growing condi- tions on the structure with those in the ground (Figure 6). At the same time, we benefit from planting in the ground in between the paths of move- ment. Where topography in the forest is more pronounced, we use shallower vegetated cover on the structure that consists of pre-vegetated modules that can be prepared in the nursery (Figure 3). A keen interest for sci- entists involved in the field of road crossings is isolating variables, such as specific vegetation, that attracts specific wildlife species. The ability to modify or test options for vegetation makes the changeability available with pre-vegetated units a great boon. The competition brief s introduction of the train corridor signaled the need for a buffer to this source of noise and vibration (Figure 2). The deeper planting of trees on top of the train corridor met this challenge. The Colorado forest floor is also characterized by a dappled light in between widely-spaced conifers whose lower dry branches are the principal barriers to free movement. Branches that have broken off are often associ- ated with trails where wildlife moves. We predict that not only will our structure provide for a calm environ- ment, but the visual pattern of tall ele- ments and linear shadows is analogous to and continues the sensory stimuli that identify our strands as extensions of the forest. We have developed a version of this competition design that, as an added benefit, allows for a clear span across 8 lanes by engineering box beams fab- ricated from of WCF boards that are post-tensioned with cables. Despite humans' role as primary predators, we are the species with the capacity to make a positive difference. Our decision to make the structure red is a branding approach that will help spread the word of a renewed compassion. We suspect this is a Cana- dian trait, yet the design is our proof that we can anticipate the nature and characteristics of anything we conceive or create (the medium) by virtue of the changes, often unnoticed and not obvious, that they effect (the message). Invoking the Canadian media scholar Marshall McLuhan seems entirely fitting (McLuhan 2003).
