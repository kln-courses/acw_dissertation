<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Versions of Performance Art Xerxes Mehta June 1979. Baltimore. Of the American and foreign companies that appear in the New Theatre Festival's sixth incarnation, two groups - those associated with Ping Chong (New York) and JoAnne Akalaitis (New York) - stand out clearly. A third - Studio Scarabee (Holland) - which performed at the 1977 festival but was unable to attend the current one, presents its extraordinary work in Baltimore in January 1980. Considered separately and together, the three companies illuminate aspects of the performance style that has variously come to be known as Performance Art, Art Performance, and the Theatre of Images. In discussing the individual groups, I open with a description of and response to the piece at issue, shift toward those aspects of company history or external influence that help to illuminate the controlling aesthetic, and, thus armed, circle back to attempt a broader vision of the central work. As we move through the three pieces, certain facets of Performance Art as a style begin to define themselves. My summary analysis of such larger patterns initially focuses on what might be termed elements of the style - the sources, types, and uses of imagery, the origins of text and the tension between text and meaning, and the interactions among vying ideas of performance and acting, illusion and abstraction; then concentrates on organizational tactics - such as the impact of collage-as-structure on narrative, meaning, and mood; and, lastly, considers aspects of the works that seem to be at least partially dictated by the imperatives of Performance Art, itself - for example, the dialectic between art as subject and nature or self as subject, the synchronous use of several notions and layers of time, and the tonal links between pastoral, mock-pastoral, or elegiac impulses and the natures of collage and the photographic image. Implicit in the essay are three broad hypotheses, which, I hope, by argument's end, will have acquired a measure of persuasiveness. First, that, far from being a "post- modern" phenomenon, Performance Art as exemplified by these companies is, in its insistence on flatness and abstraction, and in its profound indebtedness to every major modern art movement since Cubism, firmly in this century's great tradition of mod- ernist formalism. Second, that, in its near abandonment of character and narrative Xerxes Mehta is Associate Professor of Theatre at the University ofMaryland, Baltimore County. He has published on radical contemporary theatre in TJ and Performing Arts Journal and is presently completing a book on the subject. 165</page><page sequence="2">164 / TJ, May 1984 Ping Chong and The Fiji Company (New York) in Humboldt's Current.

Tow</page><page sequence="4">167 / VERSIONS OF PERFORMANCE ART structure in favor of performer and collage structure, Performance Art has the poten- tial to influence theatre toward the mainstream of modernism - ironically, at a time when modernism in architecture and the plastic arts shows signs of having run its course. And third, that, despite its inability to render the fine movements of a single soul, which only acting and narrative can reach, a formalist art whose essence lies in its careful juxtaposition of created images and images from life is capable of evoking an extraordinarily rich and sophisticated range of feeling and thought. Ping Chong/ The Fiji Company Ping Chong brings his Obie award-winning multi-media meditation on quests exte- rior and interior, Humboldt's Current. A bare rectangular stage, a wall-to-wall scrim, three evenly spaced legs on each side. The effect is flat, painterly, a choreographer's canvas. In the extreme down left corner is a small primitive shrine, bearing the votive image of a white man, bearded, spectacled, holding a book. Silence and darkness. A slide of elegantly arranged flowers fills the scrim. A young Victorian couple walks into the image and stands center stage, silently staring out at us. They are Charles and Emma Humboldt, his the face in the shrine. Empty stage. Sharp clatter of birds, crickets. Color slides of nineteenth century museum specimens fill the scrim - seal, mole, Arctic Fox, turtle - dead, stuffed, the projectionist (Chong) gathering and relinquishing focus leisurely, scientifically, microscopically. And yet the colors are so vivid, the fauna so gorgeously eccentric in their vanished dioramas that one feels, unaccountably, the bite of loss, of innocence unknown. Halfway through this accumulation, classification, and ironic memorial to our nineteenth century forebears' habit of accumulating, classifying, and memorializ- ing everything, Humboldt's voice-over begins: "For 35 years I have searched for the beast. From the jungles of the West to those of the East .. ." and ends: "I have never forgotten .... I prepared myself for the task of tracking the beasts down."' On the final words, the image of the beast appears - small, furry, man-like, hair deep red and fine, eyes watchful and melancholy. In front of the held image, a black-clad stagehand lays a strip of mylar across the darkened stage and then, to the sound of distant temple bells, slowly pulls a stream of small, paper prayer-boats along its shining length. Each boat bears a lit candle and is separated from the next by a sprig of purple flowers. The effect is child-like, hypnotic, a serio-comic offertory to Faustian compacts, vanished braveries, continuing naiveties, and the necessary mysteries at the heart of both life and art.

To accomplish the interminable hoisting of "350 head of cattle . .. one by one, from jetty to hold . . ." the blackened stagehand gravely brings on and later takes off three miniaturized papier macha cows, lining the rear stage with bovine dignity.

Humboldt and Signora Hanes totter towards each other, supported by canes: 'Will you find it?" "This time, I've got him." ". .. how is your wife?" (Silence.) "and Foghetti?" 'Toghetti's dead." (Silence.) Signora Hanes writes another check, Hum- boldt kisses her hand, another silence, they leave as they came. Shadows of shadows, life's loose ends, the braveries of love and the love of bravery. Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings cushions the whole. A screen descends in front of the playing area. Bach's Bist du bei mir fills the air. A home movie of Humboldt and Emma at a seaside grand hotel - weathered arcades, gulls, surf, shells. The lovers stand, wave, clown around, drink wine. Our last image is of their smiling faces, "when they were very young and full of God's grace." Film and song are by Meredith Monk, to whom Humboldt's Current is dedicated. The deeply moving yet formalized naivete that characterizes a work such as this can perhaps first be approached through a word that Chong himself uses to describe his art - "bricolage: a new world created out of any and all available materials from an old world."2 A bricole is a billiard shot that results in an "indirect action or unexpected stroke." Hence, bricolage, underlining collage's inherent discontinuities with multiplex indirections. The three most central of these within the work are the caroming of media against each other - film on live action on slides on shadow-play on text on live and recorded sound; of materials against each other - new on old, found on made; and of cultures against each other - Victorian on modern, Eastern on Western, Romantic on Ironic, "primitive" on "developed." A fourth set of refractions is outside the work, between work and audience, as direct stimulations (narrative, for example) which are held in common by all viewers are repeatedly filtered through private chambers of myth, cliche, and childhood fantasy. This, in turn, points to a final use of the bricolage idea, one echoed in structural anthropology, wherein the naive assemblages of means and materials that characterize the non-engineering society outlook ("which I would say I would be part of") are transformed into an aesthetic that envelops both work and audience in profoundly childlike and subtle simplicities.3 Assuming, now, that method here is at least as interesting as matter and, in the cur- rent experimental context, more significant, Chong's relationships to his two major formal influences - his collaborator of seven years, Meredith Monk, and the late American Surrealist, Joseph Cornell - offer further insights. Of the former, Chong has said the following (I quote at length, not only because the statement illuminates, but because of its inherent value at a time of continuing and extreme self- consciousness in art): 4 Meredith Monk Meredith's love of music which is at least as deep as her love of imagery pervades and dictates.

It is important to emphasize dance as a way toward a performing style which blends movement and acting. Since Meredith's work emphasizes the non-verbal and movement, some theatre critics . .. dis- qualify her work as theatre, insisting that it is dance. But the pioneering work Meredith did [from] the mid-sixties to the present in what is now called Imagistic Theatre and Perform- ance Art cannot be called anything else but theatre. Her concerns have never been pure dance. Her use of a performing space is unusual for its sensitivity to the integrity of, and per- sonality of, any given space. The space and/or its architectural character vibrates and makes its "presence" known throughout any given piece.5 Meredith favors a 3-dimensional use of space whenever possi- ble. A sculptural use of space. Meredith's use of music is more 3-dimensional since she almost always uses live music and vocal singing of her own making. Meredith works from the inside out. There is always a visceral field even in the most objective of her works. The Poetic is primary in Meredith's work. Meredith's work is almost always concerned with the Primal in human existence. It is evident in her singing and [in] the events in her pieces. The work always has a timeless feel to it, even in a work like Quarry, which is concerned with the nightmare of the second World War as seen by an American child removed from the war in America.7 interest in film. The potential of scale changes in image and in transporting one from one reality to another, from one time to another, is translated into stage terms. This interest in the . . . plasticity of film we share in common, but it is a primary mover and creative influence in my work. The spatial plane I operate on is flat and 2-dimensional; at least that is the overall feel- ing of the way the space is utilized. Space is played with as so many planes receding back in space from the horizontal to the vertical, from the front of the performing space to the back. My use of space is painterly rather than sculptural. A love of sound, and its right of "presence" as an atmospheric element and as a means to suggest space . . . we both share a great interest in. Silence is of the utmost impor- tance to both our visions. I always use music that already exists for its inherent cultural connotation and its sug- gestion of atmosphere ... .My use of music is linear, painterly. I more often than not work from the out- side in . . . My work has always been about mortality, the transience of human existence, the outsider, and the lineage of cultures past and present . . . .

SChong, interviewed by Daniel Webster, The Philadelphia Inquirer, 26 April 1979, Sect. B. p. 9.</page><page sequence="8">171 / VERSIONS OF PERFORMANCE ART Chong's links to Joseph Cornell are equally striking. A collagist and film maker, Cornell is best known for his celebrated box constructions, which he first exhibited in 1932 and continued developing until his death forty years later. A Cornell box is itself a form of collage, mixing two and three dimensional elements. Fragmenting these elements from their found contexts, the artist would then box them, creating new meaning from and for existing objects and images. In basic method, a commonality, if not necessarily an influence is obvious. More singular affinities can be seen in Cornell's love of chances and strange coincidences (betraying part of his debt to the Surrealists); in the small scale of his constructions (often scarcely larger than a shoebox) and the startling shifts of scale within them (a favorite Surrealist device); in his choice of materials and motifs - nineteenth century steel engravings (as in the collages of the early 1930s), charts of the heavens, old love letters, sand, sea shells, birds (in portrait and stuffed, as in the box, Hotel Eden), urban exteriors, Debussy, all manner of nostalgia - often employed in loving evocation of fabled nineteenth century per- formers (as in the box, Taglioni's Jewel Casket); and in the atmosphere of gentleness, wonder and muted melancholy that dominates his work and declares its freedom from the violent and erotic purposes of his Surrealist mentors. "Humboldt ... is not a product of this culture. It's too delicate, and it's too . . . unaggressive."9 Nevertheless, as Cornell acknowledged his dependence upon the dialectics of history and modern art (16 narrative collages, "Story Without a Name - For Max Ernst"), so Chong does, in the piece that he dedicated to Cornell - I Flew to Fiji; You Went South (1973) - and in such quotations as the monster movie (which Cornell made with Rose Hobart) that Chong incorporated into his Lazarus (1972/77). Dialectic, however, implies contrast, the most obvious of which is that, in Chong's work, the collage is alive, moves through time, and so remains in tension with the simultaneity of impact that is its own essence. Since this centrally important tension is shared by all the groups under discussion here, I will explore its implications later. For now, let us return to Humboldt's Current. '"My parents were both in Chinese opera. They came to this country in the depth of the Depression and became classic immigrants. They opened a restaurant and had six children. I heard about opera all my life .... In all my work the most important thing is the sense of the mystery of existence. Our age is too sure of itself, we need humility."10 "... an epoch of hearts uplifted with hope, and brains active with sober and manly reason for the common good. Some ages are marked as sentimental, others stand con- spicuous as rational. The Victorian age was happier than most in the flow of both these currents into a common stream of vigorous and effective talent." 11 In his earlier works, acid perspectives on the immigrant/outsider as victim/killer/ artist. Now, deeper soundings, for causes as well as effects, the facticity of the chosen form finding corresponding objectivities of feeling and attitude. Freely, seamlessly, Surrealistically joining media, periods, and cultures, the artist, through purely formal means and with the lightest of touches, exorcizes private demons and summons public 9 Chong, private interview. 10Chong, Inquirer, p. 9. 11J.

For Chong's seizing of found materials, I suggest, is his way of recovering the past, of making love and peace with it, while his collaging of the found with the made is his defense against the past, his revenge upon it and upon the present it has spawned. So, in Humboldt, while we relearn the melancholy consequences of the Vic- torian urge to denature the world - in the public realm: wars and colonization; in the private: loss of time, love, family, self - we are also offered countervalences - bravery redeeming smugness, destructive obsessions revealing their roots in rationalist fidelities and coexistent awe in the face of the Romantic unknown. Ironies compound as the objects of irony - the loved and satirized engravings, animal slides, and excerpts from letters, diaries, and biographies (Charles Darwin's, Emma Darwin's, and Pierre Renoir's, amongst others) - betray, in their very excess, and in most cases prob- ably unconsciously, as great a reverence for the mystery, beauty, and "presence" of the world's phenomena as the controlling Ironist / Celebrant would have us experience in reaction. The suspicion remains, however, that that too has been anticipated by the artist, that such associations are part of the doubleness that pieces of a found past, on one level never lost, evoke in memory. And so we pass through Darwin, whose evidence for evolution partly rested on the recapitulation of racial history in individ- ual embryonic development, and Humboldt, who in his Kosmos (5 vols., 1845-1862; Eng. tr., 1845-1865) also sought unities amid the complexity of nature, to the poet's</page><page sequence="10">173 / VERSIONS OF PERFORMANCE ART childlike view of his childish composite, Charles Humboldt, the White Knight whose current freezes Peruvian and New Yorker in its flow through impartial time.12 For if, as Empson suggests, one reason for the Knight's moral grandeur "is that he stands for the Victorian scientist," then it is also true that "It is the childishness of the Knight that lets him combine the virtues of the poet and the scientist, and one must expect a creature so finely suited to life to be absurd because life itself is absurd." 13 The child in the poet enters the child in his persecutor, recapturing neither the innocence of the race nor the innocence of the nursery, but rather the innocence of new sight, of Art, of adult resignations and freedoms. Let us move, now, from a work whose power lies in its precisely intuited collisions of surface imagery to a work which, while equally lustrous in its Surrealist skin, demonstrates with exceptional clarity the analytic possibilities of collage. Let us also look at performers who forsake the plateau of pure design for valleys where perform- ance and acting attempt perilous unions. Let us, finally, shift from delight in the mastery of multiple imaging to a more austere face of the style, wherein a single image can yet compress into its subtle equivocations a capsule history of modern art. JoAnne Akalaitis These days are with one for all time - they are never to be forgotten - and they are found nowhere else in all the world but at the poles. The peace of God which passes all understanding reigns here in these days. One wishes one could bring a glimpse of it away with all its unimaginable beauty.14 Luminous meditations on beauty, bravery, art, and time animate JoAnne Akalaitis's polar odyssey, Southern Exposure. The chilling, witty, and chimerical set (by Akalaitis and Power Boothe), a coequal partner in performance, consists of a large, raked and tilted made-up bed with fragments of walls and a parachute-silk cyc close behind it, a nondescript paint-peeling chair stage left of it, and a low curved plat- form below and to the right of it. Under its coverings, the bed is punctured by two large holes, from which light and sound occasionally emerge and into which objects are occasionally deposited. On the platform is a small pile of stones (a penguin rookery) and an old water-stained book. Everything is close to the audience. Everything is angled. Almost everything is white, the subtle play of variegated papers (walls), cloths (sheets, blankets, pillows), and paints (walls, floor) seducing the eye into white-on-white wanderings. The only non-white elements are the gray stones, the brownish book, the blue-gray chair, and the blue-gray "shadow" of the bed, angled forward (independent of any realistic relation to light) and painted on the floor. In context and in use, this environment will come to suggest both infinity and closure, both the icebergs, plateaus, crevasses, and ridges of the last and vast frontier and the encompassing of those freezing absences within the cozy certainties of an Edwardian bedroom. From the bedroom comes a bed-time story, turning outer space into inner 12 The work's original title was "Voyage of the Beagle."

Not incidentally, of course, the stage is a blank (canvas, paper, choreographer's floor), the common locus of tripartite crea- tion - subject's, artists', ours. PROLOGUE. Underlining the perilous exposures of this linked adventure, a bed- time-story-in-progress is being improvised as the audience enters. The house lights are on. A pleasant young woman (Ellen McElduff) is standing at the edge of the stage and telling us all about penguins ("cordial, courteous animals"). Her voice is gentle, a near whisper, her manner motherly. As she speaks, she builds a penguin's nest from the pile of stones and also illustrates her talk with slides of penguins projected onto her skirt and the walls and floor of the set. She cues the projectionist (on the house floor) on timing and placement and, when he errs, quietly corrects him. Thus we hear about "baby penguins, parental affection, fatherly pride, penguin loyalty, penguin enemies [sea leopards, skuas], penguin endurance."15 Throughout, she consults her locket- watch, until, mid-flow, she suddenly stops and disappears behind the set. The effect of all this is charming, funny, and strangely moving. A woman in Edwardian dress speaks directly to us and to her projectionist/collaborator. Her attitudes - the sen- timental anthropomorphizing, the self-conscious Darwinian correctives ('"Keep in mind the South Polar Skua is not an evil bird; he needs to feed his own . . .") - while within memory, are not quite our own, and yet time and place hold, illusion is denied, the first notes of historical discord gently but firmly struck. On other levels - a reminder of the Mabou Mines' earlier animations (the semi-private chronology of the evolution of a style); and, finally, through sleight-of-hand, our skepticism courted and turned into delight, a vision of human potential has lodged in our dreams. Bird- woman showing the way, a loving, brave society flowers in the cruelest environment on earth. MOVIE. In a blackout, a short film of the woman and a man (David Warrilow), our contemporaries, under the giant Antarctic photo-mural in Grand Central Station, looking at aquarium penguins at Coney Island, clowning romantically on the board- walk in winter. Exposing the banality and casual consumerism of the film, the woman, in voiceover, recounts an explorer's discovery of a penguin burial pool: "Then with a tingling of my spine I perceived that the bottom was strewn layer upon layer .... By hundreds, possibly by thousands, they lay ... flippers outstretched and breasts reflecting blurred gleams of white. Safe at last . .. they took their endless rest; for decades, perhaps for centuries, the slumberers would undergo no change in their frigid tomb" (Robert Cushman Murphy, Logbook for Grace, 1913).16 SHACKLETON STORY. Silence. Both in bed, Edwardian dress, the woman stand- ing and lyrically drawing a detailed map of the entire Antarctic on the paper-covered wall behind her, the man sitting relaxed under the covers, hands on knees, staring out, 15 This and all subsequent script quotations in this section are from the unpublished MS. of Southern Exposure, quoted by permission of JoAnne Akalaitis, p. 1. 16Southern Exposure, p. 2.</page><page sequence="13">176 / Ti, May 1984 expressionless. When she finishes, he quickly and directly launches his account of Sir Ernest Shackleton's ill-fated Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914-1917). "It was to be the last great polar adventure, the crossing of the entire Southern Continent, from sea to sea." The woman drops a handful of small black and white plastic cubes into his lap. When he resumes, it is in a slow, soft, exhausted voice, his features transparent, his manner unfathomably interior. It is a thrilling and mysterious moment, one in which we do not know who he is (character, story-teller, actor, per- former?), when he is (then or now?), or where he is (there, here, on the ice, in the bedroom?). It is perhaps in the nature of ambiguity to feel more inclusive than exclu- sive and that is the case here. All possibilities are held taut at some subanalytic level as Southern Exposure and JoAnne Akalaitis declare the sources of their power. And so as the story winds down - unimaginable sufferings, miraculous rescues, the dead counted, survivors dispersed, failures in the cotton business, turnings to drink, pneumonia and heart attacks in old age - the man and the woman stand, take down the map, fold it into a neat triangle, each holding an end, take scissors from pockets, and carefully cut it up. Blackout. Amplified sound of cutting continues. Overtones of honor, national ordeals, the theatre of glory vanishing forever, paper underlining place and history as loci of mind, imaginary grounds on which imagination is tested. MIRAGE. The man stands on the bed and releases a roll of fresh paper down the headboard/wall. He rapidly draws a horizontal line across it, and marks it - HORIZON. He cuts an irregular piece out of the bottom and sticks it on above the line - ICEBERG. He checks to make sure we're with him. Below the line he writes - NOTHING. He checks us again, then scrawls in huge letters over the top - MIRAGE. He regards the audience for several seconds, then furiously rips the paper down. Blackout. Paper crinkles in the dark. We are in the presence of failure, the failure of art to capture reality, or even the unreality of reality; and the failure of the teller of the tale, hence the personal failure of the performer, who has rejected the sanctuary of character. Placed as it is immediately after the central narrative, MIRAGE sends a fissure through the whole. BED. Bed as bed. Man and woman asleep in it. Snores. Domesticity. Humor. Then a move, the sound of the paper crinkling, more moves, more paper, groans, pokes, more humor. Both sit up, face one another. Blackout. The touch is light and yet the fissure widens, for what disturbs their sleep is the record of all that has past - obses- sions, deaths, mirages, the self as sole arbiter of value - and, one fears, all that is to come. The thought occurs that perhaps the sleepless nights of modernism start here, in this bagatelle - so witty, so perfectly wrought. FOOD. The man is bent over in the chair, pulling layers of thick stockings onto one foot. He finally puts on a great fur boot, then wraps a rag-bandage over that. A low beam of light isolates foot and action. The woman, meanwhile, stands on the bed next to a slide of standard sledging rations projected behind her (8 small flat packets) and tells us, lyrically, of explorers' food fantasies. The current of anxiety underlying her cheerful sociability causes her to break off at times and slowly turn her head to "blankly regard the man," who neither stops nor pays any attention to her. On the march, after breakfast, "consisting of half a pannikin of semi-raw horse meat . . . we</page><page sequence="14">177 / VERSIONS OF PERFORMANCE ART would... [with] serious and careful consideration.. weave from our hungry imaginations a tale of a day spent in eating." There follows an unheeded parody of belle Ppoque gastronomy, gross Gongoristic wallows in eight repasts a day, con- cluding with a twelve-course dinner followed, at midnight, by "a really big meal, just before we go to bed. There will be melon, grilled trout, and butter sauce, roast chicken with plenty of livers, a proper salad with eggs and very thick dressing, green peas and new potatoes, a saddle of mutton, fried suet pudding, peaches a la Melba, egg curry .... ." (Ernest Shackleton, The Heart of the Antarctic, 1910).17 The woman stops, light on her fading. Finally, the man finishes, rises, and looks at her, the light on his foot dimming as another blooms on his face. Blackout. There is humor, of course, at the predictability and innocence of human fantasizing in the face of extreme deprivation. There is a kind of concentrated heaviness in the man's opaque, inward face and slow, hypnotic, task-action - ascetically grounded in its field of white, perfectly balanced by the baroque luxuriance of the verbal account. I suggest, however, that this balance is only formal and, relatedly, that the woman's anxiety and her partner's obliviousness have a common source. This source, it seems to me, is their simultaneous - but not joint - participation in two opposing ideas of theatre and time. For surely her anxiety stems from his too deep identification, from the threat of the pull of mimesis to their story-telling function, from the power of real time and the silent image to overwhelm stage time (wherein imagination dwells) and language. I will return to these questions, some of the most fascinating in contemporary perform- ance theory. For now, let us remark only that, as is always true with Akalaitis, such formal dilemmas are inseparable from feeling and value and that the threat to the coherence of the whole springs from ancient human mimetic impulse. QUILT. Closure. The man unwraps his boot, the woman brings on an antique quilt (by Anne Morrell) and sewing basket. They lay the quilt over the bed, sit on the floor on either side of it and resume work on its pattern, which increasing light reveals to be a map of the Antarctic. As they sew, they chat softly about Scott, Amundsen, the reasons for failure, who handled dogs better, etc. The woman challenges the man to a sewing race to the Pole. The projectionist asks some pedantic questions about nutri- tion, only one of which is answered. Initially, the conversation is improvised, in casual, contemporary tones, the performers having left the style of the piece - which does not prevent us from feeling that we are eavesdropping on a past and intimate scene. Suddenly stage and house lights are brought up full, the man takes off boot and stockings and puts on a bedroom slipper, the woman takes up the book that has lain near the penguin rookery and begins to read to us. "Here, then, tonight we have reached the end of our tether, and all we have done is to show the immensity of this vast plain ... ." Reading and performance end together. One final time, the scene points to the quilt of attitudes (explorers', their contemporaries', our own) that con- jures bed-time story out of bed-time story, valued antique out of eternal present, myth out of history.

And yet, the closing chord, in its hard particularity and intensity, resists time's meltings and generational claims. Ulti- mately, the emotion is singular, the voice unique, dead, unknowable. "... on the vast expanse that one's mind conceives one knows there is neither tree, nor shrub, nor any living thing, nor even inanimate rock - nothing but this terrible limitless expanse of snow. It has been so for countless years, and it will be so for countless more. And we, little human insects, have started to crawl over this awful desert, and are now bent on crawling back again. Could anything be more terrible than this silent, wind- swept immensity when one thinks such thoughts?" (Robert F. Scott, The Voyage of the "Discovery," 1905). 18 Since much has been written recently about the history of the Mabou Mines and the growth of Akalaitis's aesthetic within it, 19 I suggest that a relatively detailed descrip- tion and analysis of one piece, which in turn might feed the summary inquiry into aspects of Performance Art, would be more useful here than a recapitulation of com- pany style.20 Clearly, then, once again we have a performance collage in which performers, audi- ence, text, film, slides, set, lights, props, costumes, and live, miked and recorded sound interact dialectically to evoke ironic layers of thought and feeling. These raw elements, generic to the whole, are always present in varying combination and design and I have tried to suggest some of their workings-through-collision in the preceding description. Stepping back now to admit larger relations, something like the following pattern emerges. (I have sketched in, above, every major scene of Southern Exposure in order to clarify, in the correspondences that follow, how analytic a collage structure can be.) The primary image contains everything. All that follows is elaboration and texture. PROLOGUE and MOVIE establish the child's world that seduces us into cocreative play; inject the mixture of irony and peril that admits humor but not the safety of comedy; and telescope periods to find the attitudes toward the Antarctic (Rosetta stone, vicarious thrill, casual consumption, exploitation) that are to be mined and that, in combination, define place and subject as the magnetic absence that attracts the best and worst in human nature.

Despite the layers of skepticism embodied in the text's faintly absurd offhand heroism, the woman's sentimental tangents and the man's frequent failures of balance, the attitude to Shackleton and his era here is one of awe and envy, a grief-stricken salute. MIRAGE immediately calls the whole project into doubt - not only art's subject, but art itself, and, by implication, understanding and meaning. BED again textures the whole, retreating from nihilism, but pointing down time's shadows to the dark side of absolute assertion. FOOD textures both the whole and the narrative, on one level assenting to the power of icy ideals in the face of a swollen society, on another despairing of the power of narrative or mimesis to know the unknowable. QUILT remembers PROLOGUE, returning us to ourselves, offering in farewell, finally without irony, a vision of honor and death in societies animal and human - a balance of mysteries. Leading us through these mysteries are the performers - to my mind the most skilled in contemporary avant-garde theatre. Their talents as performers and actors enable them to exist on what appear to be four synchronous levels: on the first, as objects within an abstract design; on the second, as our contemporaries; on the third, as trustworthy guides through circles of ice and time; on the fourth, as tormented wanderers between the worlds of narrative and imitation, performance and acting, objecthood and subjecthood. In the maintenance of such suspended oppositions, irony and self-consciousness become means of survival, as does the mastery of nominally contradictory acting styles. Akalaitis on performance/acting: "I don't know what to call acting anymore; I don't know what it is .... As far as I'm con- cerned anything that works in acting - works .... it's what the moment requires .... the next moment may require something else. In the course of a play, an actor has an opportunity to do a whole bunch of different kinds of acting, including classic Stanislavskian technique. . . . What I wanted was not to manipulate the audience . . . [but] for the actor, for David, to speak directly to the audience and not do any actor tricks . . . not to interpret the text, but give it to the audience, present it to the audience." 21 And yet, to our great good, under the pull of the subject, the time and, perhaps, of something intrinsic to theatre, complications flower. Akalaitis on art: "For a long time I had been thinking about doing a piece that had to do with adventure not aesthetics . . . or contemporary New York art values." 22 And yet, again perhaps inevitably, a modernist consciousness can neither banish art-as-subject nor escape from the burden of formal innovation that has weighed upon our century. While Akalaitis admires contemporary Pop painters Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns (because "they keep making statements which are popularly appealing, deeply mov- ing, and formally complicated"), Southern Exposure shows clear traces of most of the major tendencies of modern art.23 Moving backward from the unitary forms of mid- sixties Minimalism and the Happenings of the fifties (themselves a reprise of Marinetti and the pre-First World War Moscow Futurists), the production seems most at home 21 Private interview held during The New Theatre Festival, Baltimore, June 1979. 22 Interview by William Harris, Soho Weekly News, 22 February 1979, p. 62. 23Akalaitis, Fox interview, p. 79.</page><page sequence="17">180 / TI, May 1984 Southern Exposure.

From Picasso and Braque, the analysis of form, the possibilities of collage, and the answer to the problem of representing three-dimensional forms on a flat surface: "I'm interested in flattening everything out .... ." 24 From de Chirico, Surrealism's precursor and visual grammarian, the use of angles, low light, shadows, body as statue or silhouette; also, evocations of his crisp austerity, his fascination with the atmosphere of place, his com- positional skills and cool ambiguous moods. From Malevich's famous "White-on- White" series, a sensation of infinite space and a dematerialization of form. From Rauschenberg's answering and now almost equally famous seven-panel "White Paint- ing," "the purest possible statement of the idea that life (that is to say environment) can enter directly into art . . . [through] shadows of people passing back and forth . . . light and shade . . . countless . . . reflections" 25 and, I would add, through the projections of the viewer. Excepting Rauschenberg for the moment, it would be surprising if any of the early modern echoes were conscious or intentional. Rather, what is important to see here is only how deeply rooted in modernism many of the so- called "post-modern" works of the current cultural moment are. If, then, the work's Surrealist surface and Cubist structure are merely superb executions of the common- place, its more particular emanations are less so. The made elements, in their inven- tiveness and power, dominate the visual scheme, the found elements (historical slides) 24Akalaitis, Harris interview, p. 62. 25 Calvin Tomkins, The Bride and the Bachelors (New York: Penguin Books, 1976), p. 203.</page><page sequence="18">181 / VERSIONS OF PERFORMANCE ART acting as tenuous anchors to a shadowy past. In the text, the opposite holds, with Akalaitis's writing and improvisational scenarios serving only to condense - or throw into contemporary or contemporaneous context - the undimmed accents of men in extremis. The stillness of the performers reinforces the iconic enterprise, jettisoning the sensory load of psychological illusionism, inviting a relaxed contemplation from which might spring deep and untutored personal response. Finally, despite Rauschenberg's "definitive proof of the impossibility of creating a void," voids and their beauty are much at issue here.26 "Another reason why I'm interested in the South Pole is because it's the only place in which there's no culture, no history, no native human community . . . there are no seasons, there's nothing there ... ."27 Child's vision restored, we enter the milky mir- ror, trailing poet-heroes and nature-gods - Amundsen, Scott, Shackleton, versions all of Empson's White Knight - seeking, in artifice, antidotes to sterility, finding, self- consciously, right relations to nature. If Empson asks of pastoral "the sense of glory," Southern Exposure obliges.28 We turn, now, to an artist of more venomous, though, ultimately, no less elegiac disposition than the two we have considered. We examine the brighter-paletted and harder-edged strands of the modernist legacy. We testify to the ways in which the pressure of expressive need can lead to technological discovery, and to the welcome that the formal catholicity of the style - perhaps its defining virtue - affords such innovation. We watch a magic act - films swallowing human beings - and live through the phenomenological, cultural, and moral disturbance that such formal illu- sions can create.

The whine of an electric motor. Grid surface suddenly glistens in metallic light. Astonishingly, the grid throws no shadow on the sky. Sound stops. Grid rises with heavy clang (and, as I realize later, so does the screen, in perfect synchronism). For a few seconds, we are granted (on the screen behind) the same skyscape, open, free. Then the grid smashes down, the whine returns, more grids (and screens) invade from either side, the angle of surface light shifting again until shimmering layers shut out the sky and enforce flatness. All but one of the screens withdraw, revealing three live figures framed against the remaining grid - a black man bound to a chair and two stylish white thugs standing over him. The black launches a long, shuffling, chuckling rigmarole about love, music, and car trouble in the deep South: ". .. man look I said this don't sound like it's true but they could drop me out in the ocean and I'd swim to the bank . . . ha ha and crawl all back to my baby ... .", a3 In the middle of this I realize that the words aren't issuing from perfectly syncing lips, but rather from the film sound track, and that the voice is that of the great jazz singer, Jimmy Reed. Mean- while, thug number one delicately relieves his victim (singer? performer? fellow- murderer?) of an envelope, then shoots him at point blank range.32 The explosion merges with a word whirling toward us on screen, forties newsreel style, screaming music to match, the banner red letters shouting out the piece's title. Thus begins Per- fidia (treachery). The mood in the audience is a kind of horrified glee. A white Mercedes sedan tries to run the black down in an oil refinery. The man's desperate evasions and labored breath, the famous oncoming hood ornament - now sight-like, implacable - the alarming oranges of road markers and oil tanks, the pseudo-menacing music (a loop from From Russia With Love), all encourage the most familiar sort of Pop thrill. And yet the whiff of a real satirist's rage and the threat of midstream betrayals of perceptual compacts discourage relaxation. The film switches to black and white and freezes at the kill. The screen rises on a black and white cocktail party in tableau: six figures (including the black) in elegant evening dress, holding glowing tulip glasses, chatting in four languages (French, Spanish, German, English), oblivious of the agonized still now behind them. Stiff, minimal movement, many freezes and non-sequiturs, all words, sound and music - banal Spanish-style muzak - as before, on track. Hideous sneers, obscene laughs, the butler, Jeeves, cir- culating. The black and white freeze-frame has dissolved into heavy, red, gathered drapes. As one is marvelling at the fact that these very emblems of solidity are on film, not a slide, and that their image neither shadows nor is shadowed by life's polite murderers ("they kill with telephone calls, they kill with meetings"), they shatter like glass, smashing to the floor in a great clatter as the ubiquitous screen wipes out the scene. 33 A wealthy looking couple, facing upstage, umbrella held up between them.

"Do you feel guilty at all? I do. /Guilty? How awfully nice you are." The dialogue, cut up and moved around, is from Noel Coward's Brief Encounter, the voices those of Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson. In the audience, giggles of delighted recognition. On the screen, headlights approach, fade; a giant male hand in gleaming watch and white leather driving glove plays with an egg. On the sound track, a wailing sax. The glamour is somehow horrible, the eroticism necrophilic, and yet the humor and perfect facture are irresistible. A half-screen moves out, revealing more thugs - one in shades, seated facing us, haranguing three, standing facing him, backs to us. The voice is Basil Rathbone's, the words are Hawthorne's in Young Good- man Brown. "This night it shall be granted you to know their secret deeds ... how fair damsels . . . have dug little graves in the garden, and bidden me, the sole guest, to an infant's funeral .... behold the whole earth one stain of guilt, one mighty blood spot." From the lovers (Hawthorne's "only pair ... yet hesitating on the verge of wickedness"?): "We're adults after all. /How awfully nice you are." "Evil is the nature of mankind .... Welcome again, my children, to the communion of your race." Ini- tiation over, one of the black suits hurries out midst laughter and talk of maps, state secrets, while the other three swing into a swift sequence of Mafia-like embraces and kisses. Fast, chattering music; thick, black and white stripes sliding across the screen, now mirroring, now reversing, the lateral tottentanz before them. On the chair, between flat and solid, a woman in a shiny scarlet jumpsuit runs through a series of circular high-fashion figures, randomly sparked by a white pinspot. The lovers depart, leaving their suspended umbrella behind. It was not real. A blow-up of a digital clock, neon red on flat charcoal ground, huge numbers rac- ing down from 269 to 000. On the sound track, a synchronized little round - "tick- tock . .. goes the clock . . . tick-tock . Under the drone of approaching bombers, two men (Bertie and Jeeves from an earlier scene) fight in slow motion in near darkness. Movement and choreography are flawless, the battle savage and relentless. A woman in a floor-length, white, pleated dress appears and calmly sits. Slave kicks master to death and disappears. The victim lifts and turns his upper body. It is a different man - on his head a huge pair of horns, lit from within. His face rising, his horns glowing more intensely, he slowly crawls over to her and lays his head on her lap. He stretches a hand out to us. Her face is calm, wistful, clear. Mystery and terror intensify as we see a man and woman (she of the white Grecian robe) standing in two open, parallel but separate, Art Deco-ish door frames in the middle of a cloud-filled evening sky. Overlapping one edge of her frame are three enormous neon letters, N O T, read vertically downward. The figures do not move; the clouds do. I find I cannot tell what is dimensional and what is not. Almost imper- ceptibly, the whole revolves through 1800. At one point, there is the hint of a third figure (male) in the background. The faces "express" nothing, yet contain much fear and suffering. At the end of the turn, the woman steps off upstage, the "doors" swing away and descending screens transform open to closed, above to below, sky to deepest jungle. The man has not moved; his fear and action are continuous.

The man's terror is palpable; he starts at every sound. He appears to be alone, until what had appeared to be foliage moves, metamorphising into a terrible figure in glittering ceremonial robe, porcelain-like mask and jewelled and mirrored headdress. The chalky features are delicate, the eyes slits, the expression implacably inward. Like some prehistoric Pop goddess - her exterior, in fact, a copy of the madonna in the cathedral of Cordoba - she advances, knife in hand, upon her prey, drawing enor- mous power from one of the production's rare vertical moves. A ritual thrust, a falling body, a mask whipped off, an obscenely triumphant male Pop-horror laugh. Killer and victim duplicate their earlier war-shadowed struggle, duplicate its result. And so this splendid, murderous pageant winds to a close. There will be more dazzling deaths - at one point four levels on stage together; more dazzling people and things; more dazzling betrayals of mind, eye, and utopian longings; but the vision's rawest energies are spent. The last image, one of the most powerful and pessimistic in my memory, rings variations of the first. On screen, a steel wall. Welded into it, a huge sardine can. The key turns on its own, the can opens, the window panel sliding out in immaculate sync. In the can, the live upper torso of a man in evening dress; behind him, white cloud- puffs drifting across a blue sky. He "speaks," the voice that of Padraic Colum reading from his Irish Tales: "The best way to get to Blarney Castle is to walk here - to walk there, I mean, from the town of Cork. You will go to Patrick's Bridge. You will walk along the quays. You will pass Shandon Church whose bells a poet has made famous .... And the valley which Blarney Castle dominated is then before you." Without moving, the figure disappears. Silence. We are left with nature's patch and the works of man. Studio Scarabee was founded in The Hague in 1965 by the Dutch painter, Adri Boon. An outgrowth of Boon's experiments with Happenings in the early sixties, Scarabee quickly achieved prominence as one of Europe's most original avant-garde companies. In America, it is almost unknown, having performed only in Baltimore (1977 and 1980) and Greensboro, N.C., and San Francisco (1980). Since their Happening-inspired Spiraal (Spiral) of 1965, Boon and his alternating but steady col- laborators, Jan van As and Raf Thunnissen, have made eight pieces.34 They are Lorca (1966), an oratorio-like work with live music, based on some of Lorca's poems; 35 Bat- man in Ballingschap (Batman in Exile, 1967); Poppetgom (1968), in collaboration with the painter/poet, Lucebert, "The Unnamed Singer (Mary Servaes), the queen of the 'tearjerker' genre," 36 and the late composer/conductor, Bruno Maderna; Fata Banana (1971), the first production ever simulcast on both Dutch TV channels, and the first to offer common visual but divergent sound tracks, between which the audience was invited to alternate; Witstrip (White Comic Strip, 1973), a made-for-TV film commis- 34 Nico Scheepmaker, "Striking Poses," Insight Holland, supplement to Holland Herald, Vol. 15, No. 1, p. 27. 35 Boon, private interview held in Baltimore, Md., January 1980. 36 Scheepmaker, p. 27.</page><page sequence="25">188 / TI, May 1984 Perfidia.

Perfidia, which runs 68 minutes, 34 seconds and 12 frames, took a year and a half and cost a quarter of a million dollars (all from the Dutch government) to make. The principal influences on Boon's aesthetic have been the Happenings of the late fifties and early sixties; Surrealism (Magritte, de Chirico, Borges, Marquez, Cortizar, Lorca); sixties Pop; the hard-edge Minimalists of the late sixties and early seventies; and such spokesmen for the new "objectivity" in literature as Alain Robbe-Grillet.37 Once again, however, perhaps even more interesting than such clear and conscious debts are the ways in which a work produced at the tail end of the modernist tradition betrays the lineage of aspects of that tradition that are no longer remembered as original, but rather have been absorbed into an aesthetic collective unconscious. Boon, for example, denies particular knowledge of or interest in the Bauhaus.38 And yet, not only did the general form and idea of his highly technological, multi-media, visually oriented total performance begin there, quite particular aspects of his practice received their first systematic tests in the studies of Bauhaus artists. In Oscar Schlem- 37 Boon, private interview. 38Ibid.</page><page sequence="26">189 / VERSIONS OF PERFORMANCE ART mer's productions, "Pace and gesture, figure and prop, color and sound, all had the quality of elementary form .... transforming dancers and actors into moving archi- tecture." 39 From the scenario for Schlemmer's The Figural Cabinet 1: "Imperturbably the window-shade roller unwinds, showing colored squares, an arrow and other signs, comma, parts of the body, numbers, advertisements: 'Open a Commercial Account,' 'Kukirol,' . .. At each side abstract linear figures ... . "0 From Laszlo Moholy-Nagy issued theory and experiment aimed at placing man "on an equal footing with the other formative media"; at projecting film "onto various surfaces"; at mixing film and live action; at using sound as an assaultive weapon and conceiving costumes "for single moments of action and capable of sudden transformations" (there are forty costume changes in Perfidia). Color is to find its absolute values, leading to "the supremacy of pure and luminous chromatic tones," and away from "The pallid face, the subjectivity of expression ... ." Stage space is to be divided into free-standing and distinct levels and planes. "We envision TOTAL STAGE ACTION... as a great dynamic-rhythmic process, which can compress the greatest clashing masses . . . of media.., into elemental form."41 In both men, there was the determination "to approach the human word 'unliterarily,' in its primary state, as a happening, as if it were being heard for the first time"; to declare that "the art of the stage is a spatial art"; and to admit "a real feeling of involvement with the world and life."42 Finally, a description of Gropius's Bauhaus stage, with its cubic quality, its sectional floor of variable heights, and its ceiling tracks for sliding walls, screens or curtains, could apply as well to Scarabee's magic box.43 Let us now try to pick up on some of these sixty year old clues to that box's mysteries. Based on interviews, a workshop with Boon, the writings of collaborators, and live or film viewings of four pieces, the following thoughts occur. In form and in attitude towards content, the work makes a continuum. Boon: "I do not separate pieces .... It never starts . . . it never ends."4" In process, the beginning is always theme, around which images are free-associated and to which text, sound, music, and performers are added. Although music is occasionally composed, it is more usually found, as are text and sound. In Perfidia, for example, Boon wrote nothing, finding the words he needed in Hemingway, Hawthorne, Coward, Reed, P. G. Wodehouse, Carl Sternheim (Die Hose), Colum, popular songs and poems, and other sources. While there is much improvisation and collaboration in early stages, Boon retains control of the text, which is montaged and prerecorded (the performers in Perfidia make no sound). Simultaneously, he and others make detailed storyboards, following which filming and performer rehearsals begin. Once sound and film tracks are set and matched, the performers' freedom to vary timing and physical placement (often by so much as a second or an inch) is eliminated. The projector sets in motion a machine 39Walter Gropius, The Theater of the Bauhaus (Middletown, Ct.: Wesleyan University Press, 1961), p. 9. 40Oscar Schlemmer, cited in Gropius, p. 40. 41 Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, cited in Gropius, pp. 57-70. 42Schlemmer, cited in Gropius, pp. 91, 85. 43 Ibid., p. 83. 44 Private interview.</page><page sequence="27">190 / TL, May 1984 both figurative and literal. As the program says, "Perfidia is instant theatre. It can be repeated but it cannot be reproduced." Boon's combining of film-as-structure and film-as-environment for live performers constitutes the basic formal tension in his work. The environment is achieved through the use of "in-the-camera-mattes," a technique pioneered by Norman Dawn in 1907 for his "Missions of California." During shooting, only a portion of the film is exposed, a mask covering the remainder. The film is then rewound and exposed again with a dif- ferent mask. The frame-by-frame visual is thus built up in phases, the group having superimposed as many as 45 images onto a single shot. This tedious and demanding method, which enables a human body to move and live inside a projected image that is itself moving and living but that is incomplete without its human inhabitant (the performer's absence would leave a blank in his shape on the screen), is the technical key to Boon's black book of hours. The images themselves - sonic, verbal, visual - are drawn from both high and low culture, are aggressively contemporary, highly charged, and usually parodic. Words, which often carry overt moral freight, are honored by the voices that speak them even as they are distorted by the audience through prisms of critical or contrasting visuals. This interest in the war between ear and eye is a constant in Scarabee's work. A brief inventory: clocks, telephones, machines, buzzers, shots, movie music, nightclub music, elevator music, ad music, cello sonatas, synthesizers, languages, laughs, coughs, chokings, screams, sneers, shouts, silence; beautiful cars, beautiful women, beautiful clothes, beautiful food, beautiful men, beautiful sentiments, beautiful art; pills, bills, boots, bulbs, arrows, numbers, targets, flags (the impact of Johns evident here); Op effects, maze effects, stripes, diamonds, circles, grids; STOP signs, GO signs, bombs, enemas, riots, war; crowds, rallies, bullfights, man as mass; lips, lipstick, breasts, behinds, bikinis, woman as object; man as robot, puppet, rat, ball in a maze of balls, ego, beast, machine, thing. Sky, clouds, moon, bodies, hills, grass, nature. Such serried cruelties are driven through consistent real-time schemes by the beat of Scarabee's ubiquitous clocks. Rhythmic and textural contrasts are gained by playing off intense color against black and white or beige/tan/off-white grounds; highly kinetic scenes against still ones; verbal scenes against silent or sound-soaked ones; three dimensional imagery against two dimensional, live against filmed; hard, satiric Pop scenes against ambigu- ous Surrealist invitations; tightly controlled set pieces against wild, primal releases. Even as Moholy-Nagy's "great dynamic-rhythmic process" is achieved, the Bauhaus' technological utopianism is mocked by what is possibly the most technologically sophisticated theatre in the world. In the context of this sketch of Scarabee's history, influences, modernist lineage, working process, and general style, I now would like to narrow the analysis by bisect- ing the term Performance Art and looking at Perfidia from the resulting dual perspec- tive. From the purely plastic point of view, the grid is clearly the central metaphor. By opening with his grid dance, Boon uncovers his secrets (grids guide the in-camera- mattes), announces his modernity, excludes perspective, realizes surface, rejects nar- 45 For a view of the significance of the grid in contemporary art and performance, see Rosalind Krauss, "Grids," October 9 (Summer 1979), 51-64).</page><page sequence="28">191 / VERSIONS OF PERFORMANCE ART rative or sequential reading of any kind, and enforces spatial viewing.45 By incor- porating his flattened and stylized mass-media imagery into a time art, Boon releases his audience from realistic expectations of time, space, and psychology and, in so doing, reestablishes in a performance context the iconic function of painting, wherein every aesthetic, however abstract, embodies allusively a way of experiencing life. The lack of perspective and shadow makes the world appear ephemeral, a fantasy, resis- tant to meaning, opaque. As in Magritte's The Human Condition, "the 'picture' hides the real" and "splinters ... the visual world."46 ". . . in classical painting, a body, object, or figure does not really conceal another body; the crystallographic structure of the mathematical space allows one to infer the concealed parts from the visible ones." In Magritte's - and Boon's - "a focal and amorphous space .... on the con- trary, we are never certain as to the nature of that which remains hidden; the part that is veiled can differ from that which is visible ... ."47 This uncertainty about the stability of the visual world is, I suggest, the prime source of anxiety for both the inhabitants and the audience of Perfidia. The seminal treachery is the one practiced by the unknown upon the known. To intensify unease, Boon seals his space. Contrary to most theatre, in which characters enter and leave and so establish a space coextensive with the world, Boon's action almost never breaks its frame. That the resulting hermetic canvas is hospitable to Perfidia's subjective visions of nightmare and longing is not surprising. Much more so is the welcome it provides to the flood of popular imagery that is the piece's main subject. Torn from their neon wilderness, Boon's people and things do not live only as clinical pawns on a didactic board. Rather, charged, glossy, funny, appetizing, they retain their autonomy as independent icons of existence and, by so doing, implicate us in their amoral vitality. The world thus re-enters the canvas as we re-enter the world. The cool strategies of sixties Pop - "the slick surfaces, alienated objectivity, gigan- tism . . serial imagery . .. hard edges and simplified graphic images" - distance.48 The closed and subjective space, the beauty of facture and the brilliance of wish- fulfillment - seduce. If Pop art artificially remythologizes popular myth and so becomes "a mode of artistic resistance," Scarabee's collusions do not wholly assent to such sanguine ironies.49 Uncontestable, however, is Boon's "desire to reject various narrative codes and mimetic conventions," which brings me to the closing issues of performance and genre.50 One consequence of Boon's desired rejections - one shared by all the artists under discussion here, as well as by such contemporary painters as Chuck Close, Alfred Leslie, and Andy Warhol - is the presentation of the human face as "a kind of still life - a searing commentary on the alienation of contemporary life."51 Psychologically, the cultural type that the performer is demonstrating appears alter- 46Clair, 102, 103. 47Ibid., p. 103. 48 Barbara Rose, American Painting: The Twentieth Century (New York: Rizzoli International Publica- tions, Inc., 1980), p. 118. 49Allen Thiher, "Postmodern Dilemmas: Godard's Alphaville and Two or Three Things That I Know about Her," boundary 2 (Spring 1976), 951. 5OIbid., p. 953. 51 Rose, p. 130.</page><page sequence="29">192 / TI, May 1984 nately oblivious of, bouyed up on, or terrified by the image in which he dwells, whereas, formally, the performer himself is its puppet. The combination of this unset- tling tension with the equally unsettling and forceful facial mask evokes a world of bestial automata stranded in an emotional void. It is important to realize, however, that this last feeling - for it is more a mood than an insight - is a desolation created in us, by purely formal means, and that it has nothing to do with the feelings of either portrayers or portrayed, which are in the main unknowable. Joining Perfidia's phenomenological treachery, then, is the treachery of feeling and the knowledge of feeling - both performed as much by the piece on its viewers as by the piece on its inhabitants and its inhabitants on each other. From these germinal and yoked betray- als flow all the secondary ones: the betrayals of men by women, women by men, and nature by man; the deceit of friends, races, masters, and servants; the masks of religion and philosophy; the mirage of culture. Time cancelled by collage, the work's progressively darkening textures press upon what feels like a hellish and endless pres- ent. A satiric vision of a murderous world edges toward a near-tragic vision of the impossibility of ever knowing another, with murder as the last despairing embrace - a purely existentialist conclusion. Yet the lack of a moral norm anywhere in the work and the attendant rejection of the possibility of self-knowledge retreat from the tragic, from irony's end. Among the approaches to The Beggar's Opera that Empson offers to demonstrate the ironic range of mock-pastoral are these: "I feel quite grateful to these fools; they make me feel sure I am right because they are so obviously wrong," adding in his own voice "(in this hopeful form satire is widely used to 'keep people going' after loss of faith)"; and "this always happens; no human distinction between high and low can be accepted for a moment; Christ on earth found no fit company but the thieves," adding again "(none of them [mock-pastoralists] accepted the full weight of the anar- chy of this . . .)."52 Simply to place Perfidia under such commonly linked strategies as satire and mock-pastoral (every man a Macheath, lord of the wasteland) is to evade this anarchy and the ease with which it incinerates the perches from which we "keep .. . going." Overwhelmed by the work's formal genius, seduced by its gorgeous and icy look, we thrill equally at everything, arsonists all, the only distinctions those of sensation. Even as we suspect that this too is a satiric device (for must satire not escape the defangings of aesthetic assimilation?), and that our crimes duplicate and confirm those on view, our shameful and secret parts cry, with Goodman Brown, "Come devil; for to thee is this world given." Here are some definitions of Performance Art, two from dance critics (Banes, Kisselgoff) and two from editors of journals largely devoted to performance (Mar- ranca, O'Connor): ". . . total theater, defying categorization because it includes all the arts, or . . . a live time-art that is just the opposite of a gesamtkunstwerk, isolating ... a single aspect of performance . . . .". ". .. an anti-theatrical form that displaces illusion with real time, character with personality, skill with spontane- ity, artifice with the banal. It values idea over execution .. .

A broad defin- ing overlaps with stabler media (theatre, dance, film) in so many ways that it becomes useless. A narrow one risks a silly exclusivity. Therefore, I limit the following remarks to those aspects of Performance Art illuminated by the three works at issue, except where correspondences to comparable work point to broader patterns. My intent is neither normative nor prescriptive. As we have seen, the imagery of Performance Art in our triad of works comes from both life and art and analyzes both life and art. On first sight, each of the three stages-Chong's bare floor and shadow screen, Akalaitis's color abstraction, and Boon's black box and white screen - is a tabula rasa, a machine to cleanse visual and mental palettes. The analysis is performed by two types of images - of fact and of desire. The proportion of each varies by artist, but both are necessary to balance exte- rior and interior worlds within the work. The neat separation of function that this implies is, of course, ephemeral, part of the fascination of the work lying in sudden fusions of realms - miniature cows on a realistic deck, the wrapping of a foot transformed by a time shift into a near-mythic act. The incorporation of images from life traces its lineage back through Pop Art, Happenings, John Cage and Duchamp to the Cubist assemblages of the early century. Such images rely upon the common association for their "found" meaning, and upon their place in the context of the work (in Duchamp, the context of the gallery alone) for their "made" one. Since they can never entirely lose their primary charge, the artist, in effect, gains instant and manipulable access to the collective unconscious, with all its attendant emotional and perceptual baggage. What Susan Sontag has said about photographs - "they offer at one and the same time a connoisseur's relation to the world and a promis- cuous acceptance of the world"57- and the pleasure we take in them-"Poignant longings for beauty, for an end to probing below the surface, for a redemption and celebration of the body of the world" 58 - can also be said of the quotational aspect of Performance Art, itself so bound up with the photograph. Parallel charges of amoral image-mongering and passive consumerism can be and have been made.59 In the more complex work, however, the world collected is placed in tension with a world envi- sioned, one of the prime indicators of quality being the degree to which the created image matches the ready-made in resonance and felt rightness. The created image is 55 Anna Kisselgoff, "The Changing Avant-Garde," The New York Times, 24 December 1981, Sect.

Sliding through scale and period, joining fact and desire, fascinating, mysterious, opaque, it exactly complements the discontinuity, fascina- tion, mystery, and opaque surface of the photographic world view.60 If one accepts, with Sontag, that "The arts in which Surrealism has come into its own are prose fic- tion . . . theater, the arts of assemblage, and - most triumphantly - photography," 61 then Performance Art, which incorporates aspects of all, is the Surreal art for a Sur- real time. Without withdrawing this conclusion, I suggest that none of our three pieces is a dream work in the normal Freudian sense. Although the artists may choose naivete as a strategy, they are not themselves naive. The images in Humboldt's Cur- rent, Southern Exposure, and Perfidia feel random only in rare lapses from their works' hard interior logic. The fact that the logic is both emotional and rational does not prevent it from generating an internally coherent set of references, on which the audience can rest, and within which it can subjectivize. The ability of the image - any image - to stop time, and so admit the subjective, is its central appeal to the perform- ance artist. Breuer compares it to shifting into neutral in a speeding car: "It's really kind of sad. Because this vital neutral, this permission to subjectivize, I have seen extended with great good will to the performance of dance, of music, at the gallery, at poetry 'readings.' I have seen it extended by tourists to scenic overlooks in the Smokeys. But theatre is action. If it stops, you have to blow your horn. To make theatre 'wait' for poetry, it must invoke another formal discipline that permits waiting - music - the Brechtian song, the musical 'number,' dance, the dumb show, the mime, the ballet. In the theatre of images of the '70s, the permission comes from the gallery by way of performance art." 62 Brief notes on two more aspects of the image: flatness/depth and artifice. At the start of each work, the image is flat in two ways, literally and, lacking context, figuratively. As the web of association spins, a tension develops between the emotion / thought/ depth we are investing in the image and its resistant literal opacity. This central tension is a source of pleasure and pain, attracting us to the unyielding mystery of the world, repelling in us that which would possess it. The power of artifice to summon intense feeling is a truism often forgotten in practice because of its apparent conflict with the assumptions of mimesis. We are reminded of that power by three contrasting abstractions of violence. Chong shows us a man pouring red powder into a bowl of water, then washing his hands in red water. The shock of bloody hands - always an idea in art, but here undimmed by failed illu- sion - is pristine. Akalaitis's performers read us, in simple uninflected tones, an account of violence, becoming, in effect, transparencies for the imagination. Boon's cartoon beasts throw their charge from their humorous stage onto the closing circuits of our knowledge of the real. Thus does the anti-illusionism that is as much a credo of Performance Art as it is a principle of pictorial modernism sharpen invention when confronted with figurative problems in a time art. The texts of Performance Art come from everywhere and every time. The world's literature is available for plunder. When the selecting and editing are done well, a kind 6o Sontag, p. 20. 61 Ibid., p. 47. 62Lee Breuer, "Staging Poetry," The Village Voice, 26 May 1980, p. 88.</page><page sequence="32">195 / VERSIONS OF PERFORMANCE ART of unearned authority is gained, as reality is incorporated without imitation or inter- pretation. Again, a measure of the work's quality is the degree to which the visual imagery (whether in supportive or ironic relation) and, in fact, the work as a whole, succeed in matching the presence and authenticity of the chosen words. Because col- lage rules out the dramatic mode (except in the most fragmentary way), the language of Performance Art tends toward the expository, the descriptive, and the lyric. This may account for the frequent use of diaries and biographies and also, in part, for the strong autobiographical element in the works of Chong, Foreman, Wilson, Gray, LeCompte, Monk, Breuer, and, in more limited ways, Akalaitis. (All of these people are not necessarily performance artists, though all have worked in the vein of the style and all share many of its assumptions.) Whatever the nature of the text, its use introduces into the work the issue of meaning, and, relatedly, introduces a tension between the comparative singularity and transparency of commonly held verbal meaning and the inherent plurality and opacity of the meaning of the image. This tension, which is irre- solvable, anchors the work between objective and subjective worlds, much in the manner of the tension between found imagery and made. Of the fixed arts - architecture, sculpture, painting - Schlemmer said: "They are momentary, frozen motion. Their nature is the immutability of not an accidental but a typified condition, the stability of forces in equilibrium." 63 The use of the human body as the raw material of art confronts the performance artist with a struggle between the typified and the accidental. The composition broken by motion must somehow be reunified in in-motion-fixedness. Slow, careful motion, intercut with stillness (Chong and Akalaitis), does it in one way. Furious and near-constant motion, motion as prin- ciple (Boon), does it in another way. In every case, the typified condition, which must embrace all the work's elements without itself changing, is conceived less as a proscenium-sized proto-image than as the controlling mood of the piece as a whole. The desire for abstraction in movement is reflected in the prominence of dancers in the work (half of Boon's extraordinary cast are dancers); in the use of masks, puppets and puppet-like people (a recent Chong piece is called The Articulated Man); and in the frequent execution of task or "found movements" by the performers. 4 The presence of performers rather than actors is generally thought to be the single most decisive ele- ment separating Performance Art from theatre. Performers are themselves, exist in real time, and perform or "do" the various tasks or activities that the piece requires. Actors impersonate others, exist in stage time, and respond to their characters' inner psychological promptings. The performer, with his face-as-still-life, is the solution to the "problem" of character. This pervasive distrust of representation stems, I suspect, partly from embarrassment at the debased psychologisms of much realistic theatre, with its sentimentality, its unitary view of personality, its neat solutions and lack of mystery; partly from a hatred of character emotion - "you know, the mouth drawn down to show sorrow and the tear trembling in the eye" - that is part of a visual arts tradition at least as old as Duchamp and the Dadaists; and partly from the under- standable fear or disinterest that artists from one medium might feel when faced with 63 Schlemmer, cited in Gropius, p. 22. 64 Yvonne Rainer, cited in Roger Copeland, "The Neoclassical Task," New Performance, Vol. 2, No. 3, 56.</page><page sequence="33">196 / Ti May 1984 mastering the intricacies of another.65 (It should be said here that in none of the three pieces are the performers only "themselves." The ones directed by Boon and Chong [a painter and a graphic artist/film-maker, respectively], while involved in Brechtian demonstrations of character-as-type, realize their essential energies in their thrust toward the ideal of body-as-form. The performers directed by Akalaitis [whose background is primarily in theatre], on the other hand, are most deeply invested in their several approaches to the acting process, while simultaneously executing the more objective purposes of the work that houses them. For this reason alone, I would not, strictly, consider Southern Exposure a Performance Art piece, but rather one that mines the rich and treacherous ground between Performance Art and theatre.) I suspect, however, that the distinction between performer and actor eventually faces a problem that has nothing to do with methodology. Human beings on a stage can never be pure abstractions. This does not mean, of course, that they must act (in any sense of that word) representationally. They can act presentationally. Or not act at all. Whatever they do or don't do, our common humanity will make us project thought and feeling upon them and interpret the thought and feeling (and, short of sleep or death, there will be such) that they project upon us and each other. If one then narrows the distinction between performer and actor to the kind and degree of mind/emotion being exchanged, one finds that the difference, though still useful in characterizing a highly particular style, has lost its absoluteness. A consequence of this encroachment by theatre on Performance Art's territory is that our perception of the performer is at least double, and more usually multiple. I, therefore, suggest that the performer-related tensions set up by the style are those between the performer and his abstract dwelling, the performer and his own putative abstraction, and our delight in, and awareness of the failure of, the abstract enterprise. In place of plot, Performance Art offers multi-media fragments of a single subject that are then textured in a spatial organization across the work. In attempting to cap- ture a series of images in a moment of simultaneous apprehension, the method, which is inherently Cubist, recalls Cubist collages, Surrealist collages, assemblages, and Happenings (collage with people, in time). The power of the quoted fragment (image, sound, text, music) lies in its inherent cultural value, its value from life, one measure of the structural quality of the work being the degree to which the collage forces fresh vision through new context without dimming the found vitality and autonomy of the quotation. Broken raw materials fuel broken stagings that refuse beginnings and end- ings, stop or start in mid-sentence, and cut without inflection between media and from scene to scene. By avoiding the complications, resolutions, and narrative arcs that audiences have always known to be unreal (even as they have felt their necessity), per- formance artists establish a radical realism, one that rejects a traditional function of art - the imposition of pattern upon time, fixity upon flux. In the best work, this loss is partially recouped by an extraordinary precision of facture, by the consistency of the analytic rhythm between found and made, and by the compulsion of overall mood. Here two ironies occur. While Brechtian contrasts sting the intellect at the moment of impact, their transmission through the glitter of many media and within 65 Robert Rauschenberg, cited in Tomkins, p. 236.</page><page sequence="34">197 / VERSIONS OF PERFORMANCE ART the energizing current of mood swamps distance and reaffirms the Surrealism inherent in collage. One can view this result either as a softness in the style or as a realistic subordination of mind to the discontinuities of contemporary experience. Secondly, it is not entirely true that collage excludes narrative. Things do happen to Humboldt, to Shackleton, to Boon's relentless plotters. Yet, so simple and vast are these movements that narrative disappears into theme (the lethal blindness of the Faustian endeavor, the failures of bravery and the bravery of failure, the tottentanz of the spiritless). Theme is then elaborated in intricately rhythmic and spatially weighted media-arabesques, which, in turn, complete the transition from meaning to mood. Thus, despite the fact that story-telling is a subject of one of the works, does story become mood; and thus do mood, theme, and story come to feel inevitable. This tide of pleasurable compul- sion is, I suggest, the other irony lurking in the structure of the style, for there is not an artist among our three - and many others besides - who does not despise the directed response, the point of attention, the "fascism of the center," of conventional theatre. Lest the preceding imply that Performance Art rests on mere seduction, I would stress that, in the more complex work, mood achieves the force of a vision of the world, a vision earned through the interplay of intuitive and analytic modes, both of which are clearly visible in passage. Formally, art is its own subject in all three works. This tendency derives, I suspect, partly from the obsession with perception that is endemic to modernism; partly from century-old assumptions that reality is multiple and objective truth unknowable; partly from the powerful influence of formalist painters like Jasper Johns and Frank Stella; and partly, perhaps, from the simple exhilaration of breaking new ground. Countering solipsism is the fact that both photography and theatre resist abstraction, as photo image and performer - pieces of the world - demand coextensive relations with the world.66 The three subjects so reestablished all have overt connections to nature and the pastoral or mock-pastoral world view. Akalaitis's icy slate, Boon's urban wasteland, and Chong's Conradian progress in the wake of the "beast" all recall Shakespeare's use of green worlds and heaths. Nature-as-test encompasses both the anthropomorphic sense of the term - the nature that is symbolic of the mysterious forces of our own natures - and the equally ancient pastoral sense of the edenic world from which the imagination reproves the desolations of the real. Particularly strong in the two American pieces (and, in fact, in much of the work in New York) is the pastoral (and Romantic and Victorian) envy of the child, the ". . . feeling . . . that no way of building up character, no intellectual system, can bring out all that is inherent in the human spirit, and therefore that there is more in the child than any man has been able to keep."67 ". . . from Surrealism . . . to the various forms of Aleatory art, the . . . desire is present to abdicate and simplify and regain a child-like immer- sion in the totality of Being." 68 This desire, so deep a vein in the history of modernism, finds full expression in the uses of naivete" (as formal strategy and/or as subject) in the three works. Which brings up, in conclusion, the linked issues of time and tone. 66 Sontag, pp. 83, 85-86. 67Empson, pp. 260-61. 68 Jacques Barzun, The Use and Abuse of Art (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1975), pp. 81-82.</page><page sequence="35">198 / TI, May 1984 Four levels of time obtain. The demonstrated 'characters" exist in conventional stage time, while the performers, from within their "roles," frequently execute tasks or activities in real time. This duality, which upsets our usual relationship to character, paradoxically offers an immediacy of event while placing the idea of character itself at far and objective remove. Concurrently, the interplay between stage time and real time exists within a sense of an arrested present, of performance-as-suspended- moment, that the temporal cross-hatchings of collage evoke. Finally, this web of time is enfolded in a feeling of pastness that dominates each piece and that I have felt in every Performance Art work that I have seen. The sources of this feeling are, perhaps, two-fold, embedded in qualities of collage and photography. Here is Pasolini on mon- tage: ". .. as soon as montage intervenes . . . the present becomes the past .... Death performs a lightning-quick montage on our lives; that is, it chooses our truly significant moments . . . places them in sequence, converting our present, which is infinite, unstable, and uncertain, and thus linguistically indescribable, into a clear, stable, certain, and thus linguistically describable past . ... It is thanks to death that our lives become expressive. Montage thus accomplishes for the material of film . . . what death accomplishes for life."69 Here, again, is Sontag on the photograph: "All photographs are memento mori. To take a photograph is to participate in another per- son's (or thing's) mortality, vulnerability, mutability. Precisely by slicing out this moment and freezing it, all photographs testify to time's relentless melt."70 While Pasolini's principle of selection through death is not limited to collage - being also applicable, for example, to a playscript - in combination with the pastness of the photograph it imposes an inescapable melancholy upon the work of Performance Art. The artists seem, at once, to admit and repel this feeling of loss. They exploit it in their choice of biographical and autobiographical subjects. They attempt to defeat it in the aggressively current, technological texture and the wit, humor, and ironic tone of much of their work.71 Their use of naivete typifies their ambivalence. On the one hand, the child's view of the world transcends death by symbolizing possibilities yet to be realized. On the other, it renders death unflinchingly, turning unguarded eyes upon possibilities betrayed. Thus do artists, in struggling to define the nature of a style, find consonances of feeling between the structure and raw materials of that style and their own utopian longings. Such longings not only energize pastoral and satiric attitudes; they also seek to soften, through elegy, the bitterness of our exhausted cultural moment. In this final retreat alone, I suggest, can Performance Art be seen as an art of escape. 69 Pier Paolo Pasolini, "Observations on the Long Take," trans.
