<plain_text><page sequence="1">RICHARD H. SHRYOCK MEDAL ESSAY ^SUFFICIENT PROMISE: JOHN F. FULTON AND THE ORIGINS OF PSYCHOSURGERY* Jack D. Pressman sag* Psychosurgery, the use of brain operations such as lobotomy or leukot- SSKomy for the alleviation of mental or behavioral disorders, invites a reexamination by historians of medicine. During the heated political debates of the 1970s in which various aspects of medicine were criticized as forms of social control cloaked in the ideology of science, the procedure was denounced as an ultimate form of mind control. Given a combination of psychosurgery's current professional as well as political disfavor, its function as a historical subject has understandably been restricted to educational or polemical uses, a "cautionary tale" of science gone awry. Con- sequently, psychosurgery has been trivialized as a "therapeutic fad," yet another tragic instance in which heterodox physicians temporarily held sway. To the contrary, as Elliot S. Valenstein has recently demonstrated, psy- chosurgery in the 1940s was "not an aberrant event but very much in the mainstream of psychiatry."1 Ironically, a reappraisal of psychosurgery that faithfully recaptures its one-time centrality within psychiatry's therapeutic armamentarium raises more problems than it dispels. As in the case of other popular treatments whose initial therapeutic esteem eventually soured, psychosurgery's sharp reversal in clinical fortune poses the difficult question: why would reason- able, well-meaning physicians and scientists at first value a procedure so highly, only to abandon it later as obviously meritless? As Roger Cooter has argued in discussing phrenology, it is insufficient to state that proponents simply acted unthinkingly until that inevitable time when they "came to their senses"; this does not explain the problem but merely redescribes it.2 * This paper was supported by a Francis C.

PRESSMAN At issue is the nature of medical progress. It is typically presumed that the life course of a medical innovation is determined mostly by that treat- ment's inherent scientific or medical "soundness." Procedures that work, fly, and are assured their place in the medical record; those that do not, crash, and appropriately find only oblivion. Confounding this intuitive model, however, are the many instances in which seemingly unlikely treatments in fact find their way into clinical practice and, for a time, are judged to be bona fide medical boons. To assume that when physicians consider a new treatment they somehow are guided by a special insight into its true clinical value - a value not yet determined - is to impose an unwarranted, although reassuring, teleology. At present, we know little about what influ- ences physicians to embark upon a specific line of clinical investigation, choosing one path from among several, each of whose potential is equally uncertain; even less is known about the process by which a medical com- munity reaches consensus that a new treatment's potential outweighs its risks. Medical innovation is at root a risky, perilous venture; too much emphasis on the study of successful treatments has brushed over this essen- tial feature of the drama of medical inquiry. It is precisely in the study of "failed" therapies that medical historians can find new approaches to these issues.3 Their baroque charms notwith- standing, such topics are valuable in that, as case studies running counter to form, they test comfortable assumptions concerning the introduction, evalu- ation, and diffusion of therapeutic innovations - they are historical "con- trol" samples, one might say. As evidence mounts that supporters of many ill-fated treatments were not acting outside of accepted medical practices, the claim is weakened that their more fortunate counterparts succeeded because of a careful adherence to the standards of "good" scientific medi- cine. The foundations of medical belief can no longer be assumed, but become in their own right important subjects for historical explanation. We must visit the practitioners on their own terms, reconstructing the original circumstances that led them, individually and collectively, to invest their hopes in a promising new remedy. Medical treatments do not possess an inherent clinical attractiveness in the way that physical objects possess mass; rather, clinical assessment is a contingent historical product. My goal is to illuminate the kinds of factors that can significantly influ- ence the assessment of a medical innovation. For the purposes of a case study, I explore the origins and first few years of psychosurgery in America, a period of small clinical trials that preceded the procedure's large-scale application in the nation's state mental hospitals. I focus on the role of Yale physiologist John F. Fulton (1899-1960), whose direct ties to the invention 3 An argument is made for such an approach in Jacques M.

Sa., 1975, 11-. 149-56.</page><page sequence="3">Fulton and Psychosurgery 3 of the operation have been widely acknowledged but whose behind-the- scenes efforts on behalf of the procedure have yet to be narrated.4 In 1949, psychosurgery's prestige as a therapeutic triumph led to the award of the Nobel Prize in medicine to its pioneer, the Portuguese neurol- ogist Egas Moniz (1874-1955). At the time, the award drew criticism not for its impropriety but for being off-target: several contemporaries held that John F. Fulton was the true "father" of psychosurgery and should have shared the prize.5 These sentiments were based on a well-known story which inti- mated that Moniz's inspiration to perform such an operation came from his attendance at the Second International Neurological Congress, held in Lon- don in 1935, where he listened to a paper jointly delivered by Fulton and a junior research associate, Carlyle Jacobsen.6 In Fulton's version of the story, Moniz had heard a description of how brain operations altered the intellect and behavior of two chimpan- zees, Becky and Lucy. In particular, Becky had been a highly emotional animal with a low tolerance for frustration. Failure in an experimental task triggered a tantrum in which Becky rolled on the floor, defecated, or went into a rage. After neurosurgery, however, Becky was profoundly different and no longer prone to such behavioral disturbances. In Jacobsen's words, it was as if the animal had joined a "happiness cult" or had "placed its burdens on the Lord!"7 In discussion, Moniz startled Fulton by asking whether these findings might be applicable to the treatment of depressed human patients. Fulton replied that there was a theoretical basis but as yet the operation probably was "'too formidable" to justify its use.8 Moniz was referring, however, to a much less extensive operation. Instead of completely severing the frontal lobes, as in Becky's and Lucy's lobectomy, Moniz's proposal was to cut small, discrete bores in this region of the brain, in a leukotomy .9 Having access to patients in a psychiatric 4 For John Fulton's complete bibliography, see Madeline Stanton and Elizabeth H.

Fulton kept an account of the congress for his diary, but unfortunately the account was lost. 7 The quote here is from Carlyle Jacobsen, J. B. Wolfe, and T.

PRESSMAN hospital, Moniz persuaded a young neurosurgeon to join him in trying the experimental procedure on a series of twenty subjects. Pleased by the results, Moniz published enthusiastic accounts in several languages, inciting similar trials worldwide.10 Most notable among these were the efforts by the American team of the neurologist Walter Freeman (1895-1972) and his neurosurgical associate, James W. Watts (1904- ). Within six months of receiving Moniz's report Freeman and Watts performed as many operations as had the Portuguese team.11 Over the next fifteen years, psychosurgery became established as the only significant treatment available for cases of severe chronic mental ill- ness, the class of patients thought doomed to lifelong hospitalization; in this period, at least 20,000 such operations were performed in America alone. The Harvard neurologist Stanley Cobb, in his 1949 presidential address to the American Neurological Association, highlighted the procedure's remark- able development: "Seldom in the history of medicine," Cobb declared, "has a laboratory observation been so quickly and dramatically translated into a therapeutic procedure."12 It was clear to those in attendance which laboratory deserved credit for the instigation of psychosurgery. At the same ANA meeting, Cobb paid sardonic tribute to the significance of Fulton and Jacobsen's work by projecting a slide of Becky captioned "The face that lopped ten thousand lobes." In the words of another observer, it was evi- dent that "the shot fired" by Fulton into the frontal lobes of Becky was ultimately "heard round the world."13 I leave in abeyance the issue of whether Fulton was psychosurgery's "father," a cul-de-sac for historians interested in the introduction and dis- semination of new clinical procedures. The problem is more complex than is indicated in the conventional concern with proof of paternity. For the adoption of a new procedure or advance, no matter how "serendipitous" the procedure's origins, occurs within a particular medical community at a specific historical moment. If a medical innovation is to be thought plausi- bly useful and of scientific merit, there must exist a shared conceptual framework and a technical language that can encompass and explain its clinical effects, integrating them into the accepted scientific record.

Psychosurgery's diffusion into the nation's mental hospitals was accelerated by such factors as a lack of therapeutic alternatives in the pre-tranquilizer era, the severe overcrowding and deteriorated conditions in the state hospitals, and a reform movement to upgrade psychiatry's status as a medical specialty. I will discuss this part of psychosurgery's development in a lier work. 13 Fulton to Stanley Cobb, 16 June 1949; Yale Koskoff to Fulton, 15 December 1947.</page><page sequence="5">Fulton and Psychosurgery 5 more, medical communities have a definite social structure as well as an intellectual identity; if a new procedure is to gain attention from re- searchers, the findings of early experiments must be published in important journals and presented before prestigious societies. These activities require the support of influential figures within the professional hierarchy. Success at both levels - intellectual and social - is necessary for a medical innova- tion to traverse the path from laboratory reports to significant clinical trials. In this manner a new treatment becomes singled out as having "sufficient promise," a venture worth the investment of research efforts and their attendant risks. Although Fulton, as we shall see, may not have been psychosurgery's father, he nevertheless played a more important role as its most significant patron. It was due largely to his intervention, both in constructing a scien- tific rationale for the procedure and in employing his considerable profes- sional influence on behalf of its proponents, that convincing clinical trials of the new procedure were realized. In turn, an analysis of the personal moti- vations behind Fulton's efforts, and of the factors that contributed to his success, must take into account the institutional, disciplinary, and profes- sional contexts in which he acted. In 1929, John F. Fulton became the chairman of Yale University's Department of Physiology at the remarkably young age of thirty - the youngest full professor in the university. The protégé of Harvey Cushing and Sir Charles Sherrington, the era's foremost neurosurgeon and neuro- physiologist, respectively, Fulton was groomed to become an international figure in science as well as medicine. As Fulton's appointment coincided with the physical reconstruction of the Yale Medical School, this young sci- entist had the good fortune of launching a career with a laboratory outfitted to his exact specifications.14 This is not the place to do justice to Fulton's meteoric professional as- cent. Intimately involved in the activities of innumerable professional socie- ties, Fulton centered himself within a complex network of research-oriented physiologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuroanatomists, and psychia- trists. Already by 1935, Fulton's reputation and accomplishments allowed Sherrington to name Fulton as his successor at Oxford. Fulton declined the offer (much to the relief of the Yale trustees), believing that his post at Yale provided a better vantage from which to transform neurophysiology. In 1938 Fulton published The Physiology of the Nervous System, a text that was eventually translated into six languages and established him as perhaps his generation's leading authority on neurophysiology. A close observer later 14 Visitors universally commented, Fulton boasted in 1933, that Yale's physiology laboratories were the best equipped in the country; Yale University Department of Physiology, "Annual Report," 1932-33, p. 9.</page><page sequence="6">6 JACK D. PRESSMAN described Fulton as one who truly represented "global medicine" in vision and stature.15 Fulton's lifework was the construction of a coherent model of the nerv- ous system. His specific research interest concerned the "encephalization" of the mammalian central nervous system, the evolutionary process by which the control of various intellectual, sensory, and autonomic functions shifted from "lower" brain systems to newer, "higher" systems. Fulton was self-consciously extending to the entire central nervous system Sherring- ton's depiction of the hierarchical, integrated systems found in spinal cord reflexes.16 An immediate implication of this model was the need to experi- ment on animals more advanced on the evolutionary scale than the cat or the dog, the staple research subject of most physiology laboratories. For this reason, Fulton insisted upon the construction of animal facilities that could support a wide range of primate research and thus organized the first labo- ratory of primate physiology in the United States.17 In 1931, Fulton discov- ered that a psychologist recently hired by Yale, Carlyle Jacobsen, was performing behavioral analyses of frontal lobe function, and Fulton "jumped" at the opportunity for collaboration.18 Carlyle Jacobsen designed the experiments in which Fulton performed operations on Becky and Lucy. Jacobsen's investigations were the direct cul- mination of a well-planned program of research that explored the problem of functional localization in the mammalian brain, a line of inquiry that grew out of his work as a graduate student in psychology under Karl Lashley. In Jacobsen's opinion, methodological flaws had tainted earlier investigations. For example, he characterized the body of research instigated by Leonardo Bianchi as haphazard and subjective, for it relied upon such intangible crite- ria as the investigator's impressions of the animals' "sense of shame." Others, such as S. I. Franz, he felt, had pointed the way to a truer, more objective analysis by constructing "problem boxes" that tested the learning skills of cats and monkeys before and after removal of selected brain tissue. 15 John Fulton, The Physiology of the Nervous System (London: Oxford University Press, 1938); Hebbel Hoff, "John Fulton's contribution to neurophysiology,"/ Hist. Med., 1962, 17 : 16-37, p. 36; Paul Buey, "The Journal of Neurosurgery, its origin and development,"/ Neurosurg., 1964, 27(7, pt. 2): 1-12; and Walker, "Fulton, John Farquhar," p. 208. Upon his retirement in 1950 as a physiologist, Fulton was able to point to an extraor- dinary record of accomplishment: his laboratory group had produced more than 1,000 articles and books and filled more than 25 chairs in medical schools. 16 Judith Swazey, Reflexes and Motor Integration: Sherrington's Concept of Integrative Action (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1969). 17 Walker, "Fulton, John Farquhar," p. 207. Sherrington wrote in The Integrative Action of the Nervous System (London: Constable, 1906) that die new research methods of promise were "those of Franz, Thorn- dike, Yerkes; for instance, the influence of experimental lesions of the cortex on skilled actions recently and individually, i.e., experimentally acquired," and that "by combining methods of comparative psychology (e.g., the labyrinth test) with the methods of experimental physiology, investigation may be expected ere long to furnish new data of importance toward the knowledge of movement as an outcome of die working of the brain"; quoted in John Fulton, Functional Localization in the Frontal Lobes and Cerebellum (Oxford: Claren- don Press, 1949), p. xiii. 18 John Fulton, "The Physiological Basis of the Operation of Frontal Lobotomy" (Typescript of a lecture to the House Officers Association, Boston City Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 14 January 1947), p. 2.</page><page sequence="7">Fulton and Psychosurgery 7 Here, too, work was confused: poor surgical technique had resulted in lesions of uncertain extent and location.19 Yale's unique combination of resources enabled Jacobsen to overcome these limitations. Supervised by Robert Yerkes, director of the Laboratory of Comparative Psychobiology, Jacobsen developed problem boxes of greater sophistication. At the same time, he had full use of the resources of Fulton's Laboratory of Primate Physiology, which provided a range of experimental subjects beyond rats and lower mammals. There he also obtained invalu- able assistance from Fulton's neurosurgical and neurophysiological exper- tise.20 Jacobsen soon produced a series of landmark papers that delineated subtle differences in intellectual and motor performances, functions related to specific cerebral areas across several primate forms. The most significant results came from his "delayed response test." In this test a monkey watched as the experimenter placed bait under one of two cups. An opaque screen was then lowered, blocking the animal's view; after a variable interval, the screen was raised, allowing the subject to choose a cup. Unlike the situation in earlier problem boxes, animals had to solve such experimental challenges by relying upon short-term memory rather than upon immediate sensory cues alone. When portions of their frontal lobes were removed, animals failed the new test even with delays of only a few seconds; yet the removal of analogous amounts of tissue in other areas of the brain produced no such effect. Jacobsen had established, in defensibly quantifiable and objective terms, that neuroanatomically precise removals of frontal lobe tissue would indeed result in the loss of a specific faculty. He concluded from his elegant series of experiments that the frontal lobes, though not the fabled "organ of intelligence," provided an ability to integrate the experience of the recent past into current actions.21 Although Jacobsen's primary goal was the mapping of particular intel- lectual functions to discrete cortical sites, on occasion he paid attention to the changes in the animals' emotional behavior following the brain opera- 19 Carlyle Jacobsen, "Recent experiments on the function of the frontal lobes," Psychol. Bull., 1928, 25: 1-11, p. 6; idem, "A study of cerebral function in learning: the frontal lobes,"/ Comp. Neurol., 1931, 52. 271-340; and idem, "Studies of cerebral function in primates," Comparative Psychology Monographs, 1936, 13, no. 63: 1-65, p. 7. 20 For example, Fulton pioneered the use of surgical anesthesia in primates and insisted upon utilizing the finest available operating equipment. Such attention allowed precise neurosurgery; also, chimpanzees were too expensive to waste. 21 Jacobsen's theoretical position was a compromise between two warring schools of thought According to one view, termed "mass action" by its developer, Karl Lashley, intelligence was a function of the central nervous system as an integrated whole. Loss of intellectual function was correlated to the amount of brain tissue destroyed, not the location of the tissue. Followers of S. I. Franz held the opposing view, that intelli- gence was localized in specific regions of the brain. Jacobsen's work prior to his arrival at Yale suggested that intelligence depended upon "equilibrated action" of the entire nervous system. However, Jacobsen shifted position as his experimental animals rose on the phylogenetic tree. His final conclusion was that although specific areas of the cortex do have discrete functions, the amount of function lost was in direct proportion to the quantity of brain tissue destroyed. In effect, Jacobsen had integrated the approaches of Lashley and Franz. See his "Studies of cerebral function," pp. 52, 55-57; "Functions of frontal association area in primates," Arch. Neurol. Psych., 1935, 33 : 564-66; and Jacobsen, Wolfe, and Jackson, "Experimental analysis of the functions of the frontal association areas," p. 13.</page><page sequence="8">8 JACK D. PRESSMAN tions. He noted, for example, that several post-operative monkeys no longer appeared to "worry" over mistakes and seemed impervious to frustration. Such observations were useful for legitimating the expensive primate research programs: because direct clinical analogies could be drawn between neurological syndromes in man and those in animals, such investi- gations were likely to shed light on future issues of human neurophysiol- ogy. For example, Jacobsen described strong similarities between Becky and Lucy's condition and the syndromes reported in the few well-studied clinical cases of human frontal lobe damage, especially the account by Rich- ard Brickner. Other than forming a few scattered impressions, however, Jacobsen did not explore the matter further. Jacobsen remained leery of scientific investigations into personality or temperament, as such enterprises in his opinion were invariably undermined by their subjective components; Jacobsen clearly stated at the outset of his research that attempts to localize emotional functions must be deferred until a suitably objective criterion could be devised.22 It comes as a surprise, then, to discover that Jacobsen's findings were in fact interpreted as having deep psychiatric significance, and would serve as the neurophysiological rationale for lobotomy. How was it possible that his objective, self-consciously scientific approach to the study of animal behav- ior could refer to mental disorders, the most subjective of phenomena? An illustration of the difficulty involved in this application was Jacobsen's recourse to likening post-operative Becky to a member of a "happiness cult" - an unexpectedly subjective analogy for one so dedicated to assailing the sins of anthropomorphism. A new experimental model then in vogue, known as "experimental neurosis," promised to unite animal psychology and human psychiatry, thus creating an intellectual environment in which Jacobsen's results would indeed be interpreted as having a direct psychiatric relevance. I. P. Pavlov, architect of the behavioral-conditioning experiment, fashioned this concept in the 1920s to account for occasional instances when laboratory animals suffered apparent "nervous breakdowns." Behavioral abnormalities in ani- mals, he discovered, might result from a traumatic natural event such as a flood, or from artificially induced stress such as that resulting from a condi- tioning experiment in which a laboratory subject was forced to make sen- sory discriminations beyond its faculties. In either instance, the model of experimental neurosis brought the study of behavior abnormalities into the 22 Carlyle Jacobsen, "Study erf cerebral function," p. 337; idem, "Studies of cerebral function," pp. 7, 52; John Fulton and Carlyle Jacobsen, "The Functions of the Frontal Lobes: A Comparative Study in Monkeys, Chimpanzees, and Man" (Abstract, Program of the Second International Neurological Congress, 1 August 1935, London), pp. 70- 71 ; Richard Brickner, Intellectual Functions of the Frontal Lobes.

For example, in 1937 the National Research Council's Inter-Divisional Com- mittee on Borderland Problems of the Life Sciences met to ascertain what efforts should be made to advance "the scientific study of behavior prob- lems." Psychiatry's dependency on mere clinical investigation, committee members agreed, had placed limits on its scientific productivity. A special committee was created - the Committee on Problems of Neurotic Behavior - to sound out the feasibility of attacking behavior disorders through a coordinated program of multi-disciplinary experiments. Experimental neu- rosis provided the committee with a unifying theme, and a Conference on Experimental Neuroses and Allied Problems was organized. A far-reaching intellectual synthesis, the model provoked much intellectual excitement as a new foundation for studying human behavior. Experimental neurosis, defined by the conference participants not as a disease entity but as a method of producing pathological mental states, was held to encompass the entire psychiatric domain, psychoses included. The model also symbolized a particular vision of the relations between laboratory science and clinical medicine, in which psychiatry would become objective not by bringing the experimenters into the world of the asylums but by redefining the labo- ratory as an environment in which psychiatric problems would become visible.24 Experimental neurosis was analyzed in the rat, cat, dog, goat, and sheep; Jacobsen's observations on primates extended this growing literature sev- eral steps closer to man. At first glance, his colorful remarks about Becky's behavior simply painted a vivid picture of the animal's unexpected behav- ioral transformations. But placed within the framework of the Pavlovian model, such comments gained a deeper significance. Jacobsen reported that Becky's violent preoperative behavior, when elicited by the delayed reac- tion test, was "as complete an experimental' neurosis as those obtained by 23 1. P.

Excision of Becky's frontal lobes had produced a startling effect: even though Becky now made far more mistakes, extensive testing with difficult problems did not evoke even a hint of experimental neurosis.25 Within this intellectual context, Jacobsen's experimental findings inadvertently joined neurosurgery, neurophysiology, physiological psychology, and psychiatry - a combination that would create a compelling scientific justification for lobotomy in the first few years after its introduction. It is no coincidence that Jacobsen's investigations developed at Yale. When Jacobsen arrived in New Haven he entered the newly completed Ster- ling Extension, which was fitted out with elaborate primate facilities as well as with the finest neurosurgical and physiological equipment. Yale's unique primate research program resulted from the combined interests of Robert Yerkes, who had been responsible for the presence of temporary animal quarters at Yale since 1925 and was devoted to establishing a vigorous pro- gram of primate psychobiology; Fulton, whose desire to study the evolution of cortical dominance in the higher primates led him to designate such facilities as a non-negotiable item in his contract; and Dean Milton Winter- nitz, who was eager to prod the Yale Medical School into intensive research efforts on the central nervous system and its relation to human behavior. By 1935 Fulton was able to boast that more papers on primate brain function had been produced by the Yale laboratory than by any other medical school.26 In 1931, Yerkes and Fulton exchanged memos concerning Jacob- sen's studies: psychological equipment would be obtained from Yerkes' lab- oratory and surgical facilities would be provided by Fulton. Both Yerkes and Fulton viewed these experiments as a concrete symbol of the intimate con- nection between their two laboratories and of the interrelation of their fields.27 Jacobsen's research was, in fact, an ideal fulfillment of the Yale Medical School's special mission as an interdisciplinary research center, a goal forged in the 1920s and the 1930s. In the view of Dean Winternitz, there was a need in medicine to integrate physical, psychical, and social factors into medical education and patient care. Winternitz's ultimate goal was to dis- cover means of adjusting individuals to their occupations and environments; 25 Jacobsen, Wolfe, and Jackson, "Experimental analysis of the functions of the frontal association areas," pp. 9-10. Fulton believed that Moniz learned from Fulton's 1935 presentation to the Second Neurological Congress that surgical intervention had rendered the animals "immune to experimental neurosis"; see Fulton, "Physiological Basis of the Operation of Frontal Lobotomy" (1940), pp. 1-2. 26 Milton Winternitz, 'Yale University School of Medicine," Methods and Problems of Medical Education, 1932, 20: 1-4; and John Fulton, 'Yale University School of Medicine Department of Physiology," Methods and Problems of Medical Education, 1932, 20: 17-26.

The new build- ing was placed next to the Sterling Hall of Medicine, which itself was undergoing reorganization with a new emphasis on neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, and neuropathology. In Sterling Hall and the Institute, the goal of researchers was the study and modification of human behavior; the method was research and the training of new investigators; and the watch- word was cooperation among disciplines. Fulton credited the existence of his own interdisciplinary research program to Yale's "peculiar combination of facilities and interests."29 The distinct institutional mission that made possible Jacobsen's studies also created an environment in which the potential psychiatric implications of his work would receive maximum consideration.30 In addition to Winter- nitz's personal emphasis on the study of human behavior, the calculated patronage of the Rockefeller Foundation in this era had a strong impact on the attention of medical researchers to psychiatric issues. In particular, the primary agenda of the Foundation's medical funding in the 1930s was the transformation of American psychiatry through grants in basic neurological sciences and through training those who might constitute the next genera- tion of psychiatric leaders. The Foundation's agenda was especially apparent at Yale; in addition to the conspicuous Institute of Human Relations, the Foundation had endowed the Yale Medical School's Fluid Research Fund, from whose account Fulton supported the expense of maintaining primate facilities. Indeed, when Fulton's laboratory faced grave financial difficulties because of growing requests for research fellowships, Fulton approached Alan Gregg, director of the Rockefeller Foundation's Division of Medical Sciences, for supplemental aid. Between January 1934 and June 1938, the Foundation allocated approximately $25,000 to Fulton, which amounted to more than half of his total budget for acquisition and care of primates. Fulton's laboratory was viewed by the Foundation as a training center for young researchers who some day might revolutionize psychiatry and clini- 28 J. G.

Fulton's program fitted well with the Rockefeller Founda- tion's overall strategy of rebuilding American psychiatry; Jacobsen's research was a natural extension of Fulton's program.31 Fulton and his laboratory at Yale had other important direct ties to the origins of psychosurgery in America. In a letter to Gregg, Fulton remarked on an expectation that his most lasting contribution to science and medicine would stem from his role as a teacher. Emulating the great physiologists Carl Ludwig and Sir Michael Foster, Fulton sought to "pick the right men," those who "through force of character and originality [would] make their mark and come ultimately to occupy influential positions in the field."32 Fulton nurtured with special care the career of James Watts, a young neuro- surgeon who spent 1932-33 as an Honorary Research Fellow in Fulton's laboratory. Watts brought to Yale an impressive list of credentials, having trained under Percival Bailey at the University of Chicago, William J. Mixter and Henry R Viets at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and Otto Foer- ster in Breslau, all the while publishing a substantial number of research articles.33 Although Watts's southern drawl, lethargic manner, and serious- ness at first delayed his acceptance into the Fulton team, his neurosurgical skill and scientific style eventually won him general admiration. The young surgeon's talents especially impressed Fulton, who, when Watts's fellowship ended, enthusiastically supported Watts's application for an important neu- rosurgical post at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine under Francis Grant and Charles Frazier. Fulton wrote to Grant: I have watched him closely this year and I have come to the conclusion that he has one of the most beautiful pairs of hands that I have ever seen work at an operating table. It is really quite extraordinary. He goes slowly, handles tissue with a Halstedian touch Scientifically he is independent, careful, slow to reach conclusions, and I think in consequence that he would never go half- cocked in any form of work.34 After Watts left for Philadelphia, Fulton closely monitored his career. For example, he orchestrated Watts's appearance before leading scientific societies, such as the 1934 meetings of the American Medical Association in 31 The Rockefeller Foundation (in conjunction with the resources of the General Education Board and the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial) underwrote the reconstruction of the Yale Medical School; the Founda- tion spent a total of $14 million between 1923 and 1939 on this program, which included the Institute of Human Relations and the founding of the Department of Psychiatry.

Watts made good use of Fulton's aid; at the Cleveland meeting, he buttonholed the neurologist Walter Freeman about the climate for a neurosurgical career in Washington, D.C. This query soon led to Watts's directing his own neurosurgical service at the George Washington Univer- sity Medical School in conjunction with Freeman's Department of Neurol- ogy. Watts wrote gratefully to Fulton that although the starting salary was low, and it would take several years to build up a profitable practice, "I know one thing, I am going to have the finest service in the country some- where sometime."35 Fulton felt personal as well as professional pride in Watts's continuing success. Watts's career was but one example of how Fulton, by launching young investigators on fruitful research projects and then using his professional standing to advance their careers, was extending his influence through a new generation of rising neurosurgeons, neurophysiologists, and neurolo- gists. Freeman saw in Watts's appointment the growing significance of Ful- ton's role. "One might speak of a rather large grain of radioactivity," he wrote to Fulton, "centering in yourself in New Haven with secondary radia- tions emanating from those whom you have activated."36 Only a short time later Freeman would be drawn into discussions with Fulton when contem- plating the trial of a new therapy. In August of 1936, Freeman sent to Fulton his laudatory review of Moniz's initial publication on the use of surgical methods to alleviate mental illness. Freeman and Fulton frequently corresponded on neurophysiologi- cal issues and, in the previous year or so, Freeman had been particularly inquisitive about the behaviors of Fulton's lobectomized chimpanzees. Upon his return from Europe in mid-September, Fulton replied to Freeman that he had acquired a reprint of Moniz's article in July and that he quite agreed that Moniz had taken an important step in the treatment of mental disease. The deciding factor for Fulton was Jacobsen's observations that bilateral removal of the frontal association areas in chimpanzees perma- nently eliminated experimental neuroses and agitated behavior. He assured Freeman that Moniz had undoubtedly produced an analogous effect with his surgery on human beings. Freeman, in his later recollections of the factors that precipitated his decision to pursue leukotomy, carefully noted Fulton's assurances; it was "fortunate," he also recalled, that Watts had spent a year in Fulton's laboratory.37 Unknown to Fulton, Watts had been persuaded by the time of Free- 35 James Watts to Fulton, 11 March 1935; and 14 June 1934 entry, "Diary of John Farquhar Fulton" (here- after "Diary"), Medical Historical Ubrary, Sterling Hall of Medicine, Yale University Medical School, New Haven, Connecticut Ajames Watts to Fulton, 26 February 1935; Walter Freeman to Fulton, 23 February 1935. 37 Walter Freeman to Fulton, 8 June 1936; Carlyle Jacobsen to Walter Freeman, 26 September 1934; and Fulton to Walter Freeman, 12 September 1936.

PRESSMAN man's letter to make preparations for the first psychosurgery operation in the United States, and the two Washington physicians already had a surgical prospect. Two days after Fulton replied to Freeman's letter, the procedure was performed on an agitated woman facing institutionalization.38 Three weeks later, Henry Viets passed through Washington and on a chance visit to his former student was surprised to discover that Watts had taken up the Moniz procedure. Viets forwarded to Fulton a diary entry of his trip, in which he had written that much to Watts's joy the patient immediately became quiet and "normal" following the operation. And although only a short time had elapsed, the patient's family was already delighted with the improvement. Viets noted that at first sight the operation did seem radical and foolish, but its remarkable results indicated good potential. He believed "Jim" to be a cautious surgeon who was well aware that vehement opposi- tion lay ahead.39 Fulton replied that he already knew about Moniz's opera- tion and that he was strongly in favor of the procedure. Once again, Fulton turned to his experience with the lobectomized chimpanzees: "As you probably know, not one of our chimpanzees or monkeys with frontal asso- ciation areas out has ever had an experimental neurosis."40 Writing to Watts the same day, Fulton repeated this point and concluded that Moniz's proce- dure appeared to be a well-conceived physiological operation. He hoped that Watts would persevere and give it a fair clinical trial. Watts replied, "I cannot tell you how much encouragement [your letter] gave me."41 A weekly exchange of letters thus began between Fulton and his former associate, in which Fulton offered greatly appreciated advice, reassurance, and professional support. At one point Watts noted that initially he had been reluctant to risk such a procedure, as he had a reputation for being a con- servative neurosurgeon. But a review of the experimental and clinical litera- ture had convinced him of the merits of Moniz's operation. Watts wrote that his final decision to try the procedure was heavily influenced by Fulton and Jacobsen's chimpanzee operations. By the time of this reply, Watts and Free- man had operated on three patients; two of them, Watts reported, were kept out of institutions as a direct result.42 An additional case prompted Watts to inform Fulton that the procedure's results had exceeded his and Freeman's grandest expectations. Fulton congratulated Watts for his pioneering role, and hoped these experiences would embolden Watts to carry on, as he expected that in a year or so the procedure would constitute one of the "major phases" of neurosurgery.43 In early November, Fulton traveled to Washington, D.C., for a personal 38 The initial report on this patient was published by Walter Freeman and James W.

Fulton's diary entry captured the enthusiasm he felt after an examination of one of Watts 's first patients. In Fulton's account, the woman had been for two years an "impossible" schizophrenic, requiring two nurses in daily attendance; after the operation, she was perfectly calm, rational, and entirely conscious of the beneficial change that the procedure had wrought in her psyche. "I felt somehow," he wrote, "that we were in the presence of one of the milestones of modern medicine." He continued, "I have seldom been more stirred and Henry Viets who came with me felt exactly as I had."44 Fulton returned to New Haven sufficiently confident about the new operation to mention to Watts the possibility of referring a young schizoid man from Minnesota who was the son of a family friend. Watts was thrilled by this compliment, all "puffed up" at the possibility of a patient traveling the long distance from Minnesota. Fulton then wrote to the mother of the patient to explain the new opera- tion, once again alluding to the prevention of experimental neuroses in chimpanzees.45 In July 1937, Watts and Freeman contemplated an improvement upon Moniz's method. The surgical corer, whose use had the disadvantage of leaving epileptogenic scar tissue, was to be replaced by a simple blunt scal- pel. They termed this modification lobotomy, an innovation that later became established as the "standard" psychosurgical operation. Once again, Watts duly consulted Fulton for advice. Fulton approved of the new proce- dure and "stood ready to help at any time."46 Direct professional aid had already been rendered by Fulton, who had revised the drafts of Watts's early lobotomy papers before both their delivery and their publication.47 Fulton's vigorous support for the procedure went beyond the encour- agement offered to his former pupil and extended into the medical commu- nity at large, thus paving the way for the treatment's general acceptance. Beginning in November 1936, Fulton awakened his extensive family of cor- respondents - with whom over the preceding few years he had discussed problems of neurophysiology, neurosurgery, clinical neurology, and psychi- atry - to the potential of the brain operations.48 In particular, Fulton had served as a private clearinghouse for discussions concerning frontal lobe function. Convinced now that lobotomy had a definite future, Fulton urged this network of correspondents to consider the new procedure. This group included Henry Viets, Carlyle Jacobsen, Percival Bailey, Paul Buey, Richard 44 "Diary," 16 November 1936. 45 Fulton to James Watts, 20 November 1936; James Watts to Fulton, 23 November 1936; and Fulton to [I have omitted the name to preserve confidentiality], 25 November 1936.

PRESSMAN Brickner, R Glen Spurling, Harry Solomon, Kenneth McKenzie, Spafford Ackerly, and John Lyerly. For example, Fulton asked Brickner whether he had been aware of Moniz's "impressive" new operation. "On the grounds of your observations and ours in chimps," he wrote, "it seems to me that the procedure is warranted and I hope we can stir up a few more courageous neurosurgeons to try it."49 In addition to broadening the operation's sup- port, Fulton hoped to convince his favored investigators to seize a golden opportunity to "get in on the ground floor."50 Other prominent physicians, such as Harvard psychiatrist Harry Solo- mon, were intrigued by the new procedure but hesitated until researchers of Fulton's stature would provide a critical judgment "from the physiologi- cal standpoint."51 Fulton's correspondence with R Glen Spurling illustrates how the Yale physiologist legitimated the new treatment. Interested in per- forming lobotomies himself, Spurling had contacted Freeman and Watts for surgical details but remained unconvinced that a neurophysiological ra- tionale existed. Cognizant of Fulton's expertise on the subject and that Ful- ton had personally inspected the early cases, Spurling solicited Fulton's opinion.52 Fulton replied in full and forwarded a copy of Moniz's mono- graph. Fulton admitted his own deep interest in the operation and then described the significance of Jacobsen's studies. Before the operation, he wrote, the animals' behavior disturbances had been "very real." For exam- ple, Jacobsen was forced to suspend experimentation for three to four months when an animal developed an experimental neurosis. But, Fulton emphasized, "no animal with frontal association areas out develops an experimental neurosis ." Fulton admitted that it was a long jump between the case reports of experimental neuroses in cats and dogs to disturbances in man, but the gap had been narrowed by the chimpanzee investigations. And, Fulton informed Spurling, given the additional basis of Freeman and Watts's findings, test trials were indeed indicated 53 Fulton's letter was strong enough to sway Spurling, who wrote back that without it he would not have had the courage to attempt the operation. Spurling was not the only physician so persuaded.54 Fulton remarked half- jokingly to Spurling that, as everyone was proceeding forward on the basis of his opinion, if the operation eventually did not gain general acceptance, "I am afraid I shall have a good deal to answer for to St. Peter."55 This said, Fulton was willing to stand behind his exhortations.

For example, Fulton conveyed information on the new operation through a medical poster exhibit on frontal lobe function, a display that won a medal at the 1939 American Medical Association meeting in St Louis. One section of the exhibit was dedicated to Moniz's operation, reporting that more than two hundred operations had been done in Wash- ington, Jacksonville, and Boston with striking improvement in many institu- tionalized patients - some of whom were able to return to work.58 In addition, in 1940 Fulton incorporated the subject of lobotomy into his well- publicized Sigma Xi Lecture Series, which covered sixteen cities in three weeks. Science Service , for example, distributed a press release on his lec- ture to the Mayo Clinic titled "Brain Operations, Removing Parts of Frontal Lobes, Found to Aid Some Types of Hopeless Mental Patients."59 Fulton played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in helping to insure that the subject of psychosurgery would gain a fair hearing and survive its con- troversial first few years. Indeed, Freeman and Watts met with considerable professional opposition at several medical societies when reporting on their first operations.60 In 1940, the science journalist Waldemar Kaempffert observed a lobotomy operation performed by Freeman and Watts. Greatly impressed, he considered writing a feature article on psychosurgery, the first to appear in a national publication. When he queried the New York Academy of Medicine on the topic, he was surprised to discover bitter opposition - labels such as "crime" and "criminals" were mentioned. For advice, Kaempffert turned to Fulton, who responded by describing the acad- emy's opinion on the operation as "all wet." This proved sufficient for Kaempffert, who obtained from Fulton appropriate background references on the subject as well as some editorial assistance.61 56 Ibid. ^Fulton to James Watts, 20 January 1936(7]; and James Watts to Fulton, 2 November 1936, 21 January 1937. 58 Folder on the Sl Louis meeting of the American Medical Association, 15-19 May 1939. 59 His talks were tided "The Functions of the Frontal Lobes; an Experimental Analysis in Monkeys, Chim- panzees, and Man."

PRESSMAN The article was published in the Saturday Evening Post in May 1941, touching off a scandal that prompted more than one medical society to seek the censure of both Freeman and Watts; unknown to Fulton beforehand, the printed version of the article contained several photographs in which Free- man and Watts were identified by name. At the time, this was regarded as a form of medical advertisement - a serious breach of medical ethics. Once again, Fulton rose to the occasion. He declared to those proposing censure that, if necessary, he would stand behind Freeman and Watts "to the last ditch"; at the American Neurological Association he quashed the censure motion in executive session.62 In 1941 the medical publisher Charles C Thomas wavered over a deci- sion to publish a work as controversial as Freeman and Watts's monograph. He consulted Fulton, who for many years had been a valued source of confidential editorial opinion to and an important author for Thomas's firm. Fulton lobbied hard on behalf of Freeman and Watts. In response, Thomas wrote that he had received many letters "blasting Freeman and Watts all over the lot," but as Fulton's opinion was always the best bet he would accept the manuscript. Watts thanked Fulton for this support, convinced that without it Thomas would never have signed a contract. It had become com- mon knowledge that Freeman and Watts had obtained the backing of Ful- ton's "powerful influence."63 Several rationales can account for Fulton's close involvement in the ini- tial development of psychosurgery. As scientific justification for the proce- dure appeared to rest upon experimental findings that originated in his own laboratory, Fulton naturally maintained a proprietary interest. Fulton was also thrilled that the procedure had been introduced into America by a favored alumnus of his laboratory. Furthermore, Fulton shared the excite- ment generated by a treatment that seemed to offer hope in a realm where "despondency reigns."64 Fulton's enthusiasm, however, extended beyond such considerations; we must appreciate what lobotomy as a research enterprise symbolized to him as well as to the group of neurologically ori- ented scientists and physicians whom he guided. During his first decade as chairman of Yale's Department of Physiology, Fulton combatted what he termed "static dead-house" neurology, a doctrine that in his opinion had pervaded American medical education and practice. He believed that classical or anatomical neurology had been at first mod- esdy successful in treating "syndromes" but more recently had both "bred contempt" for active therapy and perpetuated ignorance of physiological 62 Waldemar Kaempffert to Fulton, 31 May 1941; Fulton to Waldemar Kaempffert, 12 June 1941; Fulton to Charles Thomas, 27 May 1941; and Fulton to Henry Viets, 25 June 1941. 63 Charles Thomas to Fulton, 26 May 1941; Fulton to Charles Thomas, 27 May 1941; Charles Thomas to Fulton, 4 June 1941; James Watts to Fulton, 7 September 1941; and R G.

In 1933, Fulton outlined to Alan Gregg of the Rockefeller Foun- dation his blueprint for reforming neurology. Of utmost urgency, in Ful- ton's view, was the infusion of a dynamic neurology in American medical education. By dynamic he meant "the analysis of neurological disturbances in terms of the brain reflex mechanisms responsible for the observed mani- festations" - for him, the only basis for sound diagnosis and therapy.65 In substance, this involved neurology's incorporation of the physiological prin- ciples of Hughlings Jackson and Charles Sherrington, and of the clinical teachings of Otto Foerster. The ultimate goal of Fulton's program was to widen the scientific basis for future clinical advancements. Because the results of such work would have direct medical relevance to man, Fulton insisted on working with primates at a time when few went to the trouble.66 Fulton looked to a young group of research-oriented neurological sur- geons to bring about neurology's transformation. Such a crew Fulton found in the Harvey Cushing Society, an informal society of young Turks named after Fulton's mentor. The association consisted primarily of neurosurgeons such as Paul Buey and James Watts who espoused Fulton's "dynamic atti- tude."67 The Harvey Cushing Society's potential as a source of professional reform greatly excited Fulton, who looked upon the members as a "vigourous, alert group identified with the new order of things" through whom "the importance of dynamic neurology could be taught to the com- ing generation of neurosurgeons."68 Elected as the Society's second presi- dent, Fulton used the opportunity of his 1934 presidential address to sound the clarion call: I have the conviction that the future of neurology in this country lies very largely in your hands. We have it within our power to make a great contribution during the next generation, a contribution that will far transcend that which has come from mere perfection of neurosurgical technique. In the privacy of a family gathering such as this, one can speak freely and personally. ... I am devoting myself to the study of the nervous system because I confidently believe that within the next few years more light will be shed upon fundamental problems of clinical medicine from study of nervous function than from study of other systems of the body. 65 Fulton to Alan Gregg, 25 February 1933. 66 The dedication in Fulton's Physiology of the Nervous System reads: "To students of medicine who must bridge the gap between the concepts of neurophysiology and the problems of clinical neurology." In Bucy's opinion, "Fulton's entire professional career was devoted to neurophysiology and its relation to neurosurgery. No man has ever done so much to bridge the gap between a clinical specialty and its basic scientific counter- part as has John Fulton. He made all neurosurgeons conscious of neurophysiology" (Paul Buey, "Journal of Neurosurgery p. 1). 67 Fulton to Alan Gregg, 25 February 1933. 68 Fulton to Alan Gregg, 27 February 1933. Howard A.

PRESSMAN "This," Fulton concluded, "is a simple confession of faith."69 In particular, Fulton predicted gains in psychiatry, because "a few psy- chiatrists are now willing to allow that the psychoses may have something to do with the brain, rather than entirely with the heart as Aristotle thought."70 This reflected Fulton's long-held "earthy" attitude , toward psychiatry; in 1932, for example, he wrote to one member that his inclination was to look upon every case of mental derangement as having an anatomical basis unless there was objective evidence to the contrary. The occasion for the letter was the colleague's statement that Fulton's own research promised to bring psychiatry within the domain of scientific medicine. Indeed, in Ful- ton's pantheon, Pavlov was a far greater scientist than Freud.71 Only a few years later, James Watts - encouraged by Fulton - pre- sented before the Cushing Society his first paper on psychosurgery addressed to his neurosurgical peers. A consensus was reached that in the team of Watts and Freeman the procedure's evaluation was in excellent hands; the "explorers" were congratulated.72 In the potential of the new brain operations, Fulton saw the fulfillment of his "confession of faith." As early as October 1936, Fulton envisioned that psychosurgery programs would be incorporated into state mental hospitals, leading to significant reductions in overcrowding as well as social costs.73 That a practice as questionable as psychosurgery would attain clinical trials is less problematic than one might suppose, especially if one forgoes the usual assumption that its advocates must have been of marginal stature, callous physicians willing to disregard the standards of good medicine. It is true that when the first psychosurgical cases were presented before promi- nent American medical societies considerable opposition arose. Neverthe- less, psychosurgery's initial development followed a pattern typical of that of other successful medical innovations: its supporters included leading fig- ures within the medical-scientific community, and a consensus had in fact emerged that a scientific basis existed for the treatment. In particular, it was largely through the efforts of the Yale physiologist John Fulton that psychosurgery came to be regarded as of "sufficient prom- ise," a therapeutic innovation worth pursuing in spite of its medical risks and its uncertain future. First, Fulton made full use of his considerable influ- ence on behalf of the treatment's American pioneers, Freeman and Watts, by vigorously promoting their work to various medical and lay audiences and trenchantly defending them against serious professional attacks. Due to Ful- ton's labors, the cause of psychosurgery gained both early recognition and a 69 Fulton, "Abstract of Presidential Address" (Typescript of address delivered to the Harvey Cushing Soci- ety, St. Louis, 5 April 1934), p. 1; Fulton to Alan Gregg, 27 February 1933; Fulton to W.

Second, in linking Moniz 's initial lobotomy attempts to ideas implicit within the chimpanzee experiments conducted at Yale, Fulton drew attention to - if he did not outright create - a putative scientific justification for lobotomy. Such a reappraisal of the support given to psychosurgery helps to dispel the mystery of its professional success. The overall story appears no less tragic in light of this reappraisal, however, as we learn of a medical commu- nity proceeding on the basis of a neurophysiological theory that later would be severely discredited. Worse yet, it is arguable that the scientific justifica- tion proffered by psychosurgery's proponents would not have held up to close scrutiny even at that time. In Valenstein's characterization, here was an extreme example of "uncritical enthusiasm running rampant"; he singles out John Fulton as especially culpable.74 To dwell on the manifold reasons the participants in the drama of psy- chosurgery should have acted differently leads us, however, to pass over the historical questions concerning why they acted as they did. Ascertaining pre- cisely why physicians of the day were so ready to believe that brain opera- tions could be effective in the treatment of mental illness is of greater historical consequence than pinpointing where such an invalid belief origi- nated. Psychosurgery did not occur within a historical vacuum. Rather, both Fulton and the larger medical community that he guided were influenced in their evaluation of the new treatment by a common set of professional con- cerns and intellectual outlooks, factors that in turn were contingent upon larger historical situations and currents. First, the chimpanzee experiments that were later used to justify the operation emerged within a specific institutional context. There existed only one primate laboratory in this country where such research was possible; there were historical reasons why such unusual facilities were located at Yale. The Yale Medical School, transformed by the Rockefeller Foundation in this period, exhibited a commitment to interdisciplinary research that was to provide an objective basis for the analysis and modification of human behavior. As an outgrowth of the research conducted at the Yale program of primate physiology, psychosurgery was an unintended consequence, but it was by no means an undesired one. Second, a popular Pavlovian model known as "experimental neurosis" provided a compelling intellectual context that united the disciplines of physiological psychology, psychiatry, and neurophysiology. The findings of Fulton and Jacobsen's chimpanzee experiments, when placed within this framework, were interpreted as having a direct bearing on psychiatric prob- lems. Grounded on this physiological model, and appearing at a moment when scientific approaches to the problem of mental illness were at a pre- mium, psychosurgery thus came to represent the new optimism about what 74 Valenstein, Great and Desperate Cures, pp. xi, 112, 147-48, and 266.</page><page sequence="22">22 JACK D. PRESSMAN an experimentally based psychiatry might yield. "Whatever the value of psy- chosurgery will be," wrote one prominent psychiatrist, "its advent will . . . be hailed as a boldly conceived attack upon the problems of psychiatry."75 Finally, Fulton was personally motivated to embrace the development of psychosurgery: to him the treatment represented exactly the sort of prac- tical advance that he hoped might result from research conducted in his laboratory, and the immensity of the clinical problem it addressed gready heightened his - and others' - enthusiasm. Moreover, the innovation was pioneered by some of the country's top neurosurgeons who shared Fulton's vision of interjecting a new, dynamic, and experimentally based neurology into American medical research and education. In sum, a full understanding of psychosurgery's transition from an untested conjecture to a treatment demanding serious clinical evaluation must be based on consideration of a blend of institutional goals, conceptual orientations, personal influence, and disciplinary interests. In light of this reassessment, what is our judgment of Fulton and his contemporaries who were convinced that the procedure was worth a trial? What is the lesson of psychosurgery? The answers are not easily arrived at, as the process by which we parcel out praise and blame to medical investi- gators is self-contradictory: we expect them to possess a blend of courage and audacity tempered, paradoxically, by caution and probity. When useful discoveries are chanced upon, we laud the investigators' intuitive fore- sight and intellectual prowess; should scientific fashions change or the researchers stumble badly, we condemn their hubris in even having tried. There is no clear moral here, other than to abandon the usual habits by which we judge these actors. In the example before us, that the original rationale for psychosurgery seems so opaque to us today is less an indica- tion that its formulators acted outside the path of normal science than it is a measure of how much the contexts in which they acted have since changed. T. H. Huxley wrote that today's heresy is tomorrow's orthodoxy; at times, the reverse holds true. Histories of therapies that have "failed" after a period of wide accept- ance present a somewhat unsettling picture of medical progress, in that they underscore the often temporal nature of clinical evaluation. As case studies such difficult topics are useful to medical historians not because they are inherently idiosyncratic, but because they occasion a re-examination of the factors that influence the appraisal of all medical innovations, successful as well as unsuccessful. We must look to the specific features of the contexts in which physicians selea one line of medical investigation from its alterna- tives. Studies of "failed" technologies such as psychosurgery reveal that what constitutes standard medical praaice and belief does not stay fixed, but evolves. The challenge, then, is to explain the faaors guiding that evolution. ^Abraham Myerson, "Some trends of psychiatry," Amer. J. Psychiat., 1944, 100 : 170.</page></plain_text>
