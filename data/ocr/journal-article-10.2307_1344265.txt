<plain_text><page sequence="1">Romanticism and the Life of Things: Fossils, Totems, and Images W. J. T. Mitchell The following essay was written as the keynote address to the annual meeting of the North American Society for the Study of Romanticism in September 2000. The topic for that year was Romanticism and the Physical, a signal that the current interest in questions of material culture, objecthood, and thingness were (as always) percolating down through the canonical periods of literary and cultural history. Romanticism, however, has been a period under siege in recent reformulations of English literary history. Crowded on the one side by Frank O'Gorman's conceptualization of the "long eighteenth century" and on the other by the Victorian and ever-voracious mod- ernist periods, it has begun to look like an endangered species in the sequence of historical literary specialties, especially as measured by the Modern Language Asso- ciation's annual lists ofjob openings.' This historical squeeze is compounded by the continuing habit among cultural critics and historians to refer unreflectively to tendencies such as emotionalism, sentimentality, and idealism as "merely" roman- tic phenomena that have been superseded by tough-minded modernism or even more wised-up postmodernism. My paper, then, was a double effort to link romanti- cism to the new interest across a number of disciplines in things and to trace the genealogy of that very interest to the historic discovery of some very specific and rather momentous concepts and images of thinghood in the heart of the romantic movement. Special thanks are due to Mark Lussier, the organizer of this event. I want to acknowl- edge also Bill Brown, James Chandler, Arnold Davidson, Marilyn Gaull, and Frangoise Mel- tzer who made numerous excellent suggestions about the issues raised in this paper. 1.

T Mitchell Romanticism and the Life of Things At the same time, this paper was conceived as part of my own ongoing inquiry into the question of the "animated" object/image/thing, especially those forms of ani- mation rooted in desire and longing. The argument may be seen, then, as an attempt to answer the question-what do pictures want?-in a framework that allows for the possibility that "pictures" (representational images and objects in any medium, verbal or visual) have lives of their own and that those lives are founded in want, that is, in desires as both a negative lack and a positive longing for an object.2 1. My Own Country First, I must thank the North American Society for the Study of Ro- manticism for inviting an errant romanticist to come home. Later I will say something about ways in which North America (Canada, especially) might be a home for certain romantic things, but for the moment I only want to say something about myself as a romanticist. Although I began my professional life as a scholar of romantic literature, especially of the work of William Blake, I have been exploring strange seas of thought (iconologies, media studies, art history, visual culture) outside the field of romantic studies for almost twenty years now, with my editorship of Criti- cal Inquiry serving as sea anchor. When people ask me these days what my field is, I generally find myself hard-pressed to give an answer. But one response I find unavoidable is simply to say, "well, I started out as a ro- manticist." Romantic studies, specifically in England, but more broadly in France and Germany, has always seemed to me like a crucial point of origin, even though, like everyone else, I understood that romanticism was a deeply ambiguous and contested concept, one that varies across national borders and literary genres. It was, in fact, the conspicuous mix- tures of genres, media, and styles that most appealed to me about roman- ticism, a sense that its "impurity" as a concept and a historical formation stood out in contrast to the rule-governed decorum of classical, especially neoclassical, aesthetic forms. 2.

Terry Smith (Sydney, 1997), pp. 215-32, and a slightly differ- ent version, "What Do Pictures Really Want?" October, no. 77 (Summer 1996): 71-82. W. J. T.

I will spare you the full recitation of these transforma- tions. Suffice it to say that the last thirty years have witnessed revolutions at every level of human civilization and in every region of the world. Globalization, the emergence of new economies, technologies, and media, of new geopolitical orders and religious revivals have been accompanied by vast cultural transformations that effect everyday life and the profes- sional study of culture in which we participate. When I was in graduate school in the 1960s, deconstruction was a rumor of a possible future; now it is a Republican debating strategy, and it is periodically pronounced dead by those who claim to understand French intellectual culture.3 Fem- inism, African American studies, cultural studies, new historicism, critical theory, semiotics, and so on did not exist (in the American academy in those simpler times, although the social and political forces that would give rise to them were all around us in the sixties). "Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive," Wordsworth's summary of witnessing the French Revo- lution in the early 1790s,4 had a new resonance for the generation of the sixties and launched a sense of the romantic movement as somehow the counterpart to our own time. So I was not alone in straying from the romantic fold after the sixties. The whole theoretical revolution in literary studies, especially in its Marx- ist, poststructuralist, and feminist forms, seemed (as Orrin Wang and others have showed in their "genealogical" studies of romanticism, mod- ernity, and postmodernity) to make romanticism the crucial precursor to dominant structures of feeling in the sixties and after.5 The romantic pe- riod began to feel like the origin of everything interesting in our time. But this meant that to be a romanticist meant being many other things as well-a student of modernism, of postmodernism, of theories of culture and history. How could one understand the thought of Marx or Freud or Darwin, for instance, without reading Hegel or Blake or Cuvier? How could one grasp the intricacies of textual interpretation in general with- out grappling with Coleridge and German romantic hermeneutics? The Yale school dominated literary theory for a decade, yet it was itself domi- nated by the romantic literary canon. How could one write a history of 3.

T Mitchell Romanticism and the Life of Things literature or culture or politics at all without wrestling with the emer- gence of the very idea of history in the romantic period?6 And how could one address the concept of the postmodern, seen as a dialectical over- turning of the modern, without noticing the parallel with the romantic movement's overturning of the Enlightenment? In the sixties, as in the romantic period, the grand modernizing narratives of endless progress through technical rationality seemed to collide visibly with the resurgence of the primitive, the irrational, and the archaic. Utopian revolutionary hopes wove themselves through the fabric of disillusionment and times of slackening. In short, if all roads seemed to lead us back to the romantic period and that indefinable cultural formation known as romanticism, all roads seemed to lead from it to our own time as well. I took the road away, and now come back, like the Ancient Mariner, to my own country. 2. Getting Physical with Romanticism The conversation has now turned to Romanticism and the Physical. In the old days, of course, it would have been Romanticism and the Spiri- tual (or the mental, the psychological, the ideal, the immaterial, the meta- physical). We would have been quoting Blake's "Mental Things are alone real"' and Wordsworth's vaporous raptures over the mind and the spirit. But if all roads lead to romanticism, they inevitably bring along with them the baggage of our present concerns-postcoloniality, gender, race, tech- nology, and now the physical. What exactly is the physical? Is it the physical body? Or the physical, material world more generally, the object of the physical sciences? Is it the domain of nature, the nonhuman realm of what Wordsworth called "rocks, and stones, and trees," and all the rest-the earth, the oceans, the atmosphere, the planets, and stars in their courses?8 And what is the rhetorical or theoretical force of invoking the physical as a thematic within romanticism? Is this a signal of a new materialism, another over- turning of Hegel and idealism? Is it a reflex of the fashion for bodily matters in contemporary criticism and, if so, is this a natural body or a cultural body? A virtual techno-body, a gendered, racialized, erotic body, or a body without organs? Where does the invocation of the physical lo- cate us in the endless debate of nature and culture, the natural and the human sciences? Is it a replaying of the old romantic division between the physical, understood as the organic, living substance, and the material, understood as the inert, dead, or mechanical? 6.

We are in danger of supposing that somehow the turn to the physical is a tough- minded and realistic gesture, a politically progressive act of getting down to the concrete, hard facts, the obdurate stuff of things in themselves, an escape from old-fashioned romantic idealism. And of course the more closely we look at both romanticism and at the physical world, the more difficult it becomes to sustain any such illusion. The physical is a thor- oughly metaphysical concept. The concrete is (as Hegel points out) the most abstract concept we have; bodies are spiritual entities, constructions of fantasy. Objects only make sense in relation to thinking, speaking sub- jects, and things are evanescent, multistable appearances; and matter, as we have known since the ancient materialists, is a "lyric substance" more akin to comets, meteors, and electrical storms than to some hard, uni- form mass.9 3. The Life of Things Getting physical with romanticism, then, will get us absolutely no- where if we do not get metaphysical at the same time. We can see this most clearly if we look at the status of the physical in our own time. We live at a strange moment in cultural history, when the most extreme forms of material physicality and real violence are exerted by virtual, disembod- ied actors. As Katherine Hayles has demonstrated, there are more things, especially more living things, in heaven and earth today than were ever dreamt of by physico-theology, natural philosophy, or romantic idealism.10 I like to call this the age of biocybernetic reproduction to name the con- junction of biological engineering and information science that has made it possible to simulate physical organisms in the real world out of bits of data and inert substances." Walter Benjamin's "mechanical reproduc- tion," a paradigm of cultural and technical production based in the as- sembly line and such exemplary figures as the robot, the photograph, and the cinematic sequence has now been replaced by the figures of the clone and the cyborg, the unpredictable, adaptable mechanism. The old opposition between the mechanical and the organic makes no sense or is restaged in films like Terminator 2 as the difference between the rods, gears, pulleys, and servomotors of the "old" Terminator and the new model composed of living, liquid metal. 9.

T Mitchell Romanticism and the Life of Things The slogan for our times then is, not things fall apart, but things come alive. The modernist anxiety over the collapse of structure is re- placed by the panic over uncontrolled growth of structures-cancers, viruses, and other rapidly evolving entities. The premonition of an imminent decoding of the riddle of life repeats a familiar trope of roman- ticism, as we see in the resonance between the Frankenstein narrative and its contemporary descendant, Jurassic Park. Both stories revolve around the hubristic conquest of death and the production of new living things that threaten to destroy their creators. The difference is that Fran- kenstein's monster is human and is composed of recently dead matter, corpses fresh from the graveyard. Our contemporary monster, the dino- saur, is nonhuman, a giant beast driven solely by appetite, and it is resur- rected from material that is not just long dead but absolutely inert, petrified, and fossilized. No physical remains of the original organic tis- sues survive in a fossil, only the image or impression, a purely formal trace in which every atom and molecule of the original has been turned to stone. While this may seem like a narrative that depends for its plausi- bility on contemporary biocybernetics, it is, I will argue, a tale whose foundations were laid in the romantic period. "The life of things" in romantic literature is sometimes mischaracter- ized as a matter for unmixed celebration, as when Wordsworth praises "that serene and blessed mood" in which "an eye made quiet by the deep power/Of harmony" sees "into the life of things." But closer readings of this celebrated passage note that something very like the death of the physical body is entailed in this perception: the breath of this corporeal frame And even the motion of our human blood Almost suspended, we are laid asleep In body, and become a living soul." When Blake raises the question, "what is the material world, and is it dead?" his answer comes from a fairy who promises (when tipsy) to show him "all alive/The world, where every particle of dust breathes forth its joy." Yet the life of matter the fairy goes on to describe is a storm of "dismal thunder," pestilence, and "howling terrors" animating the "devouring and devoured" elements, while human history, the "eighteen hundred years" of Europe, passes as a dream in the mind of a ravished "nameless shadowy Female."'13 Romantic animism and vitalism are not unmixed affirmations, 12.

The stony, petrified sleep of Urizen may be preferable to the pain and terror of living forms. What consolation is it to know that Wordsworth's dead Lucy is "rolled round in earth's diurnal course,/With rocks, and stones, and trees"? Or that his complacent assur- ance of her vitality was expressible only in terms of a "slumber" that "sealed" the poet's spirit like a gravestone and made him perceive her as "a thing that could not feel/The touch of earthly years"?14 What is this new, heightened perception of thingness-of materiality, physicality, objecthood-really all about? Foucault suggests an answer in The Order of Things. If things are taking on a new life in the romantic pe- riod, if biology is replacing physics as the frontier of science, if new forms of archaic and modern animism and vitalism seem to be springing up on every side, it is because history itself is abandoning Man and moving into the nonhuman world, the world of physical things. We usually suppose exactly the opposite to be the case. As Foucault puts it: We are usually inclined to believe that the nineteenth century, largely for political and social reasons, paid closer attention to human his- tory.... According to this point of view, the study of economies, the history of literatures and grammars, and even the evolution of living beings are merely the effects of the diffusion ... of a historicity first revealed in man. In reality, it was the opposite that happened. Things first of all received a historicity proper to them, which freed them from the continuous space that imposed the same chronology upon them as upon men. So that man found himself dispossessed of what constituted the most manifest contents of his history.... The human being no longer has any history.15 The age of the greatest historical upheavals, of massive political, social, and cultural revolutions, of the invention of history itself, is also, as Hegel insisted, the age of "the end of history," a romantic slogan that has been echoed in our own time in reflections on the end of the cold war.16 Once again biology is at the frontier of science, new nonhuman life- forms are everywhere, and a new history of physical objects seems to be rearing its head. Cloned sheep, self-reproducing robots, and the frozen DNA of a Siberian mammoth are front-page news, and images of extinct monsters revived from the dead dominate the world of cinematic spec- tacle. How can the "life of things" in the romantic period help to illumi- nate these images? 14. Wordsworth, "A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal," 11. 7-8, 1, 3-4, p. 115. 15.

Beaver and Mammoth Consider two physical things-two animals, in fact-that arrived in Europe in the 1790s. One is a mammoth, reconstructed in Paris by Georges Cuvier in 1795 to demonstrate his new theory of fossils, which transforms them from freaks of nature or mere curiosities into traces of extinct life and evidence for a series of catastrophic revolutions in the history of the earth.17 The other is a beaver, and it arrives in London in 1790 tattooed on the chest of an Englishman named John Long, who worked as a fur trader among five nations of Canadian Indians. Long had been initiated as a Chippewa warrior while working as what we would now call a military advisor to Indian tribes who were fighting as allies of the British against the American colonies. The scanty biographi- cal studies of Long invariably raise the question of whether he scalped or killed American civilians or soldiers while participating in raids.'8 But Long himself is silent about his participation in violence. He is at his most eloquent in describing the exquisite torture of the three-day initiation ceremony. He undergoes the following operation. Being extended on his back, the chief draws the figure he intends to make with a pointed stick, dipped in water in which gunpowder has been dissolved; after which, with ten needles dipped vermilion, and fixed in a small wooden frame, he pricks the delineated parts, and where the bolder outlines occur he incises the flesh with a gun flint. The vacant spaces, or those not marked with vermillion, are rubbed in with gunpowder, which produces the variety of red and blue; the wounds are then seared with punk-wood to prevent them from festering.'9 Long's name for the animal inscribed on his body is "totem," a word from the Ojibway language usually translated "he is a relative of mine" and associated with ideas of animal, vegetable, and sometimes mineral "tute- lary spirits," and thus with destiny, identity, and community.20 The mammoth on display in Paris and the beaver on John Long's chest are "forms of animal visibility," to borrow Foucault's expression (OT, 17. See Martin J. S. Rudwick, Georges Cuvier, Fossil Bones, and Geological Catastrophes (Chicago, 1997). 18. A copy of Long's memoir in the John Carter Brown Library, Providence, R. I., contains handwritten notes by George Coleman, Senior, complaining that "this book had better never been published for it adds fresh disgrace to the English nation, and hurts our character, as it shews that we neither act like Christians or men of common honesty in Canada" (A Catalogue of Books Relating to North and South America in the Library of John Carter Brown [Providence, 1871], vol. 2, pt. 2). 19.

Long's "totem" is a new word in the English language, and it quickly circulates in French and German translations of Long's memoir.21 Of course the longer range fortunes of this word are legendary. By the mid-nineteenth century it had become a staple of early anthropol- ogy and comparative religion. It travels to Australia and the South Pacific, where "totemism" is discovered in its purest form in Aboriginal societies. In the work of Durkheim and Freud it becomes a key to explaining, not just primitive religions, but the foundations of sociology and psychology; it is the object of obsessively thorough critique by L6vi-Strauss and enters popular consciousness in its linkage with the so-called totem poles of the Pacific Northwest coast Indians. In common usage, it is often confused with fetishism and idolatry or equated with animism and nature wor- ship.22 If Long brings a new object into the world with a new word from the New World, Cuvier takes an old word-image-idea complex-the fossil- and gives it a revolutionary new meaning. Foucault could not be more emphatic: "One day, towards the end of the eighteenth century, Cuvier was to topple the glass jars of the Museum, smash them open and dissect all the forms of animal visibility that the Classical age had preserved in them" (OT, pp. 137-38). In this epistemic revolution, natural history be- comes truly historical for the first time, opening up what Wordsworth would call "time's abyss" unimaginably greater than human history.23 We could debate endlessly whether Cuvier's theory of the fossil as a trace of a life-form wiped out by geological revolutions was an echo of the French Revolution or whether the understanding of that revolution is itself a 21. While no sales figures on Long's memoir are traceable, it seems to have achieved fairly wide circulation. Joseph Banks, the president of the Royal Society, headed the list of subscribers. It was favorably reviewed in anon., "Voyages and Travels of an Indian Inter- preter and Trader," Monthly Review (June 1792): 129-37, and was translated into French (1794, 1810) and German (1791, 1792). See Quaife, "Historical Introduction," in Long, Voyages and Travels in the Years 1769-1788, pp. xvii-xviii. The fortunes of the word and concept totem between the 1790s and the 1850s remain a missing chapter in intellectual history that would be fascinating to explore. It would involve, among other things, finding out how this North American Indian word is merged with the Polynesian vocabulary of mana and tapu by Andrew McLennan and E. B. Tylor to become a fixture of comparative religion and ethnography in the second half of the 19th century. I'm grateful here for the help of Raymond Fogelson of the department of anthropology, University of Chicago, for sharing with me his unpublished manuscript on Long's memoir. 22.

T Mitchell Romanticism and the Life of Things product of the new sense of natural history.24 In any event, the new mean- ing of fossils quickly becomes a metaphor for human as well as natural history and specifically for the human relics left behind by the French Revolution. Edward Bulwer-Lytton finds "fossilized remains of the old regime" in certain districts of Paris and describes an aging English bar- onet as "a fossil witness of the wonders of England, before the deluge of French manners swept away ancient customs.""25 "Fossilism" is a way, in short, of revolutionizing natural history and naturalizing revolutionary human history. Under the spell of this metaphor, political revolution comes to be seen less as a matter of human agency and control than as a product of inhuman, impersonal forces, the life of physical things going out of control in catastrophic upheavals. 5. Forms of Animal Visibility The simultaneity of two events is no less a historical fact than their succession. -MICHEL FOUCAULT, "Sur les fagons d'6crire l'histoire"26 What is the relation between the appearance of the fossil and the totem? Foucault makes the fossil the centerpiece of his history of epistemic trans- formations in The Order of Things. The fossil is the principal example of this new "historicity of things" that is independent of human affairs and human history. But he is silent on the other new natural object, the totem. This is surely because totemism arrives unobtrusively, in the memoirs of an obscure Englishman whose name survives only as a footnote in the writings of anthropologists. Cuvier's notion of the fossil, by contrast, was a revolutionary breakthrough and an international sensation in learned circles. Nevertheless, there is something uncannily fitting about the emer- gence of these two concepts in the 1790s, something that resonates be- tween them both in their internal logics and in their subsequent careers in intellectual history. Fossils and totems are both "forms of animal visibil- ity," images of natural objects, residing on the border between artifice and 24. Exposing the futility of this debate is, I take it, one of Foucault's key contributions to historical study. My aim here is to describe, not explain, the transformation that made the fossil central to a new system of cognitive and intellectual relations.

The fossil is the natural sign par excellence, an imprint in stone, sculpted by petrifaction. Seeing the fossil as a picture or symbol of any kind, however, requires human eyes to pick out the image/organism in the stony matrix. Even a devout anti-evolutionist like Hegel had to ac- count for fossils as readable images. His strategy was to deny that fossils ever actually lived and then died; on the contrary, they are still-born.... It is organoplastic Nature which generates the organic ... as a dead shape, crystallized through and through, like the artist who repre- sents human and other forms in stone or on a flat canvas. He does not kill people, dry them out and pour stony material into them, or press them into stone.... What he does is to produce in accordance with his idea and by means of tools, forms which represent life but are not themselves living: Nature, however, does this directly, without needing such mediation.27 The totem also occupies the nature/culture frontier. It is traditionally a handmade image in wood, stone, or skin of an animal; less often it is a vegetable or mineral object. The animal itself is also the totem (though Durkheim will insist that the image is always more sacred than what it represents).28 Natural organisms are not just entities in themselves, but a system of natural signs, living images, a natural language of zoographia or "animal writing" that, from ancient bestiaries to DNA and the new Book of Life, continually reintroduces religion-and animation-into things and their images.29 The central physical objects of paleontology and anthropology, twin sciences of ancient life, are conceived in the same decade: anthropology, understood as the science of the savage, of the primitive ancestor living in a state of nature; paleontology, the science of successive states of nature that existed long before the emergence of human life, long before the forms of natural life that we see around us. By the end of the nineteenth century, fossils and totems will serve as the principal display objects of 27. G. W. F. Hegel, Hegel's Philosophy of Nature, trans. A. V. Miller (Oxford, 1970), p. 293. I'm grateful to Robert Pippin for his advice on Hegel and natural history. 28. "We arrive at the remarkable conclusion that the images of totemic beings are more sacred than the beings themselves" (Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, p. 156). This is surely because the image of the totem animal, like that of the fossilized specimen, is the site where the species being of the individual is "crystallized," as it were, and rendered as a kind of concrete universal. 29. The DNA revolution has not, as one might suppose, utterly secularized the con- cept of the living organism. Robert Pollack, a collaborator of James Watson, finds the image of the holy city with the sacred text at its center the ideal metaphor for the cell: A cell is not just a chemical soup but a molecular city with a center from which critical information flows, a molecular version of King David's Jerusalem. That walled city ... had a great temple at the center and a book at the very center of the temple.

T Mitchell Romanticism and the Life of Things museums of natural history, especially in North America. The relics of ancient life and of so-called primitive life will anchor the biological and cultural wings of these institutions. Fossil and totem are windows into deep time and dream time respec- tively, into the childhood of the human race and the earliest stages of its planet. Fossilism is modernized natural history, based in comparative anatomy, systematic notions of species identity, and a mechanistic model of animal physiology.30 Totemism is primitive natural history, what anthro- pologists now call ethnozoology and ethnobotany, a combination of magi- cal lore and empirical folk wisdom.31 The fossil is the trace of a vanished life-form and a lost world; the totem is the image of a vanishing, endan- gered life, the trace of a world disappearing before the advance of exactly that modern civilization that has invented the concept of fossils as a trace of extinct life. If fossils are the evidence for a first nature totally alien to human culture, totems are evidence for what we might call a first second nature, a state of culture that is much closer to nature than our modern world. Both fossils and totems are images of nature, expressing a relation- ship between human beings and the nonhuman physical world of animal, vegetable, and mineral objects. There are no human fossils, according to Cuvier, and totems are almost never human images, but are invariably drawn from the natural world, a feature that distinguishes them from the tendency to anthropomorphism in idols and fetishes. 6. Totems as Fossils, and Vice Versa In a very real (if metaphoric) sense, then, totems are fossils, and fos- sils have the potential to become totems. The first possibility is illustrated by Freud when he opens Totem and Taboo by noting that "taboos still exist among us" and do not differ in their psychological nature from Kant's "categorical imperative," which operates in a compulsive fashion and rejects any conscious motives. Totemism, on the contrary, is something alien to our contemporary feelings-a religio-social institution which has been long abandoned as an actuality and replaced by newer forms. It has left only the slightest traces behind it in the religions, manners and customs of the civilized peoples of to-day. 30. See Rudwick, Georges Cuvier, Fossil Bones, and Geological Catastrophe on Cuvier's in- sistence on a mechanical model for anatomy.

Edward B. Tylor, the founding father of modern anthropology, laid the groundwork for theories of "social evolution" in his "'doctrine of surviv- als,"' the preservation of what The Dictionary of Anthropology calls "obsolete or archaic aspects of culture" as "living cultural fossils."33 Fossils become totemic, on the other hand, when they escape (as they inevitably do) from the grip of scientific classification and become objects of public display and popular mythology. I have traced some of this pro- cess in The Last Dinosaur Book, exploring the transformation of the Ameri- can mammoth or mastodon into a national icon during the Jeffersonian period and the emergence of the dinosaur as a totem figure of the British empire in the mid-nineteenth century and of American modernity in the twentieth century.34 Given the numerous parallels and analogies between totems and fos- sils, it seems surprising that they have never, to my knowledge, been brought into a metaphorical relationship. This is principally a result, I suspect, of the disciplinary divisions between biology and anthropology, between the "natural" and "cultural" wings of the natural history mu- seum. Fossils and totems cannot be compared with one another. The one is the trace of an extinct animal, an image reconstructed by the methods of modern science. The other is the image of a living animal, as con- structed within a premodern set of religious or magical rituals. To com- pare fossils and totems is to undermine the difference between science and superstition, to violate a taboo against mixing distinct kinds of objects and genres of discourse. Nevertheless the very proximity of fossil and totem images in public displays, especially in the natural history museums of North America- in New York, Washington, D.C., Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Toronto- makes the metonymic, if not metaphoric relations of these images unavoidable. Perhaps most dramatic is the central hall of the Field Mu- 32. Freud, Totem and Taboo, 13:xiv, 1. 33. Thomas Barfield, "Edward Burnett Tylor," The Dictionary of Anthropology, ed.

Jefferson gathered Delaware Indian legends about the mastodon, and later ethnographers noted Sioux legends of a subterranean monster that were probably based on large fossil bones. Adrienne Mayor's recent book, The First Fossil Hunters: Paleontol- ogy in Greek and Roman Times (Princeton, N.J., 2000) points out that Greek and Roman im- ages of the griffin, as well as legendary wars of primeval giants and monsters were very likely based on the large fossil bones to be found in Turkey and Asia Minor.</page><page sequence="14">180 WJ. T Mitchell Romanticism and the Life of Things seum in Chicago, in which the most prominent objects of display are the Kwakiutl totem poles from the Pacific Northwest and (now) the Tyranno- saurus rex named Sue.35 Fossils and totems coexist and greet each other in the natural history museums of North America even if they have not yet acknowledged their kinship. The romantic and the North American genealogies of these institutions make it seem somehow appropriate to stage their encounter at a meeting of the North American Society for the Study of Romanticism. 7. The Romantic Image and the Dialectical Object What does all this add up to for the study of romanticism and its legacy? In one sense, of course, I am simply revisiting very old and famil- iar territory in romantic studies, the regions that Arthur Lovejoy long ago designated by the names of "organicism" and "primitivism."36 Both fossils and totems are concrete instances, physical, minute particulars that instantiate these very broad conceptions. Each is both "organic" and "primitive" in its way, providing a glimpse into the deep past and the deep present of physical things from the different angles of nature and culture. So you might well ask, what is gained by focussing so minutely on these exemplary objects? One hopes, of course, that concreteness and specificity will be sources of added value in themselves. Marx's key contribution to the his- tory of ideas, in my view, was his insistence on tracing what he called the "concreteness of concepts" to their origins in practical, historical circum- stances (a matter I discuss at some length in Iconology).37 But he did not perform this maneuver with the notion of fixing a metaphysical origin in material things but rather to trace the dialectics of the object, its shifting placement and significance in human history. The theory of the commod- ity fetish proceeds by refusing to reduce either the commodity or its an- thropological analogue, the fetish, with an iconoclastic critique that denies or destroys the "life of things."38 Like Nietzsche, Marx refuses the strategy of straightforwardly smashing the idols of the mind, the tribe, or the marketplace. Instead, he "sounds" the idols with the tuning fork of his own critical language, makes them speak and resonate to divulge their hollowness, as when he invites the commodity to talk about its own life.39 35. Before Sue became the main attraction in the Field's great hall, "she" was pre- ceded by an impressively tall Brachiosaurus, which now scrapes the ceiling of the United Airlines terminal at O'Hare airport. 36.

The other half is the abstract, metaphysical, and imagi- nary character of these objects, their lives not only as real objects, but as words circulating in the new discourses of paleontology and anthropol- ogy and (beyond that) in new commonplaces and poetic tropes. But to call them tropes is already to associate them with that strange attractor, the image, that has always bedeviled romantic poetics. Romanticism has circulated obsessively around the notion of the image, understood as both the origin and destination of literary expression, from Coleridge's "living educts of the imagination," to Blake's graphic images, whose bo- soms we are encouraged to enter as friends and companions.40 In his classic essay "Intentional Structure of the Romantic Image," Paul de Man begins with the thoroughly uncontroversial claim that imag- ery and imagination (along with metaphor and figuration) take on an unprecedented centrality in romantic poetics and that this is coupled with a new concentration on nature: "An abundant imagery coinciding with an equally abundant quantity of natural objects, the theme of imagi- nation linked closely to the theme of nature, such is the fundamental ambiguity that characterizes the poetics of romanticism."4' But why is this an ambiguity? Why does it constitute, in de Man's words, a "tension be- tween two polarities" rather than a natural fit between two domains, the mind and the world, the image and the natural object? De Man's answer is that language itself is what makes the "natural image" impossible for poetry, or even for imagination, and condemns romantic poetry to ex- pressions of "nostalgia for the natural object" (RR, p. 6). "Critics who speak of a 'happy relationship' between matter and consciousness," ar- gues de Man, "fail to realize that the very fact that the relationship has to be established within the medium of language indicates that it does not exist in actuality" (RR, p. 8). The problem I have always had with this explanation is that lan- guage is given too much blame and too much credit for the unhappy consciousness of romanticism. If language as such were the culprit, then the strange ambivalence de Man describes would be the condition of all poetry and not distinctive to the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in Europe and England. "The word," de Man insists, "is always a free presence to the mind, the means by which the permanence of natural entities can be put into question and thus negated, time and again, in the endlessly widening spiral of the dialectic" (RR, p. 6).

T Mitchell Romanticism and the Life of Things But suppose natural, physical objects were already caught up in the dialectic before being put into question by "the word"? Suppose the im- age was not, as de Man seems to think, merely an emphatic expression of language's desire to draw closer to the natural object, but a visible and material entity, a representation in a physical medium like stone or hu- man flesh? Suppose further that these sorts of representations were ap- pearing for the first time in Europe in concrete, public manifestations that resonated deeply with the great historical events of the time? Cuvier's fossil mastodon and Long's beaver totem are, of course, new words, or new meanings for old words. But they are also physical manifestations, a reconstructed assembly of petrified bone fragments and a figure carved and burned on the chest of a veteran of the Indian wars. Language is im- portant, but it is not everything. And poetic language is the place where the world beyond language comes home to roost, at least temporarily. I propose then a revision of de Man's theory of the romantic image, one that preserves its dialectical character and its combination of irony and sentimentality toward the concrete things of the natural world. The romantic image becomes a composite of two concrete concepts, the fossil and the totem. Totemism is the figure of the longing for an intimate rela- tionship with nature and the greeting of natural objects as "friends and companions"--the entire panoply of tutelary spirits from Wordsworth's daffodils to Coleridge's albatross to Shelley's west wind. It is also, as these examples should remind us, the figure of the kind of guilt, loss, and tragic transgression that only becomes imaginable when natural objects enter into a family romance with human consciousness. The totem animal must not be killed; the nightingale was not born for death, and so of course the albatross is killed, and everything that lives must die, even the night- ingale. This is the point where the figure of the fossil enters the picture, bringing with it the spectre not just of individual death but of species extinction. If totemism adumbrates the romantic longing for a reunifica- tion with nature, akin to Hegel's notion of the "flower" and "animal" reli- gions that lie at the origins of spirit's encounter with nature, fossilism expresses the ironic and catastrophic consciousness of modernity and revolution.42 As a petrified imprint, both icon and index, of a lost form of life, the fossil is already an image, and a "natural image" in the most literal sense we can give these words. As verbal figure, moreover, the fossil is an image of the very process that de Man associates with "the medium of language." Emerson is perhaps the first to say this explicitly when he declares that Language is fossil poetry. As the limestone of the continent consists of infinite masses of the shells of animalcules, so language is made 42. See Hegel, Phenomenology of Spirit, trans. Miller (Oxford, 1977), ??689-90.</page><page sequence="17">Critical Inquiry Autumn 2001 183 up of images or tropes, which now, in their secondary use, have long ceased to remind us of their poetic origin. But the poet names the thing because he sees it, or comes one step nearer to it than any other. This expression or naming is not art, but a second nature, grown out of the first, as a leaf out of a tree.43 If the romantic desire for an image to secure an intimate communion with nature is itself a form of totemism, the inevitable defeat of this desire is named by the fossil, which turns out to be a name for the dead images that make up language as such. The living origin of language is in meta- phor. And the first metaphors, as commentators from Rousseau to John Berger have remarked, were animals. As Berger puts it (writing as confi- dently as if he were Rousseau), "The first subject matter for painting was animal. Probably the first paint was animal blood. Prior to that, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the first metaphor was animal."44 Totems and fossils are both animal images, one living, organic, and cultural (but archaic and obsolete), the other dead, mechanical, and natural (but brought back to life by modern science). When Adorno comes to his critique of "World Spirit and Natural History" in Negative Dialectics, his aim is not just to overturn Hegel's thor- oughly ahistorical and mythic notion of nature, the "organoplastic" artist of fossil images. He is also, like Benjamin, aiming at the formulation of dialectical images, which would capture "the objectivity of historic life" as a form of "natural history." Marx, Adorno reminds us, "was a Social Darwinist" who recognized that no amount of critique would allow the "natural evolutionary phases" of "modern society's economic motion" to be "skipped or decreed out of existence."45 This dynamic and evolution- ary notion of natural history can, of course, become as rigid an ideology in its lockstep sequence of phases as the timeless order of ideological na- ture that it opposes. Among the many lessons we might learn from the simultaneous onset of fossilism and totemism in the romantic era is that when new objects appear in the world, they also bring with them new orders of temporality, new dialectical images that interfere with and com- plicate one another. Just when we think that things are safely dead, fossil- ized, petrified, and consigned to the past, they rise from their graves of natural extinction and cultural obsolescence.

T Mitchell Romanticism and the Life of Things modern anthropology and geology, together weave a spell of natural im- agery in the poetry of the romantic era, an imagery that continues to haunt critical theory today. It is perhaps not so surprising that the romantic image should turn out to be a combination of fossilism and totemism, a dialectical figure of animation and petrification, a ruinous trace of catastrophe, and a "vital sign." After all, romanticism itself plays something like this double role in our sense of cultural and literary history. Why does the professional formation known as romantic studies have such a peculiar and persistent life in the academic study of cultural history? Is it not because we take a more than professional interest in this period and its ideologies? Not con- tent with "historicizing" romanticism, we seem to want it to do more for us, to revive and renovate our own time. Is not romanticism itself a fossil formation in the history of culture, not only because of its obsession with lost worlds, ruins, archaism, childhood, and idealistic notions of feeling and imagination, but because it is itself a lost world, swept away by the floods of modernity it attempted to criticize? And is not romanticism therefore itself a totem object, a figure of collective identification for a tribe of cultural historians called romanticists and, beyond that, for a structure of feeling more generally available to anyone who identifies him- or herself as a romantic? The survival of this structure of feeling, and the poetic and critical resources it makes available, is a story that goes beyond my limits here. Suffice it to say that the critique of modernity that runs through Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud to Benjamin and Adorno would be unthinkable without the special form of natural history be- queathed to us by the romantics, captured in its particularity by the fig- ures of the fossil and the totem. Bruno Latour has assured us that, in reality, "we have never been modern,'46 and I would only add that this must mean we have always been romantic. 46.
