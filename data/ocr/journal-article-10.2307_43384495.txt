<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNSET SAATS, UPSET SIHHATS: A Fatherless Approach to The Clock-Setting Institute* By Süha Oģuzertem 1 The readings I have in mind are those by Ayvazoglu, Kaplan, Kutlu, Moran, and Timur, which foster such views in whole or in part. Moran' s is the most comprehensive and significant among them. As I will shortly expound, the doubts and conflicts Moran sincerely expressed point to the crucial issues in the reading of the novel. In his recent book on Tanpmar (which I received after the first presentation of this paper), Oģuz Demiralp also joins the other critics in his reading of the novel (101-10); I was glad to see, however, that although they did not affect Zaman denen §ey onun için akiciliģini kaybetmi§ti. Her gelecek lâhza ayri bir korku âdeta içinde büyür, öyle karçisina çikardi. Forty years after its publication, Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar's enigmatic Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitiisii continues to beguile its readers and mislead its critics. Despite the laudatory remarks it regularly receives, we are still far from completely com- prehending what the novel is all about, how it holds together if it ever does, and the nature of the questions it internally deals with. It might be remembered that the extensive account of a series of psychoanalytic sessions in the text not only convinced the novel's critics of the absurdity of psychoanalysis itself, but also made them think that they had aligned themselves with the true intentions of the author when they turned against psychoanalysis as such. Hardly bothered by the fact that the analysand in question, Hayri trdal, was both the protagonist and the narrator of a fictional text, critics even pronounced, with a matching sense of duty, the narrator-protagonist-analysand all innocent by suppressing Tanpinar's postscript to the novel, which maintained that Hayri trdal was a mentally disturbed person, a paranoiac. Although it is amusing to think that this curious state of affairs was instigated, in the first place, by a dutiful resistance to existentialist absurdity (which the text refers to), it will be wise to remember that there is no simple interpretive failure in the cultural field. In fact, this misalignment can be seen as emblematic of a whole gamut of critical assessments of Tanpinar's novel, such as its reading as historical reflection, as social criticism, and as satirical protest.1 The evidence in Tanpinar's other four novels, which revolve around themes of imaginary and 3 *1 would like to thank Yasemin Alptekin-Oģuzertem, Walter G.

Still, the overall pattern of vaguely analogical and literal-minded approaches to this novel can be viewed as part of a historical setting whereby the reader /critic confronts works of art only, and inevitably, in terms of culturally familiar models. Understandably, the general difference of Tanpinar's high modernist art from his predecessors' creates unique difficulties for reading strategies based on less individualistic and, in the Turkish soil, more familiar conceptions of literature. Hence, it seems that the persistent misreadings of Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitüsü did not result, as a leading theorist put it, "from the misapplication of the rules, but from the application of the wrong rules" (Rabino witz 175). Nevertheless, there are at least two redeeming aspects of the previous criti- cisms of Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitüsü which I do not want to underestimate. One is the truly enigmatic nature of this novel, whose baffling complexity as an uncon- ventional narrative remains unmatched in Turkish literary history - all the more so if one remains oblivious to its private language, to its innumerable hints that there is such a thing to worry about. The novel's resistance to critical interpretation is proven by the way it defies simple synopsis. Any attempt to convey more than a bare outline is destined to be complicated by the enigmas that surround the characters and the events. Even the following is not entirely dispassionate: The narrator, Hayri Irdal, a man of ambiguous attributes, has seemingly been a victim of adverse circumstances throughout his life; his memoirs, which he relates at the age of 60, include his peculiar accounts of his marriages, his occult quest for treasures, his analytic therapy, his membership in a psychic society, and his involvement in the founding of a clock-setting institute. The profound mysteriousness of these events is not screened by the surface readability and the amusing quality of the narration. Likewise, one cannot blame the critics for their good faith in thinking that they were sharing with the author fundamental ethical assumptions about life, as they saw them propounded in the novel. When, for instance, Mehmet Kaplan described one of the central figures of the novel (Halit Ayarci) as "a hideous impostor who does not believe in any social, moral, and religious value," he must have been thinking that he had grasped the satirical principle that informed this "masterpiece of Turkish literature," written by his teacher; Kaplan believed that the novel meant ^ to symbolically "disclose the mentality of a period" in Turkish history (Kaplan 143). Similarly, Berna Moran, who wrote the most perceptive essay (which I will later discuss) on the novel, revealed his good intentions when he highlighted the D emir alp' s particular reading, his book contained ideas that I had found relevant myself (especially those on the mirror, the mother, and narcissism, 28-38). Timur's interpretation, on the other hand, is distinguished by his neglecting the serialization date of the novel (1954) and founding his sociopolitical "analysis" on a faulty premise. Tanpinar's indispensable postscript to the novel can be found in Alptekin 32-36.</page><page sequence="3">UNSET SAATS, UPSET SIHHATS "traditional values" Hayri trdal stood for; he even reproached Tanpinar for "unnec- essarily misleading and encumbering the reader" by complicating the protagonist's perspective; Moran thought the narrator-protagonist was primarily a sympathetic figure with whom one could easily identify (Moran 312, 327, 329). My unwillingness to contest in detail every idea maintained by each critic will, I hope, be justified by the fundamental difference of my approach to Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitiisii. In my view, this novel does not represent an exception among Tanpinar 's works; it is no more "historical" or "social-critical" than his other fictional writings; neither can it be properly called "satirical," given the skimpiness of such concerns in the text. I will propose here a different way of looking at this novel, which is consistent with the author's general literary output and his artistic intentions. Although it is not realistic to aim at a comprehensive analysis of the novel here, it will be possible to illustrate a reading strategy that heeds a warning buried in the very texture of the novel: "We customarily read superficially" (286). The discussion, accordingly, will take up issues which seem to me to be of pivotal importance for an introductory approach to this novel. The argument will underscore the importance, for an acceptable reading, of acknowledging the "private language" the author has cultivated; it will show the way this appreciation alters the received understanding of the key concerns of the novel; and it will highlight the reason this new understanding obliges us to redesignate its genre. Primarily, there is a pressing need to understand the fundamental aesthetic procedures of Tanpmar's fiction, namely, the techniques of symbolization and doubling.2 If we do not suspect the existence of the private language generated and constituted by these techniques we will do no more than scratch the surface of this enigmatic novel. Any reading that fails to come to terms with these techniques and the implicit meanings communicated through them is bound to remain seriously flawed. And once it is established that in Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitiisii things happen at quite a different level than ordinarily understood and previously expressed, we can search for a more fitting designation of genre, which will not hastily accommodate social criticism and satire, but will be consonant with Tanpinar' s philosophical and artistic intentions. SYMBOLIC TRUTHS A dedicated reading of Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitiisii must be attentive to the symbolic usages that permeate it from cover to cover, and more so in this novel than anywhere else in Tanpinar ' s work. If we can identify the symbols and properly interpret the partial truths they reveal, we will have some chance of dispelling ^ the enigma that surrounds this novel. "Symbols" as used here consist of those usages that refer us to different meanings than initially understood and readily recognizable. As the analysis of such symbols as "the house," "the book," "the clock," and "the East" in the case of Mahur Beste showed, symbolic usages in 2 In analyzing Mahur Beste (1944), Tanpinar 's first novel, I have dwelt on these issues at some length (Oģuzertem).</page><page sequence="4">Siiha Oģuzertem Tanpinar are not easy to demarcate and interpret. Although they all express an idea or ideas, these symbols may variously surface as an image, or as a concept, they may be attributed to a figure, they may be buried in the name of a character or a social entity; in fact, since they may belong to any part of speech, initially they are indistinguishable from the author's usual idiom. For instance, an innocent reader of Mahur Beste would not suspect that "the East," like "the house," stands symbolically for maternal presence, that "books" refer us to feminine attire, and that broken "clocks" suggest ideas of bodily incoordination, deficiency of self-control, and fragmented body-image. On the other hand, we would not be able to arrive at these ideas if they were not expressed in the text via other means, such as suggestive silences, repetitions, and articulated metaphors. However, what can be designated as symbol emerges once the necessary decontextualization occurs, that is, when the particular usage acquires a life of its own, independent of the context of customary usages in which it is embedded. When Hayri írdal says, in a manner that is itself decontextualized: "My life has been spent in learning words. I rebuilt my lexicon at each phase of it" (146), he is referring to the special language of symbols that structures his "memoirs." The process whereby the symbol emerges reminds us of the other major aesthetic procedure of Tanpinar's art: doubling and reduplication. The double, too, betrays a process of decontextualization at its origin. We suddenly face a figure whom we have met before. Many traits of the new figure overlap with the old one, which is why there are hardly any thoroughly individuated characters in Tanpmar 's fiction, but a series of repetitive character traits that coalesce around now this, now that name; they thereby operate according to the primordial processes of mirroring and splitting, the proliferation and intermingling of identities, processes which are regularly addressed in postfreudian analysis. The philosophical and psychological ideas /truths Tanpinar intimates through these symbols and doubles, here as elsewhere, always gesture towards a problematic configuration of identity, an impossible longing for a primal other, and futile love /hate relationships that betray underlying family romance structures. However simplified, such a background is necessary to locating and deci- phering the individual symbols that permeate Šautleri Ayarlama Enstitiisü. After all, the value confusion and the sense of existential absurdity, the obviously Freudian confluence of the infantile, the oneiric, and the delirious, to which the suppressed postscript to the novel refers, are not only relevant to the discussion of this novel, they lead us to its pivotal concerns. Similarly, the psychoanalytic therapy un- dergone by the protagonist Hayri trdal does not seem to communicate, as some ß critics have believed, Tanpinar's satire against psychoanalysis but symbolic truths maintained by the author throughout this and other fictional writings. Since I do not intend to provide a complete inventory of the ideational equivalents of the novel's symbolic lexicon, it is best to take a closer look at one episode of it while following at least some of the reverberations of the emerging symbols in other parts of the text. The best candidate for such an undertaking seems to be the account of the noto- rious therapy sessions which have caused so much interpretive havoc. Although the choice is somewhat arbitrary, the truly spatial organization of Tanpinar's fictional</page><page sequence="5">UNSET SAATS, UPSET SIHHATS narratives, which is not obscured by the semblance of biographical progression they often display, and the general absence in them of such privileged sections as climaxes and denouements, should be considered redeeming factors. What is more, in terms of symbolic usages, this is a richly endowed section of the novel, where, for instance, sihhat (health) and saat (clock) converge in a perfectly symbolic, that is, non-metaphoric manner. (We will see that the "character" Miibarek will be an exact embodiment of this convergence.) The symbolic relation between sihhat and saat apparently derives from the substandard or catachrestic transmutation of the former into the latter in such Turkish expressions as "Sihhatler olsun'" and "SihhatinizeV - a deformation that allows the liberation of saat as a signifier to assume a new life of its own as symbol. That is why the sense of sihhat is perfectly present in a statement like "Sen saatinden qikâyet ediyordun" (You were complaining about your watch) (154). Once liberated, saat can incarnate private meanings, such as acquiring unmistakable phallic connotations in many sections of the novel (e.g., 27; 40-41; 1 55-57). 3 The meeting of Hayri irdal with his therapist, Dr. Ramiz, takes place in the Department of Forensic Medicine, where our protagonist is sent for the psychiatric evaluation of his legal eligibility. He is charged with the imaginary crime of the imaginary appropriation of an imaginary inheritance, quite a droll chain of events as it appears. In fact, the symbolic nature of the incidents in Hayri írdal's life up to and including this trial is quite successfully disguised behind a farcical unfolding of events, which include such magnificently illusory ventures as the spontaneous dis- covery of treasures, the magical production of gold, and the immediate inheritance of wealth. The primary symbolic import of these enterprises is their suggestion of a total plenitude (such as one hears spoken about in monotheistic, idealistic, mystical, and romantic discourses), which is necessarily placed elsewhere and which is to be arrived at via improbable, and rationally and ethically suspect, means. They belong to puerile, wakeful dreams in which, to use Freudian language, the primary-processes of condensation and displacement, of improbable leaps in time and space, predominate over such secondary-process activities as thinking, learning, and remembering, just as they sidestep, as the text otherwise tells us (62, 77), the ethical standards of hard work, deserving, rightful ownership, and so on. It is mainly because of the improbable nature of these activities that critics tended to see in this part of the novel an analogical rendering of Turkey's pre- Tanzimat period (e.g., Moran 309, Kutlu 334; it is to Moran' s credit that he felt the need to qualify his statement by saying "if I am not mistaken" and "If my interpretation is correct" [309]). What they missed was that Hayri irdal and his doubles engage in analogous pursuits all through their lives. As an idealist in 7 search of the absolute, Seyit Lütfullah's desire to miraculously possess "everything" 3 This process appears to be related to the altered function of the image in modern poetry. "As the metaphorical function of the image becomes uncertain/' writes Karsten Harries, "that image gains a strangely insistent presence" (78). In Tanpmar's novel, alongside the symbolic operation, there are explicit metaphoric uses of saat as well. Most notably, broken and unset docks are likened to sick people in the discourse of Nuri Efendi, who is portrayed in the novel as an ancient man of wisdom for whom metaphoric language is second nature (29, 31).</page><page sequence="6">Süha Oģuzertem while "living in the barren desert of 'nothing' " (43) never subsides - nor does Hayri Irdal's (46, 143). In unpredictable ways, to be sure, the improbable quest for the plenitude of primal origin engrosses every sufficiently developed character in the novel: in Murat, as the name clearly suggests ("wish"), it turns into an hallucinatory wish; in Afroditi, it becomes a virtual retelling of Hayri írdal's story; in Nevzat Hamm, we have another double, and so on. As the postscript's reference to nurseries and cradles also implies (Alptekin 35), Tanpinar is primarily concerned in his novel with obstacles to ontogenetic development rather than the history of the race. In fact, he subtly mocks those who turn everything into a social question, when, for instance, he mentions Dr. Ramiz's "great interest in social problems" (85) and his penchant for "social criticism" (110); he does the same when he talks about Halit Ayarci and Dr. Ramiz's viewing as "true philosophy" (30) of Nuri Efendi's metaphorical conjectures, which are devoid of any "clear argumentation" (30), and very different, of course, from the puristic philosophical spirit Seyit Liitfullah represents. It is highly significant that the account of the encounter between Hayri írdal and his therapist, Dr. Ramiz, should open with our protagonist's thoughts con- cerning his wife Emine. We might easily overlook this passage because of what follows it: the doctor will soon diagnose a "father complex" in Hayri írdal (an expression Freud himself used); the seemingly amusing exchange between the two will ostensibly center on our protagonist's relations with his father; and the therapist will look like an obtuse devotee of the Freudian religion. Prior to the father- centered exchange, however, we read the following: For a moment I remembered what I was afraid of throughout the whole trial. What if they associated my wife with this matter, too? So far the judge had curiously kept her outside the trial. That was a hope. That meant he did not believe in the seriousness of the charge. But then why had he sent me over here? No, he was waiting. They would introduce Emine into this dreadful snare, too. (84) Throughout the novel, Hayri írdal reflects upon this woman with unique senti- ments: when he marries her, she is not a stranger but a familiar figure (69); she is associated with the closure and confinement of the "house" (70); complaining of the complications of his life, Hayri írdal says: "None of this would have happened if she had not died" (296); furthermore, her sickness and death (118) reminds us of the sickness and death of his mother (47-48), not a coincidental correlation in Tanpinar but a regular occurrence.4 The passage thus raises the question about the outcome of Hayri írdal's worry: does his "wife" turn out to be associated with the crime of which he is accused? We have all the literal reasons to answer in the negative, yet all the symbolic reasons for the opposite. Emine safely remains outside the 8 doctor's apparent diagnosis, although implicitly she does not, nor does the truth she represents. 4 See Oģuzertem for the mother-wife unit in Tanpinar's fiction and its various ramifications, one of which, in the present context, is the symbolic import of the signifier "wife." We can add that, because of the association of the French words mère and mer, Hayri írdal's reflections on the sea, which precede those on his wife (84), are not coincidental, either. In this context, we are also reminded of Mehmet Kaplan's repeated emphases, in Tanpinar'in ļiir Diinyasi, on Tanpinar's abiding longing for his mother.</page><page sequence="7">UNSET SAATS, UPSET SIHHATS The first "amusing" incident of the session is Dr. Ramiz's obsessive-compul- sive behavior: in ritualistic gestures, he keeps taking things out of his briefcase, uses them, puts them back, locks them up. During his therapy, our protagonist once advises the doctor to carry the contents of his briefcase on him (88); at another time, he gets upset because the doctor does not put them into his pocket (96). Dr. Ramiz is thus seen as the one who actually needs help, although the significance of Hayri írdal's reaction to these acts will be understood later. Then the doctor starts asking questions about his patient's childhood and becomes interested in the clock named "Mübarek;" whose occasional appearances extend throughout the novel. This is a wall clock with "legs," saved from a fire, one which Hayri írdal's father tried to sell (23). As its name suggests, this is a clock noted for its irregular, unpredictable behavior, and while it is essentially liked by Hayri Irdal's mother (who gives it the name used throughout the text), it is considered inauspicious by his father (25-26). As one would suspect, Mübarek' s anthropomorphic qualities and contradictory parental evaluations are promptly noticed by the doctor. What is not overtly stated is the close parallel between Hayri írdal's life and that of Mübarek, who trails our protagonist throughout his life as though it were his autoscopic second self. For instance, when our protagonist returns home after his presumable recovery, Mübarek is seen in a restored and glittering state, filling a felt emptiness in the house according to his wife's comment (105). Similarly, when Hayri írdal returns to the company of his friends, they inquire about Mübarek as they would about Hayri îrdal himself (109). 5 Once we are in a position to view Mübarek as Hayri Írdal's double, we are not at a loss as to the meaning of the exchange between the doctor and the patient. To the innocent reader's surprise, but in fact quite legitimately, Dr. Ramiz finds it exceedingly significant that Hayri írdal refers to Mübarek as "broken" ( bozuk ) and "neglected" ( bakimsiz ) (87). As we know, in its different uses, bak can denote acts of "looking," "attending," and "caring for," but in Tanpmar's special lexicon, these meanings are not only interchangeable, they also imply loss of self as a result of the specular merger of the object with the subject, or the self's nonexistence in the absence of these transactions; these senses are equally present in his lexicon in notions of possession, ownership, and economic exchange. Seen in this light, Hayri írdal's hope of selling Mübarek to the doctor, as when he says: "I was looking into his eyes hoping that he might buy it" (86), and his father's unwillingness to spend money on it (87), acquire special meanings that are otherwise unintelligible. If these "transactions" did not have degrading implications for Hayri írdal (his surrender of self), he would not have ironically stated: "He was thanking me for the state I was in" (87). Also, when he observes Dr. Ramiz's "looking at my face with utter willpower 9 5 Among its significant roles, we can count Mübarek's association, like our protagonist, with Hayri írdal's paternal aunt (who is part of the series of "wealthy" and "miserly" mother images in Tanpinar), and its inspiring the design of the Institute. Contrary to what has been believed, the significance of the latter structure, which is described at length later in the novel (286-95), is far from trivial; it in fact complements the novel's symbolic system. When carefully read and visualized, Hayri írdal appears very accurate in his architectural project: the surprising anthropomorphic complex portrays a sacrificial victim who is empty inside.</page><page sequence="8">Süha Oguzertem and attention" (88), he is describing the fulfillment of a desire, however unsettling and disorienting that might be. In fact, a full-scale exegesis of the novel has to do justice to the fuller narcissistic, masochistic, and hypochondriacal implications of these "transactions" whereby the solicitations of attention and care invariably have mortifying consequences. These remind us of another corollary of lack of bakim in the novel, Hayri Irdal's earlier narration of his childhood "freedom." When he speaks of freedom as "the chief privilege of my childhood" (20), one thing he has in mind is the lack of concern in the household as to his whereabouts, a neglect that ultimately relegates him to a bystander status in life (20-22), and a situation repeated in the raising of "Ahmet," Hayri irdal's son (152-53).6 Hayri irdal's denial, throughout the session, that Mübarek's malfunctioning, neglect, and close association with his mother have anything to do with him, is therefore belied by another level of signification that professes the opposite. What this section of the text, prior to the diagnosis of the "father complex," points to, is that Hayri irdal's wife Emine (as the signifier of the mother-wife unit and the related longings and dilemmas) does in fact turn out to be associated with Hayri irdal's illness, which he fervidly denies. Ironically, this is unequivocally (but symbolically) established, through a dream, only after he is cleared of the charges and has already undergone the therapy. By contrast, the way this tacit knowledge is communicated between the doctor and the patient during the therapy session is almost imperceptible. We are alerted to it through an ordinary phrase the doctor uses during the first session, but one which does not make sense in the available context. When Hayri irdal demands to be released from the institution, claiming that he is no different from those outside, the doctor responds: "That is a different matter" (90), reiterating an earlier remark to that effect. Because they do not make sense in the context, that is, because they do not fit into the flow of exchange, we are notified of the significance of the notions of "different" and "separate" ( baqka , ayn), which in turn alerts us to the significance of Hayri irdal's reactions to Dr. Ramiz's ritual of diligently keeping things in his briefcase rather than "on himself." Hence, what earlier looked like a silly ritual of Dr. Ramiz can now be thought of as an inability on Hayri irdal's part to conceive separa teness, to regulate his boundaries in relation to others, to have an identity of his own. In fact, his striking dream of Emine (reported at the beginning of the subsequent section) is precisely about the quandaries of psychological birth from specular identification; it renders Hayri irdal's need for, and fear of, differentiation from a primal other (102-4). Therefore, a rigorous exegesis of the novel cannot lose sight of the fact that the themes of 10 the divided self, of the inability to be oneself, constitute the primary focus of the novel, which it treats through references to shadows, garbs, masks, roles, and impersonations. It may be convenient to assume that the novel deals, primarily, with such issues as westernization and cultural identity - issues that we "readily understand" because we "already know." It becomes misleading, however, when 6 The themes of "childhood loneliness" and "lack of attention" are recurrent in Tanpinar. Meanwhile, because of its obvious significance, a fuller treatment of the novel has to consider the way the name "Ahmet" circulates in the text.</page><page sequence="9">UNSET SAATS, UPSET SIHHATS this assumption serves to ignore the piercing existential questions this and other Tanpinar narratives deal with: the diverse problematic implications of fantasies, lies, and fiction in relation to the reality/ factitiousness of existence. On the tenth day of the therapy, Dr. Ramiz comes up with his "funny" diagnosis. The following, though it lessens the dramatic ambience of the episode, represents the gist of his argument: You have a typical father complex. You have not liked your father . . . Which is not very important, for it may be the shortest way to attaining majority (re§it olmak). But you did something more serious ...[...] Subsequent to disliking him, instead of replacing him, you have constantly searched for a father ... In other words, you did not attain majority. You always remained a juvenile! (92) Hayri írdal's enraged defense of himself against what he perceives as vicious attacks, his furious interruptions, his submissive degradation of himself in hopes of deliverance, his interpretation of the doctor's words in a literal rather than a figurative manner, all help to turn this episode into a babel of tongues. While the patient further indicts himself by providing additional evidence for the doctor's claims, the doctor's function wavers between truth-telling credibility and dogmatic certitude. During the episode Dr. Ramiz' s portrayal is sometimes more aberrant than other times, when, for instance, he orders his patient to use his willpower to have certain kinds of dreams (98). Because of such comedic renditions, one may tend to view all of Dr. Ramiz's remarks in terms of a presumed satiric impulse on the part of the author, that is, as automatic and senseless, and thus with global indifference. However, our reading will be less impoverished if we can distinguish the (symbolically) credible from the incredible, and follow the way Dr. Ramiz's comments articulate with the symbolic structure of the novel, with its obliquely uttered truths. For instance, the doctor and the patient implicitly agree that Hayri írdal's father had been trying to interrupt the symbiotic relationship between the "house" and the "clock." The doctor's interpretation of the conflict between Mübarek and Hayri írdal's father is simply corroborated by the patient: when the doctor discerns that the father "wanted to remove [the clock] from the house" (94), it can only be confirmed by Hayri îrdal, who resorts to the same omnipresent "house" symbolism when he reports his father's "animosity towards this clock" and his saying: "it virtually invaded my house" (94). In the same vein, Dr. Ramiz's contention that Hayri írdal's father had been jealous of Mübarek is only outwardly rejected by our protagonist, who says: "You cannot be jealous of a clock . . . How can you be jealous of an object? If it belonged to someone else, maybe. People cannot be jealous of what they own; they might dislike it, get tired of it, throw it away, sell, burn, destroy it, but ..." (94). ļļ In this response, instead of contradicting the doctor, Hayri írdal simply reiterates his own (existentialist) sense of being an insentient automaton, an object acted upon, possessed, used, and discarded by others, ideas that he frequently communicates in other places in his "memoirs" (e.g., 146, 155). Similarly, the seemingly vaudevillian entanglements such as the daughter's being confused with the mother (94) and Hayri írdal's need to assert that he "was not his own mother" (95) - a statement the doctor sanctions, but in which sense? - will become other than what they first seem once we are cognizant of the novel's symbolic structure. These confusions</page><page sequence="10">Siiha Oguzertem between different generations and gender positions are chiefly about Hayri îrdal's inability to ascertain the boundaries of his self, his mistaking himself for his mother and playing the daughter. When our protagonist later gets involved in the Psychic Society, he subtly reveals the fusions and diffusions of his identity in "entangled" impersonations. Finally, the point the doctor makes about our protagonist's lack of jealousy toward his father and Hayri îrdal's confirmation of it (95) is another verification of the basic purport of the novel's symbolic structure, according to which the narrator-protagonist's predicament is conceived in pre-oedipal terms, and thus precludes, because it antecedes, oedipal rivalry itself. In short, the analytic episode, when evaluated with a view of its connections with other parts of the novel (and with Tanpinar's other writings), can be shown to be pointing to the idea that the complications of Hayri îrdal's life are in fact more serious than the "father complex" implies with its oedipal overtones. This interpretation also helps us understand why, prior to his therapy, Hayri trdal associates Emine with the "seriousness of the charge" (84). In other words, even if there is indeed a "father complex" one could speak of, it remains grafted upon an archaic and equivocally introduced "mother complex." Hence, the analytic episode does not remove that weighty truth Emine represents for the protagonist. And probably the most tricky way the narrator expresses this is by telling how, after the therapy, Hayri irdal was dubbed öksüz (motherless orphan) among his friends because of - yes, "because of" - his "father psychosis" (baba psikozu dolayisiyle, 109). Thus, it becomes possible to claim that Tanpinar not only did not ridicule psychoanalysis (his respect for it is captured in Mahur Beste (197)), by skillfully manipulating the exchange between the analyst and the analysand, he gave the episode a preoedipal twist. After a careful reading of all the relevant material in the novel (and also keeping in mind the author's other writings), we are led to the conclusion that it was impossible for Hayri ìrdal, from the start, to successfully traverse the oedipal phase with a "positive" outcome; he remained fixated on a preoedipal, phallic mother, an imaginary extension of his self.7 IMPOSSIBLE MEANINGS What motivated the foregoing analysis was my wish to discount the social- satirical reading of Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitiisü by calling attention to its elaborate symbolic structure and private idiom. This reading grew out of a desire to respond to the requirement to establish a greater correspondence between our reading strategy and the work's compositional technique, which, as in Tanpinar's other 7 This perspective is compatible with both classical and recent psychoanalytic approaches, although Freud's ideas on the preoedipal phase are less known (cf., e.g., Freud, "Female Sexuality"; Inhibitions 33, 50; New Introductory 147-62; for significant recent treatments of the issues referred to, cf. Buckley, Kernberg, Mahler). Interestingly, in his monographical essay on Yahya Kemal, Tanpinar attempted to argue for a "fixation on the mother" in his mentor's case; however, he also felt the need to admit that this thesis did not match the facts of Yahya Kemal' s life, his happy childhood and his general mental equilibrium and unfailing prudence as an adult (182-92); Tanpinar's thesis thus remained inconclusive, if not unsuccessful.</page><page sequence="11">UNSET SAATS, UPSET SIHHATS writings, simultaneously conceals and obscurely reveals otherwise inaccessible and initially unimaginable ideas.

It seems that once we appreciate the extent of the novel's undoing the relationship between saying and meaning, even if it focuses on a single episode of the novel, a reading such as the above is capable of relocating much of the received understanding of the text's structure, thematics, and imagery, and can have a determining effect on the redesignation of its genre. Since realigning works and redesignating genres are intrinsic to literary study, at this juncture, without claiming to have provided the ultimate reading of Tanpinar' s novel, I will allow myself to be inspired by the words of Wayne Booth: "Though actual readers will make of works whatever their generic expectations enable them to make, works themselves work very hard, as we might say, to put up 'dead end' signs and directional arrows that actually work " (435, original emphasis). What is being contested here regarding the genre of Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitiisii is not its status as a novel: however imaginary, its semblance of lived time, of individual character, of empirical reality, are beyond dispute, unlike in some other works in modern Turkish literature that are mistakenly called novels. What we have to discuss, therefore, are its mode, or dominant figurai technique, and the author's standing with respect to his narrative. The continuous and systematic disjunction, in Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitiisii , between what is said and what is meant refers us to two rhetorical strategies both of which perform the said function in their own ways: allegory and irony. Allegorical narratives are distinguished by the horizontal division of levels of signification; in ironic narratives there is constant disagreement within the utterances. I will suggest, without belaboring the argument, that since we find significant evidence of both strategies in Tanpinar' s novel, and of little else, we can specify its mode by calling it "ironic allegory" or "allegory in ironic mood." However, some clarifications are necessary because of the diverse ways these figures are thought of, and the need for further precision in their application to Tanpinar' s text. The exact nature of allegory in Tanpinar is (and I suspect, will be) open to debate as is allegory itself (see, e.g., De Man, Van Dyke, and Whitman). Especially if we associate allegory with the series of straightforward abstract personifications of certain medieval works, it will be found hardly applicable to our author. We can recall, however, those more refined senses of allegory, such as the one Erich Auerbach called "figurai interpretation of history" (75) and "figurai realism" (196), in which, he thought, the congruence between providential design and concrete earthly appearance could be kept both separate and vertically connected, as in Dante's Comedy. We will not be necessarily disrespecting Auerbach's wish to ^ disengage "figurai realism" from allegory if we insist that there is still something of the allegory in those compositions where there is the continuous suggestion of a systematic relationship to another level of discourse which establishes a vertical relationship with the "primary" story.8 Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitiisii is an allegorical 8 See Van Dyke 205-46 for a valuable discussion of the applicability of allegory to Dante's work.</page><page sequence="12">Süha Oģuzertem narrative in this sense, that is, although its "primary" level is "no disposable surrogate" (Van Dyke 215) to its "secondary" level, it can be fully appreciated only to the extent that we can identify the "projection" of the other story upon the first. However, we should not be imagining a transparent relationship between the two levels, a point-by-point congruity along parallel lines. There is rather a ubiquitous copresence of the two levels in our novel, neither of which tells a linear story, and neither, one could somewhat exorbitantly argue, has a plot to speak of. Luckily, we know the story "behind" (or "above") Tanpinar 's works, for he has written and rewritten it. Or, he tried to write it. It is the story of "Adem'le Hawa" (Adam and Eve), which can be found in his Hikâyeler (126-35), and which is a parabolic retelling of the well-known myth. But while retelling it Tanpmar places his emphases such that it turns out to be a separation-individuation story, reminding us of the object relations theory of psychoanalysis, a story of incomplete birth, and of psychosexual and metaphysical fall. The prototypical status I assign to this story stems from the fact that it is the best in a series that reiterate it in different forms: Hayri írdal's remarkable dream of Emine, which I mentioned above, is one of them; "Mad" Seyit Liitfullah's hallucinatory Aselban, the otherworldly and marvelous beloved from whom he is temporarily separated (38-39), is another version of it.9 This is not only a "story of romance" (we need to distinguish it from the melodramatic overtones of "romantic story"), but of the romance, which designates impossible, ill-fated, and narcissistic love, and could be labeled, somewhat clumsily, incestuous love.10 Hence, it will not be an overstatement to say that the majority of Tanpinar 's symbols are about this imaginary origin (cf. house, sea), its absence (cf. clock), and efforts to recover it (cf. mirror); it is through these individual symbols and symbolic usages that we glimpse the "superior" narrative, while it is our awareness of it that enables us to detect its projection onto the "subordinate" one.11 At this point it is hard to resist the temptation to overgeneralize about the nature of allegory, the poor quality of human relationships it often implies, its perennial problem with time, its circular logic, its obsessive this-worldliness all appearances to the contrary, and so on; there is so much in Tanpinar' s novel to justify such views, starting with the obvious parallel between the impersonalism of allegory 9 The name " Aselban/' which recalls asti ben (the true me), is echoed in (a literal interpretation of) Emine's call to Hayri írdal: "Kendine gel " (Come to yourself!) (119). As in other cases of doubling in Tanpmar, the narrators frequently fail to properly distinguish between characters and the relevant personal pronouns that refer to them. 10 This view of "romance" was initially inspired by Denis de Rougemonťs classic Love in the Western World. An argument analogous to the foregoing interpretation is offered by Julia Kristeva in Tales of Love, where she devotes her chapter on contemporary narrative to a discussion of Georges Bataille's Ma Mère, in which, she says, "we are dealing with a mother who knows no taboo, she is preoedipal, the archaic holder of my possible identity. Potentially psychotizing" (371). 11 Because of the extremely divergent meanings that are attached to the term "symbol," I should note that I am using it here in the sense of a unit of signification that partakes in the construction of allegorical narrative. This use downplays the associative, analogical, and - if the emphasis falls on the comparison, rather than the substitution view of it - metaphorical roles sometimes given to it. Hence, since it is found at the intersection of the two levels, its function in the system of allegory is both conjunctive and disjunctive (cf. Van Dyke 43-44). 14</page><page sequence="13">UNSET SAATS, UPSET SIHHATS and a lifeworld conceived in terms of "clockwork." But I will only emphasize, before I move on, that with its pseudo-plot, the "superior" narrative does not make any more sense than the "subordinate" one does by itself; nor can it "explain" the latter. By pretending to express in language what cannot be comprehended and expressed when both subject and object are eradicated, Tanpinar 's allegory ends up ridiculing culture itself.12 It is easier to reflect upon the irony of Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitüsü than it is to argue for an allegorical reading of it, for it is already handled by previous criticism, albeit in a disapproving way. The frank indecisi veness of Berna Moran' s reflections that accompany his satirical reading of the novel signals the very problem with his generic decision. On the one hand, he is clear about the requirements of satire: "Since satire results from the disparity between traditional, social, and moral values, and those behaviors in life that contradict them, in order for it to be effective there should be a rational system of norms that the author shares with the readers" (311). On the other hand, he notices that the narrator-protagonist does not clearly assume the role of a satirist, for his personality is far from dependable and his norms are ambivalent. Moran finds the resulting narratorial effects "somewhat confusing" (312) and thinks that they go "as far as making the comprehension of the novel impossible" (312). He nevertheless decides that Hayri irdal is for the most part reliable as a narrator and character. After illustrating various satirical techniques, he turns to the introductory section of the novel where irony stands out as the major rhetorical figure. In that section Moran finds the effects of irony "bewildering" (328), but instead of suspecting the dominant use of irony throughout the novel, he reproaches the author for "unnecessarily misleading and encumbering the reader by using the satirical method based on irony at the beginning" (329). According to this, although confusing when used, irony has a very limited function in Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitüsü , for we basically "know which values Hayri îrdal stands for" (327). Evidently, what needs to be dropped for a more "decisive" perspective of Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitüsü to emerge is not the label of irony but that of satire. The fact that what is being ostensibly communicated in the novel is constantly recast in another "language," i.e., the existence and interference of the "other" narrative, creates profound uncertainties regarding our knowledge of Hayri îrdal, his values, and even his capacity to value what is called "value." Perhaps one may even argue that it was Tanpinar himself who tried to warn us on that point in his usual oblique manner. When he was asked in an interview before the serialization of the novel: 'This book has a humorous, satirical aspect, doesn't it?" he answered: "Perhaps . . . Hayri îrdal is a merry man, and he seems to know how to see. He likes to talk, even if it turns against him" (Tanpmar, "Ahmet Hamdi . . ." 554). Hence, not only does the author cast doubt on the satirical view of his novel, he also identifies its true "victim," who is none other than Hayri îrdal. What is being "attacked" in the novel is not injustice or untruth but versions of the narrator-protagonist's self (also cf. 12 Upon hindsight, when Hayri îrdal speaks of 'Very grave matters whose origin I do not know" (9) on the first page of his memoirs, he already announces the "precultural" perspective he is opting for.</page><page sequence="14">Süha Oģuzertem Aiptekin 33). Those myriad objects of the negating passion of the narrator, of his ridicule, caricature, contempt, and disgust are at best partial objects. The obverse of these apparently negative attachments is also true, as evinced by the way mergers take place (both moments are captured in the double). Therefore, when both self and other are alternately and similarly negated, what needs to be abandoned, together with satire and the ethical universe it implies, is the model that requires separate selves to be in relationships. That model will not help us comprehend the logic of affiliations in the novel, or the specific nature of its irony that has chaotic effects.13 It is not the ingenious use of irony as an ingenuous figure of speech whereby one means the opposite of what one says, as in mock humility, blame through praise, or understatement, that creates the turmoil of signification in the novel with its emphatically "absurd," "dreadful," and "demented" effects. Such uses of irony, for instance Dr. Ramiz's contention that "science is orally transmitted" (101) (a statement compatible with satire), do not have the said consequences; the ironist still "coincides" with himself; the acts of meaning and intending remain intact; irony does not mislead. But when the "same" Dr. Ramiz is made to utter seemingly foolish but symbolically significant words, that is, when the narrator makes him mean other than initially understood but ultimately no less foolishly, the chaotic world of unmeaning surfaces. Here we have speech not with a different intention but without intention; meaning is not misplaced but unplaced. When Hayri irdal contends, in a typical moment of Tanpmar 's "dream order," that he is not sick but his "wife" is (93), he is not talking "about" her but "as" her. Ultimately, he is engaging in unmeaning speech. He cannot be found in his utterance, which uproots him. He is so placeless and wretched that he cannot mean by himself. And the proliferation of his identities only ensures his absence. A more comprehensive study of the novel would, thus, show that the im- minent eradication of the act of meaning in the text is intrinsically related to and is only one aspect of the rupture of that culturally acquired signifying process which includes such acts as willing, deciding, judging, valuing, and believing, all of which surface as problematic matters in the novel. One could show, for instance, that Hayri Irdal' s inability to like his father is not an isolated act, for he does not quite conceive an act of liking (see, e.g., 120) that is inconsonant with primitive experiences of infatuation, envy, fear, and rancor. Paul De Man, who was the first, as far as I know, to call attention to the "implicit and rather enigmatic link between allegory and irony which runs through the history of rhetoric" (208) but most conspicuously in German romanticism, 13 In its refusal to adopt a particular standpoint, Tanpmar's narrative (once again) presents a truly modernist character and is in line with cultural developments in the West. One would like to further contemplate why satire has lost its historical appeal in the contemporary western world. The reflex reaction to it we sometimes encounter cannot be unrelated to other tendencies within the culture. I have in mind such oppositions as Italo Calvino's, who dislikes satire's "moralism," finds it lacking in "questioning" and "questing," intimates that it is limited and one-sided, and thinks that it is not sufficiently "detach[ed] from the particular" (62-63). Although open to criticism, these views can nevertheless serve a useful purpose in the debate over the genre of Tanpmar's novel. We notice that those attributes Calvino finds lacking in satire occur frequently in our novel. 16</page><page sequence="15">UNSET SAATS, UPSET SIHHATS interpreted such irony as the knowledge of the inauthenticity of the empirical self (214). According to De Man, "absolute irony is a consciousness of madness, itself the end of all consciousness; it is a consciousness of a non-consciousness, a reflection on madness from the inside of madness itself" (216). De Man further maintained that "The temporal void that [irony] reveals is the same void we encountered when we found allegory always implying an unreachable anteriority. Allegory and irony are thus linked in their common discovery of a truly temporal predicament" (222); he called it "the factitiousness of human existence as a succession of isolated moments lived by a divided self" (226). Tanpinar comes closest to such a description of "temporal predicament" in what appears to be an expunged section of the formerly serialized novel, which I quoted in the epigraph: "What is called time had lost its flow for her [Nevzat Hamm]. Each coming moment, a unique fear would grow in and appear before her" ( Yeni istanbul (1954): instai, no. 38). 14 One can also understand why, in satirical readings of Saatleri Ayarlama En- stitüsü, the distinction between the author and the narrator was so often overlooked, while the image of a traditional or neoclassical author was blended with an equally misconstrued narrator-character. In modern fiction, it was in relation to such "free," "weightless," and nihilistic irony that the correlation between the stifling of the authorial voice and the animation of the chameleonic narrator was most extensively documented (most notably by Booth; also cf. De Man 219, 227). In Tanpinar' s novel, the effect of this transformation is the creation of a realm of "interior dialogue" which displays the realization of the ideal of talking to oneself. That is why our reading strategy should be compatible with this self-immured world of "language- for-oneself " in which stable distinctions between the speaker, the addressee, and the object of speech have disintegrated as they have become intermingled and interchangeable. In this context, it is significant that the postscript to the novel should present Hayri írdal sitting on a bed in a hospital ward, his head between his hands, oblivious to the world outside, and speaking to himself (Alptekin 33), which remind us of De Man's "radical" irony. Accordingly, in its various symbolic uses that intimate the convergence of transcendence and transgression, absence ( yokluk ) (e.g., 147, 238, 245) can be viewed as the key metaphor that unravels the enigma of Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitiisii. 14 It is my wish that new editions of the novel include both the postscript in Alptekin, and the expunged sections.
