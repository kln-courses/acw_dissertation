<plain_text><page sequence="1">KANT'S CONCERN WITH THEODICY MICHEL DESPLAND's recent contribution to the under standing1 of Kant's philosophy of history and philosophy of religion includes one section, 'The Rise of the Problem of Evil',2 which I would like to suggest is somewhat misleading if one were to take it as an adequate indication of the development of Kant's concern with evil and theodicy. Valuable though Despland's study is as a whole, especially in the emphasis it gives to the importance of Kant's writings other than the three great Critiques, it reflects the usual, and to a degree perfectly proper preoccupation of readers of Kant with what the latter had to say about 'moral' evil. Kant's interest in theodicy, however, included a concern with the 'problem' of 'physical' evil. To trace the thread of that concern enables one to proffer some critical suggestions about Despland's account of Kant, with particular reference to the section of his book already mentioned. In 'The Rise of the Problem of Evil' Despland first of all draws attention to Goethe's indignant complaint to Herder3 about Kant's employment of the notion of 'radical evil' in his Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone of 1793. Despland's view is that Kant's discussion of radical evil amounts to a repudiation of aspects of his 'enlightened' past, and hence offers a brief summary of Kant's handling of the problem of evil.4 He refers to Kant's Considerations on Optimism of 1759 ; his essays on the philosophy of history, beginning with the Idea for Universal History of 1784; and the Critique of Judgment of 1790. According to Despland, Kant's essay of 1791, On the Failure of All Attempted Philosophical Theodicies marks a decisive turning-point in Kant's thinking, setting him free for 'the thorough investigation of radical evil in 1793'. The essays in philosophy of history and in political theory after 1793 provide further evidence of his 'philosophical trans formation'. Despland concludes by remarking that Kant preferred to look at the reality of evil 'rather than to repeat the doctrines of the philosophes'.5 The main point I should like to make is that Kant's handling of the problem of evil in all its aspects is one element in his life-long pre occupation with the work of Leibniz. Certainly the writings of others 1 Michel Despland, Kant on History and Religion (Montreal and London; McGill-Queen's University Press, 1973). 2 Ibid., pp. 169-72. 3 Ibid., p. 169. 4 Ibid., p. 170. 5 Ibid., p. 172.

But the concern with Leibniz's work is persistent and demanding, and Leibniz's posing of the problem of theodicy in particular was an inescapable topic in Kant's reflection on theology. It was probably Leibniz who coined the very word 'theodicy'1 to refer to his own extensive discussion2 (first published in 1710) of what he understood to be the theological issues involved, a discussion provoked by the work of Pierre Bayle.3 The Theodicy itself was the one major work out of the many papers and books Leibniz produced by which he chose that most of his contemporaries should know him.4 Because of Leibniz, 'theodicy' meant an expression of the conviction that God had guaranteed the natural order as ultimately right in a way that could be understood as corresponding to God's attributes. Given that conviction, and the confidence engendered by it, man's task was to order his political, social, and moral existence in a way appropriate to the natural order, and therefore, ultimately, also in relation to the divine being. Different though their approaches were, Bayle, Leibniz, and Kant were in complete agreement in that none of them could be satisfied with any other God than one whose goodness was to be adored without hesitation. Bayle may have been an important stimulus to Kant in a number of ways—some of his particular concerns reappear in Kant's work, but it was, after all, Leibniz's thinking on so many topics which had been taken as its own expression by developing German culture.s New editions of Leibniz's Theodicy, and other works of his, and the discovery and publication of more of his writings fostered the appreciation of Leibniz's material, not as though it were a matter of merely antiquarian interest, but as an important source for contempo rary theology and metaphysics. So it is not surprising that some of Kant's earliest papers are discussions of topics raised by Leibniz. For example, his papers of 1754 on the question Has there been a change in the rotation of the earth? and Does the earth grow old? announced an important work of 1755, and indicated some of its themes.6 'Has our globe already 1 J.

The work of 1755, his Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, or, An Essay on the Constitution and Mechanical Origin of the Whole Universe treated according to Newton's Principles was first translated into English by a Professor of Divinity, W. Hastie.1 Kant does not elaborate as Leibniz did in his Theodicy on God's calcula tions when involved in creation, in which Kant sees 'the glory of the Supreme Being break forth with the brightest splendor'.2 He does, however, refer for example, to the 'very plan which the Supreme Wisdom has set before itself',3 and to the way in which relations of the elements and substances of the world evolve 'out of their implanted universal laws by an unconstrained consecution'.4 Creation has 'the character of that stability which is the mark of the choice of God',5 and endless destruction and replacement of creatures is an integral feature of it.6 This work indicates the point of view which will reappear in Kant's 1759 paper on optimism. Criticism of Leibniz on the notion of 'corn possibility' of the 'essences' of things appears in Kant's New Exposition of the First Principles of Metaphysical Knowledge7 also of 1755. In the same work is a paraphrase of some of the other material of the Theodicy ,8 and Kant's preoccupation with the problems raised there was to con tinue for some time. He was thinking in this period of taking part in a competition being organized by the Berlin Academy, the subject having been set in 1753 for 1755. The word 'optimism' had made its appearance in the Dictionaries. 'The connection of optimism with theodicy will be historically clearer if we remember that the word optimism was first used in 1737 in the Mémoires de Trévoux, only twenty-seven years after the appearance of the TheodicéeN The Academy declared that candi dates were required to examine Pope's system as indicated in the proposition 'All is right.' Part of the discussion was to involve a com parison of Pope with 'the system of optimism, or choosing what is best, so as to bring out clearly where they agree and where they differ'.10 In other words, the competition was meant to be a discussion of the work of Leibniz in comparison with that of Pope, though the anti Leibnizians could not name Leibniz as the direct target of their 1 W.

Lisbon had its notorious earthquake on 1 November 1755, however, and Kant first wrote a paper published in 1756 on this disaster, a paper which attempts to relate theological to scientific considerations in a way similar to that of the Universal Natural History. In The History and Physiography of the Earthquakes which towards the end of 1755 shook a great part of the Earth1 Kant showed that he shared the conviction of Leibniz that man has no right to 'expect convenient consequences only from the laws of nature, which God hath ordered'.2 On the other hand it is a mistake to conclude that an earthquake is a punishment for sin. In other words, men cannot presume to 'perspect the designs of the Divine decrees', though they may be confident that 'the whole complex of nature is a worthy object of the Divine Wisdom and of its disposi tions.'3 The essay of 1759, Some Reflections on Optimism,4 also shows him maintaining what could be described as a Leibnizian position. 'From the point where I stand, armed with the insight granted to my feeble intellect, I shall look around as far as I can and learn to under stand more and more: that the Whole is the best, and that everything exists for the sake of the Whole.'5 Despland recounts in his book how a correspondent of Kant's tried to obtain a copy of this essay for himself, but Kant was clearly anxious to have it forgotten, though he was, apparently, prepared to recommend it to his students again, in the 1780s. Despland therefore writes that 'the optimism of Leibniz seems to have exercised a lasting hold over the mind of the mature Kant'6 and so wants to make out a case for saying that there nevertheless came a point where Kant no longer held to that optimism. I would like to propose that this is not so. What Kant did was to limit the scope of theodicy. He took it out of the context of the speculative and contemplative theology exempli fied by Leibniz, in order to restrict it to the context of the philosophy of history. This of course relieved him of the necessity of struggling with the problem of talking about God's attributes in relation to nature. This is not the same thing as not sharing Leibniz's optimistic outlook, however, as I hope to indicate. Kant carried on with the accepted programme of theodicy in so far as it included giving attention to man's ordering of his life in a way appropriate to the natural order, but found a way of doing this despite having to come to explain how it was that he could not be expected to say how the natural order could be understood as corresponding to the 1 I.

Despland does indeed in his book,1 outside the section on 'The Rise of the Problem of Evil' refer both to the Universal Natural History and to the paper on earthquakes. But I think it is because he does not give enough attention to Kant's changing estimation of what he can say about 'God' in relation to 'nature' that he cannot give a fair indication of how Kant arrived at the 'faith' he held in the 1790s, nor of how optimistic that faith always remained. So, for example, Despland writes of the paper on earthquakes: 'To what ridiculous ex tremes Kant was prepared to go in the name of teleology is shown by a short piece on earthquakes which explains the benefits of such apparent calamities. Even the famous Lisbon earthquake (1 November 1755) cannot have been unadulterated evil since it occasioned the appearance of health-giving mineral springs in East Prussia!'2 One could be for given for supposing that the paper on earthquakes was an exercise in the kind of crude teleology satirized by Voltaire that Kant himself finds laughable. I have already pointed out, although very briefly, that the tenor of this essay of Kant's is one of extreme caution towards the interpretation of nature in terms of what suits mankind. The work of Kant's which makes this particularly clear (and which picked up and reused some of the material of the Universal Natural History) is that of 1763, The Only Possible Argument for the Existence of God,3 which offered an a priori 'proof' of God related precisely to a carefully corrected teleology. Kant still proposed in Leibnizian style a contemplative opti mism related to a properly 'scientific' understanding of nature, but it is therefore an optimism stripped of any reference to an immanent or interfering deity. Understanding what Kant said in this work about his confidence in the divine 'all-sufficiency' is most important for what Kant wanted to say about God especially in the Critique of Pure Reason of 1781, and subsequently, but Despland does not take it into account. Nor does he refer to another paper of 1763,4 in which Kant rejected Maupertuis's negative conclusions after the latter's attempt to estimate the sum of happiness and misery in human life. Kant still persisted in accepting the notion that in some sense an increase in the perfection of the world was possible, and this might imply that 'displeasure' as much as 'pleasure' might be an effective stimulus for men, though neither were to be sought as perfections in themselves. So one comment that has to be made on Despland's remarks about Kant's teleology in relation 1 Despland, op. cit., pp. i8f., writing under the heading, "The Context of Kant's Philosophy of History: The Omnipresence of Teleological Statements', pp. 17-27. 2 Ibid., p. 18. 3 Kant/Richardson, Essays and Treatises, ii. 218 f. * Rabel, op. cit., 'Attempt at Introducing Negative Quantities into Philo sophy', pp. 46-50. 4011 C 74 Bb</page><page sequence="6">366 ANN LOADES to his philosophy of history is that he does not seem to have paid sufficient attention to the fact that from the very start of his public career Kant kept a close eye on what was happening in the world of the scientific study of nature. Very early on in his career he was well aware that the relationship between the developing sciences (such as they were in his time) and theology was problematic, to say the least. This in itself, and not simply his growing interest in moral philosophy (which certainly also dates from the 1760s), impelled him to think and to rethink through what he wanted to say about teleology. It is perhaps hardly surprising that he gradually, and possibly reluctantly from about 1763 onwards, turned his attention to a theology which was explicitly not related to the scientific study of nature. So what he had to say about theodicy in relation to physical evil also had to be changed. Attention to the way in which he used the traditional principles of explanation of nature, which had been integrally related to particular theological styles, and detached them from a close association with those styles, is parti cularly illuminating in this respect, though there is no room to discuss the matter here. One may, however, note that his insistent demand for coherence required him to employ 'explanations' such as the fixity of species in a way that was later to be seen to be thoroughly unsatisfactory. What is especially important is that he eventually reached the point where he had to refuse to concede to human knowledge of creatures a replication in some sense of the divine knowledge of creatures. It is at this point that theodicy of the Leibnizian variety became impossible for him. When one turns to Kant's 'critical' writings one finds that he rarely addressed himself to the problems of theodicy directly and explicitly. It is as though he now had to wait to have another look at it, after his reassessment of his whole philosophical stance. Although he could relocate theology on the boundary of human reason it was never again possible for him to construct a theodicy on the basis of an 'explanation' of the operation of the divine perfections in creation. Also, despite his proposals about the validity of teleological thinking it was sometimes imperative for him to recount his despair as a result of his contempla tion of the natural order, and this despite his writing of passages which express an optimism which would not have been inappropriate at an earlier stage in his theological career. So when one looks at the Critique of Pure Reason in this connection one notices that one of the matters, theologically speaking, which was important for him was not so much the discussion of the three traditional ways of proving God's existence, but his criticism of his own position of 1763, and of the kind of meta physical faith which he thought he had there established for himself. In</page><page sequence="7">KANT'S CONCERN WITH THEODICY 367 the Critique, although he re-employed language which a Leibnizian could use in developing the appropriate theodicy, yet he could not allow it to secure for him the conviction which a theodicy was supposed to express. For the work of 1763 Kant had been able to maintain that 'What exists, whether it be possible or actual, is but something, so far as it is given by Him. A human language may let the Infinite speak to himself thus, I am from eternity to eternity, besides me there is nothing, something is but so far as it is through me.'1 But in the Critique he found himself suggesting that 'Unconditioned necessity, which we so indis pensably require as the last bearer of all things, is for human reason the veritable abyss. .. . We cannot put aside, and yet also cannot endure the thought, that a being, which we represent to ourselves as supreme amongst all possible beings, should, as it were, say to itself: "I am from eternity to eternity, and outside me there is nothing save what is through my will, but whence then am I?" '2 There is more at stake here than the choice of a limited range of anthropomorphic language, though certainly this has to be employed, for Kant wants to deny to his concept of God even that a priori certainty which he had once believed he could defend. God's transcendence was to be thought of in accordance with Kant's 'Copernican revolution' so far as metaphysics was concerned. 'God' is to be discussed as an Idea, 'a necessary concept of reason for which no corresponding object can be given in sense experience'.3 Kant salvaged theology from the charge of irrelevance by drawing attention to the point that as he understood the matter, he was led to such an Idea by reason itself, and this suggested to him that the Idea might have a 'regulative' use. Still wanting a way of explaining the possibility of the Universe itself, in terms of 'a supreme intelligence, which in originating the world, acts in accordance with wise purposes',·» he 'thought' of this Idea in a variety of ways. For example, he considered God as 'a transcen dental substrate that contains, as it were, the whole store of material from which all possible predicates of things must be taken'.5 Or one might say of this substrate that it is 'the archetype (prototypon) of all things which, one and all, as imperfect copies (ectypa), derive from it the material of their possibility, and while approximating to it in varying degrees, yet always fall very short of actually attaining it'.6 It might still be considered as the supreme reality which must 'condition the possibi lity of all things as their ground, not as their sum', but whatever was to be said, it was with the important proviso that 'we are left entirely without 1 Kant/Richardson, op. cit. 349. 1 I.

The thread of his concern with theodicy may be traced first of all in his second great Critique, where his discussion of pleasure and pain, and his esti mate of their relevance to his endeavour to ascertain the fundamental principles of his austere ethical views, are obviously open with some justice to Iris Murdoch's comment that 'Kant wants to segregate the messy warm empirical psyche from the clean operations of the reason.'8 Reason has brought him to the point where he could no longer assert that this world is 'the most perfect whole possible'—for we do not 'know all possible worlds (in order to be able to compare them with this)'9—a process of calculation undertaken by Leibniz's God. How ever, Kant could still suggest that 'what the study of nature and of man teaches us sufficiently elsewhere may well be true here also; that the 1 I.

So he commended the Stoic who cried, 'Pain, however thou tormentest me, I will never admit that thou art an evil.' Pain does not diminish the worth of a man's person, but may rather serve to raise his pride, when he can be conscious that he has not rendered himself worthy of punishment.2 Man's experience of physical reality may not encourage him to admire 'the unsearchable wisdom by which we exist'. So there is one important connection which should be noticed between this Critique and that of the Critique of 1790 if one is to appreciate Kant's struggle with the problem of theodicy. One might suppose from the frequency with which it is quoted, that the most significant remark Kant made about God in relation to nature is ex pressed in the famous passage about the starry heavens above and the moral law within, which are as sources inspiring awe, accessible to him as his transcendent deity could not be.3 However his view of the self as 'angelic'4 independent of animality and even of the whole sensible world, even here functions as consolation for him. The very magnifi cence of the starry heavens, and what they are—'a countless multitude of worlds' meant that any special significance man might be thought to have was problematical for Kant because such an 'animal creature', 'after it has been for a short time provided with vital power, one knows not how, must again give back the matter of which it was formed to the planet it inhabits (a mere speck in the universe)'.5 And in his third and last Critique of 17906 and the section of it entitled 'Critique of Teleo logical Judgement', in a somewhat similar passage, Kant described what Allen W. Wood calls man's 'moral despair' about the sensible world, and the exhaustion of hope to which it may lead.2 Righteous men in the world, 'no matter how deserving they may be of happiness, will be sub jected by nature, which takes no heed of such deserts, to all the evils of want, disease, and untimely death, just as are the other animals on the earth. And so it will continue to be until one wide grave engulfs them all —just and unjust, there is no distinction in the grave—and hurls them back into the abyss of the aimless chaos of matter from which they 1 Ibid., p. 246. 2 Ibid., pp. 151-2. 3 Ibid., p. 260. 4 Iris Murdoch, op. cit., p. 83. 5 Abbott, op. cit., p. 260. 6 I.

Such satisfaction as there is may be found to begin with, where Kant acted as 'the logician of Linnaeus' descriptive science',5 and provided himself in the 'Critique of Teleological Judge ment' as the paradigm illustration of what he meant when he wrote of man being able to believe himself to be the final end of creation. This provides us with an initial instance of how he would rephrase a theodicy. The animal and vegetable kingdoms exist in relation to man and the many uses to which his intelligence enables him to put the various forms of life. Man's problem, despite his ability to form such an exalted view of his importance in the natural order, is that precisely that order sub mits him to its destructive as to its constructive forces. The achievement of his own distinctively civilized culture is something for which man must strive despite nature, and despite the way in which his own inner natural tendencies also betray him into self-invented misfortunes.6 And when Kant embarked on the elaboration of his subheading, 'The final end of the existence of a world, that is of creation itself',7 he could extend his discussion of the perfections of God on which he embarked in the Critique of Practical Reason. Since the world is as it is, there seems to be nothing to prevent man falling into utter despair except a kind of courage which seems to Kant to be indispensable if he is not to do 'injury to moral sentiment'.8 This courage allows a man to accept into his moral perspective a cause harmonizing with himself as the end of nature which he may accept with the deepest veneration.9 To return to Despland's section on 'The Rise of the Problem of Evil', Despland remarks that the Critique of Judgement 'in its treatment of purposefulness in the world and of God's moral sovereignty shows no inclination to repeat the position of the Considerations on Optimism, but on the other hand it does not move towards the kind of radical 1 Kant, 'The Critique of Teleological Judgement', in Meredith, op. cit., p. 121. 2 Ibid., p. 29. 3 Ibid., p. 30. * Ibid., pp. 152-3. 5 E.

' Ibid., p. 159.</page><page sequence="11">KANT'S CONCERN WITH THEODICY 371 confrontation with the problem of evil that was to come subsequently.'1 One may agree that Kant is not dealing in the Critique of Judgement in the main with the problems of the 'radical evil' in man and man's need to combat it, but it is not wholly true that Kant shows no inclination to repeat the position of his earlier essay. For one thing one can see in Leibniz's Theodicy that faith in God as rational and good underpins his argument at points where he prefers not to take seriously the objections of finite minds confronted with the experience of physical evil. For Leibniz, we are on the right lines when we think of God as wise, good, and omnipotent, even though we do not fully understand and merely resort to answering objections because it is the best we can do. Leibniz cannot have God brought into discredit because of our experience of living in the world which he has made, and, as we have indicated, neither can Kant, though his tactics, theologically speaking, are inevit ably somewhat different from Leibniz's. For another thing, apart from his neglect of some useful material, Despland has not taken into account here Kant's deliberate and public realignment of himself in the 1790s with Leibniz in his answer2 to Eberhard, and the party of Kant's critics that Eberhard was leading. In that answer Kant described his Critique of Pure Reason 'as the genuine apology for Leibniz, even against his parti sans whose eulogies scarcely do him any honor'.3 So he maintained that he alone was capable of looking beyond what the philosophers of the past actually said to what they really meant to say. The pre-established harmony in particular was meant to indicate 'that we must conceive a certain purposiveness in the arrangement by the highest cause of our selves as well as of all things outside of us. This may, to be sure, be understood as already placed in creation (pre-determined) . . .' This harmony was meant to extend to the agreement between the realm of nature and the realm of grace which Kant described as 'the realm of purposes in relation to the final purposes, i.e. mankind under laws'. This harmony required by morality 'absolutely cannot as the Critique shows, be conceived from the nature of the beings in the universe. Rather, as an agreement which for us at least is accidental, it can only be conceived through an intelligent first cause.'4 So it is not at all clear that in fact Kant ever abandons his optimism though it is perfectly true that in his essay of 1791, On the Failure of All Attempted Philosophical Theodicies, Kant is consciously confronting the Leibniz of the Theodicy.5 But it is hardly possible to draw a sharp 1 Despland, op. cit., p. 171. 2 H.

The interest Kant reveals in theodicy in relation to both moral and physical evil in this whole period is a continuous one, as I hope I have made suffi ciently clear, and the way he finds of rephrasing it is one which he develops in various ways in his different works, with varying emphases. Despland rightly draws attention to the Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose of 1784, and indicates how Kant of course recognizes the problematic character of human history, as did Leibniz. I would here like to draw attention to what Kant said in that work about a hidden plan of nature for the development of the human species, for he believed that in the fulfilment of this plan lay the ultimate 'justi fication of nature—or rather perhaps of providence'. He asked, 'For what is the use of lauding and holding up for contemplation the glory and wisdom of creation in the non-rational sphere of nature, if the history of mankind, the very part of this great display of supreme wisdom which contains the purpose of all the rest, is to remain a con stant reproach to everything else?'1 And in his Conjectural Beginning of the History of Mankind of 1786 he firmly repudiated any time-wasting longing for a paradise or a golden age,2 and urged men to recognize that their own faults were perhaps the cause of the evils that they suffered, and that self-amendment might be the remedy for some of those evils. It is 'corruption of morals' to be discontented with Providence though 'he has traced out for us in our terrestrial world a path so difficult.'3 If the work Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone can fairly be described as concerned with self-amendment, it seems to me clear that Kant had long since, and indeed as early as that 1755 essay on earth quakes, begun to get this particular aspect of the problem into focus, though he had not elaborated his comments on it, before he wrote his 1791 essay on theodicies. In any case, although the whole work of the Religion was not produced until 1793, Book 1 is exactly contemporary with Kant's production of the theodicy essay. Book 1 of the Religion had been passed by the censor in 1791, and was published in the Berlin Monthly in 1792.4 His various manœuvres past the censors to obtain the relevant approval for the rest of the material eventually secured 1 H.

So as a matter of historical description, Despland's assumption that Kant underwent some sort of 'philosophi cal transformation' occasioned by this discovery of a new concept of evil in man can hardly stand up to investigation. It might be possible to make it stand up if an analysis of the work revealed a discrepancy in Kant's understanding of his subject-matter as between the first and the other three sections of his material in the Religion, but he maintains in his 'Preface' that he thought fit to have the first book reprinted with the rest 'because of the close coherence of the subject-matter . . . which contains in the three essays now added, the complete development of the first'.1 Moreover, in this 'Preface' he reveals that he is still concerned with the themes of classical theodicy, for he writes: 'Take a man who, honoring the moral law, allows the thought to occur to him (he can scarcely avoid doing so) of what sort of world he would create, under the guidance of practical reason, were such a thing in his power, a world into which, moreover, he would place himself as a member. He would not merely make the very choice which is determined by that moral idea of the highest good, were he vouchsafed solely the right to choose; he would also will that such a world should by all means come into exis tence (because the moral law demands that the highest good possible through our agency should be realised).. ,'2 So when Kant wrote his essay on theodicies, he was pulling together what he had begun to indicate in his 'critical' work, and so expressed his acute sense of the presumption and futility of any attempt to calculate the nature of the divine choice of this particular world. This is not the same thing as not sharing the faith of Leibniz, as Kant appeared to see it. Where Kant parts company with Leibniz is in his insistence in his essay of 1791 that attention must be transferred away from a discussion of the divine attributes in relation to the problem of evil, and refocused in an analysis of the experience in which men encounter evil, and how they are to cope with it. He nevertheless produces a theological guarantee for man which can only be described in terms of an optimistic faith, expressed even in his note in the Religion explaining what he meant by the word 'fortunate' : 'An expression of everything wished for, or worthy of being wished for, which we can neither foresee nor bring about through our own endeavours according to the laws of experience; for which, therefore, if we wish to name its source, we can offer none other than a gracious providence'.3 Also, quite clearly, Kant sometimes, as we have seen, confesses to a bewilderment and bafflement in the contemplation of nature, which Leibniz did not share, and herein also lies an important difference. Leibniz could write: 'It is thus that, 1 Ibid., p. ίο. 2 Ibid., p. 5. 3 Ibid. ,p. 98.</page><page sequence="14">374 ANN LOADES being made confident by demonstrations of the goodness and the justice of God, we disregard the appearances of harshness and injustice which we see in this small portion of his kingdom that is exposed to our gaze. Hitherto we have been illumined by the light of Nature and by that of grace, but not yet by that of glory. Here on earth we see apparent injustice, and we believe and even know the truth of the hidden justice of God; but we shall see that justice when at last the Sun of Justice shall show himself as he is.'1 Kant has as many problems in the way in which he has to cope with the interpretation of scripture as has Leibniz, but there is at least one book which he takes entirely seriously which expresses one of his views about nature. One major issue of the book of Job as Kant sees it in his essay on theodicies, is that 'God deigned to disclose the wisdom of his creation to Job on the side of its inscrutableness chiefly. He let him view not only the beautiful side of the creation, where ends comprehensible to man set the wisdom and the beautiful care of the Author of the world in a clear light, but the frightful side, by naming productions of His potency to him and among them even pernicious dreadful things, every one of which seems to be adjusted for itself and its species answerably to the end proposed, but with regard to others and even to men destructive, baffling the end, and not agreeing with a universal plan arranged by goodness and wisdom; whereby He however sheweth the disposition and the preservation of the whole announcing the Wise Author of the world, though at the same time his ways, which are inscrutable to us, must be hidden even in the physical order of things, how much more then must they be so in its connexion with the moral order (which is yet more impenetrable to our reason).'2 Kant cannot disregard 'appearances of harshness and injustice'. Another point arising from a consideration of the passage from Leibniz last quoted is that whilst Kant, despite every problem he describes, cannot tolerate a description of the world as the battleground 1 Leibniz, Theodicy, p. 120. 2 Kant/Richardson, Essays and Treatises ii. 177-8. Despland provides us in his book with the first modern translation of the essay on theodicies, pp. 283-97, but it is obviously not the first translation into English of the essay on theodicies despite what is said on the book-jacket of Despland's work. Apart from the volume produced by William Richardson in 1798, which included this essay, along with many other minor essays of Kant's, another gentleman, John Richardson, published in 1836 a collection of material on Kant which had originally been printed in 1819. This particular collection of material is some what odd in that it includes some work of Kant's, a treatise of John Richardson himself, and a translation of the essay on theodicies. Looking at his latter trans lation, I would guess that he reused William Richardson's work and altered it very slightly.</page><page sequence="15">KANT'S CONCERN WITH THEODICY 375 of two perpetual principles of being, the good and the bad, any more than in terms of analogies such as an inn, a house of correction, a madhouse, or a common sewer,1 there is no consolation offered in terms of the vision of God in The End of All Things of 1794, but only the hope of God's 'concurrence' in man's best efforts.2 So although one may agree with Despland5 that Kant has left optimistic solutions behind, this is not with the implication that he no longer shares the faith of the optimists in the goodness of God. Kant meant to identify himself with the faith of Leibniz, as he identified himself with his philosophy as he chose to interpret it. This incidentally perhaps helps to account for a feature of Kant's writings on history to which Despland draws attention so early in his book,·* when he remarks that 'Kant approached philosophy of history with religious concerns and especially with the problems of theodicy in mind', and that in his writings on history 'we hear of the Nature of the classical metaphysicians.' So Kant's faith in Providence reappeared in the essay of 1795 On Perpetual Peace. Here he deliberately limited theodicy to the context of philosophy of history. In this context alone he could avoid struggling with the 'frightful side' of nature in and by itself, and with the principles of explanation appropriate to scientific inquiry. He had already made it known both as a philosopher and as a theologian, why it was that he could not talk about God's perfections in relation to nature. But he could still write in Perpetual Peace of 'the providential care of nature'5 when writing of 'what nature does for her own ends with regard to the human race as members of the animal world'.6 And he could talk of 'Providence' when he came to talk about justification of the course of the world. So he affirmed (much as he had in 1784) that 'it seems that, by no theodicy or vindication of the Justice of God, can we justify Creation in putting such a race of corrupt creatures into the world at all, if, that is, we assume that the human race neither will nor ever can be in a happier condition than it is now.'7 How that happier condition can come about by the divine action he could not say. So I do not see how this latter essay either could be cited as evidence of Kant's philosophical trans formation occasioned by his discovery of a new concept of evil. What changed as compared with Leibniz in particular, was the context in which he was prepared to use the language of theodicy, though one might say that his concern in his essays on philosophy of history—the ordering of man's moral, social, and political life in a way appropriate to 1 Kant/Richardson, op. cit. ii. 427-31. 2 Ibid. 439. 3 Despland, op. cit., p. 172. 4 Ibid., p. 7. 5 I.

To be able to say this means that it is inappropriate to remark of him that 'on the problem of evil he preferred to look at the reality of it rather than to repeat the doctrines of the philosophes.' Leibniz for one also looked at the reality of the problem, and Kant, in his own way, displayed an optimistic faith in God, if not prepared to offer an optimistic 'solution' in Leibnizian terms.
