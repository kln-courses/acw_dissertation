Margita Gutmane's text "The Very Same Day," in many ways quite unique in Latvian literature and awarded the Janis Jaunsudrabins prose prize while still in manuscript, resists any kind of precise critical assessment. Its texture may look like that of a prose work, but the rhythms, reiterative tonal and syntactic patterns, reprises of images and sounds suggest characteristics of verse. If affinitive resemblances are to be evoked, Beckett's cryptic phraseology, Prevert's oblique density, the surrealist frag- mentation of vision, among others, come to mind. If some- times the afflatus rises to epiphanic levels, it is almost immediately deflated and downgraded to the quotidian and the vulgar. The subject pronoun is quite consistently we, but it is not the collective we proffered to express some unanimity or collective consciousness: "We ponder if it is proper to think and speak in plural, since half of us already a long time ago has become the very same I. ... Thus, each is his own WE [sic], without responsibility, and each I is responsible for everything, i.e. nothing." The narrator often changes identities: sometimes it is a child looking at the world, then the point of view seems to be that of a caged animal, or of an insect trapped in a sink - which all might be extensions of the exile's perspective, immobilized in the expectation of reaching home. The narrative locus is "here": "We know where we are: here! We know where we are not: also here!" There is a kind of temporal progression from morning to night, but the day remains the same: "The same day repeats itself and becomes interchangeable"; "The very same day . . . like an eternal repetition." The world is revealed as being frighten- ing, mysterious, void of anthropomorphic affinities, dichot- omous with its interplays of light and darkness, silence and meaningless sound, offering home and exile, where man is wedged between waiting and the impulse to action. Still, there remains the engagement with words and writing, intriguing and yielding surprises: "We grab into an aleatory string of words and do not know which to wrap around our neck, which will be fitting and adorning." Thus there are "accidents of language," as Beckett once described puns, startling juxtapositions of sound and sense, quotes and deliberate misquotations from various sources - folklore, the Bible, Latvian literary texts, et cetera - strung together in sequences scabrously humorous and delightfully funny. A stilted grammatical disquisition on the behavior of words suggests an erotic scene of copulation of sorts. The text stops on a folksy profanity with no punctuation. Perhaps there is more to come, and we should look forward to the sequel to Td pati diena, which, if nothing else, is surely unique in Latvian literature.
