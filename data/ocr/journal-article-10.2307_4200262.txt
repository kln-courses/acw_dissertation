<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EARLIEST LEVELS AT YARIM TEPE I AND YARIM TEPE II IN NORTHERN IRAQ By N. Ya. MERPERT and R. M. MUNCHAEV In 1973 the journal Iraq published the results of our first three seasons of excavations at the Hassuna settlements of Yarim Tepe I and the Halaf levels of Yarim Tepe II, situated in the Sinjar Plain of Northern Iraq.' Following that publication the Soviet archaeological expedition, under the direction of R. M. Munchaev, continued its extensive studies in the area up to and including 1980. Prior to 1976 its major efforts had been centred on the separate tells of Yarim Tepe I and II, which were excavated over large areas down to virgin soil. This article presents the general results of our studies in the earliest levels of these sites and is a direct continuation of our 1973 article. In parallel with the excavations at Yarim Tepe I and II the Soviet expedition undertook a survey of a considerable part of the Sinjar Plain in the vicinity of Telafar, in the course of which were discovered a number of settlements belonging to various early stages in the development of the agrarian cultures of ancient Meso- potamia. The earliest period (8th-7th millennia bc) is represented by a preceramic fortified settlement, Tell Maghzaliyah, which is situated on the southern slopes of Jebel Sinjar in the vicinity of Telafar. Culturally and chronologically the settlement can be compared with Jarmo and 9ayonu Tepesi. The next phase (late 7th-first half of the 6th millennium bc) is represented by a new and previously unknown culture which has been named after the site of Tell Sotto, first discovered by the expedition. Another settlement representing the same culture and studied by the expedition is Kulli Tepe. This culture preceded the Hassuna and played an important part in the development of the latter. Very similar material, contemporary with Tell Sotto, has been excavated by the British expe- dition at the now well known site of Umm Dabaghiyah 2 in the vicinity of Hatra. These investigations have enabled us to speak now about the earliest, i.e. pre- Hassuna, stage of the development of agriculture in Northern Mesopotamia. One further small tell within the Yarim Tepe group of mounds has also been excavated (Yarim Tepe III). Its upper strata, up to 4 m thick, belong to the North 'Ubaid and Halaf cultures. The results of these studies have been regularly published in various Soviet journals and in Sumer and Iraq.3 A separate volume has appeared as the first in a series of general reports on the excavations at Yarim Tepe I and II.4 ' N.

General Data and Cultural Levels Yarim Tepe I is the easternmost tell within a group of tells of the same name situated by the Wadi Ibra, here known as the Joubara Diariasi (Fig. 1). The original settlement occupied nearly two hectares, but the modern tell is only 100 m in diameter, its surface having been eroded by years of ploughing. The total thickness of its archaeological deposits is over 6 m, 15 m of which lie below present plain level. The modern surface yielded only Hassuna sherds. The expedition has recorded no archaeological strata of any later period, but the upper part of the Hassuna tell is disturbed by numerous pits and burials (over 100) of the Halaf, Old Babylonian, Neo-Babylonian, Hellenistic and Islamic periods. The excavations were concentrated on the eastern part of the tell. The upper levels have been completely excavated over 1,660 m2, and the lower levels down to virgin soil-over an area of 400 M2. In addition, on the southern and northern slopes of the tell a number of stratigraphic trenches have been excavated, totalling 60 M2. For purposes of recording, the work proceeded on a grid of 10 m squares with intermediate sections at intervals of 2-5 m, which greatly enhanced the accuracy of stratigraphic observations. The basic reference unit was "building level". Within the Hassuna occupation twelve such levels were identified and numbered consecutively downwards. Each level corresponds to a comparatively long period of time and contains a number of internal reconstructions without, however, any radical change in the layout of the settlement as a whole. In distinguishing these levels, the evidence from the stratified building remains was combined with that from all categories of finds. The upper levels are greatly disturbed by graves and pits. The remains of the first (uppermost) level are represented solely by unconnected wall segments, while the second level yielded some identifiable rooms, and the third, some odd building complexes whose ruins lay directly over several massive structures, i.e. over the houses and pottery kilns of the fourth level. The main structures in all building levels were directly overlain by the debris of subsequent ones. The settlement's general layout has survived most fully in the fifth level which yielded eleven complexes of over 150 rooms. The structures below these are equally densely situated. In all the levels mentioned so far the centre of the settlement remained invariably unoccupied, the complexes being grouped around an open central square. The Level 7 structures are less frequent, and Levels 8 to 12 have yielded only individual and widely scattered buildings which seem in the beginning to be quite simple but gradually show signs of greater complexity. In the six upper levels the "standard" group of Hassuna ceramics predominates; the seventh level is transitional and here Hassuna pottery is found mixed with an "archaic" painted variety which is plentiful from the twelfth level upwards. In this earliest level it is found together with "coarse" ceramics of Hassuna I a-c type. The five earliest levels correspond to Hassuna I a-c (i.e. to stages A-B, after Mortensen 5). The materials recovered from these levels are discussed below. 5 P. Mortensen, Tell Shimshara.

Ya. MERPERT AND R. M. MUNCHAEV 2. Domestic Structures The earliest signs of human activity are large hollows up to 4-5 m long and 1 0 m deep; these are sunk below the ancient ground surface (depth 6 to 6-20 m). These represent areas where clay was quarried for the construction of the earliest settlement at the site. Some of them, together with "trough-shaped" ovens that were sunk into the ground, appear to have been associated with a temporary camp of builders (Fig. 2, I). All of the seven oval and round hollows discovered were filled with irregular layers of debris that contained great accumulations of ash together with pieces of tempered clay from the temporary ovens and hearths that had probably been destroyed when the area was prepared for construction. The pottery from this and the overlying Level 12 is identical; together with some coarse storage vessels with the characteristic small, flat bases and applied ornament, were found fragments of jars, pots and cups, some painted (with elements reminiscent of Tell Sotto and Umm Dabaghiyah), as well as some fragments of marble vessels. Similar hollows or pits have been found to underlie the earliest structures at other early settlements such as Umm Dabaghiyah, Ganj Dareh, Tell Ramad, Beidha, and their excavators are quite justified in connecting them everywhere with the camps of the first builders at these sites.6 From the earliest levels of the Hassuna culture its house-building tradition appears to have been quite developed. Level 12 (depth 5 7 to 6-2 m) is represented by building complexes 41 (sq. 57), 35 (sq. 47) and 31 (sq. 37) (Fig. 2, II). Its structures are substantial with walls up to 35 cm thick. Both single- and multi- roomed houses occur: complex 41 consisted of four rooms, complex 35 of three, while complex 31 included a minimum of one round and five rectangular-shaped rooms (319). Individual rooms were rectangular and rather small (measuring an average of 2 x 2 m). With these were round structures apparently intended for some ritual purpose (containing burials and some dismembered skeletal remains), grain-drying platforms, open hearths and domed ovens. The various structures stood well apart from each other over the site. All of this, we repeat, points indisputably to the existence of a developed house- building tradition from the earliest level of the Hassuna settlement. From the very beginning we encounter multi-roomed structures with substantial plastered walls. These force us to reconsider the premise according to which the Hassuna house- building tradition started from very primitive single-roomed structures (Hassuna Ib, with no building activity attested in Hassuna Ia).' We can now assert not only that the building tradition was already rather developed at the time, having been in existence since the pre-Hassuna culture of Tell Sotto, but also that the structures were themselves diverse. The residential area (squares 37, 47, 57) is characterized by multi-roomed houses with rectangular rooms. By contrast, no such complexes have been discovered in the northern area excavated (sq. 27); the structures there are small and, together with the rectangular ones, some round buildings of tholos type have been found. The latter are known not to be typical of the Hassuna culture; only one other such building has been found, at Tell Hassuna itself (Level Ic), where it was described as a dwelling. By contrast, the round structures from the lowest level of 6J. Mellaart, The Neolithic of the Near East (London, 1976), 135ff. I S. Lloyd and F.

Ya. MERPERT AND R. M. MUNCHAEV Yarim Tepe I cannot be classed as dwellings either by their size, form or contents. It is premature as yet to evaluate finally their function or significance, but they are undoubtedly connected with burial practices. In tholoi 319 and 333 burials were found both inside the structures and under their floors. The finds from the tholoi are also very specific (skeletal remains of sacrificial animals, necklaces deliberately deposited, stone vessels and the like). The other burials of Level 12 are characteristi- cally concentrated in the same northern section. Level 11 (depth 5-3 to 5-8 m) includes complexes 40 (sq. 57), 34 (sq. 47), 30 (sq. 37) (Fig. 3, II). The structures are complex with many rooms (up to seven) measuring up to 12 m2, the massive walls coated with plaster. The building complexes were well spaced out. Here, too, some structures, both round and rectangular, were found to contain dismembered skeletons, one of which lay on a gypsum plastered platform (room 282). No substantial dwellings were discovered on the northern periphery (sq. 27). Numerous reconstructions and completely new buildings constitute Level 10 (depth 5 00 to 5 30 m) (Fig. 3, I). The greatest concentration of structures was recorded in the southern part of the site. Now the buildings become more complicated in design. Complex 36 (sq. 57) consisted of seven rooms and two big rectangular ovens, complex 33 (sq. 47) of eight rooms and several ovens, while complex 27 included a grain-drying platform with a system of parallel walls and a number of ancillary structures. The northern periphery remained unoccupied. Structures in Level 9 (depth 4 70 to 5 10 m) are even more densely distributed than before, and its complexes are more complicated in design (Fig. 4, I). The southern part of the area (sq. 57, 47) is entirely occupied by building complex 32, which comprises nine rooms, three grain-drying platforms and an open yard with at least three ovens; complex 28 (sq. 47) is enclosed with long walls and consists of four rooms and an open yard with two ovens; in sq. 37 is a domestic complex (26) with a grain-drying platform similar to and overlying that in the previous level (10). Level 8 is distinguished by considerable reconstruction and a new general layout (Fig. 4, II). Densely-set buildings now occupy the entire southern periphery of the site. Sq. 57 contains the remains of multi-roomed complex 29 (with no less than 10 rooms); sq. 47 is occupied by the remains of complex 19 (two rooms) and a number of big ovens and round structures, and sq. 37, by the remains of complex 23. For the first time this level has produced a monumental structure (complex 25, sq. 27) in an area which had previously yielded a concentration of burials and ritual structures. These were now replaced by a massive single-roomed structure (234) which served as the "nucleus" for complex 25 with its several open yards. The structure measured 4.14 x 3-32 m, and its double walls were strengthened with buttresses. Inside the structure were flint tools and cores, marble palettes, mortars, some accumulations of ochre, and under the floor an infant's burial, horns of oxen and goats deliber- ately buried, and a painted jar. Level 7 (depth 3-6 to 4-4 m) is the latest with sparsely set houses in marked contrast to the extremely dense patterning of buildings in the sixth and later levels.8 No continuous development of large plots has been recorded in Level 7. There are, 8 Merpert and Munchaev, Iraq 35, 97 if., Pls. XXXVII-XXXVIII.</page><page sequence="7">YARIM TEPE I AND YARIM TEPE II IN NORTHERN IRAQ 7 rather, compact building complexes well separated from each other. Such complexes occur in both the northern and southern peripheries. The southern complex of houses 13-14 is separated from residential complex 17 by a wide square with sparsely set ovens and round structures. Complexes 17 and 22 were separated by a passage over 2 m wide, and complexes 22 and 24 by wide open yards. Complex 17 is of particular interest. In its complete form it was a house with eight rooms, 11 m long and 6 m wide at the maximum. The house was not regular in form; six of its rooms ran west to east in two rows, forming a rectangle, while the two others were situated at right angles to the main structure, one eastwards and the other to the south. The structure underwent several reconstructions: originally it had five rooms with an oven in the yard; later the oven was destroyed and overlain with a large platform which served to reinforce the structure from the south and east, the enclosing walls were doubled, their thickness now reaching up to 50 cm, the central room was divided in two, and two new rooms were added, one of which was later filled up with earth and made into a kind of buttress that reinforced the structure from the east. Some jars were found buried under the walls and floors of the house, and in its central room, the remains of two dismembered human skeletons, a fact which suggests that the building had some special purpose. 3. Character and Building Techniques of Hassuna Structures From the very beginning the building remains found in the Hassuna strata of Yarim Tepe I indicate that the tradition of multi-roomed structures (Plates I-III) was well-developed at the time and that its roots should be sought in earlier cultures (in the case of the Sinjar area, in the cultures of Tell Maghzaliyah and Tell Sotto). In the earliest level (12) all the complexes (31, 35, 41) consisted of several rooms and provided evidence of well-developed building techniques. It has been established that prior to building, the occupants of the site levelled an appropriate stretch of land, filling all its cavities and hollows with earth or fill derived from earlier building remains. Mats and layers of reed were used for the wall beddings, or foundations were constructed of large pottery fragments (the latter technique was common in the construction of substructures for floors, thresholds and, especially, ovens). On their exteriors, facing the slope of the tell, structures were reinforced with massive clay platforms, often with enclosing walls and rubble filling. Similar platforms were also built for such special structures as granaries and grain-drying platforms (such a platform was also found in the third level at Tell Hassuna 9). The walls are substantial with an average thickness of 30-35 cm, widening at the bottom to 50-60 cm. In some cases the outer walls were constructed double. Some walls are more than 10 m long. The technique of construction is well-developed and is for the most part identical throughout all levels. All the walls are made of clay lumps, either massive blocks or comparatively thin slabs bound together with clay mortar. The clay contained chopped straw or twigs, and some gypsum to cement the individual blocks. As is common in pise technique, the blocks were not pre-dried before use. The blocks and slabs were not of uniform size, but in a few instances some standardization of form and size is observable, a feature which increases over time. 9 Lloyd and Safar, op. cit. in n. 7, 272.</page><page sequence="8">8 N. Ya. MERPERT AND R. M. MUNCHAEV Thus, for example, in Level 12 the walls of room 382 are made of yellow clay slabs 50 x 24 x 5 cm; in Level 11 the outer walls of room 381 are made of slabs measuring 40 x 30 x 5, while the slabs on the inner sides are considerably smaller, measuring 18 x 17 x 6. In Level 10 the grain-drying platform is made of rectan- gular slabs of different sizes (23-25 x 20 x 3-4 cm). By contrast, Level 9 has yielded a wall made of blocks that were of standard rectangular form and uniform size (35 x 25 x 6). Unusually narrow and long oval blocks of red clay were found among the remains of a large round structure (?oven) in Level 9. These approached 50 cm in length and 7 cm in breadth and height. The double walls of room 234, Level 8, consisted of different components. The internal ones were made of common brown clay slabs, measuring 35 x 25 x 5 cm, while the outer walls were especially thick, consisting of grey-green blocks of clay, 80 x 35 x 40. From Level 12 onwards the walls were plastered on both sides, the plaster being up to 1 5 cm thick. Such plastering has been recorded on the walls of all three original complexes (31, 35, 41). The "buttresses", which were later to play such an important part in Sumerian architecture, are a very early architectural feature at Yarim Tepe I. A long wall, which crossed square 57 and was connected with complex 40 of Level II, was reinforced on its western side with large buttresses which projected 30-50 cm from the wall's surface. In all subsequent levels such buttresses become an almost obligatory element of their buildings. As we have already noted, the floors sometimes had special foundations made of potsherds or small stones which were covered with reed flooring and then plastered with clay that contained an admixture of chopped straw and gypsum, the presence of the latter in the plaster being sometimes considerable. In some instances there were platforms strengthened with numerous posts and intended, probably, for grain storage; in both Levels 11 (sq. 47) and 8 (room 272 of complex 29) these were associated with large stone mortars. It should be pointed out that gypsum plaster has been recorded not only in the floors of houses but also on the surfaces of the passages or "lanes" between them. The roofs of the houses had a three-layered structure consisting of matting, clay and gypsum, a common feature in the area to this day. Such a roof was supported by wooden poles which rested, in turn, on the walls and a ridge beam. Few rooms had doorways: presumably they were accessible from the roof, while auxiliary structures had low walls. Primitive hearths and sophisticated ovens coexist from the twelfth level. The ovens are round or rectangular in plan, with openings on the side or on the top. In Level 10 and later, two-storeyed pottery kilns with a system of holes connecting the fire chamber with the baking chamber were encountered. From the earliest stages of its development the settlement displays a characteristically Hassuna complex: a baking oven, a "husking tray", a platform for drying grain, and a grain grinder or mortar. 4. Burials (Plate IV) The lower levels have yielded over 20 burials. These are mostly infants (17) found under the walls and corners of houses or beneath their floors, thresholds, hearths, and sometimes in large vessels or under large potsherds. The skeletons lie contracted on the right or left side or, but only occasionally, on the back. The orientation of the skeletons varies. Occasionally the remains of the dead are accompanied by archaic clay vessels and animal bones (sheep, goats, horns of oxen). With the single</page><page sequence="9">YARIM TEPE I AND YARIM TEPE II IN NORTHERN IRAQ 9 exception of contracted burial 126 (in a narrow, oval pit sunk from Level I 1), which belongs to a female under 25 years, the remains of adult persons provide evidence of some very unusual ritual practices (e.g., dismembered corpses found in special round or rectangular structures). In Level 12, inside tholos 333 (diameter 2-5 m) there were found miscellaneous bones of two or three adults accompanied by sheep bones and fragments of not less than four vessels (burial 131). In Level 11 burial 105 was found inside rectangular room 282. The floor measured 1-35 x 1U05 m, and its walls and floor were gypsum plastered; the floor was traversed by a trough 50 cm wide, within and by the sides of which lay bones of two feet in anatomical order, the head of a femur and some fragments of other bones of an adult person. Similarly, room 346 (1 70 x 1 25 m) of the same building complex (30) yielded dismembered remains of another adult person: arranged in anatomical order were bones of part of the spine, thorax and limbs and the skull. In Level 7 two dismembered skeletons were found inside the central room of complex 17. The discoveries at Yarim Tepe I show that intramural burials are present in all levels and that they were associated with specific burial ritual. These are mainly infant burials and for the most part those of children under one year of age (over 10 examples); two burials belonged to children one and a half and three years old; two others, to children aged four and six, and two more, to children of ten to twelve years. The tradition of burying children inside the settlement was very consistent and has also been recorded at pre-Hassuna sites: from the earliest levels of Umm Dabaghiyah and Tell Sotto 10 infant burials were frequently found under the floors and walls of the houses, under hearths and inside large vessels. Later, during the Hassuna"I and post-Hassuna periods this tradition became widespread among a number of early agrarian cultures both in the Near East and Southeastern, Eastern and Central Europe. Everywhere the predominant type of burial ritual was inhumation, with the dead lying on the right or left side or, rarely, on the back. Accompanying grave goods and sacrificial food are encountered, but only occasionally. As for the bones of adults from the lower levels of Yarim Tepe I, all are extraordinary and all are related to some unusual ritual. The small number of such burials does not allow us to categorize them as customary: in an area of 400 m2 in the lowest six levels remains of some ten or more dismembered skeletons have been discovered. In this connection it should be noted that dismemberment rituals are an extremely ancient tradition in the Near East.'2 However, the question of the usual method of Hassuna burial must remain open, though we can postulate with a high degree of probability that there were extramural necropoli,'3 similar to those of the Halaf culture which we know to have existed together with unusual and individual intramural burials.'4 '0 See n. 2 and Bader in Sovetskaya arkheologiya 4 (1975).

Pottery (Figs. 5-8) At Yarim Tepe I all the previously known groups of Hassuna ceramics are represented, i.e. coarse, archaic painted, standard painted, incised, and painted- and-incised. A considerable amount of archaic painted pottery appears in Level 12 and coexists with the coarse ceramics, the two constituting a single Early Hassuna ceramic complex. Level 7 is transitional between the "archaic" and the "standard" wares. Some of the forms are extremely conservative and persist throughout all levels. Among them are thick-walled oval basins, including those with ribbed bases, open cups, and hemispherical or spherical jars with pointed rims and cylindrical necks. The occurrence of large storage jars with pointed rims, abruptly carinated bodies, and small flat bases is more limited; they and some specific forms of cups and jars are found in the lower levels only. The classification of the pottery from Yarim Tepe I is based on shape, while technological differences within each group were noted separately. Five basic kinds of vessels have been distinguished, each with several distinct types. Type L Large storage vessels, represented by three varieties: (1) large jars with a wide, low neck, an abruptly flaring bell-shaped body with a sharp carination, concave lower sides, and a flat base. (2) medium-sized vessels with a low, broad neck, rounded body and flat base. (3) medium-sized vessels with a high cylindrical neck, and body similar to 1 (Fig. 5, a). All these vessels are coarse. The clay has an admixture of chopped straw. Ornamentation is rare and is represented exclusively by simple applied decoration (Fig. 5, b). Such vessels are found for the most part in Levels 12 to 10, with some isolated examples up to Level 7. Type II. Jars, represented by four varieties: (1) wide-necked, with a rounded slightly flared rim, low cylindrical neck, a spherical and somewhat flattened body, and a wide flat base. (2) jars with tall, slightly everted necks, oval bodies, and small flat bases. (3) jars with a flared neck, a spherical body, and a rounded or pointed base. (4) jars with a minimal neck, rounded rim and body, and a flat or rounded base (Fig. 5, c). These vessels are both coarse and dark, or thin with a light slip. The ornamentation is dominated by the archaic painting techniques (eight variations); applied decoration has been recorded on five large jars from Levels 12 to 10, and incising on one vessel from Level 8 (Fig. 5, d). These vessels are common in all the early levels: variety 1 predominates in Levels 12 to 10, varieties 2 and 3 in Levels 10 to 8, and variety 4 is typical of all six of the early levels. Type III. Open, flat-based cups or bowls, represented by six varieties, among all of which there are coarse and fine examples. (1) with straight or sharply everted, slanting sides and a rounded or pointed rim. (2) rounded sides and a tapering rim. (3) sharp carination and straight pointed rim. (4) rounded sides, sharp concave rim. (5) rounded sides, slightly flared rim. (6) straight walls and a flattened everted rim (Fig. 6, a). The archaic painting makes use of eleven patterns (Fig. 6 b). From Levels 12 to 7 geometrical compositions gradually grow more complex. Predominant in the lower levels are cups or bowls with a straight rim, and in the upper ones, with the concave variety. Type IV. Tall coarse and fine pots with rounded or straight sides, represented by five varieties which range from those with a very distinctive profile to simple cylindrical ones. (1) medium-sized pots with rounded sides, a sharply thinning rim and a wide</page><page sequence="11">YARIM TEPE I AND YARIM TEPE II IN NORTHERN IRAQ 1 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 M_X-L.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Fig. 5 Yarim Tepe I.

(4) tall pots of medium size with concave walls and flared rim. (5) simple cups of small and medium size (Fig. 7, a). There are 18 variations in the painted designs, which become more complex on the cups and bowls (Fig. 7, b). There are seven examples of applied ornament, all from Levels 12 to 1 1, and two examples of incised decoration in Levels 9 to 8. Incised decoration becomes common in Level 7, where the standard painted and painted-and-incised types also appear (Fig. 7, b).</page><page sequence="12">12 N. Ya. MERPERT AND R. M.

The first variety is common in all the early levels. The second is divided into two sub-types: the first, with a cellular pattern in the base, prevails in Levels 12 to 10, and the second, with "ribbing", in all subsequent levels. "Husking trays" are, of course, known also from Tell Sotto and Umm Dabaghiyah.'5 1' Bader in Sovetskaya arkheologiya 4 (1975), 107; Kirk- bride in Iraq 34 (1972), 9, Pls. XII, XV; 35 (1973), 5, Pls.

Flint constitutes 77 and obsidian 23% of the finds. The obsidian originates from some East Anatolian source or sources, and an overwhelming majority of the pieces of obsidian are finished tools. The majority of flint objects are cores, blades, flakes and debitage. The variety of tools is extremely limited. Among the flint artefacts it is possible to distinguish end- scrapers on rectangular or oval flakes and blades, and side-scrapers on oval flakes, all with a retouched edge;"7 also borers on flakes and blades, large knives on blades (only in the lowest levels), and sickle blades. Standardized sickle blades, including those with a denticulated working edge, are found for the most part in the later levels of the settlement, a fact which corresponds well with the data from Choga Mami where the proportion of sickle blades increases from 25.4% in the Early Samarra phase to 44 2% in the so-called Late Samarra. Arrowheads (four) have been found only in Level 12, all on blades. Three are stemmed and leaf-shaped, the fourth is shaped like an elongated rhomboid. Obsidian occurs as blades, both very large knives for dressing animal carcasses (established by trace analysis) and, commonly, sickle blades and scrapers. Although the blade tools from Yarim Tepe I represent a widespread ancient tradition, they find their closest analogies and indeed their ancestral forms not in Jarmo or other Zagros sites but above all in the corresponding complexes of the lower levels of Tell Sotto and Umm Dabaghiyah.18 The same is true of the arrowheads, of which the earliest examples are to be seen in a series from Tell Maghzaliyah.19 Levels 12 to 10 have yielded seven wedge-shaped stone axes (Fig. 9). Two maceheads have been found: a coarse basalt example in Level 12, and a polished, pear-shaped one of marble in Level 8. Grinding and pounding tools are represented by numerous mortars, flat and saddle-shaped querns, as well as by handstones and pestles of different types. Only two hoes have been found, one with a hole for a handle. In the lower levels we have found fragments of ten polished marble or alabaster bowls and jars, and seven palettes. The variety of bone artefacts is limited, mostly awls made of the leg bones of small herbivorous animals. There are also needles, spatulas and polishers. In Level 10 an ox shoulder blade with a system of incisions on it was found, possibly indicating some form of reckoning. 7. Other finds (Plate V) In the lower levels of Yarim Tepe I the excavations have revealed 27 conical and biconical spindle whorls made of clay, alabaster, marble and gypsum. Sling bullets of clay, numerous in the upper levels, are rare in the lower ones. There are many beads of different stones (marble, serpentine, limestone, azurite, carnelian, chalce- dony, alabaster, turquoise, rock crystal) as well as of obsidian, bone and shell. Fourteen types have been distinguished among them: rhombic flat, oval flat, cylindrical, barrel-shaped, tubular, spindle- and ring-shaped, spherical, triangular flat, trapezoid, rectangular flat, parallelepiped, as well as three- and two-component " Types Al, A4 and A5 after P.

The most colourful and varied necklaces come from the lower levels. For example, Level 9 has yielded a necklace of 15 turquoise beads (nine cylindrical and five tripartite ones); Level 10, a necklace of 10 disc-shaped carnelian beads; and lastly, and most interesting, from Level 12, a necklace of 15 beads of different sizes, colours (grey, green, yellow, cherry, red, blue, etc.) and materials (including rock crystal, shell), found in the centre of the round ritual structure 319 (Plate Va). This necklace is the most striking and interesting so far found in Hassuna levels at any site. The only fragment of a polished stone bracelet comes from Level 9. Stone pendants are rare: four examples in simple oval shapes. Stone seal-pendants (Plate Vb) are of particular interest. Seven were found in Yarim Tepe I, of two types; round ones are characteristic of the upper levels, and rectangular specimens, of the lower ones. The five rectangular examples come from Levels 11 to 9; they are made of quartzite and are of uniform shape, with a cross-hatched pattern on the obverse and an eye for suspension on the reverse. A particularly important item was metal, encountered 26 times in the settlement as a whole, with 21 examples coming from the lower levels discussed here; 17 pieces of copper ore (two from Level 7, four from Level 8, three from Level 10, arid four from Level 12), which suggest the smelting of metal in the settlement itself, and four copper artefacts: a copper sheet bead (Level 7), a copper ring (Level 10), a ring- shaped pendant made of a copper plait (Level I 1) and, perhaps most important, a lead bracelet (Level 12, Plate Vb). The latter lay on virgin soil under the corner of room 345, the earliest in the central section of the excavations. It seems to have been buried there as a sacrifice when construction began. The bracelet is 9 2-10 cm in diameter, and is made of a lead rod 7-8 mm thick. The ends are bud-shaped and thickened.20 Copper artefacts have also been found both in pre-Hassuna Tell Sotto 2 and, even earlier, in the preceramic settlement of Tell Maghzaliyah. 8. The Lower Levels of Yarim Tepe I: preliminary conclusions The cultural levels of the Yarim Tepe I settlement reflect the entire period of Hassuna development, recorded first at the eponymous site. Like the latter, but in contrast to Tell Sotto and Umm Dabaghiyah, the Yarim Tepe I Hassuna settlement was founded on a previously unoccupied area. The final phase in the life of the settlement is marked by the spread of Samarra pottery which precedes the foundation of the Halaf settlement at Yarim Tepe II, and probably the appearance of Halaf generally in the area. Two pieces of evidence support this. First, the seven metre thick Halaf deposits at Yarim Tepe II lie immediately over the ruins of a small Hassuna settlement containing both early and late phase materials. Second, the necropolis of the Halaf settlement is situated on the mound of Yarim Tepe I, at that time clearly an abandoned tell. In a number of respects the earliest building level of Yarim Tepe I can be compared with Hassuna Ia. At the same time, its genetic connection with the earlier Tell Sotto culture is unquestionable. For example, relief ornament on pottery vessels, a well developed tradition at Sotto, continues at Yarim Tepe I, but only in a few relatively simple forms. Specific types of complex curvilinear painted ornament 20 Munchaev and Merpert, op. cit. in n. 4, 309. 21 Munchaev and Bader in Vestnik Akademii Nauk SSSR 2 (1979), 110.</page><page sequence="18">18 N. Ya. MERPERT AND R. M. MUNCHAEV disappear completely, to be replaced by the standard Hassuna repertoire, character- ized by simple geometric patterns, in the early levels dominated by simple wide painted bands and thickly painted rectangular patterns. The latter painted style begins in Level 12, and is represented by traits present in both Hassuna Ia-c and Levels 12 to 8 at Yarim Tepe I. The incised ornament which appears in Level 10 has also been recorded in Hassuna lb. Similar parallels can be observed among other categories of finds, for example the large blades of flint and obsidian, the flint stemmed arrowheads, and the stone axes. The evidence from Yarim Tepe I necessitates a radical reassessment of the thesis that the house-building farmers of Hassuna Ib had been preceded by hunters and cattle-breeders, occupying a temporary campsite, and unrelated to their successors in later levels.22 We must emphasize again in this connection that in all the lower levels at Yarim Tepe I the centre of the settlement invariably remained free of structures. It thus seems likely that the settlement plan was the same. N. 0. Bader was correct in writing that "large multi-roomed houses, which are so typical of Tell Sotto and Umm Dabaghiyah, have been found now in the lower levels of Yarim Tepe I; they must also be present in the lower level of Tell Hassuna".23 From its very beginning the settlement of Yarim Tepe I provides evidence of basic architecture. Here the traditions known at Tell Sotto and comparable earlier sites continued to develop. The same can be said of other forms of material culture and, especially, of the very typical early Hassuna large coarse pottery vessels. We consider Tell Sotto and Hassuna to be two very closely related but independent cultures, i.e. two consecutive stages in the development of early agrarian societies in Northern Mesopotamia. The role of the Sotto culture as the most important formative element in that of Hassuna is indisputable.24 Today, the statement by J. Mellaart that the traits connecting these cultures are outweighed by their differences and that "The origin of the Hassuna culture is by no means clear" 25 cannot be sustained. All the research of the Soviet expedition supports the view that the Hassuna culture developed in Northern Iraq. The earliest agricultural tradition is represented here as early as Tell Maghzaliyah, which appears to belong to the PPNB phase, and is without doubt by no means the only such site on the margins of the plain. The studies of G. N. Lisitsina have established that the palaeobotanical collection from this settlement contains some 100 fragmen- ted and complete grains and seeds of domesticated and wild plants, including domesticated wheat (Triticum sp., Triticum monococcum L., Triticum dicoccum Schrank, Triticum compactum Host., Triticum spelta L.), barley (Hordeum sp., Hordeum distichum L., Hordeum vulgare var. nudum), and flax (Linum usitatissimum L.). The domesticated cereal grains are small and appear to represent early forms. Sickles and reaping knives further attest the presence of early farmers at Maghzaliyah. At Tell Sotto and Umm Dabaghiyah there occurs a greater variety both of domesticated cereals and of agricultural tools. Settlements of this phase spread south into the Jazirah, apprently occupying for the first time extensive areas of the very fertile farming lands of Mesopotamia. At the same time there appear standardized 22 Lloyd and Safar, op. cit. in n. 7, 262, 271. 23 Bader in Sovetskaya arkheologiya 4 (1975), 107. 24 Ibid., 107, 108. 25 Mellaart, op. cit. in n. 6, 149.</page><page sequence="19">YARIM TEPE I AND YARIM TEPE II IN NORTHERN IRAQ 19 forms of house-building and standardized ancillary structures, in particular for grain drying and storage, and standardized agricultural tools and pottery, including the very characteristic "husking tray". All of these traditions continue directly into the Hassuna phase, as exemplified in the lowest levels of Yarim Tepe I. At the latter site cereals have been found in all levels. Of particular note is a jar of grain which was found in burial 131 in tholos 333; indeed altogether G. N. Lisitsina has examined more than 30 deposits of grain and seeds from Level 12, for the most part deriving from its various ashpits. These deposits contained examples of Triticum monococcum L., Triticum diococcum Schrank, Triticum aestivum L., Triticum compactum Host., Triticum spelta L., Hordeum vulgare var. nudum, Lens sp., Lens esculenta L., Pisum sp., wild species from the Graminae family and Leguminosae.26 From the beginning of the settlement the major cereals are represented here in a fully domesticated form and in a much greater variety than in preceding periods. The faunal material from Yarim Tepe I is now being studied by V. I. Bibikova. The collection differs markedly from that of Umm Dabaghiyah. At Yarim Tepe the numbers of wild animals and their importance to the economy is far less than at the former site. Bones of domestic animals account for more than 82% of the collection (at Umm Dabaghiyah the respective figure was only 10%). Represented in the collection are Bos taurus, Ovis aries, Capra hircus, Sus domestica and Sus scrofa, Canis familiaris, Dama mesopotamica, Ovis orientalis, Capra aegagrus, Gazella subgutturosa, Asinus onager, Pantera pardus and Canis aureus; domestic cattle are of especial importance. The different kinds of stone, including turquoise, rock crystal and obsidian, together with the sea shells, copper and lead found in the lower levels of Yarim Tepe I supply evidence of extensive trading contacts with Anatolia, the Mediterranean coast, Arabia and other areas of Iraq. Our first publication in Iraq has already touched on the question of chronology." The evidence presented here shows clearly that the lowest level of Yarim Tepe I follows directly after the period of Tell Sotto and Umm Dabaghiyah which, in turn, follows directly on cultures of the type ofJarmo and Maghzaliyah and preserves, in its earliest stages, some evidence of continuity with the latter.28 The only radio- carbon determination for the final stage of the Tell Sotto culture has been obtained for Level 15 of Telul eth-Thalathat (TK-23, 5570 + 120 bc).29 The beginnings of Hassuna are not far removed in time from the earliest Samarran levels at sites like Matarrah and Tell es-Sawwan. In the Deh Luran plain there are a number of features reminiscent of Hassuna in the Sefid and Surkh phases, which are intermedi- ate between Mohammad Jaffar and the Transitional stage of Choga Mami.&gt;? The lower levels of Yarim Tepe I appear to be contemporary with the Sefid phase in Deh Luran and the two lower levels of Tell es-Sawwan (which precede the appearance of 26 G. N.

Its known borders are marked by Tell Turlu and Yunus (Carchemish) in the west, Banahilk in the east, Tilki Tepe, Girikihajiyan and others in the north, and Tell es-Sawwan, Songor B and Choga Mami in the south. Halaf influence is recorded as far as Palestine to the west and the Transcaucasus to the east. The most characteristic traits of this culture can be seen in its architecture and ceramics. Although some data have been obtained concerning its relative and absolute chronology, a number of important problems remain unsolved. In parti- cular these relate to its origins and the relationships between major groups of sites, its periodization, and above all, its earliest phases. In this respect, the evidence from Yarim Tepe II, where the entire seven metre thick deposits belong to the Halaf culture, is of great importance. Yarim Tepe II is situated on the western bank of the Wadi Joubara Diariasi, which has washed away over half of the original mound of which the diameter must have exceeded 120 m. Excavation was begun in the centre of the surviving tell over an area of 600 m2, while the lowest levels were exposed over an area of 500 mi2. Nine building levels have been identified. The two latest are greatly disturbed by graves and pits of Assyrian and Hellenistic date. In the southeastern part of the tell, remnants of a small Hassuna settlement have been found, underlying the earliest Halaf level (about 200 fragments of typically Hassuna pottery were found here). In all the Yarim Tepe II levels the main form of house architecture was a single- room, domed tholos, 3-5 m in diameter; rarely, there is evidence of a flat roof. A considerable number of small tholoi were excavated, d. 1 5 to 2-0 m, which served some domestic purpose. Rectangular structures occur, but only one, in Level 5, can be regarded as a dwelling (a single room house, measuring 4-4 x 2 2 m); the others, sometimes divided by transverse partitions into smaller compartments, must have served some other purpose. From the earliest level (9) all the structures were made of clay slabs of varying lengths and breadths, averaging 5-6 cm thick. However, mud-brick was also known to the inhabitants of the settlement, though they used it only rarely. In section 23-b of Level 5 a part of a wall of a rectangular structure was built of rectangular bricks (23-25 x 14 x 7-9), mortared with grey loam. 3' Editor's note: The Telul eth Thalathat date is very late by comparison with comparable material at Bou- qras, and the Mesopotamian dates generally are very late in comparison with Khuzistan.</page><page sequence="21">YARIM TEPE I AND YARIM TEPE II IN NORTHERN IRAQ 21 Of considerable interest are the ruins of a large building complex of cruciform shape uncovered in squares 18-19 at a depth of 3-80 to 4 85 m (Level 6). In the centre of this unique building was a round structure (tholos XXXI) with massive walls 60-70 cm thick, inner diameter 2-60 m. The tholos was divided into two parts, of which the southern was the smaller. The northern portion was further subdivided by two transverse walls into three compartments (0.5 x 1P0, 15 x 0 7, and 1P4 x 0-65 m). On the inside of the central compartment there have survived two flat alabaster slabs, and it seems probable that the upper part of the inner walls of the tholos was also finished with similar stone slabs. On its northern and southern sides the tholos was directly adjoined by rectangular structures; on the eastern and western sides, there was a corridor (0.5-0.9 m wide) between the tholos and its ancillary rooms. The tholos was further enclosed by rectangular multi-roomed structures, comprising some 22 rooms in all. What is the purpose of this structure? Undoubtedly, it is not a living complex. This is indicated not only by the very small size of the rooms but also by the lack of pottery and other domestic debris. Nonetheless, we do not believe that it was a "ritual" structure. Its most likely purpose would seem to have been a large public storehouse, standing in the very centre of the settlement. It is important to stress that this complex was built on a site previously occupied by ordinary structures and that after its destruction, it was built over once again with ordinary buildings. All the lower and middle levels of Yarim Tepe II yielded a considerable number of hearths and ovens. These were for the most part circular and oval bread ovens (tanour type) and, occasionally, large pottery kilns. 1. The Earliest Level of rarim Tepe II It is of particular importance to note the buildings and objects which were discovered in this earliest level and therefore characterize this original stage of the Halaf settlement (Fig. 10). Our description will begin in the southern section. Here, at a depth of 6-65 to 6-80 m, sq. 29, the remains of three narrow, rectangular, multi- roomed structures were discovered, running along the north-south axis (355, 358, 365, Fig. 10). The walls (25-35 cm wide) were made of clay slabs (5-10 cm thick), coated with a layer of mud plaster (in one case it was possible to determine the exact dimensions of the slabs: 85-87 x 22-24 x 8-10 cm). All three structures were built at the same time; their foundations rest on virgin soil at a depth of 6-76 to 6 80 m. They were probably granaries, but they did not function long and were destroyed during the time of this same earliest level. To the north, and contemporary with these structures, there was a further rectangular structure, of which only the transverse and some parts of the longitudinal walls have survived (Fig. 10, 307). Ruins of a clay oven (308, length 1 m), consisting of a combustion chamber and an ash pit, were found nearby, together with the remains of a further oven, sunk into the virgin soil. To the west of this industrial area there stood several dwellings, including the remains of six houses of tholos type. Four were excavated almost completely (LXI, LXVII, LXXI, and LXXIII). Their walls, which survive in places to a height of a metre, were made of blocks of clay with an admixture of gypsum, coated with mud plaster. Southwest of tholos LXXI there stood another, only partially excavated</page><page sequence="22">22 N. Ya. MERPERT AND R. M.

(LXXV), with a round clay oven in its centre. Tholos LXI contained two ovens, the southern of tanour type, the northern, apparently a hearth; the tholos itself had a flat roof. Tholos LXVII, the largest in this level (Plate VIb), some 5-3 m in diameter, was reinforced on its eastern side by additional walls, inside and out. The walls of this tholos rested on a specially prepared clay platform. Beneath the floor plaster was a small depression containing fragments of an intentionally broken painted vessel with a corrugated surface (Fig. 11, 7) and three microlithic obsidian tools (Fig.</page><page sequence="23">YARIM TEPE I AND YARIM TEPE II IN NORTHERN IRAQ 23 11, 1, 2), covered with the ash of a fire. In addition, animal bones, fragments of vessels, five clay and two stone spindle whorls, a pendant of grey stone with circular ornament (Fig. 11, 6), a pierced flat stone pendant (Fig. 11, 5), a fragment of a clay figurine (Fig, 11, 4) and a unique, triangular, copper seal-pendant (Fig. 11, 3) were found under the floor just north of the depression. It seems possible that all these items were placed under the foundations when the house was built, and that they have some ritual significance. The remains of two structures unearthed in the southern corner of the excavations belong to the earliest period of the settlement. They are a rectangular structure and a potter's kiln. They were built at the same time, and earlier than tholoi LXVII and LXXV. (Tholoi LXI and LXVI were later still.) Only the inner platform of the kiln (d. 1 85 to 1s98 m), with six flues some 15 cm in diameter, and the lower part of the fire chamber have survived. In the centre of the platform was a larger hole (d. 35 to 40 cm) (cf. Sumer 37 (1981), p. 32 Figs. I and II); the fire chamber was connected to the upper kiln oven not only by the six smaller channels, up to one metre deep, but by the larger central hole as well. The entrance to the kiln, on the south, was oval (40 x 40 x 18 cm).32 No dwellings were found in sq. 19, only the remains of a few ovens and pits like those found elsewhere at this level. Some of these pits were quarries for clay, but a few, such as 60 and 61 (Fig. 10) were intentional constructions. These were sunk some 2 7 m into virgin soil and appear to have been pit-wells for water storage. Thus, we can see that the territory of Yarim Tepe II was densely built upon from its inception. Indeed such dense construction was characteristic of the settlement throughout its existence. To summarize, from the earliest period of the settlement its inhabitants built not only houses of a specific architectural form but also various structures for other domestic purposes such as grain-drying and storage, kilns for baking pottery and wells. Moreover, all the structures in the southern half of the excavated area were sited parallel to the north-south line. On the whole, the same pattern of planning and orientation of buildings is observable also in the later stages of the settlement's life. During the period of Halaf development in the Sinjar plain the traditional Mesopotamian techniques of construction remained the same as those in use at Yarim Tepe I. Apart from the common yellowish-brown clay, grey-green loam was widely used; this is found in almost every area of North Mesopotamia. This loam has important properties such as good resistance to moisture and quick drying after rain, properties which were, probably, identified from the very earliest stages of settlement here. In the earliest level of Yarim Tepe II almost all of the structures are built of clay slabs. Such a technique is typical for settlements of the Halaf culture as a whole as well as for those of the preceding (Hassuna) and subsequent (Ubaid) cultures. The width of the slabs depended on the thickness of the walls, their thickness varied from 6-12 cm, with the length sometimes reaching 1 m. For instance, the walls of an auxiliary structure found in the sections of sq. 29 were made of slabs of clay measuring 85-87 x 20-22 x 8-10 cm. From the earliest level the houses of Yarim 32 The remains of the kiln have been transferred to the Mosul National Museum and are exhibited there.</page><page sequence="24">24 N. Ya. MERPERT AND R.

They were single-room round structures with flat or dome-shaped roofs. The largest among them is tholos LXVII with a diameter of 5.3 m. It has been established that the construction of the tholos had been preceded by a ritual ceremony. The question arises, whether or not this large building was a cult structure, since the tradition of burying ritual objects under public buildings is well known in later Mesopotamian tradition. Thus, in the earliest period of the Halaf settlement a round single-room house was the basic form of dwelling. However, in the earliest level no tholoi were connected to any auxiliary rooms, whereas in the later levels there were usually small rectangular structures attached to one or, often, two or even three sides. But does this observation apply to house forms in other Halaf settlements? Round structures of the tholos type have been discovered, as is well known, in Halaf levels of settlements situated in the Tigris and Euphrates valleys as well as in Southeastern Turkey,33 i.e. over the entire territory occupied by the Halaf culture. On this basis, the round house should be the most typical, but is this true for all stages of Halaf development? At present, it is not possible to provide a simple answer to this question. In particular, the two best known Halaf settlements, Arpachiyah and Yarim Tepe II, provide apparently different pictures. On the basis of the new excavations (1976) I. Hijara believes that at Arpachiyah the early Halaf levels (XI-IX, following Hijara) are characterized by rectangular architecture.34 Round houses are present in levels VIJI-VI and, especially, in V-II (which correspond to levels TT10 of Mallowan). According to Hijara, in the final Halaf stage (Level I or TT6) the architecture becomes again rectangular; at Yarim Tepe II, however, we have demonstrated that the architec- ture remains essentially the same throughout all the building levels. The conclusions at Yarim Tepe II are based on extensive excavation of the site, while Hijara's reconstruction of the architectural history of Arpachiyah reflects the evidence of a single trench, which can hardly be regarded as convincing. We obviously need new data from a number of sites in order finally to resolve such questions. Such data should also help to solve the problem of Halaf origins. 2. Burials and Cult Objects A few dozen Halaf burials have been discovered in various strata at Yarim Tepe II, fifteen of which come from the early levels of the settlement (9 to 8, squares 19, 29, burials 48-62).35 Six are inhumations: four individual infant burials (57, 58, 60, 62), one double infant burial (59) and one with the remains of two adults and a child (61). None was connected with any structure. The dead were buried fully con- tracted, on their sides with their heads to the south. Two burials contained grave goods. Of particular interest was burial 58 in which a miniature grey cup filled with beads was found standing in front of the skull. It contained 572 beads, including 10 33 M. E. L. Mallowan and J.

The occurrence of cremation burials at Yarim Tepe II is of especial interest, since no other evidence for cremation is known in prehistoric Mesopotamia. Three skull interments were found in the same area (square 23): two with single skulls and one with three skulls in the same pit. In this connection the two skull interments found in 1976 at Arpachiyah should be noted.37 One secondary burial was found, an infant's skull deposited on top of a pile of its other bones (48). These data illustrate the diversity of Halaf burial ritual and the general complex- ity of ideology of these early agriculturalists in North Mesopotamia. In addition to the cremation burials, there are other examples of ritual at Yarim Tepe II: special pits were found with remains of fire, the burnt bones of animals and intentionally broken vessels. One such pit (0.6 x 0 5 x 0 2 m, section 19-a, depth 5-45 to 5-64 m) contained scattered fragments of a unique painted anthropomorphic vessel in the shape of a female figurine (Plate VII and cf. Sumer 37 (1981), p. 41, Fig. XI), a broken alabaster plate (see Sumer 37 (1981), p. 45, Fig. XV, bottom right), a quadrangular stone seal with a carved design and an eyehole on the back for suspension, and the fragments of a simple clay bowl. Another pit (0.8 x 05 m, section 28-a, depth 6-6 to 6-8 m) contained fragments of several vessels, including a zoomorphic vessel which resembles a pig (Plate VIII and cf. Sumer 37 (1981), pp. 37-8, Figs. VII-VIII). Although zoomorphic vessels are known at other Halaf sites, these two specimens are unique. In the absence of similar cult objects at other Halaf settlements, no detailed interpretation can yet be given. But a few observations can be made. In the first place, the evidence for ritual ceremonies described above was found in the same area of the settlement as the remains of inhumations. Moreover, the presence of unique objects in such contexts would appear to be characteristic. The copper seal-pendant found in the deliberate deposit under the floor of tholos LXVII, the earliest metallic seal so far discovered, belongs to this same group of unique objects. The trapezoidal microlithic obsidian tools found under the floor of the same tholos are also unusual. It should be emphasized that this evidence for ritual is found only in the early levels at Yarim Tepe II; moreover, it seems likely that the ritual inhumations and the other evidence for ritual are related. 3. Stone and Bone Artefacts By far the largest group of stone tools from both the early and the later levels at Yarim Tepe II are for agricultural purposes. They include grinding stones for grain made of local limestone (25 from the lower two levels), pestles (10), mortars (10), and a few rounded stones which are possibly digging stick weights. Two basalt mortars are particularly highly polished and have a very distinctive shape. Flint and obsidian tools are plentiful, especially in the early levels. Flint is most common as semi-finished products and production waste (350 specimens altogether from Levels 9 to 8), while obsidian occurs almost exclusively as finished tools (180 objects). Obsidian tools are three times more numerous than flint. As at other Halaf sites the most common tools are narrow retouched blades, which were hafted to form knives or sickles (cf. Sumer 37 (1981), pp. 43-4, Figs. XIII-XIV). Flint was also used to 37 Hijara in World Archaeology 10 (1978).</page><page sequence="28">28 N. Ya. MERPERT AND R. M. MUNCHAEV make scrapers, drills and sharp points. As in the earlier Hassuna phase at Yarim Tepe, the obsidian was imported from Anatolia while the flint was local. Among the other stone objects from Yarim Tepe II (Levels 9 to 8) are one diorite and two alabaster conical spindle whorls (Fig. 11, 6), and five complete small vessels as well as fragments of ten others (see Sumer 37 (1981), p. 45, Fig. XV). The stone bowls were made of alabaster, limestone, marble and other stones, and do not differ, on the whole, from vessels found in the later Halaf levels or on other Halaf sites. Their fine quality attests the skill of the Halaf stone workers, as does that of other objects, in particular the pendants and beads found at Yarim Tepe II. The former are of two types: flat, pierced oval ones (Fig. 13, 1, 2) and seal-pendants.

However, such objects are not yet attested in the earliest level and only four come from Level 8. The seal-pendants are small and occur in a variety of forms (Fig. 13, 3-10). They are made for the most part of steatite and serpentine, but there are some of marble, sandstone, diorite and rock crystal. Such stone artefacts are very characteristic of the Halaf culture, the most significant collections coming from Arpachiyah and Tepe Gawra.38 Indeed it would appear that the Mosul area was the centre of production of such objects. We have already noted the carnelian, rock crystal and steatite beads found in burial 58. Bone objects are standardized but not common: eleven awls and two spatulas only were found in the lower levels. 4. Pottery and other clay objects Clay objects occur in enormous numbers in all levels of Yarim Tepe II. Such artefacts include scrapers and spindle whorls. The former are made of potsherds and are oval or triangular in form; the inside working edge is coarsely chipped (see Sumer 37 (1981), p. 46, Fig. XVI). Such objects occur in all levels (more than 100 in Level 9 alone) and at other Halaf sites. Presumably they were used for preparing animal skins. In Levels 9 to 8 more than thirty spindle whorls were found, mostly biconical. "Sling bullets" were also found in all levels and are typical of the early agricultural settlements of Mesopotamia from the pre-Hassuna period onwards. The pottery vessels are divided into three main groups: painted, simple smoothed, and coarse. In the lower levels of Yarim Tepe II (depth 5-2 to 6-95 m) 26,397 fragments of different vessels were found, including 10,707 painted sherds.39 Of these, 12,155 sherds were recovered from Level 9 (4,997 painted, 6,524 smoothed, and 654 coarse). The unpainted smoothed pottery predominates, providing approximately 55-60% of all pottery recovered throughout all levels at Yarim Tepe II. Roughly 40% of sherds were painted but the proportion of coarse ware is insignificant. All the vessels are handmade. Among the coarse pottery thick-walled and flat-based jars or bowl shapes predominate. Their form, colour (usually dark brown), and the poor quality of clay and firing make them very conspicuous among the rest of the ceramic repertoire; the clay contains a heavy proportion of vegetable temper. Such vessels are found in all levels and show no change throughout the whole period of Halaf occupation. The technical quality of the smoothed pottery is higher, though still inferior to the painted variety. The clay is of a better quality with some admixture of sand and grit. The firing is uneven. The surface of the vessels is slipped (light brown, yellow or white) and sometimes burnished. Both thin-walled (0.5-0.7 cm) and thick-walled (1 0-1 3 cm) vessels are found. The latter include large deep bowls and flat-based pots (up to 40-50 cm in diameter and height) with no handles or ornamentation. The thin-walled vessels are relatively diverse in form and in some instances have spouts and projecting lugs for suspension. The painted pottery is of a very high quality with respect to both clay and firing. 38 Mallowan and Cruickshank Rose, op. cit., 90-6, Fig. 50, P1. VII; Tobler, op. cit. in n. 33, Pls.

MERPERT AND R. M. MUNCHAEV These vessels are slipped and burnished, and are of different colours (brown, cream, rose, white). Their forms repeat those of the simple smoothed ceramics, but each form occurs in a considerable variety of types. Five bowl types have been established (Figs. 14, 16-19 and Plate IXb). All are richly painted, frequently on both interior and exterior surfaces. Some types are common also in the later levels, but types 4 and 5 (Figs. 18-19) are typical at Yarim Tepe II of the earliest levels only. Painted pottery is common at all Halaf sites, but so far no other site has produced the great diversity seen at Yarim Tepe. Comparative analysis has shown that a considerable number of the painted bowls from the early Halaf levels of Arpachiyah resemble those from the lower levels of Yarim Tepe II. The shallow basins and plates are similar in form to the bowls (Plate IX), but only a few have been found in Levels 9 to 8, with not a single polychrome plate of the Arpachiyah type among them. The latter of course occur for the most part only in the latest Arpachiyah level (TT6). Another form of painted vessel typical of the early levels of Yarim Tepe II and second in quantity only to the bowls, is the jar (Sumer 37 (1981), p. 47, Fig. XVII, top left). This general pattern continues throughout all levels, but in the latest stage of the settlement some finer jars with high necks are found, similar to those known at Arpachiyah.40 In the opinion of some researchers jars constitute nearly 5000 of all Halaf vessels.41 This view is not sustained by the evidence from the western Halaf sites where jars are relatively rare, though they seem to be more common in the Tigris valley, as at Arpachiyah. Low-necked jars are also known from Yarim Tepe II. The Yarim Tepe Halaf pottery finds its closest parallels at Arpachiyah. However, it includes the most typical forms from both western and eastern Halaf sites as well as some unique examples, in particular the zoo- and anthropo-morphic vessels described above. A smaller fragment of a vessel similar to the elephant- or pig-like example from Yarim Tepe (Plate VIII and cf. Sumer 37 (1981), p. 37-8, Figs. VII-VIII) was found at Arpachiyah,42 but we know of no parallel for the very striking female vessel (Plate VII). The paint colours include brown, red, red-brown, black-brown and, rarely, white, against a background of pink, white, yellow-pink, cream and light green. The painting is usually monochrome; only in a few instances are there combinations of brown and white. Geometric ornament is predominant and frequently makes up complex and graceful compositions. Depictive motifs are also common. We have found fragments of not less than 20 vessels decorated with the typically Halaf bucrania (Fig. 14, 2), generally in the realistic style known at western Halaf settlements such as Chagar Bazar rather than the more stylized Arpachiyah examples.43 Although the similarities to Arpachiyah are close, depictive motifs like those from Yarim Tepe are more common on the western sites. Prominent among these is the "huts and flowers" motif, of which over 100 examples were found in Levels 9 to 8 (Fig. 15, 1-9). This design, as is well known, is also attested at Brak, 40 Mallowan and Cruickshank Rose, op. cit., Fig. 59, 7, 67. 4' S. A. Le Blanc and P. J.

Yarim Tepe has also yielded several sherds with schematic depictions of a tree or bush and some anthropomorphic motifs. Again, these motifs are known on western Halafian ceramics and, occasionally, at Arpachiyah. Mallowan has classed them among the Samarran repertoire. In the earlier levels of Yarim Tepe II a bird motif is common, sometimes painted in white. Most common is the depiction of a single row of birds (Fig. 20, 1-10). These differ from similar motifs found in the later levels of Yarim Tepe II, a situation found also at Chagar Bazar. Also known at Yarim Tepe are an animal (Fig. 21, 8), a fish (Fig. 21, 1) and a snake (Fig. 21, 3, 4, 5). Figurines constitute the final group of clay artefacts. Two complete figurines and fragments of seven others have been found in Levels 9 to 8 (Fig. 12, 1-9). All are stylized. One type is cone-shaped. Such figurines have been encountered in all levels at Yarim Tepe II, and are known also from other Halaf sites.45 A second type is represented by a small seated figure with exaggerated hips and thighs. The lower part of one such figure has survived (Fig. 12, 9). No other Halaf site has produced an example precisely similar to this Yarim Tepe piece but it is in general comparable to a well-attested Halaf type. The remainder of the figurines constitute a third type (Fig. 12, 1-5, 7, 8). They resemble some figurines from Arpachiyah (clay and one stone example) and especially from Tepe Gawra.46 The origin of the Halaf figurines of this type is as yet unclear. They cannot be convincingly compared with any earlier group of anthropomorphic figures, but to a considerable extent this is characteristic of Halaf plastic art as a whole which, as has been correctly stressed by some authorities, stands by itself in prehistoric Mesopotamia, its differences from Hassuna and Samarra being greater than any similarity.47 5. Lower Levels of Yarim Tepe II: Conclusion The question of the origin and the character of the earliest stages of Halaf remain unanswered. Such traits as are known have been established largely on the basis of the ceramic materials from Arpachiyah. However, the stratigraphy of that settle- ment cannot be considered to be absolutely certain. The traits of the early complex defined there are only approximations since they were established without statistical analysis. In the lower levels of Yarim Tepe II all of these are present in considerable numbers but in combination with some other features which are thought to be characteristic of subsequent stages of Halaf development. Therefore, the question whether these Yarim Tepe levels belong to the earliest or to the beginning of a middle stage of Halaf must remain open for the present. There can be no doubt, however, that the seven metre thick deposits of Yarim Tepe II reflect a very long period of development. That this development had begun relatively early is confirmed by radiocarbon determinations from various levels of the settlement (4840 + 180 bc to 4210 + 130 bc).48 44 Ibid., Fig. 77; M. E.

MERPERT AND R. M. MUNCHAEV All of the Yarim Tepe II deposits are demonstrably later in time than the final stage of the Hassuna culture, as can be seen from the fact that all these levels lie directly over the ruins of a small Hassuna settlement. Further evidence for this relationship can be seen in the situation of the Halaf necropolis on the abandoned tell of Yarim Tepe I. It cannot be questioned that the necropolis emerged here after the life-time of the Hassuna settlement. We can conclude that in the late 6th or at the beginning of the 5th millennium bc in the Sinjar plain the Hassuna culture was replaced by a new and genetically alien Halaf culture. The latter was related to a new ethnic group which established cultural unity over a considerable territory in Northern Mesopotamia and Eastern Turkey. The questions of the genesis, original homeland and paths of diffusion or migration of the Halaf culture remain open. It is significant, however, that Yarim Tepe II occupies a geographically central place in the Halaf area and combines traits of both western and eastern groups of Halaf sites. The economy of Yarim Tepe II was based on highly developed forms of production with agriculture predominant. In this respect the Halaf culture inherited and developed the traditions of the preceding cultures and itself constituted an important stage in the process of general development which resulted in the formation of one of the world's earliest civilizations and turned Mesopotamia into a vital centre in the early cultural history of mankind.</page><page sequence="37">PLATE I :~~~~~~~~~~~~ J- t~~~~~~~~ _ @ @ _ _S-e h's'Y 8sk- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~w 91L A N; 4WP -v*tf s - - A s t iMEtS F;bt, s ; @ ~~~" fi't - - Fttbt &lt;5'Woe' &gt;&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A` a. &gt; ^ &lt;^, &lt;v&gt; w - b g toRa-0fd ft ts~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1 '0I ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~; *r _ W ~ * ...D . ..... . . ......'4 =, b S Yai Tep _.
