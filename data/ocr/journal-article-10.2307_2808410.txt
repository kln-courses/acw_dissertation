BRIEF NOTICES EVOLIJTION FUNCTIONAL AFFINITIES OF MAN, MONKEYS, AND APES. A Study of the Bearings of Phys- iology and Behaviour on the Taxonomy and Phylogeny of Lemurs, Monkeys, Apes, and Man. By S. Zuckerman. Harcourt, Brace and Co., New York. $3.00. 81 X 51; xviii + Z03; I933. This book is an appropriate sequel to the author's recent The Social Life of Monkeys and Apes in which are continued his studies of the broader aspects of the inter- relationships of the primates. A not un- successful attempt is made to allocate the phylogenetic position of the primates on the basis of such functional and physi- ological characteristics as the mechanisms of reproduction, blood reactions, receptor organs, behavior patterns, diseases and parasites, hybridization, and cortical physiology. On the whole the phylo- genetic implications of this original method of classification are in agreement with the more orthodox taxonomy based upon morphology. The book is well written, contains an extensive and very valuable bibliography, and an index. FossIL FLORAS OF YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK AND SOUTHEASTERN OREGON. Con- tributions to Palaeontology. Carnegie Insti- tution of Washington Publication No. 4I6. Containing following monographs: Fossil Floras of Yellowstone National Park. Part I. Coniferous Woods of Lamar River Flora, by Charles B. Read; The Trout Creek Flora of Southeastern Oregon, by Harry D. Mac- Ginitie. Carnegie Institution of Washington, D. C. $I.50 (paper); $2.50 (cloth). io x 63; 68 + I6 plates; 1933. There are two monographs in this volume, one on fossil trees and the second on fossils of the small flora. The last adequate ac- count of the plant fossils from the Yellow- stone area, by Knowlton, was published in I899, so that it seems to be time to bring matters up to date. There are six plates of microscopic sections from the fossil trees and I6 plates of seeds and leaf prints, all extremely good. Dr. Read concludes that the genus Pinus was established by Upper Eocene or Lower Oligocene times. Dr. Mac- Ginitie emphasizes the resemblance be- tween the Miocene forest of the Trout Creek region of Oregon and the living floral association of northeastern Asia (Japan and Manchuria). THE EVOLUTION OF MORALITY. By George Whitehead. John Bale, Sons and Dannielsson, London. IOS. 6d. net. 88 x 58; ii + 340; I933. The thesis of this book is that morality has never rested on religious sanctions and that it has its roots in animal be- havior. Unfortunately, Mr. Whitehead has iust two means of studving animal 2.2.5</page><page sequence="2">2-26 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY behavior: one to imagine what animals would do if only they were Englishmen crawling on all fours, the other to pile up quotations from books written by other bookish men. Neither of these methods seems to have led him to any new conclusions. He rises to heights of eloquence only when he denounces women, war, and religion. At other times he is pretty tiresome. THE GENERAL THEORY OF EVOLUTION. By Malcolm MacTaggart. W. Heffer and Sons, Cambridge. is. 6d. net. 74 x 5; vi + 50; I933 (paper). Starting with little and figuratively add- ing nothing the author amuses himself in a metaphysical manner throughout some fifty pages by toying abstractly with pro- fundity and foolishness, by laughing once at the absurdity of pretentious moral suasion, and concluding by asking a few questions which he regards as unanswer- able. The subtle art of engaging a reader's interest or imagination finds no place in the rattle of words in which the evolu- tionary events as given by modern science are held to follow the preconceived logical system of Hegel. Trust as opposed to belief is given as the ideal that will enable human evolution to proceed beyond its present state. MAN AND THE VERTEBRATES. By Alfred S. Romer. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. $3.00. 9 x 6; vii + 427; I933. A brief, comprehensive survey of verte- brates and human evolution written for biological students at the University of Chicago under the new plan of col- lege work. The text serves as outside reading for those students attending the author's lectures on the vertebrates and on the human body. The volume is ex- tensively illustrated. Many of the views of fossil remains and reconstructed groups in museums have not hitherto appeared in text books. The volume contains no bibliography but is indexed, AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY oF Fos- SILS (Plants and Animals). Revised Edition. By Hervey W. Shimer. The Macmillan Co., New York. $4.00. 734X 54; xviii + 496; I933. This is the second edition of a textbook intended for college students who begin the study of paleontology without pre- vious work in biology. Accordingly, the description and discussion of living plants and animals goes side by side with the treatment of fossil forms of the same phyla. It is well illustrated and has an excellent index. GENETICS NATURE AND NURTURE. By Lancelot Hogben. W. W. Norton and Co., New York. $2.75. 8'2 x 58; I44; I933. This book, originally delivered as a series of William Withering Memorial Lectures at the University of Birmingham, covers somewhat the same ground as the author's Genetic Principles in Medicine and Social Science, which was noticed in Vol- ume VII, page 477, of this REVIEW. How- ever, it lays more emphasis on statistical methods appropriate to the study of hu- man genetics and less on dubious gener- alities than did the latter book. The use in genetic analysis of the Principle of Random Mating and of the study of con- sanguineous parentage and familial dis- eases is illustrated. The author empha- sizes the interdependence of nature and nurture, and concludes that while the correlation technique may show the ex- istence of gene differences whose manifest effect is not affected by differences of environment to which different members of a population are exposed The belief that a comparison between observed correlation of relatives and correlations based upon purely genetical assumptions provides us with a measure of the influence of nurture is not justified, because of the close relationship between the distribu- tion of gene differences and differences due to environ- ment in populations of viviparous animals which live in families, especially when, as with human popula- tions, the environment of different families may differ greatly.</page><page sequence="3">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 2iz7 In so far as a balance sheet of nature and nurture has any intelligible significance, it does not entitle us to set limits to changes which might be brought about by regulating the environment. VERERBUNGSLEHRE. Mit besonderer Beruck- sichtigung der Abstammungslehre und des Menschen. Zweite Auflage. Band II: Sexu- alitat und allgemeine Probleme. By Ludwig Plate. Gustav Fischer, Jena. 30 marks (paper); 32. marks (cloth). 9x 62; xiv + 678; I933. This is the second volume of a series of three of the second and expanded edition of the author's masterly Vererbungslehre. Sexuality and problems relating to it are discussed in this volume, 36i pages being devoted to special discussions and 263 to theoretical problems. The author de- velops the material in the same thorough manner which characterized the first volume noticed previously in these col- umns (Vol. VIII, p. 103). A bibliography of 2.8 pages is appended. GENERAL BIOLOGY CHARLES DARWIN's DIARY OF THE VOYAGE OF H. M. S. "BEAGLE." Edited from the MS by Nora Barlow. The Macmillan Co., New York. $6.50. 98X 68; xxx + 45'; I933. This volume is a documentary contri- bution of first class importance to the history of biology. Since its first ap- pearance in I839 Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle has been one of the most widely read books on natural history ever pub- lished. It is now justly regarded as one of the world's great classics. But hitherto all that we have had is the finished work, as Darwin gave it to the world. The volume now before us, edited with the most painstaking care and accuracy and a fine sense of the highest type of bibliographic scholarship by one of Dar- win's granddaughters, gives the complete text of the original diaries- 'eighteen little pocket-books''-in which Darwin made his daily notes and from which he composed the Journal of . . . . the Voyage ... . for publication. It is a superb production, from every point of view. It contains such homely details as that at the next opportunity there are to be purchased "night-caps," '' lbs. common soap," etc. It shows how Darwin's ideas changed about evolutionary prob- lems. It shows how bad a speller a very great man may be. Altogether it is a great book, which no biological library, public or private, can be without. DYSHARMONIES ET DIsCONTINUITES DANS LA CROISSANCE. Actualites Scientifiques et Industrielles gy. Expose's de Biometrie et de Statistique Biologique I. By Georges Teissier. Hermann et Cie, Paris. io francs. 9- x 68; 39; 1934 (paper). In the first of a series of monographs on mathematical biology Teissier describes the researches on the relative growth of the different parts of an organism which have been made by various workers, notably by Huxley and by Teissier him- self. The rate of growth of one organ in a wide variety of forms is found to be either equal or proportional to that of other organs. This law of growth may be derived from the assumption, for which there is experimental evidence, that the rate of growth of an organ is proportional to the mass of the organ and to the amount of food available. In some cases the rate of relative growth changes abruptly at some stage in the development of the organism. This change may perhaps be the result of the coming into action of new hormones, although this hypothesis is not yet definitely confirmed by experi- mental evidence. Altogether this is an interesting account of a line of work which may shed new light on the complex problem of growth. There is a bibli- ography of one page. THE LIVING WORLD.

To this end, the text itself does not give the information to answer all the questions but it must be supplemented by observation, other books, and the teacher. Purposely, much more material is given than can be used in a single course; part of this is arranged as additional work for quick pupils. Many useful and interesting teaching de- vices are included. We would personally take exception to some of the statements made, such as part of the section on al- cohol. Throughout the book there is considerable emphasis and space devoted to the public health aspect of biology which is surely laudable. As a whole the book seems somewhit uneven-some parts are very simple and some too ad- vanced for most high school pupils. Although the author states that the book has grown out of an actual course, it seems rather too ambitious in scope and ma- terial required for many schools. THE SCIENCE OF RADIOLOGY. Edited by Otto Glasser. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, Ill. $4.50. 94 x 64; xiii + 450; I933. Twenty-eight American scientists have contributed to this extremely fine book on radiology. It islpart of the program of the radiologists eveloped in connec- tion with the Century of Progress Exposi- tion and the first International Congress of Radiologists. It is edited by and the first two chapters are written by Otto Glasser. Apparently everything is here -history, physics, apparatus, use. Some of the chapters are highly technical, but they contain just the sort of information one wants. Muller has an excellent chapter reviewing his x-ray induced muta- tions and Packard has summarized his work on the biologic effects of x-rays. The bibliographies are an especially valu- able feature. There are both name and subject indices. CAVERNS OF VIRGINIA.

The western portion of Virginia is honey- combed with caverns of an unusual and striking character which attract a large number of visitors throughout the year. This book has been prepared by the Virginia Geological Survey to give to the interested individual a general knowledge of the geological history and physiog- raphy of the Appalachian Valley, of methods of cave tormation, and of their characteristics. All of the important de- veloped caverns are described in detail. The volume is excellently illustrated with photographs and maps and contains a glossary, a literature list and an index.

In this interesting study the author de- velops for the special cases of symbiosis and parasitism various modifications of Lotka's and Volterra's equations for the evolution of a system of species. Apply- ing his equations to Perez's distribution of number of visceral sacs of Chiorogaster in parasitized Pagurus he concludes that this is not a case of multiple parasitism but of the budding of a single parasite.

Heffer and Son, Cambridge. is. 6d. net. 71 x 487; iii + 27; I933 (paper). According to the authors the energy of momentum resulting from the detach- ment of the moon from the earth led to the formation of bi-nuclear or "Vital" atoms. This theory, they state, "will explain and account for all and every phenomenon of vitalism;" just how is not entirely clear to us. HUMAN BIOLOGY LA COSTITUZIONE INDIVIDUALE. Dottrina. Metodo. Tipi Morfologici. Volumes I and II. By G. Viola. Licinio Cappelli, Bologna. L. IOO. IO x 67; Vol. I, xx + 45 5; Vol. II, v + 397; I933 (paper). The concept that the somatic structure of the individual is related to the organic structure and so indicates the predisposi- tion of the individual to disease was revived by Benecke and De Giovanni about 5o years ago. This, the soundest interpretation of medical constitution, is now maintained in Europe only by Viola and his students. In these volumes are collected the ma- jority of his writings since I902, in which he has developed this concept especially with regard to the anthropometric method of determining the morphologic types. The work consists of three parts. The first deals with the history and theories of constitution, which the author de- fines as "the science of the correlated anatomical and functional, physical and psychic characters of the individual." The second part is very important for its discussion of the difference between constitutional type and anomaly and disease. Here is an excellent criticism of the weakness inherent in the genetic concept of J. Bauer and others. In the third part are collected his articles on anthropometric measurements. He has devised a special apparatus to be used instead of the anthropometer and ap- parently more satisfactory for laboratory purposes. The measurements taken that he considers have an anatomical and physiological significance are only nine or the trunk and two for the limbs. From the constants calculated on 350 Venetian male adults he has derived a system of gradation that permits a com- parable classification of all individuals. In this schematic review, justice cannot be done to other important articles which contain the results of investigation on</page><page sequence="6">230 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY disease associated with bodily types, the correlation of external measurements with roentgenograms of different organs, etc. There is also an excellent review of the writings on the evolutionary significance of bodily habitus. No student of human constitution can do without consulting this work which illustrates the basic scientific method necessary for future research. THE SOCIAL COST OF INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE. By Maurice Taylor. Alfred A. Knopf, New York. $3.-5. 8 x 5; xxxviii + 42.1; 1933. This investigation deals with a social problem of importance which has never been sufficiently considered. The so- called industrial insurance is a special form for people with small incomes, which does not require medical examina- tion and is sold at small weekly premi- ums. These are collected by the agents, whose salesmanship is of the high pres- sure variety. It becomes thus relatively expensive for both companies and the policyholders. The result, as even a casual observer will have noted, is that after a period the varying economic state of the insured may force him to ask for cash value or to lapse. In either case he has lost by the transaction. The purpose of this study is to measure this loss, which for the period i92.8-I932. the author esti- mates for lapsed insurance alone) at almost 0oo million dollars. The ma- terial is derived almost wholly from the records of three large insurance companies, which may explain why on page I53 the chapter heading ends with an interro- gation point: "Do the companies gain from lapses?" The subject matter includes a brief historical note on the origin of this form of insurance policy, followed by a very clear outline of the difference between it and the ordinary policy. The author proceeds to give the extent of its devel- opment in this country and geographical distribution of the insured. Especially well done are the chapters on the analysis of the cost, which is compared with that of the ordinary form, and his proposals in regard to families dependent on public welfare. His general recommendations include a lowering of the cost with greater consequent benefits to the policy holders, the limitation of sales in ratio to the income, etc. Some of these recommen- dations are useless, we feel, because unless paternalism increases, a change of method will depend wholly on the attitude of the insurance companies and their estimate of possible profit. IN THE WAKE OF "THE BOUNTY." To Tahiti and Pitcairn Island. By Charles Chauvel. Endeavour Press, Sydney. 6shillings. 8&amp; x 58; 57; 1933. This book, a by-product of the author's film of the same name, contains a brief narrative of the mutiny of the Bounty and the subsequent history of the muti- neers and an account of Mr. Chauvel's own experience in making the film. The most interesting part of the book is the description of the Pitcairn Islanders of today, the descendants of the mutineers. About thirty years ago the island was converted to Seventh Day Adventism, with deplorable effects. Their new religion has brought to them a mass of modern "taboos" as fantastic as any of the tribal inhibitions of the Polynesian savages of yore. Tea is a drug and disallowed in the homes, while to smoke publicly on the island would be an offence. Baking- soda has been condemned, and the missionaries have even tried to prevent the eating of all meat. The pig, which in the past was so prized on Pitcairn, is to-day an unclean animal, and no one is allowed to own one. All literature except religious books and tracts and a panic-stricken sheet called "The Signs of the Times" are censored from the island. Dancing is not allowed, and only religious records and nurs- ery rhymes are encouraged on the gramophone. They have been taught to believe that the enm Tof the world is very near at hand, and in this the Book of Revela- tions is followed most literally-each fresh earth- quake or pestilence experienced in some part of the world being regarded as a new and definite portent that the end is in sight. The people are now so definitely rooted in this belief that no provision is made for their future; no young coconuts or breadfruit-trees have been planted, and the same applies to the timber of the island, which has been continually felled for the building of their homes and boats without thought of replanting for future nceds.</page><page sequence="7">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 23I THE EFFECT OF TROPICAL SUNLIGHT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF BONES OF CHILDREN IN PUERTO RICO. A Roentgenographic and Clinical Study of Infants and Young Children with Special Reference to Rickets and Related Factors. U. S. Department of Labor, Chil- dren's Bureau Puhlication No. 217. By Martha M. Eliot. U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington. io cents. 98X 5; v + I'"; I933 (paper). In a previous investigation, undertaken jointly by the Children's Bureau and the Department of Pediatrics of Yale Uni- versity, it was found that in a large pro- portion of cases the bones of infants living in a temperate climate (New Haven, Conn.) showed sooner or later certain minor changes which were interpreted as evidence of slight rickets regardless of the fact that the infants observed had been given what was thought to be an amount of cod-liver oil sufficient to prevent rickets. The present study, of 584 infants living in a tropical country exposed the year round to intense sunlight, was made by the same investigators to determine whether or not the roentgenographic changes usually interpreted as signs of slight rickets should not be regarded as physiological variations of normally growing bone. After working over the clinical and x-ray records of both the New Haven and Puerto Rico studies, Dr. Eliot and her co-workers were able to conclude that rickets is practically absent in the tropical country, and that the bone changes previously believed to be signs of early or mild rickets are probably correct. From a scientific viewpoint it is difficult to over- estimate the value of work of this char- acter. The dividing line between the limits of physiological normality and early pathology is so nebulous and knowl- edge concerning it is, of such importance in almost every field of medical practice that every contribution is of the greatest moment. A short summary report of the paper under review will be found in the American Journal of Diseases of Children, Vol. 46, p . IZ37- THE MIND OF CHINA. By Edwin D. Harvey. Yale University Press, New Haven. $3.50. 9x X 61; xi + 3) I; I933. This is a fundamental contribution to studies on the Chinese. The author, long a resident of China as Professor of Soci- ology at the College of Yale-in-China, at Changsha (Hunan Province) has had un- usual opportunities to observe and study the social system of the Chinese, the influence which their profound faith in ancestor worship has upon their daily lives and customs, their extraordinary dependence on every sort of magic and their belief in the "existence of another world of spirits, a shadowy but real counterpart of life here on earth." Un- derdevelopment of the industrial and economic arts and overgrowth in popu- lation are two of China's most serious problems. Both of these are deeply con- ditioned by an inveterate animism. Re- nunciation of the philosophy of animism and the acceptance of the obviously effec- tive materialism and industrialism of the West is the essence of the temper of Young China today. The masses (nearly one quarter of the world population) have merely turned the new expressions into the old animistic molds. However, a collapse of the old way of thinking and living is bound to come with the new education, the growth of railroads and industry; and because of this China will be faced with a problem of immense com- plexity. A new philosophy of living must be evolved. The volume is copi- ously documented and is indexed. THE LIFE OF A FosSIL HUNTER. By Charles H. Sternberg. Charles H.

The Life of a Fossil Hunter (first printing I909) deals with the author's wide experience in collecting in the western part of the United States. Hunting for fossils in the seventies and eighties involved far more</page><page sequence="8">232. THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY than patiently searching for fruitful places to excavate. It meant danger from hostile Indians, days with little or no food, nar- row escapes from drowning, etc. For bight seasons Sternberg worked with Cope in the field. This part of the book will perhaps be of the greatest interest to biologists as he writes most entertainingly of Cope and their joint experiences which were often of a thrilling character. Hunt- ing Dinosaurs (first printing I9I7) is a sequel to The Life of a Fossil Hunter. After i912 the author and his three sons spent much time in the Red Deer region in Alberta where are to be found the richest Cretaceous fossil fields in the world. Neither of these books is devoted merely to the author's experiences in hunting fossils. They contain much information concerning fossil beds and their contents, the manner of collecting, description and illustration of findings and methods of preparing specimens for exhibitions. Many of the finest specimens of extinct mammals in the American Museum of Natural History, in the Victoria Me- morial Museum at Ottawa, as well as in various European museums are due to the enthusiastic labors of Sternberg and his assistants. The books can be recom- mended for general libraries, particularly high school libraries. They open up a fascinating field for embryonic naturalists. Both volumes are abundantly illustrated and indexed. URBAN SOCIETY. By Noel P. Gist and L. A. Halbert. Thomas Y. Crowell Co., New York. $3.50. 77 X 5a; xv + 724; I933. This is a study of the growth and char- acteristics of American cities and their populations. It is less concerned with the possibilities for uplift than it is with the detailed description and interpretation of these curious animal aggregations. It is, quite literally, a study in human ecology and its plan and method are based to a large extent on ecological concepts. The study is carried out with thoroughness and considerable literary skill. The kind of information conveyed by case histories and crime statistics is not represented here; the emphasis is on the social and economic factors that influence the founding and growth of cities, on migrations to, from, and within cities, and on the effects the peculiar conditions of city life have had on human behavior. The authors have made frequent and effective use of long quotations from sociological studies of particular cities, and their data, on which charts and tables are based, are recent enough to show some of the trends of cities during the depression. It will make a good college textbook but it deserves a wider sale than that. There are a con- siderable number of thoughtful people whose contacts with city life have been neither close enough nor of long enough duration to give them a basis for under- standing the system of cooperative compe- tition that underlies urban life, and they should find this book useful in this respect. There are annotated bibliographies at the end of each chapter and good indexes, one for subjects and one for names of cities. THE EMPTY QUARTER, being a Description of the Great South Desert of Arabia Known as Rub 'al Khali. By H. St. J. B. Philby.

In I9I7 he had crossed the peninsula from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea-the first European since Sadlier, a century before, to make the journey-and in I9I8 he had explored the Jabal Tuwaiq as far as the Wadi Dawasir but had been forced to turn back regretfully without penetrating the Rub'al Khali or Empty Quarter, the great southern desert of Arabia, "perhaps the largest blank on the map outside the Polar regions." Early in I932 Ibn Sa'ud made him leader of an expedition which crossed the desert from the Persian Gulf to its southern border and thence westward through its most desolate portion to Wadi Dawasir. On the first part of the journey there were occasional wells, covered to protect them from the shifting sands,</page><page sequence="9">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 233 but for the last 375 miles the party had to depend entirely on the water that they carried with them. The supposed ruins of the legendary city of Wabar which they visited turned out to be a meteorite crater. Appendices give reports on the meteorites and silica glass found there as well as on other geological, zo6logical and botanical specimens collected by Mr. Philby. The book also contains an index and excellent maps of the route of the expedition. This is an exciting book of adventure as well as a first rate narrative of an important scientific exploration. ANCIENT AZTALAN. Bulletin of the Public Museum of the City of Milwaukee Vol. XIII. By S. A. Barrett. Milwaukee Public Museum, Milwaukee. $7.00. IO8 x 7; 6oz; I933 (paper). The ancient earth-works at Aztalan, situated in south-eastern Wisconsin, are among the more important archaeological sites in the United States. Although definite knowledge of their existence dates from the Black Hawk War in i832, little actual, organized exploration and excavation has been done, with the excep- tion of the survey made in i85o by Dr. 0. A. Lapham, until I919 when the author of this book began his investigations. The principal features of the site are the ridge surrounding it, the remains of a stockade, and numerous pits and mounds, only one of which yielded a burial that could be considered authentic. It had long been held that this was a ceremonial spot, but the author abandons this theory on the evidence he has collected and holds the view that it served the more prosaic purposes of defense and utilitarian service. He likewise discards the belief that the ancient inhabitants of Aztalan knew the art of making brick. His assumption is that native clay, mixed with grasses, was used to line the stockade to make it stronger as a defense, and that when it was burned, presumably by enemies, the clay baked and broke off in "bricks" lumps irregular in form. This publication is well illustrated with maps showing the present topog- raphy of the site, as well as those made by Dr. Lapham, and many excellent photographs of the earth-works and their contents. The author has also provided a bibliography of seven pages an an index. HEREDITY AND ENVIRONMENT. Studies in the Genesis of Psychological Characteristics. By Gladys C. Schwesinger. Edited by Frederick Oshorn. The Macmillan Co., New York. $4.00. 93- x 61; ix + 484; I933 . This is a critical compendium of the stud- ies made to determine the relative influ- ence of heredity and environment on the development of personality and intelli- gence. Its value lies in the clarity of the author's views and her ability to take full cognizance of all the more important investigations. Splitting the psychological character- istics into intelligence and personality is, as the author admits, arbitrary and evi- dently done only for the purpose of con- sidering the so-called intelligence tests separately from general psychological theories. With regard to the intelligence tests, the author is rather diffuse but complete in the examination of all the literature. Her conclusion is that they are "valid and reliable," but she im- mediately adds: "Since many extravagant and even bizarre claims have at times been made on such topics as group differ- ences in intelligence . . . . it is essential in interpreting such data that a proper perspective be kept." This sober outlook is characteristic of the objectivity of the book. The part that treats of personality is, compared to the other, very schematic though in no way incomplete. We do not find here the same thorough analysis as for the intelligence tests. Finally, the author arrives at the only conclusion possible, that is, that the investigations so far conducted cannot be said to have found an answer to the question. This volume makes an excellent text- book and will be useful for all students of the subject.</page><page sequence="10">234 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY THE AMERICAN ABORIGINES. Their Origin and Antiquity. A Collection of Papers by Ten Authors, Assembled and Edited by Diamond Jenness. University of Toronto Press, Toronto. $z. 50. 94x 64; 396; I933. The ten papers in this volume, all by recognized experts in their respective fields, make an extremely valuable sym- posium on the present status of knowledge about the American Indian. While it is impossible here to review the book in detail some of the outstanding con- clusions may be mentioned. W. A. John- ston is of the opinion that western migra- tion routes to North America have been open for zs,ooo to 30,000 years, much longer than any possible route in the north-east. Alfred- S. Romer holds that there is no paleontological evidence sug- gesting the presence of man in North America earlier than the withdrawal of the last Pleistocene ice sheet. On archeo- logical grounds N. C. Nelson reaches the same conclusion. E. A. Hooton con- cludes a brilliant essay on the thought that the American race is a composite race "composed of heterogeneous strains welded together by mixture," Clark Wissler is of opinion that the great variety of cultures and of traits in the New World has obscured whatever may have been transferred directly from the Old World. Roland B. Dixon refuses to allow any of the claims made for diffusion of cultures across the southern Pacific , to South America. The value of the book is seriously im- paired by the absence of an index. 66o RUNAWAY Boys. Why Boys Desert Their Homes. By Clairette P. Armstrong. Richard G. Badger, Boston. $3.00. 8 x 5; zo8; I933. This book consists essentially of a statisti- cal analysis of case histories, from the Children's Court of New York City, of 66o boys charged with deserting their homes. The various factors reviewed include, among others, age, intellectual ability, physical defects, nationality, edu- cation, economic status, and home con- ditions. Thus it was found that runaway boys have an average age of approximately I3 years and an average I. Q. of 77.7; that fifty per cent of them have nervous habits such as enuresis, masturbation, temper-tantrums, and so on; that seventy- five per cent are of foreign or mixed par- entage; that fifty per cent are graded above their inherent capacities in school; that twenty per cent have both parents employed; that only forty-five per cent have both parents living and living to- gether; that thirty per cent have either a step-mother or step-father. An interesting chapter is devoted to the boys' reasons for leaving home. Of these, excessive beatings, fear of beating and punishment, and a hatred of school or school teacher are given in over fifty per cent of the cases. It is questionable whether the subtitle of the book has been appropriately chosen. AN ASTRONOMER's LIFE. By Edwin B. Frost. Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston. $3.50. 8 x 512; xi + 300; I933 v This is an interesting and stimulating autobiography of a distinguished as- tronomer, who had the devastating mis- fortune to go blind at the zenith of his professional career. The simple yet lofty courage with which Professor Frost met this calamity has been an inspiration to his colleagues and friends. His whole life exemplifies and illustrates the traditional virtues and abilities of the New England stock from which he stems. The Frost family, with its record of achievement in scholarly pursuits, is a perfect paradigm for the eugenist. Professor Frost writes withl clarity and charm, and his life has been an interesting one. We recommend this book strongly to the general reader as well as to the scientific man. Like a great many as- tronomers of this day and age Professor Frost leans in his philosophic thinking towards a vaguely mystical sort of deism, which we fear will be somewhat unsym- pathetically viewed by the younger gener- ation of hard-boiled, wholly materialistic biologists.</page><page sequence="11">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS Z35 THE CONQUEST OF A CONTINENT or The Ex- pansion of Races in America. By Madison Grant. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. $3.00. 85 x 6; xv + 393; I933 . The thesis of this history of the United States is that Protestant Nordics were not only the best immigrants this country ever received, its best soldiers, and its best citizens but they were so far in the majority during its colonization and up until the Civil War that they alone are the founders of the nation. No other group has made any significant contribution ofa beneficial sort to our culture according to Grant, and it is the duty of Protestant Nordics to take immediate steps to preserve their suprem- acy, among other things by putting a stop to all further immigration, deporting as many aliens as possible, and putting into effect a number of eugenic proposals. The plan of the book is to classify each group of immigrants according to its racial com- position, and to trace the movements of its members and their descendants as they migrated from state to state, and to present a racial survey of the 48 states and of'the Latin-American countries to the south. There are about a dozen maps, a bibliog- raphy, and an index. Every professional flag-waver will want a copy. FLIGHT INTO AMERICA S PAST. Inca Peaks and Maya Jungles. By Marie Beale. G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York. $3.50. 4x 6;xv + z86; I933. A travel book of considerable interest, by an amateur archeologist. Mrs. Beale writes most entertainingly of her trip, mostly by airplane, from Buenos Aires across the Andes to Santiago and then into the land of the Inca. One never ceases to marvel that Cuzco, the sacred city of the Inca, situated high in the Andes and seemingly almost inaccessible to the Euro- pean invaders, should have become a Spanish town within fifty years of Co- lumbus' great discovery. Inca rule was paternalistic. Close communication was kept up throughout the vast area by well built foot ways. It is said that fish from the ocean could be delivered in Cuzco in twenty-four hours. Now by train it takes fifty or more. The author's interest in early Peruvian history led her to visit many places which disclose the high develop- ment of Inca civilization and the super- imposed Spanish culture. After Lima she went to Guatamala and Yucatan and visited Mayan ruins. Her book is profusely illustrated, mostly with her own photographs, which are excellent. A bibliography is included but there is no index. FROHE LEBENSARBEIT. Erinnerungen und Bekenntnisse eines Hygienikers und Natur- forschers. By Karl B. Lehmann. J. F. Lehmann, Munchen. 4.50 marks (paper); 6 marks (cloth). 8-&amp; x 54; 3X-8; 1933. Karl Bernhard Lehmann, one of the pioneers in the movement of public health and hygiene in Germany and one of the founders of modern bacteriology, offers us in this book the story of a long life, spent in arduous yet joyous labor. He tells us of his happy school-years in Zurich during the sixties and seventies of the past cen- tury; of his years of apprenticeship under Pettenkofer and Koch in Munich and Ber- lin, and of his 45 successful years as Pro- fessor of Hygiene in the medical faculty of the University of Wiirzburg. Professor Lehmann is far removed from being a mere reporter. There is not a 'dry' page in the whole book. He gives us exquisite and telling character sketches of his many friends and co-workers, and fine descriptions of the countries he lived in or visited. Fur- thermore, he defines his position with re- gard to public health, scientific investiga- tion, education, literature, art, politics, the state and destiny of his country, and religion. It is, in short, a most refreshing and stimulating book, filled with wisdom and grateful optimism. ,VW THE GREAT DOCTORS. A Biographical His- tory of Medicine. By Henry E. Sigerist.

The great doctors are those whose creative work or teachings have had an important part in the evolution of medicine. Fifty-three names (excluding those linked with mythology) are in the list, beginning with Hippocrates and ending with Osler. Briefly but vividly, the lives and works of each of these is in review and the part that each one played in furthering the progress of medicine. Excellent reproductions of portraits are included in the work; also a bibliography of the more important gen- eral treatises on the history of medicine and kindred topics, and special works on great doctors.

Under the guidance of an unusually enlightened group of missionaries who have preserved what was good in the old and adapted it towards the new, native writers have been encouraged to produce "works of a literary nature, of outstanding merit among the literary pro- ductions of the modern type among the South African Bantu." THE CHILD, THE TAMILY AND THE COURT. A Study of the Administration of Justice in the Field of Domestic Relations. General Find- ings and Recommendations. U. S.

This report recommends the nation-wide establishment of only one type of court to exercise jurisdiction over all cases directly or indirectly regarding children. This court would take the place of the present juvenile courts, family courts, etc., and also extend its activity to include the work now done by the humane societies, social agencies, etc. This consolidation of judi- cial power is proposed especially to avoid the overlapping of jurisdiction frequently observed in the cases dealt with by these courts and agencies. OUR FOREFATHERS. The Gothonic Nations. A Manual of the Ethnography of the Gothic, German, Dutch, Anglo-Saxon, Frisian and Scandinavian Peoples. Volume 11. By Gudmund Schutte.

The first volume was noticed in Volume 5 of this REVIEW. This part gives accounts of individual Gothonic tribes (Germanic nations) under the same sub- ject headings as were used in the first vol- ume for the Gothonic nations as a whole, -at least, as far as is possible. This is a detailed and scientific study but it is full of interesting details, such as the seven reasons why England came to be called England rather than some name based on the Saxon element in the population. The descriptions of the primitive archi- tecture of the various tribes are also inter- esting to the layman.</page><page sequence="13">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS Z37 THE HAND OF MAN. A Practical Treatise of the Science of Hand Reading Dealing in Detail with its Psychological, Sexual, Superstitious and Medical Aspects. By Noel Jaquin. Faber and Faber, London. izs. 6d. net. 81 x 5a; z68; I933. New and profitable horizons are here dis- closed for the practitioners of the ancient art-pardon! science-of palmistry. It is possible by careful reading of the hand to diagnose the physical ills of an individual, so the author says. For example, diag- nosis of cancer in its early stages, or even before it appears, is evidently child's play for Mr. (or is it Professor?) Jaquin. Not- withstanding his great ability he is really modest. There is, though, brief mention of cases in which the physicians had failed at first and only following the hand reading was the true diagnosis made. We sympa- thize with the poor physicians. How is it possible for them to make a diagnosis when they have not the knowledge acquired through palmistry? IN WILD NEW BRITAIN. The Story of Ben- jamin Danks, Pioneer Missionary. From His Diary. Edited by Wallace Dean. Angus and Rob- ertson, Sydney. 6 shillings net. 7x4 X 3 44; xi + 293; I933. The Reverend Mr. Benjamin Danks and his wife gave eight years of their youth in the attempt to convert the natives of New Britain to Methodism. From I875 to i886 they lived and worked in that savage country and here are recorded their hard- ships and achievements. One cannot but admire their fortitude and that of all those dedicated to such a cause. There are a few interesting accounts of local customs, mention of conflict with traders, but in style and viewpoint the book is strictly ecclesiastical and intended to fire missionary zeal in those of the same faith and profession. THE DIFFUSION OF CULTURE. By G. Elliot Smith. Watts and Co., Lon- don. 7s. 6d. net. 714x 5; x +244; I933. In this book the arch protagonist of the diffusion of culture from a single center, with Egypt as "the pioneer in the inven- tion of civilization," makes a vigorous endeavor to prove the soundness of his position from the very evidence provided by the writings of the antagonists of this theory.

Here are i2o pages of extraordinary repro- ductions of photographs of small animals shown in various stages of active life in natural habitats. The reproductions are technically excellent, giving full force to the beauty of the subjects. The phases of behavior are emphasized by serial pictures such as illustrate the stages of the engulf- ment of a minnow by a coelenterate, the emergence of a damsel fly, the mating of mantids in which the male is finally eaten by the female, a caterpillar spinning its cocoon, and many others equally interest- ing. The pictures are arranged so that biological forms take a related order. Each picture has a title and descriptive notes accompanying it. After the pictures there follow about fifty pages of text in which are given interesting comments on the biology of the general classes. The pictures representative of the class are also discussed in the order in which they are arranged in the first part of the book. An alphabetical index is given last. This book will be valued by the scientific biolo- gist as well as by the esthetic nature lover, and it will probably attract many who are habitually indifferent to the less obvious occurrences in nature. DIPTERA OF PATAGONIA AND SOUTH CHILE. Based Mainly on Material in the British Museum (Natural History). Part IV. Em- pididae. By J. E. Collin. British Museum (Natural History), London. iS shillings net. 84 U5; Viii + 334; I933. The first volume of this series by Alexander, noticed in Volume VI of the REVIEW, gives a brief description of the collecting trip where specimens described here were gathered. The collecting was done bv F. W. Edwards of the British Museum and R. C. Shannon of the Bacteriological Insti- tute of the National Department of Hygiene, Argentina. There were about 30,000 specimens of Diptera taken which eventually will be described in seven volumes. This section by.Collin, although Part IV, is the second to be completed. There were 247 species of Empididae repre- sented in the collection, of which I98 are new to science. All these and some Empididae from other collections made in the same area are included in the detailed taxonomic description. There is an index. There appears to be a general tendency for the Empid fauna of any distinct faunal region to develop marked peculiarities of its own, and the Patagonian fauna is certainly no exception, but it will be gathered from the information here given, that, on the whole, it shows a distinctly greater resemblance to the fauna of the South Australian region than to any other.

A new edition, revised and containing much new material, of a work which has been widely accepted as standard in the study of reptiles (first edition I9IO). The nomenclature has been completely brought up to date and the text enlarged to include all recent important discoveries. The work, however, departs considerably from the hand-book type. The author presents in popular manner a general survey of the reptiles of the world and includes many of his own methods in capturing, feeding and treatment of animals in captivity. The 89 excellent photographic plates col- lected at the end of the volume are valuable for identification purposes.

Angus and Robertson, Sydney. 6 shillings. 74 x 4v + 234; I933. Gulliver, in the person of the author, is an Australian entomologist and natural his- torian who writes of his many experiences while rambling over the Australian conti- nent. A chapter (or more) is devoted to each of the divisions of the Commonwealth including the island of Tasmania. The author stresses his personal experiences while collecting in the various regions and gives the reader many interesting annota- tions about insect life. The book is of interest to the American reader since it gives a familiar insight into the all too un- familiar Australia. Mr. Carter does not hesitate to tell of his companions and various people met with on his travels, which frequently adds zest to the reading. Some readers will find many of the refer- ences to insect life too anthropomorphic to suit their taste. BIOLOGY OF BRACHYMERIA FONSCOLOMBEI (DuFOUR), A HYMENOPTEROUS PARASITE OF BLOWFLY LARVAE. U. S. Department of Agriculture Technical Bulletin No. 365. By Raiford A. Roberts. U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington. 5 cents. 9 X 587; 2I; I933 (paper). Brachymeria, a chalcid parasite of blowfly larvae, is carefully studied under field con- ditions. It is found in Europe, Asia, and North America where it most actively parasitizes larvae of the genus Sarcophagia. It readily attacks Synthesiomyia, Phoremia, Lucia, and Calliphora, but when it attacks the screw-worm, larvae of Cochliomyia ma- cellaria Fab., both insects fail to complete development. The parasite egg is injected into the host larvae, where, upon hatching, it develops within the maggot. After pupation of the host the parasite completely consumes the pupae and then pupates within the host puparium. Eggs from unfertilized females produce only males, and the sex ratios are frequently irregular in progeny from ferti- lized females. At Uvalde, Texas, eight generations occur during the year, and about one third of the fly larvae in small field carcasses are infested. The parasite might be useful in control of the blowfly population in general, but as a specific agent against the screw-worm it is not recommended. MORPHOLOGY OF THE INSECT ABDOMEN. Part II. The Genital Ducts and the Ovipositor. Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, Voluzme 89, Number 8. (Publication 3219.) By R. E. Snodgrass. Smithsonian Insti- tution, Washington. 45 cents (free to public libraries). 9' x 6-; I48; I933 (paper). A second monograph on the morphology of the insect abdomen by the lea ing au- thority on insect anatomy (Part I. Gen- eral structure of the abdomen and its appendages). It forms part of a general scheme "to discover the basic plan of arthropod organization that is repeated through the segments, and to see how the special modification in the several body regions of the insect may conform with the structure of a theoretically generalized segment." The author first discusses the general structure of the insect abdomen and the morphology of the gonads and the genital ducts. There follow sections on the ovipositor and associated organs, the ovipositor of Orthoptera, of Hemiptera, and of Hymenoptera. Forty-eight figures accompany the text and a lengthy literature list is given. THE NIDIFICATION OF BIRDS OF THE INDIAN EMPIRE. Volume II. Turdidae-Sturnidae. By E. C. Stuart Baker. Taylor and Francis, London. 30 shillings net. 87 x 6; vii + 564; I933. In this volume the breeding habits and nests of 403 species and subspecies of Passeres breeding in India are described. The ma- terial is arranged by families and sub- families, and includes the thrushes, shrikes, warblers (including the tailor-bird and</page><page sequence="16">240 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY the still more remarkable Ashy wren- warbler), goldcrests, bluebirds, orioles, grackles, and starlings. The classification agrees for the most part with that found in the author's earlier volumes on these birds in the Fauna of British India series. Although much detailed information is supplied in summary form, Mr. Baker's gift of style makes the book very readable. An index of common and scientific names is provided, but there is no bibliography although much of the descriptive material has been taken from other writers. THE ECOLOGY OF ANIMALS. By Charles Elton. Methuen and Co., Lon- don. 3s. 6d. net. 61 x 4; vii + 97; I933a This little book belongs in a series of mon- ographs designed to give brief but authori- tative accounts of the present state of knowledge in biological subjects. The author is Director of the Bureau of Animal Population of the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy in Oxford University. Teachers, students and the general reader will find the volume useful in obtaining general information on eco- nomic problems, on the scope of animal ecology, ecological surveys, animal inter- relations and habits, densities of animal populations and their rates of increase and fluctuations in numbers. A lengthy litera- ture list is given and there is an index. THE GROWTH OF SOME YOUNG RAPTORIAL BIRDS. University of California Publications in Zoology, Volume 40, No. 4. By E. Lowell Sumner. University of Cali- fornia Press, Berkeley. io4 x 61; 32; I933 (paper). Seven young owls and three young eagles were kept under observation in the labora- tory and in the nest during their growth period. Especial attention was given to the development of down and feathers and a number of photographs are given to il- lustrate the types of plumage and the ap- pearance of the birds. Measurements of body weight, feather length, and lengths of humerus and ulna were made; all of these measurements fall along sigmoid growth curves. It appears that raptorial birds eat proportionately less than passerine birds. TERMINOLOGY OI TYPES. By Donald L. Frizzell. The American Midland Naturalist, Vol. XIV, No. 6, pp. 637-668, I933. Another earnest attempt to standardize the terminology of taxonomy. A list of 233 terms is appended giving definitions with the authorities for them. By means of different sizes and styles of type used in this list one can tell which terms the author recommends; which he considers less desir- able but "available for use;" and which are objectionable. There is a short general bibliography as well as the references per- taining to the definitions. BUNYIPS AND BILLABONGS. An Australian Out of Doors. By Charles Fenner. Angus and Robertson, Sydney. 6 shillings net. 7- x 41; xvi + Z4I; I933. An interestingly written series of nature studies on a wide variety of Australian animals, folklore, and curiosities. Many myths concerning natural phenomena are used to create interest. These are ulti- mately followed to their origin in nature without loss of the feeling of wonderment. The young reader who enjoys exploratory information about natural things will make a delighted discovery in this book, and there is no dearth of ideas that chal- lenge adult curiosity.

A careful study of the cyclic changes under- gone by the contractile vacuole of certain ciliate protozoans (the Ophryoscolecidae) shows that the vacuole has three charac- teristic phases in its cycle, the resting pe- riod, systole and diastole. Morphological changes associated with the vacuole and its protoplasmic surroundings are de- scribed. A good bibliography is appended. SUGGESTIONS FOR PHEASANT MANAGEMENT IN SOUTHERN MICHIGAN.

In the preface the author states that The present volume has .... been written in the hope that it will serve the dual purpose, first of giving a airly comprehensive survey of the present position of the knowledge concerning these interesting agents (plant viruses), and secondly of acting as a students' reference book until the progress and correlation of knowledge allow a more comprehensive treatise to be written. For the latter reason, certain subjects have been dealt with in greater detail than is usual in a book of this type. The volume will be found most useful to those working in this field. The tech- nique of studying plant viruses is described in etail, as well as the diseases they cause. Comparisons are drawn in the behavior of the plant and animal viruses so far as is possibfe in the present development of knowledge concerning them, and profitable lines of future work are indicated. Each section concludes with a lengthy literature list. The volume is well illustrated and contains author and general indices. THE PEOPLE'S FORESTS. By Robert Marshall. Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, New York. $z.oo. 8 1 X5; 233; I933. The author first discusses the great devas- tation of our forests from the time of the early settlements up to the present and the usefulness of forests as raw material, for soil and water conservation, and for rec- reational purposes. The latter part of the book is concerned with a discussion of various types of ownership and control of forests and "their effect on the forest, on efficient land use, on the workers,on the consumers and on the dependent communi- ties." In the final chapter is given an outline for a national program of forest conservation. The author is a professional forester who in I932 collaborated with the Forest Service in the preparation of a comprehensive report on the nation's forests. The book contains a list of refer- ences and is indexed. PFLANZENTHERMODYNAMIK. By Kurt Stern.

The first zoo pages are intended to teach biologists enough about thermo- dynamics to enable them to understand its applications to biology. The second part is a discussion of the thermodynamic as- pects of a number of plant processes, per- meability, the ascent of sap, respiration and other metabolic processes, electrical phenomena and surface phenomena. The text is clearly written and it is an impor- tant contribution to physiological litera- ture. It is well indexed, and in the litera- ture citations it is interesting to note that Americans are well represented. FORTSCHRITTE DER BOTANIK. Unter Zusam- menarbeit mit mehreren Fachgenossen. Zwei- ter Band. Bericht iber das Jahr 1932. Edited by Fritz von Wettstein. Julius Springer, Berlin. 24 marks. 93 x 62; iv + 3024 1933 (paper). This is the second number of an annual review of botany written in the same fashion, and as successfully, as the Annual Review of Biochemistry. The field of botany, not including applied botany, has been very thoroughly covered by seventeen German botanists who discuss the ad- vances made in their respective fields in the year I932. The bibliographies are exten- sive and it is worth noting that American work is well represented. It is an indis- pensable book or every botanical library. SEX IN THE PLANT WORLD. By Wilfred W. Robbins and Helen M. Pear- son. D. Appleton-Century Co., New York. $2.OO. 78 X 5; Xii + I93; I933. This survey of reproduction in the plant kingdom is written for people without previous scientific training andfaccordin ly technical terms have been strictly avoided and the story has been told in pictures as far as possible. As popular scientific writing goes it is well done; a historical background of the subject is provided and the discoverers of important phenomena are mentioned by name. There is less fanciful language than might perhaps have been expected. QUANTITATIVE BACTERIOLOGY. By H. 0. Halvorson and N. R. Ziegler. Burgess Publishing Co., Minneapolis. $I.90. ii x 82; 64; 1933 (paper). This book provides tables to aid in the solution of equations to determine the probable density of bacteria by the dilution method, the extent of infestation of insects with viruses or bacteria, or other presence- or-absence sampling problems. \,4 LEs ASTRAGALUS DU QUEBEC ET LEURS ALLIES IMMEDIATS.

The following papers are included in this publication: (i) Development of behavior patterns and myelinization of the nervous system in the human fetus and infant, by Orthello R. Langworthy. This is the concluding report of a series of observa- tions concerning the development of be- havior patterns in young animals corre- lated with one demonstrable step in the maturation of the neuron, and myeliniza- tion of the nerve-fiber. (2) Development of the vagina in the human fetus, by Arthur K. Koff.

(4) Histological studies of the men- struating mucous membrane of the human uterus, by G. W. Bartelmez. Seventeen specimens, removed at operation, are de- scribed. The study incluaes clinical data, gross examination of the mucous mem- brane, general description of the micro- scopic preparations with especial reference to the indications of a preceding pseudo- pregnancy, details concerning glandular structure, stroma elements and extravasa- tions, blood-vessels and lymphatics. (5) Early cleavage stages of the egg of the monkey (Macacus rhesus), by Warren H. Lewis and Carl G. Hartman. This account is based on four eggs obtained from the monkey (Macacus rhesus) colony of the Department of Embryology, Carnegie Institution of Washington. When re- covered one of these eggs was in the two- cell stage, two eggs were in the four-cell stage and one in the i6-cell stage. The two eggs in the four-cell stage were incu- bated to the six- and eight-cell stage. All of these papers are beautifully illus- trated and thoroughly documented. HISTOLOGY. By S. Ramon-Cajal. Revised by J. F. Tello-Mun'oZ. Authorized Translation from the Tenth Spanish Edition by M. FernJn- Nudiez. William Wood and Co., Baltimore. $8.oo. 9 x 58; xiv + 738; I933. A translation of an elementary student's textbook, written by the dean of Spanish histologists, which is widely used in Spanish-speaking universities. It presents a compendium of the investigations of the author and his disciples. The method of instruction differs markedly from that in American schools. During the first year the medical student is given a thorough foundation in cytology, its history and philosophy. The normal histologic topog- raphy of the individual organs is then taken up, along with thehisto-pathology of the same during the second year. The present volume (tenth Spanish edition) is an almost exact literal translation from the Spanish text, so that the nomenclature, phraseology and system will often appear unusual. It is the translator's hope that the reader will be inspired to investigate Spanish medical literature more deeply. The volume is well illustrated. There is an appendix dealing with method of prep- aration of materials and a detailed index. Dr. Charles H. Mayo contributes a fore- word. ,,P AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. Second Edition. By E. E. Hewer and G. M. Sandes. Wil- liam Heinemann (Medical Books), London. Si shillings net. 92 x 74; xiv + '47; I933 . This volume, in its second edition, deals in a compact and logical manner with the anatomy, and to some extent the physi- ology, of the nervous system. Both the central and autonomic systems are con- sidered. One of the most desirable features of the book is its abundance of several- colored diagrams which should be of as- sistance in orienting the student with ref- erence to his subject. Another point, worthy of praise, is the highly systematic way in which the subject matter is or- ganized. The volume is an out-and-out textbook and the author has rightlytreated the material from just that point of view. The book does not seem to be durably bound and would probably quickly show signs of wear if subjected to the rigors of the laboratory. THE HISTORY OF STAINING. By H. J. Conn, with conttibutions from Lloyd Arnold, A. F. Blakeslee, R. S. CGun- ningham, S. 1. Kornhauser, F. W. Mallory, Eugen Unna. Book Service of the Biologi- cal Stain Commission, Geneva, N. Y. $z.oo. 8' x 52; I41; I933. Much of the advance in histology and</page><page sequence="21">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 2X45 cytology during the past 75 years has been due to the staining of the structures ex- amined under the microscope. This book traces the history of the various biological stains and includes portraits and biographi- cal sketches of Sir John Hill, the first known user of dyes in microscopy, Gerlach, the father of the staining method in histo- logy, Rudolph Heidenhain, Paul Mayer, Unna, Ehrlich, Flemming, Belling and Mann. Bibliographies to the various chapters and an index are included. PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY ARTERIOSCLEROSIS. A Survey of the Problem. A Publication of The Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation. Edited by Edmund V. Cow- dry. The Macmillan Co., New York. $5.oo. 9I x 6; xvii + 617; I933. Leading American and European investi- gators have contributed to this survey of the problem of arteriosclerosis sponsored by the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation. Its purpose is to give a clearer perspective of our present knowledge of the disease and indicate which appear to be the more promising directions to follow in future research. The different aspects and phases of this roblem are outlined in the Introduction yL. Anschoff, and fully developed by the individual contributors in the chapters that follow. These include an excellent historical summary by E. Long; the de- scription of the normal anatomy and physiology of blood vessels (E. V. Cow- dry), their physical properties (C. Bram- well) and chemical constituents (A. Policard). The studies on the possible etiological factors are discussed in the chapters on the chemical changes ob- served (H. G. Wells), the influence of race and climate (P. Stocks), that of nutrition (S. Weise and G. R. Minot), of infections (W. G. MacCallum), of hered- ity (G. D. Williams), and on the relation of arteriosclerosis to hypertension (F. Lange). W. Ophiils considlers the patho- genesis in man and therapeutic measures are outlined in the paper by J. Wykoff. Available statistical data are presented by E. Sydenstricker. There are also chapters on the incidence of arterio- sclerosis in animals (H. Fox) and results of experimental work (N. Anitschow). The incidence and form which this dis- ease takes in certain regions of the body are discussed by such specialists as J. S. Friedenwald, S. Cobb, D. Blain, H. T. Kassner, and E. T. Bell. In conclusion, the universal opinion is that the work so far is too insufficient and inconclusive to answer the fundamental question of whether this disease can be avoided or remedied. \4&amp; HISTORY OF CHINESE MEDICINE. Being a Chronicle of Medical Happenings in China from Ancient Times to the Present Period. By K. Chimin Wong and Wu Lien-Teh. The Tientsin Press, Tientsin, China. $7.50. 9- x 6a; xviii + 7o6; no date. A history of Chinese medicine necessarily resolves itself into two parts. The first (PP. I-I23) is concerned with medicine as an "indigenous and mysterious art. This period extends from the ancient or legendary period (z697-II"z B.C.) through the historical or golden period (iizi B.C.-96o A.D.) and the medieval or controversial (96i-i800 A.D.). K. C. Wong, Licentiate in Medicine and Surgery, Hong Kong, is author of this section. The second part of the book (pp. I27- 595) deals with the struggles for supre- macy between the old and new forces after Western medicine was introduced into China. Wu Lien-Teh, director of Manchurian plague prevention service and of national quarantine service has written of this epoch. He points out that "To introduce bodily the medicine of Europe and America into China without atten- tion either to the traditional background or to the special needs of the masses would be as unwise as it would be unworkable. " Both sections of the volume make ex- tremely interesting reading and-will be of great value to the medical historian. Chronological tables are arranged for both parts, bibliographies, and indexes of persons and subjects. The illustrations, especially those in part one, form a valu- able feature of the book.</page><page sequence="22">Z46 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY MENTAL EFFORT in Relation to Gaseous Exchange, Heart Rate, and Mechanics of Respiration. Carnegie Institution of Wash- ington Publication No. 446. By Francis G. Benedict and Cornelia Golay Benedict. Carnegie Institution of Wash- ington, D. C. $i.oo (paper); $I.50 (cloth). io x 67; 83 + z plates; I933. Seven subjects, six men and one woman, all practically normal in every respect except that one very tall man had a basal metabolism averaging i6 per cent below normal, were used in the experiment. The investigators report that from a consideration of the various factors measured in our investigation it is concluded that sustained, intense mental effort, consisting chiefly in the multi- plication of pairs of 2 -digit figures, causes an increase in heart rate, an insignificant, hardly measurable in- crease in respiration rate, a marked alteration of the character of the respiration, a considerable increase in the apparent total ventilation of the lungs, a small increase in the carbon-dioxide exhalation, a smaller increase (on the average, 4 per cent) in the oxygen consumption and heat production, and a slight in- crease in the apparent respiratory quotient. During rest periods between the experi- ment all factors measured tended to return to original levels. During the progress of the four consecutive I5-minute periods of mental effort there was no evidence of any greater effect upon the factors measured during the latter periods than during the first periods. There was no appreciable alteration in the blood supply to the skin of the head. The conclusion is reached that mental effort per se is without significant influence upon the energy metabolism and that its study gives no direct evidence of a satis- factory explanation of the feeling of ex- treme mental and physical fatigue experi- enced by mental workers following mental effort. The report includes illustrations of the apparatus used in the experiments and iz tables of data. THE GROWTH AND GONAD-STIMULATING HORMONES OF THE ANTERIOR HYPOPHYSIS. Memoirs of the University of Californiar Volume ii. By Herbert M. Evans, Karl Meyer, and Miriam E. Simpson, in collaboration with Alexander J. Szarka, Richard 1. Pencharz, Robert E. Cornish and Frederick L. Reicbert. University of California Press, Berkeley. $IO.OO. Il4 X 94; Xii + 446 + I4 plates; I933 (paper). Fourteen more or less distinct papers make up this magnificent and admirably illus- trated quarto. The first four, comprising approximately one-half of the book, deal with the technical details of the prepara- tion, purification and biologic character- istics of the growth and the gonad-stimulat- ing hormones. The second four articles are devoted to studies on the effects of the administration of the hormones to hypophysectomized rats. The ninth paper, subdivided into four parts, con- tains brief reports of recent experimental work on the relationship between the hypophysis and adrenals. Numbers ten and eleven have to do, respectively, with the influence of the gonad-stimulating extract on the tissue metabolism of im- mature gonads and the respiratory metab- olism of rats tested with the growth hormone. The twelfth and thirteenth sections give accounts of the effect of combinations of extracts on the genital system of hypophysectomized dogs. The last, and from a philosophical point of view the most interesting paper, presents evidence that under the intluence of long continued injections of the gonad-stimu- lating fraction, achondroplastic animals (the dachshund) retain their dysplastic characteristics despite great increase in size. Although it may appear unfortunate to those not technical specialists of endo- crinology, the authors have refrained, it seems wisely, from giving a general inter- pretative summary of their work. Refer- ences are given at the end of each paper and a subject index for the whole volume is included. \9&amp; AN OUTLINE OF IMMUNITY. By W. W. C. Topley. William Wood and Co., Baltimore. $6.oo. 92 X 61; vii + 4I5; I933. A text-book designed for the advanced student in pathology, bacteriology or hygiene, or more specifically for the pre- clinical student in medicine. Immunity is defined and considered as that which is</page><page sequence="23">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS better expressed and understood as re- sistance. This idea implying variability, the author gives in the second chapter typical statistical procedures useful in immunological problems. The classical concepts, theories and terminology of the field are given in a developmental order, and they are evalu- ated in terms of up-to-date experimental procedure. By elucidating each concept with specific examples a great deal of essential technical detail is got into the text. Further clarity is gained by ex- tensive use of protocols and diagrams. The concept that segregation through heredity contributes to the variability in immunological reactions is conspicuously absent. In cases where the biological nature of the therapy is not beyond the controversial stage, as with bacteriophage and many other newly proposed techniques, the author takes an optimistic attitude and spares no labor in abstracting the best authorities. The book is carefully organized with index, chapter sub-heads and topic titles. Each chapter has a summary and an ex- tensive list of references. ROSE RESEARCH ON LYMPHADENOMA. Contributors: Sir Thomas Horder, M. H. Gordon, Kenneth Stone, Lawrence P. Gar- rod, E. R. Cullinan, B. D. Pullinger. William Wood and Co., Baltimore. $7.25. IOX 74; v + I36 + 98 plate figures. The series of papers presented in this book report the essential findings of the last four years of work of the Rose Research on Lymphadenoma. Considerably over half of the volume is devoted to Dr. M. H. Gordon's studies on the etiology of lymphadenoma or Hodgkin's disease, in which it is shown that the etiological agent is not a spirochete, the tubercle bacillus, or a mycotic organism. On the other hand highly convincing evidence is given which indicates that the true causa- tive agent is a particulate, living micro- organism of the type of the larger viruses. Other papers in the book include Sir Thomas Horder's clinical description of Hodgkin's disease; Kenneth Stone's and Lawrence Garrod's studies on the serologi- cal and morphological characteristics of the yeasts found in adenomatous glands; E. R. Cullinan' s hematological observa- tions of inoculated rabbits and guinea pigs; and B. D. Pullinger's contribution to the histology and histogenesis of the lymphoid tissues. Altogether the book is representative of the highest type of cooperative research. The cytological drawings are examples of both superl- ative medical art and excellent printing. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE CURRENTS OF ACTION AND OF INJURY DISPLAYED BY HEART MUSCLE AND OTHER EXCITABLE TIssuEs. University of Michigan Studies, Scientific Series, Volume X. By Frank N. Wilson, A. Garrard Macleod and Paul S. Barker. University of Michi- gan Press, Ann Arbor. $I.50 net. I04 X 8; vii + 59; I933. Preliminary reports dealing with this in- vestigation have been published (Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., Vol. Z7, p. 588, I930, and jour. Gen. Physiol., Vol. i6, P. 4X3, I933) but these papers did not include the discussion of currents produced by injured tissue and the intermediate stages of the mathematical treatment presented here. The starting point of this study is the proposition that the electrical relations of organs surrounded by air, as many physi- ologists have been content to study them, must differ from the relations within the body because air is a good dielectric. The purpose of this treatise is "to discuss in some detail the laws that govern the flow of electric currents in volume con- ductors; to apply them to the analysis of certain curves obtained with the string galvanometer by leading directly from the surface of the mammalian auricle and from the injured surface of the turtle's ventricle" and to explain the results in terms of the membrane theory. THE MODERN TREATMENT OF SYPHILIS. By Joseph E. Moore. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, Ill. $s.oo postpaid. 97 x 64; x + 535; 1933-</page><page sequence="24">2.48 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY This volume satisfies a great need in medical literature. Written by an out- standing clinician it gives in clear and precise terms the therapeutic measures found most effective in the different types of syphilis. The general practitioner, for whom it is intended, will find its fundamental empiricism a relief from the vagueness of theoretical textbooks. While the author does not neglect the philo- sophical theories, and, in fact, gives an adequate exposition of them, he emphasizes particularly the practical aspects and de- rives his conclusions almost wholly from his long experience at the head of one of the largest clinics in the country. The statistics presented to justify these con- clusions are impressive, but, in our opin- ion, would carry greater conviction if the data comprised a larger sample of the vast material collected. In the human biologist especial interest is aroused by the author's comments on the social and personal aspects of the disease, which really deserve further amplification and should be brought to the attention of the layman. TRAITE DE PHYSIOLOGIE NORMALE ET PA- THOLOGIQUE. Tome 1. Physiologie Generale. By L. Ambard, M. Arthus, E. Bachrach, A. Blanchetiere, H. Cardot, A. Chevallier, A. Lacassagne, A. Policard, G-H. Roger, J. Verne, F. VTes. Published under the direction of G.-H. Roger and Leon Binet. Masson et Cie, Paris. I65 francs. 98 x 68; xvi + II40; I933. It is not likely that this introduction to general physiology will fulfill the expec- tation of its editor and "enhance the prestige of French science." The col- laborators in this enterprise have written with considerable literary skill of the general status of their several fields of knowledge and have pointed out certain unsolved problems but they are rather hazy about just what has actually been found out, particularly when the work has been done outside of France. The best section is a survey of biochemistry by Blanchetiere which takes up about half the book, and is the only section accom- panied by an adequate bibliography. Besides this, there are general surveys of chemical physiology and physical chem- istry, and a number of chapters that seem to have been included because they did not belong in any other of the eleven volumes of this treatise. There is no index. BEHIND THE DOCTOR. By Logan Clendening. Alfred A. Knzopf, New York. $3.75 net. 94 x 61; xxxii + 458; I933. This histoire romance6e of medicine is excel- lent and, within its limits, very accurate. The scrupulosity of the author is such that he has added an appendix to indicate the points where he has given free play to his imagination or where the authen- ticity of the historical source is doubtful. The author's intention is to give the lay- man an understanding of the discoveries which have contributed to the present state of medical knowledge and practice. To accomplish this in an entertaining manner he considers these discoveries in terms of the individuals whose investi- gations have directly or indirectly led to them. With rare literary skill he de- scribes their personalities, physical and spiritual, their environments, and the means by which they achieved their goals. Of the many recent popular books on medical history this is without a doubt one of the best. LA DUALISME DE LA CONTRACTION CARDIA- QUE. Recherches Expe'rimentales du Labo- ratoire de The'rapeutique de l'Universite' de Liege. By F. Henrijean. Masson et Cie, Paris. so francs. 91 x 61; xi + 350; I933 (paper). In this posthumous publication of the eminent Belgian physiologist are recorded the ultimate theories derived from his investigations on the nature of the heart beat. Special emphasis is placed on the fact that in certain conditions spontaneous</page><page sequence="25">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS contractions and formation of the rhythmi- cal electrical phenomena of the heart per- sist after death. Also, experiments on the effects of chloroform, ether, and vari- ations in the quantity of the sodium, calcium, or potassium ions on the cardiac functions as observed with electrocardio- grams lead the author to reject the possi- bility that the myogenic or neurogenic theories alone can explain the character of the cardiac contraction. The compli- cated picture which he presents cannot be here described but in the reviewer's opinion warrants further investigation. LES REACTIONS DU Tissu PULMONAIRE DANS LA TUBERCULOSE. Etude Exp6erimentale et Interpre6tation. (Substratum Anatomo-Patho- logique de l'Ptat d'Allergie). By E. Leuret and J. Caussimon. Masson et Cie, Paris. 30 francs. 91 x 64; iv + 85; I933 (paper). This is one of a series of studies on tuber- culosis undertaken under the direction of Professor Leon Bernard. Experimental work on rabbits leads the authors to the view that in pulmonary lesions the im- portant factor relative to the outcome is the reaction of the tissues to the causa- tive foreign elements. The elimination of these elements they observe follows a simple scheme. This is evidently not so in human tuberculosis. They explain this departure from the simplicity of reaction on the basis that the follicular lesions are caused by more or less temporary fixation of tubercle bacilli, so that, in the evolu- tion of the disease there is formation of polymorphic lesions due to alternating fxation and elimination. THE NEW DENTISTRY. A Phase of Preven- tive Medicine. Six Lowell Lectures. By Leroy M. S. Miner. Harvard Uni- versity Press, Cambridge. $2.oo. 71 x 48; II9; 1933. The development of dentistry as a modern science is outlined in an interesting and readable form. Archeological evidence of dentistry is reviewed; the crude as well as clever craftmanship of historical ages is pointed out; and the discussion of the re- placement of mechanical dental procedure by a broad knowledge derived from bi- ological research makes up the major part of the book. Although the style is that of the popular lecture, the thoroughly scientific outlook of the author is always evident. The book can be recommended as a worthy appeal for unbiased programs of research in all phases of biology. LES PREMATURES. I. Physiologie du Pre'ma- ture, by H. Vignes. II. Etude Clinique et Therapeutique, by G. Blechmann. Masson et Cie, Paris. to francs. 7A x 5-8; i6?; I933 (paper). The physiological inferiority of the pre- mature infant is described by Dr. H. Vignes in the first part of this book. He observes that the probability of survival is dependent upon the degree of prema- turity, the absence of birth trauma, and the absence of congenital disease. In the second part, Dr. Blechmann discusses the clinical measures and therapy that aid a normal adaptation to extra-uterine life. It is written in concise style and the review of the literature is excellent. PROBLEMES THEORIQUES ET PRATIQUES DE LA TRANSFUSION SANGUINE. Dix Lefons: In- dications. Groupes Sanguins. Accidents. Technique. Organisation. Hemothe6rapie. Phylactotransfusion. Immunotransfusion. By Arnault TZanck. Masson et Cie, Paris. 35 francs. 98 x 68; ziz; I933 (paper). The author appears to have covered pretty thoroughly in this handbook the work of the French on blood transfusion. The material is divided into ten sections covering the ground indicated in the title. It includes a discussion of transfusion from cadaver to living man, and ends with z8 aphorisms. The bibliography of three pages is confined to French items, mostly by the author and his co-workers in the hospitals of Paris.</page><page sequence="26">s50 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY OUR COMMON ENEMY: COLDS.

The good old remedy, "rest in bed," still seems to be the best measure, not only to cure a cold, but to prevent its spread to other victims. The book was published too early to mention the encouraging results found by Diehl from the use of codein and papav- erin. The second part of the book gives an amusing description of the business of advertising and selling cold remedies. DIET AND DENTAL HEALTH. By Milton T. Hanke. University of Chi- cago Press, Chicago. $4.00. 9 X 6; xi + 236; I933. With the financial assistance of the Cali- fornia Fruit Growers Exchange, the author and the Chicago Dental Research Club (an organization of twelve practicing dentists) are able to present in this book convincing evi'dence that in the majority of growing children gingivitis may be prevented and cured, and dental caries may be arrested and prevented, by the daily addition of one pint of orange juice to an otherwise adequate diet. The book is not well written and includes much that is superfluous; its value is greatly en- hanced by the inclusion of a series of beautiful color photographs and an ap- pendix of seriatim observations for a three- year period of the oral status of 400 children.

Carpenter contributes two very readable articles, one on the history of the measurement of the gaseous products of metabolism and heat production in man, in which the principles underlying the measurement are explained nicely; and one on the interpretation of such' data. J. R. Murlin discusses the work done on carbohydrate metabolism in his labora- tory; J. B. Brown reviews fat metabolism briefly; W. C. Rose discusses the nutri- tional significance of amino acids; E. B. Forbes has a chapter on mineral metab- olism; and G. M. Curtis rounds off the collection with a paper principally de- voted to the iodine-goiter problem. The whole series makes a convenient introduc- tion to the field for anyone who has had a year or two of chemistry. VW&gt; STARLING'S PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN PHYSI- OLOGY. Sixth Edition.

Dickinson. The Williams t Wilkins Co., Baltimore. $io.oo. Ii!2 x 9; xiii + I45 + I75 figures; I933. This magnificently produced volume is a monument to its author's indefatigable diligence, his love of details, and his skill as a draftsman. It is an encyclopedic atlas of sex in all its aspects, physiological, behavioristic and psychological, as well as anatomical. It is based primarily upon Dr. Dickinson's literally enormous experience as a practicing gynecologist and secondarily upon his wide knowledge of the medical literature of sex in the human species. There are I33 pages of text, divided into nine chapters and a bibliography. These chapters have to do successively with: Purpose and methods; the bony pelvis; uterus, ovaries and tubes; the vagina; the vulva and breast; male genital anatomy; the anatomy of coitus; the anatomy and control of conception; conclusion and program. The remaining and much larger half of the book consists of some I75 plates, arranged on the same plan as the text. All of these plates have</page><page sequence="28">151 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY some value; some of them are superb, better than anything hitherto existing; some we regret to say are so crowded and/or so badly arranged as to be merely confusing to the reader. Altogether this is a remarkable book, that will for a long time be found useful as a reference work. There is a detailed index, and a fairly extensive though by no means complete bibliography. One wonders, to take a single example, at the absence of citation of a book having a similar purpose, point of view and man- ner of treatment, also illustrated with beautiful if not too precisely accurate quarto plates in color, which appeared over 8o years ago-the Histoire de la generation de /'homme by Grimaud de Caux and Martin Saint-Ange. Dr. Dickinson is an enthusiast and a crusader, trying in his very effective way to make this world a better place to live in by increasing our knowledge about sex. His books are always interesting and stimulating. And no one realizes more clearly than he the incompleteness and deficiencies of his work. Of the present volume he says that it is "a mere sketchbook, a beginning." Some day it will doubtless be followed by a much duller but more systematically thorough treatise. In the meantime every student of the subject will be sincerely grateful to Dr. Dickinson for what he has done. BIRTH CONTROL IN PRACTICE. Analysis of Ten Thousand Case Histories of the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau. Text and Tables by Marie E. Kopp. Pre- pared under the Supervision of a Scientific Advisory Committee. Robert M. McBride and Co., New York. $3.75 net. 8- x 54 290; I934. Ten thousand cases from Margaret Sang- er's Birth Control Clinic in New York City form the basis for this book. Ac- cording to the preface the report was pre- pared under the supervision of a Scientific Advisory Committee by Marie E. Kopp. There is a vast amount of material and detail which does not always make easy and connected reading but is clear and understandable. The book is divided into five sections dealing with sources and methods of collection, sociological and economic factors, physiological factors, indications for the postponement of con- ception, and a summary. The statistical treatment is extremely simple, consisting almost entirely of per- centages of this and that together with a few averages, medians, and modes. No analysis of the variation of the material in a statistical sense is attempted. There are many tables (8i in fact) given in the body of the text besides 50 master tables in small type given in the appendix. There are many interesting data presented here. Ninety-three per cent are said to have used what they believed to be con- traceptives before they applied to the clinic for help. Four per cent had never been pregnant while 6 per cent had prac- tically complete families. The latter group averaged six pregnancies aPiece. Sixty per cent of the Io,ooo were listed as having "general medical disorders." The results in various respects are not in accord with the data from more carefully and scientifically controlled clinics. WOMAN'S PERIODICITY. By Mary Chadwick. Noel Douglas, Lon- don. 6 shillings. 74 x 487; z28; I933. This book begins with a short survey of the customs, beliefs and taboos connected with menstruation and then attempts to trace where possible the various ways in which these have been handed down to the present day, trying to show how they survive actually in curious superstitions that still obtain among civilized peoples, exercising an even more powerful influence upon their lives from recesses among the deeper structures of the mind of both men and women. From these hiding-places they may be found to originate strange ideas, dreams, phantasies, and symptoms, that assume exaggerated prominence during the menstrual period. The content and general tone of the book follow in the main the author's earlier work The Psychological Effects of Menstruation, noticed with scepticism in this REVIEW (Vol. 8, p. iz5).</page><page sequence="29">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS LA DUREE DE LA GROSSESSE ET SES ANOMALIES. By Henri Vignes. Masson et Cie, Paris. I5 francs 734x 58; 97; I933 (paper). An elementary but comprehensive survey of the variability in the duration of preg- nancy. The distinguished author is ad- mittedly here preoccupied by the question: "Doctor, when shall I be delivered?" In this review of the many investigations on the subject he attempts to show how absurd it is to make a definite prediction. Moreover, he points out that if the facts do not bear out the prediction, the strain of expectation may have grave psycho- logical effects on the pregnant woman. This observation is expressed with a tone of sarcasm towards the modern woman and illustrated by his own experiences with patients for whom delay interferedc with social or other amusements! SEX HABITS. A Vital Factor in Well- Being. By A. Buschke and F. Jacobsohn. Trans- lated from the German by Eden and Cedar Paul. Emerson Books, New York. $2.50. 3 x 3 74 X8; 204; I933. A commendable contribution to rational sex education translated into clear and simple English. The chapters dealing with the anatomy of reproduction are well illustrated and the physiological in- formation is thoroughly scientific. At least half of the volume is given to dis- cussion of the social aspects of sex rela- tive to marriage, heredity, hygiene and many other topics contributory to indi- vidual sex sanity. BIOMETRY OUTLINES OF BIOMETRIC ANALYSIS. Part 1. Revised Edition. By Alan E. Treloar. Burgess Publishing Co., Minneapolis. $I.65. ii x 82; 65; I933 (paper). This outline was prepared for use in the author's course in Biometric Principles at the University of Minnesota. The method of presentation was developed in large part by the late Professor J. Arthur Harris. The subjects treated are centering constants, dispersion, the normal curve, the binomial series, the x2 criterion, cor- relation and regression, and errors of random sampling. The treatment is clear and the doctrine in general sound, espe- cially in its emphasis on statistical pit- falls. However, the standard deviation of a Poisson series is equal, not to the mean, as the author states, but to the square root of the mean. MATHEMATICAL FACTS AND PROCESSES PRE- REQUISITE TO THE STUDY 0QF THE CALCULUS. Teachers College, Columbia University, Con- tributions to Education, No. 572. Published with the Approval of Prof. Clifford B. Upton, Sponsor. By William H. Fagerstrom. Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, Columbhia University, New York. $I.5O. 9 X vii + 68; I933. Since one of the important functions of high school mathematics is the prepara- tion of the student for the study of calculus in his college work, the author has an- alyzed the problems in Granville, Smith and Longley's Elements of the Differential and Integral Calculus to see how much of what has been taught the student in high school is actually used in his calculus course. He concludes that part of the time spent on advanced algebra and trig- onometry might better be given to analytic geometry. PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR RACE PSYCHOLOGY.

He also includes much of his own work. All the data are tabulated in such form as to be readily compre- hended. So much work of a preliminary character remains to be done in this new field that many sections of the book are merely discussions of future lines of prof- itable study. Three pertinent facts are emphasized in the summary. (i) Selec- tion operates in man as well as elsewhere. "One race of men may profit by the opera- tion of selection, either natural or arti- ficial, while another may not." "That is, through selection one trait may be em- phasized in one and not in another, though both possess the trait in common." (z) The races of men are mobile. "What we call races are merely temporary eddies in the history of humankind in which com- mon human traits-at least somatological traits, if not mental traits-have become emphasized. Removal of the barriers causing the eddies causes the emphasis to dissolve in the common racial stream." (3) Nurture changes native traits. "Much of the difference found in the results of studies of racial differences in mental traits is due to differences in nurtural factors and the rest is due to racial mo- bility, so that one race has a temporary advantage over another." The work con- tains a lengthy bibliography and an ap- pendix giving a description of experi- mental and statistical studies in race psychology. There are author and sub- ject indices. R. S. Woodworth contrib- utes a foreword. HUMAN MENTALITY in the Light of Psy- chiatric Experience. An Outline of General Psychiatry. By Bror Gadelius. Levin und Munks- gaard, Copenhagen. Dan. Cr. 33. 94 x 64; 6zo; I933. This translation of a revised and enlarged edition of parts I and II, together forming an independent volume, of a Swedish text- book is intended as a general guide to psychology as well as psychiatry. The book opens with a brief historical survey of psychiatric theories and practice and the care of the insane, and a consideration of epistemological viewpoints. Sections follow treating the functional structure of mental life and its morbid changes, the genetic and exogenous causes .of mental disease, and treatment. The author's ap- proach is predominantly psychological, and he little more than glides over the morbid anatomy. However, he discusses at length the role of the endocrine glands and the vegetative nervous system in mental disorder. Gadelius apparently has little use for Freudian doctrines and includes a chapter on psychoanalysis merely because as I have desired to maintain the extreme importance of psychotherapy in every form of mental suffering, I have found it advisable in view of the great influ- ence exercised by the Freudian doctrines, and the impress of dogmatic one sidedness they have imparted to the theory and practice of medical treatment, to subject psychoanalysis to a critical examination. Although the book will scarcely be found suitable as a textbook for beginners in this country, it will be valuable to advanced students who wish to become better acquainted with the views of Euro- pean psychiatrists. Bibliographies are appended to the separate chapters. The index is not very adequate. A SURVEY OF THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY. By J. R. Kantor. The Principia Press, Bloomington, Ind. $3.75 postpaid. 9 x 6; xvii + 5 64; I93 3 . Kantor takes the view that all psycho- logical phenomena must be described as part of the activities of an entire organism engaged in preserving a balance among its own numerous processes and in responding to the influences of the environment in such a way as to preserve its totality. Accordingly, his treatment may be classi- fied as organismic. The distinctive fea- ture of the book is the large number of separate fields of human biology which are surveyed in order to provide a basis for a complete description of a psycho- logical organism. There are chapters on human anatomy and physiology, brief re- views of the fundamentals of genetics and development, and in connection with the</page><page sequence="31">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS discussion of man's ecological relation- ships there are two chapters on human races and the means by which they can be studied. It is written as a textbook for college students, with the numerous chapter subheadings and subdivisions usu- ally considered appropriate, and it ought to be a good book for college students to be exposed to. In addition to explaining the principles of psychology, the way in which they have been worked out, and the nature of the problems now under study, in an interesting and frequently original way there are a good many pro- vocative introductions to ideas on other subjects as well. For instance, "Free thinking is a rarity. Freedom of thought, in the ordinary sense of the word, merely means that we are not prevented by some particular group from thinking the way some other group does." There are 45 pages of literature references to other textbooks and to recent articles in the standard psychological journals classified according to subject matter, and an ex- cellent index. THE BLIND IN SCHOOL AND SOCIETY. A Psychological Study. By Thomas D. Cutsforth. D. Appleton- Century Co., New York. $z.5o. 8 x 5` xvii + z63; I933 Dr. Cutsforth, Instructor in Psychology in the University of Kansas, in this book tells us what is wrong with the present system of education for the blind, and gives sug- gestions for corrective measures. To use a simile of the author's, teachers generally liken a blind child to a six-cylinder auto- mobile with one cylinder missing, rather than one with a five-cylinder engine "or- ganized to function perfectly upon his level of sensory equipment." They there- fore think that "his education must not only be education, but must also supply the missing power and also make the car sound as if it really were hitting on six cylinders. " Tests made on children in schools for the blind showed that more often than not the children employ visual concepts when other sensory ones are just as avail- able and much more meaningful to them. Like. most pupils the blind are prone to give the answer expected of them by the teacher to make a passing grade. The author, of course, makes no objection to teaching the use of visual symbolism to the blind, so long as no attempt is made to discredit their own meaningful sensory experience. he thesis that the conventional edu- cation given the blind leads to verbal, in- tellectual and esthetic hypocrisy, as well as to psychological and social maladjust- ments, is carefully argued, convincingly written and illustrated with numerous case histories. The book is a noteworthy contribution to the psychology of the blind, and should not be neglected by those concerned in their education. A glossary, bibliography, an appendix of "problems for further study" and an index are provided. A HUNDRED YEARS OF PSYCHOLOGY. i833- I933 . By J. C. Flugel. The Macmillan Co., New York. $3.75. 82 X 5 384; I933. This stimulating and well written book is the first of a series designed to trace the histoty of the various sciences during the past hundred years. After a survey of psychology as it existed a hundred years ago, a time when its close connection with physiology, and its possible practical applications, especially in education and the study of mental disease, were begin- ning to be realized, Professor Flugel di- vides his century into three parts, I833- i86o, I860-I900, and I900-I933. In the first of these periods the tendencies already noted continued to develop. The second period is characterized by the growth of experimental psychology and of the evolu- tionary point of view consequent on Darwin's Origin of Species. In the third period "we find psychology embarking on the process of specialization incidental to the growth of new schools, each school having its own peculiar methods and out- look and even to a considerable extent its own peculiar jargon." The description of the various schools and their work gives the reader a clear and vivid picture of the progress of psychology in the past</page><page sequence="32">THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY three decades. In particular, the chapter on Freud is one of the best brief exposi- tions of psychoanalysis that we have found. Flugel emphasizes especially the sociological importance of Freud's work on the super-ego. Only by realizing the archaic and irrational character of the morality that the super-ego imposes can we hope to evolve a more reasonable and humane morality. The book contains a bibliography of ten pages, a chronological table of events in the history of modern psychology, and author and subject indexes. THE NATURE oF HUMAN CONFLICTS, or Emotion, Conflict and Will. An Objective Study of Disorganisation and Control of Human Behaviour. By A. R. Luria. Translated from the Russian and edited by W. Horsley Gantt. Liveright Publishing Corp., New York. $4.00. 88 x 5; XVii + 43I; I93Z. Here are presented the results of an experi- mental psychological investigation on the disorganization and control of human be- havior. The ingenious method of routine investigation records, in relation to time and form, the individual motor and speech reactions to spoken stimuli. Thus, ac- cording to the author, is reflected "the whole dynamic character of the central neurodynamic process of the attention." In the first part, on psychophysiology of the affective processes, are illustrated the abnormal reactions associated with various forms of emotion. These lead to the conclusion that "marked disturbances in the motor system occur every time the movements fall directly into the sphere of affect" and this is attributed to the fact that "the cortical apparatus is not in a condition to dominate the masses of excitation in the affect." In the second and third parts of this volume the author seeks to determine the mode of action and genesis of the con- flicting processes which cause the ab- normal neurodynamic reactions. This he attempts to determine by the creation of artificial conflicts, observations on hys- terical patients, etc., and especially in the study of the development of behavior from childhood to adult age. This work is an outstanding contribu- tion to psychology. HYPNOSIS AND SUGGESTIBILITY. An Experi- mental Approach. By Clark L. Hull. D. Appleton-Century Co., New York. $3.75. 84 X 5x8; xii + 4I6; I933 . The primary purpose of this treatise is to make available to the general public the results of a program of experimental re- search on the problems of hypnosis carried out in Professor Hull's laboratory at Yale over a period of about ten years. In do- ing this the author has correlated and integrated this work with that of others reported in the literature. The net result is a useful and significant presentation of the whole subject, viewed from a rigidly objective experimental standpoint. The author has no illusion about the extra- ordinary difficulties and complexities in- herent in the phenomena of hypnosis and suggestibility. He says: These difficulties are so great that to enter seriously on a program of investigation in this field is a little like tempting fate; it is almost to court scientific disaster. Small wonder that orthodox scientists have usually avoided the subject! Yet each generation may be expected in the future, as in the past, to pro- duce a very few rash souls who will not only risk the dangers of making scientific errors but will also have the courage to brave the semi-superstitious fears of the general public and the uneasy suspicions of their orthodox scientific brethren. It is to them that the present work,is really addressed. The author concludes as the net general result of his study that hypnosis is merely a quantitative upward shift in suscepti- bility to suggestion, differing only quanti- tatively and not qualitatively from the normal waking state. Specifically he is of the opinion that no phenomenon can be produced in the hypnotic state that cannot in lesser degree be produced in the normal waking condition. The book is well organized and written, abundantly and significantly illustrated, and provided with adequate bibliogra- phies and indices.</page><page sequence="33">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF FACTORS IN- FLUENCING CONSONANCE JUDGMENTS. A Study from the Psychological Laboratory of Vanderbilt University. Psychological Mono- graphs, Vol. XLV, No. 2. Whole No. 20I. By Eugene G. Bugg. Psychological Review Co., Princeton, N.J. $I.50. 95 x 61; vi + IOO; 1933 (paper). Although the problem of the consonance of musical tones has been under discussion since the days of Pythagoras there is no general agreement as to the nature of the phenomenon. Some have regarded judg- ments of consonance as cognitive in char- acter while others have held them to be essentially judgments of pleasantness or unpleasantness. On the basis of his ex- periments the author of this monograph concludes that comparative judgments of consonance are comnplex phenomena, which are often influenced by the affective quality of the intervals, but that consonance and affective quality are not synonymous. When subjects were given a single criterion by which to judge the relative consonance of two intervals their judgments in repeated tests were more consistent than when they used several criteria. The gross score ob- tained for the Seashore Consonance Test is, the author concludes, of little value. There is a bibliography of 3I titles. THE SUPERNORMAL. A Critical Introduc- tion to Psychic Science. By G. C. Barnard. Rider aznd Co., London. 7s. 6d. net. 8l x 5!; Z56 I933. "Supernormal," according to theauthor, "does not imply any more than that the phenomena in question are highly unusual, and take place underconditionsand through agencies of whose nature we are ignorant. " This book aims to study scientifically what is known "unquestionably" of psychic science. We feel sure that the author has achieved his aim since he explains many of the supernormnal events as happening along the fourth ditnension-which surely is scientific! In several places and connect- ions, we are warned that the only way to prove supernormal occurrences is by being symnpathetic with the medium. Attempting to seize ectoplasm is taboo. The fourth dimension, the subconscious, ectoplasm and other equally natural (?) explanations are regarded as sufficient without having re- course to spiritualism. MODERN MAN IN SEARCH OF A SOUL. By C. G. Jung. Harcourt, Brace and Co., New York. $3.00. 84 x 54; ix + 181; I933. The theme that recurs again and again in this collection of essays bythe distinguished Swiss psychotherapist is that, while the purely intellectual are served up to modern man by science turns out not to be an ade- quate diet, the neat packages labeled spiri- tual food which are marketed by the churches prove to be equally deficient in vitamins. Jung is therefore disposed to turn to the mysticism of the East as a richer source of spiritual sustenance. Among other interesting essays are those in which he explains his psychological theory of types and the differences between his view- point and that of Freud. SOME EXPERIMENTS IN FOUR-DIMENSIONAL VISION. By Geoffrey Hodson and Alexander Horne. Rider and Co., London. 6 shillings net. 84 X 8; xxv + II7; I933. Mr. Hodson used his faculty of clairvoyant vision in performing five experiments of looking into and through solids, and Mr. Horne did most of the writing-up. The section on results, positive and negative, winds up with the cogent remark: "What Mr. Hodson did see, however, has greater significance than what he failed to see-to some sceptical minds, perhaps greater significance because he failed to sat- isfy all expectations." We cannot help wondering what Mr. Hodson would have seen on that face of a cube which was held away from him, without Mr. Horne to ask him such ques- tions as "Can you see the number I3?"

The Viking Press, New York. $2.75. 8-1 x 53; v + 307; 1933. Present day science, Mr. Sullivan concludes, being concerned only with the metrical aspects of phenomena, does not give a complete account of the universe. Biology and psychology in particular have not yet developed concepts adequate to their most important problems. -Purpose and values are left out of their subject matter, although science itself is inspired by the value of the disinterested search for truth. It is very probable, as Whitehead maintains, that the notion of particle will have to be replaced by the notion of organism. In order to avoid a break of continuity the notions of physics will have to be en- riched, and this enrichment will come from biology. We can look forward to a further synthesis. The science of mind, at present in such a rudimentary state, will one day take control. In the service of'the prin- ciple of continuity its concepts will be extended throughout the whole of nature. Only so will sci- ence reach the unity towards which it is aiming, and the differences between the sciences of mind and matter, in their present form, will be seen to be unreal. LA SCIENCE FRAN?AISE DEPUIS LE XVIIe SIECLE. By Maurice Caullery. Armand Colin, Paris. IO.5ofrancs. 8 X4X93; 2I5; I933 (paper). This excellent brief history of French sci- ence since the days of Descartes was orig- inally delivered as a series of lectures at the Museum of French Art in New York. Although himself a biologist, Professor Caullery does not neglect physics and chemistry and their technical applications. The essentially positive character of the French mind, he concludes, has saved it from the tendency to construct grandiose edifices of theory upon a slender founda- tion of facts so characteristic of German science, but has somnetimes discouraged the formation of working hypotheses that might have led to new lines of experitnent. There is a bibliography of four pages and an index of namnes. THE ROMANCE OF RESEARCH. By L. V. Redman and A. V. H. Mory. The Williams &amp; Wilkins Co., Baltimore. $i.oo. 1 74 x 5; x + I49; I933. In this number of the Century of Progress Series two industrial research chemists trace the dependence of our modern material culture on research in physics and chemistry. In these days of technological unemnployment there is a growing feeling that the changes brought about by research are in danger of wrecking our social structure. The authors, however, conclude that what is needed is not less research in the physical sciences but mnore research in the social sciences. LA PHILOSOPHIE SCIENTIFIQUE. Vues Nou- velles sur ses Buts et ses Methodes. Actualites Scientifiques et Industrielles XLIX. By Hans Reichenbach. Translated from the German by Ernest Vouillemin. Hermann et Cie, Paris. io francs. io x 6-; 4Z; 1932 (paper). This interesting book deals briefly with the effect upon philosophy of modern scientific research. Kant's conclusion that space and time are mental categories antecedent to experience goes into the discard along with final causes and vitalism. Statistical regularities replace causal connections, and this change may eventually lead to the solu- tion of the old problem of free will.</page></plain_text>
