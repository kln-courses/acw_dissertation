<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ORIENTAL INSTITUTE ARCHEOLOGICAL REPORT ON THE NEAR EAST FIRST QUARTER, 1937 [With this issue each Oriental Institute Archeological Report ceases to be the work of any one individual and becomes a collaborative enterprise under- taken by various members of the Oriental Institute staff, each in his own field. Thus may be assured greater acquaintance of each compiler with the material he treats, and therefore more accurate preparation. In this report George R. Hughes is chiefly responsible for Egypt and Nubia; Robert M. Engberg for Arabia, Palestine, Transjordan, Syria, and Cyprus; Waldo H. Dubberstein for Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, the U.S.S.R., and India. Other members of the Institute staff who actively par- ticipated are: R. A. Bowman, R. J. Braidwood, G. G. Cameron, S. I. Feigin, I. J. Gelb, R. S. Hardy, C. W. McEwan, C. F. Nims, R. A. Parker, and A. von R. Sauer. In these reports we are striving for the greatest possible degree of complete- ness and accuracy; and we request help of all our readers, especially of the people responsible for archeological research and discovery. We are trying to help them in their work, and we can do so most effectively only if they will help us make this in the widest sense a co-operative effort. Directors or other contributors please take note: Only communications received by the fifteenth of January, April, July, or October can appear in the following April, July, October, or January numbers, respectively. We earnestly solicit your correc- tions as well as your contributions, which may be addressed to the editors of the Journal.-AssISTANT EDITOR.] For Chabot's report on the status of the Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum project see Comptes rendus, October-December, 1936, pp. 247 ff.

University of Turin Excavations were resumed the past winter and spring. Among the Old Kingdom burials discovered were two of the First Dynasty, roofed with tamarisk trunks, and another of the same period covered with tamarisk planks. Most of the tombs had a walled-up side chamber. A Fifth Dynasty tomb had a shaft 5 meters deep divided by strong boards into two nearly equal parts. It contained two coffins in the upper part and one below. Near by was a large tomb with a facade of eight pillars and con- sisting of a large central chamber and various storerooms. Chicago Daily News, May 1, 1937. Cairo. Department of Antiquities In January, 1937, a rock-cut shaft tomb was found in the quarry called Batn el-Baqara in Old Cairo. It contained a hard limestone sarcophagus 4 meters long, 2.40 meters broad, and 1.15 meters high. The finely carved in- scriptions on the lid gave the name and titles of the deceased, a high official of the late period, Pa-wn-hatef. Despite the size of the sarcophagus, the mummiform coffin within it was scarcely larger than a body. Notwithstand-</page><page sequence="3">258 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES ing a groove 2 centimeters deep in the underside of the lid, into which fitted a corresponding projection on the sarcophagus, the heavy lid had been partial- ly removed and the contents stolen. Halfway along each of the four sides of the sarcophagus was a stone box, probably intended to receive a canopic jar. Among the objects in the debris was a good collection of faience amulets of excellent workmanship. Egyptian Gazette, February 17, 1937. (Edfu). L'Institut Franqais d'Archeologie Orientale and University of Warsaw The upper part of the mounds comprising this site west of the temple of Horus are covered with the ruins of the Roman town. Below these are houses of the Ptolemaic period, and at the bottom of the hill, 20 meters lower, are the remains of the Old Kingdom necropolis. Among the Roman ruins, two complete bathrooms furnished with stone baths and hot-water equipment were discovered. Nine untouched burials were found in the Old Kingdom necropolis. The oldest is that of Pepi-nefer, a noble of Edfu under Pepi I and Mernere I. The dead were laid, not in sarcophagi, but on the floor of the underground chambers, surrounded by funerary equipment of red pottery. Among the finest objects in these tombs were a large alabaster vase bearing the name of king Teti and an inscribed alabaster headrest. ILN, March 6, 1937, p. 403. (Gizeh).

Department of Antiquities The expedition led by W. B. Emery made several important discoveries during the clearance of the tomb of Sabu, a noble of the First Dynasty under King Enezib Merpeba. Sabu's title was "Ruler in the King's Heart"; his existence has been known since 1900, when Petrie found jar sealings bearing his seal at Abydos. Though dated to the latter part of the First Dynasty, the tomb conforms to a design hitherto considered the early type of noble's tomb, that of the so- called "tomb of Menes" at Nagadah. It consists of a large pit cut in the natural rock and divided by thick walls of mud brick into seven separate rooms. These rooms vary in size, six smaller ones being used for storage and a large central one for the burial. Surrounding the pit was a thick inclosure wall of brick, 29.75 meters by 12.15 meters, decorated with the usual "palace fa-ade" paneling, which was originally covered with plaster and painted white. After the interment the pit was roofed with wooden crossbeams and planks, remains of which were found in position; and sand was used to cover the roof and fill in the inclosure wall, probably with layers of brickwork on top. Clearance of the tomb began at the north end. The first two rooms found were undisturbed and contained a large number of wine jars sealed with the names of Sabu and Enezib Merpeba. A third contained pottery bowls and dishes and the bones of sides of beef. The three remaining storerooms were empty, having been plundered. Of greater importance were the finds in the burial chamber itself. The excavators believe that for the first time in Egyptian archeology the body of a First Dynasty noble was here found lying in the position in which it was placed at burial, although the right arm and head had been separated from the trunk by the plunderers. The skeleton lay on the floor in a flexed position on its right side with the head to the north. Traces of a wooden coffin were found about the body. There was no trace of mummification. Owing to the tomb's location on the extreme edge of the cliff, it had been frequently inun- dated; and the water had powdered the woodwork, destroyed any wrapping which may have been on the body, and made the bones very fragile. Near the left hand was a group of copper toilet instruments, and beside the body lay the scattered fragments of a unique stone vessel. When reas- sembled, it was found to consist of a circular piece of stone called chisite about 63 centimeters in diameter. It is likened by the excavators to the steering wheel of a car in shape and size. There are three broad spokes, and the spaces between them have a kind of inverted petal protruding from the rim of the spokes and almost covering them. In the center is a small circular projection.</page><page sequence="5">260 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES In the burial chamber there were also the remains of two wooden boxes containing quantities of small flint knives and scrapers; and scattered over the floor were fragments of carved ivory boxes, reed arrows with bone points, and fragments of stone vessels. The eastern area of the room contained a large collection of vases and bowls of alabaster and schist. This collection should be of considerable value inasmuch as it contains a wide variety of types dat- able to a single reign of the First Dynasty. As a result of this and other excavations of the last two seasons, there seems little doubt that North Sakkarah was the burial place of the nobility and higher officials of the reigns, at least of Za, Udymu (Den), and Enezib.

Department of Antiquities Reports have appeared of the recent discovery by Selim Hassan of a shaft immediately behind the false door of Demed in the west wall of the pillared court of the tomb of Ti. The shaft leads to a tomb which was said to be that of Demed. However, a later report states that the burial place of Demed was not found. The new tomb is undecorated, according to the later report; and the furnishings are comparatively mediocre, consisting, for the most part, of small votive alabaster vessels and small copper implements. New York Times, April 16, 1937; London Times, April 16 and 23, 1937. The clearing of Gallery VII under the Step Pyramid was completed in the 1935-36 season, and the fragments of some twenty-five thousand stone vases were removed. Many of them bear inscriptions engraved or written in ink. Among the cut inscriptions there appeared on a small porphyry bowl the r?r of Narmer; and on a large cup of blue schist was a list of the last four kings of the First Dynasty: Hesepti, Merpeba, Semsu, and Ka. Two clay stoppers with significant seal impressions were found, one bear- ing the Brh of Khasekhemui and the other that of Neterkhet (Zoser). Work on Gallery IX led to the discovery and clearing of two new galleries to its south. Annales du Service des Antiquitls, XXXVI, Fasc. 1 (1936), 20 ff.

Department of Antiquities Jequier reports further clearing, restoration, and copying done on the funerary temple and tomb chamber of Pepi II. Pursuance of traces of a pavement on the east face of the lower portico of the temple resulted in the discovery of a terrace 100 meters long. It is closed on the west by a wall which continues from the facade of the portico. A parapet, originally reached by ramps or stairways, ran around it. The whole had, however, been so complete- ly plundered for building material that the possibility of reconstruction seems remote.</page><page sequence="6">THE ORIENTAL INSTITUTE ARCHEOLOGICAL REPORT 261 The wall, 5 meters high, which sustains this pavilion rests upon a kind of platform also furnished with a parapet and forming a second much narrower terrace reached by two ramps. Further clearing is needed to make evident the nature of this new type of architecture. The only monument in this section not of the time of Pepi II was a funerary stele of the Ramesside period. The name of the deceased person is lost. The quarters of the priests of the pyramid of Neith were also further cleared. See the previous report and Annales du Service des Antiquites, XXXVI, Fasc. 1 (1936), 15 ff. Tanis (Sdn el-Ijagar). La Mission FranCaise de Tanis During the ninth season, excavation in the Great Temple area was carried on in the region of the first obelisks and the first pylon, and a hillock between the first and second pair of obelisks was cleared. The destruction of the temple had been extreme, but from scanty traces it was found possible to establish the plan of the first pylon and the two structures which surrounded it. One of these structures possessed a large collection of sculpture of which important fragments have been recovered. Among these are three Saite steles (the best preserved of which dates to Psammetichus) and a water clock of Amasis, all of fine workmanship. Bases and fragmentary statues reveal the names and titles of many persons of the time who resided at Tanis. Most remarkable are two statues in the black schist of the Wadi Hammamat, both of the same personage, Panemetit, son of Pensy, nomarch of the Fifteenth Nome under Ptolemy X. His name had previously been found in an inscrip- tion in the Anath temple. Both statues have suffered rough treatment, and the heads are missing. One shows Panemetit holding an image of Amon; in the other he holds a group consisting of Amon, Horus, and Thoth. The dorsal pillar of the more complete statue is in the form of an obelisk, and the pyramidion bears a scene in which Panemetit worships Amon. In an inscrip- tion on the pillar Panemetit recounts his career, claiming that he built the first pylon and that he had built his own house in the temple inclosure. Work also continued on the immense mud-brick building to the north of the Anath temple. This structure is at least of Ramesside date and may be earlier. As it is deeply buried, time did not permit its complete clearance, so that its length is as yet unknown. Its width is 35 meters. Along the wall on the interior a series of rooms was cleared. Then was found a room of con- siderable dimensions, occupied by pits at least ten in number and possibly more, arranged in rows of five. They are of mud brick, about 3 meters in diame- ter and varying in depth between 21 and 4 meters. All are full of sand to an exact height of 3 meters above ground level, and the diameter of each is less at the top than at the bottom. The wall of each pit has also been pierced by a hole. The purpose of these pits remains obscure. It seems very unlikely that</page><page sequence="7">262 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES they were column bases, as no traces of columns or architraves were found. It is hoped that the excavation of the entire building will reveal their use. From a clipping submitted by Pierre Montet. Thebes (Gurneh).

Nallino, traveled in Yemen between the months of April and November, 1936. The ancient Sabean and Himyaritic cultures were studied, as well as the relations between ancient Yemen and pharaonic Egypt. Important conclusions were reached which will change present historical conceptions relating to these countries. Races and dialects of the western and southern parts of the Arabian peninsula were compared with those of central and northern Arabia. The mission achieved scientific results which permit tracing on charts the distribution and migrations of the races in those territories. Geological and zo6logical studies were also made. The scientific materials collected will be preserved in the museum of the university, which plans to publish the results within a short time.

Glueck believes that much "Pergamene" pottery was made locally by Nabataeans. As a result of the survey of 1936 the Ameri- can School and the Transjordan Department of Antiquities began in March the excavation of a Nabataean temple at Khirbet et-Tannm1r, south of the Wady el-Hesa (biblical river Zered), where reliefs, including some of Atargatis and Zeus-Hadad, had been found. Nabataean art is shown to have been highly eclectic. Soundings were made at Tell el-Kheleifeh (Ezion-geber?) on the north shore of the Gulf of Aqabah, and further excavations are planned. Through courtesy of the Royal Air Force, Glueck was able to fly over much of the territory he had previously covered, and a few new sites were noted. The land survey will be continued.

British Museum and British School of Archaeology in Iraq Mallowan concentrated on the later levels (3000-1400 B.c.) during the second season of excavation (spring, 1936). The upper five of the fifteen levels are of this historic period (see ILN, November 23, 1935, pp. 930-33, for the prehistoric finds of the previous season). The first level encountered in the 1936 campaign was of the middle of the second millennium. The architecture was of mud brick, and the excavators found evidence of arched doorways and vaulted roofs. In general, the metal work parallels that of the Mediterranean coast, but engraved pins are of Caucasian type. A fine ceremonial battle ax with engraving about the socket was found. Cylinder seals of Kirkuk type, nine cuneiform tablets (one of them a grain receipt), and painted pottery of the north central Syrian type complete the picture for this period. Following a gap in occupation of several hundred years, the four remaining historic levels yielded objects showing principally Mesopotamian influences. Sumerian cylinder seal and metal types were found, as well as a jar-sealing with Sumerian inscription. Information concerning this early historic period was supplemented by a sondage at two adjacent sites, Arbit and Germayir. From the latter came a pottery anthropomorph of a male fertility figure. Mallowan's material indicates a mixture of influences throughout, which increases the interest in his investigation of this little worked area of the Near East.

Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres Excavation during the eighth campaign was concentrated in a new area northeast of the city, where three strata have been recognized. The upper, belonging to the end of the twelfth century, showed signs of an abrupt termi- nation. Here was found an unfinished sculptor's piece representing the king of the city standing before the god El. The second stratum, from the thir- teenth and last half of the fourteenth centuries, produced houses with subter- ranean burial chambers similar to some Aegean tombs. Elaborate homes of merchants were recovered, with stores and servant quarters on the ground floor and the master quarters upstairs. In the shops were found weapons and tools of bronze, a couchant bull talent weight in bronze (470 grams), a silver- plated ceremonial battle ax with a sculptured lioness head at its socket, gold and silver pendants, a double mold for jewelry, a cache containing bronze plates of a scale balance, and a set of weights upward from one-quarter shekel (2.5 grams). Remarkable among these weights is a naturalistic, nonoriental portrait head, cast in bronze apparently by the lost wax process. From the weights it is deduced that a Palestinian, rather than Mesopotamian, system was in use. In the third stratum, dating from the fifteenth and the first of the fourteenth centuries, the houses had burial caverns containing skeletons and an abundance of funerary equipment. Among the pottery finds was a frag- ment of Kamares ware. The architecture of this level shows damage by earth- quake, presumably one that occurred about 1350 B.C. according to the Tell el-Amarna correspondence between the king of Tyre and Amenophis IV. Most of the Ras Shamra texts have been found in or below the earthquake debris. Among the documents found during the season was one in the Ras Shamra script listing the officials of the temples of the city. In the Babylonian (Akkadian) script were wills, real estate sale contracts, and a letter from the king of Carchemish to the ruler of Ugarit. At near-by Minet-el-Beida (Leukos Limen) was found a cache of Greek staters, many of rare and unknown types, struck in the Thraco-Macedonian area in the sixth century B.C. Some of these had been melted down, but partly melted coins were found attached to the silver masses. C.

University of Michigan Excavations were resumed here in 1936-37 with Clark Hopkins as General Director and Robert McDowell as Field Director. Work was continued upon the large block of private houses which had occupied the attention of the expedition for a number of years. Over a part of this area, Level III (Parthian) was completely excavated and removed, and some of Level IV (Hellenistic) was uncovered. Two public buildings were also investigated. The first level of one of these, known as temple "A," was laid bare. It proved to be a Parthian temple with a small theater in conjunction. The structure had been of brick with decorative friezes of cut brick and engaged columns with capitals of the same style. Unfortunately, the walls had been removed by brick- robbers, but by tracing the floors and by means of undisturbed fragments of fallen decoration much of the temple may be restored. The other building, which has only partially been uncovered, may also be a temple. In any case, it includes a theater larger than that in temple "A." Over nine thousand objects were registered, including many interesting small finds. Of these, the figurines, the coins, and the pottery formed the largest groups. The material should be particularly valuable in clarifying the differences between the culture of the Parthian and Hellenistic periods in Mesopotamia. In temple "A," objects dated after A.D. 200 provided interest- ing connections with Dura-Europus. From the same area came numerous iron weapons, as well as scale and mail armor. Information furnished through the courtesy of Clark Hopkins, General Director. (Tepe Gawra). University of Pennsylvania and American School of Oriental Research in Bagdad Further reports from the director, E. A. Speiser, add considerably to the material already reported for the 1936/37 season (see AJSL, LIII, No. 3 [April, 1937], p. 213). Strata XII and XIII, which belong to the culture of the Painted Pottery Peoples, correspond to the al-cUbaid period in southern Babylonia. Among the approximately two hundred burials which have been uncovered in Stratum XII, urn burials predominate. A few gold beads in Stratum XII give the earliest relative date for the use of this metal. Absolute dates are not available, but it seems that Stratum XIII cannot be later than the end of the fifth millennium B.c. Stratum XIII contains the earliest-known example of monumental architecture. The acropolis of this stratum contains the Eastern Shrine, the Central Temple, and the Northern Temple, built in the order given. All three open upon the main court, which is closed from the southwest by private houses. The structural details of this complex sepa- rate it sharply from temple plans of Strata VIII-X and incorporate archi-</page><page sequence="18">THE ORIENTAL INSTITUTE ARCHEOLOGICAL REPORT 273 tectural features unknown in the later levels. The connection between the Painted Pottery Peoples and this vigorous, advanced architecture is definitely established. Detailed study of the al-cUbaid pottery remains of Strata XII and XIII shows interesting parallels with the southern fabrics, as well as with wares from Arpachiyah and Samarra. Stratum XIV is attested to by only a single course of rubble foundation; certain is only that the al-cUbaid period had not yet begun. Scattered sherds point to Samarra and Halaf. Stratum XV reintroduces the all-libn construction which is definitely pre- al-cUbaid. Two interesting houses, built around central courts, have been laid bare. Some of the narrow chambers uncovered may have been used for pottery-drying or pottery storage. Typical Samarra wares occur with an ad- mixture of Tell Halaf elements. Excavation of Stratum XVI was not com- pleted during the present season. However, some interesting underground kilns were discovered which give an answer to the problem of the pre-al-cUbaid civilization's success in producing such superb ware. Investigation of the area at the eastern base of the mound, which was cleared for dumping space, revealed six distinct building levels, all containing ceramic remains of the Halaf period. The bucranium is the outstanding decorative motive. The lowest stratum contributed several contracted burials. From a 5-meter-deep cistern came undecorated ware, or ware with light bands and simple diamond patterns done in red on a creamy slip, types not yet known elsewhere at Tepe Gawra. Above these sherds in the cistern were recorded four levels of burials with the remains of twenty-three persons. The southern third of the tell where work had ceased with Stratum X re- ceived further excavation. Among several burials from Stratum XII was a child burial with a well-preserved "playing pipe" of bone. No remains from Stratum XIII were found in this area. Explorations in the plain to the north revealed an Assyrian settlement dated by bricks to the age of Sargon.

Turkestan 1. The Samarkand Expedition of the Uzbek State Historical Museum (I. A. Sukharev, leader) explored the area south of Samarkand. Twenty-four sites, including settlements, irrigation canals, etc., were added to the archeo- logical map of the region. An important sculptured cornice, attributed to the first centuries of our era, was found in the waters of the Amu on the Afghan boundary at Airtam, thirteen kilometers west of Termez, capital of the ancient Ta Mai kingdom. The carving in high relief depicts male and female musi- cians separated by acanthus palmettos. According to S. F. Oldenburg, this is a portion of a group of five of the so-called Pahica Mh.asabda, "The Five Great Sounds," of the Buddhist art canon. The stylistic peculiarities belong with the Gandharan Greco-Buddhist art of western India and northwestern Afghanistan. Among small objects were: two pre-Moslem clay seals with human effigies en face; a gold stater of Kanishka; and Indo-Scythian copper coins, one of them reputedly of the Greco-Bactrian king Apollodotus (second century B.C.). 2. The Tashkent Expedition (G. V. GrigorD ev, leader) uncovered nineteen gorodisches in the IAngiul region of the Chirchik Valley. At Iski-Kaunchi were found: Afrasiab types of glazed pottery, mainly white with black and red ornamentation, bearing Arabic inscriptions of the Samanid period; glass vessels, some ornamented; a dark green, glazed lamp; wheel-made pottery kettles; and baked bricks (25 by 17 by 4 centimeters and 25 by 8 by 3.5 centimeters). Chinaz Tepe and IUgon Tepe yielded sphero-conical vessels, which occur from Moscow to Egypt. In the upper levels of Kaunchi Tepe white, glazed sherds of "Sogdian type," pottery fragments showing cloth im- pressions, and fragments of pythoses were discovered. This pottery, with the exception of the Sogdian ware, was not wheel-made. Among numerous pottery vessels was one with a ram-shaped handle 12.7 centimeters high, one of the horns twisting forward. A similar vessel, attributed to the third or second century B.C., was brought to light in 1934 by the Manych Expedition of GAIMK in the Bronze Age tumulus near Khutor Veselyi on the Kuban River. From Shash Tepe gorodische, the remains of a large structure, consisting of parallel arched corridors, may be the ruins of a stupa-like temple, a type common to Afghanistan, and also to some Mesopotamian tepes, whose un- baked bricks, by Borchard's measurements, would approximate in size those in Shash Tepe. 3.

Bokhara For description and plans of the mausoleum of Ismacil the Samanid, built about the beginning of the tenth century A.D., see L. Rempel in BAIPA, IV, No. 4 (December, 1936), 198-209, Kazakhatan Near the Aral Sea, gold mines dating nearly three thousand years ago were discovered by a Soviet archeological expedition. The mines were complete even to the crude ore-crushing plants. The diggers were in the Bronze Age stage of development, for no iron tools were found. Two skeletons recovered were not of a Mongol type. A possible connection with the Scythians has been suggested. New York Times, April 15, 1937. Kiev A Soviet archeological expedition from the Marx Institute of Material Culture, digging in the Province of Kiev in southern Russia, uncovered a Stone Age village site. The village, circular in plan, contained houses which had walls painted in red ocher and which were built in a single line around a central circular plaza. Finds included walls and fences; floors of baked clay; a great variety of painted pottery, including pitchers, bowls, cooking pots, and bread boxes. Other small finds were stone grain-grinders, agricultural tools made of horn, and figurines of clay showing the style of dress and orna- ment used by men and women.
