POWERS Fancy what a game of chess would be if all the chessmen had passions and intellects, more or less small and cunning; if you were not only uncertain about your adversary's men, but a little uncertain also about your own. George Eliot, Felix Holt the Radical (1866? Reel time What is so engaging about Dada and Surrealist objects is the way they always seem more at home in an amusement park than an art museum. And what is irresistible about an object like Marcel Duchamp's Bicycle Wheel (1913) is that you can?and, of course, museum visitors sometimes do?take it for a spin. Building on the innovations of Cubist collage, Dada and Surrealist objects most often consist of sculptural materials that are as unorthodox as they are, paradoxically, quotidian. Moreover, by insinuating themselves into our space?in the manner, say, of Vladimir Tatlin's Corner Counter-Reliefs (1914-1915) or Kurt Schwitters's Merzbau of the 1920-1930s?they give rise to a sculptural space that is intended to be both visually observed and, at once, physically occupied. By radicalizing our understanding of the traditional media of sculpture, as well as the extent of its three dimensionality, these playful objects might be best characterized as acting in the "gap" between art and life, as Robert Rauschenberg has described his own artistic practice.2 But even beyond questioning the three dimensionality of sculpture, they interrogate what Duchamp, in particular, might describe as its "fourth dimensionality," an idea which is no less indebted to Cubism. In other words, by insisting that we no longer act as the passive consumers of sculpture, but rather as ?ts active participants, these works unfold in both a space and, corresponding to it, a time which we intrinsically share, as Rosalind Krauss has importantly observed.3 Although their relationship to us is surely interactive and, to some extent, even open-ended, it would nevertheless be a mistake to confuse these objects with merely an anchor for our imagination, and their participatory aesthetics with an otherwise rudderless ship. To the contrary, like all the games that Duchamp and the Surrealists so famously loved, whether of skill or chance, these playful objects are also endowed with their own sets of rules, including certain trajectories that are allowed to the object and therefore are meaningful, whereas others are not: for example, the same circular logic of the Bicycle Wheel that significantly allows us to take it for a spin, just as significantly forbids us from taking it for a ride. Even the causeway between Duchamp's art and life is, on both scores, a game of skill par excellence. Chess, he explains, "is a visual and plastic thing, and if it isn't geometric in the static sense of the word, it is mechanical, since it moves . . . the way, for example, a Calder is mechanical."4 Perhaps more surprising than Duchamp's analogy of art-making to chess-playing is their relationship, in turn, to the flow of language, which Hubert Damisch has importantly elaborated.5 According to Duchamp: the chess pieces are the block alphabet which shapes thoughts; and these thoughts, although making a visual design on the chessboard, express their beauty abstractly, like a poem. Actually, I believe that every chess player experiences a mixture of two aesthetic pleasures, first the abstract image akin to the poetic idea of writing, second the sensuous pleasure of the ideographic execution of that image on the chessboards.6 Yet, unlike the mathematical rigor invariably informing the games of both art and chess that Duchamp played, many are the Surrealist objects that I would compare to a directly competing type of board 1.

Here, the rules are surely fewer than in chess, although the endgame is essentially as Duchamp proposes: each movement of the token is assigned a certain (syntactic) value, and each place where it lands on the game board a certain (semantic) value, culminating in the production of meaning. The great originality of Krauss's sustained examination of Dada and Surrealist objects is that she, too, proposes their conceptual meaning to be indissolubly wedded to their physical movement. Better still, she treats these otherwise distinct senses in which the object is (ideally and really) mobile as if they were fundamentally the same: as if ?ts concept were physically manifest, and ?ts meanings were physically produced. In this way, she not only harrows the field of formalism, finding common ground between artworks and the textual meanings in which they are rooted (and vice versa), but also redefines the object as a provocatively double?physical-as-conceptual?conveyance. But if Dada and Surrealist objects are inherently double, Krauss's reading of them is split in two, depending on whether the temporality of the object is essentially literal or metaphorical?real or ideal. Of these two paths on which Krauss sets the object, the first is typified by Alberto Giacometti's Suspended Ball (1930-1931) (fig. 1) and board game-like sculptures of the early 1930s?as well as Duchamp's experiments with optical rotary devices and disks in the 1920 1930s?in which "there is often a literal temporality," Krauss explains, a "real movement which synchronizes their existence with that of the viewer's experience."7 The physical movement of these objects?whether the swinging pendulum of Giacometti's Suspended Ball, or the title device, say, of Duchamp's Rotary Demisphere (Precision Optics) (1925) (fig. 2)?not only synchronizes them to the viewer's experience of space and time but also reiterates their conceptual movement. Thus, the pendulum engages in a physical back-and-forth, which doubles its ambivalence of meaning. By contrast, if the round-and-round of the rotary devices creates the flicker of an optical illusion, the brass ring of its meaning is no less flickering and illusory?always just beyond the reach of riding Duchamp's (not-so-) merry-go-round. Specifically, the to-and-fro of Giacometti's pendulum generates meaning in relation to a process that Krauss felicitously describes as "alternation," and identifies Figure 2.

After all, "alternation" is exactly a sort of "two-step."13 In the optical illusions of breasts and other "part-objects" that Duchamp's rotary devices engender as they spin, they thus alternate?no longer between Giacometti's synchronous doublets of sexual congress, but rather diachronically?between the present-day example and ?ts long-lost prototype: e.g., between (the optical illusion of) any woman's breast and (the return of) the mother's breast tout court.u This "two-step" of signification Krauss identifies with the Freudian theory of "anacusis":15 that is, with the adult's choice of love-objects based on his parental figures insofar as they once fed, cared for, or otherwise protected him as a child. With respect to the mother, in particular, Freud explains: [when] the first beginnings of sexual satisfaction are still linked with the taking of nourishment, the sexual instinct has a sexual object outside the infant's own body in the shape of his mother's breast. . . . [Thus] children learn to feel for other people who help them in their helplessness and satisfy their needs for love which is on the model of, and a continuation of, their relation as sucklings to their nursing mother.16 That said, surely Krauss does not mean to suggest that the optical illusions generated by Duchamp's rotary devices evince anything more than a purely rhetorical figure of attachment to the "nourishing" mother (and her substitutes)?as distinct from the refrigerator mother once popularized in accounts of childhood autism, and still popular in the critical literature on Duchamp.17 Even more to the point, if the eroticism of these optical illusions might be described as meaningfully anaclitic, then how are we to understand such an attachment to what is, in effect, the breast-machine that generates them (variations on which Duchamp once tried to shill at an inventors' convention, side-by-side with garbage compactors and potato peelers)?18?or, by extension, the breast-pump that now consumes them, at least in the sense of the viewer who, also weaned at the teat of a refrigerator, still finds himself looking for ice cubes, where others do milk? True, such an attachment does perfectly accord with what Andr? Breton has famously described as Duchamp's "mechanistic, cynical interpretation of the phenomenon of love" (and for cynical, read cyclical).19 But unlike Duchamp's rotary devices, anacusis is, quite specifically, neither mechanistic: only bodies, but not machines, can be 9.

Nor can it fairly be described as cynical/cyclical: after all, to satisfy a need both assumes and, in turn, reinforces a causal, and not a circular, relationship. In sum, because anacusis is always founded in helpless bodies, it is perfectly distinct, on both scores, from Duchamp's self-sufficient machines. By disembodying the mother as a mother-machine, and yoking her nipple to the child reciprocally conceived as a milking machine infernale, Duchamp thus circularizes the cause-and-effect relationship inherent in what we might call the first "two-step": sating a need as opposed to merely providing a flow. Moreover, he objectifies that uniquely intersubjective relationship, to which helping the helpless necessarily gives rise, by transmogrifying the second "two-step"?a human desire to refind and reexperience that relationship?into a closed circuit of repetition. What is most remarkable about Duchamp's "desiring-machines" is not the paradoxical concept itself: of machines that desire.20 Rather, even if we entirely embrace the concept, it is how these "desiring machines," for Duchamp, seem to exemplify a failure o? anacusis and, to the same extent, invert each of its terms. Thus, where there should be helpless bodies, we find self-sufficient machines; where there should be causality, we find circularity; and, ultimately, where there should be desire, we find indifference?even the "beauty of indifference," as Duchamp so often emphasizes.21 Given that the very concept of "desiring machines" owes a special debt to Duchamp's fantastically self-contained and -regulating Bachelor Machine (1915-1923),22 it is all the more telling that the artist, himself, associates circularity (in a comprehensively physical/rotary, conceptual/self-sufficient, and sexual/ onanistic sense) not with anacusis but rather with the directly competing type of object-choice to which Freud also opposes it: "narcissism."23 Similarly, for all that Bataille would surely have recognized in Suspended Ball?the ambivalent morphology of its Story of the eye (1928)-like ball, most notably24?the deployment of "heterology" as "alternation" would have seemed strange to Bataille, if not totally estranged. Whether his theories be described as dialectical or dualist (or, perhaps, as something else entirely), their emphasis is never on division per se (e.g. such doublets as high/low, sacred/accursed, and so forth), but always on the possibility of their physically immediate experience as continuity. Thus, "the copula of terms is no less irritating than the copulation of bodies," as Bataille weds the linking of categories to the joining of sexes; and as a result, even "the verb to be is the vehicle of amorous frenzy."25 Although Bataille's 20. On "desiring-machines," see Gilles Deleuze, F?lix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, trans. Robert Hurley, Mark Seem, Helen Lane (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 1983), especially pp. 36-50; see also Bois, Krauss, Formless, p. 156, where they describe Bataille's Story of the eye, like Giacometti's Suspended Ball, as rejecting the Kleinian model of part-objects as "agents of intersubjective relations, and thus players in a drama between persons" in favor of Deleuze/Guattari's model of "organ life as impersonal but permutational"; Rosalind Krauss, Bachelors (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, 1999), pp. 64-65, where she describes Duchamp's Bachelor Machine in similar terms. 21. Perhaps the only thing to which Duchamp is never indifferent is indifference. E.g. Marcel Duchamp, The Writings of Marcel Duchamp, ed. Michel Sanouillet, Elmer Peterson (N.Y: Da Capo, 1989), p. 30. Similarly, in Anti-Oedipus, (in their own return of the repressed?) Deleuze and Guattari describe how their model of "desiring-machines" does not presuppose "certain extremely negative attitudes on the part of his parents to which the child reacts by turning himself into a machine" (p. 37), nor even how "the child relates the breast as a partial object to the person of his mother, and constantly watches the expression on his mother's face" (p. 48). Decidedly, it is also in terms of navel- (and neither mother- nor breast-)gazing that Krauss describes Deleuze/Guattari's model, including how it particularizes Eva Hesse's work "with a strange exactitude, capturing the schiziness of its autoeroticism coupled with its fanatical order, projecting the cunning of its enormous ambition trapped inside the autistic limits of a fixed convention."

The introduction of Krauss's "(n)" to Bataille's "alteration," by setting the space of difference against time, at once brings her analysis within the realm of Jacques Derrida's diff?rance, which he describes as "two apparently different values . . . tied together in Freudian theory: to differ as discernibility, distinction, separation, diastema, spacing, and to defer as detour, relay, reserve, temporization." Jacques Derrida, A Derrida Reader: Between The Blinds, ed. Peggy Kamuf, trans. Alan Bass et al. (N.Y: Columbia University, 1991), p. 71. Cf. Homi Bhabha, The Location of Culture (N.Y: Routledge, 1994), p. 51, where he describes the fetishistic process of identification as "spatially split" and "temporally deferred." (With thanks to Nuit Banai for suggesting this line of inquiry.) Nevertheless, such an emphasis on the deferral of meaning/being is especially hard to reconcile with Bataille's all but mystical belief in immanence, experienced as a sort of physical immediacy: "a joy that has no object other than immediate life," Bataille explains, one that "belongs only to the person for whom there is no beyond." Bataille, Visions of Excess, p. 236. So too, the metaphorical titles that Breton conjures for Meret Oppenheim's insistently literal objects, by begging similar questions of deferral, raise similar problems of physical immediacy, as I hope to demonstrate.</page><page sequence="6">Powers: Bodies at rest 231 "heterology" and Krauss's "alternation" (by way of Bataille) similarly emphasize the liminality of the sex act, these limits that Bataille would both destabilize and conjugate, Giacometti suspends; in other words, what Bataille would consummate, Giacometti teases. Instead of culminating in sexual congress and its transgressive potential for human continuity, Giacometti uncouples the sex act with all the radical incongruence of the section that would entirely exceed its solid, not to mention all the tensile strength of a violin string.26 In turn, by reducing penetration to frottage, Giacometti's emphasis is directly opposed to Bataille's, and is instead placed on the fundamental exteriority of the sex act, as well as the consequent individuality of the wedge and the sphere themselves. Like Duchamp's and Giacometti's love-machines, Krauss' model is equally remarkable for both its mechanistic precision and similarly unself-conscious mechanization of desire. After all, if "alternation" perfectly describes a current of meaning, its "two-step" might be that of the turbine which generates it in the first place, including its own reversible polarity, the circularity of its own mechanical coils, and the spark of desire which it analogously disembodies. Even so, the problem is not the mechanical determination of Krauss's model, but rather the imprecision of its movement, insofar as it fails to distinguish between what Bataille describes as "rotation and sexual movement." The combination of these "two primary motions," Bataille explains: is expressed by the locomotive's wheels and pistons. These two motions are reciprocally transformed, the one into the other. Thus one notes that the earth, by turning, makes animals and men have coitus, and (because the result is as much the cause as that which provokes it) that animals and men make the earth turn by having coitus ... a locomotive rolling on the surface of the earth is the image of a continuous metamorphosis.27 As such, Bataille's love-train?whose pistons turn its wheels and, together, move the locomotive?is also the twain where "sexual movement" and "rotation" both meet and, in turn, are "reciprocally transformed." Yet, if these two primary motions are inherently complementary, they are also fundamentally opposed, for which reason Bataille figures them as a series of doublets. On the one hand, he describes sexual movement in terms of the in-and-out thrust of a locomotive's pistons, the terrestrial motion of man and, ultimately, coitus.28 On the other hand, rotation encompasses the round-and-round of a locomotive's wheels, the celestial orbit of the earth and, presumably, the opposite term of coitus (human continuity): i.e. onanism (individual discontinuity). By describing sexual movement as fundamentally terrestrial, but rotation as essentially celestial (read, cerebral), Bataille thus identifies the piston and coitus with the body, just as surely as he does the wheel and onanism with a sort of cosa mentale. Like Bataille, Duchamp and Giacometti also understand physical movement as instantiating conceptual movement, which accounts for the spin all three put on onanism in particular. "Always there has been a necessity for circles in my life," Duchamp explains, for "rotation. It is a kind of narcissism, this self sufficiency, a kind of onanism."29 Just as turning the crankshaft of the Model-T is no guarantee that you'll be taking a ride in the car, cranking up Duchamp's Coffee Mill (1911 ), Chocolate Grinder (1913; 1914), or Bicycle Wheel is indeed a guarantee, as he elsewhere says, of "Slow life?Vicious circle?Onanism?Horizontal."30 Duchamp's pair of Sisyphean nudes, who apparently go up the down staircase only to go back again, in this sense, are no less viciously circular than his plethora of rotary devices which, always on axis, spin round and round.31 Even Duchamp's fascination with "actual movement," more generally, is informed by an id?e which is neither less circular nor at all less fixe. Says Duchamp: movement in art, motion in art, had never really been exploited. Rodin did a man walking, but that man did not 26.

It was intended to walk, but it didn't walk. In other words, to introduce a movement, the actual movement in a work of art, had never been thought of before. And the Futurists thought of it. And I at the same time ... it was in the air because of the invention of the movies, of the cinema.32 Nevertheless, when Duchamp does finally merge actual movement with film, as Anemic Cinema (1925-1926), what he creates is a reel-as-real time experience?of his rotating disks, with spirals and puns, in motion?which is to say, a reel of a wheel. "Instead of making a machine which would turn," he explains, "I said to myself, 'Why not turn ['tourner'/shoot] the film?'"33 Neither "synchronizing" (Krauss) their real movement to the viewer's experience, nor "reciprocally transforming" (Bataille) their circular movement, all that his Anemic Cinema and rotary devices demand is complicity in their inexorability.34 Like conventional cinema, Duchamp's reels and wheels suspend the viewer's reality and, in their circling and spiraling patterns, even engender a sort of hypnotic passivity. Unlike conventional cinema, however, they substitute neither a comparable reality nor, as Salvador Dal? describes the Surrealist object, a true second self.35 Even the optical illusions of breasts and other part-objects engendered by their actual movement?which, as Krauss argues, reintroduce the body into optics, and desire into vision36?are no different than any feat of perspective. Untestable by any other sense, optical like perspectival illusions, for Duchamp, are always perceived by a disembodied eye and, in this sense, by no body at all.37 Significantly, Giacometti also professes a fascination with actual movement and even describes his objects in the same solipsistic terms as Duchamp does his rotary devices, including the feedback loop in which both artists would seem to be trapped: Despite all my efforts, it was impossible for me then to endure a sculpture that gave an illusion of movement. . . . I could only create such movement if it was real and actual, I also wanted to give the sensation of motion that could be induced. ... But all this took me away little by little from external reality, I had a tendency to become absorbed only in the construction of the objects themselves. ... I was disturbed by reality, which seemed to me to be different. Everything at that moment seemed a little grotesque, without value, to be thrown away.38 In an especially Duchampian turn, Giacometti is even reported to have dismissed these sculptures, about a dozen years earlier, as "masturbation."39 But whether he is referring to the mental or the physical sort, perhaps, does not really matter. His paradoxically entitled board game, On ne joue plus (1932), is the case in point. Rather than denying its title or material status, "We are no longer playing"?or, as it is more elegantly translated, "No more play"?also refers to the lack of an opponent, a lack which doubly elicits a withdrawal from external reality, as well as an absorption in the object itself, as the artist confirms on both scores. In effect, Giacometti recreates no longer playing with another as playing with himself and, in this sense, as logically circular in the same way that his Circuit (1931 ) and Man, Woman, Child (1931 ) were already physically circular. Like the onanism of Duchamp's sit-and-spin whirligigs, or the scatological comestibles which they endlessly proliferate (coffee and chocolate, mostly),40 the solipsism of On ne joue plus constitutes a similar endgame, one which also 32.

Although my eye might experience Andy Warhol's Empire (1964) as an apocalyptic feat of fellatio, the only thing on the tip of my tongue would be verbal, not oral.

In this, perspective resembles color which like it cannot be tested by touch." Duchamp, Writings, p. 87. In the same sense that perspective resembles color?neither can be tested by touch?it also resembles Duchamp's use of glass, which is always interposed as a barrier, not to sight but to touch. Rather, the foil to Duchamp's optical breast-machine is his Pri?re de toucher (1947), whose foam-rubber breast takes another, paradigmatically disembodied process?not a purely optical one, perhaps, but reading?and lends it a true, bodily semblance, thereby doubling reader as toucher, visual as haptic experience, the exhibition of art as the art of exhibitionism, etc. Dalia Judovitz's discussion of Anemic Cinema as critiquing "phenomenological assumptions regarding space" is especially interesting in this regard.

Thus, even as the board game becomes a sort of mind game, On ne joue plus undergoes a physical transformation as well?into a sort of necropolis, epitomized, as Krauss observes, by its insistent horizontally as well as the coffin-like spaces at its heart.42 If all these solipsistic and even onanistic, but always circular figurations of the object recall Bataille's analogous understanding of rotation, why do Bataille, Giacometti, and Duchamp not only identify circularity to gray matter but also oppose it to matter touf court, whether to sexual movement in particular, or to the external reality it necessarily assumes, including the body more generally? "It is enough to note that a common measure necessarily approaches the regularity of geometric figures," says Bataille; "Monsters thus would be the dialectical opposites of geometric regularity, in the same manner as individual forms, but in an irreducible way."43 In other words, the perfectly Platonic circle, nowhere to be found in nature, is the dialectical opposite of nature; by contrast, the exemplary instance of nature is not merely the irreducibility of the body, but the most irreducible of all bodies: "monsters" as Bataille calls them here, or "freaks of nature" as he titles the article. Leonardo's Vitruvian Man (1485-1490) notwithstanding, the dialectical opposite of the circle, therefore, is the body?and the mind reels, no?44 Even on their own circular terms, Giacometti's Suspended Ball and Duchamp's rotary devices still pose two fundamental problems: in the final analysis, how to conceptualize a physical circle except as a logical circle, which is to say, tautologically;45 and to what extent is their circular logic, like their self-sufficient withdrawal from external reality, at all the same as the freewheeling space of Surrealist automatism and fantasy? In fact, the problem with Krauss's model of Dada and Surrealist objects is its peculiar aptness to these circular objects and concepts, such that any model of their physical-as-conceptual movement is already a model of a model?a circle within a circle. Directly opposed to the open-ended and forward-moving trajectory of Bataille's "reciprocally-transformed" love-train, these "revolutionary" love-machines, like Krauss's model of them, all describe its opposite term: a closed circuit of physical-as-conceptual movement which, already circumscribed at the outset, always constitutes a return of that movement in the end. Without doubt, the absence of a base in Giacometti's board game-like sculptures situates them neither entirely within nor wholly without "the continuous surface of reality," as Krauss argues, but rather as a sort of caesura that transcends any such division.46 Perhaps the same can even be said of how the Bicycle Wheel and, by the same logic, the Rotary Demisphere not only share a passing resemblance with Constantin Brancusi's similarly perched, similarly geometric forms but also retract their pedestal, Brancusi-like, within the object itself as William Canfield observed. Nevertheless, the problem of their superstructure (of the games these objects play, including their actual movement more generally) is otherwise. However effectively these objects as objects transcend the divided space of art and life, their binary concepts are in no sense similarly transformed, but rather are everywhere "stabilized by the opposition between self and other: male versus female, hard versus soft, inside versus outside, life versus death, vertical versus horizontal."47 Like an isometric exercise in 41.

In addition to the horizontality which Duchamp and Giacometti variously associate with circularity, self-sufficiency, and onanism, on the heterological identity of (Duchamp's) shit to (Giacometti's) cadavers, see Bataille, Visions of Excess, p. 94. 43. Bataille, Visions of Excess, p. 55. Here, what was Bataille's wheel is now his sphere; and what he at first describes as "rotation," he now describes, no longer as an inherently regular process, but rather as a process of regularizing the irregular. In "dialectical opposition" to all these circular cosa mentale?indeed, their almost obsessively Platonic invocation of "common measure," "regularity," and "geometry"?is the body. Cf. Georges Bataille et al., Encyclopaedia Acephalica (London: Atlas, 1995), pp. 102-103, where he analogizes an orator to a fly on his nose?the one as a focused ego, the other as a mental distraction?then opposes the egocentrism of both to nature: that is, to the body. 44. The 1963 photograph, by Julian Wasser, of Eve Babitz and Duchamp playing chess at his Rasadena retrospective constitutes a similarly scandalizing, L.H.O.O.Q. (1919)-style response to Vitruvian Man: especially, in the emphasis of the photograph on bodily difference (young v. old; female v. male; nude/white v. clothed/black; faceless v. unique; and so forth), which it then sets against the architecture of the gallery and, in turn, doubles as the relationship of the chess pieces to the geometry of their chessboard. 45.

Of course, Krauss's argument is precisely that these binary concepts (unlike their binary forms) are not stabilized, but rather blur and slip? albeit neither more nor less reversibly than the on/off flip of a light switch, as I hope to demonstrate. On the dualisms, exemplified by the</page><page sequence="9">234 RES 46 AUTUMN 2004 physical-as-conceptual movement resisting itself, they are stabilized as a back-and-forth that can only go round-and-round because of their relentless self sufficiency. With respect to the viewer, it is, above all, their autoeroticism?of the wedge that would complete its sphere, like the circle that completes itself?that, taken in its (non-)relational sense, yields what we might more accurately describe as their aesthetics of non participation: as games that "no longer play," so often consisting of moves that are in any event invariable. Participation, therefore, no longer implies alteration (the possibility of affecting the trajectory of these objects), but merely alternation (the certainty of effecting their back-and-forth or round-and-round movement). Yet, all the while in the thrall of their hypnotic motion, even as these objects alternate within themselves, the viewer merely alternates with them?as still one more "pair[] of opposites," as Freud describes the circular relationship of voyeurism to exhibitionism or, here, the fact of effecting a sort of peepshow without at all affecting it.48 Thus, even adding a radically unlike, third term (ourselves) to these dualistic objects, first and foremost, merely produces another dualistic relationship (our voyeurism to their exhibitionism). By insisting on inner as well as outer-difference in this absolute rather than incremental way, all these binary concepts perhaps betray a greater problem, of liminality: of that variable third term, the one at the very threshold of difference, whose existence is continually coopted as dualisms?as "pairs of opposites," or the like?or otherwise preempted as self-reflexive relationships, as Giacometti and Duchamp variously describe the solipsism and even onanism of their objects. Tellingly, such a problem of metes and bounds?and of boundaries, more generally, as doubly physical and psychic formations?might be best understood as "a kind o? narcissism," as Duchamp says: in particular, a kind of narcissism which he specifically identifies with circularity and, in this sense, with a loss o? boundaries.49 Even if we normally think of narcissism as a sort of pas de deux, it nevertheless takes three to tango, long after the dance teacher has been all but forgotten. Narcissism, too, originates as a triangular relationship and, in some sense, always remains one. Indeed, right at the apex of the triangle is the very figure who, by establishing boundaries between the self and its projections, at once prevents their narcissistic relationship from circularizing and collapsing into mere self-sufficiency and onanism, as Duchamp goes on to say.50 So essential is this third figure to the process that cutting out the middlewoman is exactly what differentiates the maladaptive myth of Narcissus from any adaptive theory of narcissism properly speaking. Or, to state the case otherwise, to the one side is Echo who, unable proactively to intervene between Narcissus and his reflection, merely doubles a visual echo as an acoustic one and, thereby, proliferates a mirror image into an entire hall of them. To the other side, however, is the (m)other who, by concretely interposing herself between the child and its reflection, fundamentally squares their circular relationship.51 Only by triangulating the self and its projections does the (m)other break what would otherwise be their closed circuit (of self-sufficiency and onanism) and, at once, mark the threshold (neither of their duality, nor of their self-reflexivity, but rather) of their irretrievable difference. In this way, s/he not only founds their internal difference but also, by providing it with an external frame of reference, anchors difference in external reality more generally. Right where Echo fails, this third figure must therefore intervene as an obstruction and, exactly as such, prevent the circularization and, ultimately, the collapse of narcissism into mere self-sufficiency and onanism, as it does for Narcissus and Duchamp. Indeed, second only to the motif of circularity in Duchamp's artworks is that of obstruction, as both trench upon the formation of (artistic) identity. Self-consciously obstructive artworks, in this sense, include: his windows, which intervene in every conceivable way, from translucent to opaque, and at times are even silvered;52 his doors, which are always paradoxically interposed, whether because they are Wasser photograph of Babitz and Duchamp playing chess, that everywhere inform Duchamp's artworks, see Powers, "Fasten Your Seatbelts," pp. 1-6. 48.

In turn, that circle is at first squared, during what Lacan calls the "mirror stage," by the concrete intervention of the (m)other?as both an "obstruction" and a "support"?between the self and its projections (pp. 1-3). 52. See Duchamp, Writings, p. 74, where he not only compares shop windows to "proof of the existence of the outside world" and interrogating them to a sort of "round trip"?exactly the difference between the real world of narcissism and the circular world of Narcissus, respectively?but also emphasizes the dialectic of (non-) intervention engendered by these (transparent) obstructions: as "coition through a glass plane" and "feeling regret as soon as possession is consummated."</page><page sequence="10">Powers: Bodies at rest 235 double-framed (close off one room, open up another), or because they are unhinged and, as such, inseparable from their frame; and, most of all, the elaborate, theoretical apparatus Duchamp invents to describe "infrathin" separation.53 But this third figure must also intervene as a support and, in this sense, facilitate the body in pieces to imagine itself as a whole which is greater than the sum of its parts?here, by contrast, of Giacometti's not-so-little wedge that would but cannot complete its sphere. In fact, when Giacometti soon revisits this relationship of parts to their wholes, what he creates once again emphasizes the fact of fragmentation (e.g. the utterly disarticulated body of his Woman with Her Throat Cut [1932]), or otherwise deemphasizes the possibility of wholeness (e.g. his radically incomplete sculpture of Hands Holding the Void [Invisible Object] [1934]). Yet, by externalizing and localizing the (m)other as merely a transparent pane of glass or the midpoint of a pendulum, Duchamp and Giacometti not only flatten the triangular relationship s/he would found into the obverse and reverse of a plane or the antipodes of an arc. Both artists at once elide the possibility of real difference?as perfectly distinct, on both scores, from the certainty and, ultimately, the indifference of duality or self-reflexivity, whose two terms can always be reversed and recouped the one as the other. It is this fact of irretrievable difference that, in turn, differentiates Bataille's "alteration" from Krauss's "alternation." Like the hemline of any "mathematical frock coat,"54 one which freely alternates from season to season, and can always be re-altered in turn, Suspended Ball also rises and falls, is more or less sexy, always the one or the other, but never entirely other: i.e. sex.55 Although Giacometti's and Duchamp's love-machines create the illusion of sexual possibility, in fact there is only logical certainty?a viciously circular logic, to be sure. As a result, not only do they reduce sexuality to the absurd. What is worse, more like a choker than Jacques Lacan's famous "necklace that is a ring in another necklace made of rings," so adamant is their signification on its imaginary fixity that even narcissism would curl up? and die.56 Playing with yourself, in both senses alike, can only get you so far.

Virtual time By contrast, the ability of Dada and Surrealist objects to mobilize desire and fantasy, without necessarily being mobile in themselves, brings us to the second of the two paths on which Krauss sets them. No longer relying on the actual movement of the object, but rather on its virtual movement, Krauss describes Man Ray's Gift (1921; replica 1958) (fig. 3) and Meret Oppenheim's fur teacup (1936) as: shrouded in the temporality of fantasy. It can be the recipient of the extended experience of the viewer who projects his own associations onto its surface.

In this way, even as Man Ray's impossibly nail studded Gift dares us to pull down our imaginary ironing board, and to don a virtually shredded shirt, his photograph of Oppenheim's fur teacup (fig. 4) demands that we pull out our imaginary hair shirt, and take a virtual spot of tea instead. Yet, even if we could manipulate Man Ray's Gift, its showy intractability is merely the physical corollary of the mental, carpal tunnel syndrome we cannot but aggravate with its each imagined passing and re-passing. Here, domestic labor is figured as a sort of M?bius strip?and, a point especially sympathetic to the likes of Honor? Daumier or Edgar Degas, to be a laundress, then, is either to die by the shirt or to kill it. Another of Man Ray's objects soon revisits this hobbyhorse-like movement that so often informs the Dada idea?Object to be destroyed (Indestructible Object) (1923; replica 1964) (fig. 5): Man Ray's blinkered metronome, to the monotonous back and-forth of whose hand he appends the image of an eye. In both these objects, movement is analogously circumscribed, whether as the eternal to-and-fro of the laundress' hand or the metronome's. In the metronome, especially, Man Ray no sooner identifies meaning with movement than that movement is both conceptually and physically destroyed. While the eye stares automaton like at you, the hand that animates it sweeps back and forth no less automatically, irrespective of you. Although "eye" is surely another, to turn the famous phrase, "I" is no one at all:58 still one more peepshow (in some sense, literally) that we effect without at all affecting. In all these objects, then, physical movement constitutes an inherently closed circuit, just as their conceptual movement signifies the twin voids of love and labor they orbit: on the one hand, the eternal no place of Giacometti's not-sexual congress, like Duchamp's not-the mother's breast; on the other hand, Man Ray's complementary disfigurations of artisanal repetition at the ironing board, like artful r?p?tition at the keyboard?bored, indeed! Variously constituted as perpetual (im)motion machines, these objects thus resist themselves as an isometric exercise?pitting the back and-forth of their pendular movements against the ambivalence of their binary concepts?to the point where their lack of any physical trajectory is merely the other side of their ontological delay (their "instantaneous state of rest," as Duchamp says), turned inside-out, and made to show itself phenomenally.59 All the while that space contracts, time dilates, until the distance these 58.

By recording a passage in space that is at once a passage of time, these objects not only spatialize time but also, by hitching their three dimensions to the fourth, necessarily challenge the conventionally separate and distinct identifications of Time with Man, but of Space with Woman.60 Moreover, if the Einstein-like spacetime these objects engender is as such unmanned, even their temporality, in and of itself, marks what Julia Kristeva calls "Women's Time," and describes as "all encompassing and infinite like imaginary space." By parts indestructibly repetitive (for Kristeva, "cyclical time"), by others so aggressively self-sufficient as to supplant the unfolding of history by their eternalizing seamlessness ("monumental time"), these objects culminate, as Kristeva goes on to explain, in "the massive presence of a monumental temporality, without cleavage or escape, which has so little to do with linear time (which passes) that the very word 'temporality' hardly fits."61 In the age of performance anxiety they inaugurate, so begins the countdown that Dali's famous paean (and this, not just to time waiting to get hard) indefinitely suspends: Persistence of Memory WS]). Yet, the uniqueness of these objects is unmistakably the process of deferring meaning that, rather than crescendo, they circularize?like the process of "meta phor," which rather than carry elsewhere they might be more accurately described to "trans-fix." Although Dali's Scatological Object Functioning Symbolically (1930; replica 1973) (fig. 6) and Joan Mir?'s Object (Poetic Object) (1936) (fig. 7) also prominently feature pendular devices, here, they function in a truly symbolic/poetic way and, instead of circumscribing meaning, now figure its contingency: no longer Duchamp's, Giacometti's, and Man Ray's perpetuum fixum o? desire, but rather its true perpetuum mobile.62 Thus, in both the Dal? and the Figure 5.

Mir?, the object's physical trajectory is at least as various as its conceptual trajectory?either way, taking as its starting point a woman's shoe, a shoe which is in fact double. On the one hand, it invariably denotes physical displacement; however, rather than returning to where it begins, it is figured as part of a larger dynamic of locomotion (flying, walking, swimming, etc.) in the Mir?, and of liquefaction (dissolving, ingesting, ejaculating/ lactating, etc.) in the Dali. On the other hand, as a woman's shoe in particular, itfetishistically "crystalIize[s] the moment of undressing, the last moment in which the woman could still be regarded as phallic"?and, in this sense, frankly connotes a conceptual displacement, 60.

In this way, the shoe in the Mir? straightforwardly recalls the imaginary phallus to which Freud refers. Set within a labial cleft (the hollow of its pedestal-like Figure 7.

By contrast, containing a glass of milk in the Dal?, it instead recalls mother's milk and father's ejaculate as well, not to mention a castrating (if also labially shaped) claw. As in Andy Warhol's own really big show of shoes, ? la Recherche du Shoe Perdu (1955), and its similarly physical as-conceptual process of moving forward as at once looking back, not only is the "here and now" of a woman's shoe, by virtue of its peripatetic nature, always potentially "there."

In Meret Oppenheim's Ma gouvernante?(My Nurse)?mein Kinderm?dchen (1936; replica 1967) (fig. 8) and Das Paar (1956) (fig. 9), by contrast, the quality of that engagement with women's feet runs not at all and, in this sense, directly counter to the multiple spaces, times, and concepts which the Dal? and the Mir? variously conjure. In the Dal?, most notably, while all its variations on the theme of liquefaction refer to the here and now of exchanging bodily fluids, they also signify the liquefaction of difference more generally. In this sense, the master narrative of the Dal? is exemplified by the lump of sugar which, suspended above the glass of milk, threatens to dissolve into it. In turn, both the ejaculate-like milk, and the honey dipper-like spoon below it, threaten to conflate the difference between ingesting and ejaculating/lactating/regurgitating?part object and part apiary, if you will. However, not only does a woman's shoe?by "crystallizfing] the moment of undressing, the last moment in which the woman could still be regarded as phallic," as Freud says?threaten a return to a moment prior to sexual difference; but also, by everywhere reduplicating the shoe as its ?mage, Dal? even challenges the difference between reality and its representation, just as his practice of collage challenges the facticity of his paintings. Nevertheless, this primal fantasy of ubiquity and indifference, yet to be realized in the Dal?, has already been brought to fruition in the pair of brown boots which Oppenheim weds at the toe. Unlike Dali's lump of sugar that still hangs above the glass of milk and, therefore, has yet to dissolve into it? or his multiplicity of real and represented shoes that have yet to resolve into singularity?in Oppenheim's pair of boots, the mirror-doubling of left and right has already been restored to the arabesque unity of a "pair," just as the gender-doubling of male and female has already been returned to an "odd, unisexual" state, exactly as she describes the eternal embrace by which the narcissist boot at last merges into its long-lost double.64 In addition to a completely holistic figure, Oppenheim's shoe objects are also a figure of absolute entropy. And, just as she weds a pair of boots at the toe, in My Nurse she trusses a pair of white pumps like a Sunday goose. But if Oppenheim's practice of shoe binding is comparable to Giacometti's, Duchamp's, and Man Ray's circumscription of movement, is her body Figure 8.

(of works) also conceptually circularized and, indeed, physically disembodied? A good argument can be made that binding women's shoes reflects the binding of women more generally, even a sort of late-day practice of foot-binding in particular. Nevertheless, what constitutes a repressive practice, from a typically masculine point of view, is not necessarily a point of view Oppenheim shares. After all, as in the debate over lesbian pornography, it's not only a question of who's being looked at but also of who's doing the looking?or in lesbian S &amp; M, say, as in Oppenheim's shoe objects?of who's doing the binding. Perhaps even more intimate than women's bodies being bound are the objects and events that specifically identify them with being eaten, 64.

Two of her objects in the 1936 Surrealist Exhibition of Objects?the fur teacup and My Nurse? frankly exemplify a desire to be eaten. If the former is a furry concavity, veritably returning labia to lips, the latter is neither less nor differently edible. Not only is the vulviform core of My Nurse enclosed by a leathery mandorla (where the pumps' insteps meet) and framed by linen knickers (the pumps' uppers) but also the whole is served up on a platter. Sexual in form and edible in concept, it would be disingenuous not to read both these objects as "cunningly lingual" to borrow Dianne Chisholm's felicitous phrase.65 Again, some two decades later?as part of the 1959 International Exhibition of Surrealism?the performance of Oppenheim's Spring Banquet engenders another succ?s de scandale. Here, however, rather than serving up a woman's sex as dinner, dinner is laid out buffet-style on a female nude. Still, every such reading has its blind spot: never more so than in the case of female sexual imagery, especially where it is so literally in your face and, moreover, is given by a woman. But that blind spot also makes the question of who's doing the looking, the binding, or (binding meaning) the reading all the more important. Space Like the viciously circular logic of Giacometti's, Duchamp's, and Man Ray's efforts to realize "actual movement," there is a strangely circular logic to Krauss's consideration of virtual movement. As in Denis Diderot's fictional promenades?his projected ruminations on the space of painting, as if both physically inhabiting and even wandering through it?there always inheres in everything the possibility of its being something (or somewhere) else.66 Admittedly, this stream-of consciousness experience of the object?or, as Krauss says, "the extended experience of the viewer who projects his own associations onto ?ts surface"?is exemplary of Surrealist automatism.67 But there also inheres in the object the possibility of its being precisely what it is?and neither anything nor anywhere else. As such, it would instead constitute a snapshot (or an "extra rapid exposure," as Duchamp says) of the object as is:68 65.

"What matters," as Dal? describes the Surrealist object, "is the way in which the experiments revealed the desire for the object, the tangible object."69 Objects such as those by Giacometti, Duchamp, and Man Ray that purposively go nowhere else would seem self-consciously to exemplify the corollary fact of not being anything else?and maybe even to supplant automatism by mesmerism. Oppenheim's fur teacup is the case in point. Although no object can entirely resist what Krauss calls "the circumstantiality of the novel"?that is, whatever chain of free associations the viewer brings with him, and himself projects onto the object?rarely more purposively than in Oppenheim's Object, the novel Breakfast in Fur is not one of her own writing.70 "What amused me," she explains, "was the china and fur contrast as did the metal/fur contrast in the bracelet [that she had recently designed and sold to Elsa Schiaparelli]. This was its idea."71 As with the tendency of the fur bracelet not to protect its wearer from the elements but rather to recreate her as paradoxically hirsute, the fur teacup also plays off fur as a second skin, both representing its use as a covering, yet re-presenting that use as useless, where what the fur covers is already more impermeable, indeed, intractable than the fur itself. However, neither can the fur pelt be compared to a sort of tea cozy, for the fur is not only covering the teacup in this sense but also lining it. Liberated of its use-value as a protecting sheath, in both the bracelet and the teacup, fur is re-presented as pure tactility, as is. Oppenheim's purely formal concept of the object is echoed by the purely nominal title in terms of which she describes it: whether Fur-covered saucer, cup and spoon in particular, or Objectas she describes her "Things, my stuff. The stuff I have made" more generally.72 By redesignating her essentially undesignated Object as D?jeuner en fourrure [Breakfast in Fur], Breton's title constitutes the equal but opposite vector, reconceiving the fur teacup as a cross between Edouard Manet's D?jeuner sur l'herbe [Luncheon on the Grass] (1863) and Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's V?nus ? la fourrure [Venus in Furs] (1870). Although the primacy of the material support in which we imagine ourselves to bodily participate is duly acknowledged by Breton's epithet, the quality of that engagement is no longer literal, but rather?exactly as Krauss describes "the extended experience of the viewer who projects his own associations onto its surface"?metaphorical.73 Breton's title thus refers, not to the china and fur contrast we might touch in and of itself, but like it, the fur wrap of Sacher-Masoch's Venus?and prior to it, the porcelain like skin concealed by that fur wrap, which Manet's Victorine in turn reveals. As we imagine raising the fur teacup or maybe the spoon to our lips, the sheer materiality of the object thus passes from the realm of the generally sensual to that of the specifically erotogenic: in itself, a sexually unspecific rite of passage which D?jeuner en fourrure both metaphorizes and, at once, (en)genders. For Breton, then, it is no longer a question of Oppenheim's purely formal contrast nor, again, of the purely material paradox of raising a furry object to the lips, but like it, its concavity, its furriness. . . . Even so, Oppenheim flatly rejects Breton's title. "The word-games of critics, the power struggles of men! So part of its scandalous appeal was not invented by me," she protests, "I simply made up the object according to the idea. I didn't care about any title at all. I don't really care that it is now known by Breton's title."74 Whereas Breton's word-game is exemplary of what Krauss calls "the circumstantiality of the novel," only Oppenheim's protest reveals the power struggle latent therein. That power struggle is not between Breton's humor (even, perhaps, his sexist humor) and Oppenheim's humorlessness, since it is precisely in a moment of levity, one shared with Rabio Picasso and Dora Maar at the Caf? de Flore, that we find the genesis of the fur teacup. Nor is that power struggle to be found in Breton's efforts expressly to verbalize the female sexual imagery that Oppenheim implicitly visualizes. Rather, it is inherent in the tendency of his metaphorical titles to dissemble the insistent literalness of these objects which 69. Dal?, Collected Writings, p. 237 (my emphasis).

Indeed, Surrealism both privileged metaphor and in some sense even associated it with masculinity, most famously, when Duchamp divides The Large Glass (1915-1923) in two, and analogously contrasts its male/ metaphorical zone at bottom with its female other on top.75 In addition to identifying the lower register with the Bachelors, he doubly distinguishes it in terms of both its anthropomorphic forms and its perspectival rendering. For, just as the Bachelors are mechanomorphic metaphors and, by their bizarre interactions, intended endlessly to generate metaphor in turn, even the pictorial space they inhabit is paradigmatically metaphorical: i.e. perspectival.76 The upper register, by contrast, neither anthropomorphic nor perspectival at all, Duchamp identifies with the Bride and her "immensurability":77 that is, with her absence of "common measure," as Bataille describes his own rejection of metaphor;78 even with the impossibility of her pictorial "transposition."79 As it developed in tandem with Surrealism, Lacanian theory also associates metonymy with the physically proximate mother80?and metaphor, with the loss of that physical proximity: in particular, with the Oedipal interdiction, which is doubly linked to both the separation of the child from the mother, and the development of language and symbolism more generally.81 Or, as Lacan more playfully formulates the idea, the Oedipal "No!" [Non] institutes both the "Name" [Norn] of the father and, by the same logic, every other "noun" [nom], whether proper or improper.82 Unsurprisingly, feminist theory has placed the possibility of an alternative psychoanalytic?one which in some sense precedes metaphor, and instead emphasizes physical proximity and conceptual reflexivity?behind the aegis of the Mother.83 If few objects can be more purposively self-proximate or self-reflexive than Das Paar?this "odd, unisexual pair" which, as Oppenheim describes it, precedes sexual difference?consider the word-game Breton makes of it, and the protest that Oppenheim, once again, launches in turn: When I gave the photographer [Das Paar], the boots were unlaced as if someone had just taken them off. Without asking me, he laced them up again and sent the picture to Andr? Breton. I was furious but since the catalogue for the exhibition at Daniel Cordier's had to go to press right away, Breton titled the work ? d?lacer.84 Conceived as irreducibly immobile?both wedded at the toe, and also "unlaced," "taken off"?the object is reconceived by Breton as virtually dynamic. Just as D?jeuner en fourrure solicits the viewer to envision peeling away the fur wrap of Sacher-Masoch's Venus to reveal Manet's Victor i ne, ? d?lacer displaces the object onto a similar word-game, thereby lending it all the temporality of another striptease, one whose tense is invariably double. For, even as both these epithets solicit the viewer to undress Oppenheim's objects with more than his eyes, they also stage that moment of undressing as a return of the repressed. Salome-like, Breton's titles veil the object in a sort of verbal dance. In this way, they 75.

Of course, following Salome's dance is the head of John the Baptist?the possibility of his castration, which her (really, his) veils serve to attenuate. Breton therefore suspends the lack that the male fetishist associates with the female body both by displacing it onto word-games, then deferring it as a striptease.86 Just as Breton's metaphorical titles would obnubilate the insistent nakedness of Oppenheim's Object and Das Paar, so the sexual symbolism of his fetish would eclipse the material reality of her body. Like the war of words in A Thousand and One Nights, behind which there lurks a battle of the sexes, this power struggle is also between Breton's Scheherazade, whose tales-as-veils simply go on and on, and Oppenheim's Sultan, who vastly prefers the present tense to the future and, in any event, to speak of real, bodily consequences. Breton thus substitutes a specifically sexual paradox?the desire for what the male fetishist perceives to be absent, yet, by displacing and deferring it, can otherwise conceive to be present?for Oppenheim's purely formal/material paradox: in addition to her china and fur contrast, the tendency of her objects, in any utilitarian sense, to be not so much useless as altogether against usefulness. Trussed like a goose or wedded at the toe, her shoes hobble rather than ambulate. Similarly, her Pair of Gloves (1985) is a second skin which peels away the first. Laying bare the circulatory structure of the hand? or, as in Stencil for Gloves (1936), its skeleton?they reveal the very hand they ought to conceal. Her fur teacup, of course, is the stuff of Wonderland, as useful for drinking from as the Mad Hatter's watch for counting down his eternal tea party. Ultimately, in its own way (in a way specific both to its material support and, inextricably, to its usefulness), each of these objects is entrenched in "the world of the body and its needs," as Denis Hollier describes the space of the anti-imaginary museum:87 in the potential satisfaction, yet actual frustration of the very purpose whence leather, suede, and fur?like shoes, gloves, and fur pelts?all spring. Like her shoe objects that would hobble you, her pair of gloves that would flay you, or a hair of her fur teacup that would bite you, although Oppenheim's objects are quintessential^ the stuff of the sexual fetish (including leather, suede, and fur; feet and shoes, etc.), they are no less paradoxical as tokens of defense against male anxiety than they are as utilitarian objects, if all the more perverse. After all, just as her Schiaparelli Bracelet frankly demands whether the wearer's "collar and cuffs" match, the furry concavity of her Object, rather than concealing sexual difference, is quite literally in-your-face, as is the splayed, heels-in-the-air anthropomorphism of My Nurse: her other "cunningly lingual" object from 1936, which Oppenheim both offers as a meal and, again recalling the head of John the Baptist, even serves on a platter.88 Only lack needs to be displaced and deferred. If, however, there is no lack, there is nothing to cover, and the covering perforce is all, as in Oppenheim's Word wrapped in poisonous letters (Becomes transparent) (1970): her object made of hardened polyester string which, divested of contents, ties only itself. Rather than as a voyeur at a striptease, always hoping to catch a little skin later, the viewer is everywhere presented with it now. And, in fact, like the leathery labial soles and lip-like toes of her shoe objects, the suede of her pair of gloves, or the fur of her teacup, skin, in all its varieties, is exactly the medium with which Oppenheim identifies both her artistic practice, and her self-image in particular.89 Because skin would seem to reveal so much for Oppenheim?for whom, even covering sexual difference is not necessarily concealing it?its relationship to the sexual fetish perhaps bears closer scrutiny. Its value as a phallic metaphor notwithstanding, the sexual fetish is at first founded in either of two types of physical proximity 85. Freud, "Fetishism," p. 155. 86. The tendency of Breton's symbolism to veil and, therefore, to defer its signified is the subject of Bataille's anti-symbolist manifesto. Whereas Bataille would pluck the petals of symbolism, revealing "a rather sordid tuft," Breton compares the absurdity of rejecting symbolism to that of flaying the dancer following her dance of the veils.

The first type emphasizes proximity in time: thus, items of clothing that "crystallize the moment of undressing, the last moment in which the woman could still be regarded as phallic," as Freud says. The second type, without regard to any particular moment, instead emphasizes proximity in space, and includes items of clothing, as Freud goes on to explain, like the fig-leaf on a statue, that "cover[] up the genitals entirely and conceal[] the distinction between them. Analysis showed that it signified that women were castrated and that they were not castrated; and it also allowed of the hypothesis that men were castrated, for all these possibilities could equally well be concealed under[neath]."90 Even so, it is only by the deferred action of the phallic metaphor that the time of the first, like the space of the second, is even reconceived as liminal and, thereby, transposed into the moment before the "uncanny and traumatic" one, like the surface above the "covered up . . . and concealed" one.91 But what if there is no such uncanny or traumatic moment to follow, nor any such surface-as-lack to conceal?

Denuded of its raison d'?tre as displacing or deferring a presence?which the male fetishist misrecognizes as an absence?why not veil nothing at all and, in this way, create the sort of covering that in fact uncovers??one that indeed covers nothing (Word Wrapped); that is exactly flayed and turned inside-out (Pair of Gloves); or that manifestly assumes the form and even the texture of the anatomical surface that would otherwise remain latent and concealed (Object, My Nurse). As such, Oppenheim's objects embody the unalloyed truth of the sexual fetish, its "most essential quality," which, as Haim Finkelstein concludes, is its "irreducible materiality," ?ts "status as a material embodiment."92 When Krauss describes objects like Dali's Venus de Milo with Drawers (1936) "as hollow volumes . . . without a structural and static core," I could not more fully agree with her emphasis on surface.93 But why the Surrealist surface should then be transposed into a lack of physical integrity, a lack which is displaced by a sort of narrative plenitude, seems to me as scotomatous as any reading afforded by the phallic metaphor. Metaphor, as Krauss explains, "is produced on the surfaces of the objects, as though [it] supplied a protective coating that can be grafted onto their bodies . . . [and] substituted for the structural element of the object?but instead of acting as a static support, it operates to wed the sculpture with the circumstantial flow of time."94 Consider Jasper Johns's Targets o? the mid- to late-1950s, whose titles are no less blandly descriptive than Oppenheim's Object, yet whose imagery is similarly penetrating (compare figs. 10 and 11). Whereas Breton refuses to let Oppenheim's objects speak for themselves, Johns is taken seriously when he too challenges the symbolism of his objects (as "things the mind already knows") and instead emphasizes their formalism (the room that their very familiarity affords 92. Finkelstein, Art and Writing, p. 167, quoting in part William Pietz, "The Problem of the fetish, I," Res, vol. 9 (Spring 1985), p. 7; see also pp. 10-12, where Pietz discusses Michel Leiris's 1929 article "Alberto Giacometti" (reprinted in Documents [Raris: Jean-Michel Place, 1991], vol. 1, pp. 209-210). 93.

[to] things which are seen and not looked at," as Johns says, presumably the targets and the teacup evoke the corollary failure of sight as well:96 the fact of looking, without actually seeing, that engenders the sexual fetish. In other words, whether his target to be speared, or her teacup to be brought to the lips, both these objects are paradigmatic tokens of male anxiety. Moreover, if the arrow of the one is entirely absent, the relatively diminutive spoon of the other, perhaps phallic, is more typically a Surrealist symbol of the female body. As such, Johns's and Oppenheim's relationship to the sexual fetish is as ambivalent as it is skin-deep. By inextricably bodying forth its anatomical imagery, the "irreducible materiality" of the surface?of Johns's signature practice of encaustic, like Oppenheim's trademark china and fur contrast?must itself be understood "as a material embodiment."97 However, instead of distancing and displacing its anatomical imagery, its emphatic facture suggests a proximity of sight so near as to verge on touch, as critics in both cases have perspicuously observed.98 And, instead of fetishistically deferring its anatomical imagery, both its facture and especially the imagery itself solicit the viewer directly to engage with, and even immediately to penetrate the surface. In both senses, the surface is conceived as a matter, not of covering and concealing the sexual difference of the other as other, but rather of one's own body and proper bodily identity, here and now. Nevertheless, for Krauss, the telltale difference of the Surrealist surface is that, lacking physical integrity, it perforce tells tales. For Breton, too, by imputing time to the Surrealist object, and engendering it as narrative, his striptease sobriquets conceal the very surface that the object would in fact reveal. Either way, the blind spot in these metaphorical readings and word-games is the body from which the sexual fetish turns away, just as the power struggle is between a regime of verbal displacement and one of physical realization: in some sense, between saying what one does not see and feeling what one does or, here, between the critics' beard and the artist's fur. 95.
