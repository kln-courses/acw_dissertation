<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS OF CHRISTIANITY. By John Caird, D. D., LL. D., late Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the Uni- versity of Glasgow, with a memoir by Edward Caird, D. C. L., LL. D., Master of Balliol. Glasgow: James MacLehose &amp; Sons. 2 vols.; pp. cxli., 232; 297. These volumes contain the Gifford Lectures delivered by Prin- cipal Caird at Glasgow in sessions i892-93 and i895-96. They are printed as they were delivered, without' having had the author's revision before publication; but they are not on that account imperfect, except that, if Principal Caird's health had not given way, he might have written two or three additional lectures. The Master of Balliol's brief memoir of his brother is excellently done. Possibly some very fervent admirers of Principal Caird may think that the memoir is too modest, that Mr. Caird has car- ried his fraternal restraint too far; but if that be a fault, it is a good one. A man's fame stands with the impression which is made by his work, and it may well be questioned whether lauda- tion in a biography has ever much value. The memoir gives us the picture of a strong, quiet nature, growing steadily in thought and power, without crisis or turmoil. The life of Principal Caird was that of a great preacher, teacher and administrator, out- wardly uneventful, but ever more and more extensive and deep in its influence. No man in recent times did more to give breadth and sympathy to religious thought in Scotland. As his own spiritual and intellectual development proceeded without any violent breach or turning, and as in doing a revolutionary work he retained a conservative spirit, he was saved from the exaggera- tions in thought and expression which almost inevitably arise</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews. I I I from sharp conflict, and his teaching was broadly constructive and eminently wise. Thorough idealist as he was in his maturity, he was not in his student days laid hold of by philosophy, "at least in any form that strongly influenced his inner life" (p. lxv.). But seeking an idealist basis for theology "as a form of scientific knowledge and not merely as a supernatural revelation," he passed from the study of Kant to an interest in Hegel, determ- ined "mainly by two things: first, by the thoroughness with which he carries out the idealistic principle, and secondly, by the strong grasp of ethical and religious experience, which is, perhaps, Hegel's greatest characteristic" (p. lxxiv.). "As he would have nothing to do with sceptical defences of religion, so he spoke almost with contempt of the various half-way houses that have been built between the position of Kant and a thoroughgoing Idealism, as also of the many attempts of modern theologians to evade the open field of thought and to fall back upon some moral or xesthetic or religious faith, which is not to be explained or criticised by reason." The first fruit of Principal Caird's endeavor to apply idealistic principles to theology was his well-known "Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion," and in these Gifford Lectures, his latest writings, the same line of thought is carried out. "What Green said of the 'Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion,' is true also of them. The line of argument followed is not in the highest sense original; it is in the main Hegelian, though not by any means following Hegel slavishly; the thought has been thorough- ly assimilated and recast in the writer's mind, and is developed with the same lucidity and beauty of expression and fullness of illustration which are characteristic of his other writings" (p. cxxx.). According to the deed of foundation the subject of the Gifford Lectures is natural theology, and to some readers it may appear strange that the "Fundamental Ideas of Christianity" should be regarded as falling within the scope of the lectureship. We are accustomed to think of Christianity as essentially a re- vealed religion; but Principal Caird maintains from the outset that there is no fundamental distinction between natural and revealed religion, and, indeed, that the evidence and value of revealed religion lie in its higher rationality. "There is no such thing as a natural religion or religion of reason, distinct from revealed religion" (I., 23). "If we were to compare the teaching of revelation with that of the so-called natural religion in point</page><page sequence="3">I12 International Journal of Ethics. of accordance with reason and conscience, I unhesitatingly affirm that the former is more profoundly rational, more deeply true to our spiritual intelligence than the latter" (I., i9.). Christian religion and morality do not consist of natural religion and moral- ity with some peculiar doctrines and virtues added: "Christianity is natural religion elevated and transmuted into revealed" (I., 24.). This main principle, laid down by Principal Caird in Lec- ture I., is further elaborated from another point of view in Lecture II., which deals with the relations of "faith and reason." The position of those who maintain the necessity of an initial and intuitive act of faith in all genuine religious experience, a re- sponse not of the head, but of the heart to the spirit of God, is expounded with a fairness and clearness so admirable as to be almost persuasive; but, while it is admitted that we must begin with faith, it is shown that the faith with which we begin is in reality implicit reason. From this standpoint the remaining lectures consider in detail the fundamental ideas of Christianity, its view of God and His relation to the world, its theory of the origin and nature of evil, its system of moral restoration, through the ideas of the Incarna- tion and the Atonement, and its account of the kingdom of the spirit and the future life. The Trinitarian idea of God is de- fended on the grounds that "the highest unity is that which com- bines in itself the elements of unity and difference" (I., 62), and that "regarded as a mere solitary, self-identical infinite, the nature of God would be a stranger to that which is the highest element of a spiritual nature-the element of Love. Without life in the life of others, a spiritual being would not be truly spiritual" (I., 70.). A "solitary, self-sufficient God," having merely the capac- itv of love and other spiritual qualities, "would be only a potential God" (I., 72.). But nature and man. the finite world, cannot be regarded as the adequate medium of the self-revelation of God, (i) because the finite cannot fully express the infinite, and, (2) because "if the finite world were the only medium of the divine self-revelation, it would follow that the nature of God is a pro- gressive ones (I., 75.). "All that unfolds itself progressively in the history of the world" must be regarded as "already com- prehended in the eternal self-revelation of God." The further development of this idea involves a full consideration of the rela- tion of God to the world (Lectures IVT. to VII.). The Pantheist view is expounded so as to show that it exaggerates the unity</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews. I13 between God and the world, while on the other hand, the Deist view is shown to involve too sharp a dualism. Pantheism anniuls the finite world or absorbs it in the infinite, Deism reduces God to a finite, anthropomorphic personality. But these systems are steJls towards the Christian idea, the main elements in which are (I) that infinite Mind or Intelligence constitutes the reality of the world, not simply as its external creator, but as its inward spirit; (2) that by its very nature infinite Mind or Spirit has in it a necessity of self-manifestation to and in a world of finite beings, and (3) that the infinitude of God does not involve the ne- gation of the finite world, but is the principle of the individuality and independence of nature and man (I., 143, 144). The dis- cussion of Pantheism and Deism is clear, suggestive and far from unsympathetic, and the exposition of the Christian view, with its thorough and patient consideration of difficulties, is one of the finest parts of Principal Caird's work. Yet one cannot feel that the difficulties have been quite overcome, and the discussion itself suggests new questions in a way which is doubtless inevitable when we are considering such ultimate problems. If God and man are (as Principal Caird suggests; I., 157 sqq.) members of a relation, in such a way that each necessarily implies the other, does not God become finite? Must we not suppose some greater being, comprehending the relation and both of its members? It is, of course, true that we speak of a relation between whole and part, although the whole includes the part. But in such a case must not both whole and part be taken as abstractions? And, ex hypothesi, God is the concrete. There is, there must be, a way out of the difficulty; but the way remains to be found. It is fundanientallv the same problem that presents itself in the discussion of the origin and nature of evil, which is the other chief subject of these Gifford Lectures. The eighth Lecture con- siders, with admirable lucidity, balance and insight, the Augustin- ian or ecclesiastical theory, the merits and defects of which and of its Pelagian opposite are clearly represented, so as to form an introduction to the more comprehensive discussion in Vol. II. The various theories of the origin of evil are in this volume traced to Pantheist, Deist and Christian views of the relation of God to the world. The theories with a Pantheist basis are those which "virtually evaporate" the existence of evil by making it merely negative or privative and those which trace evil to "the sensuous nature of man," or to the "conflict which necessarily arises be- Vol. XI.-NTo. I 8</page><page sequence="5">114 International Journal of Ethics. tween the flesh and the spirit." The theories which spring from Deist views are those which ascribe the origin of evil to an ab- stract human freedom, a freedom of indifference or something akin to it; while the Christian doctrine of sin follows from "the fundamental principle of Christianity," "that the finite spirit is the necessary organ of the being and life of God, and that this self-revelation" [of God in and to the finite world] "implies in the finite spirit an element of distinction or difference, which contains in it at least the possibility of sin" (II., 4). This ac- count of the Christian doctrine of sin at once suggests, in another form, the difficulty already raised as to the relation of God to man. If God is the absolute Reality and if the finite is not illu- sory, must not the finite spirit, with all its acts and thoughts, be a moment in the life of God? Must not the "element of distinc- tion or difference, which contains in it at least the possibility of sin" be a distinction or difference within the divine unity? And if this is so, it would seem best to take this as the foundation or starting-point of the inquiry and to endeavor to define sin in con- sistency with the principle that it must somehow be comprehended within the Absolute. This method is the strength of the "Pan- theist" position, whatever value we may ascribe to the actual def- initions it offers. The opposite method, which is the more gen- erally followed, begs the question in its anxiety not to ascribe the causality of evil to God. It uncritically assumes as its governing principle a more or less definite theory of the nature of sin, which is the very object of the whole inquiry. It would be untrue to say that Principal Caird's argument rests on such dogmatic pre- suppositions. It is, indeed, remarkably little open to such a charge. And yet one cannot but feel that the definitions or de- scriptions of moral evil which he offers are not quite definite enough, that the question of the ultimate meaning of sin (its meaning in the absolute) remains somewhat in haze. "Goodness is true, badness false or perverted, self-realization." "For a being made in the image of God, sin is selfishness, goodness self-realiza- tion through absolute self-surrender to God" (II., 57). "It is not in the satisfaction of natural desires, but in the fact that it is an infinite nature that is seeking satisfaction in them, that the essence of sin lies" (II., 68). Accepting such statements as these, we still seek to know how, in a perfectly rational universe, "sel- fishness" or "perverted self-realization" is possible and what meaning we must attach to the words. And again one is tempted</page><page sequence="6">Book Reciews. 115 to ask whether there is not a sense in which an infinite nature not only may, but must, seek satisfaction in natural desires, and whether sin or selfishness is not rather to be regarded as seeing things in wrong proportions and acting accordingly? Turning the question round, we might ask: Can there be a human "life spent in the satisfaction of merely natural propensities"? The remaining lectures deal with doctrines (the Incarnation, Atonement, etc.), which belong more to theology proper than to Metaphysics or Ethics; but it is hardly necessary to say that the strong ethical interest of the book is maintained throughout and that the subjects are discussed with the calm, massive reasonable- ness and high spiritual feeling which we find in all Principal Caird's work. Considering the book as a whole, I think it may safely be said that nothing wiser, more fair and more sympathetic has been written regarding the "fundamental ideas of Chris- tianity." R. LATTA.
