<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Mystery, Reality, and the Virtual: The Problem of  Reference in Gordon Kaufman’s Theology Thomas A. James / Union Presbyterian Seminary In a classic article, philosopher William P. Alston argues that nonrealism, “though rampant nowadays even among Christian theologians,” is “sub-versive” of theistic faith.1 Among contemporaries guilty of succumbing  to this philosophical bogey, Gordon Kaufman is singled out as an especially  illuminating example. Alston notes that in the essays that make up God the  Problem, Kaufman makes use of a distinction between the “available referent”  of  theistic language and its “real referent,” the former indicating the actual  object of religious experience and responses, and the latter appearing only as  the “I-know-not-what” that ultimately grounds them. By the time Kaufman  writes In Face of Mystery, Alston suggests, the real referent has dropped out al- together as theologically insignificant, giving way to the language of “mystery.”2  It is not clear that Alston has read the intent of Kaufman’s latter work cor- rectly, however. Indeed, as I will argue here, it is the work embodied in and  proceeding from In Face of Mystery, including clarifications published in In the  Beginning . . . Creativity and Jesus and Creativity, that attempts to bridge the  yawning gap between what he earlier called “the available” and the “real.” In  order to see this, I suggest, it is crucial to avoid prejudicing beforehand what is  to be taken as the content of  the real. In other words, Alston’s criticism holds  only if  God must be taken as a discrete (and probably person-like) entity that  can be singled out from among others—a notion that is at least problematic  within even the most orthodox strands of theistic tradition. It is just this speci- fication that Kaufman disavows in order precisely to resolve the problem of  reference in a broadly intelligible way.  In this essay I will consider Kaufman’s efforts on this topic alongside the  more forthrightly realistic but also highly revisionary theology of  Bernard  Meland and the nonrealist theology of  Charley Hardwick. I will make a  case that Kaufman’s constructivism and Meland’s empirical realism are both  forms of  what I will call “indirect” reference, where theological language  is realistically reinterpreted by means of  substantial revisions in content.  1.

Both theologians, we will see, utilize the notion of  divine “mystery” not just  as vague hand waving but deliberately and precisely both to critique literal,  direct references to God and to warrant departures from them. That neither  of  them is nonrealist will be evident from their deep differences with respect  to Charley Hardwick’s theology.  After making such a case, I will argue that both Kaufman and Meland fail to  carry this project of indirect reference through adequately, however: Kaufman  in the end fails to specify what he means by God’s reality as distinct from gen- eralizations about world processes; and Meland comes very close to collapsing  divine reality into a discrete object that impinges, however mysteriously, on  the subject. Though Kaufman’s more recent work strives for realism on the  issue of reference, then, he doesn’t achieve it; and though Meland’s theology is  attentive to mystery, it verges on a direct if  not quite literal description insofar  as it traces the lines of causal efficacy back to a discrete, identifiable object. So,  Kaufman and Meland jointly outline a dilemma for projects that attempt to  hold to indirect reference: is God identifiable as an ontologically distinct being,  or is God transcendent mystery, beyond the presence-to-hand that character- izes individual identifiability? Indirect reference tries to hold somehow to both  horns of the dilemma, to insist that God is a reality but to resist reification,  but it is not immediately clear how this can be done. In the final section of the  essay, I will briefly develop the outline of a constructive response that seeks to  resolve the difficulties of both constructivist and empirical realist theologies  by interposing a concept drawn from a strand of process thinking (i.e., Henri  Bergson) and developed by thinkers like Gilles Deleuze and Mark C. Taylor  more recently: the concept of the virtual. I can summarize this response at this  point in terms of a thesis for the present essay as a whole: theological refer- ence may be construed as indirect insofar as “God” is taken to refer neither  to an identifiable actuality (i.e., an object of perception or prehension), nor to  the world as a whole (or one of its features) taken in a certain, “pious” way,  but rather to the virtual real—i.e., to the infinite source of being out of which  discrete actualities arise and into which they pass away. Reference is indirect,  therefore, insofar as it is reference not to an actuality, but to a virtuality. Simply  put, God is the virtual.  As we will see, Kaufman as well as Meland offers pointers in this direction,  even if  neither fully arrives. Throughout In Face of Mystery and subsequent  writings, Kaufman is not unaware of the problem of reference within a program  that denies the straightforward realism espoused by Alston. In order to address  it, he labors diligently to support a clear distinction between reference and what  </page> <page sequence="3"> 260 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy he calls “reification.” In what follows, I will argue that, because Kaufman now  wants to reject the anthropomorphism of classical theism while maintaining its  referentiality, he holds that one can construe theology as a genuinely informa- tive series of statements without regarding its imagery of God as agent as an  adequate conceptuality for that to which it refers.3 The shift that allows him  to maintain this involves taking creator language to refer to the cosmic and  evolutionary processes that have eventuated in and sustained human life, rather  than to a supremely powerful and transcendent agent. When theistic language  is taken in the latter sense, he argues, its internal logic is violated, resulting in  the logical as well as theological error of reification.  For Kaufman, the concept of God as it is borne by traditional theistic dis- course and practice is unique in that its predicates are more logically primitive  than is the subject itself. God, unlike objects of our experience, is not known  directly, but only by means of an imaginative/constructive extrapolation. So,  for example, the early Hebrew idea of God was not known first “in himself”  and then subsequently discovered to be a liberator—rather, the Israelites ex- perienced liberation, and then constructed a concept of God in order to rep- resent the power through which liberation occurs. To take the concept God as  referring to a discrete object of the type that may in principle be perceived is a  logical mistake, which has often been made in theistic tradition but which also  for that very reason has been carefully guarded against. This is what Kaufman  means by “reification.”  Readers of Feuerbach will recognize a familiar cast to Kaufman’s argument.  The implications, however, are quite different. It is not humanity itself  that is  the real referent of theistic language. In fact, rather than plunging deeper in  search of the real object of worship and veneration, Kaufman’s analysis invites  a lingering on the surface and a suspicion of hermeneutical depths. It is the  quite evident cosmic and historical activity of  liberation (or, for Kaufman,  humanization) that is to be attended to and to which theological significance  is to be given, not to a human-like figure, which popular theism often supposes  to be behind the curtain, nor to a human nature, which is alleged to be the  real object of worship expressed in theistic language. In other words, theistic  language is best taken as indicative of a distinctive human orientation toward  objectively real cosmic and historical processes that are outside of  human  control and that actually enfold human life.  Of course, there are good reasons to scrutinize the account of reference op- erative in Kaufman’s distinction between reference and reification. As Alston’s  3. Gordon D. Kaufman, In Face of Mystery: A Constructive Theology (Cambridge, MA:  Harvard University Press, 1993), 330–31. </page> <page sequence="4">  Volume 33, No. 3, September 2012 261 criticisms show, many theists are not content simply to maintain that God talk  helps believers to see the world in a particular way. We likely want to know not  only about the possibility of taking reality as created and ordered but about  the objective reality of that which enacts creation and ordering. If  theological  language cannot be reified, if  there is no literal object that corresponds to its  language about cosmic creativity, no additional entity that is identified by it,  can it indeed be taken as referential? This is not a challenge to be dismissed  lightly, even if  we grant (as I think we ought) that anthropomorphic, reifying  solutions are to be avoided.  In the balance of this paper, I will wrestle with Alston’s challenge first by  comparing Kaufman’s treatment of the issue of reference with two other revi- sionary projects in theology that also resist literal, reifying interpretations of  theistic language and thus refuse to claim direct reference for it, and then by  attempting to expose the inadequacies of all three efforts and proposing a way  forward. Briefly put, I will suggest that these positions may be characterized  according to whether they regard theistic language as (1) a vague approximation  of a reality that cannot be comprehended in terms of finite conceptual capaci- ties, and therefore at best indirectly referential (Meland); as (2) nonreferential  but nonetheless cognitive (Hardwick); or as (3) a construction of categories  to sort experiences along particular interpretive lines, so that the reference to  divine reality is tied to an account of the world (Kaufman). I. Empirical Realism One such way of underwriting the reference of talk about God is to defend a  strong version of philosophical realism as a basis for theology. Process thought,  especially in the “empirical realist” variety exemplified by Bernard Meland4 and  others in the early- to mid-twentieth-century Chicago school, offers a general  account of experience as the basis for justifying recourse to theological language.  Experience is generated, it is claimed, by the impingement of various kinds of  causal efficacy upon the subject. Descriptive language about the world and  about entities within it may not properly be said to correspond to ready-made  facts. Rather, such language abstracts from and conceptualizes the causal effica- cies that are “felt” or “prehended” by the subject below the level of conscious  reflection. Importantly, it is not just objects that impinge upon the subject but  relations between them, as well as relations between objects and the knowing  subject. Together, these objects and real relations impinging on the subject form  a “structure of experience” that shapes or orients persons and communities and  4. Bernard Meland, Fallible Forms and Symbols: Discourses on Method in a Theology of  Culture (Philadelphia, PA: The Fortress Press, 1996). </page> <page sequence="5"> 262 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy points to the “creative passage,” Meland’s evocative shorthand for the everlast- ing series of interactions between God and the world.  According to process thought, “God” is the name we give to the supreme causal  efficacy within experience, the power that presents the past to our awareness in  ordered or “graded” fashion and presents live options for our own activity that  are biased toward the realization of greater value.5 Language about God or about  divine action therefore distills a prereflective awareness of divine efficacy that is  universally present within experience. Its intelligibility does not depend simply  upon its power to illumine but is grounded in its adequacy to those modes of  experience it conceptualizes—“prehensions” of ordering or luring, for example.  Theology, like any other putatively cognitive enterprise, is understood as descrip- tive of an object. It describes a being whose pervasive ordering and luring efficacy  is empirically known, even if it is not physically perceived.  There are two senses in which God may be understood as ineluctably be- yond the purview of rational thought (i.e., as “mystery”) in empirical realism,  however. First of all, God is conceptually elusive in the way all components  of  experience are. According to empirical realism, there is always a “more”  to experience that eludes articulation.6 This “more” is a function of the deep  interrelations between all beings. To know an object fully is to know it in its  relations, and these inevitably extend beyond the limits imposed by our finite  capacity to conceptualize. Secondly, the inexhaustibleness of  the particular  object described by theological language warrants talk about divine mystery.  God is, as we will see, “vast” and “subtle” in comparison with ordinary objects  of our experience, and so is beyond the possibility of conceptualization in a  unique way.  A couple of points may be lifted out for special attention here. First, there  is a limit to precision in descriptive language about God, since it cannot do  full justice to the impingement of divine causal efficacy upon experience. Nev- ertheless, secondly, the reference is to a real being. Such language does not  merely describe a state of  consciousness as conditioned but the reality that  does the conditioning. The empirical realist approach to the issue of reference,  we may say, is to regard the reference of theological language as real insofar  as it is rooted in the causal efficacy of God’s impingement upon experience,  but ineluctably indirect in so far as theistic language is a sort of approximation  to a reality that cannot be conceptually comprehended. The promise of this  5. Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology (New York: The  Free Press, 1969), 405–12. 6. Meland bespeaks this sense of mystery in his rhetoric of “the mystery of existing.” Meland,  Fallible Forms and Symbols, 41–58. </page> <page sequence="6">  Volume 33, No. 3, September 2012 263 approach is that it can provide a nonsupernaturalist philosophical groundwork  for analogical speech about God. The efficacy of divine agency, though vastly  broader in scope, can be viewed as like the efficacy of lesser causalities.7 This  provides grounds for maintaining that theological language is to be taken re- alistically. Though we cannot grasp God as if  God were an ordinary empirical  object, we can have at least a vague presentiment of  a “more” that inhabits  human experience.  The problem, from the point of  view of Kaufman’s theology, is that vague- ness is not a sufficient basis for capturing the emphasis upon divine mystery  that characterizes the classical use of  the word “God” in the Western tradi- tions. The identification of  “mystery” with the “penumbra of  meaning”8 that  cannot be fully conceptualized, to put the point more strongly, threatens to  reduce God’s otherness to our experience to a merely quantitative otherness.  To illustrate this point, we may consider the way Meland, in Faith and Culture,  expands upon his notion of God as a “transcendent structure of meaning and  sensitivity.” He writes, “God stands to man as one structure of meaning stands  to another. This is the import of  the father-son imagery. The actuality here is,  I believe, a matrix of  sensitivity and meaning of  subtle and vast dimensions,  transcending our own, in fact all human structures, which serves as the ultimate  ground of our meaning and the source and center of  all that we are and of  whatever we might become in the mystery of  creation and re-creation.”9 To  be sure, there is a qualitative distinction between God and creatures that is  preserved in the second half  of the above quotation: the language of “ultimate  ground” and “source and center” seems clearly to indicate as much. However,  we are given pause by the force of  Meland’s personalist (i.e., “father-son”)  analogy: God and human beings are each instances of  something called a  “structure of  meaning,” the former being comparatively “vast” and “subtle”  in relation to the other. To put the relation between God and creature this way  is to place them on a scale in which they are measured and measurable by an  external standard—this, it seems, is precisely to render God’s transcendence  of  the creature quantitative.  The restrictions upon God’s availability to human experience, we find, is  not of God’s radical, qualitative otherness but merely of the limited range of  7. Schubert M. Ogden’s account of  divine activity in terms of  “self-constituting” acts is  another example of a process conceptuality being put into the service of a renewed analogi- cal thinking about divine action.

For Kaufman, this way of accounting for mystery language in classical the- istic piety misconstrues its logic. The “mystery” bespoken in classical God  talk is not an empirical datum, according to Kaufman, but a rule or principle  indicating that theological language is always inadequate to its object, and  thereby forbidding us to say or imply that we know too much about its refer- ent.10 One should not overstate the practical difference here, of  course: for  both Kaufman and Meland, “mystery” is a way of pointing to the limitations  of human knowing with respect to the divine. However, the difference is nev- ertheless metaphysically significant: for Meland, God cannot be identified in  a straightforward, literal way, but is still identifiable as a discrete object that  is described, however inadequately, by theistic language. It is the account of  theistic language as descriptive that is rejected by Kaufman: such an account  “reifies,” however vaguely.  The problem Kaufman finds in Meland’s program may be resolved by sur- rendering the notion of God as a distinct being. Meland actually comes close  to doing this in Fallible Forms and Symbols, where he links God with “creative  passage,” which in turn is connected with “ground of being.”11 Thinking of  God as “ground” of  being, recalling Tillich, is far different from and even  quite critical of  the idea of God as a being.12 However, this line of  thought  is not pursued. If  it were, God could be construed as the creative passage (or  simply “creativity”) as such, and he would be much closer to Kaufman. How- ever, it is not clear how such a line of  thought could be pursued in Meland  without threatening the clarity with which he holds to the reality of God as  an identifiable object of experience. Creativity, quite simply, does not seem to  be an object. That is perhaps why, most often, Meland follows Whitehead in  identifying God as a participant—albeit a unique one!—in creativity rather  than as creativity as such. Later, I will suggest that Kaufman’s taking of this  path raises such equal and opposite difficulties. 10. Kaufman, In Face of Mystery, 60ff.

Theology as “Seeing-as” Empirical realism, though in a far more sophisticated fashion than naively  realistic interpretations of classical theism, takes theological language as ba- sically descriptive, or at least “directive.”13 A danger that attends this way of  understanding theology, I have indicated, is that the object of religious language  will be reduced to the level of other, empirical objects. The rest of this paper will  attempt to place Kaufman’s own work within the context of a second general  approach to the problem of reference in modern theology: an approach that  construes theology not as descriptive but as the articulation of what we may  call, following Julian Hartt, “construing” beliefs.14  According to this approach, theological language is not descriptive or asser- tive: it does not make predications about a particular being. Rather, theology  is understood as trafficking in meta-assertions. Though a descriptive surface  grammar is employed, what is actually meant is that the speaker is adopting  a particular type of  self-understanding. This interpretation of  theological  language as meta-assertive, however, does not settle the question about the  cognitive status of  theology. In some versions of  this approach, God talk  may indicate a kind of  self-understanding that is either true or false.15 The  important point for theology as “seeing-as,” however, is that these cognitive  claims are implicit in meta-assertive language and are not simply to be read  off  of  its surface grammar that appears, like ordinary descriptive language,  to make predications about a distinct object. Valuational theism One variety of  this approach to theistic language is exemplified in Charley  Hardwick’s “valuational theism.”16 Citing the theology of Henry Nelson Wie- 13. In Fallible Forms and Symbols, Meland draws a distinction between “description” and  “direction,” insofar as the latter refuses to reduce its referent to mere “data” that can be  exhausted in description. The distinction, however, seems once again to be quantitative— no object can be exhaustibly described, once we take into account the potential infinity of  relations in which it is embedded. The problem is that saying that theological language is  “directive” still construes reference in terms of an identifiable object. 14. Julian N. Hart, “Encounter and Inference in Our Awareness of God,” The God Experi- ence: Essays in Hope, ed. Joseph P. Whalen (New York, Newman Press, 1971), 49. 15. I will not be addressing noncognitive “seeing-as” approaches to theistic langauge in this  paper. For an example of these, see R. B. Braithwaite, “An Empiricist’s View of the Nature  of Religious Belief,” in The Philosophy of Religion, ed. Basil Mitchell (Oxford: Oxford Uni- versity Press, 1971), 72–91. 16. Charley D. Hardwick, Events of Grace: Naturalism, Existentialism, and Theology (Cam- bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996). </page> <page sequence="9"> 266 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy man as a prototype, Hardwick contrasts this “valuational” theism from the  metaphysical type of theism that dominates the Western religious traditions.  While the metaphysical type attaches theistic faith to certain characteristic  claims about the nature or structure of the world, valuational theism requires  no particular metaphysical commitments. This is because, for a valuational  theist, apparently assertive language about God can be interpreted as a series  of meta-assertions about a particular valuational stance or posture. Apparent  descriptions of divine creative activity, for example, can be taken as indications  of commitment to a value or range of values enjoining self-giving or gratitude.  One of the things that makes Hardwick’s program distinctive, however, is that  he claims that the meta-assertive nature of theological language does not preju- dice the question of its cognitive status. Unlike the view of R. B. Braithwaite,  which it faintly echoes, Hardwick’s view does not take the claim that constru- ing theological language indicates a moral posture to require consigning it to  the class of noncognitive declarations of preference. Rather, theistic language  may be regarded as in fact true or false, depending upon the possibility of it  satisfying two criteria: (1) first, the values it invokes must be true ones, and (2)  secondly, the way of framing them or situating them in an overall interpreta- tion of  human life characteristic of  theistic language must be defensible as  the correct way.  Obviously, these criteria raise difficulties of their own. The first relies upon  a realistic account of moral values, which may be nearly as controversial as the  metaphysical demands of classical theism. The second criterion raises questions  about how to go about adjudicating between diverging moral and religious  vocabularies characteristic of  differing cultural traditions. Hardwick admits  that these are large and difficult questions but argues that headway can be  made toward resolving them and that this sets the agenda for an account of  theological language that is cognitive, even though it does not refer.  Such claims may of  course be disputed. But the important point for our  purposes is that the nonreferential character of  valuational theism detaches  it from any particular view of  the nature and structure of  the world. This  means not only that meaningful God talk does not require the support of  a  supernaturalistic framework but also that it is freed from the need of support  by a revisionary approximation of  it, such as process philosophy provides.  Hardwick’s theology, in fact, embraces a physicalist version of philosophical  naturalism that categorically denies three of  the claims of  traditional theism  that most revisionary theologians seek to retain, albeit in somewhat altered  form: (1) a personal God who disposes the world, (2) teleology, and (3) the  conservation of  value. Since valuational theism entails a valuational stance  rather than a view of the world, Hardwick argues, it is neutral with respect  </page> <page sequence="10">  Volume 33, No. 3, September 2012 267 to these traditionally momentous questions, and is therefore compatible with  a negative resolution of them.17 Not only does “God” not refer to a distinct  object, but it does not entail any beliefs about the world, either.  In order to assess valuational theism, we need to ask what functional role  supernaturalist metaphysical frameworks have played in theistic faith, and  whether Hardwick’s valuational rendering adequately fulfills it. Hardwick’s  argument that supernaturalistic patterns of belief  can be stripped away from  theism without significant loss to its existential or religious import clearly as- signs them the role of unfortunate metaphysical accretion to theistic religious  tradition. Guided by the demythologizing program of  Rudolph Bultmann,  Hardwick sees theistic faith as a matter of existential self-interpretation that  is only distracted by attempts to characterize the nature and structure of the  world.18 The loss of supernaturalism, in this view, is no real defeat for authentic  theistic faith but an opportunity to reclaim or to reassess its genuine significance  for human life.  It may fairly be asked whether this account of supernaturalism, however, does  justice to the positive role it plays in classical theism. Kaufman’s interpretation,  for its part, is more generous. For him, the “two-story” metaphysical framework  that supports God talk in its traditional forms functions to specify or interpret  the normative content of theistic language, which includes both “immanent”  and “transcendent” emphases. More about Kaufman’s understanding of the  logic of theism will follow, but here it needs to be emphasized that the question  at issue between them is whether God talk does not require some functional  equivalent to supernaturalism in order to serve its classical orienting purpose.  If  the concept of “God” involves a firm sense of a reality objective to ourselves  and independent of our own imagination and self-interpretation, its intelligibil- ity may require some way of specifying the relation of this reality to the rest  of our experience. For Kaufman, as for many theists, Hardwick’s attempt to  salvage God talk in a nonreferential mode cannot retrieve the full significance  and meaning of theistic belief. Constructivism Kaufman’s own position is, like Hardwick’s, an interpretation of theology as  “seeing-as.” Like valuational theism, Kaufman’s theological constructivism  criticizes the commonsense interpretation of theistic language as descriptive  of  a discrete object. Both, as I have emphasized already, take theology as a  17. Hardwick, Events of Grace, 8ff. 18. Ibid., 104–14. </page> <page sequence="11"> 268 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy series of  meta-assertions indicating a particular posture or orientation to- ward the world. The sentence, “God is love,” for example, is not taken as a  straightforward predication but as an indication that the speaker has adopted  an agape-privileging attitude toward life. Unlike Hardwick’s valuational the- ism, however, Kaufman’s constructivism seeks to render an interpretation of  theistic language that includes reference to objective reality. Kaufman regards  the agape-privileging attitude as in need of  justification beyond that which  can be derived from a successful defense of agapeistic values. What is needed  to support an agapeistic form of life, for Kaufman, is an interpretation of the  world according to which other-regarding behavior is itself  supported and  encouraged by some kind of cosmic and/or historical moral ordering.  For constructivism, although theistic categories do not name specific objects,  they do frame the believer’s perception of the world in distinctive and perhaps  controversial ways. Like the intellectual categories of Kant’s first Critique, the- istic language orders or sorts the multitude of raw sense perceptions that are  found in human experience. The theist does not have unique experiences of God  or unusual insight into a pervasive but ill-understood, prethematic awareness  of divine efficacy. The world as known by the theist, in fact, is composed of the  same sorts of experiences as those that form the world as known by nontheists.  The theist sorts the same data differently, however, resulting in a distinctive  overall interpretation of the world—as, for example, creative activity oriented  toward the human good.  This kind of “seeing-as,” it is important to note, requires interaction with  general reflections upon the nature and character of the world, and even with  particular empirical findings about the way the world works. The concept of  God as a sorting or ordering device that helps orient human experience and  action necessarily functions as part of  an overall interpretation of the context  of human life. The concept of “God,” we might say, is logically dependent upon  a working view of  the world with which it must cohere. Kaufman suggests  that there are world views that are fundamentally at odds with the logic of  God talk. In In Face of Mystery, a number of rationally noncoercible choices  are suggested en route to Kaufman’s reconstruction of Christian belief. One  of  these is to view the world as dynamic or processive rather than as static  structure. The latter, he argues, makes it impossible to construe the world as  an arena in which benevolent purposes are being carried out.19 Interestingly,  the materialistic or reductively physicalist view of the world that has gained in  popularity in modern thought is viewed by Kaufman as an example of seeing  the world as static structure and therefore as a serious roadblock to theistic  19. Kaufman, In Face of Mystery, 251ff. </page> <page sequence="12">  Volume 33, No. 3, September 2012 269 faith. Part of Kaufman’s justification for recourse to theistic language, there- fore, must involve an attempt to show (1) that a materialistic/structural view  of  the world is not strictly required by modern knowledge and experience,  and (2) that there are in fact some reasons for preferring a view that stresses  dynamism and contingency, as does theism. So, while Hardwick’s version of  theology as “seeing-as” frees him from the requirement of articulating a theistic  worldview, allowing him to adopt even the most ostensibly hostile metaphysic,  Kaufman’s constructivism requires him to show how theistic categories enable  the believer to sort human experiences in such a way that our place in the world  is adequately accounted for.  One reason I am calling Kaufman’s theology “constructivist” is that he re- gards the justifications for recourse to theistic language to be multiple and of  diverse kinds, rather than built upon a single foundation. God talk is inevitably  cobbled together from an array of experiential resources for the purpose of  orienting human life, and the appropriate means for assessing it are therefore  coherentist and pragmatic. Does the concept of God help genuinely to orient  us in the world, coherently drawing our multifarious experiences and insights  into a unity so that we can respond with purpose and resolve? To answer this  question in the affirmative requires achieving a “broad reflective equilibrium”  (to borrow a phrase from John Rawls) between modern knowledge, human  experience, and religious insight, involving attention to a wide variety of argu- ments and evidence. What I am emphasizing here is that Kaufman’s coherentist  mode of justification entails that not only must the normative posture incul- cated by theistic language be defensible but the view of the world as governed  by benevolent divine purpose must be reconcilable with the best evidence we  have about the nature and character of the world.  This constructivist account of theistic language, I believe, provides grounds  for claiming an indirect reference for theology. To be sure, it does not construe  talk about God as referring in the normal way, appealing to an object that is  directly identified and subsequently described by various predicates or attri- butes. As Kaufman argues, theistic language is borne initially out of series of  predicates, not out of experiences or encounters with an object. Originally and  directly, “God” indicates the human decision to take mundane (though com- munally momentous) experiences of dependence, liberation, and redemption  as disclosures of the character of the world.20 These decisions are sedimented  in narratives of creation, preservation, and redemption. The narrative structure  of sacred theistic texts captures the drama of being preserved and redeemed,  but when the agent language that characterizes this structure is taken as an  20.

Nevertheless, since confidence that human well-being is rooted in reality is  not compatible with just any conceivable experience or with just any possible  general account of the world, constructivist appropriations of theistic language  may be said to refer in a nontrivial sense. Talk about God as “Creator,” for  example, is warranted in part by observations that significant novelty occurs,  that nature and history are not simply an eternal return of  the same. If  we  wish to be careful to avoid the reification of creator language, we can perhaps  justifiably speak, as Kaufman does, about God as the “serendipitous creativity”  that pervades the universe.  What is important to note about this sort of concept, however, is that it does  not refer simply to trends or movements within the world, or to the universe as  a whole. Indeed, the referent of “creativity” is difficult in principle to fix. There  are identifiable instances in which creativity occurs, certainly, but it is hard to  know how to think about what the real referent of “creativity” itself  could be  like. The concept of “Creativity” has a different sort of referential logic than  agent language such as the term “Creator,” because its function is to indicate  a way of conceptually unifying an array of events going on in the world. It is,  one might say, a type without a token. When taken as an object of devotion,  its power is not to name objects but to gather together the various occasions of  novelty that we identify in the world into a unity, while prohibiting any single  one of them from serving as the sole representative of the type. For Kaufman,  the puzzling quality of concepts like these is an advantage to theology: by it they  signify the mystery of God, providing a strong defense against idolatry while  also allowing theistic language to be taken as about the world we experience.  Put in terms of the problem being addressed here, they allow theistic language  to refer to something objectively real, and yet not reducible to any particular  arena or object within the world, or to the world as a whole.  So to what, in the final analysis, does “God” refer in Kaufman’s constructiv- ist theology? By aligning “God” with tokenless concepts such as “creativity,”  I have suggested, Kaufman makes it impossible to fix a direct reference. In  a sense, at most we can say that the “real” God is an “unknown X,” made  conceptually available only by means of tokenless metaphors and images that  are used to gather an array of human perceptions, ideas, and values. But the  fact that these images are about something that is really going on in the world,  and that they therefore require some interaction with what we know about it,  warrants the claim that terms such as “creativity” refer to what has classically  been called God’s work ad extra, or divine activity. Theistic language, there- </page> <page sequence="14">  Volume 33, No. 3, September 2012 271 fore, refers to the mysterious reality operative within this activity or working.  Though perhaps more reserved than many theists prefer, this way of dealing  with the issue of reference in theology does have obvious resonances with the  claim of many classical theists that God is not known “in himself” but only  through “his works.”  Still, it is far from clear that this sort of indirection is sufficient to specify what  it means to say that God is real. God, in Kaufman’s view, ceases to be identifi- able as a discrete reality, so that his “seeing-as” threatens to become merely  pious interpretation. The world is explained on the basis of finite causes operat- ing through natural laws, etc., but I “take” the world in a certain way—e.g., as  “gracious” or “creative.” Granted that such interpretations are warranted, how  do they in turn warrant the notion that God is real? Normally, reality claims  have to have what we might call “cash value”—the reality identified makes a  tangible difference in the overall structure of the world rather than simply a  different attitude toward the world as a whole.  The problem raised by analysis of these three theologians can be put thus:  provided that one wants to adopt a sort of nonreifying but nevertheless “meta- physical” theism that holds to God as a distinct reality vis-à-vis the world, at  least two possibilities suggest themselves: (1) one may identify God as a discrete  actual being who impinges on but is never captured within experience—but,  in so doing, reducing God to “mere” objective status; or (2) one may refuse  reification by taking theological language as meta-assertive—but, in so doing,  undermining the ontological independence and therefore identifiability of the  referent and thus evacuating reference of its “cash value.” Is there a way around  this impasse? III. The Divine Virtual I conclude this essay with a suggestion that Kaufman’s constructivist program,  and Meland’s empirical realism as well, may be strengthened by a broader way  of conceptualizing the real. A way to do this is to refuse to collapse the real  into actual (existing) states of affairs. Drawing from Henri Bergson and Gilles  Deleuze, we may ask what constitutes or conditions actual states of  affairs  along with their transitory character. What is it that is astir amidst the actual?  What accounts for its dynamism, its contingency? The concept that Deleuze  adduces to answer this question is that of the “virtual.” Though Bergson often  considers the virtual and the real as distinct,21 there is no reason to withhold  21. See, for example, Henri Bergson, Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics, trans.  Mabelle L. Andison (Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, 2007), 73–86; and Gilles Deleuze, Dif- ference and Repetition, trans. Paul Patton (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994), 78. </page> <page sequence="15"> 272 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy ontological affirmation of that which constitutes actuality from within, even  if  it is not itself  actual. In Difference and Repetition, in fact, Deleuze affirms  that the real and the virtual are not opposed, but rather the virtual and the  actual: “We [earlier] opposed the virtual and the real: although it could not  have been more precise before now, this terminology must be corrected. The  virtual is opposed not to the real but to the actual. The virtual is fully real is so  far as it is virtual. Exactly what Proust said of states of resonance must be said  of the virtual: ‘Real without being actual, ideal without being abstract’; and  symbolic without being fictional. Indeed, the virtual must be defined as strictly  a part of the real object.”22 Consider, for instance, the phenomenon of time.  In Bergson, time is not a series of discrete moments but a duration in which a  present is constituted by internal relations among an array of “present pasts.”  The past is not actual—it doesn’t exist, properly speaking. Only the present  exists. However, the notion of “present past” indicates that the past is virtu- ally present, and indeed operative, within the present, which alone is actual.23  That is to say, the present represents an actualization of that which was only  latent (unactualized) in the present past. Now, a present is not determined by  these latencies. The present past does not “push” with inexorable force: rather,  a present is always selective of its actualization of both elements from the past  and novel elements that have not been actualized before. That is to say, a pres- ent always selectively embodies what is retained in a virtual store of memories.  But, what is the basis of  its selectivity? How can the past present fail to be  inexorable in its determination of an actual present? It is not only the actual  that is “remembered” but also the infinite array of past presents that were not  actualized but that continue to impinge on the present as potentialities to be  grasped. In this way, the present is not a mechanical effect produced by the  past but an expression of the potentials that are virtually present in its present  past. The virtual presence of the past, we might say, is a power that orients the  present without determining it. It is a power, but it is not a concrete, quantifi- able, reified “force,” and certainly not an actual being. Only beings determine;  the virtual orients—and, in orienting, is itself  expressed.  Key to the metaphysic here of  course is the privileging of becoming over  being, dynamics over stasis, which would be in sync with the direction of both  Kaufman’s and Meland’s programs. The world, in the view I am suggesting, is  not an expression of the same or the identical, a static divine being, but of an  22. Deleuze, Difference and Repetition, 208–209. Italics original. 23.

The actual is an aggregate of  states of affairs that obtain in a given moment of time, that which arises out  of the combining, differentiating, and recombining of virtualities or potentials  flowing within the present past that attends each moment or event. That out  of which a world arises, its creative matrix, is not actual, then, but virtual. It  is this creative virtual, a dimension of the real that holds together eternally  self-differentiating singularities or forces of present past and present future,  which we might identify as God.  A defense of this notion would require far more space that is available here,  but we may at least (1) indicate that such a notion fits well with Kaufman’s  and Meland’s overall programs, and (2) make a case that it resolves the prob- lem of indirect reference with which they both struggle, I have argued, with  only partial success. First, the virtual bears striking similarities both to what  Kaufman means by “creativity” and to what Meland means by “creative pas- sage.” In Kaufman and Meland, creativity/creative passage is (1) the source  or creative ground of  all reality but (2) not identifiable as a discrete, actual  object or entity. Creative passage is less a discrete being or set of beings than  the environment or milieu of becoming in which entities emerge and perish.  Similarly, the virtual represents the milieu of potentiality, which generates the  world but is not identifiable with it.  But in addition, the concept of  the virtual avoids the problems we have  identified with “creativity” and with “creative passage.” With respect to “cre- ativity,” the virtual provides an identity, or a “what,” that specifies a dimen- sion of  the real to which creativity may refer. “Creativity” need not then be  understood simply as a pious way of  construing the world as a whole but as  a way of  pointing to or identifying a real flux of  potentials or powers that  are the conditions of  possibility for actual states of  affairs. (Virtual) creativ- ity would remain tokenless in the sense that it is not a concrete instance of  anything but rather the array of  potentials that are astir in such instances.  And yet, as the virtual, it need not be reduced to a type, a constructed form  imposed on the actual by means of the metaphysical imagination. The idea of  “God” imaginatively holds together a plurality or a multiplicity, but it holds  together that which belongs together ontologically—i.e., it holds together a  dimension of  the real that is identifiably distinct from concrete, actual states  of  affairs (i.e., from the “world”).  With respect to Meland’s concept of  “creative passage,” we have already  noted the ambiguity in his use of  the term: at times it seems to refer to the  matrix of events in which God participates, and at others it appears to refer  to the divine being itself. In so far as Meland veers toward the former, he risks  </page> <page sequence="17"> 274 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy reification. In so far as he moves toward the latter, on the other hand, he invokes  the same set of difficulties faced by Kaufman, though his position actually ends  up being more readily amenable to the virtual insofar as his process ontology  is already a way to specify the identity of God as distinct from and yet deeply  related to the world. All we have to do to avoid the threat of reification is to  substitute the Bergsonian concept of the virtual for both of the Whitehead- ian notions of a primordial and consequent nature of God. I suggest that it is  the Whiteheadian duality within God that haunts process theology and that  threatens reification: the flow of  reciprocal influence between God and the  world (i.e., between the primordial nature’s influence upon the world on the  one hand and the world’s influence on the consequent nature on the other)  is what casts God as a mere participant in a process and thus reduced to the  status of a concrete entity—a mere “being” among others. This is what worried  Kaufman, and worries me. The relationship between the virtual and the actual,  by contrast, is unilateral. The actual world is not understood under the aspect  of causality—it is neither determined nor determining. Rather, it is a series of  surface effects of the deep, eternal play of the virtual. Expression rather than  causality becomes the model for understanding God’s relation to the world:24  God as the virtual is neither a participant in the process nor the process as  a whole configured under a certain imaginative trope but is the eternal real,  expressing itself  within temporal states of affairs.  I have argued in this essay that Kaufman’s constructivism need not entail  forswearing the realistic intent of theological language. Rather, it employs an  indirect form of reference that seeks to identify without reifying the divine. As  we have seen, such a project is fraught with a weighty difficulty that Kaufman  never quite resolved. How to identity without reifying? Are these procedures not  directly correlative? To the extent the he refuses reification, does Kaufman not  undermine his identification of God, ultimately reducing theological meanings  to the most severe poverty—an unknown “X?” On the other hand, does not  the approach of empirical realism oscillate between Kaufman’s intractable dif- ficulty and the opposite one of falling into reification in order clearly to identify  God—i.e., as a mere participant in the creative passage? One may conclude  from these difficulties that a constructivist program, even if  it proceeds on the  basis of a realistic intent, cannot satisfy that intent. However, I have argued  that the conclusion simply does not follow. Constructivism is about construct- 24. I am borrowing once again from Gilles Deleuze.

If  there  is an impasse, such as the one we have identified, it may be possible to find  or to construct concepts to cross it. The virtual is a concept that seems to be  able to do the required work. God is the virtual—an identifiable (if  infinite)  component of the real and yet not reducible to a mere participant in it. If  I  am correct, then Kaufman’s project can still be very much alive, and perhaps  all the more interesting for being somewhat different than he imagined it. </page> </plain_text>
