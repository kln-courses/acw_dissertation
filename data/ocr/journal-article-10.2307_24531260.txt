Every one of us is born into a wonderland —the universe in which we live and move and have our being, and which, from the dawn of human thinking, has exerted a pro found fascination upon the mind. Man's reaction to the riddle of the uni verse is an interesting study, leading to a conclusion perhaps rather unexpected— that in this respect modern man differs less from his primitive forbears than might be supposed. An analysis of the cosmic emo tion evidenced in the earliest human records reveals six principal elements in its composi tion, five of which are to be found in mod ern man, all qualitatively unaltered, though in some cases much intensified. The sixth element, though strong in earlier times, has now almost faded away, but its place has been taken by a seventh element of dis tinctly modern origin. First and foremost among these per manent elements we may place wonder and its invariable concomitant, curiosity. The presence of these elements in very young children testifies to their ancient racial char acter. It is recorded that the physicist Clerk Maxwell, in his early years, was con tinually asking his elders, "What is the go of that?" Every parent can match this from his own experience, and primitive man doubtless asked many such questions with no one to answer them. But curiosity, like hunger, becomes stronger the longer it re mains unsatisfied, and lacking an answer it will manufacture "one for itself. The records of the past are full of such guesses at the causes of natural phenomena, mostly anthropomorphic in character.

Received March 19, 1942. stormy waves of the sea were caused by the wrathful strokes of Neptune's trident; the attraction of the magnet for iron was due to an indwelling spirit, and the thunderbolts of Jove still live in poetic parlance. Gradu ally, however, man learned that there was one source from which he could obtain an answer to his questions—Nature herself. It has been well said that an experiment is a question put to Nature, and it is interesting to reflect that the experimental method and the growth of modern science have their origin in the urge of these two primitive in stincts—wonder and curiosity. Primitive though they may be, these ele ments are still with us. Time has but strengthened and ripened them and wid ened their field of application. It is no longer necessary that an occurrence be rare or spectacular to excite our wonder. We have learned that the simplest and most com monplace natural phenomenon, even the falling of an apple from a tree, is, when we stop to think about it, as Newton did, won derful past all speaking. Nor is this recog nition of the wonder of the commonplace confined to scientific men. Seventy years ago, some of William Kingdon Clifford's most successful popular addresses on science were given before audi ences of London working men. It is true that Clifford was the greatest master of lucid exposition in our language, but some of the credit must be given to the receptive audiences. It is unthinkable that even a Clifford could interest, say, a primitive group of Australian black-fellows in such subjects without the liberal use of experi ments according to the classical definition— involving a bright light or a loud noise.
