POTTER'S MUSEUM OF CURIOSITIES On September 23 and 24, 2003, on the great flat bruise-colored Cornish moors, at Jamaica Inn (which is a real place, not invented by Daphne du Maurier), the holdings of Mr. Potter's Museum of Curiosities were sold in lots to the highest bidders, and one of the wonders of Victorian England passed into private hands and out of the public view. The collection included many objects that seemed to have gone through the distorting lens of dream: a church made of white feathers; Tom Thumb's tiny calling card; two pipe-smoking gents, a Squire and a Parson, made from lobster parts; and a number of unusual taxidermy tableaux. It also included a book of nursery rhymes. This book, not obvi ously "curious," had belonged to Walter Potter's sister Jane, and con tained the rhyme "The Death of Cock Robin." 328</page><page sequence="2">Shelley Jackson THE DEATH OF COCK ROBIN Who killed Cock Robin? I, said the Sparrow, With my bow and arrow, I killed Cock Robin. Who saw him die? I, said the Fly, With my little eye, I saw him die. Who caught his blood? I, said the Fish, With my little dish, I caught his blood. Who'll make the shroud? I, said the Beetle, With my thread and needle, I'll make the shroud. Who'll dig his grave? I, said the Owl, With my pick and shovel, I'll dig his grave. Who'll be the parson? I, said the Rook, With my little book, I'll be the parson. Who'll be the clerk? I, said the Lark, If it's not in the dark, I'll be the clerk. Who'll carry the link? I, said the Linnet, I'll fetch it in a minute, I'll carry the link. Who'll be chief mourner? I, said the Dove, I mourn for my love, I'll be chief mourner. 329</page><page sequence="3">Shelley Jackson Who'll carry the coffin? I, said the Kite, If it's not through the night, I'll carry the coffin. Who'll bear the pall? We, said the Wren, Both the cock and the hen, We'll bear the pall. Who'll sing a psalm? I, said the Thrush, As she sat on a bush, I'll sing a psalm. Who'll toll the bell? I, said the bull, Because I can pull, I'll toll the bell. All the birds of the air Fell a-sighing and a-sobbing, When they heard the bell toll For poor Cock Robin. WALTER POTTER'S BIG IDEA Walter spent a lot of time with dead birds—peeling off their feathered skins like gloves, pulling them over little fists made of tallow and twine, wiring their claws to twigs. (He was a taxidermist.) So "The Death of Cock Robin" was real to him. Writing can sometimes do that: it can make imaginary robins fly. Then it can let them fall, and make the world mourn the death of what never lived. Maybe Walter took a professional interest in the trick that makes us see life where there is none. That was his job, too: making twine and feathers seem poised for flight. But the birds in "Cock Robin" didn't just fly. The owl used a trowel; the sparrow shot an arrow,· the rook read a book. That gave Walter an idea. It took him seven years to realize it. 330</page><page sequence="4">Shelley Jackson THE ORIGINAL DEATH et) BURIAL OF COCK ROBIN The little blue coffin is borne by four birds in black tie through an orderly graveyard with flocked grass in front of a painted backdrop depicting a small country church with five painted birds flying above it. An open grave waits in the foreground, some diminutive bones heaped beside it, as if thrown up by the gravedigger, an owl. A rook in a ribbon holds an open book. The book is real, though tiny. The bull is not real, of course—he's less than a foot tall—though his wooden body is covered with real hide. (Whether cowhide or not, nobody could tell me. It looks improbably fuzzy to me, and I won der, though I find the idea somehow disturbing, whether it might be cat.) Tied to his nose ring is a cord that arcs up to the painted bell tower of the painted church and disappears through a small square hole cut in the backdrop. Birds perch in the mossy branches, real, that protrude from painted trees. Like the supernumerary birds in the separate compartment under the gabled roof, these take more birdlike poses than the mourners below. They could be specimens from a museum of natural history, were it not for the glass beads glued to their cheeks. The entire poem is painted in gold on the wooden frame. A button beside each stanza lights up the corresponding part of the scene. (As Edison did not invent the lightbulb until 1879, this feature must have been added later.) THE LIFE OF WALTER POTTER Walter was born July 2, 1835, in the small town of Bramber, where his father kept the White Lion Inn. He taught himself the art of taxidermy, practicing on rats and chicks and kittens the local farmers gave him. He wasn't much good at it; his mounts were stiff, scrunched, and shapeless. But his ambition was great. In 1861, at the age of twenty-six, he unveiled The Original Death et) Burial of Cock Robin in the garden of the White Lion, to general amazement. Gratified by the attention, he made many more tableaux that, like Cock Robin, showed animals behaving like men. Some illustrate rhymes or proverbs ("The House that Jack Built," "Babes in the Woods"); others, conventional scenes of daily life—the schoolroom, the gentleman's club, the cricket game. Over time, Walter added 331</page><page sequence="5">Shelley Jackson many other curiosities, some donated by visitors, to what had be come a bona fide museum. He died in 1918, after a stroke. LOOK, LARK The Original Death et) Burial of Cock Robin is, frankly, kitsch. It's naive about representation and unpleasantly insouciant—to a twenty-first-century eye—about the serious business of death. And yet it gives me the same feeling of beautiful trouble as Cornell's boxes or Nabokov's Pale Fire (works also preoccupied with birds and death). The excavating owl seems on the verge of breaking through into a maze of mirrors. To find my way, I find I need to name each turn, out loud, slowly: real dead birds ... representing real live birds ... representing imag inary live birds ... mourn a real dead bird ... representing an imagi nary dead bird ... represented by words ... in a poem. (It is possible that the imaginary dead bird of the poem represents something else again. We'll return to that point.) Actually, it's even more complicated, because the dead robin, like the "live" owl, is not a real dead robin, since that would quickly decompose, but a semblance made of a robin's skin filled with wax and twine. To one side of the grave lie the bones of a real dead bird, repre senting an imaginary bird (Potter's flourish—it's not in the rhyme) that has been dug up to make room for Cock Robin. This bird was itself buried once, and presumably mourned, but has been forgotten; once an individual, it has become nothing but bones. In other words, by an imaginary trajectory it has returned to the place it really occu pies: simple, anonymous dead-animalness. It occurs to me as a pecu liar wrinkle that those bones were probably taken from one of the other birds in the tableau. The bull is especially tricky. It's a fake dead animal (there is no bull the size of a rook) made of the hide of a real dead animal (possi bly one of a whole different species) in imitation of a real but much larger dead animal, representing a real live animal, representing an imaginary live animal in a rhyme. Furthermore, the bull is tolling, with a real bellpull, an invisible bell in a painted church tower. The real string feeds through a hole in the backdrop, behind which, for all I know (the docent could not tell me), it may be tied to a small but 332</page><page sequence="6">Shelley Jackson real bell; if so, this real bell represents the imaginary bell of the poem, and if it tolled, its tinkle would represent the dong of the bell in the poem, though because that bell is much bigger, we know it would sound a lower note—if it existed. What is it about the human mind that believes it is possible to make a distinction between one kind of imaginary sound, that of a bell ringing in a poem, and another, that of an unseen bell that may or may not exist—and believes that the distinction is real, even if neither bell exists? Yet we seem to delight in such distinctions, and in testing them. Trompe l'œil painting draws on this delight. In a painting depict ing a recently slain game bird, the illusion of a dead bird is taken for a real dead bird. In a taxidermy tableau, on the other hand, a real dead bird bodies forth an illusion. Instead of objects replaced by images, images are replaced by objects. The passage between the two might be figured by the cord around the bull's neck—a real cord attached to a painted tower. But taxidermy is not a simple inversion of trompe l'œil, turning three dimensions back into two. The stuffed bird does not stand for a painted bird, but for an imaginary bird conjured up in a poem. Walter Potter translated words into the objects to which they refer. This is a weird reversal of the usual order of signification. Words, we commonly think, refer to things. The simplest sentence is a kind of verbal pointing: "Look, lark!" Reference is more complicated in literature: we know that the lark of poetry—Shelley's "blithe spirit," for example—does not exist outside the poem ("bird thou never wert," indeed), so we do not bother to look out the window for it. It's conjured up in our minds by words. Nonetheless, those words, we believe, are signs for things, and a lark is a thing, even if in this case an absent and imaginary one. In Potter's tableau, the real dead lark signifies the word "lark," which itself signifies another lark, imagined by the anonymous author of the rhyme: a living lark endowed with clerical skills, who therefore must be, to some uncertain degree, human. Potter's lark, which once flew, sang, and ate bugs, folds over upon this clerical lark with its inkwell and quill, both more real than it and, in another sense, a whole step further from real. How can that be? Surely a stuffed lark is a better representation of a lark than the four shapes we agree to see as letters, spelling a word, "lark," that (assuming we speak English) we agree to understand as meaning that "blithe spirit." Surely the most vivid way to represent 333</page><page sequence="7">Shelley Jackson a thing is by holding up the thing itself. But there are problems with taxidermy as an object language: 1. The stuffed lark is dead; the poetic lark is alive. 2. The stuffed lark is a real bird; the poetic lark is an imaginary bird. 3. The stuffed lark is a particular, historical bird; the poetic lark must be rein vented by every reader. The stuffed lark, for all these reasons, does more than represent the poetic lark; it foists its own, literal presence on the onlooker. So two larks compete for our attention, one of them agile and imagi nary; the other stiff, a little dusty, and visibly dead. Our attention splits. One part attends to the story of Cock Robin, the other part to a dead bird. But doesn't the word "lark" have some of the same problems? Certainly, it interferes much less with the imaginary lark it repre sents, because it's not as interesting to look at as a dead bird. But it, too, splits our attention. Readers can usually overlook this. Writers, though, can't write without attending to the material of language: the clicks and moos of k's and o's, the lag and lurch of commas and full stops, the black and white of the page. Like Potter, Shelley kept the living lark in mind, but he, too, spent a lot of time fiddling with feathers. I mean "feathers" figuratively, of course. (Though Shelley did use a quill pen.) Words are not pieces of dead animals. But I sense, all the same, that there is some connection between language and death. The first bird was a lark, said Aesop, and she was created before the world was. When her father died, she had to bury him inside her own head, for lack of other burial ground. (I'd like to see that tableau.) One could read this as an allegory of memory. The mind is a ceme tery in which the past is buried, and thought itself is elegiac. So is taxidermy. Many of Potter's rats were supplied by one indus trious dog who wound up in a glass case in his turn, after leaping out of a barn window in pursuit of his last rat. This dog stands alone, which is not characteristic of Potter's style. But this is not just any dog. It's a dog with a name (Spot). A dog who was, obviously, loved, and mourned. Nobody mourned the rats he killed. Still, recall that the first tableau Potter did depicted a funeral—a strange funeral, in which all the guests are also dead. So let's try and figure out: Who is in mourn ing here? For whose loss? 334</page><page sequence="8">Shelley Jackson BUT FIRST, A BRIEF HISTORY OF TAXIDERMY Like literature, taxidermy has genres. Most common (as in fiction) are the realists. Carl Akeley, taxi dermist to the Museum of Natural History in New York, eschewed crumpets and cravats: let squirrels be squirrels. His tableaux as pire to capture moments from real life, like photographs in three dimensions. Of course, there's nothing realistic about that. The more success ful the illusion of stopped motion, the more uncanny the scene: what could be weirder than a gull stopped midflap, each feather in place? Realism in literature is achieved through highly artificial means, and taxidermy is no different. Nor could a nature photographer hope to seize such iconic scenes—perfect generational groupings posing among characteristic flora. The tableaux are like those shrines in which statues of saints are ringed by the symbols of their martyr dom. Every element signifies: the cactus, the hummingbird, the three-pronged print in the "wet" mud by the "spring." Around the elk or rhino, smaller animals—chipmunks, quail—cavort like cherubs. Their heaven, though, is not cloud-cuckoo-land, but an idealized representation of their native habitat. It's a world from which the hunter has been erased. We behind the glass are his stand-ins, looking at a world we have kept by killing it. But we are invisible. In sonorous darkness we drift, shadows passing before radiant, unblinking ones whose only purpose now is to be seen. They address themselves to the glass as to a mirror. (Reflect: if they could see, the glass would be a mirror. We'd be invisible, offering no chance of the cross-species communion evoked in Julio Cortâzar's Axolotl. ) Like characters in a novel or on stage, even their solitude is public. Like pom stars they strike poses that afford a com plete view of what in real life is usually out of sight, and they offer this view as proof of the real, even as the support of the real—as the lealei real, which both is and represents itself at once. This is real ism's paradoxical claim: through artifice, to make the real realer than real itself. If scientific taxidermy is realism, trophy taxidermy is romance. The snarling tiger tells the story of the perilous courtship between man and beast, which always ends the same way. Trophy taxidermy celebrates man's triumph over nature. Anthropomorphic taxidermy is the despised genre of fantasy. Few practice it, but Walter Potter wasn't the only one, or even the first. 335</page><page sequence="9">Shelley Jackson In 1851, three years before Potter had even started Cock Robin, Hermann Ploucquet, a naturalist at the Royal Museum of Stuttgart, Wiirttemberg, displayed over fifteen hundred mounts at the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace. Most of these were realistic tab leaux, "illustrative of animal life by its characteristic incidents as well as by the preserved specimens themselves." But his "comical groups" caused a bigger stir. These included illustrations of Goethe's fable "Reineke Fuchs"; Ploucquet, too, borrowed from books. (It is uncertain whether Potter was one of the thousands who visited Ploucquet's work at the Great Exhibition, but it seems likely that he had heard of it.) Scientific and trophy taxidermy, which shade into one another, are boundary establishing. As Donna Haraway has ably demonstrated, the tableaux in the Museum of Natural History introduce the viewer to an order of nature, with clear hierarchies and subdivisions. Man, invisible in these scenes, is present everywhere as the precondition for this ordering, and is ushered into what is made to seem his proper place in that order: the top. Anthropomorphic taxidermy, on the other hand, is boundary blur ring. Rather than reiterating their natural lives, Potter's animals imitate ours. They go to school, get married, play snooker. We are invited to identify with them. True, this is not exactly the call of the wild, or the "becoming-animal" that Deleuze and Guattari invoke. Like cats and dogs, which Deleuze and Guattari declare to be thor oughly Oedipal animals, Potter's mounts are way too implicated in our human neuroses to provide any access to the animal other, any more than those "furries" who put on pointy ears and a tail and attend conventions in Holiday Inns. What they might provide is an encounter with the animal in ourselves. True, they rely for their effect on the consciousness of difference. One must probably be persuaded that animals never serve tea to find it peculiarly pleasing when they do. Maybe the sight is so preposter ous that it confirms our humanity. "I might not be much of a man," the thinking might go, "but compared to a squirrel, I cut a fine figure at the club." But I suspect that inner voice might actually whisper, "Yes, I, too, have felt that way, a little awkward on my hind legs, claws slipping on the pool cue. I, too, have wondered how I wound up here. I, too, have the nagging feeling that I'm on some sort of stage, even if I can't hear the applause." Donna Haraway has said, "We would do well not to anthropomorphize the human, too." 336</page><page sequence="10">Shelley Jackson In Our Mutual Friend, written only a few years after Potter un veiled his great tableau, Dickens exhibits a rival one: "a pretty little dead bird lying on the counter, with its head drooping on one side against the rim of Mr. Venus's saucer, and a long stiff wire piercing its breast. As if it were Cock Robin, the hero of the ballad, and Mr. Venus were the sparrow with his bow and arrow, and Mr. Wegg were the fly with his little eye." Note that here it is the people who re semble animals, not the other way around. Dickens may not have known about Potter, but he did visit the Great Exhibition. He must have seen Ploucquet's tableaux, or if not, something very like them. (Our Mutual Friend also features "two preserved frogs fighting a small-sword duel.") He understood something about them that Potter may not have: likening works both ways. In Potter's tableaux we find the performing animal in ourselves. THE LOST WORLD Children have not yet lost it. To children, adult behavior is a game of pretend: inexplicable rituals in fancy dress. So where we most often meet dressed-up animals is in children's books. But talking animals have a darker, more venerable history. The dinky, impotent birds and bunnies of children's books (I exempt that other Potter, Beatrix, whose rabbits have a bracing dignity) are the sanitized, domesticated revenants of the animist beast-gods of ancient Britain. Potter shows us these gods, murdered, stuffed, and propped up in an artificial Arcadia outside of the reach of time. That Arcadia, the England of cottage gardens and cricket games, was already under assault in Potter's day. Akeley created the Mu seum of Natural History tableaux to preserve his vision of unspoiled nature (Haraway points out the tragic irony—of which Akeley was aware—that his campaign to preserve it itself aided a little in the spoiling). Bizarrely, Potter's tableaux preserve a threatened way of life for humans. There are no factories in these tableaux, no cities, no slums. Citizens of an agrarian way of life, these rabbits and kittens and squirrels and chicks are preserving a human fantasy of a rural Arcadia. They are the Kinks' "Village Green Preservation Society." Possibly what we are mourning, then, is our own lost past. But how can we mourn what we've never known? Already these 337</page><page sequence="11">Shelley Jackson tableaux evoke other representations—scenes in books and paint ings—more than that Arcadia itself, of which few of us have first hand knowledge. We can imagine a time when that Arcadia will exist only in its representations. When that time comes, the world in Potter's tableaux will seem an original, not a copy—itself some thing to be imitated. In Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities, the city of Eusapia has an iden tical copy underground, peopled only by corpses. Every change in the city above is reflected in the city below. However, the city below also seems to change subtly from time to time; the city aboveground has taken to imitating it. In fact, "[t]hey say that this has not just now begun to happen: actually it was the dead who built the upper Eusapia, in the image of their city. They say that in the twin cities there is no longer any way of knowing who is alive and who is dead." BEING DEAD If I am right that we identify with the animals in these frozen tableaux, we are not just "becoming animal." We are also becoming dead. The animals are not just dead, of course. Like dolls, they must look alive enough to support our fantasies. Really they are indetermi nate, neither quite dead nor fully alive. In fact, it is this in-between status that makes them tools to dream with. If they were really alive they would not act out our fantasies,· if they were purely fantas tic they would have no material presence. Their substantiality helps body forth the dream. But it also resists it: the doll has a body, which makes it realer than a daydream, and yet it's a doll's body. The squir rel with the snooker cue is real, but it's really dead. The fantasy must coexist with this knowledge. I would argue that this knowledge does not necessarily damage the fantasy. It might even provide part of its pleasure. A modern American life, broadly speaking, is deficient in gunk. We are cleaner than any age before us, and the surfaces we touch are smoother. We know more about how the world works but less about how it feels. Our hands are, I think, a little starved for the touch of the world—for its nap, its grain, its tooth. What's more, in employing our hands as instruments, we forget they are also objects. Recently, I visited what I call "the two-headed calf store" in the East 338</page><page sequence="12">Shelley Jackson Village, New York (its real name is Obscura Antiques and Oddities). In its narrow, cluttered space one can find two stuffed Mexican toads tippling tequila, a wax model of a leprotic nose, or a blackened, tiny human hand in a box. The hand appears dense, gummy, like an ancient dried apricot. That it was once human is a distant abstrac tion. It is a thing. And it is a reminder. The dead do not depart. They don't "pass on." They stick around, and join the material world. The Victorians knew this better than we do, because they knew death better—so many of their friends were dead. They created me morial art from the intricately coiled and braided hair of the de parted: a hair angel hoisting a hair soul up out of an open hair tomb near weeping willows of hair,· a hair lamb at the foot of a hair cross, a hair dog guarding a hair tomb. These are worlds in which every thing—the memorial, the mourners, the landscape itself—is the lost loved one. To a modern eye, raiding the dead for an arts and crafts project is tasteless and creepy, not to mention unsanitary. Witness the conster nation at Gunther von Hagens's exhibitions of Plastinates (specially treated, dissected human bodies). These were volunteers, however. When the dead did not give their consent, our reaction is sharper; there is a special hell, we are convinced, for those Nazis who enjoyed lampshades and letter openers made from those they killed. We fear a vicious killer, but a whimsical one revolts us. This is true even when it comes to animals. Though we see (or eat or wear) dead ani mals almost every day, Nathalia Edenmont's photographs of severed cat heads bizarrely balanced on vases shock us, and so do Potter's tableaux. I feel this shock. But I suspect that part of it lies in un examined feelings about our place in the material world. Death, to modern Westerners, is abstract, an almost mathematical operation of subtraction. By custom, by euphemism, by the undertaker's arts, by medical practice, the materiality of the corpse is kept out of view. When we see it openly displayed, it is obscene, but also, if we're honest, a little thrilling. I said we join the material world when we die. But that is not quite right. We are already part of the material world. We forget it because thinking makes us feel vaporous, unreal, but while we think we gur gle and steam. We are not so different from the dolls we play with: something in us resists the stories we dream up. We are characters, but we are also stuff—bone, meat, goo. This is what we "leave be hind" when we die. It's the same thing animals leave. When we look 339</page><page sequence="13">Shelley Jackson at a taxidermy tableau, we see the stuff a living thing was made of. This resists the fantasy and survives it. "Bunnies at school" fades, but something remains: the dust on a fur coat, the light in the shaft of a whisker. Now hold a piece of your own hair to the light. In taxidermy animals, we locate the relic in us, what repels under standing and fellow feeling, the part of us that remains outside our own knowledge. Maybe the death all the birds of the air are mourning for is ours? THE EMPTY COFFIN I have a confession to make. When I explicated the chain of substi tutions between Potter's stuffed birds and the birds in the poem, I forgot that Cock Robin doesn't actually appear there. That real dead bird representing an imaginary dead bird? I made it up. What's really there, as I can easily see in the postcard that has been propped up on my desk the whole time I have been writing this, is a little blue coffin, probably empty. In fact, the one dead bird that isn't there is the one named in the poem. I'm surprised, because Walter is otherwise scrupulous, even slav ish in reproducing the poem. Maybe he left it out lest it undermine the illusion. How could he, with his limited skills, make one dead bird look deader than the rest? But no: Walter is right, I'm wrong. In the poem, as in the tableau, Cock Robin is absent. The stage seems to hold everything but Cock Robin. At the center is an empty coffin. "The Death of Cock Robin"—both rhyme and tableau—com memorates a loss. But whose loss? Is Cock Robin just a bird? Many scholars have thought otherwise, seeing the rhyme as allegory, and Cock Robin as, variously, Robin Hood, the Earl of Essex, Jesus, and the Norse god Balder. Freud, however, might propose something closer to home. (Cock Robin?) If allegory works through displacement and substitution, then fetishism is a kind of allegory. As Freud tells it, the little boy (Freud believed all fetishists to be male), on discovering that women have no penis, fears greatly for his own. "Who killed Cock Robin?" the child asks, alarmed, and switches his affections to something less 340</page><page sequence="14">Shelley Jackson unnerving. An intermediate object, Freud calls it, and he means that quite literally, because often it's something you might find on your way to the vagina (if you were working your way up from the floor, as children do). The substitute relies for its charge on the repressed desire for (and anxiety about) the genitals, but that is not to say that the shoe is just a disguised vagina. The fetishist really likes shoes. He articulates his desire solely in terms of, say, tiny eyelets, the smell of leather, and the glint of light on a polished heel. Is this so different from what I was saying about taxidermy, dolls, and our own bodies? We relish the stuff. In fact, it seems to me, pace Freud, that all objects are fetish objects, including the genitalia: material things that simultaneously possess considerable fascina tions of their own, and stand in for something else. That something can never be grasped, because it is a phantasm—the pure object of desire. As Lacan says, it must remain unattainable, or what you want would cease to be what you want, and become what you have. "You can't always get what you want"? Actually, you can't ever get what you want. It may be, then, that the loss mourned in Cock Robin cannot be named. Cock Robin is loss itself. Our lives are, in this sense, one long funeral. But the coffin is empty, as it has to be, and there are robins every where. Of course, fetishists usually prefer things that are closer to the ground. Common fetishes include shoes, feet, stockings, socks; leather, lace, silk, and fur. WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE KITTEN WEDDING The case is stuffed with kittens, in orderly rows and matching lace trimmed frocks. Much effort went into the tiny dresses with their tinier stitches, but the kittens themselves are Potter's worst work. Their skin is scrunched and awry. Their balding heads are round, as if the skin had been pulled over a balled sock, not a skull, so the eyes goggle like cloves stuck in an orange, and the thin mouths, pulled crooked, have the look of mouths that will be crying soon. "Do you, death, take death to be your lawfully wedded bride?" Death poses the question before an audience of the dead, who look 341</page><page sequence="15">Shelley Jackson shocked. "Aren't they a bit young?" they whisper. The kittens are the only animals in the Potter museum that are fully clothed. This is, I suspect, because they are at a wedding, which means sex is in the offing. Covering it up just advertises it. Victo rians are famous for their pudency, which put cart horses in diapers, piano legs in bloomers, but every fig leaf is also a come-on. Putting clothes on a piano leg might in fact be the only thing that could make it sexy. The museum literature says the kittens have little knickers on, under their skirts. (Someone looked?) Pussies in panties: the fetish is in very weak disguise here. If this savors unpleasantly of necrophilia, remember that the Victorians risked pregnancy with every fuck, death with every pregnancy, and often survived labor only to see their babies die. Child mortality was so high that toddlers were pre pared for their own likely fate by books with titles like Brief Lives about saintly children who died young. To associate sex with death you didn't have to be perverted, just observant. Where do you think all those kittens came from? From barn litters, drowned in barrels: the progeny of all-too-many kitten weddings. THE HAIR OF THE DOG As with other fetish objects, the sex appeal of dead kittens lies in their specific materiality. That is, in their fur. The fur (and under lying skin, of course) is just about all of the kitten that's kitten. Everything else is plastic—or, in Potter's time, straw, twine, saw dust, and wire. Without fur, they would be lawn sculptures. With it, they are, at least in part, real. Real is a slippery notion, but here it has something to do with the fact that that fur was once actually worn by the creature represented here. The taxidermy animal stands for the live one not just because it resembles it, but because it is part of it. It is an example of the literary figure of synecdoche. "The hair of the dog that bit you" is a more familiar example, but it works the same way. The hair stands for the whole dog but it isn't just a spoor. It's also part of the dog. Like the relic of a saint, it doesn't just refer to the saint, it is imbued with the saint's own presence. But it works (if it works) because it isn't identical with the dog. It is both part of and distinct from the dog. The hair of the dog, as hangover cure, is like a vaccine: a manage 342</page><page sequence="16">Shelley Jackson able dose of poison that steels you against the real threat. The ancient Greeks had a word that meant both poison and cure: pharmakon. Plato, as Derrida observes, called writing a pharmakon. But if writ ing's the hair of the dog, what's the dog? Maybe the dog is life. Life is a kind of binge, ultimately mortal. It's not particularly good for us, but it provides all we know of joy, so how can we quit it? Still, we sicken. Language treats life homeo pathically, in measured doses. It doesn't cure us of living, because it is part of living, but it can help us feel better in the morning. Or maybe the dog is death. WRITING AND DEATH We don't need to say, "Look, lark," if we can point. Language be comes necessary when we want to talk about what isn't there. The lark may fly away, but "blithe spirit" stays. The lark might even die, but fly on forever in verse. For this reason, you might say language is haunted. Even if the lark still lives, its death haunts us in advance, through the word. This is true of all signs. Roland Barthes says, "In front of the photograph of my mother as a child, I tell myself: she is going to die: I shudder... over a catastrophe which has already occurred. Whether or not the subject is already dead, every photograph is this catastrophe." Likewise, as Derrida observes, though a friend is stand ing in front of us, her name stands for the possibility of her absence. We can keep calling it, even when she is dead, and so to name her is already to begin to mourn her loss. Written words call on people who are even farther gone. On Plato, for example, who thought written words were mere husks—you might even say skins—of the living word, the spoken word, still full of breath. ("If only we could make them breathe," sighs a taxidermist of his models.) This makes written words deceptive and a bit macabre. It also makes them permanent. To make words last, the breath must be squeezed out of them. Then they can be arranged into books. A book is a three-dimensional crystal of words, a solid block that, like mica, separates easily into sheets. It's the reader who turns it into a story. By running our eyes over it from beginning to end, we supply the passage of time, which has been peeled out of the written word like the vein from a prawn. We allow literature to borrow a 343</page><page sequence="17">Shelley Jackson length of our life-line and string a plot on it, and in this way the words are pulled before our eyes at the pace of living. The truth of the matter, though, is that written words, at least in books, are stuck in unchanging constellations. Characters are stiff, simplified figures we arrange in fixed positions to suggest stopped motion. They inhabit shallow foregrounds in which water is not wet, grass is an unnatural green, the background is sketchy, and only the main characters possess three dimensions. Like Potter's and Akeley's, these scenes are often slightly too exemplary to be real— the animals are the ones appropriate to the ecosystem, be it the tun dra, the steppe, or the parlor. But above all it is their fixity that ren ders them unreal. Occasionally, amidst these stiffs, we find something stiffer. The effect is ambiguous: do the quick seem quicker by contrast, or do they betray their close resemblance to the dead? In Robbe-Grillet's La Maison de Rendezvous, a stuffed dog is being walked by a man nequin in a shop window: "The animal has been mounted with great skill. And if it were not for its total immobility, its slightly over emphasized stiffness, its certainly too-shiny glass eyes that are also too fixed, the excessively pink interior, perhaps, of its gaping mouth, its exaggeratedly white teeth, one would think it was about to com plete its interrupted movement." A similar dog appears over and over in the novel. Sometimes it is stuffed, sometimes alive, some times a painted statue. For Robbe-Grillet they are all equally real— that is, all fake. The living one is no more genuine (and no more alive), since it too is made from words. Indeed, there is a sense in which all characters in literature are dead. Sometimes one of them seems to know it—to open its eyes and see the cracked glass, smell the dust, feel the beetles crepitating under its skin. Try reading a few paragraphs of Beckett's The Unnamable as if it were narrated by a stuffed buffalo head. I think this is not alto gether to abuse Beckett, whose lifelong work was acknowledging the death in life, the life in death of literature—and of existence itself. And yet, over and over, we are willingly deceived: we see life where none is. Often it lies in fleeting details: A tiny striated rain bow in eyelashes. Light creaming on a pale breast. The nervous jerk in a red Adam's apple. Where did we get these? Captured them from life, of course. We have, somehow, the capacity to take an im pression and fix it in words. I do not mean that we kill the moment by noticing it (though some writers have felt so), or that we hunt human trophies and set them up in fierce poses to show how bold we 344</page><page sequence="18">Shelley Jackson are (though some writers do). I mean to say only that when we prop up our prize in a novel, it is no longer anything living, but a piece of fixity that depends on the viewer's affectionate familiarity to reani mate it. Because this is the paradoxical aim: to coax motion out of stasis, life out of dead matter. Like taxidermy, literature trafficks in the stuff of death in order to transcend it. It sets itself against the normal decay of evanescent things, the erasure of every gesture, the instant dissipation of every spoken word. As Elaine Scarry demonstrates, it presents precisely what never lasts (transparency, sheen, a gesture), and thereby gives the illusion of life's lightness and lambency. This is fiction's glass eye. It is fake, but it shines on the page like life. Just so, the taxidermist freezes the alarmed flick of a tail, the cocked head, to make this fixed scene seem to last an instant only (because instants are all we ever have, in life, the just-for-an-instant-ness of life is precisely its register, that by which we know it, and yet be cause we are grabby fetishists we want to hold on to what, like a pre served frog, loses its slipperiness when we preserve it), but an instant to which we can return, magically, forever. Taxidermy and literature both aspire to keep the living moment. This is true even when the living moment has had its head cut off and mounted on a plaque: synecdoche rules, as in portrait photog raphy. The head is enough to capture a likeness. But it is only by removing what is truly temporal (decaying flesh, the fugitive) that the impression of temporality can be fixed. A dose of death is admin istered, homeopathically, to arrest death's course. But only with our help. In Flaubert's story "A Simple Faith," Jesus appears in the figure of a stuffed parrot wired to a cruciform perch. The parrot spreads its wings before a dying woman, offering her a redemption animated by misprision—or, if you prefer, by imagina tion. Whether this is a real redemption or not depends on your opin ion of God. But it is all the redemption literature offers. Dickens had a pet raven, Grip. Grip died suddenly, and Dickens described the event to his friend and biographer John Forster in almost Potterian terms. "At half-past, or thereabouts, he was heard talking to himself about the horse and Topping's family, and to add some incoherent expressions which are supposed to have been either a foreboding of his approaching dissolution, or some wishes relative to the disposal of his little property: consisting chiefly of half-pence which he had buried in different parts of the garden. On the clock striking twelve he appeared slightly agitated, but he soon recovered, 345</page><page sequence="19">Shelley Jackson walked twice or thrice along the coach-house, stopped to bark, stag gered, exclaimed Halloa old girl! (his favourite expression), and died." Dickens had Grip stuffed. You can find him perched on a rock amidst dried grasses against a painted sky in a wooden box (Dickens's handi work) in the rare book room of the Philadelphia Free Library. You can also find him in the fiction section, because Grip was the model for the raven of the same name in Bainaby Rudge. You might also find him in poetry. Allegedly, Poe read Barnaby Rudge with particular interest. Poe's raven, like both Grips, the real and the fictional, can talk. But like all talking birds, he has a limited vocabulary. In fact, he knows only one word. He repeats it mechani cally; he cannot "mean" anything by it, and yet meaning alights upon it and roosts. It does not matter whether or not the raven is the demon he appears to be; he is a "prophet still, if bird or devil," for he gives voice to the knowledge in the listener's own heart. This is astonishing. If meaning does not lie in words themselves, or in the intentions of the speaker, then the meaning of Poe's poem, too, does not lie in the poem, or Poe. "The Raven" is a talking raven. "Nevermore," it repeats. It doesn't know what it's saying, but it might tell the truth all the same. It depends on how we read it. THE EYE We have come full circle, and are looking at ourselves looking. Writing is often compared to a window. Through it, we see a world. But every window can also be a mirror, and show us ourselves looking. It just depends on the light you shine on it. As Pale Fire reflects, the reader reads himself—or herself. If she reads well, that reading enriches both the reader and the read. If poorly, both lose. "Mirror, mirror": the magic mirror that tells the truth is always named twice. Maybe that's because every mirror has two sides. If the image in the mirror resembles us, we also resemble it. Like the citizens of Eusapia, mirrored by their dead, we do not know for sure who is imitating whom. When I look at Potter's tableaux, I see myself, as he intended, but not the way he intended. I do not see the schoolmarm or the student, the bride or the tippler. I see an animal awkwardly attired in human clothes, performing rituals it doesn't completely understand. I see skin, hair, teeth. I see a corpse-to-be. 346</page></plain_text>
