<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW-ESSAY THE FILM SPECTATOR: FROM SIGN TO MIND Edited by Warren Buckland Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 1995, 258 pp. Let us proceed to the heart of the matter, or rather, to the heart and cen ter of this volume of essays collected by Warren Buckland. There, for a number of reasons, we find the work of Christian Metz. It is from this location that we can survey this collection, as well as speculate on its nov elty and plausible place in current cinema studies. It is a volume of some interest for students of film theory. Yet it is safe to suppose that if the book represents any tendency in theory, it has not been one popularized to any degree. Perhaps this is due to Buckland's dedication to presenting new research on an old problem, or perhaps to the fact that there are very few practicing theorists left in cinema studies who now regard the problem in the way Buckland does. To begin with, the Metz essay at the heart of the book is "The Impersonal Enunciation, or the Site of Film." It is also the title of a full length book.1 News of this Metz book has not been widely disseminated and, until the publication of this volume, few have even had much occa sion to consider its existence. The piece that appears here, presumably a preparatory essay, was published in 1987 (in English translation in 1991) to no great notice.2 This essay and the book are both very late contribu tions by Metz and appeared decades after the book that many considerto have concluded his contributions to film theory—The Imaginary Signifier3 It is striking that "The Impersonal Enunciation" does not continue Metz's psychoanalytic work, nor does it extend Metz into new territory. Instead, and this is what forms the basis of Buckland's project, this late (and proba bly final) writing represents a return to Metz's "first semiotics." It represents a return, startling as this may seem, to linguistics. The linguistics at hand, moreover, is the same one that inaugurated semiology in France, the one that preceded Lacan's intervention and Derrida's critique. This is, then, a return to classic semiology. Or is it? CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FILM STUDIES • REVUE CANADIENNE D'ÉTUDES CINÉMATOGRAPHIQUES VOLUME 7 NO. I • SPRING • PRINTEMPS 1988 • PP 63-73</page><page sequence="2">Before we look to the essay itself, let us look at the two brief pieces which introduce the volume. The first is written by Thomas Elsaesser, General Editor for the "Film Culture In Transition" series published by the Amsterdam University Press. Elsaesser champions the return to pre-psy choanalytic Metzian semiotics. He writes, "This collection sets out to doc ument the recent and productive engagement with the Metzian heritage among European scholars, demonstrating that his thought was in some respects both richer and more open than its identification with Saussurean semiology would lead one to believe." When Elsaesser cautions that we not confuse it with the rejuvenation of Saussurean semiotics, he regards the return to linguistics as offering potential avenues of investigation left unex plored when Saussurean doctrine was overwhelmed by psychoanalytic theory. Perhaps, Elsaesser proposes, some originary moment in semiotic research still holds unexplored theoretical terrain. While this is the tenor of Elsaesser's general introduction, it never gets beyond the vague suppo sition about what range of linguistics needs to be defined and tested. It is left to Buckland to specify the kind of linguistics that will serve as a new model for research, and to project it onto Metz. For Buckland, the return is not a reversion to Saussure, but then to which model (among several competitors) will we be turning to? On the other hand, vagueness aside, Elsaesser is willing to display cer tainty that he can put faith in this return. The most interesting and polem ical claim Elsaesser makes is that the return to a classical cinema semiolo gy need not neglect the psychoanalytic moment, and that indeed the famous two phases of semiotics can be seen as part of a continuous enter prize that enfolds no less than three intersecting projects: to theorize a code semiotics, a text semiotics, and a semiotics of the subject. The essays collected in The Imaginary Signifier have often been interpreted as a radical break, a kind of non-sequitur to Metz's first, or code semiotics. The way Metz's position has sometimes been taken up—as polemical tool and shorthand theory of the subject—often suggests that "psychoanalytic semiotics" left behind the linguistics agenda, and especially the systematic features of code semiotics. Yet, as is only now becoming fully apparent, Metz's original formulations can also be seen as a bold attempt to theorize, from the position of a poetics or rhetoric, the linguistic place of the user. Having considered the site of the subject in psychoanalytic terms (and this Elsaesser claims to have been the necessary verso of Metz's code semi otics, e.g., Film Language and text semiotics, e.g., Language and Cinema), Metz then found it rewarding to consider the subject as construed by linguistic theory in the terms of his first masters, Jakobson, Benveniste, and Barthes 64 Volume 7 No. 1</page><page sequence="3">(though not Saussure, or at least not explicitly). This yields the discussion of models of filmic enunciation Metz, in his last writings, pursues using the base of these classic semiotic theorists. Elsaesser's description offers us the retrospect of a theory in process, one to which Metz returned, but which has not yet been examined or studied as to its consequences or productiv ity. It is towards this examination that The Film Spectator has been directed and it is from this center of the late work of Metz that the book arises. Elsaesser raises one more interesting feature of the history of semiotics of the cinema. He points out, quite correctly, that the psychoanalytic the ses laid out by The Imaginary Signifier never pervaded the country in which it originated as it did Great Britain and North America. Nor was its conti nental influence as long lasting. Instead, literary narratology exerted a shaping force on French film theory that has been and still is substantial. This observation provides perspective on what is really a volume of French essays (with the notable exception of one Italian entry) that unavoidably has the curious status as a kind of historical and cultural capsule. These essays, which were written as early as the late Seventies and as late as the early Nineties, are hardly known outside France. Although some were pre viously translated, none ever escaped their historical and geographical context. Surely this would make the volume at least interesting to the his torian of recent continental film theory. But this is not to suggest that this may be the only interest that the book holds. Buckland's ambitions are wider than that. Rather than undertake an exposition of Metz's essay, I would rather bring to light a few interesting and anomalous features of it. By the time Metz writes it, he still had not conceded significantly on his "linguistic imperialism" (as his old antagonist Umberto Eco once so sharply termed it). That is to say, the linguistic model retains for Metz primacy whenever he tries to define cinematic enunciation or the place of the subject,- he con sistently maintains there is an explicit homologue between language itself and film regarded as a language. Consider, for example, the negative way that Metz reacts to attempts to modify linguistics that he identifies with developments in American film narratology. Throughout the essay Metz attempts to draw a theory of enunciation from conceptions developed inside a linguistics concerned with the phone over the graphe. The crux of the problem, he claims, lies in an adequate conception of the cinematic utterance and its diectic markers, in short the problem lies with enuncia tion. It is when he tries to locate these linguistic concepts in a cinematic paradigm that Metz betrays his alliance with the primacy of natural lan guage. For example: CJFS • RCEC 65</page><page sequence="4">One has to keep in mind that the word to "utter" {énoncer), in com mon French, means only the act of speaking or writing (compare the expression l'énoncer du problème [the utterance, the formulation of the problem]). This expresses the almost universal belief that the only true language is the linguistic language. Moreover, when David Bordwell condemns the very notion of enunciation in film studies, he uses a very similar argument (to André Cardies and André Gaudreault), the non-linguistic nature of the object. This is a line of argument that Metz wishes to use in order to refine his notion of enunciation, and it is striking the way in which the linguistic model functions as an "inspiration from a distance." Again, he writes, People who think that the expression "cinematic enunciation" has any meaning should not ignore this point (made by Bordwell and others), which is indeed very strong. It compels us to make an important conversion: to conceive of an enunciative apparatus that would not necessarily be deictic (and therefore anthropomorphic), or personal and that would not too closely imitate this or that linguistic device, since linguistic inspiration works better from a distance Further on Metz explains the real theoretical problems with a theory of enunciation that borrows from linguistics arise from conceptions of deixis. What he warns against is not the dangers a linguistic model entails but its confinement to cases of relative isomorphism: Any conception of enunciation that is influenced too much by deixis contains, as soon as the analysis of spoken languages is left behind, three main risks: anthropomorphism, artificial use of linguistic con cepts, and transformation of enunciation into communication (= "real," extra-textual relationships). Casetti himself does not often yield to those temptations,- he warns us against them, but in the the oretical field the risk remains ("the risk" in the singular, because the three are one and cannot be dissociated). Such a partnership with linguistics, however qualified by such acknowl edged dangers of false homologies, remains everywhere in force in this late text by Metz. In light of the current inter-disciplinary debate over "visual studies" and the diminution accorded linguistics within what has been called (for instance, by Mitchell) the "pictorial turn," this essay strikes one 66 Volume 7 No. 1</page><page sequence="5">as stubbornly resistant. But it is not a solitary one, for the constellation of works that Metz cites in support is impressive, and worth further investi gation.4 Nonetheless, some film theorists (Gregory Currie, for example) have already written off the linguistic moment in film theory, but that only makes the issue that much more fascinating.5 The second point of interest is the rigorous dialogue Metz maintains with contemporary theorists of filmic narration and enunciation. Not only does he consider the work of Bordwell, Branigan, and a host of Francophone theorists (Dominique Château, François Jost, Albert Laffay, André Cardies, and André Gaudreault),6 but the essay itself is constructed chiefly as a response to the Italian colleagues, Gianfranco Bettetini and, especially, Francesco Casetti. This very late dialogue with the Italians is interesting in light of the fact that Italian critics were among the very first to discern problems with Metz's commitment to linguistic homologies over thirty years ago. Indeed, Metz was, at the first stages of his efforts, exposed to and shaped by Italian semiotic debates still barely known in the English speaking cinema studies. When Metz was completing the essays which would comprise his two-volume Essais (whose partial translation English readers know as Film Language), he was invited to participate in the debates held in Pesaro in 1967, '68, and '69.7 His participation in these debates, and with the Italian semioticians (principally Eco) led to certain reformulations incorporated in Language and Cinema. Emerging from those debates, where Eco and Metz were poles apart on the question of the status of the lin guistic model in any prospective semiotics of film, a certain brand of semi otic inquiry emerged that pursued a course, sometimes successfully, some times precariously, between the adoption of strictly Sausurrean linguis tics—and this was Metz's share—and a broader semiotic model that was derived (by Eco, very pointedly) from C.S. Peirce. Eco has never returned to the problems of cinematic code semiotics, but other Italian scholars did; and the first major works came from Emilio Garonni and Gianfranco Bettetini.8 However, Metz's primary object of criticism in this Italian tra dition falls on the recent work of Francesco Casetti, the heir of the Italian film semiotic project. Casetti's work represents the most fully sustained contemporary voice in Italian semiotics of the cinema. (As Buckland informs us, Casetti's sec ond to last book is in translation and forthcoming from the University of Indiana Press.9) When Metz turns to Casetti, he is tacitly invoking the now-ancient debate which served as the backdrop against which his own semiotics was silhouetted in the 1960s. The Italian semiotic tradition still brings a deep problematic to bear on Metz's theorizing, that of the validi CJFS • RCEC 67</page><page sequence="6">ty of the linguistic analogy for a theory of the cinema. The "risk" that Metz finds in Casetti's work—of a theory of filmic enunciation which relies on deixis and falls into an "improper" homology with linguistics—and the rea son why, consequently, Metz formulates his own essay as a response to Casetti's work. But the problems now become complex, and I would urge anyone interested to look at both the Metz and Casetti "Face to Face," included here, as a collégial confrontation staged by Metz. Buckland's introductory essay offers a summary of the position of French theorists who worked in the wake of Metz. His description of their specific linguistic orientation is that it is f&gt;osf-Saussurean and he takes this to be an advance. French critics have moved toward Noam Chomsky, he declares. To be more precise, they have moved toward Transformational Generative Grammar, a project that involves a group of (mostly American) theoreticians. Chomsky is the most instantly recognizable figure. However, by isolating Chomsky's work, and regarding it as normative, Buckland diminishes the complexity and rigor of the debates.10 Nevertheless, Buckland's news is that Chomsky's work and TGG have shaped the new French generation of film semioticians and he devotes a great deal of the collection to texts that demonstrate this supposed advance in detail. Buckland sees these French critics redirecting semiotics away from Saussurean orthodoxy, while retaining the code-modelling enterprise that Metz pioneered. Nowhere is this more clearly illustrated than in Michel Colin's "The Grand Syntagmatique Revisited," revisited that is by being slightly rewritten and reinterpreted by way of the TGG. However, and perhaps sensing the disparity within the TGG school, this linguistics by itself cannot support the new film semiotics that Buckland promotes, and he must acknowledge this. He does so, however, without hesitating to opt for the TGG as the likely platform of research, and at the same time as an avenue for continuity with the classic Metzian semiotics. Nonetheless, neither TGG nor Chomsky can replace Saussurean lin guistics as it functioned as central and supporting paradigm for the classic film semiotics. Hence Buckland's move—to fracture the primacy that this new linguistics can impose on its object, the cinema—guides every step of his introduction. The problem is really an out-and-out "return to the word" that threatens a new version of linguistic imperialism. Against this danger, Buckland makes "neither-nor" gestures like the following: Research in semiology has continued unabated in the 1970s and 1980s, especially in France, Italy, and Holland. Far from disappear ing, film semiology has expanded from a "classic" framework to a 68 Volume 7 No. 1</page><page sequence="7">"new" framework which encompasses transformational generative grammar, cognitive science, a renewed interest in enunciation theory (in both film and television), and pragmatics. Very little of this work has been translated into English or even acknowledged byAnglo American film scholars. The function of this anthology is to collect together a representative set of papers in film semiology which go beyond—but which do not dismiss—its structural linguistic founda tions. This sort of oscillation also explains the division of the volume into three parts: "Section One: Film Semiology, Transformational Generative Grammar, and Cognitive Science",- "Section Two: Film and Enunciation Revisited",- "Section Three: The Pragmatic Tendency in the New Film Semiology." The reader is advised, therefore, to take this volume on a strictly piecemeal basis. There is more than one theoretical strategy at work across the essays (something Buckland is less than forthcoming about in his introduction). Even though all of them have good claims to being "semiological," and centered (as I have claimed) on Metz, it becomes ambiguous what the words mean to these writers as a group. A sympathet ic reading of this book may equally well lend support to or provide critical ammunition against the current "post-theory" discourse that has been cir culating for several years now. This is semiotic film theory, but without the pretenses of "grand theory," or even much unity in its semiological bases. Buckland hopes, "The aim of this anthology is therefore to chal lenge the Anglo-American perception of film semiology as a brief period in academic film studies." As far as such a perspective-setting aim of the project goes, the vol ume recommends itself highly. Many scholars would agree that new infor mation could only stimulate more discussion and perhaps even push the bounds of debate into new territory. As for the content of the various essays, recommendation must be more equivocal. Along with the entry by Metz one must include the Casetti piece as an indispensable contribution to the understanding of enunciation with which Metz takes issue. This is not to suggest that Casetti's paper is as lucid an exposition of his position as one would like. Quite the contrary, it is Metz who illuminates Casetti and not the reverse. One of the problems is the enigmatic "space" within which he wishes to designate the addressee in the cinema. Casetti describes the "space" of the addressee which "in the cinema auditorium, captures on screen the contours of a world, [and] is not a supplementary element but the necessary complement of the game: a CJFS ■ RCEC 69</page><page sequence="8">signpost, or entrance, into a scene." It is this insistence that the ambiguous space of the cinema is somehow to be identified with the auditorium that causes consternation to Metz, long and consistently an advocate of the "segregation of spaces" between the viewer sitting in the theatre and the film spectacle. And further along, Casetti adds to this ambiguous and equally cryptic definition: But what is filmic enunciation? By this term we mean the conversion of a language system (langue) into discourse,- that is to say, the passage from a set of simple virtual units to a concrete and localized object. In other words, enunciation is the fact of using the expressive possibilities offered by the cinema to give body and substance to a film. In decoding this definition of enunciation, rather than looking to psycho analytic conceptions of the subject of the cinema, we might actually pre fer to consider some proto-semiotic, earlier film theories, say those of Eisenstein or Eichenbaum, who also accent the concretion of a virtuality in filmic articulation. This is speculation, but one might want to take Casetti into a more solid sense of concretion than he allows himself. And its cor relation with what we now class as "cognitive film theory" might also be fruitfully interrogated. As far the "cognitive science" section of Buckland's book is concerned, the various entries indicate that the editor sees the work of Bordwell, Branigan, and Carroll as differing from the French cognitivism represented here by Dominique Château and Michel Colin. "Whereas Château and Colin develop and transform classic film semiology using concepts drawn from TGG and generative semantics, the [American] cognitivists employ concepts drawn for the most part from non-linguistic areas of cognitive science." This is palpably true. The Americans seem concerned to offer a psychological alternative to psychoanalysis more than they are interested in an alternative linguistic base for research—and that raises a host of ques tions. One of them is: Were theorists too quick to jettison linguistic impe rialism? Possibly, but taken as a whole, I still feel that the "return to the word" is in effect blunted by the multifaceted and tangential nature of the debate between TGG and generative semantics. This is borne out, for example, by Château's contribution, "Towards a Generative Model of Filmic Discourse." It is an excellent place to fix the methodological and epistemological position developed by the Colin and Casetti pieces. As such it opens up some very valuable questions concerning the new relation between film semiology and linguistics (like TGG). 70 Volume 7 No. 1</page><page sequence="9">If we look at Château's piece, we find a distinctive conception of the differences and similarities with Metz's work and, in this capacity, her piece serves as keynote for the essays that follow in that Château insists that there is a continuum with proto-semiotic, classical semiology, and con temporary linguistics. For example she declares for pluralism in linguistic models: In the course of the future development of film semiology, we shall continue to employ linguistics. In any case, it will no longer be a question of mechanically applying the technical methods, not only because they are open to critical discussion (there are many in linguis tics), or even because film is a specific language, but especially because it is not advisable to ignore the profound consequences of theoretical choice which guides us towards the science of language. The contem porary linguistic contribution rests entirely on the axiom according to which spoken language has priority over written language. And in order to justify her turn to the word—that is, her use of new lin guistics inside her cinema semiology—Château effects what can be regard ed as a Foucaultian move. She is interested not in a Derridean critique of the phonocentric or empiricism, but rather in the positivity "language" upon which the human sciences have developed systems of analysis. We will, for this reason, leave the last "word" with Château. Or rather, with Foucault,- for, if indeed Currie is right and the linguistic era is closed, then the project that Buckland has brought to light has already been superced ed. If not, and if we are still within the reign of the philological, as Foucault maintained at the end of The Order of Things, then a project which attempts to rescue a place for the subject inside the machinations of language is required still. Yet perhaps, considering the "dispersal" that the conception of linguistics (which arises vis à vis TGG) already harbors, then both of these scenarios are too dramatically negative. They conceal the real posi tive knowledge that this reflection on what is the international state of cin ema studies can offer, on any of a number of levels. In either case, the archeologist, the historian of ideas, and the film theorist can all be served well, if unequally, by this new collection of essays. After all, in the human sciences there can be no real dead ends, can there? Edoardo Moretti New York University CJFS • RCEC 71</page><page sequence="10">NOTES 1.

The work of Château and Jost are represented in the volume, while the com prehensive bibliography that Buckland provides offers ample opportunity for further research of the work of other theoreticians. Dominique Château is represented by one essay "Towards a Generative Model of Filmic Discourse" which was an essay spun from her own Ph.D. thesis at the Sorbonne and originally published in French as "Vers un modèle du discours filmique," Humanisme et Entreprise 99 (1976): 1-10. François Jost is represented by two pieces, "The Authorized Narrative," and "The Polyphonic Film and the Spectator." Both pieces are, in part, found in Jost's Un monde a notre image: énonciation, cinéma, télévision (Paris: Klincksieck, 1992). The original publi cation dates of these pieces should reveal to us the range and persistence of the theoretical debates in France. 7. Some of the original contributions to these debates by Metz, Pasolini, and Eco can be found in Bill Nichols, ed., Movies and Methods Vol. I (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976). 8. Bettetini's second book was translated into English as The Language and Technique of the Film (The Hague: Mouton, 1973), but his other work, includ ing the work that Metz refers to frequently throughout this essay (La conver sazione audiovisiva: problemi dell'enunciazione filmica e televisiva [Milano: Bompiani, 1984]), has not. As for Garonni's work, which is substantial, it has not been translated into English at all. Only one essay appears in English, perhaps translated during a moment which was in the midst of the linguistic euphoria: see Emilio Garonni, "The Heterogeneity of the Aesthetic Object and Problems of Art Criticism," Afterimage 5 (Spring 1974): 68-79. 9. Francesco Casetti, Dentro il sguardo: II film e il suo spettatore (Milano: Bompiani, 1986); it was translated into French in 1990 as D'un regarde l'autre, by Jean Châteauvert and Martine Joly (Lyon: Presses Universitaires de Lyon, 1990). 10. For an excellent introduction to, and gloss of the TGG debates see Geoffrey J. Huck and John A. Goldsmith, Ideology and Linguistic Theory: Noam Chomsky and the Deep Structure Debates (New York: Routledge, 1996). Huck and Goldsmith make the amazing claim, especially in light of Buckland's project, that Generative Semantics, as a unified project, has failed. Or rather, it was an "exemplar/' failure. While Chomsky was one of its initial proponents (or 72 Volume 7 No. 1</page><page sequence="11">rather one who was initially associated with the approach), he was also one of the factors in its collapse as a unified paradigm. In fact Huck and Goldsmith, both of whom were students at MIT during the height of the debates, lend insight into the position of Chomsky within the larger constel lation of theorists. In doing so they point out that Chomsky was involved in Generative Semantics only to the extent that he grew out of the movement and developed his own ideas and program: "It was a theory that for a time in the late 1960s attracted a large number of adherents, produced impressive results, and had a substantial and lasting impact on the course of future work in the field. The Generative Semantics movement also challenged, with a good deal of brio and flair, the alternative—known as Interpretive Semantics— that was then being developed by Noam Chomsky" (1). The extent to which the Buckland volume understands and acknowledges the history of genera tive semantics is indeed an interesting question which can be left open to further study. He does provide what seems to be a responsible gloss of Chomsky's theory, yet his familiarity with the larger debate is not apparent. CJFS ■ RCEC 73</page></plain_text>
