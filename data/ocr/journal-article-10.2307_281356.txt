<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES in promoting archaeology, let alone funding it. On the positive side, it is apparent that much of the archae- ology being done in developing nations is not being paid for by the governments, but rather by various development agencies as parts of their overall project costs. The problem is in opening lines of communi- cation between all involved parties, and, once again, of establishing into the national conscience the im- portance of cultural resources. Part V of the volume is a critique of rescue archae- ology in the New World. Particularly interesting are George Aarons's (Jamaica National Trust Commis- sion) observations regarding underwater archaeology. Thomas King's comments on why, despite all the mon- ey being spent on archaeology in the United States, we still are not happy also makes interesting reading. This is especially true regarding his remarks on archaeolog- ical contractors. Bennie Keel somewhat balances King's gloomy conclusion that "while the rescue archaeology program in the United State is very big, it is not nec- essarily very good" (p. 156). Equally appropriate are George Gumerman's observations about the perceived division between managing archaeological resources and research. In Part VI, a summary of the conference's accom- plishments and several resolutions are presented. Jose Luis Lorenzo, an archaeologist with the Instituto Na- cional de Antropologia e Historia in Mexico, provides a concise summary, highlighting several salient aspects of the conference. One of his statements, in particular, is especially relevant: "Dear friends, for that there is no need to do rescue archaeology because nothing is rescued. If the results are not published, there is no need to have done the fieldwork" (p. 178). George Gumerman makes a somewhat surprising statement, indicating that if we emphasize the role of contract archaeology over that of traditional academic research, we may well be saving only the spectacular or old sites. The research, he states, "helps us to un- derstand the importance of the less spectacular sites" (p. 180). If anything, the situation is often the opposite of what Gumerman suggests: CRM studies are, by law, forced to deal with all types of sites, including the less impressive ones. One only can assume that Gumerman was not referring to the United States, but rather to other countries where there may be a preoccupation with spectacular sites. In any case, his remarks that both contract archaeologists and university researchers need to work together is well taken, even if it often is ignored. The final part of the volume consists of four short papers dealing with various aspects of rescue archae- ology. These, in a sense, are out of place here. Hester's paper, in particular, is at odds with the generally upbeat tone of the Conference. While the points he makes are pertinent, a discussion of "Archaeology on the Cheap" is perhaps not appropriate. Two of the other three pa- pers provide examples of projects in the United States (Georgia) and Ecuador, while the third briefly sum- marizes rescue archaeology in Australia. In conclusion, Rescue Archaeology should be must reading for both CRM practitioners and for anyone contemplating research in a foreign country. It is clear that Western archaeologists are no longer going to be able to conduct "colonial archaeology" without regard for their host country's own archaeological programs and feelings of cultural patrimony. The conference was an ambitious undertaking and I hope that we can look forward to many more. I only would like to see them expand to a greater international focus. While this may be unwieldy, it certainly would be appropriate. For example, in the Near East, a part of the world with which I am more familiar, many countries take an extremely active role in resource protection. And, sometimes even lithic scatters are considered impor- tant! Academic Freedom and Apartheid: The Story of the World Archaeological Congress. PETER UCKO. Duckworth, London, 1987. xiii + 305 pp., appen- dices, indices. ?9.95 (paper); ?18.00 (cloth). Reviewed by J. Desmond Clark, University of Califor- nia-Berkeley. The Man from La Mancha? A more accurate main title for this book would be The Story of the World Archaeological Congress as Seen Through the Eyes of Its Secretary. Indeed, a sub- stantial portion of the text is frankly autobiographical and, in some measure, an "ego trip" (p. xiii) as the author himself implies. The book is written in a "racy," informal style and, indeed, makes very intriguing read- ing (apart from the occasionally faulty grammar) and is full of interest in the details it provides of the behind- the-scenes organization that preceded what was in- tended to be a major international conference. The World Archaeological Congress (WAC) is claimed to be the first truly "World Congress." How- ever, as the Organising Secretary of the Nice, 1976, 9th Congress of the International Union of Pre- and Protohistoric Sciences (IUPPS) pointed out with Pro- fessor Tobias, in both Nature and Science, in numbers of people and countries represented this far surpassed the WAC and the Third World also was well repre- sented. It is clear that, almost from the beginning the WAC-the 1 th Congress of the IUPPS-was envis- aged by its secretary as being quite different from the traditional IUPPS conference of working scientists meeting to impart and discuss their most recent re- searches, here described as very short addresses from a rostrum "in a context usually aimed primarily at social intercourse" (p. 22). The WAC was intended to be a forum for all interested in the past and not merely for professional archaeologists and allied scientists. In- deed, the last of the major themes of the WAC "Ar- chaeology and the Very Remote Past" was the one about which the secretary "had most qualms" (p. 34), largely because it relied "entirely on professionals only": in short, it was to be scientific. The main objectives were thus not those normally envisaged by the IUPPS or by scientific meetings in general. Indeed, if we are to believe the numerous statements in the text, neither the author nor most members of his Committee had any respect at all for the IUPPS as an organizing body for archaeology and, in one instance, reference is made 213</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY to the "total contempt" (p. 24) in which certain of his committee members held its executive. An additional aim of the WAC was to show how subjective all ar- chaeological interpretation has always been and how political leaders have always manipulated the past to further their national political ends. The Smith re- gime's attitude to Great Zimbabwe in Rhodesia and the racist use of archaeology in Germany by the Nazis are cited as examples though no reference is made to the Marxist interpretation of the past in the USSR (p. 32). The original intention, therefore, was that the WAC would depart as far as possible from the traditional IUPPS conferences and archaeology was even referred to by one participant (p. 195) as "the hobby of the middle, upper crust Europe" but, although the IUPPS is said to provide "a huge emphasis on western Eu- rope" (p. 26) this statement is contradicted by Appen- dix V (p. 277) showing the organizational structure of the IUPPS. Not only was it intended that the WAC participants would not necessarily be scientists but groups of admittedly nonscientists specifically were to be included so that the political role of archaeology in their everyday lives could be explored. It seems to this reviewer that a conference with the aims of the WAC could well serve a useful purpose- as was, in fact, suggested by one speaker at the plenary session (pp. 196-198). Such a conference probably would fill a real need in providing a meeting ground for regional groups interested in their past but that do not have professional archaeological expertise or the interest to pursue it as a scientific discipline. The question of a moral stand against apartheid and the consequent banning of South African and Namib- ian participants did not arise until late in 1985 when it seemed likely that funding promised to the Organis- ing Committee might be withdrawn if these scientists were allowed to come. This seemed to be largely due to local Southampton opinion though it is unclear how the students would be able to withhold use of accom- modation, presumably the property of the university, in a vacation period. However that may be, the impres- sion given is that the stand against apartheid was large- ly motivated by a fear of losing funding as the Minutes of the Executive Committee meeting of October 15th state (p. 69): The Treasurer reiterated his view, which the Executive Committee accepted, that had South African attendance not been prevented for the WAC 1986 then the financial via- bility of the whole Congress would have been likely to have collapsed. It was with this advice in mind that the Executive, mindful of its duties as Directors ... reiterated its view that, on purely pragmatic grounds, the Executive had no other option than to repeat its previous decision to ban South African participation from the Congress. Could it perhaps be that the moral issue took second place to the financial? From the subsequent publicity, it certainly ensured that the academic world was made aware of the existence of Ucko and the WAC that provided a front the better to pursue the takeover of the IUPPS. Bearing all this in mind and remembering that the IUPPS's stipulation to the organizers had been, as it always is, that the conference was to be open to all bona fide archaeologists and related scientists with no distinction of race, country, or philosophical per- suasion, it is not at all surprising that the WAC failed to consult with the IUPPS Secretary-General and Per- manent Council before introducing the ban, not only on South African and Namibian archaeologists, but also on anyone from other countries who was working in South Africa. The Organising Secretary even went so far as to make enquiries concerning an American archaeologist excavating in the Orange Free State, as to whether she was employed by a South African mu- seum, so as to know whether she should be banned or not; an activity somewhat reminiscent of witch-hunt- ing. The IUPPS had no alternative but to disown the WAC at the extraordinary meeting in January, 1986. Incidentally the account given of this Paris meeting of the IUPPS Executive Committee is a remarkable mis- representation of what actually was said and took place and gives one to think about the accuracy of the reports of other meetings. As a result of the disavowal by the IUPPS, the whole of the WAC British Committee of distinguished ar- chaeologists resigned, leaving only Ucko and his non- archaeological Southampton treasurer. That a new committee could be formed says much for Ucko's pow- ers of persuasion. This withdrawal of IUPPS sponsor- ship also resulted, predictably, in the resignation of many who previously had been prepared to take part, one stating that the use of the WAC as "a forum for attacking the inconsistency of other international bod- ies towards South Africa . . [would be] a gross distor- tion of the purpose of an international conference" (pp. 123-124). The registration fees of ?200 of most, but not quite all of those who had decided not to participate when the WAC ceased to be the 1 1th Congress of the IUPPS, were kept by the committee and not returned in spite of requests to do so by the withdrawing participants. This currently is the subject of litigation. The reason for this action-the practical encouragement of Third World participation-has long been an objective of most of those archaeologists and related scientists who work outside Europe and not a few of them have been responsible for the professional training of Third World nationals. That more Third World professionals have not attended the IUPPS, or any other Congress for that matter, is largely a financial matter. Professor Ucko and his Committee attempted to overcome this by set- ting a high registration fee of ?200 to provide a "float" that could be used to finance Third World participation where needed. This was a laudable attempt and there were probably few who could afford it who begrudged this contribution. However, the aim of the WAC in this respect is not new and there are not a few organizations and indi- viduals who have been providing help to this end for several years now. The primary need-that of profes- sional training-now is being met, albeit slowly, even in South Africa where the same archaeologists the WAC has most condemned are training the first Black South Africans to be so qualified. The major problem is, how- ever, financial. Where is the funding to come from to bring Third World participants when no financial sup- port is forthcoming in their own countries? The WAC attempted to solve this by retaining the registration 214 [Vol. 54, No. 1, 1989]</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES fees of those who withdrew after the IUPPS sponsor- ship was removed but this was a one-time only solution and most people are not going to be caught a second time. Foundations and other grant-giving bodies do what they can but still more is needed. Possibly the answer, as has been suggested by the WAC, are regional meetings which generally are not so costly. However, it still is essential that professionals, particularly those in isolated parts of the world, participate in the larger international meetings where the full range of archae- ological sciences is represented. Possibly UNESCO might have an answer where it comes to finance. A typical example of the problem is seen in the IUPPS meetings in Nice in 1976 and in Mexico City in 1981. In Nice, 3,127 participants from 94 countries attended whereas at the 1981 meeting only 400 were able to participate and the Third World was not nearly so well represented. It would clearly be a major benefit if the IUPPS could meet in Africa, India, South and North America, and China but how to finance such meetings and ensure that a representative body of professionals is present? The retained registration fees of nonattend- ing participants helped the WAC to defray the expense of a number of Third World professionals and others, but the Congress is ?90,000 in the red (p. 216) at the end of it all. Wherein does the answer lie? The latter part of the book largely is devoted to vi- gnettes of the conference proper and a discussion of the moral virtues of antiapartheid. However, it does not seem to have been appreciated that the South Af- rican government would not be at all influenced by the banning of archaeologists-adherents of an unpopular discipline that disproves their racial theories about the peopling of South Africa. Sport, of course, is another matter and one that is felt very deeply among white South Africans as a whole. Nor is any adequate ap- preciation expressed of the constant and ongoing efforts of most South African academics to enhance-or even retain-the existing degree of multiracism within their universities, often against considerable government pressure. At the time of writing, the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg is flying its flags at half staff as a continuing protest against new government restrictions on universities. It is unfortunate that a number of references in the text-often purporting to be precise quotes-are done in such a way as to misrepresent the actual meaning of an occurrence or of what was said. "Since the book is a personal account of my own view of events" (p. ix), the author perhaps can be excused the manner in which actions and statements have been manipulated in their telling so that "supporters" are always the good guys and the opposition always the bad guys. As ex- amples, I would refer to the anti-South African Res- olution passed (ultra vires, as it happens) by the IXth Pan-African Association on Prehistory and Related Sciences in Jos in December, 1983, to which my reply as "quoted" (p. 106) entirely has misrepresented the meaning of what was said. What I did say was that some expatriate participants (I do not use the word "Europeans") abstained from voting and, since there were only three participants from Black African coun- tries other than Nigeria (the host country) present, the meeting hardly could be considered as reflecting the opinions of Black Africa in general. Very different from the purport of the "quotation." Again, the statement that the April, 1986, conference in Berkeley escaped disruption only by keeping a low profile (which may, perhaps, be true) but that no participants went onto the campus wearing their conference badges in con- sequence (which is quite false) is sheer fabrication (p. 144). The overall flavor of the book gives a strong impres- sion that the moral stance of antiapartheid was elab- orated only after it appeared that local Southampton opinion would make financing and running of the WAC difficult, if not impossible, if South African and Na- mibian scientists took part. A great deal is made of the pros and cons of this situation and one is left with the feeling perhaps, that qui s'excuse s'accuse. In any case it is very unfortunate that the edifice of apartheid prob- ably has not thereby been weakened in the very least. The book, while scarcely to be recommended as es- sential reading for academics, is interesting as a de- tailed account of how a determined individual dealt with what promised to be a difficult situation in such a way as to give the impression, however erroneous, of being the organizer of a humanitarian crusade. The leftist element clearly welcomed the opportunity the WAC presented to attack the IUPPS, referred to (p. 4) as being a dinosaur, and, indeed, there is much need for restructuring. But dinosaurs very successfully lasted for 135 million years and much renewed interest at- taches to them today. At any rate, they are preferable to some other critters -moles for instance. One cannot help but be impressed by Ucko's ingenuity when faced with the reorganization, virtually single-handed, of the WAC, and he is to be congratulated on having done so under considerable difficulties. At the same time, however, the book gives the impression that if he had devoted as much time and energy to archaeology as he has to politics, the discipline might have been much enriched. Even if no blame for any future split in the world of archaeology is accepted by the WAC and, presumably, by its Organising Secretary (who already has had experience of such a rift in Australia), it is a bit steep to expect science to accept the statement (p. 225): If schism does result from the WAC it will be very largely due, not to the imposition of the ban, but on the one hand to a combination of the actions taken by a number of grant- giving bodies. such as the Royal Society, the British Acad- emy, the National Science Foundation and the Wenner- Gren Foundation, and, on the other, to the refusal by the IUPPS to recognise legitimate world interests in archaeol- ogy. If the former insist on funding participation only at meetings where free access to all is permitted, they are ef- fectively imposing their own ban on personal liberties, and restricting their grants to only one kind of academic-in this instance the academic who does not feel strongly enough about apartheid to follow the call to boycott South African academic participation in meetings. We must all try and ensure that the potential schism in world archaeology this exercise has threatened to create will be avoided by the projected reorganization of the IUPPS so as to make it financially possible for all professional archaeologists and related scientists from First to Third World Countries to attend its meetings 215</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY and so make certain of the continuing international forum it should provide for the world of archaeology. The Wolves of Heaven: Cheyenne Shamanismt, Cere- monies, and Prehistoric Origins. KARL H. SCHLE- SIER, with drawings by WAH-PAH-NAH-YAH (DICK WEST). University of Oklahoma Press, Nor- man, 1987. xviii + 214 pp., illustrations, biblio., index. $25.00 (cloth). Reviewed by Jeffrey R. Hanson, University of Texas- Arlington. In Wolves of Heaven, Karl Schlesier reconstructs the prehistoric origins of the Tsistsista branch of the Chey- enne and places their genesis as a tribal entity in the Northern Plains. Drawing on an eclectic assortment of perspectives and methodologies including cognitive- linguistic, ethnological, and archaeological approaches, Schlesier sets about his task, which is to place Cheyenne antiquity in the Northern Plains beginning about 500- 300 B.C. Focusing on Tsistsista "world description" and the cultural centrality of the Tsistsista Massaum or earth-renewal ceremony, Schlesier's aim is to pro- vide a "reinterpretation of Tsistsistas culture accept- able to the Tsistsistas" (p. xii). The author warns the reader in advance that his interpretation of Tsistsistas culture history "contradicts all the extant literature on the Cheyenne" (p. xi). In the first chapter, Schlesier provides an emic view of Tsistsistas world description and shamanism. Heavily drawing on Tsistsistas cosmologic and cos- mographic classifications, Schlesier uses a cognitive- linguistic perspective to describe Tsistsistas shaman- ism and theories of hunting. In chapters two and three, Schlesier describes the world description of Northern Siberian societies and draws parallels between them and North American Algonkian hunters. For example, parallels are drawn between the role of Siberian shamans in petitioning spirit "game keepers" for animal renewal and the Tsist- sistas Massaum. Based upon comparisons such as these, Schlesier argues for a homologous relationship between Algonkian-speaking peoples (including the Cheyenne) and northern Siberian hunters. Chronologically, proto- Tsistsistas, as a vanguard of southward Algonkian mi- grations from a Taiga Biome, immigrated around 1000 B.C., arriving in the Plains 500 years later (p. 43). The following chapter is devoted to a description of Tsistsistas medicine hunts, spirit-lodge rituals, sweat- lodge ceremonies, and the "contrary" institution. These data are used as evidence for a Tsistsistas entrance into the Northern Plains prior to that of other known Plains tribes. Chapters five and six describe the role of the Mas- saum ceremony in Tsistsistas history and prehistory and its validation of the Black Hills as the Cheyenne's first permanent homeland on the Plains. This chapter is particularly rich in details of this important Chey- enne ceremony. It is through the Massaum camp, with its spatial, cosmological, and astronomical orientations that Schlesier traces ancient Tsistsistas territory, as evi- denced by the Bighorn and the Moose Mountain med- icine wheels (p. 87). Chapter seven, Early Tsistsistas in the Northern Plains, bears the most relevance for archaeologists. Here Schlesier attempts to correlate known linguistic groups with prehistoric archaeological complexes and phases: Aztec-Tanoan (Kiowa) with Pelican Lake; Athabaskan with Avonlea; non-Tsistsistas Algonkians (Suhtai, Arapaho, Atsina) with Laurel; Caddoan with "Valley phase"; and Tsistsistas with Besant (pp. 111-135). It is the association of Besant with Tsistsistas that is crit- ical to Schlesier's assertion that this group was "cre- ated" in North Dakota around 500 B.C. In his final two chapters, Schlesier sets the general features of Algonkian shamanistic world interpretation in the context of prehistoric climate change and tribal migration. Comparing Tsistsistas shamanistic inter- pretation with those of distant Algonkians like the Yu- rok and Mahican, and contrasting the Massaum with the Mandan Okipa ceremony, Schlesier concludes that the Massaum owes more to a homologous Algonkian heritage than to Siouan diffusion. Finally, Schlesier ar- gues not only for the evolutionary success of Algon- kian-Siberian world description, but for the opposition of scientific rationalism and shamanistic world views and the objective superiority of the latter. While sha- manistic world view "allows recognition of the other," rationalist world view is anthropomorphic, mechanis- tic, and ethnocentric (p. 189). Wolves of Heaven is unquestionably a thought-pro- voking book. Its contribution, however, seems to lie not in the archaeological or ethnohistoric implications of Schlesier's interpretations, but rather in the philo- sophical and epistemological problems associated with writing history that will "be acceptable" to particular ethnic or interest groups. Schlesier's disdain for sci- entific rationalism appears evident in his uncritical and often superficial use of archaeological data and eth- nologic method. From a scientific rationalist perspec- tive, Schlesier's book exhibits numerous flaws. His eth- nographic "evidence" is highly selective and bears little or no control. His use of archaeological data lacks both depth and detail and his diffusionary conclusions lack both distributional and chronological controls. His failure to include ethnohistoric and archaeological ma- terials documenting a Cheyenne horticultural episode is a mystery. Archaeologists and ethnohistorians in- terested in a scientific-rationalist contribution to Chey- enne culture history may be disappointed. However, those interested in the philosophy and epistemology of extreme ethnohistoric relativism will find Wolves of Heaven thought provoking.
