More specifically, this article explores the interplay of history {historia) and fable {fabula). In the sphere of thought, fabula is the equivalent to materia in nature. Both are described by Bacon as being "versatile" and "pliant." In Bacons system of knowledge, philosophy, as the domain of reason, starts from historiae and fabulae , once memory and the imagination have fulfilled their cognitive tasks. This means that, for Bacon, there is no such thing as a pure use of reason. He advocates a kind of reason that, precisely because it is involved with matter s inner motions (its "appetites," in Bacons characteristic language), is constitutively 'impure'. The article shows how the terms historia and fabula cover key semantic areas in defining Bacons philosophy: historia may mean "history" as well as "stor y? fabula "myth" as well "story." In both cases, we can see significant oscillations from a stronger meaning (close to those of matter and nature) to a weaker one (connected to wit and imagination), as if the power of nature decreases moving from histories and myths to stories. On the other hand, there are cases in which Bacon seems to stick to a diachronic view of the mean- ing of fables and histories, such that the transition from myths to history, especially natural history, is described as a collective effort towards reality and enlightenment.

Philosophy as a Form of Historically Determined Knowledge It may not sound like a very Baconian thing to say, but Bacon did in fact devise a coherent system of philosophy The way he articulated this system was in the form of a detailed inventory, in which he examined the actual state of human learning by scouring the disciplines as they had been historically established, stressing in each case lacunae, blind alleys, directions to take and potential developments. As such, one may say that Bacon s philosophy relies heavily on the notion of historicity of knowledge. The epistle to the reader which opens Henry Savile s The Ende of Nero and Beginning of Galba, published in 1581, can be taken as a manifesto of this particular view of history as a form of philo- sophical investigation. Here the anonymous writer, whose initials A. B. may stand for those of Anthony Bacon, deploys a series of enthyme- matic implications concerning the value of learning, the use of history and the philosophical suitability of Tacitus: There is no treasure so much enriches the minde of man as learning; there is no learning so proper for the direction of the life of man as History; there is no his- torie (I speake onelie of prophane) so well woorth the reading as Tacitus. The prefacer s conclusion at the end of this chain of propositions does not come as a surprise: "no treasure so much enriches the minde of man" as Tacitus. Tacitus is presented as a model of both history and learning. The anonymous writer supports this statement with a well- argued chain of reasons: learning completes and perfects nature; history conveys knowledge by means of examples (rather than precepts); and Tacitus has maximised the advantages of both history and philosophy by condensing the vast amount of information resulting from the knowledge of the past into concise and pointed bits of memorable prose. A. B. explains that the Roman historian "hath written the most matter with best conceite in fewest words of any Historiographer ancient or modern." That is to say, Tacitus is a treasure that "enriches the minde</page><page sequence="3">64 G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 of man" because he managed to encapsulate the most profound insights concerning human nature into ingenious turns of phrases. Although obscurity is the high price one has to pay for combining thought and concision, it is, nevertheless, a kind of obscurity that is rewarding. Tacitus "is harde," says the anonymous writer, but the understanding thrives on reading difficult texts: " D ifficilia quae pulchria : the seconde reading ouer will please thee more then the first, and the third then the second."1 As Bacon declared in Partus temporis mas cuius, Tacitus "utters the very morals of life" (better than any Plato or Aristotle) - "Aristo telis et Piatonis plerique mirantur; sed Tacitus magis vivas morum observa- tiones spirat" (SEH III 538). 2 In Bacons opinion, oracular maxims may rouse the activity of think- ing by fostering interpretation. The use of examples is the other positive contribution provided by historical knowledge to which the anonymous prefacer refers. Examples accustom the human mind to dealing with particulars. Addressing the question of the form of writing ( modus scribendi ) that is more suitable to the knowledge of particulars, Bacon argues in De augmentis scientiarum that, when the subject is as "variable" as matters of "negotiation and scattered occasions," the best approach is the one followed by Niccolò Machiavelli in his handling of political 1} Henry Savile, The Ende of Nero and Beginning of Galba.

And this is not only a point of order, but of substance also. For when the example is laid down as the ground of the discourse, it is set down with all the attendant circumstances, which may sometimes correct the discourse thereupon made, and sometimes supply it, as a very pattern for imitation and practice; whereas examples alleged for the sake of the discourse, are cited succinctly and without particularity, and like slaves only wait upon the demands of the dis- course (SEH 1 769; V 56). Here Bacon is pointing to two very different uses of examples. One is merely illustrative, such that particular instances meekly submit to argu- ments devised by reason. The other use is constitutive of learning, such that new knowledge is unfolded from interpreting particular instances. What is more, knowledge drawn from particulars is also better equipped to understand the often elusive nature of particulars. A productive inter- pretation of experience - be that natural or human - requires an unsen- timental attitude and the ability to read particular circumstances as specific cases of more general patterns. 2. History as an Account of Material Motions The tension between history (historia) and fable (fabula), which reflects, at a disciplinary level, the tensions between the underlying faculties of the soul (memory and imagination, in the first place), pervades Bacons work as a whole. In the sphere of thought, fabula is the equivalent to materia in nature. Both are described by Bacon as being "versatile" and "pliant."3 Philosophy, as the domain of reason, starts from historiae and fabulae , once memory and the imagination have fulfilled their cognitive 3) Bacon, De sapientia veterum (SEH VI 625): "Neque me latet quam versatilis mate- ria sit fabula, ut hue illuc trahi, imo et duci possit; quantumque ingenii commoditas et discursus valeat, ut quae nunquam cogitata sint belle tarnen attribuantur."

This means that for Bacon there is no such thing as a pure use of reason. He advocates a kind of reason that, precisely because it is involved with matter s inner motions (its "appetites," in Bacons char- acteristic language), is constitutively 'impure'. For this reason, we might safely say that, in Bacons philosophy, natural histories are largely stories of appetites and their resulting move- ments. Against a tendency to trivialise the ontological relevance of mat- ter - regardless of whether the trivialisation in question derived from Aristotelian and Platonic presuppositions, or from more recent attempts to provide mathematical accounts of matter (as in Galilei s case, for instance) - Bacon suggests a philosophical model in which matter is real and physical. Indeed, Bacons matter is brutally real and physical in that it is riddled with appetites. In this sense, perhaps, his natural histories may be described as 'Stoic' accounts of nature. Indeed, one of the most striking characteristics of Bacons natural history is the lack of a clear distinction between the moment of natural observation and that of the ethical inquiry. It is worth remembering here that the interpreter of nature has to be of good morals ( moratus ).4 To give just one example, one can read the following passage taken from Historia densi et rari , concerning the dilatations that occur "by meeting and embracing a friendly body": History 1. Sugar and some gums (like tragacanth), infused in liquors, dissolve; for (like sponges) they willingly slacken their parts to take the liquor in. 2. Paper, animal hair, wool and suchlike porous bodies so open themselves up when immersed in liquors, or otherwise moistened, that they become softer, more easily torn and practically rotten. 3. Sudden joys, as you have with good news, on seeing something you have been longing for, and so forth, although they embrace not the body but only the fan- tasy, dilate the spirits of animals strikingly, and they sometimes do it enough to risk sudden fainting fits or death. The imagination does the same in sexual love (OFB XIII 116). 4) The expression can be found in Bacons De interpretation naturae sententiae XII (SEH III 787).</page><page sequence="6">G . Giglioni /Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 67 In this observational protocol, Bacon describes the bodies under scru- tiny as capable of loosening the resistances and to join other bodies following one of the basic appetites of nature, i.e., the movement towards lesser concentrations of matter ( motus congregationis minoris ).5 The same process takes place, on a greater scale and at a level of greater complexity - the human body - when specific affects expand the spir- its assigned to perform vital functions. The fact that matter is consti- tutively appetitive (and that this appetitive structure can be replicated on every level of organisation, from the simplest physical aggregations up to the most complex political bodies) explains why Bacon s histories of nature are also ethico-political histories, and descriptions of ethical behaviour or narratives of political events can also be read as natural histories. As histories of material passions, the natural histories com- piled by Bacon are records of characteristic customs' of matter. Such customs range from the tendencies inherent in material particles to the passions of human beings. The 'joy' that characterises a piece of paper eager to absorb water is after all not very different from the joy that is caused within a human being by the dilation of animal spirits when he or she hears a piece of good news. The difference is only in terms of complexity. In both cases, the same form of rational behaviour is at work in a material substratum that is continuous, stretchable, largely pneumatic, always in a state of tension between rarefaction and contrac- tion. In this sense, Bacon s natural history is closely connected to his meta- physics of matter. As the subject of natural history, nature may present itself under three conditions: 1) expansion and assimilation; 2) devia- tion from the norm and resistance; 3) return to the norm and recon- stitution of the original balance (instauratio) . In Bacons opinion, the three conditions correspond to three kinds of natural history: the his- tory of ordinary natural phenomena, the history of prodigies and mira- bilia , and the history of mechanical disciplines. From this point of view, the division into three principal kinds of natural history - history of generations, anomalous generations and 'regenerations' (arts) - mirrors the ontological division into natural species (kinds), anomalies and artificial things, or the three key notions of Bacon's philosophy: expan- 5) See Bacon, Novum organum (OFB XI 394-96).</page><page sequence="7">68 G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 sion, resistance and reconstitution (which, in turn, correspond to the three fundamental tendencies in matter: motus hyles , motus antitypiae and motus libertatis) .G Presented as a comprehensive investigation into matter in all its forms, Bacons natural history covers the domains of both natural and artificial productions.7 By its very nature, the world of natural history is a world of effects and not of causes. Effects result from a static consideration of nature (i.e., matter at rest), causes concern nature as a dynamic entity (i.e., matter in motion); the former constitute the world of physics, the lat- ter that of metaphysics. The principal objects of natural histories are bodies examined in their various degrees of ontological texture and pliability ( consistentia ) as they are in a state of rest (dum quiescunt ).8 By contrast, Bacon means by causes a limited number of original motions which shape a countless array of natural phenomena; i.e., the appetites underlying the transformations of matter. While the effects of the appe- tites may be subject to experimental observation, the nature of the appetites is subject to philosophical scrutiny. In the Historia densi et rari , Bacon recommends, when possible (si fieri possit ), to study bodies in their physical transformations - rarefactions, condensations, expan- sions and contractions - so as to get closer to the very sources of matter 6) See Bacon, Cogitationes de scientia humana (SEH III 189); Parasceve ad historiam naturalem et experimentalem (OFB XI 454). 7) On Bacons notion of natural history, see Peter Anstey, "Locke, Bacon and Natural History," Early Science and Medicine , 7 (2002), 65-92; Marta Cavazza, "Concept baconien ďhistoire naturelle," Les Études Philosophiques, 3 (1985), 405-14; Paula Find- len, "Francis Bacon and the Reform of Natural History in the Seventeenth Century," in History and the Disciplines: The Reclassification of Knowledge in Early Modern Europe , ed.

The fundamental question, then, becomes: Can one write a natural history of the appetites of matter? An intriguing remark at the end of the Parasceve ad historiam naturalem et experimentalem condendam casts some light on this important question: while we should compile our natural histories of material beings {corpora) in a spirit of collaboration and following the directions indicated in the treatise, the natural history of the original motions - which Bacon also call the "cardinal virtues" of matter - is a job that Bacon reserves only to himself {earn nobis ipsis reservavimus ), for he hesitates to involve other people in this project before human beings have reached a more intimate understanding of reality {priusquam homines cum natura paulo arctius consuescere incoe - perint) (OFB XI 472). The history of the natural forces (the appetites) requires a philosophical initiation that prepares the mind to recognise the constitutively appetitive character of nature. When in the course of his natural histories Bacon hints at the role of material motions and appetites, he is not indulging in speculative digressions (interpreted sometimes, in an awkward manner, as edifying proclamations of an epistemological kind); rather, he is championing a shift to a different level of analysis - that is, an analysis that points to the dynamic com- ponents of nature. The question of the "difference of movements" that account for the various properties of bodies demands necessarily a com- mitment of a philosophical kind, for the great majority of motions escape the direct grasp of the senses ( non percipiuntur immediate per sensum) (OFB XIII 64). Bacons New Atlantis, the "fable" which provides a parabolic' understanding of the appetites of matter, represents a soci- ety ruled by philosophers who know the nature of the appetites and, most of all, know how to control them. However, this knowledge of appetites is reserved to a few initiates in the mysteries of nature: while histories of natural phenomena should be pursued and written in ways that allow everyone interested in the enterprise to collaborate, histories of appetites should be left to more philosophical minds.9 9) See Giglioni, "Fantasy Islands: Utopia , The Tempest and New Atlantis as Places of Controlled Credulo usness," in World-Building and the Early Modern Imagina -</page><page sequence="9">70 G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 Natural history, therefore, belongs to the preparations for the philo- sophical Sabbath {parasceve). This is the state of knowledge in which the mind will be reconciled with nature and will be able again to mod- ify reality. The vision of being- which in the end is matter structured by the forces of natural desire - arrives only with the completion of a long process of intellectual apprenticeship involving the knowledge of sensible forms. As a result of this training, which has both cognitive and ethical components, the mind becomes apt to recognise similarities and differences among natural phenomena and learns how to identify regularities in structures and processes, schematismi e texturae. Induction is the name that Bacon gives to this process of articulating patterns from large inventories of instances. Most of all, it is through induction that the mind learns how to demystify the idola that have adulterated our perception of nature and to become accustomed to identifying realities of a superior order; i.e., the "forms" of matter. Devoting itself to the practice of natural history and exercising increasingly more abstract inductions, the mind sets out to know reality and becomes aware of its own prerogatives and limitations. Far from being spellbound by deceit- ful representations (idola), which convey the vain desires and expecta- tions of human subjectivity, the mind manages to distinguish itself from reality and to start the process whereby it can reconcile itself with nature s apparent otherness. Bacon calls this process "medicine of the mind" ( medicining of the mind). Through the practice of writing about nature, the mind re-adapts itself, however reluctantly, to nature.10 tion , ed.

History as the Exercise of Thinking about Matter Bacon considers philosophy to be an exercise in thinking which must necessarily have a material starting point, different from the thinking activity itself. The starting point in question can be a particular assump- tion, a fragment of the most ancient wisdom in the form of a fable, or a series of observations and experiments. In this sense, thought is always thought about a given material ( sylva , copia , supellex). In the aforementioned Parasceve , Bacon defines natural history as the material ( materies ) through which one can build a new philosophy {ad condendam philosophiam ), what he also calls "the work of the inter- preter" ( opus interpretis). Matter, as Bacon makes it clear, must be of a good quality (proba), plentiful (copiosa) and duly organised (apte digesta ) (OFB XI 450). "[W]hat I have in mind," Bacon explains, "is plainly that streams of experiments of the mechanical arts should flood on every side into the sea of philosophy" (OFB XI 465). Only in this way can the foundations of a "true" and "active" philosophy - the philosophy of the Sabbath - be established. Natural history is also described as the nursing-mother of knowledge in the "childhood" of philosophy (a stage in the growth of learning in which relying on "old wives' tales" (fabulae aniles) would cause irreparable damage), and as a "store of things" (promptuarium rerum), to which the interpreter of nature goes every time he needs a particular material. Natural history, Bacon goes on to say, should not be understood as a shop where to display one s mer- chandise, but like the hold of a ship, where things are ordered in such a way that they take as little room as possible and can be found as soon as they are needed (OFB XI 456-60). In the dedication to Prince Charles, premised to the Historia natu- ralis et experimentalis ad condendam philosophiam and published in 1622, Bacon writes that a natural history organised following the right criteria (bona et bene instituto) contains the "keys" to bring forth knowl- edge and works (OFB XII 4). In the preface to the same work, Bacon repeats his recurring invitation to hold one s mind in check (ut ánimos submittaní) and to secure the knowledge of the greater world (OFB XII 6). Learning does not advance by "reading books of philosophy," "through disputations" or "meditating." On the contrary, the natural philosopher should start with some material (sylva et materies ), where he can practise his exercise of knowledge. Bacon sums up the discussion</page><page sequence="11">72 G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 concerning the ways through which we can attain the goal of reconsti- tuting knowledge of reality - the instauratio scientiarum - by pointing out the asymmetrical relationship between method and natural history : my Organum, even if it were finished, would not carry forward the Instauration of the Sciences much without Natural History, whereas Natural History without the Organum would advance it not a litde (OFB XII 12). When reading passages like these, one wonders whether there is in fact a difference between method and natural history in Bacons philosophy, such that the method would play the role of the 'form' and natural history that of the 'matter'. It seems more correct to say that method and history go hand in hand; even better: one should say that there is no method without natural history, and in many cases natural history can generate philosophical knowledge even without relying on a method. Bacon does not deny that natural history can be pursued as an end in itself, by concentrating on the innumerable particulars of which the world is made up. However, the decisive point is that natural history should be used as the "prime matter" of philosophy (¡ materia prima philosophiae)-, that is to say, as a source of information from which one can extract the principles of true induction ( verae inductionis supellex sive sy Iva). In the Parasceve, the use of natural histories as prolegomena to philosophy is presented by Bacon as his great innovation compared to the literature produced in the past by Aristotle and Pliny. The end of natural history is not the mere description of phenomena preliminary to their deductive treatment, or the immediate pleasure of narrating and reading, or the individual profit that derives from knowing the world of nature, but the elaboration of axioms (OFB XI 454-56). In this sense, Bacon's natural history has strong philosophical commit- ments, being directed to advancing our interpretation of nature. Most of all, natural history should contribute to expanding the cognitive range of the intellect, by freeing it from the subjection to narrowly subjective categories and by providing a representation of the world {mundi imago) that matches reality {qualis invenitur •):</page><page sequence="12">G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 73 In the history which I expect to find and am intent on we must see above all that it has a wide range ( late pateat) and is made to the measure of the universe {ad mensuram universi). For the world is not to be tailored to the slenderness of the intellect (which is what has been done hitherto) but the intellect should be stretched and opened up to take in the image of the world as we really find it (OFB XI 459). Bacon s natural history differs from previous models in its firm rejection of any possible lapse into anthropomorphic projections and in its atti- tude of complete openness towards natural experience in all its forms. In Cogitationes de scientia humana , Bacon describes the characteristics of such experience: Human beings need to be reminded that they should go back to the experience (ut experientiae se restituant) and stop relying on the intellects' fabrications and pretended meditations, and that amongst the experiments and the instances they should not despise or reject trivial things ( res exiles) as unimportant (leves), ordi- nary things (res vulgatae) as superfluous (superfluae), mechanical things (res mechanicae) as cheap (viles), foul things (res turpes) as unworthy (indignai), anom- alous things (res praeter naturam) as offensive or unpropitious (odiosae aut infaus - tae) (SEH III 194-95). Bacon regrets that an "arrogant and destructive" view has long prevailed amongst philosophers. According to this opinion, the dignity (majestas) of the human mind is lowered if it is occupied too much and too long with experiments and particular things, known through the senses (sensui objectai) and defined by matter (in materia terminatae ), especially if these things seem to demand exertion to be investigated, are perceived to be vulgar as objects of mediation, inelegant as topics for speeches, sordid with respect to action, of an infinite number and insignificant in terms of subtlety (SEH III 194). The vindication of the prosaic nature of experience represents the char- acteristic feature of Bacon s natural history. The attention with which Bacon examines details that appear to be the most trivial and phenom- ena that present themselves as the most familiar reveal in fact a mind that is in a constant state of observation (OFB XIII 74, 84). The end of natural history is summed up splendidly in section six of Parasceve :</page><page sequence="13">74 G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 In the first place, this history should comprise matters so commonplace (res vul- gatissimae) that people would imagine that, as everyone knows about them, it would be pointless to write them down. In the second place, it should comprise things vile, illiberal and repellent (for to the pure all things are pure , and if money extracted from piss smelt sweet, so much more does light and information wher- ever it comes from). In the third place, it should also adopt things frivolous and childish (and no wonder as we must become again quite childlike); and lastly, things which seem to be far too subde because in themselves they have no use. For (as I have already said) the things collected in this history are not set down for their own sake, and so their standing is not to be judged by their intrinsic worth but by how they can be adapted to other purposes, and fertilize the field of philosophy (OFB XI 465). We can recapitulate the defining characteristics of the experience according to Bacon by listing the qualities of the objects to be investi- gated: "trivial" ( exiles ), "unimportant" ( levis ), "ordinary" ( vulgatus ), "cheap" ( vilis)y "illiberal" ( illiberalis ), "filthy" ( turpis ) and "anomalous" ( praeter náturám). The expansion of the boundaries of human experi- ence will break the spell that keeps the intellect prisoner of its own ghosts and it will enlarge the sphere of what can be known, so that "no longer shall we, like people bewitched, tread our narrow round; instead we shall bestride the walls of the world" (OFB XI 463). We can therefore say that one of the meanings of matter in Bacons philosophy coincides with that of "material." Silva , supellex and copia - technical terms of the rhetorical tradition - suggest that the natural philosopher needs a repository of materials, which represents the start- ing point for his interpretations. The difference with the rhetorical tradition is that for Bacon the res are not the topics under treatment, but the objects that really exist in nature in their crude factual exis- tence.11 In Bacons opinion, there is no method that is objectively separated from the matter under investigation, nor can anyone conceive of a thinking activity that is abstracted from the object of thought, its "material." Induction, the process through which the forms of nature are identified, emerges from the exercise of writing natural histories. u) For the rhetorical and philosophical notion of res as that which can be said of a thing, see Lorenzo Valla, Repastinatio dialectice et philosophie , ed. Gianni Zippel, 2 vols. (Padua, 1982), 1: 71, 123; II: 450 (with reference to Quintilians De institutione oratoria , I/iv: 18).</page><page sequence="14">G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 75 We can know nature only after we have recounted its history. Within the list of the missing disciplines or disciplines that need to be reformed (. Novus orbis scientiarum, sive desiderata , "The New World of Sciences, or Desiderata"), Bacon points out how inductive history (i.e., natural history) is a part that needs to be further developed (SEH I 838). In a way, one could interpret Bacon s notion of induction as an attempt to replicate the motions of matter at a higher level of awareness: starting with natures original tendencies {perceptiones ), then investigating ani- mal and conscious reactions (. sensus ), and finally arriving at a level in which the light of the mind is reconciled with the reality of things (j intellectus ). 4. Natural History of Philosophy There is no doubt that for Bacon natural history provides the materials for the exercise of philosophy. However, it would be wrong to limit Bacon s natural history to a merely ancillary and instrumental role with respect to the activity of speculation. On the contrary, Bacon insists that philosophy is pursued by writing histories. A natural history of philosophy does not mean to provide systematic collections of ideas as they recur in the human mind (that would be indulging in idola specus ), but to carry on philosophical investigations in which the activity of thinking is necessarily bound to material and particular objects. Human thought can in no way extricate itself from this level of immediacy and materiality. Otherwise, the consequence would be that of transforming the exercise of philosophy into a series of futile abstractions. As such, history means for Bacon the basis of philosophical reasoning. Whereas for Descartes (and we might even say for the philosophical tradition as a whole), knowledge can be said to be philosophical when it subjects to criticism any position that presents itself in the form of a given assumption, for Bacon it is precisely assumptions that represent the catalyst for philosophical knowledge. In philosophy, presuppositions par excellence are the very beginnings of human thought, the obscure vestiges of a natural rationality lost in the night of time (the sapientia veterum). From this point of view, Bacon may be said to belong to a certain humanistic tradition according to which philosophy is first and foremost hermeneutical analysis of questions defined by specific his-</page><page sequence="15">76 G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 torical circumstances, and not a new and uncontaminated source of knowledge discovered through a process of pure thinking, which is never challenged by the changing facts of experience.12 Speculations (&lt; contemplationes ), when they draw on the material data of human expe- rience (suppetente uberiore materia :), go further and deeper than any form of self-reflective thought (SEH VI 621). The specific historical datum from which one should start in phi- losophy is therefore the 'fable' of the ancients.13 In Bacons opinion, we can philosophise moving from primordial symbols, produced by col- lective and ancestral memory and imagination. Understood in this way, fables are the "facts," the historical sediments of human thought. Amongst Bacons writings, De sapientia veterum theorises the view of philosophy as an interpretative exercise concerned with the "stories" of the most ancient humankind (so much so that it can be read as a fully- fledged "natural history" of philosophy). However, such an approach recurs in all his principal works. In book eight of De augrnentis seien - tiarum , for instance, Bacon expounds the basic principles of a natural history of political prudence by examining biblical proverbs (SEH I 36-37). The Essayes are dotted throughout with fables and emblems, and certainly not for purely ornamental reasons. We could sum up this point by saying that for Bacon one can reach the truth following two paths, the path of nature and the path of his- tory; at the end, though, both paths join in one vision of reality {res) that is no longer adulterated by human presuppositions and expecta- tions. There is therefore a natural induction, which converts the history of the body of nature into the knowledge of the very patterns of things 12) The aforementioned Valla is an example of this attitude. See, for instance, the 'Prooemiurn to the Historiae Ferdinandi regis Aragoniae (Paris, 1528), sig. AAiiir. 13) On Bacons views on ancient fables, see B.

Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 77 ( exemplaria ), their schematismi and texturae , and there is a cultural induction, which unfolds the natural history of human myths and leads to the knowledge of the archetypes of thinking. In both cases, one reaches a form of knowledge in which the dramatic divisions between reality and appearance cease to exist, and the human world is reconsti- tuted ( instauratus , we might say) into a unity of thought and image, notion and word, outside and inside, soul and body. For this reason, we might say that, in Bacons opinion, to write his- tories is in a way to recount stories. Admittedly, the precedents for such a position are rhetorical. Quintilian had already pointed out that writ- ing history has a narrative, not a demonstrative purpose {ad narrandum, non ad probandum)}A Bacon, though, adds a key speculative component to this discussion. In his view of philosophy as an activity that is closely connected to the exercise of natural history, the process of thought is characterised by a remorselessly narrative aspect. Bacon is perfectly aware that the activity of recounting, like the art of writing, is a domain in which an author is constantly engaged in both conjuring up and exorcising ambiguity. It is significant to note that, in the field of oral communication, the ability to recount stories is presented as a form of cunning. In the Essayes , Bacon presents the act of communication as a complex exercise in self-display and self-defence: Some have in readinesse, so many Tales and Stories, as there is Nothing, they would insinuate, but they can wrap it into a Tale; which serveth both to keepe themselves more in Guard, and to make others carry it, with more Pleasure (OFB XV 72). As the most ancient fables of humankind reveal the truth while hiding it, so the activity of recounting retains part of the original tendency to communicate a truth while protecting and wrapping it with disquieting symbols, images and words, meant to conceal invaluable fragments of knowledge deriving from nature s primeval wisdom. The pleasure that attracts the reader is not simply a rhetorical bait. Wisdom is poetic precisely because of the material nature of human experience. The perfect and natural correspondence between names and the subjects 14) See Quintilian, De institutione oratoria , X/ 1: 31.</page><page sequence="17">78 G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 represented in the ancient fables (conformitas et indicium nominum) is for Bacon further evidence that, originally, reality, thought and language formed one organic and vital whole (SEH VI 626). Indeed, as in the case of particular disharmonies of colours and sounds or in the percep- tion of smells and flavours, the senses sometimes have the opportunity to grasp deeper harmonies and identities, so the often ambivalent and contradictory appearances of the original symbolic forms lead the senses to recover the lost patterns of the most ancient thinking (SEH II 611). To understand better Bacon s views on archetypal fables as the "mate- rial" for philosophy, it is worth referring to his position concerning the interplay of nature and convention in human language. In Bacons analysis of human communication, language in all its forms (whether it is made up of abstract and arbitrary signs, or of images rich in ana- logical associations; whether it is expressed in a written or oral form) represents the physical dimension of thought. Reason and discourse are in the same relationship as the one that connects the soul to the body. What in De augmentis scientiarum Bacon characterises as the "art of transmission' is based on the use of words and letters; that is, on speak- ing and writing. Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the field of com- munication is wider than all that can be expressed through words, whether they are written or spoken. Every system of signs is based on the principle that "whatever can be divided into differences sufficiently numerous to explain the variety of notions (provided those differences be perceptible to the sense) may be made a vehicle to convey the thoughts of one man to another ( vehiculum cogitationum de homine in hominem )" (SEH I 651; IV 439). From this point of view, gestures, hieroglyphics, emblems and "real characters" can all be considered appropriate means of communication. By virtue of their materiality, gestures and hieroglyphics "have always some similitude to the thing signified," and are "a kind of emblems." The real characters, instead, refer directly to things according to a conventional and arbitrary con- nection, "silently agreed upon by custom" (SEH I 652-53; IV 440). In the Essayes Bacon makes clear that " Nature is Often Hidden; Some- times Overcome; Seldome Extinguished. Force maketh Nature more violent in the Returne: Doctrine and Discourse maketh Nature lesse Importune: But Custome onely doth alter and subdue Nature "</page><page sequence="18">G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 79 (OFB XV 1 18-19). As a result, he assigns to languages, ethical norms, traditions and institutions the key task of adapting the vital energy of nature to human civilizations. Likewise, the signs involved in the pro- cesses of communication among human beings depend partly on a natural correspondence with the life of matter, and partly on the estab- lishment of arbitrary conventions between things and meanings. Nature and arbitrary conventions are therefore inextricably inter- twined in every aspect of human languages and their many uses. By adopting concrete images, capable of stimulating the imagination, philosophical writing can foster the activity of thinking by introducing analogies among the various domains of reality. This certainly happened at the beginning of times, Bacon argues in De sapientia veterum , but it is occurring "even now," every time "any one wishes to let new light on any subject into mens mind, and that without offence or harshness," relying on the help of analogies (auxilium similitudinum) (SEH VI 628; 698). An emblem, Bacon argues in De augmentis scientiarum , "reduces intellectual conceptions to sensible images {deducit intellectual ad sen- sibile)', for an object of sense always strikes the memory more forcibly and is more easily impressed upon it than an object of the intellect; insomuch that even brutes have their memory excited by sensible impressions; never by intellectual ones" (SEH I 649; IV 437). 15 The section of De augmentis scientiarum devoted to the examination of the art of government, for instance, bears the title consul paludatus ("the statesman in armour"), using an exemplum - "as is our wont" ( more nostro ), Bacon adds (SEH 1 792; V 79). In the already mentioned Novus orbis scientiarum, sive desiderata , one of the sections is entitled "Phi- losophy according to the Ancient Fables" (SEH I 838; V 121). The use of parables, Bacon writes in De augmentis scientiarum , was common among Hebrew and ancient sages, and it had a fundamental social function: "as men found out any observation which they thought good for life, they would gather it and express it in some short proverb, par- able, or fable" (SEH I 769; V 56). Any true parabolic expression con- tains therefore a reservoir of information, "a kind of arc," writes Bacon 15) In this article, I use the word emblem' in the ample sense given to it by Bacon: as a form of deductio intellectualis ad sensibile. See also SEH I 649, 653.</page><page sequence="19">80 G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 in De sapientia veterum , "in which the most precious portions of the sciences were deposited."16 One might sum up the way Bacon looks at the interplay of thought, reality and writing by saying that in his account the relationship between fable and history has a synchronic as well as a diachronic dimension, and it is a relationship that corresponds to the already mentioned ten- sion between the practices of hiding and displaying meanings and truths. From a synchronic point of view, insofar as the fable has a sym- bolic content, it is fraught with meanings that cannot be exhausted at the literal and descriptive level of historical, matter-of-fact accounts. In De sapientia veterum , Bacon illustrates this point suggesting a vital and creative function for the process of oblivion: The most ancient times ( antiquitas primaeva ) (except what is preserved of them in the scriptures) are buried in oblivion and silence: to that silence succeeded the fables of the poets: to those fables the written records which have come down to us. Thus between the hidden depths of antiquity and the days of tradition and evidence that followed there is drawn a veil, as it were, of fables, which come in and occupy the middle region that separates what has perished from what survives (SEH VI 625; 695). On the other hand, the transition from fables to histories - that is to say, the diachronic process through which the life of nature becomes aware of itself and its history - brings to the fore the demythologising and secularising tendency embedded in the advancement of human learning. Fables, Bacon explains in De augmentis scientiarum , "were formerly substitutes and supplements of examples {exemplorum vicarii et supplemento), but now that the times abound with history {tempora historiarum copia abundent ), one aims at the intended target in a more correct and productive way {ad animatum scopum rectius et alacrius col- limator)" (SEH I 769; V 56, with slight change to the translation). Inevitably, the synchronic and diachronic dimensions, which are constitutive of the very fabric of fables, produce a certain tension between the perception of reality and its symbolic representation. On the one hand, histories gradually replace fables, all the more so because, 16) SEH VI 619: "Parabola veluti area quaedam est, in qua pretiosissima quaeque scientiarum reponi consueverunt."</page><page sequence="20">G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 8 1 as Bacon points out in the Essayes , symbolic representations of things become laden with stylistic excesses ( infected with the stile of the poets), which go so far as to cover the most important {sad, and serious) aspects of human experience (OFB XV 177). Moreover, as Bacon acknowl- edges, a non critical use of philosophical allegories leads to vain and arbitrary results: "Not but that I know very well what pliant stuff {ver- satilis materia ) fable is made of," he argues in the important preface to De sapientia veterum. In this case, the inherent pliancy of the narrative material is not an argument in favour of fables, for the "vanity" of tell- ing stories may affect philosophy and science (here Bacon refers to the Stoic Chrysippus and the alchemists) (SEH VI 625; 695). On the other hand, the fables of antiquity lay bare an extraordinary conformity between the meaning and its external manifestation {tanta et tam evidens cum significato similitudo et conjunctio ), "in the very frame and texture {textura) of the story as in the propriety of the names by which the persons that figure in it are distinguished" (SEH VI 626; 698). There are therefore two main uses of symbols (and of writing in general), uses that, as Bacon remarks, seem to be almost contradictory: parables "serve to disguise and veil the meaning {ad involucrum et velum), and they serve also to clear and throw light upon it {ad lumen et illustrationerrì)r He wonders whether this ambiguity is a form of happy coincidence, which results from the accidental convergence of historical circumstances, or rather the ultimate cunning of human rea- son. Did the fables emerge from the depths of the original wisdom of nature, which has accompanied the evolution of material life since its very beginnings, or were they the product of human intention, not necessarily in terms of individual accomplishments, but as a collective enterprise? Bacons answer is complex. Like nature, the truth, too, likes to hides itself. No interpretative violence {ulla ingenii violentici) can undermine the cognitive import of the emblematic-mythological lan- guage. It is a form of communication {modus docendi) which transcends the limitations of creative intention {omnis vanitatis expers) and that points to what is useful and necessary for the transmission of knowl- edge. For this reason, since "in the old times, when the inventions and conclusions of human reason (even those that are now trite and vulgar) were as yet new and strange, the world was full of all kinds of fables, and enigmas, and parables, and similitudes." Therefore, "as</page><page sequence="21">82 G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 hieroglyphics came before letters, so parables came before arguments" (SEH VI 628; 698). We can therefore say that a kind of natural and collective imagina- tion, in close connection with the accidental progress of humankind and the larger evolution of the material universe, has produced striking but veridical representations of reality. The absurd character of most fables is precisely evidence that these representations cannot have been devised by a mind, inventive as it may be: There is yet another sign, and one of no small value, that these fables contain a hidden and involved meaning (sensus occultus et involutus)' which is, that some of them are so absurd and stupid upon the face of the narrative taken by itself, that they may be said to give notice from afar and cry out that there is a parable below. For a fable that is probable may be thought to have been composed merely for pleasure, in imitation of history. But when a story is told which could never have entered any mans head either to conceive or relate on its own account, we must presume that it had some further reach. What a fiction (for instance) is that of Jupiter and Metis! Jupiter took Metis to wife: as soon as he saw that she was with child, he ate her up; whereupon he grew to be with child himself; and so brought forth out of his head Pallas in armour! Surely I think no man had ever a dream so monstrous and extravagant, and out of all natural ways of thinking (SEH VI 626- 27; 697). For Bacon, the very fact that the narrative creativity of pre-literary civilizations did not follow the path of human intentionality and instead it ignored all criteria of narrative plausibility is a clear indication that the versatility of the primeval fabula , like the primeval sylva of matter, is a faithful mirror of the life of nature. The factual representation is so outrageously absurd that the mind is entitled to look for a deeper mean- ing underneath. In this case, the simple acceptance of the empirical account would result in an inane confirmation of the already seen and known. As is often the case with Bacon, observations (visa) needs to be aligned with thoughts (cogitata). As in the study of material reality, the analogy ad universum (i.e., knowledge of things modelled upon the patterns of nature) should prevail on the analogy ad hominem and ad sensum (i.e., comparing natural realities by referring to a narrowly anthropocentric meaning), likewise, the original meaning of the ancient fables transcends the logic of individual reason. The most important thing for Bacon ([a]nte omnia illudapud nos maxime valuit, et plurimum</page><page sequence="22">G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 83 ponderis habuit ) is that most of these primordial fables were not created by the poets who first recounted them to us (Homer and Hesiod), but were reported by them as the bequest of a collective wisdom, close to the reality of things and foreign to the games of individual imaginations. Such fables have been handed down - ex veteri memoria - as stories to which we believe from time immemorial ( tanquam prius creditae et receptae ), and not as inventions contrived by the fervid imagination of individuals who are particularly gifted and witty ( tum primo excogitatae et oblatae) (SEH VI 627). The absurdity of the primal fables, Bacon goes on to say, should be seen as a circumstance which gives them in my eyes a much higher value: for so they must be regarded as neither being the inventions nor belonging to the age of the poets themselves, but as sacred relics and light airs breathing out of better times, that were caught from the traditions of more ancient nations and so received into the flutes and trumpets of the Greeks (SEH VI 627-28; 697-98). The traces of the most ancient poetic wisdom which are still recogniz- able on the surface of the fables of pre-literate humankind are to be regarded as genuine expressions of metaphysical knowledge. Indeed, sometimes Bacon seems to suggest that in some particular circumstances poetic descriptions are still the most suitable forms to communicate the most abstract truths. There are themes, Bacon writes in the Essayes , which should be left to the symbolic imagination {poesy). Criticising certain speculative effusions from Seneca, Bacon argues that poetry, and not philosophy, is the sphere in which human thought is allowed to transcend the limits of empirical reality ( Transcendences are more allowed) (OFB XV 18). The same reference to Seneca recurs in De sapientia veterum , where the question of the possible divine nature of the human being is examined by resorting to emblems (SEH VI 675). Here it is worth pointing out again that Bacon does not limit the use of emblematic writing to De sapientia veterum . He relies on emblems every time he feels the need to go beyond the level of empirical imme- diacy towards more abstract truths or to wrap in sensible forms notions that otherwise would be perceived as too abstruse. In Novum organum , for instance, while he is explaining the difference between appetites of assimilation and stimulation, on the one hand, and those of impression, on the other, he describes the former as motions of a 'Jovial' generation</page><page sequence="23">84 G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 {motus generationis Iovis), for their products are capable of lasting in time, while he calls the latter motions 'Saturnine' ( motus generationis Saturni ), for their effects persist only to the extent that the cause is present and they are immediately "devoured" by the appetite of matter (OFB XI 404). In book eight of De augmentis scientiarum , Bacon main- tains that it is more appropriate and fruitful to investigate some par- ticular questions belonging to the art of doing business ( doctrina de negotiis) by commenting upon biblical proverbs {parabolae Salomonis) rather than enunciating universal norms (SEH 1 750-68). In the Essayes , while focusing on the complex theme concerning the nature of politi- cal deliberation, he recurs again to the mythological images of pagan antiquity, which represented in a graphic manner {set forth in figure) the union of power with the ability to make political decisions {counsel!) through two emblems, the weddings of Zeus and Metis and Athenas birth from Zeus' head (OFB XV 64). The story, which in itself is grisly and revolting {monstruous fable), as Bacon repeats in De sapientia vet- erum , reveals an important arcanum imperii {secret of empire)', i.e., the necessity for rulers to rely on the judgment of competent and trusted advisers (OFB XV 34). While in De sapientia veterum the myth of fully armed Pallas issuing from the head of Zeus is a disquieting and senseless image, all the more so because, as we have seen above, it reveals the extent to which the most profound wisdom of nature is perceived as a foreign body of knowledge by individual human beings, in the Essayes the same myth is used at a different level, as a way of rationalising an ancient truth. In both cases, though, such writing is presented by Bacon as a delicate mechanism to protect and express meanings. The signs devised by human beings to make sense of reality - a reality which otherwise would be indecipherable and ungovernable - are a way of re-establishing a relationship with the appetitive life of nature and of translating the language of material desires into a stable language, trans- parent to the human mind. 5. Conclusion For Bacon, thinking is always thinking ^something, something that is other than thinking. The thinking subject cannot break the spell of inane self-reflectivity and self-referentiality (i.e., the disease of self-</page><page sequence="24">G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 85 assuring intentionality) without extending its activity outside itself towards an object. Radicalising the meaning of rhetorical sylvae and supelle etiles, Bacon defines the object as a forest of assumptions and given meanings. He argues that in our attempts to expand our knowl- edge of things, we always start from a sylva, and in such a sylva we may be lost at first. In gnosiological terms, a sylva is what materia is in onto- logical terms. As shown in this article, the terms historia and fabula cover key semantic areas in Bacons philosophy: historia may mean 'history as well as 'story, fabula myth' as well 'story'. In both cases, we can see significant oscillations from a stronger meaning (close to those of mat- ter and nature) to a more effete one (connected to wit and imagination). To put it in another way, the power of nature decreases in moving from histories and myths to stories. On the other hand, there are cases in which Bacon seems to stick to a diachronic view of the meaning of fables and histories, such that the transition from myths to history, especially natural history, is described as a collective effort towards real- ity and enlightenment. However, it is well known how ambiguous Baconian instaurationes may be: they mean both recovery and regen- eration. In a way, the ancient fables, as sediments of human thought, are the most original matters of fact. Authentic fables are unconscious and unin- tended, a genuine reflection of the innermost motions of matter. Pre- cisely because they have emerged from the forest of the primal appetites of matter, they can be used as material to philosophise (the poetic wis- dom of the ancients). They lead the mind from the blind desires of matter to the light of the intellect. Appetitus, perceptio, sensus and intel- lectus : this is the path that follows the analogy ad universum and has the fables of the ancients as its starting point. The witty fables of the moderns follow the analogia ad sensum and ad hominem , and therefore they lead nowhere. However, the vital and meaningful source of true fables is so ancient that in a way it is lost in time. Can it ever be recov- ered? Can we proceed to an instauratio of the most ancient wisdom of nature? A possible answer to this question is offered by Bacons views on induction and the writing of natural histories. To reason by induc- tions based on natural histories is like going backwards. It is a rediscov- ery of the innermost motions of matter, its original life and cupidity,</page><page sequence="25">86 G. Giglioni / Early Science and Medicine 17 (2012) 62-86 by describing its constitutive tendencies and patterns (formae , schema- tismi , processus , texturae and exemplaria). In one sense, the fabula is at the beginning and the historia at the end (what I have called cultural induction); in another, the historia is at the beginning and the fabula is at the end (natural induction). In both cases, the exercise of thinking cannot do without a given body of knowledge, a sylva and a materia .</page></plain_text>
