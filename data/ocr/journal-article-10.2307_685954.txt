<plain_text><page sequence="1">Entropy and Disorder WITH much interest I read the note by Dr Martin J. Klein entitled 'Order, Organisation and Entropy '.1 Dr Klein's argument is essentially correct, but the thesis brought forward obtains its proper significance only when the sentence' entropy being the physicist's measure of disorder' (p. I58) is omitted. That sentence indeed is not true. Entropy is a measure for the number of microscopically distinguishable states which are compatible with a state ofa system, specified in the usual macroscopic way (the calculation of this number is the subject of statistical quantum mechanics). This conception is already contained in Dr Klein's words 'the entropy is low when the number of energy states, in which there is a non- negligible probability of finding the system, is small' (p. Is59). When the argument is considered from this angle, it is not at all strange that under comparable conditions a more highly organised system may have a greater number of distinguishable states than a less organised system and thus have a greater entropy. I believe that the use of the word ' disorder' in connexion with entropy is a mistake. It leads to anthropomorphic forms of reasoning which are often misleading. There is no 'disorder' in nature; any arrangement of the parts or of the states of a system has the same value from an objective point of view; it is human preference to consider an arrangement ordered, e.g. according to the sequence of. natural numbers, as something different from any other arrangement. The assertion' a system left to itself tends to a greater disorder ' has no real sense ; on the other hand the assertion that, in certain cases (with 1 'M. J. Klein, 'Order, Organisation and Entropy', this Journal, I953, 4, i58-6o0. 70</page><page sequence="2">ENTROPY AND DISORDER the exception of states to be reached only via' forbidden' transitions), 'a system realises all distinguishable states compatible with its macro- scopic specification' conveys a definite meaning and gives a basis for quantitative evaluation. With this assertion the conception of entropy as a measure of 'order' or' disorder' can entirely be discarded and there is much less chance for being led into fallacious speculations. The further advantage is gained that it becomes conceivable that for a being which could make more refined observations than is possible with our present physical methods, the entropy of a system would be reduced, since the number of microscopically distinguishable states compatible with the specification given by such a being would be less. In the ultimate case of a hypothetical being sensitive to complete microscopic specifications, every specified state of the system would be unique and would have zero entropy. Human beings seem to be able to act on certain distinctions which cannot be explained as a result of mere physical or chemical reactions, as far as we understand them at present. If the hypothesis is ventured that this is the outcome of some general property of all living beings, the proper formulation of which still is beyond our knowledge, new light might perhaps be shed on the meaning of entropy relations in life. Postscript: Dr Klein, in a letter directed to the undersigned, has asked me to mention that he intended the word 'order' to have no other quantitative significance than is given by its definition in terms of entropy, and that there is no real difference in basic point of view between us. He adds that the use of'disorder' as a synonym for entropy' did not originate with him. J. M. BURGERS Delft, Laboratorium voor Aero- en Hydrodynamica der Technische Hogeschool 71</page></plain_text>
