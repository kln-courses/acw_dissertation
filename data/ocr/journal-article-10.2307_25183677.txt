<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dance of Visnu: the spectacle of Tamil Alvars RAJU KALIDOS Is Visnu Nataraja? yes, according to the Alvars (Vaisnava saints of the Tamil country) Visnu is Nataraja. The pan-Indian tradition associates two important forms of Visnu with dance. They are Kaliyamardana and rasakrida, merry making sports of Krsna in the Gokula with gopts. According to the Cilappatikaram (Kataldtukatai 11. 37-63) Visnu presents mal while fighting with a demon, alliyam (a group dance) at the time rendition of Kamsa, kutam as Trivikrama, peti as the eunuch Kamadeva, an aspect of Visnu, and pavai is performed by Tiru, Sridevi, consort of Visnu. This seems to be an ancient tradition (c. 5th century a.d.), reiterated by the Alvars. The Alvars are Vaisnava mystics of the Tamil bhakti age, in total twelve in number. They have contributed enormously to literature, grouped under the heading, Naldyiratiwiyapirapantam "4000 Melodious Hymns" (cf. Hardy 1983: 247-50; Settar 1993: 223-40; Kalidos 1993: 181-88). The twelve Alvars are authors of 24 literary pieces, dated during the 5th~9th centuries a.d. The Alvars are grouped under three chronological heads as follows: Early Alvars: Poykai, Putam and Pey 5th?6th century Middle Alvars: Nam, Maturakavi, Kulacekarar, Tiruppan, 7th-8th century Tontaratippoti and Tirumalicai Later Alvars: Periya, Antal and Tirumankai 8th~9th century (cf. Zvelebil 1974: 101-104; Poykai to Putam 650-700, Antal 9th century, including Tontaratippoti).

The literature of the Alvars as such has not formed part of a serious iconologjcal study (cf. Zaehner 1962: 167-70), excepting those of the author and S. Settar (supra). The present attempt strives to cull out the relevant data on Visnu as a King of Dancers. Visnu being a dancer par excellence a number of epithets are coined by the Alvars which are pointers to the natah aspect. These epithets have their roots in words like atu and kuttu, meaning a dance. The most striking epithet is: Kutta^avallavehko, kuttu "dance", atu "perform", valla "able", em "our", ko "king"; giving scope to coin the phrase Nataraja "King of Dancers" (NAC 3.6). Atuvan "Dancer" (PTM 4.2.5) (cf. Atavallan of the Saivas in Kalidos 1996: 16) or Kuttan (PTM 2.1.9, 4-1-9, 5-I-I, 9-5-9, 10.1.9, PTML 11. 209-11), Catirmurtti "Lord who Dances" (MOLI 8.10.9), Kuttavamman "Dancing Lord" (MOLI 8.6.6), Mayakkuttan "Illusionary Dancer" (MOLI 8.5. all hymns), Atumamman "Father who Dances" (MOLI 1.8.1) or Kuttavappan (MOLI 6.2.11), Atarparavaiyan "Bird (?) who Dances" (PTM 9.9.10, MOLI 8.2.4), Ananku "Spirit" who dances (MOLI 1.6.3-4), Kulakan (MOLI 3.6.7), Vittakan (TM 3.9.9) and so on. The enigmatic phrase, Neyyati (PTM 1.1.5), also appears.2 Krma as Gopala is a dancer. The phrases, Kuttan-Kovalan (MOLI 10.1.6) and Kovalar-Kuttan (PTM 9.5.8) appear. Most celebrated among the dances of Visnu, in the Alvars' literature, is a particular mode called kutakkuttu (elaborated below) in which the Lord presents a recital, carrying pots on his head. Several epithets are coined after this mode. They are Kutakkuttan (MOLI 3.6.3,7), Kutamati (NAC 13.2, PTM 3.6.8, 5.5.6, 6.3.9, 6.9.4, MOLI 4.2.5), Kutakkuttar (MOLI 9.7.1), Kutakkuttanar (MOLI 4.2.5), Kutakkuttvamman (MOLI 2.5.11, 8.6.5), Kutamatukuttan (PTM 2.9.6, NAC 10.7, MOLI 4.10.10, 8.5.6. io.i.ii) and Kutamatiyakuttan (PTM 7.3.3), all meaning the Dancer who enacts the kutam. These epithets provide a very strong basis for the natah aspect of Visnu. The spectacular vision of the Alvars is that Visnu is Nataraja, Atuvan or Atavallan. The popular terminologies, used to mean dance, are attam (variants atu and ati), natam or nattam, kuttu, kiritai and vilaiyattu. The term catir (MOLI 8.10.9) is rarely used, meaning a dance or dance-drama, popular with the folk. Atu (NAC 10.5, PTM 1.5.1?7), is used redundandy. Natam (PTM 1.5.6) or nattam (NAC 12.5) is a synonym. The Lord's dance is tuyanatam "immaculate dance" (PTM 1.5.6) which he performs, ceytu (natanceytu PTM 3.9.7). Performance also requires training and so it is cultivated, natampayil, payil "training" (PTM 4.3.4). Dance comes by training and hence the phrase, payinratu "learn and dance" Periya 1.

The link between dance and ney may allegorically stand for a dance in its pure form or a cultivated dance, coming under any of the natyasastras; cf. tuyanafam PTM 1.5.6.</page><page sequence="3">Dance of Visnu: the spectacle of Tamil Alvars 225 (NAC 10.6). Such a dancer is Natampayinranatan "Lord who cultivated dance" (CAN 38, 86). The recital was a great event and so the dance is called manatam "Great Dance" (NAC 10.6).3 Kuttu is also a dance, pointed out by the phrases, kuttattu (NAC 5.2) and kuttatu (NET 16). The dance is also a group performance, kutiyati (kutu "mingle" PTM 4.4.7). It might as well be a sport or holy sport, tiruvilaiyattu (NAC 9.3). Natakam (MOLI 5.2.4), stricdy a drama (IM, VIII, PL V), is also dance and used with the prefix, kunikkum "stoop (to perform)" (MOLI 5.2.4). Kiritai (TM 2.9.11) is a sport (Skt. krida), linked with Krma's rasalilas, erotic games with gopis. It involved dancing with the gopis. The rich vocabulary, bearing on dance, used by the Alvars, proves beyond doubt that the dance motif was a familiar theme with the Vaisnavas. There are clues to certain specific dance types. Marakkal (kal "leg", maram "wood") was a folk dance, still prevalent in country festivals, in which men and women have artificial legs while presenting a recital. The Cilappatikaram associates this form with Mayaval, i.e. Devi. The Alvars consider Visnu as a performer of this mode, marakkal kuttatu (PTM 11.5.6). Another interesting ancient Tamil dance was kuravai, very much celebrated in the Cilappatikaram, and linked with dycciyar (Skt. gopis). There is a separate section of the book on Aycciyarkuravai in which the cowherds of Maturai perform to solicit the blessings of Kjsna. It is a group dance, perhaps rendered by men and women by forming circles and clasping hands (Subrahmanyan 1990: 295?96). The kuravai dance is linked with the dances of Visnu (PTM 2.5.4, 9.8.6, 10.8.9). ^ seems several types of dances were familiar to the Vaisnava tradition as there is a talk about palnatam "many a dance" (PTM 4.10.3). Elli was a type (sandhydtdndava? "[evening] twilight recital", earlier appearing in the Cilappatikaram (Kalidos 1996: 19) and noted by the Alvars (MOLI 8.6.1). Dance was a cultivated art as they talk of payinru "learn" or "train (oneself in the art)" (Til 46). In group dances the hands were clasped, kottdti (kottu "clasp" TI 54). In Tamil literary tradition, young ones are associated with childish pranks, called dttam. Krsna is supposed to have performed cenkirai (PTM 1.5. all hymns) and cappani (PTM 1.6.1-5). In such plays children clasp their hands (cf. kottay PTM 1.6.1), 2-5), toss the heads and move the body joyfully. These are natural performances and have nothing to do with the canonic types of dance. When compared with the Saiva tradition, the Vaisnavas have not left any legacy of sthalas (Mevissen 1996: 42) where dances of Visnu are important. In this respect, the Saiva notion of ampalam or cirrampalam "Little House" or ponnampalam "Golden House" of Nataraja of Citamparam (Younger 1986; cf. the "Sacred Arena" Narayanan 1995: 190-93) may be mentioned. There is no such exclusive stage of dance for Visnu but whenever the latter is said to present a dance recital, he is associated with a stage. Words like arankam (KPT 1.4, NET 19), manru (PTM 10.9.2), manram PTM n.2.1, 4.5.7, MOLI 4.2.2), kutam (PTM 4.5.1), colai "grove" (PTM 1.9.8, TMM 14, 17, 32) and patukatu "dense forest" (TM 3.6.8) are used to denote the stage where Visnu performs dances. All these are common to the Saivas and Vaisnavas. The word, ampalam, is not in Vaisnava usage. Arankam is typical of the Vaisnavas. It is more a bed-chamber for Ranganatha than a stage for dance but interestingly the reclining Lord himself is perceived as a Kuttan in the 3 This phrase is used by the Nayanmar in connection with the urdhvatandavam of Siva (cf. Kalidos 1996, 1996a). Trivikrama's striding posture is akin to the urdhvatandavam (Kalidos 1984: 17?20). Interestingly, Trivikrama is supposed to present a dance recital at the time of his cosmic striding activity (TM 2.5.7, 4-3-4&gt; MOLI 7.5.6).</page><page sequence="4">226 Raju Kalidos Cittirakutam of Tillai (Kalidos 1997). So both the Saiva and Vaisnava Lords of Tillai, housed in the Cirrampalam and Cittirakutam are Natarajas. At this place Vi?nu vigorously trains himself in dance, payilarankam (payil "to train" oneself) (KPT 1.4). The interesting phrase, patukatu, gives two different connotations to the topography of the arena from the Saiva and Vaisnava point of usage. It is a barren tract, a crematorium, for the Saivas but the "pathless woods" of the Vaisnavas. It is a colai where "none intrudes" but peacocks, cuckoos, birds and where harmless animals live in heavenly harmony. It is the Garden of Eden, the Brindavana, which strikingly contrasts with the ecological setting of Siva's wild forest, infested with jackals, owls and poisonous snakes (Kalidos 1996: 27-29, Fischer 1979: figs. 9-10, 15-17). We will return to this point. The manru (NET 16) in Vaisnava tradition is associated with a maram "tree", manramaram (NET 16), a reminder that in the past stages were hypaethral, set under shades of a tree. Mai (Skt. Visnu) presents his recital in a group, kuravai in the manru, manril kuravai pinainta Mai (PTM 11.2.1). There is an erotic undertone in the expression as the word, pinainta "congress" (infra) is a naive pointer of rasakfida. Antal in NAC gives a classical orientation to the Tantric idioms in her efforts to discover Kfsna as an unearthly sweetheart of a mundane aspirant (Kalidos 1997b). Visnu in iconographical illustrations is usually presented in three basic modes; asana (T. irunta), sayana (T. kitanta) and sthanaka (T. ninra) (Kalidos 1993: 196). Nammalvar talks of natantu "walk" (MOLI 6.9.3) as a mode. Tirurnarikai takes into account all four and adds kunintum-natakam, i.e. dance, as a posture of Visnu. To quote, Kitantu miruntu meluntu kitam palapafi Na^antum parantum kunintum natakam ceykinranave (PTM 5.2.4) The Lord is a dramatist who enacts natakam "stage play" by kitantu, iruntu and eluntu "get up" (i.e. standing dynamically, cf. Bautze-Picron 1985: 437?81), natantu, parantu "fly"4 and kunintu "to stoop" (i.e. dance). All these activities take place to the tune of several musical recitals, kitam pala pati (cf. PTM 5.2.4); kitam "music", pala "many" and pati "sing". Music is inborn with the Lord and so he is invoked with the epithet, elicaiyin cuvai (MOLI 10.8.8) "melody of the seven musics".5 Dance being an accepted form of the Lord, the Alvars associate several of the iconic representations of Visnu with n$tya. Most important among them are kutakkuttu, rasakfida, Kaliyamardana and Govardhanadhari. Among the other forms are Se?asayi, Trivikrama, Vamana, Varahamurti, Verikatesvara, and the presiding gods of Ararikam, Tirukkot^iyur and so on. Several forms of Kysna dance. They are Gopala as Lord of cows, Krsna as a child, Gopivastrapaharana, Yamalarjunabhanga, Kuvalayapida vadham, Rasakrida, Kjsna eating butter, Krma killing Kamsa and so on. It is very interesting to find that the Alvars view the most virulent avatara, Npirhha in reclining (PAV 23, Zuelebil 1974: 103-104) and dancing aspects (PTM 3.3.8). This projection adds a new dimension to the personality of Visnu. The Nayanmar in their corpus, the Tevaram (5.182.3, 6.295,8), view Harihara as a dancer (Kalidos 1996: 24-25). 4 The enigmatic phrase, Atarparavaiyan (PTM 9.9.10, MOLI 8.2.4), cited in the foregoing account will have to be recapitulated here. Among those personalities who are connected with Visnu, Garuda is the King-bird who could fly swiftly. He is an amsavatara of Vi$nu (Kalidos 1986: i83n). Hamsa, the swan, is an incarnation of Vi$nu in the kftayuga, also called Yajfia in the nth skanda of the Bhagavata Purana (Mani 1996: 306). 5 The Lord is invoked with the words, innicaiyanavane (PTM 6.1.7) "Thou music incarnate" (cf. Skt. svaramaya or saptasvaramaya). Svarah (Visnusahasranama 25, 123) means "omniscient".</page><page sequence="5">Dance of Visnu: the spectacle of Tamil Alvars 227 Tirumahkai Alvar finds the Lord of Cittirakutam, i.e. the abode of Visnu in the Citamparam temple complex (Kalidos 1997), in Njsirhha form. It is known that the Lord, i.e. mulabera, in the Cittirakutam was Sesasayi through the ages. Tirumahkai adds that the Lord at Cittirakutam emerges in the form of a lion with burning eyes and his 1 000 shoulders dancing to dislodge the demon whose name is gold, i.e. hiranya "golden". To quote, Ponkiyamarilorukal ponpeyaronai veruva Arikavanakamalaintittu ayirantoleluntata Painkaniranterikanra ninta veyirrotupelvay Cirikavuruvil varuvan cittirakutattullane (PTM 3.3.8) In the cited hymn, the following phrases are worth explaining: ponpeyaron "he with the name of gold" (i.e. Hiranya), ayirantoleluntata "1000 shoulders rise up to dance", Cinkavuruvilvaruvan "He (Visnu) comes in form of Lion". This is an important theme because in the literature of India, Tirumahkai is one who visualized Nrsirhha with dancing shoulders. That is to say Npirhha is dancing. The two Namakkal cave temples provide clues to the emerging Njsirhha from the root Visnu. The original Visnu is iconographically either Vaikunthamurti or Sesasayi. The Rariganatha cave of Namakkal finds the mulabera reclining while Nrsirhha is posted in a kostha near the Lord's feet. Similarly in the Nrsirhha cave it is Njsirhha who occupies the cella but Vaikunthamurti appears at a strategic place, naively meaning the avatdras proceed from him. There are rare images of dancing Npirhha (Fig. 3). It has been earlier proved with authentic professional skill that the image of Nrsirhha-Hiranya yuddham in the Dasdvatara (Cave XV) of Ellora (cf. Berkson 1988: 207-29) is in dancing mode.6 Gauri Parimoo demonstrated the postures of both Nrsirhha and Hiranya at the Ellora conference (cf. Parimoo 1988) to the tune of natyasastra. It is an important contribution to find a visual justification for the theoretical notion of Tirumahkai (Parimoo 1988: 318-31, Pis. 45-47). The author fails to cite any literary source, excepting the natyasastras, to substantiate her important discovery. The date of the cave according to K.V. Soundararajan (1981: 9, cf. Spink 1967: 10) is the mid-8th century A.D. which gets closer to the time of later Alvars who popularised the dancing theme (see Annexure I). There is an image of Ugra-Npirhha in dancing mode (fig. 3) in the Paithan village, near Aurahgabad, maybe of the Yadava period (Kalidos 1977b: PI XXIXa). An image of Nrsirhha in the Vrddhachalam temple of the Vijayanagara period is also interesting (Kalidos 1977b: PL XXIXb, cf. Meister, 1986: 237). Varaha, the Wild Boar, is a dancer. There are two important places in the Ndldyiram where the Enam "Boar" is supposed to dance. Periyalvar in his TM (2.10.10) notes the Enam who rescued the Earth, tarani itantdn. It is added that the Boar was hued like rain drenched clouds, preyed in wild forest, played at dancing and at last rescued the Mother Earth. To quote, Vanattelunta malaimukilpol ehkuh Kanattumeyntu kalittu vilaiyati Enatturuvay itantavimmanninai... 6 An image of Nrsiriiha engaged in Hiranya vadham in the Hoyalesvara temple at Halebidu is also possibly in dancing mode (cf. Settar 1991: PL 98).</page><page sequence="6">228 Raju Kalidos The phrase, kalittu vilaiyati (cf. Rasa 1986: fig. 165), would mean play the dance with alacrity. The hymn suggests the venue is kanakam "forest", a metaphor for the cosmos, and so He is the Cosmic Boar. The Lord incarnated himself as Enam to save the Earth, again a metaphor for the evils haunting the earth. The other reference to Varaha as Dancer is in the PTML 11. 209-11 (cf. Goswamy &amp; Fischer 1990: Pis. 73, 105). To quote, Manniwakali^attai mamutunir tanvilunka Pinnumorenamayp pukkuvalaimaruppin Konnavillum kurnutimel vaittetutta kuttanai The Boar here is invoked with the epithet, Kuttan "Dancer". It is added that the Earth was engulfed by the waters of the primeval ocean. Thereupon the Lord incarnated himself in Boar form and lifted the Earth by the tip of his snout. He performed this miracle by presenting a dance recital. Apdy the performer is Kuttan. Varahamurti in Indian art through the ages is depicted in a particular pose. He has one of his legs, usually the left, pushed forward as though in atidha attitude (Ions 1975: fig. p. 37). Desai 1973: figs. 59-63). The posture is full of dynamism and may be what the Alvars call natantu "walk" (PTM 5.2.4 supra) or in a dramatic setting of the enactment in dancing mode. In Hoysala sculptures the Lord Boar finds the demon, Hiranyaksa, trampled at his gyrating legs. There is an interesting headless Varaha in the Matahura museum (Desai 1973: fig- 58, Joshi 1965: 113-19) in which the legs are set apart as though in ardhamandali posture with the purvahastas in katihasta mode. This is like a dancing mode which is different from other models of the subject. The hymn cited above (TM 2.10.10) notes the Wild Boar roaming about the forest, leaping joyfully and playing mirthfully his movements would be akin to an orgiastic dance (fig. 8). So the association of dance with the Boar is not a misnomer. Few of the images of Vahahi, reported by Donaldson (1995: fig. 20, see also Punja 1991: 285 fig.) are interesting in this context (cf. Npirhhi above). The great Alvar, Tirumarikai, in a hymn cited above (PTM 5.2.4) talks of parantu "flying". In Hindu mythology there are a few birds which fly in the service of the gods. They are hamsa "swan" (cf. Hamsaya namah VA 28), vehicle of Brahma (cf. images of Lingodbhavamurti in Ellora Caves XV and ~XMl),Jatayu in the Ramayana (Ions 1975: 37 fig.) and Garuda, the mount of Vi?nu (Ions 1975: 37 fig.), Kamadhenu, the celestial all offering Cow, is also fitted with wings (Kalidos 1988: 99) and supposed to fly. Even now in country festivals cows are decorated and led by acrobats who make the beasts dance with the stimulating shout, atu "dance".7 The beasts leap and gyrate the body, tossing heads and swinging tails. This is the dance of the cow. In medieval art there are a few interesting sculptural illustrations wherein Garuda is flying and at the same time in dancing mode. There are a few specimens in the Hoysala art of Belur and Halebidu. These images illustrate (1) Garuda lifting a boa-constrictor, his prey, (2) Karivarada, and (3) Visnu-Krma with Satyabhama, seated on the king-bird, in a mission to kill Narakasura.8 It is interesting to find in all these cases Garuda in levitation and at the same time in atidha attitude (fig. 5). 7 Sometimes men and women also wear masks of cows, get into an artificial animal frame and dance. 8 An image from the chariot of the Sarngapanisvami temple at Kumbhakonam has been reported (Kalidos 1989: fig. 46) wherein Garuda is an altdhasana but not dancing. It seems as though he has landed and helps the armed Satyabhama to kill the demon.</page><page sequence="7">Dance of Visnu: the spectacle of Tamil Alvars 229 The flexion is atibhanga. He is anthropomorphic but fitted with wings and aculeate nose. As he flies, the king-bird is dancing. These images also stand as proof of the fact that dlidha is a posture, having something to do with dance as it has been pointed out in connection with Varaha (supra). Incidentally, it may be noted that S. Settar's (1991, Vol. II) profile of Hoysala sculptures does not include these interesting pieces. Nammalvar uses the interesting epithet, Atarparavaiyan (MOLI 8.2.4), followed by Tirumahkai (PTM 9.9.10), meaning the Dancing Bird. Nammalvar talks with reference to Tenkulantai, one among the 108 divyaksetras, where the Mayakkuttan is the Dancing Bird. In case of the latter, the hymn is addressed to the Lord of TirumaHruhcolai (Rajarajan 1995: chap. I). Now the question is: who is this Dancing Bird? could it be Garuda who according to the Sri Mahadevi Bhatgavatam is one among the amsavataras of Visnu (Kalidos 1986: 186). But in case of the two citations, the hymns are directly addressed to the presiding Lords of Tenkulantai and TirumaHruhcolai. There is no mention of an amsavatdra. So, our presumption is that both must pertain to a major avatara of Visnu. Before entering into a discussion on the subject, the hymns concerned may be cited: Mafakkoti matil Tenkulantaivankutapal ninra Mayakkuttan Afcarparavai yuyurtta velpor alivalavanai... (MOLI 8.2.4) Tetarkariyavanait Tirumaliruncolai ninra Atarparavaiyanai... (PTM 9.9.10) The MOLI avers that the Mayakkuttan stands at the fortified city of Tenkulantai in its northern side and that he is the Dancing Bird, engaged in a tough battle.9 According to the PTM it is very difficult to discover the Lord who stands at Tirumaliruncolai as the Dancing Bird. Apart from the birds (supra), famous in Hindu mythology, there is a form of Nrsirhha, called Astamukhaghandhabherunda-Nrsirhha (AGN) (Kalidos 1987: 289-91, 1997b: PL I, Rajarajan 1993: 177-80, figs. 1-2, Gopalakrishnan 1997: 73-88) who combines the features of man, animal (sirhha) and bird (gandhabherundah). The iconographical features of the eight-headed bird, a corollary to Sarabhamurti, is elaborated in the Srittatvanidhi (1.2.60, reported by Rajarajan 1993). Very rare specimens of the later Vijayanagara period are reported (Kalidos 1987, Rajarajan 1993, Gopalakrishnan 1997) which are mostly seated. And yet, the painting in the Srirahgam temple is of particular interest (Rarajarajan 1993: fig. 1, Kalidos 1997b: PL I) which even if seated is full of dynamism (fig. 12) ready for a dancing concert. Again if Npirhha could present an ecstatic dance recital, why not the macrocosmic AGN? What is more interesting, the Alakarkoyil temple for Saundararaja accommodates a rare image on the subject. The garbhagfha of the temple is circular and surrounded by a square mandapa fitted with a parapet for circumnambulation.10 The walls of the mandapa are decorated with stucco images on top. These are of great interest and unreported yet in any scholarly study, excepting Rajarajan (1995). There is a running panel of Sarabha-AGN 9 The location of the image on the north is an important idea because Siva-Nataraja in his abodes at Citamparam, Maturai and Nelveli is facing south. Visnu may also face the south, falling in line with the ampalakkuttan -Nataraja. 10 For a detailed account see R. K. K. Rajarajan 1995.</page><page sequence="8">230 Raju Kalidos conflict wherein the latter is full of dynamism and in a mode akin to dance. I am of the view that the ideas aired by the Alvars, Nam and Tirumarikai, are possibly clues to the dancing AGN who was Lord of Tenkulantai and Timmaliruncolai, the Great Dancer in a world of illusion, the Mayakkuttan. In the history of Indian iconography, Sarabhamurti and AGN are two outstanding examples of sectarian rivalry (cf. Gopalakrishnan (1997). Sarabhamurti was an antithesis of Njsirhha (Kalidos 1981) and AGN of Sarabhamurti. That means AGN could have come into the picture only after the emergence of Sarabhamurti during the later Cola period (Sivaramamurti 1976: 98). If this is so, how could AGN find a place in the pre-Cola literature of the Alvars? There seems to be an anachronism here. Yet there is a case in favour of our proposition because the Nayanmar talk with reference to a number of sectarian forms like Kankalar (Skt. Karikalamurti) in the Tevaram (1.71.1, 1.130.3), the Saiva corpus of the contemporary period, who visualize Siva as a destroyer of a few of the avataras of Visnu like Kurma and Varaha}1 According to the Nayanmar, Siva plucked the tusk of Enam and wore it as a garland (Tevaram 1.73.10) and the Amai was also part of the decoration (Tevaram 1.1.2). Amai is Kurma and Enam Varaha. So, it is quite natural that the Alvars discovered the Afcarparavai who could deal with the challengers of Amai and Enam. There are rare iconographical illustrations of Siva who dispensed with Kurma and Varaha (Rajarajan 1995a: 129-34, fig. 90, Kalidos 1989: fig. 80). Vamana was a dancer according to Nammalvar. A decad (MOLI 8.5) commences with the words, Mayakkutta Vamana "Vamana, thou the illusionary dancer". Then the mystic goes to add, "what a pleasure, it is to witness the kuttus, thou performed as Vamana" (Vamananay ceytakuttukal kantume MOLI 7.5.6). In the cited passage, the word for dance is in the plural, kuttu-kal. It may also be noted that the kuttu in the present context may either be a dance or a comic play, involving humour. Perhaps the tricks played by Vamana to elongate himself into Trivikarama, the Tall One, are poetically pointed out by this expression.12 Vamana was a Dwarf and a dwarf presenting a dancing recital may appear frivolous. But in Indian artistic tradition, there is no hiatus in the dance of a dwarf. We have several examples of dwarf ganas, posed in dancing modes in the cave temples of the Calukyas, Rastrakutas and the later medieval structural temples (Kreisel 1986: PL A27). Vamana is also supposed to play a childish dance, called cappani (TM 1.6.1). He is decorated with ornaments made of rubies, molten gold, corals and pearls. He played the cappani with litde hands for which the reward was the earth (T. kani). Periyalvar has dedicated a decad to the play of cappani (TM 1.6); supposed to be enacted by Kjsna (w. 1-5), Parthasarathi (v. 6), Trivikrama (v. 7), Dasarathi-Rama (v. 8), Njpirhha (v. 9) and Mohini (v. 10). These evoke humour and the spirit of a classical dance as in case of tandava is lost. Periyalvar while extolling the tilas of K^sna concludes a few of the hymns with the words, elulakamutaiya yatukavatukave (TM 1.5.10). The dance under discussion is cenkirai, another type of children's play. The phrase, elulakamutaiyay "Lord of seven worlds", is significant and it 1 * Iconographically Kankalamurti and Bhiksatana are similar forms. The former is differentiated from the latter by the kankaladanda that he carries, placed on his shoulders. The danda is supposed to be fitted with the bones of Vi?nu's avataras (Kalidos 1989: 83?84). Early images are found in the Pallava temples in Kancipuram, the Kailasanatha housing a piece in one of the secondary chapels as a cult image in its south western corner. 12 In fact Vamana played a deceitful trick to overcome Mahabali and so the Alvars call him a vancan (MOLI 3.8.2), a deceiver.</page><page sequence="9">Dance of Visnu: the spectacle of Tamil Alvars 231 may refer to Trivikrama who measured the worlds as a sequel to the Vamanavatara event. It has been pointed out earlier by the author that the postures of Trivikrama in three modes (i.e., leg lifted up to the knee or hip or shoulder levels, cf. Rao 1971: 164) may have something to do with dance, especially the urdhvapada which is the equal of urdhvatandava or lalatatilakam performance of Siva (Kalidos 1984: 20 (figs. 8-9). Thus, Vamana and Trivikrama are dancers in the file of Alvars. The ideal hero for the dancing subject is K?$na (Archer 1957: 74, Dallapiccola 1982: 13, fig. 3). And Kjsna is the ideal theme of artists from the early "Kysna Pillars" (Stadtner 1987) to the later Karigra (Randhawa i960, 1982, Bautze 1983) and Himalayan (Seth 1976) paintings. Most of the lilas of Kysna are linked with dance motifs. The themes are Kaliyamardana, Rasakfida (Archer 1957: PL 22), Govardhanadhari, Gopala, Gopivastrapa harana, jalakrida in Yamuna, Yamalarjunabhahga, KuvalayapIda-iW/wm, Santana Gopala, Kamsa-vadham and so on. Talking in general terms, i.e. without hinting at any specific lila, it can be added that K^sna is the performer of marakkaUkuttu which he staged at a manru. It was enjoyed by those who were present. To quote, ... kanfcavar tarn kankalippa Manril marakkal kuttatinan kanom Manril marakkal kuttatinanakilum enrumariyen (PTM 11.8.6) (fig. 7) The Lord was happy at his own performance in the manru, located below a tree, manrilmarakkuttati makilntay (NET 16). The child-K?$na who steals butter is a much extolled Uterary motif. The child is either fed by Yasoda or steals butter from houses of gopis. What is fun for boys is suffering for the gopis. So, agopi laments as follows: Kalaiyeluntu kataintavimmor virkap pokinren kanteponen Malainarurikurici nantanmakanallal man^vantarumillai Melaiyakattu narikay kanminkal venneyeyanrirunta Palumpatinkutarikantillen paviyenen ceykenenceykeno (PTM 10.7.2) "I got up early in the morning and went to sell churned buttermilk. In the evening I found ten pots of butter and milk missing (in my house). None but the son of Nanda came here. You maiden of the upper house, tell me what shall this cursed gopi do?"13 And the poet goes further to add, Vellimalaiyiruntalotta venneyai varivilurikiyittu Kalvanurarikukinran vantukanminkal kaiyellamney (PTM 10.7.3) "He has gulped all the butter which was heaped like a silver hillock. See how the thief sleeps, the hands smeared with clarified butter". Having consumed his share of food, the mischievous one presented a kuttu (VIR 21). The butter-eater is called Kuttavappan, the Father of Dance (MOLI 6.2.11), another important epithet, the equal of Nataraja. Krma is a tender of domestic animals like cows and so the Good Cowherd. He is called 13 For a detailed account of the mythology of Kjsna, reflected in the hymns of the Alvars see Kalidos 1986a: 50-57</page><page sequence="10">232 Raju Kalidos Ayarkal-pereru "Big Bull of Cowherds" who is the Lord of seven worlds and presents a dance recital, lifting one leg.

He is invited to take a bath and then dine, giving a dance recital, atiyamutu cey (TM 3.3.5). Maliruhcolai (med. Alakarkoyil) it seems, was inhabited by the kovalar or ayar and kuravar (the gypsies of hill).14 They tune the music of hill country, called kurihci, sing songs (pa "song") and learn the dance to propitiate the Lord. To quote, Kovalar Kovintanaik kuramatarkal pankurihci Pavoli pati natam payil Maliruncolaiyite (TM 4.3.4) (cf. Khandalavala 1958: fig. 2, Archer i960: PL 64) The dance of devotees was a common sight. So, Alvar Nam adds "we dance and create a scene", natikal kuttati ninrarppa (MOLI 9.1.4). At Tirumokur, a divyaksetra near Anaimalai in Maturai, the devotees go around the temple in pradaksina and present a dance. To quote, Tirumokur ... koyilai valanceytu ikkatutum kutte (MOLI 10.1.5) The Lord is Catirmurtti15 (MOLI 8.10.9) wn? eradicates evils which haunt the devas. And so Krma is associated with a number of demons whom he dislodged with the help of Balarama, his elder brother. The two sons of Kubera, Nalakubara and Manigriva were cursed to be trees which stood at the backyard of Kysna's residence in Gokula. The Lord rolled a mortar against the trees which fell down. They emerged from the trees and were redeemed. The name of the tree topped by the Lord is kuruntam. The mystic adds, "let us join the feller, present a dance and celebrate the event". To quote Periyalvar, Kuruntamonrocittanotuh cenru kutiyati vilacceytu (TM 4.4.7) Vilacceytu means hold a festival. The celebrated event is associated with Tirukkottiyur (Skt. Tirukostiyur), a divyaksetra in the Pandya country. The host of demons who tested the time of Krsna were sent by his own maternal uncle, Kamsa (T. Kahcan, literally "miser"), King of Mathura who had deposed his own father and usurped the throne. Having done away with the host of demons, Krsna with Balarama proceeded to Mathura to encounter the arch-demon itself at his base. And when they entered the place wild elephants were commissioned to kill the boys. The mammoths, called Kuvalayapida, were very powerful. Kysria and Balarama plucked the tusks of the 14 The ayar are a caste in Tamilnadu, popularly called konar.

According to Kulacekarar, the event took place at a divyaksetra called Tirunarikur in the Cola country. To quote, Kumpamiku matayanai pakanoturi kulaintu vila Kompatanaip paritterinta Kuttanamarnturaiyumitam ...Narikai (KPT 4.1.9) "The virulent mad elephant along with its driver crumbled when its tusks were plucked out by the Dancer who is seated and resides at Narikai". The Lord is a Kuttan. Perhaps the ecstasy of killing the beast resulted in a natural dance (cf. the Nayanmar who add that Siva performed the dance at a time when his wrath would not subside even after killing the demon, Tarakan ? Tevaram 4.14.4, Kalidos 1996: 21, 25). The elephants at the mercy of Kysna were terrified and started roaring. The dancer is nicknamed Kuraikalar Kuttan, who wears anklets (PTM 10.1.9). Kpna who killed Kamsa is none other than Kurru, the God of Death, i.e. Kala according to Nammalvar (MOLI 7.6.10).16 (Seth 1976: PL XXXII). Of all the dances of Krma, the most celebrated one is connected with Kaliyamardana (Seth 1976: fig. 35). Kaliya was a dreadful snake who lived in the Yamuna, preying on the innocent inhabitants of Gokula. Yamuna was the river with which the life of the people of Gokula (T. Kokulam) was very much interwoven. It was the source of drinking water, the bathing ghat and the pond where the gopis could play the rasakfida with Kjsna. The play is called vilaiyattu, sportive enactments, involving dance (TM 2.9.8). When the gopis play in the waters of Yamuna, Krma threw mud on them and stole their garments. To quote, Arriliruntu vilaiyatuvorikalai zru ' 'river" Cerralerintu valaitukir kaikkonni ceru "mud", tukil "apparel" The sport of Krsna in the Yamuna was a divine play and so the astadikpalakas are present on the occasion to witness the event, enticaiyorum irancit tolutetta (TM 2.10.2) (Sotheby's 1997: fig. 204). We shall return to this theme. Kaliyamardana (Kaliya, the snake-demon, + mardana "crushing" or "destroying") is a pan-Indian theme which associates Kysna with dance. In iconographical illustrations, Kjsna stands on the hoods of Kaliya in dancing mode, most famous being the Cola bronzes. The hymns of Alvars provide ample data to examine the theme from the iconological point of view. The name of the demon is Kaliyan (TM 1.5.6, 3.9.7, NAC 4.4, 12.5, KPT 7.9, PTM 4.10.3, 5.1.10, 6.7.5). He is a nakam (naga) "snake" (PTM 4.6.1) or aravam (CAN 86) or pampu (CAN 38) or punakam (PTM 8.10.8), a deadly snake. The hiding place of Kaliya is also noted as a poykai "pond" (CAN 38). It was full of poison, vitamkalanta "mixed with poison" (CAN 38). The snake was also a deadly poisonous reptile (PTM 4.10.3). Kpna pounced upon the hoods of Kaliya and danced (NAC 12.5) (Khandalavala 1958: fig. 141). The Dancer is Kuttan (NAC 4.4, PTM 3.3.1). The dancer performs nattam or niruttam (NAC 12.5), natam (CAN 38, 86, PTM 4.2.2), natakam (PTM 4.10.3) and tuyanatam "pure dance" (TM 1.5.6). (Fig. 6) Periyalvar adds, 16 Viewing Ky?na as Kurru is interesting. He was in fact Kala "Time" who decided the fate of Kamsa, and the "God of Death", dealing severely with the train of demons sent by the King of Mathura. Kaliyamardana is called Kalanemi-kalan (CAN 38). Kalanemi was a powerful demon who was reborn as Kamsa (Mani 1996: 382). Kr^na was a Kala to Kalanemi alias Kamsa.</page><page sequence="12">234 Raju Kalidos Kanaka mamatuvir kaliyanucciyile Tuyana^am payilum cuntaraven ciruva Tuyanatam payilum cuntaraven ciruva (TM 1.5.6) "Thou, beautiful small boy; thou, beautiful small boy. You enact the immaculate dance on the top of Kaliya, lodged in a forest-pond." It is said that Kjsna climbed a tree, called katampu (NAC 4.4, PT PTM 4.2.2), and jumped upon Kaliya's head (Randhawa i960: PL IX). He trampled the head of Kaliya (KPT 7.9) and performed a number of dances, palnatam (PTM 4.10.3), having landed on the reptile's hood. Kaliya was terrified, natuhka (PTM 5.1.10) "shivering", by the Lord's performance. It is humorously added that the Vittakan "Root" (of Dance ?) pounced on Kaliya's head from the top of a katampu tree, played the kulal "flute" and presented a mock recital. To quote, Kayanirpukkuk ka^amperi kaliyan Tiyapanattil cilamparkkap payntafr Veyin kulaluti vittakanay ninra Ayanvantap puccikattukinran (TM 2.1.3) (fig- ll) The phrase puaikdttutal is a satire.17 That is to say one may threaten to do (i.e. to kill Kaliya) but may not actually do it (Kaliya was not killed but asked to vacate). It is also added that Kpna encountered Kaliya in a tdmaraippoykai "lotus pond", pulled the reptile by its tail, jumped upon its hoods and stood on top (TM 2.10.3). When a torrential rain battered Gokula, Kysna lifted the Govardhana hill like an umbrella to offer protection to its inhabitants. The Alvars repeat the idea that the Lord lifted the kunru "hill" (TM 3.4.4, KPT 7.9) or perumalai18 "big mountain" (MOLI 2.10.4) like a kutai "umbrella" (TM 5.1.8, PTM 3.1.8) (Archer 1957: PL 38). It was Krma's tour de force and so the Lord himself is called a hill, ahcanakkunram ninra toppdnai (PTM 4.3.7). The Govardhana is not a mere umbrella which protects one from rain but the sovereign white umbrella, symbolic of Kjsna's reign. A decad (PT 3.5) is on the regal umbrella of Kysna, Kovartana mennum korrakku\ai (cf. Vaudeville 1980: 5). While lifting the hill, he plays the kulal "flute" and feeds the cows, kanrukal meyttan (TM 3.4.4). Here the cows are symbolic of people of the world, the pasu of Saiva Siddhanta, who seek refuge under the umbrella of Kjsna. Krma lifted the hill sportively with the five fingers, posed like a blossoming flower, viralaintum malaravaittu (TM 3.5.7) (Seth 1976 PL XXV, Dallapiccola 1982: 51, fig. 48) (fig 7). Kpna was a mastercraftsman because while lifting the hill, he presents the pot dance. To quote, Kunratanal malaikattuk kufamatu kuttan (PTM 3.10.8) It is also added that after having performed the miracle of lifting the hill, Krsna joined with his fellow mates in the common place at Gokula and presented a group dance to celebrate the occasion. To quote, 17 This phrase is in usage today. Children are threatened by elderly people with changing the face into an ugly one or wearing a mask. If a mature person is threatened by somebody he may simply say, enna pucci ka(turiya, meaning he is not an immature one to be carried away by the threat. 18 Malai in Tamil is mountain and malai rain.</page><page sequence="13">Dance of Visnu: the spectacle of Tamil Alvars 235 Kunrametuttu malaitatuttu ilaiyarotum Manrir kuravai pinainta Mai ennai mai ceytan (PTM 11.1.1) There is an erotic element in the theme (Khandalavala 1958: fig. 2). Mai stands for Visnu and mai also means foul play or a sexual game. Perhaps, it denotes the rasakfida of Kr^na with gopis. The Lord takes the epithet, Kiitta "Thou Dancer" (MOLI 7.6.2-3). The erotic element in the cited passage would lead us to other important themes of the Kjsna mythology, dealing with gopivastrapaharana and rasakfida (Hardy 1983: 83-85). Thematically both are different but have a common subject dealing with the damsels of Gokula, the gopis. When the gopis take a bath in the Yamuna, Krma steals their clothes, vastrapaharana (IM, IV: PL IV). When they mingle with him freely, the result is a group dance (cf. kravai pinaital supra) under the spell of eroticism. Rasakfida is a coveted theme of the Alvars. What the Lord performed was kiritai (TM 2.9.11), enacted once upon a time, pantu, thus adding an antique value to the motif. The theme is beautifully summarised by Periyalvar in a nutshell as follows: pallayar kulanatuve Kolaccentamaraik kan milirak kulaluti yicaipatik kunintu ayarotu ati Alittu varukinra vayappillai (TM 3.4.7) "The lad in the company of the ayar girls is brilliant with his red-lotus like eyes, plays the flute, tunes a melodious music and dances with his mates sportively". Music is the food of love and Krma gave it excessively through his magic band, the kulal (Skt. venu). So, a patikam (TM 3.6) is on the kulal (cf. Kinsley 1979: 199). It is so interesting that the gist of the decad may be presented here: 1. When Krma plays the kulal, the flower-like eyes of gopis are drenched with love-sick tears and that their honey-spilling braids (decked with flowers) are unmatted automati cally (under the spell of a mad love), v. 1 2. The play of the flute was so enrapturing that the divine nymphs like Menaka, Tilottama, Rarhbha and UrvasI fell swooning as they were dancing and singing, v. 4 3. Tumburu and Narada forgot to play their favourite instrument, the vina, and the kinnaras abandoned their instrument, the kinnara, at the time when Krma played his flute, v. 5 4. The melody was so blissful that the inhabitants of devaloka came down to Aypati (i.e. Gokula) to listen to the music of the pied-piper, v. 7 5. Birds evacuated nests and went flying around the patukatu "thick forest" where Krma was playing the flute, v. 8 6. The gazelles ignored pastures and with grass in mouth, the udder pouring milk, they were frozen like a painted figure.

The anirai (TM 3.9.9) or konirai (TM 4.10.9) "flocks of cows" were enticed to begin with and the others to follow suit were the inhabitants, particularly the gopis who were the sweethearts of Kysna. The flute was a powerful weapon (Kalidos 1997b: 120-21, cf. Rawson 1991: 17, Roebuck 1991: 149-53) like a dart in the hands of the pied-piper of Gokula. The field of action for Kf?na was the Brindavana, the Garden of Eden, the land of elixir and immortality (supra). It strikingly contrasts with Siva's cutukatu "burning yard (with corpses)" where eagles, jackals, owls and ghouls roam in search of corpses. The Aypati and forest around present a completely different picture. Antal, the she-mystic, who is in love with Krma, says how romantic the setting of Gokula was. To quote, Uhkalpulakkatai tottattu vaviyul Cehkalunir vaynekilntu ampalvay kumpinakan (PAV 14) "In the garden of your (gopis) backyard, the red-lily has opened its mouth (i.e. blossomed) and the water lily has closed its mouth (i.e. blossom returning to its status of bud)". Antal goes to add, Vantehkum koli alaittanakan matavip Pantalmel palkal kuyilinahkal kuvinakan (PAV 18) "The rooster is inviting and on the mdtavi (a flowering plant) creeper, several types of cuckoo-like birds are making noise". The forest of Kr,?na is a colai "grove" where bees fly humming (curumpamarcolai TMM 17, vantalampumcolai TMM 32). It is full of flowering plants and ponds, pumpolilcul (PTM 1.9.7). ^ is frigid (kulircolai PTM 1.9.8) with a lotus pond (kamalaccunai PTM 1.9.9) (Archer i960: Pis. 89?90). Tirumahkai himself brings about a contrast between Siva's forest of corpses (pinahkalatu katatunul natamatu pinnan "He who dances in the forest of corpses" PTM 2.6.9) anQt Visnu's forest, the heavenly abode of lush green and lovable creatures. According to the Alvars, the garden of Kjsna is filled with the following plants: kuvalai (PTM 7.5.10), aravintam (PTM 3.4.5), ampal (PTM 3.4.5), kamuku, pdlai, cenpakam (PTM 5.10.4), paid, cutakam, valai (PTM 4.2.1), punnai (PTM 5.1.5), ilanir (PTM 5.2.2), mdtavi (PTM 7.5.3), alii (PTM 7.5.10), karumpu (MOLI 6.5.6), cennel (MOLI 6.5.6) and so on.19 The kuvalai shows its eyes, kumutam its mouth and water lily its lotus-like face. To quote, Kuvalai kankatta niril kumutam vaykatta Allik kamala mukahkattum (PTM 7.5.10) (cf. Jayakar n.d.: 72 fig., Pal 1986: fig. 2) The Alvars view the divyaksetras as the colai of Kr,sna. Maliruhcolai, for example, is a colai where bees fly humming, peacocks move around and cuckoo sings when the Cosmic Lord is standing. To quote, 19 These grow in places where water is available in plenty. The cutukatu of Siva is a barren tract, devoid of any source of water. A number of other sweet-smelling flowers are associated with Visnu. These are mallikai "jasmine", patiri, ukantivai, cehkalunir, kurukkatti, iruvatci and kamukai. A decad in TM (2.7) is an invitation to Kj?na to come and decorate himself with these flowers.</page><page sequence="15">Dance of Visnu: the spectacle of Tamil Alvars 237 Vantinamuralum colai mayilinamalum colai Kontaltenavum colai kuyilinamkuvum colai Antarkonamarum colai... (TMM 14) The mulabera in the Maliruncolai temple is standing and the references to the Lord seated in colai may be a pointer to the utsavabera during udyanagamana (visit to garden - Kalidos 1989: 222) or Vasantotsava, festival of the spring. The birds and animals which inhabit the garden of Krma are mayil "peacock" (PTM 3.5.2) or mannai (PTM 6.5.4), annam "swan" (PTM 3.5.2), vantu "bee" (PTM 4.2.3), cenkal-narai "red-legged crane" (PTM 5.1.5), kuyil "cuckoo" (PTM 6.5.2), kili "parrot" (MOLI 10.8.4) anc* so on. The mayil dances, annams hover around in batches and dance, narai visits willingly, kuyil and vantu sing and kills skip about (Archer i960: PL 43). The Alvars, unlike Tirumular (Kalidos 1997a), very rarely talk of the symbols. Tirumahkai adds that the annam is the Scriptures, annamakiya arumaraikal (PTM 5.1.9). The music that is generated is kurinci (PTM 5.2.2), typical of the Tamil hill country where the ethos of the inhabitants is love-making and engaging in the excesses of conjugal intimacy (Kalidos 1976: 58). Krma's garden is a playground where he stages the kridas. He has 16,000 sweethearts (Dallapiccola 1982: 59, fig. 60), patinaramayiravar tevimar (NAC 7.9). They were all engaged in jalakrida in the waters of Ganga, kankainir kutaintatum perumal (KTP 2.2). It is all the rhythm of dance which pervades through the colai, enkum atalocai (PTM 3.5.5). As they played (vilaiyattu PTM 3.8.8) there was a spontaneous overflow of the flood of love (katal vellam PTM 3.8.8) (cf. Siegel 1978: 187). There was a pleasant blow of the southern breeze, tenral vantulavum (PTM 4.5.7). In a romantic setting of the colai, the lovers joined in a group and performed the kuttu kuravai kottu (PTM 7.8.8), kuttu and the kuravai mixed. They leap in bounds while playing, tulli vilaiyati (PTM 10.5.7). And what is Kysna at with the gopis? Tirumarikai is puzzled, may be under the spell of a celibate monk,20 and asks: ayarkalotu en vilaiyatukinray? "what is it that you play with the ayars? (PTM 19.4.2) (fig. 9, 11). Krma catches hold of the damsel's garment and gets rid of it, tukilparri kiri (PTM 10.7.5). He pulls the gopis (Khandalavala 1958: fig. 219), holding their locks of hair.21 He dances and dances the kuravai, leading to a congress, pinai (PTM 10.8.9), sexual intercourse?22 The union is a heavenly harmony, comparable to the mingling of honey with milk which tastes like the ambrosia, amutu, heavenly food of the gods, tenum pedum kannalum amutumakit tittittu (MOLI 8.8.4). Kannal and amutu are not edible commodities but the Lord himself is as Nammalvar would see him, kannale yamute (MOLI 7.1.2). Antal would confirm the same idea by the words, amparame tannire core yam marunte "Thou the Sky, thou the water, thou the food, thou the ambrosia" (PAV17). He is the Lord, Kuttan Kovalan, "the Dancer, the Cowherd" (MOLI 10.1.6). 20 Actually he was not. He was married and could have renounced worldly life when he became a fully fledged mystic. 21 It is in AntaJ's NAC that the erotic theme acquired a naked expression (Kalidos 1997b). She enquires of the sahkha how sweet the Lord's lips are? invites the Lord to squeeze her breasts, brimming with emotions for a physical manipulation, and feels the penetration in sexual intercourse. Antal in NAC (4.11) uses the words; ku\al "union", punartal "copulation" and unartal "feeling the presence" (of the penetrating phallus of Vi?nu). Cf. Kalidos 1997b: 117-38. 22 He teases the gopis by destroying the play-houses they make during playtime (PTM 3.8.10) and carries away the balls that they play with (PTM 10.7.5); cirril citaittu "destroy playhouses", pantu parittu "snatch the balls".</page><page sequence="16">238 Raju Kalidos The Lord's sweethearts may number several thousands but he is mad after Pinnai or Nappinnai, the prototype of Sanskritic Radha. The Lord is Pinnai's husband, manalan (TM 2.5.1) or kelvan (PTM 6.6.8) or manavalan (PTM 6.6.9), an idea redundant in the hymns. Antal says Nappinnaai is the daughter-in-law of Nantakopalan (PAV 13); Nantakopalan marumakale Nappinnay. Malarmakal "Lady on Flower" (Sridevi), Manmatantai "Lady of the Earth" (Bhudevi) and Kulavayarkoluntu "Sprout of the family of Cowherds" are the foremost of the Lord's spouses (cf. Kaidos 1997b: 117-38). He is their kelvan "husband" (PTM 5.6.11). Pinnai was a beautiful maid. Her breasts were full and well shaped, vararum mulai (PTM 4.4.4), tresses attractive (PTM 6.5.4) and look like those of a gazelle (PTM 9.10.4). While asleep, the pan-Indian tradition would find Sridevi near the Lord's head and Bhudevi near the feet (cf. Parimoo 1983: 15, 25, Smith 1969: 1867-87). Antal adds that the Lord has his mouth placed on the paps of Nappinnai when he reclines, Napinnai kohkaimel vaittuk kitanta malarmarpa vaytiravay (PAV 19). This is to point out that Nappinnai was the mate in his kamalilas. She, it seems, sleeps with the Lord and so Antal invokes the dormant maid to get up (PAV 20). Nappinnai is placed on a par with the Lord's koyilkappan "temple keeper", vacalkappan "door keeper" (PAV 16), Nantakopalan (PAV 17) and the Lord himself (PAV 19-21) in her hymns, dedicated to the sleeping ones and their arousal (Kalidos 1990). Pinnai (Manimekalai XIX: 65, Cilappatikaram XVIII) or Nappinnai (Inna Narppatu 22) appears earlier in pre-Pallava Tamil literature also. A typical Tamil idiom, she is identified with Sridevi (Subrahmaniyan 1990: 570). Another typical Tamil idiom is the kutakkuttu that Visnu performs. Kutam means pot. A theme, appearing in pre-Alvar literature, it is associated with the dance of Visnu in the Manimekalai (VI: 7, XXIX: 390, 457). It is supposed to be one among the six vinotakkuttus, hilarious dances, and presented by Vasudeva on the streets of Co and fortress of Vanan,23 a great enemy of the gods. The late medieval commentators like Arumpatavuraiyaciriyar and Atiyarkkunallar add that the dance was presented by Vasudeva with pots, made of mud or metals or pancalokas (Subrahmaniyan 1990: 283). The Alvars make use of the idiom to the maximum possible level and the theme is prolific in the Nalayiram. The performer of the pot dance is a Ko (NAC 3.6) and so the King of Dancers (supra). The fact that kutam means pot is pointed out in a hymn (cf. Christie's 1974: 84 fig., Randhawa 1959: 26 fig.). In another context it is added that the dance is mixed with kutam, kutahkalanta kuttanay "the Dancer who added kutam" (CAN 38). The word, kalantu "mix" or "add", confuses as it may stand for a particular type of dance like kuravai or elli. But kuravai is also linked with kutam, kuravai munne kottanai kutamatu kuttarttannai (PTM 2.5.4). Kaliyamardana, Govardha nadhari, Santana Gopala or Gopala, Kjsna who toppled the mallas "wrestlers", Trivikrama and Vaikunthamurti are supposed to dance the pot. To quote: Vitahkalanta pampinmel natampayinra natane 23 Co is Sonitapura and Vanan, Bana, an asura. He fought with Kysna on account of his daughter, Usa who fell in love with Aniruddha, grandson of Krsna and son of Pradyumna (Mani 1996: 43, 107). The slaughter of Banasura by the dancing Lord is extolled as follows: ... lean tan pataiyotunkijaiyotu Mota Vananai yayirantolkajun tunittavan uraikoyil Atuvan ... (PTM 4.2.5) The sthala is Nankiir where the Lord cut the thousand shoulders of Banasura and shattered his army, supported by the flanks of Siva. Bana was an ardent devotee of Siva and so both were alllies.</page><page sequence="17">Dance of Visnu: the spectacle of Tamil Alvars 239 Kutarikalanta kuttan - Kaliyamardana (CAN 38) "the Dancer who added kutam (in his recital) is the one who cultivated the dance, standing on the (head of) a poisonous snake" ... ku^amatu kuttan tannai Kokulankal talaramal kunramentik kattan ... - Govardhanadhari (PTM 2.5.4) "the Dancer with pots, he protected the Gokula from distress by lifting the hill" Tayiruntu kutamati... - Santana Gopala (PTM 5.10.1) "(You) eat curd and danced the kutam" Ku?amatik kovalanay ... - Gopala "Kovalan is the pot Dancer" Kuttar kutametuttatil Kovintan - Govinda (MOLI 4.4.6) "the Dancer (if he) lifts the pots and dances (he is) Govinda" Vaikuntah/koyilkonta kutakkuttavamman - Vaikunthamurti (MOLI 8.6.5) "(the Lord) whose abode is Vaikuntha (He) is the Father of pot dance" Kutamati yulakalanta ... - Trivikrama (PTM 10.10.4) "(You) measured the worlds by performing the pot dance" Kutamati vimmannum vinnum kulurika yulakalantu Natamatiya peruman ... ? Trivikrama (VIR 38) The last cited hymn avers that the Lord Dancer performed the kutam and measured the worlds, shaking the earth and sky. These are clear pointers to the fact that kutam is a type of dance, associated with Visnu's various avocations. That the kutam is pot is further confirmed. The pots were mounted on the head while dancing. To quote, cutalak/kutankal talaimi tetuttuk kontati (PTT 31) (Figs. 10-11) It means pots were mounted on the head, the dance performed with swift movements, maybe to the accompaniment of the playing of musical instruments (cf. Randhawa 1959: 26 fig., Lalit Kala 1990: PL XVI, fig. 5). It is also added that the pots were two in number, kuta mirantenti (CTML 1. 24) (cf. Lalit Kala 1990: PL XVI, fig. 5) (fig. 10). A number of sthalas are associated with the pot dance. To quote: Kutantaikkitanta kutamat "the pot dancer who is reclining at Kufcantai (Kumbhakonam)" (NAC 13.2) polilcul Kutantaik kutamati - Kumbhakonam (PTM 3.6.8) Ku^ankalantatik kuravai munkotta kuttavemmatikal - Maliruricolai (PTM 9.8.6) Tamil paftivar kutamatuvar - Tirukkottiyur 'sing the Tamil (Scriptures) and dance the pot" (PTM 9.10.9) Ku^amatu kuttan - Tirumoktir (MOLI 1 o. 1.11) Kutamati (pot dancer of) Arankam (Srirangam) (PTM 5.5.6-7) tayiruntu kutamatu "eat curd and dance the pot" - Nantipuravinnakaram (PTM 5.10.1)</page><page sequence="18">240 Raju Kalidos These may refer to the fact that pot dances were performed in honour of the presiding gods of the various sthalas in the Tamil country in those times. The kutam that the Lord carries may be symbolic of the butterpot (cf. Christie's 1974: fig. 84, Randhawa 1959: 26 fig.), very common in the household of the gopis. It may also symbolise the cosmic seeds, contained in a purnakumbha which Visnu carries in rare iconic pieces. The Govardhanadhari relief in Mamallapuram portrays Krsna lifting the hill while agopi (Nappinnai ?) carries the pot (= kumbha) on her head which may be the forerunner of the pot motifs, appearing in later Indian miniature paintings, cited in the foregoing account. These pots may have something to do with the dances of kutam (cf. also Kalidos 1997b: PL XXXVIa, Yaldiz 1992: fig. 65), so vividly portrayed by the Alvars. Today a type of folk dance, called karakattam (karakam "pot") is popular in the Tamil country which may be reminiscent of kutakkuttu. The motif was appropriated by the Nayanmar for Siva's dance (Kalidos 1996: 24-25) and the Lord is viewed in Harihara form while doing this. Nallaru, a Saiva sthala, is the venue where Harihara dances (cf. the interesting figure in Sotheby's 1997: fig. 182). The most illuminating picture of a dancing form is that of Sesasayi, the reclining one. The cayanattar, one in sayana, was the neyydtindr (cf. n. 2) and was admired by the antar, the cosmic beings (TM 1.1.5). The hymn adds, atukave atukave "dance, O, you dance". Another hymn is in praise of Pallikol-manavalar "the groom who reclines" through the ages, parpala kalamum, to the rhythm of dancing peacocks, representing Kannapiran (Krma) (NAC 10.6). It has been earlier pointed out that both Sesasayi and Siva-Nataraja are on the same plane philosophically (Kalidos 1997a). The Alvars further confirm the proposition. Apart from these familiar motifs of dance vis-a-vis the various iconographical forms of Visnu, there is an enigmatic theme. To quote: Muttavaikana mutumanar kunreri Kuttu uvantatik kulalalicaipati Vaytta maraiyor vanarika (TM 1.9.8) Muttavaikana would mean to be witnessed by forerunners in the field (i.e. dance). Then the Lord moves upon a sand dune and gives a dance recital to the tune of kulal and was adored by the maraiyor "Vedis". It is clearly a dance motif but the context of presentation is not understood. It may pertain to several of the types noted in the Cilappatikaram, rooted in Tamil cultural tradition. The presiding gods of the celebrated divyaksetras are visualized in dance forms. The following, for example, may be noted: Tiruvilaiyatu tintol Tirumaliruncolai nampi (NAC 9.3) "Present your holy recital, (My) Lord of Tirumaliruncolai" Aftim karutakkotiyutaiyar - Verikatam (NAC 10.5) "the Dancer who holds the Flag of Garuda" (Note: atumkarutan would mean dancing Garuda-supra) (Cf Fig. 5) Atukuttan - Vehkatam (PTM 2.1.9) "the dancing Dancer" Payinratararikam tirukkotti pannal Payinratum verikatame pannal payinra ... nirmalai (Til 46)</page><page sequence="19">Dance of Visnu: the spectacle of Tamil Alvars 241 "Arankam, Tirukkottiyur, Verikatam (Tirupati) and Tirunirmalai: where the Lord cultivates the dances, learns for so many aeons and dances". Summing up the findings of the study, it may be added that there are clear motifs, portraying the Dance of Visnu in the hymns of the Alvars which seem to be the base for the later plastic and pictorial illustrations. The pan-Indian motifs so far recognized in respect of Visnu are only those connected with Krma (cf. a recent account: Pal 1997). Apart from these, there are several others which the present study has brought to scholarly attention. These idioms, typical of the Tamil bhakti tradition, have their roots in the Cilappatikaram, an epic of the pre-Pallava period. The Alvars have given a new imagery to the Dance of Visnu, elevating him to the status of Nataraja, unique in religious and art history. In course of a historical cross-current, the vision-katci of the Alvars had an impact on the later Vaisnava philosophers all over the subcontinent (Basham 1971: 332-37) and poets like Jayadeva of Bengal whose Gitagovinda provided the base for the Indian miniature paintings (Randhawa i960, Archer i960, Khandalavala 1958, Bautze 1983) wherein we find the two polarities of the cutukatu of Siva-Nataraja and the colai of Visnu-Nataraja, and the dancing Lords at the acme of their glory. In justification of the epithet, Visnu-Nataraja, the Alvars offer ample clues; e.g. Kuttatavallaveriko, Kuttavappan, Atuvar (= Atavallan), Catirmurtti and Atarparavai. In a literature of encyclopaedic range, the Alvars had used a number of terminologies, meaning dance. They are attam, natam, kuttu, kiritai, vilaiyattu, catir and natakam. Specific dance types such as marakkal, kuravai, elli, cenkirai and cappani are recorded. These have roots in the antique Tamil tradition as there seems to have prevailed palnatam "several (types of) dances". Interestingly, all stand in association with the multifarious forms of Visnu. The stage where the Lord presented his enactment is variously called manram, arankam, kutam, patukatu, colai and kanakam. The pan-Indian iconographical tradition has made known only three basic modes of the images of Visnu. They are sthanaka, asana and sayana. The Alvars add natantu, parantu, kunintu and natam. So, by about the sixth century A.D. the Dance of Visnu was almost an accepted norm theoretically. The core ideas of the early Alvars continued to proliferate under the middle and later group, especially under Nammalvar, Periyalvar, Antal and Tirumarikai. In addition to Kaliyamar dana and rasakfida, the Alvars find Nr,sirhha, Astamukhagandhabherunda-Nr^irhha, Varaha murti, Vamana-Trivikrama and Sesasayi as dancers. Several of the forms of Krma get linked with dance. These include Santana Gopala, Gopala, Govinda, Yamalarjunabhariga, Kuva layaplda-vadham, Kamsa-vadham, Kaliyamardana, jalakfida in the Yamuna or Ganga, kamalilas with gopis. Gopivastrapaharana, Govardhanadhari and so on. The enigmatic motif of the "sand dune dance" is a problem to reckon with. Kutakkuttu is an important theme which goes in association with several of the forms of Visnu, Krsna especially. And the presiding Lords of a few of the divyaksetras are viewed in dancing modes. All these facets of the Dance of Visnu, and both the plastic and pictorial evidence, support the thesis that Visnu is Nataraja.

Appendix Frequency of dance motifs in Nalayiram Excepting three (viz., Pey, Maturakavi and Tiruppan) all others have appropriated the dance motifs in visualizing the personality of Visnu. The literary works which fail to include dance themes are TII (ioo), ACI (7), NAN (96), PAL (12), KAN, AMA, ELU and TVK. The absence of dance motife in these works may be quite accidental and not due to any ideologically oriented deliberate omission. The Alvars, belonging to chronological groups (vide, table below) had made use of the theme. Nearly 200 references on the subject are on record; the bulk of which goes to the credit of Tirumarikai (90), Nam (44), Periya (40) and An^al (10). Poykai, Putam, Kulacekarar, Tontarati and Tirumalicai show a low figure, less than five each. The Middle Alvars add importance to the subject, rooted in the Early group, and very much popularized by the Later Alvars. Nammalvar of the Middle group evinced a keen interest, later vigorously popularized by Tirumarikai and Periyalvar. Antal fails to talk about the dances in PAV but exploits it in the NAC, an erotic piece of work. This might add an erotic value to the dance theme itself as earlier pointed out. Having its origin during the 5th-6th century, the theme reaches its high watermark in the 8th?9th century. It was around this period that the Siva-Nataraja cult at Citamparam was gaining strong ground. The Vaisnavas popularising the Visnu-Nataraja cult may have a historical justification from the perspective of a competition with their rival Saiva cultists. If Siva-Nataraja could gain an upper hand over the Tillai-Kali by defeating her in a dance contest (Kalidos 1996a), the Vaisnavas could as well borrow the dance motif with the spirit of a sport or</page><page sequence="23">Dance of Visnu: the spectacle of Tamil Alvars 245 competition. If Siva is Atavallan, Visnu is then Kuttatavallavehko. If Siva performs the tiruvilaiyattu, Visnu could do it as well. If Siva as Nataraja could enact anandatandavam, Kjsna as Kaliyamardana could perform the same tandava (figs. 1?2), the former footed on Apasmara and the latter Kaliya. If the Sivz-ganas could sing and dance with their Lord, Visnu is innicaiyanavatt and the Dwarf Vamana could present his own kuttukal. In Indian tradition philosophical arguments, vatu (Rajarajan 1997a: 25), played a vital role in settling sectarian disputes (e.g. Sankara vs. Kumarilabhatta and the Jains of Maturai vs. Nanacampantar). It seems dance as a performing art had the same effect, later inducted into the realm of the plastic and pictorial arts.
