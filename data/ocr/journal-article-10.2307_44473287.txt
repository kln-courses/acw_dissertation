<plain_text><page sequence="1">950825 An Assessment of the Reliability of the NHTSA New Car Assessment Program George Z. Libertiny Ford Motor Co. ABSTRACT. An August 4, 1994 news release of the U.S. Department of Transportation [Ref.1] states that The National Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has determined that there is a positive relationship between scores it provides to consumers in its new car and light truck crash tests and the fatality risk in real-world crashes. 'Consumers can use this crash test information in their purchase decisions. We are pleased that our latest analysis verifies that the information continues to provide a valid indication of the crash protection that various makes and models provide,' said NHTSA Acting Administrator Christopher Hart." These assertions are said to be based on an NHTSA technical report [Ref.2]. In this referenced report, however, it is stated that the "results do not guarantee that an individual make- model with low NCAP (New Car Assessment Program; the crash test) scores will necessarily have lower fatality risk than other make-models with higher NCAP scores". The contradiction between the news announcement and the referenced underlying technical report is apparent. The questions this paper addresses are: 1) does the NCAP program provide "valid indication of crash protection"; and 2) is it true that the "consumers can use this crash information in their purchasing decisions"? Our analysis indicates that 1) the NCAP results have not been shown to provide a valid indication regarding the crash protection of specific vehicles; and 2) consumers will frequently make the wrong decisions if they use this information when making their purchasing decisions. In addition, we found that other researchers have reported similar findings regarding the lack of utility of NCAP, and the public statements of NHTSA are in conflict with the cautions expressed in their underlying technical documentation. INTRODUCTION. The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) is a program of frontal impact tests in which vehicles travelling at 35 mph speed are crashed into a fixed and rigid barrier. NCAP was initiated in 1978, with actual testing beginning the next year. [Ref. 2,3]. In the NCAP tests each vehicle carries two instrumented anthropomorphic dummies intended to simulate the 50th percentile adult male. These dummies are located in the front driver and front- right passenger seats and are restrained by the vehicle's safety belts and air bags. About 30 passenger cars and light trucks are tested each years; approximately 500 crash tests have been carried out since the actual testing begun in [Ref.2]. The NCAP test is similar in nature to, but substantially more severe, than the crash compliance test (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) - Standard No. 208). The major difference between the two tests is the speed of the vehicle when impacting the barrier. The FMVSS 208 test speed is 30 mph, while the NCAP test speed is 35 mph. Since kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the velocity, there is 36 percent more kinetic energy in a 35 mph crash than in a 30 mph crash. In both the NCAP and the Compliance tests (FMVSS 208), measurements on the dummies are used to calculate the "Head Injury Criterion" (HIC), the chest g' deceleration (3 millisecond peak) and 774</page><page sequence="2">the left and right femur loads (peak axial loads at knee). Specific upper limits for each of these parameters are established in FMVSS 208. The maximum allowable values are: HIC = 1000, Chest g' deceleration = 60 g's, femur load = 2250 lb. These values are reported to correspond to the level at which there is a one-in-six chance of an occupant sustaining an injury which could seriously threaten life. The NCAP crash test is not a compliance test. A manufacturer need not consider NCAP in its vehicle design process, as the minimum allowable safety performance criteria that vehicles must meet. Despite the seemingly "voluntary" nature of participation in NCAP, however, the NCAP program has become a "de facto" crash regulation. That is, a "poor* test result could result in adverse publicity for the vehicle model. Consequently, a prudent vehicle manufacturer feel constrained to design its vehicles to satisfy the NCAP tests, whether or not the test results have any meaningful relationship to motor vehicle safety. NCAP tests results are publicized by NHTSA so that they may be available for customer purchasing decisions. Furthermore, NHTSA is proposing to require that the NCAP crash test results are provided on a sticker on all new cars, and they are planning to respond to questions from the general public using a toll free Hotline [Ref. 3]. They already provide the information to the public through NHTSA's press releases. NHTSA has transformed the NCAP test results into a simplified form with a goal of facilitating the easy understanding of the results by the general public. In this process, instead of providing the HIC, chest g' and femur load data for a given vehicle, NHTSA describes the test result in a "five star" rating system. As NHTSA states [Ref.2,3] "Vehicles are classified by the estimated chance of injury for the driver or passenger, and receive a one to five star rating, with five stars indicating the best protection". The importance of determining how well the NCAP test results correlate with real life experience was recognized by the Congress. It instructed NHTSA to "provide a study to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations comparing the results of NCAP data from previous model years to determine the validity of these tests in predicting actual on-the-road injuries and fatalities over the lifetime of the models." As a response, NHTSA carried out a study comparing NCAP results to real world accident data; specifically, NHTSA correlated the NCAP test results to fatality risk in actual head on collisions [Ref. 2]. The object of this paper is to evaluate the procedures by which NHTSA has claimed to demonstrate that NCAP provides valid indication of crash protection useful in customer purchase decision making, and to asses the legitimacy of this claim. ANALYSIS In order to isolate the crashworthiness differences between cars, NHTSA attempted to remove differences attributable to demography and the way cars are driven by limiting the study to head on collision between belted drivers. The agency report reasoned that, in a head on collision "which drivers dies and which survives depends primarily on the intrinsic relative crashworthiness of the two cars, their relative weight, and the age and sex (vulnerability to injury) of the two drivers." The NHTSA's Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS), complete though mid-1992, was used to provide the basic accident data for the study. The FARS data were supplemented with curb weight of the subject vehicles derived from R.L. Polk's data bank. (NHTSA felt that the weight values in the FARS data base are not sufficiently accurate). In the FARS the agency found 396 head on collisions, involving 792 cars, in which both drivers were recorded being belted and both cars matched up with the NCAP case using the following criteria [Ref.2, p 30, 48]: • The make-models of FARS and NCAP cars were identical or true "corporate cousins" (e.g. Ford Tempo and Topaz), and • The model years of the FARS cars were within the range of applicable model years for the NCAP test - i.e., no earlier than the model year of the NCAP test vehicle and no later than the "end year". The regression model that best predicts the fatality risk of the drivers, according to NHTSA, using the 740 cases selected by it (certain missing data precluded the use of the full set of 792 cases), is a complex, multifaceted computation involving select driver and vehicle characteristics and crash test results (Ref.2, pages 54 and 61), as shown below. Fatalities per 100 collisions for Vehicle 1 = [exp(Pļ)/(1 +exp(Pļ)]100 Fatalities per 100 collisions for Vehicle 2 = [exp(p2)/(1+exp(p2)]100 775</page><page sequence="3">PERCENT BASELINE SUBJECT CAR REVISION REDUCTION IN FACTOR VALUE % CHANGE NEW VALUE FATAL RISK Car Weight 3000 lbs 10% 3300 lbs 19.6% Driver Age 30yrs 10% 27 yrs 6.0% Diver Gender Female N/A Male 12.9% HIC 700 10% 630 0.1% Chest g 50 10% 45 2.7% Femur Load 1600 lbs 10% 1440 lbs 1.8% TABLE 1.

In other words, small changes in HIC (for example) should lead to big changes in fatality risk, while small changes in driver age (for example) should not produce large changes in risk. To test this sensitivity, the NHTSA model was exercised to determine the relative change in fatality risk which was brought about by a small (1 0 percent) change in each of the predictor factors. If the NHTSA News Release assertion that NCAP information provides "valid indication of the crash protection that various makes and models provide" is true, then a 10 percent improvement in HIC (or chest g or femur load) values should result in a consequential improvement in predicted fatality risk. Table 1 shows the results of this sensitivity analysis. (A step-by-step example calculation using the NHTSA formulas is shown in the Appendix.) The baseline crash scenario consisted of a head-on fatal crash between two cars each with identical characteristics - 3,000 pounds, 30 year old female drivers, NCAP results of 700 HIC, 50 chest g, and 1 ,600 pound femur load. The first entry row of Table 1 shows the result of increasing the subject car weight by 10 percent, to 3,300 pounds, and leaving the other factors constant. (In this and all other variations, the characteristics associated with the other car do not change.) This 10 percent increase in weight leads to a 1 9.6 percent reduction in fatality risk for this driver, according to the NHTSA equations. Similarly, a 1 0 percent reduction in driver age - from 30 to 27 years - results in a predicted 776</page><page sequence="4">improvement of 6.0 percent in that driver's fatality risk. Table 1 also shows that changing the assumed gender of the driver from female to male (the concept of a 1 0 percent change cannot apply here) reduces the fatal risk by 12.9 percent. (Males are more resistant to injury, according to the data used by NHTSA.) Now consider the effects of a 10 percent "improvement" in NCAP values. A 10 percent reduction in HIC - from 700 to 630 - produces a 0.1 percent reduction in fatality risk. Reductions of 10 percent in chest g and femur load values produce reductions in fatal risk of 2.7 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. DISCUSSION Clearly, the NCAP information does not meet any reasonable standard of providing "valid indication of the crash protection that various makes and models provide." The contribution to fatal risk of the NCAP values, using NHTSA's own formulations, is negligible. This result should not be considered surprising, given the hystorical record of research which has attempted and failed to find any relationship between NCAP and accident data (Ref.4,5). This is especially true for HIC, which should be the most sensitive indicator of fatal risk among the NCAP readings. Yet the influence of femur loads on fatality risk is eighteen times that of HIC, a seemingly nonsensical result. Moreover, the relative effect of other factors - car weight in particular - overwhelms any influence of NCAP results. NHTSA appropriately acknowledges that NCAP results can be compared only among similar weight vehicles - but it can be shown that the NHTSA equations predict a change in vehicle weight of two pounds is equivalent to a 10 percent change in HIC value in affecting fatality risk. Why do the NCAP measures do so poorly in predicting injury outcomes in head-on crashes? One reason is the considerable importance of the other factors - car weight, driver age and driver gender - studied in the NHTSA analysis. Furthermore, there likely are other geographic, demographic and driver behavior factors not explicitly included by NHTSA which could influence injury risk, at least to the degree shown for HIC, chest g and femur load. Another prominent reason is the extent to which the test-to-test variability inherent in the NCAP testing process has been shown to be substantially larger than the typical differences reported in the NHTSA study between "good" (i.e., purportedly safe) and "poor" cars. While some may claim that adjustments to the FMVSS 208-type testing protocol have "solved" the test variability problem, no verification or validation to support this claim exists; crash test variability remains unreasonably large. The Chevrolet Citation test series conducted by NHTSA in 1982/1983 [Ref.6] remains the single most comprehensive and statistically well-controlled analysis of test variability ever undertaken. The HIC values in this test series ranged from 495 to 954. Similar high levels of test variability were identified in a series of 33 Mercury air bag crash tests and a series of seven Volvo tests [Ref. 4]. We are not aware of any scientific or statistical evidence which shows that test variability has been reduced to acceptable levels. As part of the attempt to correlate the NCAP results with the FARS data, NHTSA split the cars into a "poor" group and a "good" group. The grouping was done post hoc using various methods to identify the greatest difference between the two groups. The report managed to group the results into "poor" and "good" groups in such a way that the fatality rates for the "poor" and "good" groups were "statistically significantly" different. While the difference between these two groups may have been described as "statistically significant", the difference between the two groups was so small as to not be meaningful. The NHTSA report itself states (Ref.2, p 73-74) that ..."the average differences in NCAP performance, although statistically significant, are not vast in absolute terms. Average HIC differed by 40 or less, chest g's by 2-4 and femur load by no more than 250 pounds." These differences are inconsequentially small and within the range of expected testing errors, in other words, the NHTSA differences are truly buried in the noise of the testing procedure. More recently, NHTSA has begun reporting results using a "star system" that places vehicles in one of five categories that represent different ranges of injuries. The "Five Star" system was developed subsequent to the research in the NHTSA technical report (Ref. 2) and hence was not discussed or tested for correlation in that report. The reader had to assume that the usage of the "Five Star" system is based on the findings in the report (Ref.2, p 77) that "The sensitivity tests confirm that any reasonable combination of head, chest and femur injury scores, not just NCAPINJ (one of the proposed composite parameters), will correlate well with fatality risk." [Emphasis is original.] The "Five Star" composite parameter is determined as follows [Ref. 7]. The combined 777</page><page sequence="5">probability for injury (CPI) is calculated from the following equation: CPI = PHEAD + PCHEST " (PHEAD X PCHEST) where PHEAD = 1/[1 + exp(5.02 - 0.00351 X HIC)] PCHEST = 1/[1 + exp(5.55 - 0.06930 x Chest G)] PHEAD and PCHEST in tum are based on biomechanical tolerance relationships put forth in the technical literature as showing the probability of an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) level 4-6 of fatal head and chest injury, and level 3-6 leg injury [Ref. 2]. The "Five Star" designation is then determined from the following table. STAR DESIGNATION CPI 5 Stars ***** CPI &lt; 0.10 4 Stars **** 0.10 &lt;= CPI &lt; 0.20 3 Stars *** 0.20 &lt;= CPI &lt; 0.35 2 Stars ** 0.35 &lt;= CPI &lt; 0.45 1 Star * 0.45 &lt;= CPI The relationship between HIC, Chest g and the corresponding stars is illustrated in Figure 1. It should be noted that the Femur Loads measured in the NCAP tests are not included in the "Five Star" system, although their effect on the fatality rate regression equation in the NHTSA technical report [Ref.2] has been shown above to be an order of magnitude higher than the effect of HIC. Figure 1. Five Star System In the "Five Star" system the cars are grouped into five groups instead of the two groups the NHTSA report [Ref.2] uses. If the difference was negligible when the cars were divided into two groups, the group-to-group difference in a sample divided into five groups has even less meaning. Nothing in the NHTSA technical report or other known scientific literature indicates that there is any meaningful difference in risk between a five star and a four star vehicle. On the contrary, for example, the report itself stated that the results ...'will not identify any specific make-model (with or without poor NCAP scores) as being significantly less than average car". (Ref.2, p.13). Nevertheless, the NHTSA News release (Ref.1) ignores this caution and states that "Consumers can use this crash test information in their purchase decisions. We are pleased that our latest analysis verifies that the information continues to provide a valid indication of the crash protection that various makes and models provide,..." The NHTSA analysis recognized some of the limitations of the analysis method it had adopted. The summary of the limitations of that method, according to NHTSA, is given in the following. 1. The NCAP tests are compared to the FARS results, however the boundary conditions of the FARS data and the NCAP tests are not identical or even similar. The NCAP tests are carried out always at 35 mph speed, the impact is straight ahead into a flat barrier with contact over the entire front of the car, and the driver dummies simulate 50th percentile males. The FARS data base includes all closing speeds (it could be very different from the 35 mph of the NCAP tests), the frontal impact maybe at an angle, and all type of drivers are included. The NHTSA report thus states (Ref.2. p 12-13), that as a consequence "... it is inappropriate to expect perfect correlation between NCAP test results and actual fatality risk in the FARS sample." 2. The NHTSA report states (Ref 2. p. 13) that "...None of the analyses of this report are conducted at the make-model level.. .."femphasis of NHTSA]. Furthermore, the NHTSA report states that the report " ...will not identify any specific make-model (with or without poor NCAP scores) as being significantly less safe than the average car." 3. The NHTSA report states (Ref.2, p 13) "Since the accident data in this study are limited to head-on collisions between two cars with belted drivers, the correlations found here do not necessarily extend to other types of frontal impacts, such as collisions with fixed objects or trucks, let alone side impacts, rear impacts, rollover or crashes involving drivers who do not wear safety belts." 778</page><page sequence="6">CONCLUSIONS The claims in the NHTSA Press Release are not supportable. Information contained in the NHTSA Technical Report refutes the claims of the August 4, 1994, NHTSA News Release regarding NCAP that "... our latest analysis verifies that the information continues to provide a valid indication of the crash protection that various makes and models provide ... consumers can use this crash test information in their purchase decisions." Contrary to these erroneous claims, the NHTSA Technical Report correctly states that "... None of the analyses of this report are conducted at the make-model level ... these results do not guarantee that any individual make-model with low NCAP scores will necessarily have lower fatality risk than other make-model with higher NCAP scores". [Emphasis in original.] Crash test variability remains unreasonably large. NHTSA's Chevrolet Citation test series remains the single most comprehensive and statistically well-controlled analysis of test variability ever undertaken. This experiment found substantial levels of test-to-test variability. Similar high levels of test variability were identified in a series of 33 Mercury air bag crash tests and a series of seven Volvo tests. While some may claim that adjustments in the test protocol have "solved" this variability problem, no verification or validation to support this claim exists. NHTSA crashes about 30 vehicles each year in the NCAP program; if NHTSA believes that test variability has been substantially reduced from that found in the Citation test series, the agency should use a portion of these tests to conduct a properly controlled statistical experiment to validate that claim. Differences between "good" and "poor" car groups are small and not meaningful. The NHTSA Technical Report acknowledges that "... the average differences in NCAP performance, although statistically significant, are not vast in absolute terms. Average HIC differed by 40 or less, chest g's by 2-4 and femur load by no more than 250 pounds." A difference of 40 HIC cannot be considered consequential when the HIC vakues in the Citation test series ranged 495 to 954. Vehicle weight is by far the most important predictor of fatality risk. The NHTSA Technical Report analysis equations show that the effect of the vehicle weight could be well over 100 times as high as the effect of HIC. Even the effect of the femur load could be about 18 times as high as the effect of HIC in predicting fatality risk - a seemingly nonsensical result. Finally, the issue of extrapolating the results of the NHTSA analysis to other crash circumstances encountered by car occupants must be addressed. NCAP tests only reflect results for full frontal impact on belted, 50 percentile male drivers. The NHTSA Technical Report appropriately cautions that "... the correlations found here do not necessarily extend to other types of frontal impacts, such as collision with fixed objects or trucks, let alone side impacts, rear impacts, rollovers or crashes involving drivers who do not wear safety belts." The NHTSA report further limits the studied population to include only cars involved in head on fatal crashes in which both car models happen to have available NCAP scores. In fact, the approximately 400 fatal crashes utilized in the NHTSA model amount to roughly 0.1 percent of the passenger car fatal crashes during the period NHTSA studied. Such narrowly-limited tests cannot be extrapolated one-thousand fold in an attempt to provide model-by-model crash protection information useful to the consumer interested in all foreseeable crash circumstances. The American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA) has reported similar conclusions: "In summary, AAMA believes the NHTSA report has pertinence to only a small fraction of fatal crashes, and NCAP scores cannot be shown to provide meaningful injury risk information even in that small fraction." (Ref.8). ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The contribution of I.S. Parekh and J.B. Edwards are thanked and acknowledged.
