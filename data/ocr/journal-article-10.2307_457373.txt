<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ivi MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION THE BATTLE OF THE BOOKS * BY OLIVER FARRAR EMERSON Ladies and Gentlemen, You will pardon me, I hope, for taking this classic title of the great Swift, since the subject continues to have relations to our modern life. Yet at the beginning I deprecate the title's belligerency, so inappro- priate to the peaceful group here present and here repre- sented. Indeed, I trust we may all subscribe to the sentiment of a brilliant woman of Swift's own age and country. Just a a century and three quarters ago, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu wrote of what she called "the palpable follies still almost universally persisted in," "I place that of war amongst the most glaring." It is not, therefore, to encourage any belligerent notions, that I borrow this title of the witty Dean of St. Patrick's in discussing a struggle, evolutionary rather than warlike, between books as representatives of the languages and literatures of past and present times, and in considering the bearings of this struggle on present educational conditions. When Swift wrote his immortal booklet there had arisen a conflict between the classics, or so-called humanities, on the one side, and what we know as natural science and the modern tongues on the other. Science, it would seem, had raised its head in quite modest ways. It is true that, in the year the Pilgrim Fathers landed on the wintry shore of New England, Francis Bacon had printed his Novum Orga- num, expounding the method of all modern and hopeful investigation. Nearly twenty years before Swift issued his Battle of the Books Isaac Newton had published his Principia, and offered to the world that theory of a gravitational force which, for more than two centuries, has cleared men's vision to the appreciation of law and order in the universe. In the main, however, the natural science of Swift's time was * The President's Address, delivered at Ann Arbor on the evening of Thursday, December 27, 1923, at the Fortieth Meeting of the Modern Language Association of America.</page><page sequence="2">PROCEEDINGS FOR 1923 lvii humble enough. The young Wotton, in his "fair and judicial" answer to Sir William Temple, had modestly claimed for the moderns some improvements in mathematics as applied to fortifications. Bacon had lost his life in what would seem to us the ridiculously simple experiment of testing whether snow would preserve the flesh of a fowl. The Royal Society was still investigating some of the most elementary matters of the natural world. From our point of view, therefore, there was little occasion for Swift to pillory the young Cambridge scholar, or the science he was so temperately supporting. Nor should we for a moment oppose the splendid position which natural science has come to hold in modern education, as in the modern world. If it cannot be grouped with the older humanities, as they were called, it has made its place with humanity in the broader sense, a place which we are all glad to acknowledge and applaud. Swift's Battle of the Books, however, dealt more largely with the relations of ancient and modern literatures, or in the language of the time ancient and modern learning. It is this part of his subject, too, which still has direct bearing upon education and vital relation to us all. Indeed, the relations of ancient and modern learning have undergone continued strain since Swift's time, and furnish a theme not unworthy of new consideration. To begin with, let us look at this theme from the historical point of view, that point of view which we have come to prize as most likely to be enlightening, and which we have learned to employ so largely in all investigations. When the modern languages were first appearing in litera- tures of their own, there was no Battle of the Books, no conflict between ancient and modern learning. The classical literatures of Greece and Rome had been largely banished by the Church, and medieval Greek and Latin, which continued to be written, were not hostile to the vernaculars. Though rarely acknowledged by modern classicists, these medieval tongues embodied, in no small degree, the life of medieval peoples. In the east Greek culture, though soon "dominated by theological interests," continued its former attention to</page><page sequence="3">lviii MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION secular history. Greek philosophy sent forth Neo-Platonism to oppose Christianity, though to perish in the conflict. Greek mathematics and astronomy left their impress on the world for centuries, through the works of Euclid and the system of Ptolemy. Greek philology, with its grammars, dictionaries, and commentaries, still bridges the gap between ancient and modern classical scholarship. In biography Plutarch, in rhetoric Longinus, in fiction Xenophon of Ephesus, Longus, and Heliodorus were to continue their influence into the modern world. Of Greek origin were a new sort of history, that of the Church, a new sort of bio- raphy, that of churchmen, and a new use of animal lore in the Fables of AEsop and the allegories of the Physiologus. In western Europe Latin was the language of the Church and of learning generally. To it was intrusted the theology, history, biography, and letters of the western world, together with what little there was of natural science and encyclopedic lore. To no small extent, too, Latin was the spoken medium among churchmen, in general the only learned men of the time. There was thus present a phenomenon not since repeated in the civilized world. Existing side by side with the various modern languages of western Europe, yet with no conflict of interests, Latin was a universal language which crossed national boundaries with the ease of an airplane, and readily conveyed the ideas of the thinker in one nation to his scholarly brethren in other lands. There was as yet in western Europe, let me again empha- size, no conflict of interests between the ancient and modern languages, no Battle of the Books. The modern tongues were beginning to appear in manuscript form, yet not in opposition to the use of Latin, or usually intended to displace that language. At first they were little more than glosses or Latin works for the use of the less learned clergy. The original poetry of early northern England was scarcely more than free paraphrase of the Scriptures, or of medieval Latin story. When, as rarely, the early English poet turned to native song or legend, as in Beowuilf, there was no thought</page><page sequence="4">PROCEEDINGS FOR 1923 lix of rivaling ancient classical masterpieces.1 Later translations of medieval Latin, as those sponsored by King Alfred of England in the ninth century, were explained and excused by the decadence of Latin learning, a decadence deplored in the strongest terms by the great English king. When the modern literatures did aspire to a larger place, it was the result of a natural desire to reach the larger national groups in practical ways. There was no thought of displacing Latin in the sphere it had so long filled. Thus, beside the Latin version of the Bible, still recognized as the authoritative form, there began to appear vernacular versions of favorite portions, as of the Psalms and the Gospels, pre- pared not to supersede the established Book of the Church, but to reach and serve the common people more directly. The Lessons of the church service, Homilies, and Lives of Saints appeared in the modern tongues for the same reason. Besides, for centuries of the medieval period-I illustrate from English primarily, though the matter was not far dif- ferent in any modern language-all vernacular literature was written by clerics, and was not in conflict with the doctrines or the language of the Church. Conflict between medieval Latin and English came only when the Church saw its spiritual power threatened. In England there is little or no recorded opposition to early versions of the Scriptures.2 Only when Wyclif, an opponent of papal supremacy in other respects, made or caused to be made a complete translation of the Bible, and claimed for it authority above the Church, did the latter oppose this doctrinal use of the vernacular. Fortunately, shall we not say, Wyclif and his followers forced the issue, carried the native tongue into sermon and religious controversy, until the established church was also compelled to meet its opponents in the language of the people. It was with the revival of the classical literatures of Greece and Rome that the Battle of the Books really began. Nor did 1 This was essentially true, even if the slight resemblances to classical epics are seriously considered. 2 Miss Deanesly's Lollard Bible (Cambridge Medieval Studies) seems to prove this conclusively enough, although her thesis is just the opposite.</page><page sequence="5">lx MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION conflict appear at once. At first the modern nations gladly accepted the new learning, and promptly responded to the stimulus of the newly revived literatures. The new studies were at once placed in the schools, where they soon super- seded the study of medieval Latin, and finally dominated educational life. It was this domination of educational life by the c'lassics which precipitated the Battle of the Books. Conflict began, too, only when the advocates of the new learning claimed precedence for the classical languages and literatures, not only over their medieval forms, but over anything that had been, or could be accomplished with the modern tongues. In language the notion was maintained that the classical forms of expression had some inherent advantage over the modern. Greek and Latin were "perfect" languages, fixed and unchanging in character. As the modern languages were known to have changed in historical times, they must be "imperfect." Caxton, the great printer and translator, with slight knowledge of linguistic relationships, bewailed that "we Englysshe men ben borne under the domynacyon of the mone, whiche is never stedfaste but ever waverynge." Francis Bacon was certain that "these modern languages will, at one time or other, play the bankrupts with books," and labored with much pains that his own writings should be "well translated into Latin," "the universal language" as he called it. In the same age the pedant king, James First, begged John Barclay to translate Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia into Latin, in order to preserve it to future generations, of course, and Barclay did write in that language his rival novel A rgenis. So far as this early adoration of the classical tongues made the moderns more sensitive to imperfections in their own vernaculars, and more eager to speak and write their own languages in a pleasing and beautiful manner, all was good and to be commended. Unfortunately, with such good tendency, came a mania for imitation. If Latin and Greek were the only perfect tongues, the modern languages could be made perfect only by imitating their forms of expression.</page><page sequence="6">PROCEEDINGS FOR 1923 lxi In Italy, Bembo placed exact imitation of the Latin classics as the highest goal. In France, the idea of classical imitation was espoused by Du Bellay and Ronsard. The forms of Latin verse were alone to be followed, and a poetic language and style, heavily charged with Latin words and differing from the native speech and prose, were set up. In England, it was proposed to abandon the long prevailing rimed verse, and establish the classical unrimed forms. Many an English prose writer, too, took pride in a Latinized diction and style, cumbrous and difficult to read, while even Milton in his Areopagitica was to follow the model of a Greek oration so exactly, as sometimes to use an order of words wholly at variance with that of his native tongue. Classical imitators delighted to garnish their prose with quotations which would have been unintelligible to a Walton, a Bunyan, and a Burns, a Whittier and a Whitman; or to take some illustrations from a different sphere, a Washington, a Nelson, a Lincoln, a Lloyd George. They served at best to tickle the momentary attention of other classicists, and were finally to be more honored in the breach than the observance, or wholly to disappear in favor of expression in the native tongue. Under the anomalies of imitation the academic world Latinized its names and its procedure, as if by such artificial process it could increase its enlightenment or its ingenuity. In the same way the scholarly world delighted in such transforma- tions as that of the Netherlander Geert Geerts into Desiderius Erasmus, and that of the Germans Schwarzerd and Muller of Konigsberg into Mlelancthon and Regiomantanus. Even in death the classical devotee thought he would rest easier under an alien "Hic jacet" and ponderous Latin epitaph. Fortunately the modern languages had their supporters. The great Dante had early perceived that a man's best expression, in general his only hope of literary immortality, was in the use of his mother speech. With some conscious appreciation of the same truth, one likes to feel, Chaucer used English only, never so far as we know writing in Latin or French, as did his less original contemporary Gower. Fol- lowing his master Chaucer, the Elizabethan Spenser led the</page><page sequence="7">lxii MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION way to a native poetry of high excellence. The best of the Elizabethan prose translators, as Sir Thomas North in his Plutarch's Lives, and the best of the Jacobean translators, as those of the Bible, established in the native idiom a simple, smoothly flowing English. The writers of the new drama had their by no means inconsiderable influence. Dependent upon the immediate appreciation of popular audiences, they made their appeal in the language of the people, in which the mighty Shakespeare embodied the noblest sentiments and the choicest feeling. Over against a curious and often mistaken devotion to the ancient languages, such writers set the splendid native literature of the Elizabethan age. In Shakespeare and the English Bible the battle for the native speech, as against the imitation of classical diction and idiom, was nobly won. It is useless to surmise what might have been in western Europe, if the classical revival had not taken place. Yet it may be pointed out that in England the rise of a new national spirit had already begun in the fourteenth century. The dis- coveries of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries had no mean part in disclosing a new world of literature, as of land and sea. Witness how the mysterious western world suggested to the philosopher More the greatest of modern Utopias, and, touching the imagination of Shakespeare, blossomed into his last and one of his greatest plays. The Reformation was the most vital force in the life and poetry of the Puritan Spenser and the Puritan Milton. English individualism among the sturdy middle class, braving dangers of exile and a barren wilderness, set up a new and nobler model of human government in the western world. Witness how that venture, even in its earlier days, touched with fire the lips of the Pilgrim layman, Robert Cushman, and his prophetic utter- ance, "the memory of this action shall never die." Even without the classical revival the English spirit must even- tually have found expression in a great native literature, as the kindred arts of painting and architecture found indepen- dent expression among the modern nations. But the struggle between ancient and modern learning in</page><page sequence="8">PROCEEDINGS FOR 1923 lxiii England displayed itself, not simply in the conflict between the classical languages and the vernacular. If the classical languages were perfect, the classical literatures were no less supreme in their kind. The result was an era of imitation of classical models at the expense of originality and the develop- ment of native genius. Take, for example, the poetic pastoral. I waive the question whether it was ever a realistic form, a portraiture of life even on classical soil. The early English pastoral, at any rate, was one of the most unrealistic forms ever used by Englishmen. Shepherd life had existed in England for ages, but the influence of the classical form retarded for more than two centuries the development of a native pastoral based on the realities of English conditions. Only when Burns wrote his Cotter's Saturday Night and Wordsworth his Michael did England come to have a pastoral poetry of native reality, rather than one of classical imitation and convention. One of the most extraordinary results of purely classical imitation was the incorporation into the poetry of the modern nations of an alien and outworn mythology. I say outworn because, in the great periods of the classical literatures, the myths had become little more than convention, had largely lost the beauty of their prime, and had often become tarnished with the crudest anthropomorphism. Yet the modern na- tions, all nominally Christian and some sincerely so, plastered their poetry with allusions to classical divinities, too many of whom had lost all connection with morality or religion, and the use of which, even in allusion, too frequently closed the eyes to exact observation of nature, as it also dulled the edge of imagination. The climax of classical imitation was reached in the poet's continued invocation of a muse in whose existence no one believed, and from whom no one expected aid. Again it was two centuries before Wordsworth, when protesting the artificialities of poetic diction in a sonnet of Gray, criticized the line, And redning Phoebus lifts his golden fire, as false in imagery, and only conventionally accurate in the expression of fact.</page><page sequence="9">lxiv MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION Once more we may say fortunately, from such conventional and artificial ornamentation, English poetry has been gradually ridding itself, as it has become a more genuine expression of life and character. The English maker, whether or poetry or prose, surrounded by the same nature that had inspired the Greeks, and to a less extent the Romans, has been more thoroughly observing and more artistically pre- senting the realities of man and the natural world-the human, the divine-and more directly ministering to the culture and refinement of the English spirit. Most unfortunate of all, and longest to continue, false notions of the classics were to affect education and the study of the modern tongues. We count it a landmark in the study of English when John Cornwall, in the fourteenth century, taught his pupils to translate their Latin into the mother tongue, instead of into French. With the renais- sance, however, the classics usurped the principal attention of the schools. The first textbook on the writing of English belongs, it is true, to the middle of the sixteenth century, but composition at that time, wholly by a classical convention, included only the art of the public speaker, and it was more than two centuries before the systematic study of the writing of English began with Blair and Campbell. The theory had been, and we occasionally hear it professed today, that the only way to learn the correct and beautiful speaking and writing of the vernacular was by translating the classical literatures. To the plea that under such training great modern writers have appeared, one may answer that the argument is at best that of post hoc, propter hioc. When the classics became the main subjects of instruction in the schools, they gave little attention to the modern tongues, or to other modern subjects. To take a specific example, it was in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, more than two hundred and fifty years after the founding of Rugby, that the great and liberal Arnold en- riched the classical curriculum of the school by the addition of history, mathematics, and the modern languages. It was not until the last half of the nineteenth century, by a pro-</page><page sequence="10">PROCEEDINGS FOR 1923 lxv cess incredibly slow it would seem, that the modern subjects, and especially the modern languages, acquired a reasonable place in all systems of secondary and higher training. Fin- ally, the native literature gradually edged its way into school and college, as a subject worthy of that closer study which had so long been accorded to the ancient classics. In fact, the classical revival, stimulating as it was, actually narrowed the field of culture in western Europe. It was hostile to the development of the modern tongues. It excluded medieval life and literature, fostering a notion of the so-called Dark Ages from which we are only now re- covering. It neglected the Greek and Roman development of physical science, which was kept alive and extended mainly by Arabian scholars, until it came to a new birth by reason of modern European genius. On its spiritual side it was paganizing, a tendency fortunately counteracted by the Reformation, and by the liberal awakening within the Roman Catholic church. The Battle of the Books, or rather the evolutionary process of modern education, has been a gradual recovery from the narrow notion of culture resulting from the classical revival to the broadened conceptions of modern life, to a new politics, a new social order, a new interpretation of nature, a new humanitarianism, a new education. The means by which the modern literatures have come to independent development has been by breaking away from that close imitation suggested and fostered by the classi- cists. The Elizabethan Spenser made an artistic poem of the Virgilian Culex by paraphrasing it with exceeding freedom. Shakespeare based his Roman plays on a translation of Plutarch's Lives. The so-called Pindaric ode has held its place, not because it was ever a close imitation of Pindar, but because its free and stately verse has been found aptly usable for certain subjects and occasions. In the age of Bentley, whose unappreciated classical learning did not save him from Swift's satire, Dryden's and Pope's translations from the classics, as a little later those of Joseph Warton, owed their popularity to their being graceful English poems,</page><page sequence="11">lxvi MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION rather than to their dependence upon their originals, or to any considerable preservation of the classical spirit. Indeed, in that period the ancient poems were often a mere point of departure, as in Johnson's clever adaptations from the satires of Juvenal. Later, Shelley and Wordsworth made excellent English poems on classical subjects, not by conventionally retelling the older stories as so many had done, but by revivi- fying their human relations, and giving them a modern and original appeal. In another respect the evolutionary process of which I have spoken has been a pragmatic, if not an academic, revaluation of education and the schools. It is just forty years since Charles Francis Adams startled the academic world of America by proclaiming the study of the classics a college fetich. Today, that great publicist could hardly find fault with the attention given to the languages of Greece and Rome. The process may have gone too far in certain directions. Yet it may be said, without fear of the pro- phetic role, that the modern languages have secured some permanent place in our educational systems; that physical science can never again be excluded from our schools; that history and the social sciences, bettered by more thorough study of man and society, will continue to demand some considerable portion of educational time. These new sub- jects, beginning some centuries ago with modest supplication for a place, have finally forced the battle with the ancient books. Or, to drop the militaristic figure, which I deplore, these new subjects have resumed the position they once held in Greek and Roman education, when philosophy and physical science had an important place beside the languages which were then modern, if now well called ancient. Indeed, the modern nations, in their present and comnparatively recent emphasis of the native tongues and their literatures, as well as in their native development of science and philosophy, are but following the best practice of the classical nations. What, however, shall be said for the ancient classics in modern education? Some place we all wish them to hold, and believe they will hold. Yet it may be pointed out that</page><page sequence="12">PROCEEDINGS FOR 1923 lxvii classical supporters often injure their cause by some of their arguments for their old supremacy. Especially is this true in connection with the linguistic relations of English and the classics, particularly Latin. When, for example, the Ameri- can instructor in Latin asserts that words like arbor, ardor, color, labor show direct dependence of English upon Latin, it may be noted that the apparently direct dependence is here wholly due to a certain Noah Webster. That comparatively recent American made such words seem more nearly Latin by throwing out a u, received from their Old French originals, and now useless as I hope we all believe. Nor need I remind you that such an argument would little appeal to many of our British brethren, so admirably liberal in many ways, so curiously conservative in clinging to an ideographic spelling which resulted from a fossilizing process some centuries ago. Let us admit frankly that there is no effective or far-seeing bolstering of the classics by false claims. Actual contact with a spoken Greek or Latin affected the Teutonic languages but slightly. Church is about the only word which drifted in from spoken Greek. The words wail, wine, wick 'a town' are about the only words with initial w which show borrowing from something like the spoken tongue of the Romans when initial v was a bilabial. Scarcely a dozen words in the oldest English prove by their forms that they were picked up in speech from something like classical Latin. From early medieval Latin the list is somewhat longer, but incredibly short for the period before Latin developed into the Romance languages. What, then, is meant by the continued assertion of the classicists, that something like forty-five per cent of our vocabulary comes from Latin? The assertion rests, with slight regard for scholarly accuracy let me say, on the vast accessions from Romance sources, mainly French. A genera- tion ago, when Latin was pronounced by what was called the English method, in reality an Old French method as it had developed on English soil, there was some reason in telling a schoolboy that words like Cavsar and Cicero were Latin. But in this age, in which we pride ourselves somewhat</page><page sequence="13">lxviii MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION on linguistic accuracy, we should be willing to be accurate, no matter how old-fashioned arguments are disturbed. But what proportion of our vocabulary is really of Latin adoption? Fortunately, a reliable examination of an English masterpiece, the Opium Eater of De Quincey, may give us some correct notion. Such a work by such a writer, it may be pointed out, is least likely to show a minimum of classical influence. Such minimum would appear in works like Malory's Morte D'Arthur, the King James version of the Bible, Shakespeare's Plays, the Speeches of Lincoln, the poetry of Wordsworth or Whitman. Now in De Quincey's Opium Eater the words of Teutonic origin, as computed by Professor Cook of Yale, then at the University of California,3 form in round numbers 45 per cent; those from French, mainly Old French, 41 per cent; those from Greek a trifle less than one half of one per cent; and those from Latin 13 per cent. Moreover, the Latin element in the Opium Eater is not nearly so large, and the Teutonic element correspondingly larger, since the computation was made on a somewhat exceptional basis. Professor Cook excluded, for a special reason quite right in its way, all pronominal words, pre- positions, verbal auxiliaries, many short adverbs, the verb is and the articles a, an, words or classes of words without which scarcely a single thought can be expressed in our Eng- lish tongue. Had such words been counted, as they have usually been in such cases, the Latin element in the Opium Eater would certainly not have reached ten per cent. I may remind you that the whole foreign derived element in the actual usage of Shakespeare has been estimated at not more than ten per cent, and that in the English Bible at not more than six. Again, the computation was made nearly forty years ago on the basis of Skeat's Etymological Dictionary of 1881, an entirely proper authority for that time. But forty years of etymological study have shown that the Latin element in English was then overestimated. Specifically. Professor 3 See Modern Language Notcs I, 15-16.</page><page sequence="14">PROCEEDINGS FOR 1923 lxix Derocquigny of the University of Lille proved some years ago that many English words, assumed to be of Latin origin by Skeat and the New English Dictionary, are really of Old French provenance. Besides, since many Old French texts are still unprinted, and the study of Derocquigny not exhaus- tive, the French element in English will be still further increased in the future, and the so-called Latin element correspondingly diminished. I recognize there is some superficial justice in considering many French words as of Latin origin, by reason of their visual likeness to Latin. For example, the visual forms of words like motiont, nation show apparent derivation from a Roman source, when their pronunciation and their earlier English forms predicate their origin in Old French. The visual likeness in such cases is due to a conscious conforma- tion to Latin, a conformation first affected by the French, and later adopted by the English. Yet, if we are to be at all fair to linguistic processes, which should be known even to our classical colleagues, we must recognize the overwhelming indebtedness of English, in the borrowed element of its vocabulary, to French rather than to classical Latin. Even our scientific vocabulary, visually according with Latin, or if from Greek with Latin forms, is usually pronounced after the manner of Old French words already in the language. Indeed, with rare exceptions, late borrowings from the c&amp;assical tongues have been conformed to Old French models. I have emphasized these linguistic facts, because arguments for the study of the classics have so often been based upon them, and because I believe that classical study-which all regard as desirable-should no longer rest on misstatements of these or other relationships. If the study of Latin rests on its influence upon the English vocabulary, much more should we argue for the study of French, and even Old French. Again, there is often as much inaccuracy in asserting a general dependence of our literature upon classical sources, as classical sources are usually understood. On the latter point I may remind you that classicists themselves generally confine Greek literature to the Attic period of less than</page><page sequence="15">lxx MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION two hundred years, and Latin literature, even with Silver Latin included, to a period not much longer. Now, in this sense, not a single monument of Old English literature rests upon a classical source. Old English literature was based upon Teutonic materials, or on Latin of the too often despised medieval writers. With rare exceptions, too, the literature of the Middle English period was based upon Teutonic, medieval Latin, and Old French materials. I refer, of course, to the immediate originals of such works. Chaucer and Gower, it is true, used classical Latin sources to some extent, as Chaucer was exceptional for his time in using Italian. Yet only a small part of Chaucer's best poetry rests upon an immediate classical source, and there is no evidence that he ever preferred classical to medieval ma- terials. The next most important works of the time, Piers Plowman and the poems of the Pearl poet, show few if any allusions which can be directly traced to classical literature. Of classical forms imitated in the modern period, I have already adverted to the pastoral and the so-called Pindaric ode. The classical dialogue, as a medium for seriously discussing any important subject, has long since been discredited. One can not cease to regret that the poet Spenser, after more than a decade of residence in Ireland, should have discussed the Irish question in this ineffective form, instead of detailing his personal experiences in that storm-swept country. One may appreciate Dryden's graceful use of the classical dialogue in his Essay of Dramatic Poesie, without for a moment foregoing the wish that he had ex- pounded his ideas of dramatic technique in a less conventional form. The outstanding examples of the moral essays of Seneca and Plutarch are those of Bacon, but Bacon's Essays have endeared themselves to Englishmen, not as imitations of a classical model, but for their wholesome truths which still come home to men's business and bosoms, and for their revelation of the Elizabethan philosopher's distinctive personality. The treatment of human life in the English Character, the most frequent classical imitation of the seventeenth century, has long since given way to a more</page><page sequence="16">PROCEEDINGS FOR 1923 lxxi realistic and satisfying treatment in the English novel, a literary form which has long outgrown any dependence upon a classical source. Milton's Paradise Lost stands in splendid isolation, an isolation which probably most of us believe it will continiue to occupy, as the English example of the long drawn out, shall I say heavy, classical epic. It is not too much to say that the largest and most vital portion of modern English literature is not primarily of classical origin. Classical influence there has been, some of it most unfortunate as I have hinted. Spenser's Faerie Queene, in its form and features, owes more to Ariosto and Tasso than to Aristotle and the classics. The Elizabethan dramatists, early breaking away from the Senecan mode, developed a new dramatic technique, and a new presentation of life and character, which have ever since been the glory of Englishmen. Hebrew literature is responsible for the most influential of all Elizabethan books, the King James version of the Scriptures, as for the subject matter of Milton's great epic and the framework of the wittiest of Dryden's longer poems, the Absolom anid Achitopliel. The most widely read of classical translations, Pope's Homer, was made by one who entered but slightly into the spirit of his great original. The classicism of Keats was that of the classical dictionary, while its spirit was derived from romantic notions quite at variance with classical ideas. The great originals of our later literature, as Lincoln and Whitman, and the vigorous Masefield for present-day Britain, owe little to classical training, and least of all to classical convention. Too often modern supporters of the classics are as misguided as was Sir William Temple, Swift's early patron, who, in mistaken zeal for the ancient books, claimed special antiquity for the Greek versions of Fsop's Fables and for the spurious Epistles of Phalaris. But again I emphasize that my purpose is not belligerent, or intended to minimize any wholesome classical influence upon our modern languages and literatures. Belligerency, as we of this age should certainly realize, settles nothing in this war-torn world. It is only by investigation of realities,</page><page sequence="17">lxxii MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION by understandings, and by arbitrament of differences that true progress is possible. Besides, teachers of the modern languages are not hostile to the classics. They would prefer that all who sit at their feet should have the amplest knowl- edge of the ancient books. Yet they are not willing, and should not be willing, to return to the conditions of Swift's day two centuries ago, or to those of one century ago. More- over, our classical brethren should be encouraged by the fact that their favorite studies have suffered no banishment, as by the Church in early Christian times. They hold a less exclusive place only by reason of a natural, inevitable, and mainly just appreciation of new subjects already an integral part of our modern civilization. We may remind classical proponents, too, that in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries Hebrew divided with the classics the attention even of secondary schools, and that Hebrew, long ago restricted to theological training, has through its literature continued to influence the life of modern peoples. It is not for one of us to mark out the course which the classics should follow in these perilous times. Yet their situation is by no means hopeless. If they are elective in school and college, they have still the same opportunity as most other subjects. If they cannot always be begun in the secondary school, they may be taken up with even greater hope of success by the maturer students of college years. If, in this age of mergers, college Greek and Latin are to be commonly combined under a single head, they are nearer akin than French and German, which were often so combined a half century ago. If their literatures are valuable to the modern man for their ideas, as we believe they are, those ideas may be obtained, as Shakespeare obtained most of his, through translations. If our youth are not to give years of labor to the acquisition of linguistic forms, with occasional appreciation of style in remoter tongues, they may still study the influence of the ancient upon the modern world, through a broader acquaintance than classical instructors have usually encouraged with ancient law and philosophy, ancient art and archeology.</page><page sequence="18">PROCEEDINGS FOR 1923 lxxiii Nor is it for the modern language instructor to touch the delicate question of method in classical instruction. Progress has been made since Swift's time, or since the young Gibbon, "at the expense of many tears and some blood," as he tells us, "purchased the knowledge of the Latin syntax." Progress has been made in the last hundred years, for a student of Phillips Academy, Andover, in the late twenties of the nineteenth century, records that his first six weeks were spent in memorizing the Latin grammar. He came to enjoy his classics and read them frequently as long as he lived, but he characterized that early task as one of the "most dis- agreeable" of his whole life.4 In what unaccountable way, by what extraordinary reversion, had the simple and natural method of Ascham, teacher of the great Elizabeth, been so completely forgotten! Perhaps a new and more favorable approach to classical Latin might be made by the English beginner, as through French. In such case French, the medium through which most Latin words have reached English, would become a con- most Latin words reached English, would become a con- venient bridge over which the youthful student might more readily pass to the remoter shores. No teacher of a modern language would think of proposing that the most ancient form should be studied as the basis for learning the more modern. Possibly a new and more ready approach to the Roman world might be made through medieval Latin, so immensely important to the modern student in many newer fields. The schoolboy could be inducted into medieval Latin more readily than into that of the remoter classical age, both because of its greater simplicity of structure, and the more direct appeal of its ideas. When Macaulay wished to learn German, he began with the German Bible on the ground that, as he knew the substance, he could more easily acquire the new form. Students now read Old English translations of the Scriptures without any special knowledge of the grammar of that remoter period. Could not the I My father's experience, as he set it down in a brief biography for his children.</page><page sequence="19">lxxiv MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION Vulgate version of the Bible be similarly used even with schoolboys? But the problem is not ours. Only the goal is one which we would see successfully reached. We wish the classics, notwithstanding the changed conditions of modern life. We wish primarily a reading knowledge of Latin, as distin- guished from an exhaustive attention to form and structure, and we wish that reading power without its absorbing too many years of the student's life. We believe in the intel- lectual training derived from the study of the classics, without at all believing that such intellectual training can be obtained through them alone. We believe in such emphasis of style in expression as makes a pleasing carrier of thought and feeling, without for a moment believing that such a style can be obtained only by sonme fragmentary study of a few Greek and Roman masterpieces. We are grateful for all our ac- quaintance with the ancient tongues, without perhaps believ- ing that only through them can the modern languages and literatures be appreciated. But I must hasten to a close. The circumstances which Swift figured as the Battle of the Books we more accurately apprehend as an evolutionary change, natural and necessary in the process of the suns. Instruction in the schools, which was almost exclusively classical in Swift's time, has been enriched by inclusion of the sciences, history, and other modern subjects to an extent undreamed of at the beginning of the eighteenth century. The modern languages, partaking of the spirit and lifeblood of the modern nations, have come to their new position by a gradual and modest following upon the new civilizations which have developed through the modern ages. The new wine of the modern literatures has found, and must continue to find, newer and more appropriate containers than the ancient wine skins. Hence- forth the new subjects, and especially the languages and literatures of the new races, must hold place, and perhaps continue to take precedence over the languages and literatures of the remote past. Finally, this extraordinary change, as we now more clearly</page><page sequence="20">PROCEEDINGS FOR 1923 lxxv see it in the light of Swift's satire, places upon the modern language instructor a grave responsibility, as it offers him an opportunity unsurpassed. The responsibility is clear if the majority of our students have not received, or are not to receive, the severer training in the ancient tongues. The responsibility is grave, since the new condition places upon us the burden of an improved instruction in school and college, that it may more nearly approach those ideals which we cherish, and into which we wish to see present actualities more nearly transformed. But if the responsibility is great, the opportunity within our grasp is also matchless. Never before, in the history of English education, has there been such an appreciation of the modern tongue and its literature. Never before has there been a more cordial acceptance of the modern foreign languages as open doors to the culture and attainment of peoples with whom we are, and should be, united in fraternal bonds. To make no mention of remoter fields, which will eventually require greater attention, twelve centuries of English literature, ten or eleven of French and German, six or seven of Italian and Spanish are before us for cultiva- tion, for investigation, for interpretation, for presentation in our age and handing on to the next with some fewer problems and perplexities than had come down to us. More- over, the modern languages have brought to their new station no heritage of hate such as battle inevitably produces. They bear no malice toward the ancient studies, but with cordial sympathy would encourage a rapid adjustment to altered conditions; a quiet abandonment of unwarranted claims, and of that condescension which has sometimes disturbed friendly relations; a dispassionate reasoning to- gether in controversial matters; and an onward movement, hand in hand, toward a better education, and the better civilization it will help to bring.</page></plain_text>
