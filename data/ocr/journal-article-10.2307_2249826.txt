<plain_text><page sequence="1">II.-MUST EMPIRICISM BE LIMITED ? BY F. C. S. SCHILLER. IF a dispassionate intelligence could be found, and induced to contemplate the ways of philosophers with the icy eye of pure reason, it would encounter no more intriguing problem than that of explaining the universal and well-nigh invincible reluctance of philosophers to trust experience and to accept it, without prejudice and arriere pensee, at its face-value. For nothing is more difficult to find among the endless varieties of philosophic opinion- than a whole-hearted and thorough-going empiricism. Some pragmatists may be able to make good their claim to this status, but for the most part even the most empirically minded, after the fairest promises and the profusest professions, are con- stantly to be caught backsliding, and are often found to end up in the shabbiest or most fantastic apriorism, or in a wanton and impotent scepticism. Somehow it seems to afford philosophers so much secret satisfaction to arrive at the merely negative con- clusion that not all knowledge comes from experience, that they care little whether its origin is more plausibly to be derived from the Deity or the Devil. I. These reflections occurred to me very forcibly as I read the brilliant paper on the Limits of Empiricism which Lord Russell read to the Aristotelian Society last April. I was the more impressed because Lord Russell is among the most courageous and clear-headed of philosophers, who has long been known for his sympathy with empiricism and almost every other philosophic heresy, who has striven most unceasingly to achieve the ideals of pure disinterested intellect and perfect exactitude, and has most relentlessly dissected out the weaknesses of man's passion- prompted soul. Moreover, he has nobly preferred being under- stood to being marvelled at, and has usually scorned to enfold himself in the mists of technical verbiage. 20</page><page sequence="2">298 F. C. S. SCHILLER: Accordingly it is no trivial thing when a man of such eminence sets himself to determine the limits of possible experience, and it is well worth while to trace the process by which he has persuaded himself that pure empiricism is untenable. Let me begin by quoting his conclusion (pp. 148-149): " We all in fact are unshakeably convinced that we know things which pure empiricism would deny that we can know. We must accordingly seek a theory of knowledge other than pure empiricism. . . . We have found reason to believe (1) That if any verbal knowledge can be known to be in any sense derived from sense experience, we must be able, sometimes, to 'see' a relation, analogous to causation, between two parts of one specious present. " (2) That facts about universals can sometimes be perceived when the universals are exemplified in sensible occurrences; for example, that ' preceding ' is transitive, and that blue is more like green than yellow. " (3) That we can understand a form of words, and know that it expresses either a truth or a falsehood, even when we know of no method of deciding the alternative. " (4) That physics requires the possibility of inferring, at least with probability, occurrences which have not been observed, and, more particularly, future occurrences. " Without these principles, what is ordinarily regarded as em- pirical knowledge becomes impossible. " It is not necessary to maintain that we can arrive at knowledge in advance of experience, but rather that experience gives more information than pure empiricism supposes.") II. Lord Russell leads up to these conclusions by accepting from an anonymous contributor to the Encyclopedlia Britannica the definition that " empiricism is the theory that all knowledge is derived from sense experience ", and proceeds that " three ques- tions arise before we can discuss whether empiricism is true or false " (p. 131). It should here at once be noted that this definition restricts experience to sense experience, and that Lord Russell does not define what he means by ' pure ' empiricism, but leaves it vague. Nor does he explain in what sense he uses ' true' and ' false '. Apparently in the sense assumed by the 'law' of Excluded Middle, i.e., as excluding the possibility of the meaningless. He assumes, moreover, that the meaning, truth, and falsity of a</page><page sequence="3">MUST EMPIRICISM BE LIMITED ? 299 "form of words " can be ascertained without knowledge of their context and use (p. 133). I think also, but cannot be sure, that he assumes ' true ' and ' false ' to be ' absolute ' for the purposes of his argument. At any rate he takes them to be unambiguous; for his subsequent argument would go to pieces if he admitted that ' true ' and ' false ' were relative to a context and a purpose. Lord Russell then declares: " we must ask what is meant by 'knowledge what by ' derived from ', and what by ' sense experience'". Of 'knowledge' he says " there is no accepted definition ". He might have added that what is to be meant by 'knowledge' is precisely the cardinal dispute of the various schools of epistemology. 'Derived from' Lord Russell thinks " may be interpreted either logically or causally." I should like to add, " whatever logically and causally may mean ". And the possibility of psy- chological and biological interpretations should not be overlooked. " The words sense experience ", we are further told, "are capable of either a wide or a narrow interpretation." But whichever is chosen, an important question is begged. For experience is restricted to sense experience, and sense experience is assumed to be a-process to be adequately observed by an external observer. What difference the experiencer makes to the experience is thereby ruled out of court-by the way the question is put. Thus every voluntarist or personalist inter- pretation of experience is excluded ab initio. Whether this ex- clusion is in Lord Russell's case intentional, is not clear, but its consequences will be found to be far-reaching at every stage of the subsequent inquiry. III. In the first place it justifies Lord Russell in starting from the familiar question of academic debate " what are sense-data, and what is the knowledge most immediately dependent upon them ? This leads at once to the question: how is this knowledge de- pendent upon these data ? When these questions have been decided, we can go on to inquire whether there is any other know- ledge, and, if so, what reason there is for believing it." Now if the standpoint of the external observer had not been begged (as shown above), the answer to these questions would be easy. Sense-data are fictions of a highly sophisticated philo- sophic 'analysis ', for which there is no psychological warrant and for which the practical man has no need. No one therefore has any cogent " reason to believe " in them. It may be that</page><page sequence="4">300 F. C. S. SCHILLER: for certain technical purposes of certain sects of philosophy they are convenient for the purpose of avoiding other simpler explana- tions; but they are to be reached only by devious and dubious ways. At any rate, one may make bold to say that neither the common man nor the practical man nor the scientist has any need to 'analyse' his experience in terms of sense-data. What they all require, and assume, is perception of things, and of states of themselves, in the light not only of their own past, but also that of their ancestors; they all, moreover, believe themselves to be amply justified in their beliefs, which indeed are part of the great pragmatic interpretation of experience, in which we are all educated, and by which we all live. The first things therefore an accurate account of knowing should " eliminate as irrelevant " (p. 132) are the philosophic notion of sense-data, and the attendant abstraction from the antecedents, context and setting of the " sensible occurrence ". It amazes me that Lord Russell should not have realized this, for his whole account (pp. 132-133) of the way in which our " sensible facts " " depend upon our interests and past history " is excellent, and vastly superior to the traditional epistemologies. I should merely like to add to the remark that knowing is noticing (p. 133) that noticing is always selecting, and that selections are always optional and risky. Thus the volitional side of knowing will not down. IV. At this point Lord Russell discovers a "logical difficulty". Our most immediate knowledge depends, not only on the ' sensible fact' but also on our own past history. But how can we know " at the very beginning of empirical knowledge" "about the effect of the past upon ourselves" ? This would appear to be in essence the old Greek puzzle about the origin of knowledge out of previous knowledge, which led Plato to postulate the pre-existence of the soul. A less romantic philosopher, however, might be tempted to ask: Why should not our past affect our knowing without our knowing it ? Why should we not gradually discover, from experience, how much our past has, for good or evil, moulded our knowing ? And why should we gratuitously commit ourselves to an unexperienceable fiction of a " very beginning of empirical knowledge" ? The very notion seems to arise from a confusion between psychological and logical analysis.</page><page sequence="5">MUST EMPIRICISM BE LIMITED ? 301 V. Lord Russell, however, prefers to infer that there must exist a " primitive non-verbal sense-knowledge " as a logically neces- sary basis for other empirical knowledge. He admits, however, (p. 134) that it is as yet logically useless, and must be made verb- ally communicable. He points out that "there are causal relations'between words and what they mean: a cat causes the word 'cat ', and the word 'cat ' causes expectation of a cat, or perhaps the actual sight of one. Moreover, these causal relations can sometimes be perceived, and he defies any empiricist to deny that " I say ' there is a cat ' because a cat (or a sensible appearance resembling that of a cat) is there " (p. 136). This 'because ' " seems to take me beyond what an empiricist ought to know. The word ' because ' must be taken as expressing a relation which is, at least partly, that of cause and effect " (ibid.). I have been particularly interested by this doctrine. For I have been puzzled for many years to understand how Lord Russell managed to combine acceptance of Hume's criticism of causation as necessary connexion, with his continued references to some sort of causal relation. The present paper plainly proves that he does hold both the doctrine that the necessary connexion between events is not a fact of observation, and that nevertheless "the word 'because'... must be understood as expressing a more or less causal relation and that this relation must be per- ceived, not merely inferred from frequent concomitance. ' Cause ' accordingly must mean something other than ' invariable ante- cedent ', and the relation of causation, or some relation intimately connected with it, must be one which can sometimes be perceived " -(why not always ?) (p. 137). Nay more: " problems connected with language are absent in some instances in which the same relation can be perceived, e.g., if I am hurt and cry out. We seem, here, to perceive indubitably a connexion between the pain and the cry" (ibid). Lord Russell will not indeed say "without qualification, that we must be able to perceive ' causal 'relations " but only that sometimes he " can perceive some relation having an intimate connexion with that of cause and effect " (p. 137 s.f.). I confess, however, that perceived causal relations of any sort seem to me a plain repudiation of Hume's cardinal doctrine, and that I can make nothing of " a more- or less causal relation " (p. 137, cf. pp. 146, 147). If it existed, it should, I suppose, admit of quantitative treatment, and would provide a great opening for a new calculus to determine whether a ' relation ' was 50 per cent. 'causal' or only 25 per cent. As for relations which</page><page sequence="6">302 F. C. S. SCHILLER: are " analogous to causation " (pp. 149, 148) one would like to see the analogy drawn out. At the same time Lord Russell's attitude is thoroughly charac- teristic of the ordinary empiricist's treatment of Hume. He professes the greatest enthusiasm for the reduction of the necessary connexion of causes to regular sequences, and then goes on talking about the causal laws of the special sciences exactly like his- unregenerate metaphysical brethren. Nor does he stint himself in the use of the causal implications of ordinary speech. Hence his 'empiricism ' here reaches one of its limits, simply because he refuses to follow Hume, and ceases to be an empiricist at all in the sense he originally claimed. The reason for this de'bacle probably is that the metaphysicians, the Humians, and the scientific 'empiricists' all get into the same difficulty at this point. They have all begun by making the same unjustified abstraction. They have all assumed (un- critically) that the crude, immediate, personal experience of voluntary action cannot possibly have anything to do with the scientific conception of causality. But the anthropomorphic assumption of the conformity of nature with human nature is much more deeply rooted both in language and in scientific method than they had realized.' VI. Lord Russell's next difficulty is that of " justifying inferences from facts to facts " (p. 138). He quotes Wittgenstein's account of atomic facts independent of one another: " from the existence or non-existence of an atomic fact we cannot infer the existence or non-existence of another. The events of the future cannot be inferred from those of the present. Superstition is the belief in the causal nexus." Lord Russell admits that this (authentically Humian) doctrine paralyses 'valid inference', reduces (deductive) reasoning to tautology, and " sweeps away all inferences that have any practical utility." But he refrains from inferring that there must be some deep-seated error in the premisses that lead to such conclusions, and contents himself with demanding immediate perception 1 Hume alone saw the relevance of this experience to the 'causal' problem, and argued against its admission, in the Enquiry, with his usual ingenuity. (See Humanism, ch. xvi.) The question is ultimately whether philosophy and science are restricted to the standpoint of the external observer, or may also take into consideration that of the experiencer and the agent.</page><page sequence="7">MUST EMPIRICISM BE LIMITED ? 303 of relations of transitiveness and asymmetry (p. 140). He does not envisage the possibilities that a thoroughly empiricist logic would support Hume by dropping the traditional notion of for- mally valid inference, by regarding the truth of all inferences as hypothetical and experimental, and by accepting verification by experience as the only possible and actual, though never formal, validation.1 VII. At first sight Lord Russell is on safer ground when he argues (p. 140) that " it is possible to perceive facts about universals also in many other ways. In looking at rainbows, we can perceive that blue and green are more similar than blue and yellow. ... These things are known empirically in one sense, but not in another. Take the case of blue, green, and yellow. It is only through sense that we know green to be between blue and yellow: when we see all these colours simultaneously, we can also see their resemblances and differences, and we can see that these are properties of the shades, not of the particulars." Hence "attention to the facts of sense can give rise to general knowledge ". But surely a thorough empiricist would here be entitled to point out that Lord Russell has greatly simplified the complicated facts of colour-vision. The terms 'blue, ' green', and 'yellow' are only rough, though practically convenient, references to an indefinite mass of colour-hues, shades and chromas, which pass imperceptibly into each other, and vary enormously according to the illumination in which they are viewed, and the backgrounds and areas on which they appear. Also empirically endless anom- alies are to be found in the colour-vision of individuals. Also colour-vision has in all probability evolved somewhat recently, and may be developing further. Under these circumstances would it not require altogether unreasonable confidence in a priori (i.e., verbal) argument to expect nature to confirm all our expectations about abstract ' blue ', 'green ', and ' yellow' ? I can well imagine, therefore, that a deep shade of (indigo) 1 There is of course a formally invalid begging of the question in the reasoning on p. 138 that " within one specious present we perceive that A precedes B, and within another specious present we perceive that B precedes C." This is 'self-evident' only as an abstract formula. In any actual use the identity of the two B's involves a hypothesis and a risk. Lord Russell here encounters Alfred Sidgwick's objection to the ' validity ' of the syllogistic form, owing to the liability to ambiguity of any middle term.</page><page sequence="8">304 F. C. S. SCHILLER: 'blue ' in a yellow light will look much less like a yellowish ' green ' than a pale shade of ' blue ' looks like a pale shade of 'yellow ' in a rosy light. In short, the freaks of colour-vision render it a subject eminently unsuited for a priori argument. VIII. Lord Russell next considers the sort of empiricism which has sprung up in modern mathematics to cope with the paradoxes of the ' infinite ', and is known as ' finitism ', and refers to Miss Ambrose's two recent articles in MIND (vol. xliv.). Here it might be prudent, and would be sufficient, for a layman in mathe- matics to content himself with remarking that there are at present extant no less than three incompatible interpretations of the philosophic basis of the mathematical sciences, of which Lord Russell's is one, and that the present Paper seems to exhibit him as retreating before ' finitism '. His arguments against finitism, moreover, seem to rest on the indeterminateness of typically old-fashioned senses of 'true ' and ' false ', and on the ambiguity of ' certain ' (logical or psycholo- logical ?). Lord Russell adduces ' it rained in London on January 1, 1066 '. This is, so far, only the formal truth-claim of a con- textless 'proposition ' about an historical event; it has no mean- ing nor value (truth or falsity) as it stands. It could become a true judgment only if some one interested in the matter found records that would satisfy expert historians that it did rain then and' there. But if in a proper context its truth were alleged and accepted, the truth of this judgment would differ in kind from the 'truth ' of the 'proposition'. It would no longer be a mere unsupported truth-claim, but would possess, like all historical 'truths', a higher or lower degree of probability depending on the value of the evidence supporting it. It could never lay\ claim to absolute or unconditional truth. There follow a number of abstract propositions about 'integers greater than any yet mentioned ', to which it seems hard to im- agine any actual context (p. 142). Lord Russell does not yet seem to have realized that for a ' proposition ' to acquire any actual meaning it must be given relevance to some actual problem, and that until this has been done, it has neither truth nor falsity, simply because the question of meaning takes precedence over that, of cognitive value (positive or negative). If the ' finitist ' he is arguing against were also enough of a humanist to conceive the number-system as a tool for human purposes of calculation, he could easily dispose of all Lord Russell's puzzles by pointing</page><page sequence="9">MUST EMPIRICISM BE LIMITED ? 305 out that numbers were always formed for a purpose, and that the 'infinity' of number merely meant that it was possible to form numbers large enough for any purpose, once the ' law ' of the formation of numbers had been formulated. In disputing Miss Ambrose's remark that it is logically im- possible to run through the whole expansion of r, Lord Russell retorts that it is medically impossible (p. 143). But why should it not be both, and psychologically impossible to boot ? The -alter- natives are not exclusive. Anyhow Lord Russell's postulation of an omniscient Deity to reveal the whole truth to a mathe- matical Moses reads somewhat queerly when one remembers Lord Russell's former contributions to theology. Presumably he meant that his 'mathematical Moses', who believed the whole expansion of ir had been revealed to him by God, would surely be confined in a lunatic asylum ! But I do not see why the finitist should not agree that obstinate persistence in a claim to have had a revelation about the ' exact ' value of Xr would in all probability land its asserter in an asylum. Lord Russell finally admits (pp. 144-145) that " outside mathe- matics, we do not know with any certainty whether classes are finite or infinite, except in a few cases. And even when we think we know, it is no great help." For " on finitist principles, the form of words ' all men are mortal ', is outside the scope of the Law of Excluded Middle. For my part, I hold that, as soon as I know what is meant by ' men ' and what by ' mortal ', I know what is meant by ' all men are mortal ', and I know quite cer- tainly that either this statement is true, or some man is immortal " (p. 145). I devoutly hope that this date, when Lord Russell shall have discovered (presumably by revelation rather than experi- ence !) all the meanings, past, present, and to come of 'men ' and ' mortal ' will speedily arrive, and that he will then promptly divulge them; but until he does, I see no reason for receding from the contention in my article in MIND for April, 1935, that a thorough empiricist can involve both the meaning of ' man ' and that of 'mortal', and the 'proof ' of man's universal mor- tality, in no slight perplexity. Finitism is finally rejected, because it rests on " an untenable general principle that what cannot be proved or disproved is neither true nor false ". To which the reply is that what cannot be proved or disproved is scientifically meaningless, and that it is misleading to discuss the very ambiguous terms 'true ' and 'false' without distinguishing between the potential 'truth' of a formal truth-claim and the tested truth of an actual allega- tion. Also it would seem that finitists would not admit that they</page><page sequence="10">306 F. C. S. SCHILLER: cannot give empirically sufficient and empirically verifiable accounts of mathematical 'induction ', and of the genesis of the natural members. Ix. Upon the important question whether modern science is not becoming wholly empirical, Lord Russell bestows comparatively little space. He merely quotes a passage from Prof. Dirac's Quantum Mechanics, and declares it to be incompatible with thorough-going empiricism. "A great deal' is assumed that cannot be observed, and cannot be inferred from what is observed, unless forms of inference are admitted which pure empiricism must reject " (p. 146). Presumably Lord Russell means that hypotheses and their verifications never lead to valid 'proof ', which can never be improved upon; but is not this empirical fact the very reason for the progressiveness of science ? Lord Russell then points out a number of scientific assumptions which he regards as incompatible with pure empiricism. First, the reliance on memory. This is an excellent example-for the empiricists. For we are pragmatically compelled to go on trust- ing our memory, even though we are constantly finding out, by experience, how little it deserves our trust. But why should not the empiricist be content to recognize the facts, to take all possible precautions, and to hope for the best ? What more could all the metaphysics in the histories of philosophy enable him to do ? It is no help to him to construe the trustworthiness of memoxy as a trans-empirical principle. Secondly, the same is true of the trustworthiness of testimony: a liar's evidence does not become more truthful because it is given on oath. Thirdly, similarly, prediction of the future is in constant use, and is empirically found to be possible and valuable, even though it is not absolutely certain, and it does not require us to feel it so. The thorough empiricist in short has recognized that scientific principles are probably all methodological, and that the progress of science does not require them to be more. Also that they are all elastic and adaptable, and can be changed to fit our growing knowledge. X. There is no reason, then, to think that Lord Russell has shown a radical and thorough empiricism to be untenable. Or, at most, we may say, he has shown this only if 'experience' is limited,</page><page sequence="11">MUST EMPIRICISM BE LIMITED ? 307 by definition, to sense-experience. But this limitation seems arbitrary. It really raises the question whether all experience is to be squeezed into what some philosophers call 'sense- experience'. The practical man and the thorough empiricist will both be hard to persuade of this; and I can see many and good reasons for agreeing with them. For when we set out to consult experience, we have no business to impose a priori limita- tions on what shall count as such. It is the experience of the whole man, as it comes to him, that counts, and not a doctored selection that some philosophic analysis has distilled from 'the senses ' and fabricated from 'sense-data '. The distinction between unprejudiced psychological observation of the actual processes and their ex post facto interpretation in terms of philo- sophic theory, should be carefully maintained. If this were doxie, there would be little left to support the sensationalistic and intellectualistic assumptions which form the a priori of so much traditional naturalism. XI. But we have yet to face the two fundamental objections to any complete empiricism which render it so repugnant to philo- sophic- minds. The first of these raises the ostensibly logical question of what is to be accepted as the empirical validation of a hypothesis. Is it enough that we should wait and see till it actually comes true ? Or must we always demand in addition reasons to expect it, and demonstrations that will prove it ab- solutely true ? I take it that a true empiricist would be content to wait and see, whereas the apriorist and the weak-kneed em- piricist crave for some further assurance of some sort. The former's position will then be that he claims the right to for- mulate any hypothesis that his past experience suggests to him, and is willing to let the course of events determine his estimate of its value. If the predictions drawn from the 'hypothesis' persistently come true, his confidence in its 'truth' will grow until it reaches complete psychological certainty; if not, he will modify his hypothesis (unless it is a vitally important postulate) or substitute others, until the consequences observed are in good agreement with those expected. He will also realize that he need not conceive his hypotheses as ultimate facts, but is entitled to assume any principle provisionally, experimentally, or methodo- logically; and that most, if not all, the scientific principles in actual use may be taken as methodological. That is, they are</page><page sequence="12">308 F. C. S. SCHILLER: primarily assumptions for reaching results not otherwise attain- able, or not so easily attainable. Often this methodological function is their primary or only significance. For example, the assumption of a predictable, or more or less determinate, sequence of events is needed, if we desire to foresee the future and to prepare for it; but it is unnecessary and superfluous to take 'determinism' as more than this, say as a universal 'law' of nature. Moreover, the use of the determinist principle does not necessitate belief in its truth: its use for the sake of pre- diction is unavoidable, even though we need not believe that it exactly applies to the case in hand. It is enough that we should be willing to try it for what it is worth, and thereby get better results than if we had not attempted any prediction at all. The true empiricist, then, is one who is willing to test his beliefs by their consequences, and to abide by their results. That is, he is willing to accept consequences as having logical value, and to permit them to validate beliefs. xlI. Undoubtedlv, however, to many minds the suggestion of such empiricism would be unpalatable and indigestible. To convince them that they stand to gain nothing by their recalcitrance, we may begin by raising anew Hume's uncannily penetrating ques- tion: why should the future resemble the past ? Like all Hume's posers this is a psychological as well as a logical question, and has practical as well as 'theoretic ' bearings. But thorough empiricism would admit it to be a good question. It squarely raises the issue whether it is possible to extract from the past any absolute guarantees for the course of the future, and the growth of knowledge is rendering it more and more difficult to answer it in accordance with anti-empiricist prejudices. As a matter of fact, science has revealed a number of features about our world which should make it decidedly uncomfortable for a priori philosophers. (1) Despite the reign of natural ' law ', the world somehow manages to generate unpredictable novelties, the ' accidental variations'v of Darwinism. (2) There is no proof that the ' laws ' of nature are immutable. They may shrewdly be suspected of being only the inveterate habits of things, and the laws in actual use are hardly even that: they are merely con- venient formulas for predicting the course of events which are constantly being altered and improved upon. (3) As the real is not static but changes ('evolves') and nobody can say where the limits of the possible are laid down, no argument resting on</page><page sequence="13">MUST EMPIRICISM BE LIMITED ? 309 the present order of things can be absolutely cogent. The truth of its conclusion is relative to that of its premisses, and at best the latter are true only so far as we can tell up to the present. Hence (4) a 'logical impossibility ' exists only rebus sic stantibus, for minds like ours, arguing from the 'kmowledge' we have, making our traditional postulates, and using terms in their current senses. If any of these conditions are departed from, the former logical impossibility may well decline into a psychological 'impossibility' which was only an illusion. Hence innate ideas, and arguments based on the finality of a priori principles 'a la Kant, are helpless in face of suggestionfs that the human mind may continue to evolve and may thereby invalidate reasonings based only on our present 'necessities of thought'. (5) Quite apart from such anticipations there would seem to be lurking, even in the stabilized order of experience, plenty of opportunities for catastrophes which have never yet come to pass, but are never- theless not beyond the bounds of possible experience. Can we argue, for example, that the earth will never be destroyed by the sun's collision with another star, because it never has been yet ? This reasoning remarkably resembles the principle of scientific 'induction' as it is often formulated; yet would it not be the height of fatuity to hope to ward off such a cosmic catastrophe by dialectical reasoning based on the meanings words have acquired from experience up to date ? We seem to have, then, no means of guaranteeing that the future we desire will be made secure by any scientific reasoning. All our ' knowledge 'is but conditional and more or less probable, and its 'principles' rest upon hopes and postulates. The factor of doubt, contingency, and probability is not to be eradicated from the course of experience by any amount either of dogmatism or of past experience. But is this any reason why we should cower under this uncertainty, and delude ourselves that, because we shrink from it, it does not exist ? Is not the proper attitude, alike of the true man and of the true empiricist, to make every preparation he can, undauntedly to meet the dangers and un- certainties of the future, and to keep on readjusting his actions while the items of experience gradually accrue ? A truly radical empiricism, therefore, will face even an incalculable future without seeking to limit and ward off its risks by the vain incantations of an a priori verbalism.</page></plain_text>
