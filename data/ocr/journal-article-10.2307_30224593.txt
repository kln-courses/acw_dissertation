<plain_text><page sequence="1">(M)Othering the Nation: Guilt, Sexuality and the Commercial State in Coleridge's Gothic Poetry Robbie B. H. Goh In an intriguing, if cryptic, notebook entry of 1799, Samuel Taylor Co- leridge speaks of "Commerce and its Effects disguised as a Fairy Tale" (CPW, I: 616). It is not clear if he is referring to the spell which commerce and its commodities are supposed to exert on human participants, although he does say in the poem "Religious Musings" that commercial man is "Toy-bewitched,/ Made blind by lusts" (CPW I: 114), while in the Lay Sermon he uses the term the "sorcery of wealth" to describe the domi- nance of commerce over all other aspects of human life (199). This quality of enchantment attributed to commerce, would also seem to fit into Co- leridge's poetics, what in the Biographia Literaria is described as that "magical power to which we have exclusively appropriated the name of imagination" (II: 16). His own poem "Christabel" accords with this defin- ition, as a "supernatural" poem that "pretended to be nothing more than a common Faery Tale" (CPW, II: 6-7, 238). Magical narratives which also convey some essential truth about the (in its own way magical) power of commercial relations, would go some way to relate the "world-historical" Coleridge (Shaffer 56, 101), who, as Storch puts it, "marshals all the resources of the mind, including the imag- ination, towards an understanding of the human condition in historical terms" (449), with the poet of a "querulous egotism" (Watson 51) whose JNT.

Copyright C 2003 by JNT: Journal of Narrative Theory.</page><page sequence="2">(M)Othering the Nation 271 "introverted" poetry expresses, in Butler's terms, the "elevation of the self's truth" (83). The Biographia maintained that the magical power of the imagination could rescue "the most admitted truths from ... impo- tence" by producing "the strongest impressions of novelty" (I: 82), thus establishing the basis of a poetics which was also a politics of the com- mercial state. Coleridge's various and rather desultory prose comments on the evils of England's economic condition, in writings like The Watchman, his essays for the Morning Post, the Lay Sermons and elsewhere, form a backdrop for the gothic romance which emerges in the poetry-a romance in which the anxieties of the commercial state are played out in the psy- cho-sexual terms of desire, repression, alterity and regression. Not inci- dentally, this pairing of commerce and the miraculous tale bears more than passing resemblance to William Godwin's account of the relationship be- tween his gothic novels and his political ideas: in his preface to his 1805 novel Fleetwood, Godwin describes the "miraculous" and "surprising" el- ements in his novels as a reinforcement of the politics of his Political Jus- tice, both kinds of discourse working in different ways "to effect a grand and comprehensive improvement in the sentiments" of men in society (xvi). Clemit insists that the Godwinian novel is a "consciously political form" intended to oppose the values of "aristocratic culture" (14); she thus passes a considerable part of the political burden from Godwin's explicit treatise Political Justice (which in any case undergoes a series of revisions and retractions), to the novels' literary mechanism and their sentimental influence. Godwin's profound but problematic influence on Coleridge is evident from as early in the latter's career as the 1795 Bristol lectures, and Coleridge's gothic project both derives from and distinguishes itself from Godwin's attempt to depict "things as they are" in the fantastical form of the gothic novel. This literary project can thus be seen in terms of the "channeling" of "desiring production," the "coding" and "decoding of flows" of eco- nomic and political desires, which Deleuze and Guattari (9-10, 240) at- tribute to the capitalist state. In this formulation, the gothic, with its neu- rotic sensualization of the affairs of the state, its imagination of the perverse psycho-sexual drama of power, is a prime example of such lit- erary codes, "so true is it that the schizo practices political economy, and that all sexuality is a matter of economy" (12). In the case of Coleridge, poetry is a means of articulating a sentimental response to the evils and</page><page sequence="3">272 T sufferings which, in his view, were caused by opportunistic commerce in the form of (among other things) Britain's trade in African slaves, the gulf between rich and poor, wars of commerce and the like. Yet this leads to a form of writing in which the problems of desire and transgres- sion are displaced from politics to poetics, from power to sexuality. Morton observes that even in the seemingly more direct narrative con- ventions of the Bristol Lectures and the Watchman, Coleridge deals with the complexly-interwoven issues of slavery, commercial greed and British middle-class complicity, in a rhetoric (whose chief image is the consumption of West Indian sugar) which "works in multiple directions simultaneously, establishing a bizarre, contradictory reciprocity between the consumed and the consumer" (91)-thus, a form of dietary displace- ment, in which the political economy of the guilty commodity gets played out, not in a direct political manner, but as a trope of orality and the body. This form of gothic poetics might thus be seen as a project which, as Deleuze and Guattari might put it, "liberates the flows of de- sire" (139), by taking it from the place where it poses conflicts (with sentimental and moral views of society), and re-presenting it in unlikely and provocative ways. In so doing, Coleridge's poetic persona becomes split, other even to himself; on the one hand, a social prophet and ascetic who laments the greed of society, and on the other hand a visionary whose dreams re-position social conflicts as sexualized tensions. Coleridge's writings oppose the divisive and oppressive power of the commercial state, with a vision of communal bonds and social affections closely associated with a pre-commercial condition of nature, the rural retreat, and the domestic scene. Not surprisingly in an age of mercan- tilist voyages, for Coleridge the prime symbol of the divisiveness of commerce was the sea. In a poem like "Dura Navis" (1787), which ad- vocates domestic contentment instead of ambition, the "dangerous deep" is an allegory for the "venturous" life in quest of delusory wealth (CPW I: 2-3). In this allegory, such a life is doomed by uncertainties and vicis- situdes, much as the sea is governed by the "Storm's impending rage"; at the same time, the sea also symbolizes the uncontrollable desires within the self, the storms within when "to the Clouds the Waves ambitious rise." A similar analogy obtains in "A Lover's Complaint to His Mis- tress" (1792); as the full title explains, the mistress is leaving her lover "in quest of a more wealthy husband in the East Indies" (CPW I: 36).</page><page sequence="4">(M)Othering the Nation 273 She is thus a version of the merchants and other adventurers-at-sea, who spurn domestic contentment in favor of risky wealth. At the same time, she is herself (in her relationship with the hapless lover) an embodiment of the treacherous power of wealth and the sea: "The winds may learn your own delusive art,/And faithless Ocean smile-but to deceive" (CPW, I: 37). More than just a symbol of the fickleness of fortune or women (or for- tune personified as a woman), the sea is also an actual site of commercial divisions and conflicts. The image of "the horrors of a Naval Fight" ("Dura Navis" CPW, I: 3) returns in a number of poems as testament to the violence occasioned by commercial conflicts. Thus in "Religious Mus- ings" (1796), the present state of things is summed up as A sea of blood bestrewed with wrecks, where mad Embattling Interests on each other rush With unhelmed rage! (CPW, I: 113) If this is true of commercial competition between nations, it is also true of the individual, who "roams" as "a sordid solitary thing." Isolation is the concluding fate of commercial man, either as a result of the attrition and violence that accompanies various forms of commercial activity, or else as a result of the moral repulsion created by viewing such horrors. Both fates are evident in "Monody on the Death of Chatterton" (1794, revised 1796), which mourns the death by suicide of Chatterton, like Coleridge a charity student at Christ's Hospital. This similarity in circumstances no doubt helps explain what Dekker calls the speaker's "suicidal identification with his subject" (64), which is manifested in his participation as emotionally- involved spectator in Chatterton's familial drama: Thy Sister's shrieks she bade thee hear, And mark thy Mother's thrilling tear; See, see her breast's convulsive throe, Her silent agony of woe! Ah! Dash the poison'd chalice from thy hand! (CPW, I: 129) Chatterton is a victim of England's unjust and uncharitable laws of prop- erty, the "coward Wealth and Guilt in robes of State" which are responsi-</page><page sequence="5">274 T ble for his bitter want and despair. Yet the speaker too is a victim, if not of Chatterton's physical fate then of his spiritual one: disheartened by this condition of England (the "sore ills" of the nation), torn by the "storm" of emotions (both Chatterton's, and his own sympathetic ones), he proposes to exile himself "Where Susquehannah pours his untamed stream" (CPW 1: 129). The poetics of the gothic, it has been noted by scholars drawing on Bakhtinian theory, constitutes an "interroga[tion] of authoritative truths," a "heteroglossia" whose different parts express "the differentiated socio- ideological position of the author" (Jackson 15; Howard 17). At one level, Coleridge's poetry accomplishes this by mounting a sentimental "effu- sion" (Watson 51) that is at odds with the tyranny of commercial-national ambitions. The emotional pity and terror of the speaker in poems like "Chatterton," "Dura Navis," "Religious Musings" and others, are thus part of a gothic performance of recoil, a display of the "psychological, moral, spiritual, and intellectual energies" which DeLamotte sees as the textual strategy underlying both the gothic and the literature of sensibility (19). Accordingly, the horrifying visions of commercial violence and divisive- ness, are countered by visions of domestic and social affections. This re- sembles Coleridge's nostrum, in his prose writings, for the dangers of po- litical error and civil violence. Thus in the Bristol Lectures of 1795, he maintains that The searcher after Truth must love and be beloved; for gen- eral Benevolence is a necessary motive to constancy of pursuit; and this general Benevolence is begotten and ren- dered permanent by social and domestic affections. Let us beware of that proud Philosophy, which affects to inculcate Philanthropy while it denounces every home-born feeling, by which it is produced and nurtured. (146) In the poetry, "domestic affections" are dramatized as a familial scene where the bonds of love pose a challenge (if ultimately a vain one) to the evils of power and greed. Thus in "Religious Musings," the mad "Embat- tling Interests" are opposed by a vision of the hereafter which combines domestic affections with communal economy:</page><page sequence="6">(M)Othering the Nation 275 ... each heart Self-governed, the vast family of Love Raised from the common earth by common toil Enjoy the equal produce. (CPW, I: 122) Domesticity, hermitic retreat and familial affections draw their force as an unstable, almost desperate antithesis to political authority and commercial greed. Thus in "Fears in Solitude" (1798), the speaker identifies himself as ... a son, a brother, and a friend, A husband, and a father! Who revere All bonds of natural love, and find them all Within the limits of thy rocky shores, O native Britain! (CPW, I: 262) In such poems, the peaceful scene of the nation-family is conjured up as a contrast to the "fierce doings" of the nation's political and economic life: We have drunk up, demure as at a grace, Pollutions from the brimming cup of wealth; Contemptuous of all honourable rule, Yet bartering freedom and the poor man's life For gold, as at a market! ... (CPW, I: 258) The "market" of slavery and oppressive wage-labor is in turn sustained by the patriarchal institutions of "Courts, Committees, Institutions,/Associa- tions and Societies," "Merchant and lawyer, senator and priest." This power brings as its natural consequence, as well as its moral retribution, "carnage" and "war." Leask sees the emphasis on equal agrarian production (in poems such as "Religious Musings") as a "curious combination of Christian spiritual- ity and 'levelling' radicalism" (37); yet the tensions in Coleridge's poetry at this time resist settling into an ideological position, however com- pounded or mixed. One clear sign of the cost of criticism is in the prob- lematic positioning of the self. The speaker's criticism of his nation's op- pressive law is once again a (dis)location of the self; if he can imagine himself as a part of a domestic scene, this is only possible in an imagined national community where familial relations displace commercial ones,</page><page sequence="7">276 T where affections make power and oppression redundant. The realities of the commercial status quo, in contrast, bring the speaker to despair, thoughts of exile, and an emotional and psychological recoil from com- munity. If the idealistic notion of the pantisocratic scheme is no longer ar- ticulated after the "Monody on the Death of Chatterton" (and Coleridge's own falling out with co-schemer Robert Southey), other poems replace this simpler physical retreat with a more complex moral and psychological one. As the title of "Fears in Solitude" indicates, the speaker's critical awareness of society's ills brings with it the condition of isolation from the unthinking masses and motivated elite who perpetuate those ills. The ear- lier part of the poem describes the speaker's entry into this powerful emo- tional state as a kind of projection or ekstasis: My God! It is a melancholy thing For such a man, who would full fain preserve His soul in calmness, yet perforce must feel For all his human brethren-O my God! It weighs upon the heart, that he must think What uproar and what strife may now be stirring This way or that way o'er these silent hills--(CPW, I: 257-258) The subjunctive mood casts the speaker as other to himself ("such a man") in the act of feeling for his "human brethren," even as he is set apart from them by his "melancholy," his critical consciousness. This is figured as a physical disorientation, in which the speaker is torn between this quiet place of contemplation-this "green and silent spot" in which he is physi- cally located-and the various points ("this way or that way") that in his imagination he also occupies. Social criticism thus requires, not merely a removal of the self from the values and ideological positions of society, but a fundamental split be- tween the empathetic self who feels with and for his "human brethren," and the detached self ("His soul in calmness") who is in a position to judge them. The condition of Coleridge's speaker in response to his land and its suffering inhabitants, internalizes (in a disruptive and disturbing way) a struggle like that of the "uncanny Other[ing]" of conquered races by the European within historical colonialism (Fulford and Kitson 6-7): unable to practice a saving "exclusionary distinction" sponsored by racial</page><page sequence="8">(M)Othering the Nation 277 differences, Coleridge's speaker responds to the crisis of his own home in a way which constantly blurs (even as it alternately reinforces) the bound- aries between self and other, individual and society, author and authority. Thus exile is not merely the ploy of moral superiority which enables the speaker to mount his criticism of his country, but also (in the form of imaginative ekstasis, being outside of oneself as a result of powerful emo- tions) the psychological and textual doubleness which comes with such an act. Criticism-itself a narrative act of power, which opposes the status quo with an alternative system of values and concerns-places the speaker at odds with the nation of which he nevertheless remains a member. As Coleridge himself puts it in his analysis of commercial evils, "wickedness may be multiplied, but cannot be divided," and "the guilt of all, attaches to each one who is knowingly an accomplice" (Watchman 138). The result is a dual conception of the self, as simultaneously complicit yet detached, guilty yet disdainfully critical. One of the ways this is manifested is in a sexualized narrative in which transgression is displaced onto patriarchal powers and institutions. Commerce and political power, seen as exclusion- ary and rapacious phenomena, are aligned with the "violent and jealous fa- ther who keeps all the females for himself and drives away his sons" in a recognizably Oedipal structure ("Totem and Taboo" 202). This in turn lo- cates the self as a symbolic participant in this structure, revealed in a highly-charged emotional narrative of jealousy, guilt, voyeurism and hys- teria. The rapacious father emerges in the poetry as a corollary of military, economic and political oppression of the weak and powerless, often fig- ured as women and children. Thus in "Religious Musings," the loss of do- mestic peace and order is marked (among other things) by the "childless widows o'er the groaning land" who "Wail numberless," while "orphans weep for bread!" (CPW I: 115). This state of affairs is due to mankind's separation from the love and spiritual precepts of "our universal Sire," and the rule instead of a series of male paters: the "erring Priest" who excites violence in the name of religion, the avaricious slaver who trades in "human anguish," and the ambitious "princeling[s]" who (unnaturally mothered) are "nursed in gore" and send their armies to their deaths for the sake of personal gain (CPW I: 113, 114-115). This chaos in loco par- entis is also manifested in the unnatural woman who, disdaining the proper nurturing role of mother, assumes the masculine role of bloody and</page><page sequence="9">278 T rapacious ruler. Thus in "Ode to the Departing Year," the bloody imperial ambitions of Empress Catherine of Russia are highlighted by the image of the "women's shrieks and infants' screams" she leaves in her wake (CPW I: 162). More than just a stock figure of pathetic helplessness, women and (pre-pubescent) children are part of a sexual politics of otherness, as sex- ual victims because they lack the means (bio-sexual, political, economic and otherwise) to commit rape. The sexual fate of the poor and exploited is made clear in "Religious Musings": ... O pale-eyed form, The victim of seduction, doomed to know Polluted nights and days of blasphemy; Who in loathed orgies with lewd wassailers Must gaily laugh, while thy remembered Home Gnaws like a viper at thy secret heart! (CPW I: 119) Interestingly, there is nothing (in terms of gendered pronouns or detailed physical description) to feminize this "pale-eyed form" apart from its sta- tus as sexual victim-yet if there is a degree of gender ambiguity to this figure, sexual victimization itself casts it in the position of the female, just as the masculine aggression of Catherine of Russia transforms her into the monstrous androgyny of the lustful and bloodthirsty woman-man: she is "The lustful murderess of her wedded lord!,", and "The insatiate Hag ... with drunken eye" (CPWI: 115, 162). A note to line 40 of "Ode to the De- parting Year" explains that Catherine's "desolating ambition" and "libidi- nous excesses" disqualify her from the proper "dear and venerable Char- acter of WOMAN-WOMAN, that complex term for Mother, Sister, Wife" (CPW I: 162-163, n. 2). If Coleridge's sexual politics identifies the safety of the home as the proper place of the woman, this is not simply a reactionary position in- tended to confine women to a marginal sphere; rather, it follows from his geopolitics of commerce in which far-flung economic ventures were closely associated with national/imperial greed, ruthless mercantile com- petition, slavery and economic exploitation in various forms. The special place that Coleridge accords to women is thus double-edged: while it as- sociates the proper gender role of women with the rather limited sphere of the domestic realm, it also makes this a geopolitical site of familial affec-</page><page sequence="10">(M)Othering the Nation 279 tion which directly counters the venturesome and violent ambitions of in- dividual and national commerce. Anti-commercial sentiments are thus combined with a conservative sexual politics in which only the properly submissive female, who fulfills a well-defined familial role as "mother, sister, wife," can be accorded the social affections due to a "woman." This is the proper corollary to the speaker who defines himself in "Fears in Solitude" as "a son, a brother, and a friend,/A husband, and a father" (CPW I: 262); social decorum and familial roles dominate the identity of woman, while providing a locus for the speaker-as-family-man, who denies political and economic ambitions for the enclosed security of the domestic scene. Yet in many of these poems, a contrary self is also implied, one that is not antithetical to the fa- milial scene, but works from within it to transform it into a place of anx- ious sexual desire. This tension is already seen in the intimate domestic setting in "Chatterton," where personified "Affection" (who turns the sui- cidal Chatterton's thoughts to his "native cot" and the emotional state of his sister and mother) is described in tantalizing d6shabill6: "Her bosom bare, and wildly pale her cheek" (CPW I: 128). She thus resembles both the "pale-eyed" distressed "victim of seduction" in "Ode to the Departing Year," as well as Chatterton's own mother with her "breast's convulsive throe." This other mother-who does not resign her nuturing, affectionate role, but at the same time acquires a sensual, desiring quality-is also a figure for the nation. Underlying the rapacious and patriarchal ambitions of the body politic, England in the speaker's moral imagination is "Not yet enslaved, or wholly vile,/O Albion! O my mother isle" ("Ode to the De- parting Year," CPW I: 166). Yet this invocation of England as the nurtur- ing, peaceful land not yet completely despoiled by political and commer- cial ambitions, relies on a description which is as much sensual and erotic as it is affectionate: Thy valleys, fair as Eden's bowers, Glitter green with sunny showers; Thy grassy uplands' gentle swells Echo the bleat of flocks; (Those grassy hills, those glittering dells Proudly ramparted with rocks) (CPW I: 166)</page><page sequence="11">280 T The pastoral setting, befitting the pre-commercial and politically innocent values the speaker wishes to uphold, is at the same time a symbol of fertil- ity with unmistakably anthropomorphic elements. "Gentle swells" and "grassy hills" are overdetermined symbols of breasts: they nurse sheep, and in so doing nurture an agrarian economy which is an alternative to ra- pacious (male) commerce-the German princelings "nursed in gore" in "Religious Musings," for example (CPW I: 116). Their repetition, which recalls the doubling of the "bosom bare" and "breast's convulsive throe" of the mother figure in "Chatterton," marks their function as psychological bosom for the speaker, the site both of comfort and uncomfortable desire or fascination. The allusion to Eden thus invites a reading of this "fair" and volup- tuous landscape in terms of woman-as-Eve-a reading which requires for its fulfillment the insertion of a male, Adamic figure as the other part of a closed, exclusionary sexual relationship ("they shall be one flesh," Gene- sis 2: 24). The male sexual figure is suggested in the mythic connotations of the "sunny showers," suggestive (by way of Zeus' manifestation as a shower of gold in the lap of Dana,) of male insemination. The priapic presence is also seen in the "proudly ramparted" rocks which stand in con- trast to "glittering dells"-their "pride" at their inseminating deed strangely resembling the imagined attack on England by some "proud In- vader," a rape of the mother land which the speaker similarly envisions in seminal terms ("stain'd thy fields with gore," CPW I: 167). Yet it is not only the "proud invader" or England's own political oli- garchs who occupy the male sexual position, but the speaker as well, who imagines the mother isle in these terms of sexual desire. If in moral terms the feared invasion of England is just punishment for her political trans- gressions, in psycho-sexual terms it is the son's vicarious possession of the mother (through the agency of a third party, a rapacious father figure) who is otherwise inaccessible to him. If the patriarchal law of rapacious com- merce leads the mother-nation into corruption and defilement, the speaker- son's deeply ambivalent response includes not a small measure of Schadenfreude, of a voyeuristic participation in this act of defilement which is also a vindication of his own warning. Yet this voyeuristic partic- ipation, like the classical scene of incest, still brings its punishment: if not Oedipus's full blindness and self-mutilation, then a symbolic blinding ("the Vision fled; /Yet still I gasp'd and reel'd with dread," "my eye-balls</page><page sequence="12">(M)Othering the Nation 281 start," CPW I: 166). This wounding of the sexually-offensive male is also figured elsewhere in the poem in the image of England the "thankless Is- land" as Diana, "Her quiver full, and with unbroken bow" (CPW I: 165). Following this intertextual logic, the speaker is cast as hapless Acteon, his anxious desire for the mother rebuffed, just as the proud goddess brutally rejects and punishes Acteon's desirous gaze. The implicit note of sexual desire and transgression running through the poem explains the mendicant, hermitic fate of the speaker at the end: Away, my soul, away! I unpartaking of the evil thing, With daily prayer and daily toil Soliciting for food my scanty soil Have wail'd my country with a loud Lament. Now I recentre my immortal mind In the deep Sabbath of meek self-content; Cleans'd from the vaporous passions that bedim God's Image, sister of the Seraphim. (CPW I: 168) While the exile from England is ostensibly a renunciation of the "evil thing" of commercial greed and empire, in favor of an alternative exis- tence of simplicity and self-reliance, there is also a note of guilty renunci- ation in the ascetic regime of "daily prayer and daily toil." The "scanty soil" of exile is also a direct contrast to, and denial of, the lush sensuality and fertility of the speaker's earlier descriptions of the mother isle. While the final evocation of God's presence is in keeping with the speaker's vi- sion of a morally pure alternative to the "evil" of England's ambitions, what is curious is his insistence on cleansing his own "vaporous pas- sions"-etymologically (from the Latin "vapor") connoting a steaminess which makes the speaker's passions suspect, more a pressure seeking re- lease than a controlled and justifiable social criticism. Curiously, too, the final line restores the female form in an unexpected context: the "Seraphim" of the Biblical tradition are explicitly male ("he covered his face," Isaiah 6: 2) and the term itself comes from a "Hebrew masculine plural form" (Gigot 1999). At one level, the speaker is compared to the prophet Isaiah, whose sin is purged by the fiery coal which the Seraphim places on his mouth, and whose outcry at the condition of Jerusalem re-</page><page sequence="13">282 T sembles the speaker's "lament" over England. At another level, however, this pseudo-Isaiah carries over the feminine form and the familial relation- ships from the earthly world, interpolating them in a disturbing and awk- ward manner into the transcendent spirituality of the heavenly kingdom. Coleridge's poetic narrative may thus be compared to Freud's account of "repression," in particular the variety known as "obsessional neurosis," like all forms of repression an imperfect means of coping with desire, and involving a substitution between a "sadistic" or "hostile" impulse and an "affectionate" one towards "someone who is loved" ("Repression" 156-157). It is precisely the "withdrawal of libido," the denial of a desire perceived as unacceptable and untenable, which creates a "reaction-forma- tion" manifesting itself as an "opposite" emotional attitude. This funda- mental "ambivalence" towards the loved one has as its psychical cost an impact on the self in the form of "social anxiety, moral anxiety, [. . .] unlimited self-reproaches" and "increased conscientiousness" (Freud, "Repression" 157). The guilt-ridden speaker in Coleridge's poetic narratives, with his overwrought renunciation of English society in which there is also a significant note of self-criticism, is thus the effect of an ob- sessional neurotic desire for an ideal social integration-an ideal which is, not surprisingly, played out in the Oedipal terms of the speaker-son's si- multaneous affection-(sexual) hostility towards the mother. This deep du- ality, often manifested as an oscillation in emotional attitude to the mother-land, may be compared to Coleridge's coy political stance, charac- terized by a "retirement/engagement/re-retirement" which Keane associ- ates both with the "systolic-diastolic" (189) pulse of biological life itself, and with the symbolism of the sea and its rhythms in poems like The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Politics, which for various historical, personal and literary reasons may not always be spoken, becomes displaced not onto a linear allegorical framework, but rather an ebbing-and-flowing one whose mechanics are that of coitus, the pulse, psychic strategies, and other such unconscious bi- ological patterns. Keane compares the Ancient Mariner's struggles be- tween making meaning out of the mysterious universe and his "unaware" actions (both impulses evident when he "blessed [the water-snakes] un- aware," CPWI: 198), to Coleridge's problematic relationship with the po- litical father/God, the repressive Pitt government of the day (200-203). Such a reading could also relate Coleridge's pulsating articulation of the</page><page sequence="14">(M)Othering the Nation 283 anxieties of "domestic politics" to the psycho-sexual tensions of power and the feminine form (although such is not Keane's primary concern). Anne Williams observes that the poem "Frost at Midnight" shows a "speaking subject" who "emerges when matter/mater is successfully re- pressed" (201). Language is then the medium, and narrative the means, for a "sleight of hand" in which expected gender roles become slippery, the mother is absent and "frozen," and the self becomes "impotent" in light of this absence, and constitutes itself partially in female terms (202-203). This "female gothic" sensibility is in contrast to the "male gothic" one of Rime of the Ancient Mariner, in which "agape represses eros," and sym- bolic language enacts a "horrified repression of the female" (Williams 185, 197). The political significance of this poetics is thus the uneasy rela- tionship that patriarchal law has with the "maternal," whose power and freedom must thus be perverted and made monstrous (the figure of the "Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH"), or else repressed as frozen and absent (the frozen nature of "Frost at Midnight"). A similar poetics is seen in Debbie Lee's Kristeva-inspired reading of Rime of the Ancient Mariner in terms of a "marriage of identity and alterity," a "boundary-dissolving process" in which the strict dichotomies of male and female, British and African, free and enslaved, are radically challenged (679). The images of illness in the poem, which Lee links to the epidemics of Yellow Fever that plagued the British territories in Africa and the West Indies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, are thus part of a discourse of "guilt" meant to undermine the differences of power and race, and the processes of abjection, which were the basis of the British slave trade. The abjected mother as a symbol for the (racial, gender, economic and political) other, offers a persuasive reading of poems like Ancient Mariner, in which the self's crisis of the feminine must be resolved before true unity (of both individual and community) can be accomplished. Yet this unity is a fragile process, as Williams is quick to point out, and the Mariner returned to dry land may be haunted by the spectre of the mon- strous female, but "refuses to look back on what he knows is there" (196-7). Repression returns precisely at the moment of the Mariner's seemingly transcendent vision of community and moral life at the end of the poem; the wedding-guest on his part turns away from the door of the wedding, symbolizing his own repression of eros, his disenchantment with the rituals of sexual-marital union, in the face of the monstrous feminine</page><page sequence="15">284 T he encounters in the Mariner's narrative. If the monstrous feminine in An- cient Mariner and the frosty mother in "Frost at Midnight" in some ways correspond respectively to the lustful woman (Empress Catherine) as "Hag" and the threatening virgin (proud England as Diana) in poems like "Ode to the Departing Year," these manifestations-provoking repression and denial-function together with the mother as object of desire-hostility, collectively allowing the self a greater and more complex range of re- sponses. "LIFE-IN-DEATH" in Ancient Mariner is thus balanced by the sensual figures of Geraldine in Christabel, and the various alluring femi- nine figures in "Kubla Khan." Kubla Khan is in many ways a very different figure from the mariner, imperial and powerful where the mariner is (for the most part) abject and helpless, and distant and shadowy where the mariner's thoughts and emo- tional states are often laid open. Yet Suther seems to be right in saying that Coleridge wrote "only one poem," and "such a poem is likely to illuminate all of his other works, which will seem to have their meaning in function of it" (31-32). "Kubla Khan," a poem about a powerful male principle which imposes itself on the land, and the consequences of this act of male authority, belongs in broad terms to Coleridge's gothic romance of the na- tion-state. The Khan is a figure of wealth and plenty, but these are founded on exclusion, alienation and violence: this is marked most clearly by the "fertile ground" which he encloses with his "walls and towers," not for their productive fertility, but for his own unproductive pleasure (CWP I: 297). The first part of the poem describes the Khan in terms of a set of du- alistic, paradoxical traits: on the one hand only a name, never bodily pre- sent or concrete, he is nevertheless a name with a certain incantatory, kab- balistic power. Like the divine (and patriarchal) fiat in Genesis, the name of Kubla Khan seems to speak a world into being. The Khan's actions are seemingly hedonistic and secular, yet they have an inexplicable connec- tion with the spiritual and sacred: in the kabbalistic gestures of the "gir- dled" circle, the repetitive formula ("twice five miles"), the connection with "Alph, the sacred river." The "stately" measurements of his pleasure dome are also in contrast to the irregular and "measureless" subterranean caverns below it. This duality then extends to his enterprise as well: while the edifice is dedicated to pleasure, presumably that of the Khan himself, there is nevertheless a sterility and joylessness about it, marked by his ab-</page><page sequence="16">(M)Othering the Nation 285 sence, the lifelessness of the "sunless sea," the will-to-order which con- strains nature's bounty. The Khan's domain is contrasted with the wild landscape in the second part of the poem (lines 12-36), a vastly different landscape of wild pas- sions and emotions: it is a "romantic chasm," "savage" and "haunted" by "woman wailing for her demon-lover." The-land itself seems to reinforce this last image of manifest desire, with the earth heaving in "fast thick pants," culminating in the seminal eruption of "a mighty fountain" in which are borne (and perhaps born) "huge fragments" like "chaffy grain." The seminal flow, with its motile elements ("dancing rocks"), then follows a "meandering" path into the depths of the land, through "caverns mea- sureless to man." The end and result of this uterine journey is not concep- tion, but sterility: the "lifeless ocean" which swallows up this seminal flow, is followed immediately (in line 29) by a return to Kubla and his in- timation of "Ancestral voices prophesying war" (CPW I: 298). War, in this symbolic representation, does not prevent desire and coitus, but exists alongside them, although it does curtail reproduction and new life. This symbolic structure thus resembles that of Coleridge's poems of social criticism such as "Religious Musings," "Ode to the De- parting Year" and "Fears in Solitude," in which war-horrendous naval battles over commerce, or the invasion of England by a foreign power as retribution and punishment for its social and political evils-is seen as the ultimate threat, alone capable of forestalling production and toppling the regime of power. The separation of sexual desire and (its biological concomitant) the reproduction of new life, can thus be read as a corol- lary of repressive politics and commerce-a patriarchal fiat which serves the desires (for power, commodities, wealth) of the authority-fig- ures, while also manifesting itself in a sterility of the mother-land, the exhaustion and death of the common people, the restriction of rights and movements. In this psychological alignment, the speaker and the Khan are not so much opposites, as they are male rivals in desire-and unlikely doubles of each other in their common enemy death. Drew reads the Khan as a figure who "sought to make a transformation from imperial to spiritual power" (46) and thus becomes the "daemonified figure at the close" of the poem. This reading of the poem as an account of the Khan's movement from am- bition and materialism to spiritualism and transcendence, while convinc-</page><page sequence="17">286 T ing in broad terms, is less helpful with the detailed images of agonized conflict in the middle section of the poem, as well as with the precise terms of the relationship between the seer and the Khan. Rather, the rela- tionship between the two personae or (what is also possible) two states of mind, seems best described in terms of the psycho-drama of doubling, split and tension. The doubling of speaker and Khan is particularly evident in the third and final part of the poem, from line 37 onwards: the speaker is the Khan's successor or imitator of sorts, using narrative power to "re- vive" the vision of the Khan's political regime, recreating in imagination "That sunny dome! Those caves of ice," participating in similar kabbalis- tic/constructivist gestures ("weave a circle round him thrice," which does one better than the Khan's "twice five miles"), and reconstituting himself as a figure of power and "dread" ("And all should cry, Beware! Be- ware!"). The Oedipal triangle is thus written into the poem's tripartite structure, in which the first section of the Khan's dominance is the phase of the father's control over pleasure (and the arrogation of pleasure to him- self-although from the perspective of the rival son, this pleasure is also underutilized by the father); while the second section is a fantasy of fe- male desire, where the landscape itself seems to enact a faceless and anonymous coitus. These images of desire cannot be strictly identified ei- ther as the domain of the father or of the son: if it is established that the fa- ther has political authority over the land, the poet-son has imaginative au- thority to re-create the land as the domain of a wild, uncontrollable domain of desire. Yet the son's fantasy-production does not kill off (conclusively re- move) the father-figure, who resurfaces in the midst of this landscape of desire (11. 29-30), and who also survives in aspects of the son's imitative behaviour in the final section. If Watson is right in saying that this is "a poem about poetry" (122) this is because poetry (together with the figure of the poet) is finally complicit and involved in the poetics of desire-a poetics whose other aspect is the titular Khan and the political power he represents. It might equally be said that the poem is about "world con- quest, of the land mass by Mongols" O(just as Ancient Mariner in some ways figures the power of the Old World over the New; Empson 318), that its "enchanted" chasm figures the commercial luxury that Coleridge else- where personifies as an "Enchantress vile" (in the poem "Happiness," CPWI: 31), and that its landscape of "ceaseless turmoil" and "chaffy grain</page><page sequence="18">(M)Othering the Nation 287 beneath the thresher's flail" also evokes the "unceasing toil" of the work- ing class of which Coleridge complains in the Bristol Lectures (11) and the Watchman (132). Desire, like guilt, multiplies through commercial society and through poetic representation: if the Khan is a figuire of the patriarchal law seen as responsible for England's present social woes, he is in turn repeated in the figure of Sir Leoline in Christabel: an oppressive father, whose domain is characterized by enclosing walls and constraining power. In that poem, too, desire (in the form of Sir Leoline's impulsive attachment to Geral- dine, even at the cost of alienating his own daughter) is linked with en- chantment, as both father and daughter are "O'er-mastered by the mighty spell" (CPW I: 234). The absence (and faint spectral presence) of Christa- bel's dead mother, far from being an abjection of the mother, only permits the fantasy production of a transgressive sexuality involving Geraldine as stepmother to Christabel (in a scene redolent of lesbian seduction, in lines 236-244) and as surrogate daughter to Leoline (in his lascivious embrace of his daughter while his eye rests with "cheerful wonder" on Geraldine, lines 397-402). Swann observes that "Geraldine is a fantasy, produced by the psychic operations of condensation and displacement" ("Wandering Mother" 540)-but a fantasy of both father and daughter, male and female con- sciousnesses, individuals of the court as well as the court (the feudal state) as a whole. Swann elsewhere refers to Geraldine's "strange overdetermi- nation which creates disturbances" ("Literary Gentlemen" 406)on a num- ber of difference levels, including in the process of reading itself (and in the minds of contemporary readers). Part of this overdetermination is the sexual politics of both the family and the state. In Christabel, statehood and sexuality are commingled, and the appearance of Geraldine seems to mark the beginning of the end of the long rift between Sir Leoline and Lord Roland. It is not clear whether Geraldine truly is the latter's daugh- ter, or whether she intends good or ill to the two rulers. As the figure of desire, she revivifies complex emotions which previously had etiolated: on meeting her, Leoline is prompted to overcome the "aloof"' silence sep- arating him from Roland, and sends his bard with a proposal for an en- counter between the two powers which is redolent as much of the urgency and struggle of war as it is of friendship:</page><page sequence="19">288 T He bids thee come without delay With all thy numerous array And take thy lovely daughter home: And he will meet thee on the way With all his numerous array White with their panting palfreys' foam: (CPWI: 231) Geraldine's sexually-charged body, which takes the place of the spectral and disembodied mother-wife, stirs up acts of power in the lifeless and faded household-state: the "toothless" and "old" mastiffis roused to an "angry moan" at Geraldine's passage, Christabel is initiated into sexual knowledge, and Leoline is aroused from his gloomy perspective on this "world of death" to a youthful and martial vigor once again. As in "Kubla Khan," power is marked by authority over language, and by language as authority: Geraldine herself speaks with authority (which may explain her partially monstrous appearance, shared with other authoritative women like the Empress Catherine), banishing the ghostly mother with a com- mand ("Off, woman, offi"), enchanting Christabel with a spell "which is lord of thy utterance," and spinning her narratives of deceit which have power over others' actions. In this respect she also resembles Leoline, whose authority is marked by utterances, as when he commands Bard Bracy to vigorous action, and proclaims challenges to Lord Roland's ene- mies. Powerlessness, the position of the victim, is accordingly marked by the inability to speak, and in this respect Christabel is simultaneously sexual victim (whose status as victim extends into the inability to accuse her vic- timizer, into being made to bear guilt and shame), impotent soothsayer, and victim of a domestic gender imbalance and a tyrannical father. Her po- sition bears similarities to that of the Coleridgean social critic, who is both complicit in guilt and desire (Christabel, for all her later hostility and futile criticism, introduces Geraldine into the castle, and shares her bed with her), as well as critical of the desiring authority she sees in her lord and fa- ther. The psycho-drama of bewailing the nation and belonging to it, comes home in the case of Christabel, since in her case the family and the nation are coterminous, just as Leoline is the ultimate patriarchal figure, king-fa- ther-desirer-author in one. Christabel, like "Kubla Khan," is a fragment that refuses to cohere into</page><page sequence="20">(M)Othering the Nation 289 a logical, Aristotelian narrative. Yet it acquires a field of meanings from its resemblance to the psycho-sexual dramas in Coleridge's other writings. This gothic criticism of the commercial state and the politics of oppres- sion, is not the opposite of desire (for endless and rapacious acquisition of commodities and power), but its uneasy displacement onto a transgressive and guilt-ridden sexuality. Political belonging-the individual's uneasy re- lationship with the state, caught between angry renunciation of its policy on the one hand, and a fear of complete alienation on the other-is worked out in a narrative of anxious complicity, which not only restores desire in the apparent act of criticizing it (elsewhere), but involves the reader (and reading/narrating) in a poetics of sensational excess and sensual participa- tion. These gothic narratives may displace and disguise their politics onto an extravagant symbolic landscape, but in the process they also reveal modernity's neurotic obsession with the power of desire, including its power over the self and self-realization.
