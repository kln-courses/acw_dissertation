<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nachrichten / News and Notes ILO: Revision of Accord 107 on American Indian Populations GENEVA (IAH). Düring the September 1986 Meeting of the Administrative Council of the International Labor Associa tion (ILO) the revision of the Accord on Indian and Tribal Populations was discussedby experts. Accord 107, adopted in 1957, needs to be revised to allow for adaptation to present day circumstances, in particular, to permit considération of the views of organizations representing Indian and tribal® o^® peoples. It was shown that the tendency towards intégration contained in Accord 107 has been superseded by new con cepts and conditions, and it was recognized that the right to differ represents an enrichment of, and not an attack on, nati onal sovereignty. Overcoming this integrationist outlook sig nifies for Indian peoples the right to determine the course of their economic development and to preserve and further de velop their own institutions, languages and cultures. It was recommended that Accord 107 be revised by the ILO in 1988 and that Indian participation in the revision process be gua ran teed.

Halal, a site located south east from Bolonchen (Campeche) and mentioned in the writ ings of Teobert Maler, was visited in March, 1987 by the au thor, Hanns J. Prem, and Pedro Pacheco from Bolonchen. Halal is a savannah roughly 1 km in diameter; a water hole (aguada) is situated on its southern edge. The archaeological zone consists of various groups of constructions situated at considerable distance from each other on the low elevations surrounding the savannah. Four such groups were visited, but at least one other with a building described as totally collapsed is known to exist. Group I consists of a single two-room buil ding in Puuc style, the vault of which has collapsed, while at Group III only the rear wall of a one-story building is still standing. Of special interest is Group II because of its unusual gene ral features. Lying atop a flat hill, it is formed by buildings Fig. 2) Monumental sculpture known as El Rey (Photo U. •" £ , i v ■/ V .i" " s. ' * J y ' • / * .

The offerings consist, among other things, of three elaborate flint lance-heads with Maya faces chipped in profile and of various jade carvings, including a flat plaque about 10 inches long and a 7 inch statuette of a man.

Des weiteren stellte die mexikanische Regierung fest, daß bei einigen von Amnesty International als politische Morde beschriebenen Fällen die Mörder vor Gericht gestellt wurden und bei anderen die Untersuchungen aus Mangel an Zeugen eingestellt werden mußten. Es wurde von mexikanischer Seite bekräftigt, daß „die Geschichte Mexikos Zeuge für die tief verwurzelte Tradition der Respektierung der Menschenrechte und deren Einbrin gung in die Gesetzgebung ist", obwohl zugebenermaßen die Justiz manchmal energischer durchgreifen und nicht zu ver schweigende Lücken ausgemerzt werden müßten. Nach Mitteilung des mexikanischen Innenministeriums hat die Regierung Mexikos eine Delgation von Amnesty International nochmals eingeladen, damit sie sachliche In formationen über die für sie interessanten Fälle einholen kann. Diese Einladung wurde dem Generalsekretär von Am nesty International, Herrn Thomas Hammerberg, telegra phisch vom Staatsminister des Inneren, Herrn Jorge Carillo Olea, ausgesprochen. Außerdem hat die mexikanische Regie rung den Anträgen der Organisation entsprochen. Nichts destotrotz wird in dem erwähnten Bericht der Menschen rechtsorganisation kein Unterschied zwischen glaubhaften Tatsachen und subjektiven Behauptungen gemacht. Zudem sind in allen Fällen die den Delegierten an Ort und Stelle zur Verfügung gestellten Informationen nicht entsprechend ein bezogen worden und, wenn ja, so wurden sie durch zweideu tige und unbegründete Behauptungen entwertet, womit nicht bewiesene Darstellungen Niederschlag gefunden haben. Als Beweis des Interesses Mexikos an der Aufklärung der im Bericht erwähnten Fälle, ist die Einladung an die Men schenrechtsorganisation wiederholt worden, zumal beide Seiten in ihren Zielen übereinstimmen.</page></plain_text>
