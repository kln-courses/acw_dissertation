"Once one has recognized that human sexu ality is the hieroglyph of divine fertility, he understands how Milton humanizes the uni verse and at the same time spiritualizes the first facts of life." In addition to the association of Adam with the sun and Eve with both moon and earth, Christ is linked to the sun and light so that "the symbolic equivalence is such that Christ, the sun, light, and Adam (a masculine configuration) are interchangeable ciphers in a divine equation that balances a feminine con figuration made up of the earth, moon, and Eve, which two image clusters combine in turn to yield Milton's monistic God." In this way the poet demonstrates that our highest values are an "extension of what we know through human love." Seymour Chatman. "Milton's Participial Style." PMLA, 83, 5, 1386—1399. Chatman's article is abstracted in PMLA. Blossom Feinstein. "On the Hymns of John Milton and Gian Francesco Pico." Compara tive Literature, XX, iii, 245—253. In the "Nativity Ode" Milton "hails the routing of the pagan gods and the rituals with which they are associated," a major theme which will find expression later in PL and 5/4. This routing of the pagan deities throughout the Renaissance signals a turn to the simplicity, certainty, and security that attend Christian doctrine. In reaching this perspective and con structing his poem, Milton draws on the poetry of Pico in five general areas: the noiselessness of the battle between Christ and the Roman leaders, the uses of imagery of the sun, thunder bolt, and trump of doom to convey destruction of oracles, the retreat of the oracles accompanied by howling and lamentations, the detailed de scription of the oracles and deities, and the cloud-sun simile used to describe the retreat of the pagans.

Milton's essentially "argumentative" man ner deliberately links sensuous immediacy with rhetoric and by doing so engages a more fully developed response from the reader. This con nection is most evident in the poem's formal similes which "remind us of the poem's true mode" and the "logical and imaginative pres ence of the poet himself." The simile describing Satan leading Eve to the Tree of Knowledge (PL IX. 633-645) "must be read as an evolving process of dramatized discovery: Milton moves the reader from Satan's feelings to their effects on that shape in which he deceived man, and finally to the effects of that visible prospect on Eve." Here sensuous immediacy is an organic part of the rhetorical argument. Milton chal lenges the reader's mode of apprehension first by drama of a particular kind and second by the strategy of undercutting his own poetry with analogies from a "world of fable, geo graphical conjecture, and 'imagined religions'." In PL I. 789-798 "Milton can express the full terror of the devils only by declaring ^overtly the failure of figurative language." . . Now dissolving now emphasizing the margins of his fiction—he keeps us keenly aware of the limits of poetry, as well as the fallibility of our own vision." Nathaniel H. Henry. "The Mystery of Mil ton's Muse." Renaissance Papers, 1967, 69—83. Various interpretations of the identity of Milton's Muse leave the problem confused and unresolved. "Milton's Muse is primarily a liter ary conceit which reflects prayers to the theo logical abstracts of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost." The invocations reveal a neu tral point of view ". . . that deliberately allows for varying interpretation or identification of the poet's source of inspiration." In making this multiple appeal, Milton is in a tradition that includes Homer, Lucretius, Virgil, Dante, Tasso, DuBartas, and Spenser. Lee A. Jacobus. " 'Thaumaturgike' in PL." De livered at MLAy December, 1968. In John Dee's preface to the first English translation of Euclid's Elements he defines Thaumaturgike as ". . . that Art Mathemati 13</page><page sequence="3">call, which giueth certaine order to make straunge workes, of the sense to be perceiued, and of men greatly to be wondered at." Thau maturgy—or wonder working—figures in all the universe Milton explores in PL: it is an art practiced not only by demons, but by the forces of good as well, in Paradise, Heaven, and Hell. "In Milton's universe all things differ in de gree, not in kind. This is a point worth stress ing since it seems to be the unifying principle behind Milton's use of natural science in PL, just as it seems to be the unifying principle behind his rather remarkable use of thauma turgy." Maurice Kelley. "Milton and the Trinity." Delivered at MLA, December, 1968. The anti-Arian thesis propounded by Wil liam B. Hunter, Jr. in 1959 must be examined, for until we determine its soundness ". . . we cannot speak with certainty of Milton's reli gious beliefs during the third and last period of his life." The controversy contains two centers of contention: the first is semantic and concerns the proper use of "Arian" and "Arianism," the second is theological and concerns the precise doctrine of God present in De Doctrina. Though we have had this ". . . unequivocal declaration of Arianism for 143 years, . . . some Miltonists still maintain the orthodoxy of the De Doc trina . . .." To the contrary, "Milton disliked the doctrine of the Trinity: he considered it unscriptural, hastily adopted on the authority of almost a single, dubious text, and supported by strange and absurd hypotheses that have no foundation in holy writ." William A. McQueen. "Point of View in PL: Books I-IV." Renaissance Papers, 1967, 85—92. "Milton was faced with an extremely diffi cult problem: he must establish Satan as a serious adversary and at the same time assert God's omnipotence." His solution is achieved in the manipulation of point of view. Not only does the poem begin in Hell, it is seen from Hell, and from this limited perspective ". . . Satan can seem to be a formidable adversary." But beginning with the view from Heaven in Book III the perspective broadens, . . over riding the partial view which has dominated the reader's perceptions up to this point." How 14 ever, the initial impression of Books I and II lingers on, so . . we get yet another shock in Book IV, when Satan himself reveals in his first soliloquy the falseness of our earlier impres sions." Manipulation of point of view, then, achieves a gradual revelation that controls the narrative progression of the poem, allowing our awareness of the total pattern of meaning to expand, . . like Adam's, from a limited, im perfect perception toward a gradual, full com prehension." Virginia Mollenkott. "Milton's Mortalism: Treatise Vs. Poetry." SCN, XXVI, iii, 51—52. The mortalist heresy in Milton is "confined to explicit statement in his theological treatise and is not embodied in any of his poems." In the De Doctrina Milton argues at length from rather shaky evidence in Job and Ecclesiastes to prove his point, but this doctrine is absent from the poetry. "II Penseroso" draws a dis tinction between mortal body and immortal soul which the De Doctrina repudiates. The lines in PL II, 146—151, which have been read as poetic examples of Milton's poetic mortalism, reflect only "Belial's terror of annihilation," and PL X. 775-792 reflect only Adam's some what confused intellectual writhings with the meaning of death. It is difficult to explain why Milton was so vehement in the De Doctrina, yet carefully excluded mortalism from his poetry. Perhaps he . . felt responsible to avoid the more violent theological controversies of his time whenever he turned from polemics and began to chant his Songs as a Poet-Priest." Leland Ryken. "Milton and the Apocalyptic." HLQ, XXXI, 223—238. The subject matter of PL is apocalyptic, that is, it transcends human experience; so the question arises as to how Milton can develop his supernatural subject yet render it humanly comprehensible. PL is based on two major premises: the theory of accomodation and Plat onism. The theory of accomodation offers an anthropomorphic representation of God so that His divine essence may become comprehensible in human terms. Milton used this theory as a basis for his apocalyptic vision in PL} and the result is a preponderance of physical detail in the apocalyptic parts of the narrative. The</page><page sequence="4">Platonic theory of Ideas, appearing for example during the conversation between Raphael and Adam, also pervades PL, but not as extensively as the theory of accomodation. The Platonic theory of Ideas fitted well with Milton's theory of accomodation; it was used to supplement that doctrine by suggesting that earthly objects are the imperfect replicas of the transcend ent realm. Thus apocalyptic reality could be presented by Milton in physical, human terms without minimizing the difference between the visible and invisible worlds. To understand this is to understand the poet's assumptions and the way in which the seventeenth century reader interpreted the poem. Paul R. Sellin. "Caesar Calandrini, the London Dutch, and Milton's Quarrels in Holland." HLQ, XXXI, 239—249. A letter from Milton to Ezekiel Spanheim contains a reference to one Calandrinus who "acted with his usual courtesy, and according to my wishes, in indicating to you that it would give me great pleasure if you joined forces with me against a common adversary." It has been assumed that this mediary was Jean Louis Calandrini, a woolens merchant residing in Geneva, but other evidence suggests that Mil ton was closer to a younger brother of Jean Louis, Caesar, a minister living in England. Caesar was not unknown in London. He be longed to a clan of exiles who had progressed from Lucca to England; he had some ties with Charles Diodati, and probably met Milton through him. Moreover, Caesar was tied through the marriage of his father to the Dutch church and opposition to Salmasius, Milton's and Span heim's common enemy. An understanding of Caesar and his position clarifies the "common enemy" phrase in Mil ton's letter, explains why Salmasius suspected Milton of working in collusion with his old foes after the First Defense, and suggests how Milton well might have procured the instruc tions of the Dutch ambassadors before they could embark for England. Paul R. Sellin. "Puritan and Anglican: A Dutch Perspective." SP, LXV, 5, 804—815. "By the outbreak of the Civil War . . . the evidence indicates that, orthodox Calvinist that he was, Heinsius' sympathies lay no more with the Presbyterian opposition than with Laud's position." A study of Heinsius does not yield "so distasteful a picture of Reformed piety" as is usually associated with Calvinist orthodoxy. On the contrary, this Dutch theologian be longed to the "influential group of moderate orthodox, men committed to the common weal of church and state rather than to the extreme demands of colliding dogmas." George F. Sensabaugh. "That Vile Mercenary, Milton." Pacific Coast Philology, III (1968), 5—15. The legend that Milton was a vile mercen ary during his incumbency as Secretary for Foreign Tongues has had a variable career from 1649 to the present. His motives were attacked by defenders of Charles I (such as Richard Perrinchief and Francis Turner) as mercenary and base. Thomas Long added to this a charge that Milton was a disguised Jesuit. John Aubrey and Edward Phillips, however, interpreted Milton's position as disinterested in" private gain and steming from public benevo lence. While Samuel Johnson subtly agrees with Milton's accusers, David Masson acquits him by showing that Milton refused pay for his answer to Salmasius in 1651. In the twentieth century S. B. Liljegren reverses Masson's judg ment and makes Milton's self-aggrandizement a critical principle necessary in the elucidation of his major works. M. Paul Morand argues that the decision to accept the Secretaryship marks the beginning of a "spiritual disloca tion." William Empson, however, justifies Mil ton's equivocation as enabling him to dramatize his epic characters more co.ncretely. Mason Tung. "Samson Impatiens: A Reinter pretation of Milton's SA." Texas Studies in Literature and Language, IX, iv, 475—492. Recent studies of 5/4 that find thematic unity in a gradual process of regeneration do not fully satisfy the text, since there is no pro gression, only "a sudden conversion similar to that in the Book of Job." The important the matic center of the play is Samson's impatience and weakness, his inability to conquer it, and the "sudden conversion of the self-abandoned Samson in the last hours of his life." In this light the words of the Chorus, the visits of Dalila and Harapha, and the climax take on 15</page><page sequence="5">new significance. The Chorus succeeds in paci fying Samson only during its visit with him; the comfort is not lasting. But it is precisely this failure which "realizes its artistic function of pointing up Samson's lack of patience." Dali la provokes in Samson various manifestations of wrath and irascibility, born of despair and impatience, and parent of an increasing self righteousness which make him unfit to be God's champion. Samson's challenge to the giant Harapha reveals not heroic and honorable be havior but "his impulsive temper, his impatience with an unpromising future, and above all, his desperate motive—seeking destruction by an other's hand." But suddenly God's spirit moves and Samson, through God's special dispensa tion, is made patient and submissive. The ex perience is much like those of Paul, Job, and Abraham, subjects of Milton's discussion of temptation in De Doctrina. Joseph Anthony Wittreich, Jr. "The 'Satan ism' of Blake and Shelley Reconsidered." SP, LXV, 5, 816—833. In modern literary criticism Satanism de notes an interpretation of PL which favors a radical strain that sees in Satan a "thoroughly admirable moral agent." The Satanists base their reasoning on the words of Blake and Shel ley without understanding what they really said. Blake's famous passage in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell is not a final, definitive statement. His attitude toward Milton evolved until it became more clearly defined in the later, more mature Milton where he denounced Satan and his motives. Shelley's attitude under went a similar evolution. In Prometheus Un bound, he rejects Satan for his ambitious, spite ful and egocentric characteristics. It is the modern Satanists who have fabricated the no tion that Satan is a morally admirable crea ture, and it is here that they have failed to make the distinction between moral and aes thetic admiration which Blake and Shelley made in their mature works. Their work should be distinguished from, not identified with, the views of the twentieth century Satanists. When talking about Milton's God, Blake and Shelley expose their inadequate "historical sense" of what Milton was doing and why. But in their discussion of Milton's Satan, Blake and Shelley remain in touch with Milton's poem whereas the modern Satanists do not. Blake and Shelley modified their early opinions on Satan; they "retrospectively evaluated and qualified as their outlook matured and their faculty for dealing with subtleties sharpened." Joseph Anthony Wittreich, Jr. "Milton's 'Destin'd Urn': The Art of Lycidas." PMLA, 84, 1, 60—70. Wittreich's article is abstracted in PMLA. B. A. Wright. "A Milton Crux." N&amp;Q, XV, x, 377. Baphael tells Adam that Angels "Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate" {PL, V, 412) food. Editors gloss "concoct" as "digest," but this makes for senseless repetition. "Concoct" rather means the complete process of digestion and assimilation. To be sure, we blind men are not the least of God's concerns, for the less able we are to perceive anything other than himself, the more mercifully and graciously does he deign to look upon us. .. . Divine law and divine favor have rendered us not only safe from injuries of men, but almost sacred, nor do these shadows around us seem to have been created so much by the dullness of our eyes as by the shade of angel's wings. And divine favor not infrequently is wont to lighten these shadows again, once made, by an inner and far more enduring light.
