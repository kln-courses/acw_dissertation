Robkin INTRODUCTION Recent anthropological theory has emphasized the role of ecological functions and environ? mental adaptations in explaining the origins of cultural traits. Particularly influential state? ments of this position are contained in Harris' [ 1 ] ecological account of India's sacred cattle. Thus, we will focus on it as a paradigmatic bad example. According to Harris, the explanation of Indian cattle management policies is to be sought "in the 'positive-functioned' and prob? ably 'adaptive' processes of the ecological system of which they are a part" [2]; the origination of these felicitous customs was "the cumulative result of the individual (prac? tical) decisions of millions and millions of individual farmers" [3]. We are told that, "Cultural ecological theory predicts that religiously supported food taboos seldom, if ever, decrease total energetic and nutritional efficiency; actually, such taboos often con? stitute ideological barriers against food prac? tices that might tend to degrade specific eco? systems or impair their bioenergetic produc? tivity" [4]. Although it has been claimed that the ecological account of India's sacred cattle complex is now "largely confirmed" [5], and constitutes an "adequate explanation" of this phenomenon [6], in fact Harris' argument is open to serious criticism and an alternative hypothesis appears more plausible. In this paper, several important weaknesses in Harris ecological schema are noted, and an alternative evolutionary hypothesis is outlined. We will suggest, first, that functional-ecological models are logically incapable of explaining macro evolutionary emergence; second, that Harris' ecology is biologically uninformed; third, that ecological explanations ignore important "social field" factors [7], and especially under? estimate the role of cpnflict and dialectic in the morphogenesis of all living systems [8]; and, finally, that historical research indicates that the prohibition on beef in India was pronounced by state governments as part of a broader policy of resource management and taxation. This policy was devised by and for the elite minorities of classical imperial states, and not by and/or for "millions and millions of individual farmers." The present work is part of an ongoing evolutionary critique of ecological theory which we have applied to the emergence of the Hutterite cultural pattern [9], the explana? tion of 'cargo' ritual in Mesoamerica [10], the prohibition upon pork in Islam [11], and a number of other cases. We believe that one legitimate approach to the study of the dialectics of society (although not the only legitimate approach), is to begin with general principles drawn with discrimination from a consideration of the dialectics of nature. While Paul Diener and Donald Nonini study anthropology at Stanford University. Eugene E. Robkin is Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin Center, Baraboo/Sauk County Campus.</page><page sequence="2">222 we advocate the use of biological thought in the social sciences, however, we are also aware of the danger of the abuse of biological models [12]. Thus, we reject the genetic reductionism of sociobiology, the discredited ideas of Social Darwinism, and the simplistic notions of Harris' cultural ecology. As we will see here in the case of Harris' ecology of Indian cattle, such abuses of biological thought in social science are often based upon superficial and distorted ideas of the biological literature. It is not our intention, however, to dismiss all ecological models, but rather to insist that functional-ecological adaptation and evolu? tionary emergence through dialectical develop? ment are distinct, but related, processes, and require distinct, but related modes of explana? tion. Only by developing an independent, dialectical and thus action oriented theory of evolutionary emergence and potential will we be able to answer the questions, (concerning the cultural patterns we observe in the world about us), "why they exist, what their origins are, and what their future might be" [13]. ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION IN THE LIFE SCIENCES The ecological movement in anthropology is part of a wider application of biological theory to cultural phenomena. While such applications must proceed with caution, and while obvious and important differences be? tween cultural systems and biological systems exist, on the whole this theoretical interaction can be beneficial to both subfields of the life sciences. A difficulty of ecological theory in anthropology, however, is that it has often distorted the distinct, but related, theoretical materials which should constitute the evolu? tionary viewpoint. Biologists clearly recognize the dual nature of biological theory. Mayr [14] remarks, "As soon as one goes beyond the level of purely descriptive biology, one finds two very differ? ent areas, which may be designated functional (ecological) biology and evolutionary biology." Mainx [15] calls functional-ecology and evolu? tion "two fundamental points of view" which "differ importantly in practice." Huxley [16] notes that all living systems are divided into "mechanisms for maintaining existence" and "modes of evolutionary transformation"; while the adaptation unit is in functional relationship to the environment, the reproductive unit is always "locked away and shielded from it." Von Neumann [17] offers an analysis which suggests that the division into functional ecological mechanisms of self-construction and self-maintenance, and evolutionary mechanisms of self-description, replication and emergence, is basic to the very logic of self-reproducing systems. This dichotomy of theory has resulted in the fact that "ecologists have steady-state, externalistic, gradualistic leanings whereas paleontologists espouse directional, internalistic, and episodic views" [18]. Monod [19] calls the distinction between functional-ecology and evolution "method? ologically indispensable," noting that it is "... more than a logical abstraction. It is war? ranted on grounds of chemistry. Of the two basic classes of biological macromolecules, one, that of proteins, is responsible for almost all teleonomic structures and performances; while genetic invariance is linked exclusively to the other class, that of nucleic acids." MacArthur [20] suggests that "describing the machinery" of life, and "unravelling the history" of living systems, constitute two very different intellectual undertakings; the same person seldom excels at both. The population ecologist Eric Pianka contrasts the functional ecologists' emphasis upon immediate organism environment interaction with the evolutionists' emphasis upon historical pattern. These distinct viewpoints employ differing concep? tions of time: The difference between them is in outlook, between thinking in an 'ecological' time scale (now time) or in an 'evolutionary' time scale (geological time). At the physiologist's level of approach to science, his answer is complete, as is the evolutionist's answer at his own level [21].</page><page sequence="3">223 Simpson [22] adds the insight that the causal mechanisms assumed to underlie ecological adjustment and evolutionary emergence require distinct logical and theoretical expression. Dobzhansky [23] makes a similar point, noting that, "There are in biological studies two contrasting, though complementary rather than alternative, approaches or methodologies." The biological philosopher, Marjorie Grene [24] has ex? panded upon this point. The distinct, but related, logical structures of functional ecological and evolutionary biology have also been distinguished by Rosen, von Bertalanffy, Pattee, Simoons, Thorn, Zeeman, Lewontin, and others [25]. A specific fallacious form of explanation which has plagued functiona 1-ecolog ical in? vestigation in anthropology, as it plagued classical functionalism before it, involves the improper accounting for historical origins by reference to observed or assumed functions [26]. The explanation of origins in terms of functions is formally invalid because it involves an affirmation of the consequent; a conclusion concerning the origin of a trait can validly be derived from an observation of the functions of that trait if and only if that trait is the only possible trait which can satisfy the functional imperative specified [27]. This is never the case with social and cultural systems, for we can always imagine functional alternatives which might meet the needs described. Because we have recently discussed this issue at length [28], we merely note here that this objection to functional-ecological arguments for origins is insurmountable. Harris' argument that Indian sacred cattle practices are somehow ecologically useful, and therefore came into existence, is a fallacious argument of this form. Biologists and philosophers of science fully realize that the fact that a trait, now or in the past, is or was "positive-functioned" or "adaptive" cannot be used to explain the origins of that trait. Woodger, in his classic Biological Principles [29], discussed this issue in a manner which has found its way into many introductory texts. Woodger notes that it is impossible to argue that giraffes as a species exist because, say, the environment selected for animals with long necks, etc. This argument is "utterly fallacious" because when it is presented we are never told the complex history of the environment which is assumed to explain development. More importantly, we do not know all the other complexes of traits which might also have been acceptable adjust? ments to that environment. Nor do we know why the species adapted, rather than becoming extinct or fragmenting into many daughter species. In short, the "explanation" offers us no information at all, but merely directs our attention away from the job of tracing out the actual developmental history of the giraffe [30]. Hempel and Oppenheim note that, "... the fact that a given species of butterflies displays a particular kind of coloring cannot be inferred from ? and therefore cannot be explained by means of ? the statement that this type of coloring has the effect of protecting the butter? flies from detection from pursuing birds" [31]. To argue that cow worship in India came into existence because it serves certain ecological functions is a similar "facile argument of ex post facto form without predictive force" [32] Gallie concludes that, "The truth is that in this kind of spurious 'sufficiency' explanation everything is assumed that needs to be assumed to get our alleged explanation to do its appoint work" [33]. Harris' Indian cattle hypothesis is vulnerable to this critique. Some anthropologists working in the func? tional and/or functional?ecological traditions have recognized the limits of their theoretical scheme and the need for a distinct, but related evolutionary approach to complement it. Radcliffe-Brown admitted that, "... one explati tion of a social system will be its history... Another completely different explanation will show social functioning" [34]. Similar ad? missions of the distinctiveness of historical,</page><page sequence="4">224 evolutionary explanations focusing on trans? formation, and functional-ecological explana? tions focusing on stability and maintenance, have been made by Vayda and Rappaport, Netting, Price, and Alland [35]. As Brush puts it, "... any paradigm leaves a number of im? portant problems unsolved... Within the new ecology, one of the crucial, and unsolved, problems is the relationship between homeo stasis, culture change, and evolution" [36]. In his speculations about the origins of India's sacred cattle complex, Harris has com? pletely ignored that body of theory in biology which deals with "macroevolutionary emer? gence" [37], "quantuum evolutionary progression" [38], "genetic revolution" [39], "epigenetic self-simplification" [40], and "biological catastrophe and morphogenesis" [41 ]. Major evolutionary advances show systemic similarities which transcend the particular disciplines within which they are studied [42]. Evolutionary emergence occurs with great rapidity; it is the result of internal tensions and a developmental dialectic as much as or more than a response to the external en? vironment. In social evolution the effects of the social field and the structure of "metro? polis-satellite relations" are more important than the limits imposed by physical conditions. Contrary to Harris, the emergence of food taboos can result in decreases in total energetic and nutritional efficiency for peasant farmers, for advances (dialectically) give rise to new sets of internal tensions and structural contra? dictions [43]. Harris' [44] rejection of dialectical process as "vague", "wholly super? fluous and inconsequential", and "romanticized, mysticized, partisan materialism" has led him to conclude (in an argument which is logically fallacious, misrepresents biological theory, and avoids all historical evidence that food taboos were devised by and for "millions upon millions of individual farmers." From an evolutionary perspective, no such speculation about "a process of adjustment, concession, and amelioration [in] a gradual advance to ward the good society for all citizens" [45 ] is legitimate. Evolutionary analysis requires that at each stage of system development we analyze the major components and contradic? tions, and ask the question, "Who pays? Who benefits?" THE ECOLOGY OF THE COW IN INDIA Preliminary to a consideration of the evolu? tionary factors responsible for the origin of India's sacred cattle complex, it is necessary to briefly evaluate the reliability of Harris' competing ecological account. In an examina? tion of Harris' ecological speculations con? cerning swine in Middle Eastern environments, we concluded that Harris' ecology was naive, misconceived, and, often, simply erroneous [46]. Similar objections arise when the en? vironmental explanation of India's cattle complex is considered. Harris' attempt to account for cattle practices by reference to ecological regularities assumed to be continental in scope is uninformed [47]. Areas such as the Indus River Valley, the Rajasthan desert, the Gangetic Plain, the Deccan Plateau, the coastal Ghats, and Assam differ so fundamentally from each other in physical conditions that no discernable rationale exists for speaking of the "ecology of India" in the sense in which Harris uses this term. It is clear that it is cultural unity which leads Harris to speak of India as a whole; rather than ecological condi? tions determining the cultural form, the cultural form has determined Harris' unit of ecological analysis. In fact, ecologists and biogeographers suggest that the study of single species is more appropriately pursued at the level of the micro habitat or major habitat, units that would not prove amenable to Harris' sweeping explanatory style [49]. Even if we accept the legitimacy of evaluating the utility of cattle for "India" as if that vast area were not a patchwork of microzones in which the value of cattle varies greatly, it remains unproven that present cattle</page><page sequence="5">225 management practices in India are "positive functioned" and "adaptive". Many of the phenomena which Harris identifies as positive functioned, we see as deviation amplifying mechanisms contributing to a general devolu? tion of the ecological communities of the sub? continent. Such deviation amplifying mecha? nisms have led to the progressive destruction of agricultural zones and to desertification. Thus India, like many areas of classical civiliza? tion, is far from homeostatically balanced or positively adapted; the India of today is the result of centuries of misuse. It should be understood that what we are presenting are the results of our initial investigations into these problems and they are intended only to raise questions obscured by Harris' fallacious specula? tions; we make no claim that our presentation is definitive. HABITAT DEVOLUTION AND DESERTIFICATION Harris has argued that "the least efficient way to convert solar energy into comestibles is to interpose an animal converter between plant and man" [49]. In fact, the least efficient way to convert solar energy into comestibles is to interpose bare ground between the sun and man, a process occurring over wide areas of India. Even where barren desert is not the result of current or past practices, habitats have been degraded through the development of plants of reduced utility or of plants that cannot be eaten at all by man or his animals [50]. The process of habitat devolution through ecological maltreatment has been proceeding for millenia, but Harris ignores it because it does not fit easily into his scheme of positive functions and ecological adaptations. One example of habitat devolution and desertification is the half million or so square miles which make up the Rajasthan Desert. Summarizing the opinion of the experts assembled at the New Delhi Symposium in 1952, Hora remarked, "One thing which was pointedly brought out in the Symposium was that the... desert is largely man-made*... by the work of man in cutting down and burning forests. ..(and by) the deterioration of the soils" [51]. Bryson [52] has suggested that dust may play a significant role in the expansion and maintenance of the Rajasthan Desert. On the average, away from the cities, there are 300? 800 micrograms of dust per cubic meter in the lowest 5 ? 10 km of air in this region, as com? pared with 150?200 micrograms per cubic meter in the lowest 1?2 km over Chicago [53], High human and animal populations, over the course of millenia, have led to intensive cultiva? tion and pasturage. Destruction of permanent plant cover by man and animals has led to the atmospheric dust load, which in turn increased atmospheric subsidence rates by as much as one third [54]. The sinking air masses are warmed by adiabatic compression, which greatly inhibits precipitation. In this way, human agricultural developments have interacted with unique geographical and meteorological features to turn an area comprising roughly 20% of India into desert and barren steppe, even though "the air over the part of this desert having the least rainfall has a total water content that is com? parable with that of some very rainy tropical forest areas" [55]. Today, ... the desert is growing, advancing into arable lands about half a mile a year. Where grass starts to grow, cattle, sheep, or goats eat it. Forests around the desert have been cut for firewood and for other uses of India's increasing population. Where there is no wood, people use cow dung for fuel. The destruction of ground cover, the use of manure for fuel rather than to build the soil: these too contribute to land destruction and soil movement [56]. The process which Harris sees as "positive functioned and probably adaptive" has actually resulted in the wholesale devolution of the Indian landscape. Even today, a fence built around a large field brought abundant wild grasses in two years, without planting or irriga? tion, simply by keeping out men and their animals [57]. Environmental management could push back the desert over huge areas,</page><page sequence="6">226 just as environmental mismanagement caused it to advance [58]. Who is responsible for the ecological catastrophe of the past, and who precipitates the ecological catastrophe of the future? Harris tells us this results from the "individual decisions of millions of individual farmers." We suggest that the common farmers have never had the political or ecological authority to effect such changes during the long history of Indian empire and the colonial period which followed it. The causes of habitat devolution cannot be discovered through ecological speculation. They require that we search the historical record for the answer to the question, "Who paid? Who benefited?" SOIL DEVOLUTION Even where major habitat degradation has not occurred, soil impoverishment is common? place. High animal populations result in soil compaction due to trampling and the removal of organic material which would otherwise be incorporated into the soil. The "organic matter helps among other things to make dry soil retentive of moisture... in a country like India where there is little moisture during seven or eight months of the year, the saving of all organic waste matter is as important to food production as is the saving of electrical energy in a modern industrial town where the demand exceeds the supply" [59]. Trampling and the removal of organic matter leads to compaction and erosion by increased runoff and to the reduced water absorption characteristic of wide areas of India. Both of these processes result in reduced plant production. Hence, animal overpopulation introduces a vicious cycle whose end product is "concrete-like grazing grounds" [60]. Few observers realize the ability of pasture animals to compact and degrade soils. Valentine points out, for example, that when cattle are allowed to mill about in an area to be con? verted to a reservoir, they "reduce seepage losses because the animals will trample and puddle the soil" [61]. The same effect of soil compaction occurs wherever the animal popula? tion is large, although the process may operate too slowly for its effects to be immediately ap? parent. In road construction, a common device for compacting soil, the "sheep's foot roller," was designed to have the effect of large num? bers of animals walking over a restricted area. Harris has not considered the effects of large animal populations upon the quality of India's soils, nor has he referred to the vast literature which suggests that soil quality has greatly devolved over the long course of Indian history, and especially during the colonial era. The "positive functioned" processes Harris describes in fact have destroyed much of the soil cover of the subcontinent. PLANT DEVOLUTION High intensity grazing results in the devolu? tion of plant communities to mixtures of species which have reduced growth rates, are unpalatable to animals, have reduced nutri? tional levels, or are directly toxic. As Odum notes, under conditions of overgrazing "... some grass species develop ecotypes with inherent low productivity even when trans? planted to ungrazed or experimental gardens. Under heavy grazing pressure it is of survival value for the plant to grow slowly (even when moisture and other conditions would favor rapid growth) and thus avoid being killed completely by the grazing animal" [62]. Some plants show extreme adaptations to heavy grazing. Toxic chemical compounds may be used by plants for protection from grazing and browsing animals. Relatively greater proportions of plant biomass may be transferred to the roots, or tied up in carbohydrate struc? tures that are not easy to digest. Selection under such conditions is for lowered palatabil ity and lowered nutritional levels. Greatly reduced protein content in such plants is common [63]. Dhabadgho and Shakarnarayan [64] provide</page><page sequence="7">227 an example of 10 hectares of natural grassland on the Deccan side of the Western Ghats near Poona from which grazing animals could remove the equivalent of 2,500 kg of cut yield by grazing, while a further 2,000 kg of plant bio mass was lost due to trampling. When the area was protected from use and rehabilitated, production was increased sixfold in three years. Whyte indicates that this condition is wide? spread and well recognized, "It is fully recog? nized that, over much if not most of the land surface of monsoonal and equatorial Asia, the present vegetation cover represents a low serai stage in succession" [65]. Harris does not consider plant devolution in his search for positive functions and useful adaptations. Nor does his ecological model allow for the possibility that divinely sanctioned food taboos might lead to overlarge animal popula? tions and result in ecological degradation, just as other policies have led to overlarge human populations. Instead, he claims that, "seldom, if ever" do current cultural patterns decrease total energetic and nutritional efficiency. As to causal patterns, Harris looks to the peasant him? self as the architect of his present fate. Plant ecologists, expert in analyzing both the past devolution of India's vegative cover and the propspects for its future improvement, view the situation differently: ... the natural vegetation of the ancient land of India has for millenia been exposed to a steady increase in intensity of unplanned, uncontrolled and therefore destructive use of land; what we are describing here in terms of grass cover is what was, what could be again, but certainly not what is there at the present day... We generally know what should be done to raise a degraded [ecological] community to a higher level and to maintain it there, but, as in so many parts of the tropics and sub tropics, we cannot put that knowledge into effect because of human, social and political factors beyond our control [66]. While the "social" and "political" factors may be beyond the control of the plant ecol ogist, and beyond the ken of the cultural ecol ogist, they are the ultimate determinants of plant devolution in India. To understand Indian ecology we must ask who benefited from these destructive processes in the past and who benefits from their maintenance in the present? ANIMAL DEVOLUTION Harris [67] refers to the "fantastic re? cuperative powers" and "small bodies" of Indian cattle as the efficient products of "natural selection." Domesticated animals are not the products of natural selection, they are products of artificial selection, and as such may be malformed or ill-adapted if the human social patterns which govern reproduction so determine. India's villages export bovines to urban areas. For the most part, cows and buffaloes are purchased to be employed in milk production in the cities. Dairy herds live in stalls and are fed purchased feeds as long as it is economical? ly rational to do so. Maintenance conditions are bad. In such a setting the animals purchased for export to the cities tend to be the largest, strongest, heartiest, best producing and most disease resistant. These animals, when no longer milk producing, are not returned to the rural environment. Thus, for some time, the most resistant strains have not been selected for in the countryside; rather, selection is fre? quently against the high quality animals [68]. As Freed and Freed note, cattle are so closely bound to "large markets outside (that) it is difficult to judge whether there are too many or too few of them from the point of view of their function within the village" [69]. The satellite-metropolis distortion of the natural selection of India's sacred cattle began as long ago as 300 B.C.; during the reign of Asoka Maurya India had already become "a vast conglomeration of power manipulated by the dominant will of an emperor served by a large standing army and a fairly numerous bureau? cracy" [70]. Already by this time cattle for food and transport flowed from the country? side to the towns [71 ]. Mayadas describes how</page><page sequence="8">228 rural-urban relationships have led to cattle devolution in the more recent past: ... many really good cows found their way to the slaughter house during the period between lactations. This was particularly noticeable in the neighborhood of large towns where the maintenance of dry cows for three or four months was a costly business, and where the owner consequently followed the line of least resistance. The good cow was sold for a fair price to the butcher and, with the proceeds of the sale, another good cow in milk was brought in from the outlying village. This new purchase was fed and kept in good condition so long as it was in milk, but as soon as it went dry, it was disposed of and the process repeated again and again [72]. Other evidence of devolution and inefficiency in Indian animal husbandry patterns exists. For example, Harris has argued that maintaining large numbers of cattle is necessary in order to produce an occasional calf. In fact, reproduction variation in cattle is susceptible to a very large degree of environmental, rather than genetic, control [73]. \yell maintained cattle have much higher reproductive rates and may calve year? ly; in India calving frequency may fall to levels which are a small fraction of the biological potential. In many cases, reproduction rates may be increased by decreasing cow numbers, since reproduction is so sensitive to nutritional level [74]. What Harris attempts to explain away as an efficiency resulting from ecological conditions, is in fact an inefficiency resulting from social and political conflicts and contra? dictions. Disease resistance, ability to withstand famine conditions, traction/feed ratio efficiency, strength, and many other factors all appear to be far below the possible maximum. In spite of Harris' claim that his speculations are now "largely accepted," in fact, they "are at con? siderable variance with (the findings) of the vast majority of economic and animal-husband? ry specialists who have firsthand experience in India and have wrestled with the cattle problem on a daily basis" [75]. DEVOLUTION OF HEALTH Under many of the conditions described by Harris as adaptive ill-health is promoted and a diminution of health standards occurs. The most serious of these problems relate to mal? nutrition. "In rural areas of India, as many as four out of five preschool children suffer from malnutritional dwarfism" [76], As much as 40% of India's rural population may suffer from protein-calorie malnutrition, a pattern resulting from ecological devolution [77], But less obvious vectors of illness and disease may be opened by the very customs which Harris extols. For example, Harris has com? mented upon the utility of slow burning dung fires for cooking and the use of dung as a floor and wall plaster. Such processes may contribute to the passage of disease pathogens. Brucellosis, leptospirosis, tuberculosis, and many other diseases are passed from cattle to man, and cattle dung may serve as a disease vector [78]. The scavenging behavior of cattle, which Harris admires and which includes the consumption by cattle of human feces [79], also increases such disease pathways. In general, the overly close and crowded contact between cattle and man has led in India to a devolution in health. The use of dung for fuel reflects the denuded nature of the Indian countryside more than the ecological benefits of the practice. In Rampur, Lewis [80] reported only thirty-seven trees (in a village of more than a thousand persons), each privately owned and with a fixed monetary value. The Indian peasant must be credited with devising a technique by which to cope with a countryside denuded of fire? wood, but it is egregious to suggest that the victim himself originated the extreme condi? tions under which he exists in his attempt to survive them. Even Nazi death camp prisoners exhibited adaptive and coping behavior [81]; would anyone suggest that they, too, formed their environments through their "positive functioned and probably adaptive" responses to it?</page><page sequence="9">229 Indian cattle themselves are often sickly. Epidemiological studies reveal that crowded cattle have much higher disease rates than animals kept under less dense conditions [82]. Well-fed animals are also more resistant to disease than those that are poorly fed. Crowded cattle may be forced to forage on materials contaminated with their own dung; serving as their own disease vectors as well as infecting other animals [83]. Johne's disease is a cattle malady transmitted in this way [84]. Calf mortality in the tropics is often as high as 50 per cent, reflecting the poor feeding and disease conditions prevalent in the cattle population generally [85]. "The ecology of ticks makes cattle very susceptible to them if crowded into natural grazing areas" [86]. The high fiber diet of Indian cattle, touted by Harris as ecological? ly efficient, not only increases disease risks through the interactive effects of protein and micronutrient deficiencies, it also depresses the food value of the quality feed these animals do receive. The feeding of large amounts of fibrous food depresses the digestion of all other food constituents [87]. Harris [88] languorously describes cattle subsisting "principally (upon) rice straw, wheat bran, and rice husks," but "the energy required to consume fibrous food may involve more expense of nutrients than is derived from its digestion, or its very bulk may make it im? possible for the animal to eat enough to meet its nutritional needs" [89]. Starving cattle, like starving people, are poor evidence for "positive functions". SOCIOCULTURAL DEVOLUTION AND CONFLICT IN RURAL AREAS Harris claims that, "Direct and indirect evidence suggests that in India men and bovine cattle do not compete for existence" [90]. But Rouse in his authoritative World Cattle informs us that "India is one place in the world in which cattle are eating people" [91 ]. Oddly, the evidence for both claims is buttressed with similar materials: the fact that cattle invade planted fields. For Harris, field invasions by cows are not evidence of competition or strife, but rather serve the positive function of redistributing wealth: One reason why cow love is so often misunderstood is that it has different implications for the rich and the poor. Poor farmers use it as a license to scavenge while the wealthy farmers resist it as a rip-off. To the poor farmer, the cow is a holy beggar; to the rich farmer, it's a thief. Occasionally, the cows invade someone's pastures or planted fields. The landlords complain, but the peasants plead ignorance and depend on cow love to get their animals back [92]. It is true, as Harris notes, that field invasions, are common; but these invasions are not neces? sarily accidental or occasional. As Beals [93] notes, most Indian cattle are herded, although they may sometimes be allowed to range freely. Most cattle do not belong to India's poor and destitute. As Harris informs us, "The poorest farmers own insufficient stock. Farm manage? ment studies show that holdings below 2/3 of average area account for 2/5 of all farms, but maintain only 1/4 of the total cattle on farms" [94]. It is the rural elite who control most of the cattle. Freed and Freed [95], in a study of a Hindu village in the Union Territory, conclude that the exploitation of village resources by cattle may disproportionately favor the village elites. Access to free grazing may be withdrawn by the landlords or the village council. Many cattle which are maintained by poor persons are kept through agreements with more wealthy villagers. While all the care is invested by one (poor) party, much of the profit flows to another (rich) party. Freed and Freed conclude that cows and men do compete in the Indian country? side, but it is a competition between poor men and sacred cattle. By elevating the cow to a position of sacredness, and demoting the lower castes to a position of less than human equality, ideological structures foster this competition. Harris, without documentation, paints a pic</page><page sequence="10">230 ture of cattle being resisted by the rich who oppose its benevolent redistributive function. But everywhere in India it is the rural elite who promote cow love, and, as an example from Lewis shows, it is the rural elite who determine the pattern of animal husbandry in India's villages: It is not surprising that the Bhangis have become hostile toward the Jats, as have the Camars... This hostility has been fanned by some restrictive measures which have cut down the Bhangis' source of income. The Bhangis formerly kept poultry. But the Jats were annoyed when the chickens made tracks over their freshly made cow-dung cakes, and they expressed their displeasure by manhandling some of the Bhangis. No chickens are kept nowadays. The Bhangis also used to keep pigs. But the pigs, like the chickens, were apt to stray and spoil somebody's crops. The Jats told the Bhangis that the pigs would not be allowed to drink at the village pond. Fines were imposed if pigs were found drinking there. The Bhangis therefore had to sell their pigs or else take them away to relatives in other villages. The loss of chickens and pigs meant a loss of supplementary income ? not a small matter to people so deeply in debt [96]. In his search for ecological harmony, Harris has ignored the (dialectical) contradictions, which divide the Indian village. It is the rich castes, and the rich families within castes, who benefit most from cattle who "stray". It is they who dominate village life. Cattle in such conditions not only effect the transfer of surplus from village poor to village elite, they act as a mech? anism of social control. As Diener [97] has noted in another context, the threat of cattle invasion may be sufficient to quiet the dissent of the restive poor, or to destroy the liveli? hood of those who do not show proper respect for tradition. How has Harris managed to overlook the conflict between rich and poor in the Indian countryside, evidence of which is so widespread in the literature? An answer lies in the following citation which Harris [98] has used to buttress his claim that sacred cattle are a boon to the poor. The quotation is from Mayadas' Between Us and Hunger: The situation has become so serious that it is impossible in some parts of the country to protect growing crops from grazing by wandering cattle. Years ago it was one or two stray animals which could either be driven off or sent to the nearest cattle pound. Today it is a question of constantly being harassed day and night by herds which must either feed on one's green crops, or starve. How long can this state of affairs be allowed to continue? [99]. This is cited by Harris to document his claim that the rich are suffering from the invasion of their fields by poor men's cattle. But the very next sentence in Mayadas indicates that the suf? fering is inflicted in the opposite direction, "Fencing is too costly for the average farmer and so are watchmen" [100]. Thus, the average farmer suffers while the rich can afford to protect themselv es, and even benefit from the process. And if the average farmer suffers, what about the poor one? The evidence is there, it is merely that Harris has misread it. The excessive production of cattle may benefit social elites in other ways than by directly removing surpluses from common grounds or from poor peasants' holdings, or by acting as a mechanism of social control. For example, the leather industry of India, one of the world's largest, provides profits for entrepreneurs, and exports to many foreign markets, but depends upon cattle drawn from the rural hinterlands. Hence, cows kept in large, ecologically damaging numbers or at the ex? pense of impoverished peasants, may be essential to powerful economic interests. But Harris has no eye for such social and class con? flicts. The ecology of India's sacred cattle is not marked by "positive-functioned and probably adaptive" processes; rather, it is characterized by the devolution of the habitats, soils, plant communities, domestic animals, and human health standards of the subcontinent. India's sacred cattle and the villages which they in? habit are not independent ecological Utopias; they are elements within a nested hierarchy. As such, the village and its agricultural system is liable to appropriation demands which transfer energy and nutrients out of the domain of the village poor. The regional and supra</page><page sequence="11">231 regional economic and political structures which effect such transfers have been long developing; this directional and punctuated process of cultural evolution is fueled by the very conflicts and social contradictions which Harris chooses to minimize. Modern rural India may thus be considered as a product of "devolu? tion," "involution" [ 101 ], or the "development of underdevelopment" [102]. The history of state formation, of the emergence of imperial and colonial elites, and of the involution of the rural populations upon whom they subsist, cannot be revealed through ecological specula? tion. SACRED CATTLE AND THE EMERGENCE OF EMPIRE IN ANCIENT INDIA If, in the place of universal ecological specula? tions, we seek concrete ecological studies and specific historical analyses, our task becomes more difficult. It is not as easy to replace speculation with fact as it is to speculate in the first place. We would be reluctant to publish these hypotheses drawn from our preliminary historical research on this problem, but the fact that Harris has published his opinions so often, has proclaimed that they are now "largely confirmed," and has disseminated his views widely in the popular press [103] requires answering. Prohibition and/or limitations upon animal prptein consumption are familiar from recent history. While animal protein is highly nutri? tious, it is also a relatively expensive food to produce; hence, governments have sometimes imposed animal protein prohibitions to divert resources from food consumption to other ends deemed more important. As an example, both the United States and England enacted controls upon meat consumption during the Second World War. In India, too, the British introduced strict controls upon meat consumption during World War II [104]. Meat prohibitions have also been enforced during peacetime on the sub-continent. The British colonial government introduced a "meatless day" as part of early economic plan? ning efforts [ 105]. In Muslim Pakistan, the government decreed two meatless days in the late 1950's [106]. In modern India, local, state and national governments have imposed animal protein prohibitions, and the policy of cow protection is written into the national consti? tution [107]. While Western peoples recognize the mundane economic and political constraints which inhibit their own behavior, exotic cultures and historical peoples are often explained in other terms. Although power and prices may govern modern life, we search for evidence of cognitive symmetry, religious determination, and ecological homeostasis in the lifeways of other, archaic places and peoples. Such special explanatory assumptions are unnecessary; classical states, just as modern ones, prohibited and limited consumption patterns to effect understandable political and economic goals. That such pronouncements often took religious form is reasonable, given the close association between church and state in classical empires [108]. Cases exist which indicate the utility of the assumptions outlined above. In contemporary Eastern Guatemala, for example, animal hus? bandry patterns, appropriation processes, and ritual practices function as a unified whole [109], Although exotic explanatory models have often been applied to this example, they are unnecessary and even misleading. The prohibition on swine in Islamic lands cannot be explained by reference to ecological func? tions; its more likely origin and functions in? volve the rise of empire and the transfer of grain resources from peasants to the urban and military populations which dominate them [110]. Analyses of the Anabaptist cultural tradition which focus upon religious causation and ecological adaptation are also misleading [111]; Hutterite survival reveals the primacy of political economic factors [112]. Religious motives, of course, are powerful</page><page sequence="12">232 determinants of individual behavior, and ecological factors serve as the boundary condi? tions for historical and cultural change. But cultural evolution is not the product of autonomous beliefs or environmental mechan? ics; cultural evolution results from social forces and social conflicts. In all such cases it is reasonable to assert, "Although the class struggles of that day were concealed behind a religious screen, this changed nothing in the matter, and is easily explained by the conditions of the time" [113]. The social and class conflicts which give rise to the special role of cattle in India's ideological system are neither spatially nor temporally con? stant. Different groups at different times have taken different positions regarding sacred cattle; the problem is enormously complex. One clear issue, however, involves the original conditions which generated the taboo on beef consumption. Harris has addressed this issue: It is probable that the elimination of meat eating came about in a slow, practical manner. The farmers who decided not to eat their cows, who saved them for procrea? tion to produce oxen, were the ones who survived the natural disasters. Those who ate beef lost the tools with which to farm. Over a period of centuries, more and more farmers probably avoided beef until an unwritten taboo came into existence. Only later was the practice codified by the priesthood [114]. There are a number of problems with this speculation. First, as the evolutionary biologist Lewontin tells us about all speculations con? cerning present equilibria (or assumed equi? libria) which involve the postulation of some past selective process, "... although [they] might be true, there is no way to find out" [115]. Further, as the paleontologist Gould [116] tells us, the assumption of a "slow, practical" process of origins in evolutionary thought is more a reflection of political pre? judice than it is a statement about nature. Biological evolution does not operate in this fashion; rather, periods of relative stability and gathering stress are punctuated in the pale ontological record with rapid phases of emer gent evolution [117]. Finally, this speculation ignores the historical materials which are avail? able; indeed, it distracts us from history. Why do such appeals to equilibrium states continue to be employed in fallacious arguments for origins, why must we assume that what is came to be because it is good and useful? Lewontin has given an answer for the use of these equi? libria models of origin in the biological litera? ture: Equilibria annihilate history. It is the nature of an equilibrium point that all paths in the dynamical space lead to it (at least locally), so that the particular history of change is irrelevant and, once the system is at equi? librium, there is no trace left of historical information. The desire to purge historical elements... from ex? planations... stems from sociopolitical convictions about stability that are deeply held and are characteristic of the present stage of social and political development of the West. This preoccupation with stability was quite un? characteristic of the middle of the nineteenth century, when the successful bourgeois revolution led to the prominence of notions of progress and directional move? ments in scientific theories. As the bourgeois revolution became consolidated, however, notions of progress and secular change gave way to themes of stability and equi? librium in a variety of natural and social sciences [118]. The concepts of ahimsa and the inviolability of cattle appear to have their origins in a period beginning at approximately 700 B.C., although the cow complex in its more modern form is of later date [119]. Throughout the Vedic period, beef was widely eaten and cattle were the chief sacrifical animals [120]. Earlier Vedic peoples practiced swidden agriculture and large scale herding, and Vedic politics took the form of pre-state or proto-state kinship-based societies [ 121 ]. Shortly before 600 B.C., "... the tribal organizations came into conflict with a new political phenomenon, the monarchy" [122]. Permanent settlements and intensive agriculture began to replace semi-nomadic and shifting agricultural patterns. Trade, including long? distance and intercontinental trade, began to link northern India with points as far away as the Mediterranean basin and northern China [123]. Thapar describes the period and notes,</page><page sequence="13">233 not ecologically-minded peasants "slowly and practically" deciding upon new agrarian strategies, but rather a maelstrom of contra? diction and evolution prevailed "where the big fish swallowed the little fish in a condition of anarchy": The old traditions and structures of early Aryan society had changed by the seventh century B.C. The tribal communities were giving way to... republics and monarchies with strong political ambitions. This was the atmosphere that was to produce the political doctrine of matsyanyaya, unbridled competition in which the powerful preyed upon the weak without restraint, or, to use the language of the texts ? 'where the big fish swallowed the little fish in a condition of anarchy'. Village lands were split into private holdings or owned by the local ruler, the communal owner? ship of land being on the decline. Competition in trade had intensified... There was an element of insecurity and uncertainty [124]. The emerging urban states of early India, of which the leader was Magadha, soon developed agrarian policies which emphasized political appropriation, not ecological adaptation: Magadhan theoreticians proposed a relentless conduct which might have caused any Borgia to blench; but their openly declared principal aim was to change the face of the land. The main task of their king and source of profit for the state was to clear the heavy jungle, to bring all waste? land under the plow" [ 125 ]. To accomplish these goals, servitude, slavery, and the beginnings of caste were employed. Forced resettlements of agrarian peasants were carried out under "police state methods," while an urban scene was dominated by "rich men about-town, sophisticated, leading a life of refinement and gaiety" [ 126]. As a result, huge and well-paid armies were required, but even these were unable to control the political conflicts of the period. Wars and rebellions were common; perhaps the most famous was the Kalinga rebellion in which the Mauryan emperor Asoka led his counterinsurgency forces to victory, but at the cost of some hundreds of thousands of casualties [127]. Rapid political and economic evolution also precipitated religious ferment: The changing features of social and economic life, such as the growth of the towns, expansion of the artisan class, and the rapid development of trade and commerce were closely linked with changes in another sphere; that of religion and philosophical speculation [128]. Religious changes introduced at this time, including opposition to traditional sacrifices and the promotion of ahimsa, were championed by "mercantile classes (who) were economical? ly in the ascendent" [129]. Buddhism, Jainism, and modern Hinduism, which eventually in? corporated much Buddhist practice and innova? tion, all have their roots in this period of religious change. Religious ideas emerging in India at this period reflected the interests of the elites, but not totally or completely. Further, it was in the interest of those of elevated status to seek compromise, reform, some pattern by which change might be chan? neled into a slow, practical pattern, rather than into violent upheavals. It is in this atmosphere, for example, that Buddhist ideas arise. The Buddha was born the son of a chief during the tumult of the 6th century B.C.; he brought his religious insights and persuasive powers to the nascent kingdoms of Kosala and Magadha. "Soon his name was well known throughout the Gang! Plain, and the greatest kings of the time favoured him and his followers" [130]. The Buddha taught of the danger of pride and impetuosity and of the corroding effects of anger and violence. A new world could not be shaped by angry and impetuous men; change came slowly, "one generation is affected by the deeds of the preceding one" [131], the only goal a man could reasonably strive for was to be at harmony with self and nature. In the search for harmony and equilibrium was to be found the way to progress; the whole of history could be viewed as an evolution of successive and repetitive series of adaptations, intensifications, depletions, reproductions, and, lamentably, conflicts: Over an enormous period of time imah?kalp?) it [ nature] goes through a process of evolution and decline, only to evolve once more. The cycle is divided into four great</page><page sequence="14">234 periods (asankhyey?). In the first man declines... The second is one of quiescence. In the third period evolution again begins... The fourth period is one of continuation, marked only by a regular pattern of comparative advance and decline, forming a series of lesser cycles with the greater one. The process is repeated for all eternity, but one great cycle is not exactly like the next [132]. Individuals attempt to understand their world, but this is illusion. There are patterns of adaptation and processes of adjustment which the common man cannot discern. The com? plaints of the poor reveal their ignorance of the harmony of the universe; to the peasant woman who came to the Buddha for surcease from her trials, the Buddha offered the advice that first she should seek out a household that had no difficulties. So we learn that suffering is in? evitable, but that the world is yet good: As a whole early Buddhism was the product not of the underprivileged but of very positively privileged strata. There can be no doubt, however, that its anti-hierocratic feature, namely, the devaluation of Brahmanical (Vedic) knowledge of ritual and of Brahmanical philosophy made the princes and patricians sympathetic to its teachings... The kind of salvation which was promised to the mendicant monk certainly was not one to the taste of the socially oppressed strata, which would have rather demanded compensation in the hereafter or this-worldly hopes for the future. The lay morality, however, bore the character of an extremely colorless "bourgeois" ethic as did its present rewards of riches and an honorable name. A religious "natural law" of peasant bondsmen or guild artisans would have looked quite different... However, Buddhism became one of the greatest missionary religions on earth [133]. Jainism, too, has its roots in the upper social strata, "The origin of the sect within the sphere of the ancient distinguished intelligentsia is still expressed in the assurance of the trans? mitted biography, that arhats (holy men) al? ways stem from a royal family of pure lineage and never from lower families" [134]. These religions did have conciliatory and reformist purposes; they encouraged acts of social wel? fare, and they opposed the most ruthless exploitation as counterproductive. But they hardly issued forth from the poor peasantry, although it was the poor peasant who often paid the price of their support: Though the individual monk was bound by his vows to own no property except bare necessities, and to touch no silver or gold, the monasteries grew rich on the alms of the faithful. The revenues of whole villages were alienated to them by pious kings, and even individual monks began to take their vows of poverty lightly, for more than one inscription records donations made to the Order by ordained members in it [ 135 ]. The Arthashastra provides us with an in? valuable historical resource. This work, written at the time of the ruler Candragupta Maurya (ca. 320 B.C.), is a manual of statecraft and a practical description written to guide the Mauryan emperors in their official activities. While much debate exists concerning the period of origin of the specific themes contained in the Arthashastra, it seems clear that the synthesis of old ideas and new insights took place at the formation of the Mauryan dynasty: "We may therefore conclude that there is no convincing reason why this work should not be regarded as the work of Kautilya, who helped Candragupta Maurya to come to power in Magadha" [136]. While, as with any ancient source, the Arthashastra must be used with care and subjected to historiographic scrutiny, it provides many clues to the function of those political traits characteristic of the period of birth of India's imperial age. Much of the Arthashastra deals directly with agricultural policy, agricultural settlement, cattle, imperial control over agrarian practices and food supplies. Kautilya urges the emperor to open new lands, resettle rural populations in order to provide grain supplies for the cities, and rigidly control animal numbers. He re? marks, "from the helplessness of the villages there comes the concentration of men upon their fields, hence increases in taxes, labor supply, wealth, and grain." He also remarks, "He who himself kills an animal or incites another to kill an animal... shall be executed" {Arthashastra 2, 1, 34; 2, 29-, 16) [137]. The state is the owner of large herds of cattle and other animals, with the go 'dhyaksa 'the superintendent of cattle' in charge. It need hardly be added that cattle are owned privately as well... The go'dhyaksa is to maintain</page><page sequence="15">235 a complete record of each animal in every herd belonging to the state (Arthashastra 2, 29, 8-11). Similarly, a record of all animals owned by private individuals is to be main? tained by village and district officials under the sam?hartr (2, 35, 4). Thus a complete record of the entire cattle wealth in the state is ensured... Very detailed rules are laid down about (cattle herding) (2, 29, 4-5), as also about the proper time for milking cows and buffaloes, the quantum of fodder for them and so on... In times of emergency, what the state demands is a part of the animals themselves, one-tenth of the animals owned being so claimed in the case of cattle... (5, 2, 27) [138]. Cattle were crucial to the management of the Indian empire. They were the power source upon which agricultural surplus production depended. They pulled the carts which transported products and commodities over the vast highway system constructed at that time. Bullocks were essential to the supply and functioning of the army, which numbered as many as a million men during the time of Asoka [139], and was maintained at a cost of some $20,000,000 a year. "This must have been a considerable burden for the population to bear, and the fact that it bore such a heavy burden is indicated by the numerous taxes and exactions devised by Kautalya" [140]. This set of state imperatives required care? ful regulation of the peasantry. In the recent Vedic period "beef... formed part of the regular diet" [141]. Even today, shifting agriculturalists with large herds of bovines wander the hills of Assam, and ritual feasting still occurs there. While the government wishes to settle these people and convert them from their "primitive" beliefs to a civilized pattern, they have resisted such "ecologically adaptive and probably positive functioned" assistance [142]. Frazer [143] suggested some time ago that everywhere we find animals prohibited today, they were earlier held to be sacred. The transi? tion from tribal to classical state organization cannot be assumed to have been caused by, or to have furthered, the ecological and economic adaptation of the peasantry. The peasants provided the surplus for empire, but they did not enjoy its fruits; evolution of the classical states entailed a devolution of peasant living conditions. Harris would seek the sacredness of cattle in environmental factors, but American dairy farmers care well for their cattle without complex rules and sanctions. The codification of complex rules and responsibilities regarding cattle has a more complex, social origin, and the beginnings of sanctity can already be discerned in the ancient class conflicts over animals: Y?jnavalkya lays down that the keeper shall bring back and restore to the owner the cattle exactly in the same condition in which they had been made over to him. If any of the cattle happens to die or gets lost through his carelessness, the hired keeper shall make good... Smrtis tells us the laws as regarding judging the guilt of owner or the cowherd in case of some loss or damage of a third party's crop or property was done by cattle... nobody was punishable if the cattle did damage to unfenced fields... Such disputes were settled by the elders..." [144]. Class conflicts over cattle, and the use of cattle by village elites to expropriate surplus from the poor, as observed by Freed and Freed [ 145 ] in contemporary India and by Diener [146] in Guatemala today, are of ancient and widespread origin. In a sense, the lowest peasants are considered just another species of domestic animal (in Guatemala Indians are called "animalitos" by village elites), a "species" apart from elites, a resource to be managed and controlled. But conflict and contradiction are nowhere confined to just the local level. In ancient India the formulation of rules regarding the careful husbanding of necessary reserves of cattle, but restricting the wasteful consumption of beef by the populace, were promulgated by the kings and princes. Under the Guptas, cow killing was a capital offense, a Chola king ordered executions for cow slaughter, and until recently the offense was punishable by death in Kashmir [147]. But perhaps the most interesting example is that of the Law of Piety formulated by Asoka. In the old system, sacrifice of cattle was widespread. The early Aryans had developed a</page><page sequence="16">236 religion of anthropomorphic gods, as many as thirty-three in number, who were propitiated through rites of sacrifice [148]. Such institu? tions in the aboriginal and proto-state polities discharged functional-ecological functions not unlike those redistributive and ecological func? tions assigned by Piddocke [149] and Rappaport [150] to similar rituals among more recent groups with similar social organizations (This does not imply that the origins of such institu? tions can be explained by reference to their functions; functional-ecology and evolution are distinct, but related perspectives, upon cultural and biological systems [151]). But the new system was hostile to the old redistribu tive pattern with its social equality, "With the emergence of the caste system... ritual pre? occupations... developed a lifelong pattern. And there was also the economic effects of the cult of sacrifice practiced on a large scale. It involved the destruction of innumerable heads of cattle... Indeed as time passed, the problem of ethics became urgent and insistent. Indian society was outgrowing its primitive basis and was developing into a 'national' society" [152]. One result, as we have seen, was the growth of new philosophical and theological schools. But another was the conversion of philosophy into law. ... there were high officers called the Manama tras. There were several categories of these officers and their duties were as varied as was their size numerous. They functioned in an executive as well as supervisory capacity. Some of them were in charge of provincial administrations as those in Pataliputra, Kaushambi, Samath, Samchi, Suvarnagiri, Isila, Samapa, and Tosali. Others were in charge of super? vising the conduct of women and were specially concerned with the promotion of the Asokan Law of Piety among them. There were also the Wardens of Marches (Antamahamatras), who were entrusted with supervision over the administration of the border areas and worked among the more backward sections of the population. They were also sent to the neighboring states to carry out Asoka's program of dharma. In his Rock Edict V, Asoka speaks of the appointment of a special class of officers in the thirteenth year of his reign... The inscription... gives in admirable detail the scope of the activities to be pursued by these special officers. From their title it is clear that their institution was connected with the new policy of Asoka that he calls the Law of Piety. Now the term dharma has a variety of meanings, among which code of filial conduct, morality and religion are prominent. The Morality Officers of Asoka were concerned with each of these branches of dharma... They were expected to supervise the actions of lesser officials... they were expected to supervise morality in the families, not only of common people, but also [of] the royal relatives in the capital cities and the provincial towns... For this they must have been armed with extra? ordinary powers of supervision, action, and punishment, and considering the long list of their duties their numbers must have been large. We have here, therefore, a picture of these royal officers being everywhere all the time, investigating not only public activities but also empowered to invade the privacy of households, royal and otherwise. The emperor was no doubt activated by the highest motives, but it is more than possible that his zeal created new opportunities for bureaucratic interference in the most intimate aspects of family life. The Kautalyan state was already tightly regulating the economic life of the community; to that was added this innovation of regula? tion of religious, moral, and family life by Asoka in his quest to make the sway of morality universal [153]. Provisioning a vast empire, managing its resources and peoples was a difficult and com? plex task. Like many of the ancient empires, India faced recurrent ecological catastrophes (such as famines), and soon after Asoka's reign inflation and economic decay reached destruc? tive proportions [ 154]. Economic shortage and conflict required belt tightening, rationing, controls, in that time as in our own; however distasteful, rationing could not be avoided: Asoka's prohibitory orders and regulatory command? ments... must have interfered with the lives of the people. His numerous inspectors and agents, in their zealous activities, must have created resentment against an administration that had eyes and ears all over the land, that often became arbitrary and punitive, and taxed heavily rich and poor alike... [Asoka] prohibited animals sacrifices, scoffed at popular religious rites and ceremonies, and claimed that he had mingled gods with men on this very earth [155]. Now Harris has claimed that the origins of India's complex food taboos are to be sought in the "individual decisions of millions and millions of individual farmers" [156]. But from the time of Asoka and before, until the present day, the individual farmers of India have been part of vast and evolving imperial, feudal, and</page><page sequence="17">237 colonial structures. The complexity of caste and class interactions has worked through and upon the heritage of history; it is only in a dialectical and developmental perspective that the answer can be constructed. Even today, the postures of various Indian groups towards the question of cattle reflects the class struc? ture of that society. Thus far, we have only offered an hypothesis; it remains necessary to explain the variety of patterns, ancient and extant. While the reign of Asoka coincided with the rise of an empire of unprecedented scope, the invasion of northern India by the Greeks in the second century B.C. hastened the process of disintegration. Imperial rule was replaced over much of the subcontinent by feudal institutions, control passed from the hands of urban elites to rural powers, and the Buddhism of Asoka gave way to a much altered lism incorporating many of the new ? :^ious concepts, including the prohibition 1 -on cow slaughter. India had entered the age of world history with its transition to a ate polity, and now came to play many roles that stage. New rulers, new feudal epochs, lonialism, and post colonialism waxed and ned. The problem of untangling this complex 2b of chance and necessity [157] will be ifficult, discovering the role of class conflict nd of cattle in different places and different nes will be laborious, but we have powerful tools to aid us in our work; tools labeled by Harris "vague," "superfluous," "inconsequen? tial" [158]. CONCLUSION The misinterpretations, logical lapses, empirical errors, and theoretical shortcomings of Harris' ecological theories concerning the origins of food taboos in political societies are considerable, yet his work has been lauded by laymen and scientists alike. We conclude that his speculations meet widespread ideological needs in the contemporary West; if present cultural forms in post-colonial societies are in fact adaptive, if change results from nature rather than conflict, if transcendent ecological science can unlock the secrets of society, if progress is truly "gradual and practical", then perhaps the fears that devil the contemporary scene are unwarranted and a technical, environ? mental solution possible. As Bronowski warns, however, "The quality of life... must not be fixed to mean what happens to be agreeable to the kind of men that we are now ? conser? vatives who like to play at being conserva? tionists. .. The danger of this phony naturalism... is that it points the young away from the true ills of the state, to those lesser targets that the chamber of commerce can shoot at, too" 159]. The origins of India's sacred cattle, while far from fully explained, are clear in outline. So, too, are the white elephants left over from the imperial, feudal, colonial and neocolonial past. These are the conditions of hunger, crowding, illness, exploitation, and ecological devolution within which Harris finds evidence of "positive functioned and probably adaptive" traits and institutions. Less well recognized is the red herring of naive cultural ecology, whose focus on a world that never was distracts us both from what actually was, and what could be. Yet, in the full flush of his acceptance by those who manage resources and prestige in corporate America, Harris asserts that the cultural materialist, "lacks only time, money and staff to prove this theory; given sufficient resources we could develop intersubjectively valid and culture-free descriptions of cultural things" [160]. This task is chimerical and dangerous; knowledge that attempts to be "culture free" is inevitably inhuman. Truth is a constituted reality, emerging through dialec? tical dialogue; it, too, is a product of struggle and conflict. No "ethic" and elitist social "scientist" can provide us with a transcendent road to its acquisition. But then, the biologists whom Harris and other reductive materialists seek to emulate, know this:</page><page sequence="18">238 Without a priori preferences, we would scarcely be human; and good science, as Darwin noted so often, collects data to test ideas. Science has long recognized the tyranny of prior preference, and has constructed safeguards in requirements of uniform procedure and replication of experiments. Gross flouting of procedure and conscious fraud may often be detected, but unconscious finagling by sincere seekers of objectivity may be refractory. The culprit in this tale is a naive belief that pure objectivity can be attained by human beings rooted in cultural tradi? tions of shared belief - and a consequent failure of self examination. One may argue that lying with statistics is easier than fudging an experiment and that a direct intersection with contemporary politics makes for a more passionate a priori, but I think that most scientists pursue their private battles with as much ardor and as much at stake. I propose no cure for the problem of finagling... The only palliations I know are vigilance and scrutiny [161], NOTES 1 Marvin Harris, "The Cultural Ecology of India's Sacred Cattle," Current Anthropology, vol. 7 (1966), pp. 51-66; M.
