At regional of the a new end centers, of type the of second territorial constituting millennium organization, the expression b.c., large ap- regional centers, constituting the expression of a new type of territorial organization, ap- peared in various zones of Middle America, from Guerrero to the Gulf Coast. Emerging from a rather homogeneous social landscape of independent farming villages, these new regional centers were greater in size, and with higher population densities and more varied functions, than earlier villages and were able politically and economically to control their surrounding territories. Behind this observable archaeological phenomenon, characteristic of the emergence of Mesoamerican civilization, lay a plurality of interrelated factors and accu- mulated changes that had occurred since early Holocene times. As suggested by general archaeological evidence, and by the study of Helladic Greece in particular, the term " civilization" is not necessarily synonymous with "urbanism." In Mesoamerica, "civilization" can be related to the rise of cities, centers of regional integration, that I have defined elsewhere (Niederberger 1987) in the Latin sense of caput rather than urbs. Certain criteria considered necessary to identify the emergence of cities in Old World archaeology, such as writing or metalworking, do not apply in Mesoamerica. If we postulate that a community attains the status of a city when one can observe the coexistence of (1) some forms of elaborated political and religious power, (2) clear social ranking, (3) planned public architecture, (4) a group of highly specialized craftspersons, (5) control and active participa- tion in interregional trade networks, and (6) complex intellectual achievements such as a sophisticated, codified iconography for the per- manent recording of certain concepts or events, then we must accept that cities were already emerging in Mesoamerica at the end of the sec- ond millennium b.c. The data described here indicate that this was certainly the case for some sites in the Basin of Mexico. At the same time period we also observe, in numerous zones, the development of a distinctive style and iconography based on the crystallization of a set of beliefs that would eventually con- stitute the roots of the Mesoamerican mental universe. Since the 1930s, this particular stylistic ex- pression has been designated Olmec , a name even then considered misleading by pioneer researchers such as Wigberto Jiménez Moreno (1959: 1022). Over time, the semantic ambi- guity of Olmec has greatly increased, especially for scholars working outside the Gulf Coast (Niederberger 1976: 265-266; Grove 1989), as it also implies the belief in a one-way, direct or indirect impact from Gulf Coast inhabitants on other Mesoamerican communities. In opposition to this postulate, I have pro- posed a nondiffusionist model that explains the relative homogeneity of iconography and related beliefs in Early Formative societies by a long-established dual system of interregional exchanges of commodities and information between culturally dynamic groups in differ- 169</page><page sequence="3">IJO NIEDERBERGER ent regions of ancient Mesoamerica (Nieder- berger 1974b; 1976: 265-266). Within this conceptual framework, my corol- lary contention is that each regional entity par- ticipating in the gradual buildup of this specific cultural configuration or early facet of Meso- american civilization pertained to a similar level of sociocultural complexity (Niederberger 1976: 265-266; 1987: 732-752). Consequently, I do not use the now unavoidable term Olmec to allude to unicentric theories of Olmec colo- nizers or to refer to a particular people. Instead, I limit its use to two concepts: "style," in a Saussurian linguistic sense, and, more broadly, "civilization," defined in this context as pan- Mesoamerican and multiethnic in nature. In this brief synopsis of the Basin of Mex- ico's pre-800 b.c. archaeological levels, I limit my discussion to a few general comments con- cerning the variety and productivity of ancient landscapes, the evidence related to a socio- political organization based on clearly ranked societies, from the end of the second millen- nium onward, and the concomitant develop- ment of regional centers, earthen architecture, complex codified graphic symbols, craft spe- cialization, and the dynamic implications of interregional trade and exchange systems. It is worth stressing that since the pioneer work of Miguel Covarrubias, the chronological frame- work and sequence of the pre-Teotihuacán soci- eties of the Basin of Mexico have drastically changed (Tolstoy and Paradis 1970; Tolstoy 1978; Niederberger 1970, 1976, 1987), and a long- lasting in situ development, from archaic times onward, has been uncovered (Niederberger 1979). It also seems that the systematic twen- tieth-century destruction of crucial zones of Early Formative sites has led many scholars to a certain blindness concerning the dynamic and precocious Basin of Mexico communities within the nascent Mesoamerican interaction sphere, despite the data published in this field. Paleoenvironments of the Basin of Mexico Today the Basin of Mexico environment offers but a withered image of the singular ecological bounty of past landscapes, a fact too often over- looked by Mesoamericanists unfamiliar with this region. In my study of Basin of Mexico paleo- landscapes and ancient economy (Niederberger 1987: 46-168), I have analyzed the components and high productivity of this remarkable zone for the pre- 1 900 period, the time before drainage of the lakes, deforestation, erosion, and chemical and organic pollution trans- formed this ancient Eden into an ecological disaster. To deal with the emergence of com- plex societies in temperate lacustrine basins, such as the Basin of Mexico, it is useful to move beyond the traditional view that divides Middle America into two broad ecological zones: the "semi-arid" highlands and the "fer- tile" lowlands. This dichotomy has sparked</page><page sequence="4">i. Basin of Mexico, Chalco area: (a) restoration of ancient freshwater lacustrine expanses in the eastern zone of the Chalco subbasin, dominated by snowy Iztaccihuatl volcano; today, coots, shovelers, spoonbills, herons, and other aquatic birds find their traditional ecological niche; (b) representation of freshwater white fish (Chirostoma humboldtianum), characteristic of ancient Lake Chalco fauna, incised on a white-slipped vessel from the Manantial phase (1000-800 b.c.) of Tlapacoya- Zohapilco Author photographs irrelevant and unfruitful debates, the principal one being the controversy between those who view the origins of complex societies in the lowlands and those who concede priority to the highlands. The issue is more complex as such a dichot- omy can be observed within the Basin of Mex- ico itself. The northern part of the basin, as well as the eastern regions of Texcoco located in a rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada, shows a relative dryness, with intermittent rivers. In these regions, the first significant human occu- pation dates to between 1000 and 800 b.c. and parallels the development of irrigation systems (Nichols 1982); I have termed this period the Manantial phase (Niederberger 1974a). In con- trast, and this point deserves emphasis, the western and southern regions of the basin were among the most favorable habitats in Middle America in pre-Hispanic times for the estab- lishment of a sedentary way of life and devel- opment of early complex societies (see table 2 and Niederberger 1979). The western area re- ceived all the rain discharge from the clouds coming over the Sierra Nevada, and, with this high rainfall, good humic and volcanic soils, as well as numerous perennial rivers (now piped and drained northward), made this zone favorable for early agriculture. Archaeological evidence demonstrates that the zone was ex- ploited by large agrarian communities since at least the middle of the second millennium b.c. at sites such as Tlatilco. As for the landscape of the southern part of the basin (fig. 1), it was deeply marked by the presence of a large freshwater lake, nurtured by important perennial rivers and numerous springs. The lacustrine area was surrounded by fertile forest soils (today below the Pedre- gal lava flow) and rich alluvial deposits in the southeast. These included the Chalco plains, famous in protohistoric times for their high productivity and prized varieties of maize. Both archaeological and ethnohistoric data indicate the profusion and variety of ancient faunal resources in this region, particularly of fish and resident and migratory waterfowl. This zone was occupied by sedentary settlements by the end of the sixth millennium b.c., as shown by archaeological work carried out at the Tlapa- coya-Zohapilco site, and eventually became the setting of complex intensive agrosystems (Armillas 1971) and one of the most heavily occupied regions of Pre-Columbian America. The Basin of Mexico Formative Sequence: Past and Present Within the interpretive schemes of Early For- mative Mesoamerica, of all the areas con- cerned, "it is perhaps the Basin of Mexico that has been most unfairly treated" (Flannery and Marcus 1994: 390). Kent Flannery and Joyce Marcus comment further on the Basin of Mex- ico environment: "It is now clear that it could not have been the high, cold, marginal area it was once portrayed to be" and that its inhabi- tants "produced some of the best and most sophisticated ceramics of the early horizon" (Flannery and Marcus 1994: 390). If so, the natural question that arises is why the basin developments have been misconstrued and misunderstood for so long. The fact that the Basin of Mexico played a significant role in the emergence of pan- Mesoamerican technoeconomic strategies and cultural patterns at the end of the second mil- lenium b.c. has long been obscured by a series of unfortunate occurrences. First, a critical mis- interpretation, the inversion of the relative and absolute chronology of the pre-Teotihuacan occupations (an error repeated in all the archae- ological literature from the 1940s to the late 1960s), led to the false conviction that the late El Arbolillo-Zacatenco sites, excavated by George Vaillant in the 1930s (Vaillant 1930, 1935 ), represented not only the "first villages" of the basin (wrongly dated to about 2000-1500 b.c.) but also characterized the cultural stasis and primitiveness of the region during the For- mative period. It is worth noting here, however, that at the time of his investigations Vaillant did not ascribe such an antiquity to his sites. He qualified them as "Middle or Intermediate Cultures." Nevertheless, in the 1940s, when Olmec-style ceramic vessels and figurines were discovered in the basin, first at Tlatilco, they were considered to be coeval with Zacatenco cultures and to reflect unmistakable evidence of culturally more advanced intruders, among primitive peasant (Zacatenco) societies (Covar- rubias 1950). Today a coherent set of radiocarbon dates and excavations carried out in the Basin of Mexico from the end of the 1960s onward has swept away the view of early Zacatenco primi- tive villages, and supposed external influence upon them, and has exposed the erroneous assumption of exogenous-elite/local-peasantry niederberger 171</page><page sequence="5">Table i.

Excavations carried out at Tlapacoya-Zohapilco led to the detection and definition of the following cultural phases: Playa I and II, Zohapilco, Nevada, Man- antial, and Tetelpan (Nieder- berger 1976, 1979, 1987). The Ayotla phase was first named and dated by Paul Tolstoy at Tlapacoya- Ayotla (Tolstoy and Paradis 1970) and then amply documented through the study of the Tlapacoya- Zohapilco site archaeological finds. At this site, the analy- sis of the Manantial level components indicates that Robert Heizer's Tertium Quid (1958), as well as the Tlatilco style assemblage first described by Román Piña Chan (1958) and by Muriel Porter (1953) - and for decades enigmatic as to their cultural affinities and chronological positions - can now be ascribed to this important post- Ayotla and pre-Zacatenco cultural phase. The upper limit of the Tetelpan phase can be esti- mated at c. 700 or 600 b.c. Names and definitions of the Zacatenco and Ticomán phases derive from George Vaillant's pioneer investiga- tions at Zacatenco (1930), El Arbolillo (1935), and Ticomán (1931). Vaillant considered that the artifacts were already highly elabo- rated, and, in the absence of absolute dating, he qualified Zacatenco-Ticomán levels as "Middle Cultures," that is, intermediate between still unknown earlier cultural levels and proto-Teotihuacán deposits, today well defined in numerous studies (Man- zanilla 1988). However, in pioneer times from 1942 on, the great artist and researcher Miguel Covarru- bias (1950, 1957), and his immediate followers, held the postulate that the El Arbolillo-Zacatenco levels corresponded to the most ancient agrarian and egalitar- ian villages in the basin, dated c. 1500-2000 b.c., villages later colonized by a sophisticated elite from the Gulf Coast. Now the se- quence has been reversed. The Ayotla phase precedes the Zacatenco levels by 500 to 600 years, and today's data show that the Ayotla ranked societies developed in situ, in the context of a pan-Meso- american and multidirec- tional interregional exchange system of goods and ideas. relationships at Tlatilco. We now know that Zacatenco occupations date some six hundred years after the first Olmec-style stratigraphie levels in the basin and were contemporaneous with proto-urban centers such as Cuicuilco (table 1). Notwithstanding the recent data on the Early Formative, the belief that Formative sites of the basin, such as Tlatilco, were simple villages inhabited by relatively egalitarian vil- lagers still persists in many recent publications. In other words, it is not fully understood that the impact of this new perspective goes well beyond the field of chronological reappraisals; it affects the very basis of our knowledge of the sociopolitical and cultural nature and dy- namics of the ancient Formative communities of the Basin of Mexico. The continuing repe- tition and reification of this factual error is probably due, in part, to the fact that few early structural remains have survived the destruc- tive effects of three successive and powerful urban centers of pre-Hispanic and modern times: Teotihuacán, Tenochtitlán, and Mex- ico City. This could be seen as the fate of many archaeological sites, but in this specific case, it must be noted that the "coup de grâce" has been struck in quite recent times and could have been avoided. Two Formative Regional Centers One of the tragedies of Pre-Columbian archae- ology has been the relatively recent, system- atic destruction in the Basin of Mexico of Olmec-style horizon, regional centers such as Tlatilco and Tlapacoya. The astonishing dis- interest in the Formative period altogether remains evident today at the still poorly under- stood Cuicuilco site, arguably the earliest urban center in the basin, where a commercial multistoried building has just been built right in the middle of the archaeological site. (It seems as surrealistic and incongruous as if one were to discover, one morning, a modern sky- scraper at Teotihuacán nestled between the pyramids of the Sun and Moon.) Tlatilco Tlatilco, a site massively looted since the 1930s for masterpieces of Formative ceramic art, was very well situated in the western Hondo River fertile plains and adjacent foothills. Long erro- neously considered as a burial site and the most important necropolis of Formative times, Tla- tilco was, in fact, a city with public structures. These structures included clay-surfaced earthen platforms, as apparent in the observation of mounds, terraces, and steps in the profiles of fresh cuts at the site exposed during excava- tions dedicated to the explorations of burials (Porter 1953 and personal communication). Cross-correlations of ceramic artifacts with the master sequence recently established for Tlapacoya-Zohapilco indicate that Tlatilco had a significant population between 1200 and 700 b.c. But the site, a clay source for brickmaking, has been destroyed, and most of its material evi- dence - including domestic and nondomestic earthen structures and foundations, refuse mid- dens, bell-shaped pits, and hundreds of burials associated with these features - has been removed during sixty years of continuous loot- ing. What is left of Tlatilco now lies beneath highways and factories. Fortunately, the study of more than four hundred burials, rescued during several field seasons of excavations carried out from 1942 to 1969 (Covarrubias 1950, 1957; Pina Chan 1958, 1971; Romano 1967; Porter 1953, n.d.; Lo- renzo 1965; Faulhaber 1965; Garcia Moll et al. 1991), offers irreplaceable and extremely valu- able evidence concerning the clearly ranked societies of that time, their material and cul- tural wealth, the arts and knowledge of their craftspersons, and their involvement in long- distance exchange (Niederberger 1987: 677- 692). Analysis of the contents of 213 burials by Muriel Porter (n.d.) reveals the hierarchical nature of Tlatilco society (Niederberger 1987: 704-709). This sample of Ayotla and Manan- tial phase burials includes those lacking non- perishable offerings (nos. 11, 24, 25, 27, 57, and 73), those with just a few sherds (nos. 19 and 29), graves with three or fewer pottery vessels (nos. 23, 26, and 83), individuals with special- ized tool kits of bone needles and awls (nos. 28, 30, 40, and 168), graves with rich and var- ied offerings but no exotic goods (nos. 42, 29, 79, and 90), and other burials with opulent offerings containing imported items such as seashells, jadeite and serpentine celts and orna- ments, and iron-ore mirrors (nos. 10, 37, 60, 137, and 172). Finally, the existence of rich infant burials with exotic goods, such as Bur- ial 161, is testimony of a system of inherited NIEDERBERGER I73</page><page sequence="7">status. Burials with exotic items, such as the famous Burial 154 reported by Arturo Romano (1967), document the systematic importation to the Basin of Mexico of prized commodities through regular, interregional exchange systems. Burial 154, a male individual with cranial deformation and intentional dental mutilation, attested on only 3 percent of the exhumed indi- viduals (Faulhaber 1965: 89), is but one example of the systematic acquisition by residents of Tlatilco of foreign goods. Offerings included faceted quartz "polishers" or amulets, ground to a near optical polish, similar to those reported from Guerrero (Griffin 1981: 218-219), jade ear- plugs, graphite, bitumen, and an effigy vessel of an acrobat (Romano 1967). It is worth recall- ing, also, a particular burial with splendid funerary offerings, reported in Tlatilco in the 1940s, consisting of 806 blue-green jade beads, some carved in squash forms, and 20 light green jade beads associated with a bowl of red ocher, pieces of iron ore, and twelve Manantial phase, fine pottery vessels. The great archae- ologist Pedro Armillas made a study of the drill holes of the beads and concluded that it was the largest jade necklace ever discovered at that time in the Americas. Within Tlatilco elite funerary offerings, the presence of seashell is particularly noteworthy, as evident by the important report of 214 buri- als of Tlatilco field season IV (1962-1969) described by Roberto Garcia Moll and his col- leagues (1991). Three radiocarbon dates are asso- ciated with field season IV excavations. These dates of 1230 ± 120 b.c., 1140 ± 100 b.c., and 970 ± 80 b.c. (see Garcia Moll et al. 1991: 13) fit well within the time span of the Ayotla and Manantial phases defined at Tlapacoya. Marine shell burial offerings include conchs and pen- dants, bracelets, beads, and zoomorphic plaques made of the nacreous pearl oyster (Pinctada mazatlanica) of the Pacific Coast, whose importance within Formative exchange net- works has already been described by Jane Wheeler Pires-Ferreira (1976, 1978b). Entire valves were also valued and stored at Tlatilco, as demonstrated by the presence of complete shells within offerings of Manantial phase Bur- ial 27, together with a pearl oyster triangular pendant and 54 beads of serpentine (Garcia Moll et al. 1991: 27-28). Marine turtle shells (Pseudemys sp.) as well as remains of regional fauna such as mountain lions (Felis concolor ), owls (Bubo viiginianus), turkeys, ducks, and pelicans are also reported in mortuary offer- ings or in excavations (Alvarez 1976). It is fas- cinating to observe that, along with ducks, grebes, spoonbills, and herons, pelicans are today making a notable return in the ecologi- cal reserve near Texcoco (fig. 2). In sum, Tlatilco mortuary data indicate that the social group was segmented into categories having unequal access to certain resources, particularly to long-distance trade items. All the characteristics discussed by Joseph Tainter (1978) for distinguishing hierarchical societies were present, in particular, considerable indi- vidual variation of offerings, with no coinci- dence with age or sex, and evidence of inherited social status as evident in child burials with prized exotic goods. Tlapacoya The Formative site of Tlapacoya, located on an ancient island (fig. 3a) in Lake Chalco, has also been the target of irremediable destruc- tion. In pre-Hispanic times, and until 1900 when the lacustrine expanses were artificially drained, Tlapacoya was surrounded by the freshwater Chalco-Xochimilco Lake and was exceptionally rich in edible resources, such as fish including Atheiinidae, Goodeidae and Cyprinidae families, amphibians, as well as a considerable number of species of resident and 2.

In pre-Hispanic times the volcanic island of pink andesite of Tlapacoya reflecting in the lake would have constituted an impressive sight and may have been conceived, with its grottoes and springs, as a sacred place, as were other isolated dome-shaped mountain sites (see Ortiz and Rodriguez, this volume,- Grove, this volume). For the last fifty years, Tlapacoya has been exploited as an andesite quarry, the rock being blasted free with dynamite. It came as a sur- prise in 1992, therefore, to discover some paint- ings left on untouched zones of the nearby cliff. Some of them seem to pertain to the Olmec- style horizon period, such as the representation of a chubby chin, baby-face profile and oval cartouche with cross-hatching (fig. 3b). These designs are similar to some on pottery found in archaeological deposits. Tragic for our understanding of highland early regional capitals has been the eradication of the Tlapacoya ancient Formative zone, in large part bulldozed away in 1958 to provide building material for the Mexico-Puebla high- way. In the process, a large-scale earthen plat- form, which projected eastward from the hill toward the ancient lake (of which some exter- nal limits can still be observed), was destroyed. People aware of the site's significance bought, at that time, complete pieces and also sacks of earth from which to sort out any artifacts. Now Olmec-style horizon ceramic vessels, figurines, greenstone celts (fig. 5 a), jade and serpentine ornaments, seashell bracelets and pendants, iron-ore mirrors (fig. 5b), and other elaborate burial offerings that were associated with this structure are in the Roch Collection, donated to the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), in local private haciendas, and in Mexican and American museums, such as the Museum of the American Indian in New York (Porter 1967). At the edge of this devastated zone has remained, by luck, the Ayotla zone excavated by Paul Tolstoy and the Zohapilco ancient shores, where I have excavated a long series of human occupations that span six millennia. In 1967, Tolstoy was the first scholar to observe in the deep deposits of Tlapacoya of his Ayotla excavation that the Olmec-horizon artifacts were situated well below the El Arbolillo- Zacatenco levels containing C type figurines (Tolstoy and Paradis 1970). This crucial discov- ery of the true Formative sequence was con- firmed by radiocarbon dating. But the fact that the Ayotla excavation was of reduced size, yielding only twenty-eight figurines (Reyna Robles 1971), and was excavated by artificial levels, resulting in some mixing between dis- tinct deposits, constituted an obstacle for build- ing a convincing post-Ayotla sequence and placing the cultural deposits within a broader economic and ecological context. Moreover, the excavation was stopped just below the NIEDERBERGER I75</page><page sequence="9">Ayotla levels, giving the impression that this cultural level, with its sophisticated potteries, was a result of external influence. Definition of a Long Sequence of Regional Development at Tlapacoya-Zohapilco The excavations sponsored by the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia that I car- ried out some years later in the Tlapacoya- Zohapilco ancient lacustrine shores followed the natural and cultural stratigraphy and inter- preted these strata within a multidisciplinary approach. Excavations yielded 709 figurines, 130,000 sherds, and nearly 6,000 lithic artifacts (Niederberger 1976, 1987, 1996a). The evidence first permitted me to define a pre-Ayotla ceramic cultural level that I named Nevada. Nevada phase artifacts show many similarities with those of the Tierras Largas phase of Oaxaca (Flannery 1976; Flannery and Marcus 1994; Winter 1984). The excavation also allowed me to define two post-Ayotla occupations: the well-documented and important phase that I named Manantial and the Tetelpan phase (a period of Olmec-style deculturation), both pre- ceding the El Arbolillo-Zacatenco-Ticomán lev- els originally defined by Vaillant. The recovered artifacts also permitted the amplification of the original definition of the Ayotla phase (see table 1). But most interesting was the discov- ery at Zohapilco of a series of archaic and pre- pottery levels (Playa I, Playa II, and Zohapilco phases) dating from the sixth millennium b.c. onward. These levels allow assessment of the regional development of sedentary life, the agrarian economy, and the direct antecedents to pre-urban settlements. I have reported in Science (Niederberger 1979) the technoeconomic and cultural charac- teristics of these early occupations. In brief, paleoenvironmental data and faunal and pollen analyses show that Chalco lakeshore com- munities of Playa I and Playa II times had direct or ready access to spatially close and diversified biotopes (rich lacustrine environment, humic alluvial soils, and pine-oak-alder forests) and that all were actually exploited (see table 2). The year-round regular distribution of natural food resources during the bioclimatic optimum of the Playa phases, together with the attested early manipulation of certain plants, such as teosinte, amaranths, Cucurbita , and Physalis, led Playa peoples to a sedentary occupation of their territory. The artifact assemblage of Playa times consists of andesite macroblades and grinding stones, notched basalt tools, blunt- backed knives and scrapers, obsidian cores, uti- lized flakes, and projectile points, as well as wooden tools, such as small, burnished pointed sticks - probably part of combs - and long sticks with burned and ground distal ends. The following Zohapilco phase, apart from showing an irreversible trend toward an expand- ing agrarian economy, with cultivated plants such as Amaranthus leucocarpus, chayóte (a plant of the genus Sechium), and Capsicum annuum, is characterized by the presence of stone bowls and the development of standard- ized grinding stones, with basalt one-hand manos of excellent craftsmanship.

Global structural analyses have interestingly shown the independent re- currence of the "mute" (without mouth) and "multi-eyed" figurines, with armless colum- nar body, in homotaxial - but not necessarily contemporaneous - prepottery levels, in par- ticular in Eurasian early Neolithic cultures (see fig- 4)- The most ancient pottery levels known at present in the Basin of Mexico correspond to the Nevada phase of the Tlapacoya-Zohapilco sequence. These occupations date to 1360 ± no b.c. (radiocarbon time), or 1675 B C- ± I4° (sidereal time). The ceramic assemblage has a significant proportion of fine vessels with thin walls, tecomates with fine vertical grooves, flat- based dishes, and bottles. Plastic decoration of vessels included rocker stamping and fine in- cisions of clustered, parallel lines on the inte- rior bases of flat-bottomed dishes. The most common painted decoration is represented by red-slipped geometrical motifs, often with spec- ular hematite, on light brown ware. In summary, this multimillennial trajectory offers the first possibility to perceive, through the study of fossil pollens, macroplant remains, and their dated cultural contexts, some aspects of the regional development of an agrarian economy, as well as the natural and manmade evolution of paleolandscapes, through a long diachronic perspective. It also permits us to follow the gradual in situ development toward the specific technoeconomic and cultural com- plexity observed in the Basin of Mexico at the end of the second millennium b.c. The Rise of Regional Centers, Complex Belief Systems, and Iconography Site Distribution and Function With the rise and development of regional cen- ters in the Basin of Mexico during the Ayotla and Manantial phases, quantitative and quali- tative changes took place (Niederberger 1987: 704-717). Current data, including those from archaeological excavations, surveys (Parsons 1971; Parsons et al. 1982), and salvage oper- ations, have led to a better understanding of the distribution and, in certain cases, the rela- tive size of contemporaneous Early Formative sites. Information on site composition and dis- tribution suggests the existence of a growing hierarchy among sites, beginning about 1250 b.c. (Niederberger 1987: 728-729 and figs. 600- 601). Tlapacoya, Tlatilco, and perhaps one sub- Pedregal site, apparently were higher-order sites in the Basin of Mexico; they were greater in size, sustained greater and denser populations, and supported more varied activities and func- tions than contemporaneous villages and ham- lets. Leaders of these larger communities were able to control, politically and economically, a constellation of smaller satellite villages in their surrounding territories (Niederberger 1987: 692-704).

Tlapacoya (Basin of Mexico), Ayotla phase (1250- iooo b.c.), clay figurine (ht. = 20.5 cm) wearing sophisticated ball-game paraphernalia, including wrist and ankle bands, waist yoke with a circular ornament (perhaps a concave iron-ore mirror), hip pads, and elaborate tier headdress Photograph: Victor Lagarde, courtesy of Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México fits a general trend observable throughout ancient Mesoamerica toward the end of the second millennium b.c. and reflects the devel- opment of new types of settlement units and territorial organization (Bray 1978: 94). As to the size of ancient Formative capitals (caput, not urbs) in the Basin of Mexico, more information is badly needed. The installation of water mains around Mount Tlapacoya allowed me and my students, on several occa- sions, to map and estimate the spatial distri- bution of Ayotla, Manantial, and Tetelpan phase artifacts (Niederberger 1987: 697-704; Gámez Eternod 1993). Salvage operations car- ried out at Tlapacoya in 1992 by the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, and di- rected by Olivia Torres, discovered Manantial phase stone and earthen structures associated with "Pahuacan"-style figurines. Based on these observations, it now seems that my 1987 estimate of 35 hectares for Manantial phase Tlapacoya was too conservative and should probably be doubled to 70 hectares. As to the important site of Coapexco, during the Ayotla phase it is estimated to have been 50 hectares in extent (Tolstoy and Fish 1973). All these data on site size and complexity indicate the existence of a growing hierarchization among communities and villages from 1250 b.c. on- ward (Niederberger 1987: 728-729, figs. 600- 601). Archaeological Information from Figurines Although ancient Formative public architec- ture remains have been destroyed, a coherent set of evidence indicates such features were present at Tlapacoya and Tlatilco. Specific groups of figurines and iconographie elements show that these major sites were the settings of elaborate public ceremonies. These cere- monies may have included the Mesoamerican ritual ball game, as suggested particularly by the Tlapacoya evidence. At that site I found, in Ayotla and early Manantial strata, a large number of unusually dressed figurines, already known to occur in great numbers there (Coe 1965; Bradley and Joralemon 1993). Many of them wear sophisticated ball-game parapher- nalia, including wrist and ankle bands, heavy protective belts or waist yokes, often adorned with what appears to be a concave iron-ore mir- ror, hip pads, and impressive multitier head- dresses (fig. 6). Other, more enigmatic figures also portray extremely elaborate attire - with no apparent relationship to the ball game - that may have signaled specific political/reli- gious events (Niederberger 1987: 439, fig. 288). Ayotla levels are characterized by Pilli- and Isla-type figurines described at length in earlier works (Niederberger 1987: 417-444). They cor- respond to the ancient C9 group (Covarrubias 1957, fig. 8) figurine category long utilized by archaeologists when it was believed that Vail- lanťs Zacatenco C1-C2 type figurines were anterior to them. The sequence must now be NIEDERBERGER I79</page><page sequence="13">7 .

The interesting point for our theme is that some large-sized, hollow or solid figu- rines of the Pilli group, although rendered fol- lowing the stylistic canons of the type, offered nevertheless singular and individualistic fea- tures and could correspond to actual portraits of eminent persons. These representations are sometimes associated with a sophisticated sign, inscribed on the back side of their head, such as the four-elongated-sides lozenge, known as a "star" symbol (fig. 7a). As shown by com- plete or semicomplete specimens, the figurines are generally male and range in height from 20 to 40 centimeters. The head is totally or par- tially shaved and displays a high grade of inten- tional cranial deformation (fig. 7b). We still lack information - through study of osteolog- ical remains - to determine whether inten- tional cranial deformation was a relatively general practice or was the exclusive preroga- tive of high-status members of the commu- nity. Shaved, deformed heads can also be observed on more standardized Pilli figurines, but these smaller figurines more commonly show a large variety of headdresses, including "helmets" and "turbans." Masked Tlapacoya and Tlatilco figurines can be classified into several categories. Most common are the representations of musicians, dancers, and actors with particular disguises, which strongly evoke the existence of cofradía- type associations (civic-religious groups that channel wealth communitywide through cere- monies and fiestas, while also conferring status and prestige) with specific ritual responsibili- ties, engaged in public performances at given dates, such as observed with historical Amer- indian groups (see Flannery 1976: 336; Nieder- berger 1987: 710-711). More sporadic are sophisticatedly dressed and masked person- ages that evoke specialized religious agents who temporarily embody a supernatural cate- gory of the mythological system. Noteworthy figurines of this category, whose faces are char- acterized by large quadrangular or round eyes as well as a central pointed tooth with lateral curving fangs, associated in Tlatilco with a U- bracket symbol, seem to be related to a pris- tine expression of a rain icon (see Reyna Robles n.d.: 304; Niederberger 1987: 435, 712; Taube 1995: 98). The Iconography and Information of Pottery Vessels and Stamps The regional centers of Tlapacoya and Tlatilco may also have become focal points for informa- tion storage, including the production, recep- tion, and redistribution of elaborate graphic symbols and messages. The evidence suggests that Tlapacoya and Tlatilco, as well as Las Bocas in the highlands, manipulated one of the most complex sets of iconographie symbols of ancient Mesoamerica (see Lesure, this volume). Geologic and pedological studies of the com- position of Tlapacoya clays and deposits from surrounding zones (Reyes Cortés 1986; Lim- brey 1986), together with pétrographie and mineralogical analyses of randomly selected pan-Mesoamerican, Olmec-style sherds in Tlapacoya (see analysis reported in Nieder- berger 1976: 112- 142), indicate that ceramic vessels with masterfully executed mytholog- ical hybrid creatures, diamond-shaped or star symbols, hand-paw- wing motifs, four-petaled flowers, crossed bands, cleft heads, fangs, four- dots-and-bar motifs, and X, L, or U symbols were made from local or regional clays and manufactured by local craftspersons, experts not only in the ceramic arts but also in a com- plex, hermeneutic knowledge (fig. 8a). On the other hand, clear evidence of imported clays or vessels from extraregional or distant sources, such as Oaxaca, the Panuco region, and per- haps Morelos, come from recent analyses of Tlapacoya's Atoyac Fine Grey, Xochilepec White, and Tlapizahua White ceramic groups. Atoyac Fine Grey (Niederberger 1976: 129-130) is characterized by the presence of metamorphic elements absent in the Basin of Mexico geology. Comparative pétrographie and mineralogical analysis, carried out by Wayne Lambert (see appendix A in Niederberger 1976), of Atoyac Fine Grey sherds from Tlapacoya and sherds of Delfina Fine Grey from the San José phase of Oaxaca, kindly provided by Kent Flannery, have brought out the ample simi- larities betwéen the two groups and permitted the verification of the Oaxacan origin of Tlapa- coya's Atoyac Fine Grey vessels or compo- nents, already suspected by Muriel Porter (1967: 29) (see also Flannery and Marcus 1994: 259- 268). As to Xochiltepec White (Niederberger 1976: 128-129), made of a white amorphous fine paste with dominant kaolinite, the raw clay of these vessels could have been acquired NIEDERBERGER l8l</page><page sequence="15">8.

Finally, Tlapizahua White (Niederberger 1976: 141-142), with fine rosy paste and very fine (0.1 to 0.3 millimeter) inclusions of a metamorphic rock derived from gneiss, represents a small Tlapacoya sample (225 sherds) identical to the important Aguilar Red ceramic group of the Panuco region (Mac- Neish 1954) that I had the opportunity to study at the New York Museum of Natural History, thanks to the graciousness of Gordon Ekholm. To the same group pertains Golfo Grey (18 sherds in the Tlapacoya-Zohapilco collection) but, in this case, Golfo Grey vessels were fired in a reducing atmosphere, thereby causing the gray color of the paste and vessel surface. In short, based on analyses of ceramic pastes, it is difficult to detect any direct or indirect influence from San Lorenzo within the Tlapa- coya assemblage, as a long-lasting tradition postulates. As to ceramic designs and iconography, I can only briefly consider a few examples of 184 NIEDERBERGER</page><page sequence="18">the complex repertory of symbols found at Tlapacoya. These symbols may have consti- tuted a sort of metalanguage related to cosmo- logical and religious beliefs and, in some cases, probably associated with political power. Tlapacoya offers an impressive number of a particular pan-Mesoamerican Olmec-horizon theme: the head seen in profile, and sometimes in frontal view, with an open mouth (a meta- phor for cave and infraworld entrance) of a hybrid being with anthropomorphic features (figs. 8b, 9a, c). Even more striking is the dif- ferent set of symbolic attributes sometimes associated with these representations. A devel- oped design of a Tlapacoya vessel (see Parsons 1980) with this cleft-headed image seems to constitute an extraordinary evocation of a sacred political force. It represents, in my view, a clear abridged statement of power and leader- ship, with the profile of this mighty hybrid creature associated with three significant sym- bols: the constantly informed ears and eyes and the commanding hand (fig. 10b). Another striking case of the permanent recording on fired clay of a hermeneutic knowl- edge possessed by specialized groups within the regional capital is the highly sophisticated codified information registered on a Tlapacoya vessel in the fluid rendering typical of Man- antial phase vessels (Joralemon 1971: 50, fig. 146; Niederberger 1987: 552). It also shows several faces, in frontal and profile positions, intricately superposed and associated with vegetation, cleft, and glyphlike five-dots motifs (fig. 10a). Men holding a torch are represented on Tortuga Polished type vessels. One of the most ancient representations of the Meso- american death symbol with a fantastic hybrid creature, a man-fish-amphibian-feline with a closed eyelid crossed with a vertical band, can be observed on the flat interior base of an Ayotla phase plate (fig. 9d) (Joralemon 1976: 34; Niederberger 1987: 513). This early theme (Nicholson 1976: 164-165) also occurs on one of the head profiles of the Las Limas statuette (Joralemon 1976: 32-33) and on a remarkable clay vessel from the Chalcatzingo area (Grove 1987; Grove, this volume), demonstrating again one of the main functions of the regional capi- tal to produce, record, and transmit complex sacred messages. At Tlatilco, glyphlike symbols, isolated in h. Tlatilco (Basin of Mexico): (a) clay stamp (Kelley 1966); (b) metallic gray-slipped bottle (ht. = 22.5 cm) with raptorial bird clawprint motif; (c) black- slipped vessel (ht. = 11. 5 cm) with crossed-band motifs in a cartouche (b) and (c) Courtesy of Museo Nacional de Antropología, Mexico City NIEDERBERGER 185</page><page sequence="19">a sort of cartouche, such as a hybrid being profile, the four-petaled flower, and a cleft head with dots, have also been observed on a clay stamp. They have been interpreted by David Kelley (1966) as ideograms and a pristine form of glyphic writing (fig. na). I have analyzed elsewhere why they could perhaps be defined as "mythograms," that is, graphic symbols hav- ing an accurate meaning deprived of a system- atic phonetic counterpart (Niederberger 1987: 715-717; 1996a: 90) but also considered as antecedents to writing systems (Leroi-Gourhan 1964). But the question remains open. It must be noted that several graphic symbols on Tlapa- coya clay vessels are associated with one, five, seven, or nine dots. A particular Pilli White- type vessel (fig. 9b), probably from early Man- antial phase archaeological deposits (Joralemon 1971: 26, fig. 46; Niederberger 1987: 551), is engraved with a "motion" symbol motif and a "number one" dot. The possibility exists that it could represent a true ideogram, with pho- netic correspondence, and have been part of a ritual calendar. Within a general perspective, one of the fundamental roles of a regional capi- tal is to organize time. This would not be an isolated case: in other archaeological sites of the early first millennium b.c., independent motifs, such as the glyphs of Oaxaca's Monu- ment 3 of the Rosario phase (700-500 b.c.), which could correspond to a calendar glyph "1 Earthquake" (Flannery and Marcus 1983: 53-54)/ or the reptilian-avian head associated with six dots of the Oxtotitlan grotto, in Guer- rero (Grove 1970: 18-20), have been interpreted as number glyphs. Finally, it is essential to observe that among the concomitant phenomena observed with the rise of cities, one of the most striking is the almost explosive development of interre- gional long-distance exchanges. I shall briefly deal with this subject in my final comments. The Basin of Mexico and Interregional Exchange Systems General data from Tlapacoya, as well as the study of Tlatilco burials, now placed within an accurate chronological framework, docu- ment the existence in the Basin of Mexico of wealthy and clearly ranked societies that manipulated a coherent and complex system of codified graphic symbols some six hundred years before the advent of Zacatenco cultures. The data also show that Tlatilco and Tlapacoya, as regional centers, held a regular and strong control over economic activities and were important, active links within complex re- gional and interregional exchange networks of goods and ideas. Although the threefold typol- ogy proposed by Karl Polanyi (1957) to classify economic exchanges (reciprocal, redistributive, or market-oriented) has been widely adopted by archaeologists, and the redistributive type of exchanges characteristic of chiefdom-level polities is also thought to have been an impor- tant component of Ayotla-Manantial exchange systems, Frederic Pry or (1977) and Kenneth Hirth (1984a: 288-290) have stressed that soci- eties can seldom be classified satisfactorily by a single form of economic transaction. Differ- ent types of exchanges can take place at the same time and side by side within local and regional exchange systems. In the Basin of Mexico, the disparity be- tween northeastern and southwestern pluvial distribution, the zonal repartition of some important stone resources, the diversity of fau- nal and plant resources between freshwater or salty lacustrine expanses, as well as the natu- ral specificity of different altitude levels, would have early fostered regional exchanges among communities, with some exchanges of goods and services probably being carried out through barter. In any case, at the Tlapacoya-Zohapilco site, artifacts made of Pinus sp. from higher altitudes, as well as Otumba obsidian, are found in cultural remains in lacustrine settings as early as Playa times. The archaeological in- ventory of nonperishable material, exchanged between 1250 and 700 b.c., also includes nodu- lar and naturally laminated basalt, volcanic tuff used in the manufacture of grinding tools, chalcedony, obsidian, clay, and chunks of tepetate or hardpan, used as building compo- nents (Niederberger 1987: 678-685). As to the interregional circulation of utili- tarian goods and high-valued luxury items dur- ing Formative times, a remarkable increase is apparent throughout Mesoamerica from the end of the second millennium onward (Pires- Ferreira 1976; Flannery et al. 1976; Lee and Na- varrete 1978; Hirth 1984b). The Basin of Mexico was significantly active within these orga- nized long-distance networks. Obsidian from the Basin of Mexico had been circulating in Middle America for millennia. Three major sources of obsidian - Pachuca (Cerro de las 186 niederberger</page><page sequence="20">Navajas), Paredón, and Otumba (Barranca de los Estetes) - are located in the northeastern zone of the basin (García Bárcena 1972; Charl- ton et al. 1978; Charlton 1984). Tlapacoya, strategically located on the obsidian route from the northeastern quarries of the basin toward Morelos and tierra caliente (warm regions) as well as Coapexco, dominating the Amecameca pass (Tolstoy and Fish 1975; Tolstoy et al. 1977), may have developed some organizational fea- tures to control part of the exchange system. Through neutron activation analysis of Formative obsidian samples, the presence of Basin of Mexico obsidian has been detected in the archaeological deposits of numerous regions (compare Pires-Ferreira 1978a), such as Puebla (Las Bocas, Acatepec, Moyotzingo), Morelos (San Pablo, Cerro Chacaltepec), Oaxaca (Tierras Largas, San José Mogote), as well as Veracruz (San Lorenzo) (Cobean et al. 1971) and Chiapas (La Libertad) (Clark and Lee 1984: 260). As far as the Basin of Mexico's obsidian is concerned, gray, dark-banded Otumba obsidian is nearly the only source rep- resented at those sites between 1200 and 700 b.c. Green obsidian from Pachuca appears in small amounts at the end of this period (Pires- Ferreira 1978a). In exchange for obsidian, centripetal move- ments of exotic goods toward the basin in- cluded a wide range of commodities from neighboring or distant regions. They included iron-ore mirrors and a type of gray pottery with metallic shine from Oaxaca; kaolin,- pottery from the Panuco region; flint and travertine onyx from Puebla or Guerrero; pigments; rock crystal; mica,- bitumen from the Gulf Coast; schist, blue-green jadeite, serpentine, and other greenstones, probably from Guerrero (see Mas- tache 1988; Niederberger n.d.); cotton (Gossyp- ium sp.) from tierra caliente , found in Formative burials during salvage operations at Coyoacan (L. González Quintero, personal communication), as well as sea turtle and numerous marine shells, such as the pearl oys- ter (Pinctada mazatlanica) from the Pacific Coast, which was probably circulating through Oaxaca or Guerrero's Teopantecuanitlan gate- way site, where a pearl oyster workshop has been excavated in the domestic residential group of Lomeríos (Niederberger 1996b: 102). The presence at Tlatilco of toucan and parrot effigy vessels may relate to a custom of import- ing exotic birds as domestic animals or to exploit their plumage. Thus Basin of Mexico data document dynamic relationships with multiple economic partners throughout ancient Mesoamerican territory. Conclusions Within Mesoamerican Formative exchange net- works, it is of interest to note that the Ayotla and Manantial phase communities did not develop privileged links with the Gulf Coast, and even less a passive linear route of recep- tion from this region, as postulated by some still vivacious unicentrist and diffusionist cur- rents of interpretation. In fact, the Basin of Mexico's early interregional exchange system included multidirectional contacts. Data show a particularly well defined and regular rela- tionship with Oaxaca and the Pacific Coast. The position I have held (Niederberger 1974b; 1976: 265-266; 1987: 678-692, 750-751) concerning ancient Formative interregional exchanges - and implying the existence of multiregional contacts and the active partici- pation of multiple partners - is no longer an isolated stand. Similar views have been formu- lated more recently. One of the most elegantly and clearly expressed analyses comes from a study by Arthur Demarest (1989: 337) that pro- poses a "lattice-like model of interregional interaction" for ancient Mesoamerica. Since the early 1970s, I have also postulated that these multiple partners, with ranked societies and efficient agrarian economies, were situated at the same level of technoeconomic and socio- political complexity, a conviction that is gain- ing ground in today's Formative research with the growing use in Mesoamerican Formative studies of the conceptual tool of "peer polities," refined by Colin Renfrew (1986), pioneer archi- tect of nondiffusionist approaches in Old World archaeology. Related to this issue, it must be noted that, since the first clearly formulated refutation (Flannery 1968) of the old belief concerning the imperialism of Gulf Coast polities and their domination of highlands and other communi- ties, whether by invasions, colonization, or proselytizing expeditions, most archaeologists have rallied to the idea that interregional inter- actions were still based on the indirect impact, through more subtle processes, of culturally complex Gulf Coast communities upon less advanced ethnic groups. This dichotomous NIEDERBERGER 187</page><page sequence="21">view between more complex/less advanced groups or, in other words, between Promethean versus culturally static, contemporaneous societies, still persists in the Formative liter- ature. But new trends are now clearly emerg- ing. In this context, Gulf Coast communities, even though their achievements are perfectly acknowledged, are no longer considered as the center and exclusive force of Formative dyna- mism and changes (Hammond 1991; Flannery and Marcus 1994). Expressed in one way or another, the "peer polities" postulate is indeed a central notion in the study of already complex agrarian soci- eties for building an alternative scheme to diffusionist models and ungrounded interpre- tations, which always tend to explain cultural changes or similarities by dominance or direct or indirect influences from a single zone (Ren- frew and Bahn 1996: 364). As to the cultural similarities observed in ancient Formative communities, I have analyzed at length in pre- vious works how, as already stressed long ago by Marcel Mauss (1924) in his "Essai sur le Don," all structured systems of trade and ex- change have a noneconomic dimension and are combined with a parallel system of regular exchange of messages and information. This parallel network explains, in my view, the simultaneous development of a common set of specific visual symbols, mythological sys- tems, and semantic fields gradually built up and shared by early Mesoamerican ranked societies. 188 NIEDERBERGER</page><page sequence="22">BIBLIOGRAPHY Alvarez, Ticul 1976 Restos óseos de las excavaciones de Tlatilco, Estado de México.
