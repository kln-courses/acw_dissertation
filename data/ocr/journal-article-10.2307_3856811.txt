<plain_text><page sequence="1">EMILY GROSHOLZ Milosz and the Moral Authority of Poetry \AW hat authority does poetry have in the present age? Czeslaw Milosz often poses this question in his essays on literature and poetics, history and philosophy. He sees hu- mankind threatened by proliferating universals, the necessi- ties of scientific and social theory which seem to negate the integrity of the individual, as they usurp the claims of poetry to truth. Thus as a theoretician he is attracted to metaphysical systems like those of the Russian philosopher Lev Shestov and the French philosopher Simone Weil, which pose the hu- man soul as a radical particular allied to a transcendent good in opposition to social and natural necessity. He can then ground his practical concerns as a poet in a kind of poetic nominalism. The authority of poetry stems from its coura- geous witness that necessity does not engulf us; poetry is the voice of the individual free to pursue the good, which in fact establishes the good by speaking. Milosz was raised in the forests of Lithuania, began his studies in the provincial capital of Wilno, and moved to War- saw, where he spent the war years as a member of the Polish Underground formed in resistance to the German occupa- tion. He survived the Warsaw Uprising (in which the Red Army waited and watched the Polish resistance destroy itself in futile combat with the Germans before entering the city), was caught up by the Russian takeover of postwar Poland and defected to the West five years later. After a decade in Paris as an itinerant man of letters, he accepted a professorship at Berkeley, where he has remained since, an emigre and exile. Some poets in the United States have regarded Milosz with a strange mixture of admiration and jealousy. They blame the peripheral status of poetry in this country on the surface calm, the decadent affluence and tolerance of a society where </page><page sequence="2">252 THE HUDSON REVIEW all values are relative. Anyone can say anything, and no one pays much attention. By contrast, Milosz was privileged to live in the midst of great events, war, the collapse of civilizations, repressive occupation, in which writing a poem could be an heroic gesture, a genuinely moral act, the expression of objec- tive value. In such situations, when poetry claims the author- ity of truth, it can become as necessary to the populace as bread, and the romantic-modernist isolation of the poet is abolished. Milosz cannot be blamed for this naive assessment of his example by people who have never suffered the disruption of the entire fabric of their society. His ironic and hopeful ac- count of the relation of poetry to our moral and political in- terests belies such naivete. Yet his animosity towards the uni- versal is so intense, and his insistence on the particular and transcendent so radical, that his advice to us is less useful than it might be. In this essay, I would like to engage Milosz's moralizing po- etics with my own alternative account, which relates poetry to the social, everyday activity of moral deliberation and makes it easier to see the possible authority of poetry in ordinary as well as cataclysmic situations. Though I will make reference to a number of his books, I will concentrate on his Charles Eliot Norton Lectures, The Witness of Poetry, a full-dress state- ment of his poetics published by Harvard University Press in 1983, and to some of his poems available in English transla- tion in his revised Selected Poems (The Ecco Press, 1980). Briefly, I agree with Milosz that "scientific" social theories which pretend to reduce particular cases to necessary univer- sal principles endanger our moral education and impugn the status of poetry. But I see our best recourse against the tyran- ny of necessity not in the radically particular and transcen- dent, but in social discourse and the spirited embodiments of everyday life. Poetry can be authoritative to the extent that it helps us discover the good. But discovery of the good is an unending social process of deliberation about values, which are always, in the phrase of W. B. Gallie, essentially contest- able. The very meaning and import of values are worked out in the offensives and defenses which modulate and regulate each other in practical deliberation. As we deliberate about</page><page sequence="3">EMILY GROSHOLZ 253 what to do, we are constructing social reality. We are also in- volved in a process which continually adjusts universal princi- ples to particular cases, without the domination or disappear- ance of either. When poetry in the United States fails, its inadequacy is then best understood as a failure of eloquence and phronesis, prudential wisdom. Nonetheless, poetry can play an important role in moral deliberation, and in what fol- lows I will examine this role more closely. I In The Captive Mind, a book written shortly after his depar- ture from Poland, Milosz discusses the effect of the Russian- controlled Marxist regime on Polish writers of his acquaint- ance. "Alpha the Moralist" was a haughty, austere personality who admired purity and wished to be recognized as a moral authority. He tended to write novels of ideas, insufficiently rooted in experience and observation of life. In underground Warsaw, his writings on the ethic of loyalty and self-sacrifice inspired many of the young people who were to be among the two hundred thousand slaughtered in the Warsaw Upris- ing. Milosz relates that Alpha's first postwar novel contained over-simplifications at odds with his richly ambiguous experi- ences in the war. The Communist regime imprisoned large numbers of resistance fighters who had been allied with the London government-in-exile; although they had been fight- ing Hitler, they were now called class enemies. (Precisely the same fate awaited Communist resistance fighters in Greece.) Yet Alpha depicted them in his novel merely as lost souls, in- capable of hearing the good news offered by the protagonist, a fearless old Communist. "Beta the disappointed lover of humanity" made his liter- ary career in postwar Poland by writing a chilling account of his experience as an "upper caste" prisoner in Auschwitz. (The Party welcomed all anti-Nazi literature at the time.) He described how the less clever and aggressive perished, while he managed to keep himself warm and well-fed. Life in the camp appears as Hobbes's state of nature, each individual pit- ted against all the others, without sympathy or conscience,</page><page sequence="4">254 THE HUDSON REVIEW stripped of the illusory habits of civilization. And yet, Milosz points out, fellow-inmates who knew Beta in Auschwitz say that he often acted with courage and compassion. The ex- treme brutality of his stories disguised his principle of selec- tion. Milosz accuses Alpha and Beta of failing both as artists and as moralists. Indeed, the two kinds of failure cannot be disen- tangled. Because they didn't capture the depth and complex- ity (the moral reality) of the characters, their work is morally unedifying and also bad art. They have reduced their charac- ters to angels, demons or animals. We have nothing to learn from such types, which are intrinsically good, incorrigible or simply amoral and so incapable of enlightenment or degener- ation. They cannot be used to think through the meaning of moral principles brought to bear on difficult situations. Nei- ther do they compel our attention or compassion; as works of art, they are inert. We are not tempted to inject ourselves imaginatively into these adventures, rounding out the story in reflective hindsight: What if she had acted otherwise? What would I have done in that situation? If only... No genuine moral tension calls us back into the story; we simply do not care enough to return to it. Our evaluation of an author's dis- play of moral imagination is at once an aesthetic and an ethi- cal judgment. The long terrible silences of the war incited a whole gener- ation of postwar Polish writers, Milosz among them, to give expression to what they and others had experienced. Dialecti- cal materialism was a theodicy which provided rationalization a priori: the enemy (the exponents of capitalism in its most virulent form, fascism) deserved to die, and the inno- cent... Well, they could die with the satisfaction of knowing this conflagration was needed to clear the way for the Com- munist millennium. Shestov, if he had lived to hear the pro- nouncements, would have repudiated Marxist necessity as he repudiated the whole philosophic tradition springing from Greek metaphysics for which, he complained, only the neces- sary and general were important. But why should we respect a necessity that has no respect for us, radical particulars, and in fact violates our intensest desires? We must not accept even one tear shed by one innocent child; reason masks the absur-</page><page sequence="5">EMILY GROSHOLZ 255 dity of existence; suffering is the key to truth. In his collec- tion of essays, Emperor of the Earth (U. of California Press, 1981), Milosz devotes a whole chapter to expounding Shes- tov's refusal. Yet even Milosz must find it difficult to make sense of Shes- tov's rebellion against not only mathematical and natural ne- cessity, but historical necessity as well. Shestov demands of God that He unmake history. We cannot accept, for example, that Socrates died at the hands of the Athenians. But with this demand, the self, the radical particular, also demands to be itself unmade. We are what we are because of our origin in a certain cultural geography, a moment in history, with all its injustice and suffering. Shestov tries to extract the self from the determinations of historical necessity, but in so do- ing he empties it of content. Is there then no middle ground between the necessity of the Marxist and Shestov's radical but empty voluntarism? Are we condemned to complacent rationalization or impotent and uncomprehending rage? A middle ground does exist; it is the place where we deliberate about the past, where poets com- pose poems about the past as part of that process. Aristotle said we only deliberate about the future, but there he was mistaken. We are continually engaged in constructing the moral truth of the past as well as of the present. The reality of the past is in part how it influences us now; as we deliber- ate about it, our characterization of it changes, and it acts on us differently. What can a poet do for the past? Engage the dead in conversation; mourn; forgive. Like all deliberation, this is a long and difficult process, with no certain outcome. How lucky Milosz is, the American poets say, to have the experience of such great suffering, which yields such depths of moral insight. What Milosz recounts, however, about the witness of poetry in reaction to war and genocide does not bear out this foolish romanticism, akin to the myth that the best poets are madmen. The human conversation itself suf- fers when society breaks down, and with it our moral dis- criminations and our poetry; often the damage can hardly be repaired. In Chapter 5 of The Witness of Poetry, Milosz makes clear that cataclysms provide neither necessary nor sufficient condi-</page><page sequence="6">256 THE HUDSON REVIEW tions for profound moralizing or great art. During the war years, poetry was the main genre of underground literature, since a poem could be contained on a single page. A recently published anthology of such work, called Poetry of Fighting Po- land, contained almost two thousand pages of poems and songs. But most of them, he concludes, do not have much aesthetic worth: only a few show much familiarity with poetic craft; most were too blatant in their calls to battle. In general, they were filled with moral and aesthetic commonplaces. And this is not surprising, since "people thrown into the middle of events that tear cries of pain from their mouths have difficul- ty in finding the distance necessary to transform this material artistically." War presents the least favorable conditions for prudence, the ability to see an issue from all angles, in all its ambiguity. It is unlikely that a soldier or prisoner will consid- er the lofty ideals, the stupidity, pain and grief of the enemy firing at him. If the trauma to social life has been thorough enough, even the cessation of hostilities will not restore the conversation. Milosz reviews the work of a half-dozen postwar Polish poets and finds them all to one degree or another misologic, hostile to and distrustful of the word. They reproached culture with being a tissue of illusion, "a network of meanings and sym- bols as a facade to hide the genocide underway," and were therefore attracted to various forms of reductionism. Their imagery tends to assimilate people to animals and physical ob- jects, action to motion, human relations to the push-pull of forces. Their diction and vocabulary is simple and even slightly decomposed; they eschew obvious figures, stripping their poems of "eloquence." I find such poetry both crippled and moving, half in re- treat from discourse and half engaged; its expressiveness be- lies its distrust of expression. True despair is silent; these ut- terances of despair are hopeful insofar as they are uttered. Yet their moral usefulness is impaired, for the retreat from discourse which they represent is the source of the suffering they protest, not its solution. Eloquence can certainly be abused. But moral wisdom must be eloquent, for it must be effective, and virtue is worked out in social discourse. We must be able to persuade others about their own interests in</page><page sequence="7">EMILY GROSHOLZ 257 order to get anything done. The cure for the abuse of elo- quence is more eloquence, more efficacious wisdom. Milosz quotes two poems, the first by Zbigniew Herbert, the second by Aleksandor Wat, in which the writers take stones as being worthy of emulation. The duplicity of the message is revealed by the fact that both poets provide their stones with eyes: Pebbles cannot be tamed to the end they will look at us with a calm and very clear eye. *** ... With the eyes of a stone, myself a stone among stones, and like them sensitive, pulsating to the turning of the sun. On the one hand, this conceit is morally unhelpful; the fixity and silence of stones is simply unattainable for human beings (though not for corpses). On the other hand, neither poet can resist anthropomorphizing the stones, investing them with the virtues of self-possession, nobility, honesty and sensi- tivity. But virtue is social, and is created by people who talk about themselves and each other. Even Milosz sometimes seems infected by such misology, when, for example, he wishes for fixed and 'objective' values, like those removed, disembodied monoliths, the forms of Pla- to; or when he excuses the reductions of the foregoing poets as a kind of realism. Yet Milosz himself managed to write po- ems about his ruined country which are eloquent and mourn- ful, and which address both the dead and the living. Those silenced by catastrophe really do need us to speak for them, to forgive them; sometimes poetry is equal to the demand. "Dedication" was written in Warsaw in 1945. You whom I could not save Listen to me. Try to understand this simple speech as I would be ashamed of another. I swear, there is in me no wizardry of word. I speak to you with silence like a cloud or a tree.</page><page sequence="8">258 THE HUDSON REVIEW What strengthened me, for you was lethal. You mixed up farewell to an epoch with the beginning of a new one, Inspiration of hatred with lyrical beauty, Blind force into accomplished shape. Here is the valley of shallow Polish rivers. And an immense bridge Going into white fog. Here is a broken city, And the mind throws the screams of gulls on your grave When I am talking with you.

That I wanted good poetry without knowing it, That I discovered, late, its salutary aim, In this and only this I find salvation. They used to pour millet on graves or poppy seeds To feed the dead who would come disguised as birds. I put this book here for you, who once lived So that you should visit us no more. Only in the first stanza does Milosz resort to the reductive commonplaces of his generation, and its curious inversion of the pathetic fallacy. "I speak to you with silence like a cloud or a tree." Admittedly, there is something paradoxical about the way in which elegiac poems address the dead person di- rectly. Yet we often have unfinished business with the dead, and thus they enter into our deliberations; we talk to them so they will not haunt us into repetitions of revenge or grief. For they both are and are not beyond salvation. "Dedication," like all successful deliberating, exhibits a deli- cate enmeshment of universal and particular. It begins with a situation which is both concrete (the shallow rivers, the bridge, the broken city involve "Warsaw, 1945") and general (everyone at one time or another must turn to their dead,</page><page sequence="9">EMILY GROSHOLZ 259 and their defeats). This context has brought Milosz to certain realizations about poetry, and himself as a poet and moral agent. Poetry cannot serve univocal theory, which becomes the official lie; it cannot be the instrument of mere passion; it must go beyond the naivete of inexperience. Milosz gives himself, and any poet, this admonition, and concludes the poem with a resolve to do a particular act in fulfillment of universal principles. The act is writing the poem, settling with his dead; and it fulfills the injunction that poetry must save nations and people. For maintaining our conversation with the past, with each other, is our best hope; and forty years later, in another country, even in translation, this poem still questions us. II Milosz often complains about nature and the necessities with which it threatens us. His extended, sympathetic discus- sion of Blake's opposition to the strictness of Newtonian phys- ics in The Land of Ulro (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1984) can be summarized thus: "The problem that engaged Blake would loom increasingly larger, in both range and magnitude, up to the present: The fact that the Particular has been consumed by the Universal." In Visions from San Francisco Bay (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1982) he announces, "[I do not like] the natural order, which means submission to blind necessity, to the force of gravity, all that which is opposed to meaning and thus offends my mind. As a creature of flesh, I am part of that order, but it is without my consent." And in Chapter 3 of The Witness of Poetry, called "The Lesson of Biology," he writes: "Nature in its incredible prodigality, producing the billions of creatures necessary to maintain the species, is abso- lutely indifferent to the fate of the individual. Once integrat- ed into nature, man also changes into a statistical cipher and becomes expendable." I think there are really two issues here, which Milosz doesn't always distinguish in his arguments. As a poet and a moralist, Milosz is worried about the hegemony of scientific theory. As a mortal creature with a Catholic up- bringing, he is also worried about embodiment.</page><page sequence="10">260 THE HUDSON REVIEW The hegemony of scientific theory intrudes on our lives in more than one way. Reductionist theories of human nature pretend that people are like blocks and pulleys, that their ac- tions are motions subject to physical laws and thus deter- mined, inevitable, amoral. Moral responsibility as a category drops out of the description of human affairs. Thus, moral disputation (and poetry) are simply by-products of our confu- sion about ourselves, which we can ultimately do without. Theories about human nature cannot dispense with values, however, and in fact such theories bring values in again by the back door. But then their practical effect is pernicious: for their authority as 'theories' discourages practical delibera- tion, and their pretense of being value-free theories masks the way they impose values in rigid and often inappropriate ways. Here we recall Milosz's complaint about the deployment of Marxist theory. Even if one grants, however, that the application of scien- tific theory to people is inappropriate (as Milosz surely does), one might wonder what to make of its application to other creatures and entities. If the "rest" of nature is accurately de- scribed by science, then it is merely a realm of necessity, where things cannot be otherwise, and therefore is not sub- ject to deliberation. If it has no moral dimension, then we have no responsibility towards it. The hegemony of scientific theory then dictates that we take only a theoretical, not any moral, interest in the rest of nature. And this also disturbs Milosz. But Milosz tends to deal with this disturbing issue in too simple and dichotomous a fashion. He often argues as if our only choices are to construe nature as a machine with the sci- entists, or to construe it in magical, anthropomorphic fashion as did the peasants of his native Lithuania. In a poem "To Robinson Jeffers," protesting Jeffers' portrayal of nature as "an inhuman thing," he concludes: "Better to carve suns and moons on the joints of crosses / as was done in my district. To birches and firs / give feminine names." Neither alternative satisfies him. Milosz (and all lovers of poetry and nature) would do well to recall that nature, science, mechanism and even necessity are themselves essentially contested concepts. The testimony</page><page sequence="11">EMILY GROSHOLZ 261 of science is more complex than he allows, and besides, it is not the only source of reliable testimony. First of all, science is not a single theory, but a patchwork of heterogeneous do- mains, each with its own characteristic items, problems, meth- ods and theoretical components. The objects of some parts of science (say, physics and mathematics) indeed behave predict- ably, as if they could not be otherwise, and an important part of our cultural coming of age was to recognize clearly how these levels of existence do not act like people. But all the objects of biology (and biology itself is an internally heteroge- neous collection of domains) have a cognitive as well as a causal dimension. Sentient, self-reproducing organisms are al- ready, in a rudimentary way, expressive and social. Words like information, communication, error and correction are as central to the vocabulary of biology as are molecule and cell. Piffle, scoffs the reductionist; these structures are all "real- ly" described by chemistry. The reductionist, however, has failed to deliberate properly, by not meshing global pro- nouncements with attention to cases. Those who study the history of science, the actual practice of scientists, came to re- gard 'reduction' as a plurality of special strategies for relating the results and methods of various sciences. The description of, for example, genetic phenotypes in terms of biochemical processes is one such (highly successful) strategy. But in fact and in principle no one-to-one correspondence exists between the descriptive terms of macroscopic genetics, and the chem- istry of DNA and RNA; the items and problems of the more highly organized domain do not collapse into that of the sim- pler one. Two distinct sciences remain, with a new pathway between them. Science enters into moral deliberation on two levels. (So there is no good reason why we do not write more poems about science.) First, even if the objects of scientific study are plausibly described as subject to necessary laws, the practice of science is a human activity which always requires delibera- tion (by both scientists and laity). The debate about the mean- ing of 'reduction' is a good example of this. Second, the het- erogenous plurality of the sciences testifies to the variety of natural kinds; the more highly organized of these exhibit genuine intentionality, which already springs the trap of the</page><page sequence="12">262 THE HUDSON REVIEW classical conception of cause and effect. Thus at least part of non-human nature shares with us sentience, choice, expres- siveness. We may debate about how extensive this part is, and how morally compelling we find this mutuality, but even sci- ence does not preclude some fellow-feeling with the rest of nature. Finally, science is not the only source of evidence relevant to the latter debate. Scientific knowledge does not exhaust our experience of nature, even if we want to disallow some aspects of the peasant or tribal worldview. The subordination of the theoretical interests of the sciences to the practical in- terest of deliberation gives priority to our ethical and aesthet- ic understanding of the world. A great deal of social reality escapes the nets of science; and we have no reason (either moral or scientific) to deny the sociability of other creatures. The sad irony of the second part of Milosz's "Three Talks on Civilization" admits as much: Yes, it is true that the landscape changed a little. Where there were forests, now there are pears of factories, gas tanks. Approaching the mouth of the river we hold our noses. Its current carries oil and chlorine and methyl compounds, Not to mention the by-products of the Books of Abstraction: Excrement, urine, and dead sperm. A huge stain of artificial color poisons fish in the sea. Where the shore of the bay was overgrown with rushes Now it is rusted with smashed machines, ashes and bricks. We used to read in old poems about the scent of earth And grasshoppers. Now we bypass the fields. Ride as fast as you can through the chemical zone of the farmers. The insect and the bird are extinguished. Far away a bored man Drags the dust with his tractor, an umbrella against the sun. What do we regret?-I ask. A tiger? A shark? We created a second nature in the image of the first So as not to believe we live in Paradise.</page><page sequence="13">EMILY GROSHOLZ 263 It is possible that when Adam woke in the garden The beasts licked the air and yawned, friendly. While their fangs and their tails, lashing their backs, Were figurative and the red-backed shrike, Later, much later, named Lanius collurio, Did not impale caterpillars on spikes of the black thorn. However, other than that moment, what we know of nature Does not speak in its favor. Ours is no worse. So I beg you, no more of these lamentations. The only real way to reduce (in the Comtean sense) a biologi- cal entity to chemistry is to kill it. If we do this enough, we will kill all our delights and then ourselves. Yet Milosz is not simply making a point here about the environment; he also reminds us, in the last six lines, of the amorality and inhu- manity of nature. The shrike impaling its living food on a thorn recalls another strain in the conversation: our member- ship in nature brings with it not only gratification, but also pain and death. The topic of science frequently prompts Milosz to discuss the metaphysics of Simone Weil, as it does at the end of "The Lesson of Biology." He regards her as a thinker who "could cope with great reduction, but who at the same time would offer a new opening and a new hope." Weil extended deter- minism to all the phenomena of this world, including the psy- chological. This world was then the domain of the Prince of Darkness, evil when it diverts us from the good, evil because the good is wholly absent from it. Our plight does not howev- er impugn the goodness of God, but rather proves it: He withdrew from his creation out of love for his creatures, to make way for them. Weil called reality the veil of God. Weil's ethic is wholly colored by her repugnance to corpo- real existence; our only hope of salvation is renunciation. All gratification is destruction; we must refuse to eat the objects of our desire, loving not them, but our hunger. If we can keep ourselves empty, grace may enter, but that is God's free gift and has nothing to do with us. Indeed our only hope is to disappear into him, paradoxically to be eaten by God. Thus Weil, like that other paradoxicalist, Shestov, so admired by Milosz, ultimately fails to preserve the integrity of the self.</page><page sequence="14">264 THE HUDSON REVIEW My objection to Weil, which could be lodged against her mas- ter Plato (or at least a certain brand of Platonism), is that she wholly subordinates gratification, gratification relevant to par- ticular embodied human beings, to renunciation, and fails to connect the good with the everyday. Specifically, she grants no positive role to the messy, pedestrian business of moral deliberation, which gets us from one day, one task to another, and which, not inessentially, requires that we delay some grat- ifications in the interest of identifying and enacting others. Though his interest in Weil is so strong that he translated her Selected Works into Polish, Milosz does admit that her neo- platonic intellectuality was too much for "a romantic nature lover who in the Ponary Mountains collected specimens for a herbarium and who hunted with Jozef Maruszenski on the outskirts of the Rudnicki Wilderness," who could not, in short, renounce the pleasures of hunting, eating, descriptive science, friendship or the peculiar claims of a locale. Yet on some level he retains, like Weil, a mistrust of the body and of discourse; and so he often fails to oppose her more extreme opinions, without quite going to extremes himself. At the end of "The Lesson of Biology," he quotes uncritically her castiga- tion of the surrealists, who, she felt, "expressed the frenzy of total license, the frenzy which takes hold of the mind when, rejecting all considerations of value, it plunges into the imme- diate." Weil is of course blind to the virtue of the surrealists, which was their appreciation of the sensual imperfect abun- dance of experience. And she reproaches them for not hav- ing values; on her terms, they could not have values, for they were searching for them in the wrong place (this world). On the contrary, their failure was a lack of eloquence. The myth of automatic writing left their work gnomic, private, and opaque; they failed to clarify and thus make effective their values for themselves or anyone else. Neither science nor religion can furnish values a priori, which can then be applied automatically and without ambigu- ity to all cases. The pretense that such values exist leads to a dangerous silencing of deliberation. Values are essentially contestable. But we need not therefore despair that "the fren- zy of total license" will ensue. For we always deliberate, and write poems under severe constraints. We begin with a situa- tion which is both universal and concrete, both local and typi-</page><page sequence="15">EMILY GROSHOLZ 265 cal, and resolve to take some action in fulfillment of certain principles. Our locality presents us with specific problems and gratifications, and limits our perspective, beliefs, tastes, means and sphere of action. Universal principles are limited by the requirements of deliberation itself; we cannot choose princi- ples which entail silence. (This meta-principle is itself subject to deliberation; yet however it is locally determined, it con- strains.) The process of deliberation is the construction of an imperfect, orderly social reality, governed by a flexible but still determinate system of rules. Deliberation is constrained because we must come to conclusions and act; poetry is con- strained because it must be relevant to moral deliberation. In- deed, the worst kind of chaos (like that which Milosz suffered and exorcised) results in the wake of attempts to impose one rigid construal of values, allowing one voice in the conversa- tion to drown out all the rest. III Obviously, writing a poem is not the same kind of contribu- tion to the human conversation as taking part in a school board meeting, a strategy session of the Opposition, a judicial process. Like Milosz, I want to say that poetry has a role to play in our moral improvement and I share his hope that such improvement is possible. But in my concern to exhibit the moral function of poetry, and to segregate and chasten theoria, I have risked assimilating poesis too strongly to praxis. Poems, as art, are distinguished from practical deliberation by their freedom and form. A poem need not refer to an actual situation or propose a specific course of action. It may contain such reference, and it will always be grounded in the poet's locale and the con- cerns which arise there, but a poet is free to construct exotic and historical situations, utopias and antiworlds. Part of mor- al education is the cultivating of moral imagination, learning to think through how principles might bear on lives and di- lemmas different from our own. Fictional cases enrich and round out our fund of experience, rendering it more system- atic and cosmopolitan. Of course, it is also in part the poet's responsibility to make these exotic constructions accessible, to</page><page sequence="16">266 THE HUDSON REVIEW exhibit their analogy with the experience of a possible audi- ence. To this end he may use specific strategies, like Homer's use of the simile to relate the heroic world to the domestic, agrarian world of his audience, or rely on the universality of the principles embodied in the story. The reader too is re- sponsible for applying his cosmopolitan, historical and sys- tematic critical abilities to the poem, in order to bring it close to the sphere of his own experience. The freedom of poetry is thus always useful, but its useful- ness takes on a special poignancy in times of trouble, when silence rules. People caught up in social catastrophe (anarchy or a too-rigid order) have reason to recoil from their circum- stances; a good poem offers an alternative reality, critical in- sofar as its analogies and disanalogies with the present are clear, hopeful insofar as it presents a reality which is plausibly human. When circumstances are so cruel that one hardly knows how to begin to deliberate about them, poetry may of- fer an interim means of expression. Poems are repeated by the solitary prisoner to affirm the conversation now lapsed, the gratifying world now in abeyance. Poems are often told about the silenced, so that they won't be forgotten, nor the moral significance of their lives left out of the conversation. And the defensively self-righteous, shamed and frightened aggressor may also sometimes be haunted by poems persuad- ing him to listen. Poetry does not replace practical delibera- tion, but may instigate, deepen and protect it. A good poem must also have enough formal integrity to make it worthy of being repeated and memorized. Part of a poet's education is technical; he or she must listen to the clas- sics and do enough five-finger exercises to master the rhyth- mic and phonic resources of the language and tradition. In this respect, poetry, like music and painting, does have its ex- perts. And such expertise is somewhat independent of moral sense. But even this area of mastery shades imperceptibly into moral terrain. What counts as euphony cannot be disentan- gled from clarity. For example, Strunk and White teach that passive constructions most often constitute bad style in En- glish; they "sound" awkward. At the same time they obfuscate by masking attributions of agency, an unclarity with direct moral bearing. Moreover, prudential wisdom must be elo- quent to be effective; eloquence is persuasive. And part (but</page><page sequence="17">EMILY GROSHOLZ 267 not all) of eloquence is an attention to form: balanced peri- ods, colorful figures, symmetry of argument and counter-ar- gument. A poem is compelling, and is preserved, because it is beau- tiful. The aesthetic appeal of a poem itself has a moral di- mension, allying it to an ethic of gratification. Reading a poem should provide the joys of aesthetic satisfaction. It should refine our ability to hear and see, our delight in a par- ticular language, in the sensual presence of life in a particular locale. And thus it persuades us of the pleasures and intrinsic value of this world. This point is worth emphasizing, since I have been focussing so much on the critical, mourning and forgiving functions of poetry. But a poetics in which they are foremost would be morbid; rather, these functions are justi- fied and motivated by our sense of the goodness of existence. If we are not persuaded of the goodness of existence, there is no hope in whose service we can responsibly act; there is no point in living, or talking, or writing poems. Eloquence can be abused, but the cure for that abuse is not silence and de- formity, but more eloquence and more beauty. In Chapter 4 ("A Quarrel With Classicism") of The Witness of Poetry, Milosz worries that the freedom and formality of poetry impede its ability to testify to the real. He cites Erich Auerbach as pointing to a certain lack of reality wherever a convention is used: "where the poet creates as beautiful a structure as possible out of topoi universally known and fixed, instead of trying to name what is real and yet un- named." And he further remarks: "The world exists objec- tively, despite the shapes in which it appears in the mind ... That objective world can be seen as it is; yet we may surmise that it can be seen with perfect impartiality only by God. In- tent on representing it, the poet is left with the bitter realiza- tion of the inadequacy of language." On the contrary, language, concepts, conventions, topoi, et cetera, reveal reality. They describe the parts of reality "which could not be otherwise" (though they reduce its com- plexity) and they construct social reality, the issues we deliber- ate about (though they can be criticized and revised). Milosz's "bitter realization" is due in part to his misology and in part to his detour into an epistemological blind alley. This blind alley, which has trapped some but been avoided by most</page><page sequence="18">268 THE HUDSON REVIEW Western philosophers, is the supposition that ideas are the immediate objects of experience, proxy-objects which stand between us and things. The best way to avoid this error is to recall that all our interaction with the world is cognitive; to have an idea about something is to understand it. We do en- counter the world directly, and our access to it is by means of ideation. Where else could we live but in the world, and how else could we experience it except through consciousness? This epistemological stance excludes divine intuition and causal interaction as models for the way we know. For most utilitarian purposes, we can describe medium- sized dry goods, rocks and top hats, in fairly exact and unam- biguous terms; other people understand the descriptions right away and we don't need to deliberate about them. (I am here bracketing certain difficult issues raised by scientific de- scription of physical phenomena not directly accessible to the senses.) In such cases, the naive notion of mimesis seems plausible; language accurately represents reality. Milosz some- times argues as if all a poet need do in pursuit of the real is to describe more medium-sized dry goods, in more detail; this picture accords with his nominalism in an odd way. Thus he characterizes the poet's confrontation with the real as "that elementary contact, verifiable by the five senses, [which] is more important than any mental construction. The never-ful- filled desire to achieve a mimesis, to be faithful to a detail, makes for the health of poetry." But then why should we complain about the inadequacies of mimesis? Milosz's com- plaint arises when he shifts examples in mid-stream without admitting what he is doing. He shifts from things to events of great moral complexity, and then rightly observes that mime- sis, simple and complete description, cannot capture the am- biguous reality. Instead of blaming the intervention of the 'veil of ideas', he should see that deliberation, the construc- tion of social reality, and not mimesis is the relevant poetic activity. The demands of realism and the employment of con- ventions, ordered forms, are not incompatible. Consider the poem "No More" which he quotes in the course of this chapter: I should relate sometime how I changed My views on poetry, and how it came to be</page><page sequence="19">EMILY GROSHOLZ 269 That I consider myself today one of the many Merchants and artisans of old Japan, Who arranged verses about cherry blossoms, Chrysanthemums and the full moon. If only I could describe the courtesans of Venice As in a loggia they teased a peacock with a twig, And out of brocade, the pearls of their belt, Set free heavy breast and the reddish weal Where the buttoned dress marked the belly, As vividly as seen by the skipper of galleons Who landed that morning with a cargo of gold; And if I could find for their miserable bones In a graveyard whose gates are locked by greasy water A word more enduring than their last-used comb That in the rot under tombstones, alone, awaits the light, Then I wouldn't doubt. Out of reluctant matter What can be gathered? Nothing, beauty at best. And so, cherry blossoms must suffice for us And chrysanthemums and the full moon. The erotic metaphor is centrally important here. It de- pends on the old convention that women and matter form a metaphoric unity and stand in opposition to man-spirit. Mi- losz has chosen not only women but prostitutes, especially prone to reduction to the flesh. This convention allows him to employ the sleight-of-hand which I have just noted in an especially elegant way. He suggests that the woman-thing can be plausibly mimed and then, recalling that she is a person in a moral context of great complexity, announces that mimesis must fail to capture her reality. Thus the poet must rest con- tent with mere convention. If this poem were only an epistemological mistake, it would not compel our attention as it does. For we can see that the poem engages reality despite the disclaimer, and its success is not merely the accurate recording of detail. What I find so attractive about the poem is the richness of nuance in the po- et's depiction of the courtesans and of his relation to them. Milosz initially presents them as languid beauties, trafficking in pleasure. The entrance of the skipper of galleons reveals</page><page sequence="20">270 THE HUDSON REVIEW them as both agents and commodities in an economic transac- tion and also, where the red weal marks a belly like a little wound, women who must make their privacies public. Their vulnerability results from the special risks of their trade (dis- ease, sterility, death; the stigma of sin) and the general bur- den of mortality. In their final appearance, they are literally reduced to a collection of bones, mixed up with a comb that alone commemorates vanished beauty. Like Carpaccio, to whose painting the poem makes reference, Milosz balances the demands of aesthetic paganism and Catholic asceticism; he mourns and celebrates these women who, like him, endure their mortality even as they (paradoxically) await the light. The tense, erotic sympathy which exists between artist and human subject applies as well to Carpaccio and his original models and, no doubt, to the artisans of Old Japan who com- mented on human affairs when they used the convention of flower and moon. Evidently, I resist the convention which structures this poem and for so long has consigned women to passivity, im- purity and self-enclosure. I am disturbed by the unconscious ease with which Milosz deploys the convention, even though in the end he manages to undermine and complicate its usual import. Having once reduced the courtesans to matter, he then reanimates matter, making it reluctant, resistant to amo- rous possession by the word. I might conclude that a better way to think about the relation between enspirited matter and the word is not rape but marriage. In this summary comment, I have tried to show how the conventions in Milosz's poem contribute to the conversation in which we are all engaged. Speaking out of his local con- cerns as a poet and his cosmopolitan acquaintance with his- tory, painting and religion, he uses conventions authoritative- ly to construct and reveal moral realities. These conventions are always subject to further evaluation and revision. His poem constrains and illuminates, but does not dictate, the reader's appropriation of it as part of a moral education. En- tering into a painting by Carpaccio, or a poem by Milosz, re- veals that moral education is not just an undertaking of great seriousness; it is also an opportunity for affirmation and de- light.'
