<plain_text><page sequence="1">GODLINESS WRIT LARGE IN JOHN MUIR'S SIERRA John Gatta The Cultural Context of Muir's Great Walk In 1867, at the age of twenty-nine, John Muir began walking south from Indianapolis without knowing quite where he meant to end his journey. Having contracted malaria by the time he reached the Gulf coast of Florida, he eventually found his way to San Francisco and from there to the rugged terrain of California that would thereafter possess his soul. Many other expeditions preceded and followed his "thousand-mile walk to the gulf" (O'Grady 48). But Muir's marriage to Louie Strentzel in 1880 concluded an unusually restless period of wandering that has been called his "ten-year pilgrimage to the wild" (O'Grady 48). In the course of this grand passage, Muir walked away from the God of his cultural inheritance. Feeling "joyful and free" as he began his unen- cumbered sojourn, he also wanted to shed the burdensome piety of bourgeois Christianity. By the time he reached Cedar Keys, Florida, his journal entries betray total disillusionment with the presumption that a "civilized, law-abiding gentleman" could be worshipped as Creator of the vast cosmos. Such a deity, narrowly fixated on the welfare of human beings, was "purely a manufactured article" no better than an idol (TM 1, 77). Nonetheless, he felt powerfully drawn to pursue a godliness beyond his own ken. Though he confessed, before embarking on his great walk, that "I wish I knew where I was going," he found himself gripped by a sense that he was "Doomed to be 'carried of the spirit into the wilderness'" (LF R&amp;L 35.2-3 (Summer-Autumn 2003) 11</page><page sequence="2">1 2 Religion &amp; Literature 32). The religious disposition evident in Muir's adult response to the nonhuman world derived largely from his family history and tempera- ment. To begin with, though, it is worth considering how the spiritual crisis of the age helped to condition this response - and to shape Muir's voca- tion as perpetual sojourner. After 1855, belief in a sacral world was shaken by several developments impinging on citizens of the Republic. To be sure, the publication of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species in 1859 did not immediately destroy either the religious faith or the nature romanticism cherished by large numbers of Americans. For a time, many considered it possible to assimi- late Darwinism into preexisting conceptions of natural history, natural theology, and providential design. After all, theories about the mutation or "development" of biological species had been entertained for at least half a century before the Origin, most conspicuously in Robert Chambers's Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844). The full import of evolution- ary thought, as initially mediated through Herbert Spencer and often implicated with Social Darwinism, took decades to permeate American culture.1 Even among naturalists in the National Academy of Sciences, nine- teenth-century views about the extent of divine intervention in the modifi- cation of species differed considerably. America's intellectual leaders in other spheres, too, included not only atheistic materialists but also Idealists and theistic evolutionists of many stripes. Despite Darwin, they held a wide spectrum of views about the extent to which God might occasionally work miracles of "special creation." Thus, particularly after 1875, main- stream Protestant church leaders largely abandoned previous efforts to deny that organic evolution could be accommodated to truths preserved in biblical revelation. Committed theists became more and more inclined to argue that evolution was simply God's preferred method of creation.2 Eventually, though, the era's fascination with several forms of scientific materialism gave yet freer rein to the skepticism previously unleashed by "higher criticism" of the Bible and other challenges to historically revealed Christianity. Moreover, the colossal carnage of the Civil War called into question nearly every antebellum version of civic, natural, and revealed religion. Horrid battles were fought amid scenes of surpassing natural beauty, such as Virginia's Shenandoah Valley and Tennessee's Lookout Mountain. Although Muir managed to escape military service, he was impressed by the signs of devastation he witnessed during his long walk through the South in 1867. Emily Dickinson, later in the century, repre- sented the era's crisis of faith by lamenting in verse that God's right "Hand</page><page sequence="3">JOHNGATTA 13 is amputated now / And God cannot be found" (3.1386). She must have known then that amputation of limbs had been the treatment of choice for countless blue and gray soldiers maimed in the conflict that had raged some twenty years earlier. Surely this hateful bloodletting, inflicted by Americans upon their fellows on an unprecedented scale, contributed to what Dickinson called "the abdication of Belief" (3.1386). Nor did the nation's postwar atmosphere - with its worship of entrepreneurial greed, its corporate and civic corruption, its expansionist pride, its vulgar materi- alism as sanctioned by "the Gilded Age" - offer much to renew belief in things of the spirit. The triumph of large-scale industrial capitalism, together with the official closing of the frontier around 1890, further assured America's fall from the Jeffersonian ideal of free-spirited individu- als planted in free soil. Much of the literature produced between the Civil War and World War I reflects a markedly pessimistic reading of the Darwinian fable of survival through fierce competition.3 Authors identified with literary "naturalism" accented the grimly impersonal, morally indifferent identity of nature in a godless world. Other readings were possible. Philosopher Herbert Spencer's optimistic reconstruction of Darwinism defended not only laissez-faire economic policies, but also expectations of evolutionary progress vaguely allied to an apotheosis of force he termed "the Unknowable." But in any case, the scope of personal freedom seemed to have contracted. The ethical pressure that once drove antebellum social reforms had dimin- ished. What spirits might be left to inhabit nature after evolutionary materialism seemed to have replaced "creationism" with hard science? Despite literary naturalism's denial of God's real presence in the mate- rial world, romantic naturalism did survive in some quarters. Traces of romantic religion survive, for instance, in Mark Twain's hauntingly lyrical evocations of the Mississippi River, a current saturated with the primal spirits of American nature as venerated and recollected from the author's boyhood. America's ineluctable optimism simply could not allow total or permanent acceptance of pessimistic materialism. Where postwar expres- sions of spiritual naturalism emerge, however, they typically differ from their antebellum counterparts. The most obvious change in focus presented by this later, neo-romantic writing is its geographic shift from east- to west-coast sites of numinous encounter. If the gods once so accessible to imagination in the forests of Massachusetts and New York State had died or retreated, other spirits arose to access the numinous for John Muir in California's Yosemite Valley as well as for Mary Austin in the desert Southwest. Beyond the traditional</page><page sequence="4">1 4 Religion &amp; Literature nature temples planted in northeastern woodlands, other ecological sys- tems and landscapes came to be acknowledged as sacred space. Another trait of the ecospirituality voiced during this extended period is an ethical commitment disdainful of the amorality that had commonly been identified with evolutionary determinism or Social Darwinism. For John Muir, preserving the integrity of wild places and wild things became an ethical passion. Comparable forms of moral urgency inform the natu- ral history writings of later figures such as Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, and Loren Eiseley. Leaders of the nascent environmental movement agreed that instead of capitulating to doctrines of economic, historical, or physi- cal necessity, Americans must assume direct responsibility for preventing the despoliation of the earth. Insofar as the theory of organic evolution contributed positively to the reshaping of religious faith in America, its chief long-term influence was to foster what John H. Roberts has called "more immanentist conceptions of God's relationship to the world" (ix). Divine immanence, the doctrine of God's palpably incarnational involvement in creation, had always been at least theoretically part of Jewish and Christian teaching. Yet even for orthodox believers, old dividing lines now blurred more than ever - not only between Creator and creation, but also between spirit and matter, human and animal. Evolutionary science also encouraged religious think- ers, whether inspired by Judeo-Christian or Asian traditions, to reconceive the world's formation as a continuous creation rather than a one-time performance by a deity who subsequently withdrew from earth's stage into heavenly solitude. In several respects, then, Muir's neo-romantic pilgrim- age epitomizes efforts to resist the late-nineteenth-century climate of deterministic skepticism. Though empirically trained in botanical science, Muir never abandoned his lifetime pursuit of a nature philosophy steeped in religious mysticism. Dwelling in Holy Habitations At the outset of "The Story of My Boyhood and Youth," John Muir sounds the central theme of his life: he is perpetually a lover "of wild places and wild creatures." In Muir's recollection, this "natural inherited" attraction to untamed nature stands painfully at odds with the severe regimen of labor and punishment that his father first imposed in Scotland (NW 7). After the family moved to Wisconsin, John continued to chafe against the influence of Daniel Muir, an authoritarian figure who became an itinerant preacher for the evangelical Christian sect known as</page><page sequence="5">JOHNGATTA 15 Campbellism.4 Having been confined too long by his repressive father, who forced him to commit to memory most of the Bible, John Muir understandably welcomed the chance to breathe freer air - first by study- ing science at the University of Wisconsin, then by taking his long excur- sion through the South, and at last, in 1869, by entering the high temples of his heart's desire in Yosemite Valley. In Muir's mind, the path that eventually led him to become America's foremost apostle of wilderness also opened an escape route from his father's narrow brand of Christian discipleship. Nonetheless, Muir's sense of the world remained passionately religious. If anything, he became more intensely absorbed by godliness once he had moved outside the bounds of Campbellite control. His writing is every- where permeated by a conviction that humans could personally encounter transhuman spirits of the material world, that the whole of nature - not just humanity - displays a divine image, and that godliness was inscribed most clearly on faces of nature least marked by human colonization. "God's glory is over all His works, written upon every field and sky," he declared in 1870 after spending his first winter in Yosemite Valley. Yet he insisted that "here it is in larger letters - magnificent capitals" (JAf 47). Accordingly, Muir's expression abounds in references to "Godful wil- derness," or "the Godful woods." The water-ouzel's haunting song as well as "the utterances of torrents and storms" were "only varied expressions of God's eternal love." "In our best times," he insisted, "everything turns into religion, all the world seems a church and the mountains altars" (NW 295, 197, 30, 499). The interior glow of such beliefs is what fired Muir's outward activism, including his cofounding of the Sierra Club in 1892 and his political crusade to preserve inviolate large tracts of uninhabited land. Defining the theological character of Muir's adult faith more closely poses difficulties, however. When assessments of Muir take any account of his religion, they represent him variously as a pantheist, a Transcendentalist, a mystic, an ecocentric evolutionist, an idiosyncratic Protestant Christian, or a post-Christian romantic.5 Each of these labels carries some validity for a figure struggling to define his innate spirituality within the unsettled intellectual climate of post-Darwinian America. And because Muir saw himself primarily as a lover and defender of wild places, rather than as a literary artist or as any kind of systematic philosopher or theologian, one cannot expect to locate a definitive statement of his beliefs. Muir was drawn away from conventional Christianity not only by his father's whip, but also by growing discontent with what he perceived to be the human-centered and book-centered character of revealed religion.</page><page sequence="6">1 6 Religion &amp; Literature Though he was willing to advocate the preservation of roadless areas for practical reasons of human welfare, he was more committed to an ecocentric vision that affirmed the intrinsic value of all creation. This principle placed him at odds with his culture's commonly taught religious views concerning the biblically sanctioned, hegemonic right of human beings to exploit every aspect of nature. Compared with the ecstatic faith that Muir professed in Yosemite and later in Alaska, the faith of most Christian churches struck him as too narrowly anthropocentric, the God they wor- shipped too anthropomorphic, and their indoor worship too bland to rival the numinous impressions he received in Sierra's "Range of Light." Yet even these upper-case letters of glory needed interpretation to reveal their full meaning. Persistently invoking script metaphors, Muir insisted that scientific training enhanced rather than impeded one's ability to read the poetry inherent in earth shapes "whose many books and chapters form the geological Vedes of our glorious State" (LF 178). Having so thoroughly "learned the alphabet of ice and mountain structure" (LF 1 26), he believed he could appreciate all the better how "Yosemite comes to us an endless revelation" even as it remains "mysterious," in some measure "unreadable, immeasurable." Its scripted revelation must be deciphered with care because the multi-layered nature of Sierra geology involves features which, "like palimpsests," are "written line upon line and crossed again and again" (JM 58, 88). In fact, Muir confessed in an 1866 letter that he could "take more intense delight from reading the power and goodness of God from 'the things which are made' than from the Bible," though he maintained that the two sources of revelation "harmonize beautifully" (LFl). Thus, Muir never explicitly disavowed Christianity, even when he dis- tanced himself from conventional faith to embrace a more earth-centered godliness. The era's liberal forms of Christianity encouraged, after all, the kind of eclectic spirituality that Muir sought to develop.6 So Muir's faith incorporated the religiously liberalizing influences available to him through his friendship with Jeanne Carr, wife of one of his university professors, through exposure to Transcendentalism from several sources including a meeting with Emerson himself in his cabin near Yosemite Falls, and through reading figures such as geographer Alexander von Humboldt and geologist-zoologist Louis Agassiz whose works suggested to him a holistic view of the world's geophysical unity. All of these influences supported Muir's inclination to envision a more immanent, dynamic, benign deity than his childhood Christian training had allowed.</page><page sequence="7">JOHNGATTA 17 At the same time, Muir's naturalistic piety retained a greater sense of God's personal presence and care than antebellum Transcendentalists had typically acknowledged.7 Muir accepted the transmutative premise of evolutionary theory, believing that Darwinism confirmed our human kin- ship with other creatures and fostered a proper humility about our place in the cosmos (Nash 42-43). Yet he was reluctant to describe nature's primary modus operandi in terms of "Darwin's mean ungodly word 'struggle'" (LL 1.3). Moreover, he affirmed that the divinity suffusing creation was, in fact, an intelligence rather than a randomly directed or heartless force.8 With the Bible impressed on his verbal consciousness in childhood, he fastened in adulthood on theological keywords of natural piety that he had held in memory from the scriptural Word. Most plainly within the scriptural canon, Saint John's Gospel expounds on two theological motifs favored by Muir: God as Love, and God as Light. He found a God who is love - neither indifferent nor punitive - manifested in the marvel of creatures vitally connected to one another in ecological harmony. "How wholly infused with God," he once exclaimed, "is this one big word of love that we call the world!" (NIY 595). And he found sensory corroboration of the "God who is Light"9 by apprehending the splendor that irradiated the Sierran high peaks. The "divinely beautiful" luminosity of these heights (JVW315) sets the tone of his account in The Mountains of California. Pressing toward the summit of Mount Ritter, he perceived the rosy evening alpenglow to be "one of the most impressive of all the terrestrial manifestations of God." He concluded that even "the darkest scriptures of the mountains are illumined with bright passages of love that never fail to make themselves felt when one is alone" (350). After a power beyond himself carried his defeated body to "blessed light" at the pinnacle of Mount Ritter, "the sunlight in which I was laving seemed all in all" (355). 10 Muir's experience also follows the biblical precedent of Saint Paul, insofar as he underwent an illuminative conversion and change of life after he was nearly blinded by an accident suffered while working with factory machinery in 1867.11 He became all the more convinced, as he later testified in The Mountains of California, that wild places were uniquely capable of "leading one far out of himself, yet feeding and building up his individuality" (NW 350). Thus, the version of Christian spirituality most closely allied to Muir's religion was at once mystical and Protestant. The mystical strain appears in Muir's accounts of envisioning the ineffable, his testimony to experienc- ing the unseen divine unity of the cosmos. It is telling in this regard that Jeanne Carr should have compared him to Saint Francis of Assisi,</page><page sequence="8">1 8 Religion &amp; Literature Christianity's foremost example of the ecological mystic and lover of creation. Muir also reflected a zeal for righteous reform springing from his Protestant heritage.12 Accordingly, he devoted his life to saving and chang- ing the world - but in a more immediate physical sense than his forebears had presumed. Only that prophetic charism classically given to the Re- former could embolden an ordinary citizen to preach to the President of the United States, as Muir did to Theodore Roosevelt, about his moral fault in hunting wild animals for pleasure. Temperamentally, Muir was also sympathetic to the traditional Protes- tant emphasis on human depravity. All that he observed about humanity's defacing of creation, culminating in his failure to prevent the damming of Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite, confirmed his suspicion that greed and vanity were deeply rooted in human nature. Thus, although the Sierra offered a prosperous environment for the giant Sequoia, the tree's future was seriously endangered because "unfortunately, man is in the woods" so that "waste and destruction are making rapid headway" (Mountains, NW 436). Yet Muir departed from religious orthodoxy in his conviction that wild nature remained peculiarly exempt from the universal corruption linked to the Fall. He exulted in the pure divine beauty displayed by Douglas Squirrels, woodchucks, white lilies, and water-ouzels but scorned domestic sheep as "in great part misbegotten, without good right to be, semi-manufactured, made less by God than man" (Summer in NW 208). "Strange that mankind alone is dirty," (186) he observed while comment- ing on clothing customs but implying deeper skepticism about our moral condition. Whereas moles, seals, or fishes lead tidy lives, "Man seems to be the only animal whose food soils him, making necessary much washing and shield-like bibs and napkins" (198). In a fit of annoyance, he had even claimed that "more than aught else mankind requires burning" if one were to cleanse the planet of its genuinely "deplorable evils" (7M80). My First Summer in the Sierra is a logical text to examine for indications of how Muir transposed Christian and romantic paradigms into his own idiom of earth-centered spirituality. Blending traditions of travel literature and personal narrative, the book as reworked from early journals late in the author's career does not describe what Muir then perceived as humanity's menacing incursions into his favorite place. Unlike many of Muir's later writings, My First Summer includes no explicit statement of preservationist ideology or call for government action to create parks and forest reserves. Yet by recalling the experiential origins of Muir's full- blown commitment to wilderness preservation, the work as published in 1911 took readers back to what Muir regarded as the spiritual heart of the</page><page sequence="9">JOHNGATTA 19 political movement he had initiated. In offering the story of his own "conversion" in Yosemite, Muir clearly hoped to stir in others a recogni- tion that landscapes like those witnessed in the Valley display "divine hieroglyphics" (164) in grand relief. Such ground, which "seemed holy, where one might see God" (180), must therefore be saved from destructive profanation. By his thirty-first year, when he first met the exhilarating freedom of Yosemite, Muir had already been devoutly enamored with wild things. So the "conversion" in question involves no abrupt turn from previous ways but rather an elevation and consummation of his commitment: How glorious a conversion, so complete and wholesome it is, scarce memory enough of old bondage days left as a standpoint to view it from! In this newness of life we seem to have been so always. (161) To convey the spiritual impact of his encounter with the mountains, Muir often invokes the expressive idiom of biblical Christianity. Do such allusions to conversion, baptism, and pilgrimage indicate a faithful revi- sion of Christianity, or a rejection of Christian doctrine wherein the old vocabulary is reduced to analogy? The liminal quality of Muir's ecospirituality makes it hard to say for sure. Probably Muir, too, felt some uncertainty on this score. Yet his commitment to pursue incarnate godli- ness at all costs follows the spirit of Jesus' call to abandon all other attachments and possessions for the sake of the gospel. When Muir testifies, after "gazing awe-stricken" at the glory of Horseshoe Bend in Merced Valley that he "might have left everything for it" (160), and later wants to carry only scraps of bread for his sustenance, he knew that Jesus' disciples, too, had embraced the ascetic rigors of traveling light. And when, after reaching the 1 1 ,000-foot summit of Mount Hoffman he hears Nature inviting him again to "Come higher" (240), the whisper urging him toward more sublime elevations must have echoed another divine voice fixed in literary remembrance: "Friend, go up higher" (Luke 14.10). We are apt to forget that Muir situates his most celebrated ecological aphorism within a religious vision of interconnectedness shaped by God: No Sierra landscape that I have seen holds anything truly dead or dull. . . Everything is perfectly clean and pure and full of divine lessons. This quick, inevitable interest attaching to everything seems marvelous until the hand of God becomes visible; then it seems reasonable that what interests Him may well interest us. When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe. (245; emphasis supplied)</page><page sequence="10">20 Religion &amp; Literature Among the most evocative, biblically inflected images of sanctified space that Muir develops throughout My First Summer is that of the temple edifice. The trope of the forest as spiritual temple had already become something of a cliche by thejacksonian era. The title of Muir's 1876 essay, "God's First Temples: How Shall We Preserve Our Forests," scarcely sounds original to anyone acquainted with Bryant's "Forest Hymn." Nor could Muir, in his account of Yosemite, resist pursuing the imagery of church architecture when the Valley presented him with a grand structure that was actually named "Cathedral Peak." "No wonder the hills and groves were God's first temples," he wrote, "and the more they are cut down and hewn" into confined worship sites, "the farther off and dimmer seems the Lord himself." Unlike these structures, Cathedral Peak stood to the east of his camp in "living rock" as "one of Nature's cathedrals," soaring roughly "two thousand feet high" and "nobly adorned with spires and pinnacles, thrilling under floods of sunshine as if alive like a grove- temple . . ." (237-38). In My First Summer, however, Muir found novel ways of playing out the conventional temple and tabernacle imagery, thereby raising some note- worthy considerations for green theology. For one thing, he reconceived this traditionally static figure in more dynamic, expansively geophysical terms. Saint John's Gospel records Jesus' declaration that "In my father's house, there are many mansions." In Muir's vision, the many living mansions of God's dwelling extend from the human body to the entire cosmos. Just as the body's "flesh-and-bone tabernacle seems transparent as glass" to the Valley's surpassing beauty and godliness (161), so also particular sites such as Cathedral Peak reflect the larger "grandeur of the Yosemite temple" (228) as a whole. And just as some attending church worship remain indifferent to the services performed there, so also Muir lamented that some visitors to Yosemite fail to recognize the numinous even though "the sublime rocks were trembling with the tones of the mighty chanting congregation of waters gathered from all the mountains round about, making music that might draw angels out of heaven." Such souls reacted as though "their eves were bandaged and their ears stopped ,"13 while "God himself is preaching his sublimest water and stone sermons" With the benefit of his studies in geology and evolutionary biology, Muir also understood that the apparently inert, unchanging features of nature's tabernacles were in constant flux. Despite the seeming solidity of Sierra's great peaks, even they participate in that play of continuous creation affecting every particle of nature: "From form to form, beauty to</page><page sequence="11">JOHNGATTA 21 beauty, ever changing, never resting, all are speeding on with love's enthu- siasm, singing with the stars the eternal song of creation." And despite the "enormous waste" one might perceive in nature's fertility and evolution- ary processes, Muir saw instead a perfectly divine dynamism that con- firmed his faith. Nature, he believed, "is eternally flowing from use to use, beauty to yet higher beauty; and we soon cease to lament waste and death, and rather rejoice and exult in the imperishable, unspendable wealth of the universe . . ." (226, 296). In The Mountains of California and other writings, Muir also modified the impression of static invulnerability usually attached to temples-of-nature imagery. Aside from Henry Thoreau and George Perkins March, antebel- lum writers had not underscored humanity's capacity to desecrate America's sacred groves with permanent, large-scale effect. By contrast, Muir came to believe that thoughtless humans could indeed destroy or horribly deface God's finest works. He saw Yosemite's sanctuary threatened by dams, irresponsible logging, and overgrazing. He was appalled to see the shores of glacial lakes ruined by sheep, trampling across the meadows like "a horde of hoofed locusts." As he puts the case succinctly, with biblically charged indignation, in The Mountains of California, "The money-changers were in the temple" {NW 387). The evangelical passion with which Muir later campaigned to "save" redwoods and other singular American crea- tures and places is already evident, though, in My First Summer. Disturbed by the apparent deafness of his shepherd associate, Billy, to "all stone sermons," Muir admits that he "pressed Yosemite upon him like a mission- ary offering the gospel, but he would have none of it" (238). Another uncommon feature of Muir's portrayal of Yosemite as divine temple involves his imagining it to be a site not only of worship but of habitation. In literary tradition, the forest cathedral - or, for that matter, the humanly-constructed temple - had usually been portrayed as a space of occasional refreshment for the soul. By the same token, modern envi- ronmental rhetoric usually construes "wilderness" as a domain that hu- mans are permitted to visit without remaining or residing.14 Yet Muir developed such strong attachment to unsettled land that he considered it, paradoxically, his true home. Yosemite was at once God's favored temple, a domain in which "God himself seems to be always doing his best," and Muir's preferred dwelling place. "I should like to live here always," Muir confesses, because he finds the place "so calm and withdrawn while open to the universe in full communion with everything good." Devoted as he is to Sierra's forests, meadows, and streams, he solemnly declares that "I should like to dwell with them forever." With just "bread and water," he</page><page sequence="12">22 Religion &amp; Literature would be content to remain here, observing "storms and calms, - a new heaven and a new earth every day." Here he could delight in attending "an endless Godful play"; here he could know what it meant to see "Creation just beginning, the morning stars 'still singing together and all the sons of God shouting for joy5" (187, 273, 278). Muir's ecstatic expression in this passage brings together biblical phras- ing from several disparate sources - including Genesis, Job, and the Book of Revelation. From the standpoint of temple imagery, however, Muir echoes most crucially the familiar conclusion of Psalm 23: "I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." Intoning his own form of prayer, "I should like to dwell with them forever," he voices his desire to enjoy holy habita- tion in a place not customarily inhabited by humans - or not, at least, by Europeans. He wants to abide in a place he neither owns nor governs. Muir likewise draws on biblical rhetoric to drive home his conviction that final lordship of the Sierra belongs only to the divine Lord, not to any human individual or group. He apparently sensed that an older Hebraic piety, reminding us of our small physical and spiritual stature within the endless expanse of nature, held greater promise than Transcendental self- deification for restraining willful plunder of the earth. In posthumously published remarks from his journal, he refutes "erroneous views" of God and creation, including the "presumption" that the world "was made for man." "Why ought man to value himself as more than an infinitely small unit of the one great unit of creation [?]" he asks; "And what creature of all that the Lord has taken the pains to make, is not essential to the grand completeness of that unit[?]" Challenging the view that other creatures are simply our underlings, he describes them instead as "earthborn com- panions &amp; fellow mortals."15 Thus rejecting conventional beliefs in total human "dominion" over the earth as justified from Genesis 1.28, he nonetheless presents a "Godful" vision of ecological unity consistent with the biblical sentiment of Psalm 24: "The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein." Frequently, then, Muir's writing sustains credence in a transcendent, monotheistic Creator - and even in a form of providential romanticism one might have thought implausible after Darwin. Most of his nature writing shows little engagement with specifically Trinitarian Christianity, but it also shows a reluctance to embrace Thoreau's humanistic confi- dence that "He who has visited the confines of his real estate, looking out on all sides into space - will find a new inducement to be the Lord of creation" (Thoreau 1.44-45). Muir never presumed to call himself Lord of creation, or the master of all he surveyed. At several critical junctures,</page><page sequence="13">JOHN GATTA 23 Muir's pantheistic feelings give way to more outer-directed, theistic state- ments of reverence, as in the culminating words of My First Summer. Here ends my forever memorable first High Sierra excursion. I have crossed the Range of Light, surely the brightest and best of all the Lord has built; and rejoicing in its glory, I gladly, gratefully, hopefully pray I may see it again. (309) Assessing Muir's Legacy One must admit that Muir's extreme privileging of wild Nature over all forms of human Culture can be vexing to anyone interested in extending the benefit of environmental understanding to populated regions of America. If Yosemite is a holy place "where one might see God," does it follow that San Francisco is a god-forsaken place where one might see only cars and corruption? If so, should the clamor from residents of Saint Francis's city for a clean water supply be ignored? And if natural as well as anthropological science assures us that there is no such thing as a pure American nature, untainted by human contact, how can we take seriously Muir's belief that pristine places deserve special protection, if not venera- tion, as sacred ground? In confronting such concerns, I think we need first to acknowledge Muir's limitations as a figure of single-minded passion. Like other pro- phetic personalities, he felt drawn toward hyperbolic rhetoric to dramatize the case for preservationist policies that were not always popular and never profitable. The excess evident in his language and attitudes accords with the topographical extremes of his favorite landscapes. Unlike Barry Lopez in our own day and Thoreau in the earlier nineteenth century, Muir lacked a sophisticated awareness that romantic "wilderness" is constructed from the interplay between material substance and our own cultural imagina- tion. Though a brilliantly charismatic leader, he was a less subtle and original thinker than Thoreau. Nor was he fully conscious of the ways in which his own writing mythologized the western wilderness, or fully attentive to the possibilities for environmental reform in settled communi- ties. Despite his attraction to landscapes that had not been substantially reconstructed by EuroAmerican culture, Muir showed surprisingly little sympathy for Native American cultures surviving in California or else- where in the lower states.16 In pragmatic terms, however, I think Robert L. Dorman is right to defend Muir's rhetoric of numinous nature because it succeeded, against formidable opposition, in winning public acceptance of national parks</page><page sequence="14">24 Religion &amp; Literature and wilderness preservation systems that become all the more valuable as population pressures mount (220-21). Nor should Muir's sacralization of monumental scenes be dismissed as hopelessly naive. Human apprehen- sions of sacred space are, after all, always determined in some measure by cultural consensus rather than by wholly intrinsic or "natural" attributes. So far as physical science can determine, there is nothing materially unique about the Ganges River, the Black Hills, Chartres Cathedral, or any other site that has become the focal point of contemplative worship. Thus, when Muir describes "the sculpture of the landscape" (160) in My First Summer, we notice that his impressions of sacred wonder flow largely from his powerful aesthetic response to the land's shapes and light- ing. Yet it would be a mistake to regard this aesthetic dimension as unreal or wholly arbitrary. As centuries of sacred art and music confirm, religious experience is often conditioned by sensations of "the beauty of holiness." The beauty Muir perceived in Yosemite's spectacular scenery, like that discernible in a Rembrandt canvas or at Chartres, amounts to more than a projective fantasy. Many others have shared his admiration. Granted, we "half create" from our inward sense what we outwardly perceive in nature, as Wordsworth suggested in "Tintern Abbey" (110). Granted, Muir's response to the high peaks was culturally conditioned, and his western wilderness something less than pristine. By proportionate comparison with many other settings, though, even the heavily touristed grounds of Yosemite qualify as wilderness. As Gary Snyder points out, large reserves are "the locus of big rich ecosystems" and thus afford "a living place for beings who can survive in no other sort of habitat." Moreover, academic bids to deconstruct preservationist ideals on the simplistic premise that all wilder- ness is a "cultural construct" have the dubious real-world consequence of bolstering "global developers," "corporate clear-cutters," and "those who would trash the Endangered Species Act" (Snyder 388). Beyond the de- monstrable protection that roadless expanses afford to species and biotic systems, such territory offers spiritual as well as many practical benefits to humans. Muir's bid for government support to preserve the aesthetic and eco- logical integrity of less settled landscapes represented a turning point in environmental history. It never purported to be a comprehensive program of environmental reform. That enterprise would also require the efforts of more urban-minded reformers, and more worldly conservationists, than Muir could ever become. Yet, as Lawrence Buell illustrates in Writing for an Endangered World (9-18), Jane Addams's campaign to open up green spaces in working-class Chicago should ultimately be recognized as complement-</page><page sequence="15">JOHN GATTA 25 ing - not contradicting - John Muir's style of advocacy. Contemporary understanding of bioregionalism also tends to confirm Muir's skepticism about the viability of large-scale water diversion projects in the arid west. One need not disdain cities to recognize that populations cannot ulti- mately be supported beyond the limits of local watersheds to sustain them. Otherwise the environment's larger capacity to sustain diversity of life, for humans and nonhumans alike, becomes compromised beyond repair. Muir's righteous zeal and anti-deterministic faith did much to inspire later proponents of environmental reform. Rachel Carson, for example, likewise rejected the materialistic premises of disinterested positivism by arguing that the earth's poisoned atmosphere confronted humankind with an ethical imperative to set matters right. It is obvious enough that moral passion, duly regulated by logic and evidence, propels the rhetoric of Silent Spring (1962). For Carson, the ethical demands flowing from "reverence for life" allied her not only to Albert Schweitzer, but also to John Muir. Though Muir's imagination rested chiefly on the high peaks while Carson's ran to the sea, both figures initiated major environmental campaigns against determined opposition. Both aroused the ire of large corporate interests and of governmental agencies including the Department of Agriculture (McCay 95). In fact, Carson reported to her dear friend Dorothy Freeman that she had been reading Muir during the last months of her life. And during the last autumn before her death in April of 1964, she made her first trip west to California. After delivering a speech in San Francisco, she welcomed the chance to view some of the region's natural splendors by invitation of David Brower, executive director of the Sierra Club. By then, however, her health had deteriorated drastically.17 On October 19, 1963, Rachel Carson paid final homage to one who led the way to her own form of prophetic witness. That Saturday she toured Muir Woods in a wheel- chair.

It appears here by permission of Oxford University Press, the book's contractual publisher. 1 . On the character and chronology of Darwinism's influence on American culture, see Persons together with Hofstadter, Bowler, Roberts, and Numbers. Although Bowler and Numbers differ on some points of their assessments (see Numbers 22, 40), they agree that American culture was particularly slow to accept Darwin's theory of natural selection even when the general principle of organic evolution gained favor. Numbers (42) also doubts that evolution was apt to precipitate any immediate religious crisis in the lives of scientific naturalists. Although Bowler minimizes the late nineteenth-century "cultural impact" (3) of materialist conceptions of nature and Darwinian natural selection, he does not attempt to discuss literary expression as an element of culture. 2. For an account of how religious attitudes varied with respect to evolution among scientific naturalists of the period, see Numbers, 24-48; for a revealing summary of attitudes adopted by other leading intellectuals and church leaders, see Miller's Introduc- tion to American Thought, xxi-xxxix, and Roberts, ix. 3. I am referring here to a cultural fable, insofar as Darwin's own, more nuanced exposition in Origins does not focus so much on combative struggle but recognizes that adaptive survival also depends largely on reproduction and food supply. 4. Accounts of the origin and character of Campbellite religious communities in relation to the Disciples of Christ and to Daniel Muir's beliefs can be found in Holmes (58-61) and Worster (191-94). 5. Holmes surveys some of the previously expressed views of Muir's religious identity in The Young John Muir (7). 6. Disparate origins of this spirituality have been considered by Stoll, Williams, Turner (67-71), and Dorman (1 12-22). 7. Ihis point has been previously acknowledged by Williams (87) and Cohen (53). 8. In JM (80), for example, Muir regards the beauty apparent even in dead flowers of "silky white-leaved Eriogonum" as demonstrating "the love and tenderness of God." See also Cohen (163.) 9. As cited by Williams (88) from a letter written by Muir in December, 1872, the expression refers to Muir's gratitude at seeing "Spirit Light" bathe California's "holy mountains" after temporarily experiencing blindness as a result of his factory accident. 10. The expression recalls Paul's language in 1 Corinthians 15.28, "that God may be all in all." 1 1. In The Young John Muir, Holmes also remarks on the Pauline overtones of Muir's ocular trauma and apparently sudden "conversion" (143n.l2). Several commentators have noted the further irony that in embracing a life devoted to the anti-mechanistic recovery of wild nature, Muir left behind a promising future as inventor of machines. 12. Cohen has pointed out Jeanne Carr's comparison of Muir to Saint Francis (11), while Worster highlights Muir's legacy of reforming Protestantism (184-202). 13. The relevant biblical reference here is to Isaiah 35.5, echoed as well in Matthew 11.5 and Luke 7.22.</page><page sequence="17">JOHN GATTA 27 1 4. See Cohen's pertinent remarks about language of the 1 964 Wilderness Act in The Pathless Way (86-87, 189-90). 15. Later incorporated into Bade's posthumously published edition of A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf, these remarks appear here in the form originally represented in Muir's journal, as cited in NW (865-86). 16. For elaboration of this point, see Turner (191, 259-63) and Cohen (184-90). 17. Accounts of Carson's trip can be found in Lear (463-65) and in Carson and Freeman (482, 485, 488).
