<plain_text><page sequence="1">The 'Bunk' coUages of Eduardo Paolozzi byJOHN-PAUL STONARD Eduardo paolozzi^ series of forty-five Bunk coUages, made by the artist in Paris and London from around 1947 to 1952, are often considered as prototypical works of Pop art. Evadne in green dimension (Fig.22), from which the series derives its title, is typical in its presentation of consumer goods, sex symbols and richly toned food advertisements, aU cut from American magazines and combined in a dynamic composition. In contrast to other coUages made by Paolozzi around the same time, which refer back to a pre-War SurreaUst aesthetic, particularly that of Kurt Schwitters or of Max Ernst, the Bunk coUages form a different category, using up-to-date colour magazine and advertising imagery, and presenting this material in a direct, non-pictorial format. However, many of the works in the series are characterised by the crudeness with which the source material has been cut and pasted down, incorporating yeUowing strips of SeUotape and affixed to sheets of card that appear recycled from previous coUages (Figs.23 and 24). This makeshift quaUty raises the question of whether the coUages were intended as works of art for display or whether they were private work ing material, along the Unes of those coUages found in the numerous scrapbooks kept by Paolozzi during the same period. Several of the series are not really coUages, but single 'tearsheets' pasted down (Figs.25 and 26). The various loca tions in which the Bunk coUages can be found further enhance the ambiguity of their material status. Where some are kept as works of art in a museum store (T?te, London), others are held in Prints and Drawings coUections (Victoria and Albert Museum, London; Scottish National GaUery of Modern Art, Edinburgh) and stiU others are stored as archival material (Art and Design Archive, Victoria and Albert Museum). Aside from several works held in private coUections, the location of about fifteen of the coUages remains so far unidentified (it must be assumed) within Paolozzi's personal archive.1 It is at least in part due to this fugitive status that a certain amount of myth has gathered around the Bunk series, not least concern ing their prophetic stature. New research, presented in this article, examines the construction of this myth, particularly in the Ught of Paolozzi's retrospective at the T?te GaUery in 1971, and the print series that was made from the coUages shortly thereafter. It is through this print series that the Bunk coUages are now commonly known, and most often displayed and illustrated. In addition, some of the source material used in the coUages is examined, reveaUng a broader field of 22. Evadne in green dimension, by Eduardo Paolozzi. 1952. CoUage, 33.1 by 25.4 cm.

(i944""45) and afterwards in London (1945-47), may have been one reason for Paolozzi's sense of his coUages as private working material.3 The coUision of his scrapbook coUage aesthetic and his exposure to SurreaUsm, in part through the agency of Nigel Henderson, whose mother, Wyn Henderson, ran the Guggenheim Jeune GaUery, London, resulted in such coUages as Butterfly, dated by Paolozzi '1946' (Fig.27).4 This work comprises a page cut from a book (in this case Albert Toft's Modelling and Sculpture, first pubUshed in 1911),5 which has been disrupted with the coUaged addition of a picture of a combustion engine in a manner reminiscent of Max Ernst. One of Paolozzi's most impressive and coherent scrapbooks, the Psychological Atlas, dated 1949, carries the subtitle 'Histoire NatureUe', referring directly to Ernst's print series of 1925, and comprises a series of ethnographicaUy oriented images that recaU earUer SurreaUst coUage.6 What we know of Paolozzi's subsequent stay in Paris for two years from June 1947 is, largely by tradition, a story recounting the vagaries of affinity and influence. He was in contact with Giacometti and Dubuffet, and was also on famiUar terms with both Tristan Tzara and Mary Reynolds, whose Duchamp coUection he saw (in particular a large coUage of magazine images that Duchamp had apparently made on a waU of Reynolds's apartment which, unusuaUy for Duchamp, has not been Usted as part of the artist's uvre).7 He read Raymond Roussel and was influenced by Roussel's method of writing with 'found' phrases, as described in his book Comment j'ai ?crit certains de mes livres (1935). The degree to which he benefited from contact with those such as Tzara remains unclear. Nigel Henderson's letters to his wife, Judith, written during a stay in Paris in 1948, reveal Paolozzi's friend ships with artists to be a series of more or less surly conquests.8 Henderson also describes both Paolozzi's love of Paris and violent reaction 'against anything "EngUsh"'.9 He recalls the material deprivations of the time, describing how he managed to procure drawing paper for Paolozzi and suggesting to Judith that it was better to bring art materials from England. Although there are no records of the details of what he saw, there is Uttle doubt that the principal influence on Paolozzi at this time was what he later termed 'the SurreaUst investigation I engaged myself in. . .'.I0 Frank Whitford has recorded the importance of Duchamp and of an exhibition of works by Max Ernst at Raymond Duncan's gaUery in Paris.11 But there was a clear distinction between the private results of these 'SurreaUst investigations' and the 'official' work that Paolozzi was making at that moment. His status was emphaticaUy that of a sculptor (at least this is how Brancusi introduced him to Braque),12 and those works on paper that he did produce were distinct in appearance from the Bunk coUages (Fig.28). They have been described as having 'nothing whatever to do with SurreaUsm and hark back to decorative Cubism and to the papiers d?coup?s of Matisse'.13 at the Central CoUecting Point, Munich, from 9th June to 19th July 1949.

(Whereabouts unknown). It is often written that Paolozzi made coUages from Ameri can magazines that he was given by ex-GIs stationed in Paris.14 Although it is plausible ? Paolozzi and his EngUsh compatri ots were very poor in comparison with American visitors - it seems unlikely that this was a regular arrangement. Paolozzi recalls that the ex-GI and painter CharUe Marks gave him a number of copies of the New York-based journal View, from which he 'reaped images to make coUages'.15 However, it is not apparent that any image from View was used in a coUage made at this time or later, and certainly none was used in the Bunk series. It is more likely that View would have been passed to him by Mary Reynolds who was the Paris representative of the magazine. In fact, the range of pubUcations used for the coUages - individual cases are detailed below - suggests a much broader pool of source material than American magazines. Indeed, the majority of the coUages were made in London after his return in 1949, where such magazines were readily available and enthusiasticaUy coUected by others associated with the Independent Group.16 Even less is known about the first pubUc presentation of the Bunk coUages at the inaugural meeting of the 'Young Group', the precursor of the Independent Group, at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in April 1952. This had been instigated by Richard Lannoy and Dorothy Morland, with the help of Toni del Renzio, to cater for the more avant-garde and inteUectual members of the Institute. Paolozzi projected coUaged images and details from these images using an epidiascope for a fairly large and select audience who had turned up for the inaugural meeting. Although there are no contemporary records, in particular of the lecture being titled 'Bunk', a number of pubUshed eyewitness accounts evoke the poignant atmosphere of the evening: 'I remember the prints steaming and peeling, and the heavy sighs of Eduardo, and the fairly sarcastic attacks of Reyner Banham', Nigel Henderson told Dorothy Morland during an interview about the ICA.17 In contrast to the intel lectual approach of Banham and others, including John McHale and Richard Hamilton, Paolozzi's approach was for Henderson refreshingly instinctive: 'What I thought uniquely valuable in Eduardo's contribution (though he was no mean articulator, but used, I thought, to get a bit muddled in his terms) was sheer drive and viriUty, the gut reaction, which was missing in the EngUsh scene'. This was the first presentation of such material in an inteUectual context, and was met with 'disbeUef and some hilarity', as Paolozzi later recorded - although this may have been due solely to Banham, whose 'chuckles' became 'open laughing', to the annoyance of many attendees.18 According to Paolozzi, the Bunk images were 'among' the material that was projected, and there is Uttle 14 For instance R.

But the material shown was of an entirely different order - scientific and anthropological, rather than popular advertising. 21 M. Middleton: Eduardo Paolozzi, London 1963, unpaginated. 22 E.

It is more plausible that Paolozzi took a selection of his coUages and scrapbooks, choosing some of the more striking images, and that some of these later became enshrined in the Bunk series. What can be stated with some certainty is that Paolozzi's presentation, although controversial, had Uttle immediate effect.20 Virtually aU accounts of Paolozzi's work pubUshed before 1971 omit any reference to the Bunk coUages. Michael Middleton's short monograph of 1962 identifies the import ance of the coUage technique, and of Paolozzi's meetings with Tzara, Giacometti and Brancusi in Paris, and his exposure to Mary Reynolds's SurreaUst coUection as weU as his reading of Roussel - but these experiences are seen as informing his sculpture.21 Middleton writes that Paolozzi's 'coUage con ception' culminated in the film History of Nothing completed the same year. Those coUages reproduced in The Metallization of a Dream (1963), an examination of Paolozzi's working material with a commentary by Lawrence AUoway, were of the 'abstract' type (Fig.28).22 AUoway's text places Paolozzi squarely in a humanistic tradition of expressive meaning: 'Let us consider Paolozzi as an example of the anthropomorphic imagination'.2^ Here there is clearly no place for Paolozzi as the critic or enthusiast of consumer culture and Americana. AUoway illustrates and describes a coUage sheet from 1954 including images of Michelangelo's David and a Churchman's cigarette card of Jack Johnson, a heavyweight boxer. Rather than a coUapsing of 'high' and 'low' categories, AUoway rec ommends Paolozzi's interest in 'patterns of connectivity': 'It is the thickness of the world and of man's artefacts in relation to man that nourishes Paolozzi's imagination'.24 The UteraUsm of Pop imagery is irrelevant ? 'the objects are turned into symbols', AUoway concludes.25 In his account of'The Devel opment of British Pop', pubUshed in 1966, AUoway describes Paolozzi as an 'important progenitor' of Pop, but there is no mention either of the Bunk coUages or the 1952 lecture.26 It was not until 1970 that the Bunk coUages resurfaced into the consciousness both of the artist and his supporters.27 Yet stiU the story emerged gradually; although Diane Kirkpatrick made what may be one of the first pubUshed references to the ICA projection in her monograph on Paolozzi pubUshed that year, none of the coUages was reproduced and the word 'Bunk' does not appear. Her description accords only in part with the series: 'The images ranging from a Swank man's jeweUery advertisement from a 193 8 magazine, through sheets 28. Lotterie, by Eduardo Paolozzi. 1947. Collage. (Whereabouts unknown). of US Army aircraft insignia and a Disney cartoon page entitled "Mother Goose Goes to HoUywood", to a scene of New York Skyscrapers with a liner steaming up a background river, a goriUa holding a swooning damsel, and a bumpy robot pouring coffee for a scantily clad example of feminine pulchritude'.28 The year 1970 was important for the reception of Pop art in Britain. As Ben Highmore has recently noted with reference to Richard Hamilton, it was in that year that the 'teleological story' of Pop art was estabUshed: 'the story of how Richard Hamilton and other members of the Inde pendent Group produced a prescient variety of pop art that would go on to become a fuUy fledged movement, paraUeUng its US variant'.29 If Hamilton, as Highmore suggests, was estabUshed as the progenitor of Pop by his 1970 T?te GaUery retrospective, then it was at least in part as a response to this that the T?te retrospective of Paolozzi's work just over one year later similarly estabUshed his reputation.30 This was the first time the coUages had been shown in pubUc since the 1952 projection.31 It is clear from Paolozzi's printed annotations in the exhibition catalogue - dates and comments written next to reproductions of the Bunk coUages ? that he was concerned to estabUsh their precedent in the swiftly emerging story of Pop. This point was not lost on close observers: Nigel Hen derson, in a letter to his mother, described the process in rather caustic terms: 'There is a big attempt, both in the exhibition] and in the catalogue to give him [Paolozzi] primogeniture in the "Pop" idiom and, without doubt, here my testimony is being soUcited'.

Noting that Stuart Davis and Fernand L?ger may equaUy be considered as forerunners of Pop, Henderson continues: ... I would give Hamilton priority over EP, probably on the grounds that the former traded under the sign of Pop long before the latter who was so busy trying to satisfy, flatter and please aU &amp; sundry (including himself) and, lack ing (at that time, anyway) any revolutionary identification, fa?ed to see the possibiUties of Pop as a graphic weapon of social change. I think he now sees it and regrets it and would Uke to falsify the record: for at the T?te he showed lots of things torn from notebooks or portfoUos (some of which I can remember) of early date and which, though diminutive, look authentic Pop by virtue of the idiom which others have pioneered &amp; some taken risks for. But the point is that Paolozzi didn't show these naughty, mocking irreverent documents, didn't take the risk of offending those in high places which part of his ItaUan heritage makes him flatter and seek - for reasons of personal prestige and gain.32 Henderson's comments are in some respects unfair - Paolozzi did show his coUages (in 1952, and also his scrapbooks two years later at the ICA exhibition Collages and Objects), and his reluctance to develop the highly original use of popular adver tising material was due at least in part to the negative response to his bold ICA epidiascope projection. But it is also indisput able that Paolozzi wanted to estabUsh his 'primogeniture' in a manner that placed a heavy burden on hindsight. One of the more weU-known coUages from the series, I was a rich man's plaything (Fig.29), was annotated by Paolozzi in the T?te cata logue with 'The First Use of Pop? CoUage, 1947'.33 There is no guarantee that the coUage was indeed made at this early date, and even so, the use of the word 'Pop' (taken, as Paolozzi later recaUed, from the packet of a toy gun) was fortuitous, and was by no means understood at this time as it was from the mid-1950s by those associated with the Independent Group. Paolozzi may nevertheless have considered the T?te retrospective as something of a missed opportunity. In the introductory text to the print portfoUo Cloud Atomic Labora tory (1971), also shown in the T?te exhibition ofthat year, Paolozzi complains that the 'radical nature of this lecture [the 1952 projection] has never properly been assessed but is nevertheless homogeneous with the current paintings and sculptures'.34 Although the T?te retrospective catalogue mentions the epidiascope projection as part of a history of the Independent Group, and the complete series of forty-five coUages was iUustrated, the word 'bunk' was not mentioned in relation to either, and it was clear that the story of Bunk had yet to be properly formulated. Further, the coUages had stiU at this point not been given titles - Evadne in green dimen sion is annotated 'CoUage, 1952'.

During an interview the foUowing year Paolozzi responded evasively to the question as to whether the forty-five coUages formed a complete unit before the T?te exhibition, stating only that 'some were chopped up, as I said, and used, and thrown away', but then confirming that aU of the Bunk coUages were used in the 1952 ICA lecture.35 The later dates of a selection of the coUages indicates that this cannot be entirely true. That even the title Bunk was chosen at this time (there is no documentary record of it referring to the 1952 epidiascope projection) and had not previously been associated with this particular set of coUages can be inferred from Paolozzi's description of the screenprint B.A.S.H., which was produced at the time of the T?te retrospective. In his account of B.A.S.H., pubUshed in the Observer Magazine three days before the opening of the T?te exhibition, Paolozzi states that he had originaUy wanted to caU the work 'Bunk!' as a way of distinguishing it from Pop.36 The T?te retrospective included, as the press release revealed, a 'continuous sUde show of images from popular sources, similar to those which Paolozzi projected at the now historic first meeting of the Independent Group in 1952'.37 Again, there was no mention of the word 'bunk' in relation to the projection. Paolozzi had begun planning the creation of a print port foUo of the Bunk coUages at the time of the T?te exhibition. Given the availabiUty of the coUaged material that he had amassed and his concern to pubUcise his pioneering interest and display of such material, it was a natural choice to return to the early coUages. The degree to which the Bunk series was in fact created at this point has rarely been observed: Marco Livingstone is one of the few writers to have acknowledged their retrospective evaluation.38 Alongside the pubUcation of the coUages as prints, it was at this moment that the original coUages were accorded fuU artistic status and began to enter museum coUections. FoUowing his retrospective Paolozzi donated ten of the Bunk coUages to the T?te GaUery (see Appendix for details).39 As a letter from Pichard Morphet to Paolozzi of the foUowing year makes clear, Paolozzi had offered clarification on the titles of the individual coUages by providing the T?te with the information sheets that were to accompany the print series.40 A description of the creation of the print portfoUo is beyond the scope of this article.41 It is important however to note that the first fuU and complete catalogue list of the series, with titles, was created for the boxed set of prints (produced in an edition of fifty deluxe sets and one hundred standard sets, with an introductory essay by Frank Whitford). The Ufe of Bunk from that moment forward is the Ufe of the print series, rather than the coUages themselves, some of which, Paolozzi later claimed, were at that point thrown away.42 A touring exhibition the next year titled Bunk. A box-file of images in print, organised by the Victoria and Albert Museum, conso?dated pubUc knowledge of the series. The story was further galvanised by Wieland Schmied's essay 'Bunk, Bash and Pop', first pubUshed in the catalogue of Paolozzi's exhibition at the Nationalgalerie, 3?

From then, pubUcations dispensed with Paolozzi the BrutaUst sculptor and grounded his 'coUage conception' in the early coUages, the visit to Paris, the contact with SurreaUsm and the famous lecture at the ICA on his return. The catalogue for his 1976 exhibition at the Kestner GeseUschaft in Hanover contains a smaU selection of the Bunk coUages interspersed with spreads from the Psycho logical Atlas scrapbook. Most of the catalogue texts dealt with the Bunk coUages and the questions raised by them. Against this background of reception and reassessment, a more detailed analysis of individual works may be offered. The sheer number of images compUcates such an analysis, as does the lack of narrative progression through the series and the apparently random order in which they are pre sented. For the sake of clarity, comment on the themes and sources by which the coUages are related may be set out by dividing the series into three main types. First, the 'ready made' type, or single unaltered tearsheet; second, the 'layout proposition' type, which sees Paolozzi apparently experi menting with page layout schemes; and last the 'composite' type, more pictorial coUages that relate to a tradition that may be traced back to the Dada photomontage of Hannah Hoch and Raoul Hausmann. 36. Yours till the boys come home, by Eduardo Paolozzi. 1951. Collage, 36.2 by 24.8 cm. (T?te, London). Paolozzi retrospectively referred to the source material for his coUages as 'ready made metaphors', but the category can be further refined to refer to those Bunk works that are not in fact coUages but simply tearsheets re-presented as works of art.45 Of these, Vogue gorilla with Miss Harper (Fig.33) is the most direct presentation of an image cut from a magazine (in this case the source is indicated in the title) and presented whole. Comparison of several works of this 'readymade' type shows that Paolozzi's principle of selection was often deter mined by the 'coUaged' nature of the source - unexpected juxtapositions that often take on a trompe-l' il quaUty.

The cartoon character painted onto the fuselage of the aircraft appears at first sight to have been coUaged onto it by Paolozzi himself, but is in fact part of the source photograph. It is taken from an article iUustrating the informal customising of American aircraft by their crews - a type of vernacular proto-Pop art, it may be suggested.46 Other 'readymade' coUages are presented in the form of magazine covers, such as Was this metal monster master or slave? (Fig. 3 2), which shows the cover of a science fiction magazine dated February 1952. The cover of Time magazine used for Will man outgrow the earth? (Fig.31) is dated 8th December 1952, but the wear and tear on the cover suggests that at least a few months, if not more, had passed before Paolozzi affixed it to a backing sheet and preserved it as a coUage - an important point to bear in mind.47 EquaUy intriguing 'readymade' tearsheets are those taken directly from magazine articles. Fantastic weapons contrived (taken from Life International of 24th September 1951; Fig.26) presents a single unaltered page from an article about the 'fantastic' atomic weapons announced in Congress by President Truman earUer that year.48 A strange coUage of two pages, one from Time magazine of March 1952, is presented in Electric arms and hands also showing love is better than ever, the title taken from a coUaged sentence constructed from the two sheets.49 That the front page of a newspaper or a single sheet from a magazine could be considered a work of art was suggested in 1951 by MarshaU McLuhan in his book The Mechanical Bride. 38.

As with Fun helped them fight, Paolozzi has selected a deceptive image of collage in the real world - here the two female figures that appear to be standing on the lorry are cardboard cut-outs.52 Four further collages of the 'layout' type are related by a single source. Windtunnel test shows six images of a man's face at pro gressive stages of distortion with exposure to a high-velocity air current. The collage itself has been inscribed with its source: US Camera from 1950.53 This was an annual compendium of the work of well-known professional photographers, includ ing both reportage and 'art' photography. The sequence of the photographs in Windtunnel test has been switched to disrupt a chronological reading, and the sheets have been affixed to a sheet of blue paper which itself appears to be attached to the detached front or back boards of a book. Trigger assembly removal (Fig. 3 4) is a similar rearrangement of sequential images taken from the same edition of US Camera, 'strobe-strip' photographs of the well-known striptease artist Winnie Garret taken by the photographer Phillipe Halsman (Fig. 3 5).54 Halsman's photographs were also used in Yours till the boys come home (Fig. 3 6), which combines the two larger images of Winnie Garret with three of an aircraft after an accident, taken from the same edition of US Camera.^ These crash photo graphs were taken by Naval photographers in the Pacific during the War, and were chosen by 'Capt. Edward Steichen, in command of Navy Combat photography' as a tribute to war photographers.56 Winnie Garret's pose in the top photograph is dramatised by its combination with the flight deck crash, while the naval photographs take their place within the erotic sequence. Again, McLuhan's analysis of American advertising in The Mechanical Bride provides illuminating contemporary background to Paolozzi's preoccupations, particularly his description of advertising as a revelation of the 'interfusion of sex and technology'.57 In effect, Yours till the boys come home shows Paolozzi taking raw photographic material and creating juxtapositions that adopt the language of advertising without referring to a particular product. For sale, it may be said, is the language of advertising itself. Paolozzi repeated this combination in a further collage made with material from US Camera of 1950, the collage Take-off (Fig.39), showing a leaping ice skater whose pose provides a dynamic response to the image above of a plane preparing for take-off. Both these images derive from a double-page spread in the advertising section of US Camera of 1950 (Fig.37).58 A further common source for collage material was the Ladies' Home Journal, a leading American magazine and one of the most frequently cited sources of advertising imagery for English artists in the post-War period.59 Advertisements 51 The format is used elsewhere to create front- and back-cover spreads. The ultimate planet combines the cover of Thrilling Wonder Stories, a collection of pulp science fic tion published in April 1949, and Science Fantasy (Spring 1952), published just in time for the ICA projection. Similarly, Headlines from horrorsville shows the cover of the first issue of Unknown Worlds (1948) and that of Popular Mechanics from January 1951. 52 A similar combination of serious and popular science is provided by Merry Xmas with T-i space suits, which shows an image of T-i Space Suits', constructed from a double page spread over a similarly patched-together image of toy 'rocket guns and inter planetary ships' which will 'whoosh down U.S. chimneys for 1952's space-suited kids'. ?

(Collection Jeffery Sherwin). THE 'BUNK' COLLAGES OF EDUARDO PAOLOZZI ?e MARVIN*-* 43. Double-page spread from the Yale Iron scrapbook, by Eduardo Paolozzi. (Krazy Kat Arkive, Victoria and Albert Museum, London) for Johnson's Baby Powder, featuring a giant baby and diminutive mother appeared in the magazine around 1946 to 1947, four of which were brought together by Paolozzi to form See them? A baby's life is not all sunshine! (Fig.38).60 Paolozzi also mined the Ladies' Home Journal for source material to create It's a psychological fact pleasure helps your disposition, the title of which was a slogan used for a number of years to advertise Camel cigarettes, here taken as a general mantra of the meeting of psychology, consumption and the new concept of market research. Both interiors depicted in the collage were taken from the same issue of the Ladies' Home Journal (April 1947), the top from an advertise ment for gasoline (p.86), the bottom from an advertisement for Johnson's Glo-Coat floor polish (p.no). It is clear that Paolozzi's intention in pasting in figures from other advertise ments61 was not to create collage-like discrepancies of scale or Surreal juxtapositions of foreign bodies, but rather to create a new, seamless image. This effect may be seen in a number of the Bunk works. Whereas photographic images, or at least magazine spreads, were selected on the basis that they were already collage, a sort of pr?-collage perhaps, Paolozzi's manipulation of the material often 'de-collages' the material, in the sense of creating new naturalistic scenarios (for similar seamless collages, see Appendix, nos.13, 30 and 35). Hender son was right to suggest that the Bunk collages were by no means 'graphic weapons of social change'.62 The third group within the Bunk series can be identified from their composite, pictorial nature. Although these too are hardly 'graphic weapons', and may even be described in terms of a consumerist pastoral, they still more readily evoke the traditional photomontage of John Heartfield or Max Ernst. Paolozzi is at his most critical when he is effacing works of art - or at least reproductions. Sack-o-sauce affixes a variety of popular imagery, including a hand proffering a tin of Wiener hot dogs containing its own 'sack of sauce', over a work by Joan Mir? - in this case a photolithograph called Summer taken from Verve of October 1938. The new landscape Paolozzi creates seems at least partially sympathetic to the original. His treatment of another source is far more dismissive. Although Evadne in green dimension (Fig.22) gives the series its name by the inclusion of the word 'Bunk!',63 the strange title of the work is derived from a painting by the German ?migr? impresario Jack Bilbo. A one-time bodyguard of Al Capone and career conman, Bilbo turned to art and opened a gallery of modern painting, improbably, in London during the Blitz.64 In 1948 he published his vastly egotistical autobiography, com plete with extensive text and numerous images, reproduced as stuck-down plates.65 His painting Evadne in green dimension, from 1945, is typical of his amateur efforts, and Paolozzi clear ly had no reservations about dispensing with the pasted-down illustration and using both the page and (when he came to naming the collage in 1972) the title of Bilbo's painting. The title sheds little light on the subject of the collage, which shows a bodybuilder and pin-up figure in a relation that looks forward to the Adam and Eve characters that were to appear in Richard Hamilton's Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? (1956). As with Hamilton's collage, most of Paolozzi's titles are derived from advertising copy, and often 60 The tide, first given in the 1972 print portfolio, is a misreading of the slighdy unusual typeface, partly missing from the original advertisement, which appeared in April 1946, that reads 'See Mom? A Baby's Life isn't all Sunshine!'. 61 The bottom figure is found in an advertisement for Simoniz floor polish, includ ed in the Ladies' Home Journal (June 1949). 62 Other images of the 'layout' type are: Man holds the key; Has jazz a future?; Hazards include dust, hailstones and bullets, which was paired with Survival in the 1972 portfolio; Poor Eleanor knows them by heart; Shots from peep show, which appears at first as a 'ready made' tearsheet, but a closer look reveals that the figure on the right is collaged; and Never leave well enough alone, the only image listed in the 1971 T?te catalogue as a 'Scrapbook page', and which may still exist as such. Its tide is that of the autobiography of Raymond Loewy, the designer of the Studebaker illustrated on the left side. 6J The source for the Charles Adas figure is often given as the December 1936 issue of Mechanics and Handicraft (e.g., M. Francis: Pop, London 2005, p.51). This is visibly not the case as a comparison of the lettering for the word 'Bunk!' shows. An exam ple of the advertisement for the Charles Adas 'dynamic tension' method can be found in the October 1952 issue of Gljoe comic. 64 See J. Vinzent: 'Muteness as Utterance of a Forced Reality -Jack Bilbo's Modern Art Gallery (1941-1948)', in S. Behr and M. Malet, eds.: Arts in Exile in Britain 1933-1945.

Bilbo: Jack Bilbo, an autobiography, London 1948. Other collages by Paolozzi, though not from the Bunk series, use illustrated pages torn from Bilbo's book and replicate the tides, for instance Holiday and Sadistic confession, both erroneously dated to 1947. THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE CL APRIL 2008 247</page><page sequence="11">THE 'BUNK' COLLAGES OF EDUARDO PAOLOZZI appear within the collage itself. You'll soon be congratulating yourself! (Fig.40) is a precursor of Hamilton's collage, using an earlier advertisement for Armstrong Floors (Hamilton had used one published in 1955) and similarly taking the title from a line in the advertising copy, visible just above the image.66 One further source may be used to group the works. The backing sheet for You'll soon be congratulating yourself! was taken from an unidentified book on interior decoration, which was also used as the basis for two other 'composite' collages from the Bunk series. Paolozzi often used printed books as scrapbooks, and it is likely that these collages were taken from such a source. Meet the people is made from five elements affixed to a page from this spiral-bound book, including a large photograph of the Hollywood actress Lucille Ball. As Mark Francis has noted, Paolozzi dated the collage to the same year that Ball became a household name, owing to her success in the CBS radio programme My Favourite Husband. She was a 'commonly recognised icon in magazines and on the airwaves, Uke the food and drink products, the serving suggestions and the mouse cartoon character, which all seem to be vying for equal billing in the artist's composition'.67 The point is important ? within the composite type images, but also with the series as a whole, Paolozzi appears intent on creating some sort of natural space where heterogeneous elements can co-exist: collage is used as a way of creating links and associations, rather than forcing dissonance. A sheet from the spiral-bound decoration book was also used as a backing for a further collage of the composite type, Real gold (Fig.41). The title derives from the tin of Real Gold lemon juice, displaying two ripe fruit that Paolozzi has cheerily juxtaposed with the bosom of the cover girl of Breezy Stories. This is the 1948 British edition of the magazine (Paolozzi has obscured these cover details with the orange star bearing the numeral '6').68 Many advertising sources similar to those used in Meet the people and Real gold can be found in Paolozzi's Yale Iron scrapbook (so called because of the advertisement for Yale domestic irons pasted on the cover; Fig.43).69 Yale Iron is distinct from the nine other scrapbooks held in this archive (in particular from the Pyschological Atlas, mentioned above) in that it comprises glossy colour advertisements taken exclusively from Ladies' Home Journal type pubUcations. None of the Bunk collages was taken from the Yale Iron scrapbook, which remains intact, and is more of an archival accumulation of material. Refreshing and delicious (Fig.42) is also of the 'Yale Iron' type, showing on the left side an advertisement for Ivory Flakes washing powder, taken from the Ladies' Home Journal (April 1947), and on the right side an advertisement for Kool-Aid, taken from the July 1949 issue of the same magazine (the facing page of which provided the Planter's advertisement used in What a treat for a nickel f).

Only a selection of source material and contextual inform ation can be presented here. Themes identified, including the collaged nature of source material, 'collage in the real world', perhaps; the combination of female figures and technology, particularly miUtary; the overwriting of fine art with popular imagery, as well as the repeated use of particular source books and magazines, may be extended to other collages in the series, and also to the numerous images in contemporaneous scrapbooks. A further question that can be dealt with only briefly here is that of dating. It is widely held that the dating of many of the collages is spurious and, as examples cited above show, these suspicions are entirely justified. In some cases Paolozzi's backdating of the collages is obvious, and na?ve. The dynamics of biology is given in the 1971 T?te catalogue as 1950, but shows clearly the source image as the cover of Life magazine of 22nd September 1952. But this should not always be taken as evidence of a breathless effort to estabUsh 'primogeniture'; two decades had elapsed, and the exact sequence was most probably beyond accurate recall. It seems clear from their physical condition that certain tearsheets, in particular comic and magazine covers, were affixed in their current form much later than the 1952 projection. Hi-Ho (Fig.44), for example, features the cover of the second issue of Hi-Ho Comics, pub Ushed in 1946 (showing the character 'Lil Chief Hot Shot' attacking a character who may be identified with a Japanese soldier), above which are pasted a fantasy mechanical skeleton of a man and an unappetising plate of food. The elements are 66 The female figure collaged naturalisticaUy into the interior is the actress Paulette Goddard, taken from an advertisement for Lipton Tea from the Ladies' Home Journal (April 1947). 67 Francis, op. cit. (note 63), p.51. 68 The striking cover is by the illustrator Enoch Bolles, often credited with creating the pin-up genre. His female figures have been described as the 'embodiment of several styles and eras; from the Edwardian, to the flapper to the vamp'; see J.

The date given in the 1971 T?te catalogue is 1947, although the state of the cover of the comic book indicates more than a year's wear. A similar point may be made for You can't beat the real thing (Fig.24), which comprises a cover for Cover Girls Models magazine of October 1951 placed over the cover of another magazine dated January 1950, which can be identified as Scientific American. An advertisement for Firestone Tyres has been placed beneath the model, identified as Lila Leeds (the 'Bad Girl' Hollywood actress who was notorious for having been arrested in 1948 with Robert Mitchum and charged with possession of marijuana). In both cases it seems that Paolozzi dated the collage to the year of pubUcation of the source mate rial, which may suggest that as 'readymades' this date was more important than the year the collage was assembled. Beyond the question of dating, the poor physical quaUty of the collages is of interest for other, more interpretative, reasons. It was only once used-up, out-of-date, creased, stained and torn that the sources became viable as collage material. Paolozzi appears to have been strongly aware of this, once recording that 'the word collage is inadequate because the concept should include damage, erase, destroy, deface and transform - all parts of a metaphor for the creative act itself .7?A new brand of brilliance (Fig.23) uses the cover of Picture Post from 13 th March 1943, showing Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth dancing, below which the banner from a later issue of the same pubUcation (2nd October 1943) has been affixed. The importance of the damage to the cover, which is held together with sections of brown gum strip, is signified by its accurate reproduction in the 1972 Uthograph of the coUage (although the original coUage has not been located, it is reasonable to assume that it is the source of these signs of wear). Winfried Konnertz compares Paolozzi's efforts to reproduce these signs of damage and rudimentary repair with Duchamp's creation of his Bo?te-en-valise, although the comparison may be better made with the Green box, for which Duchamp recreated the many irregular scraps of paper that contained notes relating to the Large glass.11 The comparison may also be extended to Duchamp's readymades themselves, which suffered neglect for a number of years, and in a number of cases were thrown away, before being revived through repUcas made at a much later date. It may seem as integral to the fate of 'readymade' art that it sustains a burden of anonymity before achieving full artistic value, but only as a result of nostalgia for lost origins. It is in this sense that the notion of the readymade converges with that of reception in the historiography of art. In a different context, Boris Groys has described the conservative, even reactionary affinity between art and 'garbage' as an 'aestheticisation of poverty' that reflects on the 'electness' of art - 'the miracle of value produced by a single touch of the artist or saint'.72 In either case, behind both the original creation of the Bunk series and their repUcation as a print series in 1972 is an impulse towards preservation of the forgotten and the devalued, or perhaps an ecological principle of recycUng and revaluation, which was to become one of the most saUent, yet unexamined, aspects of Pop art.
