The Art Bulletin publishes leading scholarship in the English lan guage in all aspects of art history as practiced in the academy, muse ums, and other institutions. From its founding in 1913 the journal has published, through rigorous peer review, scholarly articles and critical reviews of the highest quality in all areas and periods of the history of art. Articles take a variety of methodological approaches, from the his torical to the theoretical. In its mission as ajournai of record The Art Bulletin fosters an intensive engagement with intellectual developments and debates in contemporary art historical practice. The journal wel comes submissions from scholars worldwide and at every career stage. Statement on the Importance of Documenting the Historical Context of Objects and Sites The College Art Association expresses its con demnation of illicit or otherwise questionable practices in the obtain ing of archaeological, artistic, and ethnic objects, whether these are by theft, excavation, export, trade, or the wrongful seizure from legiti mate owners due to war, insurrection, or civil disturbance. Through the scholarly mission of its journals, The Art Bulletin, Art Journal, and caa.reviews, as well as through its programs and newsletters, the Col lege Art Association remains committed to its role in the dissemina tion of information to its membership and expects to contribute toward a dialogue and a better understanding of the issues of context and documentation of objects, and the historical circumstances of their ownership. As a result, the College Art Association discourages practices or procedures that might be construed as giving sanction to the acquisition, trade, and financial enhancement of cultural artifacts inappropriately excavated, collected, or appropriated. Authors sub mitting manuscripts for publication in The Art Bulletin, Art Journal, and caa.reviews should document, to the best extent possible, the prove nance history of objects acquired since the UNESCO draft Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property of 1972. The editor-in-chief, in consultation with advisors and/or the Editorial Board, reserves the right to request further information from authors when deemed necessary.

Captions in The Art Bulletin and Art Journal use standardized language to describe image copyright and credit information, in order to clarify the copyright status of all images repro duced so far as possible, for the benefit of readers, research ers, and subsequent users of these images. Information on the copyright status of a reproduction is placed within parentheses, at the end of the caption data. A distinction is made between copyright status of an artwork and of the photograph of an artwork, where this information has been provided to us. In order to provide clear information to readers, rights hold ers, and subsequent users of images, CAA has established conventions for describing the copyright status of the works we publish: Artwork in the public domain Artwork copyright ? Name Photograph copyright ? Name Photograph provided by [name of photographer, image bank, or other provider] Artwork published under fair use Photography by Name (where copyright is not asserted by the provider) Photograph by the author Where the information is available, a work of art is identified as being either in copyright or in the public domain. If the copy right holder is known, it is identified. If an artwork is in the public domain but copyright is asserted in the photograph of the artwork, the copyright status of both artwork and photo graph is identified in two discrete notices. However, a caption may contain no copyright information at all, where none is available. The absence of a copyright notice or a ?^symbol should not be assumed to indicate that an image is either in or out of copyright. Similarly, the absence of any statement that a work is "in the public domain" should not be construed as indicating that it is not in the public domain?only that information was insufficient for the editors to make a determination. Reproductions of pictures of material not subject to copyright may have caption information that contains copyright information for the photograph but not for the content of the photograph. Where permission was requested from a rights holder, the lan guage requested by that rights holder is used, in some instances edited for clarity. The term "photograph provided by" is used to indicate the supplier of the photograph. "Courtesy of" is not used. The term of copyright varies internationally, and CAA does not assert that a work identified as in the public domain is necessarily out of copyright throughout the world. Where the caption indicates that we are asserting fair use, we make that assertion only under United States law. The authors and publisher make reasonable efforts to ascertain the rights status of all third-party works. Any corrections should be sent to the attention of the Director of Publications, CAA.</page><page sequence="5">Publication of The Art Bulletin is made possible by membership support and by contributions from individuals and institutions.

Considered as visual exegesis, Bles's landscape is closely related to the Christian idea of the Book of Nature and to Erasmus's thought. Erasmus conceived of exegesis as a dialectical tension between the two extremes of literal and spiritual meaning, a tension reconciled in the figure of paradox, the allegorical enigma. When Bles's landscape is interpreted in this way, the presence of a crypto-anthropomorphosis becomes apparent. This visual device beckons the viewer toward conversion. MICHEL WEEMANS 459 Sex and Spirituality in 1500s Rome: Sebastiano del Piombo's Martyrdom of Saint Agatha Sebastiano's Martyrdom of Saint Agatha is only one example of an early-six teenth-century religious image that deliberately evokes erotic desire in the viewer. The figure of Saint Agatha, derived from a broken sculpture of Venus with the features of a beautiful contemporary, was intended to provoke lust in its original owner, a young cardinal pilloried for his homosexual activity. The essential ambivalence of this work and others of the same genre should be seen in the context of Roman attitudes to sexuality: clerics were, in principle, admonished to live chastely, but in practice were likely to be sexually active. JILL BURKE 482 Treasuring the Gaze: Eye Miniature Portraits and the Intimacy of Vision A peculiar whim of sentimental jewelry, eye miniature portraits became the fashion about 1800 in northern Europe, in particular among British aristo crats. Exchanged as tokens of affection between lovers, friends, and family members, these small images depicting the eyes of individuals have a double investment in the visual as representations as well as agents of vision. These portrayals of the gaze differ from regular miniature portraits in that they are not objects of contemplation but instead entail a reversal of the object and subject of looking. As such, they offer a prephotographic instance of "being HANNEKE GROOTENBOER 496 Allan Ramsay's Enlightenment: Or, Hume and the Patronizing Portrait Were Georgian portraitists capable of making philosophical "arguments in paint"? This question, raised by Edgar Wind in a formative 1932 article, provides the departure point for an examination of Allan Ramsay's paired portraits of David Hume and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Drawing on popular visual conventions, Ramsay constructed a dialogue between Hume's "patron izing" worldview, particularly in regard to ?lite patronage and colonial Amer ican rule, and Rousseau's espousal of sentimental autonomy. Ramsay's por traits were philosophical, it appears, to the extent that they brought Hume's philosophy to bear on imminent political and imperial concerns. DOUGLAS FORDHAM 508</page><page sequence="7">Ingres's Studio between History and Allegory: Rachel, Antiquity, and Trag?die SARAH BETZER 525 In 1855, critics attacked Amaury-Duval's allegorical portrait Tragedy for its studiously classicizing, desexed, mortified, and ultimately incomprehensible representation of the famed Jewish tragedienne Rachel. At the heart of the painting's critical failure was its work as allegory. In other representations of Rachel by Amaury-Duval, J.-A.-D. Ingres, and Th?odore Chass?riau allegory was employed to negotiate the temporal rupture between a phantasmatic "antique" past and contemporary artistic identities. Read against the changing status of allegory, these works reveal allegory's instrumentality for grappling with problems of portraiture and history and suggest its essential role as the "scaffolding of the modern." Woman with a Fan: Paul Gauguin's Heavenly Vairaumati?a Parable of Immortality Woman with a Fan (1902) is the culmination of Gauguin's representations of the Tahitian goddess of regeneration. His depiction of Vairaumati frames his intertwined aesthetic and spiritual beliefs. Her fan signals her immortal status and, through its blue, white, and red ornament, Gauguin's revolutionary call to "the right to dare all." This justifies his assimilation of multiple sources, which, through a process he called transposition, took on new life. Thus, the regeneration epitomized by Vairaumati is implemented in the pictorial dy namic through the mutation of the sources that constitute her identity, tying the permutations of art to the soul's immortality. JUNE HARGROVE 552 A Newer Protagoras In 1929, The Art Bulletin published a mock Platonic dialogue, "The New Protagoras," by the philosopher and historian of art theory A. Philip McMa hon; it summarized current thinking about art and art history, proposing that an idealistic aesthetics could serve as a corrective to the excesses of science, and that a future art history might seek to effect the critical integration of those seemingly incompatible approaches. "A Newer Protagoras" starts from the premise that seventy-seven years later, the inhabitants of Elysium would need further help making sense of the earthly intellectual landscape. Two disciples attempt to bring the Sophist Protagoras up-to-date. ROBERT WILLIAMS AND CHRISTOPHER S.
