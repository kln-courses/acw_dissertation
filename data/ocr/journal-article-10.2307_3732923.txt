<plain_text><page sequence="1">LOVE, ALIENATION, AND THE ABSURD: THREE PRINCIPAL THEMES IN CESAR VALLEJO'S TRILCE It is not unusual for readers of Cesar Vallejo's poetry to be struck by the differences between his first book of poems, Los heraldos negros, published in 191 9, and his second book, Trilce, which followed in 1922. For many, Trilce represents an abrupt and mystifying leap forward from the departures made in Los heraldos negros, in which Vallejo reached the culmination of his technical achievements in a manner so prodigious and demanding that some important, intermediate stage seems to have been left out. Formal techniques excepted, however, the differences are not as great as they might seem, and the reader's surprise is likely to be due as much to the traditional tendency to underestimate the innovative achievements of Los heraldos negros as to the challenge posed by Trilce. It is, after all, easier to dwell upon the first book's identifiable affinities with Latin-American modernismo and nineteenth-century French poetry than to embrace the originality of the highly personal statements it contains. Certainly the poetic forms employed offer recognizable signposts. Poems exist under separate titles and have clearly distinguishable beginnings and ends. They are arranged in groups around specific themes and subjects which have a kind of internal continuity. Eighteen poems are written in a more or less conventional sonnet form; the familiar hendecasyllabic and heptasyllabic lines are commonly used, the alexandrine also. Stanzaic structures predominate, the majority made up from verses of three or four lines, though the length of these varies. Yet it is clearly evident that Vallejo is straining away from the conventional idioms of post- modernistas such as Herrera y Reissig, and that within the reassuringly familiar verse forms he employs neologisms, redeploys syntactical and grammatical functions, introduces colloquialisms and indigenous themes, develops effects through reitera- tion and assonance, and often dispenses with rhyme in favour of flexible lines relying upon natural stress rather than syllable counts. More important, however, Los heraldos negros articulates what was to remain the permanent centre of Vallejo's poetry; his preoccupation with suffering as a pre- condition of individual existence in a random world that is ruled by arbitrary natural forces. In Los heraldos negros he systematically displaces God from the centre of the universe. The sense of personal alienation and spiritual disinheritance (summed up in the word abandono) revealed in the process is so acute that even love and family ties cannot blunt it, and the two emotions are presented as equivocal, though the philosophical implications of this position are not fully explored. The demolition of the old ideologies is achieved by a reductive trivialization of the symbols of Christianity and the notion of God as divine architect; one in which irony, both in ideas and language, is already at work, creating the ideal take-off point from which to attempt the leap into space that was Trilce. In Los heraldos negros therefore, Vallejo has already burnt a number of artistic boats, and by the middle of 1920, less than a year after its delayed publication, many of the Trilce poems were already written. Jean Franco hails Trilce as 'an extreme book, revolutionary in its exploration of an authentic language', and goes on to comment on what she sees as Vallejo's conviction that modern civilization was</page><page sequence="2">604 Three Principal Themes in 'Trilce' fragmenting through lack of a unifying logos to replace the outworn images of art and religion. But she subsequently points out that Vallejo also realized that conscious- ness and language were indivisible, and that no renewal of the latter could take place which did not entail the renewal of the former. In Trilce, therefore, Vallejo was obliged to undertake a task of artistic demystification, one that demonstrated 'the inoperability of traditional images and metaphors, the speciousness of harmony in the Modernist sense'.1 In doing so, however, he is obliged to use the debunker's traditional tools: irony, parodic allusion, and verbal games and puns, in fact a display of neo-Baroque tropes and techniques that result in poems that are the antithesis of everything that post-Romantic, symbolist, and modernist schools of thought stood for. In this respect the anti-divine, anti-heroic, satirical poetry of Trilce completes the work begun in Los heraldos negros. Vallejo was clearly aware, in the transition from the one to the other, that what he was doing would not be without problems, in relation both to the reception of the new work and to his future direction as an artist. His letter on the subject to his friend Antenor Orrego in 1921 makes some rather over-stated claims, but demonstrates his determination to take the sole responsibility for Trilce upon himself: 'El libro ha nacido en el mayor vacio. Asumo toda la responsabilidad de su estetica. Hoy, y mas que nunca quizas, siento gravitar sobre mi una hasta ahora desconocida obligacion sacratisima de hombre y de artista jla de ser libre!'2 The poet thus saw Trilce not only as an artistic statement but also as a gauntlet thrown down against the outdated tastes and standards of a narrow-minded and conservative public, and those critics (such as Clemente Palma) who represented them. Eduardo Neale Silva's reading of the first and last poems of the book (Trilce I and LXXVII) suggests that Trilce i, a particularly challenging and difficult text, has as its theme the task and position of the artist who functions in isolation in the face of the uncomprehending majority, while Trilce LXXVII explores the unpredictable nature of poetic inspiration.3 These two apart, however, there is, intrinsic to every other poem in the book, a declaration of independence which was to cost Vallejo dearly. The reception accorded to Trilce in Lima - a mixture of incomprehension and hostility - was not altogether unexpected (at least from some quarters) but the general lack of any real impact on the artistic life of the capital must have been somewhat mortifying. Far from being the centre of a cause celebre, the book was simply passed over, and this no doubt played its part in Vallejo's decision in I923 to leave Peru for Paris.

BRITTON What, then, did Vallejo's determination to create something new and liberating in terms of poetic form amount to? Trilce consists of seventy-seven poems, or poetic reflections, separated from one another by Latin numerals. Rhyme and the conven- tional syllabic line forms have been dispensed with, the poet adopting instead a free-verse form which often defies the reader to distinguish between poetry and cadent prose, depending upon the degree of control over the poems' structure exerted by the stress-based rhythms.4 This freedom of form brings with it the freedom of language that Vallejo also sought. An eclectic and complex web of thoughts and associations finds a dense, concentrated expression through the devices of metaphor, metonymy, ellipsis, and allusion, the poems displaying a high level of introversion and being almost devoid of external descriptive details. Normal syntax is often ignored and orthographic conventions changed. Neologisms, whose function is also to achieve semantic or conceptual compression, are introduced. The result is a pruning away of everything which might deflect from the central concerns of the individual poems, but the process is not without its problems. Intense personal experience, and its related emotions and associations, are largely unique to the individual, and may become hermetic when expressed in forms and language that have repudiated the familiar rhetorical devices which others may need in order to recognize them. Thus Trilce sometimes exemplifies problems of circularity: Vallejo's intentions cannot be grasped without an understanding also of his syntactic and linguistic manipulations, which in turn can be comprehended only in the context of general meaning. It is nevertheless this kind of experience - feelings such as love, fear, guilt, sorrow, pity, anger, and abandonment, the raw material of the human psyche that Vallejo seeks to capture in words on the page. In this respect, his view of what poetry was, and should aim to achieve, did not alter as he grew older. It is simply that in Poemas humanos we can trace the painful and gradual process by which he learned to universalize the intense emotion that, in Trilce, remains highly personal in its tone and points of reference. This deeply held conviction made exhausting demands of Vallejo as an artist, and also lay beneath his repeated criticism of avant-garde poetry in Europe and Latin America, whose intellectualism, experi- mentation, gratuitous shock-tactics, and extravagant mockery concealed what was for Vallejo fundamental, irreplaceable, and truthful about poetry: namely, genuine feeling. The formal differences between Trilce and Los heraldos negros open the way for major divergences of tone and approach, but only a dozen or so poems from the former deal with themes that are not already present in the latter. Form apart, much of what distinguishes the treatment of these recurring themes may lie in the events of Vallejo's personal life between 1919 and 192 . The pain and suffering endemic to the human condition that is examined in Los heraldos negros is rhetorical and intuited rather than lived. The experience behind Trilce, however, is of a different order, one in which emotions have deepened and intensified, causing the poet to retreat inwards, seeking inspiration among memories of his immediate and childhood past rather than from new sensations brought by contact with the bustle and activity of 4 It is significant, as Neale Silva points out, that there are marked semantic and neologistic affinities between Trilce and the stories and experimental prose pieces, Escalas melografiadas, that Vallejo was writing at about the same time (p. I6). His experiments with prose poems continued during his Paris years up to 1928-29. 605</page><page sequence="4">606 Three Principal Themes in 'Trilce' the outside world. Indeed, an important part of Trilce is the recorded conflict between the recollected state of childhood and the painful adult present. Trilce can, therefore, be read as the confession of a mind under strain, which alternately approaches poles of unwilling resignation on the one hand and pain and despair upon the other, to which the poet cannot be reconciled. The death of Vallejo's mother, the breakdown of his love affair with the young woman referred to in the poems as Otilia, the professional embarrassment this caused, loss of employ- ment, near destitution, and a four-month term of imprisonment remanded on charges (that were never substantiated) of involvement in a political riot, all contribute to the mood of the book. Yet even in the poems which do make direct and indirect reference to his spell in gaol, the outside world of social and political unrest in which Vallejo and his friends found themselves barely impinges upon his introversions.5 What, then, are the precise themes to which Vallejo returns in Trilce, and how are they developed along the road that leads from Los heraldos negros? Broadly speaking, they can be categorized as a sense of abandonment and alienation which is closely linked with the poet's attitude to love, and an increasingly rationalized, philosophi- cal conviction that man is simply a form of animal life and subject to the natural laws which govern a random, absurd universe. Vallejo finds love to be an ambivalent emotion, in which the carnal and the spiritual, the parental and the sexual, and the innocent love of children are in constant and contradictory juxtaposition. The feeling of alienation is exacerbated by his failure to find the kind of adult love which could replace the love he received in childhood from his mother and family, and from which, despite his fears and uncertainties, he derived emotional security and happiness. This alienation also gives rise to the most profound feelings of self-doubt; the fear that he has nothing to give or to communicate to his fellow men. The poet suffers his personal burden of pain as a result, but it is as yet perceived indistinctly, against an indefinable background of suffering that is universal, unjust, and visited by a capricious fate. Yet he is also overcome at times with presentiments of guilt, as if he is somehow to blame for his own predicament and that of others, and must ransack his memory for those culpable moments when he did or thought things which earned him what he termed in Los heraldos negros 'el odio de dios'. Throughout Trilce, Vallejo's recollections of his childhood and events connected with it persist very strongly. But just as in Trilce in ('Las personas mayores I 2a que hora volveran?') he re-creates in the language of a child his early fear of being left alone in the dark, so the final lines refer also to the darkness of adult life, its emptiness and isolation, which gives the childish tone a sombre and premonitory echo: Aguedita, Nativa, Miguel? Llamo, busco al tanteo en la oscuridad, No me vayan a ver dejado solo Y el unico recluso sea yo. The overall impression given is that Vallejo looked upon his early years not necessarily as a 'happy' time, but certainly as one in which he experienced security, 5 See Asturrizaga. In this biography ofVallejo's early years, the author shows a close knowledge of this love affair and the reasons for its breakdown. He conceals Otilia's full name, however, in the interests of her family.</page><page sequence="5">R. K. BRITTON love, and protection, where the sudden, irrational fears and imaginings of the child could be calmed by the family's presence. His mother's death in I918 was clearly a blow and a destabilizing influence, as well as a profound personal sorrow. The loss of this loving support is directly stated in Trilce XLVII, which begins 'Ciliado arrecife donde nacf'.6 In it Vallejo builds a dream-like fantasy in which he glimpses through his lashes drowsy images of his childhood. Now he feels as if he were being born, with his eyes half open for the first time, and is reluctant to exchange the safety of the womb for the sorrow of the world. The clutching hands of the newly born infant close only upon what is insubstantial. Even at birth the child is destined for the isolation and loneliness symbolized by the figure I.7 Y las manitas que abarquillan asiendose de algo flotante, a no querer quedarse Y siendo ya la i. Roughly a third of the Trilce poems concern either memories of his mother's love and care or recollections of the broken affair with Otilia, a clear indication of the extent to which Vallejo was emotionally dependent upon the women in his life. In the context of the poems, both the mother and the beloved take on a symbolic as well as a human dimension, becoming associated with the two kinds of love that seem to reflect the conflict he experienced between the ideal and the actual, and which he recorded in various poems of Los heraldos negros. The mother-figure is made to represent selfless love, care, emotional strength, and security. Reference to her is often linked to the preparation and giving of food in the form of the family meal, and thus she provides spiritual support in the same way that she gives physical sustenance. The futility of bodily nourishment, when the hunger of the soul is left unassuaged now that his mother is dead, is the theme of Trilce xxvIm, which begins: He almorzado solo ahora, y no he tenido madre, ni siplica, ni sirvete, ni agua.... Everything about the meal recalls the fact of his mother's death and emphasizes his own loss: El yantar de estas mesas asi, en que se prueba amor ajeno en vez del propio amor, torna tierra el bocado que no brinda la MADRE, hace golpe la dura deglusi6n; el dulce, hiel; aceite funereo, el cafe. Vallejo's attitude to his childhood is, to a large extent, that of an exile looking back upon a lost paradise of which he has been cheated by time. The world places barriers between adults who as children played happily together without reserve. This process of estrangement - another facet of alienation - is described in Trilce xi and LI. But Vallejo does not deceive himself about his childhood or the nature of children. Vallejo the child had in him the flaws - seeds of selfishness and cruelty- that are in him as an adult. This is illustrated in Trilce LI, in which he relives an 6 See Neale Silva, pp. 450-57. The symbolism in Trilce of rocks, islands, and reefs as places of haven from the confusion and chaos of the sea (human life) is here pointed out. 7 See Neale Silva, pp. 507-29. Chapter 9 of this study is devoted to Vallejo's use of numerology, and the extent to which this reflects a resurgence of interest in Pythagoreanism at that time. He does not, however, include this poem among those he examines in this connexion. His use of numbers as symbols is idiosyncratic. He appears to use the number i with different symbolic meanings in different contexts. 607</page><page sequence="6">608 Three Principal Themes in 'Trilce' episode when, as a small boy, he quarrelled with a little girl he used to play with. The language of children squabbling and accusing is captured with authenticity and immediacy, and woven into the fabric of the poem: Mentira. Si lo hacia de engafios, y nada mas. Ya esta. De otro modo tambien tu vas a ver cuanto va a dolerme el haber sido asi. Mentira. Calla. Y esta bien como otras veces tu me haces esto mismo por eso y tambien he sido asi. Even in childhood, real feelings can be concealed beneath pride. In Trilce LVIII, which relates a series of impressions that come to him in his cell during his imprisonment in 192I, he remembers his lack of awareness as a child of the suffering of others, which led him to laugh at his mother's prayers for the 'caminantes, encarcelados, enfermos y pobres'. With almost identical symbolism, Vallejo con- cludes Trilce xxIII by saying that though death has claimed her body, the love she gave to her children will remain alive as an inexhaustible source of strength within them and on which they can call: Tal tierra oira en tu silenciar, como nos van cobrando todos el alquiler del mundo donde nos dejas y el valor de aquel pan inacabable. Vallejo's attitude to the beloved as represented by Otilia is more complex and ambivalent. As an object of powerful sexual attraction she is depicted very much as a physical reality, but is nevertheless the means by which the poet also seeks to achieve a union of spirit and flesh between two people, for this alone is capable of giving respite from suffering through the creation of joy and harmony. The measure of these feelings for Otilia is clearly apparent in the overt eroticism of Poems ix and LXXI, where the poet's thoughts and feelings surrounding the sexual act are recounted. Yet in numerous other poems his lack of emotional certainty is equally evident. His basic insecurity, no doubt exacerbated by his mother's death, leads him, in these instances, to attribute the maternal role now to Otilia. In Trilce vi he employs an extended metaphor - that of washing his clothes - to describe the way in which he relies on Otilia to mend his soiled and damaged spirit after its contact with the suffering and injustices of life. She becomes 'mi aquella lavandera del alma' who restores to cleanliness the poet's figurative garments: [...] en sus venas otolinas, en el chorro de su coraz6n, y hoy no he de preguntarme si yo dejaba el traje turbio de injusticia. The same process is at work in Trilce xxxv, where Vallejo describes his joy at meeting Otilia for the mid-day meal and her spontaneous acts of attention in serving him at the table and caring for his physical welfare. These actions are inextricably linked with allusions to her sexuality as Vallejo enumerates the [...] encantos de la mesa que aquella nuibil campania borda con sus propias baterias germinales [...]</page><page sequence="7">R. K. BRITTON y con las diez varillas magicas de sus dedos pancreaticos. It is typical of the eclecticism of Vallejo's poetic resources that images such as the 'diez varillas magicas | de sus dedos' should be supported by the anatomical specificity of words like 'nubil' and 'pancreaticos'. Yet, significantly, Otilia also occupies the role of the maternal dispenser of food and, perhaps more significantly still, is described as sewing a button on the poet's shirt in the following terms: [...] joh aguja de mis dias desgarrados! se sienta a la orilla de una costura, a coserme el costado a su costado, a pegar el bot6n de esa camisa. James Higgins has been quick to point out the 'umbilical' associations of this image by which the poet describes the closeness of his link with Otilia.8 Not surprisingly, perhaps, at times of particular stress (such those reflected in Trilce xxxIII) mother and beloved become indistinguishable bulwarks against the threats posed by life, especially when the two women are conspicuous by their absence: O sin madre, sin amada, sin porfia de agacharme a aguitar al fondo, a puro pulso, esta noche asi [...] In the enigmatic Trilce LXV these two women are fused in the poet's imagination into a single female figure, half symbol and half memory. But despite his efforts, Vallejo cannot share the sustenance offered by the 'tarde cocinera' of the poem, she denying herself food while he is unable to accept it. Though food is a familiar symbol in his poetry, the precise significance the poet attributes to the figure of the 'cocinera' is less straightforward. Possibly he saw this anthropomorphism as representing life, abundant with resources, which man cannot grasp. This would at least explain the reference to the serving of food at a table where the female figure has already eaten. In Trilce LXV Vallejo shows that he is able to come to terms with his mother's death and to find consolation and strength in her memory. It begins: Madre, voy maiiana a Santiago, a mojarme en tu bendici6n y en tu llanto. In his determination to make the long and difficultjourney to Santiago de Chuco, his native village, the poet also makes a great effort to repudiate his own egoism and weakness (he had been incapable of returning home from Lima at the time of her funeral): Estoy cribando mis carinos mas puros [...] Estoy plasmando tu f6rmula de amor para todos los huecos de este suelo. In the ruins of his affair with Otilia, however, he could find nothing to afford him either comfort or personal insight. He regards this emotional debacle as one more proof of the absurdity and injustice of existence that eludes his comprehension. He 8 See James Higgins's introductory essay to Cesar Vallejo: An Anthology of his Poetry (Oxford: Pergamon Press, 1970), p. 62. 21 609</page><page sequence="8">6io Three Principal Themes in 'Trilce' can only suppose that others, envious of the happiness that he and Otilia shared, poisoned the relationship by their disapproval: Por esto nos separaran por eso y para que ya no hagamos mal [...] por habernos juntado mucho en la vida reclusos para siempre nos iran a encerrar. (Trilce LXXIV) Certainly Vallejo was under pressure to marry Otilia, especially since her brother-in-law was deputy principal of the school where Vallejo was becoming increasingly unreliable as director. Other poems, notably Trilce xv and LXII, sadly recall memories and traces of Otilia, lamenting the fact that she has gone. Compared with the ideas and emotions expressed in Los heraldos negros on the subject of love, those found in Trilce differ only to the extent that they have become more intense and personal as a result of the poet's experience, for the dichotomy and ambivalence in Vallejo's mind between the spiritual ideal and the physical reality of love is carried over from his first book and remains unresolved in the second. By contrast, his sense of alienation shows a distinct change of emphasis from one work to the other. Despite the degree of self-absorption which often marks Trilce, he had nevertheless begun to distil from personal feelings the essence of more abstract, philosophical ideas for which he tries to create representative symbols that are artistically valid. Possibly the most interesting example of this tendency is to be found in the way that the childlike fear of abandonment becomes a more objective sense of personal alienation, together with the awareness that others may also be incapable of communicating with, or relating to, their fellow beings, thus lacking contact and continuity with the universe as a whole. Life is then equated with a state of exile brought about by the passing of time: time which obliges the foetus to leave the womb, time which obliges the adult to leave the state of childhood. From God, whom Vallejo displaces still further in Trilce, no help is to be had. Only, occasionally, a little hope. He is no longer castigated by a railing and angry poet, as in Los heraldos negros, for being capricious or inefficient. His role is as absurd as that of man in a universe that has taken him over. Yet despite moments of desolate certainty - and here Vallejo's undoubted humanity is revealed - he remains a victim of doubts, searchings, and vacillations. Vallejo never speaks from a viewpoint that is either consistently philosophical or philosophically consistent. Indeed, there are occasions when his ironic trivialization of large questions seems to alleviate his pessimistic vision, as when, in Trilce xxxI, he describes hope as being contained in the buds of a cotton bush. Man waits, confused and suppliant, while God plucks the buds and scatters the seed of hope like a minimal dose of medicine to the ailing human race: Y Dios, sobresaltado, nos oprime el pulso, grave, mudo, y como padre a su pequefio, apenas, pero apenas, entreabre los sangrientos algodones y entre sus dedos toma la esperanza. There is an indulgent humour here in the portrayal of God as something between a harassed parent and a well-meaning but ineffective family physician.</page><page sequence="9">R. K. BRITTON Similarly, Vallejo also preserves the occasional morsel of hope within himself. Despite the evidence of his own experience, he is able on one occasion to assert that the key to understanding what appears to be a meaningless existence eludes man because his beliefs and limitations prevent him from grasping it: [...] asoman y exploran en balde, donde ambas manos ocultan el otro puente que les nace entre veras y liturgicas bromas. (Trilce LIII)9 At other times, he accepts the absurdity of life as a truth in itself, as in Trilce LxxII: 'Absurdo, solo tu eres puro.' These moments, however, afford little relief, and again and again his mind is assailed by the thought of his own aimless, isolated existence, where to seek for any underlying design or truth is like striking matches in the dark (Trilce xxxix). In such moods, he sees life as a meaningless routine from which he cannot escape even by finding himself as an artist: [...] Yo me busco en mi propio designio que debi6 ser obra mia, en vano; nada alcanz6 a ser libre. (Trilce LvII) He is instead reduced to blind fumblings which gain him a living of a sort (Trilce LvI): Todos los dias amanezco a ciegas a trabajar para vivir [...] At this point of spiritual nadir, the oracles that disclosed the mysteries of life have fallen silent, themselves bereft of meaning and 'libres de base y de coronacion'. Human experiences are tears that are lost watering a desert, and despite parental love children grow up into men and women who can inherit only sorrow. This is a fundamental injustice which never ceases to anger Vallejo, and his protest reaches a climax in Trilce Lx. Here he describes his life of stultifying isolation and inactivity, where the passing of time is a constant threat,10 as if he is living through an unending, wet Sunday afternoon. In the poem he longs for the 9 The idea that life is a prison, and the universe is bound by immutable physical laws which shackle man and limit his understanding, is an important and recurring theme in Trilce. It is, perhaps, best illustrated in Trilce LIII, in which the poet's 'claustrophobia of spirit' is clearly articulated: [...] Asoman las coronas a oir pero sin traspasar los eternos trescientos sesenta grados [...] In Poem LIX, Vallejo even describes love as one of the limiting forces in this metaphysical prison that is human existence ('La esfera terrestre del amor'); Trilce LVIII and xvIIi, both related to his experience in gaol, return to the same idea but from a different point of departure. 10 Vallejo often sees the passing cycle of days and months as analogous to the stages of his own life. For example, in Trilce xxI, he writes: Quien le viera, diciembre con sus 31 pieles rotas el pobre diablo [...] The poem describes the poet's experiences during the year which had seen his love for Otilia growing, but ended with that love in ruins and Vallejo reduced to emotional (and actual) penury. He himself is the ragged December. Similar ideas equating stages in life and love with spring and summer, and loss and deprivation with the later parts of the year, are also to be found in poems such as 'Setiembre', 'Verano', 'Yeso', and 'Los anillos fatigados' of Los heraldos negros. 6I I</page><page sequence="10">6I2 Three Principal Themes in 'Trilce' nothingness of the Sunday (death) that follows the intolerable Saturday that represents life: i[...] este sabado de harapos, esta horrible sutura del placer que nos engendra sin querer, y el placer que nos DestieRRa! Again, life is seen as a place of exile where even love is inhuman, since the pleasure of procreation condemns another new being to eventual suffering and loneliness. In these blacker moments, Vallejo is not at his most coherent, though they are often among his most moving lines. In his more tranquil and lucid moods, however, he is able to come to terms with his vision of human existence and even manages, as in Trilce LIV, a gesture of defiance. Certainly, despite his ambivalence and doubts, it is more usual for him to see in love a physical and spiritual union between men and women that can erect a positive defence for the vulnerable individual against the destructiveness of isolation and suffering.l" In three poems in particular Vallejo establishes for himself a vantage-point that affords him a slightly greater degree of detachment in which to develop the unorthodoxy of his vision. In Trilce xxxVI this takes on a multivalency which has given rise to a number of differing readings which, nevertheless, pursue a common general direction.12 The starting-point is the human species' biological dependence upon the male/female duality by means of which, no matter how hard it is striven 11 This is implied in poems describing physical love (that is, Trilce ix and LxxI) and is stated in terms of numerical symbols in Trilce v: Los novios sean novios en eternidad. Pues no deis i, que resonara al infinito. Y no deis o, que callarin tanto hasta despertar y poner de pie al I. Here Vallejo uses o and I to symbolize emptiness and the isolation of the individual. The figure 2 (or I plus i), as represented by 'los novios', is a unified symbol which is strong and balanced. This differs entirely from Pythagorean numerology which sees I as the complete entity: stable and seeking to unify and multiply. 12 See Franco, pp. 86-92; Franco's interpretation is built upon by Christiane von Buelow in 'Vallejo's Venus de Milo and the Ruins of Language', PMLA, 04 (1989), 41-51. This perceptive and interesting article puts forward the view that in Trilce xxxvi Vallejo uses the Venus de Milo to subvert the Romantic idea that art can, by creating an aesthetic object, invoke a beauty and harmonious perfection that defies time. Her analysis of the linguistic means by which Vallejo destroys the aesthetic symbol, a process to which she applies the term 'critical decomposition', is an important pointer to understanding the technicalities of Vallejo's avant-gardism. While recognizing, with reference to the opening 'Pugnamos ensartarnos por un ojo de aguja', that the metaphysical analogue which replaces the original biblical reference is 'the individual's sexual self-transcendence' von Buelow rightly maintains that to assume that this substitution supplies the meaning to the poem is to 'truncate and unify a signification process marked by purposeful elision' (p. 44). I suspect that the reading suggested by Stephen Hart in Religidn, politicay ciencia en la obra de Cesar Vallejo, Colecci6n Tamesis, Serie A: Monografias, 133 (London: Tamesis, 1987), p. 77-82, is just such an example of this. My reading of the poem, however, sees two parallel threads being pushed through the needle's eye. Thus, while I agree with von Buelow's point about truncation and the imposition of a unity where the poet did not intend it, I also feel that she may have over-compensated by giving insufficient weight to Vallejo's second implication: namely, that the biological determinism of the life process (including human sexuality and its necessity to continue the species) - whose unavoidable, circular process of birth, decay, and death vitiates all attempts at the imposition of harmony and unity upon life - constitutes the traditional artistic and aesthetic ideal.</page><page sequence="11">R. K. BRITTON for, union is possible only on terms that are far from the ideal. Woman sustains and reproduces man (echoes of Los heraldos negros) precisely in those ways which most reduce his own creativity: Pugnamos ensartarnos por un ojo de aguja enfrentados a las ganadas. Amoniacase casi el cuarto angulo del circulo. iHembra se contin6a el macho, a raiz de sus probables senos, y precisamente a raiz de cuanto no florece! Untypically, the poet has here reached one of the rarer moments in which he takes cognizance of the true nature of sexual and biological rivalry, and concludes that for mankind only the imperfection which constitutes life in general is possible. This he symbolizes by turning on its head the significance of the Venus de Milo (for Dario it represented timeless perfection possible only through art) whose vitality links her indissolubly with the teeming life around her, so that her truncated arms are seeking to 'encodarse' or sprout elbows. There follows the logical argument to such a proposition. Harmony, beauty, and perfection in art are no more possible in the imperfection of the living world than are ideal human relationships. Symmetry and order are a delusion, misplaced and misconceived petrifacts of the spirit that must be rejected: Rehusad, y vosotros, a posar las plantas en la seguridad dupla de la Armonia. Rehusad la simetria a buen seguro [...] iCeded al nuevo impar potente de orfandad! Not even sexual ecstasy can be permitted to delude us into thinking that the 'salto por el ojo de aguja' is possible, and humanity mustjettison its accumulated aesthetic and other illusions and embrace its disinheritance. Indeed, philosophically speak- ing, the poet can no longer feel certain that anything has its allotted place in any recognizable scheme of things. Even his finger may not be his, or if it is then it might be misplaced. The absurdity of life can be appreciated only through the acceptance of inchoate disorder and suffering symbolized by 'jueves' (Thursday): Y no hay como salir de el, sino haciendo la cuenta de que hoy es jueves. Poems xxxvIII and XLV each take a different aspect of the themes discussed in xxxvi and develop them in a new direction. In Trilce xxxviii Vallejo returns to the point he had reached at the end of the previous poem - the necessity of questioning all apparent order in a disordered world - and with this as a fresh point of departure, finishes up almost reversing his own logic. In this difficult poem, which can be interpreted in a number of ways, a glass is depicted as waiting to be swallowed as food. In vain it anticipates the coming of the 'boca venidera sin dientes' which will swallow it caressingly.Just as the glass awaits the impossible opportunity to fulfil itself (impossible because the longed-for mouth will be 'sin dientes' but not 'desdentada') so will the poet wait for his unrealizable moment to give himself true purpose. The drastic change needed in the poet's perceptions which this poem illustrates, and which would alter his understanding of the material world, might, it seems, provide him with a passage through the needle's eye which obstructed him in 613</page><page sequence="12">Three Principal Themes in 'Trilce' Trilce xxxvI, but the likelihood of it happening is unthinkable, as is the magnitude of the change.13 In Trilce XLV Vallejo's position seems to have reverted even more markedly towards that which he summed up in Trilce xxxvI, except that the defiantly nihilistic posture of the latter has been abandoned. As in Trilce i, the sea in this poem symbolizes the restless, chaotic life-force from which the poet seeks to detach himself. Yet he breathes in the sea air and its smell to show his deliberate acceptance of life, just as he accepts the symbolic imperfection and vitality of the Venus de Milo, with the words: [...] asi dieramos las narices en el absurdo, nos cubriremos con el oro de no tener nada. This final acceptance should be an important moment of realization. The absurdity, lack of order, and arbitrariness of human existence is recognized: only then can man set out to dominate the unknown darkness: Y empollaremos el ala aun no nacida de la noche, hermana de esta ala huerfana del dia. These three poems, in company with a number of others, illustrate the meta- physical and philosophical issues which preoccupied Vallejo in his writing of Trilce. As a set of ideas they are eclectic, inconsistent, and aphoristic, and bear testimony to Vallejo's restless spiritual search and his intellectual and emotional honesty rather than to any ability on his part to achieve a synthesis leading to a permanent position. The continuity of the collection lies in the genuineness of the poet's feelings, his instinctive response to his personal circumstances, whereas his consciously pursued ideas are as contradictory as his changing moods. Trilce can, therefore, be seen as a book which is a breakthrough in poetic technique, but which marks a crisis point in the life of the poet, forcing him into an intensely introverted discourse which focuses upon his personal suffering as a paradigm of the suffering which is the ineluctable legacy of humanity. Little of what followed from his years of exile in Paris would surpass it in inventiveness and originality of expression. The pessimism, sense of alienation and of love denied, guilt at his own failure to give it, the awareness of existence in a disordered universe, all first explored in Los heraldos negros, become in Trilce a torrent whose articulation is no longer inhibited by the conventional forms Vallejo still felt obliged to use in his first book. It is, however, a work whose complexities of thought, feeling, and language 13 Neale Silva analyses this poem and suggests that it is the only one in Trilce that contains the kind of political content which was later to become apparent in Poemas humanos. This view is based on his interpretation of the last four lines and the significance of the word 'izquierdas' (pp. 51-65). Vallejo's contacts with contemporaries in Peru who, like Haya de la Torre and Mariategui, were involved in campaigns for political and economic reform from the left are also cited to support this reading of the lines: Este cristal ha pasado de animal, y marchase ahora a formar las izquierdas, los nuevos Menos. Dejenlo solo no mas. Neale Silva does not tackle the meaning of'Menos', nor does he appear to allow for the reference to be double-edged: namely, that social or political reform from the left was no more of a likelihood than the transformation of the glass from its mineral state to an animal one. 6I4</page><page sequence="13">R.
