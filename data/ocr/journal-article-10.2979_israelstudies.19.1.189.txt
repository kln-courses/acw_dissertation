<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Hagar Lahav Postsecular Jewish Theology:  Reading Gordon And Buber ABSTRACT Considerable scholarly research has been conducted in an attempt to deter- mine whether A. D. Gordon and Martin Buber are to be categorized as  religious or secular philosophers. This study seeks to characterize them as  postsecular theologians who propound a hybrid theology, rejecting tradi- tional religion on the one hand and atheism on the other. Opening with  presentation of the postsecular approach that developed in the social sci- ences in recent years, with emphasis on secular spaces in Israel, this inter- disciplinary study proceeds to a postsecular reading of Buber’s and Gordon’s  works, proposing that such a reading reveals the possible relevancy of their  works to present postsecular discourses in Israel. INTRODUCTION Over the past few years, a critical discussion about Jewish  secularism in Israel has developed, both within and outside the academic  world. This study aims at contributing to this discourse by examining  the issue from a postsecular perspective and (re)introducing the work of  two of Israel’s most outstanding twentieth-century philosophers—Aharon  David Gordon and Martin Mordechai Buber—as relevant to the present  discussion. To achieve its aims, the study first introduces the postsecular perspec- tive that developed over the past 20 years in the social sciences, center- ing on faith-oriented and spiritual aspects of contemporary secular space.  Concentrating on Jewish spheres in Israel, the postsecular analysis identifies  a social group, estimated to include 15–25% of Jewish Israelis, that I call  189 </page> <page sequence="2"> 190 • israel studies, volume 19 number 1 secular-believers. Its members define themselves as secular, but also mani- fest spiritual and faith-oriented sentiments. They reject (de facto if not de  jure) both traditional religion and atheistic secularism and accord faith a  significant place in their lives. Shifting from sociology to theology, the study presents the concept of  postsecular theology as a school of thought available to secular-believers, as  it manifests secular-religious hybridity. Within this framework, I proceed to read Buber and Gordon as post- secular theologians, concentrating on three theological categories that are  particularly important in the postsecular theological context: their attitude  towards the concept of God, their differentiation between “religion” and  “religious sentiment”, and their theological methodology. Based on this  reading, the conclusion discusses the relevance of Buber’s and Gordon’s  theologies, written decades ago, to the present discourse. POSTSECULARISM IN CONTEMPORARY ISRAEL The postsecular perspective that developed over the past 20 years in the  social sciences centers on faith-oriented and spiritual aspects of contem- porary secular space.1 Generally speaking, a postsecular outlook challenges  the dichotomous distinction between religiosity and secularism and iden- tification of the latter with an atheistic belief in the absence of God from  the universe. The prefix “post-” does not express any chronological order  (i.e., it does not imply that postsecular manifestations displaced secular  thinking that in turn had displaced religious beliefs). According to this  perspective, just as religion and secularism coexisted for centuries, with  intense mutual influence on one another, the postsecular conception coex- ists alongside them.2 Rather, the prefix implies that the perspective’s under- standing of religiosity-secularism relations arose in critical response to the  dominant understanding promulgated by secularism that is often called  the secularization thesis. While the secularization thesis thrived primarily in the white Prot- estant West, it is often presented as universal.3 It offers a narrative based  on dichotomous differentiation between secularism and religiosity that  is hierarchically connected to other polar concepts, such as modernity  (secularism=modernity, religiosity=pre-modernity), reason, universalism,  enlightenment, progress, social-structural separation (separating religion  and state), privatization (secularism is situated in the public sphere and  religiosity in the private sphere), immanency (secularism is considered  </page> <page sequence="3"> Postsecular Jewish Theology: Reading Gordon And Buber  • 191 immanent, belonging to “this world”, while religion deals with the tran- scendent), freedom, the epistemic supremacy of science, the philosophical  centrality of human beings rather than God (anthropocentricity vs. theo- centricity) and the like. Such conceptualization has normative meaning  that supplements its sociological-historical interpretation. As such, the  secularization thesis not only proposes a possible historical and sociological  narrative ( put forth as the only possible narrative), but also bears ethical  claims regarding the moral advantage of secularism.4 In Israel, studies revealed the dominance of the secularization thesis’s  conceptualizations in political, cultural, and academic discourse.5 Most  of this discourse (except for certain marginal conceptions, to be detailed  below) tends to present a picture of reality that contrasts secular Jews with  religious (and sometimes ultra-Orthodox) ones. It relates to secularism  as the “natural” and “normative” default choice (and thus addresses the  sociology of religion but not the sociology of secularism, for example).6  Furthermore, it accords enlightened values to secularism, such as freedom,  personal autonomy, and tolerance. The postsecular perspective challenges both the analytical and nor- mative components of the secularization thesis. It emphasizes the need to  redefine the place of religion and secularism under contemporary post- enlightenment auspices.7 The descriptive theoretical claims of this perspec- tive will be presented according to three basic propositions, as examined  in detail below. Hybridity of tHe religious and tHe secular Postsecular scholars do not consider religion and secularism to be diamet- ric opposites, but rather social components that influence one another  in a multidimensional manner and create an abundance of hybrid, ever- evolving spaces.8 The hybridity claim is based on two key types of analysis:  sociological and epistemological. Sociological research topics include the “return” of religion to public  life in various nation states, the development of new religious movements,  yearnings for spirituality,9 and the function of religious faiths and practices  in the secular sphere. In Israel, where religion was never privatized and  separated from the state, research has been devoted to the “religionization”  of the seemingly secular, “normative” Israeli society,10 as well as to tradi- tionalist Jews11 as a social group that manifests a hybrid religion-secularism  relationship. Other studies deal with Israeli Jews active in new religious  movements and in the New Age sphere,12 while still others devote attention  to secular Jews studying Judaism, learning communities, pluralistic batei  </page> <page sequence="4"> 192 • israel studies, volume 19 number 1 midrash, secular Jewish houses of prayer, and the like.13 All these studies  point to the existence of hybrid religiosity-secularism spaces in the Israeli  polity and culture. The claim that a hybrid relationship obtains between religion and  secularism is also grounded in epistemological analysis, suggesting that ( pri- marily Christian) theological conceptions are at the foundation of Western  secular thinking. This approach underscores the religious source of basic  liberal concepts (such as sovereign, emergency situation, protection and  abandonment, charisma, and the invisible hand), applying them to reveal  the basic religious assumptions behind secular thinking in the West.14 Bor- rowing a metaphor from Walter Benjamin, we may state that such studies  seek to uncover the theological dwarf (who need not be as ugly as Benjamin  perceived him) who is said to pull the strings of secular history.15 In the Israeli context, the study revealed the “religious layer in the  secular Israeli ethos”16 and the theological and messianic foundations at the  basis of ostensibly secular Zionism. These studies indicate that the Israeli  polity is replete with theological ideas about God and the sanctity of the  Land of Israel for the Jewish People.17 Particularity of tHe secular Awareness of the particularities of the secularization thesis lifts the mask  of universalism from “the secular”. Postsecular research suggests that mani- festations of secularism that are incongruent with the secularization thesis  appear in non-Western spaces.18 Consequently, various researchers refer to  different secularisms (as they do to different religiosities),19 thereby acknowl- edging the numerous faces of secularism, promoting claims regarding its  unique relationship with religion and declaring that the concept of secular- ism cannot be imported easily from culture to culture but rather requires  special sensitivity to the particularistics of the secularism examined. In the Israeli context, this means we must not assume that research  knowledge regarding Western secularism and its Christian foundations  can be applied simply and comprehensively in an attempt to understand  Jewish secularism in general and Israeli Jewish secularism in particular. The  Jewish religion differs in several substantive respects from Christianity and  is not only a religion but also a nationality, ethnicity, and culture that were  largely secularized within and by means of Zionism. Hence the secularism  that developed within and in response to Judaism is different from the  Western/Christian variety. From a sociological point of view, there is some discomfort with the  seemingly simple application of the concept of secularism to Israeli realities,  </page> <page sequence="5"> Postsecular Jewish Theology: Reading Gordon And Buber  • 193 in which Jewishness is dominant. For example, consider the relatively com- plex religiosity scale categories: secular (about 51% of the population), tra- ditional (30%), religious (10%), and Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) (9%).20 Fur- thermore, research indicates that secular Jews in Israel ostensibly manifest  incoherent behavior regarding two of the three key categories of research  on religion—belonging and behavior:21 Many do not belong to traditional  religious institutions but define themselves as belonging to the Jewish  polity; most observe at least some Jewish religious precepts, primarily those  concerned with the cycle of time and life (holidays, marriage, circumcision,  mourning, etc.), but the significance they accord such observance is usually  more cultural/ethnic than it is religious. The uniqueness of Jewish secularism in Israel originates not only in  its difference from Christian secularism but also in the special qualities of  Jewish culture and history. In Israel, Jewish identity is sovereign and above  all, normative. The Jewish identity of Jews in Israel, including secular Jews,  is preserved, protected, and strengthened by the state, its market and cul- ture.22 Use of the Hebrew language and calendar, the law, school curricula,  shops featuring traditional foods during holiday seasons, the change in  radio broadcasting tone on Friday afternoons,23 and the like render Jewish  identity self-evident in the same manner that Christmas trees and Easter  bunnies do for Christianity in Christian cultures. In such situations, the simple solution to problematic relations with  religion is not leaving Judaism (assimilation) but leaving religion. The  availability of this solution to Jews in Israel, enabling 50% of them to  maintain an identity that is both Jewish and secular, hints that secular  Jews in Israel can differentiate (even if in a vague and intuitive manner  rather than selectively and precisely) their Judaism and the Jewish religion,  releasing their grasp on the latter without adversely affecting the stabil- ity of their Jewish identity. No such option was possible during the two  millennia that preceded establishment of the State of Israel, nor does it  exist for Jews outside Israel, where they are a minority and not part of the  hegemonic norm.24 Jewish Israeli secularism is thus secularism of a special type that is not  identical with Christian secularism or with Jewish secularism outside the  physical and chronological boundaries of the State of Israel. It is a secular- ism that is deeply linked to its Jewishness and Israeliness. Israeli secular- ism does not deny its Judaism and its intense drawing on religious Jewish  sources, nor does it deny its rejection of traditional religion. Within this  framework, being secular does not make them less Jewish. </page> <page sequence="6"> 194 • israel studies, volume 19 number 1 differentiation between secularism and atHeism Another secularism thesis component that is subject to postsecular criticism  is the assumption (often not stated explicitly) that secularism is identical to  atheism (or at least agnosticism) and that there is no place in secularism for  faith in the existence of higher force(s) or dimension(s) in the universe.25  This principle is largely connected to the Christian conflation of religion  and religious faith. The postsecular perspective, however, rejects rationalistic  atheism and a sense of personal autonomy as sufficient replacements for  spiritual experiences,26 as well as the interpretation that perceives religious  experiences as a human illusion or manipulation by the authorities, as sug- gested by Freud and Marx, respectively. Instead, it sees in religious feelings a  belief in what William James call “a more,”27 authentic sentiments, essential  to the quality of life of many people, both secular and religious. Sociologically speaking, the longing for “a more” in secular spheres  manifests itself in a disparity between self-definition as secular and the  existence of faith-related religious or spiritual conceptions and feelings.28  This disparity reveals the existence of “spiritual but not religious” people,29  who maintain both a secular identity and spiritual conceptions and cannot  be defined as atheistic.30 In Israel, the disparity between secular self-definition and faith-related  outlooks is particularly outstanding: From 70% to 85% of Israeli Jews  declare that they believe in God or in some supreme force,31 including  about half of the 50% of Israelis who define themselves as secular.32 POSTSECULAR THEOLOGY Proceeding from sociology to theology, bearing in mind the insights of  the postsecular paradigm, we may now consider postsecular theology33 as a  school of thought that manifests secular-religious-spiritual hybridity and  is open for secular-believers. I propose that postsecular theology is a comprehensive term for think- ing that aims at discussing the relationship between the human and the  divine in a systematic and coherent manner, within a world view that adopts  substantial parts of secularism’s epistemological and ethical assumptions.34  This definition has two facets—deconstructionalist and reconstructionalist. From the deconstructionalist point of view, postsecular theologies  reject traditional religions, claiming that large parts of them are incompat- ible with contemporary knowledge and ethics, as they took shape within  </page> <page sequence="7"> Postsecular Jewish Theology: Reading Gordon And Buber  • 195 paradigms of social relations that are no longer acceptable for those who  adopted the enlightenment secular view.35 In this aspect, postsecular the- ology differs from traditional religions on the one hand and from trends  within the New Age sphere on the other, as the latter aims at replacing  monotheism with traditional pre-monotheistic or ex-monotheistic percep- tions (such as paganism, shamanism, Buddhism, Hinduism).36 At the same  time, postsecular theologies also reject rationalistic atheism, claiming that  spirituality, religious experiences, feelings of sanctity, and a sense of connec- tion with “a deep” or “a lofty” also take place in secular space and are fraught  with significance for individual quality of life and the moral development  of the collective. Thus, postsecular theologies claim that an atheistic forgo- ing of the divine for the purpose of liberating people from the religious  establishment constitutes “throwing the baby out with the bath water.” From a reconstructionalist standpoint, postsecular theologies propose  anthropocentric approaches in which people (and not God) constitute the  theology’s starting point and center. They seek to offer a human conception  based on relationality, including emotional and spiritual relations with the  beyond. Such theologies offer metaphors of the divine37 that are free of the  language of traditional religions. They often distinguish between “religion”  –which they reject on epistemological and moral grounds—and “religios- ity”, “spirituality”, “faith”, or “religious sentiments” that they accept as a  deep expression of human experience. Postsecular theology may include various non-monotheistic faith- based options without rejecting the basic assumption regarding the exis- tence of divinity of one type or another.38 The claim regarding divinity  may be presented as an ontological proposition (concerning the existence  of “a more” in the universe, i.e., a theistic approach) or a conceptual one  (a possible assumption that may be beneficial to human life, i.e., neither  theistic nor atheistic approach). The divinity, which may be presented as  immanent or transcendental, is understood as a source of spirituality in the  materialistic, consumer-oriented and oppressive world—and as a source of  ethics, in contrast to individualism, nihilism, and relativism. From a methodological point of view, postsecular theologies do not  consider sacred writings to be a source of authoritative information (nor,  at times, of particularly high quality), declaring human experience to be  its key methodology rather than hermeneutics (critical or otherwise) of  the religious canon. From a point of view of praxis, postsecular theology  does not ascribe authority to traditional institutions or religious practices,  nor does it seek to institute other obligatory texts or ceremonies in their  stead. As they perceive religiosity as originating in a personal experience,  </page> <page sequence="8"> 196 • israel studies, volume 19 number 1 they warn that any attempt at institutionalizing religiosity will render it a  frozen and oppressive “religion”. In this respect, postsecular theology, as I  define it, is very different from most old and new religions that focus on  ceremonial practices. READING BUBER AND GORDON   AS POSTSECULAR THEOLOGIANS Bearing in mind the postsecular sociological and theological analysis pre- sented thus far, I now turn to two of Israel’s most outstanding twentieth- century philosophers: Aharon David Gordon (Troyanov, 1856—Degania,  1922) and Martin Mordechai Buber (Vienna, 1878—Jerusalem, 1965). I  read them as ( Jewish Israeli) postsecular theologians, with two objectives:  I sought to use the postsecular perspective to shed new light on Gordon’s  and Buber’s theological works and to present their work as possible sources  of theological ideas for Jewish secular-believers in Israel.39 In this respect,  I accept Ron Margolin’s40 claims that discussion of the religious-secular  complexity of Buber and Gordon can contribute old/new layers of depth  to discourses in Israel. To read Gordon and Buber through a postsecular prism, I begin with  an overview of scholarly discussion concerning their positions in the osten- sible dichotomy of the religious and the secular. This complex discussion  demonstrates the postsecular hybridity in Gordon’s and Buber’s works.  I then proceed to an intensive discussion of three theological categories  that are particularly important in the postsecular context: theological atti- tude towards the concept of God, differentiation between “religion” and  “religious sentiment”, and theological methodology. I propose that this reading exposes Buber’s and Gordon’s postsecular  characteristics and their relevance to the present discourse of Jewish secular- believers in Israel. Furthermore, considering Gordon’s centrality in formulat- ing the Zionist conception during the Second Aliyah period41 and Buber’s  vast influence on Israeli secular Jews,42 one may claim that Gordon and Buber,  each in his own way, not only echo the theological component of ostensibly  secular Israeli culture in their works but also had a hand in shaping it. Both Gordon and Buber proposed a broad and intense philosophical  conception that includes epistemology, anthropology, and impressions of  God, as well as political and Zionist thinking. Buber was internationally  recognized and his writings were translated into dozens of languages, while  Gordon is familiar only within Israeli cultural space.43 </page> <page sequence="9"> Postsecular Jewish Theology: Reading Gordon And Buber  • 197 Several researchers have already examined Gordon’s influence on  Buber44 and the similarities between them regarding nationalist thought  and attitude towards the individual and the collective.45 Surprisingly, the  similarities and differences between Gordon and Buber concerning religion  and God have been accorded little attention in research. The scholars dis- cussed below, however, do appear to agree that Gordon and Buber should  be read as Jewish philosophers, not only by virtue of their ethnic origin  but also because their philosophies were conceived within the interpre- tive framework of Judaism. Thus, their works echo the Jewish identity of  secular-believers in Israel. There is lack of consensus as to whether Gordon and Buber are to be  categorized as religious or secular thinkers—a difficult decision indeed, as  Buber and Gordon express both religious and secular elements in their phi- losophy. The hybrid relations between religious and secular characteristics  in their philosophy led to differences of opinion among various scholars  regarding the place of the ostensible religious-secular dichotomy. The phi- losophers themselves did not help in resolving this dispute. Buber empha- sized that “in no way am I a believing Jew in the representative sense,”46  while Gordon defined himself as “not religious in the ordinary sense.”47 Scholars apparently concur that the two cannot be termed “religious”  in any conventional way (Orthodox Jews), but even those who underscore  the secular elements in their writings would not declare them to be “secu- lar”. Schweid, for example, compares Gordon to Spinoza and claims that  one should consider his philosophy to be “a religious philosophy that tends  towards spontaneous, anti-establishment religiosity.”48 Ramon, in turn,  perceives Gordon as a non-Orthodox religious philosopher who imparted  a kind of Jewish religious-ritualistic seal of approval to the physical labor  entailed by the secular national enterprise.49 Similarly, Margolin perceives  Gordon as a religious Israeli philosopher who is not bound by Halakha.50  By contrast, Katz, who defines secularism as rejection of traditional religion,  emphasizes the secular foundation of Gordon’s thinking and perceives his  philosophy as an attempt to secularize Judaism.51 A similar breadth of definitions apparently applies to Buber as well.  On the one hand, researchers such as Ross call Buber religious-Hasidic  or neo-Hasidic–religious.52 Sagi, too, considers Buber a religious philoso- pher because of the experience of wholeness presented in his philosophy  that appeals to the Absolute.53 Schweid claims that Buber’s work embod- ies prophetic zeal that is more severe than any kind of orthodoxy.54 By  contrast, Avnon considers Buber’s philosophy as a preliminary version  of New Age thought,55 while according to Horowitz, Franz Rosenzweig  </page> <page sequence="10"> 198 • israel studies, volume 19 number 1 chided Buber for being an “atheistic theologian” who created God in his  own image.56 Margolin—who defines secularism as a transition from the transcen- dent to the immanent, from theocentricity to anthropocentricity and from  perceived divine origin of sacred writings to human creation—suggests  that even though religion and religiosity are at its core, Buber’s philosophy  may be understood only in terms of its secular roots.57 Following Moore,58  Margolin proposes considering Buber’s philosophy as secular religiosity that  includes implicit secularism and religiosity. He thus seeks to resolve the  apparent paradox in which “[f ]rom a secular point of view, Buber’s insis- tence on the existence of a godly dimension in life makes him seem to be  a religious thinker, but from a religious point of view, many of his ideas  seem thoroughly secular.”59 The postsecular outlook sheds a new light on this discussion, posi- tioning Buber and Gordon at the core of the religious within the ( Jewish- Israeli) secular. I propose that this justifies reading Buber and Gordon as  postsecular theologians. This reading is applied to three central theological  categories discussed below. concePts of godHood Gordon maintained that the supreme objective of humanity is to experi- ence divinity, because “The human spirit, as deep as it may be, cannot be  calmed without religion.”60 A religious sentiment or attitude “originates  in human nature, at its point of intersection with worldly nature”61 in the  human soul’s aspiration “to live within the very life of the world . . . not  only its limited individuality but also the infinite generality of worldly life,  to live infinitely.”62 “A religious attitude is extant and eternal within the  human soul,” wrote Gordon, “wherever there is a deep soul and an attitude  towards life . . . when there is belief in God and even when there is no belief  in God.”63 The declaration of the existence of God is thus not essential in  itself because “atheism, too, is nothing but faith in God . . . whose only  advantage is its blindness.”64 Gordon’s conception of godhood is pantheistic,65 identifying it with  nature and addressing divine immanence at all levels of creation. He  employs various cognomens for godhood, including the Kabbalistic con- cepts of hidden wisdom (sekhel ne’elam)and the infinite (eynsof), as well as  Creation (bria) and the mother of all life (emkolchay). Its immanent manifes- tation is called nature or being (havayain Hebrew, derived from the Hebrew  name of God—YHWH). </page> <page sequence="11"> Postsecular Jewish Theology: Reading Gordon And Buber  • 199 For Gordon, contact with God is accomplished through Chavaya  (literally: experience), a word coined by him as a portmanteau of chayym  (life) and havaya (being, existence).66 Experiential knowledge is contrasted  with conscious-intellectual knowledge that forms a mechanical connection  with nature and has no idea or concept of God and His presence. People,  however, “live only to the extent that they live beyond the boundaries of  limited individuality, to the extent that they live or aspire to live the life of  all that lives and exists infinitely.”67 “It is absolutely clear that the key element is unknown. The unknown  may be called ‘God,’ but according to the meanings of these concepts, one  cannot say whether or not it exists at the boundaries of awareness,”68 wrote  Gordon. He thus presents faith in a benevolent, comprehensive, practical,  and subjective unity of divine natural processes that human beings attract to  themselves and their environment through their actions, first and foremost  through their work in nature. In this manner, they ascend, fill with vital- ity and coalesce with godhood.69 Atheistic narcissism, by contrast, leaves  human beings alone, in a deep spiritual void. The root of Gordon’s philosophy is thus theological, in the sense that  it examines the relationship between human beings and God. The existen- tial questions that Gordon raises and the answers to them are grounded in  the intuitive encounter between people and infinite nature, in a religious  experience that constitutes a powerful and intense feeling of unity with a  mighty, infinite force, a feeling that arouses infinite love for all creatures.70 The concepts of love and relationships are of particular importance  here because “there is nothing that is so powerful to unite human beings, to  plant within them pure love for one another” as religious sentiment.71 But  one who preaches for love within limited, individualistic life will ultimately  bring about hatred.72 Only through religious sentiment that engenders  a spiritual extension to “pure love” for humanity and nature, instead of  tortoise-like individualistic existence, may one thus maintain full, authen- tic contact among people. “The sense of God” is thus essential in human  relations, because without it, the “conduits of supreme abundance”—that  foster love of all creatures and the attribute of divine mercy—will shut  down.73 Researchers studying the philosophy of Martin Buber tend to divide  it into two successive periods, as Buber himself did.74 The first is the mysti- cal period, during which Buber emphasized the proximity of God to man  [sic],75 perceiving God as an imminent, pantheistic force developing within  the universe. The second, in turn, is the period to which this study refers,  </page> <page sequence="12"> 200 • israel studies, volume 19 number 1 the dialogic period that developed with the publication of Buber’s book I  and Thou in 1922. In contrast to the divine immanence conception, during the second  period Buber proposed a transcendental conception of God as the eternal  Thou, manifested in human life as the I-Thou dialogic relationship that is  to be differentiated from the instrumental I-It relationship. God is made  present at rare, special, and sanctified moments–that are firmly implanted  in everyday life—when one proceeds from I-It to IThou. “In every Thou  we address the eternal Thou.”76 “The lines extending from relationships  intersect in the eternal Thou”77 and “The Thou-sense of the man . . . aspires  toward the eternal Thou.”78 The eternal Thou is an interlocutor in all authentic dialogue with  another ( person or animal) and the full realization of the I-Thou relation- ship. The divine presence creates the entire being in which God, the universe and man unite; the human war over  God within the universe, the human encounter with God at the edge of the  universe, the redemption of the world at God’s decree at the hand of human  beings . . . the war, the encounter and the redemption are everyday life.79 “Whoever wishes to speak with human beings without speaking to  God will not achieve completeness in speaking,”80 claims Buber, as one then  lacks the ability to realize “his longing to establish a living communion with  the unconditioned . . . transporting it into the world of man.”81 On the  other hand, “to believe in God is audacious”,82 because maintaining and  revealing a relationship with another being demands faith in and openness  to the other.83 Thus, “whoever wishes to speak with God without speaking  with people is on the wrong path.”84 Like Gordon, Buber also suggests that the relationship with God is not  conscious but experiential. Horowitz cites lectures that Buber delivered in  1921, at which he said: “If belief in God means speaking about Him in the  third person, then I am not certain that I believe in God,” adding that later,  Buber also began to speak about God in the third person, in addition to the  second person—Thou—that he had emphasized initially.85 Buber calls God “the Creator” but by doing so does not make any cos- mological claim,86 especially regarding creation of the world as described in  the Torah. Rather, he asserts that “creation means saying ‘Thou’ to the world  on the part of God.”87 “The individual conforms with God by humanly  embracing his share of the world, just as the Creator divinely embraces all  Creation.”88 </page> <page sequence="13"> Postsecular Jewish Theology: Reading Gordon And Buber  • 201 God, then, is a personal God, who creates and who reveals himself,  who demands and gives, commands and guides. The relationship with God,  that is a “relationship of nearness that becomes known without interposi- tion to this person, as if he stands before it,”89 accords the human sub- ject full self-awareness and consolidates his unique essence. At the same  time, God Himself is beyond the conception of human beings: “God is  unfathomably raised and lifted above humankind.”90 Despite the clear difference between Gordon and Buber in their con- ceptualization of God (immanence vs. transcendental, personal vs. natural,  etc.), we may declare that both preserve a sense of sanctity regarding the  world, life, and their potential—a sense that human beings need according  to postsecular theology. At the same time, both deviate from the traditional  Jewish-religious conception of God, find godhood inextricably linked with  the relationship between one human being and other human beings and  with nature as a whole, and emphasize private experience as the way of  “knowing” God. All of these assumptions easily conform to the proposi- tions of secular-believers, while offering deep and elevating insights that are  lacking in the present discourse. religion and religious sentiment While the centrality of the theological component cannot be challenged,  several characteristics stand out in the philosophy of Buber and Gordon  that may be perceived as “secular”, including outright rejection of Jewish  religious law and its underlying conception of revelation—the most central  and significant pillars of Orthodox Judaism. Buber was described as “the  only Jewish philosopher who has no connection with any synagogue what- soever, be it ultra-Orthodox or otherwise. . . . He is more removed from the  organized religion of Israel than any other Jew who does not reject Judaism  but believes in it.”91 Gordon perceived blind submission to its interpreters  as a kind of idolatry.92 Buber and Gordon opposed not only the commandments of the Torah  and Sages, as codified in the Shulhan Arukh, but also the claim of a one- time, decisive, and obligatory revelation of “Torah from heaven” that con- stitutes their infrastructure. Gordon negates “faith in revelation of eternal  faiths and a living Torah from heaven, with all the commitment it demands  and implies,”93 the inner commitment that religion maintains towards  what it ostensibly received from a transcendental source, to which a claim  of divine truth is ascribed.94 Buber, in turn, stated that the mighty revela- tions on which religions are based essentially resemble the covert revelations  that take place everywhere, at all times.95 Revelation is thus not the giving  </page> <page sequence="14"> 202 • israel studies, volume 19 number 1 of the Torah but realization, here and now, of the encounter of the indi- vidual—and of the nation that comprises individuals—with God. This is  clearly a non-verbal revelation:96 “The eternal source of strength flows, the  eternal touch is waiting, the eternal voice sounds, nothing more.”97 Hence,  as Ratzabi wrote:98 One cannot accept the law without an encounter . . . Responses or laws that  are universal and eternal, i.e. pre-formulated, are unlikely. People must . . .  shape their responses from out of “the moment,” out of the living encounter  only. Consequently, there is no place for a Torah that is a kind of a priori law  and commandment. Buber and Gordon thus shift religious thinking that primarily ema- nates from God to the world, to an anthropocentric, enlightened direction,  the essence of which flows from the world, with humanity at its center,  towards God. Gordon offers us “a version of an inverted theory of abun- dance”, changing “the order from abundance flowing from the godhead to  abundance drawn from humanity”,99 in which religious creation is depen- dent on humanity’s attitude towards nature. Buber, in turn, in relating to  God, insists that man “had drawn Him not out of reality but out of his  own yearning, because he had not espied Him in heaven or earth but had  established Him as a Unity above his own duality.”100 The eternal Thou is  thus imprinted within human space. Buber and Gordon resolved the tension between the spirit of faith  reflected in their writings (and their self-definition as part of the Jewish  nation) and their rejection of establishment religious Judaism by differ- entiating between religion and religiosity (Buber)101 or religious sentiment  (Gordon). Gordon considered the essence of religiosity to be a religious attitude  or religious sentiment that, like all living sentiments, requires a living and self-renewing manifesta- tion. . . . Like any emotional attitude, it precedes its manifestations; it gives  form to its manifestations, constantly renewed along with life and the thought  and creation therein.102 By limiting the function of the conscious mind, Gordon ensured a  habitat for religious sentiment within the spheres of emotion and intuition.  His position thus challenged traditional basic assumptions by shifting the  religious center of gravity from Halakha and the principles of faith, which  </page> <page sequence="15"> Postsecular Jewish Theology: Reading Gordon And Buber  • 203 are within the realm of consciousness and obedience, to a human yearning  for religious renewal, nourished by the religious sentiment that beats within  the human heart—namely the authentic sense of human unity with the  universe and responsibility for all that thrives therein.103 Traditional reli- gion, by contrast, “acquired a fixed form for all generations, that is, a form  that is precisely the opposite of true religious consciousness . . . Religion  had to be something living, something that renews itself from the renewal  of life and renews life from the renewal of itself.”104 As religion has become fossilized, it is no longer an authentic experi- ence but lies within the realm of intellectual consciousness. It turned into  something methodical, nullifying religious sentiment in favor of hierarchi- cal idolatry, exempting its adherents from thinking, searching, and internal  struggles and alienating human beings from themselves.105 Like Gordon, Buber also perceived religion as a configuration mum- mified in established patterns of the principles of faith, rituals, laws, and  institutions that distance humanity from God.106 By contrast, religiosity,  the mother and source of religion, is the vital spontaneity of faith, the  renewed encounter between man and God: Religiosity is man’s sense of wonder and adoration, an ever anew becoming,  an ever anew articulation and formulation of his feeling that, transcending  his conditioned being yet bursting from its very core, there is something that  is unconditioned.107 In religiosity, as distinguished from religion, one stands before God as  an individual who forms relationships with Thou and not as an It that is  subject to the authority of a ritualistic Halakhic establishment. Gordon and Buber thus reject traditional religion and supplant it  with religiosity or religious sentiment, the same way secular-believers do.  Such distinction not only echoes the situation of secular-believers in Israel,  but also may confirm their position. Differentiation between religion and  religiosity, between Judaism and the Jewish religion, becomes less intuitive  and more coherent through Buber’s and Gordon’s theological work. Hermeneutics and Human exPerience The distinction that Buber and Gordon drew between religion and religios- ity or religious sentiment is also reflected clearly in their epistemology and  methodology, which are directly connected with their attitude to traditional  Jewish sources. Both allowed themselves to draw on various sources in a  highly selective manner—Gordon primarily on the Bible and the Kabbalah  </page> <page sequence="16"> 204 • israel studies, volume 19 number 1 and Buber mostly on the Bible and Hasidic lore. They did not focus on the  hermeneutics of their sources, which they perceived as human in origin. As  a source of knowledge, these writings were considered only to the extent  that they reflect human experiences of contact with the divine during  specific historical periods. Human experience—contemporary and histori- cal, individual and national—is their key source of knowledge: personal  experience, the experience of humankind as a whole, and the experience of  a given national group. Schweid108 states that Gordon would derive a kernel of moral or religious truth from the text to which he absolutely  agreed, or would grasp at an expression of living emotion that he found par- ticularly appropriate to his own feelings. Once he connects his “inner self ”  to the Bible in this manner, he consciously allows himself simple expression  of all it arouses within his soul. Citations from the Jewish bookshelf thus enabled Gordon to reveal his  own subjectivity. The information obtained, combined with his experience  and a preconscious sense of life, thus becomes the source of meaning. Experience is also the source of morality: What we have of morality is what exists in the human soul [and not in sacred  writings] . . . So long as there is an “I,” there is also its attitude towards nature,  towards humanity, towards itself, namely, its point of morality. The richer,  deeper and more comprehensive this “I,” the more natural it is and the more  it lives the very meaning of the exalted, the more it dwells within the soul  of every person, of every living being, of all Creation, infinitely—the more  lofty its morality.109 Buber, too, stands out for his selective approach to traditional Jewish  writings.110 He accepted sources that he found conducive to renewal and  rejected those that he believed to embody mummified, repressive stagna- tion. Like Gordon, he maintained that contact with the divine is first  and foremost a subjective path of concrete life experiences rather than  interpretation of canonic sacred texts. Schweid claims that Gordon influ- enced Buber to adopt an experiential approach, according to which one  cannot have any concept of God as a conscious object but rather as an  emotion, feeling, or experience alone. Buber believed that any attempt at  understanding God was tantamount to idolatry.111 </page> <page sequence="17"> Postsecular Jewish Theology: Reading Gordon And Buber  • 205 For both Gordon and Buber, the choice of the Jewish bookshelf was by  no means arbitrary, as it expresses their selective identity as Jews. Gordon  perceived these sources as manifesting the “root of his soul” as a Jew,  which he considers to be Judaism itself, while for Buber, they constituted  a community manifestation of human values that developed within the  framework of Judaism, especially the values of the Prophets.112 Again, Buber’s and Gordon’s view can affirm and enrich Israeli secular- believers’ intuitions. Their un-apologetic selective drawing from Jewish texts  and their emphasis on human experience as the primary source of knowl- edge, gives a methodological and epistemological weight to postsecular  sentiments. CONCLUSION Jewish secular-believers may be characterized by three components. First,  they are self-identified Jews. Second they are secular in the sense that they  reject traditional religion and adopt many of the cultural, epistemological,  and moral assumptions of the secular thesis. And third, “they have God in  their heart” in the sense that they believe in some kind of a “more”. As we saw, in Israel this group is not recognized as a group and is not  legitimated as a social category. For example: “Secular-believer” is not a  category in the religiosity scale; secular-believers are not studied as a group  (although sub-groups within it are being studied); and the term itself is  hardly known. When a social group is not recognized, individuals lose the  ability to identify themselves as members of this group. Their sentiments  tend to stay on the intuitive, personal level. (Re)introducing insightful texts that are relevant to the group mem- bers may help them clarify their identity. I propose that reading Buber and  Gordon from a postsecular perspective not only sheds a new light on their  work but may also prove helpful to Jewish secular-believers. Both think- ers express deep and extensive ideas that, although conceived decades ago,  resonate with the same theological dilemmas addressed in current discourse. As postsecular theologians, Buber and Gordon place human relations  with the beyond at the core of their anthropological, social, and ethical  conceptions. Gordon attributes a pantheistic, immanent quality to this  divinity, while Buber primarily views it as transcendent, but both still  remain well within the boundaries of postsecular theology, which allows  considerable latitude in understanding God, so long as such conceptions  </page> <page sequence="18"> 206 • israel studies, volume 19 number 1 are not the traditional or anthropomorphic formulas, such as “Our Father  in heaven”, “the King of Kings”, etc. As postsecular theologians, Gordon and Buber manifest hybridity  of the religious and the secular. They are “religious” because they place  religious experiences at the core of their thinking, as a means of con- solidating anew ethical conception of I-Thou relations (Buber) or relations  between human beings or society and nature (Gordon). They reject atheism  because it encourages a kind of individualism that is extreme, destructive,  and narcissistic, leading people to retreat, turtle-like, into their shells on  encountering the “other”, whether sentient, animal, vegetable, or mineral. At the same time, the two philosophers are “secular” in their rejection  of Halakha as unethical, withering, and hidebound coercion. Their research  methodology is secular as well, influenced by the anthropocentricism of  the Enlightenment, rejecting a considerable part of the religious canon and  perceiving even the parts it does adopt as a human creation rather than a  divine one. As such, the epistemic origin is not “the word of God” and the  hermeneutics of religious writings, but “listening to human beings” and  assessing their individual and national experiences. The hybridity of religion and secularism is thus manifested in the writ- ings of Gordon and Buber in the juxtaposition of emphasis on religious  sentiment and focus on humanity and its experiences, while ruling out  traditional religion and its epistemology and methodology. Such rejection  of the religious establishment, its texts and its rituals, is not accompanied by  a desire to institute other obligatory texts or ceremonies in their stead. On  the contrary, their religiosity demands constant development and change  in accordance with the individual’s everyday experiences. Furthermore,  both Buber and Gordon are postsecular Jews, whose indisputable Jewish  identity is perceived as different from other religious identities, even secular  non-Jewish identities.113 As postsecular theologians, their writings may well be highly relevant  to secular-believers who are searching for ( Jewish or other) sources of  belief. Furthermore, their theology embodies a kind of added value—not  only for Jews but for all humanity. Buber has already been recognized for  his contribution in this respect. Gordon is still waiting to be discovered. </page> <page sequence="19"> Postsecular Jewish Theology: Reading Gordon And Buber  • 207 Notes 1. Postsecular trends that originate in defined “religious” schools of thought,  such as the revival of various neo-Hasidic movements, are beyond the scope of  this study, as is postsecular analysis of Israeli law.

Biale, for example, identifies postsecular characteristics in Jewish philosophy  since the age of Maimonides, although for some reason he does not include Gordon  and Buber among the philosophers whose works he examines. See David Biale,  Not in the Heavens: The Tradition of Jewish Secular Thought (Princeton, 2011). As  Schweid notes, however, one should not confuse postsecular hybridism with the  dialectics of religion and nationality that characterized Jewish philosophy of the  eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, because secularization, in the sense derived  from the secularization thesis and its connection with modernity, is a given fact  that could no longer be challenged in the twentieth-century West.

In this study, “spirituality” is defined as a way of life that underscores “the  deepest values and meanings that wo/men live by,” with emphasis on experiences  and spaces of sanctity and faith in a reality that goes beyond the material, whether  perceived as transcendental or immanent. Although religions are among the most  outstanding manifestations of a spiritual approach, the concept of spirituality is  not limited to them but today includes an extensive range of outlooks and schools  of thought that center on an aspiration for connection with “a broader reality”  than the material one. In this sense, the concept describes an individual process or  situation focusing on a personal quest for a “spiritual path”.

In this context, Menachem Brinker proposes differentiating between “soft  secularism”, characterized by transfer of religion to public space and “hard secular- ism” that is “anti-theology, stubbornly agnostic, or even heretic and atheistic.” See  Menachem Brinker, “Jewish Secularism? There Is Such a Thing!” Ha’aretz 15 Octo- ber 2007, accessed 15 May 2012, http://haaretz.co.il/opinions/letters/1.1450227  [Hebrew]. Brinker estimates that only 10% of the population of Israel consists of  hard secularists. Research commissioned by the Avi Chai Foundation and the Gutt- man Center shows that only 3% of Israeli Jews define themselves as anti-religious.  See Ayala Keissar-Sugarmen, A Portrait of Israeli Jews: Beliefs, Observance and Values  of Israeli Jews, 2009 ( Jerusalem, 2012). Unlike Brinker, the postsecular approach does  not perceive what he terms soft secularism to be a weaker conception than the hard  variety, but rather as one that expresses the lack of dichotomous differentiation  between religiosity and secularism. 31. While 50% of Israeli Jews defined themselves as secular, 80% claim that they  believe in God (Keissar-Sugarmen, A Portrait of Israeli Jews). In a survey conducted  </page> <page sequence="22"> 210 • israel studies, volume 19 number 1 in Israel in 2006, 77% of participants responded affirmatively when asked if they  believe in God. Another 8% chose the response “believe in some kind of supreme  force”, 12% answered in the negative, and 3% did not respond (Yedioth Ahronoth,  13 April 2006). In another survey that year, 70% of participants responded that  they believe in God, ynet, 6 October 2006, accessed 20 May 2010, http://www.ynet  .co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3311545,00.html. 32.

The prefix “post-” here reflects two dimensions relevant to content rather  than chronology: First, it stipulates the connection between this theology and a  postsecular perspective, asserting that secularism is negated by the combination  of secularism and theology and the quest for hybrid thinking space. Second, it  differentiates this theology and secular theology, usually associated with “God is  dead” theology that is incompatible with postsecular theology. 34.
