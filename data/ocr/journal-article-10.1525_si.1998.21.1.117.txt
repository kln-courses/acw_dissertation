<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> BOOK REVIEW  Regarding Animals ,  by Arnold Arluke and Clinton R. Sanders  Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1996  256 pp. $54.95 (cloth); $16 .95 (paper)  Reviewed by Spencer E. Cahill, University of South Florida  My spouse and I recently adopted two kittens. Me1 (after Tormk) is hyperactive, mischie-  vous, and demanding. Ella (after Fitzgerald) is subdued, loving, but aloof. Anthropomor-  phizing? Certainly, but it does help us deal with our new feline companions. Many of us who  live and work with animals are implicitly aware of the practical value of anthropomorphism  but are reluctant to admit it, even to ourselves. Yet, we just may know better than those who  object to attributing ostensibly human qualities to nonhuman animals. That is only one of  the bold and provocative arguments advanced in Regarding Animals (pp. 80-81).  Throughout this book, Arluke and Sanders claim that students of social life can learn as  much from animals’ relations with humans as we belatedly learned from outsiders’,  women’s, and I would add, children’s relations with their self-appointed superiors. This  claim is not based on idle speculation. It is supported with rich, thick, and diverse empirical  information from two authors who know how to do ethnographic research and how to  explain clearly and convincingly why they did what they did (pp. 18-40). There are telling  examples from Sanders’ autoethnography of his relationship with his own canine compan-  ions and from his ethnographies of a “puppy kindergarten,” veterinary clinic, and guide  dog trainers.  In addition, entire chapters are based on Arluke’s ethnography of a “kill shelter,” where  animals are routinely euthanized, and on his comparative ethnography of two primate  research laboratories. There is insight, humor, pathos, and, for animal lovers like me, both  gratifying and discomforting reflections of ourselves in these rich empirical materials.  Still, this book is not just for animal lovers. Its theoretical arguments and insights are as  rich, thick, and diverse as the empirical information on which they are based. Perhaps the  most provocative is Arluke and Sanders’ spirited challenge to “linguacentric” accounts of  mind, including the Meadian one to which many readers of this journal subscribe (Chapters  2 and 3). Following Gubrium and others, they argue that mind does not reside inside the  heads of lingual beings but in the interactional traffic between beings, including that  between lingual and alingual ones. This social constructionist account of mind goes far  beyond the banal observation that humans sometimes unilaterally attribute mind to their  nonhuman companions. Arluke and Sanders argue, with compelling empirical examples,  that many of our nonhuman companions are minded social actors who endow objects with  Symbolic Interaction 21(1): 117-119 Copyright 0 1998 by JAl Press Inc.

Although Arluke and Sanders only hint at the broad applicability of this argument, it  will be obvious to readers who are familiar with the work of Gubrium, Bogdan and Taylor,  and David Goode. Linguacentric accounts of mind blind us to the possibility of meaning-  fully interacting with not only animals but alingual humans, as well. That blindness, rather  than their lack of language, may well be what deprives them of minds.  This is just one example of how the theoretical iessons of this book reach far beyond its  explicit theme: How humans regard animals in modem Western societies (p. 4). The kill  shelter workers’ tortured relations with the animals they euthanize and with their own con-  sciences provides another. Arluke and Sanders show how those workers collectively sus-  tain self-congratulatory moral identities despite their apparently amoral dirty work (chapter  4). This is arguably a telling case of a much more common phenomenon. Most of us are  required to commit a variety of little murders as part of our jobs, and, like the workers at the  lull shelter, we labor to neutralize the incriminating implications of that dirty work. More-  over, like those whose victims are abandoned animals, we thereby reproduce the very insti-  tutions that require such moral compromises. Similarly, Arluke and Sanders’ comparative  analysis of how workers at two research laboratories regarded and treated their primate  charges also contains a more general theoretical lesson (Chapter 5). Although their treat-  ment of primates was ostensibly guided by the same scientific protocols, workers at one lab  considered their charges unpleasant creatures that had to be forcibly subdued, while those  at the other lab considered members of the same species child-like creatures who required  nurturing affection. That contrast illustrates the power of local cultures to counter received,  apparently hegemonic systems of meaning. In adhtion, it confirms an old Blumerian argu-  ment about the play and fate of meaning in human affairs, including, so it would seem, our  affairs with nonhuman animals.  The general theoretical lessons in Arluke and Sanders’ ethnohistory of the Nazi’s sym-  pathetic identification with animals and “animalization” of humans are less obvious, but it  is fascinating nonetheless (Chapter 6). If nothing else, it illustrates the historical and cross-  cultural plasticity and complexity of humans’ hierarchical classifications of “being.” Fol-  lowing this intriguing ethnohistorical case study, Arluke and Sanders advance a general  analysis of the evaluative categories that constitute our hierarchical classifications of being  or what they term “the sociozoologic scale” (Chapter 7). I found their rendering of that  scale a bit strained, but their general point about the ambiguity and capriciousness of social  typifications is well taken. Throughout the volume, Arluke and Sanders highlight the  inconsistency of our definitions and treatment of animals. They reminded me of a milk cow  from my childhood whom my older sister and I named “Bossy,” taught to come when  called, and rode almost daily. To us, the rest of the cows in the herd were merely animate  sources of milk that came and went, but “Bossy” was different. Therein lies the genius of  the ambiguity and capriciousness of social typifications. In the words of Arluke and Sand-  ers, they allow us to “live comfortably with contradictions as a natural and normal part of  everyday life” (p. 190). For contradictory creatures who consider themselves both beasts  and demigods, that is no small comfort.  </page> <page sequence="3"> Book Reviews 119  Although admirable, the empirical and theoretical diversity of Regarding Animals does  have a cost. Its chapters do not logically cohere into a seamless volume. Yet, they can be  profitably and pleasurably read as a thematically unified collection of essays. As reactions  to some of the previously published articles on which these essays draw attest, they will  provoke reflection and debate concerning some of our most jealously guarded assumptions  about ourselves, our relations with nonhuman and human animals, and our scholarly enter-  prise. That provocation'can only invigorate the study and students of social life. Those who  are already convinced that there is much to learn from our dealings with animals will want  to read this book. Those who think that the study of human-animal interaction is a cute  diversion from intellectually weightier matters should read this book. There are lessons for  all of us in its pages. Not the least of those lessons is that nonhuman animals have a prom-  inent place in the social lives of the human variety and, consequently, should be granted  such a place in the study of those lives.  </page> </plain_text>
