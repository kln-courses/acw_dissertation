<plain_text><page sequence="1">ADDITIONAL PHILISTINE TEMPLES AT TELL QASILE AMIHAI MAZAR Since 1971 excavations at Tell Qasile have revealed the existence of three Philistine temples built in succession on the same spot, beginning in the 12th century B.C.E. and ending three centuries later, when the settlement was abandoned. The finds, including three remarkable cult stands, make a valuable contribution to our understanding of Philistine culture. Since holy places retain their character from generation to generation, it is neither unusual nor surprising to excavate a temple and find that it stands on the ruins of earlier temples. This has been true of many excavations in Israel-Hazor, Megiddo, Beth-shean, and Lachish, for example-and elsewhere in the eastern It is neither unusual nor surprising to excavate a temple and find that it stands on the ruins of earlier temples. Mediterranean. We were curious, therefore, to discover whether the Philistine temple uncovered in Tell Qasile's Stratum X in 1972 followed this pattern. During the 1973 and 1974 seasons,* we removed the inner sections of the temple, including the floor, and excavated to bedrock. The Stratum X temple was found to be the third of a series, the first of which dated to the 12th century B.C.E., the period of the earliest settlement. * The Tell Qasile excavations were sponsored by the Archaeological Institute of the Hebrew University, the Ha'aretz Museum, and the Israel Exploration Society. The author was assisted by A. Yoseph, I. Levy, E. Lass, A. Megiddon, D. Altman, S. Yankelowitz, S. Kochavi, O. Mish, H. Fr6hlich, and P. Ullman. The blueprints were made by I. Portugali and drawn by L. Rittmayer. The Stratum XII Temple A small temple with a single room was uncovered in Stratum XII. Roughly square, its external dimensions were 6.4 x 6.6 m. Its mud-brick walls, without stone foundations, were plastered on the inner face with mud; along the walls were low benches, also of mud brick. A sandstone slab formed the threshold of the entrance which was in the center of the east wall. Opposite was a raised platform of plastered bricks with a flight of steps leading up to it. On the remains of this platform lay the floor of the next temple. We could not determine the plan of the western section of the earliest temple because of the overlying western wall of the Stratum XI temple. Possibly there was a small storage space behind the raised platform, as there was later. A number of artifacts were found on the compacted earth floor, most notably an unusual Philistine vessel; the body is a concave cylinder decorated in the geometric Philistine style, with flasklike handles and neck. Among other finds were several small offering bowls. Although the floor was buried under brick and plaster debris 50 cm. thick, there was no evidence of destruction by fire. The wide courtyard, east and north of the temple, was covered with dirt, ash, bones, and potsherds. No 82 MAY 1977</page><page sequence="2">courtyard wall was found, but a long, narrow, brick- walled room on the western side was undoubtedly used in connection with the cult in the temple. Outstanding among the finds was an ivory knife handle, a portion of the iron blade still held in place by bronze rivets, which resembles the one recently recovered at Enkomi in Cyprus, from the same period. The knife is one of the earliest iron artifacts found in Israel. South and west of the temple were the remains of buildings, the complete plan and nature of which are not yet clear; they are indicative, nevertheless, of a well- settled community during the Stratum XII period. The original layout of the sacred area, fixed in Stratum XII, was preserved in the later strata. The Stratum XI Temple The rough stone walls of the new temple (7.75 x 8.5 m.) were built on the ruins of the previous one, partly within the bounds of the earlier building but extending AR II I iQDKIII2 00 C3 O C C beyond it to the east and north. A 1.4-m.-wide entrance in the northern part of the east wall led to the central hall where brick benches lined the walls. In the southwest corner were the foundations of a small brick enclosure, undoubtedly used for storage like the long, narrow room in the Stratum X temple. In the northwest corner, opposite the entrance, was a deep niche with benches on three sides. This may have been the holy of holies, although it is equally possible that the brick foundations west of the niche formed a raised platform similar to those in the Strata XII and X temples. It is clear, in any case, that the holy of holies was close to that of the earlier temple and that the rites were oriented toward the west. Artifacts abounded in the southwest corner: fragments of a life-size anthropomorphic clay mask, clay statuettes of a bird and an animal, a bird-shaped cosmetics box, a seashell used as a horn, hundreds of tiny faience beads, and a variety of pottery vessels, many of them small offering bowls. Additional finds in the northwest corner included stirrup jars decorated in the Philistine style and remnants of woven cloth in blue and red. The plan of the sacred area was the same in Strata XII and XI; a wide courtyard lay to the east, north, and west of the temple. The floor sloped northwest, following the contour of the natural rock, and had been repaired repeatedly. North of the courtyard, the long brick-walled room from the earlier period had been restored and made smaller; adjacent to it was a similar brick-walled chamber, but without stone foundations. In the southern part of the courtyard, next to the west wall of the temple, a small shrine (2.2 x 4.18 m.) with brick walls plastered with white lime was excavated. Accessible through the northeast corner of the building were an anteroom and the holy of holies, lined with benches. A raised platform in the southwest corner of the room, consisting of two plastered brick steps, held three cylindrical, windowed cult stands decorated with rich Schematic plans of the temples at Tell Qasile.

Two of the stands were found with ceremonial bowls fitted on top; one bowl was undecorated, but attached to the rim of the second were a duck's head, tail, and wings. The third bowl, decorated with a bird head, was discovered in the anteroom. On the sanctuary floor, not far from the cult stands, were numerous pottery vessels, among them globular goblets, one decorated with a' Philistine bird motif. When the building collapsed, a 1.8-m.-thick layer of brick was left on which the lime-plastered floor of Stratum IX was laid. Various factors indicated that this small shrine was built in Stratum XI but continued in use without alteration in Stratum X. South of the teinple and adjoining it was a cluster of buildings, one of which, on the evidence of still incomplete excavation, seems to have been a public building. The Stratum X Temple Thanks to extensive excavation, the Stratum X temple can be reconstructed in detail. It appears to be a restoration and enlargement of the Stratum XI temple, reusing three of the four stone walls. The east wall was replaced by a new anteroom. The floor of the temple was laid onm brick and earth fill, into which had been set two pillar-bases made of well-cut cylindrical stones. During the excavation the raised platform and benches were removed, and behind the platform, inside the brick wall of the store room, offering vessels were discovered, one of them an alabaster flask. The plan of the Stratum X courtyard was completely recovered. The wide, open court of the earlier strata had been divided into a northeast and a northwest section, both walled. The foundations of an altar had been unearthed in 1972 in the northeast courtyard, which Tell Oasile shioh 0 Jerusalem 0 25 km Hebron kpj enclosed one of the two earlier rectangular rooms. In the northwest courtyard a small square room adjoined the north wall of the temple; southwest of it was the small shrine of the previous stratum, still being used.

There was no direct physical link, however, between the sacred area and the house, the entrance of which seems to have been from a street west of the excavated area. A wide roadway south of the house was well paved with sandstone. The Three Temples The evidence indicates that the sancturary at Tell Qasile was founded when the Philistines settled the site in the mid-12th century B.C.E. and continued to be developed throughout the early Iron Age. Although the Stratum XII temple was rebuilt and restored in Strata XI and X, both the western orientation and the location of the holy of holies were carefully preserved. The main temple was probably dedicated to the chief local deity and The main temple was probably dedicated to the chief local deity, the smaller one either to the deity's consort or to a minor god. the smaller one to the west either to the deity's consort or to a minor god. The courtyards surrounding the temple evolved gradually, their greatest development coinciding with that of the settlement itself in Stratum X. Our examination of the pottery and stratigraphy from the most recent season, as well as from the previous ones, validated the basic conclusions of Professor B. Mazar concerning Strata XII-X ("The Excavations at Tell Qasile," Israel Exploration Journal 1 [1950-51]: 67- 68). These should be dated to the Philistine period, from the mid-12th century to the beginning of the 10th century. The Stratum X settlement was destroyed by fire, probably during the Davidic conquest. The dating of Strata IX-VII, on the other hand, must be revised. Stratum IX, which in some areas has two phases, should be dated to the first half of the 10th century B.C.E., and Stratum VIII to the second half of the 10th and BIBLICAL ARCHEOLOGIST 85</page><page sequence="5">..?,t. ??: I??.?: .- 5:j;i.-?

The temple, though poorly rebuilt, retained its function in both Strata IX and VIII. Most of the pottery ascribed to Stratum VII in the Israel Exploration Journal report cited above should be attributed to Stratum VIII, and in any case, is not later than the 10th century. The site was abandoned during most of the 9th and 8th centuries and the beginning of the 7th, and then reoccupied in the late 7th century; Stratum VII should be assigned to this sparse occupation, which was probably occasioned by Josiah's expansion of the kingdom of Judah to the coast.
