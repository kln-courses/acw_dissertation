<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS of its quality and breadth of treatment, this volume will appeal both to scholars interested in the subject of praetorianism and university profes- sors looking for a good supplementary text for Latin American politics courses. But it does not provide much convincing evidence in support of its central thesis, or much guidance with regard to which of the contending points of view concerning the military's post-Cold War role is fundamen- tally correct. Has the praetorian lion permanently retired to his lair, or is he just taking a short nap? Even if military praetorianism is a thing of the past, will it make any difference for the long-term health of Latin America's new democracies? All over the region, the persistence of weak national institutions, civilian corruption, violence, and general problems of ungovernability has led to the growing phenomenon of "soft" civilian dictatorships. One of the great paradoxes of Latin American political history has been that praetorian military interventions have often been the only effective means of ending long periods of civilian authoritarian rule. We must hope that history does not repeat itself. Steve C. Ropp University of Wyoming Carlos Escude. Foreign Policy Theory in Menem's Argentina. Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 1997. Table, notes, index, 232 pp.; hardcover $49.95. In this book Carlos Escude, an Argentine international relations specialist and former adviser to Argentina's current foreign relations minister, criticizes realistic, interdependent, and other conventional approaches to international relations while outlining and advocating his own approach, identified as peripheral realism. From the political perspective, Escude's book seeks to offer theoretical support and normative justification to the foreign policy strategy followed by the Menem administration since 1989. At that time, the newly inaugurated government decided to implement a steadfast policy of Western alignment and, especially, of promoting close ties-"carnal relations," in the words of Argentina's foreign minister, Guido Di Tella-with the United States. This approach represented a radical shift in Argentina's traditional foreign policies, which had been characterized, particularly during Peronist administrations, by their nationalist and non- aligned features and their recurrent confrontations with the United States. Well before this new foreign policy shift occurred, Carlos Escude had become its foremost advocate. He had published several books and articles that criticized Argentina's territorial nationalism, its mania for grandeur, and its tendency needlessly to confront the great powers and provoke 97</page><page sequence="2">98 JOURNAL OF INTERAMERICAN STUDIES AND WORLD AFFAIRS 40: 1 devastating reprisals. Peripheral realism, by contrast, is a realistic foreign policy approach whose primary goal is to promote economic develop- ment, departing from a pragmatic recognition of the constraints faced by underdeveloped, weak states in their international undertakings. This the author offers as the philosophical and theoretical foundation of the alternative foreign policies that Argentina's democratic governments should adopt if they want to promote the welfare of the citizens. Escude supported some initiatives taken by the Alfonsin administra- tion, such as the peaceful resolution of the border dispute with Chile and the strengthening of the Southern Cone's economic integration process. But he was disappointed by that government's tendency to follow some of the traditional nationalistic and confrontational policies vis-a-vis the United States and the United Kingdom, which he defines as a mix of "ingenuous realism" and "confrontational idealism." In contrast, Escude saw Carlos Menem's foreign policy of Western alignment, cooperation with the United States, and general pragmatism as the fulfillment of his expectations, and he became its most astute and sophisticated expositor and champion in the hope of offering the doctrinal basis for the new Argentine international strategy. This book represents the culmination of that process, as the author engages in an ambitious attempt to establish a more solid theoretical foundation for his notion of peripheral realism. The volume contains six different chapters-or essays-which examine the flaws the author perceives in "Anglo-American" international relations theory and explain the advantages of developing and applying a peripheral realist approach. Mainstream international relations theory is criticized, in general, for its tendency to adopt a reified state-centered approach that uncritically accepts the anthropomorphic fallacy of treating states as persons, with negative consequences in both analytical and practical terms. Other chapters point out several characteristic flaws in classical and structural realism and establish the differences between peripheral realism and complex interdependence. Thus, Escude criticizes realist theories for their state-centric nature, their disregard for the hierarchical connections between wealth and power, their emphasis on power or security and neglect of citizen welfare, and the lack of distinction between the state and the elites that dominate it. Complex interdependence is criticized for embracing the fallacies that global interdependence has increased (this is not true for most Third World countries), that international organizations increase Third World power (clearly this not the case when weak actors attempt to pursue confronta- tional policies against strong ones), and that autonomy produces develop- ment (when, in reality, it is development that may generate autonomy). Finally, the author argues that peripheral realism avoids these pitfalls by adopting a developmentalist paradigm that "focuses not on national security, nor on autonomy defined in terms of a government's freedom to</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS do what it pleases [but] instead focuses on the foreign policy constraints imposed by the interstate system" (p. 127). Such a paradigm has as its ideal type a foreign policy that sees the primary goal of a peripheral state as economic development, be it either for the material welfare of its citizens (that is, citizen-centric) or for the accumulation of state power through the mercantilistic link between wealth and power (that is, a benign state-centric policy, as opposed to the malignant state-centrism that ranks politico-military power or security as its top priority). (p. 132) From a theoretical perspective, Escude's book makes an interesting critical contribution to the study of international relations. Although many of his criticisms of realist and complex interdependence theories had already been raised in the past by authors who underscored the problems associated with these approaches-from the use of reified state-centric conceptions to the impossibility of operationalizing and empirically testing the interdependentist assertions-Escude does a sound job of pointing out their main theoretical flaws and explaining their harmful impact on the study of international relations and the formulation and implementation of foreign policies in the developing world, and particularly in the case of Argentina. His study, however, becomes less convincing when the author tries to present his peripheral realistic approach as a valid alternative to the other approaches. Perhaps because peripheral realism is defined as "more a foreign policy philosophy than a positivist social science," the author offers a number of valid-or at least reasonable-foreign policy interpre- tations and recommendations; but he does not meet the requirements (such as detailed examination of basic theoretical assumptions, explana- tory power, definition of levels of analysis, adequate degree of parsimony, and broad evidential base) necessary to develop a theory of international relations or, more modestly, a theoretical framework adequate for the analysis of these relations from the peripheral perspective. Finally, given the author's normative considerations, it is important to examine to what extent peripheral realism has been or is a doctrine that adequately reflects Menem's foreign policy or that has influenced its formulation and implementation. In this regard, it is correct to say that the peripheral realist analysis, as Escude presents it, condenses some of the most notorious aspects of Menem's foreign policies and offers normative support for them. What does not seem completely accurate, however, is the general assumption that Menem's foreign policies respond to a citizen- centric approach, the chief aim of which is to secure, through economic development, the material welfare of the people. In the case of Argentina, as in many other Latin American and Third World countries, it is at least doubtful that political democratization, economic liberalization, and foreign policies of Western alignment have led to increased citizen welfare, particularly considering the current levels of corruption, domestic insecu- rity, unemployment, and other problems. Without denying that democracy and peace have considerable advantages over authoritarianism and 99</page><page sequence="4">100 JOURNAL OF INTERAMERICAN STUDIES AND WORLD AFFAIRS 40: 1 conflict, it is possible to argue that the new foreign policies may be as elite- centered as the previous ones, albeit operating in a new context. Thus, Western alignment, rapprochement with the United States and Great Britain, acceptance of International Monetary Fund recommenda- tions, and other similar policies may contribute to fostering a situation in which a predatory elite increases its own wealth and power while ignoring the citizens' plight as long as internal pressures do not become politically unbearable. If this is the case, a crucial component of peripheral realism- its ethical, citizen-centric dimension-is missing, and we cannot consider it as the foundation of Menem's foreign policy strategy; nor can we see its author as the "Mr. X" of a new Argentine international doctrine.

Map, illustrations, bibliography, index, x, 274 pp.; hardcover $48.50. In the rich literature on the post-authoritarian democracies of Latin America and southern Europe, surprisingly little research has investigated conser- vative parties. These parties are important because they have the potential to channel upper-class interests into the democratic system and away from extra-electoral alliances with technocrats or militaries. In Class and ConservativeParties, Edward L. Gibson applies his deep knowledge of the workings of contemporary Argentine politics to make an important advance in the comparative parties literature. The book uses a comparative perspective to analyze the role of upper-class actors in the Argentine political system, beginning with the interior-capital clashes of the last century and moving through the conservatives' reaction to the emergence of the Radical and Peronist parties; the role of conservative parties and their leaders in military regimes, particularly during the 1976- 83 Proceso; the reasons pre-Proceso conservative parties failed to gain a place in the democratic transition; the emergence of the Union del Centro Democrfatico (UCEDE) in the post-transition period; and the decay of that party as its leadership and ideology were co-opted by Carlos Menem in the early 1990s. Gibson explains persuasively the electoral and nonelectoral strategies used by the Argentine upper classes to participate in politics and shows how ideological and organizational differences among geographi- cally disparate parties have contributed to the weakness of parties on the Argentine right. He centers his explanation of party weaknesses on the</page></plain_text>
