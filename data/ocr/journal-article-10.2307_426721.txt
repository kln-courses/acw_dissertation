VII JUNE, 1949 NO. 4 THE JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS &amp; ART CRITICISM THE AESTHETIC ANALYSIS OF A WORK OF ART An Essay on the Structure and Superstructure of Poetry CHARLES LALOl I. FROM FACTS TO VALUES Whether it be a question of ethics, logic or aesthetics, in all the so-called normative sciences the master-problem on which everything else depends is always that of passing from the ascertainment of facts to the assessing of their values. Some aestheticians have taken delight-to the detriment of aesthetics-in accomplishing this difficult transition by means of the magical properties of attractive-looking formulas. The beauty of these formulas is sometimes lyrical and sometimes rhetorical, but scarcely ever more than verbal; while the method pursued, whether a priori or empirical, turns out to be sophistical or arbitrary. The history of aesthetic systems shows clearly2 that every aesthetic which earnestly strives to avoid overfacile verbalism and to come to grips with specific applications and verifications, without recourse to eloquence or lyricism, ultimately singles out a certain number of heterogeneous mental structures in each of the arts-structures which often have very little value when considered separately, but which are counterpointed in a score where each "voice" or "part" must be perceived, simultaneously, in its own right and in relation to the other "voices". The "score" is thus a structure made up of structures, a "super- structure" which is the work of art and which, by the degree of its Prdgnanz, gives the measure of its artistic value. This is the new approach to aesthetics, which we may call "structural". New, but already hinted at in a more or less confused way in the approaches of the more discerning theorists of modern times. Such is the case (to select two extremes in aesthetics) of the free play of faculties and the four antinomian "moments" in the judgment of taste in Kant's formalism on the one hand, and on the other, of the "convergence of effects" to produce "the ideal in art" as prescribed in Taine's naturalism. To proceed from facts to their aesthetic values is to ascend from heterogeneous structures, which are elementary or relatively simple and natural, to their super- structure of a polyphonic type, which is relatively complex and artificial. According to Croce's Logic, "to declare what a fact called the Divine Comedy 1 Translated by Arthur Knodel. By courtesy of the Journal de Psychologie. 2 See Ch. Lalo, Les 6tapes de l'esthetique structurale, (Revue Philosophique, Juillet 1942). 275</page><page sequence="2">276 CHARLES LALO is, is to declare its value." But, in spite of Crocean intuitionalism, to declare what an aesthetic fact is, is not to arrive mystically at a total, indivisible and absolute "intuition-expression" of it. On the contrary, it means making a comprehensive analysis of a great variety of structural elements. And the artificial ordering of these elements-an ordering that is not merely the realiza- tion of an already latent harmony, but one that is actively perceived and lived in each work of art-is the miracle of genius. A free play, not between imagina- tion and understanding, but between the substructures of a superstructure, is the whole of a work of art. It is this scientifically conceived idea which we shall seek to verify on two famous lines from Lamartine's Poetic and religious harmonies. The couplet forms the conclusion of the first part of Milly, or la terre natale. It may easily be detached from the rest of this rather diffuse, though rigidly organized, de- scriptive piece of which it is the central pivot:' 3 Lamartine sent this poem from Naples, where he was beginning his duties as secretary of the embassy, to his mother in Milly (1822). This romantically nostalgic Harmony is made up of three sections perfectly "composed" in accordance with the rules of the strictest classical rhetoric: 1. a description of objects familiar to Lamartine in his childhood (the conclusion consisting of the two lines we are studying); 2. an antithesis drawn from the natural setting of Naples, whose splendors, devoid of intimate appeal, hold no attraction for the poet; 3. a reversion to the humble but irresistible personal charms of the modest village of Milly. It may be pointed out that the artistic value of such clear, though banal and facile, overall constructions is by no means negligible; but it should also be noted that this quality of purely exterior form was often overprized in classical rhetoric, which was more concerned with pedagogy than with aesthetics. We shall not labor the point here. But it is abolutely essential to note, in the first stanzas of the poem, the premises of our concluding couplet and the almost musical preparation of its fundamental dissonance (which we shall analyze later). It is likewise essential to get some idea, in the following lines, of the pivot around which the exiled poet's thought turns: Milly ou la terre natale Pourquoi le prononcer, ce nom de la patrie? Dans son brillant exil mon coeur en a fr6mi; Ii r6sonne de loin dans mon Ame attendrie, Comme les pas connus ou la voix d'un ami. Chaumiere ou du foyer 6tincelait la flamme, Toit que le pelerin aimait 'a voir fumer, Objets inanimes, avez-vous donc une dme Qui s'attache d notre dme et la force d'aimer? J'ai vu des cieux d'azur, oi la nuit est sans voiles, Dor6s jusqu'au matin sous les pieds des 6toiles, Et Cume, et l'Elys6e,-et mon coeur n'est pas l! (Why do I utter this, my homeland's name? In this sunlit land of exile, my heart trembles to hear it; It reechoes from afar in my impassioned soul Like the well known footsteps or voice of a friend.</page><page sequence="3">STRUCTURE AND SUPERSTRUCTURE OF POETRY 277 Objets inanim~s, avez-vous donc une dme Qui s'attache a notre &amp;ime et la force d'aimer? (Inanimate objects, have you then a soul that clings to our soul and forces it to love?) Does this couplet deserve the admiration which literary criticism has on occasion granted it? In order to determine its value in a scientific spirit, we shall point out factually therein, and align in contrapuntal relationships, at least five "voices" or "parts" (in the language of the polyphonists), or "strata" (in the language of the phenomenologists), or, finally, "structures" (in the lan- guage of gestalt psychology). Their quasi-organic whole makes up the "super- structure", of which the degree of Pragnanz specifically constitutes, and gauges, its aesthetic value. This analytical method, in passing legitimately and quasi-scientifically from facts to their values, might be called an aesthanalysis (by analogy with psycho- analysis). It will be completed by the methods of experimentation and com- parison which are the normal outgrowths of such an analysis. II. THE ANALYTICAL METHOD Five main elemental (we do not say: atomic) structures make up the counter- point at least of five voices that may be heard harmoniously singing in this couplet. The five sub-structures in this superstructure are: the explicit verbal meanings, subconscious suggestions, logical, grammatical linkings, and finally, rhythms and timbres. 1. The structure of explicit verbal meanings The explicit meaning of these two beautiful lines will be easily recognized in one of the following unlovely formulas: "We become attached to familiar objects as we do to friends," or, with greater metaphysical ambitions: "In order to explain the familiar complex of self-love and the love of one's environment for what it contains of the self, why not suppose symbolically that there are souls in the world of nature that surrounds us?" Such is the theme, the cantus firmus of this polyphonic chorus, its most indis- Thatch-but upon whose hearth the flame shone bright, Roof from which the wayfarer loved to see smoke rising, Inanimate objects, have you then a soul That clings to our soul and forces it to love? I have seen azure skies where night has no veils Skies that till dawn gleam gold under the tread of the stars, And Cumae, and Elysium-but my heart is not there! Translator's note: No attempt has been made to render the above lines into English poetry. The bare prose translation given is arranged lineally only for the reader's con- venience. This practice has been followed throughout the present article. The "de- naturing" of poetry in translation might well be cited as further proof of certain of M. Lalo's theses.</page><page sequence="4">278 CHARLES LALO pensable voice, since it introduces all the others. But just as the ambassadorial usher is a very useful, but not the most important of diplomats, so this first and most resonant voice is not in itself the one most heavily laden with values. All things considered, it merely expresses one of the commonest effects of the most ordinary kind of habit. Since the laws of this habit have been known and utilized from time immemorial, this daily-occurring sympathy embodies no mystery that requires such a gratuitous anthropomorphic hypothesis. If, then, it were the value of the idea expressed that bestowed value on the work that expresses it, one would have to conclude-with Plato, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer and many others-that a work of art must certainly be as me- diocre as the idea it expressed. Certain intuitionalists will not fail to challenge this first operation. They do not think it possible to put into the "language of science" something that has been said in "lyrical language." According to them, in this case above all, translation is betrayal, and when one seeks the "same thing" one invariably finds "something else", as Plato said. But if this translation is difficult and only approximate, it is never entirely impossible, since it is a fact that one recognizes the same idea in its two different forms. What differs profoundly in the two forms is the extent and mode of polyphonic structuralization. In prose this first voice is a more or less melodic solo, often endowed with very little "singing" quality. In poetry this first voice enters into contrapuntal relationships with four or five others, each one of which, considered separately (and it is perfectly possible to do this), has little or no aesthetic interest, but which taken all to- gether offer an aesthetic interest which is the essence of art. Such is the first datum of this analysis, which, when concluded, will reveal the artist as a merchant who loses on each small transaction but makes a profit in the overall turnover. What would be an absurdity and certain bankruptcy in economic life is a miracle and a success in artistic life. Here every success is a miracle-so much so that a scientific aesthetic is the very science of the miracle of man. 2. The structure of subconscious suggestions From the moment it is verbally expressed, this banal idea awakens numerous echoes in our subconscious or unconscious: complexes, some universal, others highly individual-which the collective trend of romanticism forced to cross "the threshold of aesthetic awareness"; a development in which the "sociological moment" figures largely, but this is not the place to labor the point. A deep feeling, impassioned yet serene, for the familiar aspects of nature, for a personified world that is near at hand-the same feeling that goes into the pantheistic effusion of Le Lac, but limited to childhood surroundings and memo- ries-is one of the masks behind which psychoanalysis has no difficulty in recognizing sublimated libido. Sentimentalistic aesthetics notwithstanding (intuitionalistic or vitalistic mysticism, symbolic sympathy or empathy: Jouffroy, Guyau, Lipps, Volkelt, Bergson . . . ), this contagion transmitted by our affective life, whatever its power may be, can give us at best only a sense of natural beauty, but not of</page><page sequence="5">STRUCTURE AND SUPERSTRUCTURE OF POETRY 279 artistic beauty. It is not the private value of childhood images (repressed or not) of a "countryside", "roof", or "hearth" which transforms these objects of thought, so common-place in themselves, into artistic masterpieces. It is their verbal representation, artistically counterpointed, which alone can have poetic value-unless we are to be content with mere metaphor. 3. Logical-grammatical structures (semantic, syntactic, logical) The accepted meanings of words, their alignment in sentences acording to the traditional rules of a specific language, and, lastly, their rational interrelation- ships, constitute three structures which are sufficiently unlike to prevent our speaking in a general way of a "logical-grammatical parallelism", in the terms of Serrus. Nevertheless, it must not be forgotten that these three data are always interdependent. Thus, a word usually has several possible meanings, and the choice of the right meaning can be determined only by reference to context. It is the internal logic or the syntactical structure of this context which imposes a single one of the possible meanings by excluding all the others. Conversely, however, no sentence or logical judgment is possible except by virtue of relationships established be- tween the accepted definitions of words-definitions which can be selected only if the various definitions of each word are more or less clearly known in advance.4 We may thus consider these three data as the demands of our various analyses dictate: now as three different voices, now as a single voice, but "divided"; as is sometimes the case with the "parts" in certain choruses or orchestras. The latter solution best fits the case we are considering. As a matter of fact, the three structures, which are interrelated but which frequently follow different paths, here go hand-in-hand-closely linked, almost coincident. First of all, the vocabulary is commonplace or prosaic. Every term is used in its most widely accepted sense. No figure of speech embellishes this vocabulary. But the two notes one might call tonic and dominant. (&amp;ime, aimer) are rich in powerful affective overtones that harmonize completely with the second voice- that of subconscious suggestions. Next, the syntax likewise is simple and normal. It is so logical that we may here legitimately speak of a "logical-gram- matical parallelism": a strict unison, but harmonizing perfectly with the simul- taneous progression of the voices that precede and follow. Only the rather unusual nous force d'aimer (instead of d aimer) brings us up for a moment the way a final rest in music might do. The expression has a threefold justification. First of all, there is the precedent set by a reminiscence of Corneille (in whose time the use of d and de was much less fixed than today). Secondly, 4 For example, every Frenchman knows what incompatible meanings the word &amp;me may arouse in the mind of a psychologist (adme: soul, spirit), of an artilleryman (dme: bore of a gun), of a violinist (dme: sounding-post), of a carpenter (aime: small wood, faggots), etc. In our couplet, the word notre suffices to evoke the psychological meaning of the word dme and to suppress all the others; but all these other meanings enrich the meaning-po- tential that the word dcme keeps hidden in the subconscious mind of an educated person,- a meaning-potential which the context objects inanimis suffices to awaken in a vague way. This anthropomorphism of the common names of many objects is latently present in Lam- artine's thought and in our own to a much greater extent than one would suspect.</page><page sequence="6">280 CHARLES LALO the expression permits the absolute, or in a sense cosmic, use of the all-important word aimer. (A laimer, which would be more correct, would have a more restricted meaning, with only a relative range; moreover, the ill-sounding hiatus a aimer is automatically ruled out.) Lastly, this sort of poetic license fixes our attention for an instant on the impression, likewise striking, of the strange in the familiar or of the unnatural in nature which the first voices of this counterpoint give us. 4. Rhythmical structure of intensities The three foregoing voices naturally call for a calm rhythm, a fluid mobility, a continuous and unimpeded impetus. Thus we find a pleasing symmetry of pauses and stresses. This symmetry is more varied (inverted) in the first line (2,4: 4,2), because here we are chiefly concerned with materiality (objets inanim6s). It is more complete both in balance and uniform movement (3,3: 3,3) in the second, where spirituality (adme, aimer) is completely dominant. The number of syllables and the rhythmic allocation of accents are the most elementary (almost school-boyish) requirements of traditional French verse, for without them one has only rhythmical prose or the loose strophe (see Claudel). Certain theorists, like Grammont, attribute to rhythm a direct symbolic or affective value, a certain rhythm being by its very nature calm or agitated, noble or trivial, sad or gay, idyllic, graceful, tragic or comic. Others, citing numerous examples, have quite correctly shown that no particular rhythm expresses any- thing definite when divorced from its polyphonic relationships with the meaning of words, with sounds, etc. One could easily quote a hundred couplets with the same classical rhythm as the one we are considering, but which express some- thing entirely different, thanks to other "voices" differently "counterpointed" 5. Rhythmical structure of timbres The couplet we are analyzing is complete in itself. It is even enhanced by being isolated from its rather verbose setting. However, its end-rhymes (&amp;me, aimer) presuppose those of the two preceding lines (flamme, fumer). But, isolating these two lines as we have, the subtle appeal contained in them to some unknown attracting force gives freer play to their questioning impulse, which thus finds itself dynamically suspended in our thought without the static hin- drance or bondage of the recurrence of rhymes already heard. But, even though these external rhymes are lacking, two pairs of well-hidden internal rhymes may be heard murmuring discreetly: anim6s, aimer; &amp;me, 6me are rhymes of the "Leonine" type which are hardly encouraged in classical prosody but which Verlaine in particular used in achieving highly musical effects. The two words that exert the greatest magnetic influence, dme, aimer, even suggest an assonance that is not beneath notice in the small world of tonal correspondences. One might call it a "Chinese assonance", because certain ancient Chinese poems rhyme, contrary to ours, at the beginning of each line of words, and not at the end-the position we are wont to use exclusively for rhyming effects. Thus, in this couplet we can hear, subtly muted, three genuine tonal echoes, marvelously adapted to help symbolize the spiritual sympathies proclaimed so</page><page sequence="7">STRUCTURE AND SUPERSTRUCTURE OF POETRY 281 warmly by the first two voices of the poetic chorus. In this fashion all poetry moves towards beauty, "point counter point", or, better, "structure against structure. " It is worth while to make a close comparison between the hidden structures of each of the two lines of the couplet we are dissecting. In the first line we find the following elements dominant: the masculine heaviness of the final syllables (-jets, -mes, vous, donc), the abrupt and mechanical alternation of close and open vowels (o, e, i, a, i, 6) framed in an insistently repetitious pattern of three nasals (inanim6s), and the harshness of the hiatus at a cesural stop intensified by a comma (-es, a-). Three devices well adapted to impart pathos, urgency and a kind of breathlessness to the interrogative apostrophe that animates this inspired rhetoric. On the other hand, in the second line, or beginning even at the end of the first, whenever we are concerned with spiritual communion, everything becomes pliant, intertwining, aerial, light and almost immaterial: the final syllables become feminine (une ame, attache, notre, ame, force); and whereas, by inverse symmetry (almost by a willful dissonance), all the consonants are voiced in the first line (b, j, n, m, d, v-except for c in donc), three consonantal, doubles (tt, rc, tr) punctuate the soaring movement of the second line. The second line cele- brates the mystic victory of mind over matter. Fittingly, it is uniform, com- posed of a tenuous stuff, and pours forth in a single unbroken stream: a very elastic and weak feminine cesura (aime et); the vowels almost entirely open except for three delicate spots at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the line ([i], a, a, a, o, a, [e], a, o, [ai, er])-much like a fulsome cello passage introduced, punctuated and concluded by the delicate notes of flute and oboe. The materiality of the couplet's opening is adequately conveyed by a heavily accented staccato (ob - jets - i - na - ni - mes, a-vez-vous - donc), and the spirituality of the conclusion by a fluid legato, yielding and unbroken (une dme qui s'attache 4 notre dme). Surely this is the "music above all else" that Verlaine sought! But certain phoneticians have exaggerated the part played by vocalic and consonantal timbres, just as they have exaggerated the part played by rhythms of intensity. These tonal qualities have no more value in themselves than the timbres of various musical instruments considered apart from any melody or harmony. A succession of a's, o's and i's would be absurd if it did not weave a contrapuntal pattern in closest union with rhythms, sentences, meanings, and suggestions-the other voices requisite to the poetic chorus. Aesthetic analysis has led us to distinguish at least five "voices" in these lines from Lamartine. A more detailed "aesthanalysis" would undoubtedly lead us to further division of these polyphonic "parts," in some such way as we have indicated with reference to the third voice. And the "aesthanalysis" of other lines might entail still other requirements. But the new voices singled out in this way could probably be considered as modifications or corollaries of the five basic voices.5 5 This would apply, in particular, to certain of the eleven voices that the poet J. Krafft has very ingeniously analyzed in fifteen or so well-chosen examples in La Forme et l'idee en</page><page sequence="8">282 CHARLES LALO We have seen that each of these structural data is of negligible value in itself. On the other hand, each has its own special form or course. Just as voices singing in unison or redoubled one or two octaves higher or lower would be a harmonic error, a formal weakness in musical counterpoint, the complete co- incidence and exact parallelism of voices would be in poetry. Inversely, too great a divergence between the voices-that is to say, discord-would be just as great a flaw. Aesthetic value consists in the harmonization of voices, set off by occasional dissonances which, in the hands of the best technicians of the great periods, are carefully "prepared" or "resolved". In the case of Lamartine, and in a collection of Harmonies, one must expect harmonization to predominate or even reign almost supreme. As a matter of fact, we came across only the merest suggestion of a dissonance in certain consonants that furnish an exquisite flowering shrub with a few useful thorns. But there is another dissonance that is more important because it very ingeniously emphasizes the general paradox of the poetic theme. That is the antithesis inanimes-ame. Its dynamic influence is slight, as it should be. First of all, it is veiled, almost completely hidden under a latin etymology (anima: dime). Then it is prepared by the opening lines of the poem, which are already completely anthropomorphic (comme les pas connus ou la voix d'un ami). Finally, it is resolved by the lines that follow, which describe at length the splendors of the foreign city of Naples and the complete unpretentiousness of the homeland, which, for all that, alone speaks to the poet's heart. The harmony that daily contact weaves between every mind and its familiar surroundings-an idea and a feeling entirely commonplace in themselves-is marvelously escorted by a polyphonic harmony in five voices, an escort that makes up its whole artistic beauty and transforms this natural commonplace into a miracle of art. In this way we have passed from analysis to judgment, from fact to value. Or rather, aesthetic analysis, properly understood, of itself implies judgment and value. Beauty is polyphony. The analysis, shadings and degrees Poesie (Vrin, 1944), a book which appeared after the actual editing of the present article (its publication having been delayed by current events). Five of these voices are pre- dominantly sensuous: the inherent and relative rhythms of each line, its music ("sung- speaking"), the tonal resonance of the vowels ("interplay of the fifteen") and of the con- sonants ("spoken-contour"). Two are intellectual: the pure idea and the subconscious echo. Four are mixed: rime, words, syntax, interrelationship of meanings ("progressus mentis"). One of Krafft's tendencies is to translate into quantities (numbers, or more often simplified and concrete degrees) the qualities or values of each of these voices in each line analyzed (compare La Balance des peintres by R. de Piles, Experimental aesthetics by Fechner, etc.). Thus in Malherbe's very harmonious line: Et les fruits passeront la promesse des fleurs (And the fruits will surpass the blossoms' promise) both the inherent and relative rhythms, the spoken-contour, the words and the progressus mentis are "master voices," the sung-speaking, subconscious echo and rhyme are "primary voices"; finally, the pure idea, the syntax and the interplay of the fifteen are "secondary voices." Abb6 Bremond challenged anyone to explain the beauty of this line in any way other than that of asserting ecstatically that "the current flows through it!" Here we have the clear contrast of a mystically-conceived aesthetic and of a scientifically-conceived aesthetic!</page><page sequence="9">STRUCTURE AND SUPERSTRUCTURE OF POETRY 283 of this beauty are the analysis, shadings and degrees of this polyphony. Aes- thetic value is the degree of Pragnanz of a superstructure. Will it be said that our labors, which are admittedly of a very pedantic sort, claim to uncover in this Lamartinian couplet many devices Lamartine never consciously thought of? Devices which his inspiration, usually so spontaneous, was just as incapable of putting together in these lines as the immediate in- tuition of his admirers is completely indifferent to finding such devices there? For, all that matters is that the "current shall flow through", as Abb6 Bremond says: What a sorry business is the anatomization of an ecstasy, or the logical- grammatical analysis of something that is almost a mystical prayer! But this intuitionalistic approach to the central problem of all art is vicious. Ever since Montaigne and Du Bos hardly anyone questions that our taste is able to judge, and often to judge well, before it explicitly recognizes the implicit reasons which motivated the judgment. But first of all, perhaps taste can judge even better when it recognizes these reasons; and secondly, the real question of aesthetics is not so much one of judging as of explaining one's judgments. It is one thing to enjoy something; to understand one's enjoyment is another. There are intuitive minds for whom comprehension blocks enjoyment; there are others for whom "the greatest pleasure is to comprehend". Let "each one pursue his own delights", without denying those of others, which he can neither experience, nor, even less, judge; and each will find what he seeks in the way his personal or social psychoaesthetic type dictates, whether he be Bremond, Lucretius or Vergil; classic, romantic or decadent. You say Lamartine did not consciously achieve the synthesis of the five voices which our study of his lines has led us so laboriously to attribute to him? You are right; but his unconscious did achieve it. This is necessarily so, for, whatever the case may be, the synthesis is there. The greatest mystery about a poet of genius is the mystery of the "inner first draft" which serves as an intermediary between his work and God, a first draft compound of scrupulous revisions which the poet is loath to reveal even to his admirers, for such revisions are so much more consciously made than the average admirer ever dreams! It is not the hidden parts of the altar that keep the priest alive, even spiritually. But without them, there is neither altar nor priest! Will it be said that, lacking a Bremondian monism which defies all analysis and is decidedly inadequate or lazy, the traditional form-content dualism may furnish a satisfactory analysis? But we have seen that "form" comprises at least three voices, and "content" at least two, and the relationships of these voices engender not only one, but multiple, harmonizations or dissonances, limitless in their shadings and overtones: a store of riches that alone can explain the deep and mysterious aspect of the artistic life, an aspect we have long recog- nized without ever bringing all its hidden magic to light in a scientific spirit. III. THE EXPERIMENTAL METHOD An obscure, eighteenth-century Jesuit priest, for whom the Abbe Bremond has tried to create a posthumous renown, spent his time in "perfecting" Racine's verses by adding to themn inversions and other pretty devices intended to make</page><page sequence="10">284 CHARLES LALO them more "poetic." In so doing he was, without knowing it, the precursor of an "experimental aesthetic" more concrete than Fechner's, an experimental aesthetic that may be profitably used as additional verification of the conclusions arrived at by the "aesthanalytical" method we have just employed. We shall inflict a few corrections on Lamartine, not in the hope of improving upon him, but, on the contrary, with the avowed intention of spoiling his work in order to find out why our changes do spoil it. In an analogous way a biologist will induce sickness in order to study health the better. Since knowledge of the beautiful and the ugly is one, as Aristotle said, the hidden springs of the values (positive or negative) of our couplet will show up so much the better. First of all, let us introduce into the first line a synonym and a plural, both quite as acceptable, not to say even better, than what they replace; for not only do they leave the most important aspects of the first two voices unaltered (those of meaning and suggestion), but they are more logical, since the souls in question are innumerable and since objets inamines is redundant. We shall write: Btres inanim6s, avez-vous donc des 4mes? "Aesthetics of content" should find this pastiche as poetic as Lamartine's original, since the "content" is certainly unchanged, if not improved. But two shadings of the new "form" are anti-harmonic defects. First, to designate brute matter specifically, the feminine softness of 6tres in no way duplicates the masculine roughness of ob-jets, and it emasculates a hemistich that must be rigid and strongly accented: ob-jets i-na-mi-mes. Second, in an inverse way, the doubly feminine une dme of the original proclaims the immateriality of the spirit, which the masculine des and the gratuitous harshness of donc des will cancel out. This double substitution of the light for the heavy, and vice-versa, is a harmonic error in this very subtle counterpoint. As for the second line, two very slight alterations suffice to make it more "correct" in the prosaic sense of the word: . . . une Ame qui s'attache a la n6tre et la force a l'amour. A good prose-writer would certainly prefer this variant: la n6tre avoids the repetition of dime, which is a flaw but which, the poet would say, awakens an echo where there should be one. What would be a mediocre stylist's slovenliness in prose is, in poetry, a great composer's find. In our experiment, the terminal force a l'amour would be more correct than the rather unusual force d'aimer of Lamartine, who follows Corneille's example. But it is banal; it does not focus our attention on this tonic word in the way that the dynamic Cornelian remi- niscence does: and it terminates with open vowels (a, a, ou), a line that begins with a close vowel (i), thus destroying the felicitous symmetry sought by the Lamartinian text. An even simpler experiment consists of changing nothing but the typographical arrangement. One has only to write each hemistich as a complete line (allowing, with all due reservations, for the word dme to rhyme with itself and for the assonance -mes, -mer to constitute a rhyme): Objets inanimhs! Avez-vous donc une dme,</page><page sequence="11">STRUCTURE AND SUPERSTRUCTURE OF POETRY 285 Qui s'attache d notre dme Et la force d'aimer? The simple fact of reinforcing the intensity of the cesuras by making each of them an end-stop suffices to transform this admirable alexandrine couplet into a quatrain of penny-whistle doggerel. And yet, Oh Plato! Oh Kant! Oh Hegel! in both arrangements the idea certainly remains the same. So it must be, if indeed idea there is, that the poetic idea is above all the idea of a polyphony which a single false note suffices to disturb or even destroy. We shall not let our scruples as an experimenter reduce us to the rhetorical sadism of Abb6 Bremond's prot6g6. That man of diabolic taste, more Racinian than Racine, would certainly have proposed an inversion of Lamartine's all too normal beginning: "Inanimes objets! . . . . A notre adme s'attache et d'aimer la force?" But in this regard it is pointless to re-edit the D'amour me font, belle marquise, mourir of Monsieur Jourdain's Master of Philosophy-that outstand- ing prose-writer and experimental aesthetician without knowing it. Nor need we stress that one has only to cripple a line of verse for all its poetry to vanish or die completely: Objets inanimds, avez-vous une ame? When it is no longer in verse-form, this naive question becomes merely a ridiculous common- place that makes one think of the famous quip: "What is not worth while saying in prose is said in verse; what does not deserve to be said in verse is set to music." A more probable aesthetic theorem would be: "In the counterpointing of every work of art the importance of any one voice varies inversely as the quantity and quality of the other voices." Thus far we have experimented chiefly on the last three voices of the five. These three turn out to be indispensable to the first two, which do not acquire aesthetic value except by their being "scored;" lacking this, they are reduced to their moral, sentimental, religious or philosophical values, in short, to their "anaesthetic" or borrowed values. It is even easier to demonstrate experi- mentally, in an inverse way, that the first two voices are indispensable to the three others. But our experiment risks becoming ridiculous or even odious; for, by torturing it, we are making a beautiful work absurd or trivial. And that is a sacrilege quite capable of justly arousing the indignation of its uncritical admirers, just as the profanation of a sacred object normally exasperates un- philosophically inclined believers. But it so happens that there is a literary genre whose principal function is that of methodically carrying out this sacrilege, a genre which for us, moreover, turns out to be a curious "experimental test." We are speaking of parody. To parody a work of art is to alter a few of the voices in its essential polyphony, while leaving the others intact, in such a way that the work becomes unrecogniz- able in one aspect and recognizable in another. To meet the legitimate demands of our purpose, let us contrive a scurrilous parody of Milly, in which the new theme substituted for the poet's nostalgic motif will be a knight-errant's burlesque complaint about his armor, sullied after a tumble into a pile of filth set in his path by means of traitorous evil spells invoked against our hero by some inimical magician:</page><page sequence="12">286 CHARLES LALO Dechets ind~sir~s, 9tes-vous donc une arme Qui s'attache d notre arme et la force d rouiller? (Undesired slops, are you then an arm That clings to our arm and forces it to rust?) In this frightful variant (for which we beg indulgence on the grounds of its intent, which is experimental and not caricatural) the rhythmical structures of intensity and timbres and the structure made up of logical or grammatical linkings remain, to all intents and purposes, the same as those of the parodied masterpiece. The criterion of the legitimacy of this assimilation is that as a matter of fact we recognize them in this new guise. But counterbalancing this, the structures of vocabulary, of explicit meaning and of implicit suggestions are profoundly altered and all their correspondences and harmonization subverted. The champions of "pure poetry" ought to admire the parody almost as much as the original, since it is almost as "musical" as the original, and since, in their view, the rest counts for very little. Yet the result is a very sorry couplet, whose smooth rhythms clash in a pain- fully obvious way with the harshness of the new thought. The case is, then, that, "purists" or "formalists" notwithstanding, the three later voices are as incomplete without the first two, as the first two without the three latter. Far from everything in the aesthetic realm being pure quality and absolute value, all the real essentials are relationships, and even relationships between relation- ships. "A harmony of harmonies," as Henri Delacroix was wont to define the beauty of a line of poetry. The method of concrete aesthetic experimentation thus verifies the principal results of the method of technical analysis or aesthanalysis. On the one hand, it becomes clear that the five constituent voices of poetry may vary and be felt and recognized independently of one another. The texture of a line of poetry is not one structure, but an interplay of almost polyphonic combinations between several different structures, perceived at once together and separately, that is to say, contrapuntally perceived: an artificial superstructure made up of various natural structures or forms. On the other hand, to insist that one-or even two-of these separate voices predominate exclusively is either a doctrinaire's abstract paradox, a collective prejudice of some literary "school," or a dilettante's subjective fancy. According to the principles of structural aesthetics, "total" poetry is essentially a technical complex accessible to analysis and synthesis, just as the transparency or "transaudition" of a polyphonic composition is. IV. THE COMPARATIVE METHOD Methodical comparison is a ready-made experiment which is still more con- crete than the preceding form of experimentation, which it completes in a useful way. To begin with, we shall compare a first rate piece of poetry with an inferior one in which there is more eloquent prosody than true lyricism; then we shall compare the same first rate piece to a related prose passage.</page><page sequence="13">STRUCTURE AND SUPERSTRUCTURE OF POETRY 287 1. Poetry and prosody It will be instructive to put our Lamartinian couplet side by side with a few lines from Corneille which certainly played a considerable part in suggesting both the thought and form of Lamartine's couplet. For this sententious strain is prominent among the hundreds of reminiscences that have been painstakingly singled out in the work of Lamartine, whose genius inclined to facility in all its forms. Here, first of all, in Corneille's Medea are the "irrational" "Je ne sais quoi" and the irregular "nous force d'aimer". Souvent je ne sais quoi qu'on ne peut exprimer Nous surprend, nous emporte et nous force d'aimer. (Corneille Med1e (1635), Acte II, Sc. 5) (Ofttimes an indefinable something one cannot express surprises us, overwhelms us and forces us to love.) Further, here in Rodogune are "les dmes qui s'attachent", with the same device of the unconscious nescio quid: Ii est des nceuds secrets, il est des sympathies Dont par le doux rapport les dmes assorties S'attachent l'une d l'autre, et se laissent piquer Par ce je ne sais quoi qu'on peut expliquer. (Rodogune, I, 5, r6le de Rodogune) (There are secret knots, there are sympathies By whose gentle affinity assorted souls Are drawn together and let themselves be goaded By that indefinable something that cannot be explained) Perhaps it will be objected that for a fair and searching comparison the three fragments lack a common denomination, chiefly because one is lyrical, that is, destined to be read privately in a soft voice, while the other two are tragic, or expressly destined for public declamation, which is far more stylized (especially in Corneille's time), and also because the one fragment is from the best of Lamartine and the others from the less felicitous work of Corneille. But first of all it is obviously not a question of the exact measurement of quantitative values; it is a question of qualitative preferences and subtle shad- ings; of the esprit de finesse and not of the esprit de gqometrie. In addition, these three fragments are obviously three "purple passages" which were carefully worked over and made the most of by authors and interpreters alike. The actress Clairon felt that the tirade from Rodogune was "more in the pastoral than in the tragic vein". Her rival, the actress Gaussin, declaimed it with "a sensuous grace and ingenuousness", which ought to have seemed completely out of place coming from the mouth of this virago-princess "who demands of her lovers their mother's head", yet this inconsistent interpretation enjoyed great success. These Cornelian sentences are lyric interludes submerged by the current of tragic deeds (and, for that reason they strike a dissonance, ill-prepared</page><page sequence="14">288 CHARLES LALO and badly resolved, in the classical structure of the whole play). Corneille is here seeking to outdo himself. He is aware that his heroes are too often pure "reasoners": the rich theme of the unconscious mystery of "elective affinities" is one that could act as a much-to-be-desired corrective in the work of Corneille; the least he could do was to make his characters say what Racine's are often able to make us feel without their telling us in so many words.6 As to the merits of these lines, the numerous times they have been quoted through the course of years attest to their having been greatly appreciated, at least by certain generations which can make as great a claim for the authority of their judgments as we can for ours. The actress Clairon assures us that the literary circles of her time knew the fragment from Rodogune by heart, in spite of certain absurdities in it which undoubtedly strike us more forcibly today than they did Corneille's audience. "The public", Clairon says, "impatiently waited for this passage and applauded it wildly." Finally, add to all this the fact that the obvious echoes of Corneille in Lamar- tine warrant our putting the passages side by side, and then perhaps our com- parison will be seen to demand our attention for very cogent reasons. Considering the couplet from Medea, let us approach it from the same five points of view we adopted in analyzing the passage from the Harmonies. The disparity in poetic value between Lamartine and Corneille will show up in the comparative analysis of the two works. This methodic parallelism in no way tends to belittle the dramatic genius of the one writer by comparison with the lyric inspiration of the other; for, in the dominion of art, values are divided up into many provinces, each enjoying the right to exist side by side with its neigh- bor. 1. The general meaning has a wider human significance in Corneille. The mysteries of sexual love have always commanded greater attention than those of the love of familiar objects-a kind of love which demonstrates the application of well known laws of habit, the least mysterious laws in all psychology. 2. The affective or unconscious suggestions of Medea are superior for the same reason. The laying bare of a miraculous predestination naturally has more psychological repercussions than an apology for habit: the innate libido normally wins out over accidental associations-associations, which moreover, are grafted onto the libido. 3. Thus far Corneille seems to win out over Lamartine. But the logical- grammatical structures in Corneille reveal a curious lack of counterpointing: while his vocabulary and his alignment of words and ideas are as simple and normal as those of the Harmonies, the abnormal nous force d'aimer is devoid, so to speak, of tonal function. Designating only human love, its unusualness merely draws 6 Corneille's plays, L'Illusion comique and the Suite du Menteur, attribute this uncon- scious predestination to Heaven itself: "Mysticism of passion," "Rousseauistic and ro- mantic worship of nature before its time," Ernest Seilli~re would say. Corneille himself and Voltaire assure us that M6lisse's twelve lines on this theme in the Suite-which was quickly forgotten-remained well known. This appeal to the Beyond is a sort of quest for sublimity ("the sought-after harmony") towards which Corneille's genius tends as naturally as Lamartine's towards elegiac grace or the idyl ("the harmony possessed").</page><page sequence="15">STRUCTURE AND SUPERSTRUCTURE OF POETRY 289 our attention to a banality and that is certainly the opposite of a virtue! This finale is in fact devoid of the half-pantheistic accent with which Lamartine was able to endow his bit of plagiarism, which is far more inspired than its model.7 4. The rhythms of intensity in the first line of the Medea couplet make up a chaotic diversity (2,4,3,3) which clashes with the complete symmetry of the second line (3,3,3,3), while this latter line finds itself borne down upon heavily by three pointlessly choppy verbs and three insignificant nous, which are only parasitic stopgaps repeated to no other end but that of plugging up yawning holes left in the rhythmic structure. 5. The timbres of the vowels and consonants, which in the Harmonies melt into aerial feminine syllables so as to furnish an accompaniment to images of the spiritual life, are, in Medea, harsh sounds that clash with the sense (s, q, p, pr, rpr, rt, f, rc; -vent, quoi qu'on, peut, etc.). As for the four poor lines from Rodogune,-whatever their theatrical success before a refined public may have been during two centuries-it would be cruel to insist upon the clumsiness which our present-day taste finds in them, rightly or wrongly, in keeping with the new requirements of the romantics, the Parnas- sians, the symbolists and the Bremondian purists. The lines contain expressions which are laughable, at least in our eyes (des dmes assorties), outmoded preciosities (noeuds secrets), gratuitously inappropriate terms (doux rapport de noeuds qui assortissent des dmes), ridiculous metaphors or "false relationships" in the poetic counterpoint (des dimes qui se laissent piquer par des je ne sais quoi), grammatical incorrectness unjustified by any aesthetically necessary or adequate reason (dont par le doux rapport), heavy repetition that strives to be oratorical but achieves only empty redundancy (il est des noeuds secrets, il est des sympathies). They constitute a veritable "trust" of all the disharmonies capable of spoiling the beauty of a thought which, in other respects, is genuine and even profound and rich in infinite reverberations-always on condition that "the current flows through" or, in more suitable terms, that "the heart sings" . . . But here it sings rather poorly, so poorly that this alembicated jargon squeaks out in grating syllables that bump along without a trace of musicality and to the most monotonous possible rhythm, wherein rich rhymes above-equally flat in every sense of the word-display their pointless opulence, which in the end leaves us quite cold (-ties, -thies; -iquer, -iquer). Polyphony? No; cacophony! Decidedly, "the current doesn't flow through," "the heart doesn't sing," and technical analysis has been necessary and adequate to make us understand why-just as it has shown us why the miracle takes place in the lines from Lamartine which we have been able to compare with Corneille's. The five-voiced polyphonic concert, which is all euphony in the romantic poet's lines, is all jolt and jangle in those of the classical poet. Between rhythms, I One might add that je ne sais quoi as the subject of a clause, albeit without an article is likewise awkward. (Rodogune might better say: "Ces je ne sais quoi"). The phrase is all the more unfortunate here in that the count of Alexandrine rhythm obliges us to pronounce all the syllables heavily. (Editor's note: Some editions of Corneille read "Ce" and others "Ces.")</page><page sequence="16">290 CHARLES LALO rhymes, sounds; ideas and licences one poet establishes soft harmonies-illu- mined by rare dissonances, carefully prepared and resolved, "saved" by impec- cable handling (instinctive or conscious: the means are of little import); the other poet establishes unjustified dissonances, not to say glaring cacophonies. Cor- neille, faithful to a correct-but of necessity inadequate-prosody, writes elo- quent rhymed prose, well thought-out and strengthened by true and penetrating psychological insight, but having more truth-value than beauty-value; or at the very least, a value more oratorical then poetic. Lamartine instincti;ely weaves a counterpoint in which all the parts conspire to produce the mira1e of Harmony which the title of the collection from which it is taken promises-not without a certain Utopian optimism-to all Creation, and which creative art, at least, achieves in its universe of magnificent play. 2. Poetry and Prose Having compared a splendid piece of poetry with another that is less beautiful' yet its near relation by marriage and even by blood, we may place this miniature masterpiece alongside a prose passage that is not beautiful and that is related, so to speak, only by adoption. An objection to this comparison may be made at the very outset by recent intuitive and purist aesthetics, because according to this mystical school, art and science (or morals) in general, and poetry and prose in particular, have absolutely nothing in common.... A poet, scholar and methodic philosopher, Pius Servien distinguishes two forms of language, irreducible to each other: "the language of science" which admits of several expressions that may be substituted for any one, or of synonyms that express the same thought; and "lyrical language" which admits of only one form, which finds no duplicate anywhere, so that two supposed expressions of the same thought (or which would be the same in non-lyrical prose or in prosody without true poetry) are two radically different thoughts when expressed in poetry or lyrical prose. One might say; in keeping with this line of thought, that every prose sentence is relative, whereas every line of poetry is an absolute; or that there are no metem- psychoses except in prose, and no monadic individualities except in poetry. How far we have come since the days of those 18th century versifiers who saw in poetry (poetry-reason, of course) only embellished prose, or even prose spoiled by "voluntary servitude". Between these two extreme and equally paradoxical points of view, structur al aesthetics seeks to strike a golden mean. According to it, prose and poetry have certain structures in common, and in this they resemble each other; they also involve certain unlike structures and in this they differ from each other. Poetry has more structures than prose, and is thus more artistic. Poetry is always a complex of substructures and admits of strong superstructures. Prose may, pushed to its farthest limit, involve only one structure, that is to say, a single voice without polyphony, and as such it is not artistic; even in the greatest masterpieces, prose only rarely admits of superstructures as highly saturated as those of great poetry. For example, it is difficult to maintain that the semantic and syntactic data</page><page sequence="17">STRUCTURE AND SUPERSTRUCTURE OF POETRY 291 are not the same in both verse and prose, except for alterations which may go so far as to create a poetic language distinct from the vulgar tongue; in which case the problem does not arise. In the measure that the structures of words and sentences are the same in both poetic and prose forms, we recognize them per- fectly. In the unharmonious prose La file de Pasiphae et de Minos it is difficult not to recognize the feelings, the idea and the syntax of Racine's most harmonious line: La file de Minos et de Pasiphae. In both cases the meaning and suggestions are the same, but the rhythms and sounds are not the same. And that suffices to make the line, in the first form, an artistically worthless item of Vital Statistics, and to make it in the second form a masterpiece of "pure poetry," ofttimes lauded by discerning persons from Th6ophile Gautier down to Bremond. Objets inanimes, possedez-vous donc une &amp;me? There you have a perfectly recognizable caricature of Lamartine's beautiful line. Nothing has been changed in the way of ideas, feelings or suggestions; only the Alexandrine rhythm has disappeared, and with it the whole superstructure of poetic counterpointing, which, given free play, constitutes the sheer delight that is the special province of the art of poetry. The whole question of poetic value is, here again, that of the presence, absence, or degrees of harmony, of a verbal and psychic polyphony. Let us return to our three noble poetic selections, but only to imagine by way of contrast a sentence of base prose which will synthesize the three lyric effusions in the learned language of modern psychology. "L'amour classique a la Corneille, en apparence volontaire, et l'amour romantique de la nature fantili~re a la Lamartine, en apparence insexue, sont en veritM deuxformes de la sublima- tion de l'universelle libido, refoulee dans l'inconscient par une censure morale et sociale, qui a sensiblement evoluW d'un si~cle a l'autre." (Classical love, as in Corneille, which is ostensibly voluntary, and the romantic love of familiar nature in Lamartine, which is ostensibly asexual, are as a matter of fact two sublimated forms of the universal libido, repressed in the unconscious by a moral and social censorship which has appreciably evolved from one century to the next.) The explicit meaning of this sentence sets forth the new profound notions of repression, sublimation, censorship and the unconscious. It is far richer in meaning than the extremely vague and well-worn concepts of the "soul" and the "indefinable something" of Corneille and Lamartine. The implicit suggestions of the psychoanalytic terms are much more fruitful or give much more food for thought to any educated person of our time. Nevertheless, this prose is almost completely devoid of aesthetic value, whereas the poetry it speaks about has aesthetic value. In one we have a "will to art", in the other "a will to know." This is because in the counterpointing of the poetry, all the voices are audible and balance each other. While in the psychoanalytic monody a single voice drowns out all the others: the voice of truth. Almost the whole value of this prose is dependent on the value which the reader attributes to psychoanalysis, while almost none of the value in the lines of poetry stems from the truth of spiritualism; it lies entirely in the harmonizing of four or five voices with that of the truth of spiritualism or of the harmonizing of this latter voice with the</page><page sequence="18">292 CHARLES LALO others (for Paul Val6ry has shown that for the writer any one of these voices may act as the cantus firmus which is the origin or inspiration of the poem). To the unyielding opponent of psychoanalysis, the prose statement is only hollow verbalism; remove its errors or absurdities and nothing "worthwhile" will remain. The case of Lamartine's spiritualistic verses is quite the contrary. To the materialist who finds in them only a fiction, there will always remain the fiction itself and the music-that is to say, the heart of its artistic value. The truth-value is in itself non-aesthetic. But do not interpret this to mean that it can never sing its part in the chorus of an authentic work of art; for though it is altogether absent in certain arts, as in pure music (where the right- ness and wrongness of a chord have an altogether different meaning), it forms part and parcel of certain others, such as literature, the theater, pictures and painting. But even in these latter arts, the truth-value is in no way specific; it can be altered, or even when pushed to the farthest limit, vanish altogether in accord with the ideal of surrealism and the so-called "pure" arts. Above all, it exists outside of all art, in the experience of life and in the sciences; it is in these anaesthetic realms that it achieves its full development and takes on a specific value. And it is in this sense that it is fitting to distinguish the true meaning, as against aesthetic and unaesthetic values, of non-aesthetic values. Such is the function of truth in literature. In all prose that does not seek to be "artistic prose", all other interest is subordinated, if not sacrificed, to this value. In the prose statement under consideration, the repetition and opposi- tion of words have a logical, not rhythmic, role (en apparence [twice repeated]- en verit"), if a systematic symmetry of ideas entails a cacophony, this sin, which would be mortal in poetry, is only venial here. If this statement of a psychoanalytic thesis has some slight aesthetic value, it stems almost solely from that economy of means which in mathematics gives "elegance" to certain demonstrations or solutions that are exceptionally concise in a neat and subtle way. Our prose statement has a certain pseudo-harmony to the extent that any addition would be superfluous and the suppression of any one element harmful to the meaning-or at least to its desirable overtones. But this rigor lacks play. Reasoning is not play; whereas all the exhilaration of art is of the order of play; the fully felt delights of freedom, the impulsive movements of a singing heart controlled by the dictates of a technical discipline.8 But this is not the place to go into what makes up the "art of prose": an art cruder than poetry in one sense, subtler in another, and never as purely artistic as poetry, because always less polyphonic. A basic structure made up of rational thought-and exerting too much force constitutes, in poetry, a sort of "para- 8 This "elegance," which is very evident to the esprit de gtometrie (if not to the esprit de finesse), goes to make up practically all the aesthetic value of highly useful formulas and philosophical data that have meanings comparable to the lines of poetry we have studied: "In one sense, all things are filled with soul," said Aristotle; "a landscape is a soul-state," says Amiel. These are highly charged themes based on pre-established Leibnizian har- monies or Baudelairian correspondences, themes rich in suggestions for the thinker, but not rich in artistic content. The value of the "subject" counts for very little in the "art of the fugue," that of its "developments" counts for much more.</page><page sequence="19">STRUCTURE AND SUPERSTRUCTURE OF POETRY 293 structure" which may act to destroy the balance of the superstructure in which poetry actively resides and by means of which it comes to life aesthetically. In the various passages, it is by virtue of the fitness or inappropriateness of their superstructures that Lamartine is able to achieve all the aesthetic values; that Corneille, rich in characters, situations or actions, is poor in lyrical counter- pointing, and that the psychoanalytic summary is abundant in observational and expository values which, though worthwhile in other ways, are in themselves non-aesthetic. V. CONCLUSION To achieve value is to satisfy desire with pleasure, or longing with happiness- or only with the promise of happiness, as Stendhal preferred to put it. All aesthetic enjoyment is the pleasure or happiness afforded by an interplay of specific structuralization, passionately desired by the elect, of no interest at all- or even hostile-to others who are not "endowed". The most spontaneous artistic intuition, as well as the one steeped more and more in reflection, is a vital awareness of the degrees of saturation of technical superstructures, an awareness in which the forces of our creative fancy take cognizance of their freedom while remaining unconscious of the laws which govern them. We have tried to show by concrete example how the analysis of an aesthetic fact, as well as the experiments or comparisons that complete the analysis, leads us automatically to the judgment of the value of this fact. If this analysis of facts could be absolutely complete, it would literally coincide with the judgment of values. We grant that this represents no more than a never-attained limit. But it is an ideal more fruitful than the mystic's sterile contemplation, or than the oh!-and-ah! aesthetics of overly lyrical or overly eloquent critics, who are ever ready to replace a scientific philosophy of art by a more superficially at- tractive, but more vacuous, rhetoric. As long and drawn-out as it is, our "aesthanalysis" certainly does not pretend to be complete. In addition to endless shadings that are more easily felt than articulated, more than one important consideration has been omitted or hardly touched upon. To name a few, there is the relationship between the few lines of poetry and the whole work from which they are taken, between the quoted lines and the non-aesthetic experiences undergone by the writer quite apart from his art; between the writer and his social environment and historical development. We have retained only the most intrinsic data, never failing to recognize that they are necessary but inadequate, giving only a partial idea of the concrete relativity of values in art. We believe it possible that the same methods may be applicable not only to all other kinds of verse, but in addition, mutatis mutandis, to all the techniques of all the arts.</page></plain_text>
