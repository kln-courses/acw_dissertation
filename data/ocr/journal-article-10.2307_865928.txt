<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LITERATURE OF ART Kuwntwissenschaftliche Forschungen. Edited by Otto Pacht. Vol. II. I6o pp. + 24 pl. + 24 ill. Berlin (Frankfurter Verlagsanstalt), R.M.18 The editor of this periodical collection of studies in the science of art history, Dr. Otto Picht, has set a high standard of seriousness and thoroughness before his contributors; and the present volume is fully worthy of its predecessor. Indeed, so wide is the range covered by the seven papers it contains, and so elaborate and philosophic is the treatment of the chosen theme in every case, that a single reviewer can hardly do justice in a short notice to the vast problems here tackled with such intrepid erudition. An indication of the general scope of the articles must suffice. G. Kaschnitz-Weinberg, whose studies of Italic and Roman portraiture are well known, breaks new ground with a remarkable discourse on the esthetic basis of Egyptian sculpture, a subject which, as he rightly observes, has been curiously neglected. He approaches the problem from a psychological point of view. The main concern of the Egyptian sculptor, as he sees it, was to convert the movable and perishable organic substance of the human body into an absolutely spacial- ised concrete fact, exempt from all suggestion of time. 90</page><page sequence="2">The Literature of Art The act of super-mummification is the key to the whole Egyptian conception of form. The statue is so com- pletely a " thing " that it does not even convey any suggestion of mass or weight. The material is not intended to be expressive in itself; it is simply the medium by which the figure is made permanently accessible. Stone is space materialised. This meta- physical rigour does not even demand the collaboration of the living human spectator; Egyptian sculpture is not commemorative, but preservative. This thesis is somewhat exaggerated ; if the sole aim of the sculptor were to provide an effigy of perfect durability and monumentality, there is no real reason why he should have worried about aesthetic values at all. If the function of the statue was simple to exist, but not to be seen, it might just as well have taken a purely abstract form with no human implications at all. But the fact that Egyptian religion was anthropomorphic, and that the posthumous existence of man was regarded as a pro- jection outside time of his temporal passage through this world, inevitably introduces certain analogies from the world of sense into this realm of absolute insensibility. Thus, although ideally the aim of the Egyptian sculptor may have been as Kaschnitz represents it, actually he was unable, being human, to abstract himself completely from the domination of time. For his work exists in this world, and not in some Platonic heaven; and its timelessness has no meaning except in relation to our sense of duration. H. Sedlmayr discusses the architecture of the Justi- nianic period in relation both to antiquity and the Middle Ages, and analyses it as the decisive phase in which the ancient conception of the building as an object situated in space gives way to the medieval conception of the building as a contrivance for enclosing space. These two notions are further illustrated in the horizontal composition of ancient buildings and the vertical composition of medieval ones; and the chief concern of Sedlmayr's paper is to show how this tran- sition was effected by means of the baldacchino-motif. He might have found confirmation of this by observing that the architectural symbol for a building in sixth- century miniature-painting is no longer simply a box but often an actual baldacchino (e.g., in the Rossano Gospels, fol. 8r.). In an interesting analysis of the Florentine Baptistery, K. M. Swoboda discusses the classicising features of its decoration, and points out the respects in which they differ from both Roman and Renaissance work. In relating it to San Miniato and the Badia at Fiesole, he gives the Baptistery the leading place. Basing his chronology mainly on the rather doubtful testimony of Villani that the cross and orb were added to the lantern about I I5o, he infers that the Baptistery was finished substantially in its present form in the first half of the twelfth century, though the interior decoration, and particularly the mosaics in the cupola, belong to the thirteenth. But when we compare it with a purely Romanesque building like the Baptistery at Cremona, which was begun in I1I67, and recollect that San Miniato contains a pavement dated I207, which appears to be about contemporary with the facade, it seems difficult to believe that the main structure of the Baptistery is more than fifty years earlier. As to the classical models which the architect followed, Swoboda has nothing to say ; nor does he compare the Florentine Protorenascence with the Roman school of the thirteenth century, as shown in such works as the fagade of the cathedral at Civita Castellana (I204). O. PAicht obliges us to face at last the formal problems of fifteenth century painting in Western Europe, and distinguishes with great subtlety and skill between the respective attitudes of the Netherlands, Holland and France towards the fundamental task of modern pictorial composition : the projection of the three dimensions of nature on to the two dimensions of the picture-plane. In all cases he begins with the picture-plane as the primary datum, instead of the ideal picture-space which must be assumed as the primary datum of Italian painting. From this he deduces that instead of thinking first of an imaginary space and then considering how to project it on to a plane, the Netherlandish artist thought first of his plane, and the pattern of objects which it would carry, and then projected these back- wards into the imaginary space. Though it is rather difficult for us to visualize such a process, so accustomed are we to the opposite act and so dominated by the idea of vanishing-point perspective as the representational norm, Paicht succeeds in demonstrating that only on this assumption of the picture-plane as primary datum can we understand the principles of such a composition as the Annunciation from the Merode altarpiece. For the Netherlandish artist the picture-surface must be covered with a dense network of shapes related to each other by the contiguity on the plane of their projected contours, not by their spacial relations in the ideal three-dimensional world ; in consequence, the capacity of the picture- space depends directly on the projection-capacity of the picture-surface. In Dutch art, on the other hand, this horror vacui is not nearly so conspicuous ; from an early period the aesthetic uses of empty space are appreciated and exploited. The Dutch painter forms his com- position out of isolated figures and groups; and he unites these by means of a psychological appeal to the spectator. By means of gestures and other dramatic devices the artist takes his audience into his confidence ; the unity is " literary " rather than purely spacial. In France we are invited to observe the fondness for diagonal lines which emphasise at once the picture- space and the picture-surface; this leads Paicht on to the general observation that the French artist tends to think of his composition a priori, and then chooses motifs in nature which can be accommodated to this fore- ordained scheme. He also notes the important part played by the rectangular forms of Renaissance archi- tecture in constructing the framework of a French composition. A fragmentary paper by the late Maria Hirsch is devoted to the late Gothic figure-alphabet by the master E. S., and contains some interesting remarks on the structure of the Gothic letter generally, arguing back to the simple form with the assistance of the elaborated fanciful version. M. Alpatoff discusses at great length and from many points of view the Self-portrait of Poussin in the Louvre. He considers its geometrical basis, its history, and its position in the development of the European likeness. The subject of the last paper, by E. Kaufmann, is Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, an urbanist of the French Revolutionary period and a forerunner of M. Le Corbusier, ROGER HINKS 91</page></plain_text>
