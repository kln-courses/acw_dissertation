The Idea of God in Historical Religions. Much upon which it might be desirable to dwell by way of preliminary, in treating this subject, must be omitted for lack of space. Without introduction, we may come at once to what we may term, as found to such an extent in histor- ical religions, and in human nature itself, THE POLYTIEISTIC TENDENCY. It is an interesting inquiry why polytheism should be so prevalent and so inveterate in the religious history of mankind. The reasons to be given, probably, would be many; some of them common to all men, everywhere, save as instructed and kept by forces higher than any human ones; some peculiar to the several races of men, and found in the surroundings and conditions of their life. I will mention three, which, perhaps, are the principal ones, apart from what is due to the depraved condition of human nature; those "vain imaginations" and that "foolish heart," of which Paul speaks. 1. The first is the necessary conception of a providence in association with the idea itself of God, and the difficulty which the unaided human mind must find in conceiving this providence as exercised in a single divine personality, omni- present and omnipotent. The idea of God involves, essentially, that of human dependence and of divine interposition in the human behalf. Everywhere, in a more or less distinct way, unless it should be in the case of pantheism-and even there we may sometimes trace it-we find the conception of God as that of a Being to be prayed to; a Being whose favor is to be propitiated or whose help is to be sought. Now, we can readily see how difficult it must be for primitive and especially for barbarous races to conceive such a thing as a single infinite person- ality, everywhere active in providence, and everywhere the same one God. Even by those to whom it has been revealed, and whose minds are trained, taught and developed, this truth can be received only as a matter of faith; it cannot be so grasped as to be comprehended. The human mind in its best state, when it con- fronts the thought of a Being infinite in all attributes, everywhere and every- where acting in the same single divine personality, is simply overwhelmed by it. That the average pagan mind should fail to grasp, or even conceive it is no ways surprising: nor that when we meet it in paganism it is chiefly as an esoteric principle, known only to the initiated, or as implied in some of the higher strains of poetry, or dimly apprehended in philosophy. We can readily see, then, how the idea of a Providence, as associated with the idea of God, would in the minds of men incapable of conceiving that of one omni- present and omniscient divine personality, and who had lost, if they ever had it, any revelation of this truth, become degraded to an apprehension of the deity as many, rather than one; how each nation would come to have its own gods; how cities, and towns, and colonies would have their special deities whom they would conceive of as caring for them peculiarly and only; how the family would have its own household gods, and each trade and occupation, each art and faculty, its 162</page><page sequence="2">STUDIES IN ARCHIEOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE RELIGION. divine patron; how the operations of nature would be regarded as similarly caused or cared for, and groves and streams and mountains be made populous with nymphs and dryads, with deities of the wood and deities of the fountain, the river and the hill. That feeling, natural to the human soul, that a divine presence is in some way everywhere and everywhere active, yet incapable of realizing itself in any conception of a single divine personality thus pervasive and efficient, takes refuge in the inventions of polytheism. 2. Another and much more objectionable manifestation of the polytheistic tendency, implying also a reason for the existence of polytheism itself, is seen in anthropomorphic conceptions of deity, these assuming, in process of time, those forms which even among cultivated ancient nations were so mischievous. It does not seem surprising that barbarous or primitive races should find in the idea of God as a purely spiritual being a difficulty much like that just noticed in apprehend- ing him as a single infinite being. Philosophy might at least approach this con- ception, but the popular mind even in peoples comparatively cultivated would be, left to itself, in a great measure incapable of it. Of course, the idea of the unseen, the supernatural, may be said to be in some sense innate with all men; but when such a mind as we are supposing attempts to body forth this idea, and assign to the supernatural being attributes and activities, the man almost inevit- ably makes himself the model of his deity. Just in the same way as he sees men individualized and multiplied, he individualizes and multiplies his gods, assigning to them, naturally, passions and propensities after the pattern of his own. 3. The third cause which I will mention is the tendency among certain races, especially in a primitive or barbarous condition, to deify force, and all manifesta- tions of phenomena which they cannot understand. We are familiar, I dare say, with instances in which savages, when visited by civilized men, and shown some object to them surprising and incomprehensible, imagine something supernatural in it, and fall upon their knees to worship it. With races yet in their childhood, and who perhaps remain in their childhood for centuries, emotions of wonder, the sensations produced by novelty, by the presence of what is vast, or mighty, or delightful, do not become dulled by familiarity, or robbed of every element of sur- prise, or awe, or pleasure by knowing too much of what they are, and how they are caused. The fact may help explain for us that tepdency, seen especially among certain races, amidst surroundings that appeal powerfully to the imagina- tions and to every sense of the beautiful or the sublime, to deify, or rather asso- ciate with the idea of deity all striking manifestations of force, all remarkable phenomena, especially if they be of that kind which recur regularly, and so suggest some operation of intelligent power. Such are the heavenly bodies; such the sky itself, and the cloud and storm, interposing their dark masses, and so made to seem a power hostile to men, since they hide from human view that divine heaven which in its serenity, with the bright sun or moon irradiating it, seems like a propitious and protecting divinity. So with earthquake, and thunder; so with the milder processes of nature; so with the seasons in their coming and going; so with the earth itself, the divine mother, and with her beautiful children, the greens and blooms that delight the eye and the heart. It is only a misapplied science that sees nothing divine in all this; but it is the ignorant fancy of the utterly untaught which assigns to each phenomenon its divinity, and deifies wonder, and beauty, and power. 163</page><page sequence="3">THE OLD TESTAMENT STUDENT. CONTESTED BY A MONOTIEISTIC PRINCIPLE. But now, let us go on from this to notice one fact which has great significance and importance in this connection. This is the manner in which this universal polytheism in pagan religion is contested by, and more or less influenced by, a monotheistic principle. The phenomena brought to light, in this connection, in the study of compa- rative religion, are eminently deserving of attention, yet should be examined witli discrimination and judgment. We must be careful, while recognizing them as really important, not to infer too much from them. The distinction which Prof. Max Miiller makes here seems well founded. He invents a word, "henotheism," -from the two Greek words meaning "one" and " God "-in order to express it. Monotheism will be, by this method of discrimination, the recognition of one only ,God, one and the same, ever and everywhere. Henotheism is the recognition of one God at a time; that is to say, the mention in ancient literatures and inscrip- tions, and the adoration in worship, sometimes of one deity, sometimes of another, as the one, or at least the supreme, God. For instance, when Ebers quotes from a papyrus roll preserved at Bulaq, in Egypt, such words as these, addressed to the God Amon, "One only art thou, thou Creator of beings: And thou only makest all that is created;" and again, "He is one only. Alone, without equal; Dwelling alone in the holiest of holies," it seems like monotheism of the most unmistakable sort. We almost hear the inspired man himself speaking of the true God as "dwelling in light, which no man can approach unto." And in a certain way it is a kind of monotheism, as I shall notice presently. But in the mean time it should be mentioned that upon a statue of a goddess, the goddess Neith, corresponding to the Greek Athene, is to be read the following inscription, " I am the All, the Past, the Present, and the Future, my veil has no mortal yet lifted;"-which seems to be almost or quite a claim, on the part of this goddess, to the attributes of a sole deity. The god Ra, also, is sometimes spoken of as " the good god," "the chief of all the gods," "the ancient of heaven," "the lord of all existences," " the support of all things." Rawlinson explains these peculiarities, in a measure, when he says, "In the solemn hymns and chants, which were composed by the priests to be used in the various festi- vals, the god who is for the time addressed receives all the titles of honor, and even has the names of other gods freely assigned to him, as being in some sort identical with them." Like things might be said of tile deities acknowledged by the Assyrians and Babylonians. Now it is Anu. now it is Hea, and now it is Bel, now the Sun and now the Moon, that is made to bear titles expressive of the highest attributes of divinity. Of the Veda Max Miiller observes how in it " one god after another is invoked. For the time being all that can be said of a divine being is ascribed to him. The poet, while addressing him, seems hardly to know of any other gods." Yet he adds how "in the same collection of hymns, sometimes even in the the same hymn, other gods are mentioned, and tley also are truly divine, truly independent, or it may be supreme. The vision of the worshipper seems to change suddenly, and the same poet who at one moment saw nothing but the sun, as the ruler of heaven and earth, now sees heaven and earth as the father and mother of the sun, and of all the gods." 164</page><page sequence="4">STUDIES IN ARCHIEOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE RELIGION. These instances may sufficiently illustrate the feature of ancient religions to which I am referring. The explanation probably is to be found, partly in the fact that, especially in Egypt, certain deities were recognized in certain districts as the supreme object of worship, and others in other districts. By the people of each of these districts or provinces the deity thus worshipped would be addressed in language implying the attributes of exclusive divinity. Such expressions, found alone, might seem like the language of monotheism, and so might be misleading, till the fact to which I refer began to receive attention. Another explanation of the peculiarity which has suggested the term " heno- theism" is, as Prof. Max liiller himself points out, that the language in question is often the language of poetry, and hyperbole. We need to be cautious, there- fore, when we meet with language of the kind in question, that we do not give to it meanings, or draw from it inferences, not strictly warranted. The monotheistic principle in these religions reveals itself in other ways, which I will now notice. ITS MANIFESTATIONS. 1. First, I may say that henotheism itself, while as I have shown not to be con- founded with monotheism, nevertheless in a certain vague and dim way does after all imply the monotheistic principle. When at one time one deity, at another time another, is addressed in terms which imply a sole divinity, such an ascription seems to be prompted by some suggestion, however derived, that the worship of God, or the worship of a god, ought to be worship of him alone. The mind does not hold fast to this conviction, if I may term it so, in its application to wor- ship of any one deity, but in changed circumstances transfers it to another. It is perhaps not conscious to itself of anything monotheistic in its conception, and still, a monotheistic principle seems to be back of all, and to assert itself, though most imperfectly, in this way. 2. In the next place, there seems to be in most of the cultivated old religions the recognition, somewhat obscure yet real, of an original, self-existent divinity, which is the source of all divinity. The idea is expressed in the phrase "father of the gods." We are familiar with this phrase, in the mythology of the Greeks and the Latins, as applied to the Zeus of the one and the Jove of the other. Mr. Gladstone mentions of the Zeus of Homer, how his "will is worked out by other divine agents, themselves exercising their personal freedom, but bringing about the purposes of a counsel higher and larger than their own," and then adds, "This counsel has its back-ground and its ultimate root in pure deity, and for pure deity Zeus is often a synonym in Homer." Of the mythological system of Homer he says, that a portion of it " reveals a primitive basis of monotheism, and ideas in connection with it which seem to defy explanation, except when we com- pare them with the most ancient Hebrew traditions." In the Latin conception of Jupiter, or Jove;, Mr. Rawlinson believes there must have been "a latent mon- otheism," though less distinct than in that of Zeus among the Greeks, the Latin Jupiter being a later conception than that of the Greek Zeus, and so being farther removed from the original mythological source. Among the Babylonians a like place was filled by the god 11, or Ra, who, as the same writer says, appears as " a somewhat shadowy being. There is a vague- ness," he adds "about the name itself, which means simply 'god,' and can scarcely be said to connote any particular attribute. The Babylonians never rep- resent his form, and they frequently omit him from lists which seem to contain 165</page><page sequence="5">THE OLD TESTAMENT STUDENT. all the other principal gods. Yet he was," says this writer, "certainly regarded as the head of the pantheon." The resemblance of this name, II, to the Hebrew El is evident. It seems to be, therefore, a conception of divinity, as such, and might with some good reason be regarded as the relic of an original idea of God purely monotheistic. The deity among the Egyptians who filled a like place, we find sometimes spoken of as Amon, sometimes as Ra. From Sir Gardner Wilkinson's "Ancient Egyptians," in his notice of this subject, I quote these sentences, " The funda- mental doctrine [among the Egyptians] was the unity of the deity; but the unity was not represented, and he was known by a sentence, or an idea, being, as Iamblichus says, 'worshipped in silence.' But the attributes of that Being were represented under positive forms; and hence arose a multiplicity of gods, that engendered idolatry, and caused a total misconception of the real nature of the deity in the minds of all who were nQt admitted to a knowledge of the truth through the mysteries." A like feature appears in other ancient religions, in one at least of which it would seem that originally, and for a considerable time, those names which at last came to denote distinct gods, were really names of one and the same God; just as in Scripture, we find the names God, Jehovah, or Lord, the Almighty, the Most IIigh, and others, used to indicate one and the same divine being. The instance of what seems like this just alluded to is that of the Phoenicians. The number of deities in the Phoenician pantheon was remarkably small. "If we make a collection," says Rawlinson, " of the divine names in use either iri Phoe- nicia proper or in the Phoenician colonies, we shall find that altogether they do not amount to twenty." This is in singular contrast with the hundreds of deities acknowledged by the Egyptians, the throng of them adored by the Sanskrit Aryans, and the thousands acknowledged by the Greeks and Romans. Then when we come to note the names themselves, and their meanings, of the chief Phoenician deities, we cannot but be struck with the suggestion that they must have been, many of them, perhaps nearly all, names originally of one and the same being. Take these, for example: Baal, Melkarth, Moloch, Adonis, El, Eliun, Shamas, Sadyk. Now, two of these names, El and Eliun, we find united in that one divine name, translated " Most High God," which is used in the four- teenth chapter of Genesis, where we are told how Melchizedek, "priest of the Most High God," met Abram, as he returned victorious from his battle with the Kings of the East. The Hebrew name is El-Elion. This one name becomes two in Phcenician use. Is it too much to infer that however it may have been later, the two names were with them also originally one ? Notice, again, Mel- karth and Moloch, both of them, it should seem, originally identical with the Hebrew Melek, or king. In a like way we may compare Adonis with Adonai, and Sadyk with Zedek, the just, the righteous one; an element, also, in the name Mel- chizedek. A study of these names seems to give us a glimpse backward into the times when Abram dwelt in tents on the plains of Mamre, when Melchizedek reigned as king of Salem, serving at the same time as " priest of the Most High God," and when the Pheenicians were founding cities along the Mediterranean coast, and building ships in whose voyages-distant and adventurous for those times-they seem to have succeeded the Chaldseans as leaders of the world's com- merce. With these, at any rate with Abram and Melchizedek, that knowledge of the one God which had become so much obscured elsewhere still remained. It 166</page><page sequence="6">STUDIES IN ARCH.EOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE RELIGION. seems almost certain that the religion of the Phoenicians was originally in a like way monotheistic; names of the one God becoming at last interpreted as names of distinct deities, whose worship, in that process of depravation which polytheism always discloses, becomes at last cruel and brutal, as in the case of Moloch, or licentious, as in that of Ashtoreth. And while such appears to be true of this one instance, is it not strongly suggestive of what may also have been true in others ? 3. But perhaps the most decided evidence of a monotheistic principle con- testing that of polytheism, or at least surviving in spite of it, is the fact that in nearly all these religions an esoteric monotheistic doctrine seems to have been taught to those initiated in the mysteries, while it gets expression also in the higher forms of literature, and in philosophy. Our failing space will not allow much illustration of the point. That, however, polytheism was the religion of the people, and much less so of the cultivated and the learned; that monotheism was an esoteric principle with the priesthood of such nations as the Egyptians, and the original idea of God, never entirely lost, in the case of such as the Chinese; that alike in the philosophy and in the poetry of the Greeks monotheistic ideas often appear, as if protesting against the absurd doctrine of "gods many and lords many "-these are facts well known. They testify, distinctly, to a survival of the monotheistic principle, in however vague a way, and reveal a tendency even in cultivated paganism to rest back ultimately upon that idea of God which alone commends itself to the human intelligence. The passage in Aratus, to which Paul especially refers in his sermon on Mars Hill, may be quoted here-Aratus being by no means the only instance among Greek poets, as Paul's language itself implies-as illustrating the point we make, although very likely familiar to many readers. "With Zeus begin we-let no mortal voice Leave Zeus unpraised. Zeus flls the hearts of men, The streets, the marts,-Zeus fills the sea, the shores, The harbors-everywhere we live in Zbus. We are his offspring too: friendly to man, He gives prognostics; sets men to their toil By need of daily bread; tells when the land Must be upturned by plowshare or by spade- What time to plant the olive or the vine- What time to fling on earth the golden grain. For he it was who scattered o'er the sky The shining stars, and fixed them where they are- Provided constellations through the year, To mark the seasons in their changeless course. Therefore men worship him-the First the Last- Their Father-Wonderful-their Help and Shield." One can hardly believe that these lines are not the production of a Christian poet in some moment of devout inspiration. One writer in quoting them, notes the correspondence of some parts of the language used with familiar phraseology of the Scriptures in dealing with the same high theme;-the words " everywhere we live in Zeus," with Paul's-" in him we live, and move, and have our being;" what is said of the constellations and the seasons, with what is said in the first of Genesis of the heavenly bodies as ruling the year; the epithet " Wonderful" with the well known passage in Isaiah; "First and Last" with the sublime ascription of eternity used of God in the Apocalypse; and the words " Help and Shield" with various places in the Psalms. It is entirely a mistake to assume that the ancient polytheisms were hopelessly dark upon this subject. God has 167</page><page sequence="7">THE OLD TESTAMENT STUDENT. never, in any of these religions, as Paul says, left himself wholly without a witness. DUALISM. The modern representatives of the ancient Iranian, or Zoroastrian faith are the Parsees of India. They are as thoroughly monotheistic in their religion as are the Mohammedans themselves. There have been periods in the history of their religion when polytheistic elements seem to have been in a measure revealed. Late discoveries in inscriptions on monuments have led some writers to hold that Cyrus himself was a polytheist, in spite of those utterances of his in Old Testa- ment history which read so much like utterances of a believer in the very God of Israel himself. It is still an open question whether the testimony of the inscrip- tions may not be susceptible of another interpretation than that recently given to it. Iowever this may be, there are other inscriptions, alike of Cyrus and of Darius, which recognize but the one God, Ormazd, and pay to him homage and gratitude in forms such as the Christian or the Jew might use in speaking of, or in addressing, Jehovah himself. If we turn to that ancient Iranian scripture, the Zend-Avesta, great as is the power attributed to the mighty evil spirit, Angra- Mainyu, the author of all evil, and the enemy of Ahura-Mazda, the author and promoter of all good, one is ever in doubt, after all, whether the idea of God there ,found, though called dualistic, is so really. What seems to be true is that the Zoroastrian faith was originally, as it is now, monotheistic; that in dealing with the awful problem of evil in the universe those who held this faith could imagine no other origin for it than that of a malign power hostile to the good deity and mak- ing war upon him, and all good beings; that in the conception of this evil power, as a personality, with the consciousness how mighty the agent of such mischief must be, the idea of him approached, if it did not sometimes reach that of a deity equal in power with the beneficient Ahura-Mazda himself; but that, in reality, the monotheistic idea, holding the good deity as alone really divine, not only sur- vived, but ultimately gained the mastery, as now we see in the case of the Parsees. PANTHEISM. Only a word is allowable on this part of the subject. The pantheistic relig- ions are Brahmanism and Buddhism-so far as Buddhism can be said to involve any idea of God at all. In the view of some the esoteric teaching of the Egyptian priests was also pantheistic. Wherever found, the root of it cannot be said to be polytheism, but rather monotheism,-the one divine being coming to be viewed as a universal essence, rather than as a personality. Out of it polytheism may grow, as in fact it has done in the case of the IIindu idolatries. If God is the All, as Brahmanism teaches, he is in each; that is to say, you may select what you please of the things seen as representing the Unseen, and persuade yourself that in worshipping the one you worship the other. Or you may make images, idols of wood or stone, as representing some conception of that divinity which you view as in itself so incomprehensible; these also you may worship. Upon this idea of God the whole system of Brahmanism with its oppressive caste, its idols and idol temples for the ignorant masses and its mystic philosophy for the instructed few, seems to be built. Buddhism, as nearly as can be true of anything called a relig- ion, is " without God," and in a degree true of it almost in a literal sense, "has no hope." 168</page><page sequence="8">STUDIES IN ARCHIEOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE RELIGION. A FEW POINTS OF BRIEF SUMMARY. 1. The first is, how ineradicable, so far as the mind of man is concerned, the idea of God seems to be. Even in the religion last named some trace of it appears to survive. As for the rest, not only is the idea of God the root-idea, but it is the controlling one, serving, in each religion, more than any other element to give it character and determine its effect. 2. It is very remarkable how persistent, and how impossible of entire eradi- cation is the monotheistic idea of God. 3. But then, thirdly, the view so far taken makes it clear that this idea of God in its purity, could have been preserved in the world no otherwise than by the method which divine wisdom chose. It certainly never has been. We may say of even Mohammedanism that it could never have existed had there been no Juda- ism and no Christianity. Of this no one familiar with the life of Mohammed, or with the Koran itself, needs to be assured. As to Zoroastrianism, nearly as that religion approaches to a true idea of God, and based as it seems to have been upon original monotheism-its adherents could not deal with the vast mystery of good and evil in the universe without a resort to expedients which corrupted the orig- inal monotheism into a dualism; while in a later period, the Magians with their fire worship and their oppressive hierarchy, transformed it still more for the worse. Then, as to the other religions, monotheism, as an esoteric faith, is seen not to hinder even those who held it from practicing and teaching the worst idolatries. Men left to themselves do not "retain God in their knowledge." Paul's state- ment on this subject is confirmed by the history of all religions. 4. Lastly, if we inquire for the reason why the monotheistic principle, never- theless, struggles as we have seen against the polytheistic tendency in all pagan religions, even, I suppose that these two answers may be made: (1) That God has given to the very nature of man a principle which scarcely the most degrading idolatry can quite destroy, which is in man a witness to himself, and to which the truth of religion when it comes always makes appeal. This witness in man is not to the existence of a god, but of God. It involves the true idea of God, com- ing into action as the mind is made more intelligent, and protesting, in every cultivated mind, especially, against such manifest absurdities as are found in all idolatry and in all mythology. (2) Then, secondly, I think the answer ought to be that the absolutely primitive religion, that from which all others have, nearly, or remotely, sprung, was a true religion, with a true idea of God. Man, in his original state having had this true faith, with that in his nature which recognizes and approves it, has, save in his lowest conditions of savagery retained some traces of it; or at least found it impossible to rid himself of it wholly. The two causes have wrought together. The original revelation authenticated this principle in man's nature and inwove the doctrine with the early history of the race. The inborn principle, ineradicable and efficient, preserved the doctrine, at least, in traces and fragments, in spite of a thousand hostile tendencies, even after the revelation was lost. 169</page></plain_text>
