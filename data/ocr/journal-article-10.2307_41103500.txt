BOOK GREW OUT OF A LATE 1990S brain-storming session by several members of the Alberta Archaeologi- cal Society, who, in recognition of the approaching bimillennial year, decided to take stock of the Province's archae- ology, particularly in respect to its last two thousand years. Most of the twelve papers in this volume make solid con- tributions to that goal. However, as the book developed, the organizers decided to widen its temporal scope, ostensibly to acknowledge the difficulty in dating sites containing rock art, tipi rings, and/ or stone alignments. As a result they included one paper that is well outside the time frame shared by the rest - a report on Early Precontact Period mate- rial from northern Alberta. In the hope that a group of scholarly essays could be made accessible to a wide reader- ship, the editors have tried to minimize jargon and have added a glossary. One final qualification is that the book deals exclusively with the archaeology of Abo- riginal peoples. Within these qualifications, the cov- erage is diverse and interesting. Alwynne Beaudoin provides a short course on climate and landscape during the last 2,000 years. Her presentation of con- cepts, data, interpretive problems, and summary results makes rewarding read- ing. Heinz Pyszczyk undertakes a survey of opinion and possibilities respecting the kinds of propulsion systems used for pointed projectiles in ancient Alberta. Although he comes to no conclusions, the chapter does improve one's appreci- ation for the issues involved. Trevor Peck and Caroline Hudecek-Cuffe review the last 2,000 years of Alberta's cultural his- torical sequence. The result is readable and familiar (except for the renaming of the Late Side-Notched Series as the Cayley Series) . Many papers focus on specific site or feature types. Gerald Oetelaar examines the development of tipi ring archaeol- ogy. His overview revitalizes a subject that some have been inclined to dismiss as unworthy of attention. Dale Walde and David Meyer attempt the first major reassessment of Alberta ceramics in 30 years. Their considerably revised classifi- cation is laden with ideas, which I think will advance the subject. Michael Klassen provides a survey of rock art. Building on the approach developed in Plains Indian Rock Art (Keyser and Klassen 2001), he supplies greater detail for the Alberta situation and concludes with an emphasis on the interpretive con- nection to spectacular landscapes. John Dormaar speculates that vision quest sites were deliberately located at places Canadian Journal of Archaeology/Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 28: 370-372(2004)</page><page sequence="2">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBERTA: A VIEW FROM THE NEW MILLENNIUM • 371 where preindustrialized people could feel the power (magnetic vibrations) of the land. His notion of geomagnetic spirituality is well argued; it certainly stretches one's imagination. Jack Brink, Kristine Wright-Fedyniak, and Dean Wetzel do a thorough review of some common, but little-studied feature types, namely rock cairns and certain stone alignments. Their study reveals a complex set of phenomena that, in spite of archaeological shortcomings, has a richer interpretive potential than many thought possible. Rod Vickers surveys Napi figures, a particular grouping of male anthropomorphic boulder effigies, and concludes that their age, author- ship, and original significance cannot be resolved with confidence. I suspect that it might have been more illuminating to examine all anthropomorphic boulder effigies in the Northern Plains, or at least all male forms. For his contribution, John Ives pres- ents a fascinating model of southern Plains Apachean origins in Subarctic Alberta, including timing and motiva- tions for migration and how archae- ologists might seek relevant evidence in the northern Plains record. The model is an elegant one. Nonetheless, the archaeological evidence that would support it may be more visible than Ives believes. For example, unmistak- able traces of northern Woodland people living on the northern Plains at approximately the right time have been recovered at the Sjovold site in south- central Saskatchewan (Dyck and Morían 1995:203-232). Nancy Saxberg and Brian Reeves provide a study of early Holocene occu- pations in the oil sands region of north- eastern Alberta. The authors define four new Paleoindian complexes based on a combination of stone tool analysis, typological cross-dating, and landscape history - a noteworthy result after years of development-driven archaeology in the area. Finally, Eldon Yellowhorn fol- lows a new pathway into ancient Black- foot history by blending mythology, ethnohistory, and archaeology with First Nations cultural perspectives. The topics he selected are the traditions of cultivat- ing tobacco and making earthenware, and the results, especially in respect to tobacco, are intriguing. What do these papers tell us about the state of Alberta archaeology? The editors leave readers to decipher this for themselves, although they do provide two clues. In their preface, they say that an assessment was much needed and that Alberta Archaeology: A View from the New Millennium is the first major review since publication of the popular work The First Albertans: An Archaeological Search (Helgason 1987) and the more scholarly Alberta Archaeology: Prospect and Retrospect (Moore 1981). Even with these reference points, however, the present state of Alberta archaeology will not be clear to most readers. Had the editors written an introduction to the book, their analysis might have included some of the follow- ing observations. For example, the 2003 volume shows evidence for continuity, growth, and change. One measure of this is in the personnel involved. Of the 17 authors in this volume, only three (Reeves, Brink and Ives) were contribu- tors to the 1981 book, while five (Ives, Beaudoin, Brink, Pyszczyk, and Vickers) were advisors to the 1987 volume, mean- ing that most of the players are new. Another measure might be the subjects covered, and here the best comparison is probably with the eclectic 1981 volume. This shows continuity in six major areas of interest: paleoenvironmental studies, stone alignments, rock art, ethnohistory, Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 28 (2004)</page><page sequence="3">372 • DYCK the need for more archaeology in the boreal forest, and the need for better dissemination of archaeological results to the general public. However, the 2003 compendium also eschews several 1981 interests, specifically in respect to the archaeology of non-Aboriginal sites, regulatory archaeology, the history of archaeology, and the perceived strengths and shortcomings of current practice. In 1981, authors were quite conscious of being in an early, fact-gathering stage of Alberta's archaeology. They yearned for a time when they would be able to provide more reliable syntheses. By 2003, the authors of this volume are still concerned with acquiring more data, but it is now evident that they are work- ing with a much more robust data base, which permits them to pursue more specific questions with greater depth and sophistication. In 1981, the most sig- nificant threat perceived for archaeology was the imminent destruction of in situ archaeological resources. By 2003, the destruction of archaeological resources was no longer a topical issue. Its equal in recent years has been the objections to archaeology expressed by many Aborigi- nal people. This subject has received much attention from the media, archae- ologists, and governments, and I think it is fair to say that archaeologists are anxious to find a workable accommoda- tion. The concluding paper in the 2003 volume offers the most intellectually sat- isfying proposition I've seen to date. On other matters, in an era of reduced publication of archaeological results it is refreshing to see the up-to- date summaries offered by this book (even though most are marred by typo- graphical and layout errors). It is also gratifying to see increased attention to various kinds of feature analysis, which I think will build a bridge to deeper understanding. Creative thinking and discovery is also evident, both on broad issues such as material/environmental histories and classifications, and on ques- tions such as Athapaskan migrations and Blackfoot cultivation of tobacco. Thus, on the basis of papers in this book, I would conclude that Alberta archaeol- ogy, particularly in respect to Aboriginal subject matter, is alive and well. REFERENCES CITED Dyck, I., and R.E.
