<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW, LXXXI, Nos. 1-2 (July-October, 1990) 219-222 NEUSNER'S THE INCARNATION OF GOD* Jacob Neusner, unquestionably the generation's most prolific writer on the history of formative Judaism, has undertaken an analysis of one of the most important and complex subjects in Jewish religious thought in his book The Incarnation of God. Neusner is to be given credit for dealing in a systematic way with a topic that has been long ignored by scholars writing on rabbinic theology. To be sure, scholars in the past have discussed the role and place of anthropo- morphism in rabbinic sources, but it has been many years since any scholar has sought to investigate the matter of incarnation in a thorough or comprehensive way. Neusner has set out to fill that scholarly lacuna. In characteristic fashion Neusner examines the notion of divine incarnation as it emerges from the enormous body of rabbinic literature, displaying once again his supreme skill in organization and classification. The plan of the book is simple enough: Neusner sets out the problem, states his thesis, provides the conceptual model which he will use to analyze the material, and applies that model to the rabbinic literature of the formative period (i.e., from the Mishnah to the Baby- lonian Talmud) arranged in chronological order according to the assumed dates of redaction. Part 1 is principally dedicated to the "category-formation and the classification of the evidence," while parts 2-4 represent Neusner's systematic application of the methodological apparatus to the literary sources, culminating with part 5, which is an explication of how the sages of the Babylonian Talmud- the final stage in the formation of the canon of the Judaism of the dual-Torah (Written and Oral)-portrayed God in incarnational terms. The problem that Neusner examines is clearly central to the Jewish understand- ing of man as well as of God, religious anthropology as well as theology. As Neusner tells the reader in the preface, "If we wish to know how a Judaic system at its foundations defines its way of life, it must follow that we do well to translate the details of the here and now into the portrait of humanity 'after our likeness' and of divinity: the personality of God" (p. x). The personality of God, Neusner goes on to demonstrate, involves in the case of Judaism, especially as expressed in the Babylonian Talmud, a notion of incarnation. But what does Neusner mean when he uses the word "incarnation"? Neusner begins chapter 1 with the following programmatic statement: "Anthropomorphism forms the genus of which incarna- tion constitutes a species" (p. 11). To understand his use of incarnation, therefore, one must understand his use of anthropomorphism. "Anthropomorphism denotes forming religious concepts and ideas in human terms, in accord with the shapes * Jacob Neusner. The Incarnation of God: The Character of Divinity in Formative Judaism.

Incarnation, the speciation of that genus, means "the representation of God in the flesh, as corporeal, consubstantial in emotion and virtue with human beings, and sharing in the modes and means of action carried out by mortals" (p. 12). Neusner immediately repeats this characterization in somewhat different terms: "When God is represented in corporeal form, with arms, legs, cheeks, and so on, or is assigned emotions out of the repertoire of human feelings, attitudes, and virtues, or is portrayed as doing things human beings do in exactly the ways in which mortals do these deeds, such as kick, butt, laugh, clap hands, and the like, then we have a case of the incarnation of God" (ibid.). I shall return at the end of this review to this definition of incarnation, but for now it will suffice to say that incarnation, according to Neusner's usage in this book, is really a mode of representation of God in human terms rather than a statement about God's adopting or assuming a physical form in any ontological way. Neusner sets out to examine the notion of divine incarnation-as defined in the preceding paragraph-by applying a fourfold classification: (1) God as premise; (2) God as presence; (3) God as person; (4) God as personality of a particular nature. These categories, says Neusner, represent the "four dimensions of God, the measures by which we grasp the character of divinity in the Judaism under study" (p. 26). (1) God as premise entails the belief in God as creator of the world and revealer of the Torah to Israel. (2) God as presence entails the intervention of God in the here and now with reference to a particular case. (3) God as person involves the portrait of God who is attentive to specific cases and details, a God who responds and is thus a person. (4) God as personality, the final stage, is the God that emerges as a full-blown character, such that God is given corporeal traits, both physical and emotional. By applying this fourfold classification to the various documents of formative rabbinic Judaism, to wit, the Mishnah, Tosefta, Sifra on Leviticus, Sifre on Numbers and Deuteronomy, the tractate Avot, the Palestinian Talmud, Genesis Rabbah, Leviticus Rabbah, Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana, the Avot According to R. Nathan, and the Babylonian Talmud, Neusner is led to the conclusion that only in the later stages of the formative history of rabbinic Judaism does God emerge as a full personality. There is thus a gradually increased personification of God in concrete terms, culminating in the Babylonian Talmud, where the notion of divine incarnation receives its most detailed narrative expression. "Through the unfolding canon of formative Judaism the representation of God in incarnate form and with a fully displayed personality emerged only in the final document, the Bavli. God figures in the canon of the Judaism of the dual Torah as premise, presence, person, and at the end, personality" (p. 19). Neusner readily acknowl- edges that the portrayal of God in human terms did not begin with the Babylonian Talmud. Nevertheless, the full development of the idea that God is in the image of man-a corollary to the biblical notion that man is created in the image of God- into the depiction of God as personality, as represented in detailed narratives, did</page><page sequence="3">NEUSNER'S THE INCARNATION OF GOD-WOLFSON 221 not occur in the documents produced in the Land of Israel but only in the Babylonian Talmud. Neusner suggests that this was due to the challenge of Christianity, which prevented the earlier documents from following the inner logic of the idea of the incarnate God. That is, given the Christological notion of Jesus as the incarnation of God, the incarnation of God proved to be problematic for the Palestinian rabbinic authorities, who consequently restricted their own repre- sentation of God in human traits. Only in Iranian Babylonia, with no immediate threat of Christianity, could the rabbis develop the notion of God's personality (see pp. 166, 194-197). With respect to the notion of divine incarnation in the Babylonian Talmud, Neusner outlines several categories in which this is especially operative: the physical attributes of God, the emotional attitudes of God, the social attributes of God, God as sage, and God in his special and highly personal relationship to Israel. Indeed, the incarnation of God "culminates in the portrait of God as Israel's counterpart, trait by trait, and in all relationships: God unique in heaven and Israel unique on earth, the one like the other and matched only by the other-and both finding ultimate embodiment in the sage" (pp. 194-195). With this the circle is completed: the Bible declares in the opening chapter of Genesis that man is made in the image of God; the rabbinic genius was such that God is portrayed in the image of man, and particularly the ideal man of the rabbinic academy, viz., the sage. The notion of divine incarnation in the crowning work of rabbinic thought-the Babylonian Talmud-results in the representation of God in the image of the sage. In that sense the process of the incarnation of God, reaching its fruition in the aggadah of the Babylonian Talmud is a "rebibliciza- tion" of the portrayal of God in Judaism (see p. 29). Neusner's work is extremely readable, given the author's clear and lucid manner of presentation. He has chosen as his focus a critical theme in religious thought which is one of the cornerstones of Judaism as well. Some of the questions that could be raised in a critical review of the book are larger questions that touch upon Neusner's general hermeneutical assumptions about orality, literary docu- ments, and the transmission of religious traditions. This type of inquiry I will leave aside in the present context. One point that I would like to raise, however, concerns the very term "incarnation" which Neusner's book purports to study in detail. It is clear that for Neusner incarnation really amounts to a mode of representation of God in human terms. I have already noted this at the outset, but let me cite another passage which well captures Neusner's usage: "God's physical traits and attributes are represented as identical to those of a human being. That is why the character of the divinity may accurately be represented as incarnational: God in the flesh, God represented as a person consubstantial in indicative physical traits with the human being" (p. 166). One might ask, does this really amount to a doctrine of incarnation? It seems to me that the representation of God in human terms, which Neusner has documented in a meticulous fashion, is an example of anthropomorphism and not incarnation. The latter, I think, should be used in a</page><page sequence="4">222 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW more circumscribed way to refer to a doctrine of God who assumes the corporeal substance of man. A convenient definition has recently been provided by Manabu Waida in the Encyclopedia of Religion (7:156), s.v. "incarnation": "The term incarnation is broadly defined here as the act or state of assuming a physical body ... by a nonphysical entity." It is in this sense that incarnation figures prominently as one of the central dogmas of formative Christianity: Jesus is said to be God incarnate in the flesh. This is not simply a matter of representing God as such, but the belief that God takes on the form of a physical body in this particular person. It would appear that Neusner himself is aware of this when he states in the opening pages of the first chapter that a distinguishing feature of incarnation is the "conviction that God personally takes human form, adopts a human personality" (p. 12). A careful reading of his book proves, however, that for him, at least as far as the Jewish sources go, God's taking on a human form or adopting a human personality is a representational mode. Incarnation, however, implies more than that: God becomes a particular person in the flesh. It may be said that incarnation is an ontological category and not merely an epistemological one, i.e., it is a question of God's being and not simply how we know God or how God is represented. What Neusner has provided us with in this book is a fresh and important study of the various anthropomorphic representations of God in rabbinic sources of the formative period. It remains to be seen, however, if the rabbis actually did have a doctrine of incarnation in the more exact sense of that term. New York University ELLIOT R. WOLFSON</page></plain_text>
