<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Encounter With Fackenheim Sheila Shulman What does the Voice of Auschwitz command? Jews are forbidden to hand Hitler posthumous victories. They are commanded to survive as Jews, lest the Jewish people perish. They are commanded to remember the victims of Auschwitz lest their memory perish. They are forbidden to despair of man and his world, and to escape either into cynicism or other- worldliness, lest they co- operate in delivering the world over to the forces of Auschwitz. Finally, they are forbidden to despair of the God of Israel, lest Judaism perish. A secularist Jew cannot make himself believe by a mere act of will, nor can he be commanded to do so . . . And a religious Jew who has stayed with his God may be forced into new, possibly revolutionary relationships with Him. One possibility, however, is wholly unthinkable. A Jew may not respond to Hitler's attempt to destroy Judaism by himself co-operating in its destruction. In ancient times, the unthinkable Jewish sin was idolatry. Today, it is to respond to Hitler by doing his work.1 In Fackenheim's thought, the "commanding Voice of Auschwitz" exists by analogy with the commanding Voice at Sinai, except that at Auschwitz, the Voice "manifests a divine presence which is shorn, as it were, of all except commanding Power".2 That "as it were", or k'v'yachol , is a Fackenheimian sleight-of-rhetoric I shall come back to later. Shorn as it is, the Voice is nonetheless "an imperative as truly given " by "a Voice as truly other than man-made ideals" as was the Voice at Sinai.3 As the Voice(s) are analagous (Ã¶r is Fackenheim, with his "as it were", implying identity?), so the events are analagous, though Fackenheim recognizes how difficult it is to grasp the comparison. The events are analagous, he claims, in their singularity, their magnitude, their centrality to Jewish experience, and, as he quotes Elie Wiesel as saying, in their revelatory significance.4 In both events, he says, the Jews were "singled out", though this very singling out</page><page sequence="2">proclaims the absolute difference between the two events. "At Treblinka the Jews were singled out for death as inexorably as at Sinai they were singled out for life."5 Such a spectacular caveat notwithstanding, Fackenheim's claim of analogy between the events, and hence of analogy between the "commanding Voice(s)" which emerge from them, is large indeed. And while it is rhetorically impressive, it contains much that is problematical, and needs to be looked at more closely. Fackenheim substantiates his claim by constituting the "Nazi Empire", and therefore the Holocaust, as a "novum" both in Jewish history and in history-in-general. It is one of the very few; the Red Sea and Sinai are the two others he mentions, and it is implicit in his argument that a "novum" is the only possible kind of event out of which such a "commanding Voice" will speak. He points out that in traditional Jewish thought the only other possible "novum" (besides the Red Sea and Sinai) will be the advent of the Messiah. So the idea of "the commanding Voice of Auschwitz" represents both a break with traditional Jewish thought and an acknowledgement that because the Holocaust was unique in history, it requires a theological response of a radically different order from those made to other catastrophes in Jewish history. 1 can only baldly summarize Fackenheim's grounds for saying that the Nazi Empire/the Holocaust is a "novum". By legally defining "mere existence" as a capital crime (in the case of the Jews), by institutionalizing that definition and acting upon it with unprecedented efficiency, the "Nazi Empire" sought to "destroy the reality of the divine image so systematically as to make its rejection of that knowledge into a self-fulfilling prophecy."6 That statement requires a bit of unpacking. The Nazi intention involved the systematic reduction of the human being to something less than human, so that the physical destruction was, in fact, so to speak, merely a cleaning-up operation. One element in this systematic reduction was, as Fackenheim puts it, the very murder of Jewish martyrdom. That is, historically, the response of Jewish faith to catastrophe that threatened Jewish existence as Jewish existence, was sometimes to choose to die as a witness to Jewish existence and Jewish faith, which were inseparable. In the situation of the "Nazi Empire" or "Planet Auschwitz", this An Encounter With Fackenheim possibility, Fackenheim says, was destroyed, both because the choice was removed, and even if it might have been conceivable it was rendered cheap and banal. I have serious reservations about this part of Fackenheim's argument, but will come back to them later. In any case, the fact remains that the monstrous intention of the "Nazi Empire" was matched, although by no means entirely, by its effects. "This empire succeeded in destroying the divine image in some. It also succeeded in destroying, in others, an ancient way of testifying to the divine image."7 That double destruction is part, though only part, of what makes the event a "novum". Because "after that double success . . . how can one witness to the divine image in man and hope to be believed? How can one believe one's own testimony?"8 The question, he says, is raised by the Nazi murder camp, which is a "novum". An answer, which shares in the "novum", can therefore only come from the murder camps. The other part of what makes the event a "novum" is the radically different meaning of survival (for however long) in such conditions. Because Fackenheim is an honourable man, he tries to make clear that he means survival with dignity, with humanity, survival in such a way that the divine image is neither violated nor destroyed. But once he is no longer talking about the camps, survival too becomes a deeply problematical construct in Fackenheim's thought. Once again, I will come back to it. He says "when every effort is made to reduce dying to a banality, life does not need to be sanctified. It already is holy."9 Just as his evidence for the radically different reality and meaning of destruction comes from those who have experienced it, so his evidence for the radically different meaning and reality of survival comes from the same source - for him the only legitimate source (and rightfully so, although, and this is crucial, he never acknowledges his own selectivity or the grounds for it) - those whose experience it was (is). He draws upon Terence Des Pres' book, The Survivor , which takes, he feels, the only legitimate stance, and here again, I could not agree more. That is, he says, the book "does not psychoanalyse or explain the survivor", but rather "exposes itself to his/her testimony".10 From "the weight of their collective testimony"11 he learns: (a) that sometimes, somehow, for some people, they did not succumb, and found in 39</page><page sequence="3">An Encounter With Fackenheim themselves a hitherto unacknowledged will-to- live; (b) that in a world that was . . . hell itself, some found ... an imperative and a law to help others as much as to be helped by them; and (c) that for some, recognition of the system as such made them feel " under orders to live . . . and if I did die in Auschwitz, it would be as a human being ... I would not become the contemptible and disgusting brute my enemy wished me to be . . ."12 So the possibility of witnessing to the divine image, and to the knowledge that the destroyed divine image can be restored, was not entirely destroyed. But, Fackenheim says, the possibility of witnessing to it by martyrdom was. The witness can no longer be Akiva, who in his situation was prepared to die for the knowledge (that the destroyed image can be restored), but "the survivor, determined to live and be human in a world where murder was law and degradation holy; whose testimony consisted, with every breath, of restoring the divine image in him/ herself even as it was ceaselessly being destroyed."10 This is the substance of the "novum" - at once existential, historical, philosophical, theological - this acute contradiction, this unresolvable, untranscendable contradiction: " both . . . the fact that the image of God was destroyed, and . . . the fact that the unsurpassable attempt to destroy it was resisted, supremely so, by the survivor."13 I cannot do justice, within the parameters of this essay, to the sophistication, the urgency, the courage of Fackenheim's discourse, nor to his fidelity, or rather, his attempted fidelity, both to Jewish history and to Judaism. At the same time, I am disturbed by rhetorical (in the sense that Socrates accused the Sophists of using Rhetoric) elements in that discourse, one effect of which is to sort of skid us past our capacity or even our desire to discriminate, and another effect of which is a certain excess of symmetry, a trimming into dialectical balance of elements which, looked at more closely, are more messy, more obscure, more complex. There is, I feel, yet another rhetorical element, though perhaps to call it a rhetorical element is to underestimate it. Both in The Jewish Return into History and in God's Presence in History , which are the two books I've worked with most, Fackenheim speaks with immense passion, complexity and acuteness both 40 about Jewish experience and Jewish faith, precisely in relation to "the commanding Voice of Auschwitz" and the "novum" out of which it emerges. At the same time, much as I would prefer it otherwise, to a grave extent the passion, the complexity, the acuteness, and even the mass of particulars he musters, are all pressed, with immense skill and sophistication, into the service of a bald and dangerous oversimplification. This emerges when we look, as we will presently, at the praxis , the complex of feelings, attitudes, positions and deeds, to which the "commanding Voice" directs us. As one of the "skids" I mentioned, I am, for example, anxious about the provenance of the "commanding Voice of Auschwitz". Fackenheim makes it clear that both the agnostic and the believer have to face "the fragmentariness of their hearing". To be sure, the agnostic hears no more than the mitzvah . . . but he cannot regard this mitzvah as the product of self-sufficient human reason . . . the 614th commandment must be to him an abrupt and absolute given , revealed in the midst of total catastrophe. On the other hand, the believer, who bears the voice of the metzaveh , the commander, in the mitzvah , can hardly hear anything but the mitzvah. The reasons that made Martin Buber speak of an eclipse of God are still compelling. And if, nevertheless, a bond between Israel and God can be experienced in the abyss, this can hardly be more than the mitzvah itself.14 This won't quite do. Either the metzaveh is God or it is not God. If the metzaveh is God, what are the implications? If the metzaveh is God, then the eclipse is clearly not complete, and what are the implications of that? One implication must be that God was therefore present in the camps. I cannot begin to think what that might mean. But if the Voice spoke, as Fackenheim says it did, then that is a possibility; Fackenheim is obliged to reckon with it, and he does not. He fudges. If it is not God, it could be something other, something a good deal less fatuous than 'self- sufficient human reason,' an existential passion, possibly, which would not be based in reason, or a pantheistic sense of the sacredness of life, or some other deeply held conviction. Or even some</page><page sequence="4">totally unexamined, inexplicit "sense" that honourable survival was the only option. The world is not made up of intellectuals, after all, and there were people in the camps who were honourably sustained by simple human strengths that had not to do with belief in a transcendent God. Or it could be the devil - since he postulates a devil. And the mitzvah is by no means pellucidly clear, either in its compact version as the 614th commandment or in its expanded version as quoted at the beginning of this essay. The Irgun? Gush Emunim? Meir Kahane and Kach? What is it, precisely, to survive as a Jew? I do not for a moment wish to implicate Fackenheim in these positions, but I do see that he has not specifically excluded them. What is the relation of the "commanding Voice of Auschwitz" to problems of (however limited) secular Jewish power? To this, too, I'll return. Which brings me to a large problem inherent in the analogy of the events and the commanding Voice(s). When the Voice speaks at, or out of, Auschwitz, is it another matan torahl And if so, does it supersede, or even add to, that which was spoken at Sinai? That would raise grave problems indeed, of which the theological status of a metaphor may be the least. Fackenheim does not say that it is another matan tor ah, but he does not say that it is not, either. If it is, is it spoken to those who were there, or to those, also "who are not here this day"? This question, which Fackenheitn answers with a resounding "all authentic Jews", while yet not being explicit about whether we are faced with another matan torah , has, as we will see, serious implications for Jewish praxis in the post- Auschwitz world. For all his commitment to contradiction and ambiguity, at one point Fackenheim does imply, and perhaps more than imply, that the same Voice spoke at Sinai and at Auschwitz, He therefore collapses analogy into identity, or elides analogy into identity, without ever saying outright that that is what he is doing. It happens in one sentence. At Auschwitz, he says, the Voice "manifests a divine presence which, as it were , is shorn of all except commanding power".15 Now, that "as it were" is the English equivalent of k'v'yachol , the phrase used in Rabbinic midrash to preface an apparently anthropomorphic statement about God, a statement which, often, implies some limitation An Encounter With Fackenheim in God, in order to speak about God as God is "with us". He says further that Midrash (we will get to what he means by "Midrash" later) recognizes, exists within, and refuses to dissolve the tension between "a God who is divine only if he is omnibenevolent and omnipotent, and a world which is truly world only because it contains elements contradicting these divine attributes, namely evil and human freedom."16 This tension, he says, can only be maintained in story, which, unlike philosophy, can sustain a very high level of ambiguity, and remains rooted in experience. In Midrash, the element that makes story possible is precisely that k'v'yachol, that "at is were", since after all one cannot "really" say such things of God. He points out, further, that Midrashic existence acts as though all depended on man and prays as though all depended on God. It considers itself worthy of nothing so that it can only wait for redemption; and worth everything so that a single pure deed or prayer may have redemptive power. It holds all these aspects together because it knows itself to stand in a mutual, covenantal relation - mutual even though the partners are radically unequal, for the one is man and the other is God.17 Then he says that "the endurance of the tension has been continuous; that prior to the Holocaust it has never been broken."18 So we have to conclude from what he is saying that in the Holocaust the tension did break. The elements in the tension fell apart, because the sustaining peg, the k'v'yachol that makes story possible, could no longer be used. In what he calls Elie WiesePs "midrash" - God hanging on the gallows of a dying child18 - there is no "as it were". Everything has changed. But in saying that the Voice of Auschwitz "manifests a divine Presence which, as it were, is shorn of all except commanding power", Fackenheim is using a mode which he insists was only possible until the Holocaust: the traditional Rabbinic mode of sustaining tension which works because it knows, believes, trusts, insists, that the covenant is unbroken. After all, the Rabbinic midrashim which use that mode were, I believe, meant to be heard as consolation. He cannot have it both ways. Either "everything has 41</page><page sequence="5">An Encounter With Fackenheim changed", or nothing has changed. He cannot, on the one hand, legitimate the "commanding Voice of Auschwitz" by linking it to traditional midrash with that "as it were", so that it is God's voice speaking to us, unprecedentedly, not only again but with a radically different message, and on the other hand imply, no, say, that the tradition, perhaps even the Covenant, was broken in the Holocaust and that now we have to do, be, act, think in some other way according to the imperatives articulated by this "Voice". He cannot simultaneously link the "Voice" to the tradition in order to give it authority, and sever it with the claim of a radical rupture in order to determine its utterance. As an example of "dialectical trimming" we could look at Fackenheim's contention that the possibility of martyrdom itself was murdered, that is, that dying in order to witness at Auschwitz was and since then is no longer a viable Jewish option, and that therefore the classical tradition of Judaism, of Jewish witness, was and is disrupted. Once again, I take exception to Fackenheim with pain and regret, because he has been, and still is in some ways, central to my own understanding of Judaism and being a Jew. But this is just too slick, and leads to some really dangerous stuff. Experientially, what he says is simply not so. This is a particularly bald instance of rhetorical pressure. It is Fackenheim who chooses not to consider the option because it does not fit his argument. He says, again and again, the only valid testimony can come from the camps. O.K. Just as one example among many, there is Eliezar Berkovitz' book Faith After the Holocaust. Whatever one may think of it theoretically, Berkovitz brings testimony as unimpeachable as Fackenheim brings, but the testimony he brings affirms that Kiddush-ha- Shem was not only possible but actual, an honourable Jewish option. And Fackenheim is, like Berkovitz, to use Berkovitz' terms, only Job's brother, not Job. Berkovitz makes a formidable argument asserting not only that "the questioning of God's providence in the death camps was taking place clearly within the classical tradition of Judaism . . ." but that, "although God remained silent ..." there was "a Job who kept his faith to the end, who affirmed it at the very doors of the gas chambers, who was able to walk to his/her death defiantly singing his/her ani- ma' amin". 20 And, in order not to get carried 42 away into yet another "either/or", we should try to bear in mind also the immense range of human response to intolerable conditions that was neither survival at any cost nor martyrdom but was yet both Jewish and honourable. At the end of God's Presence in History , Fackenheim comments at some length on his formulation of what the "commanding Voice of Auschwitz" says. Here is a brief summary of that commentary. First, we must "remember and tell the tale". Then, "Jewish survival, were it even for no more than survival's sake , is a holy duty as well", because "after Auschwitz, Jewish life is more sacred than Jewish death, were it even for the sanctification of the divine name. The left- wing Israeli secularist Amos Kenan writes: 'After the death camps, we are left only one supreme value: existence.' " Further, "the Voice of Auschwitz commands Jewish unity". That is, it commands unity between the religious and the secular Jew. "The ways of the religious Jew are revolutionary, for there is no previous protest against divine power like his protest." Fackenheim claims that the religious Jew remains within the midrashic framework, but this statement depends upon a definition of midrash that is singular indeed. Rabbinic midrash was invariably based upon a scriptural text, and assumed an unbroken covenant, even in the midst of what was then perceived as total catastrophe. Fackenheim's "mad midrash", a transmogrified "midrashic framework", derives from the "novum" of the Holocaust and in response to the "commanding Voice of Auschwitz". In this "midrashic framework" the religious Jew says: "You have abandoned the covenant? We shall not abandon it. You no longer want Jews to survive? We shall survive as better, more faithful, more pious Jews."21 The force of these statements, indeed the force of much of Fackenheim's argument, is to endow the Voice of Auschwitz with the power of a new scripture, based on a broken covenant. But at Sinai, all of those who were there "heard" the same commandments, and that common "hearing" provided the ground for the notion of klal yisrael. As we have seen, not everyone "heard" the same "commanding Voice" at Auschwitz. I do not believe that Fackenheim can claim a true "midrashic framework" for the religious Jew he postulates here unless he explicitly acknowledges that the Voice articulates</page><page sequence="6">a new scripture heard by all Jews, and then he is in other kinds of trouble. Nor can he legitimately say, in this context, of the secular Jew, that "he cannot return (to the 'midrashic framework') but neither may he turn the Voice of Auschwitz against that of Sinai. For he may not cut off his secular present from the religious past. The Voice of Auschwitz commands preservation of the past."22 We have to ask here what "preservation of the past" means, if the covenant is broken. Archeology perhaps? He cannot turn one voice against the other because for Fackenheim they are, as I said, the same for purposes of authority but radically different in terms of their utterance. Fackenheim presents this commentary in the form of fragments, which he says are in conflict. They are not, really, and they lead, as his whole argument has been leading, to one "simple certainty".23 The "simple certainty" is the survival of the Jewish people, which he equates with the survival of the state of Israel, at all costs. And here we run into big trouble, even if we accept, as I do, with reservations, his statement that "at the heart of every authentic response to the Holocaust - religious and secular, Jewish and non-Jewish - is a commitment to the autonomy and security of the state of Israel."24 But that statement begs too many questions, leaves the way open to too many unholy alliances, and most of all, once again overrides with rhetoric the necessity to discriminate, to make distinctions. Here at last is the "bald and dangerous oversimplification" I talked about earlier. The praxis to which the "commanding Voice of Auschwitz" directs us is survival. To what end? At what cost? These are questions Fackenheim does not answer, really, or even engage with, except rhetorically. To bear witness to the nations? About what? For all Fackenheim's humanist stance, at bottom what he says contains a terrible triumphalism, a kind of denial of the powerful midrash that at the Red Sea God wept, and an equally terrible tautology: we should survive because we have survived. What he says demands that we do not question, do not criticize. Perhaps he has never recovered from his Hegelian past, only now it is Israel instead of Prussia about which he can say, whatever is, is right. To what kind of religious/secular Jewish unity are we being asked to assent? Religious fundamentalist "settlers" and secular advocates An Encounter With Fackenheim of "Greater Judea"? What kind of survival is he talking about? Am I supposed to assent to the moral and spiritual bankruptcy of a statement like Amos Kenan's (see below) which Fackenheim quotes with such sad approbation? I consider myself, even in Fackenheim's terms, an "authentic Jew". But I stick at this. Perhaps it is only because I am not there. I don't know. I can't know. I only know that sitting here now, I cannot believe that it is for this we have survived. If this is now the authentic Jewish position, and in Fackenheim's terms it certainly is, for he presents it as spoken by a Jew, secular perhaps but his secularity is, as Fackenheim has said, rendered holy by his passion for survival, if this is now the authentic Jewish position, then we have lost all connection with the Voice of Sinai, the "Voice of Auschwitz" has superseded the Voice of Sinai, and we have been severed from our past. If this is not handing Hitler a posthumous victory, I'm not sure I know what is. Until you agree to have peace, I shall give back nothing. And if you force me to become a conqueror, I shall become a conqueror. And if you force me to become an oppressor, I shall become an oppressor. And if you force me into the same camp with all the forces of darkness in the world, there I shall be.25 Toward the beginning of The Jewish Return into History , Fackenheim says in a footnote: "By choosing for our children not to be victims, may we be exposing them to the possibility, or the likelihood, that they will be murderers?"26 In his commitment to dialectical thinking, in his seduction by his own rhetoric, in his forgetting that he is Job's brother and not Job, in his infatuation with the complexities of his own thinking and with his philosopher's excited discovery of "real-politik", and by neglecting the one real challenge of our situation as Jews, the one real human challenge, which is to find ways of being neither victims or oppressors, in short, to come to and to live out a different understanding of power, Fackenheim has guaranteed, for those who fully accept his stance and his argument, that our children will indeed, will certainly, be murderers. 43</page><page sequence="7">The Experience of Conversion to Judaism Notes (Bibliographical items are indicated by B. followed by the number of the item in the Bibliography.) 1.
