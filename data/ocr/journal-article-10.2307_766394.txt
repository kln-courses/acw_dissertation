<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of the Royal Musical Association, 121 (1996) The Retransition as Sign: Listener-Orientated Approaches to Tonal Closure in Haydn's Sonata-Form Movements MICHAEL SPITZER MusIC psychologists interested in the perception of tonal closure might do worse than investigate the Classical retransition as a sign of impen- ding resolution. Haydn tends to attract more than his fair share of 'listener-orientated' approaches, perhaps on account of his attested sen- sitivity to his audience's cognitive 'processing limits'.' His well-known remark to Griesinger that, isolated at Eszterhaiza, he 'could make ex- periments, observe what elicited or weakened an impression, and thus correct, add, delete, take risks'2 conveys the impression of an artist clearly in touch with his public. And yet this most playful of composers exploited this rapport to mislead his listeners, making aesthetic capital out of systematic disinformation. Inasmuch as the recapitulation is the linchpin of Classical sonata form, Haydn's best jokes turn on our anticipa- tion of this moment of relaxation, gulling us into false certainties before pulling the rug from beneath our feet.3 To be sure, the success of these feints depends on our sense of an ending. Nevertheless, our susceptibility to Haydn's tricks - our very gullibility - is potentiated by an opposite principle, which I call a 'forgetting of beginning'. This principle presents an old problem in a new light. Currently an embarrassment to the score- orientated analyst, the decay over time of the average listener's memory for the tonic is actually the ground which allows the comic composer's most admired rhetorical effects. I will argue that 'forgetting', with its ad- mission of structural redundancy, is one of the chief ways in which the Classical style permits novices to enjoy its music as much as experts. The first part of this essay reviews the current debates over the psychological reality of several analytical models, making a case for local listening strategies over global. The second part shows how a retransition can signify closure on three semiotic levels, analyses two specific retransi- tions by Haydn, and considers the extreme case of retransitions which elide their dominant. 1 See Mark Evan Bonds, Wordless Rhetoric: Musical Form and the Metaphor of the Oration (Cam- bridge, Mass., 1991). 2 Edited and translated in Vernon Gotwals, Joseph Haydn: Eighteenth-Century Gentleman and Genius (Madison, 1963), 17. 9 See Charles Rosen, The Classical Style (New York, 1972), 337.

Nevertheless, cau- tionary notes have recently been struck by representatives of both camps, alternately mindful of the gap between their professional competencies and eager to make closer ties.4 I do not intend to rehearse the issues here. I wish simply to make the point that, in the disputes between the rival claims of local and global listening strategies, one side is clearly winning. On the global side, Nicholas Cook's tests on the perception of tonal closure in Liszt have suggested that long-range key relationships are little more than regulative metaphors." On the local side, however, Rosner and Meyer's experiments on the recognition of melodic patterns produced more positive results: listeners are capable of distinguishing between gap-fill and changing-note melodies.6 John Sloboda, in his review of these experiments, is wrong to draw equally pessimistic prog- nostications from both tonal and melodic approaches.' In fact, local melodic archetypes or schemas can function perfectly audibly - to a sty- listically enculturated listener - as indices of global position. This merely reformulates a truism of modern schema and topic theory, that musical signs are context-specific without necessarily being hierarchically deter- mined. The results of Rosner and Meyer's analysis showed that listeners grouped melodies in terms of melodic process but not in terms of form. This conclusion, however, is not incompatible with the hypothesis (to my knowledge yet to be tested) that melodic types cue contextual posi- tions within form. In fact, Meyer has written elsewhere that changing- note archetypes, or 'schemas', divide into closed and implicative varieties, and that the former are usually found in cadential positions while the latter tend to occur at the openings of pieces.8 Similarly, Agawu has 4 See Eric Clarke, 'Mind the Gap: Formal Structures and Psychological Processes in Music', Contemporary Music Review, 3 (1989), 1-13.

In Meyer's theory of gap-fill motion, disjunct inter- vals in a melody may be resolved by countervailing conjunct progressions. 7 John Sloboda, 'Psychological Structures in Music: Core Research 1980-1990', Companion to Contemporary Musical Thought, ed. John Paynter et al. (London, 1992), 803-39. 'Implicit in the work of Cook and Rosner and Meyer is the notion that there are processing limits on human cognitive capacity that limit what can be extracted from music, at least on early hearings. Their findings do not show that people cannot hear out large-scale structure. They simply show that they do not usually do so in early listening given the experimental tasks required of them [. . .]. With longer exposure andlor different tasks, it is still quite possible that we may find evidence of large-scale psychological representations' (p. 833). 8 Leonard B. Meyer, Style and Music: Theory, History and Ideology (Philadelphia, 1989). 'In the tonic version of the changing-note schema, the melody revolves around the first degree of the scales, usually moving 1-712-1, but sometimes using the opposite order (1-2/7-1)' (p. 227). Meyer thinks that the former version makes a good opening theme, because it 'rises sequentially, implying continuation to the third of the scale or beyond'. The latter version is more suitable for cadential gestures, since 'the closure that the leading-tone-to-tonic motion (7-1) creates is too strong for the generation of more extensive melodic structures'.</page><page sequence="3">THE RETRANSITION AS SIGN 13 characterized topics as beginning-, middle- or end-directed depending on their stable, developmental or cadential qualities.9 Listeners do hear large-scale structure, but on a local level. A theory of long-range hearing must therefore be predicated on the negotiation of chains of structural markers, rather than on a memory for tonal centre. Jumping from music perception to semiotics seems to involve us in a paradigm-shift between fluid and discontinuous models of large-scale structure. Omnipresent tonal bearings give way to intermittent signposts. Furthermore, listening 'as decoding' is presumably subject to idiosyn- cratic histories of knowledge acquisition and the knotty vicissitudes of the hermeneutic circle. By contrast, the givens of tonality are supposed- ly something we are all born with, or else pick up at the same time. In fact, the gap between cognition and interpretation is not as wide as is thought. On the one hand, our sensitivity to triads and keys is as culture- bound as our interpretation of any other sign;'0 on the other hand, our acquisition of stylistic tokens is motivated by 'best-fit' principles. As Meyer's example suggested, melodies are accommodated in pieces in ac- cordance with their conformity to innate laws of Gestalt perception. Perhaps the most substantive corollary of this shift is that music's social and historical orientation is now foregrounded, reverting to what the philosopher Jerry Fodor calls 'anthropological holism'." Fodor defines this as 'the idea that [our] narrow reading of language is hopelessly ar- tificial and that, in the long run, there is no real distinction between what is linguistic behaviour and what isn't or, ultimately, between languages and whole cultures'.'2 In the final analysis, symbols get their meaning as much from the manner in which they operate within a language-system as from the way they are embedded in forms of life. One of the more troubling consequences of 'holism' is that there is no principled way of distinguishing the propositions that you do have to believe in order to believe something is the case from the ones you do not. This may yield counter-intuitive 'sorites' arguments, such as 'the slippery slope that runs from there being no principled difference between baldness and hairiness [how much hair can you lose before being declared bald?] to the conclu- sion that everyone is bald (or that nobody is)'." How do we stop analytic conditions of grammaticality ('tomatoes are constitutive of my notion of the colour red') from slipping into pragmatics ('Shakespeare would be out of luck; he did not know about tomatoes')? Fodor's antidote to holistic slippage is expounded in his key text, The Modularity of Mind.'4 Modularity insists upon a cognitive division of labour, with various thought-'demons' engaged in different, non- 9 V.

A Generative Theory of Tonal Music presents a modular music theory, in which rhythmic, metrical, time-span and prolongational reduction is undertaken in discrete compartments.16 Lerdahl and Jackendoff also adopt Fodor's belief in an algorithmic 'language of thought' abstracted from any spoken language and disembodied from its neurological medium. Fodor's 'Men- talese' can be thought by a computer. By the same token, Lerdahl and Jackendoff deracinate the social and historical aspects of musical com- petence by hypostasizing an all-generative 'tonality'. I will spend some time questioning the premiss of A Generative Theory of Tonal Music because, its limitations aside, it is the best listener-orientated analytical model we have. Despite its attempts to buttress musical grammaticality with modules, it fatally succumbs to the slippery slopes of holism. Lerdahl and Jacken- doff's musical 'sorites' runs as follows: the listener orientates himself with reference to the very largest unit of structure and works his way down. Prolongational reduction begins with the head of the piece, dividing in- to progressively smaller regions until all events are included. Since this prolongational head is identified with the piece's conclusion (the point of maximal prolongational stability), the listener is not in a posi- tion to make any sense of the music until it has stopped playing. Either this rules out the possibility of ongoing or prospective cognition, or it relegates the theory's status to that of a psychologically unrealistic heuristic fiction. The cadence is the slippery slope along which A Generative Theory of Tonal Music slides into holism. Cadences are chunks of prefabricated reality which a piece adopts whole. They can hardly be accepted as top- down transformations of a prolongational head. Through their problem- atic accommodation with the cadence, Lerdahl and Jackendoff render their generative theory hostage to historical style analysis. The steps of this dialectic need spelling out. First, cadences as motto endings antedate the period of Classical tonality. Second, half and full closes are taken up by the archetypal Classical phrase. Third, the authors extrapolate the principles of tonality from the low-level phrase and project them across an architectonic level. The tensing/relaxing progression of the melody gets mapped onto the large-scale dynamics of modulation/recapitulation. Fourth, Lerdahl and Jackendoff loop back down from the global level so as to override local input: 'one of the characteristics of the more sophisticated listener is his ability to overcome this pressure for a "bottom- up" analysis and to hear large-scale patterns of tension and relaxation that cut across phrase boundaries'.7 This is their way of understanding feminine cadences, which are metrically weak yet structural all the same. 5 The distinguishing features of modules are informational encapsulation, domain specificity, mandatory operation and innateness. This means that modules function indep- endently of one another, are charged with specific tasks ('language' modules are independent of 'thought' modules), and are not subject to voluntary control or change: they are inborn. 6 Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff, A Generative Theory of Tonal Music (Cambridge, Mass., 1983). 17 Ibid., 222.</page><page sequence="5">THE RETRANSITION AS SIGN 15 It is perhaps a unique feature of Classical music that composers model- led the tonal architecture of entire pieces on the dynamics of the melodic phrase. One of the neatest demonstrations of this analogy is Elaine Sisman's Kochian analysis of Haydn's G minor Piano Trio (Hob. XV:19/i).18 It by no means follows, however, that harmonic tension is un- folded recursively and in the same way at all levels. According to Dahlhaus, the widespread theory that in Classical music all harmonic relationships can be seen as expansions or modifications of the cadence is thoroughly mistaken. Moreover, the force of a harmonic model is not independent of the formal level on which it appears. The cadence I-IV-V-I, taken as a sequence of chords, cannot be reversed to form I-V-IV-I without some loss of effect, yet as an arrangement of keys, a harmonic outline for an entire movement, the reversed form is commoner than the original.'9 This mismatch between cadence and form, which at best can be excused as a helpful analytical metaphor, is the most blatant example of a prin- ciple endemic to complex music. Ultimately, A Generative Theory of Tonal Music, like Meyer's theory before it, is an attempt to settle the problem of parametric non-congruence, which besets musical structure at all levels. At the lowest level, structural accents diverge from rhythmic salience (for instance, in metrically weak feminine cadences). At an intermediate level, harmonic rhythm cuts across phrase structure (a dominant harmony strad- dles both halves of an antecedent-consequent period structure). And at the highest level of all, prolongational regions are non-congruent with time-spans (hypermetrical downbeats do not map onto recapitulations). We might agree with every stage of this analysis taken by itself, while disputing the top-to-bottom transformational path which the authors believe connects them. The problem with this approach is the assumption that, by heaping up enough musical facts, one is bound to reach a 'value ceiling'. But this 'incremental parametric' process is open to two serious objections. First, not every case of non-congruence is pertinent. Parametric non-congruence is so pervasive in tonal music that there is no justification for regarding it as the chief agent of instability. Every melody is a multi-dimensional composite of pitch, interval and contour, not to mention its harmonic and rhythmic attributes.2" Listeners cope with this complexity in pro- portion to their musical training, as Lyle Davidson points out in her study of the acquisition of singing skills in children: 'One index of musical sophistication is the ability to integrate localized pitch knowledge into increasingly less contextualized tonal structures as represented by scales and keys.'21 The synthesizing process of the listening experience should 8 Elaine Sisman, 'Small and Expanded Forms: Koch's Model and Haydn's Music', Musical Quarterly, 68 (1982), 444-75. Sisman shows how Koch and Haydn employ similar expansion tech- niques to arrive at larger sonata-form structures from a small period. See also Rosen, The Classical Style, 83-8.

There is all the difference in the world between understanding a melody tonally and comprehending it as an elabora- tion of a prolongational region. In Narmour's terminology, it is a dif- ference between 'accommodation' (the melody is preserved; the focus is on the melody) and 'assimilation' (the melody is absorbed; the focus is on the Ursatz).22 We encounter similar problems with the locus classicus of parametric non-congruence, Meyer's 'semicadence', or half close.23 It is not clear, given the terms of the argument, why Meyer finds non- congruence destabilizing while Carl Schachter, in the course of his essays on rhythmic reduction, discovers the same conflicts between durational and tonal rhythm to be enriching.24 'Richness' is perhaps a better and less loaded term than 'non-congruence' since it does not connote an obligation to resolve, either sequentially (Meyer's realization of implica- tions) or hierarchically (Lerdahl and Jackendoffs generative grammar). The second objection to the incremental parametric process bears upon Lerdahl and Jackendoffs cognitive 'preference rules', principles which help audiences choose between a host of competing well-formed struc- tures. Put simply, the listener's preference rules are not all in the piece; some are outside. The creation/reception circuit is prey to myriad exter- nal factors, ranging from the tastes of the person who happens to com- mission the piece to the outbreak of wars. It is even less practicable to separate grammaticality from pragmatics (style, psychopathology and behaviour) in music than in language. One thing that music is especially good at is enshrining the accidents of experience in quasi-natural forms, literally 'style forms' (in Narmour's parlance). There are many roughly equivalent similes for style forms: archetypes, schemata, scripts, frames, all denoting the active organization of past experience into mental struc- tures. In Jean Mandler's words, schemata are formed 'on the basis of past experience with objects, scenes or events and consisting of a set of (usually unconscious) expectations about what things look like andlor the order in which they occur'.25 Crucially, these learned constraints are just as 'cognitive' as Lerdahl and Jackendoffs Ursatz-driven preferences, and they are much more accessible to introspection, testing and style analysis. With this in mind, let us return to the question of parametric non-congruence and the cadential structure of melodies. Example 1 represents a melody by Haydn in two ways: in Schachter- style rhythmic reduction, illustrating the conflict between metrical and tonal emphasis (Example la), and in Robert Gjerdingen's scale-degree notation (Example lb).26 The rhythmic reduction shows a V7 prolonga- 22 See Eugene Narmour, Beyond Schenkerism (Chicago, 1977), 41-7. 23 See Leonard B Meyer, Explaining Music (Chicago, 1973), 85. 'A semicadence might be defined as one in which a mobile, goal-directed, harmonic process is temporarily stabilised by decisive rhythmic closure. In other words, a semicadence is a case of parametric noncongruence which has become archetypal in the stylistic syntax of tonal music.' 24 Carl Schachter, 'Rhythm and Linear Analysis: A Preliminary Study', Music Forum, 5 (New York, 1976), 281-334.

Gjerdingen's brackets enclose, respectively, the initial and terminal cues of a '1-7... 4-3' changing- note archetype, or schema. This eighteenth-century thematic cliche, of which Gjerdingen gives hundreds of instantiations, consists of a coor- dinated set of melodic, harmonic and metrical movements. Knowledge of this pattern, organized as a mental schema, facilitates our processing of a huge body of Classical themes. Given the initial event of this schema, we can predict all the attributes of the terminal event with great specificity: the V-I harmonic progression, the 4-3 melodic cue and the exact place- ment of its metrical boundary. Which interpretation is more realistic? Is the melody problematized by staggered phrase and tonal structure and by metrically displaced cadences? Or do we hear it as a perfectly satisfy- ing instantiation of a familiar schema? It helps to invoke the eticlemic distinction: not all factors demonstrably present to the 'radical observer'</page><page sequence="8">18 MICHAEL SPITZER are actually pertinent to the competent, yet humble, listener. It is more helpful to regard the feminine cadence as an acceptable variant of an archetypal 4-3 cue than as a transformation of a prolongational region. Deciding between familiarity with simple tunes and knowledge of tonality is not quite like comparing apples and oranges; more like a bird in the hand and two in the bush. A Generative Theory of Tonal Music has one mighty advantage over schema theory. There seems to be no principled method of deciding why some cases of parametric non-congruence become archetypal and others do not. In a universe of signs, Lerdahl andJackendoff's normative trees pro- vide a precious uniformity. Is there a way of crossing over into 'an- thropological holism' without contracting critical paralysis, or succumbing to the infinite regress of Eco's 'unlimited semiosis', where every sign signifies another?27 The question is why some signs fit better than others. According to Meyer, 'innovations that are consonant with human perceptual and cognitive capacities - the constraints of the central nervous system - are more likely to be used and replicated than innovations that are not so'. Furthermore, 'an innovation is more likely to endure through replica- tion if it is compatible with other constraints of the style being em- ployed'.28 This may be illustrated with reference to the 1-7... 4-3 schema again. Gjerdingen's statistical survey indicates that the schema's population curve peaked in the 1770s. Indeed, its phenomenal success makes it prototypical of early Classicism, to the extent that neoclassical works such as Mahler's Fourth Symphony invoke this schema in order to doff their cap to the earlier style. Yet Gjerdingen never explains why the 1-7... 4-3 schema should become virtually synonymous with galant melodies, apart from recognizing that their symmetrically closed phrase structure made them alien to later periods. A psychoacoustic explanation of the 1-7 ... 4-3 schema's success would note that its intervallic structure - two semitones separated by a tritone - conforms to Richmond Browne's 'rare interval hypothesis'.29 Browne argues that listeners are most highly sensitized to semitones and tritones because these are the rarest intervals in the diatonic pitch set (a C major scale contains two semitones, E-F and B-C, and one tritone, B-F). These intervals consequently function as perceptual cues, giving the listener his sense of key. One can conclude that the 1-7... 4-3 schema became prototypical of first subjects because it establishes the tonic with particular efficiency. This kind of explanation sheds light both on why the schema arose and on why it tended to be placed in opening positions of sonata forms. Perhaps the positions of other tonal 'cues', or signs, can be shown to be motivated by similar factors of prototypicality. We seem to know a lot about opening and closing signs (thematic types and cadences), but much less about middle signs. The retransition is the archetypal middle 27 Umberto Eco, A Theory of Semiotics (Bloomington, 1979), 69. 28 Style and Music, 140. 29 Richmond Browne, 'Tonal Implications of the Diatonic Set', In Theory Only, 5 (1981), 3-21.</page><page sequence="9">THE RETRANSITION AS SIGN 19 sign, since it falls about two thirds of the way through a sonata form and signals the imminent entry of the recapitulation, the intermediate junc- ture of the movement. In the next part of this article, I will show why it makes sense to regard the retransition as a 'sign' and how it engages local-level listening strategies. II Music theory tends to represent the retransition not as a sign, nor even as a well-formed structural unit, but as an abstract co-ordinate in the global tonal system. This is indicated in Lerdahl andJackendoffs tree diagram of a model sonata-form prolongational reduction (see Figure la). The authors believe that the recapitulation sounds stable because this in- termediate tonic forms a right-branching prolongation of the initial tonic. They thus argue that we hear sonata-form resolution along the same lines as the intermediate tonic of an antecedent-consequent phrase structure; their sonata model resembles their cadential tree (see Figure lb). The fault lines of this false analogy come to a head in Lerdahl and Jacken- doffs ambivalence about the orientation of the retransition. Figure la connects it both backwards, as a right-branching, tensing, prolongation of the development, and forwards, as a left-branching, relaxing, prolonga- / (a) I ... v II v v I exposition development recap.

My counter-proposal is that retransitions are effective as perceptual cues because they 'stick out' of the music. Our preoccupation with tonal closure clouds the fact that retransitions, rather than promoting continui- ty, tend actually to rupture form. William Newman meant this when he called the retransition 'the climax of music': 'If we think of the climax as the maximum point of tension, then it may well occur just before the recapitulation, because the recapitulation begins with a strong feeling of release and return.'31 There is no reason to think of this tension as being specifically tonal; I argue that the retransition is marked for con- sciousness with a whole battery of textural and rhetorical devices. These discontinuities divide broadly into modal contrasts, gestural profiles and schematic types. Such 'qualitative' signposts differ from the 'relational' dimensions to which most music theory is directed: pitch reference, voice- leading and tonal hierarchy. The opposition between relational and qualitative hearing is summarized in Figure 2. These distinctions will be explained at some length below. But first, two possible confusions must immediately be settled. First, I do not dismiss the possibility that rela- tional factors play a part in our perception of resolution, especially in later hearings of a piece. I merely claim that they are the icing on the qualitative cake. Second, this relational/qualitative distinction is not strictly congruent with my earlier opposition between global and local listen- ing. The whole point of structural signposts is that they are global at a local level. These considerations notwithstanding, a listener-orientated approach to tonal closure can be established from the standpoint, respec- tively, of 'mode', 'gesture' and 'type'. Relational: pitch voice-leading hierarchy Qualitative: mode gesture type Figure 2. Relational versus qualitative approaches to tonal closure. PITCHIMODE As stated earlier, melodies are multi-dimensional composites, including parameters such as pitch, interval and contour. The relationship between these dimensions changes not only according to the musical training of the listener, but also with respect to the time-lag between the initial soun- ding of the melody and its recollection or recognition. W. Jay Dowling, in his experiments on melody recognition (see above, note 20), discovered that inexperienced listeners represented melodies in terms of diatonic scale-steps, a property that did not remain invariant with 'context shift', that is, changes of harmony or key. Moderately experienced subjects 30 Lerdahl and Jackendoff, A Generative Theory, 245. 91 William S. Newman, 'The Climax of Music', Music Review, 13 (1952), 283-93.</page><page sequence="11">THE RETRANSITION AS SIGN 21 employed contour-plus-tonal framework representations, while profes- sionals were able to use a wide variety of recognition devices. The crucial point is that, while it is implausible to remember melodies as a set of absolute pitches, contour also becomes less important in long-term memory. Conversely, with the passage of time, the importance of inter- vals becomes greater. We can assimilate this conclusion to Butler and Brown's theory of 'pitch set',32 itself a development of Richmond Browne's aforementioned 'rare interval hypothesis'. A pitch set, such as the notes constituting a C major diatonic scale, contains each interval a unique number of times; in this case, two minor seconds (E-F and B- C) and one tritone (F-B). A minor-mode pitch set, by contrast, contains three minor seconds and two tritones. The specificity of these rare in- tervals serves as a better perceptual cue over long time-spans than any memory for absolute pitch. One conclusion for the analyst of Classical sonata form is that large-scale minor/major, or chromatic/diatonic, modal contrast is more audible, and thus more pertinent, than long-range tonic/dominant tension. In other words, we should alter our technical metaphor, and speak of the recapitulation as 'a passage from darkness to light' rather than as a resolution from a tense key to the tonic. James Baker's recent work on chromatic-diatonic contrast in Mozart's piano sonatas suggests such a conclusion.33 Baker argues that Mozart's music is filled with passages in which the various chromatic elements are added in strategic ways until the entire chromatic aggregate has been at- tained, and generally the introduction of the final chromatic element coincides with an important moment in the musical form.34 In spite of Baker's demonstration of Mozart's acute sensitivity to the 'ab- solute quality of each individual pitch',35 we might question whether employing 11 of the 12 semitones really does create an irresistible gravita- tional pull towards the twelfth. For instance, the codetta of Haydn's Piano Sonata in Eb (Hob. XVI:49) 'reinforces' the key with an 11-note chromatic scale (see Example 2). The excluded Db is not conspicuous by its absence, nor does it play an outstanding role in the forthcoming development section. Without denying the form-building role of chromatic-diatonic contrast in Classical music, one might nevertheless argue that resolution is created not through completion of the 12-note aggregate but, on the contrary, through the process of 'dechromatization' which immediately follows. The triads at bars 62 and 64 are the most radiant in the exposi- tion because they are set up by chromatic scales; the 11-note aggregate is 'earthed' by these cadential triads, and it is hard to believe that, within the constraints of Haydn's diatonic universe, enough chromatic 'charge' is left to connect the end of the exposition with the salient D~s of the development (bars 87 and 108; see Example 3 below). 'Light' is achieved by flushing out the black notes, not by adding to them. 32 David Butler and Helen Brown, 'Describing the Mental Representation of Tonality in Music', Musical Perceptions, ed.

It by no means follows, however, that all the foreground events sit in the shade of a single overarching tree. 6 The notational conceit can be applied just as well to rhetorical and stylistic notions of stability as to prolongational centres. First, musical rhythm, or 'the incessant breathing in and out of music' between points of relative tension and repose,37 embraces the very broadest categories of subversion and resolution. The literature on narrative contains many variants on this theme, such as Frank Kermode's notion of 'peripeteia' as 'a disconfirmation followed by a con- sonance'.38 A familiar musical example of this rhetorical strategy is the Classical 'false reprise-true reprise' model.39 Tonal explanations of 'falseness' are especially problematic when the false reprise lies in the tonic, as in Haydn's Symphony no. 41 in C major (1770), bar 97. In this case, the reprise is destabilized by proportional and textural imbalances: it comes only 18 bars into the development, and the oboes join in the 6 Lerdahl and Jackendoff, A Generative Theory, 183. 37 Ibid., 179. 38 Frank Kermode, The Sense of an Ending (New York, 1967), 18-19.

My second point is that ramifications can be relative not only to a fixed, Archimedean point within the score (Lerdahl and Jackendoff's trees), but also to a stylistic norm outside it. The normative is not necessarily identical with the Ursatz; for a theory of differential values in music, we can turn to Robert Hatten's recent work on 'markedness' in Beethoven.40 Markedness denotes 'the valuation given to difference'.41 The two terms of any opposition may have unequal value, with the 'marked' term being used less frequently and having a narrower range of reference. A marked entity of an opposition might thus be considered as a feature against a semantic, rather than perceptual, ground. Nevertheless, markedness should not be confused with salience; the term's valuation adheres whether or not this opposition happens to be foregrounded in the given situation. A good example of markedness in language is the opposition 'man-woman'. 'Man' is the unmarked term, since it can be used to refer generally to all humankind, of both sexes. By contrast, the marked term 'woman' specifies gender, and thus has a narrower range of meaning. Hatten goes on to discover markedness effects in a wide vari- ety of musical materials, such as the asymmetry between major and minor: A familiar opposition for music is that between major and minor modes in the Classical style. Minor has a narrower range of meaning than major, in that minor rather consistently conveys the tragic, whereas major is not simp- ly the opposite (comic), but must be characterised more generally as nontragic - encompassing more widely ranging modes of expression such as the heroic, the pastoral, and the genuinely comic, or buffa.42 This framework creates possibilities for 'expressive generic schem- ata'43 through which we can interpret a work's semiotic narrative. One example is the dramatic scenario 'tragic-to-triumphant' in Beethoven's 'heroic epics'.44 Haydn's pastoral narratives could be characterized in terms of brief outbreaks of crisis within idylls which contain them ('disrup- tive storms which soon pass').45 Though Hatten stays clear of the older composer, his pastoral hermeneutic of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in A major, op. 101, in which he detects a tragic irruption in the middle of the development section,46 can easily be extended to many of Haydn's own sonata forms. Momigny's celebrated programmatic interpretation of the first movement of Haydn's Symphony no. 103 in Eb alternates hym- nic chant, bucolic dances, murmurs and claps of thunder and general outbreaks of natural or social disturbance.47 Ian Bent has suggested that 40 Robert S.

The moment of most violent tension, bars 187-201, when 'the crisis boils over',49 is marked by fortissimo diminished seventh chords resolving to the tonic minor. Semioticians like Hatten and Agawu claim that musical materials are freighted with immanent syntactic obligations in addition to being cor- related with contemporary theatrical scenarios. Developmental material, characterized by aperiodicity, instability, greater complexity of design as well as atypicality, is marked with respect to closural material. To speak in such terms is already to recognize that these values are congruent with, dependent upon and in part originate from the basic Classical formal scheme of 'statement-elaboration-closure'.50 The Classical retransition enshrines a shift between the two most extreme oppositions available to its style. In other words, sonata-form rhythm can be interpreted as successive divergence and return around prototypical nodes. This notion of 'prototype rhythm' sheds light on more sophisticated compositional strategies. According to Hatten, the 'sensitising of formal locations in terms of material functions enables a composer to achieve strategic markedness by the use of material presumably inappropriate for the location - beginning with a "cadential" theme, for example'.'51 Similarly, I argue, a composer can achieve a converse kind of markedness by ending a development section with unorthodox formal closure. This is then marked against a subsequent normative close: the false reprise- true reprise model is predicated on this principle. The same principle informs an even more prevalent antecedent-consequent 'framing' device, which James Baker calls a 'large-scale reciprocal relation'.52 Turning to the Andante of Mozart's Piano Sonata in Bb, K.333 (a movement in Eb), Baker notices that the first half of the development, bars 32-40, is directed towards the tonicization of VI through the pointed resolution of a Bi to a C. The latter part of the development prepares the tonic return by replacing the B with its enharmonic substitute, Cb, which then resolves down a step to a bass Bb. Thus the main body of the development is framed by Bk-C balanced by Cb-Bb. The former progression is marked, not only because the chromatic note is assimilated into a distant key, but also because C minor is tonicized very weakly above a dominant pedal G. By contrast, the transference of this pitch, now as Cb, into the bass, yield- ing conjunct voice-leading to the cadential dominant seventh, makes the latter progression sound normative. Notice that this opposition em- braces qualitative types such as smooth and broken voice-leading, minor- and major-mode resolutions of chromatic pitches. Together with the antecedent-consequent syntax of its enharmonic rhyme, this frame is 8 Music Analysis in the Nineteenth Century, ii, ed.

Later on, I will call this framing device a 'false retransition-true retransition' model. HIERARCHY/TYPE Talk of the retransition as 'sign' shifts the focus from its contextual role within a tonally hierarchic structure towards an associative relationship with a target meaning. Yet the nature of this association need not be mechanical or arbitrary in the Saussurian sense; correlations can be 'motivated' cognitively through factors of appropriateness. Take the ex- ample of the pedal point, one of the retransition's stock ingredients. Ac- cording to Meyer, 'Patterns tend to be continued until they become as complete and stable as possible'; similarly, 'Once established, a pattern- ing tends to be continued until a point of relative tonal-rhythmic stability is reached.'53 Thus, after a turbulent passage of modulations or a cycle of fifths, a dominant pedal enacts a stabilizing function as a point of ar- rival and of rest. We can therefore say that the factors which make a pedal sound retransitional are both associative (learnt) and intrinsic (innate). In other words, the material's natural attributes facilitate its cultural use. These 'natural attributes' are obviously susceptible of more than one application. For example, the pedal's stabilizing quality makes it just as suitable for openings and codas as for retransitions. The difference does not inhere wholly in Meyerian 'non-congruence of parameters'; that is, in the fact that dominant pedals are formally closed but harmonically open, whereas in tonic pedals the dimensions are in phase. Rather, the pedal sign is ambiguous on the formal level as well, over and above mat- ters of harmonic fit. The pedal point is retrospectively reinterpreted from a structural downbeat to an anacrusis because we are too formally sen- sitized to accept a plateau at the height of a development section at face value. Sometimes, the semiotic richness of textural signs is mistaken for emp- tiness, as when textural topics are relegated to the status of contextual variables or dependent signs. Certainly, Janet Levy is right in thinking that texture 'cannot exist independently'.54 Yet Agawu's attention to the dissonance in Classical works between a coherent harmonic substrate and their discontinuous topical surface understates the subtlety with which textural signs can be layered and connected. Levy's key insight is that textural ambiguity permits the composer to slide between semantic levels in order to link structural junctures. Levy explores an opposition between unison and solo texture in the music of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Unisons are 'signs of close', while 'a solo [. . .] almost always either is, leads to, or implies a beginning'.55 She even endows both extremes with anthropomorphic connotations, identifying 'a solo line with an individual human voice' " Meyer, Explaining Music, 130. * See Janet Levy, 'Texture as a Sign in Classic and Early Romantic Music', Journal of the American Musicological Society, 35 (1982), 482-531 (p. 483). * Ibid., 519, 497.</page><page sequence="16">26 MICHAEL SPITZER and a unison with an 'aura of authoritative control [. . .] as in a crowd singing together'.56 'The use of unison for closing is most dramatic in a polyphonic context precisely because several independent strands are abruptly brought under the authority of - rather literally channelled in- to - one.'57 'The solo may rather literally serve to "conduct" the action to a beginning of a major segment in a formal structure'; 'often it behaves as an extended upbeat, and the sudden reduction of texture - particularly the absence of a bass - heightens the instability'.58 In Hatten's terms, solo and unison textures are marked, respectively, on the plus and minus sides of typicality, alternately over- and under- subjective. Levy describes the solo as 'vulnerable' and, at the opposite extreme, calls the authoritative, ceremonial aspect of unisons 'contrary to our sense of the individuality of human beings'.59 Both are 'against nature'. Two ideas stand out from these impressions. First, at no point do these two antagonistic aesthetics clash more abruptly than at the retran- sition. Second, the stepping forth of a solo and the fusion of voices into a single line are paradoxically interchangeable, since both result in a thin- ning of texture. Retransitions often employ this ambiguity to poetic af- fect: 'a unison has double value as a close because it maintains the strength of the tutti while as a single line it can also form a smooth transition to a solo beginning'.60 Tovey's purple account of the retransition of the 'Eroica' Symphony celebrates all these tricks without spelling them out: We are waiting on the threshold of the original key in breathless suspense for the return of the first theme. At last the suspense becomes too much for one of the horns, who gives out the tonic chord of the theme. The orchestra instantly awakens and settles down to recapitulate the opening.61 Tovey's 'breathless suspense' is engendered by a sequence of conventional signals of impending resolution: textural simplification; harmonic deceleration to the point of stasis with pedal; dynamic extremes (either very loud or very soft); some topic of mystery, characterized, for exam- ple, by tremolos; a minor mode, as well as some anticipation of the first subject. The unison of the strings authoritatively consolidates the strands of action into a single line, while also creating the effect of 'dissolution or clearing out'.62 The unison, furthermore, 'maintains the strength of a tutti while as a single line it can also form a smooth transition to a solo beginning'. Only now can we understand why the premature entry of the horn (a 'group-leader [. . .] "conduct[ing]" the action to a begin- ning') sounds so appropriate. In summary, a listener-orientated analysis of a Classical retransition will look for three short-term elements. The first element is a modal contrast 56 Levy, 'Texture as a Sign', 498, 507. 57 Ibid., 520. 5 Ibid., 498. 9 Ibid., 526, 507. 6 Ibid., 520. 61 Donald Francis Tovey, 'Beethoven: Symphony in E flat Major', Symphonies and Other Orchestral Works (Oxford, 1989), 44-52 (p. 46). 62 Levy, 'Texture as a Sign', 519.</page><page sequence="17">THE RETRANSITION AS SIGN 27 between minor and major, chromatic and diatonic, pitch-sets. The se- cond element is a parallelism between tensing/relaxing progressions of typicality. The third element comprises a repertory of textural signs, in- cluding pedal points, cadenzas, caesuras and tremolos. I illustrate this with a couple of Haydn's retransitions taken from a piano sonata and a string quartet. SONATA IN Eb, HOB. XVI:49 The development section of the first movement of this sonata falls into two broad units (see Example 3). The first half culminates with flamboyant figuration in F minor, leading to a half close on the dominant of that key. This resolution is denied: after a dramatic pause, the second half conducts the music towards a recapitulation in E1 major. One is thus inclined to designate the first unit 'development' proper and the second unit 'retransition'. This account accords well with Beth Shamgar's schema of the Classical retransition as a clearly demarcated section, lying between a full or half cadence at the end of the development and the return of the tonic in the reprise.63 Haydn's sonata, however, diverges from Shamgar's prescription in one important respect: its development con- cludes with a half cadence on the supertonic, F minor, whereas she asserts that developments normally end on the relative minor. Shamgar cites Koch's own words: the retransition is 'a transition from vi to I [...] usually achieved by means of several continuous modulations' (presumably a cycle of fifths).64 This sonata's retransition does indeed pass through V of C minor (bars 122-4), with a routine chromatic substitution of B1 for Bi in the bass. But this point is far less strongly demarcated than the half cadence on V of F minor at bar 107. Bars 107 and 108 are separated by contrasts of dynamic, register and material, as well as three crotchets' rest; bars 124 and 125 are divided by just a semitone in the bass. This ambiguity admits a fine-grained and a coarse-grained interpretation. Either we say that the textural (bar 107) and harmonic (bar 125) boun- daries are non-congruent, or we conclude that developments are demar- cated by a cadence in a minor mode, no matter on what degree of the scale. According to the latter, coarse-grained interpretation, the perti- nent form-building parameter is broad minor/major contrast. In that case, there is no need to view the various developments which end with a half close on V of II as deviant (another example is Haydn's String Quartet in D, op. 20 no. 4).65 In other words, the shift from V of VI to V of I, a staple preparation for tonic return, is not to be confused with the rhetorical ground-plan by which the composer sets a seal on the 'tens- ing' part of the development and initiates the 'relaxing' return home. To be sure, this tonal pivot is typically (even prototypically) congruent 63 Beth Shamgar, 'On Locating the Retransition in Classic Sonata Form', Music Review, 42 (1981), 130-43. 64 Heinrich C. Koch, Versuch einer Anleitung zur Composition (Leipzig, 1797), 224. 5 Five swings of a cycle of fifths (F4-B; E-A; D-G; C-F#; B-E) climax at bar 203 on the dominant of II. The passage at bars 206-15 may appear to be a false reprise, but it is really a disguised retransition, complementing the previous cycle of fifths with five swings in the op- posite direction: G-C; B-E; D-G; Ft-B; A-D.</page><page sequence="18">28 MICHAEL SPITZER Example 3.

Surprisingly, the coarse-grained reading proves to be both intricate and challenging. The first thing to unravel is Shamgar's assumption that retransitions are directed towards good dominant preparation. Is the F minor cadential passagework at the end of the 'development' not just as 'retransitional' as the cadenza in bars 126-32? Yes, but it is in the wrong key. Yet many eighteenth-century reprises follow on directly from the minor cadence without transitions to the tonic, as in the early Sonata in Bb (Hob. XVI:18) by Haydn (see Example 4). Such elisions suggest that eighteenth-century retransitions were optional appendages to the develop- ment, welcome but not vital. Koch himself hedges his prescription: after the cadence on vi, 'the third period [reprise] usually begins again with the opening theme [. . .] in the tonic; or one may bring vi to a close in this second period [development] but [.. .] join it to a transition back to the tonic'.66 One can infer from Koch's ambivalence that good tonic preparation was less pertinent to eighteenth-century ears than clear tex- tural signposting and, more importantly, than modal resolution from minor to major. It seems that this resolution could be effected equally well by, on the one hand, a shift from minor-mode passagework to the retransition proper, and, on the other hand, from minor-mode passage- work directly to the reprise. In other words, texture and rhetoric can and do signify closure without our knowledge of the original tonic. If so, then the cadential material at the end of the development is, in real terms, just as much a 'retransition' as the retransition proper. The sonata thus has two retransitions, a 'false' one in the minor and a 'true' one en- ding in the major. Remember, the false retransition does not necessarily sound false at the time. A listener familiar with the practice of eliding smooth transitions to the tonic might expect the false retransition to lead immediately to the recapitulation. I suggest, therefore, that my double- retransition model plays with listener expectations in the manner of the conventional false reprise. I shall argue that Haydn achieves his sense of closure by means of a local-level antecedent-consequent structure, akin to a thematic period. This tensing/relaxing rhetoric of closure is very much at odds with the teleological, 'Beethovenian' conception of the retransition as 'the climax of music'. Shamgar shows that nineteenth-century theorists, in response Example 4. Haydn, Keyboard Sonata in Bb, Hob. XVI:18, first move- ment, bars 72-6. 72 i # (p * 6 Versuch einer Anteitung, 224.</page><page sequence="20">30 MICHAEL SPITZER to Beethoven's more dramatic pieces, viewed the retransition as the climac- tic point of the development.'67 After Haydn, the boundary between the development and retransition is dissolved, and the retransition is iden- tified with dominant preparation and pedal points. For example, the development of Beethoven's 'Waldstein' Sonata reaches its tonal nadir on the Neapolitan chord of bar 134. Instead of marking this point with a cadence, Beethoven continues the flow of arpeggios and sideslips into an augmented-sixth preparation for a huge dominant pedal. Such 'heroic' retransitions are generally longer and more powerful than their eighteenth-century predecessors, and engender a stronger sense of an- ticipation. Yet compared with earlier double retransitions, these noisy signposts. are syntactically impoverished. The Eb sonata's double retransition is articulated by rhyming end-points. A five-bar pedal point on the dominant of F minor (bars 103-7) is answered by a six-bar pedal on the dominant seventh of Eb (bars 126-31). The two pedals support cadential material of very complementary character. The repetitive, square F minor figurations suggest a piano ap- proximation of a tutti (both hands are active); the Eb retransition tails off into a free cadenza (a suo piacere), with the left hand dropping out. The rhyme scheme thus unfolds a broad tutti-solo antiphony. Levy would say that these textures are distributed in the most effective order, since solos serve 'to "conduct" the action to a beginning'. Working our way from these end-points, we find that this parallelism is underscored by many other relationships. The dominants of F minor and Eb are both prepared by the same diminished seventh chord: B-D- F-Ab. At bar 102, the subset F-Ab-B resolves to V of F over a rising semitone in the bass, B-C. The full chord emerges at bar 122 and resolves to V7 of Eb over a falling bass semitone, B-BL. Thus the double retran- sition is framed by the same kind of'large-scale reciprocal relation' that Baker finds in Mozart's K.333 (see above). Interestingly, Haydn also uses the same pitches as Mozart for his frame: B-C answered by B-BL. The former progression is 'marked' (in Hatten's sense) because it resolves over an octave above the low Bb' set up at the end of the exposition. The resolu- tion at bar 125 sounds truer because it recaptures the register of that BL'. Perhaps such registral salience plays a form-building role over and above its function in global voice-leading connections. Notice, by the way, that the B of bar 102 is 'marked' (because deviant) while the B' of bar 123 is 'salient' (because registrally extreme).68 67 'Moving ahead to nineteenth-century treatises, we discover a significant change in the harmonic role of the retransition. For the first time, theorists associate the retransition with the dominant pedal. This linkage coincides with two basic changes in the nature of the open- ing border: theorists no longer identify the end of the development with a cadence, and [. . .] they now locate the start of the retransition at the onset of the dominant pedal' (Shamgar, 'On Locating the Retransition', 133). 68 For another example of a double retransition, see Haydn's Piano Sonata in Ab, Hob. XVI:43, bars 77-100. A half close in F minor (bar 87) rhymes with a cadenza on V of Ab (bars 93ff.). The two dominants, C and Eb, are prepared with an identical bass line: E-F-A-BL-B-C (bars 77-83) and G-Ab-C-Db-D-Eb (bars 90-3). The FIE4 melodic crux at the halfway stage, bar 87, is reinterpreted as F-Es immediately before the reprise, bar 99. At 11 and 13 bars respec- tively, the two retransitions are broadly parallel.</page><page sequence="21">THE RETRANSITION AS SIGN 31 As stated above, there is no reason to think that clear-cut parallelisms and longer-range voice-leading connections cannot be accommodated by the same theory. In fact, it is possible to show that the double retran- sition's rhyming scheme is actually reinforced by extensive linear pro- gressions (see Example 5). V of F is prepared by a 20-bar descent from C to E, prolonging C, the upper neighbour to the development's Kopf ton. V of E1 is prepared by a 20-bar ascent from C to Ab. The first pro- gression stalls on a C for seven bars, elaborated by a Db neighbour, before beginning its descent; the second progression prolongs C for seven and a half bars, again toying with the Db before returning to it as part of its ascent. Schenker's well-known graph of this sonata downgrades these parallelisms: he relegates the C-E descent to a local elaboration within a global rising progression, unfolding bb' to ab" (see Example 6).69 The Example 5.

From a Schenkerian perspective, my inter- pretation thus confuses two discrete structural levels. Nevertheless, the variety of textural and harmonic relationships between the two sections, together with the intervening caesura, argues for an audible double- retransition structure. In fact, the rhetorical opposition between rising and falling thirds, C-E and C-A, (in this case, inverted into falling and rising sixths) is also the premiss of the first subject: G-B,, G-EL (see Ex- ample 7). Ultimately, then, the double retransition may be interpreted as a submediant prolongation of the tonic Grundgestalt. Unfortunately, it is doubtful whether grounding a 50-bar formal unit in a motivic premiss is psychologically any more realistic than Schenker's reading of the development-cum-retransition as an unfolding of a dominant seventh. Both analogies commit what Goodman calls a 'category mistake', the misapplication of a predicate appropriate to one structural level to an unwarranted level: 'a term with an extension established by habit is applied elsewhere under the influence of that habit'.70 The most that bars 84-132 have in common with the first-subject incipit is contour: the Example 7.

Maybe we do hear these oscillations in the spirit of bars 1-2. Similarly, the dominant seventh of bar 126 can be assimilated to the dominant prolongation of the exposition and development only because both are tonally unstable. But we hear them as unstable in dif- ferent ways: the dominant prolongation tenses away from the tonic while the dominant seventh relaxes towards the tonic. STRING QUARTET IN Eb, OP. 64 NO. 6 This quartet recalls the early Bb sonata examined earlier, which skipped from a cadence on VI to the recapitulation with only a link scale by way of tonic preparation. The current example is more radical still, dispensing with all mediating progressions (see Example 8). The domi- nant of one key confronts the tonic of another across a caesura, creating a jarring harmonic non sequitur (bars 97-8). But the dislocation also em- braces dynamic, registral and modal parameters. After a dramatic pause, we drop down from forte to piano, fall a tenth registrally, and shift from minor to major. How justified are we in viewing this reprise as a 'resolu- tion' in any normal sense of the word? In the earlier example, we were content to accept the minor-mode retransition on the strength of its tex- tural and rhetorical profile alone and overlook the elided preparation. This quartet provides an opportunity to consider the implications of such elisions at greater depth. The first tonic cadence of the recapitulation is deferred till bars 117-18. I suggest that we rhyme the half close in C minor and the full close in Eb as, respectively, deceptive and real cadences, with the ostensible recapitulation as a parenthesis. The double-retransition model we ex- plored in the Eb sonata is thereby shifted so as to encompass the reprise instead of preceding it. The true retransition, which corrects the faulty minor-mode retransition, thus occupies the position we usually call the 'secondary development'. On this basis, we can now pair bars 88-97 and 109-18 as 'false' and 'true' retransitions according to the same listener-orientated principles as in the Eb piano sonata. The tonic cadence at bars 117-18 is a diminu- tion of the first cadence, reworking the minim GIF# sequence (motive X) as repetitions of a crotchet EWID figure (motive X'). Note the elegant way in which Haydn reverses the top and bottom voices of the cadence: at bar 95 the accompanying quaver figures are below while at bar 118 the triplet figures are above. The cadences are also framed by reciprocal tonal relations. The G pedal of bar 95 is prepared by an augmented sixth chord, with Ab, G and F4 resolving in contrary motion. The same chord is outlined at bar 115, with Ab and F# all transferred to the first violin. The G major chord of bar 116 is then assimilated into a smooth cycle of fifths, retrospectively 'correcting' the non sequitur of bars 97-8. This cycle pivots on the Ab-Bb dominant preparation of bar 117, a reversal of the Ab-G bass progression of bar 94. In addition, both retransitions are ten bars long, and both circumscribe a compass of an octave plus a tritone.

Haydn's frame is pinned in place by the structural tritones F4/C at bars 94-6 and AC/D at bar 117. Haydn reinforces these 'rare intervals' with textural and rhythmic emphasis. Moreover, he nests the cadences in two further levels of tritone relations. The second level, that of melodic com- pass, has already been mentioned: gb'-c" is answered by ab"-d'. The third level is that of key progression: witness the astonishing modula- tion from Gb major to C minor in bars 88-94. The primary, cadential level raises some important questions about the dependence of tritone cues on scale-step and pitch. An antecedent tensing progression in bars 94-7, F4/C-GIB, is answered by a consequent relaxing progression in bars 117-19, ACID-G/Eb. Can half and full closes in different keys relate to each other along lines similar to the cadential structure of a melodic period in a single key? In other words, can reciprocal tensing/relaxing relations hold between tritone cues in the absence of tonal support? If so, how far apart in time can the cadences be separated for the connec- tion to remain effective? Would the connection be less effective if the first cadence were in any key other than the submediant? These thoughts take us back to Gjerdingen's writings on the 1-7... 4-3 melodic schema. The fundamental question is whether schematic cues, normally employed at a local level at the opening of thematic groups, can regulate our perception of formal closure at larger levels. I will argue that the quartet's double retransition unfolds the two halves of a 1-7... 4-3 schema, dislocated, transposed into different keys and widely separated in time. Despite this, the tensing and relaxing caden- tial qualities of the two events are strong enough to survive this loosen- ing of tonal reference. Another way of saying this is that, while our sense of tonal centricity might decay over time, our sensitivity to the 'character' of cadences is more stable. A gesture may sound conclusive in any key. The G major chord of bar 97 is established by the tritone C-F4 resolv- ing onto the dyad B-G. We can normalize this into the initial event of a 1-7... 4-3 schema, C-B (see Example 9). This would call for the stan- dard terminal 4-3 dyad, F-Ey. In the event, the schema is actually com- pleted by a transposed version of this 4-3 dyad, the Ab-G of bar 109, reinforced at bar 118 with a recollection of the reiterated cadence pat- tern from bars 95-7. Such forceful marking for consciousness helps us connect cues which are normally only about four bars apart (in Gjer- dingen's estimation, about five seconds, the threshold for short-term memory). Another method of chunking schema information into larger bites is to 'rehearse' events. Note the elegant way Haydn enchains successive 4-3 dyads in bars 88-95, thus unfolding a modulation from GL major to C minor (a tritone) by means of constituent tritones (see Example 10). This 'modulating' schema effects a neat substitution in which the notes of the C-F4 dyad exchange roles: by rights, the F4 in bar 94 should carry the 4-3 resolution, coming after the FM of the previous bar.

Such reinterpretation is a well-known feature of tritone relationships. The 1-7... 4-3 schema also illuminates Haydn's choice of key, that is, why the relative minor is so appropriate as the key of the false retran- sition. The interval of a third between submediant and tonic allows simultaneous transpositions of initial and terminal schema cues to be spliced together. The regular 4-3 consequent to C-B (F-Eb) is nested beneath the transposed consequent (Ab-G), easily accommodated by the harmony (see Example 11). Conversely, the submediant 1-7 (C-B) sup- ports the cover-notes Eb-D, the regular 1-7 to the tonic 4-3 (Ab-G). This reciprocal schematic relationship, intersecting across the caesura, helps glue the two retransitions together. We see therefore that the submediant Example 11.

The quartet fully exploits the syntactic implications of common-note relations in the form of interlock- ing schematic cues. The symmetries I have disclosed in the sonata and quartet seem to speak for themselves: the old master-narrative of disconfirmation followed by consonance. But this assumption is fraught with difficulties. Actually, the 'false' and 'true' progressions are not strictly commensurable, at least not in the sense of a half and full close in a thematic period. Moving now from a structural to a historical standpoint, we will see below that the V/vi-I retransition is perfectly at home in the Baroque idiom, bearing no stigma of incompleteness or 'falseness'. This turns the problem on its head: the dominant elision produces the Baroque overtones through which, in turn, it is interpreted as stable. The two tonic preparations do not connect directly with each other but rather to their immediate con- texts, respectively Baroque and Classical. Thus the progressions relate to each other only on the level of a stylistic system. The V/vi-I retransi- tion is not 'false' so much as stylistically marked with respect to the pro- totypical Classical resolution. The doublelframed retransition in the sonata and quartet engage us in a paradigm-shift between styles - a kind of 'code-switching' whereby we modulate our listening strategy in line with the music's historical reference. We have better narratives to describe this switch other than 'tension followed by resolution', such as the old/new, CatholiclEnlightenment or darkness/light tropes exemplified by Mozart's 'Dissonance' Quartet and Haydn's Creation. Agawu calls the archetypal topics which constitute such plots 'Ur-topics that abstractly embody the properties of each topical class'."7 But these stylistic units may actually refer to nothing other than ways of hearing. The last part of my article pursues this idea of code-switching. I argue that code-switching obtains not only between the V/vi-I retransition and its Classical variety, but also within the V/vi-I retransition itself. It too could be interpreted in both an old and a new way. III The juxtaposition of major triads a third apart is a common feature of Renaissance and Baroque music. A cadence on the third or sixth degree in Ionian, Lydian or Mixolydian modes could be immediately followed by a triad on the first degree. Francesco Gasparini's L'armonico pratico al cimbalo (1708) clearly connects this progression with the older modal practice of church music: Sometimes the composition forms a kind of cadence, coming to rest on a note with its major third, and then makes a new start, moving to the third below. This is found in sacred as well as secular vocal compositions, both for the chamber and for the theater, in which it is used to end an interrogative or "71 Playing with Signs, 90.</page><page sequence="29">THE RETRANSITION AS SIGN 39 explanatory phase and then to begin the next; it is usually found in the serious style or recitative [see Example 12].72 The middle movement of the Third Brandenburg Concerto provides the most familiar example of this cadence: the piece outlines iv6-Vg of E minor, thus preparing the subsequent G major tonality of the finale with a V/vi-I progression. The progression could be used to great theatrical effect, as in the chorus 'Since by man came death' from Handel's Messiah. The opening phrase ends on chord V of A minor, and is directly followed by a resolution to C major. Handel and Bach also like to des- cend a third after full closes. We find comparable tonal shifts in arias between 'trio' sections and da capos (e.g. D to BL in 'Shepherd, what art thou pursuing' from Acis and Galatea) and in concertos between interlude and final ritornello (e.g. B to G in Brandenburg 4/i, bar 344).

The Agnus dei of his 1773 Missa Sanctae Caeciliae ends on a half-cadence in A minor, and the Dona nobis enters with the tonic C major, producing a V/vi-I progression. The last Haydn opera to de- pend on da capo arias is Acide of 1762. Yet Haydn works in the da capo aria's characteristic tonal shift, in the guise of the V/vi-I retransition, into binary or sonata-form arias as late as 1773, in L'infedeltd delusa (see Example 13). Mary Hunter has argued that expanded da capo arias such as these can be understood only in relation to dramatic characterization: serious styles tend to be given to the parti serie.73 L'infedeltd delusa, however, is a comic pastoral opera, and Filippo and Vespina, the singers of the two arias, are 'contadini' (rustics). It is not possible rigidly to identify archaic procedures with seria styles or topoi. The V/vi-I retransition, as a relic of the past, undoubtedly carried around it an archaic or religious aura. It was flavoured with modal har- mony and contrapuntal texture. It is equally clear, however, that associa- tions are susceptible to changing fashions. According to James Webster, around 1770 the progression was reinvented as an 'alternative domi- nant'.74 Perhaps Haydn's resort to the mediant major as tonic prepara- 72 Francesco Gasparini, The Practical Harmonist at the Harpsichord, trans.

The point, therefore, is that a once-archaic convention was turned around in the 1770s into a very forward-looking one. Composers relished the jarring, dramatic effect that this progression achieved, grati- fying their public's new taste for irony. Mark Evan Bonds has recently drawn links between Haydn's use of irony and the enormous success at that time of Sterne's Tristram Shandy: Through a variety of techniques, usually categorized as 'humorous,' both Sterne and Haydn succeeded in calling attention to the very artificiality of their works. The resulting subversion of aesthetic illusion, in turn, led to a sense of ironic distance between the artist, his work, and his audience.7" Bonds argues that, by flagrantly violating conventions of formal closure and continuity, Haydn asserted his authorial presence both within and outside the work. Of the many techniques of disruption at Haydn's disposal, Bonds singles out the dramatic interruption and the unexpected reprise (the return of the Trio within the Finale of Haydn's Symphony no. 46 in B major is an excellent example)."77 A strong case could also be made for the elliptical V/vi-I retransition as an 'ironic' device. To accuse this type of retransition of weakness or inadequacy is entirely to miss the point, since, in accordance with Jean Paul's concept of 'an- nihilation', 'what is destroyed is nothing less than the perception of the art-work [ . . .] as a finite, self-sufficient entity'.78 By reinterpreting a Baroque progression as a token of Romantic Irony, Haydn effected a paradigm shift between what M. H. Abrams terms 'pragmatic' and 'ex- pressive' conceptions of art.79 The archaic idiom was self-effacing; the ironic voice was self-projecting. Curiously, this distinction is consonant with Janet Levy's anthropomorphizing of unison (impersonal) and solo (subjective) textures. The elliptical retransition, hitherto associated with archaic or religious genres, was used by Haydn in the modern, 'ironic' fashion in 11 first- movement sonata forms between 1770 and 1802 (pace the quasi-Baroque Harmoniemesse; see Table 1). The table reveals one striking pattern: after initial flirtations with II-I and VII-I resolutions, Haydn keeps exclusively to III-I, that is, the V/vi-I retransition. It is not clear why Haydn gravitated towards a standard practice. After all, the VII-I retransition is perfectly 5 See Rosen, The Classical Style, 382-3. 'By op. 31 no. 1 [Beethoven] ventures to dispense with the dominant as a secondary tonality altogether: from G major he goes to the mediant B.' The 'Waldstein' also modulates to the mediant (from C to E). 76 Mark Evan Bonds, 'Haydn, Laurence Sterne, and the Origins of Musical Irony',Journal of the American Musicological Society, 44 (1991), 57-91 (p. 58). 77 For a disruption-orientated analysis of this symphony, see Bonds, Wordless Rhetoric, 192-204. Webster (Haydn's 'Farewell' Symphony, 267-87) offers another interpretation, based on 'the meaning of musical reminiscence'. 78 Bonds, 'Haydn, Laurence Sterne, and the Origins of Musical Irony', 63. 79 Meyer Howard Abrams, The Mirror and the Lamp: Romantic Theory and the Critical Tradition (New York, 1953), introduction.</page><page sequence="32">42 MICHAEL SPITZER TABLE 1 HAYDN'S ELLIPTICAL RETRANSITIONS IN FIRST-MOVEMENT SONATA FORMS 1771-1802 location tonal secondary remarks disposition development 1771 Symphony no. 43 in Eb, 160-2 II-I 189-96 FIEC voice-exchange (bass and violin 1, bars 189-94); II deflections, bars 179-86 1773 Piano Sonata, Hob.

XVI:25).80 One possible answer is that, while any juxtaposition would be practicable, the III-I resolution represented a point of intersection between the old (the 'Gasparini cadence') and the new (proto-Beethovenian 'substitute dominants'). It provided Haydn with a comfortable, prototypical groove to slip into. A different sort of answer is given by David Beach, in his study of the V/vi-I retransition in Mozart's piano sonatas.81 Beach takes a classical- ly Schenkerian line and manages to show that, in situations where the connecting dominant between III# and I is missing (or only passing), 'the return to the tonic is accomplished by a large-scale bass arpeggiation of the tonic triad, the members of which support the harmonic progres- sion V-III#-I'.82 The mediant supports a consonant passing note within the dominant harmony, either passing from the 2 at the end of the ex- position up to the cadential dominant seventh (2-3-4) or descending to the primary note from its chromatic upper neighbour (e.g. Cj-C in K.2801iii). This progression occurs in 12 of Mozart's 27 sonata movements that are in a major key and have a sonata-allegro design. Beach thinks that Mozart's special interest in the V-III#-I arpeggiation is motivated by thematic factors; in his view, the progression composes out triadic material stated at the outset of the movement. It might be added, however, that Beach's own resort to the bass arpeggiation as an explanatory model is itself motivated by Schenker's familiar schema for minor-mode sonata forms (I-III-V). Baker simply inverts it and applies it in a major mode. In this case, the model is subject to the caveats and provisos about long- range tonal hearing raised earlier in this article. Webster is less happy than Baker with the adequacy of the V/vi-I retran- sition and all other kinds of 'unusual and weak preparations for the reprise'.8 In his view, these retransitions 'usually relate to larger issues in the same movements, and often lead to an outright blurring of the boundary between development and reprise'.84 His argument squares with the premiss of my analysis of the EL quartet, that secondary developments - encompassing what I called 'true retransitions' - are compensations for inadequate preparations. This approach can be ex- tended to all 11 works with elided preparations; Table 1 includes brief remarks on the retransitions' tonal and thematic repercussions. We therefore see that the V/vi-I retransition is subject to at least four distinct types of interpretation. Disagreements over its status, efficacy and provenance diverge along structural and historical axes. Structural- ly, it can be used as a casual convention, innocent of far-reaching con- textual resonance. Alternatively, it could be employed strategically as an " Similarly, Beethoven recalls Haydn's II-I retransition (Symphony no. 43 in Eb) in two other Eb works. His Piano Sonata op. 31 no. 3 and String Quartet op. 127 both approach their recapitulations from F minor. 8 David Beach, 'A Recurring Pattern in Mozart's Music', Journal of Music Theory, 27 (1983), 1-30. 8 Ibid., 1. s Haydn's 'Farewell' Symphony, 138. 8 Ibid., 144.</page><page sequence="34">44 MICHAEL SPITZER integral part of an artistic conception. It might suit the composer to make us believe that a secondary development/true retransition is instigated by a prior, weak resolution. But the latter is not so different from the episodes in a sonata rondo - fresh departures rather than repercussions. On the historical side, the device can be heard as either archaic (Bar- oque) or ironic (Classical). The former accords well with relational or evolutionary progressions between opposing styles. The latter, however, militates against the very principle of relational hearing, in so far as Romantic Irony questions the whole notion of formal integrity or con- tinuity. It would be wrong at this juncture to settle on any normative definitions, because the virtue of the retransition consists in the latitude it provides composer or listener to compose or listen a suo piacere. The device's fourfold coding opens up ample semantic space to accom- modate a range of competencies, persuasions and experience. The bot- tom line of any listener-orientated approach to music must be libertarian. But what are the constraints? 'Improvisatory' perspectives on composi- tion and analysis nowadays gravitate towards the fertile soil of perfor- mance theory.85 But there are other viable directions for future study. I will close with two examples, taken from literary theories of metaphor and sociolinguistic studies of conversational power-play. It is well attested that listeners shift focus and strategy from moment to moment, at their convenience and as the situation demands.86 Ex- perimental evidence for this, however, is restricted to non-volitional, foun- dational levels which are not accessible to introspection, or else to theoretical models far removed from the messy realities of complex scores. Perhaps a listener-orientated approach to the retransition as metaphor affords a workable middle ground where cognitive scientists and music critics can meet. Paul Ricoeur defines the metaphoric imagination as 'stereoscopic vision', 'the ability to entertain two different points of view at the same time'.87 If the conventional use of a device is its 'literal' sense, then its contextualization within a compositional strategy gives it a second-order, metaphoric extension. In Ricoeur's interaction theory of metaphor, the original reference is suspended but not abolished, sound- ing through the second-order reference in creative tension. Ricoeur derives this principle from Wittgenstein's 'seeing as' effect, the capacity to see a given configuration first as one thing then as another at will.88 For example, we can see the famous rabbit/duck figure alternately as rabbit and duck. Wittgenstein's esprit helps us understand the special nature of artistic meaning. According to Marcus B. Hester, 'metaphorical "see- ing as" is a seeing as between the metaphorical subject and the 85 See Eric Clarke, 'Improvisation, Cognition and Education', Companion to Contemporary Musical Thought, ed. Paynter et al., 787-802. 86 See Alan Marsden and Anthony Pople, 'Modelling Musical Cognition as a Community of Experts', Contemporary Music Review, 3 (1989), 29-42. 87 Paul Ricoeur, 'The Metaphorical Process as Cognition, Imagination, and Feeling', Philosophical Perspectives on Metaphor, ed.

The insights engendered by a good compositional metaphor induce the same sort of Gestalt switch as in the flash between rabbit and duck: what I call a 'hearing as' effect. The retransition can be 'heard as' casual or intentional, archaic or ironic. The listener's negotiation with the eighteenth-century 'Universe of Topic',90 that is, the panoply of Baroque and Classical musical languages, is not so different from his interaction within a living speech community. In both, the ability to shift with ease from one dialect, style or register to another is a peculiarly pragmatic kind of competence, akin to 'good manners' - knowing how to behave. Susan Gal defines code- switching as a 'conventional strategy used to establish, cross or destroy group boundaries; to create or change interpersonal relations with their rights and obligations'."' A very common method of implicating ourselves in power relationships is to make a pronominal choice between polite and informal forms of addressing each other ('vous'I'tu'; 'Lei'I'tu'; 'Sie'I'du'). 'Vous' and 'tu', etc., are markers, respectively, of politeness and solidarity (English has its own mechanisms for suggesting this distinc- tion). Reciprocal relations aim ultimately towards solidarity, and because solidarity is so important, it usually falls on the elder or more powerful party to initiate a change of address. Ronald Wardhaugh, in his study 'Solidarity and Politeness', observes that Germans who have come to know each other quite well often make almost a little ceremony (Briiderschaft trinken) of the occasion when they decide to say du to each other rather than Sie. Usually, on such occasions it is the superior in the relationship who initiates the change. Once a pair of speakers decide on mutual T [tu], it is almost impossible to go back to either TIV [tu/vous] or V[V [vous/vous] usage.92 The listener's phenomenological engagement with the composer's voice undergoes a similar, irreversible, courtship ritual. A work can enshrine a codeswitch from exclusive to inclusive relations with its audience within a symbolic economy. The doublelframed retransition is one of the ways in which the Classical style institutionalizes such a ritual. Listeners who are daunted by the formality of the initial, archaic resolution, and then gratified by the more relaxed Classical retransition, are participating in a ceremony of Briiderschaft h6ren.
