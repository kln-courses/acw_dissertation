<plain_text><page sequence="1">Usher's Hyp ochondriasis: Mental Alienation and Romantic Idealism in Poe's Gothic Tales DAVID W. BUTLER University of Kentucky O N THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS the narrator of "The Fall of the House of Usher" refers to Roderick as a "hypochondriac."' It seems odd that he should do so, since he never expresses the slightest doubt that Roderick is really sick: indeed upon greeting Usher the narrator is shocked by his boyhood friend's "terribly altered" appear- ance (III, 278). The apparent contradiction is explained, however, when we realize that the narrator, who lays claim to some knowledge of "the history of mental disorder" (III, 292) is using the term in its medical rather than its popular sense. Although he is at least initially unaware of the broad ramifications which the disease has acquired in Usher's world, he has correctly diagnosed Roderick's peculiar com- bination of physical and mental complaints as symptomatic of hypo- chondriasis, a melancholic disorder which has been recognized for centuries and which was widely discussed among physicians in Poe's own time. The issue is of more than passing interest, since the failure of modern critics to identify Usher's illness correctly has obscured one of the most important themes in Poe's story: for only when we discover the exact nature of Usher's disease can we fully appreciate the rich parallels which Poe's tale develops between medical theories about the progressive derangement of the mind and romantic theories about the growth of the mind's perceptive powers.2 1 James A. Harrison, ed., The Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe (New York, 1902), III, 283, 287, 292. All further quotation of Poe is from the Harrison edition. 2 The only other discussion I have encountered which purports to explain Roderick's illness in contemporary medical terms is I. M. Walker's argument that Roderick is plainly the victim of miasmatic poisoning, of the noxious effects of the "atmosphere" which his environment exhales ("The 'Legitimate Sources' of Terror in 'The Fall of the House of Usher,'" Modern Language Review, LXI, Oct., I966, 585-592). Although one of the passages which Walker himself quotes suggests similarities between the two diseases (p. 589), he never indicates that all the symptoms of miasmatic poisoning which he finds in Roderick, and several of Usher's other symptoms as well, are subsumed by the medical descriptions of hypochondriasis; nor does Walker seem aware that the literature on hypochondriasis accounts much more fully than does that to which he refers for the variety of possible causes, whether physical or mental, bodily or environmental, which</page><page sequence="2">2 Acmerican Literature Before discussing the complex case of Roderick Usher, however, some background material is necessary: we must see how the doctors of Poe's time viewed the broad relationship between mental alien- ation and imaginative insight, and how Poe himself approached the problem in some of his less medically intricate Gothic tales. Interestingly, the doctors saw a connection between the imaginative power which characterizes romantics like Usher and actual madness. Benjamin Rush, a well-known American doctor who was among the signers of the Declaration of Independence, follows the lead of the famous French psychiatrist Phillippe Pinel in arguing that "poets, painters, sculptors and musicians" are far more prone to madness than chemists, naturalists, mathematicians, or natural philosophers.3 Moreover, it was commonly thought that insanity could increase artistic ability. Rush cites the case of a young woman who acquired talent as a lyricist and singer as her disease reached its latter stages, and also claims knowledge of two cases in which an aptitude for drawing was similarly evolved from madness (pp. 153-I54). The renowed phrenologist J. G. Spurzheim agrees that creative artists are more inclined to insanity than mathematicians and refers to a violinist whose compositions were bettered by insanity. The case is particularly reminiscent of Usher's "wild improvisations" upon his "speaking guitar": "Dr. Cox speaks of a professor in music, whose talents for music seemed even improved; his ideas executed on the violin were wonderfully striking, singular and original, but on other subjects he reasoned absurdly."4 But while they recognized a relationship between the power of the creative imagination and insanity, Poe's medical contemporaries denied that the mad artist might actually achieve authentic private visions of a transcendent order. Complete madness was thought to depend upon faith in the reality of the hallucinatory, or what Rush Poe's tale seems to suggest for Usher's disease. Miasmatic poisoning may aggravate Roderick's disorder, and Walker's article is valuable for the research which it offers in support of that possibility. But to insist that miasma is necessarily the source and defining factor of Usher's illness is as arbitrary as are Walker's corollary contentions that Poe's rich term "atmosphere" must be construed only as a reference to a material vapor, and that Poe's conception of the "legitimate sources" of terror must have excluded the transcendent or supernatural. 3 Medical Inquiries and Observations, upon the Diseases of the Mind (Philadelphia, I8I2; rpt. New York, I962), pp. 63-64. 4 Observations on Deranged Manifestations of Mind, or, Insanity (n.p., I8I7), pp. 148, 98.</page><page sequence="3">Hypochondriasis in Poe's Gothic Tales 3 calls "erroneous perception" (p. I47), and Spurzheim the "incapacity of distinguishing the diseased functions of the mind" (pp. 7I-72). John Conolly, another famous physician, sums up this typical view of madness: "In numerous instances the hallucination of the sense arises from an imagination previously over-excited; that over- excitement is disease, but not madness; it produces an hallucination, but if the hallucination is known to be an hallucination, still there is no madness; if it is mistaken for reality, then the man is mad."5 The criterion for error in perception is of course the sensory ex- perience of other individuals. As Conolly puts it, insanity is a "defect in the comparing faculty," so that one way to avoid complete madness is to compare one's own sense impressions with those of other people (pp. 300, 309, 3I4-3I5). Such a definition of insanity clearly makes no allowance for that individual insight into the super- natural toward which the romantic idealist struggled and which, like Usher, he often sought to express in artistic form. The physicians of Poe's time were in this respect closer to Locke than to Coleridge. They in no way distinguished between hallucination and the possi- bility that the romantic imagination could break through the bounds of ordinary perception to a higher order. The moment of romantic triumph, in which the individual imagination succeeded in idealizing the real, was in medical terms the moment at which a nervous dis- order turned to complete delusion. Like the doctors, Poe saw a connection between creativity and madness, but it is by no means clear that he shared in the alienists' refusal to credit private experiences of the transcendent or super- natural. Indeed the continuing conflict between psychological and mystical explications of Poe's Gothic tales6 suggests that in many of these stories the natural and the supernatural, or the scientific and the romantically idealistic, are deliberately paralleled rather than cautiously distinguished. The puzzle which Poe's Gothic fiction 5An Inquiry Concerning the Indications of Insanity (London, 1830), p. 307. 6 That this persistent conflict has emerged as a major and unresolved theme of Poe criticism becomes evident upon examining two recent books on Poe: G. R. Thompson's Poe's Fiction: Romantic Irony in the Gothic Tales (Madison, Wis., 1973) expands the argument that the seemingly supernatural events in the Gothic stories are merely hallucinations on the part of characters within them, usually the narrators themselves; David R. Halliburton's Edgar Allan Poe: A Phenomenological View (Princeton, N.J., I973) elaborates the opposite interpretation, which insists that these startling events are to be read as actual occurrences.</page><page sequence="4">4 American Literature seems repeatedly to pose, and which modern criticism has yet to resolve, is that described by the narrator of "Eleonora": I am come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of passion. Men have called me mad; but the question is not yet settled, whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence-whether much that is glorious- whether all that is profound-does not spring from disease of thought- from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect. They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night. In their grey visions they obtain glimpses of eternity, and thrill, in awaking, to find that they have been upon the verge of the great secret. We will say, then that I am mad. I grant, at least, that there are two distinct conditions of my mental existence-the condition of a lucid reason, not to be disputed, and belonging to the memory of events forming the first epoch of my life-and a condition of shadow and doubt, appertaining to the present, and to the recollection of what constitutes the second great era of my being. Therefore, what I shall tell of the earlier period, believe; and to what I may relate of the later time, give only such credit as may seem due; or doubt it altogether; or, if doubt it ye cannot, then play unto its riddle the Oedipus. (IV, 236-237) The first period of the narrator's life is that in which he loves Eleonora as a living woman. The second is that in which he adores "the ethereal Ermengarde," whom he implicitly envisions as a spiritualized reincarnation of his earlier love. In "Eleonora," as in "Ligeia" and "Morella," the rebirth or reincarnation of the beloved suggests that the romantic idealist may, mad though he be, finally achieve some success in his quest for a higher meaning. If the rebirth is actual and not hallucinatory, then the protagonist's imagination, what Coleridge calls the "esemplastic power,"' succeeds in idealizing his earthly mistress: if his beloved indeed passes through the tomb, then his sensual affection is transmuted into a bond with the super- 7 Biographia Literaria, xiii. The connections between Poe's and Coleridge's theories about the mind's creative and idealizing powers have long been recognized. See, for example, Floyd Stovall's "Poe's Debt to Coleridge," University of Texas Studies in English, X (July, I930), 70-I27. In I836, just three years before he published "Usher," Poe referred to the Biographia Literaria as possibly "the most deeply interesting of the prose writings of Coleridge," and indicated that those who would undertake a domestic re- publication of the work would be "rendering an important service to the cause of psy- chological science in America" (IX, 52).</page><page sequence="5">Hypochondriasis in Poe's Gothic Tales 5 natural.8 It is in the light of the connection which tales like "Eleonora" and "Ligeia" suggest between madness and the idealizing faculty that we can most profitably examine the role which Roderick's hypochondria plays in "The Fall of the House of Usher." Like the narrators of these tales, Roderick is a madman whose imaginative powers may actually increase as his mind sickens; and as in the other fictions the idealizing capacities of those powers are seemingly confirmed by supernatural events reaching their climax at the end of the tale and involving, although in the Ushers' realm the family mansion plays a part as well, the apparent rebirth of a woman to whom the madman has been closely allied. But if "Usher" is similar to some of Poe's other Gothic tales in that it suggests links between the knowledge of the alienists and the theories of the idealists, it transcends all of them in the fullness with which those suggestions are developed: nowhere else does Poe so effectively demonstrate the close similarities between contemporary romantic and medical thought. Since hypochondriasis was thought to involve the interaction of mind and body, it offered a superb medical analogy to the romantic's concern with the bonds between the internal, subjective realm and the external world of physical objects. The value of the illness as a parallel to the romantic belief in the intimate interrelationship of mind and matter was further enhanced by the inability of con- temporary physicians to agree upon the location of the seat of the disorder in their attempts to explain its psychosomatic operations. Dr. James Johnson, writing in I827, argues that the malady inevitably affects the digestive system, and through that influences the mind. But as he points out, localizing the disease was as much a problem in his own day as it had been for the physicians of bygone eras.9 Dr. Ralph Fletcher, writing just a few years after about the effects of the mind upon the body, maintains that hypochondriasis may sometimes be centered in the intellect, and that the physical symp- toms may be wholly the creations and not the causes of mental 8 For the development of this reading I am indebted, with many other current critics of Poe's work, to Richard Wilbur's "The House of Poe" (Libr-ary of Congress Anniversary Lectures 1959, rpt. in Robert Regan, c(l., Poe: A Collection of Critical Essays, Englewoodl Cliffs, N.J., I967, pp. 98-I20). 9, An Essay on Morbid Sensitivity of the Stomach and Bowels as the Pr-oximate Cause, or Characteristic Condition of Indigestion, Nervous lIritability, Mental Despondency, Hypochondriasis &amp;c. &amp;c. . . .

Moreover, he goes on to say that in some cases the original train of corporeal disorders in the digestive organs is masked, or almost entirely disappears, under the complicated sympathetic affections of remote parts. These sympathetic affections are of a mixed character, corporeal and mental. In proportion as the causes were of a physical nature, so will be the predominance of the sympathies:-And, on the other hand, in proportion as they were of a moral nature, so will the sympathetic dis- orders be of a predominant intellectual character. In general, however, they are mixed. (pp. 65-66) By suggesting both physical and "moral" causes for Roderick's hypochondria, Poe accurately reflects the medical controversy and the intimate relationship between mind and body which it implies. As the narrator tells us, Usher calls his malady "a constitutional and a family evil" (III, 280). The belief that the tendency to nervous disorder was hereditary was widespread among physicians in Poe's time, and educated readers would have recognized that in Usher's case this predisposition must have been particularly likely, since he is directly descended from a family noted "time out of mind" for its aberrant temperament (III, 275) ." Shortly after offering this physio- logical explanation for his disease, we are told, Usher adds that much of the gloom which attends the affliction, and which is reflected in his fear of the influence of the family mansion upon him, originates from the "long-continued illness" and "approaching dissolution" of the beloved Madeline (III, 28I). Again the detail is medically accurate. Rush lists a number of mental disorders which might result from the psychological cause of grief, one of which is hypochon- driasis (p. 3I8). The doctors' descriptions of the victims of the disease also offer close parallels to the conventional romantic qualities of Roderick's temperament. His "excessive and habitual" reserve (III, 275) is not 10 Sketches from the Case Book, to Illustrate the Influence of the Mind on the Body with the Treatment of Some of the More Impo-tant Br-ain &amp; Nervous Distutbances which Arise from this Influence (London, I833), p. 68. 11 According to Spurzheim the longer insanity "has existed in a family, and the greater the number of generations which have been affected, the greater is the danger" that the disease will be transmitted (p. I04).</page><page sequence="7">Hypochondriasis in Poe's Gothic Tales 7 only appropriate to the romantic, who conventionally disdains society as unsympathetic to any but material pursuits, but also to the true hypochondriac, who, as both Fletcher (pp. 58-60) and Johnson (p. 67) maintain, avoids his fellowmen for fear they will deride his debility. In addition, the malady was associated with the lack of active employment (Rush, pp. 77, 90, 92; Johnson, p. 68), with the cultivation of the mind over the body (Johnson, p. 63), and with the sensitivity of feeling and activeness of imagination which are so crucial a part of Usher's-and of the romantic's-personality. Fletcher says that hypochondriasis attacks "persons of deep and delicate feelings, whose expectations from human nature are too exalted," and introduces the subject of a case study of the disease as "a lady possessed of exquisite sensibility, a most luxuriant, vivid, and restless imagination" (pp. 69, 294). Even the "morbid acuteness of the senses" of which Usher complains, and which serves to under- score his romantic sensitivity, has its parallel in the medical descrip- tions of hypochondriasis. Rush quotes a letter from a hypochondriac in which the writer claims to suffer so much from acuteness of hearing that he habitually stops his ears with wax (p. 87), and Johnson states that, in the higher grades of the illness, "The nerves of sense . . . are morbidly susceptible to an astonishing degree. Thus, any sudden noise will make such an impression, as if the organ of hearing was distributed over the whole surface of the body" (pp. 66-67).12 It is, however, through the associations which he establishes be- tween Usher and his "house"-his dwelling, his ancestors, and his twin Madeline-that Poe most fully exploits the romantic implica- tions of hypochondriasis. Usher's "superstitious impressions" con- cerning his ancestral home and the sister he entombs within it are thoroughly in keeping with the symptoms of hypochondria. Early in the story he refers to those symptoms when he tells the narrator that he dreads the future, when he must "abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim phantasm, FEAR" (III, 12 Roderick's pallid countenance. which is interpreted by Walker as a sign of the effects of miasma (p. 589). can also be explained in terms of his hypochondriacal disorder. According to Rush (who believes that all mental derangement is primarily seated in cir- culatory disorders affecting the blood vessels of the brain), in the depressive phases of hypochondria the blood vessels are "robbed of nearly all their excitement" (p. 79). Rush also refers to a scientific experiment which associated a state of melancholic depression with an abnormall) slow pulse (pp. 20-21).</page><page sequence="8">8 American Literature 280). According to Rush, the characteristic mental symptom of hypochondriasis is "distress," the cause of which is an obsessive belief on the part of the sufferer that he is somehow threatened, either with regard to his person or his outward circumstances. Rush lists several examples of such obsessions, among which are the belief that one is afflicted by some specific disease, or that one has been possessed by the soul of some fellow creature (pp. 79-83). When Usher elaborates upon his fear it becomes apparent that, like his illness, it has much in common with the romantic and transcendental belief in the interrelationship of mind and matter. Immediately after singing his composition "The Haunted Palace" to the narrator,13 Usher describes an opinion closely linked to his obsessive terror. As the narrator tells it: This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest aban- don of his persuasion. The belief, however, was connected (as I have pre- viously hinted) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones-in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around-above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence-the evidence of the sentience-was to be seen, he said, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensa- tion of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terri- ble influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw him-what he was. (III, 286-287) Usher has previously spoken of the demoralizing influence which the strange "physique" of his family mansion has had upon him (III, 280-28i). But in stressing the relationship between the "ar- 13 The parallel between hypochondria and artistic ability which Poe develops fictionally in Usher's character is reflected in his later critical treatment of the writer Thomas Hood, whose genius Poe attributes to a "vivid Fancy impelled, or controlled,-certainly tinctured, at all points, by hypochondriasis" (XII, 2I7; see also 233-234). Soon after penning this statement Poe decided that he should have given Hoo(d credit for much more of the "true Imagination" (as opposed to mere "Fancy") than he had done: significantly the poem which inspired the revised judgment was Hood's "The Haunted House" (XII, 236-237; see also XIV, 284).</page><page sequence="9">Hypochondriasis in Poe's Gothic Tales 9 rangement" of that physique and the "sentience" Roderick indicates that the physical peculiarities of his house are, like the bodily pecu- liarities related to his own disorder, inseparably linked to intellectual forces. Moreover, just as the decadent physique of the house mirrors Usher's deteriorating physiognomy, so Roderick's discussion of the dwelling's oppressive sentience affords parallels to the melancholic qualities of his own mind. The "reduplicating" waters of the dismal tarn offer a superb correspondence to the Ushers' debilitating self- consciousness,14 and the "atmosphere" that Roderick sees as the "evidence" of the destructive sentience is powerfully reminiscent of the dark outpourings of his own intellect, which flow "forth upon all the objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom" (III, 282).15 Indeed so strong are the ties be- tween Roderick, his house, and his twin-with whom he also shares "sympathies" (III, 288-289) which go beyond the physical-that the three have become virtually the same organism, a single diseased consciousness and constitution;16 as the anthropomorphic structure in "The Haunted Palace" implies, the derangement which affects the Ushers is finally indistinguishable from the strange condition which affects their home. By dissolving the distinctions between the hypochondriacal Roderick and his environment, Poe posits a world in which the alienists' belief in the capacity of the mind to interact with the body which contains it, and the romantic idealists' faith in the capacity of the imagination to interact with the world around it, are no 14 That the reflective tarn functions as the "mind" of the Ushers' dwelling place has been suggested by Edward Davidson (Poe: A Critical Study, Cambridge, Mass., I957, p. I96), and several subsequent writers. 15 The parallel between Roderick's gloom and the "atmosphere" was noted long ago by Darrell Abel ("A Key to the House of Usher," University of Toronto Quarterly, XVIII, Jan., I949, I82). 16 Herbert Smith, to whom I am particularly indebted for my interest in Poe and science, has shown that Poe probably found a scientific source for his portrayal of Roderick's world as virtually a single living whole in Richard Watson's Chemical Essays ("Usher's Madness and Poe's Organicism: A Source," American Literature, XXXIX, Nov., I967, pp. 379-389). Like Usher, Watson suggests that there may finally be no clear-cut division between the realms of animal, vegetable, and mineral, that all three may be organically related. But as Smith indicates, Roderick's universe is "an example of aberrant microcosmic organicism" moving steadily toward destruction. While Smith has found in Watson the probable scientific source for Poe's broad concept of organicism, then, it is my contention that we can find in the medical literature on hypochondriasis the probable scientific basis for the peculiar aberration of that concept in the Ushers' world.</page><page sequence="10">lo American Literature longer only suggestively similar, but one. In keeping with that im- plied unity the progress of Roderick's disorder, while it closely follows the medically recognized patterns of hypochondriasis, is inextricably linked to the fate of his dwelling place and the twin he entombs within it. The doctors could not agree as to whether hypo- chondriasis was ultimately physical or mental in origin, and simi- larly it is impossible to say whether the Ushers' family illness origi- nated in their bodies and in the related structure of their dwelling, or in their own minds and the related intelligence of their abode. But the alienists did concur that the hypochondriac's obsessive imagination played a powerful role in accelerating his physical deterioration, and so also one suspects that the fearful minds of generations of hypochondriac Ushers, coupled with the debilitating sentience of their house, have helped to speed the fall of the family's flesh and stone. Even the violent termination of the Usher line is appropriate to the medical descriptions of the disease which afflicts it. According to Rush, the distress of the hypochondriac leads to despair, to the wish to die, and sometimes to suicide (pp. 95-97), while Johnson states that: It is not one of the least curious anomalies in this strange malady, that the individual who appears so solicitous about every symptom of his complaint -and consequently about life, should not very rarely be the one to commit suicide. The fact is, that hypochondriacism, in its highest degree, passes into monomania or mental delusion on a single subject-and it is despair of relief that drives the sufferer to fly into the arms of death to escape the miseries of existence. (p. 67) When Madeline struggles up from the bowels of their sentient dwelling and Roderick rises to meet her dying and deadly embrace, then, the two are at once fulfilling the dark fate of the family line and experiencing the ultimate crisis of the family illness. With the death of the twins their sympathetic mansion sinks into the tarn: in keeping with its disorder the "melancholy House of Usher" (III, 273) has finally surrendered to its own worst-and most fascinat- ing-fear. But of course the medical pattern which brings the Ushers to physical annihilation may in romantic terms be the process which brings them into absolute unity with the realm of pure mind. With its collapse the hypochondriac House of Usher may finally have</page><page sequence="11">Hypochondriasis in Poe's Gothic Tales II achieved romantic idealism's ultimate triumph: if the narrator of "Ligeia" may actually succeed in reshaping reality in the form of Rowena's body to accommodate the undying "idea" of Ligeia her- self, the Ushers may finally succeed in idealizing their reality altogether.17 Taken as a whole, then, "The Fall of the House of Usher" brilliantly suggests that under certain circumstances there may be an exact correlation between the progress of melancholia through isolation and intellectualism, to monomaniacal obsession with a single fear, to self-destruction as a result of that obsession, and the progress of romantic idealism through reclusion and culti- vation of the mind's -powers, to the imaginative struggle to idealize the real, to the absolute dissolution of the real in order to achieve complete union with ideality. When the narrator first enters the House of Usher he passes by the family physician, on whose face he sees "a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity" (III, 277). The puzzlement he perceives in the physician's face foreshadows his own confused reaction to the Ushers' situation, the failure of his conventional and unimaginative application of scientific and medical knowledge to account fully for what he himself experiences. Given his commit- ment to the doctors' equation of the normal and the true, it is not surprising that when faced with the ultimate confirmation of the validity of Usher's fear, when faced with Madeline's seemingly impossible return from the armored and suffocating room in which she has been entombed, he flees "aghast." But as in "Ligeia" and "Eleonora," we finally have no way of knowing whether the narrator is or is not to be believed. If in the light of the extraordinary events which conclude "Usher" we reject the narrator's previous commitment to normal experience, the com- mitment of the physicians, it is only to find that with the idealists we have committed ourselves to the unverifiable, aberrant percep- tions of the individual mind. "The Fall of the House of Usher" is finally, then, Poe's most thorough and sophisticated dramatization. of the impossibility of developing unquestionably valid and com- plete medical, or unquestionably valid and complete mystical, ex- planations of some extraordinary private experiences. So striking 17 This view is of course similar to Wilbur's argument that the House of Usher collapses because Roderick has finally succeeded in becoming "all soul" ("House of Poe," p. I Io).</page><page sequence="12">12 American Literature are the parallels which the story suggests between the medical and the romantic views of mental alienation that the doctors' refusal to grant the idealists' claims for the power of the individual imagina- tion seems arbitrary indeed. It is difficult to agree that the doctors are right. And yet given the limitations of the narrator's perception of what Usher experiences, the limitations of our ability to trust the narrator's own experience, and the fact that the tale is in any case not scientific experiment but a form of science fiction, it is difficult to agree that the doctors are wrong. Dickinson has written that "Much madness is divinest sense / To a discerning eye." Poe's tale brilliantly indicates, in terms of both the scientific and the romantic psychology of his time, just how difficult the discernment is to come by.</page></plain_text>
