<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Conversation Continues . ? ? Patrick K. Dooley William James on the Human Ways of Being.1 Among William James's most memorable contributions to phi losophy was his description of reality as a "blooming, buzzing confusion2." Actually James made several attempts to capture the raw, undifferentiated, primordial stuff available to consciousness. In Brute and Human Intellect, James described it as "a gray chaotic uniformity"(19). In Is Life Worth Living? he explains that his goal is to lead his audience past "the surface-glamour of existence," to "the buzzing and jigging and vibration of small interests and excite ments that form the tissue of our ordinary consciousness" (34). In "Reflex Action and Theism," James points out that our ordinary notice of reality is pre-packaged and pre-labeled for us, so much so we are oblivious to "an utter chaos" and we see only "simplicity and harmony," (95). The cardinal point, for James, is that reality is "a chaos of facts," (Sentiment of Reality 35), a vastly richer, more complex thicket than we supposed3. That humans notice reality's richness and deal with it in an abundance of ways are the key elements of James's account of the Ufe of the talking mammal. My discussion of James's philosophical anthropology will consider: first, animals, infants and adult humans; second, consciousness and survival; and third, fit survival's non-utilitarian responses to real ity. 75</page><page sequence="2">76 I. Dogs and cats, infante and adults James's first task is to disabuse his readers of the belief that reality is what they ordinarily experience. It is not. "Millions of items of the outward order are present to my senses which never properly enter into my experience," (Brute and Human Intellect 19). Neither do other centers of consciousness find important and noteworthy what "normal" adults deem to be obvious matters of fact. James notes that non-human awareness (not only dogs and cats but also infants, savages, idiots and morons) is different than ours; he also explains that non-human experience is inferior in variety and range. Both points are essential in the Jamesian account of human experience. James skillfully describes his dog's frustration with an afternoon of reading in the study: Take our dogs and ourselves, connected as we are by a tie more intimate than most ties in this world; and yet, outside of that tie of friendly fondness, how insensible, each of us, to all that makes life significant for the other!?we to the rapture of bones under hedges, or smells of trees and lamp-posts, they to the delights of literature and art. As you sit reading the most moving romance you ever fell upon, what sort of a judge is your fox-terrier of your behavior? With all his good will towards you, the nature of your conduct is absolutely excluded from his comprehension. To sit there like a senseless statue, when you might be taking him to walk and throwing sticks for him to catch! What a queer disease is this that comes over you every day, of holding things and staring at them like that for hours together, paralyzed of motion and vacant of all conscious life? (On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings 132-133) In his chapter "Attention" in The Principles of Psychology, James describes a dog and his master in a courtyard of statuary at the Vatican. The master studies beauty, and his faithful companion investigates smells at the base of pedestals. Neither the dog or his master is able to penetrate the other's world, "as human beings, the dog's interest in those smells would forever be an inscrutable mystery" (381).</page><page sequence="3">The Conversation Continues . . . 77 James explains that reality's teeming abundance goes unnoticed until an exciting event rouses awareness. The attention of lower or less developed animals is rarely triggered. Brutes are either over whelmed, and tune out reality's overabundance, "the brute always remain[s] drowned, swamped in the total phenomenon" (Principles 983), or their consciousness is defused, unfocused, vacant and drowsy, "it is difficult not to suppose something like this scattered condition of mind to be the usual state of brutes when not actively engaged in some pursuit" (Principles 382). James makes much of the concentrated, sharpened state of awareness which motion sparks in animals. "A kitten cannot help pursuing a moving ball" (Principles 813). Children have not yet learned how to see, that is, how to ignore and how to accentuate particular aspects available to their aware ness. Idiots and morons, too, are incapable of this negative selectiv ity. Since their weak concentration cannot sort the essential from the trivial, they remain dull, "slaves of literal fact" (Principles 538). The on-going flux of reality, the superabundant bloom of facts, overwhelms infants, "to the infant, sounds, sights, touches, and pains, form probably one unanalyzed bloom of confusion" (Principles 469). Normal, adult consciousness is then, the achievement of selective attention through suppressing information.4 Children, dogs and cats have only learned how to control their attention when its focus is fixed upon prominent features in the environment. Therefore, James's characterization of the distinctiveness of human life is traced to our learning how to attend to only a few of interesting facts which surround us. In a word, human consciousness recog nizes richness and variety of reality, while dogs, cats, infants and the retarded are unaware of the world's "jungle of intricacy" (Prin ciples 898). James found he had to press hard for his readers to see the welter of data concealed by custom, habit and language. In fact, even an astute observer like James himself found it takes steady practice to notice what is routinely and systematically ignored.5</page><page sequence="4">78 II. Consciousness, practical living and survival If we were aware of everything we would be nearly paralyzed, scarcely able to respond. But we must act, and so we must not notice things. Humans confront the buzz, boom and bloom of reality because they orient and focus their consciousness. James's psychol ogy uses Darwinian categories, adaption and survival, to explain how. James's recasting of Darwin is predictably enthusiastic, brac ing, attractive and challenging. James, like C. S. Pierce, saw oppor tunity in Darwin's theory of evolution.6 Survival was not a leveling, degrading coincidental by-product, instead, it signaled a positive, triumphant accomplishment, "we are darwinizing...[when] we treat.. .survival as if it were an absolute end, existing as such in the physical world" (Principles 143-144). As James worked out his theory of man, he concluded that because conscious beings sur vived, consciousness could not be an impotent epiphemenon but the key to survival and fulfillment. Early in The Principles of Psychology James wondered what to do with the two seemingly incompatible language-systems of mind and body. One possibility, which he had entertained for several years, was the conscious-automaton theory. On this scheme human behav ior was explained by physical categories, all references to mental life were eliminated, and consciousness dismissed as a casual, unin volved spectator. This simplified account had amongits virtues, the possibility of a psychology with a single explanatory framework. Since lower reflex actions occur without consciousness, why not use the same purely physical stimulus-response paradigm for all ac tions? The difference between lower and higher reflexes is only that the first require just the spinal cord, while second need the hemi spheres of the brain, too. Both accounts, of course, are purely physical. James put it this way: "As actions of a certain degree of complexity are brought about by mere mechanism, why may not actions of a still greater degree of complexity be the result of a more refined mechanism?" The concep</page><page sequence="5">The Conversation Continues ... 79 tion of reflex action is surely one of the best conquests of physiological theory; why not be radical with it? Why not say that just as the spinal cord is a machine with a few reflexes, so the hemispheres are a machine with many, and that is all the difference? The principle of continuity would press us to accept this view. (133) On this scheme consciousness has no function, it is "a sort of 'foam, aura, or melody' "(133). While James cites Descartes with originat ing this view, he criticizes limiting the conscious-automaton theory to animals, "by a singularly arbitrary restriction, however, Descar tes stopped short at man" (134). For James, the ascent of Darwin made Descartes's cut-off point embarrassingly anthropomorphic. Why stop at man? Perhaps psychology should just be done with it? "turn consciousness out of the door as a superfluity so far as one's explanations go" (139). But James balked. "It is to my mind quite inconceivable that consciousness should have nothing to do with a business which it so faithfully attends" (Principles 140). James retraced his steps. If consciousness is present, it must have a use; if consciousness sur vived it must be efficacious for behavior. In support of his thesis James sought biological evidence. His case begins with the "fact" that in the higher animals consciousness is more intense. For in stance, the consciousness "of man must exceed that of an oyster" (Principles 141-142). It seemed to James that in the animal kingdom consciousness is: ...an organ, super added to the other organs which maintain the animal in the struggle for existence; and the presumption of course is that it helps him in some way in the struggle. (Principles 142) James's case is this. Lower animals are aware of a fixed, narrow band of reality and their reactions are mechanically geared for those facts, "amongst the brutes and lower men.. .the mind is passive and tributary, a servile copy, fatally and unresistingly fashioned from without" (Principles 1229). On the other hand, higher animals, conscious of a wide range of stimuli, are equipped with a variety of responses. And if consciousness did not help with the selection of</page><page sequence="6">80 appropriate responses, higher animals, saddled with defective nerv ous systems, would be biologically inferior. The key item is the defective nervous machinery. James's argu ment is reminiscent of Winston Churchill's hedgehog and fox. The fox knows many things, the hedgehog knows only one, but he knows it very well. For James, lower animals have a small repertoire of reactions; higher animals can respond a number of ways, however many of these options will be unsuitable for the situation at hand: We may construct one [a nervous system] which will react infallibly and certainly...(or) we may, on the other hand, construct a nervous system potentially adapted to respond to an infinite variety of minute features in the situation; but its fallibility will then be as great as its elaboration.. .In short, a high brain may do many things, and may do each of them at a very slight hint. But its hair-trigger organization makes of it a happy-go-lucky, hit-or-miss affair.. .A low brain does few things, and in doing them perfecdy forfeits all other uses. The per formances of a high brain are like dice thrown forever on a table. Unless they be loaded, what chance is there that the highest number will turn up oftener than the lowest? (Principles 143) Fortunately, nature has loaded the dice of higher brains with consciousness. James's account, so far, is that human consciousness gives us cognitive access to the world and insures our survival through the selection of appropriate responses. Even so, we have yet to confront the fundamental role of consciousness: consciousness invests sur vival with value. Survival is preferred, if and only, by the vote of consciousness, .. .survival can enter into a purely physiological discussion only as an hypothesis made by an onlooker about the future. But the moment you bring a consciousness into the midst, survival ceases to be a mere hypotheses. (Principles 144) Without consciousness, survival or dissolution are matters of indif ference; with consciousness, survival becomes the desired state. In higher animals consciousness posits survival as a goal, and then, by its efficacy, makes it possible. Beyond that, in the case of humans, mere survival is not an overriding concern. Indeed, as we shall now</page><page sequence="7">The Conversation Continues ... 81 see, what James finds distinctive about the highest animal is a concern with interests and values beyond survival. III. Fit-survival's non-utilitarian interests So far we have seen that the difference between lower animals, infant and fully-developed adult consciousness is an ability to gain distance from the environment. In James's metaphor, lower animals and undeveloped humans swim in a welter of chaotic events. Man's distinctive ability allows him to rise above this confusion as he ignores most of the items which clamor for attention. In other words, human consciousness powerfully creates, by subtraction and em phasis, our reality! James's exhuberant Darwinism is uninterested in survival because survival is an easy affair for humans. No doubt we must heed the corrective, even fatal, press of reality. Still, reality is, for humans, a rich, even relaxed arena which tolerates a generous variety of attitudes, postures and styles. James does not merely acknowledge experimentation and diversity in human culture, he seeks conditions which nurture plurality. Be yond that, he argues that humans are at their best in unusual circumstance where conduct is unpredictable: The most characteristically and peculiarly moral judgments that a man is called upon to make are in unprecedented cases and lonely emergencies, where no popular rhetorical maxims can avail, and the hidden oracle alone can speak; and it speaks often in favor of conduct quite unusual, and suicidal as far as gaining popular approbation goes. (Principles 1265) James, then, emphasizes superfluous, non-utilitarian human pur suits, "man's chief difference from the brutes lies in the exhuberant excess of his subjective propensities?his pre-eminence over them simply and solely in the number and in the fantastic and unnecessary character of his wants, physical, moral, aesthetic, and intellectual" (Reflex Action and Theism 104). James developed special categories for his recommendation: abandon the genial mood of the status quo</page><page sequence="8">82 and everyday routine, embrace the strenuous mood of innovation and challenge. Here, close at hand, is James's conclusion: in the task of cultivating exceptional human conduct, there is no more effective spur than religion. James contends that the moral companionship of God is generally the stimulus which provokes outstanding moral actions. Belief in God opens the wider perspective and "the more imperative ideals now begin to speak with an altogether new objectivity and signifi cance, and to utter the penetrating, shattering, tragically challeng ingnote of appeal" (The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life 160). Belief in God unleashes energy and the courage to endure the uncomfortable path. In fact, James was persuaded that with no other reasons to believe in God, "men would postulate one simply as a pretext for living hard, and getting out of the game of existence its keenest possibilities of zest" (The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life 161). However, playing the game too hard by taking too many risks, can be dangerous. Would not a saint, or even very religious persons, be maladapted for survival? Yes and no, responds James. Maladapted for mere survival, yet splendidly adapted for fit sur vival. However, with fit survival being man at his best, the religious among us have value of the richest sort. In other words, the choicest fruit of religion, sainthood, adapts its possessors to the ideal human society. It is easy, writes James, to conceive, ... an imaginary society in which there should be no aggressiveness, but only sympathy and fairness?any small community of true friends now realizes such a society. Abstractly considered, such a society on a large scale would be the millennium, for every good thing might be realized there with no expense of friction. To such a millennial society the saint would be entirely adapted.. .The saint is therefore abstractly a higher type of man than the "strong man," because he is adapted to the highest society conceivable, whether that society ever be con cretely possible or not. (Varieties 298) James remarks, "Herbert Spenser tells us that the perfect man's conduct will appear perfect only when the environment is perfect: to no inferior environment is it suitably adapted" (Varieties 284).</page><page sequence="9">The Conversation Continues ... 83 Though the saint is, at present, maladapted, he is, insists James, perfectly adapted for fit survival. Therefore, the value of religion and the saint's function is to improve human society, "the saint may waste his tenderness and be the dupe and victim of his charitable fever, but the general function of his charity in social evolution is vital and essential...[and his actions] are slow leavens of a better order" (Varieties 285-287). Conclusion: a catholic pluralism James boldly welcomes the energizing power of religion and the catalytic power of saints. The saint, James argues, is an unqualified success, "magnificantly adapted to the larger environment of his tory" (Varieties 299). Religion inspires and actively promotes the best?societies of maximum diversity populated by communities of unfailing tolerance and respect. James championed radical plural ism because he was convinced that reality is too rich and multifari ous for one preemptive adaptive strategy. For James, the only valid goal is cultural plurality. There is no human way of being, there are a multitude. Reality is a rich reservoir; equally diverse and equally satisfactory are a multitude of human ways of being.7 Not?e 1An earlier version of this paper was part of "The Concept of the Human Being in the Classical American Philosophers," a symposium presented at the XVIII World Congress of Philosophy, 24 August 1988 at Brighton, United Kingdom. See Dooley "American Philosophy at the World Congress of Philosophy" for more on this symposium. 2James used several variations of this phrase. For example, in his first (1890) book The Principles of Psychology, he notes "one great blooming, buzzing confusion" (462) and in Some Problems of Philosophy, which he was revising at his death in 1910, he refers to "a big blooming buzzing confusion (32).
