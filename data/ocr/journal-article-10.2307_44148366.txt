<plain_text><page sequence="1">9 An Approach to the Erotic Sculpture of the Ramappa Temple M. Krishna Kumari 1 . 1 Erotic sculpture appear on the temple as the decorative motif. It appears that like the parsva devalas , erotic imagery seems to be an obligatory decorative device, which must have had the sanction of the sacred texts. Several studies1 have been made on the erotic sculpture of India, its nature and significance with special reference to the temple art of Khajuraho, Konark and other Orissan temples, where one encounters with a large number of mithuna images. From these studies it is clear that the erotic figures appear on the religious monuments from the end of 9th Century A.D. and are seen in most of the temples from A.D. 900-1400. As each region had a distinctive local approach towards the the erotic motifs, which is reflected in their thematic content and nature of depiction, the present study is made on the erotic sculpture of a Kakatiya temple of 1 3th Century A.D. in Andhra region. 1.2 The Rudresvara temple, popularly known as Ramappa temple was built by RecharlaRudra, a general in the service of Kakatilya king Ganapati Deva according to an inscription of the temple dated A.D. 1 2 13.2 The ceiling, pillars and the exterior walls of the temple are richly carved and adorned with the iconography of lord Siva in his various forms, dancing girls, musicians, naginis and bracked figures. Although the temple sculpture has been studied earlier, 3 here, it is aimed to study and analyse the erotic sculpture of the Ramappa temple in an altogether fresh approach. 1.3 Unlike the several Kakatiya temples, which are of the trikuta plan, the Ramappa temple is of ekakuta and star-shaped in plan. It is raised on an upapitha or a high podium. The upapitha, on which the temple rises is plain and affords a space of 10 feet wide all-round the temple, forming the pradakshinapatha. The adhisthana as well as the wall portion covering the mukhamandapa of the temple are profusely decorated with the figures of heterogenous character, comprising sages, women, maithuna pairs in various poses, warriors, acrobats, dancers, musicians, Saivite and Vaisnavite gods and goddesses alternatively in a frieze in the middle part. The upper and lower friezes are decorated with floral motifs. Below it is a row of elephants. 1 .4 The bracket-figures which spring from thé shoulders of the outer pillars of the</page><page sequence="2">152 temple support nominally the chajja slabs at the three entrances of the mukhamandopa. These life-size figures generally known as mandakini figures are made of black basalt and carved with considerable skill. Some of these bracket figures represent dancing girls in different poses while few others like nude nagini and the woman wearing sandals, monkey pulling the saree of a lady, woman standing under a tree haś nothing to do with the dance and are of interest for the present study. The theme of the erotic sculptures studied here include erotic exhibitionism, erotic couples, displayed male and females and the scene depicting the oral intercourse. 1.5 Like a number of auspicious motifs such as kirtimukhas, nagas and lotus designs, the erotilc motifs are carved on the temple walls. It is mentioned in the Utkalkhand, Agnipurana and Brihatsamhita that the function of the obscene sculptures was to protect the structures against lightning, cyclone, and other visitations of nature.4 Similarly, it is mentioned in the Manasara Silpasastra that just like the parsvadevatas, dikpalas and a varanadevatas which form a protective ring around the installed divinity by emanating their power outward, so do the mithuna figures.3 These literary references show the auspicious as well as the protective funtion of the »otic imagery on the temples.6 1.6 At Ramappa temple, the exterior wall portion of the mukhamandapa is decorated with the figures of the female unfastening her garments, lifting up her skirt to expose her genitalia, sages removing their under garments and exposing their genital organs, nudity of the sages, erotic couples, dancers and musicians. These images along with the divine images like Bhikshatanumurti, Narasimha and dancing Gan esa are carved in rectangular compartments alternatively, each separated by small pilasters. From the location of the erotic figures and the place given to them in the sculptural and iconographical scheme of the temple it may be sugested that, the erotic images were carved in the overall decorative scheme, which must also be of auspicious nature. 1.7 On the lower part of the door-jambs of the antarala and garbhagriha are carved the erotic motif of Salabhanjika or "woman and tree". This motif has its roots in a flower festival ceremony in ancient India. It is found from the Mahabharata that it is the general belief that the trees would bestow children.7 It is also believed that a young woman can revitalize a tree and make it blossm by her touch. Thus the relationship between the woman and the tree was believed to be reciprocal. Just as the woman could "fertilize" the tree, the tree could also impart "fertility" to her! 1.8 The life-size bracket figure of nagini, exposing her nudity at the southern entrance, standing on a snake, holding a snake in her two uplifted hands one or more snakes round her neck, body, and wearing sarpa kundalas and sarpa dandas is not only a good piece of decorative art, but is of much significance. The serpent held by her delicate fingers has a large hood to be seen to the left of her right hand. The same kind of figure is also carved on the door-jamb of the garbha-griha, though in a smaller dimension. It is enjoined in the Silpa Prakasa belonging to the period</page><page sequence="3">153 between the 9th and the 12th Centuries A.D. , that the nagas protect the temple against lightning, in addition to propitiating the Naga folk in the subterrenean regions to secure the temple solidly on its earth foundations. 9 In Indian art serpent is a symbol of life energy, and the important function of the nagas is that of door- guardian.10 The depiction of the nagas at the portals of the Hindu shrines can only be explained in this direction. Likewise, it appears from the various referentes of ihe-Silpasastras that the builders of the temples were quite concerned with protecting the structures from all sorts of calamities, so much so that a miniature shrine or temporary abode was to be constructed, when the main temple was dam- aged, as in the case of ł 'natural disasters such as lightning, damage or the calamity of /?//Atf-breakage of the base, attacks by elephants or enemies of thieves".11 The Kakatiya architect sculptors, used the light weighted bricks (which will float in the waťer) in the construction of the gopura of the temple, keeping in view the longevity of the structure. In the same manner they have taken great care and followed the principles laid down in the Silpa and Vastu texts and placed at the entrance the na^as in a beautiful combination with the female form (both of which are auspicious) to help protect the sacred precincts from all kinds of evil spirits. Further it is observed that the snake cult is more closely related to Siva than to any other deity of the Hindu pantheon. In the Mahabharata Siva is described as having a girdle of snakes, ear- rings of snakes, an upavita of a snake and an outer garment of snake's skin.12 It is widely believed that the snakes contribute to the fertility of the soil, the mankind and the health of the cattle.13 For this reason, the serpents are represented in the temple art in three different types - theriomorphic, anthropomorphic and therio-anthropo- morphic (a human bust with a serpent's tail). The auspicious nature of the female form is even more evident in exposing the genitalia. The image of women is auspicious, because she symbolises fertility and because she is beautiful.14 According to Satapatha Brahmana , beauty itself is auspicious and synonymous with fertility or abundance. 1.9 The depiction of alasa kanya and monkey, a popular theme, during the Somavamsi period 15 can be seen on the southern entrance of the temple. In this, a mischievous monkey attempts to pull the under garments from the female, and the woman raises her right hand in the act of chasing the monkey and places the palm of her left hand on her genatalia in an attempt to hide it. The erotic nature of the motif is further stressed by the ithyphallic condition of the monkey . At the northern entrance, a female figure is represented as standing in tribhanga pose, with her left leg crossed over in front of the straight right leg. A man is shown to her right side in the act of pulling away a thorn from her left foot. The woman holds a knife in her uplifted left hand. The same kind of figure is seen at the entrance of the antarala . 1.10 Ascetics with matted hair, clean shaven and sometimes with Beards, protruding stomachs with lion's skin and waterpot in their left hands are shown displaying their sexual organs. A scene from the door-jamb of the antarala shows an ascetic with matted hair and water-pot in his left hand and encouraging a woman, seated on a small pedestal in front of him for the oral congress. This kind of oral congress, which was condemned and looked down upon by Kamasastra writers is seen in the</page><page sequence="4">154 sculptures of all regions. Particularly in the sculptures of Khajuraho, Modhera, Roda and Halebid, an ascetic is shown as being excited by the women.16 In depicting the oral intercourse , which derives from the Tantric rituals, it is the conjunction of ,male and female principles that is emphasized, is combined with ritual exhibitionism. This represents an "auspicious pair" with one partner paying homage to the other or the Tantric sexual practices. Bui the Tantric works advocate strict secrecy of the Tantric practices, while the Silparatnam and Mayamatam states that on the habitations of human beings the scenes of wars, death, sorrow or legends about gods and asuras or nude figures and the lila or amorous sports of ascetics should not be figured. It is mentioned in them, that on the other buildings made for other purposes, whatever is desired may be done. While considering these two contradicting statements keeping the Tantric practices in strict secrecy and showing the ascetics in maithuna act on temples, it is essential to understand the religious background of the temple. A close study of ine religious practices of the temple reveals the influence of misra religion of Smarta-Pauranic Tantrism, in which the Tantric elements are accepted and retained their veneration for the Vedas and the Varnasramadharma and was within the Brahmanic fold, and not of extreme Tantric sects with esoteric practices. The iconographical forms of the temple complex, which include mahishasuramardini, Ganesa, Visnu, Siva as Kalabhairava reveals the syncretistic tendencies. Hence, there need not he any particular injuction for not revealing secretive Tantric practices and the followers of the Misra school of Pauranic Tantric religion might have been responsible for displaying the ascetics and Tantric practices on the temple under study. 1.11 The Ramappa temple of the medieval period was not merely a religious centre of worship, but was a socio-cultural institution with the royal partonage. Because of the feudal character of the society, during which period the temple has been built with the encouragement of the feudal lord, Recharla Rudra, the erotic motifs were accepted in the sculptural scheme and were convention-alised. Moreover, as the temple has emerged as an important socio-economic institution in this period, by the largenumberoflandandvillagedonations,itssizehasalsobeenincreased. This facilitated the sculptor for carving several decorative motifs on the temple walls, which include the erotic figures. 1.12 Thus the study of the various themes of the erotic imagery on the Ramappa temple reveals that the erotic sculptures are carved in accordance with the Silpa canons and regional traditions of religion and art. It is also made clear from the observation of the place assigned to them in the sculptural scheme of the temple that the erotic images serve the auspicious, alankara and magicoritual functions.
