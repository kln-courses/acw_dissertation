In addition to an electron and a nucleus, Hydrogen sports a jaunty bow tie, and small feet propel him. Another molecule appears: larger, with three rings of electrons decorated with a pretty pink ribbon. A voice bubble appears above Hydrogen, as he says in a romantic Italian accent, "Sulfur!" Sulfur giggles, and exclaims, "Hydrogen!" They move toward each other across the screen and meet with another hydrogen. Their electrons mingle, a heart and wedding bells appear, and a voice-over nar- ration explains that they are now bound together in a more stable form, having filled their outer valence levels by elec- tron sharing. This was one of several ani- mations that filled our middle school computer lab as eighth graders finished their Romance of the Atoms projects. In other animations, Dmitri Mendeleev moved around the periodic table discussing properties of atomic groups; a group of busy bees pushed hydrogen and oxygen molecules together to form a water molecule; and a somewhat disheveled carbon 14 stood in the school library, defining isotopes and ions with his Mend, a sodium ion. The projects were the cul- mination of the eighth graders' unit on atoms, elements, and atomic bonds. Our eighth- grade students look forward to this unit, and learning to 48 I ISCIENCE1 SCOPE</page><page sequence="2">Detail of the animation script for one of the hydrogen-atom sprites, telling the atom char- acter to speak a recorded nar- BAjâáÂ|2fl rative and then to move from one location to another on the screen, and to make a popping sound (as it bonds with oxygen) TRIEDKIflb«glW read the periodic table is a scientific rite of passage at our school. However, the challenge at this grade level remains relating predictability of atomic interactions and the repetitive arrangement of the periodic table with basic atomic structure. Development of these two concepts is critical in making these connections. The first concept is that completion of valence electron levels determines reactivity. During our class discussion of this concept, I emphasize that a less full valence electron level means more reactivity, and a fuller level means less reactivity. Noble gases with totally full levels are not reactive at all. Avoiding the complex details of electron shell construction, we emphasize the repetition of the 2... 8... 8... pattern of valence electrons in the outer energy level only, and only in the less complicated first three rows of the periodic table. The second concept, that the repetitive nature of the arrangement of the elements depends on the number of valence electrons, is developed through an in-depth exploration of the periodic table itself. Once the connection between the location and the number of valence electrons has been established, the important step can be made of linking the element behavior with number of valence electrons - for metals, in general, the farther to the left of the periodic table, the fewer valence electrons they have and the more reactive they are; and for nonmetals (noble gases excluded), the farther right they are, the more valence electrons they have and the more reactive they are. We emphasize that atoms achieve greater stability through chemical bonds that help fill their valence shells. We sometimes use the anthropomorphism of atoms "seeking" their partners in the chemical-bond romance to help eighth- grade students begin to understand chemical bonds; however, the fact that this is an anthropomorphism is emphasized repeatedly to students during discus- sion to make sure they understand that atoms are not alive. One way of achieving such stability is through the formation of chemical bonds among appropriately matched elements. Because the formation of atomic bonds is active, we sought a way of learning through drama or kinetic activity. To achieve this goal, we developed an activity called Romance of the Atoms. The activity requires students to use computer-animation technology to de- velop short cartoons that explain atomic classification and bonds. To create the animated cartoons, students use Scratch, a computer program that was recom- mended by our technology coordinator. Created at MIT, Scratch is a free downloadable program (http:// scratch, mit. edu) that uses simple blocks of commands for movement, looks, and sounds, which students can fit together to command their animated objects ("sprites") to move and speak (Figure 1). Students can make their own sprites and backgrounds, insert speech bubbles, record their own narration, and even incorporate images and sounds from the internet as they write, design, and problem solve (Figures 2 and 3). Thus, our eighth-grade students were able to use Scratch to be both computer programmers and scien- tists as they reviewed element interactions that result in compounds and created animations that modeled these interactions. Designed for elementary and middle school students, Scratch is inviting and intuitive (I was able to create a successful animation within half an hour of being introduced to the program).

We introduced our project after discussion of the periodic table in science class. Our technology coordinator spent half a class period with students demonstrating basic methods of creating sprites and the animation commands. Students then completed their project in four class days. Students worked in groups of two to three in researching, writing, and animating. Groups worked at different paces, but were encouraged to complete research and a basic script before jumping into the animation itself. Technology and science teachers monitored student groups' progress, helped problem solve, and encouraged groups to stay on task. Completion of the project required students to submit two items: a written document listing how the student group fulfilled each of the project requirements, and a Scratch animation uploaded to our school account (a free account) on the MIT Scratch website (Figures 4 and 5). The basic requirements of the project were the following: • no more than 45 seconds long • the animation sprites depict the correct valence electron structures of assigned elements • at least one sprite from Scratch program library • at least two images from the internet (referenced correctly in bibliography) • at least two sounds from the Scratch library • a narrated, verbal explanation • animation and narration should provide a clear explanation of the assigned topic - in particular, how the element's structure leads to its place- ment in the periodic table and interactions with atoms of other elements Students were assessed using a rubric similar to that which might be used for presentations, including points for group work and efficiency, accuracy of materials, completion of requirements, creativity, and completion of supporting written document and bibliography. It would be well worth the time to develop a rubric with students at the start of the project, as such an exercise would allow them to carefully consider the character- istics of a successful project before embarking on the work themselves. Individual groups were assigned specific topics to explain though their animation. These topics included placement of atomic groups within the periodic table, reactivity of different atomic groups, the differences between ions and isotopes, and how atomic bonds are formed through electron sharing. The Romance of Atoms project was the culmina- tion of our study of atoms and the periodic table. Our Atoms, Elements, and Molecules unit was developed in accordance with the National Science Education Standards for middle and high school students, which include properties and changes in properties of matter, structure of atoms, structure and properties of matter, chemical reactions, and the use of models (in this case, computer animations) in assisting scientific understanding (NRC 1996). Details of subatomic particles were de-emphasized, with the exception of the role of the outer valence electrons in determining both element behavior and arrangement in the periodic table. Students became comfortable with the idea that the elements naturally assume a stable state, and atomic bonds - 50 I 1SCIENCEI SCOPE</page><page sequence="4">Student animation showing three busy bee characters pushing lithium and nitrogen UgyijAl atoms together to fill their elec- tron shell and become stable as lithium nitride, Li3N JHHHHH Student animation in which Mendeleev ■¿[fļļkJatJ discusses features of the periodic table with a confused student scientist TRIFDMJIiHrfl« the formation of compounds - are a result of the development of stability. We were very pleased with how the project worked, from both the science and technology points of view, and could think of few significant changes for when we do it again. These included making sure that students within groups have equal time "driving" the computer, reminding students to be aware of sound levels and clarity of narration during recording, and more frequent encouraging of groups to check in with a teacher during development of their script. We were careful to review narrations and animations for content as the project progressed, and thus were able to help students correct most of their factual errors before project completion. This resulted in correct animations and provided students with the opportunity to discuss scientific concepts. Technol- ogy is incorporated into subject-area classes in our school; however, this project would also work well with paired technology/science classes. We have found that, both in science and technology settings, the alternate-presentation format allows students to excel who have not done so with more conventional assignments and assessments. This project can be publicized either internally in the school newspaper or at student or parent meet- ings, or externally through posting projects at the Scratch website. Student groups were delighted to view their animations at the completion of the unit, and seemed confident at the end of the project in their understanding of the periodic table arrange- ment and atomic bonds. This project provided a successful combination of development and review of science concepts and use of computer technology in modeling of scientific ideas. We look forward to using it again in the future. ■ Acknowledgment The author would like to thank Doug Alexander and Katy Wood for their help with this project.
