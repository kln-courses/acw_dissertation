These reveal an intricate relationship between a space suggested by images and the physical reality of urban space. The majority of the photographs were taken in places of transition and movement, such as Vauxhall Cross, London, where images in the form of advertising billboards provide a live cultural reference. The images generally portray an alternative spatial context, a parallel expe? rience and, commonly, an anthropomorphic focus. The rules that set up the images differ from those that control the context, but the con? sequence of this is that the images, although at times alien, tend both to articulate and to inhabit the contextual space. In these particular locations, image space and physical space overlap and generate an evolving urban condition. This sets up an active dialogue between the virtual and the real that continuously transforms the spatial configuration of the city. The first photograph was taken in October 1996 and the most recent in November 2001. 20 AA FILES 45/46</page><page sequence="3">AA FILES 45/46 2 I</page><page sequence="4">22 AA FILES 45M6</page><page sequence="5">Image Architecture The brief was to redesign the offices of Spin, a multimedia design company located in a South London warehouse. The space was laid out as a 25-metre-long workspace with several adjacent rooms. In response, the architectural project reassesses both the entrance and the overall space in terms of physical objects, conceptual lines and images. Three types of elements are introduced into the space: furniture (tables, benches and light boxes), screens (wall screens, doors and light shades) and images (variously sized light-boxes). The entrance space is defined by a circle, 5 metres in diameter, painted on the floor and circumscribing a large circular table (3.6 metres in diameter) incorporating a central light-box. The table, lacquered in deep orange with blue stripes, generates a distributive element or 'roundabout' as an introduction to the existing workspace. Seating at the entrance is provided by means of a 3-metre-long undulating bench and the surrounding walls are articulated by large translucent screens lit by coloured fluorescent strips and containing small central light-boxes. Further large light-boxes, 2.4 x 1.2 metres in size, and suspended light-shades create different axial relationships along the length of the existing office. Two principal cross axes are established: one to the meeting room and the other to the room containing the pool table. The pool room, painted deep red, is separated from the main space by means of a large sliding plastic strip door and contains a pool table which has been recovered in red felt. The meeting room is similarly separated by a large sliding translucent door and contains a new orange lacquered meeting table with a central light-box positioned on axis with a blue lacquered wall panel incorporating a small light-box. The design was set up so that CVB Architecture would be responsible for the spatial layout of the images and Spin would be responsible for the images contained in the light-boxes. The resultant space is generated by both the chosen images and the spatial configuration in the same way as the billboards articulate the urban space. The photographs show the entrance area (p.22), entrance area detail with the bench (this page, bottom left), cross axis from the pool room (p.24) and cross axis into the meeting room (this page, top left). In this instance, the theme chosen for the shown images is the colour red. Photographs by Carlos Villanueva Brandt. AA FILES 45/46 23</page><page sequence="6">24 AA FILES 45/46</page></plain_text>
