Shah/Numen 58 (2011) 314-343 Introduction Classical Islamic scholarship developed two principal theses on the sub ject of the origin of language (asI al-lugha). The first of these theses, commonly referred to as tawqif, accentuated the pre-eminent role which divine agency played in the imposition of language; axiomatic within this perspective is the view that words had been primordially assigned meanings by God. The modality of this process of positing is never fully qualified, although it is hypothesized that God created a necessarily intuitive knowledge which encompassed words and their assigned meanings. Presented as an antithesis to this concept, the sec ond thesis, labeled istildh, predicates that language was established via common convention and agreement (muwada'a) by humans who assigned communicative meaning to words. Both the doctrines of tawqif and istildh deem that the original formation of the connection between words and their meanings remains entirely arbitrary (SuyutI 1970:1, 1—60). There does not exist an absolute affinity between the distinctive phonemic properties of the Arabic word for "book," kitab, and the physical object it signifies. Indeed, it would have been entirely conceivable for the inventor of language to choose an alternative com bination of phonemes to denote "kitab." The terms revelationist and conventionalist are frequently used to signify the respective tawqif and istildh theses. Recent scholarship has identified an intricate range of theological exigencies and concerns which were driving the early debates on the origins of language, arguing that the thesis of istildh was gener ated within the course of such discussions. It is also reckoned that, concomitantly, tawqif despite having tentative roots in early exegetical musings, appears in a much more developed sense as a significant coun terargument adduced to challenge and undermine istildh and the range of theological doctrines aligned with it. Initially, elements within orthodox Islamic circles tended to endorse the thesis of tawqif, despite the fact that a number of its advocates were individuals not necessarily renowned for their orthodox inclination. Gradually, as the theological trajectories of the discourse evolved, both theses were recognized as being equally plausible; indeed, some scholars even adapted elaborate explanations of the origins of language which fused peculiar aspects of the two doctrines (Zarkashl 1992:11, 14-16). Nevertheless, in the course of the 9th/10th centuries and for a period</page><page sequence="3">316 M. Shah / Numen 58 (2011) 314—343 beyond, opinions on the subject were more or less entrenched and indicative of an underlying theological tension between traditionalists and arch-rationalists. And, in the quest to achieve a conceptual defense of traditional arguments for tawqifi it was necessary for orthodox theo logians to create a connective structure, as articulated through reference to "remembrance," "continuation," and "identity," which enabled them to anchor the construct of tawqif in a formalized way to the scriptural exegesis and emblems of orthodoxy associated with the pious ancestors. That this reconstruction was successfully accomplished through refer ences to the past would seem to confirm the measured role which cul tural memory played in the defense of an orthodox idea. Historical contexts Classical Muslim sources referring to the discussion of the origins of language frequently affirm that the doctrine of istilah was first intro duced by Abu Hashim ibn al-Jubbai (d. 933), a distinguished theolo gian. His father, al-Jubbai (d. 915), was one of the outstanding members of the Basran Mu'tazilites, a theological movement which had its his torical roots in the early Islamic tradition. The Mu'tazilites were renowned for upholding the critical role that human reason should play in the synthesis of faith, importing rationally based arguments and premises to define and defend their doctrinal stances. The Mu'tazilites insisted that God always acted in accordance with the dictates of reason ('aql), which, in their view, had to serve as the principal criterion and arbiter of truth; they assimilated Greek philosophical arguments and con structs which had gradually pervaded the intellectual discourses of the Islamic world through a steady stream of translations into Arabic via Syriac. They referred to themselves as the upholders of "divine unity and justice," promoting two key axioms. Firstly, they defended the notion of God's absolute transcendence, dismissing any attempt to conceptualize or refer to the divine essence in an anthropomorphic way. Additionally, they argued that God's attributes, as predicated in the scriptural sources, were an intrinsic part of his essence in the sense that God knows not by a hypostatic entity of knowledge which subsists within his essence, but by virtue of his unique essence; these attributes</page><page sequence="4">M. Shah/Numen 58 (2011) 314-343 were identical with His essence; they were identical with Him (Mankdlm 1965:182—3 cf. Juwayni 1996:51—5). Within orthodoxy these attributes, among which is the attribute of speech (kaldm), were viewed in a sub stantial and essential vein. The Mu'tazilites contended that such a view implied the existence of a plurality within the Godhead, compromising the conception of the divine unity of God. Secondly, they trenchantly rejected the orthodox doctrine of predestination, insisting that God's divine justice together with the prerequisites of moral and religious obli gation entailed that human beings had to be free and responsible agents who were the sole authors of their acts. In stressing the axiom of God's transcendence, the Mutazilites argued that the sacred scripture of Islam, the Qur an, was a created and tempo rally contingent document; there was a time when it did not exist. The traditional belief predicated that the Qur an was the uncreated and essential speech of God (kalam Allah) as revealed to his Prophet by the angel Gabriel and that to speak of the Qur an in terms of its being cre ated compromised this exceptional quality. Some staunchly traditional ist theologians had claimed the Quran was eternal (qadim) and uncreated in status and that the attribute of speech together with its physical expression (lajz) as a recited text was actually coordinate with the divine essence; others had simply emphasized its entitative and con comitant status within the divine essence (Juwaynl 1996:128—9). But for the Mu tazilites, to refer to God as a speaker in any sort of literal context was tantamount to anthropomorphism and also implied that He possessed a physical organ with which words were articulated (Madelung 1974:507). It would have been argued from an ontological perspective, that such an understanding contradicted the nature of God's transcendence and the reality that the divine essence could not serve as a locus or substrate for contingent acts such as speech or indeed even physical movement. During the period referred to as the mihna ("Inquisition"), when the political influence of the Mu tazilites was dominant, the doctrine of a created Qur an was imposed as the official policy of the 'Abbasid state by the caliph al-Ma'mun (ruled 813-33). It was vigorously opposed by traditionalist scholars, who were in some cases compelled to recant the doctrine of an uncreated Qur an. Historically, al-Jubbal was closely associated with Abu' 1-Hasan al-Ash'arl (d. 935), the eponym of Sunni orthodoxy's most prominent</page><page sequence="5">M. Shah / Numen 58 (2011) 314-343 school of scholastic theology, the Ash'arites.1 Doctrinal disagreements between these two cynosures led to al-Ash'ari denouncing the Mu'tazilites, and subsequently devoting his life to refuting their theological teach ings and arguments. While differences persist as to whether the brand of orthodoxy which became synonymous with later Ash'arite thinkers has its roots in the legacy of al-Ash'ari, it was purposefully constellated around a rationally based traditionalist methodology and strategy to counter Mu'tazilism (Frank 1991:143—9; Makdisi 1962:37—41). One tension in medieval Islamic thought is the opposition between tradi tionalists on the one hand, who abhorred the use of speculatively based rational tools for the defense of orthodoxy, and, on the other hand, the Ash'arites, who were content to utilize such rational approaches and procedures when mounting a defense of orthodoxy. This was not merely an issue of methodology and approaches; rather, there were key points of dogma which inexorably separated the traditionalists, especially those with conservative outlooks, from the Ash'arites. Despite the opprobrium of the staunch traditionalists, rationally inspired approaches to the defense of religious dogma became an indelible feature of classi cal Islamic theological discourse. The thematic compass of theology extended to a gamut of subjects: it was concerned not only with the articulation of traditional beliefs, but it also took to expanding con structs of dogma which were the product of dialectical discussions and debates (Shah 2007:432-5). This sometimes entailed the controversial use of apophatic and cataphatic forms of argumentation and, moreover, reference to teleological and cosmological arguments (Amidl 2004 passim). The accusation that the Ash'arites were tainted through their promoting a brand of Mu'tazilism masquerading as orthodoxy fre quently resonates in the classical theological literature. Nonetheless, this should not detract from the fact that the opposition between the Mu'tazilites and the Ash'arites forms a fecund chapter in classical theo logical thought. Much of the discussion about the origins of language was inspired by the intellectual milieu of deliberations between the " The brand of orthodox scholastic theology cultivated by Ash'ari had its antecedents: figures such as Ibn Kullab (d. 854), al-QalanisI (fl. 9th century), and al-Muhasibl (d. 857) were linked with adopting similar strategies in the defence of orthodoxy. Ibn Kullab's followers were identified with a separate school (Kullabiyya).</page><page sequence="6">M. Shah/Numen 58 (2011) 314-343 Mu'tazilites and the Asharites, although contributions to the debate came from other quarters within the religious tradition. In the related literature references to the origin of language often appear to be a peripheral feature of theological and legal discourses, although the dis cussions had profound ramifications for a number of contentiously debated topics, including the doctrine of the divine names, arguments about the imposition of religious obligation, theological references to metaphor and figurative language, and, to an extent, the concept of a created Qur an. Following a period of gestation, the Mu'tazilites divided into two nominal camps: the Basrans and the Baghdadis, although the indige nous influence of these camps extended across different parts of the Islamic world (Van Ess 1987:6320; Watt 1998:217-50). In the Basran camp were figures such as Dirar ibn 'Amr (d. 915), Abu Bakr al-Asamm (d. 816), Abu 1-Hudhayl al-Allaf (d. 841), al-Nazzam (d. 836), Mu'ammar ibn Abbad (d. 830), Hisham ibn Amr al-Fuwatl (d. 842), al-Jahiz (d. 869), and Abbad ibn Sulayman (d. 864). The Baghdadis included among their ranks Bishr ibn al-Mu'tamir (d. 825 or 840), Thumama ibn Ashras al-Numayri (d. 828), Ja far ibn Harb (d. 850), and other notable individuals. Despite the existence of differences on specific points of doctrine among these figures, the underlying princi ples of "divine unity and justice" and the doctrine of the created Qur an were key shibboleths of Mu'tazilism; and significantly, the whole dynamic of this movement's thought was incontrovertibly driven by a rationally inspired synthesis of dogmatic and dialectical constructs. Arguments for tawqif and istilah During the chronological era in which Abu Hashim lived, the move ment associated with the Mu tazilites had relinquished much of its political influence, but continued to develop theoretical ideas and solu tions to various theological quandaries and related discussions through out the ensuing historical periods. Despite the fact that none of Abu Hashim's oeuvre has survived, a range of dicta and reports attributed to this figure and others on the subject of taivqifznA istildh is preserved in theological, philological, exegetical, and legal literature, particularly</page><page sequence="7">320 M. Shah / Numen 58 (2011) 314—343 those texts devoted to the principles of jurisprudence in which scholars pored over the epistemological preliminaries of language as a prelude to defining the theoretical bases of law. By virtue of these materials it is possible to gauge the various arguments and counter-arguments which surface in discussions relating to the origins of language. There is scant evidence to show that the concept of istildh was articulated before being championed by Abu Hashim.2 Critically, once the concept of istildh was proposed, it appears to have been immediately countered with the thesis of tawqif by Abu Hashim's father, al-Jubba I, Abu '1-Qasim (al-Balkhl) al-Ka'bl (d. 932), a renowned Mu'tazilite of the Baghdad! school, and Abu 1-Hasan al-Ash'arl (Naysaburl 1979:158). The earliest extant Mu'tazilite theological sources which feature a detailed treatment of the issue are the writings of al-Qadi Abd al-Jabbar (d. 1025), a trenchant defender of Mutazilism in whose works is pre served much of this school's thought from the formative periods. Among his most important work is the Kitdb al-mughni, a voluminous text which covers a grand collection of theological subjects. The followers of Abu Hashim are referred to in the sources as the Bahshamiyya, representing the predominant branch of the school in the 10th and 11th centuries. The suggestion is that its brand of theology purportedly dominated the related discourse among Mu'tazilites in these periods (IsfarayinI 1985:74). Abd al-Jabbar and many of his immediate students were enumerated among the ranks of the Bahshamiyya. It is also clear from the contexts in which Abu Hashim is cited in the literature that, although istildh appears as his doctrinal innovation, there are other markedly significant theologi cal concepts which he introduces and propounds upon, underlining his reputation as an immensely influential thinker.3 The analysis of the topics of istildh and muwadaa features at a num ber of junctures in the Kitab al-mughni, but in a chapter devoted to a discussion of the names and attributes of God Abd al-Jabbar broaches the premise that initially a name {ism) can represent only its named entity or referent (al-musammd) by way of meaningful designation and purpose (qasd wa-irada) ('Abd al-Jabbar 1965:V, 160-5). He argues 2) Richard Frank does mention that muwadaa was introduced by Ibn al-Rawandl (d. 859); Frank 1978:29. 3) This would include his famous theory of hypostatic states (ahwal), which dealt with the nature of the divine essence.</page><page sequence="8">M. Shah/Numen 58 (2011) 314-343 that through common convention and agreement entities are assigned names but it is the very act of qasd, that is to say, divulging the design and intended purpose of naming, which primarily validates the con nection between a name and its referent. Through a labyrinth of argu ments in which Abu Hashim is often cited, it is postulated that without a necessary awareness of qasd among interlocutors, no process of muwadda is possible. The general thrust of this rationale would be that if language had been established initially via tawqif, with God's invent ing language and establishing the relationship between words and meanings, then he would have had to reveal necessarily the design and intention behind the use of language. This would entail disclosing to humans knowledge of God before the actual imposition of religious obligation. Abd al-Jabbar insists "It is inconceivable that we should necessarily know God's intention in the state of obligation, just as it would be inappropriate to know necessarily His essence at the time when obligation comes into existence" ( Abd al-Jabbar 1965:V, 164; RazI 1981:1, 191). The reasoning is that knowledge of the attribute of an entity, in this case God's imposition of language, would a fortiori necessitate knowledge of the essence of that entity, namely God (Asnawi 1999:1, 189). Mu'tazilites insisted that a human being's first duty was to recognize God through rational contemplation: it was not possible to witness God in the physical sense, nor can He be known in an inev itably necessary way (Mankdlm 1965:44; cf. Juwayni 1969:110). It was incumbent upon individuals of sound mind to seek to acquire knowl edge of God. Referring to Abu Hashim's arguments, Abd al-Jabbar argues that if humans were acquainted with God's qasd, then taklif, the act of imposing religious obligation, would be rendered utterly futile.4 From a separate perspective, Abd al-Jabbar contends that preceding the process of muwadaa, in which words are assigned meanings, were observable acts of gesticulation. These acts permit the specification and designation of the thing named (al-musamma)\ unsurprisingly, by infer ence God could not possibly be associated with the physical movement 4) Ash'arite theologians argued that religious obligations could only be realised follow ing revelation (Juwaynl 1969:115). With respect to 'meaning', de Saussure spoke of the arbitrary nature of the relationship between the signifiant (concept) and the sig nifie (sound image).</page><page sequence="9">M. Shah / Numen 58 (2011) 314—343 concomitant with such acts ('Abd al-Jabbar 1965:164). Now, Abd al-Jabbar does concede that it is possible for tawqlf to occur in respect of the genesis of succeeding languages, but this would occur only once an initial language had been established via muwadaa by humans (Abd al-Jabbar 1965:V, 164—6; cf. Peters 1976:386—7). In a later text entitled al-Masa il fi'l-khildf composed by one of Abd al-Jabbar's students, Abu Rashid al-Naysaburl (d. 1068), in which doc trinal differences between Basran and Baghdad! Mutazilites are enu merated, Abu Hashim is identified as the author of the idea that the origin of language lies in muwadda (istilah). Abu Rashid maintains that Abu 1-Qasim al-Balkhl professed the doctrine of tawqifi while, con versely, al-Jubbai is purported to have recognized that both the doc trines of tawqifimd istilah offered plausible explanations for the origin of language. Abu Rashid then moves on to defend the doctrinal posi tion taken by Abu Hashim, using similar arguments about qasd and taklif (Naysaburl 1979:158). Later sources provide further anecdotal evidence of the arguments employed by Abu Hashim to justify istilah (Asnawl 1999:1, 188). One such example is his contention that the human designation of language must precede the advent of revelation. A Qur'anic verse to that effect is cited, Q 14:4: "And never did we dis patch a Prophet except that he conversed in the language of those to whom he was sent in order to make (matters) plain for them." Abu Hashim is said to have retorted that the alternative would be for God to instill a necessary and intuitive knowledge of language in the mind of an intelligent individual. However, he adds that such an act would necessitate this individual spontaneously recognizing God, rendering futile the concept of religious obligation, taklif {cf. Asnawl 1999:1, 188). Ex hypothesi, a conventionally derived language has to be in place before the advent of revelation (Versteegh 1996b:25). The key figure who is identified as an opponent of istilah and the defender of the thesis of tawqif, al-Ash'ari, is reported to have been a prolific author of works, but only a small number of these is extant and no discussion of the thesis of tawqif is, found in these texts (Ibn Asakir 1982:140). The basic theological arguments for tawqif attributed to al-Ash'ari are preserved in the literature of later Ash'arite luminaries. One such work is the Mujarrad maqdldt al-shaykh Abi 'l-Hasan al-Ash'ari ("The essential theological doctrines of Al-Ash'ari") composed by one</page><page sequence="10">M. Shah / Numen 58 (2011) 314—343 323 of the school's acolytes, Ibn Furak (d. 1015), and this presents a synop tic survey of the theological doctrines professed by al-Asharl. In this work Ibn Furak confirms that al-Ash'ari was of the opinion that all languages were established via tawqif. He also refers to his having adduced the argument of infinite regress to dismiss istilah on the basis that every stage of positing the communicative meaning of language would necessarily require a preceding phase of muwada'a ad infinitum: that this is reductive means that the only plausible explanation for the origin of language was that supplied by tawqif. Ibn Furak contends that while al-Asharl accepted that the very roots of language were estab lished via tawqif, he conceded that some of the branches of languages could be determined by a process of analogy and applied endeavor (.ijtihad). Further implications of the discussions on tawqif and istilah become apparent when Ibn Furak reveals that al-Ash'arl maintained that the divine names of God and His attributes can be determined only by way of tawqif. namely, on the basis of divine instruction and decree, and that this sort of designation had to be referenced to authenticated scrip tural sources such as the Qur an and the Prophetic traditions, or indeed community consensus (Ibn Furak 1987:42). Offering a synopsis of Ash'arite doctrine, the 10th century theologian al-Baghdadi discloses that the Basran Mu'tazilites professed the belief that the names of God were derived through a process of istilah and qiyas (analogical reason ing), adding that the Sunnites (Ash'arites) believed that these divine names had been determined by virtue of tawqif (Baghdad!, 1928:116; cf. Jurjani 1998:VII, 232—4). In this context it seems evident that defer ence to tawqif was one way of countering the Basran arguments regard ing the etymology of the divine names; in his critique of the Basran Mu'tazilites' position on the divine names Ibn Hazm (d. 1064), a figure associated with a stricter form of orthodoxy, adopts a similar strategy in terms of invoking tawqif {Ibn Hazm 1985:11, 345-6). The differences between Ash'arites and Mu'tazilites on the issue of the divine names emanate from al-JubbaIs argument that it was pos sible to designate these names by way of analogy. Yet, the tawqif-istilah antithesis in respect of the origin of language had little to do with al-Jubbal's stance on this issue for he subscribed to the view that both taivqif and istilah were equally plausible theses: thus conceptually,</page><page sequence="11">M. Shah/Numen 58 (2011) 314-343 neither of them would appear to impinge upon his theory apropos the divine names (Frank 1978:29; Vasalou 2009:210-2). Still, it has been argued that the debate on this issue was boldly taken a stage further by Abu Hashim who created the construct of istilah to consolidate the arguments for designating divine names by way of analogy (Gimaret 1988:37—50; Vasalou 2009:201-3). From a broader perspective, accord ing to the Mu'tazilite concept of divine unity (tawhid), the substantive names and attributes associated with God were identical with him, but did not essentially inhere in God's essence in an entitative or hypostatic sense. It would have been argued that initially God had neither name nor attributes: these were created and designated at a later point in time. This whole discussion is related to the idea that there did not exist a unity of identity between names (asma) and the referents or entities (musammd) which they signified, but rather they were a product of the process of naming (tasmiyya) (BaqillanI 1993:258; Versteegh 1977:156-61; Burrell and Daher 2004:4-9). Ash'arites rec ognized that a number of these names and attributes were essential, existing hypostatically within God's essence; they also took the position that there existed a unity of identity between the name and the thing named (nomen and nominatum): in their view the names and attributes manifestly reflected, ontological realities of the divine essence, embody ing the qualities defined by their referents (al-Ash'arl 1990:345; BaqillanI 1993:258; cf. Ghazall 2006:9-21). Conversely, by jockeying for position on the etymology of the divine names and appealing to istilah, the Mu'tazilites could undermine the Ash'arite arguments about the nature of the divine essence. Interestingly, Abu Rashld al-Naysaburl's al-Masail includes a section which discusses the subject of "changing assigned names," stating that al-Ka bi rejected that this was possible except by virtue of revelation (■wahy). He referred to such changes as having the potential to create ambiguity for those under religious obligation (al-mukallaf). But being faithful to his Bahshamiyya allegiances, Abu Rashld pronounces that such a convention is acceptable if it has a sound purpose, citing the innovative scheme of terminology applied to the metrification of poetry by Khalll ibn Ahmad (d. 791) (Naysaburi 1979:161). Thus it would seem that the arguments about istilah favored by the Bahshamiyya were theoretically derived constructs conceived to promote the wider aim of</page><page sequence="12">M. Shab/Numen 58 (2011) 314-343 a theory about God's divine names, although whether istildb was abso lutely critical to the concatenation of arguments adduced in this respect remains somewhat vague; this is due to the fact that a number of prom inent Mu'tazillte scholars were enthusiastic advocates of tawqlf. But the thesis of istildb was also relevant to arguments about religious obliga tions, the created status of the Quran, the incidence of metaphor along with its theological import and even the idea that the acceptance of istildb would allow changes to the meaning of religious conventions and precedents (Asnawl 1999:1, 186). To deal with this cogent array of theological challenges, some of which were deemed proportionately graver than others, the proponents of orthodoxy had to come up with a robust defense which could engage with the rational arguments pro pounded by their opponents but, more significantly, also appeal to decisive scriptural proofs. The arguments among advocates of tawqif and istildh proceeded on a number of bases: firstly, there was the attestation of authenticated scriptural proofs, adillatal-sam, which were chiefly Quranic in prove nance, although it was also possible for scholars to cite an appropriate Prophetic dictum. The adillat al-sam would be separately subjected to resolution and explication by the opposing camps. Then, secondly, there were the rational arguments which dealt with demonstrating or challenging the plausibility of constructs; the argument and counter argument adduced by the respective camps often led to a circularity in the discussions. From a traditional perspective a number of factors favored those who were defenders of tawqif. Proofs from scriptural sources were seemingly closer to a revelationist perspective than a con ventionalist one; furthermore, istildh was unquestionably an innovative concept introduced at a posterior juncture in the history of Islamic thought. As the "agents of cultural memory" defenders of tawqif could create a meaning from the available scriptural proofs which brought down the scales in favor of their thesis (cf. Assmann 2006:43). The additional qualifying dicta associated with the pious ancestors, which later scholars were able to adduce, further buttressed the case for tawqif. Appealing to the authority of precedent and using the skilful juxtaposi tion of Qur anic and extra-Prophetic statements, they placed tawqif firmly within the boundaries of the legacy and teachings of the pious ancestors, presenting the doctrine as a distinction of orthodoxy. And</page><page sequence="13">326 M. Shah / Numen 58 (2011) 314—343 within this context, the elementary thesis of tawqif&amp;s derived from the corpus of scriptural evidences was "given enhanced normative value" (Assmann 2006:69). The achievement was ingenious for the advocates of tawqif had identified with a derived expression of a traditional past, a past that would enable them to counter istildh, a perceived innova tion, and the range of doctrines for which it could be exploited (Assmann 2006:28 cf. Brunner 2005:327). Scriptural evidence The Quranic verse which served as the locus classicus for the advocates of tawqif was Q 2:31. It states, "And indeed God taught the names (,asma) of all existent things to Adam; then, he showed them to the angels and announced 'inform me of the names of these if you are truthful'." For individuals such as the Malikite jurist Muhammad ibn Khuwazmandad (fl. 10 th C) the Quranic verse alone provided indubi table proof that language's origin lay in tawqif and that the names taught by God to Adam encompassed the most general of existent things and the more specific among them (Qurtubi 1988:1, 194). Pro ponents of istildh did attempt to proffer interpretive glosses of these proofs which supported their own perspectives. However, the concom itant attestation of Quranic verses and dicta associated with Compan ions and Successor figures added significant weight to the arguments for tawqif. Classical exegetical literature is replete with separate reports emanating from distinguished authorities such as Ibn Abbas (d. 687 8), 'Ikrima (d. 723), Qatada (d. 735), Mujahid (d. c. 718 or 722), and Ibn Jubayr (d. 714) in which it is proclaimed that Adam was taught the names of all things be they significant or otherwise (Tabarl 1969:1, 480-6). Although not concerned with the theoretical intricacies and implications of the arguments about tawqif and istildh, the scriptural evidence for tawqif found in exegetical sources appeared to be over whelming. Still, the traditional exegetical literature also included refer ences to much more confined interpretations of the verse, and among which were statements suggesting that God had taught Adam only the names of his offspring and the angels; indeed, even the renowned com mentator al-Tabarl (d. 922) veered towards this particular explanation</page><page sequence="14">M. Shah /Numen 58 (2011) 314—343 327 of the verse (Tabari 1969:1, 480—6). Despite this, such materials were seemingly adumbrated by proofs endorsing tawqif A number of the Quranic verses adduced by the proponents of tawqif are discussed in a Qur anic commentary by Abd al-Jabbar devoted to defending Mu'tazilite doctrine through reference to the class of verses deemed theologically contentious (mutashdbihdt). The text applies an exegesis of the Qur an in a way which shows that Mu'tazilite tenets and doctrine are commensurate with the general thrust of scrip ture, refuting opposing perspectives in the course of its discussions. Regarding Q 2:31, Abd al-Jabbar dismisses the suggestion that the verse provides scriptural proof of the validity of the doctrine of tawqif or that it undermines the idea of muwadaa (Abd al-Jabbar 1969:82-4 cf. Abd al-Jabbar 1965:V, 164-6). He stresses that it implicitly reveals that God did indeed teach Adam the names of all things, but the language which he was taught had previously been established via muwadaa. Abu Hashim's arguments about qasd and taklif are promi nently highlighted to drive home the point. Similar points are empha sized by Abu Rashld al-Naysaburl, who even includes an anonymous statement announcing that the verse in question shows that Adam was taught by God the phases of muwadaa which were at some point in the future going to be established by humans; it was implied that Adams being presciently acquainted by God with this anticipated muwadaa could serve as a divine miracle (Naysaburi 1979:161). The appeal to scripture did not end there and in the numerous trea tises which dealt with the arguments on this topic, advocates of tawqif cited further Quranic verses. One of these refers to polytheists having invoked the names of gods whom they had themselves invented: the Qur an condemns this practice more than once: both Q 12:41 and Q 53:23 state, "These are merely names you and your forebears invented and concerning which God has provided no sanction." The reasoning here is that the misguided naming and identification of such deities was grossly artificial and erroneous; this was an inherent indictment of istilah, indicating that language had been revealed via tawqif (As n awl 1999:1, 185—7). A further relevant verse is Q 30:22 which asserts "And among his signs are that he created the heavens and the earth; and (also) the diversity of your tongues (languages) and colors." For the propo nents of tawqif, the upshot of this verse was irrefutable: the diversity</page><page sequence="15">M. Shah/Numen 58 (2011) 314-343 of these languages is enumerated among the bounties and blessings bestowed by God upon humanity, providing further proof of the pre ponderance of the doctrine of tawqif. But Abd al-Jabbar retorts that some argue that the verse in question places God as the inventor of human speech. Dismissing this view, he claims that the verse did not intimate a divine role in the inception of languages, but rather it was concerned with the characteristics of the anatomy of tongues ('Abd al-Jabbar 1969:553—4). His clarification of this verse in a way which supports istilah is somewhat contrived but it is also indicative of the weight attached to countering traditional proofs. Scholarship from subsequent periods did speak of there being a contradiction of scrip tural evidences germane to the two doctrines on the origin of languages; however, in the periods when the debate of the subject was at its most intense, it is evident that the scriptural evidence was viewed as favoring tawqif. A link had been created with the identity as well as the authority of the pious ancestors, making the case for the doctrine positively unas sailable (Assmann 2006:73). Grammarians and philologists: contributions to the discourse While many of the aforementioned discussions on the origin of lan guage have been predominantly gleaned from the works of theologians, it was in the literature of the Arabic grammarians, a number of whom were of Mu'tazilite persuasion, that further analysis of the topic ensued. In a work devoted to a linguistic synthesis of the elements of the Arabic language, Ibn Jinn! (d. 1002), a grammarian of well-known Mu'tazilite leanings, includes a section on the origin of language. Ibn Jinn! does preface his remarks on the subject by stating that it is a topic which calls for prudent deliberation, although he adds that most of the ahl al-nazar ("exponents of speculative theology"), whom we can take to mean the Mu'tazilites, were of the view that the origin of language lay in tawadu (common agreement) and istildh and not tuahy (revelation) or taivqif (Ibn Jinn! 1952:1, 40-9). He then comments that his revered mentor, Abu All al-FarisI (d. 987), a distinguished Mu'tazilite grammarian, actually admitted that language was "from God" (tawqif), citing Q 2:31, "And indeed God taught Adam the names (asma) of all things." Ibn</page><page sequence="16">M. Shab/Numen 58 (2011) 314-343 Jinn! does interject that one could infer from the verse that God empow ered Adam to establish language and that this was an additional view that even al-FarisI professed in some of his discussions on the subject, as did the philologist Abu 1-Hasan al-Akhfash al-Asghar (d. 927). Ibn JinnI then proceeds to offer a traditional explanation of the Qur anic verse in which it is stated that God taught to Adam the names of all things created in all languages and that he and his offspring had spoken these languages. Ibn JinnI goes on to state that consequently, as the offspring of Adam dispersed throughout the world, they eventually adopted a particular language from among those original languages; the remainder of which became extinct. Ibn JinnI insists that if authenti cated reports affirm such a view, then it was incumbent to accept and believe in them, yielding to their import (Ibn JinnI 1952:1, 41; cf. Kopf 1956:34-6). Ibn Jinn! then sets out the theoretical thrust of the counter-position of muwadaa, explaining how interlocutors would create connections between words and meanings by way of gesticulation; he explains they would point to one of the sons of Adam and repeat themselves saying, "man, man, man" (insdn). Interlocutors would progress through lan guage in this way, defining in the process nouns, verbs, and particles. According to this view, a blueprint of muwadaa could then form the basis for different lexical codes, as selected words were assigned equiva lences in other languages. The key prerequisite for all this was the exis tence of a language initially established through muwadaa. Ibn Jinn! asserts that as far as the proponents of muwada'a are concerned, it was improper to suggest that God could be the agent of positing due to the corporeal movement associated with gesticulation, which was an act imperative to the process of naming; this is because God has no physi cal organ (jdriha). But it is speculated that God could transpose and transfer the use of established conventions, but again this would require the existence of an established language in the first place. Interestingly, Ibn Jinni proposes a solution to the predicament: was it not possible for God to create a sound in an entity or body which would then be used to identify and characterize that entity? He even points out that God would not need to repeat himself! Such an explanation would obviate the need for acts of physical gesticulation on the part of God. There appears to have been little enthusiasm for his suggestion as he explains that it</page><page sequence="17">330 M. Shah/Numen 58 (2011) 314-343 was recognized as being merely possible. An alternative explanation for the origin of language is mentioned by Ibn Jinn! and it seems to be related to the naturalist thesis referred to in Plato's Cratylus, a dialogue which deals with the correctness of names and naming (Lepschy 1994:15—29; Versteegh 1997:108). In the Greek philosophical setting the terms phusis (cpuaiq) and thesis (0eai&lt;;) are respectively identified with naturalist and conventionalist perspectives. The former term pred icates a natural affinity between words and meanings while, in contrast, thesis signifies that the connection between the two was purely arbi trary. The ensuing arguments hinged upon the nature of the relation ship between words and their meanings within a broader context of nature and law, while in the Islamic context, the issue turns on the identification of the original designator of language. The Mu'tazilite theologian Abbad ibn Sulayman championed the naturalist thesis and it is referred to by Ibn Jinn! as being a sound perspective. Abbad is reported to have spoken of a natural affinity between the collective phonemic constitution of words and their signified meanings to the extent that this intrinsic relationship determined the whole process of muwada'a. In one example Abbad is asked what the Persian word for rock conjures up? He replies, "I find in (the word) connotations of arid ity and solidity; I believe it to be a rock" (SuyutI 1970:1, 47). The objec tion to this thesis was simple: if such a natural affinity existed, then all languages would be spontaneously understood by each and everyone. Abu Rashld al-Naysaburi reports that Abbad argued that changing the name of an entity leads to a change in its character and that his Basran cohorts deemed him asinine for his views (Naysaburl 1979:161). Gram marians as early as al-Khalll ibn Ahmad were fascinated by forms of onomatopoeia as were later Basran luminaries (cf. Ibn Taymiyya 1961:418). Even Ibn Jinn! refined a theory of etymology (ishtiqdq) which was based around a common meaning intrinsic to the radicals of a particular verbal root and its permutations, a topic he expounds upon at length in this work (Ibn JinnI 1952:11, 133-9). Ibn Jinnl does not discuss the theological arguments about religious obligations and prerequisites; nor is there any reference to the debate about the use of analogical reasoning in respect of the divine names. The conspicuous absence of allusions to such themes would appear to indicate that the arguments on the issues were still evolving. The only</page><page sequence="18">M. Shah/Numen 58 (2011) 314-343 331 theological aspect of the debate touched upon in Ibn Jinnl's work relates to muwada'a and its being linked with evident acts of gesticulation which would have crude anthropomorphic implications. Finally, having scrutinized the various theses on the origin of language, Ibn JinnI explains that his reflections and deliberations on the subject over a con siderable period of time together with the authenticated scriptural evi dences had led him to conclude that it (language) was "from God Almighty" and that in his soul the belief that it was revealed via tawqif had been strengthened. This admission would seem to confirm the measure of success achieved by the proponents of tawqif as they were able to present their doctrine as one of the touchstones of orthodoxy by virtue of anchoring it to the exegetical statements of the pious ances tors. Their memory and standing would assist in securing authority for tawqif, which could then be used as an effective counter-argument against istilah and the panoply of theological doctrines for which it was exploited. Ibn JinnI was, of course, a contemporary of Abd al-Jabbar and sympathetic to the views of his Mu'tazilite peers. Other grammar ians held similar views (Loucel 1963:275). It is the case that theological and legal sources from the 10th/11th centuries reveal that scholarship was moving towards a position of neutrality {waqf) on the subject. However, for those of a stern religiosity, to speak of anyone other than God as the establisher (wadi) of language was tantamount to disbelief (Ibn Hazm 1985:V, 137). Such an attitude would ensure the enduring legacy of tawqif for despite the suggestion that the proponents of istilah eventually prevailed, many of the arguments for which it was invoked were passionately denounced (Versteegh 1996b:27). Furthermore, the concept of tawqif had served as a potent weapon in the defense of orthodoxy yet it could still be unleashed by a process of restoration, making it seemingly a timeless construct. Indeed, those individuals who opposed the theory of metaphor on theological grounds were soon invoking tawqif as one of the arguments in the refutations they set out. One of the staunchest defenses of tawqif was probably mounted by the Kufan grammarian Ibn Faris (d. 1005). This was presented in a text devoted to examining selected linguistic features and conventions of the language of Arabic. Ironically, the work was dutifully dedicated to al-Sahib ibn Abbad (d. 995), a wazir of Mu'tazilite inclinations who appointed Abd al-Jabbar as the states jurisconsult. The work was produced</page><page sequence="19">332 M. Shah / Numen 58 (2011) 314—343 in an historical period in which the Buwayhids, a Shi'ite dynasty, were in the political ascendancy The text begins with a section on tawqif and istilah which is prefaced by Ibn Faris with his profession that "the lan guage of the Arabs (is based on) tawqif." As proof of this, the locus clas sicus of tawqif, Q 2:31, together with a selection of glosses by leading Companion figures is cited. Ibn Faris endorses the explication of this verse typically associated with Ibn Abbas: namely that God taught Adam the names of all created things (Ibn Faris n.d.:7). Ibn Faris deals with one objection raised by the opponents of tawqif relaxing to the fact that the Quranic verse states "and then he showed them to the angels," in which the pronoun for animate objects is employed, apparently betraying a restrictive element to the compass of names taught by God to Adam. This phenomenon was explained by reference to the conven tion known as taghlib ("predominance"): there was nothing restrictive about the use of this pronoun, because, having brought together all of creation, that which was animate predominated over that which was not and therefore the pronoun used for the former was applied. Continuing with his emphatic endorsement of tawqif Ibn Faris states that if someone were to ask whether the nouns for sabre (sayf), sword (husdm), scimitar (adb), and other terms had their origins in tawqif and that none of these nouns was conventionally agreed upon, "We would say indeed that is our belief." To back this up he uses an argument of citation (ihtijdj). This centers on the notion that disputes concerning language usage and conventions are often settled by com mon agreement through recourse to earlier philological conventions and poetic precedents. Ibn Faris then states that if language were estab lished via muwada'a and istildh, then the resort to ihtijdj, adducing these older forms of usage would be no more authoritative than ihtijdj sourced to commonly agreed forms of usage established presently by one's contemporaries. The point made here is that the prestige and authority commanded by older forms of usage seemingly determined via tawqif would be invalid; yet conventions in terms of deference to precedents show that the reverse is true. Within Ibn Faris's conception of tawqif scant attention is paid to refuting the theoretical arguments adduced by the proponents of istildh, but rather the focus is deliberately placed upon highlighting the authority of traditional proofs endorsed through reference to the memory of the pious ancestors (salaf). Ibn</page><page sequence="20">M. Shah / Numen 58 (2011) 314—343 Faris makes an audacious claim that Arabic orthography, grammar, and the science of prosody owed their origins to tawqif, remarking that although conventional histories had associated their invention with notable scholars, such individuals had merely revived ancient disci plines of learning which had hitherto perished in time. Ibn Faris was an unquestionable defender of tawqif, although it is fair to say that much of his theology seems informed by traditional Sunni orthodoxy. Abu All al-FarisI, Ibn JinnI, and al-Akhfash al-Asghar were all of Mu'tazilite persuasion, yet they were more than prepared to endorse tawqif, despite their being ideologically close to the Basran Mu'tazilites. Moreover, during the same historical periods, Ash'arite theologians and lawyers were now adopting a less hostile attitude to istildh. Theories abounded fusing the two principal theses on the origin of language, such as the one propounded by the Shafi'ite scholar Abu Ishaq al-Isfaraylnl (d. 1027) who championed the idea that God revealed a mandatory portion of language which enabled the process of istildh to proceed. Other distinguished theologians such as Abu Bakr al-Baqillanl sanctioned a non-committal approach (Asnawi 1999:1, 190). Hie position taken by Mu'tazilite grammarians in respect of the doctrine of tawqif would seem to contradict the idea that during the course of the 9th century and beyond there existed a tension between orthodoxy and arch-rationalists on the issue. But the grammarians appear as exceptions in this regard. Their inclination to tawqif was influenced by the fact that they were utterly enthralled and captivated by the language whose virtues and features they had spent a lifetime poring over and extolling. Placing that language on the plane of tawqif was inevitable; it provided a means of conceptually accentuating the inimitability of the language in which the sacred text had been revealed. One sensitive issue raised by scholars such as Richard Frank and Kees Versteegh relates to the fact that the discussion of the origin of language did not receive much sedate reflection in the works of the Arabic lin guists. It is linguistic literature from the late 10th century in which the topic is first reviewed. Frank sees the subject area as being inspired by theological considerations and hence its appearing in the works of the ahl al-kalam (proponents of speculative theology) (Frank 1978:29). Versteegh takes the view that within the Islamic tradition such a subject was not considered paramount because a synchronic view of language</page><page sequence="21">334 M. Shah / Numen 58 (2011) 314—343 prevailed among linguists. Scholars were concerned only in engaging with the revered language in which their sacred texts were revealed, a text they believed to have been preserved over the years by divine decree. They were purely interested in the applied linguistic aspects of scholar ship in respect of that language, which to them was a statically pre served phenomenon (Versteegh 1996b: 16—19; Weiss 1987:343). It has further been suggested that following the political demise of the Mu'tazilites, many of the movement's chief proponents took refuge in the vocations of law and, indeed, grammar, within which they were able to pursue their interests, influencing the discourse and ideas gener ated within these disciplines (Makdisi 1984:16; Versteegh 1996a:592). Whether this state of affairs helped precipitate the move to a position of neutrality (waqf) on the issue of the origin of language is debatable. One notes that despite the deference to tawqif among grammarians, elaborate philological theories which they developed did contradict the underlying gist of the theory. However, they continued to maintain an allegiance to the thesis; despite the fact that tawqif had not always been a distinction of religious orthodoxy, it was generated in the attempts to counter theological innovation by appealing to the exegetical musings of the pious ancestors (Shah 2000:60). It is worth mentioning the apparent linkage between istildh and the doctrine of a created Qur an. It has been claimed that istildh was ideally suited to undermine the doc trine of an uncreated Qur an (Weiss 1974:38; Carter 1983:68; Versteegh 1996b:25; Vasalou 2009:204-5) and that there was likewise an affinity between the orthodox doctrine of an uncreated Qur an and the espousal of tawqif. However, within the body of classical literature such linkage appears to be of marginal importance to the main protagonists and therefore unlikely to have been a driving factor in the ensuing debates. Renaissance of tawqif In a treatise devoted to a refutation of the incidence of metaphor in the language of Arabic, the medieval theologian and Hanbalite scholar Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328) includes references to the doctrines of tawqif znd istilah, referring to the fact that these two theses gained ascendancy in classical Muslim discourse on the origins of language. Ibn Taymiyya</page><page sequence="22">M. Shah/Numen 58 (2011) 314-343 emphasized that istildh was a detrimental innovation, explaining that the first individual to profess it was Abu Hashim. Ibn Taymiyya explains that both al-Ash'ari and Abu Hashim had been students of al-Jubba I, but that al-Ash'arl had subsequently denounced the Mu'tazilites and their major theological doctrines (Ibn Taymiyya 1983:82). He com ments that the two students disputed over the issue of the origin of languages (mabda al-lughdt)-. Abu Hashim stated that language was the product of istildh while al-Ash'ari responded that it was established through tawqif Ibn Taymiyya observes that in later medieval periods scholars continued to debate the subject with some individuals arguing that the origin of language could be attributed to combined measures of both tawqif and istildh, reporting that many scholars adopted a posi tion of neutrality (waqf) on the issue. His reference to tawqif and istildh is broached as part of his wider critique of the concept of metaphor or trope (majaz), which was rejected by certain theologians (Ghazall 1971:74). Rational theologians were making frequent references to metaphors in order to obviate the anthropomorphic imagery presented by sensitive scriptural dicta (Heinrichs 1992:256—7). The brand of conservative theology to which Ibn Taymiyya sub scribed maintained that this resort to metaphor was an insidious attempt to promulgate heretical doctrines. Thus, in instances where there were Qur anic verses referring to God's face or hands, applying metaphor would render the former as being a reference to His essence, while the latter would be interpreted as divine grace; consequently, the device of metaphor permitted the circumvention of the literal language of scrip ture. Additionally, lexical evidence in the form of Loci probantes could be readily adduced to show that such explanations were consistent with the ancient usage of the Arabs. For the conservatives, while accepting the need to differentiate between divine and human dimensions of attributes and traits, it was deemed improper to explain away references to God in this way. Ibn Taymiyya was of the view that such instances had to be accepted bi-la kayfCwithout qualification"); namely, if God describes Himself as descending through the heavens, this descent should be accepted as defined in scripture without expressing a view about the precise nature of its modality. Those who argued that it was imperative to explain away the literal language in such instances would place such examples within the vector of majdz, stating that this was an</page><page sequence="23">336 M. Shah /Numen 58 (2011) 314—343 example of God's "mercy" descending through the heavens.5 Sensing the potency of the device of metaphor in the service of speculative theo logians such as the Mu'tazilites and others, Ibn Taymiyya set out to demolish conceptually the idea that metaphor was a feature of the Arabic idiom and the conspicuous reference to the doctrine of tawqif provided a subtle means of insinuating not only that there was an inno vative quality to istilah, but also that configured around it was an array of theologically contentious notions. By a process of renaissance tawqif was again made relevant. Although there has been a tendency to identify Ibn Taymiyya with a rigorous interpretation of tawqif and one which is typical of the con servatism with which he is often associated (Weiss 1974:40), his expli cation of tawqif \s hardly as strict as the emphatic endorsement of tawqif defined by Ibn Faris. One needs to bear in mind that the aim of Ibn Taymiyya's disquisition on metaphor was to attack the use of majaz as a theological instrument and, in the doctrine of tawqif he found a convenient accessory for his arguments. Rhetoricians divided words into haqiqa ("veridical") and majaz ("metaphorical" or "figurative") senses; the former applied when a word's usage was consistent with its primarily assigned meaning. The technical definition of a metaphor was a word or phrase which was used in a secondary sense other than its primary one; the term majaz conjures up the image of transfer or move ment from one meaning to a second one and it is likewise exemplified by instances of borrowing (isti'ara). Hence, if one were talking about a lion in its haqiqa sense, then this would be a reference to the tawny colored predator that belongs to the family of cats known for their ferociousness; conversely, if one were using the term in its majaz sense, then it would be the qualities of courageousness and valor that were intended (Abu 1-Husayn al-Basrl 1991:12). Ibn Taymiyya's reasoning is that, while the semantic compass of such terms was wholly valid, it was not necessary to construct a haqiqa-majaz division to determine such meanings; he proposed that the division of words and expressions into haqiqa and majaz classes was a later devel opment which owed its origins to the activities of groups such as the 5&gt; This would be classed as exemplifying majdz al-hadhf{an elliptical metaphor): 'mercy' is the elided element which obviates the anthropomorphic sense of the expression.</page><page sequence="24">M. Shah / Numen 58 (2011) 314—343 337 Mu'tazila and that there were ulterior motives driving the associated discourse. The general thrust of Ibn Taymiyya's critique rested on his chipping away at the theoretical edifice constructed to define majdz and haqiqa through reference to primary and secondary cycles of posited meanings which were technically connected with muwadda. Appealing to the authority of precedent, he maintains that among the pious ances tors no specific reference to these terms is found in the technical sense of metaphorical or veridical usage; thus although some scholars such as Abu 'Ubayda (d. 825) and Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855) actually utilized the term majdz, they were not referring to metaphor but rather a rudi mentary tool of linguistic interpretation and analysis (cf. Heinrichs 1984:122-5). The contention that majdz was not a feature of the Quran or, indeed, the Arabic language was principally propounded by scholars associated with the Zahirl tradition, a theological move ment which also condemned the use of analogical reasoning in all reli gious matters (Asnawi 1999:1.302).6 Interestingly, many of those who rejected istilah, such as Ibn Khuwazmandad, were actually opponents of the concept of metaphor. It is also the case that philological concepts discussing the incidence of synonyms (tardduf), homonyms (ishtirdk), antonyms (addad), and etymology (ishtiqdq) in the language of Arabic were vehemently opposed by some defenders of taivqlf. They were of the view that these concepts per se presupposed a deficiency or inherent flaw in the design of language. Having spent some time outlining the standard definitions of majaz and haqiqa, the point is made that such definitions presupposed an acute awareness of the stages of positing meaning and the "givenness" of language. It suggests that a word was first used for one meaning before being transferred to another. Ibn Taymiyya presents the argu ment that such a view would be in accordance with the beliefs of those who professed that languages were based on istildh: namely, that a group of intelligent individuals came together and commonly agreed upon the designation of words and meanings, applying them to all languages; this, in his estimation, was a view no one before Abu Hashim actually 6&gt; Dawud b. Khalaf al-Zahiri (d. 883) is the founder of this movement and his son Abu Bakr b. Dawud al-Isfahanl rejected that majdz featured in the Qur an or the traditions.</page><page sequence="25">338 M. Shah/Numen 58 (2011) 314-343 held. Ibn Taymiyya protests that it is impossible to state categorically that people actually came together and assigned all the lexical items found in all languages with their posited meanings before actually using them. His conclusion is that all one can ascertain, in the sense of broad authentication, is that certain words are employed (isti'mal) for speci fied meanings and nothing else (Ibn Taymiyya 1983:82—6). Ibn Taymiyya seems to accommodate a greater measure of flexibility in explaining the historical evolution of language for he recognizes that a rigidly formulated doctrine of tawqif could never be fully substanti ated through reference to the scriptural sources. Thus, in many ways, his critique of istilah rests upon underscoring its innovative texture. He does see tawqif as being emblematic of a divinely inspirational dynamic which accounts for both the establishment of language and its subse quent acquisition. He even uses the Arabic word ilhdm ("inspiration") alongside tawqif to highlight this process. Within such an interpreta tion, the notion that istilah, together with its concomitant phases of muwada'a, serves as the sine qua non for the use of language is rendered redundant. Nonetheless, the inference is not that all languages are traced back to Adam but rather that humans were imbued with an innate capacity to express and communicate desires and thoughts through the medium of words, adding that ilhdm sufficiently explains the ability to articulate language without pre-existing muwada'a-, in essence, this explanation is the embodiment of his thesis of tawqif {Ibn Taymiyya 1983:86). The critique of majaz outlined by Ibn Taymiyya was taken up with alacrity by his loyal student Ibn Qayyim (d. 1350). Prominent in his treatment of this subject is the view that the majority of scholars (,al-jumhiir) were of the belief that language was revealed via tawqif (Ibn Qayyim 1990:233); the reference to this doctrine's having been the preferred dogma of the pious ancestors formed one of the first structured phases of his critique of majaz. Ibn Qayyim was not con cerned with launching into an energetic defense of the revelationist view of language, but, like his mentor, his focus was upon dismissing the possibility that one could unravel successive cycles of convention ally positing words with meaning. What is striking about Ibn Qayyim's treatment of the topic is not only his marshalling of all the technical arguments for and against majaz together with the theological import</page><page sequence="26">M.Shab/Numen58(2011)3l4—343 339 of the discussions, but also his reference to the theory of majaz being an innovation which occurred after the (preferred) first three centuries of the Islamic tradition. He is naturally alluding to the Prophetic utter ance in which mention is made of the finest of centuries being the one in which the Prophet lived followed by the two ensuing centuries. The inference is that the authenticated precedents, beliefs, and practices defined in these select periods are authoritative and even sacrosanct. Given their historical genesis and provenance, neither majaz nor istilah could claim this coveted status; conversely, the thesis of tawqifznjoyed the imprimatur of community consensus (Ibn Qayyim 1990:233). In this sense the hierarchy of authority created by reference to the identity of the pious ancestors provided critical leverage for tawqif and Ibn Qayyim could build on this before commencing with the theoretical case against majaz. Conclusions In the context of the classical articulation of orthodox Islam, the nor mative practices and beliefs of the faith were ultimately anchored to and informed by a synthesis of Qur anic and Prophetic paradigms. Within this hierarchy of authority, apposite importance was attached to the teachings and musings of the pious ancestors, namely, those indi viduals who were either Companion figures or individuals among later generations of adherents of the faith. Certainly, within the realm of speculative theology many of the arguments and points of dispute were the product of dialectical discussions and postulates; yet, where possi ble, it was still relevant to seek a point of reference or support for such ruminations in the traditional sources. The so-called adillat al-sam ("proofs from the authenticated corpuses of scripture") were the desid eratum for the resolution of theological quandaries, although groups with conflicting ideologies would resort to interpreting such proofs in a manner commensurate with their preconceived views. This is certainly the case for the history of arguments about the origin of language. The thesis of istilah served as a platform for theologically contentious doc trines, including arguments about the imposition of religious and moral obligations, the nature of the divine names and attributes, the employment</page><page sequence="27">340 M. Shah / Numen 58 (2011) 314-343 of metaphor, and, in the view of some, the doctrine of a created Qur an. The developed doctrine of tawqif was made authoritative by its being seemingly cast through a reconstruction of the past and presented as a distinction of orthodoxy; the accentuation, explication, and contextu alization of general scriptural evidences made this reconstruction of the past possible. The less stringent attitude adopted by many theologians to the espousal of either the concept of tawqif ox istilah did not dimin ish the orthodox pedigree of the former doctrine in terms of its being reminiscent of the memory of the pious ancestors. Moreover, that the thesis of tawqif was invoked when needed as an emblem of traditional orthodoxy, no more so than in the discussions on the incidence of met aphor in the language of Arabic, would seem to underline the role that referencing to the past and the processes of generation historically played in the defense of orthodoxy.
