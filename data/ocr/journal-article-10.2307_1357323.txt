B. 586 Jerusalem A recently published cylinder seal (Lapp 1989: 5, fig. 4) from Bdb edh-Dhraf, identified as "unique among the finds of the ancient Near East," was dated to the EB III on the basis of accompanying material. The diminutive size of the object, its pro- venience in a pit, its presence at a site occupied throughout the entire Early Bronze Age, and several parallels in the motifs it bears, are all factors that recommend a reappraisal of the date and significance of this object. T he object is described as a "large" cylinder seal of pink alabaster on which appears the upper portion of an anthropomorphic figure (fig. 1) within a pattern of squares with X's within (fig. 2). The depiction of the torso is only partial and attached to it are two stick arms bent at the el- bows. The forearms are raised and the more com- plete bears three fingers in the form of a trident. This part of the image appears en face. An addi- tional line, perhaps of the lower portion of the im- age, could, in light of an iconographic parallel (see below), be the beginnings of a leg in profile. The figure was left unfinished. The head and long, thick neck appear in profile. Several of the features of the head are well defined with an eye, the nose, and the chin prominently displayed. The mouth, so far as may be discerned from the published evidence, is only slightly de- marcated. As a whole the head is rendered almost realistically, in contrast to the stick-like depiction of the limbs and torso. Lapp's suggestion that this figure is incomplete and that the pattern of squares with x's within, was incised onto the entire seal afterwards, appears to be correct. That explains the position of the profiled head within the sole square that is not adorned with an x. The claim that this object is a... "unique artis- tic attempt, most likely by a local artisan" is debat- able solely on additional evidence found within the same study, and on a number of parallel represen- tations. Seal impressions 777 (fig. 3) and 777A, also from Bib edh-Dhr&amp;c, both attributed to one vessel, are dated, on the basis of contextual evi- dence, to EB I (Lapp 1989: 3). They are only par- tial impressions of a seal but they bear virtually the same motif of squares with x's as that found on the cylinder, with the addition in several squares of a vertical line through the center of the x. Thus the dominant motif on the cylinder seal is paralleled at the same site. These sherds are, in fact, the only good parallels known to date for this motif. Lapp's research (1989: 3) into the glyptic of Syria and Mesopotamia indicates additional, al- though somewhat distanced parallels for this motif, which strengthens her contention that the two im- pressions should be dated to the EB I horizon. Pre- sumably the impressions are on sherds that are not of wares that would exclude them from being dated to the EB I. An incised figure (fig. 4) on a storage jar of Egyptian manufacture (Yeivin 1967: 45-46; Brandl 1989: 371, fig. 11) from Tel Erani is a close icono- graphic parallel to the figure on the Bab edh-Dhrac cylinder. Composed of two noncontiguous frag- ments of one vessel, the reconstructed drawing in- cludes a portion of a torso with raised arm and head in profile while on the lower fragment is a depic- tion of the midsection, posterior, legs, feet, and the crook of a second elbow.

The hand bears a fourth finger. A long triangle is used to denote the neck on which the head is placed.' The features are more sche- matic than on the Bib edh-Dhrac seal, with the bot- tom of the nose and the mouth formed by a line oblique to a gap in the profile. The forehead and possibly an eye are indicated by a thickly incised line at the top of the nose. The lower portion of the anatomy is more nearly a three quarters view with the exception of the legs, which are in true profile. The midsection is shown almost en fare but the pronounced curve of the buttocks appended to it in profile, gives it a misshapen appearance. The legs are clearly drawn with a division into tapering thighs and well rounded, perhaps muscular calves. The feet are open ended and are portrayed in partial profile as if the viewer were looking down at them from the side. An interesting feature is the x-like mark incised onto the midsection of the figure. In light of parallels (see below) it is suggested that this may be understood as a somewhat less than successful attempt at depicting a belt or analogous article of apparel girdling the waist (see below). Al- ternately it may depict a more voluminous garment. Although many of the components of these figures are mere stick-like approximations of por- tions of human anatomy, they are, in their naive way, reminiscent of the stylized Egyptian manner of portraying humans, partially in profile and par- tially en fare. More successfully conveyed is the attitude of these figures with their bent elbows, upraised forearms and widely splayed fingers. Clearly we are not dealing here with a stylistic school of art in any real sense, but rather with what appears to be an accepted mode of portrayal of a specific and meaningful stance, a convention that seems to be not a little at home in the milieu of EB I cult and ritual. Depictions of humans in similar attitudes, all in- cised somewhat crudely on a pavement apparently associated with a shrine of Stratum XIX at Megiddo (Loud 1948: pls. 271:1 [c307], 2 [d282], 3 [c322], Plate 273:5 [c308], 6 [c309], 275:11 [c336]), indicate the symbolic nature of this pos- ture. Similarly these equally unsophisticated por- trayals share the same use of mixed, profile and en face perspectives that distinguish the figures from B&amp;b edh-Dhr&amp;C and Tel Erani, although the bodies and limbs from the Megiddo group tend to be somewhat more realistic and less schematic (e.g., fig. 5). Only one of this group, [c336], may have stick arms. The inclusion of a narrow band at the</page><page sequence="3">1993 A CYLINDER SEAL FROM BAB EDH-DHRAc 123 Fig. 5. An anthropomorphic representation with appurte- nances from the stone pavement of Megiddo XIX. After Loud 1948: pl. 273:5. waists of most of the figures from Megiddo is clearly meant to depict a belt or similar garment. The similarity among all these representations is striking. They not only share a lack of sophistica- tion, understood here as a sign that they were done by artists of amateur standing, but they also evince a single concept. They are the product of a unified intent to represent the human figure in a particular attitude that is quite clearly of a nonprosaic nature. This seems to be some ritually significant act of worship2 which may have been depicted commonly in such a manner. A number of additional objects from EB I deposits at Bib edh-Dhrac show figures in the same attitude with upright arms; presumably they also are of cultic significance. They include several figurines of females derived from EB IA tombs (Schaub and Rast 1989: 274-89), a female figurine with a pot in place of its head (Amiran 1989: fig. 4), and a small jar decorated with schematic, stick-like representations of the upper portions of humans with raised forearms (Saller 1964-65: 166-68, fig. 18:5; referred to Lapp 1989: 5). These last two objects are apparently derived from looted EB I tombs at the same site.3 While none of the objects is particularly close in style to the incised figures (clearly the female representations are quite different in concept from the either male or asexual depictions discussed above) this specific attitude is one which is attested in a number of artistic representations at Bab edh- Dhrac in the EB I.

After Petrie 1896: pl. 51:1906. The Tel Erani storage jar is without doubt an import, and since the figure was incised before firing,4 the work was presumably done by an Egyp- tian in Egypt.5 The "pink alabaster" of the cylinder seal seems also to have originated in Egypt,6 but whether or not that object was incised there is un- known. In light of a small body of evidence, the latter possibility does not seem especially remote. Thus the presence of these incised figures from Bab edh-Dhrac and Tel Erani on objects that may have originated in Egypt may be significant, al- though the full ramifications of this Egyptian "con- nection" are as yet unclear. Brandl's observation that the incised figure on a palette from Tarhkan (fig. 6; Petrie 1914: pls. 6:1579, 24:98d) is a good parallel to the incised figure on the Egyptian jar from Erani (and there- fore to that on the cylinder from Bdb edh-Dhric) gives much credence to the case for an Egyptian origin for these artistic endeavors.7 Although there do not seem to be, for the present, any other particularly striking parallels from Egypt for these representations, the theme of humans with raised arms is one that, while not par- ticularly common, is also not entirely out of place there. Figurines showing the same stance are found as early as the Amratian period (Petrie 1896: pl. 59:6; Petrie 1920: pl. 3:4; Hoffman 1984: fig. 36). Some examples of a similar posture derive from Egyptian contexts of the Late Predynastic and Early Dynastic periods. They include: sealings</page><page sequence="4">124 ELIOT BRAUN BASOR 290-291 from Tarkhan (Petrie, Wainright, and Gardiner 1913: pl. 2:3, marks on pottery from Tarkhan (Pet- rie 1914: pl. 30:1, pl. 31:65, 139) and Naqada (fig. 7; Petrie 1896: pl. 51:1906,8 1915,9 the upper portion of a figure in relief on a "black topped" vase from Naqada Tomb 1449 (Capart 1905: fig. 98, third from left) and several figures on painted jars (Baumgartel 1955: 64, fig. 14; Petrie 1920: pl. 18:74). Similarly, locally made seal impressions of Egyptian inspiration from CEn Besor (Porat 1989: 60) also feature figures in profile with upraised arms bent at the elbows (Schulman 1976: fig. 1:8, 14, 15) as well as detached arms in the same atti- tude (Schulman 1980: fig. 1:28-30). CONCLUSIONS It seems likely that the Cylinder Seal from Bab edh-Dhrac originated in Egypt in EB I and that it was imported to the site. A number of additional Egyptian alabaster objects, maceheads, were found at B&amp;b edh-Dhrac (Rast 1980: 6-7; Schaub and Rast 1989: 290-91, 293) indicating that this is not a unique import there. Thus it would seem that there is more evidence of contacts between at least one site of the Dead Sea Plain and Egypt than even Lapp (1989: 11) suspected. The iconography of these rather simplistic hu- man representations, perhaps Egyptian in inspira- tion, is to some extent shared by the group of incised figures on the pavement of the Megiddo Stratum XIX twin temples. In the absence of fur- ther information, one can only wonder whether the inspiration for this group of illustrations, presum- ably with cultic significance, may not indeed also have derived from a similar quarter, as has previ- ously been suggested by Amiran (1992).1o ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I thank P.

NOTES 1The elongated point of the triangle protrudes into the head giving the impression that it literally was stuck upon the neck. 2Whether by supplicant or deity is unsure. 3A stick figure, one of two forming what is inter- preted as a scene (Amiran 1972) on a stele from Arad also exhibits this same stance with bent elbows, upraised forearms and splayed fingers. This object is dated to the EB II period and may not be germane to this discussion. 41 wish to thank B. Brandl of the Israel Antiquities Authority for this information. 5Although Egyptian pottery has been found in sizable quantities at sites in southern Canaan in the EB I period (Gophna 1976; 1990; Porat 1989, Ch. 9; Ben-Tor 1991) evidence of Egyptian potters working there is derived from the so-called "Egyptianized" pottery, vessels of lo- cal fabrics exhibiting Egyptian technology. Thus it seems likely that this vessel was imported as a finished product rather than in the form of raw material. 6In the absence of any provenience study for this stone one may only hazard a guess as to its possible ori- gin. Alabaster is found in Egypt and is known to be im- ported to sites in Canaan in the Chalcolithic (Mallon et al. 1934: 71, P1. 35:4; Ussishkin 1980: 21) and EB I periods (Schaub and Rast 1989: 292-93. A portion of an alabaster macehead, presumably of Egyptian manu- facture, has been found by this writer in a Late EB I con- text at Horvat Illin near Beth Shemesh). 7The stance of this figure is the same but the figure on the palette holds what appears to be a mace in one hand and a staff in the other. Interestingly, the nose and eyes are quite clearly demarcated on the profiled head while the mouth is less emphasized. The torso of this figure is shown en faCe, while the lower portion of the anatomy is in 3/4 view with the outline of the buttocks and calves emphasized. A narrow belt-like object girdles the waist. 8The iconography of this figure is somewhat remi- niscent of those from Israel and Jordan. It has the same 3/4 profile with the fingers clearly defined although in other details it differs. 9This figure is represented only from the neck down and is juxtaposed with an equid-like representation. loThere is little material evidence to suggest the pres- ence of Egyptians at Megiddo in the EB I (Amiran 1974: 8). However, the depictions of a warrior (king?) bran- dishing a mace and a human figure between two lions rearing up on their hind legs, from a tomb in Hierakon-</page><page sequence="5">1993 A CYLINDER SEAL FROM BAB EDH-DHRAc 125 polis (Kemp 1991: fig. 11, fig. 14: upper right, fig. 16: lower) should be noted in this context. These figures share a number of features with the depictions from Megiddo Stratum XIX, aspects lending credence to Amiran's suggestion of an "Egyptian artist," including upright arms bent at the elbows, the 3/4 profile and a belt-like piece of apparel around the waist.
