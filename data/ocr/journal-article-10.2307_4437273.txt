Despite our increasing knowledge of the oyster there is very little of this information available in a formn for use in high school biology, and this booklet does not go far in supplying the deficiency. It is an "informal account," designed to tell the layman "all about"' the oyster business in Willapa Bay, California. It "touches on science, econom- ics, history, art and other fields," according to the author's own words, andl should de- light the soul of the intregrationist. In spite of the lack of straight biology and the resort to anthropomorphism, it is good reading. The author seems to have had a good timie writing it. For a layman's ae- count, it is unusually accurate-except on the few occasions when the author tells what he has heard about eastern and gulf oysters- and is especially informnative on the trans- plantation of the Japanese oyster to Califor- nia waters B.

Appleton-Cen- tury Co., New York. ix + 239 pp. $1.50. This book is a report of the National Com- mnission on Cooperative Curriculum Plan- iniig. Its purpose is to present general prin- ciples for the improvement of teaching in the high school. There are elevein chapters writ- ten by and for teachers of social studies, English, journalism, speech, foreign lan- guages, natural sciences, mathematies, homie econoimics, physical education, business edu- cation, and art. The last two chapters dis- cuss the school library and "Our EImerging Life-Centered Curriculum." The editor notes that "not all of the reports have been officially endorsed . . . , but all of themn rep- resent the mature thinking of authorized committees, anid may be regarded as official or semni-official statements." There are few specific suggestions for day- to-day classroom teaching methods. General principles are presented as guides in the selection of subject matter and teaching pro- cedures. Emphasis falls on three needs in high school teaching: 1. better trained, bet- ter informed teachers; 2. more consideration of pupils' developing personalities and less of isolated information; 3. miore use of the pupil's own life experienees in his own com- munity. In order to supply these needs the committee recommends that teacher training institutions provide more opportunities for students to see the inter-relationiships among specialized fields of knowledge. For high school teachers in service the commnlittee ree- ommends that each teacher keep informed of the objectives of all other teachers and adjust his teaching to the personal and social needs of individual pupils. "Each teacher," says the chapter on social studies, "is expected to assume responsibility for the entire field of unspecialized knowledge." GEORGE C. JOHNSON, State Teachers College, Emporia, Kansas</page></plain_text>
