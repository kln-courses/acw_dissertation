<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES CAUSALITY: CAUSES AS CLASSES NATHANIEL LAWRENCE JL he concept of absolute determinism has outlived its com panion concepts, those of absolute space, absolute time, and absolute motion. Its survival in common thought and in classical mechanics rests on three factors, (a) the keenness of its promulgation, (b) the refusal of its defenders to use any language other than that of "efficient causation," (c) its great usefulness, (a) is a matter of rhetoric and has little to do with the worth of the idea of absolute determinism, (b) deserves brief attention. Those who employ only the language of efficient causation in the effort to understand the course of nature will clearly be able to explain in terms of efficient cause alone. They are involved in a harmless methodological circularity. However, the warrant for confining one's discourse to efficient causation can not be issued in the same limited dialect which it defends. Otherwise a simple circularity becomes a begging of the question. The question itself can not be further discussed without an analysis of the concept of purpose in nature,1 but it should be noticed in passing that the idea of purposeful man emerging" from purposeless nature constitutes a special problem for any effort to reduce all understanding of nature to the language of efficient cause. The present essay is primarily concerned with (c). By analyzing the usefulness of the idea of efficient causation I shall expose its primarily classificatory function and the intrinsic limits which this function of the idea prescribes for it. The plan of these remarks is as follows: (1) to exhibit the classificatory function of the causal analysis, (2) to show how this function operates in the relation between categorical and hypothetical assertions, (3) to show briefly how it operates in counterfactual and dispositional assertions, and (4) to show the role of this function in the 1 The present paper is intended as a propaedeutic to such an exam ination.</page><page sequence="2">162 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE identification of events. Then I shall (5) relate the limits of causal classification to those of predicative classification and (6) show briefly the significance of this functional view of causal determin ism for Freudian psychology. Each of the topics must be treated only in so far as it bears on the rest, and important questions in each area will therefore be by-passed. In one sense the applica tions to Freudian psychology constitute the primary target of the study, since it is in that field that classical determinism has enjoyed a notorious renaissance. It is there also that the great practical significance of the question about determinism lies. I We turn to the topic of causal determinism. To what end are causal relationships discovered and organized into the language of causal laws? Hume showed with lucidity that if we attend to discriminable cause and effect we are likely to discover only a contiguous with h and always followed by it. I am not convinced that the analysis he gives us is legislative for all examples, even where cause and effect come strictly under sense-observation. For instance, when I see the rain making the ground wet, I observe a sequence where a and h are less discriminable than in the case of one billiard ball hitting another. Hume's time-chopping analysis will not serve, without modification, to account for continuous processes of large temporal span, or blurred boundaries between cause and effect. One reason for Hume's inadequacy in this matter is that he vacillates, in his treatment of causality, between focusing his attention on objects and focusing it on events. Objects have a discreteness which serves Hume's purpose well. This discreteness they often lend to the events of which they are aspects, especially when the events discerned are simple in object-content and abrupt in realization. But the causal relationship is of course primarily and essentially one which holds between events, and events have a way of having blurred boundaries and overlapping content. The issue is, however, a distraction and cannot be pursued here. Let us accept Hume's analysis as a working model. Now let us consider three types of causal statement: (a) "This</page><page sequence="3">CAUSALITY: CAUSES AS CLASSES 163 morning Jim made one end of his balloon bulge by squeezing the other end." Here is specificity of agent, object, time, and act. The statement is a mere assertion of an instance of causal relationship, (b) "If you squeeze a balloon that has been blown up, the pressure on the gas inside will be exerted somewhere else in the balloon." Here we have a statement in the form of a law. It is not very precise, nor is it of a high order of generality. Its weaknesses are those of common sense generalizations which appear in everyday language, (c) "Equal volumes of different gases vary equally under varying pressure and temperature." Here we have a causal law of great generality, founded on direct observation and claiming predictive significance. This law has been chosen because it illustrates with unusual clarity a feature common to all causal laws, namely, that they assert classification of type. Another way of expressing it is to say that differences of chemical composition in gases make no difference with regard to certain specified physical characteristics; ail gases are of the same type, in respect to the functions of pressure, temperature, and volume. Analogously, we might say that all anthropoids are of the same type in respect to the functional relationship between heart and lungs.2 Causal claims, in so far as they fall under the purview of science,3 range from the very particular to the very general. But the particular claims are groundless and unpersuasive, unless they are relatable to other instances which can be grouped under a unifying causal law. If I say, "The iron bar moved from left to right because a current was sent through the solenoid," I am not likely to be challenged. The event has many similar instances; furthermore, the law under which all these instances are subsumed is itself subsumable under still more general laws, those of electro magnetism. However, if I say, " The tree moved from left to right because I whistled at it," this claim is wholly unpersuasive. It is of the same form as the prior one, but the event claimed has no companion instances. Furthermore, even if there were com 2 The analogy clearly shouldn't be pursued too far. We would obviously expect greater simplicity in quantitative correlation for the gases. 3 Throughout the rest of the essay I shall use the words "cause," "causal," etc., unless otherwise qualified, with this restriction assumed.</page><page sequence="4">164 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE panion instances, the law elicitable from them would stand as a puzzle, lacking as it would more general laws to which it could be related. The progress of science rests on the elimination of ad hoc generalizations. Causal statements (in the sense identified above) function as modes of classification. Indeed, many types of classification which do not employ overtly causal syntax actually turn out, on inspection, to be expressions of causal claims. Some of these are examined directly below. In the history of philosophy this fact has been sporadically noticed. The extent of the relationship between causal analysis and ordinary classification seems little noticed, however, and the implication of the relationship for determinism appears to have been largely ignored. II Categoricais and Hypotheticals. In contemporary philosophy the most thorough attention to the analysis of categorical proposi tions into hypotheticals has been given by C. I. Lewis.* There is a clearcut classical precedent in Kant, given in propositional terms, and an illustration.5 The notion is older than Kant, however, and is discernible in Berkeley: That a few original ideas may be made to signify a great number of effects and actions, it is necessary they be variously combined together. And to the end their use be permanent and universal, these combina tions must be made by rule, and with wise contrivance. By this means abundance of information is conveyed to us, concerning what we are to expect from such and such actions, and what methods are proper to be taken for the exciting such and such ideas.6 The passage is extraordinarily pregnant, (a) It exhibits?in the first sentence?the suggestion which I wish to press home, 4 An Analysis of Knowledge and Valuation (LaSalle, Illinois, 1946); see especially Chapter VIII. 5 Critique of Pure Reason, B 141; see translation by Norman Kemp Smith (London, 1933), p. 159. 6 A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge, sec. 65; The Works of George Berkeley, ?d. A. C. Fraser (Oxford, 1901), I, 294. Kant's remarks on Berkeley are disproportionate to his indebtedness to Berkeley.</page><page sequence="5">CAUSALITY: CAUSES AS CLASSES 165 the use of causal identification as a mode of classification, (b) The second sentence is almost importable into the Kantian text on the a priori functions of the categories, as far as remarks about rule go.7 (c) The third sentence clearly suggests that the justification of predication lies in the procedures of verification of the predicative claim. This suggestion patently opens the door to the representation of categorical assertions as constituted of predictive hypotheticals. E.g., "The ice is very thick," can be partly represented through, "If I skate on the ice, it won't break," partly through, "If a section be cut through the ice and a yardstick applied to its vertical dimensions, the coincidence of termini will en compass a number of units greater than is common," etc. It is not the claim of the present paper that such translatability necessarily requires the use of the concept of cause. But I do claim that when the causal category is used?as in mechanistic determinism, for instance? as an explanation of natural fact, every objectively descriptive sentence whose overt function is that of classification is representable in a set of assertions employing the syntax of causal explanation. Suppose I say, "The ball is heavy." From this sentence I can assume the following: (i) "If it is dropped on a normal lawn, it will make a dent in the lawn." I can also assume (ii), "If you support it in your hand, familiar pressure sensations will be present in marked degree." It will be noticed that the two examples are different in kind. In (i) "cause" and "effect" are both "out-there." In (ii) the "cause" is "out-there," but the "effect" is not. In order to avoid the labyrinth of questions involved in the causal theory of perception, we must concentrate our attention on the first kind of sentence, while admitting that all such sentences, if they propose to be significant for possible experience, must be themselves reducible to sentences of the second sort, since ultimately it is persons who verify, whether or not a device be interposed. That the empirical significance of categorical propositions is presentable in a set of hypotheticals employing causal syntax demonstrates only the intimacy between causal analysis and conventional classification. In the first place, representations like 7 Those on contrivance would fall, as concerned with expediency, under empirical analysis. Kant would not readily use the two standards at once.</page><page sequence="6">166 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE "If a section be cut through the ice, etc.," might be regarded as of dubious "causal" construction. Secondly, the aim of the present remarks is to show the classificatory function of causal analysis, not to show that all classification is represen table in causal terms. However, the functional identity between predicative assertions and those of manifest causal construction is not exhausted by examples of the sort given above. These all rest upon the notion of future time through which, if the state of affairs be subject to some agency, certain results will ensue. But this resting of empirical significance on verifiability deals with only half a world. The world is also accomplished fact, done with but not gone. We use description also for the identification of this part of the world. The "if-thens" dealing with future time are useless. Consider the example: (a) "This is a tiger's footprint." Here is a case of simple predication; its justification can be stated also as mere predication, i.e. ". . . since all tigers' footprints are of this pattern." However, the assertion and its justification are thinly disguised causal claims: (b) "This print was made by a tiger [since tigers make prints like this]." (a) and (b) are very closely analogous in meaning, and in practical import are exchangeable; (a) is an instance of conventional classification, and (b) employs the causal connective "made." The identifica tion of a cause is a way of classifying the event or, derivatively, the object (i.e. the making of the mark or, derivatively, the mark), in terms of its origins. The timewise linkage of events (this-mark-made, linked to tiger-pressing-paw-here) is as surely a mode of classification as any sheer attribution or predication of qualities.8 Qualitative predication is indeed reproducible in causal terms. The point is that causal explication of predication is not confined to prediction alone. The unpacking of a categorical proposition merely in terms of what the future holds is quite arbitrary. For instance, "The ice is very thick" is just as significantly reproducible as "The water of which this ice is composed was subjected to 8 It should be clear that if we permit a causal theory of perception, not only some but all sentences asserting the predication of mere qualities are translatable to causal assertions, generally to some form of hypothetical; e.g., "The fire is hot" leads to "If I touch the fire, I will have certain sensations."</page><page sequence="7">CAUSALITY: CAUSES AS CLASSES 167 extreme cooling." Again, "This is a tiger's footprint" can be significantly, though of course not exhaustively, made to yield, "If I pour plaster of Paris into this indentation, the resultant mold will be in the shape of a tiger's paw." What directs common attention to the translations of categoricals into causal hypothet icals about the future is that such hypotheticals may be cleanly decided with the passage of time. The claim that the substance I have in my hand is sodium phosphate is assessable in a way that the dating of the evolution of soft-bodied animals is not. But it is a mistake to rest the case for the meaning of assertions on the ease with which they can be assessed as to their truth or falsity. Both the past and the future, as being the scene of causal inter connections, are embraced in predicative classification. The predicates so obtained are complex summaries of causal relation ships encountered, repeated, surmised, predicted, anticipated, etc. For example, pressure feeling, dent-making, etc., get synthesized into the adjective "heavy," and this adjectival term may in turn become hypostasized into "weight." The synthesis is always open, of course, that is, subject to refinement and/or addition. Thus Newton refined the notion of weight to that of mass by adding to it the conception of gravitational behavior. The point is that the synthesis brings together under univocal simple predication a complex causal classification which is available for unpacking. Ill Contrafactuals and dispositionals. The treatment of causal categorization as a mode of classification throws some rather obvious light on both contrafactual statements and disposition terms. The relation between contrafactual statements, disposition terms, and causal claims has been often remarked upon, but preoccupation with truth in terms of truth tables and with the range of quantifiers has precluded less formal considerations which might have been more fruitful. Consider this statement: "If the Navv had had Von Braun, they would have had the first U.S. satellite." Both the p and the q of this conditional are false. On the truth tables, interpreted</page><page sequence="8">168 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE according to the paradigm p D q, it would thus be true on logical grounds alone, and hence no material consideration could be brought against it. Such an interpretation is clearly comic. In the example given, the truth value of the conditional is not a mere function of the truth value of its subordinate propositions.9 The credibility of the contrafactuals depends on an analysis of the propositions into terms. Further, the terms of many contra factuals do not univocally designate the same entity wherever they occur. Rather, we may have to look to the consequent to decide what the terms in the antecedent are naming. Then we may have grounds for assessing the alleged dependency of q upon p. Suppose, for example, we take "If the Navy had had Von Braun" as the antecedent in every case, and use the following sentences as consequents : (1) They would have had the first U. S. satellite. (2) Their top missile scientist would have had two words in his last name. (3) Their top missile scientist would have been German born. (4) They couldn't have counted on their chief for Chinese translations. Each of these consequents determines a different designation for "Von Braun." The whole man is not needed. Only a limited abstraction, defined in each case by the consequent, is required. Other characteristics, e.g., his marital status, might be required for the judging of other contrafactuals whose consequents call them forth. Probably all that is needed in (1) is an intellect complete with its motivation. Someone could, of course, insist that being German born is essential to being a Von Braun, and then we would be dealing with a somewhat more concrete entity, but still less than the whole. (2) is certifiable on logical grounds alone, the entity here designated by "Von Braun" being a very pale abstraction of a single characteristic. What is needed in (3) is a certain biological fact in a particular plot of geography. In (4) we have a characteristic?in this case a negative one, ignorance of 9 Indeed, the term "truth-value" should be dropped, since many appar ent contrafactuals are elliptical probability assertions (e.g., "If you had been born in the nineties, you'd like the new styles").</page><page sequence="9">CAUSALITY: CAUSES AS CLASSES 169 Chinese?shared by a populous class of scientists. The man examined is in each case given in partial view, put in some status, rendered a member of some class, German-born, non-literate in Chinese, etc. The classification given in (1), however, is a claim not enjoying the decidability of the other three examples. It is not only based on a contingency?in some sense this is true of both (3) and (4)?it is based on a contingency of a different sort, one requiring the conjoint estimate of a number of factors; it is an estimate aimed at the evaluation of the causal efficacy of the factors involved: Braun-in-action, Navy-in-action (as well as a number of unmentioned factors: budget, subordinate personnel, amount of time off for appearing before Congressional committees, etc.) Contrafactual conditionals which do not rely upon logical relations for their acceptability affirm types of causal relationships to hold generally, which, therefore, had they been present in the particular case under examination, would have eventuated in such and such a way. The validation of contrafactuals of this latter variety depends upon two factors: first, there must be clarity as to how to unpack the terms employed. In the examples above, "Von Braun" is the same name throughout. The entity designated by the use of this term in each case is an abstract entity, less than the whole Von Braun, but all that is needed for the argument in question. Each of these entities is at least distinguishable from the rest, although given the same linguistic label. Secondly, tvhen the abstract entity is clearly discerned, the degree of plausibility of the argument rests upon the accuracy with which the causal characteristics that comprise the abstract entity can be estimated; e.g., in (1) Von Braun's insight, application, determination, research skill, etc., all are estimated by discerning their past effectiveness. The subject of contrafactual conditionals leads easily to that of dispositionals or disposition terms. Usually these expressions have been employed to refer to predicates given for substantive terms, where the predication is not verifiable by simple inspection: "Table sugar is water-soluble," "Water is an incompressible fluid," "Lead is easily fused." Disposition terms are commonly taken to refer to essentials; i.e., if it isn't water-soluble, it is not table sugar. These disposition terms serve as defining characteristics of the</page><page sequence="10">170 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE given class. I shall say that they are a kind of "class-determinative" characteristic. They specify the classes of causal characteristics for the things to which they apply, but the effect specified always requires other conditions; sugar isn't merely soluble, it is water soluble, etc. Phrases like "easily fused" contain analytically the reference to other conditions. Let us see what is involved in this class-determination. Suppose I have a white crystalline solid. I can show that it is not sugar if it will not dissolve in water. But if I wish to define it, I must have positive characteristics, and usually mere appearance (white, crystalline, monoclinic, etc.) is insufficient to supply a decisive list of characteristics.10 The extension of the list of characteristics discovered by test ing?i.e., by submitting the substance in question to situations where it causally interacts with the situation?is an effort in the direction of specificity. Such desire for specificity may be arbitrarily satisfied at any point. The sooner it is satisfied, the shorter the list of significantly different characteristics. My tests?i.e., observations of effects under controlled experimentation?may stop at the point where the essential conditions for being a carbohydrate have been met. I may go further and stop with disaccharides; the list of characteristics will be longer, for the smaller class. If I am to differentiate table sugar from maltose, I must make my list of significant differences still longer. The point I make is familiar, save in one possible respect, namely, that causal analysis is a form of class-determination. Causal analysis is a form of class-determi nation. When I test, I bring about certain results. These results open the possibility that one of a known set of agencies is responsible for the result. To minimize the hazard of affirming the consequent, I use other tests on the same substance, thus limiting the range of possible true antecedents, or?what is the same thing?narrowing the range of possible substances which the tested substance may be. Each effect observed in a test used 10 As has been remarked before, a causal theory of perception presents even these characteristics as causally defined; namely, they are the effect of the confrontation of sense and object. No such causal theory is required, however, in the present essay, since the interest of this essay is to establish the conception that causal analysis is always class determinative, rather than that all class-characteristics are causal.</page><page sequence="11">CAUSALITY: CAUSES AS CLASSES 171 specifies a class (e.g., all those substances which melt at 186? C). The overlapping of such classes, i.e., the extension of the list of significantly different predicates, aims al particularity as an ideal. The obtaining of such class-intersects decked out as particulars has two functions: (a) to know, (b) to be able to predict and manipulate. If I confine myself to (a) as an aim, I can on principle never be satisfied, since I can not be sure that my tests are exhaustive, nor even of the proper type. In the analysis of matter the appearance of polymers, isomers, and isotopes is testimony to the various inadequacies that systems of test-and-classify may encounter.11 The progressive satisfaction of (a) is known as "basic research." The activity involved in (b) is called "technol ogy." In broad outline, it will be seen that the relation shown between categoricals and hypotheticals is the generalization of that between assertions employing dispositional terms and those that are contrafactual in form. A categorical proposition attributes a characteristic to an object. A hypothetical proposition asserts a relation as holding between two states of affairs. Frequently the translation of categoricals to hypotheticals confines itself to hypotheticals about the future. As we have seen, such confinement is arbitrary. A contrafactual is a hypothetical whose antecedent identifies a conceivable state of affairs which in fact did not occur. An assertion employing a so-called dispositional predicate is a categorical whose predicate refers to a characteristic that is on tap, so to speak (in traditional terms, is a potentiality), for the life of the entity designated. When I say, "This is a tiger's footprint," I employ the language of predication to assert a causal fact, but the causal fact identified?"mark-made-by-a-tiger"?although classificatory in function, is actual and complete. When I say, "This ball is heavy," I refer to causal potentialities, as well as actualities, of the same type. (The identity of this mark as tiger 11 Norbert Wiener has recently suggested, in this connection, in a paper read before the American Philosophical Association, December, 1957, that the non-classical determination of "fundamental" particles may come to be assigned to their non-fundamental character; that is, subsequent anal ysis may show them to be composite, rather than simple.</page><page sequence="12">172 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE made has future possibilities, too, but of different sorts, like those of casting a mold, etc.) At this point the topic burgeons and a number of worthy questions, which cannot be investigated here, arise. For instance, what sorts of classes are we talking about, since apparently both actual and possible instances can be encompassed in the same grouping? The point to be kept in mind is that when we predicate categorically, we classify overtly; when we analyze causally, we are also engaged in classification, so that the entity in question is related by its status in the causal flow to other entities exhibiting similar status. IV The identification of events. We have thus far dealt with causal analyses involving three distinguishable types of entities: inorganic objects ("this ball"), organic entities ("Von Braun"), and material substances ("sugar"). Inorganic objects generally have monotonous or trivial histories. Organic entities have a history of internally ordered change; their particularity is thus of a different sort from that of inorganic entities. A material substance like sugar has no history at all. No one has ever observed sugar itself so to speak, but only this or that batch of sugar. Any particularity this batch of sugar has far outstrips what chemical analysis can even aim at, let alone achieve. What partic ular batch of sugar I have is indifferent to me as tester or user, so long as it is sugar. The same is true of all the stuffs of both common sense and science: wood, turpentine, air, penicillin. Each term refers to a usable range of aggregate properties; e.g., the "air" may vary in its range of percentages for constituent gases; even the "sugar" may or may not include carbon 14 atoms. Such stuffs may, in addition, be dealt with as particulars, but through spatiotemporal specificity, or by non-essential relational predication: e.g., the air in-this-tube or the pink-stained sugar, etc. It is a characteristic of these pseudo-particulars that, on principle, a change of quantity is non-essential to them. There is another kind of particularity which is also given through causal predication; this is the particularity of the unique event, which is pressed into the same syntax as the other kinds</page><page sequence="13">CAUSALITY: CAUSES AS CLASSES 173 of entities mentioned above. Suppose I wish to identify an explosion. It would probably be possible to construct demands of individuality which would outrun any set of available tests, but in practice this hazard can be avoided. Suppose, now, that somebody ask me, "What kind of an explosion was it?" and I reply, "Loud." I attribute at least potential causal status to the explosion; I claim that the explosion was such as to produce certain sensations. It is in the identification of singular events that the causal theory of perception is most attractive. An event, often being of brief history, will not hold still while its contents are analyzed. Again, if I say, "Big," I am speaking either of loudness or of amount of damage done, and so on. The explosion is an event, but it is given a substantival name and submits to predication of many kinds. Spatio-temporal specificity may be given to explosions as well. Consider the explosion, let us say, in the village hardware store. The designation thus given provides a usable particularity, but nothing very satisfactory in the way of a classification. For this I need the evidence which will give qualitative particularity as well as sheer status in the continuum. If I want to know which kind of explosion is under consideration, I must hitch together noise, damage, etc. Through these effects observed or inferred, the nature of the explosion becomes clearer, i.e. more specific. However, predicates of the sort, "loud," "extremely destruc tive," etc., exhaust only one major kind of causal classification, that discerned on the side of effect. In addition, there is a distinct genus of causal classification which identifies the entity in question from the side of the cause. In this mode of classification would fall such terms as "nuclear," "gunpowder," "ammoniacal," etc. It is in the case of the event that the classificatory function of the causal analysis becomes most marked. More abiding entities have characteristics whose translatability to the language of cause and effect is not so evident, nor so necessary. Persistent entities, "substances," are reservoirs of the outcome of the past, arrests in the causal flow, dammed up as potentiality, upon which the future will draw. The more or less statically conceived qualities which we use to define them provide us with a basis for extrication of the substantial entity from the complexities of time and space. But once we conceive the substantial entity as having an actual status</page><page sequence="14">174 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE in temporal passage, the causal significance of its qualities rises to the surface again. It is at this point that categorical attribution must be dropped, and causal classification undertaken, lest signif icance in the process of nature be ignored by static classification. The description of events also serves to bring into clear focus a fact previously ignored, that causal classification is of two major types. We identify by the intersection of causal antecedents, as well as by concomitance of possible outcomes. Thus sugar is that substance which is the result of a patterned juxtaposing of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. On the other hand it is also that substance which melts at 186? C, is dehydrated by sulphuric acid, is readily soluble in water, etc. There is a great complexity of types of predication which are thus elliptically and uniformly expressed in a highly standardized logical, and even grammatical, form, despite differences of ontological function. In view of this fact, paradoxes in the application of a simple language of descrip tion should not be surprising. V The belief in causal determinism may now be seen to be really nothing but an old friend, the conviction that particulars are simply intersects of uni ver sals. (1) (a) Static analysis of an entity is provided by treating it as the unique common intersect of its qualities, conceived as universals. (b) Particularities of time and place may also be used for identification (not analysis), but these are not regarded as essential. (c) Linguistically, the universals are exhibited as predicates.12 (2) (a) Dynamic analysis of an entity is provided by treating it as the intersect of its causes and its effects, either actual or possible. It is the joint outcome of antecedent causes, it is the reliably same contributor to a number of actual and possible different outcomes, that is the common factor in them, e.g. the 12 Occasionally an unknown predicate may be identified by reference to its object, rather than vice versa, e.g., "Chartreuse is the color of young willow buds."</page><page sequence="15">CAUSALITY: CAUSES AS CLASSES 175 actual pressure in the hand, the possible dent in the lawn, etc. (b) Here too particularities of time and place often stand in a non essential role, if the entity be dealt with as object, precisely because objects are supposed to be indifferent to location. But if the entity be dealt with as event, then particularities of time and place become more clearly essential, (c) Linguistically, the causative status (I mean to include both the status of the entity as cause and its status as effect in using this term) of the entity may be given in qualitative predicate form or a variety of other forms, as we have seen. These forms have been only lightly touched upon.1* Predicates, dynamically conceived, contribute to the specificity of the entity by supplying classes of either causes or effects or both, in which the entity in question has status. Those two modes of analysis?or better yet, modes of specifi cation?are not only analogous, they are in the large convertible to one another, depending on how the entities are discriminated. As a result, the language employed in describing these entities may easily be logically ambiguous. Exposure of causal analysis as a method of arriving at partic ulars by considering them as the intersects of universals puts the use of the principle of causal determinism in its proper light. What we want out of things observed is determinateness, in both senses of the word "determinate." We want fixity of qualitative type?or, if we accept a range of variability for certain qualities, these qualities are then assumed to be non-essential, on principle; hence the common scientific distrust of "secondary" qualities. We also want to pin down the entity as to its causal status. Science demands classification. Science can not tolerate the unique, nor should it be required to. Its task is the organization of transferable and testable knowledge. Insofar as there is uniqueness, any test 13 Consider, for example, the variety of types of characteristics in the following list of predicates usable as values for "Infants are . . .": "young," "pink," "active," "hard to manage when frustrated," "subject to ten per cent mortality." "Young" can be had by analysis of meaning alone; "pink" can be observed in a single case, in a minimal moment of perception; "active" can be observed in a single case, but requires a longer period of time; "hard to manage when frustrated" will require even longer; and "subject to ten per cent mortality" can not be determined by any single case at all. Yet all these types of predication fall into the same standardized syntax.</page><page sequence="16">176 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE is automatically a failure, since a test relies upon similarities. Consequently a great deal can be done to dispel the conviction that there is uniqueness by simply insisting that anything which is knowable must be testable. // testing is the ultimate authority for existence, and tests are ways of referring data to classes of similars, then clearly there can be no existence of the unique. As one philos opher of science says, ". . .in nature there are no unique things."14 It will be seen that we have come by a devious route to Kant's thesis about the causal necessity inherent in observed nature. Kant knew that it was a rule of the observed that it be known through an understanding which not only accepts but requires the presumption of a deterministic order. Kant's insight did include the recognition that experience burgeons beyond the observable, and he showed that it takes the form of moral and teleological cognition as well. Thus scientific knowledge is not allowed to stand for the whole of cognition. Kant destroyed the notion of a transcendent substantial self as an object of knowledge, and he sought to reestablish it in the unity of freedom in a moral agent. The uniqueness which science not only could not obtain but must either deplore or obtain by the non-qualitative specificity of spatio-temporal location is absolutely essential to moral responsibility. Kant dealt with these matters primarily from the side of freedom. He does not seem to have emphasized sufficiently (and Hegel followed him in this error) that the condition of freedom is uniqueness. The free entity can not be entirely dissolved into its status as common member of sets of similars. Kant's results were less than successful as a result. For if motivation through interest rather than out of respect for the moral law robs man of his individuality, by making it the outcome of external accidents of time and place, motivation from rational duty alone fares no better in providing us with a person. It is true that we may have the integrity required for personal identity, but the self constituted through obedience to the rational law is the same for all rational beings; individual identity is thus lost. There seems 14 J. Metallman, Determinizm nauk przyrodniczych (Krakow, 1934), p. 332, cited by Leon Chwistek, The Limits of Science, trans. H. C. Brodie and A. P.

Even speculating for Kant, the best we can hope for individual personality is that it arises from or is the way a universal law is brought to these concrete particular circumstances. But this bringing is a temporal affair and can not itself be accounted for in terms of universals. Kant was right in discerning that scientific understanding rested firmly upon the organization of perceptual data in the causal mode. He was mistaken in supposing that such organiza tion excluded all novelty. What Kant misinterpreted was the novelty of each new moment of experience-, in so doing he remained Newtonian in his conception of time. Newton had tucked all the novelty that scientific description can afford, namely, that of tem poral advance, into the concept of a uniformly moving empty medium. Indeed, if one stops to ask himself what time is, for Newton, in view of the fact that it is not encounterable as pure, it seems to be little more than the uniform sequence of novelty. But the more we look at Newtonian time, the more the uniformity (the repeated cycles of the clock, the seasons, the earth's rotation) comes to the fore and the more the novelty glides away. Newton's time is thus remarkably like that of the Greeks. Kant appreciated the Newtonian conception, although he reproduces that conception as a mode of intuition, (a) fastening his attention on the primacy of substances?"the permanence of the real in time"?and (b) treating causal interaction as a relation primarily between substances15 and (c) regarding qualities as the mere "filling of time,"16 he reproduces the Newtonian illusion faithfully. We no longer have the luxury of employing this illusion. What was long known to introspection is now insisted upon by physical science, namely, that time is an abstraction from the flow of events. There is no concrete but empty medium. Time is derivative. This fact poses a nice problem for the philos 15 A close examination of Kant will show that he actually chafed against this restriction and sometimes breached it; see, e.g., B 230-231, B 236-237 (Smith, pp. 216-217, 220-221). 16 B 184 (Smith, p. 185).</page><page sequence="18">178 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE opher or scientist who would like to deny uniqueness in nature. The uniqueness presents itself directly in the novel moment of new time. Since time is an abstraction from the concrete events we must suppose the novel element in abstract time to have been present in its undistilled form in the events to begin with. Indeed, ironically, the discernment of that natural order which is formulated into scientific law requires not only the similarities that lead to causal classification but the differences which keep a number of instances distinct. The repetition of different instances is considered to contribute substantially to the demonstrative weight that a scientific law has. And there must be an ontological basis for such difference. It will not do to shrug it off as mere "numerical" difference. What does "numerical difference" mean, ontologically, to those entities which bear this relation to one another as they appear, serially ordered? The aim of science is to keep such novelty at the sheer level of temporal novelty. If it arises as qualitative singularity, then disorder ensues and revision is necessary, but the aim is the same: comprehensive classification, either static or dynamic or both. It would be largely whimsical to assert that in discerning an essential novelty in every new event?let us say that event which is the existence of some electron through a given patch of time?one had established the idea that there is freedom in nature. "Freedom" is a manifestly anthropomorphic term. The further you get from human beings, taxonomically, in its employment, the more treacherous the usage becomes. Analogously, it is much less risky to speak of the "love" of a dog for its master than to attribute the same affection to a goldfish. Speaking anthropomorphically, it does not seem that the electron exploits the novelty of temporal advance very much. Its behavior is (within certain limits) vastly predictable and unoriginal. There are human equivalents. Year after year the same lecturer will open the same lecture with the same joke, later complaining that students seem to be pretty much the same. I do wish to insist, however, that no analysis of nature, especially the scientific one, can rid itself of the idea of novelty which is the negative condition for freedom. Ideally, science exhibits this novelty as mere temporal newness, but any notion of prediction insists upon novelty, namely, that the new instance will</page><page sequence="19">CAUSALITY: CAUSES AS CLASSES 179 conform, i.e., meet the requirements of previous classification. It will not do, however, to impose these iron standards on all aspects of events, if only because such standards are proper to observation and observational inference. Observation and its inferences are not the only modes of cognition. Kant knew this to be so; Kierkegaard was more acutely aware of it. Crudely, we may say that an event can be known "from the inside" as well as observed, and this is so even where manifest regularities appear in such events. My habits, for instance, embodied as they are in my consciousness, are quite different as consciously felt from what they are as observed, by myself or any other observer. VI In the light of the foregoing remarks, we can approach the theory of psychic determinism in a new way, stating the use and limits of determinism in psychic analysis. The intuition of personal identity is neither satisfied by, nor subsumable under, categories of observation, either direct or indirect. In static terms this means that the integrity of the individual person is such that when known it can not be under stood as the mere intersect of universals, however much it may be so analyzed?and indeed must be analyzed, if the person in question is to be brought under scientific understanding. In dynamic terms this same integrity is evidenced in the intuition of creative novelty in the act of choice. On the side of observation it is no mere fa?on de parler to say, of a man, that his integrity is such that he will not be swayed by external circumstance but will hold to his principles. The predictability of such a man's action is the evidence of his freedom from what might otherwise be coercive circumstance. But it is not a predictability which can be traced to external origins without loss of meaning. It should take no more than minimal self-knowledge for men to know that they are not mere intersects of universals, without appeal to existentialist Angst. What are we to say then to the marked, but far from reliable, success that psychoanalysis and related arts have had in bringing the personal lives of men into a therapeutic focus by deterministic diagnoses of the self?</page><page sequence="20">180 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE In the first place, it is the extreme case which usually justifies the Freudian argot and practice best. The behavior of the patient is what brings him to the analyst or therapist, on the supposition that there is a discoverable causal pattern which is responsible for his behavior. No voluntarist should then protest because the Freudian proceeds on the presumption of determinism. The presumption behind submission to therapy or analysis is that the patient has lost control; he's no longer in charge. In terms of the foregoing analysis he does not have a certain set of characteristics which are causally analyzable; they have him. Analysis or therapy proposes to rid him of his bondage, not to have him exchange one master for another. Analysis thus is deterministic in its diagnosis, but certainly not so in its therapeutic function. Consider the role of the analyst in his practice. Common prefer ence puts the analyst in a largely passive role, often merely lead ing out, guiding through directed questioning, Socratically. At bottom it must be the patient who does the "seeing," there must be subjective recognition of the origins of his malady, which can be drilled into him neither by pure external verbal pressure nor by the bluntness of experience. The analyst does not withhold inter pretations because of technical ignorance, but on grounds of principle. What happens in therapy or analysis is the provision of data through which the entrapped self can become a free self. The novelty of mere temporal advance is the external evidence of the freshness of each sequent moment. "Where there's life there's hope" is a sentimental formulation of a profound meta physical insight. Its familiarity robs it of its significance. "Life" means the possibility of exploiting the novelty inherent in the future. The more passive the role of the analyst or therapist, the greater the presumption is that the patient himself will exploit the novelty inherent in temporal advance, to breach his fixed relations with his submerged past or his unconscious and frustrated impulses. Psychic diagnosis is clearly deterministic; psychic therapy, insofar as it relies upon an act or acts of knowledge by the patient places its hope in the individual person's capacity to come to a new understanding. Clearly the act of understanding must be in some degree independent of the causal histories of the things understood.</page><page sequence="21">CAUSALITY: CAUSES AS CLASSES 181 Psychic therapy draws upon richer resources for its results than the mere fixed past. It is not likely that when Freud wrote, "The voice of the intellect is soft but persistent,"17 he meant to be speaking of an entity (the intellect) which could be analyzed without loss into its constituent elements of genetic inheritance, cultural pattern, and childhood environment, if for no other reason than that it is the task of the conscious ego to adjust the pressures exerted by these factors to one another. That the conscious ego has this role indeed demands that its operations be disciplined by the claims which these various types of causal influence make upon it and upon one another. But if it genuinely has the task of adjudication among causal factors, then the performance of its task must be in some degree independent of the coercion of such factors. Indeed, according to Freud it is at that point when the "rider" has lost control of the "horse" and is merely swept along by its "locomotive energy"?that is, the point at which the ego can not exert its function of the guidance of the energies of the id, has lost its freedom?that the neurotic anxiety which may presage a total collapse of personality appears.18 I do not wish here to subscribe to, nor to oppose, the Freudian analysis of the self. I merely wish to show that the alleged determinism of the Freudian analysis is a presupposition of a method of diagnosis, but could hardly function as the dominant notion in therapy. That determinism is so characteristic of the Freudian apostleship is largely assignable to an exaggerated respect for the successes of the physical sciences together with a naive translation of methodological presuppositions into metaphysical first principles. Even where Freud uses the metaphor of "servant" for the causally oppressed ego, he still vigorously insists on it as a "separate being."19 Freud's voluntarism is at best cautiously put forward in the implication of analytic metaphor and the end of therapeutic practice. Where it is present it is evidently thought to depend upon knowledge in the sense of recognition or perhaps even 17 See Franz Alexander's article using this quotation as a title in Psycho analytic Review, XXVIII (1941). 18 Sigmund Freud, New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Arialysis, trans.

But where it does appear it allies itself with the great tradition which is at least as old as Socrates and survives still in the philosophy of Whitehead, that freedom is obtained through self-knowledge. The Freudian psychology is a singular achievement. As a discipline it has one foot planted squarely in what I have called the observational sciences, those which explain entities in terms of the causal classes to which they belong. On the other hand, it presumes the possible freedom?i.e., self-determinism?of the entities comprising its subject matter. Indeed the standard procedure in the treatment of any neurosis falls into two polar phases: (a) There is the calculated developing of a new neurosis, the so-called "transference neurosis." Here the patient is intentionally led to transfer repression and attitude to the analyst, who becomes the target for discharge of aggression. "The core of these reactions," says one authority, "is a dependent attitude."20 (b) The second phase, which may in point of practice emerge gradually through analysis, has the opposite end in view, namely, the resolution of the transference, permitting independence to arise. The aim here is the development of an ego "maintaining its integrity even where it recognizes repressed alien tendencies. These become part of the conscious personality which deals with them by control, renunciation, and modification but no longer needs to deny or repress them."21 VII If we proceed further along the lines indicated, some positive doctrine of freedom will necessarily emerge. Such a continuation is beyond the aim of the present essay; yet an indication of how this doctrine takes a positive form must be given, if only to divert the objections of reductionists who would treat the uniqueness of 20 Franz Alexander, Fundamentals of Psychoanalysis (New York, 1948), p. 281. 21 Ibid., p. 298; italics mine. The actual context here is that of alien tendencies as represented through dreams, but the principle obviously holds for any alien tendency; see pp. 281-300</page><page sequence="23">CAUSALITY: CAUSES AS CLASSES 183 the concrete individual as merely the unique combination of factors known by group classification. The argument of this essay may be rephrased and summarized as follows: The archaic and unprovable assumption of absolute determinism has a viability and usefulness which warrant analysis. Its language is exclusively the language of efficient causation. This language has a variety of syntactic forms, but all are efforts to classify the entities to be explained. The results are what I have called "causal classification," such that the entity in question is assumed to be exhaustively explained and understood as the unique common member or intersect of a group of classes, each class being composed of entities defined by what they either engender or result from. Such classes are defined by phrases like "melts at 107? C," "is phototropic," "is deficient in vitamin C," "was reared by a single parent," and so on. Such causal classifications, like more clear-cut, simply qualitative classifications such as "red" (which is also capable of translation to causal status, in theories employing causal accounts of perception), are uni versals. The intersect of these classes, however, is a complex uni versal, not a particular thing at ail. All that is required of any member of a class is that it have a certain characteristic or charac teristics (in the case of a complex universal), not that it turn over its identity to the universal. Indeed it is of the essence that the member and the class be kept distinct, even where there be but one member, since members have a concreteness of time and place which do not attach to the universal. We can then see that "sugar" is of course a spurious particular. Since it is defined purely in qualitative or causal terms, then which particular piece of sugar we refer to is unimportant. But even where we propose to designate a genuinely particular thing like "Von Braun" or "the explosion in the hardware store," we still are confronted with abstraction. In the case of Von Braun, any particular statement about him designates an abstract entity, and even the multiplica tion of abstract characteristics, while it may minimize the risk of misidentification and increase the capacity to explain, carries with it no intrinsic warrant of completing the analysis. Such a warrant can be had only by its being issued in advance. If only (efficient) causal classification explains, then all explanation is in terms of</page><page sequence="24">184 NATHANIEL LAWRENCE efficient cause. The procedure, and its argument, are circular. But suppose someone to hold that only what is explainable (in the previous sense) exists; I may then justly ask for his warrant for this statement. Testability may be the ultimate justification for explainability, but it certainly need not be for encounter ability. I have used the term "explain" to refer to "make intelligible by efficient causal analysis," and have put the term "under standing" aside for other, larger purposes. In the first section I proposed that efficient causal explanation may very well not exhaust the understandability of nature. The terms are chosen advisedly from the point of view of both etymology and usage. To explain is etymologically to flatten out or make simple; to understand is to stand under, to discern the underpinnings. One explains a machine, one understands a work of art. And it is not merely a sentimental tribute to say that a Saint Francis understands birds better than an expert on the mechanics of aerial animal locomotion. It is incorrect to suppose, however, that there is a sharp jump from science to art, and that one is characterized by the wholly objective data which will coerce all who belong to the democracy of the senses into uniform acceptance and understanding, while the other is characterized by the purely subjective authority whose possession is battled over by warring aristocracies of the finer things in life. For example, it is the combination of objective explanation and subjective understanding which makes the practice of psychoanalysis possible. As we move beyond the least level of understanding, that of efficient causal explanation, we encounter the concept of purpose as an explanatory concept. It is purpose which has never been purged from the language of the biological sciences, for very good reasons. It is purpose which shows the subordination of various patterns of efficient causes to one another, which subordination would simply have to be de facto unexplained, if we accepted efficient causation alone as adequate. It is the degree of purpose which distinguishes the living from the non living; i.e., it is purpose which is objectively discoverable in the extent to which the novelty of the new moment has become incorporated into a growing entity or has been allowed to pass by in the simple reiteration characteristic of a merely persisting</page><page sequence="25">CAUSALITY: CAUSES AS CLASSES 185 entity. It is purpose which makes freedom and determinism compatible in men. It is purpose which distinguishes an organized community of men from a geographical accumulation of men. But all of these matters carry us far beyond the aim of the present study, which has been merely to show how the concept of efficient cause works in the advancement of the understanding. It can add indefinitely to explainability, to causal classification, to analysis, and prediction, but it can not substitute itself for the whole of understanding; it can never weave a net with small enough mesh to catch genuine individuals, since it deals in classes, and it cannot as a mere method generate any iron laws which are sufficient for every aspect of existence.
