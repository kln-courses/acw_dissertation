It is scrutinised as an autobiographical artefact, combed for clues as to the inner life of its author. This particular reading of a work of architecture becomes even more involved if the architect in question has a twin brother and if he builds two houses next to one another, one for each of them - exactly as Luis Mansilla did when he built houses for himself and his identical twin Vicente in the southernmost tip of the Iberian peninsula, on the shores of the Strait of Gibraltar. Luis Mansilla (1959-2012) is best known through his association with Emilio Tuñón and the practice they built together in Madrid over a period of more than 20 years, Mansilla y Tuñón Arquitectos. The twin houses are among his less widely known projects, but they nonetheless offer insights into the complex personality and creative universe of a figure whose contribution to Spanish contemporary architecture is now undisputed. Luis always said that he chose to study architecture because his twin brother had chosen to study marine engineering, and archi- tecture was the only other career acceptable to the family. Both twins quickly achieved professional success, Luis as an architect and an academic, and Vicente as a top executive in an international consultancy firm. The proposal to build the twin summer houses actually came from Vicente, who in 2005, after years exploring the Gulf of Cadiz on a series of sailing trips, found an incredible plot near Tarifa, in one of the few stretches of the Spanish coast still untouched by large-scale development. Vicente's exploratory efforts paid off. The setting is worthy of attention, not only on account of its visual impact, but also for its history. Situated at the end of a long beach sheltered by a small promontory, the houses sit comfortably in a landscape of rolling hills, a few yards from the shore, with views across to Africa and the Moroccan coast visible on clear days. For as long as records have existed, this has been a strategic location to control naviga- tion through the Strait of Gibraltar. In the past it was occupied by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Berber tribes. During the Second World War, a small Swiss colony settled in this precise spot: locals maintain it was an undercover German intelligence outpost, set up to monitor traffic through the strait, prepare for an eventual water-borne invasion and act as a con- duit to the spy networks in Morocco. While more recently still, over the last few years, the area has become the major hot spot in the Mediterranean for drug smuggling and people trafficking, exploit- ing its geographical location as gateway to both Europe and Africa. Against this backdrop, in this undulating landscape dotted with small buildings and crowned by a lighthouse, the houses present themselves as two optimistic white cubes, reminiscent of the fasci- nation of early modernism with Mediterranean vernacular archi- tecture. In fact, seen from the beach, the houses are virtually impossible to distinguish from the other surrounding traditional structures in the area. It is only when you get closer that the houses begin to gradually reveal their subtle otherness: first through the playful display of subliminal differences between the pieces, then through the unusual size and positioning of the openings, and finally through their austere but precise materiality. The careful placing of the houses - along a diagonal axis across the plot - uses an existing hill to separate the volumes, providing a certain degree of privacy, while simultaneously articulating a web of meandering paths that links the two houses in a playful interac- tion with the topography. The houses, like twins, are identical to the casual observer but distinctly unique to the insider, and their placing and composition reflect the personalities of their owners. Luis's house, situated at the back of the plot, is carefully placed so as to maximise the protection provided by the contours of the land, reducing the possibility of being overlooked from the street and creating a foreground of hills and vegetation from which to look out over the sea. Vicente's house, on the other hand, has a more exposed setting, closer to the sea, where the experience of the vast- ness of the ocean is unmediated. Its larger programme corresponds to Vicente's bigger family, accommodated in a set of additional platforms and a slightly wider volume. Unlike the Trubek and Wislocki houses by Robert Venturi - another pair of architec- tural twins on a beach - the volumes are not 94 AA files 65</page><page sequence="2">rotateci, but rather face the same direction, as if asserting the unity of purpose of the Mansilla brothers, who despite their very different personalities retained their life-long bond of twinship. The sloping topography means that the base of the houses is exposed at the front, allowing a terrace to be placed across the width of each of the sea-ward facades. This simple gesture simultaneously formalises a plinth for the houses - which are essentially one-story constructions - and creates room for some extra spaces, accessible directly from the gardens. The volumes are simple and strong, with the few openings appearing either as large rectangular voids in the centre of each facade, or as small conical windows positioned alone or in pairs near the corners. This peculiar choice of form and arrangement, together with the subdued mix of visual references - vernacular, naval, high modern - lends the houses their elusive character, which we could describe as naively Spartan in its duality, somewhere between a wartime bunker on the beach and the carica- ture modernist house of the Arpeis in Jacques Tati's Mon Oncle. However, while the character of the houses may be elusive, their materiality is exact. Both are made of in-situ white concrete, with the boards in the formwork arranged vertically and running uninter- rupted through the height of the buildings. The openings are framed in aluminium, conical windows and the large sliding panels are custom cast aluminium pieces, while the surrounding walls and paths are covered in the local sandstone, setting up a connection with the landscape. Going by the published photographs - and the description above - the houses would seem to be at ease in their setting, in the strong light of southern Spain. You could imagine that spending a summer here might be an experience close to Gerald DurrelPs depiction of his childhood holidays on the Greek island of Corfu. This idyllic image is belied - if only subtly - when you register the reduced number and the crooked shapes of the trees standing in the hills around the houses - an indication of the ferocity of the sea and the local easterly wind, known as the Levanter. This particular wind, which blows in discrete and intermittent gusts, is known locally for driving people mad - even the Spanish word for crazy, aventado , derives from the same etymological root. Indeed, it is the proximity to the shore and the sheer strength of the wind that accounts for the dual character of the houses: open to their surroundings when the weather is fine, closed in upon themselves - sliding panels drawn over the terraces - when the rain sets in or the wind turns strong and gusting. In their open configuration the twin houses are devices for intensifying the experience of living in nature. On these occasions - the most frequent mode - the constant comings and goings to and from the beach and between the houses by a host of children and family members presents the best version of life in an extended family. Conversely, the houses in their closed configuration seal themselves from the elements, becoming a pair of camerae obscu- rae , optical devices in which an augmented vision of the world is achieved by recourse to introversion. At these times they operate as solid volumes, with their relationship to the exterior concen- trated in very precise and intense moments. On days like this, the conical windows and the circular perforations in the sliding panels become virtual arrow slits, capturing glimpses of the sea and the wild landscape and projecting them across the house, mirrored in the vertical glass surfaces and the dark polished floors. With this image in mind - and proceeding on the assumption that an architect's house is his self-portrait - we might conclude that this double nature reflects Luis Mansilla's own personality. For Luis him- self also had an elusive character, warm and open but simultaneously absorbed and intense. On the one hand, he was a generous person, genuinely interested in others and in love with life, deeply devoted to his family and always willing to put aside what he conceded were his 'architectural obsessions' to consider someone else's ideas, or sim- ply to enjoy a meal or an evening of conversation with friends. On the other hand, he was truly introverted, in the best sense of the word. He was capable of great concentration and depth in those matters that captured his attention, and it was not uncommon - in the school or in the office - to see him abstract an architectural problem to such degree that it was difficult for those around him to retrace his line of thought. He was interested in the big questions and in them only - in time, in man's position in relation to nature and culture, and in how we see the world. Indeed his writings and his works reflect an evolving obsession with vision, with the components of subjectivity and will involved in the act of seeing. In this light, it does not seem so strange that his house, in its closed state, would become an appa- ratus for seeing, a metaphor of his own obsession with vision. This understanding of the houses as optical devices also has a strong biographical resonance. Luis's grandfather was an optom- etrist and he would often reminisce about growing up surrounded by optical machines, and of the fascination they aroused in him. His grandfather passed away on the same morning that Luis left for Rome to become a fellow in the Spanish Academy, to start the research that would later become his doctoral dissertation. During his stay in Italy Luis visited the sites of pilgrimage of the architects he loved - the Piazza del Campo in Siena, the temple of Paestum, Hadrian's Villa. Sitting in those same places he would mentally re-enact the visits of Asplund, Le Corbusier, Kahn or Siza, moving from an intense and personal analysis of their drawings and the photographs they took onto an interpretation of what it was that they were seeing - in other words, what was distinctive about their vision and how this informed their work. Similarly, in Luis's own resulting dissertation, his research became an oceanic book, in which his view of the world revealed itself only through an expanse of reflections of the images and architectures of others. This obsession with vision is expressed most frequently in his writings, but it also appears consistently in his built work with Emilio Tuñón, in the anthropomorphic 'eyes' that make up the facade of the Léon Auditorium, for example, or in his explanation of how the Museum of Royal Collections is just a framework to make visible that which already exists, or in his reflection on how our vision rebounds in the interior space of Lalin Town Hall. Nevertheless, it is in the Twin Houses that the subject of vision finally becomes the protagonist. In his novel Gemini - a fictional treatise on twinship - Michel Tournier goes to great lengths in suggesting that twins are actu- ally a device for seeing. Having a twin gives an individual the exter- nal point of reference that is necessary to apprehend the world in a way that it not purely subjective - just as two reference points are required to triangulate a position in space, or two eyes to perceive depth. Contemplating the Twin Houses today, two faces on a hill- top on the edge of Europe, staring out over the ocean through their large machinic eyes, we can almost hear them communicate in a secret and vibrant language as they record the life of their inhab- itants and survey the land and the sea. Abstracting the twins into white concrete, the houses become an echo of themselves, while also extending far beyond themselves.
