A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEOLOGY AND AESTHETICS: THE CASE OF JAN FABRE Yves de Maeseneer Abstract Against the background of Hans Urs von Balthasars and Marc C. Taylor's opposite visions of art, the case of the Belgian artist Jan Fahre (1958-) opens inspiring perspectives. Of particular interest are the angels of Fahre, bizarre figures assembled out of thousands of insects, which elicit an interpretation where insectology and a metaphoric of fashion cross traditional (e.g. Aquinas) and modern (Walter Benjamin) angelogical motives—hymnology, cosmology/soteriology, and hermeneutics. As of old, the complex figure of the angel raises aesthetic and theological questions of representation and mediation, of (im)materiality, (im)mutability, and (in)finitude, that allow us to indicate marks towards a contemporary theological aesthetics. I. INTRODUCTION Since religion in our modem period has renounced that word [Beauty], it would not be idle to investigate at least this once what countenance (if we can still speak of a 'countenance') such an undressed religion ['entkleidete Religion] may exhibit. [...] The nineteenth century still held on with passionate frenzy to the fleeing garments of beauty, which are the contours of the ancient world as it dissolves ('Helena embraces Faust, her body vanishes, and only her robe and veil remain in his arms. ... Helena's garments dissolve into clouds, enveloping Faust. He is raised on high and floats away with the clouds' (Faust, II, Act 3)). The world, formerly penetrated by God's light, now becomes an appearance and a dream, Romantic, and soon thereafter nothing but music. But where the cloud disperses, naked matter remains as an indigestible symbol of fear and anguish. Since nothing else remains, and yet something must be embraced, twentieth-century man is urged to this impossible marriage ['unmöglichen Hymen], which finally spoils all man's taste for love.1 Literature &amp; Theology 17/4. © Oxford University Press 2003; all rights reserved.</page><page sequence="2">CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEOLOGY AND AESTHETICS 375 In the first pages of his voluminous Herrlichkeit: Eine theologische Ästhetik (1961—69), the Swiss theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar mourns over the glorious Helena. He prophetically calls for a theological U-tum in order to counter the general cultural climate. His dark diagnosis, however, leaves little space for theologians to enter into a real dialogue with (post)modern contexts. Looking for an alternative, more constructive, attitude towards today's aesthetics, one can hardly find a theology that offers a framework to cope with contemporary art; conversely, aesthetic theory nowadays fears to become explicitly religious. One major exception is Mark C. Taylor's bold attempt to link the fields of art and religion.2 Observing the paradox that the academic reservation towards this interdisciplinary subject contrasts with many contemporary artists' texts, he highlights the striking parallels between the recent history of art and contemporary theological concepts. In this regard, Taylor focuses on the problem of representation, the ever-retuming task to relate the visible and the invisible, the immanent and the transcendent. II. GOD-IMAGES IN CONTEMPORARY ART: MARK C. TAYLOR'S DISFIGURING According to Taylor, the twentieth century is the age of a triple disfiguring. This is a logical reaction against the nineteenth century Kunstreligion, the 'theoesthetical' program that searched for the merging of the beautiful and the divine in an unbroken symbolic whole.3 First, this failure of the endeavour to make the absolute present in figures leads to the iconoclasm of 'abstract art'. Painters like Piet Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich claim that 'if one does not represent things, a place remains for the Divine'.4 Taylor characterises their artistic strategy as follows: 'Abstraction removes every vestige of form and figuration in order to reach the formlessness of the unfigurable or unrepresentable.'5 These artists are looking for a purity beyond the realm of figures: the absolute is elsewhere, radically transcendent. According to Taylor, Karl Barth is a theological pendant of this aesthetics, which is characterised by logocentrism: i.e. the circling around the invisible Word. A second way of breaking the bond between human-made figures and the unfigurable consists in the negation of the unrepresentable. Pop art, for example, clings to the present figures here and now, without referring to any non-representational otherness: there is nothing beyond the image. The 'logo centrism' of Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg celebrates the logo, the figure, the sign, the ornamental; 'there is no reason not to consider the world as one gigantic painting'.6 This aestheticisation of the immanent world finds a theological parallel in death-of-God theologians like T.J.J. Altizer: God is here and now, totally immanent.</page><page sequence="3">376 YVES DE MAESENEER Taylor describes these two ways of disfiguring as dialectical poles. Both of them presuppose the possible location of the Real, be it respectively in the logos or in the logo. Logocentrism and logo centrism both imply a centre. Thirdly, Taylor proposes the artistic strategies of Michelangelo Pistoletto, Michael Heizer and Anselm Kiefer as decentred ways of disfiguring. Beyond simple negation or affirmation they pose 'dénégation'. This is an unfiguring that (impossibly) 'figures' the unfigurable in and through the faults, fissures, cracks and tears of figures. Taylor prefers this aesthetics as a starting-point for his own 'a/theology'. Leaving aside other critical remarks, I would like to question the god-image Taylor puts forward in this third 'postmodem' disfiguring. The scene is one of devastation and desertion. Kiefer's Departure from Egypt, for example, pictures a burnt landscape. Ash clearly evokes transcendence—something transcending humankind—the inhuman. From a theological point of view, one can object that the inhuman does not always equal God.7 Especially so when Kiefer's ash involuntarily reminds us of the infigurable horror of the Holocaust. Not all alterity is 'altarity'. Given this objection to Taylor's aesthetic paradigm, I propose to explore another way of disfiguring. Taylor rightly exposes the illusionary absolutising of the unfigurable and of the figure respectively. Disfiguring should endure the tension between the unfigurable and the figure. However, reservation has to be made when Taylor presents his third way of disfiguring as a kind of dialectical synthesis: to 'figure' the unfigurable through the tears of figures, does not mean the end of art; it is only one more possible solution to organise the terms. Moreover, Taylor's preference for Kiefer's aesthetic strategy tends much more towards abstract art than towards Pop art.8 Balthasar was right: in Kiefer's disappeared—burnt—figures there is nothing left to embrace. I wonder, though, if there is not some other way to save the figures more than Taylor's rather iconoclastic position is able to. In line with Taylor's methodological approach, I will develop a concrete case and, at the same time, engage in a theological inquiry. The case I present here is one from out of my own context: the internationally renowned Belgian multidisciplinary artist Jan Fabre.9 III. JAN FABRE: 'WARRIOR OF BEAUTY' Bom in Antwerp, 1958, Jan Fabre grew up in a secularising context.10 Besides his artistic education at the Royal Academy for Fine Arts, Fabre leamt the trades of scene painter and window-dresser. From 1977 onwards, he has made his appearance as a 'performance artist', a genre in which he explores the boundaries between art and reality. For example, in his work My Body,</page><page sequence="4">CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEOLOGY AND AESTHETICS 377 My Blood, My Landscape (1978) he cut his arm with a razor-blade to let his blood drip onto a sheet of paper. This illustrates how Fabre will introduce the factor of risk into his theatre work. By organising situations of real danger, he wishes to regain corporeality on stage.1 A recurrent theme in his work—in fact all his themes are obsessively recurrent—is insectology, in line with his ancestor, the famous entomologist Jean-Henri Fabre (1823—1915). For instance, Metamorphoses (1979) involves graphic works in which he draws the transformation processes of all kinds of existing and imaginary insects; Fantasie—inseden—sculpturen (1979): collages in which he combines insect corpses with modem utensils. His plastic work is characterised by the bizarre materials he uses. Instead of using paint, Fabre experimented in the eighties with Bic, the popular ballpoint pen. In this prosaic colour he perceives the fascinating tone of what he calls Het uur blauw (The Hour Blue). Like all insectologists, Fabre likes to go for a walk early in the morning, just before sunrise, when the animal world keeps silent. This twilight zone, the period of the insects, just before the birds wake up, bears the realm of fantasy. Everything is possible. The world is waiting for miracles to happen. Inexhaustibly, Fabre starts to colour, to 'bic' a variety of objects, transforming their appearance into the magic blue. A splendid example is Tivoli (1990), an installation in which the whole building is covered by means of bic, the play of the sunlight revealing the complex colour composition of the most banal of colours (see Figure 1). In the nineties, Fabre amazed the world by a series of figures composed out of insect corpses, pieces of medieval armours, wood, angel's hair, and a few other unorthodox materials. We shall focus on this culmination point in his plastic work. In particular, we will concentrate on the set of angels that are Fig, i Jan Fabre, Tivoli, 1990 (photograph by Jan Fabre Copyright Angeles).</page><page sequence="5">378 YVES DE MAESENEER prominently present in the exhibitions of this period.1- The angel is not only a fundamental theme in Fabre's imaginary universe, it raises important theological questions about representation as well. Historically, the 'portray ability' of angels was an important issue in the iconoclastic controversy. Angels challenge the theological imagination to conceptualise the mediation between the invisible God and the visible world. IV. MODERNITY'S OUTCASTS: THE FATE OF ANGELOLOGY For contemporary theologians, Fabre's exhibitions offer a surprising meeting with a supposed extinct species. History shows a marginalisation of angels in modem times.13 The decline of angelology within the realm of theology began during the Reformation when thinkers formulated a strong reservation to this subject that once provoked vertiginous constructions of natural theology. Outside the ecclesiastic controversies, the implosion of the classical cosmological models made the hypothesis of angehe forces ruling the universe superfluous. In a disenchanted modem world, humankind has no longer need of angels. When modem theology finally tried to start a dialogue with the Enlightenment, it was tempting to sacrifice the doctrine of angels in order to save the plausibility of faith. In Bultmann's well-known project of Entmythologisierung, angels function as one of the major targets: The world picture of the New Testament is a mythical world picture. The world is a three-story structure, with earth in the middle, heaven above it, and hell below it. Heaven is the abode of God and of heavenly figures, the angels. The world below is hell, the place of torment. But even the earth is not simply the scene of natural, day-to-day occurrences, of the trivial round and the common task. Rather, it, too, is a theatre for the working of supernatural powers, God and his angels, Satan and his demons [... ] All of this is mythological talk, [... ] We cannot use electric lights and radios and, in the event of illness avail ourselves of modem medical and clinical means and at the same time believe in the spirit and wonder world of the New Testament.14 Angels seemed to have been finally banned from academic theology. Paradoxically, at around the same time, the chased-out figure made a comeback in the last writings of another influential German thinker, Walter Benjamin.13 In 1939, as Stalin and Hitler shook hands, this exiled Jew, in his notorious Theses on the Concept of History, offered a poignant description of Paul Klee's Angelus Novus as the angel of history, powerlessly suspended above the catastrophes going on underneath.16 In the eyes of this fragile angel, Benjamin read a (im)possible caesura in the continuum of History's 'progress'.</page><page sequence="6">CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEOLOGY AND AESTHETICS 379 The intervention of an inhuman figure delivered a discontinuous moment, during which, in a kind of flashback, the hidden suffering of history was remembered. The anachronistic figure of the angel allowed Benjamin to conceive of a temporality that countered the modern ideological idea of Time. Roughly spoken, tradition defines angels as purely spiritual creatures with a threefold vocation: to praise the Lord, to take care of God's creation and humankind's history, and to transport messages between God and humankind—i.e. hymnology, cosmology/soteriology, and hermeneutics.17 Compared with this traditional figure, Benjamin's apocalyptic angelus novus suffers serious dysfunctions. Overwhelmed by the storm of history, creation's guardian cannot help humankind any longer. Even worse, the former messenger hangs speechless above the ruins. The only thing this figure can try to do is interrupt the (dis)course of history by bearing witness. This angel seems reduced to his first function, i.e. hymnology. The angel reminds us of the divine splendour, or more precisely, of the suffering that denies this Utopian light. Benjamin's angelic figure of emergency can be interpreted in this hopeful manner if it is read in the light of Agesilaus Santander, an autobiographical fragment in which he sketches the creation of angeli novi. 'The Kabbalah relates that in every instant God creates an immense number of new angels, all of whom only have the purpose, before they dissolve into naught, of singing the praise of God before his throne for a moment' (13 August 1933).18 (How does one represent this hymnic angel? Paul Klee's Angelus novus shows us an angel petrified with horror—a fitting illustration for the Theses passage but, less so, in my opinion, for the Agesilaus Santander quote. Can art still figure an angel singing? An angel not yet fossilised?) V. AN AMBIGUOUS ASYLUM: ANGELS IN FABRE'S CASE Benjamin's is not an isolated case. Contrary to the theological amnesia, the angehe theme makes a comeback in the academic world as a metaphor to imagine complex questions of representation and mediation.19 (In popular culture, angels never disappeared. Hollywood gratefully draws on these narrative treasures. Ad majorem gloriam Dei, of course.) In the western cultural landscape, angels are familiar images. Nonetheless, Fabre's angels shock.20 When we enter the room and perceive Mur de la montée des anges ((see Figure 2) 1993, Wall of the Ascending Angels),21 we feel a little deceived: where are the wings? The only thing we see is a beautiful emerald evening dress suspended in the air. Attracted by the glamour of this ladylike figure, we discover the pearl tissue is in fact a texture full of beetle corpses.</page><page sequence="7">38o YVES DE MAESENEER Fig. 2 Jan Fahre, Mur de la montée des anges, 1993 (photograph by Attilio Maranzano Copyright Angelos). (If we read the nameplate, we learn that the materials used are jewel beetles and iron wire.) Instead of the cliché birdlike figures, Fabre uses insects. Involuntarily, the theme of insects recalls the demonic creatures of Hieronymus Bosch; Fabre's angel, however, is not formally based on insects—it is modelled after a female silhouette; the beetles only function as materials. Nonetheless, this iconographie switch from the ornithological to the insectological questions the common concept of the angel. The essence of the angelic being consists in its pure spirituality.22 The connection to insects that live near to the earth—although they have wings—endangers their celestial immateriality. More radically, the insect's subordination to the earthly laws of metamorphosis harms the superhuman fixity of the angelic species.23 Immediately after creation, angels are supposed to acquire a quasi-etemal identity. Beetles, on the other hand, transform from larva to pupa and from pupa to adult imago; this is why, for example, the scarab was a symbol of resurrection and eternal return in ancient Egypt. This contrast notwithstand ing, the insects' materiality and mutability can happen to counter too much ornithological imagination. Angels are treated in the doctrine of creation, not trinity: though purely spiritual, angels are not divine. In a way, Fabre's use of insects only stresses their created nature. Just like Benjamin's, Fabre's angels are speechless. The messenger role has become even more impossible: these figures lack the expressive parts of</page><page sequence="8">CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEOLOGY AND AESTHETICS 381 Fig. 3 Jan Fahre, Angelos, 1997 (photograph by Atcilio Maranzano Copyright Angelos). the body. No head, no hands. They possess as much expressive force as a shop-window mannequin. In the same chamber as Mur de la montée des anges,24 the end of the angel's hermeneutic function becomes even clearer in Angelos (1997): a single figure, made out of scarabs, hanging upside down at an iron bar (see Figure 3).23 This dark angel evokes a sinister atmosphere. (Suddenly one becomes aware of the stale air of the thousands of dead insects treated with chemical preservatives. These beetles that form a fairylike dress turn out to be carrion eaters scavenging a dead body.) The messenger is dead. Murdered. The evidence is there: a corpse and a wound—a gaping hole has been cut into the figure's rear. It is true, some believe Angelos to be a slaughtered angel.26 Angelologically spoken, however, this is nonsense. Though angels may not share the divine infinity of the eternal Uncreated One, there can never be a corpse.27 Angels are purely spiritual. They cannot incarnate. If they visit us more humano, they merely take up an appearance. They assume an anthropomorphic figure as men put on a garment. Returning to Fabre: we suggested earlier on that the choice for insects implied a certain materialisation of the previously spiritual angels. Flowever, the cut in Angelos allows us to look inside the figure; the only thing you see is a black hole.28 Beyond the angel's interface there is only emptiness. Fabre's angel appears without incarnation. Even the insects are no longer fleshly. Before Fabre composes his angels, the beetles are cleaned and chemically treated until only their shields remain. Fabre, as it were, recycles</page><page sequence="9">382 YVES DE MAESENEER the hundreds ot beetles' costumes to figure an angel's costume. Angelos is not a corpse, but rather a dress. The supposed meat hook turns out to be a coat hanger. Fabre's insect factory produces haute couture. (Welcome to God's garderobe?) This interpretation can be strengthened by Fabre's work, Openbaring (Etigel Krijger) (1998, Revelation (Angel-Warrior)).29 One side of this strange collage looks like an elegant fountain of angel's hair; the other side is made out of pieces of armour, beetles and leather. This costume collection (beetle shields and leather were originally meant to cover up animals) is presented on a mirror. Angel's hair and the armour—a warrior's but an angel's costume as well (St. Michael for example)—are elementary attributes of the costume play. Fabre's figures refer to archetypes (clichés?) that belong to the medieval and baroque imagination. In a way, this means a return to some pre-modern Utopian state. But Fabre is not prophesying a provincialist regression into a mythical past. He is too influenced by twentieth century arts. His (at first sight) sugar-sweet fairy-tale figures always appear uncanny. The question remains: how7 do we measure Fabre's angelic costumes? Are they just exotica for postmodem tourists? Or, authentic witnesses of an impossible hymn? As mentioned before, Fabre is a skilled window dresser. In order to safeguard a room for Beauty, he pays a lot of attention to the mise-en-scène of his figures. A closer analysis of the exhibition's installation could contribute to an adequate evaluation of Fabre's celestial clothes shop. Fabre shapes a beehive-like labyrinth of narrow passages that connect small rooms. In this quasi-mythical space, fascination catches hold of the visitor. The figures are exhibited in magic boxes. They do not deliver a message; they put a spell on us. But then, all at once you get a claustrophobic desire for the exit. The insectologist Jan Fabre is imprisoning angels like a scientist. The museum turns into a zoo. Although advertising the illusionary promise of a wildlife experience, a zoo cannot deliver 'the real thing'. At best, the zoo's preservation strategy ends up in a reserve, just as Fabre's effort to save Beauty can merely rescue historical costumes, lifelessly hanging in their case or cage (see Figure 4). Fabre's soteriological attempt seems trapped in the zoo paradox. Window dressing, however, is more than simply architecture: it is lighting engineering as well. Here Fabre offers an original perspective. If we were to restate the already mentioned aesthetic strategies30 in terms of light, Taylor's sketch of logocentric abstract art could then be summarised as the search for pure light; logo centrism would be characterised by neon light. To escape from these fruitless strategies, Taylor's own way out appears to privilege the shadow. In this perspective, Walter Benjamin's Angelus Novus exists in stroboscopic light. Fabre, by an inventive use of spotlight, makes the materials (insects) metallically glimmer in a way that reminds one of'the hour blue'. By a strange</page><page sequence="10">CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEOLOGY AND AESTHETICS 383 Fig. 4 Jan Fabre, Exhibition Style (photograph by Attilio Maranzano Copyright Angelos). photosynthetic formula, Fahre seems to melt the hyrnnic flashes of Benjamin's stroboscopic angeli novi into the gentle light of The Hour Blue. This does not imply a mere comeback of logo centrism. Contrary to neon light, Fabre's angels are not themselves the source of light; they only reflect. Moreover, unlike neon figures, the gleaming angels cast a shadow. Avoiding the shadeless logo/centric ways of (dis)figuring, Fabre does not find repose in the (both in their own way) blinding aesthetics of Taylor and Benjamin respectively. The source of light has shifted; Fabre's reflective angels finally restore hymnology. VI. THE ANGEL AS SELF-PORTRAIT: MARKS TOWARDS A THEOLOGICAL AESTHETICS 1 arrived at two tendencies: on the one hand withdrawal, the idea of retreat, and on the other hand the loss of self, the medium that is killing itself. Murder out of respect for reality...31 Angelology is, among other things, phantasmagoric anthropology. And theological fantasy. As a doctrine of phantasms on the limits of the human being, angelology has had serious consequences for spirituality. ~ For a long time, in the definition of'purely spiritual creatures', the adjective outshone the substantive. Angels were seen as the royal guides for theosis. On the contrary, in Fabre's universe, the angelic model is deeply marked by its created state. In this scene, spirituality cannot give in too easily to the human desire for wings. Even angels are far from the uncreated Divine; not only do they cast</page><page sequence="11">3«4 YVES DE MAESENEER a shadow, they are even associated with the materiality and mutability of insects. How this switch from the ornithological to the insectological relates to general symbolic shifts in contemporary imagination needs further research. In our post-icarus times, insectology colours our anthropological root metaphors; for example, Franz Kafka's Die Verwandlung and Vladimir Nabokov's brilliant comment upon it both speak of this. (Fabre's Wall of the Ascending Angels as a twentieth-century Wailing Wall?) One of the riddles of art history is the ubiquity of angels. Perhaps one can read this omnipresent theme, given the functional resemblance between the artist and his/her subject, as Art's autobiography. After all, just like angels, art is told to transfer messages, to praise the (Al)mighty, and even to save the world. If every angel is a self-portrait, what do Fabre's figures tell us about the function of art today? At first glance, his powerless angels permit no soteriological pretensions. Moreover, in a context of global aestheticisation, the self-declared 'warrior of Beauty', Jan Fabre, seems to suffer from grotesque naïveté. Most critical aesthetic theorists (Benjamin, Taylor, Lyotard,... ) are deeply suspicious of the figurative, all the more when the images look gracious. Is Fabre able to create beautiful figures without blending the difference between his own production and the mass media industry producing, seducing, 'beautiful' simulacra? Does not the return of the armours in angelology suggest a perverse aestheticisation of violence? Fabre's answer to the simulacra's false look of eternity is a subtle ars moriendi. Against today's aestheticisation, Fabre reveals the fragility of Beauty by stressing the materiality of art. Chemically treated though they may be, the beetles pulverise irreversibly. The use of these highly decomposable materials in a paradoxical way saves Beauty by remembering its mortality. Deactivated armours serve Fabre's strategy to undermine today's aesthetic regime: the angels are presented as reflective costumes. By hollowing out the figure, Fabre stresses the necessarily docetist tendency of art: just like angels, art only appears to have a body. The logic of art is appearance, not incarnation. Somehow Balthasar's cryptic comment on Faust33 illustrates the illusion that still governs the aesthetic sphere today: the confusion of costume and body, one of the main principles of global aestheticisation. The desire to get rid of the costume is the principle behind the search for substance that haunted modern logocentric art so much, and the disappointment afterwards; the undressing of art only reveals its emptiness. This incamational drift, the modem desire to reconcile life and art, turns out to be an 'impossible hymeneal'. Balthasar is right: there is nothing to embrace. (But who ever did want to embrace a work of art?34) This reading of Fabre's angels implies a radical artistic humility. In aesthetic theory, this withdrawal from an incamational concept to a metaphoric of</page><page sequence="12">CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEOLOGY AND AESTHETICS 385 fashion means a serious loss of theological weight. Freed from the hymeneal gravity, there is space for hymnic light. However inspiring they may be, this is not to baptise Fabre's angels as 'messengers of God's eternal silence' (Dionysius the Areopagite). Speechless they are, hanging in their cases as if under water. The main effect of Fabre's angels is silence. (In Paris, when a conversation is interrupted by a long silence, they say: Un ange passe...)

Taylor's notion of disfiguring is quite in line with Balthasars metaphor of the Entkleidung ('undressing') and 'loss of countenance'. They both indicate the decomposition of the symbolic unity after a 'theoesthetic' period of short-circuiting the parts of the symbol. Taylor however appreciates this new aesthetics as a promising path. Mondrian, quoted in ibid., p. 49. Ibid., p. 85. Rauschenberg, quoted in ibid., p. 85.

Causeries sur le temps (Paris: Galilée, 1988). Taylor's position is of course much more complex than this schematic sketch of one of his books allows to work out. Especially in books like Imagologies and Hiding, he tries to develop an approach that can value the figurative more than Disfiguring's iconoclastic tendency. Cf. M.C. Taylor and E.

The well-known passage runs as follows: 'A Klee painting named "Angelus Novus" shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. This storm 25 irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.' W.

The Greek name reminds us of the etymological significance of the word 'angel'—an indication that the function of messenger is at stake here. For example, Stefan Hertmans is such a 'believer'. Cf. S. Hertmans, The Angel of Metamorphosis in M. Köttering (ed.), Jan Fahre. Engel und Krieger. Strategien und Taktiken (Nordhorn/Ravensburg/Kiel: Städtische Galerie, 1999), pp. 114-20, p. 119. In his erudite commentary, he</page><page sequence="14">CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEOLOGY AND AESTHETICS 387 works out the importance of the insectological approach to understand Fabre's angels—he even quotes the French scientist J.-H. Fahre. Perhaps Hertmans should read the doctor angelicus as well. Cf. e.g. Aquinas, ST, I. q. 51 a. 1-2. Incidentally, this opened figure does not univocally represent death and murder. Another recurrent figure Fahre exhibits is the cocoon. This could suggest Angelos is part of metamorphotic movement. Cf. Köttering (ed.), Jan Fahre. Engel und Krieger. Strategien und Taktiken. 30 r.r Cf. supra. 1 Jan Fabre, interviewed by Jan Hoet in Jan Fabre im Gespräch mit Jan Hoet und Hugo De Greef (Ostfildern: Cantz, 1994), p. 19, my translation. 32 Cf. J. Duhr, 'Anges' in Dictionnaire de Spiritualité. I (Paris: Beauchesne, 1937), pp. 580-625, pp. 621-3. 33 Cf. motto, supra. 34 Of course, Balthasar himself is not advo cating a relapse into Kunstreligion. His whole complaint on the defeat of Beauty is fundamentally based on a christological concept of Beauty.</page></plain_text>
