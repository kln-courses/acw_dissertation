Buck was one of the most renowned, interesting, and controversial figures ever to influence American and Chinese cultural and literary history-and yet she remains one of the least studied, honored, or remembered. In this richly illustrated and meticulously crafted narrative, Conn recounts Bucks life in absorbing detail, tracing the parallel course of American and Chinese history. This "cultural biography" thus offers a dual portrait: of Buck, a figure greater than history cares to remember, and of the era she helped to shape. 56080-2 Hardback $29.95 D. H.

We see the forging of a marriage, the 'un-Englishing' of Lawrence through living abroad, his opposition to the war and the adverse reception of his work.

Benedict Inquiring into the formation of a literary canon during the Restoration and the eigh- teenth century, Barbara Benedict poses the question, "Do anthologies reflect or shape contemporary literary taste?" She finds that there was a cultural dialectic at work: miscel- lanies and anthologies transmitted particular tastes while in turn being influenced by the larger culture they helped to create. Benedict reveals how anthologies of the time often created a consensus of literary and aesthetic values by bridging the tastes of authors, editors, printers, booksellers, and readers. By addressing this neglected genre, Benedict contributes a new perspective on the tension between popular and high cul- ture, between the common reader and the elite.

S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism and Literary Form Anthony Julius "Julius, 39, a Ph.D. in literature .. . as well as a lawyer, turns out to be a relentless prosecutor, a deep-digging scholar and a powerful literary critic."ii -Jack Kroll, Newsweek "...a painstakingly researched and fiercely argued volume... Julius has forced us to rethink some of our most fundamental, received ideas about art, ideas that for years protected Eliot from the sort of scrutiny found in these pages. He has made us reconsider the fences we '"' : . routinely construct between the aesthetic and ideological impulses, the old-fashioned belief that poetry 'discloses essential truths' about the world, our eagerness to forgive artists their moral failings, and, most notably our inclination (or desire) to believe that art redeems. He has written an important-and long overdue-book." Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times "Julius's argument about the poems in Ara Vos Prec seems to me unassailable: they are poetry and they are anti-Semitic, and the two qualities have a place within a very specific tradition of anti-Semitic literary thought. His claim that anti-Semitism casts a shadow on Eliot's writing after 1922 is right as well. And in the end, even his refusal to concede grounds to exculpatory arguments seems just. For indifference is not defense." -Louis Menand, The New York Review 58673-9 Paperback $18.95* The New orker $18.95~~~~~~~~~~~ II F~~8~70el ILA I DI" 0 Wm v Mrl~ I i~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</page><page sequence="16">NEW LITERARY ERITICISM i :':Br':'.i:::':': : :::.:::..:::`.: :i:~..I ;:i:i:': :~:.::.~.:: :: = =::::: :'::::::::':':':~:~ :" : i:' . :(i": :': .i::.;i'i" .I .......... .
