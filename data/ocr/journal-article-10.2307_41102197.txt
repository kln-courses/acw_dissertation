<plain_text><page sequence="1">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 3, 1979 69 Ontario Iroquois Effigy Pipes1 Wm. C. Noble Introduction Effigy art has a long but sporadic history throughout the Ontario Iroquois tradition. Earliest evidence appears with a ceramic fish effigy excavated at the Princess Point type site, guess-dated here by ceramic and settlement seriation to approximately A.D. 500 (Noble 1975). Also, a human effigy is known from the A.D. 1050 DeWaele Glen Meyer hamlet (W. Fox: personal communication). Such sparse occurrences show that the early effigy art is both very rare and apparently restricted to the Glen Meyer branch of the early Ontario Iroquois sequence. Further, it is noted that this early effigy art is associated with amulets and special charms rather than with smoking pipes. In this paper I wish to focus particularly on Ontario Iroquois effigy art as it appears on pipes. Temporally, this means that we are examining a Late Woodland art phenomenon spanning the period from Middleport times (approximately A.D. 1380) to the historic era ending at approximately A.D. 1650. Both David Boyle (1901: 13) and J. Norman Emerson (1954: 45) have previously observed that effigy pipes represent the finest product of Ontario Iroquois lithic and clay artwork. In both media, one solid and the other plastic, individualistic skill is manifest that ranges from the starkly simple to consummate realism. Clay effigies clearly outnumber lithic representations, probably due to the greater pliability of clay . But are the pipe effigies simply art objects or do they hold much wider and deeper symbolic meanings? To answer this question we must first look at the various effigy pipe styles, and then consider possible and probable interpretations of what this art style is and means. Effigy Pipe Styles At the outset, it is apparent that Ontario Iroquois effigy pipes comprise both zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures. This basic division occurs in effigy pipes as early as Middleport times, when the reptilian Salamander and the Donut-Eye human effigies appear (Wintemberg 1948: PI. XVII, Figs. 19, 26). Clearly, human representations outnumber the zoomorphic styles (Table 1), but standardization is more apparent in the latter. Forty-five Ontario Iroquois effigy pipe styles are recognized herein (Table 1), but this is not considered a final count, for new effigies, particularly humans, continue to appear in old collections and new excavations. Over the past 14 years, the researcher has examined between 750-800 Ontario Iroquois effigy pipes. University, museum, and published 1 This is an expanded version of a paper delivered at the Ontario Archaeological Society symposium on Symbolism and Art in Archaeology, October 21 , 1978, Toronto.</page><page sequence="2">70 Ontario Iroquois Effigy Pipes collections have provided useful comparative and distributional information to those pipes excavated from villages whose occupation dates are reasonably known or established. Significant correlations are not noted between effigy styles and manufacturing media except to note, contrary to Kidd (1954: 15), that all pipe varieties are not fashioned in both lithic and clay materials. Only eleven effigy styles have representations in both substances. Taxonomically, I classify the effigy pipes under three main groupings: Zoomorphoric Effigies; Anthropomorphic (Human) Effigies; and Dual (Zoomorphic-Human) Effigies. The latter are extremely rare. Zoomorphic Effigy Pipes Zoomorphic effigies, numbering fourteen in total, are divided into bird, reptile, mammal and rodent classes. Of the four classes, birds clearly constitute the largest category, having no less than six different species represented, including horned owls, passenger pigeons or ducks, ravens or pileated woodpeckers, eagles and, very rarely, loons and pelicans. In contrast, there are three reptilian species (salamanders, snakes, turtles) and only two mammals (bears and canines that are either dogs or wolves), as well as one rodent form. Bird effigies (Figure 1) are readily recognized from their body shapes or other anatomical features such as talons, eyes, beaks, feathers, tails and crests. Some, however, are difficult to identify as to species, particularly the passenger pigeons from ducks, and ravens (or crows) from pileated woodpeckers (or cranes). Some birds, such as owls, occur in two varieties; there are owls with greatly magnified stylized eyes comprising two-thirds of the effigy (Figures lc, d) while others have smaller eyes that come closer to naturalistic portrayal (Figures le, f). Laidlaw (1913: 50) also illustrates an unique black steatite double-headed owl effigy pipe from Innisfil. Loons and "pelican-billed" birds are only known from historic Neutral (Kenyon 1977: 10) and historic Susquehanna (Futer 1959: 143, Fig. 22 E) sites to date. Of the reptiles (Figure 2), turtles are exceptionally rare (Boyle 1896: 60; 1897: 51-53; Laidlaw 1903: 51; 1913: 49), and when they do occur they are invariably on lithic pipes. Snakes and salamanders, however, are very common, and Emerson (1954: 52) correctly noted the difference between the appended coiled snake (Figure 2b) and snakes whose open mouths form the pipe bowl (Figure 2a). The latter are restricted in time to the late prehistoric-early protohistoric (Figure 3), but coiled snake effigies have a longer and more frequent occurrence than what Kidd (1954: 17) once believed. A most unusual Iroquois pipe, exhibiting two intertwined coiled snakes, comes from near Perth in southeastern Ontario (Boyle 1892: 26, Fig. 6). The so-called "lizard pipe" has a long life history from Middleport times (Wintemberg 1948: PI. XVIII, 26) to the historic era (Figure 3). Waugh (1902: 76) first introduced the term "lizard pipe", and other Ontario scholars have followed this naming (Laidlaw 1914: 63; Wintemberg 1948: 76; Emerson 1954; Kidd 1954: 17; Noble 1968: 247). However, salamanders probably provide a more accurate identification since the only true lizard in southern Ontario is the rarely seen five-lined skink (Conant 1975: 122). On the other hand, spotted salamanders are very common and those "lizard" pipe effigies exhibiting punctates almost certainly represent this species.</page><page sequence="3">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 3, 1979 71 Table 1: Effigy pipe styles Pipe Styles (45) Lithic Ceramic A.

Commonly, the creature is portrayed crawling up the pipe bowl back with the tail extending to or along the dorsal pipe stem surface (Figure 2d). Another variety sees the salamander standing on its legs on the bowl front, peering skyward or toward the smoker (Figure 2c). Surprisingly, only two mammals (Figure 2) are represented on Iroquois pipe effigies - bears and wolves (or dogs). Each is relatively popular and persists from the late prehistoric to the historic era. Difficulties can arise in determining whether the canids are wolves, dogs, or possibly foxes, since the ears, snouts and teeth of these animals are often very similar. Rodents are the rarest of depicted zoomorphic pipe effigies. To date, only one poorly-defined lithic beaver pipe is known, discernible by its distinctive tail. It comes from Oro Township, Simcoe County (Laidlaw 1913: 48). Another possible rodent effigy comes from the historic A.D. 1640 St. David's Neutral site. Orr (1915: 91) describes this specimen as being a "porcupine" effigy with three ridges of back protuberances that he interprets as quills. The face, however, looks more like that of a bear and on the whole this effigy strikes me as distinctly non-Iroquoian; it probably belongs more properly to an upper Mississippian origin. Overall, the significant feature of Ontario Iroquois zoomorphic effigy pipes is their amazing standardization across space and over time. The styles for each creature change very little throughout their respective pipe histories. Equally notable is the fact that many seemingly common species are not portrayed zoomorphically. For instance, why are there no fish, no squirrels nor chipmunks, no deer, no raccoons and no hares on the Ontario Iroquois effigy pipes? Human Pipe Effigies Twenty-nine human effigy pipe styles clearly outnumber any other styles, and they are distinguished (Table 1) according to whether their 'heads only' are depicted, or whether 'heads and bodies' are figured. As David Boyle (1901: 13) early recognized, "The human face was a favoured subject . . . " for Iroquois pipes, and the 'heads only' human effigies (19 in total) certainly outnumber any other category of pipe effigy. Of interest too, 'heads only' effigies occur in both single and multiple representations on a given pipe. Characteristically, the human face effigies usually focus on central face features (Figure 4). Eyes, nostrils and mouths particularly stand out with bold emphasis and force. Indeed, this appears to be a deep Iroquoian fixation, for we see this same type of middle-face attention on their medicine masks. Specific embellishments such as mouth tattoos, facial wrinkles and grimacing, both in eye and mouth expressions, serve to heighten the central face attention depicted on human effigy pipes. Not all human face effigies, however, are solely middle-face directed. The pierced ear effigy draws attention to extremities of the face, while other effigies are noted primarily for top of the head features such as coiled hairdos, encircling bands, caps and hats. Other effigies such as the Moon-faced and Ghost styles, while very simply portrayed, manage to evoke disturbingly intent and eerie sensations when looking into their lost-looking faces. With human effigies incorporating post-cranial features as well as heads, it is usually a specific posture or item of body garb that is highlighted (Figure 5). For instance, we see</page><page sequence="8">76 Ontario Iroquois Effigy Pipes Figure 4: Human effigies; a. Blow-Face - Dwyer; b. Pinched Face - N. Huron; c, e. Open Lip - Seed; d.

Most recently an unique torsoed human effigy has been excavated from the early protohistoric Huron Kirche site that shows either horizontal armour slats or an X-ray portrayal of ribs (Carole Nasmith: personal communication). Normally, body details on human effigies are infrequent, as are details of the digital extremities. In contrast to the zoomorphic effigies, very few human effigies exhibit standardization. Six that do include the sitting, beret capped, open-lip, blow-face, pinched-face, and Janus-faced human pipes. This latter pipe type, showing two identical human heads looking in opposite directions, was first defined by Newell Wardle in 1949. Individual variation, however, appears to be the rule for most human effigy styles, and cases of multiple human effigies on the same pipe (Figure 6) are known among the 'heads only' styles. Boyle (1898: 17; 1901: 20) records a triple-headed example from the protohistoric Irwin (Corson) site in Victoria County, while a six-headed Moon-face specimen comes from the historic Donovan Neutral village (in Me Master University collections; Figure 60- Dual Effigies This category represents the unusual occurrence of pipes incorporating both a human and a zoomorphic figure. To date, one human -bear representation is known from the protohistoric Benson site (Emerson 1954: 204), while human-owl combinations constitute another style. Boyle (1906: 16, Fig. 16) illustrates a human-owl effigy from Huronia, and another example of the human-owl form comes from the A.D. 1640 historic Neutral Walker town (Ridley 1961: PI. 5, p; Wright 1976). Interpretations Over the past ninety years, varied interpretations have been offered as to what Ontario Iroquois effigy pipe art is, and what it means. We can trace this development from the early Ontario scholars - David Boy le (1888, 1889a, 1889b, 1891, 1892, 1893, 1896, 1897, 1898, 1901, 1904a, 1904b, 1905, 1906, 1907), George E. Laidlaw (1902, 1903, 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916: 1924), Rowland B.Orr (1911, 1912, 1915), Andrew F. Hunter (1902, 1907), and Wm. J. Wintemberg (1936, 1948) - through to the more modern researchers - Emerson (1954, 1966), Kidd (1954), Ridley (1961), White (1961), Wright (1966), Noble (1968, 1969), Weber (1970), Mathews (1976), Ramsden (1977) and Woolf rey et al (1976). Ultimately too, we can utilize the short eye-witness accounts made by Gabriel Sagard (1939) in 1623 and Pierre Boucher (1896) in 1633. But all of these past attempts have yielded unsatisfactory or incomplete results. Indeed, apart from several suggestive parallels, limited taxonomic refinements, and optimistic kinship and psychological correlations, most effigy pipe interpretations have led to outright frustration. I believe this situation has persisted because all researchers (and some have been very imaginative) have been searching for a single all-inclusive explanation for Ontario Iroquois pipe effigy art. In actual fact, this art is far more complex, requiring multiple explanations that are effigy specific and relative to particular historical contexts.</page><page sequence="12">80 Ontario Iroquois Effigy Pipes In the following section, twelve interpretative approaches are examined, ranging from mere possibilities to more plausible probabilities. The Aesthetic View Subjective as it is, this view demands of the analyser or viewer to forget the cultural context of the pipe effigies and study them as objects of art. This is an "art for art's sake" approach, and one that Gabriel Sagard (1939: 98) first advanced when he stated that the Hurons " . . . make pictures of men, animals, birds, and other things in caricature . . . They make these not for idolatry, but to enjoy looking at them, as an ornament for their calumets and pipes, and to decorate the front of their lodges." Sagard obviously perceived the effigies as simply decorative, ornamental art. He did not understand the Huron's family lineage system, their religion, nor the role of secret medicine societies, and thus could not comprehend whether or not the Hurons attached other meanings to their pipe effigies. He does, however, appreciate on a simple level that the historic Hurons took aesthetic pleasure in looking at their effigy art. Ceremonial Art This is an interpretation raised by Laidlaw (1903: 38) who succinctly sums his position with the words, "I do not think that these pipes were at all ceremonial, or made for a ceremonial purpose, but no doubt they may have been used on ceremonial occasions". He then proceeds to modify his evaluation by reasoning that Ontario Iroquois effigy pipes may have become ceremonial pipes through investiture associated with special medicine or environmental (cultural) situations. Certainly plausible, this view gains some corroboration from Sagard's (1939: 98) differentiating observation that the Huron had both "calumets and pipes". But can we today separate the ceremonial pipes (calumets) from others? Are effigy pipes ceremonial as opposed to non-effigy pipes? I think not, but would agree with Laidlaw that perhaps some pipes, both effigy and non -effigy, achieved special ceremonial status. Individual Art This view is the one that Laidlaw finally settled upon out of frustration at not being able to correlate pipe effigies with totemic creatures. He concluded that effigy pipes were the "results of individual skill and taste", and "that they formed a 'vogue' or fashion about a particular period" (Laidlaw 1903: 38-39). We can concur with him on the point of individual craftmanship - the range in variety of effigy pipe styles and the different degrees of workmanship attest to this - but the matter of fadism in effigy styles is another matter best left until our consideration of historical interpretative views. Objective Portraiture Art Essentially, this view interprets effigy pipe art as an attempt to depict the animals and humans of the day as they were. Boyle (1901: 14, 21) firmly believed that "... the primitive artist</page><page sequence="13">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 3, 1979 81 did not aim at portraiture in the exact sense" and that with human effigies there was "no attempt at portraiture". The diversified range in human effigies appears to corroborate his observation, and it is notable that many Iroquois human effigies lack cheekbone morphology such that they do not even look like native North American Indians. The closest this art comes to precise human portraiture lies in representations of specific hairstyles (e.g., Top-knot), headbands, hats, necklaces, and facial tattoos. Portraiture art does appear to be the rule for many of the zoomorphic effigies. Specific details of talons, curved beaks, crested heads, tufted ears, and necklaced throats allow identification of bird species with some measure of accuracy. On the other hand, snake and turtle effigies defy precise identification. Spotted salamanders are readily identifiable, as are black bears, but differentiating a wolf from a dog effigy is most difficult. In sum, portraiture interpretations can be made for some but not all Ontario Iroquois pipe effigy art. Children' s Art Arguments that the pipe effigies represent children's art can be discounted. This art has sophistication, and Iroquois smoking is historically known to be restricted to adult males (Boucher 1896: 150; Sagard 1939: 197). Still, Boyle's (1901: 14-15, 17, 21) enterprising comparison between kindergarten children's attempts at the human form and those on Ontario Iroquois pipes reveals many parallels. The most notable being "as with the child, the head is everything in primitive art . . . ". Sex and Symbolism Attempts to interpret the Ontario Iroquois pipe effigies as sexual fertility symbols would be pushing the evidence. Sex of the effigies is not depicted, and unless one wishes to read Freudian connotations into the snake effigies, it is safest to dismiss this avenue of interpretation. Sex simply is not a major concern, motif, or theme of Iroquois effigy art. Historical Views Historical interpretations of art usually attempt to authenticate authorship, establish stylistic trends over time and space, and make cultural comparisons. Research along these lines for Ontario Iroquois effigy pipes has been rather limited, but it remains an essential pursuit if we are to properly understand the context and life histories of pipe effigies. Presently some broad outlines can be sketched concerning temporal placement and development of effigy pipe styles in the late Ontario Iroquois sequence. Noble (1968: 312) has noted that the Donut-Eye human and Salamander effigy pipes are the first to appear in the late prehistoric (approximately A.D. 1380) period; this may be part of a new pipe complex introduced into southern Ontario from New York (Lenig 1965: 56). From this sparse beginning, effigy pipes floresce in numbers and styles shortly after approximately A.D. 1450. Indeed, the late prehistoric and the early protohistoric (Noble 1968; 1971), the latter which I would now date between A.D. 1500-1540 for south central Ontario, represents the heyday for human effigies. Laidlaw (1903: 37) also noted this phenomenon, and attempted to</page><page sequence="14">82 Ontario Iroquois Effigy Pipes correlate the frequent appearance of effigies with " . . .the advent of the white man in the St. Lawrence basin . . . ". Recent radiocarbon dates for the late prehistoric Seed site (A.D. 1460), the transitional late prehistoric-early protohistoric Sopher site (A.D. 1505), and the early protohistoric Cleveland (A.D. 1540) and Benson (A.D. 1540) (P. Ramsden: personal communication) sites indicate that such a correlation is not far wrong. The florescence of effigy pipes, particularly the human forms, begins shortly before the appearance of European items on the upper St. Lawrence River (i.e., about A.D. 1500). Equally correlative, the pipe effigies floresce when Iroquoian confederacies were being formed (e.g., the League), when population movements and realignments took place (e.g., shifts from southern to northern Huronia), and when significant territorial changes occurred (e.g. , the relinquishing of the London area in favour of the territory around Hamilton by the Neutrals). Events of this magnitude could well have inspired material as well as oral traditions to preserve specific memories, and some historic events may well have been registered in effigy pipe depictions. Early attempts at effigy pipe seriation were simplistic. Laidlaw (1903: 39) attempted to use Beauchamp's (1898) idea that effigies facing away from the smoker were more recent than those that looked stemwards (Boyle 1904a: 31, footnote). In current studies, this idea has proven to have little if any historical value. Certainly a problematic aspect of any seriation is quantifying the degree of fadism that may exist. Fadism appears in the Ontario Iroquois human effigies, as suspected by Laidlaw (1903: 38), but he could not resolve the problem because he lacked a controlled chronology. Now, however, it is apparent that a forty-year gap separates the early protohistoric pipe florescence from the late protohistoric (approximately 1580-1600) when new effigies appear alongside some but not all of the earlier styles (see Figure 3). Attempting more precisely to seriate pipe fashions, Emerson (1954: 58) once thought that the wolf and duck effigy pipes appeared later than snake, owl or bear effigies. Actually, the early zoomorphic effigies of the late prehistoric include the wolf, bear, owl and salamander, while pigeons (ducks), ravens and other birds occur as historic innovations. Much remains to be accomplished in accurately tracing effigy pipe fads as opposed to the enduring styles. As to authorship, there now is no doubt that late Woodland Ontario Iroquois were the artisans. This topic, however, was once hotly contested for it sparked Boyle (1904a) to debate McGuire's (1899; 1904) assertion that Europeans were responsible for introducing the pipe styles to the Iroquois. Recently, Woolfrey et al (1976) have introduced a different tack on tkWho made the pipes?" They basically reiterate Pierre Boucher's (1896; 150) 1633 account that Huron men made their own pipes. Noble (1969: 24) had previously established this fact, and currently believes that while Iroquois men carved or fashioned their own pipes, women probably fired the clay examples. Certainly unresolved is how many pipes a smoker may have owned and used. Such details are simply unknown from the ethnohistorical records. Today, the real questions concerning authorship lie in determining on a cross-cultural basis, how many of the pipe effigies are Huron as opposed to Neutral, St. Lawrence, or League Iroquois styles? Much remains to be researched on this question, but already it is apparent that the Hurons fashioned many more representations than the Neutrals, particularly ceramic human effigies. On the other hand, limestone effigy pipes occur most frequently in Neutralia and are probably directly attributable to the historic Neutrals.</page><page sequence="15">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 3, 1979 83 Totemic Representations While early attempted, this line of interpretation led to frustrating results. Boyle (1902: 117), Hunter (1902: 64; 1907: 12), and Laidlaw (1903: 39) each failed to link pipe effigies with tribal or clan groupings. The limited range of zoomorphic effigies, the fact that many depicted creatures were not totemic eponyms, and wide geographic distribution of effigy styles inhibited their attempts at making significant correlations between effigy pipes and tribal/clan totems. In re-examining this approach, Noble (1968: 294) met with more success by investigating totemic representations on the lower kinship level of family lineages. Totemism is a characteristic of lineages (Murdock 1949: 49), and there is ample evidence for it among the historic Huron and other Iroquoians. Sagard (1939: 98) noted that eponyms appeared on both pipes and longhouses, and while he does not expressly state that they were identical, correlation of excavated pipe effigies with the documented longhouse caricatures and body tattoos (Sagard 1939: 145; du PerÃ³n, JR 1959: Vol. 15, 181), indicates that some were indeed similar. Therefore, the probability that some effigies represent lineage totems appears to be very real . Noble (1968: 297) has suggested that if future excavators were to plot effigy pipes in relation to house structures and over entire villages, the pipes might reveal the locations of lineages represented within these settlement units. Unfortunately, such correlations have not proven too successful, for pipes simply are not found evenly distributed over a given site. Today, I modify my former belief that all effigies probably represented lineage totems. It seems more probable that only some of the effigies, particularly the zoomorphic forms, may actually represent totemic lineage eponyms. Other effigies appear to have quite different relationships. Cosmologie al Art At least one pipe effigy style presents the possibility of being linked with an Iroquoian cosmological element. This is the Wolf effigy. Formerly in Iroquoian cosmology the white wolf represented the sun (Boyle 1902: 1 17, 123), but more recently this role has been ascribed to the white dog. Wolf effigy pipes may well be associated with, and symbolic of the sun. Shamanistic Art The view that pipe effigies might be best interpreted as magico-religious representations is relatively recent. Weber (1970) and Turnbaugh (1977: 5) have raised this possibility, while Mathews (1976) has delved the most thoroughly into the matter. I concur with Mathew's belief that representations of shamanistic activities can be argued for at least two human effigies, namely the Blow Face and Pinched-Face styles. This latter form normally wears a conical hat, an accoutrement common to shamans in many cultures. Both effigy styles accentuate the mouth as if to indicate ritualistic blowing or sucking, and a shamanistic interpretation certainly is plausible for these specific pipe forms. On the other hand, such an interpretation cannot be universally applied to all the pipe effigy forms.</page><page sequence="16">84 Ontario Iroquois Effigy Pipes Art Linked with Medicine Masks and Dances Another line of interpretation attempts to correlate pipe effigy art with Iroquoian masking associated with medicine ceremonies and ritual dances. Wintemberg (1936: 75) once suggested a parallel between wooden masks and Iroquois pipe effigies, and indeed there are some positive indicators. For instance, the mouth emphasis seen on such masks as 'Old Broken Nose' is especially reminiscent of the Open Lip human pipe effigies. Also, the "Good Message" corn husk mask exhibits a blow-face mouth markedly similar to the Blow-Face effigy. Specific ceremonies such as the Bear Dance song, the Snake song, Witch songs, War Dance songs and the Medicine songs also offer highly suggestive affiliations with pipe effigies. In short, certain of the human pipe effigies could certainly have a direct association and parallel with masks and masking ceremonies; in some cases, the effigies themselves may be portrayals of masked human figures (Boyle 1906: 18). Mnemonic Associations One of the most interesting interpretative approaches to understanding Iroquois effigy pipes lies in associations with mnemonic pictographs and effigies carved on condolence canes. In particular, the pictographs and explanations recorded by Fenton (1950) for the Andrew Spragg condolence cane prove highly significant, for this cane represents a device for remembering the Roll Call of the Chiefs. This Roll Call preserves the names, titles, and certain physical descriptions of fifty original founders of the Iroquois League (Fenton 1950: 10, 26, 54, 59-67), and Fenton's list is in essential agreement with that of Horatio Hale (1883: 146-165) and Lewis Henry Morgan (1851: 64-65). A tenacious historical oral tradition is thus indicated. Of the fifty founders depicted on the Andrew Spragg cane, nine individuals appear to be identifiable with specific Ontario Iroquois human effigy pipes. This correlation carries the added suggestion and high probability that some Huron (and St. Lawrence Iroquois?) shaman-leaders were actively instrumental in the formation of the League. Unfortunately, such inter-tribal details have been forgotten today by the Five founding Nations, and indeed it is difficult to discern which of the fifty remembered founders were contemporaries. It is known, however, that the early historic Onondagas had rather close ties with the Huron, including neutrality pacts, and they and the Oneidas occupied the region bounding south-eastern Lake Ontario, a locale contiguous with the Trent River Huron. It is, therefore, no real surprise that seven of the nine correlative mnemonic pictographs are grouped with Onondaga-Oneida personalities. One pictograph each is affiliated with the Mohawk and Seneca. Specifically, the following founding chiefs and their pictographs provide the most convincing associations with pipe effigies. (a) Orenregowah, a Mohawk sachem whose name translates as the "Great White Eagle" (Fenton 1950: 59), carries an eagle pictograph. This symbol may well be duplicated on eagle effigy pipes. (b) Odatshedeh, "He who bears a quiver by a forehead strap", is an Oneida chief (Fenton 1950: 60). His pictograph conceivably bears a relationship to those human effigy pipes having headstraps and backpacks.</page><page sequence="17">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 3, 1979 85 (c) Adyadonneatha, another Oneida sachem, is depicted as a faceless human with prominent body including flexed elbows and knees (Fenton 1950: 61). A possible association exists with some of the "head and body" sitting pipe effigies. (d) Adahoneayenh, "Two ears hanging", traditionally affiliated with the Oneida, appears to have definite correlations with the Huron pierced-ear human effigy pipes. Fenton (1950: 61) records that when this founding chief was first seen, he had enormous ears slit for the insertion of feathers. (e) Ronwatshadonhonh, "He is covered with mist", also represents a sachem attributed to the Oneida. The pictograph and mnemonic interpretation indicates a human head veiled with vapour (Fenton 1950: 61). Perhaps this case has an association with pierced-mouth, "smoker" effigy pipes? (f) Adodarhonh or "Ensnarled" was the most powerful and often feared Onondaga shaman whose head was said to be covered with snakes rather than hair (Fenton 1950: 62; Hale 1883: 20). His pictograph indicates snakes that may well have a symbolic parallel in snake effigy pipes. (g) Dehatkadons, "He looks both ways" represents an important Onondaga "firekeeper". His pictograph indicates identical human heads facing in opposite directions, and Fenton (1950: 62) cogently offered the interpretation that this chief was the intended person represented on Janus-faced pipes. I find this association most convincing, and from the decided concentration of Janus-faced pipes in Huronia am led to believe that Dehatkadons may have been originally a Huron shaman. (h) Ononwireh, "He conceals, covers it", was the name of another important Onondaga chief whose special function was "Keeper of the Wampums" (Fenton 1950: 62-63). This chief was associated with the Great Wolf, and this was his eponymous animal. Could not wolf effigy pipes be memorials to this man? (i) Shakenjohwaneh or "He of the large forehead" is the last of the League founders considered here to have any association with Ontario Iroquois pipe effigies. He is affiliated with the Seneca and the pictograph exhibits a full face with prominent forehead (Fenton 1950: 67), that presents a striking parallel to the Huron High Forehead human effigy pipes. This line of interpretation, involving the mnemonic pictographs used during the condolence ceremony Roll Call of Chiefs, provides highly specific associations between certain pipe effigies and remembered notable founders of the Iroquois League. That some of the chiefs may have been Hurons or Huron-influenced seems inescapable. It is also significant that Iroquois oral histories fix the formation of the Confederacy at circa A.D. 1460 (Morgan 1871: 151; Hale 1883: 179), before the appearance of the whiteman. This is archaeologically acceptable, for the orally remembered period falls approximately two generations before the beginning of the protohistoric (A.D. 1500), or precisely during the period when human effigy pipes floresce in Ontario. In particular, the Janus-faced, Pierced Ear, and High Forehead human pipes make their first appearance about A.D. 1460, just prior to the early protohistoric period. Split Personalities As Fenton (1950: 64) accurately observed, "The concept of the split personality is not uncommon in Iroquois culture", and this theme offers a plausible approach for interpreting</page><page sequence="18">86 Ontario Iroquois Effigy Pipes and understanding the presence of Dual Effigy pipes among the Ontario Iroquois. Specifically, the human-bear and human-owl effigy pipes conceivably embody attempts to combine and symbolise opposed human-animal powers, powers that may have been perceived as both natural and supernatural. Conclusions In conclusion, it is apparent that considerable research was directed towards the study of Ontario Iroquois effigy pipes around the turn of the century. David Boyle and George Laidlaw, in particular, laid the foundations for future studies, but their efforts were not substantially resumed until Norman Emerson's (1954; 1966) studies. In this paper, forty-five effigy pipe styles have been identified, indicating that the effigy art is basically zoomorphic and anthropomorphic in nature. But while this art is reasonably straightforward to describe, its underlying meanings are far more difficult and complex to determine. Twelve interpretative approaches have been postulated, and they clearly indicate that no single all-inclusive explanation can be offered for interpreting the meaning of Iroquois pipe effigies. Rather, multiple interpretations that are effigy specific have to be sought. The following observations help to demonstrate this: 1 . The effigy art is individualistic in the sense that it is the product of individual skill and taste. 2. Standardization of pipe effigies is more noticeable among the zoomorphic forms than the human ones. 3. Some pipes probably acquired special ceremonial status, but whether "calumets" were solely effigy pipes remains unknown. 4. There are parallels between the human effigies and children's art; both focus on the face and omit details of digital extremities . 5. Some, but not all, pipe effigies represent portrait art, but not in an exact sense. Certain zoomorphic effigies are clearly identifiable as to species, and specific human effigies have close similarities to League founders. 6. Some pipe effigies continue from Middleport times to the historic era, while others appear to be short-lived fads. Human effigies floresce about A.D. 1460, and those with berets or top hats may be European influenced (Boyle 1897). 7. None of the pipe effigies can be correlated with tribal or clan eponyms, but some do appear to be linked with lineage totems. 8. The Wolf (or dog) effigy may be a cosmological representation for the sun. It may also be a symbol to the memory of Ononwireh, Onondaga "Keeper of the Wampums". 9. The Pinched Face and Blow Face human effigies probably represent shamans, and as such could be associated with magico-religious functions. 10. The Open Lip and Blow Face human effigies have physical parallels to specific medicine masks. 1 1 . Mnemonic pictographs carved on condolence canes provide rather startling associa- tions between nine League founders and various Ontario Iroquois human pipe effigies. In particular, Janus-faced, Pierced Ear and High Forehead effigy pipes appear to have direct correlations to specific sachems traditionally remembered as founders of the League about A.D. 1460.</page><page sequence="19">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 3, 1979 87 12. The possibility also exists that Dual effigy pipes represent split personality traits. Human-animal and human-bird dichotomies occur on Ontario Iroquois pipes in what may be caricatures symbolising natural and supernatural powers. Finally, it can be noted, as Turnbaugh (1977) has, that ritual smoking and aboriginal pipes constituted one of the last native practices to be replaced by Euro-Canadian substitutes.

Abstract This paper presents a basic taxonomic classification for Ontario Iroquois effigy pipes. Forty-five zoom orphie, anthropomorphic, and dual styles (types) are enumerated. In addition, twelve lines of interpretation provide varying explanations of what this art work means. It is concluded that multiple explanations are required, and that they are effigy specific. RÃ©sumÃ© Une classification taxonomique de base des pipes Ã  effigie des Iroquois d'Ontario est prÃ©sentÃ©e dans cet article. Au total, 45 types zoomorphiques , anthropomorphiques ou prÃ©sentant les 2 styles sont Ã©numÃ©rÃ©s. En outre, 12 modes d'interprÃ©tation nous procurent des explications variables de la signification de cet art et on doit conclure que des explications multiples sont nÃ©cessaires pour en rendre compte et que ces explications sont spÃ©cifiques Ã  cet art.</page></plain_text>
