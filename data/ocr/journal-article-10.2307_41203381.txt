Jennifer Ann Savino ад JL~'. JL~'. two-headed cat! A two-headed cat!" Sophia jumped up and down, calling out while waving her hand in the air. Her classmates, who recently witnessed the dissection of a cat in science class, erupted in laughter, picturing the abnormality and wondering if the teacher would also have cut into the second head. Mike, who had written bicephalocat on the board, seemed slightly disgruntled that Sophia had discovered the answer so quickly; he begrudg- ingly nodded. Since Sophia was correct, she became the next student to pres- ent her creation: primloqufrogoo. Instead of the dissectors of the bicephalocat or the primloqufrogoo, these stu- dents (whose names are pseudonyms) are the inventors. In taking apart and reuniting words, they deepen knowledge of vocabulary via an active creation of it. They become wordsmiths, acquiring vocabulary knowledge, skills, and strategies that will carry them through the challenging texts they encounter. Shakespeare, who may seem far from the twisted sense of humor of a 12-year-old, coined such words as monumental multitudinous, and premeditated (McQuain &amp; Malless, 1998; Simpson et al., 2010) and serves as a model of en- gagement with words. Rich vocabulary instruction allows such active experi- ences with words and is monumental in that it is based on enduring principles, multitudinous in that it features activities countless both in number and type, and premeditated in that the progression of activities is carefully planned. This article demonstrates how vocabulary empowers; it offers exciting ways to support best practices in vocabulary instruction through rich vocabu- lary activities. Your students should find these as fascinating as the dissection of a cat and as intriguing as Shakespeare's words. Vocabulary Empowers "Words embody power, words embrace action, and words enable us to speak, read, and write with clarity, confidence, and charm" (Duin &amp; Graves, 1987, p. 312). Vocabulary, therefore, is integral to communication and expres- sion, reading comprehension, and thought (Nilsen &amp; Nilsen, 2003). It is the</page><page sequence="2">"cornerstone of literacy" (Beck &amp; McKeown, 1985, p. 12) and is inherently linked to achievement both in and out of the classroom (Davis, 1944; Graves, 2006; Thorndike, 1917). There is a consistent positive correlation be- tween a thorough knowledge of vocabulary and reading comprehension (Baumann &amp; Kame'enui, 2004; Blachowicz, Fisher, Ogle, &amp; Watts-Taffe, 2006; Davis, 1944, 1968; Graves, 2007; Hattie, 2009; Kame'enui, Camine, &amp; Freschi, 1982; McKeown, Beck, Omanson, &amp; Pople, 1985; Stahl &amp; Nagy, 2006; Sternberg, 1987; Thorndike, 1917). As vocabulary develops, so does reading comprehension; as read- ing comprehension develops, so do students' abilities to infer meaning from context (Rupley, Logan, &amp; Nichols, 1998/1999). Through the grades, students should grow as thinkers and communicators, but thinking and com- munication is limited by vocabulary (Nunan, 2005); development of complex vocabulary parallels devel- opment of complex thought, which parallels devel- opment of complex manners of expression. Indeed, "thought development is determined by language, and instruction precedes development" (Vygotsky, 1986). Development of thinking skills through appropriate vocabulary instruction can make students scrupulous word analysts, wordsmiths, and language aficionados. Students won't just know definitions, they will know words thoroughly through words' past lives, present uses, and future potential. Rich Vocabulary Instruction Rich vocabulary instruction via immersion in a word-rich environment is necessary for students to understand, internalize, and use words effectively. Vocabulary in such an environment should be pre- sented as "a system of thinking, a way of building, analyzing, spelling, pronouncing, using, and choos- ing words" (Thompson, 2003, p. 1). In a word-rich environment, students are exposed to words, develop word consciousness, and play with words. Word Exposure Students need to be exposed to words to begin the process of internalizing them. Effective vocabulary instruction should include repeated exposure to words, frequent use of and practice with words, and incorporation of those words into the language of the classroom (Beck, McKeown, &amp; McCaslin, 1983; Blachowicz et al., 2006; Graves, 2007; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [NICHD], 2000; Yopp, 2007). The frequency with which students encounter words increases recall, retention, and comprehension (McKeown et al., 1985); often, it takes 10 to 40 en- counters to achieve the highest level of understand- ing of a new word (McKeown et al., 1985; Scott &amp; Nagy, 2004). Students are also exposed to words through reading. The amount of reading students do has a positive correlation with the size of their vocabularies (Anderson, 1996; Anderson &amp; Nagy, 1992; Cunningham &amp; Stanovich, 1998; Graves, 2007; Stahl, 1998). Besides encouraging reading and demonstrating a personal passion for words, teachers should pursue instructional practices that focus on concept attain- ment and contextual guidance. Such approaches help provide exposure and engender the interest that stu- dents need to begin internalizing multitudes of words. Concept Attainment. Conceptual instruction leads students to think about relationships among word meanings (Blachowicz et al., 2006; NICHD, 2000; Yopp, 2007). It involves students making connec- tions among the words and their prior knowledge, other words, and concepts (Blachowicz &amp; Fisher, 1996; Blachowicz &amp; Lee, 1991; Gipe, 1978; Harris &amp; Sipay, 1975; Nilsen &amp; Nilsen, 2003; Rupley, Logan, &amp; Nichols, 1998/1999). Concepts are labeled by words; however, words are more than just labels (Vacca &amp; Vacca, 2008). (Incidentally, the first use of label as a verb has been attributed to Shakespeare [McQuain &amp; Malless, 1998].) When students label - when they are able to accurately and consistently assign individual words to appropriate categories - they demonstrate concept attainment. Understanding and being able to articu- late relationships and connections among concepts is often an arduous process; students must go through four levels of concept attainment before they achieve conceptual knowledge (Bruner, 1966; Joyce, Weil, &amp; Calhoun, 2003): о evi J= и со со in &gt;. о CD cu э &lt; об с CD О СО _аз о -о &lt; о аз О -з 446</page><page sequence="3">1. The perceptual level involves exposure to defi- nitional knowledge in which a literal label is attached to a word. Students' understanding of the word is extremely general, concrete, and reliant upon short-term memory. 2. The contextual level is where most content learning occurs. Vygotsky (1986) referred to words as generalizations in and of themselves, and although this level is often characterized by overgeneralization, here students begin to distinguish among similarities and differences of concepts. Students learn to associate many attributes and functions of concepts, but this is neither always accurate nor consistent. 3. The schematic level involves downward clas- sification and is associated with long-term memory in which students permanently own the conceptual ideas and information; they now can accurately and consistently assign all attributes that represent the concept. 4. The categorization level involves upward clas- sification and allows students to see many similarities among related concepts as well as possess a significantly abstract understanding of the concept; the student then creates networks of connections among concepts. Activities that foster concept attainment include discussion, brainstorming, comparing and contrast- ing, free writing, and construction of feature analysis charts as well as activities that tap prior knowledge, help students form connections, and help students cat- egorize new words. For instance, to introduce bereaved, ecstatic, humili- ated, and irate, the teacher could begin by asking stu- dents what they already know about these words. A free-write in a vocabulary journal or a simple class discussion would suffice to ascertain students' prior knowledge. After sharing and discussing, students should understand that these words describe feel- ings. Students can then brainstorm words they al- ready know relating to how people feel; collectively, this could generate hundreds of words to share. After more sharing and discussion, students can begin to categorize the brainstormed words using a graphic or- ganizer or semantic map. Then, the teacher reintro- duces the new vocabulary, and o , , Students o , need , to students place the words into the categories they just created; this know what to do allows students to relate the new when they encounter to the known and make connec- an unfamiliar tions among words. Students share word during their and defend their categorizations reading; they need in a classwide discussion; stu- ,,ж , л1 to be shown how to dents learn to negotiate (Much ,,ж , Ado л1 About Nothing's Claudio first ut- monitor their own ters the verb negotiate [McQuain &amp; comprehension - how Malless, 1998]) categorizations to to develop vocabulary reach a consensus. metacognition. After this process has been re- peated numerous times to allow for concept building, the teacher introduces semantic feature analysis to enable students to analyze different elements of related concepts (Vacca &amp; Vacca, 2008). On a semantic feature analysis chart, a category is chosen (e.g., emotions), words related to that category are placed across the top of the chart (bereaved, ecstatic, humiliated, and irate), and properties shared by some of those words are listed on the left side (e.g., adjective, positive, negative). Students then mark the appropri- ate boxes with a "Y" (yes), an "N" (no), or a "?" (un- sure) to indicate whether that property is associated with the particular word. The teacher may begin by creating the semantic feature analysis charts, but once students are comfortable, they should create their own charts to challenge classmates. Students could complete many of these activi- ties in a vocabulary journal - a written record of their journey to concept attainment. If the preceding ac- tivities are conducted prior to reading, students could use their graphic organizers, lists, categorizations, and semantic feature analysis charts to make predictions about the text. Contextual Guidance. Students need to know what to do when they encounter an unfamiliar word during their reading; they need to be shown how to moni- tor their own comprehension - how to develop vo- cabulary metacognition. This provides the confidence students need to tackle troublesome words, especially when reading technical text in academic subjects. с о о =3 со с &gt;. - _Q аз о о &gt; о _с и CD О а.

Nonetheless, in- creasing the amount of reading students do as well as increasing the efficacy of students' metacognitive processes through contextual guidance will increase students' vocabularies (Kuhn &amp; Stahl, 1998). Contextual guidance involves instruction and modeling through which students learn that the words surrounding an unknown word might contain "hints" that will lead to the word's meaning. The teacher models by eliciting responses regarding the "hunches" of what words might mean. After identi- fying the correct hunches, the teacher asks students to pick apart the clues they used. This process is modeled and practiced until the students can use it successfully on their own. Contextual guidance also can involve students constructing "possible sentences" (Stahl &amp; Kapinus, 1991) - sentences students predict they will encounter in the reading they are about to undertake. In this ac- tivity, the teacher chooses six to eight words from the text that will be difficult for students; these words can be key concepts from the reading or words related to those key concepts. The teacher also chooses four to six words that will be familiar. The teacher writes all the words on the board and invites students who know the words to share their knowledge; if needed, the teacher provides short definitions. Students then use two or more of these words to create sentences they think will appear in the upcoming reading, and these are shared without judgment. Using two or more words requires students to look for logical relationships among the words (Stahl &amp; Kapinus, 1991). The class completes the reading, the teacher returns attention to the sentences on the board, and they discuss the accuracy of the sen- tences based upon the reading. Inaccurate sentences are altered according to class suggestions. Stahl and Kapinus (1991) found that the use of possible sentences as a prereading activity was effec- tive in improving students' vocabulary and text recall. This activity allows students to create and analyze contexts within which words are embedded; thus, it is excellent for providing contextual guidance. Word Consciousness "With something like 25,000 words to learn by the time they complete eighth grade and with most of that learning taking place incidentally as students are reading and listening, an active interest in words is crucial" (Graves, 2007, p. 15) - that is, students must be attuned to the language that is all around them. Word consciousness should be integral to vo- cabulary instruction (Baumann &amp; Kame'enui, 2004; Anderson &amp; Nagy, 1992; Beck, McKeown, &amp; Kucan, 2002; Blachowicz &amp; Fisher, 2004; Graves, 2006, 2007; Graves &amp; Watts-Taffe, 2002; Nagy, 2005; Scott &amp; Nagy, 2004) and should include discussions with stu- dents regarding the power of words, the role of words in their surroundings, and the pleasures that can be associated with words (Cowan &amp; Albers, 2007). Students become aware of diction and learn to question their own word choice and the word choice of other authors by asking, "Could a better word be used here?" or "Why did this author use this particu- lar word?" In a state of word consciousness, students recognize "the communicative power of words... the differences between spoken and written language, and... the particular importance of word choice in written language" (Graves, 2007, p. 15). When planning vocabulary instruction, we need to remember that effective communication (includ- ing speaking, listening, writing, and reading) is the goal. In their world of texting, instant messaging, and Facebook, students know that "words do not exist in isolation. They belong to speakers in a culture, and о CM .c о CO to in о CO Ш "D &lt; o3 с Ш о со cu о -а &lt; о со с =3 о -з 448</page><page sequence="5">their meanings change along with the changes in the culture" (Nilsen &amp; Nilsen, 2003). Students must be made aware of such transformations, and they must understand that they are not passive observers but in- stigators in this evolution of language; their culture will shape the future of the language. Once students are aware of this role, they will become more active participants in the language game. Word Play Language is a game - an ever-evolving, multidimen- sional game of chance with manipulative pieces and rules that we choose to follow or ignore. Students need to learn to see language in this light; they need opportu- nities to play with, manipulate, and even create words. Just as they do with children's games, our students learn the rules and how to make the rules work for them. They learn to manipulate language and become expert players who win at effective communication. Recent vocabulary instruction literature con- tends that word play helps develop rich vocabularies and metacognitive practices (Cowan &amp; Albers, 2007; Fisher &amp; Blachowicz, 2007; Moen, 2007). Make vo- cabulary acquisition joyful for your students (and for yourself) by creating opportunities for play outside of recess, for something to look forward to, for learning that doesn't seem like learning, and for advancement in the language game. Rich Vocabulary Activities With the following lively, meaningful activities, stu- dents actively engage in vocabulary development and enrichment - they will be too busy being actors, art- ists, and wordsmiths to realize they are learning! Word Log It's not a new concept, but it's a vital one. Call it ajour- nai, a diary, an agenda, a chronicle, a notebook, or a record; I call it a log so I can put a picture of a log (from a tree) on the cover to kick-start the word play that I hope my students will embrace. As the name suggests, students will keep a log of words - words encountered that interest, confuse, annoy, or inspire them. They are encouraged to bring this log to all class- es, not just mine, in case of sudden inspiration. From other classes, I have seen words such as amoeba, coup d'état, entropy, immiscible, ligature, noisome, osmosis, pusil- lanimous, reciprocity, sebaceous, tyrant, vigilante, and even xiphihumeralis. I set a day of the week for sharing en- tries. Students are encouraged to add others' shared words to their own logs. Vocabulary Theater Many of my sixth-grade students enjoy acting out the vocabulary words in a charades-like game I call Vocabulary Theater. Students can work alone, in pairs, or even in groups, using facial expressions or gestures to represent a single word or putting together a silent skit that represents one word or a group of words. An alternative is to suggest a group of words that are similar but have varying degrees of intensity - for example, upset, irritated, mad, incensed, enraged, irate, livid. Have students work in groups in which each member acts out one of the words. The class must guess which student is representing which emotion. This activity promotes teamwork and should engen- der discussions of the varying subtleties of each word, leading to understandings of shades of meaning. Too Hot to Hoot Word play includes working both forward and back- ward with words. Palindromes offer a great way to develop word consciousness (Boardman et al., 2008). Write a full-sentence palindrome on the board (May a moody baby doom a yam?) and ask students what they notice about the sentence. Students might analyze the sentence in ways that they are already used to in your classroom - structurally or metaphorically, for exam- ple. If they get stuck, ask them to analyze the sentence letter by letter. A last resort involves writing the sen- tence backward: "?may a mood ybab ydoom a yaM." To create and present their own palindromes, students start by working with words that spell some- thing correctly both backward and forward: god and dog, mug and gum, now and won, may and yam, mood and doom, rat(s) and (s)tar, and live and evil, for ex- ample. Students might then work with paired words or phrases (a Toyota, on no, as selßess a) and move on to short sentences (Now I won. Pa's a sap. I, man, am I.). Another activity involves students reading the lyrics and listening to the song "Bob" by "Weird с о о =3 CO с &gt;- СО =J -О CD О О &gt; о о со о о. о. &lt; "О cu со ■а CU E cu Cl- eo =3 о с "О со с cu E с о &lt; со •=) о &lt; с cu со cu о. cu со -С со cu JC I- 449</page><page sequence="6">Al" Yankovic, in which each line is a palindrome. Afterward, have students confirm that every line is a palindrome by reading each line backward. Picture It! This activity asks students to select pictures to represent vocabulary words and identify vocabulary words that pictures represent. Begin by showing students wordless pictures that you have selected to represent particu- lar words either literally or figuratively (depending on their analytical skills). Google Images (images.google. com) is a wonderful resource for finding pictures that can be displayed using an interactive whiteboard or LCD projector. Students can also find or identify pic- tures that typify antonyms of vocabulary words. You can integrate technology further by having students create PowerPoint presentations with slides containing images for their classmates, who guess which vocabulary word is represented by which pic- ture. Options in PowerPoint include creating quiz- zes with correct and incorrect answer slides and Jeopardy! -like boards. Creating a PowerPoint quiz can be a culminating activity for groups. Activities With Word Parts When students learn about the parts of words - not only prefixes and suffixes, but also roots and mor- phemes, or stems (Thompson, 2003) - they develop morphological awareness and the ability to pick apart larger words and discover meanings on their own (Anglin, 1993; Fisher &amp; Blachowicz, 2007; Graves, 2007). According to Wood and Blanton (2009), "Word wimps can become word wizards through the magic of morphology!" (p. 326). Vacca and Vacca (2008) recommend instructional activities using both compound words and words that contain recognizable parts, such as stems and affixes. Keep in mind that research varies in its support of teaching Latin and Greek stems. Although it is a sound practice to give students tools to pick apart word meanings, not all words with particular stems in them will possess those particular meanings, and students can become confused or even discouraged regarding the utility of stem study (Wood &amp; Blanton, 2009). It is important to discuss the evolution of language with students and impart that although many words retain their original meanings based on those Latin and Greek stems, other words might have meanings that differ from their Latin and Greek predecessors. Give students examples of both. For lists of words and word parts, including ex- amples deriving from Latin and Greek stems, refer to Thompson (2003) and Wood and Blanton (2009). Stems-From-a-Hat. In this activity, the teacher writes word parts from existing words on slips of paper (each part could be a stem or an affix) and places them in a hat. Each student pulls one word part from the hat and then finds other students with other parts to form an existing word. Words are made up of two or three parts; students do not know how many others they have to combine with, so there is much moving around and calling out as they try to fit themselves into this puzzle of words. Because some parts fit in multiple words, students must work with all others to figure out the words chosen. This activity not only builds vocabulary and morphemic awareness but it also encourages teamwork. Table 1 contains lists of word parts that can be split up and written on the paper slips. These words were used with a sixth-grade class. When all students have combined words or when the class has reached an impasse, students share the words they have created. If any students have not been able to match up, their parts are analyzed, and as a class, we see where they might fit. I always share my original list of words with the students, and we discuss words they created that vary from that list. Through this activity, students will see how words are formed of parts, and they will see how many individual parts can be part of different words. Word Inventions. This activity stems from the Stems- From-a-Hat activity. Here students become word- smiths, combining the stems on their own to create new words - like the bicephalocat mentioned in the opening of this article. Students may add existing whole words to their stem combinations. They must assign a part of speech and definition to their word and refer to the dictionary to ensure that their cre- ation does not already exist. Students present their newly created words to the class, and based upon their knowledge of the stem meanings, the class must о CM .c о CO CD Ю &gt;» О CD O) I •o &lt; с 03 cj со - о -о &lt; о го с =3 о - 5 450</page><page sequence="7">Table 1 Examples of Word Parts and Created Words for Stem-From-a-Hat Parti Part 2 Part3 Word Meaning ortho graph(y) orthography a spelling system anthropo morph(ic) anthropomorphic human characteristics for nonhumans con flu en(ce) confluence a flowing together ornith (o)logy ornithology study of birds demo cracy democracy government by the people in spec tion inspection critical examination equi voc(al) equivocal equal voice to both sides inter medi(ary) intermediary a go-between, a medium circum locu (ti)ous circumlocutious said in an indirect way sacro sanct sacrosanct very holy and sacred syn(o) nym ous synonymous having the same meaning ex cise excise to remove, cut out micro thermo meter microthermometer very small temperature gauge arthro scop(y) arthroscopy inspection of joint con stell (a)tion constellation group of stars ver(i) simil(i) tude verisimilitude appearance of being true lachry mal lachrymal weeping, related to tears ante cede antecede to come before somn ambul ist somnambulist sleepwalker ego centric egocentric centered on the self Note. Letters in parentheses indicate that they are not part of the original stem or affix but are letters that are part of the created word. Initially, you may want to include any parenthetical letters on the appropriate stem strips, explaining to students that these additional letters were also used in the creation of the word. As students become more advanced, you may omit the parenthetical letters from the strips, challenging students to determine what letters were added to the stem(s) to create each word. determine what the new word means; the word cre- ator guides the activity, letting classmates know when they have succeeded in defining the word. With each new group of stems that I present to the students, we hold a Word Inventions session, either as a preview, held before we examine and discuss the stems, or a summative session, held afterward. We dis- cuss dictionary definitions and how students can make their own definitions sound authentic. For bicephalocat, for example, students might be tempted to state the definition simply as the meanings of the stems: "two, head, cat." Dictionary definitions, however, are more specific. In this instance, the student created her defi- nition as "A cat born with two heads" (to differentiate it from a cat that suddenly developed a second head). You can also conduct this activity in reverse by asking students to create and present a definition for which their classmates must create a new word. With Word Inventions, students begin to under- stand that new words are created to fill voids of ex- pression in which an adequate word does not exist. You may wish to discuss Shakespeare with your stu- dents and share some of the words whose inventions have been attributed to him (see Table 2 for a brief list of examples). In this way, students begin to ap- preciate Shakespeare, the subtle differences that exist among words, and the need for a rich vocabulary to adequately express themselves. Table 3 lists some ex- amples of words and definitions that my students have created through this activity. From the Bard to the Primloqufrogoo Rich vocabulary instruction allows monumental, multitudinous, and premeditated experiences with words.
