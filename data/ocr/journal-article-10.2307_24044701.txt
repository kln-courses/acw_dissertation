Associated with "cruelty 87</page><page sequence="5">and barbarity" and, in the higher states, with "selfishness and sensuality" (PZ..III.126), the social effects of polytheism are invariably negative. In his historical model, Coleridge situates the Hebrews at a mid-point between polar opposites: the Greek Ideal and the Roman Reality. The coincidence of lines extending from these poles represents the historical synthesis of Christen dom. The Greeks "acting upon the stores" that the mind finds "within itself," are incapable of enduing creations with religious insight {LoL.2.48). In Coleridgean terms, they seem to apply the Understanding to the objects of the senses. The poetry, fine arts, mathematics, and philosophy of the Helle nistic world, in the context of imperial Rome, develop within the parameters of War, Empire, and Law; as a result, Roman adds nothing to the Greek achievement. In this universal his tory, the Roman Empire is a preparatory phase in which Christianity, after overcoming paganism, establishes itself. Beyond a fourth point of "Indifference" occurs the fifth pe riod, containing the modern age: the Ideal (Greek philoso phy and culture) and the Real (Roman austerity and civilization) combining with the indefinite and imaginative superstitions of the Gothic Nation (Z.o.LI.48). This periodical scheme recurs in the 1818 Friend and in the "Treatise on Method" (1818). According to Genesis (4.21 22, 6.4-5, 6.9), an original or innocent age finds man, obedi ent to God's Will, aware of his Creator, of the need for spiri tual worship, and of the "assured hope of a future and spiritual existence" (SWäfF.669). This intuition of God pre cludes the need to study the heavens, to create a civilization, and to cultivate the soil. Choosing a way of life contrary to pastoral innocence, man is then driven to shape convictions and to deduce knowledge from "without," by exclusive obser vation of phenomena "as the only realities." Dissatisfied with an unmediated knowledge of God and of creation, the willful become "civilizers" or self-gratifying urbanités (SW&amp;F.669). The material achievements of civilization, in this view, bring moral decline. Turning his back to God, man follows innate drives, the great masters of the agreeable and sensual inevita bly indulging in "cruelty and rapacity." Both before and after the Flood, "the vicious of mankind" recede from "true culti vation," and detour to civilization (SW&amp;F.669; P.I.494&amp;n.). The religious impulse, however, is not entirely extinguished. Believing only in what can be perceived or proven a posteriori, they become "idolaters of the Heavens" and of "the material elements." Out of "the idols of the mind," they then create material representations of their gods and bow down "to stocks and stones, as to the unformed and incorporeal Divin ity" (SW6TT.670). As Divine Providence enlightens the Greek world, man gradually awakens to the pursuit of "an idealized Method," but one intended for the exercise of a Method founded entirely on mental initiatives, either "intellectual or imaginative." This great awakening, however, does not pro mote scientific learning, "the investigation of physical laws and phaenomena," an endeavor that is inherently counter productive to revelation (5W6fF.670). A turn comes in the religious history of the West when Homer and the mythologi cal bards (Orpheus, Linus, Musaeus) begin to "spiritualise Polytheism" indirecdy, perhaps through contact with the in spired writings of the Hebrews or through divine revelation. This cross-fertilization prevents the natural and barbarizing effects of polytheism. It is also felt in Greek literature and Fine Arts, as the mysteries are gradually transformed into epic poetry and history; the mythological hymns, into tragedy and philosophy. The Egyptian style of statuary is suffused with Promethean animation; and the sculptural ideal affects painting, architecture, and the Fine Arts (SW&amp;F.670). The theories of religious development, to which Hume and Coleridge subscribe, are fundamentally different from one another. For Hume, polytheism antedates monotheism, is intellectually inferior to it, but, with respect to toleration, is generally more humane. The emergence of monotheism, ac cording to Hume's system, does not evidence God's direct intervention into human history; rather, it is one phase in a greater cycle of development. Nor is polytheism an extinct form; theoretically, it can recur within, and even supersede, monotheism. Coleridge's standpoint on the history of Western reli gion, and on polytheism's place in this continuum, is defined exclusively in Scriptural terms. Unlike Hume, he believes the original religion is monotheism—an unmediated revelation of God to man. Man's confounding of God with nature, initi ating an apostasy, leaves him more a sensuous than spiritual creature; henceforth, in keeping with the Genesis account, man fabricates gods in his own image to mediate between himself, now isolated and faithless, and the phenomenal world which he cannot understand. Divine revelation, in the Judeo-Christian heritage, arrests this apostasy for an elect. Whereas, for Hume, polytheism is an organic phase, neces sary to the evolution of later forms with which it reacts, for Coleridge, polytheism, in the scope of salvation history, is an evocative deviation. Despite the fundamental differences in their perspec tives on polytheism, both Hume and Coleridge understand that religion does not develop in vacuo and that sociological factors are involved in its development. Thus, both realize that the progress of civilization affects religion intimately. Their intellectual approaches to the subject of polytheism are also similar. Each approaches the subject systematically, in terms of religious knowledge; in terms of the origin, form, and function of polytheism; and in terms of historical processes.
