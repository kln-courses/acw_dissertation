<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHY DANCE? TOWARDS A THEORY OF RELIGION AS PRACTICE AND PERFORMANCE Kimerer L. LaMothe This article engages the dancing and writing of the American modern dance pio neer, Isadora Duncan (1877-1927), and the phenomenology of religion and dance authored by the Dutch phenomenologist, theologian, and historian of religion, Gerardus van der Leeuw (1890-1950), in order to argue that "dance" is a valuable resource for developing theories and methods in the study of religion that move beyond belief centered, text-driven approaches. By setting the work of Duncan and van der Leeuw in the context of the emergence of the field of religious studies, this article not only offers conceptual tools for appreciating dance as a medium of religious experience and expression, it also plots a trajectory for the development of a theory of religion as practice and performance. Such a theory will benefit scholars eager to attend more closely to the role of bodily being in the life of "religion." The question with which I began my study of modern Christian the ology and philosophy of religion seemed simple enough: Why don't Christians dance? I soon realized it was more complicated than I had imagined. Christians throughout history have danced and are dancing their faith,1 it is just that theologians and philosophers interested in the orizing "religion" have tended not to notice. Nor can this ignorance be blamed on individual scholars per se. The field of religious studies took root in largely Christian contexts (those of nineteenth century Europe) where most Christians considered "dance" a form of enter tainment or titillating diversion. Even the romantic ballet was consid ered by intellectual and religious elites to be a derivative art—a realm of primitive and feminine values, the playground of the bourgeoisie.2 Not surprisingly, the (largely Christian) philosophies of "religion" that 1 The Bible is replete with references to dance, and there is evidence that at any point in Christian history, someone somewhere danced his or her faith. There was a marked decrease in Christian dance after the Reformation and Counter reformation. For contrasting views on the extent to which dance has been present in Christian contexts, see Backman (1952) and the more conservative Davies (1984). For bibliography, see Adams and Apostolos-Cappadona (1990).

LAMOTHE emerged in this time and the methods of religious studies that followed tended to assume that dancing adds nothing to the meaning of "reli gion." Scholars have tended to perceive "dance"—loosely defined as rhythmic bodily movement that may be spontaneous or rehearsed, for mal or improvised—as offering an indirect contribution to religion at best. Dance appears as a symbolic enactment of what is more clearly represented in verbal forms, or as a physical means for entering altered states of consciousness whose meanings are, again, better represented in verbal forms. The implications of these assumptions for religious studies are far-ranging, for nearly all traditions, global and local, hold some form of dancing as integral to religious life.3 My question evolved: what kinds of theories and methods would reli gious studies scholars produce if they acknowledged that dancing can be an effective element of "religion"? This article offers one response by considering the work of two indi viduals who asked similar questions. Early in the twentieth century, as the field of Religionswissenschaft was taking shape, the American pioneer of modern dance, Isadora Duncan (1877-1927) and the Dutch phe nomenologist, theologian, and historian of religion, Gerardus van der Leeuw (1890-1950), both criticized modern western Christian attitudes towards dance as harmful to our understanding and practice of religion, and van der Leeuw did so, at least in part, due to Duncan's influence. Born in California, Duncan blazed across concert stages of Europe, winning acclaim in 1902 as a solo dancer.4 From then until her death in 1927, she frequented with intellectuals, artists, and cultural elites, sharing her vision for dance as "a religion, an expression of life" (AD 142). Van der Leeuw got the message. He may have seen Duncan per form on one of her tours through the Netherlands or during his stay in Berlin.5 Regardless, in several places he acknowledges his debt. He 3 Dance traditions appear, for example, in Islam (the Mevlevi Order of Sufis), South Asian Hinduism (Bharata Natyam, Orissi, Kathak), Tibetan Buddhism, Jewish Hassidism, and nearly all indigenous religions. For an explanation and critique of why dance has been largely ignored by western thinkers attempting to theorize religion, see Kimerer L. LaMothe, Between Dancing and Writing: The Practice of Religious Studies (2004). See also, Judith Lynne Hanna, To Dance is Human (1987). See Dils &amp; Albright (2001) for a recent anthology of dance and culture. 4 For biographical information on Duncan, I rely primarily on Daly (1995), Blair (1986), and Kendall (1979) as well as on Duncan's own writings, represented in her autobiography, My Life (1928b, hereafter "ML"); and her essays collected in The Art of the Dance (1928a, hereafter "AD") and Isadora Speaks (1981, hereafter "IS"). 5 See Lowenthal (1980).

As he writes: "I shall mention with honor the name of the person who for the first time revealed to us the majesty of the dance, and that is Isadora Duncan."6 Evidence of her influence pervades not only his historical studies, but his phenomenological method as well. Perhaps it is no coincidence that, in addition to sharing a passion for religion and dance, these two individuals have suffered similar fates in their respective disciplines. They are celebrated for opening the way to new developments and faulted for failing to leave behind a system atic theory and method of their own. Of Duncan Agnes de Mille exclaims: "Isadora cleared away the rubbish. She was a gigantic broom. There has never been such a theater cleaning!" (Terry 1963: 159-60). For Jacques Waardenburg van der Leeuw was a "singular bird, beyond the path of established scholarship."7 Their respective claims about reli gion and dance are considered idiosyncratic and subjective, tied to per sonality and fueled by charisma.8 It is this common fate, I suggest, that signals the importance of Duncan and van der Leeuw's work for the question posed above con cerning theory and method in religious studies. As explained below, the perspective from which their claims have appeared as overly subjective is a perspective that elevates beliefs, texts, and/or verbal forms as the interpretive key to practices, rituals, or material manifestations of reli gion. While this perspective on religious studies remains dominant across (with students from her Berlin school), and 1921.

LAMOTHE the field, it is one whose merits are increasingly under fire. In a num ber of recent reflections on the field, scholars critique belief-centered, text-based approaches as evidence of a lingering Protestant paradigm beyond which the field must move.9 In this regard Duncan and van der Leeuw were prescient. Duncan directly challenges this privilege when she proclaims that her dancing is a catalyst for renewing "religion." Van der Leeuw does so as well in theorizing dance as religion, and in developing a dance-inspired phe nomenological method. By tracing Duncan's influence through van der Leeuw's phenomenology of religion, then, this article not only offers conceptual tools for appreciating dance as a medium of religious expe rience and expression, it also demonstrates how religious studies scholars can find in the study of dance valuable resources for developing theo ries of religion as practice and performance that offer an alternative to text-based approaches.10 In support of this project, Part I provides a brief account of what I call forces of forgetting that characterize the perspective from which dance appears as marginal and Duncan and van der Leeuw appear as his torical curiosities to the project of theorizing religion." Part II evalu ates attempts to resist these forces in recent accounts of ritual as practice and as performance. Part III elucidates Duncan's claim that dance is "a religion, an expression of life" and traces its echoes through van der Leeuw's phenomenology of religion and dance. Part IV builds Part III 9 The reflections I have in mind include works such as: Kippenberg (2002), Wasserstrom (1999), Wiebe (1999), Jantzen (1995), Asad (1993), as well as works by Penner (1989), Preus (1987), and Sharpe (1986). This impulse and critique are also evident in essays from Critical Terms for Religious Studies, edited by Mark C. Taylor (1998). See in particular the essays on "Belief" (by Donald Lopez), "Experience" (by Robert Sharf), "Performance" (by Catherine Bell), and "Religion, Religions, Religious" (by Jonathan Z. Smith), as well as the "Introduction" by Taylor. See also, Sullivan (1990). 10 One implication of the following analysis is that moving beyond a belief-cen tered, text-driven approach to religious studies will involve embracing "theology" as an integral if contested resource in the study of religion. See LaMothe (2004), Part I, for further discussion. 11 To assert that dance has not appeared as a resource for theoretical thinking in religious studies does not discount the growing body of ethnographic, anthro pological, and theoretical literature on dance in world cultures. Rather, I suggest that theorists of dance and theorists of religion have much to offer one another in the common project of attempting to name that which eludes verbal representa tion. Among dance theorists, Sondra Fraleigh (1987) begins such a conversation. Roger Garaudy (1972) is the only scholar I know who argues that American mod ern dancers, Duncan included, made dances that offered philosophical reflections on the nature and value of religion.</page><page sequence="5">WHY DANCE? 105 in identifying parallels between Duncan's methods of dance education and van der Leeuw's phenomenological method. Part V distills the implications of this analysis for a theory of religion (and not just ritual) as practice and performance. 1. Forces of Forgetting The perspectives from which dance, Duncan, and van der Leeuw appear as marginal to religious studies are governed by three forces of forget ting that have dominated western theoretical thinking about religion since the end of the eighteenth century: rationalization, inwardization, and textualization.1'2 These forces not only helped birth the category of "reli gion" as an object of scientific study, they also represent the principle strategies upon which scholars continue to rely as they process religious phenomena, regardless of whether they consider themselves "humanists" or "social scientists," empathetic interpreters or objective fact-finders.13 In revisiting formative moments of each, I call attention to the role played by the practice of writing in its authorizing and note the impli cations for acknowledging dance as religion. Rationalization. The force I am describing as rationalization finds a crystallizing moment in Immanuel Kant's seminal essay, "What is Enlightenment?" (1784). Here Kant honors reason or rational thinking as the key to human "enlightenment," described by him as a person's emergence from "self-incurred immaturity" (54). While Kant defines "reason" as operating over and against "experience" (i.e., sensory infor mation), he denies that this privilege is simply given. Human beings must exercise and develop their reason in order to be able to reflect upon the contents and enabling conditions of their experience and acquire knowledge. Moreover, as Kant insists, "matters of religion [are] the focal point of enlightenment. . . because religious immaturity is the most pernicious and dishonourable variety of all" (59). Religious phe nomena, in this sense, are the meat on which people cut their rational teeth. Exercising his own reason, Kant concludes that the essence of religion lies in "rational belief"—that is, a belief (which cannot rationally 12 In identifying these three, I do not claim that they exhaust the field of influences. There are others implied by one or more of these, such as individualization. However, I consider these three dominant for reasons that follow. 13 For discussions on the emergence of "religion" as a category of study in the modern west, see W.C. Smith, The Meaning and End of Religion (1991); and Jonathan Z. Smith, "Religion, Religions, Religious," in Critical Terms (ed. Mark C. Taylor, 1998). See also Smith (1982).</page><page sequence="6">106 KIMERER L. LAMOTHE or empirically proved) that serves the needs of reason by providing a point of orientation (such as an idea of infinite order) or by enhanc ing our ability to derive pleasure from obeying the moral law (such as an idea of absolute goodness).14 All religious phenomena, for Kant, stand or fall as "religion" based on the degree to which they express and encourage rational belief. Reading between the lines of this essay, it appears that Kant's identification of rational belief as the essence of religion rests on an assumption that writing is the practice best suited for maturing reason. As he insists, "all that is" needed to emerge from self-incurred imma turity is public freedom. He explains, "By the public use of one's own reason I mean that use which anyone may make of it as a man of learn ing addressing the entire reading public" (55). Public freedom is the abil ity to sit alone in a quiet place and read and write. It is a freedom pursued as an individual who detaches himself from civic responsibili ties, reflects upon his experiences, and addresses his thoughts to a "read ing public." Thus, to enjoy "free movement" with respect to "dogmas and formulas," revelation or history, a person must learn to open a distance between his sense of self and his bodily experience—including the immediate sensations of eyelids drooping, stomach growling, or rest lessness while sitting (55). For Kant, it is the practice of writing for a reading public that ensures that a person will develop a proper, rational relation to religion—one that serves to preserve the time and space needed for a free public exercise of reason. There is more to Kant's view of religion than the self-reinforcing cycle in which reason protects the conditions required for its own oper ation. Kant's rationalization of religion effectively locates the source of the sacred in the practice of writing for a reading public, over and against the acts of reading scripture, seeking revelation, or heeding tra dition. To develop one's reason, for Kant, is a "sacred right" (52), the purpose for which humans exist. Given this orientation it is not sur prising that "dance" does not appear on his screen as "religion." Dance is not only what those with immature reason do (primitives, children, 14 Kant encapsulates his view on rational belief and the idea of infinite order in "What is Orientation in Thinking?" (1960 [1786]); he discusses the rational belief in absolute goodness in Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone (1960 [1793]). See "Preface to the First Edition" for a concise summary. While scholars such as Wollstonecraft (1992 [1792]), Lloyd (1984) and Nicholson (1998) challenge the ways in which Kant identifies this rational capacity with men, much work remains to be done in developing an philosophy of religion that incorporates this critique. For one approach, see Jantzen, Becoming Divine: Toward a Feminist Philosophy of Religion (1999).</page><page sequence="7">WHY DANCE? 107 the "fair sex," lower classes and peasants). Dance is a practice that exercises attention to bodily sensation, and thus, develops a range of aesthetic sensibilities diametrically opposed to those Kant deems nec essary for the cultivation of a mature reason and a rationally-defensi ble view of "religion." Inwardization. As Proudfoot (1985) and Jantzen (1995) among others acknowledge, the inwardization of "religion" is largely cemented in the response Friedrich Schleiermacher levels against Kant.15 In his classic On Religion (1799), Schleiermacher insists that the core of religion is not "rational belief," but lies rather in the gifting of experience—in that living, fleeting moment just prior to any conception of subject and object.16 "Religion" is a "intuition and feeling of the universe" as acting in, on and through us—a moment which reason can know only in hindsight, and then, broken in two, as a (subjective) feeling of freedom and (objective) intuition of a universe or whole (22).17 For Schleiermacher, it is religion, this feeling and intuition of the universe, that provides us with the conditions needed to think rationally and act ethically. Against Kant, Schleiermacher insists: "Only the drive to intuit, if it is oriented to the infinite, places the mind in unlimited freedom; only religion saves it from the most ignominious fetters of opinion and desire ... it is just a question of finding the point from which one's relationship to the 15 See Jantzen (1995): "[T]he idea of such a mystical core of religion derives in large part from Schleiermacher's attempt to circumvent Kantian strictures on reli gious knowledge" (338). Jantzen also exposes how the move to privilege a mystical core of religion represents one of the "technologies of patriarchy." See note #21 below. 16 I disagree with Sharf when he describes the experience invoked by Schleiermacher (and others) as immediate, subjective, and unexamined. For Schleiermacher, as Sharf notes, the "mysterious moment" of religion represents an inextricable fusion of subject and object; it "occurs in every sensory perception" before "intuition and feeling have separated, where sense and its objects have, as it were, flowed into one another and become one" (in Taylor 1998: 31). The implication of this for mulation, however, is that any representation of this moment as an intuition (object/it) and a feeling (subject/I)—that is, as my experience—has already lost the moment. As a result, "I" can never know my own experience fully or immediately, for "it" always already includes the self I was in that moment. Van der Leeuw amplifies this implication of Schleiermacher's work in the design of his phenome nological method. See Part IV below. 17 See also: "The universe exists in uninterrupted activity and reveals itself to us every moment. Every form that it brings forth, every being to which it gives sep arate existence according to the fullness of life, every occurrence that slips forth from its rich ever-fruitful womb, is an action of the same upon us. Thus to accept everything individual as a part of the whole and everything limited as a representation of the infinite is religion" (25).</page><page sequence="8">108 KIMERER L. LAMOTHE infinite can be discovered" (28-9). For Schleiermacher then, the "touch stone" (24) for any theological or ritual form, is whether it cultivates the capacity for sensing and intuiting the ongoing, creative action of the universe at work in our relation to all that is. Given Schleiermacher's focus on sensing and intuiting, it would fol low that he recommends different practices for the maturation of a free human being. His "Third Speech" suggests as much. He urges inter locutors to educate their senses. Nevertheless, the practice he recom mends is sitting, and turning the senses inward. Schleiermacher dismisses the "prudent and practical people" (59) who are so busy scurrying from place to place that they cannot notice the deep inward call of religion. As he insists, "everything that belongs to a truly human life and that should be an ever more active and effective drive in us must proceed from the innermost part of our constitution. Religion is of this nature" (57). We must practice an inward listening. In this process, moreover, the act of writing remains crucial to a person's ability to educate the senses properly and for reasons similar to those of Kant. The practice of writing, for Schleiermacher, protects a person's reason from being encumbered by theological dogma. In writing a person discovers how impossible it is to rationalize religion: to describe religion is to "desecrate" it (32). As such the act of writing provides a person with a perspective from which to see that whatever can be written about religion—including theology and tradition—is merely an empty husk. By writing a person preserves the freedom to honor her own inward experience as the locus of revelation and com munion.18 The fact that he is writing about "religion" at all, Schleiermacher avers, attests to its truth: only if there were something more pressing than reason acting upon him would he engage in such an irrational act.19 18 The dependence on writing undercuts Schleiermacher's otherwise positive endorsement of women as well. Even though Schleiermacher celebrates women as having a more acute ability to feel than men, it is men, primarily, who write. Although there is evidence that he wrote some of his texts with a woman he esteemed and loved, and that ideas in the text derived from letters she had writ ten to him, the authorship of the text remained his alone. See Richardson (1991) for an exposition of Schleiermacher's early views on women and their significance in his time. 19 As he insists: "That I speak does not originate from a rational decision of from hope or fear, nor does it happen in accord with some final purpose of for some arbitrary or accidental reason. It is the inner, irresistible necessity of my nature; it is a divine calling; it is that which determines my place in the universe and makes me the being that I am. Even if it were neither suitable nor prudent</page><page sequence="9">WHY DANCE? 109 Thus what initially appears as a shift in the essence of religion from rational belief to inner experience serves to reinforce a belief in the practice of writing as capable of guaranteeing a proper relation of reason to "religion."20 For both Kant and Schleiermacher writing mediates rational reflection on religion—regardless of whether religion is a mat ter of belief or feeling. In so far as this axis (rational belief versus inner experience) continues to define a dimension of the field of religious studies, the hope of acknowledging dance as religion are bleak.21 At best a scholar who works within this paradigm can perceive and eval uate the action of dancing as an external, derivative expression of what "religion," at its core, should be. Textualization. The forces of rationalization and inwardization give rise to a third that crystallizes what they already imply: a privileging of texts to speak of religion, the thing that thus drives me crushes these petty notions with its heavenly power" (5). 20 Donald Lopez notes the interdependence of rationalization and inwardization in his critique of belief: "The problem, then, is not whether belief exists. . . but whether religion must be represented as something that derives from belief, as something with external manifestations that can ultimately be traced back to an inner assent to a cognitive preposition, as a state of mind that produces practice" (in Taylor 1998: 34). He identifies the roots of this nexus in "an assumption deriv ing from the history of Christianity that religion is above all an interior state of assent to certain truths" (31), and calls for an understanding of belief as arising "from a specific set of material interests" (28). My critique reaches for the histor ical, material interests driving this "assumption." I seek to move beyond a con textual approach to religion (i.e., linking belief to a set of material interests) to a relational, dynamic approach described in Part IV below. 21 As Asad notes, dance is not the only aspect of human life that suffers from this perspective. By defining religion as a rationally defensible, inward event, he notes, scholars misinterpret medieval Christianity (45-6, and in general, Chapters 1-4). "It is preeminently the [post-Enlightenment] Christian church that has occupied itself with identifying, cultivating and testing belief as a verbalizable inner condition of true religion" (48). Grace Jantzen (1995) agrees and elaborates. Describing how modern philoso phers of religion rely upon the example of medieval Christianity to defend their attempts to identify an inner (rationally-defensible) core of religion, she writes: "For such projects to be possible, it is essential that mysticism be seen as an ineffable, private state of consciousness" (320-1). She also notes how the privatization of mys ticism serves a patriarchal agenda, domesticating the religious experiences of women: it "keeps God (and women) safely out of politics and the public realm; it allows mysticism to flourish as a secret inner life" among those who prop up the status quo (346). She concludes: "the idea of an essence of mysticism is a patriarchal con struct" (347). I would add that the yoking of mysticism with a private, inward belief has encouraged scholars to ignore the bodily dimensions of medieval life—including occurrences, however rare, of dancing. For an example of an attempt to correct this bias in medieval studies, see Performance and Transformation: New Approaches to Late Medieval Spirituality (1999), edited by Mary A. Suydam &amp; Joanna E. Ziegler.</page><page sequence="10">1 10 KIMERER L. LAMOTHE as object, method, model, and goal of religious studies. As the field emerged in the last decades of the nineteenth century, religionists of all sorts embraced written texts or scripts as the forms that best doc ument the defining core of religion, whether rational belief or inward feeling. The corollaries continue to guide graduate education in the field: a scholar accesses an objective meaning of religious phenomena (whatever the form) by studying languages, translating texts, and apply ing linguistic models of interpretation to discern their meaning. Decades before Max Muller Hegel's philosophy of religion set the stage for this development. In his 1827 Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion Hegel identifies his practice of philosophizing about religion as itself a kind of religious practice or "cultus" capable of realizing the truth of religion: "philosophy [too] is a continual cultus" (194). For Hegel, when scholars practice philosophy in the way he describes, they will not only understand religion as a concept and as historical forms; they will actu alize in their own actions what "religion"—Christianity in particular— promises: namely, the reconciliation or consummation of human and God, absolute knowing. They will come to know for themselves what religion represents in a figurative form. Said otherwise, Hegel confirms that by reading and writing about "religion"—as both a concept and as historical shapes—philosophers will learn to see "spirit." "Spirit" is Hegel's name for the absolute conceived as the movement of its own becoming, an "eternally bringing itself forth" (411).22 In short, it is by practicing philosophy that people will develop a consciousness of how their thinking about religion is participating in the process by which Spirit (as all that is) becomes conscious (in human minds) of itself (as the movement of its own becoming). The implications of Hegel's position drive the textualization of "reli gion": historical manifestations of religion are figurative representations of philosophical truths; the philosopher or scholar of religion is best positioned to interpret the figurative language of religious phenomena, and the authority for so doing derives from how the practices of phi losophy— reading and writing—train human reason to see (the absolute as) spirit. In his account of texualization as it flourishes beyond Hegel into the twentieth century, Talal Asad implies that the act of conceptualizing "religion" as a figurative or symbolic text is what enables the study of 22 See also the "Preface" that Hegel wrote for the Phenomenology of Spirit (1977 [1806]).</page><page sequence="11">WHY DANCE? 1 1 1 religion to come into existence as an academic discipline. Asad notes that even when scholars in the early twentieth century endorse the study of rites and rituals, they approach these actions as texts, as sym bolic actions rather than disciplinary practices: scholars seek to read their meaning.23 At stake in this strategy, he affirms, is nothing less than the success of the academic enterprise. If ritual is merely symbolic action (i.e., a representation as opposed to a transforming practice), then we can read it. We can, for example, "capture the essence of Islamic rit ual" without being Muslim or without performing the ritual. "All that is required is the attempt to understand, with 'sympathy and respect as well as openness to the sources,' what Islamic rituals 'portray and symbolize' " (79). In other words, only when we assume that religious phenomena are like texts can we assume that the process of learning languages, deciphering texts (whether written or enacted), and trans lating meaning from a foreign context to our own will produce objective scholarship, a rational perspective on "religion." Despite the ample fruits, the costs of text-driven approaches to studying religion are many. In relation to dancing, for example, when scholars approach it as symbolic action, they fail to consider any contribution to religion made by the action of dancing itself. They assume that inter preting the dance entails reading the gestures as expressions of stories or states of consciousness, and translating this body language into ration ally-defensible motivations. More important still, text-driven approaches foster ignorance of the dynamic on which the scholarly enterprise itself rests: namely, the fact that reading and writing themselves are disciplines that inform what a scholar can perceive, think, and understand.24 Such approaches encour age scholars to ignore how their own practices of scholarship educate their sensibilities and exercise their attention away from dance. Text based methods assume as normative the experience of the body that 23 Assessing the implications of this development, he queries: "is it possible that the transformation of rites from discipline to symbol, from practicing distinctive virtues (passions) to representing by means of practices, has been one of the pre conditions for the larger conceptual transformation of heterogeneous life (acting and being acted upon) into readable text?" (79). 24 Margaret Miles has developed a similar critique in her work on images in Christian history. She argues that text-driven approaches render invisible those whose primary modes of communication and experience are not verbal. She guides scholars in developing theories of visual understanding and methods of critical image use. See Image as Insight (1985), chapters 1, 2 and 7 in particular, and for an appli cation, Carnal Knowing: Female Nakedness and Religious Meaning in the Christian West (1991).</page><page sequence="12">1 1 2 KIMERER L. LAMOTHE scholars themselves cultivate in mastering the acts of reading and writ ing. They reproduce a belief that writing is the practice by which reason exerts its freedom over and against bodily experience and thereby secures a rational stance on "religion." Scholars using such method thus per petuate against their best intentions a resistance to acknowledging rhyth mic bodily action in its myriad forms as effective with respect to "religion." 2. Theories of Ritual as Practice and Performance Nowhere have challenges to belief-centered, text-driven approaches to religious studies been more developed than in recent theories of ritual as practice and performance. Even here, however, forces of rationali zation, inwardization, and textualization continue to operate, foreclos ing attention to contributions dancing makes in religious life. I consider a representative of each camp before moving to explore what Duncan and van der Leeuw offer this conversation. Ritual as practice. In developing her theory of ritual as practice, Catherine Bell draws on Foucault, Bourdieu, de Certeau and others to account for the role played by concrete human laboring in the process through which people become religious subjects.25 Bell develops the idea of "rit ualization" to identify how ways of acting distinguish themselves for specific purposes (1997: 81). As she affirms such a perspective encour ages attention to the "primacy" of the body, and its active role in ritual as "simultaneously defining (imposing) and experiencing (receiving) the values ordering the environment" (1997: 82). However, Bell embraces "the body" at the expense of (its) consciousness. Bell talks of the "vocab ulary" of ritual as gesture and word; she asserts that ritual creates rit ualized agents who embody cultural "schémas" (1997: 81). She concludes that the ritual efficacy of bodily action depends upon the participants' misrecognition of what their own bodies are doing. She does so in order to secure a rational explanation for why people move their bodies in space: if participants knew that they were constructing their own reality rather than transmitting eternal truths, they would have no reason to make the movements. 25 See Bell, Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice (1992) and Ritual (1997) in particular.

The result is a curious impasse: "we" as scholars can never know how a given ritual makes or inscribes bodies. We cannot ask "them" because they do not know. Yet we do not ourselves know because we are not engaged in such bodily action— we are only writing. Borrowing Asad's terms, Bell's work traces the "divorce" that founds the field between an idea of ritual as "represen tations and skill in manipulating representations," on the one hand, and as a "disciplinary program for forming the self' on the other (Asad 1993: 67-8).26 In so far as scholars perceive ritual as the former they end up discussing the body as a passive recipient of "cultural imprints" or inscriptions (76), rather than as a process of its own becoming through perception and its own creative action. In so far as this divorce reflects and reproduces a belief in writing, as suggested above, then one implication for scholars seeking to under stand religion is that they must develop a consciousness of their own writing practice as a "disciplinary program." Bell acknowledges the need for such developments. She calls for "a reconstructed phenomenology— a phenomenology for the post-modern era, so to speak—in which the scholar and the conditions of the scholarly project itself are systemati cally included as part of the total phenomenon under scrutiny" (1997: 266). As Part IV attests, such was van der Leeuw's intent. Ritual as performance. In the study of ritual as performance, forces of forgetting may also be seen working in and against the attempt to affirm the bodily dimensions of ritual. In this area the work of Victor Turner is seminal.27 In Turner's words, "A performance is a dialectic of 'flow,' that is, spontaneous movement in which action and awareness are one, and 'reflexivity,' in which the central meanings, values, and goals of a 26 Asad specifically brings up the example of dancing as an activity that was perceived in the Renaissance both as a medium of representation and as a prac tice for developing moral virtues. In this sense, dancing challenges the distinction he sets up between representational and disciplinary perspectives on ritual (68-9). The fact that it is more difficult to the deny the disciplinary aspects of dance train ing perhaps explains as well its exclusion from theories of religion which depend for their success on conceptions of action as representational or symbolic. 27 See in particular: The Ritual Process (1966) and The Anthropology of Performance (1987). Other important theorists of performance include Erving Goffman (in anthro pology) and J.J. Austin (in linguistics). However, Turner worked most closely with religious materials and as such his work has been most influential to date for the orists in religious studies. Richard Schechner (1985) further develops Turner's perfor mative approach. For discussion, see Bell (1997), chapter 3.</page><page sequence="14">114 KIMERER L. LAMOTHE culture are seen 'in action'" (quoted in Schechner &amp; Appel, 1990: 1). Turner is critical of Geertz, for example, for reading social dramas as "texts," as mere records or explanations. He intends to access the "liv ing core" of ritual.28 What attention to dialectics of flow and reflexivity helps isolate, as Richard Schechner elaborates and is transformation: the rhythm of flow and reflection transforms those who participate in it. The question with which Turner and those who follow in his wake wrestle is how to articulate the nature of these transformations. When faced with this question nearly every scholar poses yet evades the issue. The collection of essays edited by Schechner and Appel, By Means of Performance (1991), still at the growing edge of the field, offers the fol lowing examples.29 Barbara Myerhoff notes that anthropologists are "weak" when it comes to discussing ritual transformations: "The more powerful altered states: trance, ecstasy, possession, obsession, conver sion, and the like are often regarded as ineffable" (245). In his essay Schechner demonstrates this weakness. He describes how humans "are able to absorb and learn behavior so thoroughly that the new 'per formed' behavior knits seamlessly into ongoing 'spontaneous' action," but he does not give an account of how such absorption and knitting occur (45). Phillip Zarrilli, in his study of Asian bodily disciplines, describes an "encoding of body-consciousness" that occurs through rep etition, and then invokes a "subtle interior psychophysical process" to account for the "interiority" that an actor in kathakali is able to develop (134). Monica Bethe and Karen Brazell, in discussing the training for noh theater, write: "The underlying rules may never be explicitly stated or taught, but they are subconsciously internalized during the course of training" (176). In these and many other instances across the field, scholars outline the limits of their ability to articulate the nature of transformation—bod ily, emotional, intellectual—that can occur in and through the act of performance. These limits represent the logical outcome of employing the three strategies (or forces of forgetting) described above. In an 28 Victor Turner, "Are there universals of performance in myth, ritual, and drama?" in Schechner &amp; Appel (1990: 16). 29 The essays in By Means of Performance (1990) document the written dimension of a conference given in honor of Victor Turner. The conference included per formances as well. Some of the essays in the collection attempt to detail the expe rience of performing as a way to grasp the efficacy of ritual. As such this collection witnesses to the need for the kind of development in scholarship I am advocating, in which scholars mine the performance arts for conceptual tools and not just for cases or examples of certain ideas.</page><page sequence="15">WHY DANCE? 1 1 5 attempt to rationalize (and thus validate) performance phenomena, schol ars seek to map the inward character of a transformation. To get at that inward character, they textualize the ritual action (even when resist ing a text-driven approach), by commenting upon the grammar and vocabulary of the event and using expressions such as "inscription" and "coding." In sum, they attempt to read bodily marks as clues to an inward transformation so as to provide a rational justification for the bod ily action. Against their best interests, such theorists deny agency to bod ily movement: they reinforce the view that writing is the medium through which they will exercise the freedom of their reason (and its objectivity) in relation to "religion." In sum, this analysis suggests that the obstacle to theorizing rhyth mic bodily movement is not simply a lingering Protestant bias towards beliefs or texts from which scholars in the field can easily extricate their work. The authority for strategies of rationalization, inwardization and texualization lies in the practice of writing—more precisely, in the lived experience generated by the act of writing. Appeals to objectivity derive their authority from a faith they deny—faith in writing as a disciplinary practice. In short scholars cannot see about their subjects what they are educated not to see about themselves: that what they do in practicing verbal skills changes their bodies, enabling and limiting what they can sense and know as "religion." When all we do is read and write, everything looks like a text, includ ing dance. Instances of dancing in religious contexts are compared to texts, treated like texts, translated into texts, and/or affirmed as bod ily writing. While scholars have made great progress in noticing and describing dances, they have not yet seriously challenged the forces that cultivate an ignorance of dance within religious studies. In order to acknowledge dance as religiously effective, it is not enough to see ritual as practice and performance; we must extend this analysis to the rational beliefs and inward experiences and textual processes of religion as well. Only then can we begin to shake the tenacious grip of rationalization, inwardization, and textualization over the scholarly imagination. Duncan and van der Leeuw, in their different ways, undertook this challenge. 3. Interpreting Duncan's Legacy Between 1899 and 1920, as scholars in Europe and America were nur turing the newly-emergent "science" of religion, the American dancer Isadora Duncan achieved remarkable success performing solo dances</page><page sequence="16">1 1 6 KIMERER L. LAMOTHE whose movements pulsed and flowed in accord with rhythms of water and wind, to the music of classical and Romantic composers. Along the way, she made a claim that was unique relative to other performers in her day and to people throughout history before her: as a woman performing dances of her own creation alone on stage in public, she was renewing religion. For Duncan, dance renews "religion" by generating new ideals of a human relation to the constitutive forces of the universe— ideals of god, beauty, and love; and it does so when a dancer moves from an awakened "soul." To date, few scholars in dance studies have paid attention to these claims other than to acknowledge that Duncan thought of her danc ing as "a religion" (Daly 1995: 10-11, 30). The omission is under standable. Duncan's allusions to religion are scattered across notes, speeches, and published writings; she uses the term to refer to specific traditions and to something that transcends them all. She ambiguously refers to herself as a "Pagan Puritan; Puritanical Pagan" (ML 255); a "mystic" in search of beauty and love. In response scholars attempting to delineate a "consistent theoretical framework" in her writings tend to purchase coherence at the expense of her religious vocabulary (Daly 1995: 29). Scholars interpret Duncan's references to soul, for example, as a "rhetorical strategy" aimed at gaining credibility for dance; as a "cultural habit" for naming deep emotional experiences;30 or as poetic "flowering."31 Concern among dance scholars to demonstrate the rigor of their emergent field (by employing the forces named above) rein forces the tendency to explain away Duncan's religious rhetoric. However, closer attention to this rhetoric reveals a pattern which van der Leeuw discerned: Duncan uses the term "religion" in much the same ways as her contemporaries in the field of religious studies, her beloved romantic poets, and in particular, the philosopher whose work "ravished" her "being," Friedrich Nietzsche (ML 141). Duncan uses the term "religion" to mount an engaged critique of Christian thought and practice. She deploys the term to reform Christianity along the trajectory of her engagement with it. A quick introduction to Duncan precedes an interpretation, via van der Leeuw, of her religious claims for her dance. 30 Daly (1995: 31-2). See also "[I]n Duncan's day, such invisible power. . . was accorded divine dimensions" (38). Franko (1995) discerns a theory of emotional expression embedded in Duncan's work. 31 Note: "[S]he analyzed her discovery of the solar plexus as the crater of all motor power (even if she did, at times, flower it by saying that the soul was in the solar plexus)" (Terry 1963: 95).</page><page sequence="17">WHY DANCE? 1 1 7 Duncan inherited her critical perspective on Christian religion from her mother, Mary Duncan, who, when Duncan was five months old, renounced her Catholicism and divorced her husband. It was Mary Duncan who instilled in her four children a passion for the arts—music, literature, the visual arts—and a commitment to developing their own artistic spirits. Ending her formal schooling at age 12, Duncan spent much of her time reading, dancing on the California beaches, and inventing what she called her "religious dances" (ML 28). She rejected existing traditions of dance—the codified techniques of ballet, the titil lating entertainment of vaudeville, the class-bound social dances—for failing to realize the potency of dance as art. She rejected the forms of Protestant and Catholic Christianity with which she was familiar for failing to realize the holiness of human embodiment. Supported by her family, she nurtured her passion for dancing into a conviction that dancing is the art capable of overcoming western Christian antipathy to the body she believed that dance could generate new ideals of bod ily being as "holy." In 1899, convinced that Americans did not under stand her vision, she left for Europe, family in tow. Indeed, in Europe Duncan found the inspiration and audiences she needed to develop her principles of dance practice and performance. In London and in Paris, she frequented museums, studying the danc ing figures on Greek artifacts. She traveled to Greece; she read Nietzsche, Whitman, Keats, Rousseau, Darwin and Haeckel. By 1902, Duncan was performing for large, enthusiastic crowds—in Budapest, Munich, and Vienna, and then on to Paris and Moscow, through Italy and the Netherlands. In 1903 she delivered and published her first essay, "The Dance of the Future," in which she proclaims that dance is "a high religious art" (AD 62). In Berlin they called her "Das heilige Isadora": (Lowenthal 1993: 193). When van der Leeuw credits Duncan for demonstrating how dance can appear as religion, an "expression of life," he suggests an approach for analyzing the religious rhetoric that Duncan continued to use in the essays she wrote from 1903 to her untimely death in 1927. For van der Leeuw (pre-figuring J.Z. Smith) "religion" is first and foremost a "name" for that which appears: it is a concept or category people use to represent whatever idea, act, artifact, or event appears to them as related to other appearances or "phenomena" they have learned to associate with the name "religion."32 For van der Leeuw, as such, there is no "essence" to religion that lies behind the shapes of its See the "Epilegomena" from van der Leeuw (REM).</page><page sequence="18">1 1 8 KIMERER L. LAMOTHE manifestations;33 there are only appearances. Further, what appears to someone as "religion" does so as a function of the relationship between the person and that which appears—the relationship between what appears and the web of other phenomena with which the person is familiar as "religion" due to his or her education and experiences. Several implications follow. First van der Leeuw insists that what ever appears to someone as "religion" is as much concealed as it is revealed by the web of "structural relations" that enable its appearance in the first place. As a name "religion" functions as a conceptual "net" or "network" cast over "the chaotic maze of so-called reality" (REM 672). Second, the shape of any person's (definition of) "religion" is unique—a function of his or her irreducibly singular embodiment in space and time. Third, every application of the term "religion" reweaves the web of phenomena which comprise it, opening the possibility for new appearances of meaning. Returning to Duncan, this perspective on "religion" opens an avenue for interpreting her religious rhetoric. By yoking the name "religion" with "dance," Duncan was calling upon her contemporaries to reweave the webs of meaning they associate with "dance" and "religion" in order to open themselves to new appearances of each. She was not seeking to align her dancing with any given expression or definition of religion. She sought to catalyze an interdependent development of what people of her time recognized as "dance" and as "religion."34 She envi sioned a future where what counts as "dance" would be practiced and performed as "religion," and where ideas and actions recognized as "religion" would be accountable to the practice of dancing. Duncan was inviting people to experience dancing (hers at least) in ways they reserved for "religion," and experience "religion" as what her dancing represents it to be. Moreover, Duncan's comments about dance as "religious art" not only represent her attempt to dislodge a Christian conception of reli gion and dance as mutually exclusive and often conflicting activities; they represent her attempt to move "religion" beyond a primary con 33 The irony is rich. Van der Leeuw is most often faulted for assuming an unspeakable "essence" of religion, for postulating a "sacred" something that exists behind all forms of religious life (See for example, Twiss &amp; Conser (1992). In fact, van der Leeuw says the opposite time and again: for the phenomenologist, "there is nothing whatever 'behind' the phenomenon" (REM 6). 34 For mainstream Christian attitudes towards dance at the time, see Wagner (1997).</page><page sequence="19">WHY DANCE? 1 19 cern with beliefs and texts. By yoking it with dance, Duncan reimag ines "religion" as practice and performance—as a practice of awakening "soul," and a performance that communicates participation in the dancer's experience of moving from an awakened soul. A brief survey of Duncan's soul language suggests that van der Leeuw's own definitions of dance, religion, and their coincidence build on Duncan's principles, and fur ther delineate the ways in which attention to (her) dancing as religion can help scholars of religion resist the forces of forgetting. Soul language. For Duncan the "first basic theory" of her art is that movement must flow from an awakened soul (AD 76). As such the "first step" in learning to dance is to awaken this "soul" (AD 52). While Duncan's "soul" talk might suggest a dualistic anthropology, van der Leeuw's analysis illuminates how she uses the word to stretch and reweave the webs of meaning generally associated with the term. Duncan uses to "soul" to name a transformation in a person's sense of her bod ily being. A person can come to sense movement impulses arising in what Duncan calls the "temporal home" of the soul, the beating, breath ing rhythms of the solar plexus (ML 341).35 In this experience, then, a dancer feels her body differently. She develops a physical consciousness— not an image of her body but a bodily sense of her self as (knowing herself through) movement. Further, "soul," for Duncan, names an ability not only to sense move ment impulses, but to move with them and give them kinetic expres sion. As a dancer develops this ability he begins to appreciate how the impulses seem to originate and pass beyond his bodily boundaries. He comes to sense his solar plexus as the site where he is open to receive and amplify currents of force and flow connecting him with what is. He undergoes what Duncan describes as a "conversion" in which he experiences himself as participating in what she calls "a "rhythmic unity which runs through all the manifestations of Nature" (AD 102), a "divine continuity." As Duncan phrases it, a dancer senses in and through his 35 Scholars have debated which external influences governed Duncan's choice of the solar plexus as the body center. Duncan may have been primed for her dis covery by exposure to the Delsarte system of exercise (for example, Terry 1963: Part I). In Delsarte's program, the body is composed of three zones: head, torso, and limbs, each of which in turn is composed of three zones. In the case of the torso, the three are the upper chest or heart, the solar plexus, and the lower abdom inal region. Movements that begin in the torso carry emotional and moral significance; those beginning in the solar plexus do so exclusively. However, for Duncan, move ment sourced in the solar plexus did more than express emotion. See Genevieve Stebbins, Delsarte System of Expression (1902 [1885]).</page><page sequence="20">120 KIMERER L. LAMOTHE own movement a "power within" where that power consists in the abil ity to move in ways that enact or bring into being his "relationship to the universal rhythm" (AD 52). Moreover Duncan avers, a dancer who has practiced receiving and moving with such impulses, can learn to recreate the forms of these experiences in designing and executing choreography. In so far as she does, her performance communicates at several levels. First, her move ments represent the physical consciousness she has cultivated—her hours of physical and mental practice. Second, as recreations of the shapes in which movement impulses have appeared to her, her dancing rep resents kinetic images of "the divine continuity" she has developed the ability to perceive. As kinetic, such images appear only in movement as the unseen patterns of physical consciousness animated in making a given shape.36 Third, in so far as her dancing presents such kinetic images, it also represents her particular body as "one with the great movement that runs through the universe" (AD 68)—she appears as the individual whose bodily movement communicates participation in what appears through her movement as a "universal Dionysiac movement" (AD 91). Duncan calls such dancing a "prayer" and a "rev elation." In other words, a dancer who moves from what Duncan calls an awakened "soul" can make visible and visceral her active partici pation in the generation of religious ideals. As Duncan hymns: "her movements will become godlike, mirroring in themselves the waves, the winds, the movements of growing things, the flight of birds, the passing of clouds, and finally the thought of man in his relation to the universe" (AD 63). In sum, Duncan affirms that through the practice and performance of (his) dance, a dancer develops a paradoxical ability: He is able to represent his individual body as a medium for generating kinetic images of (his dissolution in) a rhythmic unity of life. His dancing communicates participation in what his practice enables him to know: that a dancer who moves from an awakened soul speaks out of himself and some 36 For Duncan, such kinetic images appear in the form of wave movements. A wave is both form and movement; it is call and response: "the rhythm that rises, penetrates, holding in itself the impulse and the after-movement; call and response, bound endlessly in one cadence" (AD 99). Duncan observed wave forms in "all energy" around her—in classical music as well as the natural world, in the figures of Greek art and the pulsations of desire (IS 45). Nearly all of her dance creations feature movements that pulse and flow, even when crisply punctuated. "Blue Danube" and "Water Study" were two of her early crowd-pleasers.</page><page sequence="21">WHY DANCE? 121 thing greater (AD 52), out of his particular embodiment and (his sense of) ultimacy. In this vision for dancing, then, Duncan offers a notion of "religion" that moves beyond belief and its corollaries. Duncan uses the name "soul" in ways that resist inwardization: it is the experience of bodily movement that opens and represents a sense of inward depth as the source for the movement.37 In her description of dancing as generat ing "thoughts" of human in relation to the universe, she resists ration alization'. she roots theology in the experiential possibilities opened by bodily practice. By describing her performance as prayer and revelation, she resists textualization: what religious acts communicate is participa tion in the physical consciousness they represent. Thus, Duncan's reli gion language sketches a theory of religion as practice and performance. Religion involves practicing patterns of physical consciousness, educating sensory awareness, and cultivating vulnerability to currents of will, desire, and idea. It involves generating, performing, and thus enacting kinetic images of self in relation to others and world. From the perspective Duncan opens, theories of religion that privilege textual objects, models, or metaphors perpetuate an ignorance of what renders religion effective, namely the ways in which its ideas and actions express and choreograph a logic of bodily becoming.38 A Curious Coincidence. Van der Leeuw's own definitions of dance, reli gion and their coincidence resonate uncannily with Duncan's principles of dancing, and produce similar patterns of resistance to the forces of forgetting. In fact, he appears to draw inspiration from her work not 37 This reading represents my response to scholars who reject Duncan's "soul" language as mere rhetoric, or who critique her for reinscribing a dualism she pre tends to reject. As Nietzsche—whom Duncan read and admired—also knew, to speak only in material, bodily terms about dance would reinforce the place of dance in western Christian culture. Duncan discerned that realizing the potency of dance as art would require—and there is still much more work to be done—transform ing our study and practice of "religion." For further discussion of Duncan's rela tion to Nietzsche, see LaMothe, "A God Dances Through Me: Isadora Duncan on Friedrich Nietzsche's Ideas of Bodily Being" (2005a), and "Nietzsche's Dancers: Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, and The Revaluation of Christian Values" (2005b). 38 I am not implying that there is a "natural" logic of bodily becoming that can be identified apart from a given cultural formation of it. As Susan Foster discerns in relation to systems of dance training, whatever a body does makes it into what "it" is (1986: chapter 1). By "logic of bodily becoming", then, I seek to convey the idea that the way in which a body becomes what it is is never completely deter mined by society or "nature" but is a function of how an individual body, as a pattern of sensory awareness and response, moves in relation to cultural and environ mental factors. Every religion, I argue, represents a way of engaging and exploiting this logic.</page><page sequence="22">122 KIMERER L. LAMOTHE only in generating conceptual resources for studying other instances of dancing as religion, but also in developing his phenomenological method. First, van der Leeuw's definition of dance as a paradoxical rhythm of ecstasy and affirmation echoes Duncan's account of dance as move ment flowing from an awakened soul. On the one hand, for van der Leeuw, all dance is "ecstatic" in that the effort of executing the move ments of a dance places a dancer "beside" or "outside" herself (SPB 26; 1948, 41). As she learns to execute movements, a dancer alters the conceptual and sensible boundaries through which she ordinarily rec ognizes herself. A dancer becomes the rhythmic forms she performs— she loses herself, becomes other to herself. Van der Leeuw gives examples—the Mevlevi dervishes, the American Shakers, the Greek fol lowers of Dionysus. On the other hand, in the process of surrendering her sensations of self to the rhythmic forms, a dancer actualizes and projects a new sense and image of self as the one who is (lost to the) dancing. Van der Leeuw mentions animal dances, Hindu and Buddhist dances through whose choreographed forms a dancer enacts her iden tity in relation to the animal or goddess she dances. Despite the different emphases, however, van der Leeuw admits that a rhythm of ecstasy and affirmation, or discarding and seizing, is common to both forms. He writes: "To understand the psychology of the dance and to see at the same time its connection with religion, we must look upon its rhythm as motion and response, the seizing of life and the discarding of life. The rhythm unfolds in a double manner" (SPB 27; 1948, 42). It is this rhythm that he sees unfolding in Duncan's description of dance flowing from an awakened soul, described above. Nevertheless, van der Leeuw like Duncan admits that not all instances of dancing appear as religion. Dance appears as religion only when it also appears as an "expression of power"—a phrase echoing Duncan's "expression of life." For van der Leeuw a phenomenon has meaning as "religion" where it appears as an expression of "power" in two senses. Any action, law, art object, musical piece, text, or ritual expresses power when it appears as both a will to power, that is a human's attempt to master the horizons of knowledge and possibility, and, at the same time, as a demonstration of how humans are uncannily dis placed in the process of making those efforts by awesome and alluring forces other than themselves (REM Chapter 1; 679-80).39 In other words 39 A longer discussion of this theory is needed. Van der Leeuw is in line with contemporary thinkers in resisting any anthropomorphism or reification of "The Sacred" or "The Holy" as the core of religion. He chooses "power" as a word</page><page sequence="23">WHY DANCE? 123 "religion," for van der Leeuw, is a name for human acts that negoti ate human relationship to forces represented in those acts as constitu tive of life. The key for van der Leeuw is a claim to ultimacy: religion appears as "that on which no wider nor deeper meaning whatever can follow: it is the last word," a figure at an inner or outer edge of know ing (REM 680). With this definition it is not surprising that his descrip tion of instances where dance appears as religion is vintage Duncan. Around the world and throughout time, he concedes, people have believed "that the negation of self has brought [them] closer to a higher life" (SPB 26; 1948 41): ecstatic self-dissolution yields affirmation of "higher life" as a dancer experiences and transmits a "unification" of her "movements with the movement of the whole" (SPB 68; 1948 90). In sum, van der Leeuw's phenomenology of religion and dance illu minates by developing the significance of Duncan's claims for dance as movement flowing from an awakened soul. If her dancing is religion, then "religion" consists of practices of bodily attentiveness in which peo ple develop a physical consciousness of a paradox of ecstasy and affirmation that comes to characterize the rhythm of their bodily becoming, religion consists as well of performances in which dancers communicate kinetic images that enable those who do and/or watch to grasp a sense of their participa tion in the work of conceiving "life" as a "unity" [Einheit] or "oneness." For van der Leeuw and Duncan this (provisional, dynamic) definition of religion reflects a belief that dancing (alongside writing) is a medium for negotiating our relation to religion. 4. An "Indirect Method" Parallels between Duncan and van der Leeuw extend beyond their accounts of dance as religion to the methods of training they develop for dance and for phenomenology of religion, respectively. Exploring that eludes the distinction between secular and religious. "Power" works for him by articulating the difference. Moreover, van der Leeuw's notion of power is dynamic and relational in a way that draws upon Hegel and Nietzsche and prefigures Foucault. Like Foucault, van der Leeuw rejects a top-down model of power's oper ation. Power works through the forces of discipline, practice, and performance that exercise and open our capacity to know (what appears as Other) in particular ways. At the same time, van der Leeuw goes farther than Foucault in his ability to artic ulate the positive contribution of bodily becoming to the life of power. Van der Leeuw's work, in fact, could be helpful in further developing the implications of Foucault's work for theories of religion. For an introduction to Foucault's notion of "power", see Power!Knowledge (1980); for an example of its application, see Discipline and Punish (1977).</page><page sequence="24">124 KIMERER L. LAMOTHE these parallels suggests that dance is not only a worthy object of reli gious studies, it is also a potential resource for developing theories and methods for studying religion that challenge and complement text informed approaches described above. In particular, van der Leeuw's phenomenology of religion bears traces of Duncan's methods of dance training. A brief discussion of Duncan's approach to dance training illu minates how van der Leeuw's phenomenology avoids both an "objec tive" approach that reduces religion to what can be written about it and a "theological" approach that assumes a sui generis essence of religion. Awakening soul. While criticized as having no technique, Duncan artic ulated time and again the principles that guided her attitudes towards technique. In so far as dance entails awakening "soul" (as described above) it can neither be taught nor learned. The ability to dance can only be stirred into awareness by a coordinated exercise of physical, intellectual, emotional capabilities. "The dances of no two persons should be alike" (AD 58). As such Duncan rejected systems of education that enforce a sense of separation between physical and mental dimensions of human living. Such systems are detrimental to the process by which persons learn to sense and understand bodily movement as enacting their relationship to what appears in that movement as real. Instead of a school for dance, Duncan wanted a "School of Life." To this end Duncan worked out an approach to practice designed to catalyze in others what she had discovered in her own dance expe rience.40 She guided her students in simple exercises—walking, skip ping, running, leaping—in order to increase their strength and agility; she surrounded them with "an atmosphere of beauty" (AD 80)—nature, visual art and sculpture, poetry and music—in order to stir their aes thetic sensibility; she led them in increasingly complicated patterns of movement designed to refine their awakening physical consciousness. In these ways Duncan sought to create the conditions within which children could find within themselves a capacity to sense movement impulses, follow them through their particular body-shapes, and recre ate in dances the forms in which those impulses appeared to them so as to communicate participation in that experience to others. As she 40 In this respect, Duncan's work in dance echoes that of Schleiermacher as described above and parallels the work of her contemporary Rudolf Otto—both of whom also influenced van der Leeuw. In Otto's Idea of the Holy (1958), he denies that he can communicate an experience of the numinous to his readers. He writes his book as a "schema" which may stir in his readers an awareness of their own capacity to sense and respond to the "strange harmony of contrasts" that, for him, characterizes the "wholly other."</page><page sequence="25">WHY DANCE? 125 insists: "I have no system. My only purpose and my only effort have been to lead the child each day to grow and to move according to an inner impulse" (AD 119), where that "inner impulse" is the fruit of engaging in practices that invite a physical consciousness focused through the solar plexus. When she practices in this way, Duncan believes, a dancer is capable of generating kinetic images of a human in relation to the universe that do not reproduce a dualistic sense of "soul" in "body" or "religion" versus "dance"—images which live in her body as the capacity for making movements through which she knows her self as participating in the generative rhythms of life. Dancing, for Duncan contra Kant, is a practice that enables a person to develop the "highest intelligence in the freest body" (AD 63). Practicing understanding. Where Duncan rejects systems that force all bodies to make the same movements, van der Leeuw rejects methods that impose "imperiously dominating theory" upon the rich variety of phenomena (REM xxi). He decries such methods as equivalent to a "straight-jacket."41 In response, where Duncan insists she has "no sys tem," van der Leeuw asserts that his method is at best "indirect" (REM 677-8). He describes methodology in general as an afterthought: a scholar's attempt to describe what he has already done. In van der Leeuw's case, his phenomenology bears traces of having attended to moments in history—Duncan included—where something appears to someone as religion and dance. The coincidence is not surprising: his Religion in Essence and Manifestation was published the year after Sacred and Profane Beauty: The Holy in Art, in which he discusses dance. The problem, for van der Leeuw, with religionists who impose the ories of religion onto the manifold of life, is that they wield the term "religion" unconsciously, taking "it" for granted as a thing that is sim ply there. He designs his phenomenology of religion to help anyone employing the term appreciate it as a name and thus take responsibil ity for their own participation in the meaning it has for them. His phe nomenology is "indirect" in the sense that he posits no object or essence 41 From a 1926 article, "Some recent achievements of psychological research and their application to history, in particular, the history of religion" (in Waardenburg (1973: 399), hereafter "SRA"). The full quotation is: "Reality should no longer be violated by forcing it, with considerable difficulty, into a purely methodological strait-jacket and then, with no less difficulty, trying to wrest it free from it after having it duly 'explained' . . . reality is too rich and too manifold to leave us even the slightest hope that we may ever be able to interpret it out of one single principle and by one single method."</page><page sequence="26">126 KIMERER L. LAMOTHE to religion, no "thing" out there to examine. Instead his phenomenol ogy is intended to guide scholars in practicing understanding—in dis cerning why something appears to them, in the course of work as historian or theologian, as "religion."42 For van der Leeuw, "phenom enologists" practice imaginatively and empathetically recreating appear ances of meaning. They are constandy interrogating the web of "structural relations" that any given appearance of "religion" calls into being. The three non-linear moments of van der Leeuw's "indirect method" align with his Duncan-informed account of dance as religion in resisting the forces of forgetting. I describe each in turn. 1. First, what Duncan describes as an awakening of soul and van der Leeuw theorizes as a rhythm of ecstasy and affirmation finds a par allel in the two-fold rhythm of imaginative empathy van der Leeuw describes. To recreate for herself the structural relations under which something appears to her to appear to someone else as what she recognizes as "religion," a scholar must exercise empathy and imagination. Van der Leeuw describes "empathy" as an act of setting aside one's own expe riences in order to jump into the living stream of another's world, "transposing oneself into an object or re-experiencing it" (SRA 401).43 At the same time, however, a scholar must draw upon her own expe riences in order to imagine for herself why dimensions of that other per son's living stream appear as they do—to the natives as well as to her. In other words, van der Leeuw identifies a rhythm of seizing and dis carding one's lived experience as the enabling condition for under standing; lived experiences are resources on which scholars draw, whose influence they must always interrogate in "giving birth out of one's own mind to what stands already there" (SRA 404). For van der Leeuw, claims to "objective" results mask a scholar's vital role in courting and recreating appearances of meaning. 42 Van der Leeuw designs his phenomenology of religion to complement and correct work in history and theology. For a discussion of this "braided" method ological approach to the study of religion, see LaMothe (2004), Part Two. For a discussion of van der Leeuw's theology, see Carman (1965). 43 Van der Leeuw draws upon the work of "psychology" as developed by Dilthey and Jaspers in defining empathy. Van der Leeuw is aware that a phenomenolo gist "deprives himself by the act of empathy of any due prospect of his object, and even of seeing it at all" (SRA 401); however, he insists that the nature of the object—namely the meaning something has for someone—can not be understood any other way. As he notes, "Fie who wants to experience the stream [of another's consciousness] in its living coolness must learn how to swim" (SRA 402). The metaphor here is apt: "swimming" is an art in which a person learns how to move with the currents into which she jumps.</page><page sequence="27">WHY DANCE? 127 In his discussion of imaginative empathy van der Leeuw does not imply that self-consciousness precedes study. To the contrary. Van der Leeuw's method frames a scholar's understanding of religion as a func tion of a transforming encounter that brings into being both the object of study and the "self" of the scholar who sees it. A scholar comes to know (the meaning of) his past experiences in relation to what they enable to appear to him as "religion." Thus, van der Leeuw's method rejects the modern notion that a scholar is an "I" who can reflect rationally on bodily experience, the markers of gender, class, race, or the contents of "religion." Any appearance of "religion" always already represents a mutually generative relation between one's bodily becom ing and whatever phenomena appear. As van der Leeuw claims, "Only the persistent and strenuous application of this intense sympathy, only the uninterrupted learning of his role, qualifies the phenomenologist to interpret appearances" (REM 675). 2. Essential to this task of imaginative empathy is a second practice: a suspension of judgment. For van der Leeuw "epoche" refers to a "restraint" that enables a scholar to move freely back and forth between her embodied experiences and what appears to her about the life of another, and thus imagine empathetically the structural relations enabling a given appearance.44 At the same time, van der Leeuw insists, "This restraint... implies no mere methodological device, no cautious procedure, but the distinctive characteristic of man's whole attitude to reality" (REM 675). Van der Leeuw likens the practice of suspending judgment to the prac tice of love. It represents an attitude that is open to shocks of insight, to being transformed by one's conscious participation in the logic of one's own bodily becoming. 3. Finally, in practicing imaginative empathy and the suspension of judgment, van der Leeuw avers, a phenomenologist must practice moving. "The phenomenology of religion is dynamic: as soon as it ceases to 44 In using this term van der Leeuw makes reference to Husserl, only to dis tance himself from Husserl's quest for essences. In his "Preface" to Religion in Essence and Manifestation Ninian Smart writes that, for van der Leeuw, "epoche" or brack eting means suspending one's worldview in the name of objectivity. Smart then criticizes van der Leeuw for failing to produce objective results. However, for van der Leeuw, the epoche refers to the suspension not of biases per se, but of the desire to make claims to truth. What is suspended is an attitude towards what appears— a need to pursue it, pin it down, in its nature. Phenomenology resists the temp tation of asserting truth, fact, or reality. In fact, the epoche that Smart evokes would not provide grounds for imaginative empathy at all. Imaginative empathy as van der Leeuw describes involves interpolation into one's own experience, not abstraction from it (REM xii).</page><page sequence="28">128 KIMERER L. LAMOTHE move it ceases to operate" (REM 695). A phenomenologist is always on the move between "facts" described by historians and social scien tists, and "truths" offered by theologians; between what appears to him and his recreated interpretations of those appearances' meaning; between manifestations of religion around the world and those familiar to him. This incessant movement is what protects a scholar of religion from poetry or dogmatism; it is a mechanism of self-correction, ensuring that a scholar holds any understanding of a phenomenon accountable to those most affected by it. This process can never end, van der Leeuw admits, for it is coextensive with life. People will continue to generate new religious meanings, new meanings of religion, new perspectives on past events, and new experiences on which to draw in studying all of the above. In sum, what distinguishes van der Leeuw's indirect approach from idiosyncratic subjectivism is similar to what distinguishes Duncan's danc ing from untrained movement: a practice of cultivating physical con sciousness. Duncan and van der Leeuw both design (indirect) methods for helping individuals cultivate awareness of how bodily becoming par ticipates in enabling appearances of meaning. The medium through which we dance and/or understand is the medium through which we live. The implication for the scholar of religion is that how she trains her physical consciousness informs what kinds of appearances she is capable of receiving and recreating in words. Moreover, every time she pulls upon the fabric of her lived experience to recreate the structural relations that give rise to appearances of religion, she will come to see her experiences differently, in relation to the uses to which she applies them. Every appearance of religion will stretch and expand not only her sense of "religion" but also her sense of "self." For this reason, then, the relation of object to method van der Leeuw describes is not a self-reinforcing circle but an open spiral of discovery and response. For van der Leeuw it is the scholar's willingness to be transformed by an appear ance of meaning that guarantees that her findings will not be "purely" subjective, but will communicate a dynamic relationship of understanding. 5. Theorizing Religion as Practice and Performance What implications does this juxtaposition of van der Leeuw and Duncan have for theory and method in the study of religion? For one, their examples suggest the need for rethinking what we expect from theory and method. Both devised "indirect" methods for developing an ongoing</page><page sequence="29">WHY DANCE? 1 29 receptivity to flashes of insight: to movement impulses arising in the solar plexus, or to appearances of meaning dawning. Both methods, moreover, require that persons work to cultivate an awareness of how such receptivity expresses and engenders their own bodily becoming— their patterns of memory, sensitivity, and strength. If they do not, the forces of western Christian culture will pull them to believe in them selves as rational minds operating in and over material bodies. Duncan and van der Leeuw thus challenge scholars in religion to reflect upon the kinds of human potentials their practice and performance as schol ars enable them to develop. The question haunts: do our processes of scholarship develop in us the capacities we need to understand what it is we recognize as "religion"? Second, tracing Duncan's influence through van der Leeuw's account of religion and dance also offers resources for theorizing religion as practice and performance. The terms introduced here—physical con sciousness, logic of bodily becoming, rhythm of ecstasy and affirmation, kinetic image, spiral of discovery and response—need to be tested and refined by working them through additional cases. Still, the example of Duncan suggests that a scholar who uses these terms will resist priv ileging textual objects, models, and meanings as ciphers of inward belief or experience. If scholars think about "religion" as enacting a logic of bodily becoming, they will see religious phenomena of all kinds—visual, kinetic, oral, textual—in terms of the physical consciousness they express and enable. The questions they ask will change. Instead of asking about what a person believes (as a privileged defining moment of religion), we ask: how is a person exercising the bodily dimensions of his living? What possibilities for belief does a person's bodily movement open for him? What kind of physical consciousness does the ability to believe in "x" represent? Instead of asking what a person is thinking when she writes, dances, prays (and implying a rational intent), we ask: what range of sensitiv ity and responsiveness is she exercising through her bodily movement? What sense of her bodily becoming and its meaning is her action help ing her to develop? What possibilities for thought is she opening or foreclosing? Instead of asking about the meaning of a dance or ritual (as if the meaning can be detached from its action), we ask: what are the pos sibilities for perception and for meaning pulled into being by the pat terns of (in)attention required to make the given movements? Instead of asking what a practitioner is expressing (as if the source of</page><page sequence="30">130 KIMERER L. LAMOTHE the event lay in inward experience), we ask how are his practice and performance bringing into being as real a desired relation to tradition, to members of his community, to his sense (or lack thereof) of god/dess, to his own self? What networks do a given practice of bodily move ment bring into being as the condition enabling the performance? What webs of social relations (political, economic, familial, social) or webs of symbols and beliefs does the performance of a dance or ritual allow participants (and/or scholars) to grasp and comprehend? In short, instead of looking to find a text to explain what a phe nomenon means, we ask: what bodily movements enable the text's pro duction? What practices and performances does the existence of the text and the privilege accorded to it (by practitioners and/or scholars) represent? Why dance? In order to know. An approach to religion focused through bodily movement allows for the consideration of phenomena that have not received equal treatment in the past. Such appearances will pro duce new theories of "religion" and new methods for its study—reweav ing our definitional webs. A movement-centered approach promises resources for imaginatively recreating the meaning of transformations affected by religious belief and action as a function of how people enact a logic of bodily becoming—scholars included. Finally, this approach to religion encourages scholars to cultivate awareness of how the prac tice and performance of scholarship always already participates in their own bodily becoming, and vice versa. In so doing, this approach fos ters understandings of religion that are dynamic, relational, holistic, and ever accountable to the multiple logics of bodily becoming whose appear ances they enable.
