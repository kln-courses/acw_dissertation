<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 2  Ethical Criticism: From  Plato to Pluralism  If there is any agreement among literary theorists today, it  may be the common observation that modern criticism is in a  state of crisis .1 According to Rene Wellek, literary criticism en­ tered a state of crisis in 1914. Paul de Man fixes on 1970 as the  date when Continental influences pushed critical theory into  chaos. Apparently, criticism has been in crisis throughout its  history . The opening manifesto of the Stanford Literature Review  traces the origin of the present crisis to the time of Plato, and  indeed Plato is often named as the beginning of our current  anxieties in literary theory. What kind of crisis endures for so  many years? Can a crisis be one with the tradition itself?  A crisis is a state of affairs subject to little internal coherence or  consistency, unless it be the order of disorder itself. It is a period  of violent instability that threatens either to shift toward another  i. Concerning the relation between criticism and crisis, see Reinhart Koselleck, Kritik und Krise (Feiburg: Verlag Karl Alber, 1959); Rene Wellek, "The  Crisis of Comparative Literature," Concepts of Criticism (New Haven: Yale Uni­ versity Press, 1963), pp . 282-95; Paul de Man, "Criticism and Crisis," Blindness  and Insight (1971; reprint, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1983), pp.  3-19; John Freccero, Rene Girard, and Alphonse Juilland, Foreword, Stanford  Literature Review i . 2  (1984): 157-58; and William E.

For a crisis to be  resolved, the proper pressure, the proper decision, must be ap­ plied within the untoward state of affairs .  Even if one conceives  of order and disorder as relative terms, or defines disorder as  the dynamic passage between states of order, a question of per­ ception still arises: how does a crisis remain in a perpetual state  of crisis?  One way of addressing the apparent contradiction is to recog­ nize that the crisis in literary theory is defined around the nature  of criticism itself. The word "criticism," of course, derives from  the Greek krinein, which means to cut, to separate, to divide,  and to distinguish. On the one hand, criticism in its capacity to  separate and divide would seem to be the traditional antidote to  states of crisis, not the cause of disorder and lack of distinctions .  It is only when the critical nature of criticism disappears that it  may be said to be in crisis, for crisis turns upon the lack of those  differences that criticism exists to create . In other words, crit­ icism robbed of its differentiating talent falls into crisis .  On the  other hand, the current crisis in theory may have less to do with  the ability to make critical decisions than with the suspicion of  decision itself. Modern theory seems too aware of the relation  between "criticism" and "cutting," and literary theorists have  come increasingly to see critical decisions as the result of power  and violence . Critical distinctions appear too arbitrary for mod­ em tastes, and we have learned to suspect that arbitrariness  conceals self-interest and aggressive willfulness . This is not an  idle observation. The perception that criticism is violent is cru­ cial to the ethics of criticism because it marks the point where  literary theory and the ethical tradition begin to ask the same  questions about the nature of human beings and their capacity  for violence . Indeed, that the crisis of criticism derives in part  from an ethical reaction to the perceived violence of the critical  act reveals to what extent literary criticism and moral philoso­ phy have a common history.  But the fact that literary criticism has an ethical dimension  should shock more than it does. The wealth of critical literature  on ethics and the familiarity of the problem make it easy to  ignore what a philosophical puzzle is involved in the simple  </page> <page sequence="3"> 16  The Ethics of Criticism  phrase "ethical criticism."  From one point of view, there is noth­ ing extraordinary about it, for literary criticism has been seen,  ever since Plato, as serving moral philosophy. To speak of ethi­ cal criticism, however, is to fall into either redundancy or oxy­ moron, and as such, literary criticism does enter crisis with Pla­ to . Either literary criticism is seen as a branch of ethics, one of  the many disciplines used by ethics to exert control over differ­ ent areas of thought, or criticism exists at odds with ethical  requirements in its quest to chart poetic form not within the  ethical domain of truth but within the strange and elusive do­ main of fiction .  In the first case, criticism obeys the imperatives  of ethics to keep literature within the bounds of moral integrity.  Ethics and criticism are synonymous, and to call criticism ethical  is repetitious .  In the second case, criticism strives to diverge  from ethical requirements to establish its own identity and ob­ jectives and to invent a unique standard of literary content and  form. Here, to call criticism ethical is to commit the most per­ verse of oxymorons, for criticism and ethics are antonymous .   Ethics i s  supposed to  be  concerned with justice, and criticism is  most banal and predictable when it makes judicial claims, even  in the form of poetic justice . Indeed, the moral philosopher  should be threatened, or at least deeply embarrassed, by the  literary critic's allegiance to fiction.  Is there not a profound error in the idea that literary criticism  discovers its own nature by adhering to ethical requirements?  Literary theory has tended of late to answer this question in the  affirmative . The view that literary criticism is subject to ethical  demands has acted within recent critical history more and more  as a challenge to literary theorists to put an end to the situation.  In modern times, the history of literary study almost always  represents this challenge in a particular way. Criticism and liter­ ature are to be liberated from morality to ensure the freedom of  the literary imagination and to allow literature to pursue the  path most suitable for its individual and special development.  The attack on historical and biographical criticism by the Ameri­ can New Critics, for example, never failed to give as its rational­ ization the necessity of freeing literature from the demands of  external forces .  The familiar opposition between "extrinsic" and  </page> <page sequence="4"> Ethical Criticism 17  "intrinsic" criticism takes for granted that literary and nonliter­ ary standards need to be divided. Indeed, the study of "literari­ ness" has been identified as the true object of criticism by think­ ers from the most opposing schools . Rene Wellek defines  comparative literature as the discipline that pursues the problem  of literariness across national boundaries, leaving behind the  narrow view of comparative literature as a study of influences  between two or more countries or national authors . Jonathan  Culler similarly concludes in /1 American Critical Debate" that  "criticism advances by becoming increasingly formalistic, as lin­ guistics does" (5); and Paul de Man states with authority that  criticism pursues the study of letters and not of mankind. 2   No doubt criticism seeks the freedom to cut its unique path.  But "freedom" is not a neutral term; it belongs to the ethical  tradition. To understand the crisis of criticism, one must ask  from what criticism seeks to be liberated . If it seeks freedom  from ethics, what is it about ethics that is so disturbing? And if  modern ethics exists to guarantee freedom, equality, and non­ violence, should not ethics pit itself against the very elements  that literary criticism finds disturbing in ethics? It grows appar­ ent that the critical act does not lead to an exit from ethics at all.3  Rather, the idea of criticism strikes to the heart of an ethical  crisis concerning the nature of ethics. The rebellion of criticism  against ethics belongs to the struggle of ethics with itself. The  ethical substance of moral philosophy has come to be an ele­ ment of scandal and a source of crisis, and critical theory today  shares this element of scandal with ethics .  To chart the opposition of ethics to ethics would mean writing  a history of moral philosophy. Here I can propose only a brief  2.

Remarkably, each one  tries to eliminate what it finds most disturbing in itself under the  name of the other, and what distresses both about each other is  a certain collusion with violence . In effect, ethics expels its ethi­ cal substance as the violence of critical judgment, and criticism  struggles to free itself of its own violence by rejecting ethics .  Historical surveys tend to suggest exceptions more often than  the rule, and I intend my remarks not as a survey of historical  moments but as an overview of some case histories in which the  interference between ethics and criticism is especially acute . Pla­ to, of course, stands at the center of the debate concerning the  validity of associating ethics and criticism; indeed, the history of  his reception duplicates the history of the debate on ethical crit­ icism. Those moral philosophers interested in literature as well  as the great literary defenders of poetry have sought tradi­ tionally to reinterpret Plato or to use his arguments for their own  purposes.  This explains in part why Plato is often named as the  origin of the crisis in criticism. Yet Plato did not believe that  criticism was in crisis . He believed that literature and the arts  were in crisis . Literature invites a pluralistic stance that threat­ ens political regime, and consequently the moral philosopher  takes a firm hold on critical tools for the purpose of making the  adjustments necessary to enforce the civil requirements of jus­ tice and to bring poetry into agreement with the moral strictures  of the city . Literary criticism is for Plato the unreluctant enforcer  of ethical principles, and it ensures that literature provides only  positive models of behavior. In fact, literary criticism remains so  dependent on ethics in Plato that we speak only with difficulty  of a Platonic literary theory. Historians of criticism generally  agree that literary theory begins only with Aristotle .  Although Plato's argument is well known and often repeated,  it apparently holds little persuasive power for the modern read­ er, who is inclined to see Plato's remarks on poetry and govern­ ment as tyrannical . Part of the issue of ethical criticism will be to  reflect on this peculiarly modern perception, and I will return to  </page> <page sequence="6"> Ethical Criticism 19  the problem. It is surprising to note, however, how little Plato' s totalitarian leanings have been used against him within the tra­ dition of poetic defense. Most of the great defenses of poetry  struggle to redeem poetry within the rules set by Plato' s argu­ men.t  Few conceive of dismissing Plato' s  rejection of the poet  purely on the ethical grounds that the gesture is violent and  repressive.4   Despite the modern perception of  Plato, however, his argu­ ment has no equal in its ethical influence on critical method and  poetic defense. The Republic best demonstrates the Platonic  method of practical criticism. s  In Plato' s eyes, poetry is savagely  chaotic and a definite threat to the order of the republic. By  encouraging acting, impersonation, and pretense to science, it  imperils the Delphic wisdom of knowing onesel.f  Literature en­ tices citizens to play more than one role, destroying the pos­ sibility of justice. For Plato' s idea of justice depends on the neat  prescription that one person have one responsibility: "justice is  keeping what is properly one' s own and doing one' s own  job. ... Suppose a builder and a shoemaker tried to exchange  jobs, or to take on the tools and the prestige of each other' s trade, or suppose alternatively the same man tried to do both  jobs, would this and other exchanges of the kind do great harm  to the state? . . .  I think you' ll agree that this sort of mutual  interchange and interference spells destruction to our state"  (5.434.)  Plato repeatedly described drama and poetry in terms of their  ability to bring disorder into the order of the state. Acting espe­ cially has disastrous effects :  "it is unsuitable for our state, be­ cause there one man does one job and does not play two or a  multiplicity of roles" (3.397e.)  Plato genuinely feared artistic  mimesis, as Rene Girard has argued, because he believed that it  tempts people to appropriate each other' s r oles and invites com- 4· See Karl Popper, The Open Society and Its Enemies, 2 vols. (Princeton: At the  University Press, 1966) . To my knowledge, Popper is the first to remark the  similarities between Plato's idea of the state and totalitarianism. His book, writ­ ten in the shadow of World War n, is a remarkable example of how historical  events influence different interpretations of philosophical and literary works, for  Plato was usually associated, before Popper, with utopian views of government.  5.

When Plato expelled the poets from his republic, his intention  was to eliminate social violence . This aspect of Plato' s enterprise  is rarely emphasized because it lies concealed beneath his alle­ gories .  The philosophical tradition interested in epistemology  has ignored the ethical implications of Plato' s expulsion of poet­ ry and interpreted it in terms of the argument against inspira­ tion and for true knowledge . Similarly, the Platonic equation  between justice in the state and in the individual has encour­ aged moral philosophy to stress the idea of mental rather than  social conflict, even though Plato described the antagonism be­ tween the three parts of the soul with the metaphor of "civil  war. "  Each part of the soul, like each class in the republic, must  adhere to its own role if order is to survive . No part of the soul  may pretend to be another or challenge another' s a uthority. In  short, Plato' s ethical and aesthetic philosophies are one. He  reads Homer in the same manner that he reads society, and his  final objectives, the good and the beautiful, reveal in their abso­ lute natures to what degree Platonic philosophy serves an eth­ ico-aesthetic ambition. What is ultimately most striking about  Plato, however, is that he is more successful as a literary critic  than as a social reformer. His most extended examples of what  does not belong to proper conduct are based either on literary  works or on analyses of political "characters . "   The great question introduced by Plato i s  why does ethical  theory continually represent social conflict in literary terms?  How does literary criticism' s view of literary form become an  extended "allegory" for the ethical struggle with social violence  and disorder? The great paradox of Plato, and it is the paradox  with which both moral philosophy and literary criticism will  6. See Girard' s reading of Plato in Des choses cachees depuis la fondation du monde (Paris: Grasset, 1978), pp. 15-18.   </page> <page sequence="8"> Ethical Criticism 21  never cease struggling, springs from the fact that ethics ex­ presses its concern with the violence of society in literary forms,  but then rejects literature as "violent . "  The opposition of ethics  to literature becomes a bewildered attempt to reject its own  efforts to formulate a coherent ethical theory. This is why the  solution to Plato is not to strip away his poetic allegories to  reveal political conflicts . To expel Plato' s allegory for an ethical  purpose is to repeat the Platonic gesture par excellence.  Although Aristotle did not argue for an unethical criticism, he  was perhaps the first to lead literary theory away from the re­ quirements of ethical form. I do not mean to give Aristotle Kan­ tian motivations. Aristotle' s separation of ethics and literayr  the­ ory attempts to undo the paradox of ethical criticism: he divided  ethics and criticism so that ethics might take advantage of its  literary formulations without having to judge them at the same  time . But Aristotle' s gesture remains incomplete, and compar­ ing the ethics of the Poetics to that of the Nicomachean Ethics, as  has been the practice of classicists recently, suggests an unusual  interplay. Whereas the Nicomachean Ethics stresses that moral  agents must aim for a mean in their conduct, Aristotle argues in  the Poetics that the best tragedies include characters who are  unable to avoid committing a murder. Tragedy fails, in A risto­ tle' s estimation, when characters intend to do evil and reverse  themselves at the last minute . Aristotle, unlike Plato, was inter­ ested in literary characters who miss the mark (hamartia) in their  pursuit of moral excellence, and this emphasis appears to keep  poetry and ethics on separate ground. The obvious exception to  the rule is Aristotle' s praise for the ethical plot of the Iphigenia, in  which a recognition prevents a human sacrifice, but Aristotle' s  esteem for the play is not matched by equal weight in his argu­ ment, and, in the final analysis, it is Oedipus the King, the drama  of fateful violence, that serves to define tragedy. The tragic hero,  it seems, is doomed to fall short of the standard of moderation  required by the Nicomachean Ethics, and Aristotle, like Plato,  ends by defining literature as ethically troublesome. The point is  not, however, that ethics and criticism have nothing in common  or that Aristotle considers tragedy an unethical form. The point  remains that the complicated statements of literary forms do  </page> <page sequence="9"> 22 The Ethics of Criticism  contribute to moral philosophy because they present it with an  example with which to test its laws as well as an instance of  practice and particularity to temper the generalities of ethical  theory. 7   Moral philosophy in Aristotle tries not to expel its own theo­ ries in the form of literary judgments, but to retain its literary  formulations in their most antithetical and threatening forms  within the scope of moral philosophy. Literature, for Aristotle,  reveals the instability of human existence and the difficulty of  living morally in such a world. Aristotle's approach was  decidedly anti-Platonic, but his goals were not. Aristotle's pur­ pose was to discover a series of limits in order to guarantee the  integrity of the city and to protect citizens from both outside and  inside violence. That he refused, however, to banish literature,  despite its apparently conflictual character, that he established  literature as an instrument for judicial contemplation, opened  the humanistic age of ethics, in which ethics advances toward  the possibility of a political rather than a transcendental forma­ tion. Literature exists as the other of ethics within the bound­ aries of the state, and it acts continually as a reminder to moral  philosophy of the need to question itself.  The classicists, who stress this interplay, have been led to  suggest another interpretation of Aristotle's theory of catharsis.8  Catharsis does not strive to purge those emotions that threaten  the ethical stability of the city . Tragedy presents the city with its  own political and ethical flaws in an act of clarification and self­ definition, and it is this all-too-human nature that the popula­ tion both fears and pities .  Tragedy focuses on the political di­ mension of ethics. It reveals that standards of justice are the  products of political decisions and not of ideal forms, thereby  making it possible to debate those standards of justice .  7. Gerald Else, in Aristotle's Poetics: The Argument (Cambridge, Mass . :  Har­ vard University Press, 1957), attempts to merge Aristotle's ethics and poetics,  highlighting the lphigenia in particular because it rewards good characters. More  recently, Kathy Eden has proposed a reading of the Poetics that discloses Aristo­ tle's judicial idea of tragedy. See Kathy Eden, Poetic and Legal Fiction in the  Aristotelian Tradition (Princeton: At the University Press, 1986), pp. 25-6i .  8. See the remarks on catharsis in Martha C. Nussbaum, The Fragility of  Goodness (Cambridge: At the University Press, 1986), pp . 378-94.  </page> <page sequence="10"> Ethical Criticism 23  And yet for all of Aristotle' s achievement, and his opposition  to Plato, he ends by separating ethics and literary theory, if only  for the purpose of holding them together. Modern scholars may  struggle to merge his ethics and poetics, but we do not know  that he undertook the task himself, and his separation of poetic  making and moral practice ends by affirming within the history  of literary criticism not an Aristotelian but a Platonic solution:  ethics and criticism join only in the mutual effort to banish each  other.  In summary, then, only a minor difference exists between the  combination of ethics and literary criticism by Plato and Aristo­ tle . For Plato, literature served to promote a positive view of  ethical behavior. For Aristotle, it provides the "flaw," the nega­ tive example, upon which judgment and moderation are to be  based. Classical literary theory is therefore defined as the disci­ pline that systematically collects the guidelines by which litera­ ture either enforces or contradicts ethical laws with a view to  strengthening moral philosophy's vision of itself. In either case,  literary criticism is deprived of an ethical substance. It has little  creative role in the founding of ethical principles . Rather, its  ethical motivations are supplied and judged by philosophy.  With Kant, however, ethics enters the age of criticism. Kant' s  critical ethics brings together critical and moral philosophy in a  single objective : the resolution of conflict. Kant' s project takes  three forms. First, criticism, as Kant defined it, intervenes with­ in the philosophical tradition as a means of breaking the long­ standing opposition between dogmatism and skepticism. It  works to bring controversy to an end by detecting its sources  and presuppositions .  Second, the application of practical rea­ son, or the ethical, is designed to resolve the conflicts implicit in  ethical choice . Finally, Kant worked to resolve the conflict be­ tween ethics and aesthetics. In The Critique of Judgement, he  departed from the classical tradition by giving aesthetics a cre­ ative role within the practice of ethics, for "Beauty is the symbol  of morality" (§59) . 9  The accent must be placed on the word  9· Immanuel Kant, The Critique of Judgement, trans.

My reading of Kant draws inspiration  from Hannah Arendt, Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy (Chicago: At the  </page> <page sequence="11"> 24 The Ethics of Criticism  "symbol," as Ernst Cassirer understood, because art affects mo­ rality in purely representational terms.  If Plato and Aristotle described literature in its capacity to  symbolize violence and competition, Kant broke with them by  making literature the symbol of freedom. In Kantian philoso­ phy, literature creates its own domain and elevates it above the  clash of the world. The freer the work of art, the richer it is for  taste . For "Taste is," Kant explained, "the faculty of estimating  an object or a mode of representation by means of a delight or  aversion apart from any interest" (§5) .  Literature excites the idea of  a world free of interest, competition, and violence, and as such,  it provides the image of the goal toward which ethics should  strive . Only literature captures the inscrutability of the idea of  freedom upon which the entire program of Kan't s moral phi­ losophy rests .  Kan't s aesthetics and ethics always return to the idea of free­ dom, for the paradoxical "duty" of art is to provide the ideal  image of autonomy to the willing subject . Kan't s emphasis on  freedom demonstrates the degree to which he departed from  Plato' s vision of society, even though he stressed his debt to  Platonic idealism. Kant differed from Plato in holding that the  freedom of art no longer risks introducing chaos into the gov­ erning body, but instead designs the model for a world of free  personalities, a republic of self-sufficient subjects purposively  united. For Kant, art is the production of freedom by freedom,  not the lie of inspired and insipid poets; it designs the ideal form  of ethical practice . Most important, Kan't s idea of beauty cannot  exist, as Plato' s and Aristotle' s can, within the totalitarian state .  In Plato especially, literature is denounced because it introduces  a frightening plurality into his hierarchical regime. Contrarily,  Kant required that "pluralism" be part of the state, but he de­ fined it not in terms of a multiplicity of interpretations, as mod­ ern literary critics do, but in purely human terms .

Also valuable are Paul Guyer,  Kant and the Claims of Taste (Cambridge, Mass. :  Harvard University Press, 1979) ,  and Paul Guyer and Ted Cohen, eds . ,  Essays in Kant's Aesthetics (Chicago: At the  University Press, 1982).  </page> <page sequence="12"> Ethical Criticism 25  Kant explained in his Anthropology, represents the attitude of not  being occupied with oneself as the whole world but regarding  and conducting oneself as a citizen of the world .  Kan't s idea of pluralism is inseparable from his anthropology.  His moral philosophy demands a radical anthropology because  he refused to conceive of freedom apart from human activity  and willing. Freedom in Kant always refers to human liberty,  not to a freedom of objects or interpretations. Kant proceeded  from the nature of the human, and his critical philosophy as­ sumes that nature provides the conditions of possibility for ethi­ cal freedom and action. Similarly, human nature guarantees aes­ thetic communication by ensuring that all people share an equal  capacity for experience . Kant required that judgments of taste be  valid not egotistically but pluralistically. Art cannot exist with­ out morality, most significantly because beauty is communicable  only provided that there is human equality or, as Kant ex­ pressed it, "the subjective conditions of this faculty of aesthetic  judgement are identical with all men" (§38) . The universal com­ municability of taste requires the human context that Kant called  "universal subjectivity," that is, the common ground of cogni­ tion and autonomy shared equally by all individuals .   Kan't s idea of  freedom, in both the ethical and the aesthetic  senses, depends on the ability to make impartial judgments .  The categorical imperative legislates that personal interest can­ not become the rule for general ethical conduct. One may uni­ versalize one' s  desires only if they are in everyone' s interest  because truly selfish interests once universalized would destroy  personal freedom once and for all . If thieves present their be­ havior as a universal code of conduct, for example, they guaran­ tee that others will steal their goods, and private property will  cease to exist. Similarly, aesthetic judgment requires complete  impartiality of interest. "Every interest, " Kant concluded, "viti­ ates the judgement of taste and robs it of its impartiality" (§13) .   I f  an  object o f  contemplation has a personal interest for the  judge, it cannot be defined as beautiful . Both aesthetics and  ethics require human beings to renounce purely individual in­ terests in favor of universal principles .   What is  at issue in Kan't s d escription of aesthetic impartiality?  </page> <page sequence="13"> 26 The Ethics of Criticism  It is again a matter of freedom from social violence, for Kant was  interested in describing how freedom places constraints upon  itself. At the most fundamental level, the renunciation of per­ sonal interest acts to defer conflict over objects . Here Kant re­ turns to his classical origins.  Plato expelled artistic representa­ tion because he associated it with an excessive freedom and  disorder; he believed that art encourages citizens to compete  over roles and responsibilities .  The difference remains, how­ ever, that Plato laid the foundations of totalitarianism by assum­ ing that some individuals have a superior knowledge of how a  people' s  freedom must be limited in order to free them from  personal interests . Kant held that the universal interest of free  subjects dictates naturally which personal interests have to be  sacrificed in the interest of freedom.  The problem of moral and aesthetic disinterest, however,  does introduce a paradox into Kan't s critical ethics . The categori­ cal imperative demands that personal interest be renounced for  the sake of ethical conduct; yet the realm of moral practice is  ultimately one of interest, albeit common interest, because its  objective is perpetual peace . A similar problem arises in matters  of taste because aesthetic disinterest eventually implies the in­ tervention of moral interest. At first glance, the satisfaction that  determines taste seems devoid of interest, for Kant concluded  that any judgment tinged by the slightest interest will be partial.  Beauty possesses a purely symbolic purpose based on the "anal­ ogy" between ethical and aesthetic autonomy. It exists to give  the pleasure of freedom that is universally communicable with­ out being based in concepts, and literature must remain free of  moral demands if it is to fulfill its promise . Nevertheless, aes­ thetic judgment cannot escape a certain interest because aesthet­ ic disinterest symbolizes the moral freedom in which humanity  places the greatest hope . The paradox can be summarized as  follows. Literature represents the image and conditions of pos­ sibility for the ethical, but it must be isolated from morality in  practice to remain the image of the ethical. Simply put, literary  criticism must expel morality to guarantee the ethical purity of  literature .  Ethics cannot be practical if it relies on the fact of freedom. To  </page> <page sequence="14"> Ethical Criticism 27  have any value, however, moral philosophy must be practical,  and therefore its purest elements must be compromised to have  any impact in the world of human action. Kan't s s olution to the  paradox remained purely symbolic, and it has received varied  acceptance by subsequent thinkers. Kant once more relied on  the creative dimension of art to disclose a new path. He argued  that the paradoxical designs of ethics are united in the feeling of  art: in the free play of the powers of the mind, nature appears to  the perceiver as if it were a work of freedom. The solution is only  an image, an aesthetic judgment, but it allows individuals to  pass into teleological judgment and a synthesis of ends. The end  is the mental principle of union that judgment applies to the  totality of experience . It manifests itself in the idea of a formal  purposiveness in nature and in art. The concept of something  that is its own end, however, belongs purely to the idea of  freedom, not to the realm of nature . Only aesthetic judgment  permits us to transform nature into the image of freedom, into  the hypothesis of freedom' s conditions of possibility. The "pecu­ liar causality" of the end in itself designs the circle of the wil'l s  freedom, but Kant allowed art to share in that freedom; and in  the fact that freedom belongs to willing and art uniquely lies the  unity upon which Kant based his hopes for the emergence of his  "culture of moral feeling. "   Influenced strongly by Kan't s claim for art, the Romantic gen­ eration gave literature an even more creative role in ethical un­ derstanding. Poetic language serves as the instrument through  which the Romantic poet teaches others the essential moral na­ ture of mankind. 10 Two problems arise, however, with the Ro- 10. In A Defence of Poetry, Shelley insisted that "poetry acts to produce the moral improvement of man" (487) . Although Shelley broke with Plato in his  essential description of poetic inspiration as false, he realized the potential for  moral education that Plato ascribed to literature. To reconcile his allegiance to  Plato and to Rousseau's democratic ideals, he inverted Plato and gave literature  the moral capacity to envision human equality and freedom. In this regard, the  Romantic love of metaphor becomes a cipher for the democratic ideal of equality.  In the Defence, Shelley claimed that early human language was vitally metaphori­ cal, serving to mark the "before unapprehended relations of things" (482) . Shel­ ley's definition of "relations" is essentially democratic. "Relations" means "simili­ tudes," what Bacon referred to as "the same footsteps of nature impressed upon  the various subjects of the world" (482) . And these "relations" -in the largest  </page> <page sequence="15"> 28 The Ethics of Criticism  mantic project . As creators of poetic language, poets risk isolat­ ing themselves from their equals as either hierophants or  martyrs to a holy cause. The uniqueness of genius, which Kant  counterbalanced with the common sense of taste, proves an  attractive temptation for the aspiring poet, and the majority of  Romantic poets made a point of remarking that their special gifts  set them apart from others . The cult of the artist undermines the  principles of equality and freedom whose cause first stirred the  poetic imagination of the nineteenth century. As Schiller ex­ pressed it in On the Aesthetic Education of Man, poets meta­ morphose through their craft and return to their own age as  alien figures, not to gladden it, but to cleanse it. 1 1   sense, human relations-afford the motives o f  equality, diversity, unity, con­ trast, and mutual dependence according to which human beings act and will  within society. The great secret of morals and poetry is love, because Shelley's  idea of love realizes the essence of relation: love is in his mind "a going out of  our own nature, and an identification of ourselves with the beautiful which  exists in thought, action, or person, not our own" (487) . Wordsworth, in the  Preface to the Lyrical Ballads (1800), similarly ascribes the pleasure received by  the mind from metric language to the perception of "similitude in dissimilitude"  and the reverse. This perception, Wordsworth believed, is the great spring of  the human mind, enlivening sexual appetite, human conversation, and moral  feelings. Love and metaphor in Romantic theory provide mankind with the  moral sympathy necessary to find identity in difference and to stand in another's  place . If poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world, it is because  they enact with their art and language the fundamental principles of a free social  existence. It is only a matter, as Shelley said, of stripping away the "temporary  dress" of the poet's creations to discover "the eternal proportions of their beau­ ty" (487) . See Percy Bysshe Shelley, "A Defence of Poetry," in Shelley's Poetry and  Prose, ed. Donald H. Reiman and Sharon B. Powers (New York: Norton, 1977),  pp. 478-510.  1 1 .  Schiller's On the Aesthetic Education of Man is often named as using Kant  wrongly to enshrine art, but Schiller's inclinations were largely those of his  contemporaries .  Schiller gave aesthetics an even more active role in ethics than  did Kant, arguing that mankind must pass through the aesthetic condition, from  the sensual, to reach the ethical. Literature restores mankind to itself after the  fall. It reintroduces human beings to freedom, for Schiller believed that "Art is a  daughter of Freedom" (26) . Most important, beauty is not merely a symbol of  freedom, as Kant described it; "it is through Beauty," Schiller explained, "that  we arrive at Freedom" (27) . The risk in imposing any moral system remains that  it may destroy the plurality of nature: the essential equality of people that  the Romantics associated with emotional compatibility, human sympathy, and  the nature of sensibility. Schiller's solution was to propose that literature has the  ability to mediate between the two distinct realms of nature and culture by  </page> <page sequence="16"> Ethical Criticism 29  The second danger to the Romantic ethical project concerns  poetic language itself. As language acquires greater power to  embody the ethical, it also assumes greater responsibility for  moral success and failure . If language partakes of the moral, it  can be guilty of spreading immorality, and here the Platonic  theory of poetry receives a renewed vigor. Wordsworth, for  example, admitted with many others that the violence of his day  revitalized poetic language, but he felt increasingly guilty that  his poetry took substance and inspiration from the power of  violence . In "Upon Epitaphs (3) ,"  Wordsworth confessed that  "words are too awful an instrument for good and evil, to be  trifled with; they hold above all other external powers a domin­ ion over thoughts . . . . L anguage, if it do not uphold, and feed,  and leave in quiet, like the power of gravitation or the air  we breathe, is a counter-spirit, unremittingly and noiselessly  at work, to subvert, to lay waste, to vitiate, and to dissolve"  (129-30.) 12 Just as the unique genius of poets (a la Plato) makes  them responsible for the immorality of their work, the awful  instrument of language exerts a special duty in ethical af­ fairs . Language in Romantic theories possesses the capacity to  vitiate and reorient thought, and it must be used responsibly if  its potential for violence is not to be unleashed on human so­ ciety.  The Romantic shift from moral action to language is admit­ tedly subtle, but it has an enormous impact nevertheless . It  prepares the way for the importance given by some modern  philosophers and literary critics to language over human action.  In twentieth-century Anglo-American philosophy-in the work  of C. L. Stevenson, for instance-the idea of linguistic autono­ my supports the belief that moral philosophers may discuss  only the language of ethics, not conduct itself. Similarly, literary  critics have tended to interpret the autonomy of literature not as  a symbol of ethical freedom but as a property of literary repre- lending to the unity of physical society the plurality of nature.

The famous gap between the signifier and signified  discovered by semiology ensures the belief that language is dis­ tinct from other phenomena. Among the New Critics and  poststructuralists in particular, the principle of linguistic auton­ omy underlies the special status given to "poetry" and "tex­ tuality" and contributes to the idea that no form of language can  be grounded in external phenomena.  The shift between human and literary autonomy is a peculiar  feature of both modern ethics and literary criticism, and it de­ rives its strength from the emerging importance of language as  the interpretive category of modern though.t  Most important,  the shift ends by radically altering Kant's idea of pluralism, rob­ bing it of its human context and transforming it into an issue of  language. Indeed, the worse offense that one can commit today  is to ground a literary interpretation in an anthropological bias.  Nevertheless, the fact that linguistic autonomy and plurality in  interpretation are defended with such moral enthusiasm sug­ gests that they may yet carry the symbolism that Kant afforded  them. Even among the most strident opponents of ethical crit­ icism, the fight to preserve the autonomy of literature from mo­ rality can be justified only if it furthers the ends of ethics.  Before I turn to the current view of ethical criticism, however,  it is necessary to consider Nietzsche's contribution to the notion  of pluralism because it had a profound effect on ethics in gener­ a.l  Nietzsche transformed the notion of pluralism into precisely  what Kant most abhorred:  the idea of being preoccupied with  oneself as the whole world. In Nietzsche's world, autonomy  and ethics exclude each other, and the human race is composed  of a plurality of radical individuals in which each person strug­ gles with every other in a contest of wills. Moral language obeys  the will to power; it is nothing but a system of representations  intended to conceal emotions and to manipulate other people.  Similarly, literature exists to express power and hardly differs  from morality.  Since everything, in Nietzsche's view, has a common source  in the will to power, he had no reason to oppose criticism and  ethics. Nietzsche' s singular view of metaphysics has been called  an inverted Platonism, and he certainly seems to have applied  </page> <page sequence="18"> Ethical Criticism 31  Plato' s view of literature to ethics . Now ethical theory, not poet­ ry, represents the lie of those drunk with the desire for power.  Ethics is a system of inspired falsehoods designed to reverse the  natural order of human might and to give power to those who  possess neither real knowledge nor merit. Nietzsche may have  inverted Plato, but he did not dispute that literature is largely  immoral. The surprise is that Nietzsche believed that literature  expresses, by virtue of its immorality, the only truth possible,  that is, the untruth of ethical language. Thus literature frees  itself from ethics at last by discounting ethics as mere literature .  It is currently fashionable to credit Nietzsche as the philoso­ pher who exposed the metaphorical nature of ethical truths.  Poststructuralist theorists return habitually to his essay "On  Truth and Lie in the Extra-Moral Sense" to debunk the will to  truth as mere anthropomorphism. Apparently, for them, Nietz­ sche makes it possible to pass beyond Kan't s anthropological  emphasis by discovering the primacy of language in human  history. But Nietzsche' s preoccupation with language was lim­ ited; he had literary pretensions to be sure, especially for his  style, but his principal interest was ethics and not literature . Nor  did Nietzsche dismiss the anthropological context, as many  wish to claim. His philosophy is notorious precisely because he  refused to abandon the anthropological definition of pluralism.  Pluralism, for Nietzsche, refers to the inescapable isolation of  every person from every other and to the inexorable need of all  persons to transform themselves into gods.  Nietzsche' s descrip­ tion of the will to power derives both its great originality and its  horror from the fact that he pushes human selfishness to its  limit. His vision of human society is pessimistic because he can­ not conceive of any form of social agreement that would not  serve violence and repression. The natural result is Nietzsche' s  theory of the overman, a superhuman individual who regulates  his desires and behavior not for the sake of others or under the  compulsion of social contract but for his own satisfaction.  Modem ethics and literary criticism both preserve Nietzsche' s  view of pluralism, but they blind themselves to its most dreadful  aspects . They accomplish the task, as I noted, largely by inter­ preting pluralism as a linguistic rather than human category.  </page> <page sequence="19"> 32 The Ethics of Criticism  The emotivists, for example, agree with Nietzsche that moral  language exists only to vent emotions and to manipulate other  people . Not being sufficiently Nietzschean, however, they con­ clude that moral language is too irrational to merit analysis .   Modern critical theorists define pluralism as  a literary or linguis­ tic property, and, like Nietzsche, they view it as an expression of  autonomy. Since they isolate language from its social context,  however, they fail to see the inadequacy of their linguistic view  of pluralism.  What lies behind the modern tendency to equate ethical be­ havior and linguistic pluralism? It relates in its most profound  aspects to the struggle of ethics with itself over the issue of social  violence . In "The Ethics of Linguistics," Julia Kristeva, although  a believer in linguistic pluralism, gives a remarkably clear de­ scription of the view of ethics current in literary criticism. 13 Eth­ ics today must take as its primary aim the dissolution of the form  of ethics associated with repression and violence:  Ethics used to be a coercive, customary manner of ensuring the  cohesiveness of a particular group though the repetition of a  code-a more or less accepted apologue. Now, however, the  issue of ethics crops up wherever a code (mores, social contract)  must be shattered in order to give way to the free play of nega­ tivity, need, desire, pleasure, and jouissance, before being put  together again, although temporarily and with full knowledge of  what is involved.  Fascism and Stalinism stand for the barriers  that the new adjustment between a law and its transgression  comes against. (23)  Kristeva' s political motives are stronger than those of the oth­ er pluralists present on the current scene . Nevertheless, she still  13 .  Julia Kristeva, "The Ethics of Linguistics,"  Desire in Language, trans.  Thomas Gora, Alice Jardine, and Leon S .  Roudiez (New York: Columbia Univer­ sity Press, 198o), pp. 23-3.5· This essay is not, however, a definitive statement of  Kristeva's position. Elsewhere, for example, Kristeva departs slightly from her  dependence on marginal ethics, expressing concern that marginality, especially  that of women, is easily exploited by totalitarianism. But she still concludes that  only a knowledge of the relativity of symbolic and biological existence poses an  alternative to an ethics whose essence is largely sacrificial. See "Women's Time,"  trans .  Alice Jardine and Harry Blake, in Feminist Theory: A Critique of Ideology, ed.  Nannerl 0. Keohane, Michelle z. Rosaldo, and Barbara C.  Gelpi (Chicago: At  the University Press, 1981, 1982), pp. 31-54.  </page> <page sequence="20"> Ethical Criticism 33  defines ethics linguistically, making language the source of plu­ ralism as such. To arrive at a "linguistic ethics,"  literary criticism  must be deflected "toward a consideration of language as artic­ ulation of a heterogeneous process" (24) .  For Kristeva, hetero­ geneity, another term for pluralism, resides primarily in poetic  language, a language that frees marginal, negative, and destruc­ tive causalities .  The silent causalities of poetic language subvert  repressive social regimes, exploding totalitarian structures and  rigid models for daily existence . Traditionally, "coercive ethics"  struggles to kill poetic language to achieve its stability. "Conse­ quently," writes Kristeva, "we have this Platonistic acknowiedg­ ment on the eve of Stalinism and fascism: a (any) society may be  stabilized only if it excludes poetic language" (31 ) .   Kristeva's description of  the struggle of  ethics with itself  differs from current opinion only to the extent that she states  openly the political dimension of her choices. Her moral and  political choice is to take the side of poetic language against  society as such, and her apology for poetry consists of dismiss­ ing Plato's expulsion of the poet as a fascist gesture . For Kristeva  opposes poetic language explicitly to murder, death, and un­ changing society. Nevertheless, she remains within the Platonic  tradition insofar as she accepts its description of poetry as mar­ ginal to social and moral behavior. Her choice is Romantic be­ cause she defines ethics simply as taking the side of whatever  has been excluded by society. 14 For Kristeva, ultimately, there  14. The same theoretical problems exist in the work of Michel Foucault.  Foucault's allegiance to Romantic marginals, those expelled from history, re­ veals his history to be more anthropological than archaeological. His early ethics  are explicitly transgressive, as Kristeva's are, and they focus on the freeing of  desire from the forces of repression. Transgressive discourse captures the dis­ course of the subject, such as the discourse of madness explored in Madness and  Civilization, and refuses to create a norm or to expel. Indeed, Foucault usually  finds distasteful anything that recalls order, norm, or law, judging that any  discourse on a subject in fact weighs upon and crushes it beneath a desire for  discipline and order. Morality belongs for Foucault to the type of discourse that  operates on subjects; it is essentially normative and regulated, and comprises  finally a language useful only to order desire .  In The Use of Pleasure, however, Foucault seems at first glance to have aban­ doned this view. There he conceives of a subject of ethics who engages in an  exercise of selfhood that is autonomous and free from the constraints of law.  Nevertheless, upon closer inspection, Foucault' s older views remain. He defines  </page> <page sequence="21"> 34 The Ethics of Criticism  can be no society that is not repressively Platonic because every  society has its victims:  "The question is unavoidable: if we are  not on the side of those whom society wastes in order to re­ produce itself, where are we?" (31.)   I treat Kristeva at such length because she exemplifies a cer­ tain Romanticism pervasive in modern critical theory. This Ro­ manticism admits that Plato' s description of poetry as antisocial  is correct, but it embraces rather than banishes poetic language  as the only hope for an ethical existence. Literature and society  oppose each other, and the literary critic decides to stand with  the marginal forces of literature. Literature comes to represent  the last avatar of freedom within a vision that imagines human  society as gruesomely totalitarian. Linguistic pluralism is Ro­ mantic because it bases its hopes on the inability of society to  absorb the heterogeneity and irrationality of language. In this  view, poetic language may sometimes be allied with cultural  violence because its codings influence human behavior, but its  properly contradictory nature also means that literature may  take itself as its own object, turning upon itself to explode its  repressive potential and to quench its own violence.  Linguistic pluralism assumes the fundamentally polysemic  and ambiguous nature of language. With the New Criticism,  poetry was understood as a symbol of freedom because its ironic  and paradoxical nature could not be paraphrased by ordinary  (social) language. W. K. Wimsat't s  "Poetry and Morals, "  for  example, concludes that one cannot really refute Plato because  "a moral code must be by its nature too rigid to accommodate, or  at least too rigid to account for or specifically sanction, the wide­ ly heterogeneous concreteness of the world' s recognized poet­ ry" (89.) 15 The New Critical defense of poetry explicitly inverts  Plato' s values by embracing literature' s chaotic nature as repre- "morality" as the laws of conduct and "ethics" as the practices of the self. His  preference for the latter over the former preserves the taste for transgression and  Romantic individuality so fervent in his earliest writings. For an extended dis­ cussion of Foucault and Romantic marginality, see my The Romantic Fantastic  (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1984) .  15 .  W. K. Wimsatt, "Poetry and Morals," The Verbal Icon (Lexington:  Univer­ sity of Kentucky Press, 1954), pp. 85-102.  </page> <page sequence="22"> Ethical Criticism 35  sentative of its autonomy. "What Plato saw as the evil of poet­ ry," Wimsatt explains, "the mixture of its emotions and the con­ fusion of its advice, has become now, under such names as  ironic 'tension' and 'synaesthesis', the richness of aesthetic val­ ue" (91) .  Poststructuralism similarly asserts that the self-reflex­ ive quality of language maximizes free play, describing linguistic  structure in terms of its differential nature or its capacity to give  insight into blindness. The popular deconstructive term "dif­ ferance" allows no exclusive form of judgment because it both  negates itself and permits an expansive and uncontainable dis­ semination of meaning. Whereas Plato associated poetry with  the discovery of inconsistency and strife, modern criticism ap­ praises poetry as good only if it presents the reader with para­ doxes, negativities, and ironies.  If ethical theory has traditionally struggled to pass judgments  and make decisions, the new ethical criticism differs by sus­ pending judgment and embracing all interpretations, however  contradictory. Thus Northrop Frye, in "Ethical Criticism," the  second essay of Anatomy of Criticism, defines ethical criticism as  the commitment to plurality in interpretation:  The principle of manifold or "polysemous" meaning, as Dante  calls it, is not a theory any more, still less an exploded supersti­ tion, but an established fact. The thing that has established it is  the simultaneous development of several different schools of  modern criticism, each making a distinctive choice of symbols in  its analysis . The modern student of critical theory is faced with a  body of rhetoricians who speak of texture and frontal assaults,  with students of history who deal with traditions and sources,  with critics using material from psychology and anthropology,  with Aristotelians, Coleridgians, Thomists, Freudians, Jungians,  Marxists, with students of myth, rituals, archetypes, metaphors,  ambiguities, and significant forms. The student must either admit  the principle of polysemous meaning, or choose one of these  groups and then try to prove that all the others are less legitimate.  The former is the way of scholarship, and leads to the advance­ ment of learning; the latter is the way of pedantry, and gives us a  wide choice of goals, the most conspicuous today being fantasti­ cal learning, or myth criticism, contentious learning, or historical  criticism and delicate learning, or "new" criticism. (72)16  16. Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism (Princeton: At the University Press, 1957) .  </page> <page sequence="23"> 36 The Ethics of Criticism  Frye's political and ethical motives are oblique, to say the  least. He castigates the opponents of his "ethical criticism" not  as enemies of the open society, as I&lt;risteva does, but as academ­ ic pedants. Nevertheless, Frye's commitment to interpretive  pluralism and poetic autonomy has its roots in a social context .  Equating ethics with judgment rather than with pluralism risks  Plato's cultural repression and violence . "As soon as we make  culture a definite image of a future and perhaps attainable so­ ciety," Frye writes, "we start selecting and purging a tradition,  and all the artists who don't fit (an increasing number as the  process goes on) have to be thrown out. So, just as historical  criticism uncorrected relates culture only to the past, ethical crit­ icism uncorrected relates culture only to the future, to the ideal  society which may eventually come if we take sufficient pains to  guard the educating of our youth" (346) . Literature fights repres­ sive regimes by freeing the imagination and making a liberal  education possible . This is in itself ethical, according to Frye:  "The ethical purpose of a liberal education is to liberate, which  can only mean to make one capable of conceiving society as free,  classless, and urbane. No such society exists, which is one rea­ son why a liberal education must be deeply concerned with  works of the imagination. The imaginative element in works of  art, again, lifts them dear of the bondage of history" (347) .   I do not want to dispute Frye's contention that the purpose of  a liberal education is to liberate . What is disturbing about Frye's  embrace of linguistic pluralism is the implication that judgment  by definition cannot be ethical . The modern view of ethics tends  to translate freedom of choice into freedom from choice, as if  suspending judgment places one on the side of a higher morali­ ty and liberates one from the chains of social existence . If litera­ ture exists solely above the clash of the world, it has no value for  the human race . A freedom defined apart from social reality, as  purely literary, cannot be the model for freedom within society.  One might even venture to suggest that it cannot be under­ stood.  Not surprisingly, the problem of incomprehensibility has be­ come part of the ethics of criticism. That language and literature  are baffling is now commonly assumed by critical theory . Their  </page> <page sequence="24"> Ethical Criticism 37  incomprehensibility is  necessary to  the desire to  separate art  from the everyday world, to promulgate, apparently against  Platonism, the Platonic gesture itsel.f  No single theorist can be  singled out as the unique proponent of this view. In this sense,  none of the poststructuralists is origina.l  The major figures  rarely use the word "ethical, " no doubt for fear of being unethi­ cal, and they usually do not make the association between the  undecidable nature of language and ethical motivations. When  critics do refer to ethics, it is almost a foregone conclusion that  they mean some form of linguistic pluralism.  J. Hillis Miller' s  "The Ethics of Reading" is a good case in  poin.t 17 Miller represents the mainstream view of deconstruc­ tion in America, and he is not embarrassed to make its ethical  assumptions clea.r  As Kristeva does, he opposes his ethics to  the one that values truth. To dream of unification in matters of  truth is hopeless, and neither humanism nor the nihilistic chal­ lenge to the value of humanity proceeds ethically when one  insists on its own truth to the exclusion of the othe'r s. Rather,  17. J. Hillis Miller, "The Ethics of Reading," in American Criticism, ed. Konigsberg, pp. 19-41 .  In this context, I also recommend the "Limits of Plural­ ism Debate" among Wayne C. Booth, M. H. Abrams, and Miller in the pages of  Critical Inquiry 3 . 3  (1977), even though none of the participants really venture  beyond the linguistic definition of pluralism. Miller's position remains similar to  that in "The Ethics of Reading." Abrams's essay is essentially an attack on  deconstruction and its claims to infallibility. Booth argues that the limits of  pluralism are plural and focuses on the core of agreement shared in textual  interpretation. More recently, however, Booth has turned explicitly to the study  of ethical criticism. He stresses in particular the ethical motivations hidden in the  "professedly anti-ethical and apolitical stances of modem aesthetic movements"  and criticizes their attempts to forego judgment (49). See "Freedom of Interpre­ tation: Bakhtin and the Challenge of Feminist Criticism," Critical Inquiry 9 (1982) :  45-76.  For a special contribution to the debate over linguistic pluralism, see Rene  Girard's "Violence and Representation in the Mythical Text," To Double Business  Bound (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1978), pp. 178-98. Girard  argues that not all texts can be interpreted pluralistically and proposes as an  example what he calls the "texts of persecution," or documents of scapegoating,  such as texts of medieval anti-Semitism, written from the perspective of the  persecutors. According to Girard, linguistic pluralism and autonomy here suc­ cumb to morality, for "even the most rabid exponents of a textuality detached  from any referent and entirely closed upon itself will relent when confronted  with the texts of persecution. They will not only confess that a referent is in  order, but they will identify that referent if asked to do so" (193) .  </page> <page sequence="25"> 38 The Ethics of Criticism  Miller argues that ethics must be modeled after epistemology  and the fact that meaning is pluralistic and self-contradictory.  Following Paul de Man, Miller insists that the most distinctive  property of language is its tendency to unravel itself. The ethical  stand par excellence, therefore, is to subject oneself to the words  on the page and follow their example . The ethics of reading  requires that readers make no decision to support any specific  interpretation but that they allow the paradoxical and undecid­ able character of textuality to shape and coerce them. The neces­ sity of this coercion obeys what Miller calls, after de Man, the  linguistic imperative: "Es ereignet sich aber das Wahre," or "What is  true is what is bound to take place" (41 ) .  If the linguistic impera­ tive permits any truth, it consists in the requirement that read­ ing "go against the grain of what one would want to happen in  the name of what has to happen" (41 ) .  "The ethics of reading,"  Miller concludes, "is the moral necessity to submit in one way or  another, whatever one says, to the truth of this linguistic imper­ ative" (41 ) .   Miller's belief that the ethics of  reading consists in  the necessi­ ty of submitting to linguistic structure does not permit a great  deal of freedom for literary critics .  Indeed, it places them in  what he calls the "cage of language . "  The formulation calls to  mind a series of equally troublesome ideas.  One thinks of  Hegel's reproach against Kant that he subjected the "is" to the  "ought," revealing to what degree the aesthetics of the third  Critique relies on morality. Hegel's preference for the "is" or  "what is bound to take place" made it easy for him to become  the philosopher of Frederick William's Prussian absolutism. Mil­ ler's devotion to necessity also summons Aristotle's view of the  teleology of character-that one can become only what one is­ an idea that meant in terms of Greek society that slaves must  remain slaves, and aristocrats, aristocrats . Finally, does not Mil­ ler's idea of necessity invoke what Freud also called "Necessity, "  that is, Ananke, the inescapable imperative ohfu man violence  and death?  I do not want to suggest that Miller supports totalitarianism. I  have already stressed, perhaps excessively, that linguistic plu­ ralism evolves as an ethical response to the perception that so- </page> <page sequence="26"> Ethical Criticism 39  cial language is  repressive and violent. My point remains, how­ ever, that the creation of an isolated linguistic morality robs  ethical theory of its social context and renders ethics ineffectual .  Linguistic undecidability really amounts to a Romantic strategy  designed to confront what is perceived to be the differentiating  capacity of literature and language. It tries to turn a dangerous  element into one that is self-reflexive and self-destructive in the  hope that what is violent and threatening in language will  defuse itself without any effort on our part. That language is  necessarily ethical merely because it does not permit judgments  (that it defers differences) is an idea whose absurdity will be­ come increasingly apparent as time goes by. What the propo­ nents of this view really desire is to return to primal chaos, to  some pure state of nature, where men and women are mutes,  and language does not exist to impose order or to corrupt. But  the theorists of linguistic pluralism will never be free. Language  has become their ruler, and they enslave themselves to it, mak­ ing it their prison keeper and giving it powers in theory that  mean their destruction in practice . They resemble the communi­ ty of frogs in the fairy tale who regret having made the stork  their master, after it becomes apparent that the bird is interested  in dining on them rather than with them.  Pluralism may be applied through language, but it cannot  have value solely as a linguistic category. If pluralism were de­ fined in society the way literary critics define it, society as we  know it would die . The judicial system would simply collapse in  indecision, and every element abhorred by society would rise to  power. As Kant understood, pluralism can have no value out­ side of an anthropological context.  Society can be a dangerous domain, as Romanticism has nev­ er tired of repeating, but man is and will no doubt remain a  social animal . Moral philosophy as a result has been concerned  throughout its history with purging from the borders of the city  the disorder and violence that the city was born to contain . The  process has not been necessarily just or simple . The philosophi­ cal tradition in particular has tended to occult how unsteady the  progress of ethical ideas has been from their earliest concerns to  the latest. In the earliest times, cultural forms were not rigidly  </page> <page sequence="27"> 40 The Ethics of Criticism  associated with violence, as they were by Romanticism, but  were described as a response to violence . The first meaning of  "virtue" in Homer, for example, refers to performance in battle  to preserve one's society. This is why Achilles' refusal to enter  the Trojan War is such a radical act; and the Iliad traces as its plot  the efforts of the Greeks to restore peace to their ranks so that  they may defeat their enemies .  In the end, Greek victory is  assured only by redirecting Achilles' wrath against Agamemnon  toward Hector, thereby restoring the difference between the  inside and the outside and permitting the Greeks to have an  enemy once more .  Ethics in modern culture is more political, however, in the  sense that it is concerned more with the justice of its own civility  than with the morality of its enemies .  Romantic ethics created  this focus .  The Romantics formulated the problems of social  existence in terms of civilization and its discontents, and they  belong to the modern phase of ethics insofar as only modern  culture has the time to examine its own inadequacies and in­ justices.  That modern culture remains discontent with itself is,  ethically speaking, its most redeeming feature .  The modern emphasis on undecidability could no doubt be  traced to such impulses, and liberal education has implicitly  accepted the task. Because liberal education, as Frye remarks, is  concerned with liberation, it chooses to look at the crisis of eth­ ics from an inside view. It enters into crisis as a means of under­ standing it. Yet the project casts aspersions on the humanities .   That the liberal arts are in  crisis represents a serious threat to  the  humanists' claim that they make a contribution to modern life  and education. The inability to make decisions, for example,  marks literary studies as a soft discipline in an age that demands  hard facts, and opinion increasingly gathers that the liberal arts  have fallen behind the times .  But the human sciences are not  obsolete . That criticism is in crisis signals not that it is behind the  times but that it has entered an advanced stage in the ethical  concern with social violence . The present crisis in literary crit­ icism reflects the tendency of modern ethics to turn its focus  inward to the interpretation of its own laws and the nature of  interpretation as such. In fact, it represents a characteristically  </page> <page sequence="28"> Ethical Criticism 41  modern impulse, for modern culture may be defined as a period  of anxious concern over its own arbitrariness, that is, over its  tendency to control violence arbitrarily in the manner of vio­ lence itsel.f  It follows, incidentally, that the modern theory of  the arbitrariness of the sign is not generally responsible for plac­ ing critical language in doub.t  The theory became possible only  because modern thought is preoccupied with arbitrariness as  the method of violence. is Modern literary critics are almost unanimous in the belief that  the act of decision is violen.t  They understand that decision, like  criticism, requires that a cut be made. But decision is not immor­ al by definition, and ethical theory is hardly served by rejecting  the responsibility for making judgments. Indeed, the essential  principles of ethics cannot be preserved without the capacity to  make decisions. Totalitarianism abolishes as its first step toward  power the right to judge for onesel.f  The totalitarian state under­ stands only too well that freedom and decision are inextricably  bound to each othe.r   Similarly, literary criticism cannot endure without the free­ dom to make judgments, and modern theory urgently needs to  regain the capacity to decide. Criticism requires the right to  judge in favor of a single interpretation in order that many inter­ pretations may exis.t  Begin by rejecting all interpretation, and  one ends by accepting any interpretation. As it stands, modern  criticism has lost its sense of purpose. Perhaps its greatest failing  has been its refusal to judge the difference between literature  and life, for this activity is the definitive characteristic of crit- 18. By "arbitrariness of the sign," I refer to the modern idea that the corre­ spondence between sign and object is wholly arbitrary and motivated only by  convention. That language is arbitrary is certainly an ancient idea: it may be  found at least as early as Plato's Cratylus . Nevertheless, in every case, the doc­ trine of arbitrariness is compromised by some transcendental guarantee that  language will refer despite its arbitrariness. Michel Foucault follows this tenden­ cy historically in The Order of Things (New York: Vintage, 1973), demonstrating to  what extent most theories of the sign depend on metaphysical assumptions. The  modern discourse of arbitrariness, however, is much more radical in its views.  Only use establishes guarantees against arbitrariness, and when human use  becomes subordinated to linguistic laws, as it is in modern criticism, use is not a  strong guarantee. The gap between sign and object yawns, as language becomes  more autonomous.  </page> <page sequence="29"> 42 The Ethics of Criticism  icism. Entering into the conflict between life and literature does  not necessarily mean dividing them. Literary criticism best  evolves by installing itself in the space between literature and  life not to hold them apart, but to bridge the gap. The conflicts  that arise between life and literature, and between rival interpre­ tations, comprise the dialogue in which it is the business of  criticism to engage. Criticism properly understood means an  end to the Platonic and Romantic belief in the marginality of  literature, for it accepts the task of examining to what extent  literature and life contribute to the nature and knowledge of  each other.  Criticism cannot endure by keeping one eye nervously on  society while continuing to focus on the autonomy of its pur­ suits and language. The critical desire to free literature from  ethics is an ethical gesture that must fail if it is to succeed.  Criticism needs rather to admit its role as a mediator between  life and literature and to accept the ethical responsibilities of its  judgments in both domains. Once the task has been accepted,  ethics and criticism can no longer be divided. Literature cannot  be free in an immoral climate, for ethical principles guarantee  the freedom of literary expression. Nor can ethics develop or  maintain itself without the creative spirit of literature. Ethics and  criticism are inseparable. At its best, literary criticism is always  ethical, and the best form of ethics is relentlessly critical .  For the critics who fear that all criticism is violent, the attempt  to restore decision to literary theory will be seen as a restrictive  and aggressive projec.t  Those who decide to defer judgment,  however, can escape neither the hypocritical pretense of indeci­ sion nor the ethical injustices of their choices. Nor can criticism  be stripped of its teeth by proclaiming that theory is really litera­ ture, for literature is hardly free of violence and ethical deci­ sions. Literature merely sublimates its judgments and aggres­ sion in plot and characterization. Kierkegaard said that the  instant of decision is madness. He was referring to the choice  between ethics and aesthetics, and no doubt he understood that  the decision itself is ethical as only decision can be. The crisis of  criticism belongs to the nature of this decision, and criticism  </page> <page sequence="30"> Ethical Criticism 43  cannot exist without i.t  The inescapable fact remains that crit­ icism always makes decisions, if it is criticism, and therein lies  its monstrous character for an age that views the instant of deci­ sion as madness.  </page> </plain_text>
