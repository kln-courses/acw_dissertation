<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Misprision of Vision: A Comparison of Stephen s Heaven and Hell in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man Deborah Pope Duke University Joyce commonly uses the language of spirituality and conventional theology to expand and redirect the nature of the emotional intensity occasioned by a secular epiphany. For example, Stephen's initial en counter with the prostitute and his later trembling submission to com munion generate identical feelings of response, the irony of which goes unrecognized by him. In turn, his religious epiphanies are con sistently turned to secular uses. Thus, the masochistic series of physical and sensual mortifications he deliberately undergoes in a burst of fervid religiosity only serve to subtilize and extend the very senses they are designed to subdue. Rather than accentuate the ascetic, they further Stephen's apprenticeship as an artist. The inter penetrability of the religious and secular clearly broadens the thematic level and resonance of particular passages thus connected. The two sections detailing Stephen's personal visions of hell ?his lurid hallucinations following the retreat sermon ?and of heaven ?his beatific encounter with the bird-girl ? exemplify such a linkage. As the two most dramatically personal, imaginative occasions in A Portrait, these passages significantly correspond in structure, terminology, and portent, to a greater extent than has been previously pointed out. Their alignment bears on the continuing question of the degree of irony intended in Stephen's closing affirmation of the artistic life. Stephen's metaphoric descent into hell, like his ascent into an aesthetic heaven, is private, uniquely vouchsafed him by a higher power. Roused by the retreat sermon to intensities of fear and self revulsion, he is driven to extravagantly hallucinate out of his surfeited sense of guilt. Escaping to his room, he is reluctant to cross the threshold, dreading what reproach or terror awaits: He halted on the landing before the door and then, grasping the porcelain knob, 263</page><page sequence="2">opened the door quickly. He waited in fear, his soul pining within him, praying silently that death might not touch his brow as he passed over the threshold . . . He waited still at the threshold as at the entrance to some dark cave (P 136). A similar, though muted, sensation of fear comes over Stephen along the seawall: "A faint click at his heart, a faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his flesh dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea: yet he did not strike across the downs on his left but held straight on along the spine of rocks" (P 167). An integral part of this fear and disinclination is the auxiliary sense each time of a symbolic crossing being made, a transit between two worlds, marked in the first passage by the threshold of his room; in the second, this is the "thin wooden bridge," "the trembling bridge," over which he must pass. Further inhibiting factors present themselves in the incessant murmuring of voices and the vigilant eyes. As he enters the room, to Stephen's over-charged mind, Faces were there; eyes: they waited and watched. ?We knew perfectly well of course that although it was bound to come to the light he would find consider able difficulty in endeavouring to try . . Murmuring faces waited and watched; murmurous voices filled the dark shell of the cave . . He told himself calmly that those words had absolutely no sense which had seemed to rise murmurously from the dark" (P 136). The unnerving conviction Stephen has of being scrutinized and smugly commented upon returns in the later passage in the disquieting presence of Ennis, Shuley, and Connolly: A voice from beyond the world was calling. ? Hello, Stephanos! ? Here comes The Dedalus! ? Come along, Dedalus! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous Stephaneforos! . He recognised their speech collectively before he distinguished their faces. The mere sight of that medley of wet nakedness chilled him to the bone (P 167-68). The boys' vaguely threatening, disruptive background of senseless noise and dislocation, like the voices in the room, tends to jargonistic bombast. Both function as an ironic, choric commentary; formal and remote, the voices condescend to Stephen, talking of him rather than to him. They are symptomatic of the insufficiency and casual malevolency of the world outside Stephen: one is like the winding, convoluted prose of the Jesuitical schoolmen; the other, the comic reduction of classical training. As Stephen strives to maintain some mental order, a wave of soul weariness suffuses his body. This stage ?a prerequisite for the 264</page><page sequence="3">regenerative vision to occur ? amounts to a state of despair, a spiritual condition connected in each case to the physical sensation of chill and fatigue. Thus, prior to the vision of hell, "His hands were cold and damp and his limbs ached with chill. Bodily unrest and chill and weariness beset him, routing his thoughts" (P 136). Similarly, upon nearing the place where the bird-girl will appear, though the day had been hitherto pleasant, At that instant, as it seemed to him, the air was chilled and looking askance towards the water he saw a flying squall darkening and crisping suddenly the tide. . Like a scene on some vague arras, old as man's weariness, the image of the seventh city of Christendom was visible to him across the timeless air, no older nor more weary nor less patient of subjection than in the days of the thingmote. Disheartened, he raised his eyes towards the slowdrifting clouds (P 167). In both instances confusion and agitation succeed this numbness, op pressing his consciousness and throwing his thoughts into chaos: To be alone with his soul, to examine his conscience, to meet his sins face to face, to recall their times and manners and circumstances, to weep over them. He could not weep. He could not summon them to his memory. He felt only an ache of soul and body, his whole being, memory, will, understanding, flesh, be numbed and weary (P 136). He heard a confused music within him as of memories and names which he was almost conscious of but could not capture even for an instant; then the music seemed to recede, to recede, to recede (P 167). Operative as well in each privileged circumstance is the proclivity to pride Stephen feels in his secret sensual life. Thus, all the while he is abasing himself for the sordidness of his sexual initiations, there is an unmistakable undercurrent of superiority and personal distinction in the tone of his thoughts: Could it be that he, Stephen Dedalus, had done those things? His conscience sighed in answer. Yes, he had done them, secretly, filthily, time after time, and, hardened in sinful impenitence, he had dared to wear the mask of holiness before the tabernacle itself How came it that God had not struck him dead? (P137). A corresponding pride deflects the taunts of the clamorous schoolboys: It was a pain to see them and a swordlike pain to see the signs of adolescence that made repellent their pitiable nakedness. Perhaps they had taken refuge in number and noise from the secret dread in their souls. But he, apart from them and in silence, remembered in what dread he stood of the mystery of his own body. . . Their banter was not new to him and now it flattered his mild proud sovereignty (P 168). 265</page><page sequence="4">Not the least of the parallels is the surprising resemblance of land scape, first evident in the curious quality of light and foulish air: A faint marshhght struggled upwards from all the ordure through the bristling greygreen weeds An evil smell, faint and foul as the light, curled upwards slug gishly out of the canisters A rictus of cruel malignity lit up greyly their old bony faces (P 137) his flesh dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea A veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where the river was embayed1 (P 167) He was alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish waters and the seaharvest of shells and tangle of veiled grey sunlight (P 171) The preponderance of grey throughout (a color Stephen hates in Ulysses) qualifies the affirmations he egotistically assumes he has reached by its recurrent suggestion of age, wastage, failure; the tan gled weeds and growth, the barrenness of both landscapes, implicate the potential limitation in each plateau. In both instances, the immediate impetus to Stephen's extreme psychic state ? the horrific sermon on the one hand; the decision to re ject the priesthood on the other? weighs heavily on his mind, resulting in a strong need for significant compensatory affirmation. Each time he is answered in a mind-shattering vision that draws its transforming intensity from a simultaneous surfeit with the direction of his life to that point. Stephen's hitherto fleshly life is adjured in the first instance, his purely religious life in the second. Just as his ortho dox part had earlier been propelled forward with unwonted zeal and conviction, so the aesthetic yearning of his nature is concentrated and sent soaring in a new birth of meaning through his epiphany on the seawall. Of the principals in these scenes, both the girl in the water and the goats in the field can be regarded as products of Stephen's imagina tion, the latter explicitly, the former implicitly, heavily endowed as she is with the promptings of his aesthetic and spiritual longing. Both are transformed into peculiarly representative objective correlatives of his consciousness, signaling the apparent end of one mental direction, while suggesting the new. Therefore each has significant dividends for the evolving artistic nature of Stephen. The bird-girl's effect hardly needs elucidation, but the excremental landscape of hell is nonetheless important as part of an accruing pattern of scatological references that serve as impetus to, and comment upon, this developing aesthetic awareness.2 Additionally, the principals move in a characteristically trance-like manner, circling in upon Stephen's highly suggestible imagination. Their identical, hypnotic pattern of movement is em 266</page><page sequence="5">phatically reinforced by the repetition of the same phrase three times in each passage: creatures were moving in the field, hither and thither they moved hither and thither, trailing their long tails behind them they swished in slow circles round and round in the field, winding hither and thither They moved in slow circles, circling closer and closer to enclose, to enclose, soft language issuing from their lips (P 137-38) she suffered his gaze gently stirring the water with her foot hither and thither The first faint noise of gently moving water broke the silence, low and faint and whispering, faint as the bells of sleep, hither and thither, hither and thither and a faint flame trembled on her cheek (P 171) When Stephen cries out, "Help!" as the goats move, and "Heavenly God!" as the girl stirs, in a sense the cries are reversed. More appropri ately speaking, it is a "Heavenly God" whom the hell-vision affirms, while it is a truer "help" that the mortal beauty affords him. The prayer Stephen utters after the goatish hell is, in effect, a plea the wading girl answers. In that early fervent address to the Virgin, she is the figure "with a creature's comeliness and lustre suited to our state" whose "very face and form, dear mother, speak to us of the Eternal telling of Heaven and infusing peace" (P138-39). Through this invoca tion, the figure of Mary is introduced into the vision, offering redemp tion, as her counterpart on the sea-strand similarly offers Stephen new life. Yet, through the scrupulous repetition of "hither and thither," even to the number of times it occurs, Joyce has undeniably linked the girl with the goats as well. What happens is that the symbolic function of the goats divides: their importance for aesthetic development, and as indicators of natural, ineradicable drives, is taken over by the girl, while their more exaggerated representation of Stephen's still am bivalent sexual maturity is taken over by the scampering boys.3 The girl on the strand, that marvelous compaction of the promptings of Stephen's ways and days, is beautifully, ironically, in one supreme stroke, both Virgin and goat. She is indeed the reconciling angel of life, the apotheosis of carnal and spiritual, here for the first time in Stephen's mind in graceful balance. Yet just as significantly the balance is not presented here as a final achievement, but only a prom ise, since the guilty waverings in his mind are still not laid to rest, as evidenced by the other half of the goaty analogues. The affronting aspects of the goats emerge in Stephen's embarrassed, peculiarly of fended, reaction to the boys' nakedness and assertive physicality. They discomfit him as reminders of his baser nature; as they clamber about the rocks, 267</page><page sequence="6">The mere sight of that medley of wet nakedness chilled him to the bone. Their bodies, corpsewhite or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the suns, gleamed with the wet of the sea and drenched with cold brine was their matted hair (P 168). "[A] swordlike pain" runs through Stephen "to see the signs of adolescence that made repellent their pitiable nakedness." Like the goats, the boys prompt Stephen's awareness of "in what dread he stood of the mystery of his own body." Even their taunts are reminders of his animal side. While the goats presage a prayer to an orthodox Mary, the boys presage the actual vision of one Mary-like ? her aesthetic double. Nor is this to lose sight of the ironic diminution going on in each case; the capering trio undercut Stephen's conceit of voices from another world as, in a curiously similar way, the goats undercut his spiritual groveling by adumbrating the senses, the desires, the tenacious life that will undermine finally his pretense to orthodoxy. The carnality inherent, by implication and detail, in the vision of the wading girl will continue to disconcert Stephen as the sexual contradictions in the passage indicate. That these contradic tions go unrecognized by the young artist indicates the presence of Joyce's irony. Finally each experience culminates in food imagery ?the commu nion which spiritually concludes the return from hell, and the plate of sausages he anticipates with the relish of the reborn; and the loathesome, scatological scraps which follow the sea epiphany: He drained his third cup of watery tea to the dregs and set to chewing the crusts of fried bread that were scattered near him, staring into the dark pool of the jar. The yellow dripping had been scooped out like a boghole and the pool under it brought back to his memory the dark turfcolored water of the bath in Clongowes (P174). How strange that the quintessential excremental hallucination (hell) is resolved by communion, while the extreme of aesthetic revelation is followed with excrement. Surely it is not a coincidence in the early part of Ulysses when Stephen urinates along the seawall that reminds him of the bird-girl (1/49). In summary, the hell and heaven visions are remarkably parallel. In general this is seen in the mood of fear, disinclination for the unknown, the symbolic crossing, the presence of ominous voices and ambivalent scrutiny, the state of despair and subsequent transforma tion; explicitly the parallels are there in the grey illumination, the wasteland landscape, the identical phrasings, the hypnotic enclosure, a "communion." Moreover, each is a fundamental watershed, an in tensely directive epiphanal moment initiating stages which will have a 268</page><page sequence="7">dominant shaping power over Stephen's emergent consciousness ? the life of the Church, the life of the artist. In subsuming and culminating the "old" life, each provides impetus and reassurance towards the new dispensation, the "new" life. Thus, ascending from hell he exults: "Till that moment he had not known how beautiful and peaceful life could be. . . . How simple and beautiful was life after all! And all life lay before him" (P 146). And in the second passage, with the same serene conviction, "On and on and on and on he strode, far out over the sands, singing wildly to the sea, crying to greet the advent of the life that had cried to him.... A wild angel had appeared to him... an envoy from the fair courts of life" (P 172). Twice a new life, a new purpose, has burst upon Stephen's mind with amazing distinction. Twice the polarities of secular and spiritual, aesthetic and religious, apparently claim his fervent dedication. Yet the distinctions are never clear, the boundaries only tokenly observed in a ceaseless meshing of artistic and orthodox sensibilities that seem finally to be in the service of an incontrovertible irony, causing a per suasive qualification in the assessments given the experiences by Stephen himself. Just as the hell-vision impels him in a direction that proves ultimately false, a kind of religious cul-de-sac cloth, so its linkage with the later scene in the ways described compels us to forecast inevitable revisions in the particular direction Stephen em braces through the girl. It is a glorious promise, but not finally suffi cient or complete. Both visions are traps, each something more and something less than Stephen would have them ?hell less patently orthodox and more rich in its way for the artistic consciousness; the bird-girl perhaps more the Virgin of the nets he so desperately longs to fly by ?setting the stage for the deflected, bedevilled artist of Ulysses. NOTES *Cf. "He found in the end that the only odour against which his sense of smell revolted was a certain stale fishy stink like that of longstanding urine" (P 151). 2It is important to an understanding of the aesthetic significance of the hell hallucina tion to recall the aesthetic significance of earlier excremental references. The first occurs on the opening page when Stephen wets his bed: "first it is warm and then it gets cold. His mother put on the oilsheet. That had the queer smell." Out of the "holes in oblivion," as Hugh Kenner calls Stephen's earliest recollections, comes the rudimentary discrimina tion of the senses, which will become so crucial to the artist. Kenner further contends, "Throughout Joyce's work the senses are symbolically disposed. Smell is the means of discriminating empirical realities" ("The Portrait in Perspective," from Kenners Dublin's Joyce, rpt. in Joyce: A Collection of Critical Essays, ed. William M. Chace [Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1974], pp. 33-34). The next occurrence comes during 269</page><page sequence="8">Stephens first look at the foul cattle yard at Stradbrook, having previously only seen cows against the bucolic background of pastures. The sight sickens and revolts him now with its "foul green puddles and clots of liquid dung." Joyce tellingly places Stephen's disillusionment immediately after his full-blown, inflated romantic identification with the Count of Monte Cristo, This early identification with a highly sentimentalized, unreal view of the world must be discarded as one more artistic dead-end, just as the deceptively arcadian conception of the cows must be bluntly reversed by the steaming stockyards. The excrement-fouled enclosure is a trenchant and timely wrench away from the trellised garden of preciosity. Significantly, the third major image of smell and excrement involves Stephen's flight from the personally useless "art" of the humiliating spectacle of the school play. Greatly agitated by the performance and his part in it, Stephen escapes from the hall, seeking reality, running on until he recognizes a soothing odor around him: "That is horse piss and rotted straw, he thought. It is a good odour to breathe. It will calm my heart. My heart is quite calm now. I will go back" (P86). Thus, in their peculiar, nightmarish way, the excremental surroundings of hell have positive links with other images of aesthetic importance to the emerging artist, particularly to the degree they epitomize an irreducible, impersonal reality. Indeed the topography of hell strongly parallels the Stradbrook yard, while the mortifications which follow the vision result in practical sensory discrimination. 3In the original, separately written epiphany which describes this hellish scene (in Robert Scholes and Richard Kain, The Workshop of Daedalus [Evanston: Northwestern Univ. Press, 1965]), Joyce is clear on the fact that the creatures are anthropomorphic in nature, "confused forms, half-men, half goats." This becomes the "human faces" of the later Portrait version, both accounts retaining the physical detail "lightly bearded." It is not too much to suggest that this gives the creatures connotations of adolescence in the hallucination (which is, of course, fueled by adolescent sexual confusion) and it is not unlikely that the schoolboys in the later scene pick up these resonances. Furthermore, "grey as india rubber," the color of the human-goats, suggests very much the same pallid tones as "their bodies, corpsewhite or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the suns, gleamed with the wet of the sea." While the "rawly tanned" seems to be innocuous, even positive, nevertheless to Stephen, the color of the wet boys is clearly urtappealing. 270</page></plain_text>
