DM 22 hardcover. Reviewed by Bernard Gardi This small and richly illustrated book, whose title translates as "Niombo-The Corpse in the Doll. Burial Rituals in Central Africa," was published to accompany the exhibition of the same name at the Rautenstrauch-Joest- Museum in Cologne, Germany (Nov. 30, 1990-May 26, 1991); it was also shown at the Reiss-Museum in Mannheim (Aug. 29-Nov. 17, 1991). The exhibition was conceived in cooperation with an artist, who remained anonymous, who owns several of the anthro- pomorphic funerary images called niombo. As Professor Gisela V61ger, Director of the Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum, explains in her preface, this book inaugurates a new series whose aim is to publish "ethnographical col- lections in the possession of contemporary artists" (p. 7). Sundi, the former northern province of the old kingdom of Kongo, is located in the Republic of Congo. In Sundi province the numerous clans of the Bwende and Bembe held splendid funerals for their important elders. Huge quantities of cloth were used to wrap the body of the deceased elder, result- ing in a vertical anthropomorphic coffin, the niombo, up to three meters tall, further char- acterized by an upraised right arm. The image might incorporate a crudely carved wooden head covered with cloth and be given painted details. This very costly tradi- tion of burying the dead was given up dur- ing the 1930s. Muzidi, smaller anthro- pomorphic figures covered with cloth, 40-60 centimeters in height, survived until the 1960s. Said to contain small parts of the body of the deceased, muzidi are always represent- ed in a seated position. In this book Andrea Reikat aims to present as completely as possible the corpus of all the known niombo and muzidi images outside Africa, along with other objects having a sig- nificant function in burial rituals (introduc- tion, p. 9). The book is divided into five parts. The first four, consisting of eighteen pages of text, can be seen as an introduction to the cat- alogue in part five, which covers more than sixty pages and contains over ninety pho- tographs. Including gourds, drums, and trumpets, almost ninety objects of differing aesthetic quality are published. Most of them come from the important holdings in Sweden, namely from the Etnografiska Museet, Stockholm, and the Etnografiska Museet, Gbteborg. Others are in the Mus&amp;e Royal de l'Afrique Centrale in Tervuren, the Mus(e d'Histoire Naturelle in La Rochelle, or in pri- vate collections. After a general introduction to the geo- graphical, historical, cultural, and sociologi- cal aspects of Sundi province, Reikat condenses the major ethnographical data in part two. Here she stresses the importance of cloth-its role as an indicator of prestige, as currency (i.e., as a means of acquiring titles), or as wealth, pure and simple. Other para- graphs deal with the importance of the ances- tors, the niombo ritual itself, and the musical instruments that accompany it. Ten.highly interesting photographs taken in the field serve as illustrations. In an exemplary way Reikat lists the five kinds of existing sources, namely 1) the published eyewitness reports by Swedish missionaries of the Swedish Covenant Church (today's Svenska Missions- firbundet, or Swedish Missionary Society), including the missionaries Laman, Hammar, Walder, and Ohrneman; 2) engraved gourds depicting different stages of preparing the body and of burial ritual; 3) photographs from the archive of the Svenska Missions- f6rbundet in Stockholm; 4) a film made in 1926/27 by Ohrneman; and 5) published sources later than 1930 but from the same geographical area. The ethnographical data treat the way a corpse is prepared for burial (sometimes it is smoked over a fire for months), the behavior of the mourners, and the burial itself. Here Makoza, the best- known niombo artist of the three first decades of this century, is also introduced. In part three the author describes colors, gestures, signs, and symbols of the niombo and muzidi figures. A short paragraph on anthropomorphic trumpets is included. The fourth and very short part (one page and a photograph) deals with the circumstances under which the images reached European museums and the collections of the Svenska Missionsf6rbundet. The first pieces came to Europe in 1904 and 1906. It is the merit of this book to have brought together this impressive number of niombo and muzidi, most of which are stored in Swedish museums and therefore are inacces- sible to the general public. For those interest- ed in these cloth images, the book will be an interesting reference catalogue. However, several shortcomings must be mentioned. The text is very short and stylistically mixed: in the limited space allotted for text, too many different topics are addressed superfi- cially. Two paragraphs, especially, seem rather out of place. I do not think, for in- stance, that the question of matrilineal descent (or influence) and its relationship to the cloth reliquary mannequins can be treat- ed in less than one page (p. 14). The other paragraph touches on a general and serious problem: male bias in our sources (pp. 17-18). Yet it is at the very least doubtful that observations made by women would really enlarge our sources in a significant way and enable us to say more about the "origin and development of the ritual" (p. 18). A number of points of interest in art his- tory are left open. I would have been inter- ested to know what exactly is inside these images. Especially the smaller of the niombo and muzidi figures could easily have been x- rayed. In addition the book illustrates two big niombo mannequins, 270 and 180 cen- timeters tall. These were clearly made for the Swedish missionaries. Although they are 34</page><page sequence="2">GALERIE n~rll African Tribal Art powerful and magnificent figures, they are replicas. Were there no accessible data in the two Swedish museums stating the circum- stances of manufacture of these two images? If there were none, that fact should have been stated. Another point of criticism has to be made in relation to the twelve splendid field pho- tographs. Seven of them are thrilling, depict- ing six different giant niombo images during funeral celebrations. I consider such pho- tographs to be at least as important as the objects themselves. Therefore, an attempt should have been made to state, if only approximately, the place where the photo- graph was taken and its date. The caption "A female niombo on the way to the grave" (Abb. 20) is not good enough. The author carefully mentions which pieces have already been published, giving sources and dates. Robert Farris Thompson's The Four Moments of the Sun (1981), which includes the most impressive pieces, is of course noted. Here, a rather awkward mis- take has slipped in: Thompson is cited as R. Farris-Thompson, listed under "F" in the bib- liographical index. Reikat is only partly to blame for the shortcomings of the texts. She was given less than ten months to write them, shortly after finishing her M.A. degree (see preface), and she even had to do the lay- out herself. On the technical side, the printing could have been better. On page 45, left and right are reversed. The same photograph is pub- lished correctly (and with better color repro- duction) in Thompson's The Four Moments of the Sun (1981:26). It is tempting to compare the small muzidi images with "dolls," although clearly they are not. The author does not commit this error in her text. That is why the subtitle Der Tote in der Puppe (The Corpse in the Doll) strikes me as strange, as it stresses the extraordinary and exotic. It is even stranger to find it exclusively on the cover, but not on the title page. In German the pronunciation of the two aspired t's and p's is striking, but it also reminds one of colonial anthropology in its false drama. I think this subtitle was chosen to attract the general and undifferenti- ating public. D ATALLERY~? DEROCHE LL.I z o" 35</page></plain_text>
