More than 300 artifacts from the Tem- plo Mayor Museum and the Museo Na- cional de Antropología in Mexico City will be displayed across 40,000 square feet of space that will include a three- story, l/10th-scale model of the Aztec's Great Temple. Titled Aztec: The World of Moctezuma , the exhibition represents the most comprehensive overview of an- cient Aztec society ever mounted by a museum outside of Mexico. The arti- facts shown on these pages offer only a taste of Aztec artistic accomplishments at the height of Tenochtitlán's cultural development five hundred years ago.

Archaeologists sent the hundreds of pottery sherds that had made up the fig- ure to a conservation laboratory for restoration. As conservators worked, an anthropomorphic figure that combined human characteristics with the claws and facial features of a bat began to take shape. Veneration of bats, particularly vampire bats with their predilection for blood, caves and the night sky, is an ancient tradition in the Americas. In Mesoamerica the bat god was most closely affiliated with the Za- potee culture that flourished in the Valley of Oaxaca from about a.d. 100 to 800. How this extraordinary sculpture made in Aztec style (according to Eduardo Matos Moctezuma, director of the Templo Mayor Mu- seum) came to be buried in the Valley of Mexico near the city of Tenochtitlán is as yet not clear. - J.S.D. 46 Archaeology</page><page sequence="6">Hernán Cortés included this map ofTenochtitlán in a letter that he wrote to King Charles V of Spain in which he de- scribed his conquest of the ancient Aztec capital in 1521.

At the edge of a causeway, near the town of Izta- palapa, they had their first view of the great Aztec capital city of Tenochtitlán. "When we saw all those cities and villages built in the water, and other great towns on dry land, and the straight and level causeway leading to Mexico, we were astounded," one of Cortés's soldiers, Bernal Díaz, later wrote in The Conquest of New Spain. "These great towns and temples and buildings rising from the water, all made of stone, seemed like an enchanted vision...." Founded in 1325, Tenochtitlán became a bustling city of some 250,000 people. Artists came there seeking commissions from the nobility. Warriors came to win fame and fortune. Traders carried exotic treasures to its markets. Dignitaries paid visits of state. Priests and pilgrims visited its sacred shrines. Thieves, performers, tourists, and prostitutes filled its busy streets. As the center of the empire, it was eulogized in Cantares Mexi- canos, a collection of Aztec poetry: Proud of itself is the city of Mexico-Tenochtitlán. Here no one fears to die in wat Have this in mind , oh princes , do not forget it. Who could conquer Tenochtitlán? Who could shake the foundations of heaven? Cortés with his soldiers and a massive army of Indian allies laid siege to the city in the spring and summer of 1521. In August, Tenochtitlán fell, a victim not only of military siege but of great plagues of smallpox brought to the Americas by the Spanish. The city was demol- ished and the surrounding lake was drained to facili- tate a European style of agriculture and horse transport. Over its ruins rose Spanish colonial settle- ments and eventually modern Mexico City. Pieces of the ancient city would surface periodically, but for the most part Tenochtitlán remained all but forgotten. Even the whereabouts of its Templo Mayor, or Great Temple, was unknown until its discovery in 1978 a few yards from the National Palace in Mexico City. Subse- quent excavation revealed more than 7,000 artifacts including monumental religious statuary, incense burners, gold jewelry, funerary urns, jade votive masks, and ritual offerings wrought in gold, ceramic, and stone. These treasures are now housed in the Templo Mayor Museum, built adjacent to the ruins. The Den- ver exhibition, which runs from September 26 to Feb- ruary 21, 1993, presents a range of objects from both the Templo Mayor Museum and the Museo Nacional de Antropología. The exhibition takes visitors on a walk through the capital as it might have appeared in the year 1518. Featured are re-creations of an Aztec farm, barrios where craftsmen produced baskets, ob- sidian tools, pottery vessels, and figurines, a market- place, and the Great Temple itself. Finally, images from the 12-volume Florentine Codex , a history of the Aztec people compiled by the Franciscan friar Bernadino de Sahagun, and other texts from Spanish documents address the arrival of Cortés and the last days of Moctezuma and his dazzling capital city. ■ Jank Stkvknson Day is chief curator of the Denver Museum of Natural History.
