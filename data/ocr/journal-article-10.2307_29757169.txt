<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Meaningful Miniature Relief from Pattadakkal by T.S. Thangamuthu The K?si-Visvan?tha temple at Pattadakkal, which lies close to the famous Vir?p?ksa temple to its left, is an important centre of early C?lukyan art and architecture. It depicts a mithuna motif on its plinth section. In the other C?lukyan temples at Aihole, Bad?mi and Alamp?r no such representation is found. The motif illustrates two horses engaged in sexual intercourse. The mare stands facing north while the stallion pounces upon the former in rearing attitude and in coitus. The motif appears on the tripattakumuda part of the adhisthdna. This motif faces the west while on the other side of the corner, facing South, the head of a woman alone is carved (Fig. 1). Being a single carving of its type, it has escaped the attention of scholars and would seem to be of importance, on account of its location and the iconographic programme of the temple. This short article examines the significance of the carving. The horse, noted for swiftness of movement, known to Indian tradition from time immemorial has been adapted to suit the taste of myth-makers and temple-builders. Its ritual value is also famous because of the asvamedha sacrifice that emperors used to perform (*). In Hindu iconography the horse is associated with Visnu as a symbol of the yet to come Kalki avatdra. Visnu in another manifestation of a minor order is said to have appeared as Hayagriva 'the horse-headed, to dislodge the horse-headed demon, also called Hayagriva (Ions 1975: fig. p. 24) (2). Sanjn?, the wife of S?rya (Sun god), is said to have assumed the form of a mare according to the Visnu- and M?rkandeya-pur?nas. It is said that Sanjn? was horrified by the fiery effulgence of S?rya and left his residence for a remote place to live in peace, leaving behind Ch?y?, her personified Shadow. Later, learning of the trick, S?rya went in pursuit of his beloved wife and found her roaming about a lonely place in the form of a mare. In order not to terrify her again with his effulgence, he assumed the shape of a stallion and courted her. As a result of their sexual union the Asvins and Revanta were born to them. The horse headed Asvins became the divine doctors while Revanta had for his vehicle the asva (Sharma 1975: 26-27). The Pattadakkal motif seems to illustrate the erotic dalliance of S?rya and Sanjn? (3), 0 Noted among the aivamedha myths are those of Mah?bali, overcome by Trivikrama, and king Sagara whose attempt at the sacrifice was responsible for the flow of celestial Gahga on earth. K?lid?sa in his M?lavik?gnimitra notes the sacrifice performed by Pusyamitra Sunga. (2) Ions (1975: 24) has identified the figure with Kalki which appears to be not well founded. (3) Murukan (= Skanda) in Tamil tradition has two wives, Devasen? of the Sanskritic school and Valli. Valli is purely an autochthonous goddess, supposed to have been born to a rsi and an antelope. This myth is elaborated in the Kanda-Pur?nam (Skt. Skanda-Pur?nd) of Kacciyappa Civ?c?rya. According [1] 487</page><page sequence="2">^,. ? i. Fig. 1 - Horse mithuna.

An inquisitive scholar could not refrain from posing the question: why is there such a motif at a particular section of the temple? and in reply to the query the inconographic programme of the temple itself offers a clue and solves the riddle. To begin with the mating horses have a ritual connotation. The horse in Indian tradition is a fertility symbol (Iyer 1977: 36-42) (4). Southwest is the direction of Nirutti whose vehicle is an ass, an apology for a horse. So, the horse motif appears at an appropriate place to convey the ritual value of horse-oriented sexual implications, suggesting thereby that the temple is the venue of cosmic creation. To prove this, we may look for other evidence in the main temple itself. K?si-visvan?tha is a small structure when compared with the Vir?p?ksa and Mallik?rjuna temples of Pattadakkal. The garbhagrha houses the Lihga while an image of Som?s-kandam?rti appears on the ceiling in front of the sanctum. Both the themes, the Lihga and Som?skanda, are related to fertility. The Lihga in union with ?vudai or yoni is suggestive of sexual union. What we find in Som?skandam?rti is Siva with Um? and the baby, Skanda. That is to say from the sexual intercouse (cf. K?lid?sa's forceful descriptions in Kum?rasambhava) Kumara or Skanda was born (5). So, it has already been proposed that the garbhagrha in a Hindu temple is the venue of cosmic creation (Kalidos 1991). This may also be the reason why the Lihga and Som?skandam?rti images appear within the sanctum in the Pallava temples at K?ncipuram and M?mallapuram (Kalidos 1988: chap. Ill passim). Among the C?lukyan temples, the K?si-visvan?tha is the only one in which an image of Som?skandam?rti appears (Kalidos 1991a). This, along with the horse motif, enhances the main thesis put forward in this article. That is to say, the sanctum sanctorum in a Hindu temple is the place of cosmic creation. Now, on threading these facts together, the result is that the ritual union of the horses (6) points to the temple as the venue for the symbolic function of cosmic creation (srsti). to this version of the episode, a rsi is said to have cohabited with a gazelle, leading to the birth of Valli. In sculptural form a few rare pieces are found in the temple cars of Tamilnadu, recorded in the pioneering work on the subject by Professor Raju Kalidos (1989: 127-28). Thus we find a rsi in anthropomorphic form engaged in sexual union with an antelope (Kalidos 1986: 77-IS). The presentation in erotic terminology is called bestiality. In a few other illustrations two deer are in sexual union like the horses found on the Pattadakkal temple. The analogy with deer would point to the fact that animals in art need not necessarily be the fanciful creations of sculptors but are based on mythology (Kalidos 1989: 216). (4) Other motifs are illustrated on temple cars in which bestiality is illustrated in another way. In such carvings a stallion is found cohabiting with a woman. This may also refer to the subject of S?rya (in the form of a horse) mating his wife Sanjn? who is anthropomorphic (Fig. 2). Besides the myth, the motif points out the inseminating character of the horse and stands as proof of the fertility symbol. (5) Siva and Um? are supposed to have mated in the form of elephants, leading to the birth of Ganapati, the elephant-headed God of obstacles (Vignesvara). For the myth and its Tamil redaction see Kalidos (1992: chap. I). (6) According to the K?mas?tra (Upadhyaya 1970: 95) the horse is a symbol of sexual virility. Men are classified according to the size of their phalluses (linga). The horse phallus is the biggest type. The other two are bull (medium) and rabbit (small). These are supposed to mate with their equivalent female types: the cow elephant, mare and doe respectively. Now, the three animals (elephant, horse and deer) stand out significantly as symbols of sexual virility. These are associated with sexual dalliance in Hindu mythology (cf. fn. 3, 5) as they are supposed to derive the maximum pleasure during coitus. This may be the reason why puranic heroes assume the form of the said animals so as to attain orgasm at a high pitch.
