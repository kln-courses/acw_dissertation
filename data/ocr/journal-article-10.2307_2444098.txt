BEAMAN3,4 2Herbarium, 209 Rolfs Hall, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 3261 1; and 3Department of Botany and Plant Pathology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824 ABSTRACT The genus Rafflesia includes about 13 species of parasitic flowering plants, among which are the largest known flowers. The flower with subtending scales is the only part of the plant extemal to the host and is produced solitary on roots (rarely stems) of the genus Tetrastigma (Vitaceae). Field studies were made of the pollination process in R. pricei, a species endemic to the Crocker Range in the Malaysian state of Sabah (northem Bomeo). Pollination is mediated by carrion (bluebottle) flies of the genera Lucilia and Chrysomya. Experimental data indicate that both visual and olfactory cues are important in attracting flies to flowers. Flies (mostly female L. papuensis) obtain loads of the viscous liquid pollen matrix by visiting male flowers and entering anther grooves on the central column of the flower, precisely guided by ridges armed with hairs that force the fly into a position in which the pollen is positioned on the dorsal part of the thorax. "Windows" on the inside of the perigone diaphragm apparently help orient their flight inside flowers. Pollen-loaded flies visiting female flowers may enter the infradiscoidal sulcus formed by a broad ring of stigmatic tissue above and the expanded base of the column below. On entering the sulcus the fly is wedged in so tightly that pollen is rubbed off the thorax onto the stigma. Only large flies could be effective in picking up pollen from male flowers and transferring it to female flowers. The pollination syndrome is sapromyophily, in which the flower closely parallels trap flowers of several other plant families, although it is not a trap. The flower provides no reward for pollinators but deceives them by an apparent offering of food and possibly brood place. Rafflesia plants are extremely rare, perhaps in part because of infre- quency of pollination, which requires neighboring male and female flowers simultaneously in bloom. THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN GENUS Rafflesia in- cludes about 13 species parasitic on Tetrastig- ma (Vitaceae). Enormous flower size of some species and extreme rarity of all members of the genus have long attracted attention of sci- entists and laymen. Knowledge of the biology of the genus nevertheless has been slow to ac- cumulate. Carrion flies were correctly recog- nized as the pollinators when the first species was discovered (Brown, 1821), but the actual mechanism of pollination is only. now being more fully elucidated. Details of seed dispersal are still unknown (Kuijt, 1969; Meijer, 1985) as is degree of host specificity. Three species I Received for publication 26 May 1987; revision ac- cepted 4 November 1987.

Rafflesia species are threatened with extinction mainly by habitat destruction; at least two species may already be extinct (Mei- jer, 1985). The present study raises more questions than it answers, but such has been the history of investigation into the biology of the genus. Principal research barriers are 1) rarity and remoteness of the plants; 2) limited convenient research facilities; 3) difficulty in growing plants under experimental conditions; and 4) short duration of individual flowers (ca. 5 days) and long life cycle (4.5-5 years fide Meijer, 1958) from seed to seed. Justesen (1922) was able to find only seven flowers during four months of intensive searching in Sumatra in 1920. Meijer reported the appearance of 31 flowers in the same area over two years in 1954-1955. We observed 1 1 flowers of a different species dur- ing a 14-month period in northern Borneo in 1983-1984 but were able to find only two flow- ers for experimental investigation after this pollination biology study was initiated. Rafflesia was originally described by Robert 1148</page><page sequence="2">August 1988] BEAMAN ET AL. -POLLINATION OF RAFFLESIA 1149 Brown (1821) from material collected by Sir Stamford Raffles (Governor of the East India Company's establishments in Sumatra) and Dr. James Arnold (naturalist and physician) during a journey into the interior of South Sumatra in 1818. Arnold died of malaria during the trip, but in a letter to an "unknown friend" (Dawson Turner fide Mabberley, 1985) written shortly after the discovery he noted: ... here (at Pulo Lebbar on the Manna River, two days journey inland of Manna) I rejoice to tell you I happened to meet with what I consider as the greatest prodigy of the veg- etable world ... To tell you the truth, had I been alone, and had there been no witnesses, I should I think have been fearful of men- tioning the dimensions ofthis flower, so much does it exceed every flower I have ever seen or heard of... Now for the dimensions, which are the most astonishing part of the flower. It measured a full yard across; the petals, which were subrotund, being twelve inches from the base to the apex, and it being about a foot from the insertion of the one petal to the opposite one ... Brown initially suspected that Rafflesia was parasitic. In several places in his original dis- cussion he considered the possibility of para- sitism, noting (p. 226) ". . . the result of the examination of these [several parasitic species in which the union of host and parasite was observed], though not completely satisfactory, has been to lead me back to my first opinion, namely, that the Great Flower is really a par- asite, and that the root on which it is found probably belongs to a species of Vitis." The parasitic nature was unequivocally established in an 1820 letter from William Jack (Brown, 1821, p. 229) which indicated: "The first and most unexpected discovery is, that it has no stem of its own, but is parasitic on the roots and stems of a ligneous species of Cissus with ternate and quinate leaves . . ." It was immediately evident to Brown that the first flower and bud material received from Raffles was male. The only information he had at that time about a female flower was in the letter from Jack and one from Raffles to W. Marsden. Raffles subsequently provided fe- male material which was drawn by Francis Bauer5 between 1825 and 1831 and later pub- lished by Brown (1844). I Bauer had executed the exquisite illustrations of the male flower and its various parts in Brown's original paper. It is noteworthy that Blunt (1950) has said of Bauer: "It must, perhaps forever remain an open question as to who was the greatest botanical artist of all time, though I myself The dioecious condition of Rafflesia was suggested by Jack (in his 1820 letter to Brown) with the statement: "The flowers I find to be unisexual, which I did not before suspect, and consequently dioecious." Proof of dioecism, which would require controlled inoculation and culture of host plants, still has not been re- ported, but the fact that all flowers produced on a single root are of only one sex (W. Meijer, personal communication) suggests dioecism, as does the population structure (discussed on p. 1161). Brown (1821, p. 217) considered the polli- nation of Rafflesia as follows: "That insects are really necessary to the impregnation of Raffle- sia, is confirmed by Dr. Arnold's statement respecting the odour of the plant, by which they may be supposed to be attracted, and also by the fact of the swarms actually seen hovering about and settling in the expanded flower." Arnold had reported in his letter to Turner: "When I first saw it a swarm of flies were hov- ering over the mouth of the nectary, and ap- parently laying their eggs in the substance of it. It had precisely the smell of tainted beef." Brown, lacking field observations, failed to understand the manner in which flies are in- volved in transferring pollen from anther to stigma. His clear but incorrect statement on the matter is as follows (p. 217): "The passage of the pollen to the bottom of the flower, where it is more easily accessible to insects, seems likewise to be provided for, not only by the direction of the antherae, but also by the form of the corresponding cavities in the neck of the column, in the upper part of which they are immersed." After 170 years Rafflesia arnoldii retains its record as the largest of all flowers. The subject of our investigations, R. pricei Meijer, has flow- ers less than half the diameter, but we believe it exhibits the same pollination process and is characteristic for the genus, notwithstanding considerable morphological variation among the species. FLOWER MORPHOLOGY -Rafflesia flower morphology has been described by a number would unhesitatingly give first place to Francis Bauer." It may also be remarked that Robert Brown was " '. . . per- haps the greatest figure in the whole history of British botany.' " (Blunt, 1950, p. 198), hence the remarkable conjunction of circumstances that the largest flower in the world was first described by the greatest figure in British botany and illustrated by the finest botanical artist of all time! Brown (1844) said of the Rafflesia illustrations that they ". . . are among the best specimens of the unrivaled talent. . ." of Bauer. The reader is commended to examine this greatest of botanical art.</page><page sequence="3">1150 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 75 Fig. 1-6. Rafflesia pricel. 1.

Only fea- tures we consider to be critical in the polli- nation process will be considered here. Some characteristics by which Rafflesia species differ (cf. Meijer, 1984) and which may have relevance to pollination biology, are as follows: 1) Size; flowers vary in diameter from about 15 cm (R. manillana Teschenmn.) to nearly 1 m (R. arnoldii). 2) Diameter of the opening of the diaphragm; ca. 3-9 cm in R. micropylora Meijer to ca. 20 cm in R. arnoldii. 3) Number of disk processes; from 0 in R. rochussenii Teijsm. &amp; Binnend. to 20-60 in R. arnoldii. 4) Size and number of white spots on the perigone lobes and diaphragm; from few and large in R. hasseltii Suringar to small and numerous in R. arnoldii. 5) Number and size of "windows" on the inside of the diaphragm; 3-5 rings of round spots in R. micropylora, 7 rings of round spots in R. kerrii Meijer, or 5 rings of elongate oval spots in R. pricei. 6) Number of anthers; ca. 15 in R. manillana to 40 in R. arnoldii. 7) Structure and length of ramenta and position of their occurrence; from short and more or less pustulate in R. man- illana to up to 12 mm long in R. micropylora; in R. schadenbergiana Goeppert ramenta oc- cur on the underside of the diaphragm; ra- menta in various species may have apices branched or unbranched, swollen, or crateri- form. 8) Number of annuli at base of perigone tube and column, 1 or 2; 2 in R. pricei. Rafflesia pricei is intermediate in most of the characters listed above. The flower of R. pricei presents a target-like aspect with three concentric zones (Fig. 1). The outer zone consists of the five perigone lobes that have some 40-80 raised whitish spots (called warts by Meijer, 1984) surrounded by a brick-red background. These spots are irreg- ularly oval in outline, sometimes confluent, particularly toward the center, with the longest dimension tangential, and mostly ranging from 1-4 cm in length. Toward the perigone-lobe apices the spots become narrower, with the outermost often linear. The spot surface is mi- nutely rugulose giving a mat appearance while the red background is densely papillose. The middle zone of the flower "target," the diaphragm, has 4-5 irregular rings of white spots smaller than those of the perigone lobes, surrounded by brick-red areas that grade into the cream-white background. The inner edge has a narrow white margin with a continuous reddish-brown area just outside the white rim. The opening of the diaphragm, ca. 5-6 cm in diameter, constitutes the innermost of the three "target" zones. Seen obliquely or when the lighting is bad the opening appears dark, but from directly above with good lighting this is the brightest area of the flower (Fig. 1); the cream-white reflecting surface of the disk is punctuated by the darker processes, presenting a very different pattern from those of the other two zones. The underside of the diaphragm (Fig. 2) has five concentric rings of elongate white "win- dow panes" (blots in the terminology of Meijer, 1984), those of the middle ring (and sometimes the others) forming almost continuous rings around the inside. These are very similar to the window panes in sapromyophilous trap flowers noted by various authors. The spot pat- tern of the diaphragm undersurface is similar in male and female flowers and presumably has the same function in both. Ramenta completely line the interior of the perigone tube from the lower edge of the dia- phragm to the base of the tube. Near the dia- phragm a ring of fascicled ramenta forms a nearly continuous regularly notched flap (Fig. 2). Just below the flap is a narrow zone of sparse, short ramenta. The rest of the surface has longer dense ramenta, of brick-red color but in low lighting appearing darker, essentially dark wine-red. The ramenta are slightly flat- tened, sometimes 2-3-several-branched, with the apex minutely globose and pustulate. At the base of the perigone tube inside the zone of ramenta is a slightly elevated circular mound, lighter in color to the outside and dark- er inward as a result of a dense covering of brown papillae. Inside the mound is a light- colored, rather wide concavity, banded on its upper side by another convex dark zone with a dense vestiture of brown papillae. The two lighter-colored zones constitute the outer and inner annuli. The inner annulus is at the base of the column. In male flowers a series of ver- tically oriented grooves and ridges extends up the column to above the level of the anthers, ending in what have been called anther cavi- ties. The concave surface of the grooves is gla- to inside of the stigma. (The column was cut in cross section at about the same level as that of male flower shown in Fig. 4.)

The horizontally oriented, wide bot- tom surface of the disk that caps the column in the male flower (Fig. 3, 4) has brown warty bumps from which long hairs project down- ward, presumably also serving as fly guides. This surface apparently is homologous with the stigma of female flowers. Female flowers are externally indistinguish- able from male flowers but are easily recog- nized when the underside of the disk can be observed. Location of the stigma has been con- troversial-a remarkable circumstance for the largest flower in the world. Brown (1 82 1) spec- ulated on its location as follows: It is desirable likewise to have a more par- ticular description of the Stigma, to which Mr. Jack seems to refer both the corniculate processes of the disk, and the undivided limb of the column. These parts in the male flower have no evident papulose or secreting sur- face; for the hispid tips of the processes can hardly be regarded as such. But it is not likely that in the female flower they are equally destitute of this, which is the ordinary sur- face of a stigma; and it appears to me more probable that such a surface be confined to a definite portion, probably the tips, of the corniculate processes, than that it should ex- tend over every part of the apex of the col- umn. The position of the stigma continued to puz- zle Brown even after he examined female ma- terial. He noted (1844, p. 223) "If, however, the comiculate processes terminating the disk of the column be regarded as styles, which is surely the most obvious and not an improbable view .. . " Later in the paper (p. 225) he stated: Another point, which in my former paper I considered doubtful, namely the seat or limit of the stigmata, is not even now sat- isfactorily established; for the slender pro- cesses forming the hispid tips of the sup- posed styles, which have so much the appearance of the ultimate divisions of stig- ma, are merely hairs of a very simple struc- ture, and exactly resembling those found in other parts of the column; though in several of the specimens examined they were greatly altered in appearance, from a coating of mu- cous matter taken up and again deposited by the spirit in which the specimens were pre- served. A slight difference, indeed, seems to exist between the tissue of the apices of the styles and the other parts of their surface; hardly sufficient, however, to prove it to be stigma, though this is no doubt the probable seat of that organ. Nearly a century and a half later the problem was not resolved to the satisfaction of Kuijt (1969, p. 1 10) who wrote: "It is very difficult to be certain about the function of any parts of the female central column of these Rafflesia species. What constitutes the stigmatic sur- face?" He noted that the spines (processes) of the disk were originally thought to be func- tional stigmas, but was at a loss to suggest a function for these "decorative" outgrowths. He further stated: "The possibility of their stig- matic origin, of course, cannot be excluded. With regard to the functional stigmatic area, the best suggestion seems to be the smooth outer margin of the disk. It is here that ger- minating pollen has actually been observed in R. tuan-mudae (Winkler, 1927)." This asser- tion, however, must have been based on a mis- reading of Winkler. The latter was following Solms-Laubach (1876, p. 484), who was the first to state that the stigmatic surface lies on the underside of the projecting column disk margin ("Dass die wirkliche Narbenflche auf der Unterseite des vorspringenden Columnar- randes liegt und heir eine ringfoirmige, nach unten durch die rudimentdren Antheren be- grenzte Zone bildet ... ."). Our observations agree with those of Solms- Laubach (1876), Winkler (1927), and Harms (1935) (cf. Fig. 5). The true position of the stigma is further demonstrated by the presence of a differentiated pollen-tube transmission tissue extending from the stigmatic surface to the complexly chambered ovarian area (Fig. 6), as noted earlier by Harms (1935, p. 252). Although there has been confusion and mis- understanding about the morphological posi- tion of the stigma, its actual location was first accurately described over 100 years ago. The column of female flowers lacks the deep vertical grooves and sharp ridges of male flow- ers, but vestigial grooves and anthers are pres- ent (Fig. 5). The long hairs on the ridges in male flowers are absent in female flowers, as are long hairs extending down from the stig- matic surface. Since the entire stigmatic area is apparently functional, flies do not need to be guided into position as in male flowers where accurate loading of the pollen mass is critical. The stigma does have small papillae (not vis- ible in Fig. 5), which in fading flowers are ev- ident from their brownish coloration. These may be homologous with the long hairs (Fig. 3) on the underside of the disk in male flowers.

In male flowers the column internally con- sists of essentially undifferentiated paren- chyma, while in female flowers the ovary oc- cupies much of the space from just below the level of attachment of the perigone lobes to nearly even with the highest level of the sulcus (Fig. 6). Below the parenchymatous tissues of the disk the ovary is bounded by differentiated pollen tube transmission tissue. In cross sec- tion (Fig. 7) the ovary can be seen as a complex labyrinth of chambers, the walls of which are densely covered with many tiny ovules. The upper surface of the column disk has about 23-32 radially flattened processes (Fig. 8, 9) that are sometimes slightly branched and have at their apices short penicillate brown hairs. That these are not styles and stigmas as Robert Brown originally suspected has been known since Solms-Laubach's (1876) early work, but no satisfactory explanation of their function has yet been offered (see p. 1 158). The rim of the disk margin is slightly lower than the apices of the processes and has a similar pubescence on its finely irregular crest. MATERIALS AND METHODS -Rafflesia pricei, endemic to northern Borneo, occurs in mon- tane dipterocarp forest on Mount Kinabalu and adjacent parts of the Crocker Range in the Ma- laysian state of Sabah. Although first collected in 1931, discussed in several papers in the 1 960s and 1970s, and featured on the October 1976 cover of BioScience, it was not formally de- scribed until 1984. Since rarity may be of sig- nificance in the pollination biology of the ge-</page><page sequence="7">1154 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 75 nus, as discussed on p. 1 161, it may be noted that during a year of rather intensive searching we were able to find only two populations. These occurred at 1,250-1,370 m elev. and occupied an area of a few hectares. Buds and sometimes flowers were seen on the roots of several different Tetrastigma vines. The rather numerous buds were at various stages of de- velopment; many aborted or were eaten (by squirrels?). A study of one of these populations showed bud mortality rates of 5 6-74% (Masni, 1984). Mortality greater than 50% in R. ar- noldii buds has been reported by Justesen (1922) and Meijer (1958). Flowers may open at any time of year in R. arnoldii (Meijer, 19 5 8) and R. pricei. Several flowers were observed in this study; one male and one female flower were used in the experimental treatments de- scribed below. These were from different pop- ulations and exhibited some minor but dis- tinctive differences in color, spot patterns, and tendency for the perigone lobes to recurve. Pollinator behavior and pollination mech- anisms in a male flower were qualitatively re- corded on 20-21 June 1984 for six hr. Obser- vations of pollinator behavior inside the flower were made by cutting a "window" into the side of the perigone tube and placing a 52 mm pho- tographic haze filter in the hole. Both observer and window were covered by a black cloth during the observations to maintain natural lighting in the flower's interior and to visually obscure the observer. Experimental manipulations designed to de- termine the relative importance of visual and olfactory floral cues in attracting pollinators were carried out on 20-22 July 1984. The fe- male flower used in these experiments was ob- served as a large bud on 17 July. It probably opened on 19 July, and was in prime condition during the three days of investigation. Flowers ofthis species fade rapidly after about five days. Flies with pollen loads were never seen to enter the flower, probably meaning that it was not pollinated and that no male flowers were si- multaneously open within the range of the pol- linators. During this study one observer reported fly activity while another recorded the nature of activity and time (to second). Both observers were seated about 1 m from the flower. Insofar as could be determined, presence of the ob- servers had no influence on fly activity. For each experimental condition, the presence of visitors and the time they remained on the flower, in the flower, flying above the flower, or on other objects within a 1-meter radius of the flower were recorded. During both the June and July observations flies were collected for specialist identification. Pollinating visitors to the male flower were determined to be two bluebottle species (family Calliphoridae), Lu- cilia papuensis (Macquart) (3 Y) and Chryso- mya pinguis (Walker) (2 6). Flies collected dur- ing observations of the female flower were all Lucilia papuensis (5 Y). Voucher specimens of the flies are in the University of Michigan Mu- seum. Those ofRafflesiapricei (Beaman 10227, 6; Beaman 10698, Q) are in the Michigan State University Herbarium. At most times when flies were present during the 10.5 hours of re- corded observations only one, two, or three individuals were seen. On two brief occasions (at 12:57-13:00 and 14:18-14:22 on 21 July) 6-7 flies were simultaneously present and so much activity was taking place that it could not all be recorded. The 732 observations were entered into a dBASE III Plus database for analysis, making it possible to account for mul- tiple fly activity at any particular time and to evaluate effects of varying weather conditions. The experimental manipulations were as fol- lows: 1) Exclusion of visual cues: flower was covered with a black cloth; leaf litter was scat- tered over the cloth; the cloth had a hole cor- responding to the opening of the diaphragm. 2) Exclusion (or reduction) of olfactory cues: flower was covered with two partly overlapping lengths of polyethylene film (Glad Wrap?) that were tucked under the underside of the peri- gone lobes; this would not have entirely con- fined the odor to the flower but must have at least diffused it (the film caused considerable glare). 3) Reduction or diffusion of olfactory cues: a disk of polyethylene film slightly larger than the diaphragm opening was placed over the opening; presumably the odor was less con- centrated at the opening and less glare resulted than with treatment 2. 4) "Control" for treat- ment 2: flower was covered with two parallel lengths of polyethylene film, but with a hole in the film corresponding to the opening of the diphragm. 5) Exclusion (or reduction) of ol- factory cues: flower was filled with 1.09 liters of water (the water level came to about the top of the processes, although the flower was at a slight angle from horizontal). 6) Overall "con- trol": flower was observed without any ma- nipulative treatment. The sequence of manip- ulations conducted on 20 July was reversed on 21 July to compensate for possible differences in pollinator activity throughout the day. Each special treatment was separated from the next by observations (of varying duration) of the untreated control. The schedule of treatments was as follows: 20 July: 10:26-11:38 (6); 11:45-12:45 (1); 12: 50-13:33 (6); 13:36-14:36 (2); 14:37-15:06 (6);</page><page sequence="8">August 1988] BEAMAN ET AL. -POLLINATION OF RAFFLESIA 1155 15:07-15:37 (3); 15:40-16:01 (4); 16:01-16:13 (6). 21 July: 9:52-10:07 (6); 10:12-10:42 (4); 10:43-11:13 (6); 11:14-11:43:30 (3); 11:45- 12:15 (6); 12:18-12:48 (2); 12:49-13:05 (6); 13: 07-14:07 (1); 14:08-14:23 (6); 14:44-15:30 (5). On 22 July the flower was observed from 16:16 to 17:16 (data not included in Table 1) with no special treatment other than that it had been filled with water on the previous after- noon. At this time obvious breaks occurred at the junction of three perigone lobes with the diaphragm and no water remained in the flow- er. A very slight odor could be detected, less than noted the previous day. Moderate fly ac- tivity, about average for the previous two days, was observed around the flower during the first half hour of these observations, but virtually none for the last half hour. At the end of the hour the flower was separated from the host, taken to the laboratory, stored in a refrigerator for one day, and dissected on 24 July. At the time of dissection it was found to have a break almost all the way around the perigone ca. 3- 4 cm above the outer annulus. This might have allowed some but not all of the water poured in on 21 July to leak out. Presumably the breaks were caused by increase in turgor pressure re- sulting from absorption of excess water (4 per- igone lobes also broke partly away from their point of connection with the diaphragm and perigone tube). RESULTS-Pollinator behavior inside a male flower-During observations of flies inside the flower they were seen to crawl and/or fly over all parts of the interior, often appearing to be moving about randomly. Occasionally, how- ever, a fly would either land on or crawl up the base of the column, and following an anther groove (guided by the hairs on the ridges be- tween the vertical grooves), crawl into the dead- end anther cavity (Fig. 3). At the point where the fly could proceed no further, the dorsal side of its thorax was in contact with the anther. A fly proceeding upward in a groove was forced by the ridge hairs to be precisely positioned so that the dorsal part of the thorax contacted the diagonally downward and inward pointing an- ther (Fig. 9). A fly in a position where a pollen mass from the anther is in contact with the thorax is shown in Fig. 3. This photograph was staged with a dissected flower and a dead fly, but confirming field observations had been made previously. The pollen mass on the dor- sal surface of the fly shown in Fig. 10 is un- staged. (Pollen on the backs of flies also has been observed at a West Sumatran Rafflesia locality [Meijer, 1983].) The viscid liquid pol- len matrix readily adhered to the back of the fly. Presumably the insect found no reward in the anther cavity, and could go no further in- side. It would then back out and either continue to crawl about the interior or fly directly out. On the interior (lower) surface of the dia- phragm the concentric white rings of "window panes" around the opening (Fig. 2) present an aspect very different from that of the outer surface of the diaphragm. We postulate that the windows help guide or orient flies in the flower. Since the pollen mass is on the dorsal side, if the fly bumped against the under surface of the diaphragm on leaving a male flower or on entering a female flower, much pollen would be lost. Precise guidance of the pollinator is therefore important. Meijer (1983) provides a photograph of the inside of a flower that shows pollen masses in several places. These may have resulted from collisions by flies with pol- len loads. Configuration of the window pattern is essentially identical in male and female flow- ers, suggesting that the function must be the same in both. Visual and olfactory cues for pollinator at- traction -Results from the experimental treat- ments of the female flower are presented in Table 1. The control (treatment 6) had one or more flies near, on, or in the flower 56.6% of the observed time. The ratio data, however, give the best representation of total fly activity. The ratio for the control is 0.95, meaning that when all visitors are accounted for, a fly was present on average 95% of the time. The ratio for the control is more than twice as high as for any other treatment. The next highest ratio (0.47) occurred with treatment 3 in which a disk of polyethylene film was placed over the diaphragm opening. Presumably this was the least radical of the experimental treatments since visual cues should have been little af- fected and the odor only somewhat diffused. The visitation frequency (26.2 flies/hr) was al- most equal for this treatment with that of the control (26.8 flies/hr), but the duration of visits was about half that of the control as expressed by the ratio differences. It should be noted that both the number of visits and their duration are important. The longer a visit (up to a point), the more likely a fly is to pick up a pollen load from a male flower or deposit it in a female flower. With the polyethylene-film-disk treat- ment, of course, flies were prevented from going inside the flower. There were occasional col- lisions of flies with the disk, and at one point it had to be weighted to be held in place because of so much buzzing activity and several col- lisions.

It provides a means for expressing average overall activity of all flies during the observation period. d This refers to the area that would be occupied by the flower, were it visible. e Each observation was classified as occurring during sunny (1.00) or cloudy (2.00) weather. The value given therefore expresses average weather conditions during the observation period. The average weather value for all observations made over the entire period was 1.45. factory cues, covering the entire flower with polyethylene film (treatment 2) and filling it with water (treatment 5), resulted in more dras- tic reductions in pollinator presence than did treatment 3. The latter had a ratio seven times greater than that of treatment 2 and twice that oftreatment 5. The very low ratio for treatment 2 may have been the result of effects on both visual and olfactory cues. Using the polyeth- ylene film to cover the entire flower except for a hole at the diaphragm opening (treatment 4) also had a low ratio, suggesting that glare from the plastic film used in treatment 2 may have made the flower less attractive to pollinators, thus affecting both olfactory and visual cues. The relatively high ratio (0.35) obtained when visual cues were hidden (treatment 1) suggests that olfactory cues may be somewhat more important than visual cues in enabling polli- nators to locate a flower. A problem possibly affecting treatment 1 concerns memory of the flies. If they had already located the flower by visual cues and were returning to its location by memory, the importance of the treatment would be reduced. Marking individuals would help overcome this difficulty. The potential ability of flies to relocate the flower by memory (with the aid of olfactory cues) cannot be sim- ply dismissed in view of experimental data by Kugler (1951) who showed that Lucilia indi- viduals learned to distinguish scented models lacking food from unscented models with a reward. Dethier (1962, p. 99), however, states that in 15 years of investigation he was unable to detect any unequivocal learning ability in flies (apparently implying blowflies). During observations of the female flower on 20-22 July the weather was variously sunny, lightly cloudy, and heavily overcast; a light rain occurred during three brief periods and one time became heavier. The flower was in direct sun part of the time, for some time with flecks of sun, and part of the time shaded by the canopy. Analysis of weather conditions shows that in the control (Table 1, columns 6B and 6C) fly activity was nearly twice as high during sunny weather (ratio 1.17) as during cloudy/ rainy periods (ratio 0.63). Weather values were computed to be between 1.41 and 1.50 (mean- ing about half sunny and half cloudy) for all treatments except number 5, which had a value of 1.92. The nearly equal weather values ob-</page><page sequence="10">August 1988] BEAMAN ET AL. -POLLINATION OF RAFFLESIA 1157 tained with the other treatments would seem to indicate that variations in the weather did not have a significant effect on the data except possibly treatment 5. The latter was carried out mostly under cloudy/rainy conditions pre- vailing in late afternoon. It was done after the other treatments because of the permanent ef- fect of the large water volume on the flower. DIsCUSSION-Pollination mechanisms sug- gested by previous authors - Ernst and Schmid (1913) noted that in anthers of flower buds in an advanced stage of development a slimy pol- len mass filled the central cavity of the anther and covered parts of the apical surface, thus explaining the absence of exine sculpture. They indicated that the pollen remained attached to the body of the insect which crawled over the anthers, adding that when it visited a female flower part of the pollen was rubbed off on the papillae while the fly crawled over the stigmatic zone. This explanation was repeated by Harms (1935). The vague nature of this account sug- gests that Ernst and Schmid did not understand the actual mechanism of pollen transfer. Justesen (1922, pp. 74, 75) made several in- teresting observations on the activities of flies around Rafflesia flowers which bear quoting: The flowers of both sexes give off a certain odour, which can be perceived immediately after the flower has opened, and which will increase slightly till the second and third day, after which it decreases. Even at its climax however the scent is not at all powerful and will only be noticed on approaching the nose very near to the disc of the flower [to this effect see also Beaman and Adam (1984)]. The smell comes from the column and in the male flower very distinctly from the an- thers or the lodges in which they are im- planted, and certainly it attracts flies to them. In several instances I saw flies approach the male flower and fly directly into the infra- discoidal groove [in a dissected portion ?] without hesitation and without sitting down upon other parts of the corolla. In the female flowers I was not able to make a correspond- ing clear observation. Many flies visited them, but they wandered about upon the disc and the column indiscriminately, apparently without giving any part of it a special pref- erence. On the 29/4 I observed a male and a female flower, growing only a couple of metres distant from each other (instances 3 and 4 in growing place A) and several times I saw a fly coming out from the one flower and directly entering the other one. The flies I observed were of two kinds, a larger one, 1 cM. long, of green, metallic colour, and a very small one, 2 to 3 mM. long, very frail, pink and grey in colour. Watching the play of the flies in the flowers I was struck by an idea that possibly can explain to us the sig- nificance of the ramenta and the white patches of the diaphragm, a problem that had often risen in my mind. I practically never saw a fly sit down upon the ramenta, or if it did so it quickly left them again, and I absolutely never saw one settle down on the underside of the diaphragm. Are not the ramenta meant to prevent the flies from alighting and wandering upon the walls of the subdiaphragmatical cavity, where they are of no use, and do not the small, stiff hairs, that cover the greater part of the column share in this function, compelling the insects to go straight to the smooth and easy high- ways, that are leading to the anthers, where work has to be done? And have not the white patches a similar function? In the relative darkness, that reigns in the interior of the flower, these large, white spots are shining like diabolical eyes, which readily might fill a fly's mind with fear, keep him away from the higher regions and make him hide under the protecting cover of the disc. Winkler (1927, pp. 64-65) discounted some of Justesen's observations, indicating that be- cause the flies are not forced to crawl around inside the spacious flower there is little reason to believe that the ramenta force the flies into the area of the anthers. He considered Juste- sen's interpretation of the function of the white spots on the inside of the diaphragm to be anthropomorphic, noting that the spots would be of little advantage for pollination if they encouraged flies to go under the protective rim of the disk in the male flower, but to complete the pollination process they would next have to fly to a female flower and not allow them- selves to be scared under the disk rim by the "threatening" diaphragm spots (see pp. 1 155, 1160 concerning our hypothesis on the func- tion of the windows). Winkler noted that if only flies are the pol- linators one does not need to look for special structural peculiarities in the flower that help insects find their way to the anthers. Rather, he considered it sufficient that the anthers are placed in hidden cavities to which the flies instinctively go. He further stated that they would smear their bodies with pollen when they run here and there in the ring-shaped fur- rows between the anther orifices and column walls. This point is incorrect because guide hairs on the column of male flowers prevent free movement of flies. Haak (1885, cited by Winkler) thought that</page><page sequence="11">1158 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 75 nectar was secreted from the annular area at the base of the perigone tube. He suggested that insects could creep up the columnar slope to get to the nectar and, in the process, cover themselves with pollen that fell from the an- thers. Winkler noted that this peculiar expla- nation failed in that the pollen of Rafflesia is a viscous liquid rather than powdery. It also fails in that Rafflesia lacks nectaries. Winkler (p. 66) speculated that flies initially had a negative phototaxis that permitted them to select the darkest area in the flower before laying eggs. He thought this might subsequent- ly change to a positive phototaxis, enabling the flies to leave, and in the process crawl over the stigma. He noted that this process would cause pollinators to be continually coming into con- tact with the stigmatic area or at least with the rim of the disk, from which any pollen that was brushed off the pollinator could easily fall toward the stigma (how he thought a viscous liquid mass of pollen could fall sideways or around the angular lower edge of the disc is unclear to us). Not fully accepting the preceding explana- tion, Winkler went on to suggest a second hy- pothesis that he considered adventuresome. He noted that a pollen-smeared insect might brush pollen onto the ramenta and other hairs as it crawled around a female flower. Then if the flower should fill with water, the pollen would float to the surface, coming into contact with the wide, horizontally placed stigma. In view of the absorptive ability of the flower (see be- low) we find little merit in this hypothesis. A more direct pollen transfer mechanism is de- scribed in the Conclusions. Winkler (p. 62) questioned that the gigantic size of the flower could be significant in at- tracting pollinators. He offered an alternative explanation, citing an 1875 paper by Nagel- voort, that the coloration might be a protective camouflage to prevent consumption by wild pigs. To the contrary, we believe the flower is ideally suited for visual attraction of pollina- tors and consider it conspicuous to flies, pigs, and people. The experimental data presented in Table 1 provide strong evidence for the im- portance of visual cues. A large body of pol- lination biology literature published subse- quent to Winkler's work supports the concept that size and coloration are adaptive for pol- linator attraction (cf. Faegri and Pijl, 1979; Proctor and Yeo, 1972). Function of the processes and ramenta -The function of the column disk's corniculate pro- cesses that Robert Brown thought might be styles and stigmas is still highly problematical. We occasionally saw flies perched on them, but they would seem to be energetically expensive and elaborate fly perches. Nevertheless, in some Aristolochia and Ceropegia species tongue-like structures are produced upon which the pol- linators alight (Proctor and Yeo, 1972). The processes are very light cream-colored at the base and become progressively darker brown apically. They have a major effect on light re- flectivity at the center of the flower, but it is difficult to ascribe particular significance to the resultant patterns. Their most likely function, and that of the disk rim, might be in serving as "radiator fins," helping to radiate heat that would facilitate dispersal of the odor (cf. Meeuse, 1978). The adaptive significance or function of the ramenta, which vary considerably from species to species, is similarly problematical. The api- ces are generally globular or crateriform, which might indicate a gladular nature. Meijer (1985) suggests that they may produce the scent, but we did not detect an odor. Their pustulate api- ces, however, are similar in superficial ap- pearance to osmophores illustrated by Vogel (1961) in Ceropegia. The possibility that they, as well as the processes, are heat-producing organs also should be examined. In addition to having a function in volatilization of aro- matic compounds, heat might help the flower mimic warm carrion or mammalian feces that would result from respiration of decomposer organisms (cf. Moodie, 1976). The surface tex- ture produced by the ramenta might also sim- ulate an oviposition substrate. From our direct observations of flies crawling over the inside of the flower, Justesen's (1922) assertion (see quotation on p. 1 157) that the ramenta force flies to go directly to the anthers is incorrect. The ramenta possibly could serve as ab- sorptive organs preventing flowers from filling with water. After the female flower used in our experiments was filled with water it was left in the forest during a night of heavy rains (inferred from weather conditons at our residence about 35 km distant). The next afternoon the flower contained no water. Turgor pressure appar- ently had caused the flower to crack in several places (see p. 1 155), but the cracks could not have allowed all the water to escape. They would not have occurred had not a large amount of water been absorbed. We therefore suggest that Rafflesia flowers have the capability to absorb water as an adaptation which prevents them from becoming water-filled in a high-rainfall environment. We never observed a fresh flower with any standing water, even after heavy rains.</page><page sequence="12">August 1988] BEAMAN ET AL. -POLLINATION OF RAFFLESIA 1159 Ramenta greatly increase the surface area of the flower's interior and might therefore en- hance absorptive ability. If Rafflesia flowers contained even a small amount of standing water this might act as a barrier to flies crawling around inside, pre- venting them from reaching anther grooves or sulcus below the stigma. A substantial amount such as that added in our experiment would cover the anthers of male flowers and the stig- ma of female flowers, making pollination im- possible. Winkler (1927, p. 7) and Meijer (1958, 1983) have made observations similar to ours with respect to the absorptive ability of the flower. Winkler noted that the perigone tube of a fe- male flower left outside during a rainy night was completely filled with water up to the disk margin. A few hours later the water had dis- appeared, although no crack or tear was found. A male flower also exposed to a night of heavy rain was found early the next morning to be entirely empty of water. Winkler posed the question that the ramenta absorbed the water, which might have gone into the root. The column disk, however, which lacks ra- menta also has considerable absorptive ability. This structure is cup-like by virtue of the rim which is nearly as high as the processes. Its shiny surface superficially does not appear ab- sorptive, but it was relatively dry in every flow- er observed, even during rainy periods. Since other parts of the flower have water-absorbing ability, this may not be a primary function of the ramenta. The possibility that water could be absorbed by the outer and inner annuli or by stomata on various parts of the flower merits investi- gation. Stomata on the perigone of Rafflesia were described and illustrated by Cammerloh- er (1920), who suggested that in addition to having a respiration and transpiration role they might serve in discharging the odor or as hy- dathodes. Their adaptive significance would likely be greater in removing water from the flower surface by absorption than in adding to it by guttation. Pollination syndrome-Rafflesia flowers are thought to imitate rotting meat by color and smell (Meeuse, 1961). The pollination syn- drome is sapromyophily, as outlined by Faegri and van der Pijl (1979, p. 105) in which 1) the pollination unit is radial, but with a depth ef- fect; 2) colors are dull (not especially so in Rafflesia) and brown (more brick-red in Raf- flesia), checkered, and with white spots on the interior that may simulate windows; 3) odor resembles that of decaying protein; 4) nectar or other primary attractants are lacking; and 5) sexual organs are hidden in the interior of the flower. Faegri and van der Pijl (1979, p. 81) note that the larger the flower (within reasonable limits) and the more it contrasts with its sur- roundings, the more effective it is likely to be in attracting pollinators. The functional sig- nificance of Rafflesia flower size must be that the solitary gigantic flower, which has the sole function of attracting flies, compensates for lack of a multiflowered inflorescence as a visual cue to pollinators. The great size may serve in visual attraction of pollinators from a distance, with the large white spots of the perigone lobes and the con- trasting brick-red background providing the initial or primary attraction; the diaphragm would be a secondary visual attractant, per- mitting a finer focus or orientation of the fly from closer range; the opening itself with the reflective disk below would provide the final landmark. At closer range odor as well as form would serve an orientation function. Experi- ments performed by Kugler (1951) involving Lucilia visits to flower heads of the scentless mayweed (Matricaria inodora [= M. perforata Merat]) suggest that the approach of a fly from a distance is purely visual, but at close quarters scent plays a part in determining whether or not the insect alights. Kugler (1955, 1956) also carried out exper- imental studies on visual responses of Lucilia and other genera of Diptera to various colors. With the genera Calliphora and Sarcophaga he found that flies hatched in captivity pre- ferred yellow over brown-purple in the pres- ence of sweet scents and brown-purple over yellow and white in the presence of excremen- tal odors. He noted that dull, purplish, check- ered colors had no special attraction for sap- romyophilous pollinators under ordinary circumstances while the same colors had a pos- itive attraction in the presence of a decayed- protein odor. When Lucilia was tested in re- sponse to a disk and a funnel, the funnel was preferred. The Rafflesia flower is quite funnel- like. Brown and brownish purple colors that attract flies which feed on or breed in carrion and excrement are found especially in flowers that deceive or trap flies (Proctor and Yeo, 1972). The central portion of the Rafflesia flower has some parallels with Arisaema laminatum (Araceae) in which the tissue of the spathe re- flects and refracts light, producing a concen- tration of illumination that is enhanced by dark</page><page sequence="13">1160 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 75 surrounding colors (Pijl, 1953). Kugler (1 942) showed that shiny surfaces attract inexperi- enced bumblebee visitors more effectively than do mat ones. The highly reflective upper disk surface of Rafflesia pricei is relatively shiny whereas the white spots on the perigone lobes and diaphragm exterior have a mat appear- ance, but we are uncertain if observations on bumblebees can be extended to flies. Lucilia is positively phototactic (Oldroyd, 1964), how- ever, any may be induced to enter by both the bright disk and the "window panes" on the inside of the diaphragm. Thus the windows may function somewhat like those of various flytrap flowers in addition to serving as a guid- ance mechanism as suggested above. Rafflesia flowers are also similar to some South African desert stapelias which are large, have similar spot patterns and color, and may have the brightest part of the flower at the center around the sex organs. The odor we noted in R. pricei was likewise reminiscent of Stapelia. Intensity of the odor of Rafflesia flowers has been variously reported in the lit- erature as barely detectable (to humans) to a powerful stench. This may vary from species to species and during developmental stages of a particular flower. The odor of R. pricei was apparent to us only by putting our nose into the diaphragm opening. Carrion flies are uninterested in flowers as such and have no incentive for visiting special parts, except to go against the gradient of odor ''expecting" to find some protein as its source (Faegri and Pijl, 1979, p. 103). As a result, in sapromyophily there is no adaptation of the flies for flower visits-the basis for the visit is deceit. Any adaptations that occur are those of the plant. In a consideration of deceptive flowers (Tauschblumen) Daumann (1971) was uncer- tain of the status of Rafflesia as a deceptive flower. He thought that pollen might be a po- tential reward in male flowers but regarded as unknown whether or not female flowes had a stigmatic secretion. He referred to Winkler (1927) who left unresolved the production of nectar by Rafflesia. We believe our observa- tions now establish that the flower does not produce nectar, that the stigma has no secre- tions that would serve as a reward for polli- nators, and that pollen on the back of the flies is of no value to them. Rafflesia would there- fore conform to Daumann's Type C deceptive flower. Nonetheless, we accept Dafni's (1984) premise that it is often unclear whether there is a reward and, if so, the extent to which it is consumed by pollinators. Since olfactory deceit is involved, only one or a few pollinator species are to be expected (Dafni, 1984). Various small flies (Drosophila?) were seen in and around some R. pricei flowers after the fading process was underway (Beaman and Adam, 1984). The pollinator flies were observed also visiting human feces; other dip- terans were seen on this fecal deposit in the vicinity of Rafflesia, but they showed no in- terest in the flower. The nature of the deceit practiced by Raf- flesia might be that of seeming to provide food and/or brood place. If eggs or larvae had been found in the flower, circumstances would point particularly to brood place deception, but we saw no eggs or larvae in several dissected flow- ers and W. Meijer (personal communication) also has never seen eggs or larvae in fresh flow- ers. The preponderance of female flies in our collection is understandable in that females must have a protein source at certain stages in egg development whereas males have a lesser protein requirement (Dethier, 1976, p. 300). Once inside the flower, flies may not find the proper stimuli for oviposition and therefore deposit no eggs (cf. Rice, 1977). Food source and brood place in the form of an animal car- cass or feces may be the same for female flies. There is also the possibility that males might come to the flowers in expectation of mating, but if that were the case more males should have occurred in our fly collection as well as female Chrysomya (although the sample is very limited). The low fly activity observed in late afternoon suggests that the flower is not being used as a sleeping place. Whether Rafflesia is a "complete" deceptive flower in the sense of Daumann (1971) is not entirely resolved to our satisfaction. Van der Pijl (1960) reported that fly pupae have been found in old flowers of Rafflesia. Although we saw no larve in fresh flowers, we did not crit- ically examine flowers that had faded. Not- withstanding van der Pijl's indication, we think it unlikely that pollinator species are success- fully using these flowers as a brood place. Dau- mann, however, cited Rafflesia as an example that nondeceptive flowers might evolve from deceptive flowers if the substrate turned out to be suitable for pollinator development. Daumann (1971), in contrast to some other authors, makes the distinction between decep- tive flowers and trap flowers. He prefers to exclude trap flowers from the definition of de- ceptive flowers although recognizing at the same time that some trap flowers are deceptive and vice versa. Rafflesia is not a trap in spite of its many similarities to such flowers, the majority of which imitate oviposition substrates (Dafni, 1984).</page><page sequence="14">August 1988] BEAMAN ET AL. -POLLINATION OF RAFFLESIA 1161 Dafni suggests that dung and carrion flies might be viewed as preadapted to pollinating plants that are highly dispersed and flower for a short time. This circumstance prevails all too well in the case of the rare Rafflesia plants. The trap-flower correlation with sapromyophilous pollination has the effect of forcing the polli- nator to stay in the flower a long time, increas- ing chances of a successful visit. Otherwise, after several unrewarded visits to flowers, the insect might abandon them. Probably Raffle- sia, like Stapelia, does not need to be a trap flower; because of its rarity flies would not learn (if they can learn) that no reward is offered. Another aspect of rarity in the population structure of Raflesia is that the plants do not occur in sufficient numbers that there is any danger of killing off the pollinating agents by preventing them from producing offspring as a result of brood-place deception (if such oc- curs), a principle well stated by Meeuse (1961, p. 141) for the pollinators of Stapelia. Population structure may also have a bearing on sexual expression in Rafflesia. It has not been proven that the planLts are dioecious rather than monoecious, but dioecism seems highly probable given the local nature of populations, their rarity, and the likely limited range of the pollinators. The dioecious condition would be an important adaptation for preventing selfing and consequent inbreeding depression (cf. Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 1978). Beach (1981) makes a correlation in the Costa Rican flora between the dioecious condition and small entomophilous pollinators (Hymenoptera and Diptera) vs. hermaphroditic flowers and larg- er pollinators. In these cases, however, the dioecious flowers are inconspicuous in color and size, and the pollinators are selectively foraging for specific rewards. Bawa (1980) has noted that many dioecious species have fleshy fruits and animal-dispersed seeds, a circum- stance found also in Rafflesia. Conclusions-A fly which has already en- tered a male Rafflesia flower and exited with a pollen mass on its back should be fairly likely to enter a female flower if one were encoun- tered. We observed neighboring male and fe- male flowers open at the same time on only one occasion (before this study of Rafflesia pol- lination biology was initiated). We did not make the direct observation of flies in a female flower with the pollen-covered thorax in contact with the stigmatic area. In Fig. 5, however, it can be seen that the position of the column relative to that of the stigma is such that if a fly goes to the same position in a female flower that it had previously occupied in a male flower, pol- len would be rubbed off the thorax onto the stigma as the fly proceeds into space that be- come progressively narrower in the vertical di- mension. If it should fly directly away from the infradiscoidal sulcus, its dorsal thorax might also be likely to bump or brush against the outer portion of the stigmatic ring. Effective pollen transfer requires large flies such as those ofthe genus Lucilia. Smaller flies in the grooves of male flowers would be unlikely to come into contact with the anthers; in the sulcus of female flowers they would not be tightly wedged be- tween the stigma and the expanded column base. We did not precisely locate the source of the odor in either male or female flowers but hypothesize that it comes from the area where the anther-bearing and stigma-bearing tissue is connected with the column, as noted by Jus- tesen (1922) for male flowers. A possible role of the ramenta in odor production cannot now be ruled out, however. In respect to olfactory vs. visual cues in Raf- flesia, evidence is strong (Table 1) that both types are necessary to attract and hold the pol- linators' attention long enough to place pollen on the insects or transfer pollen to the stigma. In the absence of olfactory cues a fly may be less likely to come to a flower, and it would be unlikely to enter the flower in the absence of the attractive scent. Likewise, the absence of visual cues would make the source of the ol- factory cues less evident to the fly. The enor- mous size of the flower and the contrast with the environment is an adaptation that increases the likelihood that the flower will be discovered by pollinators. The parasitic habit has rele- vance to size because the energy required for development of the large flower is provided by the host. The phylogenetic position of the Rafflesi- aceae has been variously assigned near the Ar- istolochiaceae (Brown, 1821 [Asarinae]; Mel- chior, 1964; Hutchinson, 1973); Santalales (Cronquist, 198 1); Ericales (Goldberg, 1986); and in its own superorder near the superorder Annoniflorae (Thorne, 19 8 3). This lack of con- sensus on relationships of the family may im- ply an isolated phylogenetic position of it and two or three related families, but it is note- worthy that some Aristolochiaceae have trap flowers with a form remarkably similar to that of Rafflesia. Aristolochia often presents a con- spicuous purple-spotted perianth, decaying- protein odor, dark chamber, and window panes encircling the sex organs. The convergence of morphological characters for attraction of sap- romyophilous pollinators in a number of un- related families is particularly impressive, however. In addition to the Rafflesiaceae, Ar-</page><page sequence="15">1162 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. 75 istolochiaceae, Araceae, and Ascelepiadaceae, these characters are found also in the Hyd- noraceae, Sterculiaceae, Taccaceae, Burman- niaceae, and Orchidaceae (Faegri and Pijl, 1979). It may be noted finally that Rafflesia is some- thing of a double parasite, depending on other organisms not only for nutrition but also for pollination and offering nothing in return. With respect to deceit of pollinators Dafni (1984) prefers the term "unidirectional exploitation" rather than parasitism, but the principle of double dependence remains. If the deceit is that of seemingly offering both food and brood place, the "Great Flower" is doubly deceptive. LITERATURE CITED BAWA, K. S. 1980. Evolution of dioecy in flowering plants. Annual Rev.
