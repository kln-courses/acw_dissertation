<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 1 1 The anthropology of landscape:   materiality, embodiment,  contestation and emotion  Introduction Landscape is a subject of study that belongs to nobody. It has long been  studied in various ways and under various guises by geologists, social  and cultural geographers, planners, ecologists, historians and art  historians, archaeologists and anthropologists. Landscapes form the  basis for much poetry and innumerable novels and are thus of interest  to literary critics. Discussions of landscape are a mainstay of much social  and political journalism. To be interested in landscape is thus to enter a  promiscuous field criss-c rossed by different theoretical and methodologi- cal perspectives, values and interests. To some this undoubtedly makes  the topic exasperating; nobody can adequately define or tie down the  term, it is out of control and therefore of no analytical value. To others,  such as ourselves, the inherent ambiguity of the term and the diversity  of approaches and perspectives used to study it is precisely that which  makes the study of landscape so interesting and valuable. Such a topic is  inexhaustible and unbounded; rhizomic rather than rooted (Deleuze and  Guattari 1988: 5– 25), perspectives on landscape pop up anywhere and  often in an unpredictable manner. In many of these studies the term never  appears because others such as space and place and the environment –  even more broadly, the world – subsume it. Landscape is thus an absent presence in a huge body of scholarship.  In anthropology, books with landscape in the title were virtually absent  twenty- five years ago (Tilley 1994). Since then there has been a growing  interest in and development of landscape studies in books (Bender 1993;  Hirsch and O’Hanlon 1995; Feld and Basso 1996; Ingold 2000; Bender  1 </page> <page sequence="2"> 2and Winer 2001; Stewart and Strathern 2003; Tilley 2006; Arnason  et al. 2012; Jarowski and Ingold 2012) and in many journal articles. While  the traditional output of research in social and cultural anthropology has  been the ethnographic monograph hardly a single one has appeared fore- grounding the study of landscape as a topic worthy of consideration in  its own right during the last two decades. Ethnographic studies of land- scape are thus usually compressed into small vignettes within an overall  disciplinary field that swallows them up. An exception can be found in   the recent studies of Laviolette (2011a; 2011b). One of these volumes is  about landscape only in a metaphorical sense, its focus actually being on  extreme sports such as cliff jumping, extreme surfing and urban parkour.  The other considers a huge region, Cornwall in south-w est England, from  a variety of different perspectives, with its chief focus being how cultural  metaphors of identity are materialized. In its consideration of a variety of  different social groups – amateur footballers, artists, farmers, fisherfolk,  2 immigrants, landscape gardeners, scholars and tourists – it comes closest  to the general perspective taken up in this volume. But Laviolette’s land- scape analysis is on a macro scale. It embraces a whole series of differ- ent landscapes within Cornwall, like a series of Chinese boxes, one inside  the other. His informants, by and large, don’t bump into each other in  their daily lives as they are dispersed over a huge peninsula. This study  by contrast considers a small-s cale landscape from different individual  and social perspectives, enabling us to consider embodiment, materiality  and contestation in a quite different manner because our informants are   constantly co- present with others in the same landscape. This book is an extended study of a particular rural landscape in  south- west England. While we have no wish to rigidly define the term  landscape we want to briefly highlight below what we regard as the main  features of this particular landscape study and what it may have to offer.  • Biography: we examine the biographies of persons and the manner  in which the landscape becomes part of whom they are, what they  do and how they feel.  • Place: we discuss the manner in which different individuals  are involved in place-making activities, that is to say how they  name places, sometimes not places on any Ordnance Survey  topographic map, the places they like or dislike (Tuan’s topophilia  and topophobia; Tuan 1974, 1977). In this respect we consider  landscape as being a set of relationships between places in which   meaning is grounded in existential consciousness, event, history   and association: wisdom ‘sits in places’ (Basso 1996). 2 An Anthropology of lAndscApe </page> <page sequence="3"> 3 • Motility: we discuss the manner in which persons and groups move  across the heathland landscape:  the paths that they follow and  the manner in which they move, on their own or accompanied by  others. The temporality of movement and the sequences in which  persons encounter places along the way may be fundamental to  how people experience landscapes and thus feel about them (Tilley   1994: 27ff.; Ingold 2007, 2011).  • Mediation: we discuss how the manner in which the heathland is  encountered and understood alters according to whether people  walk across it (and the manner in which they walk; Ingold and  Vergunst 2008; Tilley 2012) or whether their encounter is tech- nologically mediated – by modes of transport such as cycling; by  activities involving tools such as fishing, flying model aircraft  or holding a rifle; by riding across it on a horse; or by being   accompanied by a dog.  • Agency, aesthetics, and well- being: we consider what the landscape,  as a sensuously encountered material form, does for people and in  reciprocal relationship what it does for them (Gell 1998; Milton   2002; Tilley 2004, 2008, 2010; Laviolette 2011a).  • Conflict and contestation: we discuss the ways in which differing  attitudes and values to landscape relate to different modes of  encounter and priorities:  the politics of landscape (Bender and   Winer 2001; Tilley 2006).  • Nature and culture: what do these terms mean to people in the  context of this landscape? While academics happily dispute the  value of the opposition (e.g. Descola and Palsson 1996; Descola  2013; Darrier 1999; Strang 1997; Ingold 2000; Castree and  Braun 2001; MacNaughton and Urry 1998), nature is to others an  invaluable term informing their environmental ethics and politics  and their encounters with the world. To strip a concept of nature  away may thus have unintended and disempowering social and  political effects in terms of a rapidly developing global crisis in  which humanity is destroying the environment on which it depends.  We consider the archaeological and historical development of this  landscape in a companion volume to this. Anthropology rapidly turns  into history. In fact it is already history by the time that it is published.  The ethnographic present of this book is the period 2008–2 012, when  the fieldwork was carried out. We wish to elaborate below in much  more detail on four key concepts that inform the structure of the entire  book: materiality, embodiment, contestation and emotion. the Anthropology of lAndscApe 3 </page> <page sequence="4"> 4 Materiality  A considerable amount of recent scholarship concerned with landscape  has stripped it of its materiality. By this we mean that the research is  thoroughly mediated by discourses and representations. Examples  include writings, maps, photographs, paintings, drawings, an entire  apparatus by means of which we vicariously inform ourselves about  something out there and distant from our desks. We see and understand  landscapes through the representations of others and, in turn, these rep- resentations become the object of further discourses. So in a somewhat   bizarre manner cultural geographers Cosgrove and Daniels can define   landscape as ‘a cultural image, a way of representing things’ (1988: 11).   Matless (1998) discusses the English rural landscape largely in terms  of its iconographic representation. Images take precedence to people   and place. Other scholars similarly taking a ‘post- structuralist’ turn  4 instead assimilate landscape to text. Duncan conceives landscape as  ‘one of the central elements in a cultural system, a text’ (Duncan 1990:  17). Such a text is a signifying system through which a social system  is communicated and experienced: one reads it like a book, and one  does not necessarily need to be there in order to do that, to experience  it; indeed one does not need to talk to anybody in order to write about  it in a univocal fashion (see for example Gregory’s astute comments  (Gregory 1994: 298ff.) on Soja’s (1989) representation of the Los   Angeles urban landscape). Daniels and Rycroft (1993) are content to  map modern Nottingham through the novels of Paul Sillitoe, rather than   gaining knowledge through walking the streets. We are not arguing that  pictorial or textual representations of landscape are uninteresting or  unimportant to analyse (see e.g. Laviolette’s anthropological mapping  of Cornish identities in terms of images (2011b: 80ff.), nor contesting  that they may constitute very powerful ways through which people  know and experience physical landscapes, so much so that texts or  imagery begin to constitute and structure encounters and experience of  material landscapes. Quite the contrary, it is just that they have tended  to dominate much discussion. Indeed, they have been taken by some as  defining what landscapes actually are and what the object of a landscape  study actually is. We offer a thoroughly materialist approach here as an  antidote and counterpoint.  From our perspective in this book representations of landscape,  textual or pictorial, are of secondary significance and we should treat  them as such; they are selective and partial, and often highly ideologi- cal, ways of seeing and knowing. In fact it is through material experience  4 An Anthropology of lAndscApe </page> <page sequence="5"> 5that we can understand the ideological nature of these representations,  the manner in which they quite literally frame the landscape, far better  than by undertaking any desk- bound analysis. We make the simple and  somewhat blindingly obvious comment that walking is not a text, cut- ting down a gorse bush is not a text, training to be a soldier is not a text,  a body is not a text, hills and rivers and trees are not texts. A materialist  approach to landscape is thus a return to the real, and we regard it as  a way to reinvigorate and redirect the study of landscape. The move is  from representation to the materially grounded messiness of everyday  life and the minutiae of material practices that constitute it. A stress on  the materiality of landscape means that the anthropologist/r esearcher  needs to be there, to experience the landscape through the sensual and  sensing body, through his or her corporeal body. The body becomes a  primary research tool. Such an emphasis on being there and observing  and interacting with others stresses performativity: the manner in which  our identities and those of others are constituted in and through action,  and the manner in which these identities come into being through per-  formances of identity (Butler 1990).  Fortunately there is a very long tradition in anthropology of par- ticipant observation and subaltern studies on which to draw, one that  has continued to have a very significant impact on the ways in which  anthropologists have written about landscape and that is manifested in   many of the various studies cited above. As Ingold has cogently noted:  ‘we owe our very being to the world we seek to know. In a nutshell par- ticipant observation is a way of knowing from the inside ... Only because  we are already of the world, only because we are fellow travellers along  with beings and things that command our attention, can we observe   them’ (Ingold 2013: 5). We also draw on another rich and increasingly  prominent anthropological tradition, that of material culture studies  themselves (for recent work see e.g. Tilley et al. 2006; Miller 1998,  2005, 2010; Ingold 2013). These involve an insistence that persons and  things are mutually constitutive. A landscape is certainly a complex kind  of thing. Unlike an artefact, we cannot grasp it in our hands or move it  around at will. It forms a material medium in which we dwell and move  and think. We are not somehow outside it, or contained by it; landscape  is part of ourselves, a thing in which we move and think. Therefore we  cannot think of it in any way we like. It is not a blank slate for conceptual  or imaginative thought but a material form with textures and surfaces,  wet and dry places, scents and sounds, diurnal and seasonal rhythms,  places and paths and cultural forms and built architecture that, through  differential experience, is constitutive of different identities. So the  the Anthropology of lAndscApe 5 </page> <page sequence="6"> 6landscape is both inside the body and outside of it, both part of whom  we are and a thing apart. Persons and landscapes are entangled in a net- work of material and social relations (for general discussions of the inter- twining of persons and things and their consequences see Olsen 2010;  Hicks and Beaudry 2010; Hodder 2012) providing both affordances and  constraints for the performance of identities that always occur in par- ticular material and cultural contexts. Landscape is thus an intertwining   of the flesh of the body and the flesh of the world, to use Merleau- Ponty’s   metaphor (Merleau- Ponty 1968: 142). Landscape is undoubtedly a very  complex material thing to attempt to understand or make sense of since   it is, to use Latour’s (1993) term, a quasi-o bject, something constructed  and made; a cultural product, but having an independent existence with  its own rhythms and purposes. We are touched by this fleshly material  world of landscape and in turn touch it. In the process we transform   ourselves. 6  Embodiment  Embodiment is a key term informing the discussions of this book in the  individual chapters in Part I and II. Here we wish to briefly outline what is  meant by this term from a phenomenological perspective broadly inspired   by the philosophical writings of Merleau-P onty (1962, 1968), and other  interpreters of his work. Collapsing a mind/b ody dualism, the body is  both object and subject, but the relation between the two is internal so  that subjectivity does not arise in the mind or in consciousness but is in the  body. Both subjectivity and the physical character of the body as a thing or  object are related to the corporeality of body and mind: what a body is and  what a body can do. The whole notion of a disembodied consciousness  is simply a manifestation of idealist thought itself. Such a consciousness  cannot exist because the mind inheres in the body and is not independent  from the body. It follows that the kinds of distinctively human bodies that  we have are part and parcel of the manner in which we think about and  experience the world. Our consciousness is thus structured in tandem  with our bodies as sensuous, carnal and subjective things. Merleau- Ponty argues that our sensuous perceptual activity ends  in objects, a position that runs counter to the naïve empiricist view that  assumes a world of impressions and stimuli that exist in themselves in  relation to which the body responds and reacts. Instead, the body con- stitutes both the cognitive ground of culture and its existential ontologi- cal ground (Lakoff and Johnson 1999; Cszordas 1990; Desjarlais and  6 An Anthropology of lAndscApe </page> <page sequence="7"> 7Throop 2011; Jackson 1995, 1996). Objects are a secondary result of  thought. This does not mean that these objects are immaterial or purely  a product of the mind. Instead objects are part of the same social and  material world that we inhabit. We ‘produce’ or ‘recognize’ them through  reflecting on that world and the process is indeterminate insofar as we  can never sense the entire world from the determinate situatedness of  our bodies. We exist in the world and relate to it from a point of view – the   setting of our bodies. So perception begins in the ‘pre-o bjective’  material  and subjective body and ends in the objects that the body perceives in  relation to it: ‘my experience breaks forth into things and transcends  itself in them, because it always comes into being within the framework  of a certain setting in relation to the world which is the definition of my   body’ (Merleau- Ponty 1962: 303). The bodily setting in relation to the world that we are concerned  with in this book is that of landscape, which provides, we argue, an exis- tential ground for our embodied being: we are both in it and of it, we  act in relation to it, it acts in us. Landscape is a product of our reflective  activity arising from our pre-r eflective or pre-o bjective bodily relation to  it (for a detailed discussion see Marratto 2012). Bodies and landscapes  thus produce each other in mutual relation, in the process of motility and  inhabitation. In the most basic sense the agency of landscape is embod- ied because it acts on us through the mediation of our bodies. The think- ing, subjective mind emerges in relation to the landscape and ends in   its perception. Thus the body may be both subject and object, sensing  and sensed within a landscape setting. It may be experienced from the  ‘inside’, through kinaesthetic sensations conveying information about  posture, position and movement, or from the ‘outside’ as a body among  others intersubjectively constituted through a mutual relation with other  persons in culture.  A seemingly contrasting perspective is provided by Latour  (2004), who argues that the body should instead be conceived as an  interface between different subjectivities and objects; it is from this  that perception arises. He makes no distinction here between ‘natural’  objects and material culture objects. Both play an equally important  role in the constitution of subjectivity rather than being a product of   bodily perception that cannot exist anterior to perception. This is a   perspective used by Vilaça (2009) in a discussion of Amazonian bod- ies used to critique an ‘embodiment paradigm’. What is at stake here is  exactly how we regard the primary locus of perceptual activity taking  place, and it seems to us a kind of chicken-o r- egg question lacking any   satisfactory answer. the Anthropology of lAndscApe 7 </page> <page sequence="8"> 8 Lakoff and Johnson (1990, 1999) explore the manner in which our  everyday cognitive capacities are rooted in relation to our bodily being  and emotional capacities in contemporary western culture: the manner  in which we perceive things to be near or far, to the left or right of us,  behind or in front of us, below or above us, forms the basis for our every- day, ordinary taken-f or-g ranted and pre-r eflective metaphors by means  of which we represent the real in language: the foot or brow of the hill,  the face of the clock, the legs of the table and so on. Happy is up, sad is  down, etc. etc. (1999: 49ff.). Metaphors are an ever-p resent part of our  language and the way in which we represent the world. They form par- ticular understandings of the landscapes we inhabit and the manner in  which they are empowered or naturalized (Tilley 1999, 2004).  Lakoff and Johnson point out strongly that because reason is not  independent of perception and emotion the distinction between animals  and humans is not easily drawn. In fact human reason is a form of animal    8 reason (Lakoff and Johnson 1999: 17) because both have a bodily basis  involving categorization of food, mates, predators and members of the  same species. Such reasoning obviously differs nonetheless in terms of  the manner in which it is embodied and through the perceptual senses.  Human conceptual reason does not reflect external reality because it is  mediated and shaped by the sensorimotor capabilities of our bodies, as  it is for other animals. This is important in understanding the embodied  relations between persons and animals and the manner in which each  understands and perceives the other, so much so that we may consider  persons and animals in some instances, such as the rider on a horse, or a  dog and a dog- walker, as co- beings mediating each other’s relationship  to the landscape (see discussions in Chapters 7 and 8).  While animals may actively mediate a human embodied relation-  ship with the landscape, so do technologies. In our everyday pre-r eflective  relations with the world we do not think in terms of subject–o bject rela- tions. We typically use tools as extensions of our body: the soldier and  his rifle (see Chapter 3) or the fisherman (gender intended) and his rod  and line (see Chapter  10). We become adept at using them and only  atypically do we regard them as objects of contemplation. Much work  on technology, while elaborating on the processes of making and using  things and describing them in terms of complex operational chains, has  tended to neglect consideration of their sensuous embodied material  character. Things extend our sensorimotor capacities out from the body   and into the setting of the world. In the process perception and under-  standing may be materially extended. In this case the agency of things  consists in their ability to shape and mediate human actions. They do  8 An Anthropology of lAndscApe </page> <page sequence="9"> 9this as part of a field of relations with others, a domain of social prac- tice, a dialectic of embodiment and objectification or a bringing forth into   the world (Bourdieu 1977: 87ff.; Tilley 2006a). Warnier’s ‘praxeologi- cal’ approach (2001) usefully fuses a consideration of bodily techniques  and instrumental techniques to understand how skilled practices become   subjectively internalized (for a variety of perspectives on these themes  see Ihde 1990, 2002; Ingold 2013; Lemonnier 2013; and most especially   Coupaye 2013). Another key aspect of an approach emphasizing embodiment is a   consideration of spatio- temporal relationships. Space and time are not  somehow outside social relations and acting to contain them but arise  from their embodied relation to persons. So what is near or far, here or  there, bounded or unbounded differs in relation to the body itself and  its motility in the world. So duration and the ‘depth’ of the landscape  and what constitutes the horizon become part of the pre- objective con- stitution of bodily perception. Past experiences feed into the present,  anticipating the future. Our temporal experience ‘colours’ the manner in  which we understand the present from the lived perspective of the body.  This is always limited, ambiguous, shifting and changing; some aspects  of landscape become foregrounded at one temporal moment and fall into  the background at another. Embodied perception shifts and changes,  is always in flux and is related to our interactions with sentient others,  human or non- human. Our perceptual senses engage with our embodied  being all at once in synaesthetic relation. We do not see the world and  then hear it or smell it or touch it. All our perceptual senses intermingle  in our embodied experience and all at once, a position currently being  valuably explored in the emerging sub-d iscipline of sensory anthropol- ogy (Classen 1993, 2005; Stoller 1989; Howes 1991, 2005; Pink 2009;   Ingold 2011).  Contestation  Meinig (1979) invites us to imagine a landscape thus: a group of different  people go to the top of a hill and look down and across the panorama  of landscape below. Each is invited to describe the landscape before  them: what do they see? Meinig lists ten versions of the same scene: the  landscape may be regarded in various ways as nature, habitat, artefact,  system, a problem, as a source of wealth, as ideology, history and so on.  Why the people might describe it in these very different ways relates  to their point of view and their interests and values, so inevitably the  the Anthropology of lAndscApe 9 </page> <page sequence="10"> 10 landscape seen from the ‘beholding eye’ means something radically  different for a property developer, a local historian, an earth scientist, an  artist and so on. Ten versions of the same thing is obviously an arbitrary  number: there could be many more or less. The general point though is  that political, economic, moral and aesthetic interests and values colour  what people see and may inevitably lead to radically different attitudes. Landscapes are thus inevitably contested. They are valued precisely  because they are valuable, part of people’s lives. They reflect the com- plexity of their lives. They are historically contingent and their mutabil- ity stems from the various ways in which people understand them and  engage with the material world. So landscapes are untidy and messy,  tensioned, always in the making (Bender 1993, 1998, 2006; Bender and  Winer 2001). Our landscapes of modernity are frequently on the move  and peopled by diasporas and migrants of identity, people making homes  in new places. They may be structures of feeling, outcomes of social prac- 10 tice, products of colonial and post-c olonial identities and the western  gaze, bound up with class divisions, property and ownership, outcomes  of the contemplative sublime or places of terror, exile and slavery (Tilley   2006: 8). For some, an increasingly small minority, landscapes are ‘task-  scapes’ (Ingold 2000: 189ff.) in which they earn a living. For the vast  majority landscapes have become pleasure grounds where they pursue  their interests and foster their own personal development. This inevita- bly produces conflicts of purpose and value, discussed at length in Parts  I and II of this book. The landscape provides different possibilities and  potentialities for different groups and that which is good for one is not  necessarily so for another. Some may want the landscape to stay the   same and conserve it, others may want to develop, alter or enhance it.  Emotion  Emotion or feeling resides at the heart of our human capacity to experience   landscapes as meaningful and a wish to prevent their destruction. Yet, as   Johnson has remarked, there is very little sustained analysis of emotional  meaning in philosophy or the social sciences more generally. What is  deemed subjective, private and personal is no doubt regarded as lacking  any cognitive significance and such irrational responses are not seen  to merit ‘serious’ rational discussion (Johnson 2007: 53). Referring to  recent research in neuroscience Johnson points out that basic emotions  such as doubt, shame, fear and joy have a deep-s eated bodily basis; they  may arise from the body in a particular situation in the world (e.g. seeing a  10 An Anthropology of lAndscApe </page> <page sequence="11"> 11  venomous snake in front of you or the joy involved in the birth of a child).  This pre- objective response of the body then gives rise to reflection, a  process in which cultural meanings are integral. So we only realize  that we feel something after a deep- seated response has taken part in  embodied experience. Environmental psychologists have not shied away  from considering the importance of emotional responses to environment  and landscape. They have long held the view that emotion plays a key   role (e.g. for early work see Kaplan 1973; Ittelson 1973; Wohlwill 1976).  Milton (2002), in a path- breaking anthropological study, has   explored in depth the relationship between emotion and rationality in  environmental policies and practices, in which contestation inevitably  becomes an issue in relation to economic development. She examines  the manner in which thoughts and feelings, goals, values and emotions  emerge from personal engagement with the world. Why is humanity rap- idly destroying the world? Why do we not care sufficiently about ‘nature’  to stop destroying it? Emotion, she argues, is the primary reason some  people care about nature. Environmental campaigners are passionate  about what they do and will speak about their feelings for and enjoyment  of the natural world. These deep feelings for nature emerge from their  perceptual experience of their environment. Working primarily with  environmentalists in Britain and Ireland she astutely examines how envi- ronmental policies and practices get formulated in terms of a wider field  of social and political relations. A fundamental difference between the   manner in which modern western societies and indigenous traditional   societies treat nature often involves the notion of the sacred. The former  can destroy nature because they are separated from it whereas for the lat- ter nature inheres in social being. Nature for us in the contemporary west   is a resource to be used and exploited and bound up with land ownership. In indigenous traditional society nature is usually not owned by  individuals. It cannot be bought, sold and bounded but is sacred and  intimately related to social identity. In destroying it people destroy  part of themselves. Much has been written about this through the  prism of the relationship of Australian aboriginal populations and  their landscapes (Munn 1973; Strang 1977; Morphy 1993) to the  indigenous cultures of North America in which the landscape is ani- mate and peopled with spirits (e.g. Brody 1982; Nelson 1983; Tanner  1979; Hornborg and Kurkiala 1998). A  rational scientific approach  to nature has served capitalism very well by depersonalizing nature  and in the process removing the moral responsibility for destroying it  (Milton 2002: 40ff.). One of the cases she examines is that of a pro- posed super-q uarry on the island of Harris in the Outer Hebrides. In  the Anthropology of lAndscApe 11 </page> <page sequence="12"> 12 terms of a rationalist western discourse on environmental issues it  is useless for protestors to claim that such a development should not  go ahead because they love nature and this quarry would destroy a  sacred mountain. Notions of sacredness are fine to take seriously in  relation to traditional indigenous societies but not amongst ourselves  in the west. Instead discourses of environmental protection have to be  framed in terms of a rationalist logic of cost– benefit analysis, prefera- bly in terms of that which can be measured, such as the visibility of the  quarry in the landscape and its economic impact on tourism in what  was designated as a national scenic area. A huge protest in these terms  against the quarry emerged (Milton 2002:  137ff.). As Milton points  out, while notions of natural beauty are inherently subjective and in  the eye of the beholder, visibility can be objectively measured and cal- culated: ‘the defence of natural beauty, and the defence of the market  interests that threaten it, have to be presented in an idiom that ena- 12 bles decision makers to appear independent. In western cultures, that  idiom is scientific’ (Milton 2002: 139). Milton cogently argues that the  opposition between rationality and emotion is a false one. Indeed it is  irrational to reject emotion as a way of relating to and valuing land- scape in public policy and other decision- making processes, for emo-  tions are what make us human.  Carrier (2003) makes a similar argument in relation to conflict over  environmental conservation in Jamaica. Here, as elsewhere, the moti- vation on the part of conservationists arises from their personal biog- raphies, which stimulate their desire to protect the natural world from  destruction  – from their emotional attachment to and knowledge of a  place. However conservation policy has to be formulated in a supposedly  impartial rationalist logic for it to be an acceptable discourse and to be   taken seriously. A powerful emotional attachment to a certain place may also result   in a tenacious feeling of ecological identity. Zavestoski notes through  interviews and observation that: it became apparent that most of the participants had either spe- cial places in nature, a place that had been special to them but was  developed or destroyed, or a particular experience in nature that  was significant in developing their concern for nature ... [and they]  explained how expressing their concern for these special places  as an emotional attachment or sense of oneness often resulted in  strange looks or dismissive reactions (Zavestoski 2003: 304) 12 An Anthropology of lAndscApe </page> <page sequence="13"> 13 Again we see here the regard with which the opposition between the  supposedly rational and the emotional is held, so it is refreshing to  find Alfred Wainwright’s exclamation ‘Lakeland is an emotion’ (2003:  203); for him there was no fear of being held guilty of unscientific   anthropomorphism.  De Nardi’s research and writings on the Italian resistance in WWII  provide a rich example of how emotion is embodied in this particular  contested landscape. She explicitly probes the veteran’s embodied expe- rience, focusing on the dynamics between space, the body and emotion, starting from  the premise that collecting wartime histories means dealing with  tales of the body and remembered corporeal experience (such as  the discomfort and soiling of the body, and the violence perpe- trated on the body) as well as through the gestures of the body in   recollection ... the body is a pivotal site of memory. (De Nardi 2014: 74) De Nardi writes that throughout the exploration of the ‘worlds of feel- ings’ of the veterans she came to appreciate the ‘embodied and situated  nature of much Second World War storytelling, and the paramount  role played by landscape and the environment in shaping emotions,  memories and approaches to the past and the events of 1943– 1945’   (2014a: 444).  Closely linked to the sensual dimensions of emotional experience,  identity (the definition of which is of itself ‘complex and contested’),   memory and motility within landscape are part of well-b eing. Indeed,  it is only since the 1990s that there has been positive recognition of  the association between emotional well-b eing and mental and physical   health and of how this is influenced by physical activity (Fox 1999: 411–  418; Stewart-B rown 1998: 1608– 1609). A good example of an activity   recognized to have an effect on well- being is Shinrin- yoku – forest- air  bathing – during which participants walk and breathe in the ‘volatile sub- stances’ released by trees. A popular form of relaxation in Japan, it has  been shown to be of great benefit in reducing high stress levels, depres- sion and hostility, all of which are major contributors to chronic heart   disease (Morita et al. 2007: 54– 63). These studies provide an invaluable  background to the consideration of the particular landscape discussed in  Parts I and II of this book. People are materially entangled and entwined  with landscape and precisely because of that they are emotionally bound   up with its past, present and future. the Anthropology of lAndscApe 13 </page> <page sequence="14"> 14  The Pebblebed heathland landscape of East Devon  The material context for this study is the East Devon Pebblebed  heathland in south- west England. This is an area roughly bounded by  the River Otter to the east, the Exe estuary to the west, the sea to the  south and the Blackdown Hills to the north. The area covered by uncul- tivated heathland is small. At their maximum extent the heaths cover an  almost continuous area of only about 13 km north– south, and 2– 3 km  east to west. In places the heath is broken up by areas of improved arable  land. The Pebblebed heathlands acquire their name from the distinctive  geology of the area. Fringed by rich pasturelands on clays and marls,  the bedrock of the heathlands is made up of multicoloured and water-  worn pebbles. These are the remains of a huge river that ran through  the landscape during the Triassic era some 240 million years ago. Now  what once was a river bed flowing through a sandy desert is raised up to  14 form a low ridge surrounded by farmland and, beyond that, higher hills. This landscape made up entirely of pebbles is unique and quite  extraordinary in the UK (see Tilley 2010). The area, although settled  from the Neolithic onwards, has never been cultivated as the soils are  very thin and acidic. Today it is largely ungrazed, consisting of an open  landscape of gorse, heather and bracken criss- crossed by streams and  with many boggy areas of wet heath. It is a Site of Scientific Interest and  an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (see Chapter 2). All the historic  and contemporary settlements in the area fringe the heathland; these  include villages to the east and west, and the small towns of Budleigh  Salterton and Exmouth to the south and south-w est. The villages nestle  in the valleys and it is possible to walk across the heathlands and see no  trace of contemporary settlement. In some areas, furthest away from  roads and car parks, one might not see a single person for an entire day  except during weekends (for some historical accounts see Brighouse  1981; S. and R. Elliott 2004; Stokes 1999). Although they are small in  extent they seem vast. From high points there are extensive views south  off the heathlands and across the sea. The nearest city is Exeter, some  11 km to the north- west (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).  A significant part of the regional economy today is tourism, but  the tourists are concentrated along the southern coastal fringe of the   heathlands and very few visit or know about the heaths (see Chapter 6).   Nobody dwells on the heaths today with the exception of the Royal  Marines, and their dwelling is only temporary as part of their training   exercises (Chapter 3). Those who work on the heaths or visit them are  predominantly local people from the surrounding towns and villages and  14 An Anthropology of lAndscApe </page> <page sequence="15"> 15    Figure 1.1 The location of the East Devon Pebblebed heathlands.  Drawn by Wayne Bennett the nearby city of Exeter. But even many locals, including people who  have lived in the area all their lives, do not know anything about or visit  the heathland. In this sense, it might be described as a ‘secret’ landscape  within an otherwise quite densely settled area. In the book we consider  the structure of ownership, the different groups who work in this heath- land and earn a living from it, and those who use it for leisure activities.   The local population is strikingly white and a significant proportion of  them are elderly. Figures from the latest (2011) census show that the  mean age of residents in the Budleigh Salterton area is 53.1, with 49%  of people over 60, one of the highest proportions for any town in the UK,  while 97% of the population is white British (Office for National Statistics  2011). Like other towns and cities along the coast of southern England  it has become a favoured retirement area for wealthy outsiders, with a  significant proportion of the population moving here from London and   other cities in the UK. the Anthropology of lAndscApe 15 </page> <page sequence="16"> 16 16    Figure 1.2 The main places on the heathlands discussed in the text.

Some information concerning some of the inter-  viewees – local people with pebble structures (i.e. walls, paths, ornamental   features, etc.) in their gardens and archaeologists working temporarily on  the heathlands as part of a landscape survey and excavation project – is dis- cussed in the companion volume to this book (Tilley 2017); these discus- sions have informed some of the interpretation and analysis here. Six key  informants, drawn from those managing the heathlands and from the Royal  Marines who use them for training exercises, were interviewed on multiple  occasions by both authors. The interviews took place in a variety of loca- tions: roughly half on the heath itself, the others in people’s homes, places  of work and local cafés. As is conventional, all names in the text have been  changed except those of persons who are too well k nown to be disguised.  Their permission to give their real names has been sought and kindly given. the Anthropology of lAndscApe 17 </page> <page sequence="18"> 18  Alongside these interviews we engaged in participant observa- tion with a variety of individuals and different groups: we walked and  traversed the heathland with those responsible for managing and main- taining it, camped out with the Royal Marines on some of their basic  training exercises, experiencing the landscape with them during both  daytime and night- time exercises, undertook litter picks with volunteers,  joined groups of volunteers engaged in environmental management, and  attended public and official meetings regarding the future of heathland  management and quarry development. We were involved in the annual  celebration of the heath (heath week held during the last week of July)  on three consecutive years. During this a whole series of events are  organized for the public: guided walks and wildlife rambles at dawn and  at dusk, to listen to nightjars, activities for children such as pond dip- ping and learning about the work of archaeologists, visits to the quarry  to hear about its pebble extraction and crushing operations. One of us  18 took guided tours to archaeological sites and monuments as part of these  events. We went out walking with groups of ramblers, watched people  fishing and flying model aircraft. We observed walkers, cycling groups,  horse riders and the Royal Marines crossing the heath on numerous occa- sions throughout the years and in all seasons. Much was learnt during a  systematic archaeological survey of the entire heathland landscape dur- ing this period and from the vantage points of various excavation sites  during fieldwork periods. We also asked selected informants to draw for  us cognitive or mental maps of the heathland (Downs and Stea 1973;  Gould and White 1993). These memory maps were not a test of knowl- edge but were intended to provide information about place preferences,  places that mattered enough to people to include them in their maps. We  regard these maps as their personal representations of the heathland as  being another way of telling. The heathland became during this extended  period of fieldwork very much part and parcel of our own biographies  and identities and we developed a deep affection and visceral knowledge   of it. Much of this experience sits in bodily memory and is impossible to   convey and recount in mere words. Inevitably the discussions that fol- low select from our experiences and what we have learnt from talking to  and engaging with others. The irony of any study of embodied identities  and the subjective experiences of others and ourselves is that, as a repre- sentational discourse, it attempts to write that which cannot be written:   much is lost or transformed in the process. The book can be regarded as a contribution to what has been vari-  ously labelled over the last thirty years as ‘anthropology at home’ or  ‘an anthropology of Britain’ (Strathern et al. 1981; Cohen 1982, 1987;  18 An Anthropology of lAndscApe </page> <page sequence="19"> 19 Jackson 1987; Rapport 1993, 2002). So this book is about Britain as an  ethnographic region of study and it is being carried out at home. However,  we are not particularly comfortable with either of these labels. First of all  we do not consider anthropology carried out in the nation state in which  one happens to live, or have been born, to be in principle any different  from research carried out elsewhere. It may, of course, be linguistically  less challenging, and in purely pragmatic terms easier than conducting  research in an ‘exotic’ location. It also obviously relieves the angst and  moral burden of a discipline still tainted by colonialism and, today, by  the unequal power dynamics of a post-c olonial encounter with the Other.  Second, the notion that there is any such thing as British culture  or an enduring sense of Britishness to be discovered and isolated in a  multicultural, globalized, hybridized and creolized world ‘on the move’  is rather difficult to maintain (Appadurai 1996; Eriksen 2010; Hannerz  2010; Rapport and Dawson 1998). At most Britishness or British culture  in any broad sense of this term is simply a manifestation of an imagined   community in Anderson’s (1991) sense of the term, something produced  and fabricated rather than shared and lived. But this point is too blunt   and requires qualification. Any notion of a British culture constituted by  a coherent and integrated series of ideas, beliefs and identities shared by  all contemporary British subjects does not exist in the twenty- first cen- tury and furthermore never did exist. However, there is another more  humble and everyday sense of Britishness that may still be said to persist  and be shared by many British subjects. This is not usually a matter of  overt and conscious identity construction in flag- waving and celebra- tions of royalty, but it may nevertheless be objectified in a myriad of  everyday material forms and practices such as talking about the weather  (Fox 2004), gardening (Tilley 2008, 2009), pubs, the popularity of walk- ing (Chapter 8) and coarse fishing (Chapter 10). Such different practices  may be completely unrelated in the daily lives of different British sub- jects, who may participate in only some or none of them. Furthermore,  they are cut through and refracted in multiple ways through the prisms  of gender, class, socioeconomic status, ethnicity and, in terms of locali-  ties and their histories, regions and nationalism. This book differs substantially from some mainstream cultural and  social anthropology in calling into question the latter’s rather narrow  focus on social and political relations as the principal object of study. For   example Rapport, one of the most prominent and subtle practitioners of  an anthropology of Britain in his study of ‘Wanet’, a village somewhere  in a rural dale, somewhere in north-w est England, considers the land- scape only as a kind of backdrop in relation to which lives and plural  the Anthropology of lAndscApe 19 </page> <page sequence="20"> 20 identities  – including his own – get played out (Rapport 1993, 2010).  ‘Wanet’ might be anywhere, or at the very least anywhere rural in this  particular part of Britain. He suggests that the individual and his or her  creativity is crucial for anthropological analysis, with the human psyche   as central (Rapport 2002: 8). Anthropology is for Rapport thus primarily  about mind, perhaps ultimately a form of individual and social psycho-  logical analysis. The alternative view put forward here is that anthropology is a  study of embodied material minds and should be primarily about the  material social circumstances in which people find themselves and which  they negotiate in and through their everyday material practices. It is this  that is fundamental to an understanding of how people make sense of  themselves and others. Some abstracted notion of mind and infinite cre- ativity does not appear particularly useful to us, hence our stress on a  nexus of terms – materiality, embodiment, contestation and emotion – in  20 this study. Kinship, ‘village society’ or particular social institutions do not  reside at its ‘core’. Instead we draw on an alternative tradition of material  culture studies, as discussed above, together with a holistic and material  notion of landscape as its foundation.  Conclusions  Landscapes gather, to use Heidegger’s felicitous term (Heidegger   2002:  355ff.). They gather topographies, geologies, plants and  animals, persons and their biographies, social and political rela- tionships, material things and monuments, dreams and emotions,  discourses and representations and academic disciplines through  which they are studied. So landscapes are mutable, holistic in  character, ever-c hanging, always in the process of being and becoming.  This book is an act of gathering in which the sum is more than the  individual parts. Inevitably we have had to be highly selective and limit  the discussions and the detail. Each of the individual chapters might  have been developed into a book in itself. The study is an attempt to  privilege breadth over depth since any study of landscape requires a  holistic approach. The materiality of landscape always outruns us;  the real turns into the surreal. We apologize in advance to particular  subject specialists who may feel that important contributions have  been ignored or overlooked in their own specific field of analysis  or discipline of research. The objective here has been to develop a  20 An Anthropology of lAndscApe </page> <page sequence="21"> 21 perspective by means of which we can understand landscapes in  terms of different performative practices, points of view and modes of  embodied engagement. The book is thus a textual attempt to evoke the  sheer complexity of the reciprocal manner in which persons engage  with landscapes and landscapes engage with them from a variety of  personal, moral, social, emotional, ethical and political perspectives. the Anthropology of lAndscApe 21 </page> <page sequence="22"> 22 </page> </plain_text>
