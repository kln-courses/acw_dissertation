<plain_text><page sequence="1">Expectation and Rational Conduct By T. W. Hutchison, Bonn Il y a longtemps que personne ne songe plus à devancer lexpérience, ou à construire le monde de toutes pièces sur quelques hypothèses hâtives. De toutes ces constructions où l'on se complaisait encore naivement il y a un siècle, il ne reste plus aujourd'hui que des ruines." Henri Poincaré I. The " Fundamental Assumption" Throughout its history, the idea of some "Fundamental Assumption", some basic "Economic Principle" about human conduct, from which much or most of economics can ultimately be deduced, has been deeply rooted in the procedure of economic theory. Some such notion is still, in many quarters, dominant at the present time. For example, it has recently been stated that the task of economics is "to display the structure and working of the economic cosmos as an outgrowth of the maximum principle"1). This "fundamental maximum principle", which should obviously receive very careful formulation and empirical verification, has been framed in different ways in the history of economic theory, from the profit-seeking Ricardian business-man down to the "rational" consumer balancing marginal utilities. Sometimes more emphasis has been laid on the purely hypothetical nature of the principle as a starting point for a deductive argument, while sometimes it is urged, rather, that the principle is in fact, roughly at any rate, an empirically true generalisation2). But at the present day far from their appearing to be any definite agreement as to the precise formulation of this "Fundamental Assumption" there appears not even to be complete agreement as to whether it is necessary or in fact used at all8). The clarification of these problems, and the re- solving of the, at any rate superficial, contradiction in the procedure of text- books which begin their exposition of the Theory of Value with the assump- tion that everyone acts "rationally" or "sensibly", and then in a later chapter base their explanation of economic fluctuations on "mistakes", "fluctuations of optimism and pessimism", or the casino-like nature of the capital market, is a necessary preliminary to the task of coordinating the theory of output and employment, with the theory of price or value. For this coordination, if it can usefully be carried through at all, can only take place by bringing the two theories under a common set of assumptions4), which involves finding out and formulating more precisely what the assump- tions of the two theories are. x) cf.

"Perfect Expectation " and the Fundamental Assumption In spite of other variations there is one remarkable characteristic common to nearly all formulations of the "Fundamental Principle" from its origins in Utilitarian doctrines down to the present time. One of Bentham's formulations was: "Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do"1). Ricardo expressed the principle, in a particular connection, thus: "Whilst every man is free to employ his capital where he pleases, he will naturally seek for it that employment which is most advantageous; he will naturally be dis- satisfied with a profit of 10 per cent., if by removing his capital he can obtain a profit of 15 per cent"2). J. S. Mill speaks of the fundamental assumption "that man is a being who is determined, by the necessity of his nature, to prefer a greater portion of wealth to a smaller in all cases . . ."3). Finally, a modern formulation: "The fundamental assumption of economic analysis is that every individual acts in a sensible manner, and it is sensible for the invididual to balance marginal cost against marginal gain . . . sensible conduct leads to the maximisation of money gains"4). The common characteristic of all these different formulations, - chosen quite at random, - of the Fundamental Assumption, is that as they stand they appear further to postulate, and only are applicable if the further postulate is made, that all expectations are perfectly correct. They therefore involve passing over all the problems of economy in the world as it is which may be said to arise from precisely this factor of uncertainty and imperfect foresight. They all make no mention of the question how one is to maximise one's profits. They simply say that it is "rational", "sensible", or "natural" to do this assuming, presumably, that one knows how this can be done. To decisions which are not of this certain automatic kind they have no applicability. The absence of uncertainty in the conditions analysed emerges clearly from the formulae themselves. According to Bentham pleasure and pain completely determine one's actions. There is no question as to which line of conduct leads to pleasure and which to pain, - this is apparently know for certain. Similarly with Ricardo, there is no uncertainty as to the relative advantages of different lines of investment. The assumption is tacitly made that it is perfectly foreseen that one will yield 10% and the other 15%, and people "naturally" select 15%. With Mill again the problem as to which line of conduct will yield "the greater portion of wealth" is not mentioned as existing, and his principle that men "naturally" prefer this to a smaller portion, only begins to have sense when it is assumed that people can foresee perfectly which line of conduct leads to the greater portion,- an assumption which Mill apparently tacitly slips in. Again in the last quotation, there is, as it stands, no question as to how one is to maximise one's money gains. This is known, and one simply acts "sensibly" on one's certain knowledge. Where uncertainty is present, as is, in principle, the case with any piece of conduct in this world, - economic or otherwise - ,one cannot, strictly speaking, seek the most advantageous employment for one's capital, or act so as to maximise one's returns, one can only act in accordance with one's l) cf.

Hutchison: expectations as to the "maximum" conduct, and the expectations of the most clever and "rational" may, in the world as it is, turn out to be incorrect. The terms "sensible" and "rational" cannot then be applied to conduct under conditions of perfect foresight in the same sense in which they are usually loosely applied to conduct in the world as it is. It is taken for granted as "natural", that people prefer a greater satisfaction in the widest sense, to a lesser one when they know for certain which line of conduct leads to the greater and which to the lesser. But in the world as it is, where this is not known, the terms "rational" and "sensible" are usually applied to the expectations , or the process of arriving at the expectations , that one line of conduct will yield more satisfaction than an alternative. When an investment is called "stupid" or "irrational" it is not usually meant that the investor in question was deliberately aiming at less than the maximum return open to him, but that it was "stupid" of him to expect that he would maximise his returns in that way. This use of such terms is, of course, excluded from application under conditions where all expectations are alike perfect. So long as one is concerned with a world where the choice is always an automatic one between a return which is certainly maximum and others which are certainly smaller, the assumption that people expect to maximise their returns and the assumption that they actually do maximise them come to the same thing. But where the consequences of all decisions can be perfectly foreseen, the maximum principle clearly works itself out in a very special way, which must be fundamentally distinguished from the only way in which it can work itself out when there is any uncertainty present, that is under conditions where people cannot conceivably know or calculate but can only more or less vaguely guess, which out of many possible lines of conduct will lead to the fulfillment of the principle. This vital distinction is only glossed over by assuming that people "tend" or "seek" to fulfill the maximum principle. An analysis of a world with any uncertainty in it, and particularly an analysis which takes into account the factor of money, (which can be construed as a sign that uncertainty is present, or even as a measure of its amount)1), cannot start from the same assumption of "sensible" or "rational" conduct as that applicable in a world without uncertainty,- the kind of world with which, consciously and explicitly or not, the bulk of pure economic theory from Ricardo onwards appears to have been concerned. With uncertainty absent economic life is "problemless" and automatic, and people would become more or less automata. As Professor Knight has pointed out: "With uncertainty absent man's energies are devoted altogether to doing things; it is doubtful whether intelligence itself would exist in such a situation; in a world so built, it seems likely that all organic readjustment would become mechanical, all organisms automata"2). The Economic Man had perfect expectation8). He was a pleasure machine because his life was purely mechanical. To say that this sort of conceptual marionette mani- pulated by the theoretical economist as a preliminary thought-clearing exercise is "rational" or has perfect foresight may be misleading. One might as well speak of the parts of a mechanical model "acting sensibly" or "having perfect expectation" when the mechanism works smoothly as designed. *) cf. J. R. Hicks: Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie, 1933, p. 445, und Rosen- stein-Rodan: op. cit., p. 271. a) cf. F. H. Knight: Risk, Uncertainty and Profit, 1921, p. 268. 8) cf.

What would a sensible man do in such a case? ... A technique which would study the economic effects of neuroses and confused thinking would be considerably more complicated than the technique here set out1). The Theory of Value, that is, is confined to economic tendencies where there is one definite, unambiguous, and correct answer to the question "How am I to maximise my returns?" - to conditions In which it might fairly be called neurotic or confused not to maximise them, it is inapplicable where there is any uncertainty about the answer to this question, - which is, in principle, always the case in the world as it is. Anyone in the world as it is, even the most brilliant economist, would be grateful for any information which would lead to his maximising his returns, and all he can do is to act in the way which he expects will maximise them, and cannot necessarily be called neurotic or confused if his expectations are wrong2). Passing over the difficulties in the interpretation of the term "wealth", it may well be a broadly true generalisation "that everyone desires to obtain additional wealth with as little sacrifice as possible"8). But this tells one nothing as to how, in fact, people set out fulfilling their desires, or, dropping the assumption of perfect expectation, how even it is "sensible" or "rational" for them to do so4). III. The Demand for Capital Goods and for Consumption Goods under the Fundamental Assumption There has recently been much discussion of expectation and uncertainty as affecting the demand for capital instruments. Here the attempt to make use of a definition of "rational" conduct which only has sense when perfect foresight is also assumed, has been found to lead to a more or less useless, 4) v. infra Section Y. 2) cf. J. Robinson: op. cit., p. 15. 2) Some of the Institutionalist critics came very near to exposing this limitation in the "orthodox" Theory of Value, cf. Z.C. Dickenson: Economic Motives, 1922, p. 240 - 246: „When we come to the market place we find, dealers absorbed in calcu- lations which are reasoning, discovery, invention, rather than choosing among utilities. Their desire to make the largest profit possible, within the rules of the game, is fairly constant; the problem is how to make it... As we have reiterated in many connections there is no a priori rule as to the accuracy of any individuals calculations. None can be completely accurate, for nobody knows all the consequences which will follow from any of his acts. Each of us is liable to be deceived as to the durability or stylishness of the clothes we buy. If any theorems of the accepted economic principles are depen- dent on the assumption of human infallibility in inferring the ultimate consumption utilities from concrete goods, ... of course those theorems are doomed." cf. also T. Ye bien: The Place of Science in Modern Civilisation, 1919, p. 227. 8) cf. N. Senior: Political Economy, 6th ed., p. 26 - 28. 4) The doctrine of Opportunity Cost is often expressed in a way which seems tacitly to postulate perfect foresight. The "cost", it is said, to Robinson Crusoe of a hammer was the amount of fish he could have caught with the same expenditure of effort; or the cost of the satisfaction from 6d worth of cigarettes is the satisfaction one might have got from 6d worth of chocolate etc. "Cost here, as any where means nothing but advantages to be derived from the use of given resources in other directions." (F. A. von Hayek: Collectivist Economic Planning, 1934, p. 6). But since the resources are never used in the other directions how, failing perfect foresight, can one know precisely and for certain what they would have yielded? How can Robinson Crusoe ever do more than make a for ever un verifiable guess at what the "cost" of his hammer was, - that is, how many fish he would have caught and how much satisfaction they would have afforded him?</page><page sequence="5">640 T. W. Hutchison: circular, theory of interest. If it is known for certain , - as Ricardo apparently tacitly assumed that his entrepreneur knew for certain, - that an extra £100 worth of machinery will add £8 annually to net output, and if the investors are acting "sensibly", and applying the machinery everywhere just up to the point where it pays and only just pays, then the rate of interest is 3 per cent per annum1). The weak link in this circular chain,- (perfectly descrip- tive of a world with no uncertainty, but defined to include interest), - is that obviously investors actually never do nor can know how much an additional £ 100 worth of machinery will yield, and can only act on their expectations. "The most important confusion concerning the meaning and significance of the marginal efficiency of capital has ensued on the failure to see that it depends on the prospective yield of capital and not merely on its current yield"2). This is clearly traceable to the inappropiate use of a definition of "rational" conduct which tacitly assumes perfect foresight, for with perfect foresight the prospective yield is as certainly known as the current yield. But as is frequently pointed out in discussions of the definitions of "capital" and "consumption" goods, the defining line between the two must be very arbitrarily drawn, - at any rate if one is drawing one's distinction in accor- dance with the length of the period of time which the good takes to consume. There is a "capital" element in all goods, in that all goods take some time to consume. The act of purchase and the act of consumption of a good cannot be co-terminous in time. This can conveniently be made part of the definition of the term "consumption of a good or service". Therefore expectations con- cerning the future must be considered as affecting the demand for "con- sumption" goods as well as for "capital" goods. Risk, uncertainty, and more or less correct expectations about the future are not the peculiar characteristics of enterprise or capital investment but pervade all action, economic or other- wise, in the world as we know it. The common text-book distinction between "present" goods and "future" goods, (instead of more immediately and more distantly future goods), inaccurately neglects the complete continuity between the two. This not very obscure, but fundamental, point has been clearly put by Schönfeld: „Wie alle Wirtschaften ein Vorsorgen für die Zukunft, ist auch die Festsetzung der zweckmäßigen wirtschaftlichen Verfügungen etwas auf die Zukunft Gerichtetes, - wobei es keinen prinzipiellen Unter- *) cf. J. M. Keynes: General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, 1936, p. 139 - 140. In a footnote Mr. Keynes asks the question : "But was he (Marshall) not wrong in supposing that the marginal productivity theory of wages is equally cir- cular?" Since any purely theoretical deduction as such must necessarly be circular, the charge of "circularity" appears usually to meân that the assumption is untrue and un- realistic and the theory therefore inapplicable. In this sense the marginal productivity theory of wages would appear to be less "circular" than the marginal productivity theory of interest, since the assumption that the marginal productivity of the worker is equated to the wage, would appear to be more probably generally true than that the marginal productivity of capital is equated to the rate of interest, because the former can more easily be done. Workers on short contracts can quickly be taken on or thrown off to adjust a divergence between the wage and marginal productivity, but such ad- justment cannot be made with capital sunk in machines of long life. On the other hand, to judge from the following quotation, the assumption of the marginal produc- tivity theory of wages (i. e. correct expectations as to the productivity of labour) is as unlikely and difficult as that of the marginal productivity theory of capital, which is therefore no more "circular" than the marginal productivity theory of wages. ,,The judgment or estimation as to the value of a man is a probability judgment of a complex nature, indeed. More or less based on experience and observation of the outcome of his predictions, it is doubtless principally after all simply an intuitive judgment or un- conscious induction, as one prefers." F.

In diesem Sinne ist auch die auf die sogenannte »Befriedigung gegenwärtiger Bedürfnisse4 gerichtete Verfügung eine Vorsorge für die allernächste Zukunft . . Z'1). It is precisely because they take no account of the uncertainty factor that the analysis of "rational" consumers' behaviour, and consumers' equili- brium", where people balance the utility of one more lump of sugar against one more biscuit seem so very fanciful and „wirklichkeitsfremd". It is not necessarily because the quantities discussed are too small. If one is con- fronted with a chocolate, a cigarette, an aspirin tablet, and a biscuit (or even smaller quantities) of known quality, to consume here and now , one can arrange them fairly definitely in an order. But unless one can perfectly foresee one's tastes this time to-morrow or next week, in what order one will prefer such small quantities when the time comes to consume them can only be forecasted in the very roughest way. The "perfect expectation" analysis of "rational" consumer's conduct is only very roughly applicable when, as is mostly the case, goods, first, take some time to consume, and secondly when the consumption is not begun as soon as the purchase is made, - since in the intervening period anything may happen to upset one's calculations2). IV. " Direct " and "Indirect" Expectations So far we have been using an over-simplified notion of "the period of consumption" of a good. We have been considering only what may be called the period of "direct consumption", - that is the period of time at the end of which the good or service is physically worn out or used up. But "the period over which an object yields consumption is not necessarily that of its own existence as a good"3). It has been pointed out that the "period of production" of a glass of beer may be construed as in one sense going back to the Creation. So the "period of consumption" may be construed as extending forwards to the Day of Judgment. Among the "net advantages" or dis- advantages of a glass of beer may be that, by making one's driving unsteady, it may involve one in a fatal motor smash, which will profoundly affect the lives of one's children, one's children's children and so ad infinitum. There is no need to resort to far-fetched examples to demonstrate that any of one's most trivial everyday actions, economic or otherwise, may have indefinitely far-reaching consequential ramifications. So far as people take them into consideration at all, their economic decisions will be affected by more or less vague expectations as to the possibility of such ramifications. The expectations then, on which any economic decision is based may concern literally any conceivable event in the future history of the world. But corresponding to the distinction between "direct" and "indirect" periods of consumption, it may have some clarificatory value to distinguish between "direct" and "indirect" factors in expectation. By " direct " factors in ex- pectation we mean expectation as to the bare physical and technical qualities of a good or service, - of a box of cigars, a machine, or the work of a labourer. Such qualities are always conceivably capable of physical measure- ment at the end of the direct period of consumption when the good or service *) cf. L.

On the other hand " indirect " factors in expectation may relate to any conceivable occurrence either during the period of "direct" consumption, or at any time after it. Obvious "indirect" factors in expectation in relation to consumption goods, are expectations as to the future of one's own tastes, and as to the future prices or obtainability of the goods if they are preservable, (cf. food-hoarding against expected shortage). As regards capital instruments and labour, obvious "indirect" factors are the expected future prices of the goods they produce, and of the labour or capital instruments with which they are technically required to cooperate in production; further, if there is any element of oligopoly (in the selling market), the future price policy of competitors may be considered. Finally it is clear that an individual's whole expenditure policy, and division of his income between "saving" and "consumption", may well depend on what he expects his income to be in the future, which depends on his expectations as to the future of general economic conditions in his country, which depends on his expectations as to the future economic and political history of the world. (Compare the Victorian attitude to the future of the world, and "saving", with that of to-day.) V. Perfect Expectation and Equilibrium Though in most expositions of the Theory of Value any discussion of expectations has been completely lacking, several writers have argued that some such postulate as "perfect expectation" is necessary for equilibrium theory1). On the other hand, Professor Morgenstern has shown2 that such a postulate may give a nonsensical indeterminate situation the very reverse of equilibrium. (Compare, for example, a game of chess in which both players foresaw each other's moves and tried to adjust their own accordingly, or else foresaw their own moves as well but by some fatal Cassandra-like compulsion were not able to alter them even if leading to defeat.) Professor Morgen- stern goes on to argue that the theory of equilibrium must somehow get on without this postulate if it is not to collapse in a contradiction, and com- ments „wie unüberlegt in der theoretischen Ökonomie oft von grundlegenden Annahmen dort gesprochen wird, wo es sich lediglich um Unsinn handelt". So far no attempt appears to have been made either to contest these con- clusions or to show how equilibrium theory can dispense with the "perfect expectation" postulate. It is important to notice that the "perfect expectation" postulate, or any other postulate about expectations, is not a postulate as to how people under conditions of equilibrium actually behave, but is introduced simply as an explanation of their behaviour. All expectations are "contained in" the demand and supply curves, and we can stop at these if we like. What is necessary for equilibrium is only that people behave in a certain way, - though what this way is has never been clearly described, - and it is no strictly necessary for the validity of the theory as such to go into the question as to how or why they should behave in this way, any more than it is with other hypo- thetical simplified examples. The case has been considered of a community producing and consuming only one commodity, - bananas8), - but it is not necessary to enter into the question as to how and why a community should *) cf.

There may be no satisfactory answer as to how or why they should behave in this way, - it is enough for the purposes of the simplified example that they do. If we find that people could not possibly behave in the simplified example, that is live solely on bananas, and be constituted like ourselves, the contradiction does not lie in the example as such, but in our procedure. We create certain conceptual automata "motivated" necessarily in a way different from ourselves and then, with unconscious anthropomorphism, try to ask them why it is they behave like that, while the only answer to such a question ultimately is that they do so because we make them when we define the position of equilibrium1). It is as though one was to sketch out the plans, or actually construct, - (as one could actually construct a mechanical model of a community in static equilibrium), - some piece of mechanism, - say a cuckoo clock, - and then ask the cuckoo whether it was because it had perfect expectation of the time that it appeared exactly at each hour. However as the equilibrium concept is designed to help in the explana- tion of people's behaviour as it is, and as "Gedankenexperimente" with extreme cases are sometimes useful for the analysis of the facts as they are, the anthropomorphising of the mechanical model by enquiry as to what expectation's or "motives" the behaviour of a equilibrium community could reasonably be correlated with, may possess some clarificatory value provided we keep in mind its ultimate contradictoriness, and the fact that people might behave in any particular way for any reasons, or without reasons at all. In any case if one does not attribute any particular expectations to someone, one can hardly call his conduct "sensible" or "rational". Expectations are correlated with behaviour in the market in accordance with the principle that people act in the way in which they expect will lead to the maximum returns. A person with perfect expectation is able at once to dispose of his resources in the way which will lead to the maximum returns, for his expectations will tell him certainly and unambiguously which line of conduct will lead to this result. This would not be possible where two or more people have perfect expectations about one another's conduct, and then try to adjust their own conduct in accordance with the maximum principle. A game of chess or bridge with all players having perfect ex- pectations of one another's play, and then adjusting their own, could not be played. The example might be put forward of two duopolists both of whom foresaw that the other possessed full knowledge of the theory of duopoly and was going to fix his price at the monopoly price, fixed their own prices at the monopoly price, and thus, in a certain sense, maximised their profits2). But this is not really a case of perfect expectation and consequent adjustment of conduct in accordance with the maximum principle. If one of the two duopolists perfectly foresees that his rival is going to fix his price at the monopoly price over a definite period of time, - if this is given to him, - he is not acting in accordance with the maximum principle in fixing his own price at the same level. If it is replied that he does not do this because he knows perfectly well that if he does not fix his own price at the monopoly price his rival will of course alter his correspondingly, then he had not *) The contradiction in this procedure emerges from Professor Knights discussion of static equilibrium. On pages 76 - 77 (op. cit.), his marionettes start as "normal human beings . . . familiar in a modern Western nation . . . acting with ordinary human motives . . . knowing what they want and seeking it intelligently."

Hutchison: originally perfect foresight as to his rival's price policy; for with perfect foresight he must have certainly known unconditionally his rival's price policy over the period of time in question. The impossibility of "monopolistic" conduct based on perfect expectations is not simply a high improbability but a logical impossibility, a self-contradictory paradox, like the Cretan saying that all Cretans are liars. A person's conduct cannot both be given to someone else who may adjust their own accordingly, and still be adjustable by the person himself. Perfect expectation, therefore, is incompatible, in an interdependent economic system, with people acting in the way they expect will maximise their profits, and, at the same time, more than one person adjusting his conduct in accordance with his (perfect) expectations of the others' conduct, - that is it is incompatible with more than one person acting "monopolistically"1) with perfect expectation. Perfect expectation is only compatible with "com- petitive" conditions, that is conditions were no one person's conduct can affect the conduct, and the result of the calculations on which it is based, of another2). If, then, the assumption of perfect expectations, which appears to be implicit in many formulations of the "Fundamental Principle", must be dropped for oligopolistic analysis, some other definite assumption about some sort of imperfect expectations and the correlated conduct must take its place, if any attempt at "explaining" oligopolists' conduct is to be made. One such assumption is that though people are acting under oligopolistic conditions, where each individual's conduct has some appreciable effect on price and market conditions, they none of them take the effects of their own conduct on their rivals' in any way into account3). That is they behave like bridge players who play the card which seems to them best without any considera- tion of the effects that their play has on the subsequent play of the other people at the table. Though such conduct may conceivably be "sensible" in the special sense of being based on the expectation that it will lead to the fulfillment of the maximum principle, it can hardly be called sensible in any less special sense of the term, nor does the assumption of it appear very realistic. The difficulty is simply that under oligopolistic conditions there is no one clear and ambiguous answer to the question "How would a sensible man act in such a situation?"4). Such a question is not very helpful. His action all depends on his necessarily imperfect expectations about the conduct of other people. Though one can argue vaguely a priori that some assumptions are more reasonable than others, if one wants to find out how, or on what expectations, oligopolists in fact behave, the only way is to "look and see". It cannot be directly deduced from some "Fundamental Principle", anymore *) cf. A. C. Pigou: op. cit., p. 87 - 88. The emphasis in recent years on the unity of the Theory of Value under competitive and monopolistic conditions and the unifor- mity of the basic assumptions is apt to conceal the fundamental distinction between "competitive" and "monopolistic" conduct. 2) This conclusion would appear to be in correspondence with the conclusion that under monopolistic conditions there is no determinate equilibrium, cf.

So far we have not attempted in discussing perfect expectation to decide whether or not it is the only condition of expectation which is reasonably correlatable with the behaviour of an individual or community in the con- dition of "equilibrium". On the one hand there are various possible con- ditions, which an individual or a community might be in, which might be called "equilibrium". On the other hand it is necessary to distinguish clearly between "perfect" expectation and simply " correct 19 and " undisappointed " ex- pectations. "Perfect", "correct", and "undisappointed" expectations appear often to have been used more or less interchangeably as a quality or even defining characteristic of equilibrium2). But, in quite ordinary senses of the words, "undisappointed" expectations may well not have been "correct", and "correct" expectations may well not have beeen "perfect". By "perfect" expecta- tion we mean, practically, omniscience about the future. A man with perfect ex- pectation must, at least, have certain knowledge about everything that is relevant to his decisions, - and this may possibly be anything in the whole future history of the world, - and he must at any rate know about everything else that it is irrelevant. On the other hand a man's expectations as to the results of a line of conduct may be quite correct &gt; and he may also expect that he will maximise his returns by adopting it, but he may not have heard of other possibilities which would be more profitable to him, and therefore, though his expectations about the line of conduct he adopts are quite " correct he is not acting in the most lucrative possible way. This kind of blissful ignorance is probably a common condition. The distinction between "correct" and "disappointed" expectations is of small importance. A man's expectations about the line of conduct he adopts may be quite correct, and he may get exactly what he counted on, but because in the meantime possibilities have been suggested to him of which he was ignorant before, he may be disappointed that he did not act in another way. But whether expectations are perfect or imperfect, correct or incorrect, undisappointed or disappointed, has nothing whatever to do, logically, with whether they are constant or changing , and on this depens whether or not there is any change in an individual's conduct or any endogenous change in an economic system. Expectations are constant when people believe that the expectations and the correlated conduct of the previous period will lead to the maximum returns in the next period. Whether expectations have just been incorrect or disappointed, or the reverse, does not imply either that they will be changed or held to, or, necessarily, that it would be "rational" to change or hold to them. Because of the tacit or explicit assumption of perfect expectation endogenous changes, in the usual exposition of equilibrium analysis, appear generally to be regarded as more or less automatic. When the assumption of perfect expectation is dropped it is seen that whether or l) This is apparently what Edgeworth had in mind when he said that normally under monopoly there is not a sufficient number of conditions to render economic equi- librium determinate, and that in a world of monopolies there would be no occupation for abstract economists who would have to make way for empiricists, cf. Collected Papers 1925, vol. I, p. 136 - 138. a) cf. J. R. Hicks: op. cit., p. 445: „Die Vorbedingung für Gleichgewicht in diesem weitesten Sinne ist vollständige Voraussicht. Ungleichgewicht ist somit die Ent- täuschung der Erwartungen." But if complete expectations cannot be disappointed, un- disappointed expectations may very well be incomplete. See also the quotation in the next footnote.</page><page sequence="11">646 T. W. Hutchison: not there is an endogenous change depends on the much less automatic factor of whether or not people's expectations are constant or not. If expectations are perfect they must necessarily also be correct, undisappointed, in "static" conditions constant, and in "dynamic" conditions changing. Further, people with perfect expectation must be in their "ma- ximum" position, that it could not obtain greater returns anywhere else. But if expectations are not perfect any combination of one of the alternatives from each of the pairs, correct or incorrect, undisappointed or disappointed, constant or changing, is possible. If we drop the division of "correct" expectations into disappointed and undisappointed, as being of little interest, this leaves 8 possible conditions of expectations and correlated con- duct, - 4 when people are actually in their "maximum" positions, and 4 when they are not: correct and constant, correct and changing, incorrect and con- stant, incorrect and changing. For if expectations are not perfect it is quite possible for someone to be in his "maximum" position, not realise it, be disappointed, and change. While in the world as it is nobody could be found with quite perfect expectations in our sense, a good number of people, pro- bably, could be found in each of the 8 "imperfect" conditions we have classified. Though it might well happen that an individual was in his "maximum" position more or less by accident, that is not having been led to it by perfect expectation, it is obviously fantastically improbable that all the members of a community could for any length of time be all in their respective maximum conditions by accident (without perfect expectation). We agree therefore, that, on the whole, perfect expectation is the most reasonable state of knowledge and expectation to be attributed to, or correlated with, that harmonious "optimum" condition which has always been the ideal of Economic Liberalism. We agree, further, that the term "equilibrium" is best reserved for this condition, but we do not agree with making "perfect expectation" a defining characteristic of it1). For this involves defining "equilibrium" not by the actions and conditions of an individual or community but by the knowledge which led them to these actions and conditions. It seems that "equilibrium" is best reserved for the "optimum maximum" condition whether or not the individual or community has been led to it by perfect expectation. VI. The Assumption of a "Tendency" Towards Equilibrium The position of equilibrium has always been the very central concept of economic analysis. The only justification for the special concern with this position and the treatment of disequilibrium as simply a temporary aberration from the normal, can be that, in fact, the economic conditions under which we live in some sense "tend" towards it. Professor Hayek goes as far as to say: "There seems to be no possible doubt that the only justification for this", (special concern with equilibrium analysis) "is the existence of a tendency towards equilibrium. It is only with this assertion that economics ceases to be an exercise in pure logic and becomes an em- pirical science"2). Is this, as a justification, satisfactory? We have seen that the only way to make sense of most formulations of the "Fundamental Assumption" is to add the assumption of perfect ex- pectation. With this assumption added we are assuming also at the same time *) cf. F. A. von Hayek: Economica, 1937, p. 41: "Correct foresight ... is a de- fining characteristic of equilibrium. *) ci. Jr. A. von nay en: op. cit., p. 4d.</page><page sequence="12">Expectation and Rational Conduct 647 permanent equilibrium under competitive conditions. The early writers regarded the equilibrium condition, - that is complete expectations, - as con- stantly at hand, as a position on which society was constantly verging1). Until fairly recently it was considered that if a comparison, was made bet- ween economic life and the water in a tank which is constantly being dis- turbed, but which would soon sink to a position of "rest" when the disturbance was removed, enough had been said to justify almost exclusive preoccupation with equilibrium analysis2). It was overlooked that it is an experimentally testable empirical truth that water sinks to an equilibrium level if left undis- turbed, while there is no corresponding empirical truth or even suggested experiment with regard to an economic system. To justify special preoccupa- tion with the position of equilibrium it is necessary to assert as an empiri- cally testable truth that there is a tendency towards this position in our economic system. But there is an ambiguity in speaking of a "tendency towards" a certain condition which is not always kept clear in this connection. It may mean that the position actually is regularly arrived at or approximated to, or it may simply mean that although there is a "tendency" towards this position this "tendency" is always counterbalanced by other "tendencies" which result in the position never in fact being reached at all, or even, necessarily, approached. This is the sense in which to-day most economists appear to speak of the tendency towards equilibrium. For example: "We make no assumption that final equilibrium is necessary. We assume that there are operative in different parts of the system certain tendencies which make for the restoration of an equilibrium in respect to certain limited points of reference. But we do not assume that the composite effect of these tendencies will necessarily be equilibrating"8). This interpretation of the assumption of a "tendency towards equi- librium" at once gives away the case for any special preoccupation with this condition rather than with any other conceivable condition of the economic system. There is no assumption, here, that we necessarily ever come anywhere near an equilibrium condition. One might assume that there was a "tendency", in this sense, for the population of England to dwindle to nothing, (though diseases, wars etc.), or to become indefinitely large, (through births and a falling death-rate etc.), or to attain to any other con- ceivable figure, - though of course the "tendencies" to these positions were always offset by opposing "tendencies". If, therefore, the special study of the equilibrium position, rather than any other conceivable position, is to be justified by the empirical truth of the assumption of a "tendency" towards equilibrium, this must mean a "tendency" in the former, significant , sense; that is, it must be the case that we are always in equilibrium or fairly often approximating to it to make a special study of it of particular interest4). At least one is entitled to expect of those who justify their special study of the equilibrium condition on the grounds, - in their usual rather metaphysical language, - that they are "examining in isolation a part of the forces acting *) cf. F. H. Knight: op. cit., p. 152. *) cf. J.B. Clark: The Distribution of Wealth, 1899, p. 279 and 408-409, by whom this rather question begging comparison was often used. 8) cf. L. Bobbins: Nature and Significance of Economic Science, 2nd edition, 1935, p. 102. ) Professor 'on Hayek (op. cit., p. 49) appears to hold, on the other hand, that the assumption of a tendency towards equilibrium is true in the former significant sense, i. e. that we are usually in, or interestingly near, equilibrium.</page><page sequence="13">648 T. W. Hutchison: in the real world", to give some empirical indication as to the "strength" of these forces under existing conditions as compared with the strength of the opposing "forces", or at least to make it clear that whether their analysis is of any conceivable application or interest depends on this issue. It is hardly a sufficient justification of equilibrium analysis, and completely begs the question of its applicability, to claim, - as someone analysing con- ditions in England with a population of 0, 1000, or 1000 million might claim, - that, though it is, of course, counteracted by opposing "tendencies" so that the condition never sets in or is necessarily approximated to, there is always a "tendency" towards it. The assumption of a tendency towards equilibrium implies, on the usual definition, the assumption of a tendency towards perfect expectations, competitive conditions, and the disappearance of money. To get anything like a precise answer to the question as to to what extent this assumption is true or untrue would require vastly complicated empirical investigations. Possibly it was nearer the truth in the 19th century than it is to-day. In some markets, obviously, expectations are more nearly perfect than in others. Probably the more "oligopolistic" markets become the less perfect expectations become, for then there is an important addition to the number of factors about which, up till now, at any rate, only fairly uncertain expectations can be formed, - the behaviour of rival oligopolists. The lengthening of the pro- cesses of production would also probably increase uncertainty and dis- equilibrium. On the other hand, there is, on the whole probably, a tendency for communities to learn which does more than simply keep pace with the changes in conditions. But whether ultimately, if more correct prognoses come to be made, these will not defeat their own end by themselves bringing about further changes and thus rendering themselves false, whether or how far, that is, there is a determinate relation between the prognoses of social science and the social facts, remains an open sociological question, which can hardly be of more than speculative interest until there is more data in the form of recognised and disseminated economic and sociological prognoses. VII. "Subjective" and " Objective Rationality " The "Fundamental Assumption" as usually formulated, if it is to have any sense, must be supplemented by the assumption of perfect expectation. The element in the "Fundamental Assumption" thus formulated, in the Economic Man, in the "maximum principle" and the like, applicable to a world with any uncertainty and imperfect foresight, that is to a world in which any economic , as against perhaps simply technical problems may be said to exist, is the principle that people act in the way they expect will maximise their returns, profits, or net advantages. Everybody is, in this sense, "subjectively" rational, - though we use this term only at once to suggest that it is misleading and unsuitable. How far people act in an "objectively" rational way must remain quite indefinite; because, in the first place, in a world full of uncertainty, and with economic science still able to afford very little guidance, most decisions in economic life have to be taken without re- course to anything which can suitably be called "objective rationality" - though it is in accordance with some such objective criterion or other that the term is applied to expectations, or the process of arriving at them, in every day life. A complete "objective rationality" in economic conduct requires a complete economic science, which can tell one with "certainty" exactly what the effects of one decision or the other will be, and even then</page><page sequence="14">Expectation and Rational Conduct 649 a sceptic can argue that it is not necessarily "rational" to act even in accordance with the most confirmed and certain of scientific prognoses. Nor can the calculus of probability, rather vaguely appealed to by Bentham and subsequent writers, be of the slightest assistance in most economic decisions, for there is simply no basis for any sort of calculation1). Judgments as to the "objective rationality" or "irrationality" of economic conduct can only be fragmentary and negative, apart from the cases where people act in a way which according to their own stated expectations, or the direct logical impli- cations ex definitione contained in them, will lead to less than maximum possible returns, - in which case they may be said not even to be acting with what we have called subjective rationality. This Law of Motivation2), as the principle of "subjective rationality" may more suitably be called, is undoubtedly the core of empirical truth in the Economic Man and similar generalisations about human conduct. Though we agree that there is no principle of any considerable significance that will serve as a basis for a realistic deductive economic theory, we do not, therefore, precisely agree that there is no such principle at all. It appears an empirically true and testable generalisation that every- body acts in the way in which they expect will maximise their returns, even if this was only the ex post rationalisation of their habits. This generalisation could, if it was worth while, be more precisely formulated and a more precise method of testing it be given. Roughly, one can test it simply by asking anyone whether they expect that if they were to employ their money or resources in any other way than that in which they are at the moment doing or about to do, they would increase their returns. If they reply that they do expect that they would increase their returns, - understood, if one likes, in the widest sense to include the "satisfaction" of the masochist and altruist, - by employing their resources in another way, then they are offending against the principle of "subjective rationality" or the Law of Motivation. But it would appear a waste of time for an economist, at any rate, to attempt to define this principle more precisely as the significant content of such a generalisation as a fundamental assumption for a deductive economic theory is in any case negligible. One can, of course, drawn the usual conclusions that people will balance expected marginal cost against expected marginal gain, and will have no tendency to change their conduct when the expected marginal return from resources in each direction is equal^nd so on. But out of an almost circular postulate only almost circular conclusions can be drawn. The orthodox "perfect expectation". Theory of Value was all more or less empty when it was based on the assumption that everyone maximised their utility, because of the difficulty in defining this term in any but a more or less circular and empty way. On the other hand the principle seemed to have some content and to permit of deductions of some content with regard to the behaviour of entrepreneurs , and their price, production, wage, and employment policies. For without too great inaccuracy entrepreneurs might be said to aim at maximising their money profits which seemed a definite enough criterion to decide their policies. Looked at ex post, profits are a fairly definitely calculable sum. As however it is clearly not the "objective" resulting ex post profits, but the "subjective" ex ante expectations which determine entrepreneurs policy, and which are, in a common metaphor, the "mainspring" of economic activity, unless one makes a *) cf.

H. 42</page><page sequence="15">650 T. W. Hutchison: definite assumption about expectations, "maximising profits" is quite an empty conception telling one nothing about how entrepreneurs will in fact behave. With the assumption of perfect expectation no relevant distinction between ex post and ex ante profits existed, next year's profits being as definitely and objectively known as last year's. But dropping the assumption of complete expectations the problem remains as to what expectations people hold and how they come to hold them. To make assumptions as to ex- pectations and therefore as to conduct, unless these assumptions are em- pirically confirmed is, in dealing with economic problems, fundamentally to beg the question and assume what one wants to find out, which is always just what people's expectations and correlated behaviour in different situa- tions are1). It has long been recognised that when economists assume that people behave "rationally" no assumption is made as to the nature of the goods, - bread, opium, bibles, or instruments of self-torture, - which it is "rational" to choose, - no such distinction being feasible. Similarly, (as we have argued), no generalisation is possible either as to what is the, in some sense, ob- jectively rational way of arriving at one's expectations, or either as to how people do, in fact, arrive at their expectations that one line of expenditure will yield them better returns than another. Whether, and to what extent, entrepreneurs behave "competitively" or "monopolistically"2), whether and to what extent people's decisions are dominated by present prices as against the whole expected future course of prices, to what extent people's economic actions are taken on the spur of the moment or according to a detailed plan, how far people come to any particular expectation at all or act unreflectingly according to habit, to what extent people learn from past economic mistakes and disappointments, how and to what extent people behave in any way one chooses to call objectively rational, are questions which cannot be answered by any general "Fundamental Assumption" or "Principle". Although in some cases rough a priori reasoning may yield results which turn out accurately, ultimately all such questions as these can only be decided by extensive empirical investigation of each question individually. The Law of Motivation says nothing about how people behave in any market, nor anything about the expectations or the process of arriving at the expectations correlated with behaviour in the market. It only says something as to how people will react if questioned in a particular way as to their behaviour in the market. It is however an empirical generalisation capable of being tested empirically and conceivably of being falsified, possessing there- fore some empirical content, however insignificant this may be. It is not simply an empirically empty definition, which is what is sometimes offered as a "Fundamental Principle" of economic conduct. VIII. The "Fundamental Assumption" as a Definition Since the revolution in the Theory of Value of 1871 economists have been trying to formulate a fundamental "maximum" principle of economic conduct applicable to consumers, to take the place of the Ricardian Business- man guided only by the desire for money-profits. To render this principle not obviously false they have had steadily to widen it, and thus to diminish its empirical content. First it had to be agreed that it was not necessarily "rational" for the consumer to seek to maximise merely his material wealth, - x) cf. G. M y rd al: op. cit., p. 437. «) Cf. A.C. Pi g ou: op. cit., p. 87- 88.</page><page sequence="16">Expectation and Rational Conduct 651 "spiritual" wealth must also be included. Then, in order to elude the charge of 'hedonism", the conduct of altruists and masochists had to be admitted as "rational". The economic principle thus became less and less falsifiable1). Fewer and fewer, if any, types of economic conduct remained which were not subsumed under it, and almost none were excluded or could falsify it. Its empirical content therefore, simultaneously grew smaller and smaller. To say that a piece of economic conduct was "rational" came to mean little, if anything, more than that it was a piece of economic conduct. The cruder classical generalisations about the ubiquity of the money-making motive, though in a probably high percentage of cases false, did have some empirical significance. Finally it was openly stated that the "Fundamental Principle" . was not conceivably falsifiable and devoid of all empirical content, a cir- cularity, a matter of definition, a linguistic proposal. It was assumed or stated that everybody behaves "rationally" or "sensibly" and "rationally" or "sensibly" was defined as how people do in fact behave. All economic con- duct is ex definitione rational or sensible. It would be contradictory to speak of "irrational" economic conduct2). It is sometimes argued, even when it is thus stated as a circularity or definition, that the Fundamental Assumption cannot be empty because of all that economists have succeeded in deducing out of it3). Certainly its being a circularity does not preclude any number of deductions being made from it. But all the propositions thus deduced will be equally circular and empirically empty. If the "Fundamental Assumption" that everybody acts rationally is circular, so is the proposition that people balance marginal cost against marginal gain circular, and all the further deductions will simply be different ways of saying that people behave "rationally", that is as they do behave. If one thinks it worth while, one can say that people behave as they do behave in as many different ways as one likes, but one will not learn any- thing about their behaviour for the empirical content of the assumption and all the conclusions will be the same, - that is nothing. "From a tautology only tautologies follow"4). With a definition there is no question of verifiability or falsifiability. One can, if one likes, say "Economic conduct = National' or 'sensible' eco- nomic conduct. Def.," if one is consistent in this linguistic usage. As a terminological suggestion, however, it simply seems superfluous, inappropriate, and misleading. It is superfluous, because if one takes economic behaviour as given one's task is to analyse it as it is, and there is no point in adding the adjective "rational" or "sensible", which is by definition purely redundant. It is inappropriate because we all know, - and this is often particularly emphasised precisely by those who insist that all economic conduct is or x) For the relation between falsifiability and empirical content, cf. K. Popper: Logik der Forschung, 1934, p. 13 and 43. Popper brings out very clearly that it is the function of a scientific law to „forbid" some conceivable types of occurrence: „Nicht umsonst heißen die Naturgesetze »Gesetze*. Sie sagen um so mehr, je mehr sie verbieten." A circularity or tautology „forbids" nothing. It is „true" whatever occurs, and therefore empirically empty, cf. also, C.G. Hem pel and P. Oppenheim: Der Typusbegriff im Lichte der neuen Logik, Leiden 1936, p. 105 - 106: „Typologische Systeme, in denen keine denkbare Misch- form der zugrunde gelegten Typenmerkmale als empirisch ausgeschlossen bezeichnet wird, enthalten überhaupt keine empirischen Gesetze und haben daher nicht den Cha- rakter wissenschaftlicher Theorien." 2) cf.

Hutchison: "must be" rational, - that, in the everyday "objective" sense of the terms, much economic conduct is the very reverse of "rational" or "sensible". Lastly it is misleading because it may appear that some generalisation of empirical content is being made about economic conduct from which conclusions of empirical content may be deduced, while all that is being done is to set out a definition. In defence of this terminology it has been suggested that it is necessary to make it clear in this way that the "Fundamental Principle" of Economics is in no sense a value utterance exalting any one type of economic conduct above another1). But it is not clear, to say the least, why in order to exclude value utterances concerning one piece of economic behaviour as compared with another, it is necessary to deliver what, in appearance at any rate, is a sweeping and vague value utterance about all economic behaviour. It is like suggesting that a book-reviewer not wishing to deliver himself of value- utterances, cannot content himself with simply giving an account of books and the facts about them, but must insist that all books are, and must be, by definition "good", or "rational" and "sensible", books. IX. A Methodological Conclusion A broader methodological conclusion would appear to follow from the above. In so far as one is dissatisfied with "static", a-monetary analysis, omitting the uncertainty factor, - which alone may be said to create any problems of conduct, economic or otherwise, - the method of deduction from some "Fundamental Assumption" or "principle" concerning economic conduct is more or less useless, because no relevant "Fundamental Assumption" can, on our present knowledge, be made. The use of euch a method of the de- duction of chains of "conclusions" from some "Fundamental Assumption", only seemed applicable so long as a more or less tacit assumption as to expectations was being made. When assumptions as to expectations are more or less explicitly introduced there come the accusations of "circularity" "begging the question", and "assuming what one requires to prove", which have been a rather conspicuous feature of recent controversies over the Theory of Money and Employment, and in the development of some kind of "dynamic" pure theory. According to Professor Hayek2) the immediately pressing questions in this field are how entrepreneurs react to the expectations of particular price-changes, how the expectations of entrepreneurs are formed, and how given price-changes in the present affect entrepreuneurs expectations. Clearly the answers to such questions cannot be deduced from some "Fundamental Assumption", or conjectured at all accurately a priori. They are questions of economic psychology to which an answer will be sought in vain from those who, satisfied with a few empty Hedonist-Utilitarian phrases, preach a psychological Economics without Psychology. If one wants to find out the answer to such questions one must admit with Richard Jones: "I really know of but one way to obtain our object, and that is to look and see"3). Before there can be any "more realistic" analysis some idea must be formed of what the "more realistic" assumptions are on which it is to be based4), *) cf. L. Robbins: op. cit.. p. 93. 8) Nationalokonomisk Tidskrift, 1935, p. 191. 8) Literary Remains, 1859, p. 569, quoted by H. Wagenführ: Der System- gedanke in der Nationalökonomie, 1933, p. 160. 4) O.

The objection has been made to statistical investigations, questionnaires to consumers and entrepreneurs, the examination of family budgets and the like, that the results of such arduous researches are subject to a high degree of inaccuracy, can easily be "cooked", and in any case would not tell us much that we did not know already1). The answer to such an objection is quite simple. If, as one is perfectly free to do, one considers that the results, obtainable by the only possible scientific method open to one are not of sufficient interest to reward the effort of investigation, then one must give up the scientific handling of these problems altogether and leave them to others of different intellectual taste. *) F.
