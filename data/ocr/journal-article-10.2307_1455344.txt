<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW, LXXXI, Nos. 3-4 (January-April, 1991) 494-495 RADICE AND RUNIA'S PHILO OF ALEXANDRIA* At last we have a splendidly comprehensive and fully annotated bibliography of Philo of Alexandria for the years 1937-1986. The core of this work is the Philo bibliography that was compiled by the noted Philonist Roberto Radice and appeared in Italian in 1983 under the title Filone di Alessandria: bibliografia generale 1937-1982. In 1986, David Runia, whose landmark work Philo of Alexandria and the Timaeus of Plato was published in that same year, imme- diately establishing him as one of the leading experts on Philo, suggested to Radice that the Italian work be translated into English and be brought up to date, so that it would cover half a century of Philonic studies. The suggestion was happily heeded and the book under review is the result of the close collaboration of these two scholars. Used in conjunction with the great Philo bibliography of H. G. Goodhart and E. R. Goodenough, published in 1938 and reprinted by Georg Olms in 1967, it provides the student of Philo with all the bibliographical data that he needs. It includes publications written in English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, Dutch, Latin, and Hebrew, and even lists reviews of those monographs that are specifically devoted to Philo. The material is organized in two sections: Part 1 includes bibliographies, editions, translations, anthologies, commentaries, indices, lexica, and the separate journals devoted to Philonic studies. Part 2 contains critical studies of Philo and related subjects, chrono- logically arranged, and in addition includes a brief listing of titles dating to 1987- 88. Six indices of authors, reviewers, biblical and Philonic passages, subjects, and Greek terms, conclude the work. Although the present work supersedes Louis Feldman's well-known Scholarship on Philo and Josephus, 1937-1962, the latter work's section on Philo retains its usefulness, for unlike the studied neutrality of Radice and Runia, it presents the author's own evaluations of the literature, including desiderata in the study of Philo, and organizes the material thematically. As Runia points out in his valuable introduction, in the fifty years period covered by this work there have been 1,666 separate studies pertaining to Philo, considerably more than the 1,120 studies collected by Goodhart and Goodenough for the entire period up to 1937. The explosion in Philonic studies began in 1960 and was largely stimulated by the French translation project of Philo's writings that was begun in 1961. Runia further notes that in 1937-46 German scholarship led the field; by 1977-86 it had been overtaken by the English, French, and Italian contributions. Moreover, after a long period of neglect, Jewish scholars are finally taking part in Philonic research. The fact remains, however, that very few Israeli * Roberto Radice and David T. Runia.

It is to be regretted that interest in Philo from the perspective of philosophy has declined somewhat in recent decades. Harry Wolfson's stimulus in this regard is clearly reflected in the percentages during the decades 1947-56 and 1957-66. The authors have invited reviewers to indicate to them items that should have been included but were not. I offer the following list, arranged chronologically: Joseph Klausner, Me-Aplaton 'ad Spinoza [From Plato to Spinoza] (Jerusalem: Hosa'at Mada', 1955), pp. 77-120; Monford Harris, "Marriage as Metaphysics: A Study of the 'Iggeret ha-Qodesh," HUCA 33 (1962): 197-220; Ch. Albeck, Einleitung und Register zum Bereschit Rabba, Teil I: Einleitung, pp. 84-88 (con- stitutes the second half of volume 3 of Midrash Bereshit Rabbah, ed. J. Theodor and Ch. Albeck [2nd corrected printing; Jerusalem: Wahrmann Books, 1965]); Abraham J. Heschel, Torah min ha-Shamayim be-Aspaqlariah shel ha-Dorot [=Theology of Ancient Judaism] (London &amp; New York: The Soncino Press, 1965), 2:161-165; Arthur Marmorstein, The Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God, 2: Essays in Anthropomorphism (reprinted New York, Ktav, 1968; first published in 1937), pp. 1-22, 150-157; Joseph P.

Brill, 1975), pp. 43-59; Alexander Broadie, A Samaritan Philosophy: A Study of the Hellenistic Cultural Ethos of the Memar Marqah (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1981). The author attempts to show that Marqah's philosophical system "bears a striking resemblance to the Alexandrian Hellenism of Philo Judaeus"; David L. Balch, Let Wives Be Submissive: The Domestic Code in I Peter (Chico: Scholars Press, 1981); Willy Theiler, Poseido- nios: Die Fragmente (Berlin, NY: Walter De Gruyter, 1982); vol. 2 contains numerous references to Philo; James W. Thompson, The Beginnings of Christian Philosophy: The Epistle to the Hebrews (CBQM 13; Washington, DC: Catholic Biblical Association of America, 1982); Julia Annas and Jonathan Barnes, The Modes of Scepticism (Cambridge: University Press, 1985); Terence Callan, "Prophecy and Ecstasy in Greco-Roman Religion and in 1 Cor.," Novum Testa- mentum 27 (1985): 125-40; Samuel Belkin, In His Image (London, New York: Abelard Schuman, n.d.). The authors of this superb bibliography are to be congratulated on a difficult and tedious job meticulously and scrupulously performed. Philonic scholarship is greatly advanced by the appearance of this work. Graduate Theological Union DAVID WINSTON</page></plain_text>
