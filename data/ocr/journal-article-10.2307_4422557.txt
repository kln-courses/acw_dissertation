<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO CEREMONIAL MACE HEADS FROM COSTA RICA IN a small archaeological series presented to the Museum in 1954 by Mr. Neil McQueen, through the good offices of Mr. Fisher of the Hancock Museum, Newcastle, are two ceremonial mace heads of great interest. They belong to a type of object described by the Swedish archaeologist, C. V. Hartmann, who published a number of similar specimens from an ancient burial ground at Las Guacas, near Nicoya in Costa Rica.' They consist of spherical heads drilled for hafting on to shafts about 3 in. thick. The drilling has been undertaken from both ends and there is a slight constriction in the bore similar to that found on certain European neolithic axe heads. In this class of object one side is expanded into a large boss which is carved in the form of a head, either anthropomorphic or zoomorphic. Mr. Hartmann records and illustrates human heads, skulls (which he compares with small death's-head type amulets of Aztec period), and various animal and bird forms. The first British Museum specimen has a suggestion of the death's-head in the form of the large deep-set orbits, drilled with a tubular drill, but the representa- tion of ears and of lips, and of a nose in which the alae are clearly indicated by two small triangles with drill marks in the centre, make this attribution unlikely. It seems probable that the orbits were originally filled with some inlay, possibly gold or iron pyrites or shell. The lower part of the face is occupied by the widely open jaws of a feline animal complete with incisor teeth and four large overlap- ping canines. Between the jaws is the head of a small animal. Liberal use has been made of a drill to excavate the space inside the mouth. Two borings, one from each side, delimit the inside edges of the upper canine teeth and four converging drill holes, two on each side of the small animal, give an indication of a cavernous mouth. Whether the being depicted is human or animal is uncertain, but the face is surmounted by a rectangular cap or plate. This combination of the rectangular cap and the long curved canine teeth may be of value in tracing the cultural con- nexions of these objects. The cult of ferocious feline deities is almost universal in both Central and South America, being found among the Maya, in the La Venta culture in the province of Vera Cruz, at San Augustin in Colombia, in Chavin, 26</page><page sequence="2">Cupisnique, Moch6 Nasca, and many other sites in Peru. The small rectangular plaque, however, would suggest a definite link, however tenuous, with the Olmec or La Venta culture where both feline masks and masks bearing a small rect- angular plaque on the forehead are characteristic. Pottery designs have been shown in many cases to have been introduced by Nicoya people from the valley of Mexico far to the north, and it is not unreasonable to assume that the culture of La Venta, which is considerably nearer and which has profoundly influenced the Maya, may also have influenced Costa Rica. The macabre skull-like appearance may perhaps be due to the convergence of ideas since very similar specimens, illustrated by Hartman, are obviously skulls, but the resemblance is more prob- ably fortuitous, being due to the use of tubular drills of relatively large diameter for most of the work. The smaller specimen, which belongs to the same general class of mace head, is a human head very much conventionalized, with what appears to be a beard spreading from the ears to the chin. Like the first example, it wears a small rectangular plaque, with two lateral ridges slightly emphasized, and it also re- sembles the first specimen in the similar treatment of the alae of the nose, but in other respects there is no stylistic resemblance whatsoever. Eyes in the accepted sense do not exist at all; their place is taken by a deep wide groove right across the forehead, the presence of eyes being suggested by the heavy shadows cast by the overhanging upper edges of the groove. The pendulous semi-lunar shapes im- mediately below the groove are not in fact eyes, as one might expect at first sight, but cheeks. Below the cheeks and nose are two shallow grooves and one deep groove, similar to that which represents the eyes, forming the mouth. The effect of this unusual treatment is to produce a slightly sinister, though not unpleasing, face. The importance of this mace-head lies, however, not so much in its aesthetic value as in the light it throws on the decoration of polished jade amulets from Nicoya. Two examples from the British Museum Collection are shown; the most important part of the decoration of these is the use of transverse grooves of vary- ing widths which represent the eyes and nose of a human face. Immediately be- low, in both these specimens, is an inverted triangle which is clearly a beard. Beards are excessively rare among American Indians; on the other hand both Central and South American legends are copiously supplied with references to bearded strangers who were generally the introducers of higher cultures. While we would not be warranted in regarding the presence of beards on these amulets and on the mace head as potential proof of the legends, they do, however, lend weight to their claims to be considered seriously.
