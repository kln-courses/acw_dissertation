<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lyndsay Coo Polydorus and the Georgics: Virgil Aeneid 3.13-68* third book of the Aenäd opens with thè «grim and weird story of Polydorus»,1 an enigmatic épisode «whose very présence is still puzzling to scholars». 2 1 hope to show that the Polydorus épisode has fre- quently been misunderstood and to offer a new explanation for exactly what it is that Virgil here describes. More broadly I shall demonstrate how in this passage Virgil both alludes to his own previous work and expects his reader to understand the allusion. In the Polydorus épisode, Virgil unîtes the plants cornei and myrtle, which are conjoined only once elsewhere in his poetry, at G. 2.447-448. Though this fact has been widely remarked, its significance and the subtle relationship between the Polydorus épisode and Georgics 2 have gone entirely unnoticed. There are in fact clear signs that Virgil hoped for readers to come to Aeneid 3 having paid close attention to his agricultural writings, and that those who did would benefit from a deeper insight into and un- derstanding of the epic text. 3 Polydorus' mound is a tumulus, quo cornea summo I uirgulta et densis hastilibus hornda myrtus (Aen. 3.22-23). Cornei and myrtle join only once elsewhere in Virgil, where they are also associated with spears: at myrtus ualidis hastilibus et bona bello I corna [se. fecundae sunt] (G. 2.447-448). A dose reader of the Georgics will thus, upon reaching this second pairing in the Aeneid, be able to make the correct connection between plants * This paper originateci as an essay submitted for the degree of Master of Phi- losophy at Cambridge in Aprii 2007.

However, Virgil reverses both the reader's expectations and the laws of nature: instead of the norm of plants being turned into weapons, we find that wooden weapons hâve been transformed back into plants. Myrtle also reveals itself to be doubly appropriate for the situation described. Aeneas sets thè scene in litore (Aen. 3.21), which in the Georgics is said to be thè naturai flowering-place of myrtle, with shore and plant each described as loving the other: litora myrtetis hetissima (G. 2.112), amantis litora myrtos (G. 4.124). l It was this affinity with the shore that led to myrtle's special association with sea-born Venus, a bond portrayed by Virgil at G. 1.28 and G. 2.64. 2 It is therefore fully appropriate for Aeneas, sacrificing to Venus on thè sea-shore, to wish to decorate the altars with his mother's shore-loving plant. We should note that Venus is only hère in the Aeneid called Dionaeae (Aen. 3.19), an epithet which specifically recalls her marine origin as a daughter of the Oceanid Dione.3 The association of myrtle with shore and Venus thus explains both why it is found in this particular area and why Aeneas should wish to uproot it as an offering: once more, in order to understand the Aeneid' s events, we are referred back to the Georgics. The plants of this épisode are thus the first dues that signal a passage in which close knowledge of the Georgics will benefit the reader. The making of naturai material into weapons is a trope for the de- generation of man's relationship with nature and we might therefore expect the opposite to hâve positive connotations. However it appears that thèse spears hâve retained both their ability to wound and their association with blood. When Aeneas pulls the shafts from the buried body of Polydorus, blood flows just as when, elsewhere in the Aeneid, a spear is pulled from a wound.4 These shafts are therefore still spears: they have not entirely returned to their naturai state, but hâve become Irving, growing weapons. The blood welling from the stems' uprooting thus points to an inescapable conclusion: the spears are still connected to Polydorus' body. They are flowing with, and nourished by, his blood, and, when pulled out, create bleeding wounds in his corpse. 5 This point 1 R. A. B. Mynors, Virgil: Georgics, Oxford 1990, p. 116 adds also the examples of Ov. Am. 1.1.29 (Utorea ... myrto) and Mart. 4.13.6. (litora myrtus amat). 2 Also at Bue. 7.62 and Aen. 5.72. 3 Hes. Th. 353· 4 At Aen. 10.486-487, when Pallas tears thè spear from his breast, una eademque uia sanguis animusque sequuntur. 5 The situation is therefore not comparable to that at Ov. Met. 2.359-366 (as stated by e.g. E. Norden, P. Vergilius Maro Aeneis Buch vi, Leipzig-Berlin 19162, p. 169; R. D. Williams, op. cit., p. 60; and R. A. Smith, Poetic Allusion and Poetic Embrace in Ovid and Virgil, Ann Arbor 1997, pp. 104-115) where broken branches bleed because the Heliades hâve turned into poplars; Polydorus has not become a myrtle bush. There is thus less</page><page sequence="3">Virgil Aeneid 3.13-68 195 has been widely missed, and many commentators hâve assumed, with Servius, that mùisse radiées iacula mirum est (Serv. Dan. 0^3.46). However the spears hâve not spread out roots into the soil, but radier are 'rooted* in the very corpse of the prince, and their removal produces the same blood and pain as the wrenching of spears from a live body. * Closer attention to Polydorus' own words would hâve shown this: firstly, his exclamation quid miserum, Aenea, laceras? (Aen. 3.41) spécifies the miser Polydorus, rather than the myrtles, as the object of Aeneas' violence. Aeneas is tearing spears directly from thè stili sentient body of Polydorus and it is this, not the mere fact of the plants* removal, which causes pain. Secondly, non me tibi Troia I externum tulit aut cruor hic de stipite manat {Aen. 3.42-43) explicitly states that the welling blood originates not from the plants themselves but from Polydorus' body.2 Thirdly he was confixum (Aen. 3.45): the spears were ail fixed into him. To sum up, then: the spears are still connected to Polydorus, from of the Hellenistic 'metamorphosis-theme' in this épisode than some critics suggest (see also A. Hollis, Hellenistic Colounng in Virgil's Aeneid, «Harv. Stud. Class. Philol.» 94, 1992, p. 283). We might note that Servius ad 3.46 défends Virgil's invention hère by référence to the legend of Romulus' spear which took root on the Palatine, but the comparison is inexact. Romulus' spear metamorphosed into a flowering plant by itself ; the Thracian spears hâve drawn their life-force from Polydorus' corpse. 1 See R. Heinze, VirgiL· epische Technik, Leipzig-Berlin 19153, p. 107, who talks of «das Mitleid mit dem armen Gemordeten, der selbst im Tode noch Schmerzen leidet, dessen Leib wie der eines Lebenden zerrissen wird». There is perhaps a subtle rela- tionship here with both Pacuvius' Riona and Lucretius D. R. N. 3.879-881. In the latter, Lucretius dérides the man sibi cumproponit quisquefuturum, I corpus uti uolucres lacèrent in morte feraeque, I ipse sui müeret. This responds precisely to a speech in Pacuvius' Üiona (fr. 146 Schieri), where the ghost of Deipylus - whom his father Polymestor had murdered, believing him to be Polydorus - accuses his mother Iliona of not pitying him (neque te mei miser et) and begs her for burial prius quamferae I uolucresque. . . (the rest of thè line is unknown, but the sense is clear: he seeks proper interment before beasts and birds devour his corpse). For discussion of Lucretius' parody of Pacuvius in this passage, see B. R Wallach, Lucretius and the Diatnbe against the Fear of Death, De Rerum Natura in, 830-1094, Leiden 1976, pp. 34-35, and Eadem, Deiphilus or Polydorus? The Ghost in Pacuvius' Riona, «Mnemosyne» 32, 1979, p. 138. Hardie (in Idem, Virgil's Aeneid: Cosmos and Impenum, Oxford 1986), has argued for Virgil's imitation and subversion of Lucretius, and Polydorus fits the pattern: the fears mocked by Lucretius are shown not to be so groundless after all, since Polydorus' pierced corpse can still bleed and feel pain (quid miserum ... lacerasi, Aen. 3.41). Virgil's Polydorus thus manifests the fears of his Pacuvian counterpart as if in response to Lucretius' dérision. 2 Following C. G. Heyne, R. D. Williams, op. cit., pp. 62-63 translates «I am no stranger to you, for Troy gave me birth; and this welling blood is not coming from wood». This is to be preferred to the alternative reading, supplying externus to cruor, of J. C.Jahn, followed byj. Conington, P. Vergili Maronis Opera, Vol. 11, London 1863, p. 191 (an interprétation which N. Horsfall, Virgil, Aenddy. A Commentary, Leiden 2006, p. 74 deems «not impossible, but unnecessary once the point of de stipite is grasped»). Polydorus' point is twofold - he is a Trojan, and it is his body 's blood which flows - and the statement of his nationality does not demand répétition.</page><page sequence="4">196 Lyndsay Coo whose blood they have derived their life-force. What is the significance of VirgiTs portraying the plants1 growth in such a manner? We might approach an answer by examining closely the vocabulary of the passage. A notable feature of this épisode is thè use of words whose true meanings are only gradually revealed as the discovery of Polydorus is made. Thus what appears to be a naturai tumulus ('mound') at Aen. 3.22 is re-interpreted as a funerary tumulus ('tomb') at 40 and 63, and the naturai hastilia of 23 and 37 are revealed to be military hastilia or iacula at 46. Aeneas pulls up stems to cover thè altars (tegerem ut, 25) but finds that he is destroying another covering, the weapons which «covered» (texit, 45) Polydorus. The mound is literally hornda ('bristling', 23) with shafts, but will reveal a horrendum monstrum (26) and horror (29). Newly- acquired knowledge thus forces the reader to read retrospectively a sinister meaning into what had initially appeared neutral terms. On the level of Aeneas as narrator, he, knowing thè outcome of thè story, employs (whether deliberately or subconsciously) vocabulary which points towards the true significance of the situation. We should not be surprised, then, to find instances of word-play in this épisode. * With this in mind, we might finally be able to make sense of obtrun- cat (Aen. 3.55) which has troubled inconsistency-hunters since at least Servius.2 Given the text's emphasis on the spécifie manner of Polydorus' murder - by spear - thè use of obtruncare, with its naturai connotations of death by sword, has rightly been feit to jar.3 There have been various attempts at explanation, none entirely satisfactory. D. Biow4 sees the verb as deliberately echoing the death of Priam, whom Neoptolemus obtruncat ad aras (Aen. 2.663) and left ingens litore truncus, I auuhumque umeris caput (Aen. 2.557-558). Thus, Biow argues, the youngest son as- sumes in death the same metaphorical fate as his father, lying beheaded on the sea-shore. Though Priam is inevitably echoed, it is nonetheless 1 On word-play here, see also B. Grassmann-Fischer, Die Prodigien in Vergib Aeneü, Munich 1966, pp. 93-94; J. J. O'Hara, True Nantes: Vergil and the Alexandrian Tradition of Etymological Wordplay, Ann Arbor 1996, p. 136; and M. Paschalis, Virgil's Aeneid: Semantic Relations and Proper Nantes, Oxford 1997, pp. 111-116. 2 Serv. ad 3.55 glosses obtruncat here as occidit, saying nam obtruncare proprie est capite caedere; see also Serv. Dan. ad 3.46. The inconsistency has been discussed most recently by S. Casali, Correcting Aenea's Voyage: Ovid's Commentary on Aeneidj, «Trans. Amer. Phüol. Assoc.» 137, 2007, pp. 181-210, who calls Ovid «the first surviving Vergil- ian critic to notice the contradiction between the two versions of Polydorus' death in the Aeneid» (p. 188). 3 In its strittest sense, obtruncare means 'beheacT or Ίορ off someone's limbs', and even when used in its wider sense of 'kill' is the implication 'with a sword', thè es- sential point being that thè body is left like a truncus; see S.

Why, then, did Virgil choose a word which sits uncomfortably in its context?1 I suggest that the answer may be found not in the Aeneid but in the Georgics. Shortly into the second book of the Georgics, Virgil turns to the subjects of budding and grafting: nam qua se medio trudunt de cortice gemmae et tenuis rumpunt tunica s, angustus in ipso fit nodo sinus; hue aliena ex arbore germen includunt udoque docent inolescere libro, aut rursum enodes tranci resecantur, et alte finditur in solidum cuneis uia, deinde feraces plantae immittuntur: nec longum tempus, et ingens exiit ad caelum ramis felicibus arbos, miratastque nouas frondes et non sua poma. (G. 2.74-82) The eut plant, inserted into a cleft foreign body is miraculously able to grow from it. This is exactly what we find in Aeneid 3, where the cornei and myrtle shafts hâve been fixed into Polydorus' body, from which they hâve gained sufficient nourishment to grow into 'plants' that re tain their original warlike nature. What Virgil offers us is thus a macabre, supernatural example of grafiing: Polydorus' truncus is a truncus in its vegetable sensé, and the phenomenon of the growing spears is arboricultural.2 There are a number of résonances between the two passages. The buds erupt de cortice - just as Polydorus' blood flows de cortice (Aen. 3.33) - and burst their tunicas, a technical term, but nonetheless strikingly anthropomorphic. In the description of graft- ing, the trunci are eut (one might use obtruncare)3 and the stem which 1 R. D. Williams, op. cit., p. 65 interprétée! obtruncat as évidence for VirgiTs hav- ing combinée! two différent previously existing traditions, one of which featured Polydorus' death by spear, the other by décapitation. However, neither method is found in Euripides where he is killed by sword (σιδαρέωι ... φασγάνωι, Hec. 718-719) but not decapitated. In Homer, Polydorus is killed during the war by Achilles' spear (Zi. 20.407-418); the détails of Ennius' Hecuba are unknown. Polydorus is stoned to death in Dict. Cret. 2.27, but there is no évidence that this tradition would hâve arisen before Virgil's time (see N. Horsfall, op. cit., p. 75). 2 V A. Estevez, Aeneid 11 624-631 and the Helen and Venus épisodes, «Class. Journ.» 76, 1981, pp. 318-335, notes that «Aeneas pulls out spears of cornei and myrtle growing from the boy 's body as though from a truncus» (p. 324), while M. Paschalis, op. cit., p. 113, writes «Truncus' means both 'tree-trunk' ... and 'mutilated (headless) body'; the two meanings interact semantically throughout the Aeneid». Both critics, however, fail to perceive the Géorgie metaphor that this ambiguity créâtes. 3 As would Columella at 4.29.4 (obtruncatione) and 42913 (obtruncatur), both in a discussion of grafting; see S. Oakley, op. cit., p. 244.</page><page sequence="6">198 Lyndsay Coo Aeneas uproots is, incongruously, called an arbos (Aen. 3.27), * recalling the grafted ingens ... arbos of the Georgics. R. F. Thomas, Tree Viofotion and Ambivalence in Virgil, «Trans. Amer. Philol. Assoc.» 118, 1988, following D. O. Ross Jr. in both Non sua poma: Varrò, Virgil and Grafiing, «Illin. Class. Stud.» 5, 1980, pp. 63-71, and VirgiVs Elements. Physics and Poetry in the Georgics, Princeton 1987, notes that in the second Géorgie Virgil magnifies the importance of grafting to a disproportionate extent, and thè grafts he describes are always unlikely and frequently impossible. Thus the various Géorgie pairings (appiè onto pear or plane, plum onto cherry, walnut onto arbutus, chestnut onto beech, pear onto ash, oak onto elm) are « without exception . . . impractical or grotesque»,2 but it is in Aeneid 3 that Virgil créâtes his most fantastic graft yet, that of a plant onto a human truncus. As Ross inter prêts VirgiTs monstrous Géorgie grafts as symbols of «an order inverted, a world gone totally wrong» (op. cit., 1987, p. 109), so the monstrum of the grafted spears stands as a symbol of the inversion of human order, the murder of guests and the dissolution of an ancient hospitality. Furthermore, the violence of grafting, with VirgiTs empha- sis on the tree's passivity and the farmer's aggressiveness (resecantur, finditur, immittuntur), provides a metaphor for the Thracians' violence and Polydorus' innocent passivity3 Though the exact sources of Virgil's image are impossible to trace, it is not hard to see how the prologue to Euripides' Hecuba, spoken of course by Polydorus' ghost, might hâve afforded some inspiration. It has been noted that Polydorus compares his initial growth at Thrace to that of a plant: ως τις πτόρ&amp;ος ηύξόμην τάλας (Hec. 20; see, e.g., Horsfall, op. cit., p. 52), but Virgilian critics hâve yet to comment upon the extraordinary concentration of 'spear' imagery which pervades the beginning of Euripides' prologue. Troy risks falling δορί ...f Ελληνικών (Hec. 5); Polymestor rules Thrace φίλιππον λαόν ευθυνών δορί (Hec. 9); Polydorus says ούτε γαρ φέρειν όπλα / ούτ' έγχος οίος τ' ή νέωι βρα- χίονι (Hec. 14-15); in happier days Hector ευτυχεί δορί (Hec. 18). There is perhaps a subtle irony in the young Euripidean Polydorus' being too weak to carry a spear, whereas his epic self is 'carrying' a whole silua (Aen. 3-24).4 1 As N. Horsfall, op. cit., p. 64 notes, «Aen. is trying to decorate an aitar, and does not therefore need to uproot a tree», though he suggests that it was Virgil's need to vary his vocabulary which led to this instance of totum pro parte. 2 D. O. Rossjr., op. cit. Princeton 1987, p. 105; see also G. Maggiulli, Incipiant silvae cum pnmum surgere: mondo vegetale e nomenclatura detta flora di Virgilio, Rome 1995, pp. 40-41. 3 On the violent nature of grafting, see M. C. J. Putnam, VirgiVs Poem of the Earth: Studies in thè Georgics, Princeton 1979, pp. 93-94. 4 It is, of course, no surprise to find multiple références to spears in a tragedy set</page><page sequence="7">Virgil Aeneid 3. 13-68 199 E. Adler also connects thè Polydorus épisode with Georgics 2, though by its ideological tone; she argues that Aeneas' attempts causas penitus temptare faentis (Aen. 3.32) before fear prompts him to pray to the rural gods (Aen. 3.34-35) respond to the alternatives named at G. 2.490-3, felixqui potuit rerum cognoscere causas / ...fortunatus et üle deos qui nouit agrestis. l I hope to have shown that thè two works are connected in other ways and that Virgil has hidden in his Polydorus épisode a mirabile monstrum for close readers of the Georgics, an image deriving unexpectedly from a perversion of arboricultural practice.2 Pembroke College, Cambridge in the aftermath of the Trojan war, but the density of instances hère is nonetheless remarkable. Also of interest is Hec. 699, where Hecuba wonders if Polydorus died a πέσημα φοινίου δορς. This définition might well be applied to the Virgilian Poly- dorus, where the two meanings of φοίνιος interact: Polydorus feil under a shower of 'bloodthirsty' spears, which, after drawing life from his blood, become literally 'bloody' when broken by Aeneas. We might also note, perhaps, the pun on Poly- dorus' name, which appears to have been falsely etymologised even in antiquity as *Πολύδορος; see M. Paschalis, op. cit., pp. 112-113. 1 E. Adler, VergiVs Empire: Politicai Thought in the Aeneid, Lanham (md) 2003, p. 284. 2 The anonymous reviewer at «md» has suggested that the Polydorus omen might be seen as an inversion of the aureus ramus of Aeneid 6, and that the latter might contain further arboricultural référence to Georgics 2. There are certainly connections between the two passages: the stems broken in Thrace reveal Aeneas' location to be ill-omened whereas the golden bough plucked at Cumae admits him to his intended destination, and in each case the plant's discovery is preceded and facilitated by the worship of Venus and followed by a Trojan funeral. More relevantly, the golden bough is dearly described in terms which suggest a grafted branch: it is entirely unlike the ilex on which it grows, being différent in both material (metallo, Aen. 6.144; brattea, Aen. 6.209) and colour (latet arbore opaca I aureus ... ramus, Aen. 6.136-137; discolor unde aun per ramos aura refuhit, Aen. 6.204), and the contrast between bough and ilex is likened to thè effect of mistletoe blooming fronde ... noua (Aen. 6.206) on its host tree - just as the grafted tree of G. 2.74-82 marvels at its nouas frondes (a parallel noted by R. G. Austin, P. Vergili Maronis Aeneidos Liber Sextus, Oxford 1977, p. 101). The golden bough is thus compared to parasitic mistletoe, which in turn echoes the grafted tree of the Georgics. While it is not certain that we are meant to understand the golden bough as literally 'grafted', it is nonetheless an image from Georgics 2 to which we are referred in order to understand the strangeness of the aureus ramus.</page></plain_text>
