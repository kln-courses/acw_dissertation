<plain_text><page sequence="1">TERMITES: A STUDY IN SOCIAL BEHAVIOR. By P. E. Howse. Hutchinson ~ Co., London; Hillary House, New York. $5.50. 150 p. + 5 p. pl.; ill.; index. 1970. The author has brought together many fragments of scattered information concerning these interesting colonial insects. This compact volume is well docu- mented and covers the current knowledge of termite behavior on a world basis. Few of the references are to North American species, partly because of the relatively few genera and species in our geographical area, and partly because there have been few at- tempts to study the complex behavior of termite colonies that are concealed within wood or soil. The presentation of development or metamor- phosis of termites is somewhat confusing. The au- thor designates the early instar nymphs as "larvae" then uses the term "nymphs" for later instars after wing buds become evident. Since termites develop with a gradual metamorphosis, the term "nymph" should be used descriptively for all of the immature individuals. The designation of "larva" should be reserved for insects that develop with a complete metamorphosis and where a resting or pupal stage is present. Although the author claims not to be anthropo- morphic, and cautions against anthropormorphism, the inclusion of the word "social" in the title is in itself anthropomorphic. Perhaps "A Review of Ter- mite Behavior" would have been a more appropri- ate title. L. A.
