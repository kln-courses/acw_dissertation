<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Fantastic World of Ants Herbert Molloy Mason, Jr. 120pp. $5.95. David McKay Co., Inc., New York, N.Y. 1974. This exciting account of the ant world is outstanding for its readability. Perhaps the best way to characterize its appeal is to quote a few of its sentencesâ€”chosen at random. On days when the air is so quiet and still that you can hear your heart beating it is possible to stand silently and listen to the signals given by the carpenter ants who live inside trees.... The army ants . . . are the cannibals of the jungle. . . . They wander the earth in immense columns, killing and looting as they go, carrying their young with them.... Included also are harvester ants, the agricultural farmers of the insect world; parasol, or leaf-cutting, ants; Argentine ants; and fire ants. The book is enriched with passages by myrmecologists who have added to our knowledge of the be havior of ants. Frequent reference is made to the methods used for investigating these ingenious insects. A concluding chapter, "The Joy of Ants," invites the reader to engage in "ant ranching" by building an observation nest. The attempt to make us recognize their exceptional characteristics results in occasional anthropomorphic crediting of ants with more sensibility and intel ligence than they possess. But this is forgivable. The book should make its readers head for the nearest field or for est to search for these fascinating insects. For junior high school. Julius Schwartz</page></plain_text>
