<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION Old Wine in Exotic New Bottles The New Religious Consciousness is perhaps best viewed as a volume of history. Professors Glock and Bellah and their contributors are concerned with issues such as the meaning of the 1960s' "counterculture," the relationship between new spiritual movements and the rise and fall of the "New Left," and the relevance of previous American "Great Awakenings" to the present spiritual ferment. The editors imply in the preface that their aim is to view the sixties "from the perspective of the mid- seventies" (p. xi). The researchers, however, are not fully equipped for such an enterprise. Most of the chapters were written, in first draft, by 1974, and they are based on research conducted in the early seventies. The authors depict a "new religious consciousness" appealing primarily to volatile and unsettled young persons in their teens and twenties, largely bohemian, "alienated," and unintegrated into dominant familial and occupational institutions. Such was the initial "carrier group" of a consciousness which has now transcended its original hippiesque base. From the vantage point of 1976 things look quite different. Non-traditional spirituality seems less and less a counterculture or even youth culture phenomenon; it has diffused to older age strata and to more settled and "respectable" circles. There seems to be occurring an institutionalization and an accommodation to dominant institutional and cultural patterns which is not indicated in the present report. Thus the "Borscht Belt" resorts in the Catskills are currently being replaced by Guru institutions (including a T.M. institute, a Zen monastery, and an ashram for Swami Baba Muktananda) which do not, by and large, service a clientele of socially marginal drop-outs. The objectification of the new consciousness in permanent institutions capable of engaging the involvement of settled individuals with stable familial and career commitments may not have been forseen by Professor Wuthnow, who speculates "that the present religious experimenters may gradually lose their interest in these groups as they grow older, get married, take jobs, settle down, and so on," (p. 291). More prescient may be Wuthnow's conclusion that the followers of new religions in his sample tended frequently to come from elite backgrounds and thus were likely to exert a somewhat greater cultural influence than their numbers would indicate. In general, the current trends, especially with regard to "Eastern" mysticism in America, seem to vindicate the comment of Jay Martin, writing in Antioch Review (Summer, 1975), that the youthful counterculture has "been implicitly assigned the social task of testing behavior which, when it works, will be incorporated into adult mores. . . . Counterculture rehearses the carnivals of culture." In short, countercultural styles are adopted by the larger culture because they can be adapted in ways which reinforce existing cultural patterns and do not pose a threat to dominant institutions. If you spend the weekend in the ashram, perhaps you can better tolerate working in the bureaucracy all week. The historical focus of the present volume is illustrated by Gregory Johnson's account (Chapter 2) of the early development of the Hare Krishna cult in the context of the disintegration of the hippie psychedelic in Haight-Ashbury at the end of the sixties. The Krishna devotees were able to create a unified "loving" community in 310</page><page sequence="2">REVIEW SYMPOSIUM which ecstatic experiences of transcendence could be ritualized and routinized in such a way as to maintain group cohesion and support permanent institutions. The "hippie" drug scene in Haight-Ashbury had failed to maintain a community because, in Johnson's opinion, hallucinogenic drug experiences are inherently isolating and because certain drug scene experiences (e.g., paranoia over police "busts") undermined the plausibility structure of a "loving" utopiate community. Yet the Krishna cult fed on hippie utopianism and recruited disillusioned hippies. Whom do they recruit now? Still-alienated deviants? How has the spread of the movement throughout the nation and to many foreign countries altered its emphases? Unlike many "Eastern" movements, the Krishna cult seems to be preserving its monastic-sectarian detachment from American society and makes only superficial accommodations, such as dressing up devotees in wigs and business suits for purposes of deceptive solicitation at airports. In contrast, Jeanne Messer (Chapter 3) reports that devotees of Guru Maharaj-ji evince "an increasing willingness to rejoin the mainstream of society." Messer also emphasizes the heterogeneity of cognitive orientations within the movement and the absence of standardized doctrine and fixed moral codes. Her account converges with recent conceptualizations of "cult" patterns by Allan Eister, G. K. Nelson, and Roy Wallis and also serves to remind us that there are "religions" in which cognitive belief is secondary, such that the commitment of devotees is essentially experiential and "beyond belief." Wuthnow seems to have watered down his chapter (13) (compared to an earlier draft) and de-emphasized or removed data bearing on social background differentials between followers of "Eastern" and followers of "Christian" movements. He has, however, included suggestive differentials in social attitudes between Oriental and neo-Christian cultists. These differences are important because they challenge the notion that Hindu-Buddhist cults and Jesus sects are essentially interchangeable consumer items in the new spiritual supermarket shopped for by contemporary "Protean Man" who is a mediator one year, a Jesus freak the next, and perhaps a Symbionese terrorist the third year. Wuthnow's data support the notion that "monistic" Eastern mysticism and "dualistic" neo- fundamentalism embody contrasting resolutions of the contemporary spiritual and moral crisis which appeal to different types of individuals. Professor Glock concludes the book (Chapter 16) with a brief essay which pinpoints the sixties as the locus of a significant shift of social consciousness or mode of perceiving social reality. According to Glock, Americans have traditionally assumed mastery and fate control-"free will"-and this assumption has fostered a derivative ethic of personal responsibility. This way of looking at social experience has traditionally co-existed with a view of social arrangements as direct manifestations of Divine Providence. However, both orientations have now been undermined by science, particularly social science, which tends to "deny that human destiny is entirely either in man's or in God's control" (p. 361). The assumptions of personal autonomy and mastery are increasingly less able to confer meaning on social experience, and the legitimation of forms of social organization (e.g., criminal justice processes) is threatened. The diffuse socio-cultural protest and experimentation of the sixties reflects this crisis of meaning and legitimation. 311</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION Although the "open rebellion" is ended, the underlying erosion of legitimacy and the search for new forms and structures of meaning continues. Glock tends to use the diffusion of social science perspectives as a kind of deus ex machina. It would appear, however, that the popularization of social science determinism reflects the emergence of a bureaucratic corporate welfare state, which has supplanted the competitive entrepreneurial economy that provided the plausibility structure for mystiques of competitive individualism. Today in New York or Los Angeles, the seemingly impersonal processes of an urbanized and bureaucratized "mass society" form a plausibility structure for impersonal pantheistic conceptions of divinity as "universal energy" or a depth of consciousness. There is, of course, a powerful counter-reaction. Interestingly, the evangelical resurgence is strongest in the South and Southwest, where weak unions, underdeveloped social services, and minimal state regulation of business maintain a plausibility structure for competitive individualism. Glock may also underestimate the importance of the popularization of physical science in enhancing the plausibility of "universal energy" notions of ultimate reality and undermining traditional anthropomorphic conceptions of God-in-the- clouds. Thus Alan Tobey, in his report on the 3HO (Yogi Bhajan) movement (Chapter 1), describes yogic exercises designed to cleanse the aura, defined as a "biomagnetic field" of energy around the body, such "that one will be more harmoniously related to the energy field of the whole universe" (p. 11). This "energy field" jargon may be pseudoscientific gibberish, but it sounds modernistic. In short, Eastern monism entails a world view not necessarily more "scientific," but perhaps less conspicuously nonscientific (I don't say "unscientific") than anthropomorphic conceptions of a personal creator God. Glock's provocative essay is autonomous in this volume, making practically no reference to the preceding studies. This is slightly less true of Professor Bellah's longer essay on "The New Religious Consciousness and the Crisis in Modernity" (Chapter 15), which is a precis of his analysis of the evolution of American civil religion in The Broken Covenent, with an extended application to the current spiritual ferment. The original biblical self-understanding of the colonists as "God's New Israel" bound by covenant to obedience to an absolute God objectively revealed in scripture has been supplanted by the utilitarian vision of society as an aggregate of "free" individuals competitively pursuing their private interests and inadvertently producing public benefits. Utilitarian individualism "expressed no interest in shared values or ends" (p. 336) and emphasized technical reason and the rationalization of means. The politico-moral ferment of the sixties articulated a sharp disenchantment with utilitarian individualism and stridently re-opened the question of ends. The religious and quasi-religious movements of the seventies are "successor movements" to the general spiritual crisis of the sixties, embodying the sixties' new consciousness of goals, and yet perhaps surreptitiously accommodating the new spirituality to the requirments of a persisting utilitarian individualism and providing new esoteric bottles for the same old wine. Nevertheless, the growth of such movements is indicative of the continuing erosion of the legitimacy of the "American way of life" and the diminishing appeal of unadulterated utilitarian individualism bereft of any facade of new consciousness of new purposes. 312</page><page sequence="4">REVIEW SYMPOSIUM In his discussion of new movements, Bellah seems more interested in "Eastern" cults than in neo-Christian movements. Although Bellah does not introduce the term "symbolic realism" into his discussion of the new spirituality, his comments highlight the convergence of the "non-dualistic" symbolic universe of Eastern mysticism with Bellah's own perspective of spiritual "truth." If all is ultimately "oneness," then the symbols and concepts which express this metaphysical unity have only relative validity and can be adjusted to particularistic cultural needs. Spiritual "truths" are not mutually exclusive. Yet such symbolic non-exclusivity is quite compatible with utilitarian individualism. To the utilitarian subjectivist, symbol X and symbol Y are both "true," not because they both manifest an underlying sacred unity, but because they both "work," i.e., produce consequences for self-expression. Bellah is clearly aware of this, but I think it deserves more emphasis. Bellah sees a convergence of Asian non-dualism and Western post-critical Christianity, yet both de-mythologizing criticism of Christianity and the popularization of Oriental non-dualism in the West may reflect the cultural hegemony of utilitarian individualism and the passing of communal biblical absolutism. Currently, I discern a sort of Gresham's Law of new spiritual movements: The ugly or facile drive out the attractive (in Bellah's terms) and subtle. The most dynamic of the presently growing movements seem to be EST and the Unification Church of Reverend Sun Myung Moon. The latter seems to represent a totalitarian version of (revisionist) biblical absolutism, while the former surely embodies the accommodation of non-dualistic "consciousness" ideology to traditional utilitarian individualism-exotic new bottles for finely aged vintage! THOMAS ROBBINS C. U.N. Y.-Queens Flushing, New York Comparative Possibilities Remain Unexplored Three of the papers in The New Religious Consciousness deal with new religious movements in the Western tradition: one dealing with the Christian World Liberation Front, a prominent, if somewhat atypical Jesus movement group; one with the Catholic Charismatic Renewal; and another with the Church of Satan. The paper on the CWLF, by Donald Heinz, is disappointing in several respects. First, it is not grounded in the scholarly literature that has developed about the Jesus movement in general and about some of the specific groups of the Jesus movement in particular, including the CWLF itself. There is no reference section for this paper. Admittedly, this is not a book on the Jesus movement. However, this chapter could have been strengthened by attention to what information is available. 313</page></plain_text>
