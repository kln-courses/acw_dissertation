<plain_text><page sequence="1">STUDI DI ANTICHITA IN ONORE DI GUGLIELMO MAETZ- KE, edited by M.G. Marzi Costagli and L. Tamag- no Perna. (Archaeologica 49.) 3 vols.: pp. xvii + 730, pls. 184. Giorgio Bretschneider Editore, Rome 1984. 1,000,000 Lit. In July 1980, Guglielmo Maetzke retired from the So- printendenza Archeologica per la Toscana. He was Soprin- tendente for 15 years. Shortly after his appointment, his mettle was tested by the flood which devastated Florence and the Museo Archeologico in 1966. His ability to handle that difficult situation, and numerous smaller crises in the next years, demonstrated his considerable skills as an in- dustrious administrator and scholar. Maetzke's retirement closed one chapter in his productive 40-year career in Ital- ian archaeology but it opened others. This charming and energetic scholar continues to be at the center of Etruscan studies. He was much in evidence at the recent Secondo Congresso Internazionale Etrusco in Florence (May-June 1985) and is editing the Atti for that major conference. He continues to be Segretario-Generale of the Istituto di Studi Etruschi ed Italici and, without doubt, will long maintain an active role in Etruscan scholarship. The present work is a fitting tribute to Dott. Maetzke. Its monumental three volumes span the varied interests and ad- ministrative concerns of Maetzke himself, as can be seen by comparing his bibliography and the table of contents. The Festschrift contains 71 articles ranging in length from a suc- cinct 2 pages to a weighty 34 pages. Forty-two contributions are concerned with Etruscan matters; 12 with Roman; an- other 12 with medieval or antiquarian questions; and 5 with Italic prehistory. Sixty of the 71 articles are in Italian. There are 6 in English, 3 in French, and 2 in German. The articles are arranged alphabetically by author's last name within each of the four sections: "Preistoria e protostoria," "Antichita dell'Italia preromana," "Antichita romane," and "Antichita medioevali e storia dell' archeologia." There is a table of contents at the end of Volume III, but no index. The volumes are lavishly illustrated with good black and white plates, two fold-out plates, one of which is in color, and nu- merous text drawings. Volume I begins with a brief introduction describing Maetzke's career and contributions to Italian archaeology. This is followed by a Tabula Gratulatoria, Maeztke's bib- liography, and a list of his honorary titles and appoint- ments. The first and shortest group of articles is on Italian pre- and proto-history. F. Biancofiore in "Attuali indirizzi di metodo in Paletnologia" offers a valuable historical over- view and concise bibliography of recent developments in Italian paleo-ethnology. A second article of broad scope, which clarifies our understanding of the Eneolithic period in northwestern Italy, is M. Venturino Gamberi's discus- sion of material recently recovered from Alba. G. Cateni meticulously analyzes an important cache of 17 10th-c. B.C. bronzes recovered in 1918 from the site of Pariana, near Lucca and D. Cocchi Genick and R. Poggiani Keller offer a detailed catalogue and lengthy discussion of late Middle Bronze Age ceramics from Grotta Misa (Ischia di Castro area) excavated in 1947. F. Lo Schiavo's "Tre Guerrieri" treats early anthropomorphic images, possibly warriors, on two cippi and an incised ceramic fragment from Sardinia. The second and by far the longest portion of this Fest- schrift deals with the antiquities of pre-Roman (mostly Etruscan) Italy. It will not be possible here to mention all of the 42 articles ; I will simply examine the kinds of subjects considered by organizing the articles into groups. Several contributions elucidate the history of particular sites or areas: G. Caputo, "Bibbiena dall'eta antica alla medievale," P. Guzzo, "Archeologia e territorio nella Sibaritide ... ," A. Maggiani, "Problemi del popolamento fra Arno e Ma- gra . ..," A. Michelucci, "Caletra, KaAho'oov, Heba..." Although several articles touch on ancient religion, two deal specifically with religious questions: R. Bloch, "Du Posei- don, ebranleur du sol, maitre de la mer" and E. Paribeni, "Note su antiche divinita italiche." An important group of articles concentrates on various aspects of the Etruscan lan- guage, e.g., R. Lambrechts, M. Pallottino, V. Pisani, A. Prosdocimi, and H. Rix. As might be expected, the majority of articles in this sec- tion are concerned with the analysis of Etruscan art. An ex- cellent introduction to this varied group is G. Mansuelli's valuable article, "Tvpprlvo't pLhorLEXvot ..." which dis- cusses the ancient Greek and Roman literary sources that evaluated the contributions and skills of Etruscan artists. Iconography is a major feature of many of the articles. Es- pecially useful are contributions by L. Bonfante, "Un'urna chiusina con tetes coupees a New York," [see also AJA 88 (1984) 531-39]; P. Bruschetti, "Il motivo del taglio di un ricciolo...," a well-documented study of this fascinating gesture in both Greek and Etruscan art, G. Camporeale, "La scena di caccia nell'arte delle situle," [see now Campo- reale's monograph, La caccia in Etruria (Rome 1984)]; D. Canocchi, "Il centauro alata in Etruria," and J. Heurgon, "D'Iphigenie A Tro'los." Other papers define, interpret, or append particular groups of Etruscan bronzes (G. Gualandi, E. Richardson) or painted vases (M. Del Chiaro). Pottery is the medium treated in the majority of articles in this section. Students of early ceramics will find much of value in G. Bartoloni's "Ancora sulla Metopengattung... ," which examines a popular motif on Italo-geometric pottery, and O. Zanco's "Piccola plastica del periodo arcaico ...," a sensitive exam- ination of modeled attachments to early pottery excavated at central Adriatic sites. Other offerings on pottery include a discussion of "Oeno-</page><page sequence="2">1986] BOOK REVIEWS 247 trian" artifacts at Tarquinia (F. Delpino), Villanovan an- thropoid urn covers (L. Donati), [see now his "Antiquities from Saturnia . . at Berkeley" in Atti Mem. Acc. Tosca- na ... La Colombaria 49 (1984) 3-43]; a previously unpub- lished Etrusco-Corinthian alabastron (J. Szilagyi), and two articles dealing specifically with Greek pottery (F. Cancia- ni, P. Grassi). Pottery techniques are intelligently and sci- entifically discussed by C. Curri, who publishes a rare Etruscan cylinder seal from Roselle used to impress designs on bucchero pottery. Terracottas are treated by D. Hill, F. Melis, A. Neppi Modena, who focuses our attention once again on the Boc- canera Slabs, and K. Phillips, who offers a provocative in- terpretation concerning the possible apotropaic nature of certain architectural terracottas. Ancient armor, one of Maetzke's great interests, is the subject of valuable contri- butions by G. Colonna and L. Lepore. E. Nielsen offers some observations on incised bone plaques excavated at Poggio Civitate [see now S. Stopponi, Case e palazzi d'Etruria (Milan 1985) 94-96, nos. 204-206]. The 12 articles in this Festschrift's third section, on Ro- man antiquities, offer a range of subjects, but most remain focused on Roman sites or objects in Etruria or Tuscan mu- seums. Five contributions concern inscriptions. These are on stone slabs (G. Ciampoltrini, A. Rastrelli), marble fu- nerary urns (D. Manacorda), and Republican coins (M. Cristofani). A. Pfiffig presents an interesting inscription from the late 1st c. A.C. which mentions one Volumnius Pudens, a Roman soldier who traced his ancestry back to a noble Etruscan family of Perusia. Other articles deal with architecture (F. Brown, E. Di Paolo Colonna) or representations of architecture (A. Fro- va), as well as architectural sculpture (G. Capecchi), and a lengthy tracing of the Via Flaminia through part of Etruria (G. Uggeri). Rounding out this section are articles by E. Mangani on Arretine vessels from Asciano, and by L. Ta- borelli on a glass amphoriskos, plus two fragments, with relief depictions of gladiatorial combats and circus games. The final section of these three volumes contains 12 ar- ticles dealing with aspects of medieval monuments or the history of archaeology. These range from a fascinating dis- cussion of the prehistoric prototypes for an erotic sculpture on the walls of an obscure Romanesque church in Cortaz- zone (P. Leonardi) to an account of the recent restoration of the Florentine church of S. Pancrazio and its conversion into a museum of contemporary art (N. Bemporad). Several papers are concerned with unpublished medieval collections in small Tuscan museums (G. De Marinis, R. Francovich, L. Tondo). In fact, at least half the papers in this section are essentially focused on antiquities but are included here, ap- parently because the antiquities were reworked or collected during the early centuries of Italian archaeological interest. M. Guidotti presents the earliest of these objects, two Egyp- tian vases from the Middle and New Kingdoms, collected by Ippolito Rosellini. V. Saladino discusses an early imperial cuirassed portrait whose missing head was conveniently re- placed with a new portrait of Cosimo I. Two early archaeo- logical personalities, a savant and a restorer, are discussed by C. Bruschetti and M. Marzi respectively. O. von Vacano offers a definitive examination of the ancient and medieval road network connecting the sites between the Osa and Al- begna Rivers. There is no question that these three volumes offer an impressive tribute to an impressive scholar and adminis- trator. The editors deserve our congratulations for their ex- cellent work. Few individuals will be able to afford this ex- pensive set of books, but libraries will want to add it to their collections as a valuable mine of scholarly information cov- ering the rich and varied terrain of Italian (especially Tus- can) archaeology and history.
