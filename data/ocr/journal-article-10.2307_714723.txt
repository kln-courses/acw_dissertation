<plain_text><page sequence="1">480 AFRICAN TOPICS REVIEWED THE Governor of Mayotte and the Comoro Islands has sent into the French Colonial Office a very instructive report on European colonization and agriculture in that interesting archipelago, which strategically commands the Mozambique Channel. Although certain agricultural societies hiave not prospered in Mayotte as well as was expected, it is undeniable that the general progress of European settlement in the rest of the group has been very satisfactory of recent years. The climate of the islands though hot near the coast is by no means unhealthy. For the most part they are very mountainous (being of volcanic origin) and thus offer cool health resorts with a European climate. The highest point is Coratola, which is 8,694 feet above sea level. This is in the island of Comoro. Anjouan or Johanna Island also rises well above 5,000 feet. The administrative centre of the group is in Mayotte, or rather, on a small islet named Dzaudai just off Mayotte. Mayotte itself was annexed by France as far back as 1843, and continues to receive a small subvention from the Mother Country. The other islands were not placed under French protection till 1886, and are self-supporting. Of these Comoro is the largest, being about thirty-five miles long, with a width of about twelve. Anjouan, the next in size and population, is considered the most favourable for agriculture. The total population of the archipelago only amounts to about 6o,ooo, and it is now thought necessary to import plantation labourers from the African continent. The natives are by no means pure Negroes, being much improved and modified in type by an intermixture of Arab and Malagasy blood. They speak Bantu tongues allied to those of the Zanzibar coast. The soil of these islands is nearly everywhere rich, and besides supporting extensive forests of fig trees and cocoa- nuts is suited to the production of the sugar-cane, rice, maize, vanilla, coffee, cacao, tea, &amp;c. Between I9oo and</page><page sequence="2">AFRICAN TOPICS REVIEWED 481 1903 the yield of sugar decreased by one-third, but the export of rum on the other hand more than doubled. The cultivation of vanilla has increased enormously and quite suddenly. The value of the crops under this head in 1904 was ?75,000, whereas in 19oo it was practically nil. Coffee is somewhat vacillating. Of late years the Liberian variety has been introduced, and does better than that which was brought to these islands from Mauritius. Statistics as to imports and exports are only obtainable with regard to Mayotte. In 19o3 the imports of this island amounted to the value of ?68,6I I, of which a little more than half came from the Mother Country and French possessions. The exports were valued at ?681,8oo, and went almost entirely to France. * * * * * * Some amusing examples of Baganda blunders in examina- tion papers are given in Uganda Notes for April, 1905. The first matter that calls for attention is spelling. Now Luganda is peculiarly easy to write: every syllable is an open one, and there are no sounds incapable of expression by our English letters. Nevertheless, the Baganda with the African genius for going wrong fall with ex- traordinary unanimity into certain mistakes. A vast number of them do not properly distinguish between the vowels "a " and "o ". The difference when you come to look at it is not enormous, but the variation in meaning is considerable: e.g. Katonda= God, is constantly written Katanda, which signifies a little bed. But the perplexing letter with the Baganda (it takes in this respect the place of the aspirate in certain parts of England) is the letter " n " or " na " as they learn it. This poor letter has a disastrous effect upon the native mind, more especially when the pen is put to paper. It really would not be much exaggeration to say that in the average paper the letter is seldom where it ought to be I The same letter is inserted in all possible and impossible places, with grievous havoc to the inter- pretation. Thus the word kubanga=/or is turned into the curious looking nkubaga, which might mean I skin you. In fact, there seems no end to the tricks of this impish letter. Over and over again does the word for feast=embaga stand written embanga, which means opportunity or space. Leaving now the spelling, we come to the matter of order, and here at times the European examiner is hard put to to find the answer to each question, and to keep dispassionate. An answer commenced on one side of the paper may very often be continued on the reverse side, only upside down; or if the sheet is a double one the writer will skip over one page and go to No. 3, filling up No. 2 with other matter. 31 Vol. 4</page><page sequence="3">482 JOURNAL OF THE AFRICAN SOCIETY But what is perhaps more common and more understandable, is the way in which pieces of answers are discovered in unexpected quarters, scattered throughout the paper. After having tried his hand and brain on a question with only partial success, the Muganda examinee will begin a second. In the middle he suddenly thinks of something belong- ing to the previous question, often without any signification to that effect, he hurriedly writes it down at once, in case it should slip away again out of memory, with sometimes the introductory words mbade norabide=I had almost forgotten. One man prefaced every answer with the words Wano kirala= Here's another for you, and it often was! Another, hoping possibly to pacify the examiner, ended up by saying, " You have asked very good questions but they have been too much for me." Several are quite up to the time-honoured trick of writing of the one thing they know to hide their ignorance of what is asked: and more than one has written in the naivest manner, " I know the answer, but can't think of it just now." Our Baganda are very full of " meanings ". Origen would suit many of them excellently with his excessive spiritualising, or some of our latter-day saints who prefer a " meaning " to the plain statement of the original. Some such might possibly appreciate the following interpretation of Noah's ark. The writer remarked that it had three stories, the first was the Church on earth, the second was the Company of the Saints, and the third the heavenly Sion. But unfortunately he made matters ten times worse in the case of the two lower stories owing to his faulty spelling, so that what the astonished examiner actually read was the Church of the Murderer, and the Sin of the Saints 1 Those who know Luganda will understand how this amusing result occurred. What very curious minds these natives have! Shall we ever really understand them and they us ? When asked to write a Life of Abraham the two outstanding facts by far the majority of men remember, are- not the epoch-making call and the sacrifice of Isaac-but the numbers of altars that Abraham built, and the lie he told about his wife when in Egypt. The Baganda, like all primitive people, are frankly anthropomorphic in their ideas of God; one boy was surprised and shocked the other day by hearing in a sermon that God had not ears and a body like a man. In much the same way a teacher answered that Adam's superiority to the animals lay in this-" that all other things were created with a word without the use of fingers, but Adam was moulded by God's fingers from the dust." Yet another on the same theme: " God blew breath into Adam- He didn't into the animals." Alas for the examinee, for neither did He blow breath into the woman ! * * * * * * It is to 5e hoped that the expedition of the Marquis de Segonzac into the Bled Siba region of southern Morocco will contribute materially to our knowledge of that little known district, though it is to be regretted that more</page><page sequence="4">AFRICAN TOPICS REVIEWED 483 extended operations were cut short by the capture and tem- porary detention of this intrepid explorer. He set out from Mogador in November last. The different members of his expedition soon found it advisable to travel separately, in order not to attract too much attention on the part of the suspicious tribesmen of the Atlas Mountains. The Marquis de Segonzac travelled in disguise as a member of the escort of a native of great local repute. Needless to say, the latter had to be heavily bribed to face the rigours of the Atlas range in winter and the hostility of the many independent and always turbulent Berber tribes of these remote regions, where the Sultan's authority is absolutely ignored and each village is at war with its neighbour. The Rehamna people a few days before the arrival of de Segonzac burnt alive four men whom they suspected were partisans of the Makhzen. The general insecurity is reflected in the style of building the houses and villages like castles on the summits of pre- cipitous mountain spurs. It is noteworthy that the Marquis de Segonzac found along the slopes of the Atlas Mountains curious dwellings dug out of the earth like those in the Tunisian Sahara described by Sir Harry Johnston. The advantage of these artificial caves is obvious; for not only are they almost invisible, but the temperature of the interior of the dwelling remains the same practically all the year round in spite of the violent extremes of heat and cold experienced in these regions. De Segonzac managed to reach the southern slopes of the Anti-Atlas between Tagmut and Ilir before he was denounced as a European spy by a native of Mogador. It was lucky that before his capture he sent on his earlier notes by messenger, and these have been safely received in France, while much valuable informa- tion as to the Atlas range-still so imperfectly known-was collected by his colleague, M. Gentil, and other members of the expedition, who after the first stage separated and went in different directions. Students of African languages will await with interest the publication of M. Boulifa's notes on Berber dialects of the far interior. In any case, it is understood that these plucky pioneers of French enterprise have filled up many blanks in the map of southern Morocco. For these preliminary notes on their labours we are indebted</page><page sequence="5">484 JOURNAL OF THE AFRICAN SOCIETY to an article by M. Auguste Terrier in Questions Diploma- tiques et Coloniales of April Ist. The Estimates of the German Government for 1904-5 emphasize once more the costliness of colonial enterprise in its initial stages, if this can still be called an initial stage which has lasted for twenty years. Not one of Germany's possessions in Africa can as yet be called self-supporting, since all of them receive a subsidy from the Imperial Govern- ment, which subsidy (except in the case of the Cameroons) is considerably greater than the amount of revenue raised locally. This fact perhaps is rather to the credit of the German administration, since it shows that the natives are not unduly taxed nor is foreign trade hampered by heavy duties. At first sight ?1,295,575, which is the total amount of regular Imperial subsidies voted for the African colonies last year, does not seem an extravagant sum for investment in a domain of nearly a million square miles, particularly when compared with the French African Estimates. But it must be borne in mind that this is not the whole tale of expenditure. Up to the end of the last financial year, supple- mentary estimates amounting to ?3,453,401 were voted for the war in South-West Africa, which when added to the Estimates under the same head for 1905-1906 bring up the total actual and estimated cost of this war to nearly six millions sterling.' This is of course a mere fleabite com- pared to British expenditure on South African warfare, but the prize at stake is infinitely less: the combined Import and Export trade of all the German colonies in Africa in 1903 only amounted to the value of ?2,754,350, and in this total amount the share of German South-West Africa only 1 It is to be feared that the attempts of the German Administration in South-West Africa to balance this expenditure by increasing the local revenue are not always very wisely conceived or happy in their results. The unofficial settlers complain loudly of the way they are taxed, and now in order to conciliate them and at the same time save money for the Government, the Administration has made arrangements for the letting out of prisoners of war on the very moderate terms of ten shillings a month, payable in advance to the district authorities, or sixpence a day if required for a shorter period. The employer undertakes to feed, clothe and lodge the labourers, and provide a sufficient guard. This practice (not unknown in British Colonial annals) is open to the gravest objections.</page><page sequence="6">AFRICAN TOPICS REVIEWED 485 figures as ,?568,670. It is interesting by way of com- parison to note that the total value of the trade of the French Empire in Africa in this same year-1903-amounted to ?63,305,500. It must be remembered, however, that by far the greater part of this total is attributable to Algeria and Tunis, which as White Man's countries with a long history cannot fairly be compared to any portion of German Africa. * * * * * * Undoubtedly, though France has spent more on her African possessions than Germany, she gets more back in the way of trade and profitable employment for her young men. It causes surprise in England that France should still vote supplementary estimates for Algeria and for all her other possessions in Africa except Tunis. But as regards Algeria, at any rate, what is spent in one way is more than regained in another; for not only is the general volume of trade very great between Europe and the French posses- sions in Africa, but the individual share of France in this commerce is a large one. This is shown by the trade statistics for I9o3 published at the beginning of this year by the French Colonial Office in its official Feuille de Renseignements. It is sufficient to notice the value of the imports into different portions of French Africa from France and foreign countries respectively (the inter-colonial trade does not amount to more than a million sterling in all, so the trivial amounts under this heading need not be given). For the sake of clearness we give the values in pounds sterling. FROM FROM FRANCE. FOREIGN COUNTRIES. ? ?

It will be noticed how small in comparison is the import trade of French Congo, in spite of the fact that it is endowed with a magnificent waterway, which enables it to export goods to the value of nearly ?7oo,ooo per annum. It is now realized in France that all is not well with French Congo. With great promptitude and wisdom, M. de Brazza, the veteran explorer and administrator of Roman birth but French nationality, has been sent out to the scene of his former labours, to report on the condition of the Protectorate of which he was the virtual founder; for before his famous race up the river with Stanley French influence in these regions did not extend further than a few miles inland from the Gaboon coast. No better choice could have been made for the leader of this commission of inquiry, for most of the difficulties he will have to solve directly or indirectly bear on the Native Question; and no one has more honourably distinguished himself in Africa by scrupulous justice and humanity towards the natives than M. de Brazza. In this connection it may be interesting to quote a few lines from La Quinzaine Coloniale of March last. What has recently stirred up public opinion and been the cause of the De Brazza Mission was simply and solely the relations of the Administration with the natives. These relations are not what they were when M. de Brazza left the Colony. Under his administration the natives were left pretty much to themselves, exempt from subjection and taxation. Of necessity this state of things underwent a change when, subsequent to the era of penetration, the Administration began to organise the country and facilitate the exploitation of its resources. It had to ask the native-the first to benefit by this transformation- to bear his share in the upkeep of the Colony: to pay a tax, however small, or in lieu thereof to do compulsory labour as a porter, which, though vexatious, was necessary in a country deprived of all other means of transport. . . . What we must find out is whether the French Administration in its dealings with the natives has departed from the humanitarian principles with which it has always hitherto been inspired, and whether we must attribute the disturbances in various parts of the Colony to this cause. .... Interesting details as to the trade of Lagos and Southern Nigeria in 1904 are to be found in the Extraordinary</page><page sequence="8">AFRICAN TOPICS REVIEWED 487 Government Gazette of Lagos dated February 25th last but only recently received by us. The total trade of the com- bined Administrations during 19o04 amounted to ?5,695,895, an increase, excluding specie, of over ?'78o,ooo. The share of the United Kingdom in this trade amounted to the value of ?3,477,217, Germany coming next with ?I,54I,'43, More than half the Lagos exports go to Germany and only about one quarter to the United Kingdom. This (according to the Government Gazette) is entirely due to the capture of the palm kernel trade by the former country. The crushed kernels, after the oil has been expressed, are made into cattle food, which commands a ready sale in Germany, where also the oil is scientifically treated and converted into " butter," soap, and other articles of food or general con- sumption. Germany is also replacing the United Kingdom in the export of beads to Southern Nigeria. There was, we regret to see, an increase in the importation of spirits, chiefly from Germany and Holland. The removal of the restrictions on rubber collection in Southern Nigeria resulted in the export being more than doubled, amounting to a total of two and a half million lbs., going almost entirely to the United Kingdom. Commenting on the rubber trade, the writer remarks, " My opinion, founded on 23 years' experi- ence in the Malay Peninsula, is that it will be found impos- sible to do more than delay the practical destruction of the Forest-grown rubber by an illiterate and uneducated population. Efficient supervision in tropical forests far away from centres of population is impossible. ... . I feel sure that the future of the industry lies in cultivation. Let the Europeans and natives start plantations of rubber-bearing trees. This has been successfully done in Ceylon and the Malay Peninsula with Para (Hevea braziliensis) and Indian (Ficus elastica) rubber trees. Both thiese trees are flourishing in the Botanical Gardens of Lagos and Calabar." In Lagos, the partial failure of the autumn rains greatly affected the output of cotton, which, however, showed a slight increase on the previous year. If cotton-growing is to be firmly established in these regions it can only be by inducing the natives individually to grow cotton alternately with food crops, and not as a single industry, in a whole-</page><page sequence="9">488 JOURNAL OF THE AFRICAN SOCIETY sale way. We wish we had space to reproduce a valuable report which Captain Elgee, Resident at Ibadan, furnished to the Government of Lagos last autumn. This dealt with economical methods of cotton-cultivation adopted by the poorer people in China, where the plan of family co-operation and mutual interest combined with great thrift and ingenuity seems to answer very well. Much of this report has a direct bearing on West Africa, though it is to be feared that the West African Negro, man for man, is not as good a cultivator as the average Chinaman. The annual Conference of the African Institute (Colwyn Bay, North Wales), was held at the registered offices of the Institute on Friday last, Dr. A. J. Parry, Rhyl, presiding. The report showed that great progress had been made during the year. The tutor's report was encouraging and exceed- ingly interesting. About thirty certificates in connection with public examinations had been obtained by the students during the year and two had just sat for the London Matricu- lation. One student had passed his first medical examination in Edinburgh last March, and another his final examination -at the same time. The latter is at present in the Tropical Disease Hospital, Liverpool, taking a special course of studies. He will return to Yorubaland, W. Africa, next autumn, a fully qualified medical missionary and will support himself by means of his profession. He will not cost a penny for his maintenance to any Society in this country once his foot is on his native soil. Herein lie the two main features of the Institute's work, viz., ist, to use the negro himself to carry the light of civilization to the Africans; 2nd, to make him self-supporting by means of his trade or profession. Amongst the many millions of our fellow subjects in Africa, there is an unlimited field for all pioneers of the Christian religion and education-but the African Institute is unique in its plan of operation, which is founded on the principle that the natives are the natural instruments for the work, as they have not to contend against a deadly climate or the obstacles of language and racial antipathies. * * * * * *</page><page sequence="10">AFRICAN TOPICS REVIEWED 489 Although no public agreement has yet been come to between France and Spain as to the respective spheres of influence of those countries in Morocco it is pretty well understood that Spain will have to rest content with but a trifling extension of her territories in North-West Africa. This at first sight seems rather unjust, for the Spaniards have maintained a footing in this country for more than four centuries, though it must be admitted that considering the advantages of proximity which they have enjoyed they have made very little impression politically, commercially, or morally on their old enemies across the Straits. Only 8 per cent. of the total trade of Morocco is with Spain.' This is remarkable, considering that there are nearly six thousand Andalusian labourers at Tangiers, and a thousand more scattered among the other native coast ports. These might be expected to stimulate the trade of Morocco with their mother-country; but as a matter of fact these Spanish settlers in Morocco are of a much poorer and less respectable type than those of their compatriots who have settled under French protection in the western part of Algeria. Nevertheless, they have spread a knowledge of their language in all the coast regions and for a certain dis- tance into the interior. In this they have been assisted by the Jews of northern Morocco, whose ancestors in most cases were refugees from Spain. This is also the reason why Spanish money is current in Morocco. Up till now the scattered Spanish possessions on the coast of Morocco have been chiefly used as convict stations-a state of affairs which has certainly not enhanced Spanish prestige in the eyes of the Moors. The most easterly of these possessions is the Chafarinas or Zaffarin Archipelago, not far from the coast frontier of Algeria, and opposite the mouth of the Muluya River. These small islands (which were seized by Spain in 1849 in order to forestall the designs of the French) were declared a Free Port in 1887. They pro- duce very little, but form a sheltered roadstead for shipping. 1 This proportion shows no tendency to increase, though cheap Spanish cotton goods hold their own against similar wares from Great Britain and Belgium.</page><page sequence="11">490 JOURNAL OF THE AFRICAN SOCIETY Melilla, which has been in Spanish occupation since 1490, and is therefore the oldest of her possessions on the African mainland, is the principal port of the Rif Coast. Immedi- ately to the south of it is a salt lake of great depth, which is only separated from the Mediterranean by a narrow spit of land, and could be made into an excellent harbour. Even without this advantage, Melilla has acquired some import- ance as an entrep6t for local trade since it was declared a Free Port. Nevertheless, the greater part of its commerce is in French and British hands, the imports consisting chiefly of provisions and cotton goods. Not counting the garrison and convicts, the civil population of Melilla numbers little more than 3,000. To the west of Melilla are the insignificant islands of Pefion de Velez de la Gomera (surely rather a top- heavy name for so small a place !) and Alhucemas. These might become centres of trade when the Rif country is pacified, as there are important fisheries in the neighbour- hood. Still further to the west is the important fortress of Ceuta on the Straits of Gibraltar, and the little island of Peregil in the middle of that narrow channel where the Mediterranean merges into the Atlantic. Ceuta, which Spain inherited from Portugal in 164o after the separation of the two monarchies, has a population of 20,000, including 5,000 soldiers and 2,000 convicts. Although it is more advantageously situated as a port of call, it is of little com- mercial importance compared to its rival, Gibraltar. Its import trade is mainly in grain and cotton goods, and its principal export is fish. Its shipping is almost exclusively British. The Spanish territory round the town received an extension in I86o. On the Atlantic coast of Morocco, south of Mogador, Spain has occupied the roadstead of Ifni, opposite the fertile Nun Valley. Nearly all these possessions involve a heavy drain on the Spanish Exchequer, and in return bring very little solid profit to the Mother Country, which has from time to time sacrificed so much in lives and treasure to maintain its position in this part of the world. Intimately connected with these scattered possessions is the adjoining Spanish Protectorate of the Rio de Oro, stretching</page><page sequence="12">AFRICAN TOPICS REVIEWED 491 as far south as the neighbourhood of Cape Blanco. The Government Headquarters for this Protectorate are at the port of Villa-Cisneros, where there is a factory and a small garrison. France possesses the natural hinterland of this Spanish " colony," and also the right of pre-emption over it should Spain wish to evacuate this coast-line at any time. Truth to tell, the country is not inviting, though its climate is fairly healthy. The Muhammadan natives of mixed Berber and Negro stock are not very amicably inclined towards their " protectors." They rear cattle, sheep, and camels; and these, together with esparto grass and manzanilla, constitute at present the only resources of the country. Yet on this inhospitable coast, where no port is safe from the fury of the West wind and the danger of shifting sand-banks, where.the eye of the mariner is wearied by a continuous line of precipitous cliffs whose monotonous outline is only broken occasionally by jagged rocky projec- tions-off this unpromising coast is one of the most important fishing grounds in the world, not-like that of Newfoundland -celebrated for one species of fish only, but rich in many species, varying from the sardine to the tunny in size. This fact was first discovered by the Portuguese and Venetians, who were followed up by the Flemings, Spaniards, English, and French. As early as 1476 the Spaniards established a fort on this coast, naming it Santa-Cruz de Mar Pequefia. This was principally to protect their settlement in the Canary Islands from the attacks of corsairs. Before the combined attacks of these pirates and the Moors they evacuated this post after keeping it for half a century. But they did not abandon their claims to the coast, and in 1787 again definitely established fishing stations by treaty with the Sultan of Morocco. This treaty was confirmed in I86o, and in 1884 the Protectorate of Rio de Oro was definitely constituted.</page></plain_text>
