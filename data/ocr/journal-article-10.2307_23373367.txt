The second and third excavation seasons took place in 1990 and 1991. The project was conducted by the Institute of Archaeology, Tel Aviv University under the direction of Dr. Avi Gopher with students of the Institute and volunteers. The excavations were supported by the generous assistance of the Irene Levi Sala CARE Archaeological Foundation. (For general details see Hadashot Arkhaeologiot). THE STRATIGRAPHY The stratigraphy of Nahal Zehora II as observed after the 1990 season consists of a black soil layer, 15-50 cms thick, which reduces towards the lower slope; the main Wadi Raba layer lies below this soil and is grey-beige in colour; beneath this a thin sterile layer separates the Wadi Raba layer from a brownish (30 cms. thick) earlier layer which lies directly on bedrock and which was found to contain Yarmukian sherds. The main structures of the site are in the Wadi Raba layer. These are rectangular buildings constructed of stone. The walls are 30-60 cms. wide and usually made of two rows of fieldstones aligned to form two straight faces for the wall. In one case there appears to be an internal division inside a building but we do not yet have whole buildings to allow a full reconstruction of the house plan at the site. Attached to the buildings and between them, various kinds of features were found, amongst them pits and stone piles of various sizes, (diameters range from 80 cms to four meters); small paved surfaces and circular storage features made of bricks. In the 1991 season, the stratigraphy was further clarified as follows: bedrock was reached in a small trench and the depth of the site at the deepest exposed areas was 169</page><page sequence="2">170 GOPHER &amp; ORRELLE ✓ 2l / / S s s s A \ / \ / \\ \ i W \ \ w \\. * \ ^71 \ \ .

Below the black cover soil, the Wadi Raba occupation lies on levelled surfaces of the moderately descending slope. It seems at present that there are a number of building phases, at least three, although it is difficult to fix definitely since no direct correlation or points of contact between the buildings have been found. However, change in orientation of some of the structures and stratigraphie data provide support for the assumption of several phases. There appeared to be a building innovation whereby in the same wall, there were fewer courses of stone on the upslope side of the wall than on the downslope side. The purpose of this is not quite clear, but it may be some form of reinforcement for slope conditions. A very similar wall was exposed in Nahal Zehora I. One must, remember however, the possibility that this phenomenon may be the result of movement of slope sediments. The Yarmukian occupation seems to be in the nature of patches - exploitation of shallow natural basins in the bedrock, one of which was located at our test trench. Unfortunately, the area of this Yarmukian occupation at the trench had suffered post-depositional disturbance and only remnants of two converging walls were found and appear to be a corner of a rectangular building. Floors of the structures are made of earth upon a thin horizon of rubble and sherds and are very rich in finds. Here and there remnants of mudbrick were found but no clear evidence of bricks used in structures were found. Two oval and rounded installations were found with paved limeplaster floors sunk beneath floor levels. BURIAL One burial has been found so far, (in the 1989 season) that of a fetus buried in a jar. The jar was laid on its side north of the wall of a house. The jar was whole and was supported by small stones and groundstone fragments. The bones were identified as those of a fetus by their size but have not yet been subjected to detailed study. FINDS Pottery:Pottery: Prominent in quantity amongst the finds assemblages are a large number of pottery sherds of the Wadi Raba kind. The wide range of types and decorations which characterize this assemblage appear at Nahal Zehora II. As with all Wadi Raba pottery assemblages, the pottery is very fragmented, and appears in fills below floors, in pits and on living floors. The demarcation between floor and fill is very slim and it is not always possible to distinguish between sherds used in the fill and on the floor which may create a problem of identification which will require delicate analysis in the future. Pétrographie analysis was carried out by Y. Goren of the Antiquities Authority.</page><page sequence="4">172 GOPHER &amp; ORRELLE Lithic:Lithic: A large amount of flint tools were found as well as waste from the manufacturing industry. Amongst the tools, the dominant types were sickle blades and very few arrowheads appear as well. A Preliminary report on the lithic assemblage was given at the UISPP Conference in Bratislava 1991 by A. Gopher. Groundstone:Groundstone: Groundstone tools especially grinding stones and slabs were found in every part of the site. Other noteworthy finds include some bone tools, mainly points; shells, some of them worked, stone beads, obsidian blades, sling stones, pottery spindle whorls and other weaving implements. Figurine Figurine Assemblage: A total of seven figurines have been found on the site to date, six of them in the 1991 season. Two of these are quadripeds, well executed in clay, and the remaining five are anthropomorphic stone figurines. These are reminiscent of the Yarmukian "Pebble Figurines" incised type but are not at all the same. Most of them, come from Wadi Raba contexts and present a new facet of this assemblage not seen previously. Another item, which appears to have symbolic significance is a stone plaque - found wedged into the earth, and on which was incised a rough square shaped motif. The finds assemblages from the lowest Yarmukian layer are still small since only a very small area has been exposed. These include Yarmukian sherds decorated with herringbone pattern incisions and red painted bands. Pottery decorated with painted and sometimes painted and burnished bands of red-brown colours on cream wash were also found. The flint assemblage of this layer is still small, but it includes already some typical Yarmukian sickle blades. FAUNA The site is characterised by an exceptionally good preservation of bones, and the faunal assemblages from all three seasons have been fully recorded and studied by Dr. Simon Davis, thanks to assistance received from CARE. The general picture emerging is one of mainly domesticated animals - sheep/goat, cattle, pig, and additional species fish, equus and fallow deer were also discerned. FLORA In the 1991 season, carbonized organic material was retrieved, both of wood and a small quantity of seeds. It is hoped that these will prove sufficient to provide an indication of the nature of vegetal material used by the inhabitants, and for radiocarbon dating of the site. Phytolite analysis on samples from Nahal Zehora II was carried out by Arlene Rosen of the Weitzman Institute and preliminary results obtained, but not yet been published, show great potential.</page></plain_text>
