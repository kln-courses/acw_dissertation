JANUARY I932 THE MATHEMATICAL ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE I SIR JAMES JEANS, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S. In Plutarch's Qucastiones Conviviales there is a discussion on the topic--Tr IIs 1dTcv I'Aye Tv Oeov del yeoWerTpe v ("What did Plato mean when he used to say that God always geometrizes?"). I shall not attempt to answer this question, but rather shall suggest a different one: If Plato had been conversant with all the scientific knowledge and ideas of to-day, in what sense might he have said that God for ever geometrizes, or, in more modern phraseology, that the universe is constructed on geometrical lines? To the Greeks, space was merely a framework for an arrangement of material objects. A was behind B when you could not see A because of B. In this case A, B and yourself lay on a straight line. As an effort of pure imagination objects can be arranged in all sorts of ways-in a line, or a plane, in a three-dimensional space, in a four-dimensional space, and so on. Actually, experience shows that an arrangement in what the mathematicians call a three-dimensional array is in some way true to Nature; when our minds create a three- dimensional space, the arrangement of all the objects we can see can be made to fall objectively into law and order. Actually, everyday experience takes us a bit farther than this; it suggests that the three-dimensional space in which we live is of the kind we usually describe as Euclidean-parallel lines never meet, and so on. All that we are entitled to deduce from such experience is that the mental creation of a space of this kind brings law and order into the arrangement of objects near home; it provides no justification for extending these properties to the whole universe. I An address delivered to the British Institute of Philosophy at University College, London, on October 13, I93I. 3</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY There is a peculiar religious sect whose members describe them- selves as Zetetists. One of their tenets is that the earth's surface is flat, or, if we like, Euclidean-so that parallel lines on the earth's surface never meet. No amount of abstract argument will persuade the Zetetist that he is wrong. The little bit of the earth in which his daily walk or daily labour lies is flat, and this flatness so per- vades his mental make-up that he cannot conceive any possibility except flatness, which he then wrongly extends to the whole earth. In the same way, the special Euclidean quality of space in our neighbourhood is an empirical fact, but we know now that we shall be in error if we extend it to cover the whole universe. I shall try to explain why. Three hundred years before Christ, Euclid had defined a straight line as the shortest distance between two points, and asserted that light travelled in straight lines. Thus he knew that light took the shortest path from point to point. He also knew that light could be deflected from its path by a mirror, and discovered the laws of reflection, finding that light which was reflected by a mirror followed the same path as a perfectly hard particle bouncing off the mirror. To Euclid these were two totally disconnected facts. About a century later, Hero of Alexandria combined them in a very significant synthesis; he showed that even when light was reflected at a mirror its path was still the shortest possible, subject to the condition that it must go to the mirror and back in its course-mirror or no mirror, light followed the shortest path. Light can experience other accidents besides reflection. For instance, we can see the setting sun even after, geometrically, it has passed below the horizon. The rays by which we see it are said to be "refracted," or bent, by the earth's atmosphere. Obviously these rays cannot be following the shortest path, since a bent path can never be as short as a straight one. Actually, they are following the quickest path. When light passes through a material substance, such as glass or air, the particles of matter impede its motion. The denser the substance, the slower the speed of travel of the light. The quickest path for a sunbeam is not the shortest, but is one which avoids travelling overmuch through the dense air near the earth's surface, the rays bending round this rather than travelling directly through it. Hero had stated his synthesis in the form that light, whether reflected or not, takes the shortest course from point to point. He might with equal truth have said that it takes the quickest. Had he done so, his synthesis would have covered the case of refracted light without any modification whatever, and indeed of light moving in all the ways known to science. All known light takes the quickest path from point to point. 4</page><page sequence="3">THE MATHEMATICAL ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE The undulatory theory of light provided a simple explanation of this, on the assumption that light was the motion of waves travelling through a material substance-the ether-which was supposed to fill all space. The universe contains matter as well as radiation-what of this ? It seems almost incredible that particles of matter can be brought under the same synthesis as rays of light, yet such is the fact. Aristotelian doctrine had asserted that substances tended to rise or sink, according as they were light or heavy. Galileo and Newton made it clear that this was not a universal law of nature, but a mere local effect due to the gravitational pull of the earth; in the absence of such forces all objects moved in straight lines with uniform speed. Like light, they took the shortest path from point to point; or, if their speed of motion was assigned, they took the quickest path from point to point-again like light. When forces were acting, bodies obviously did not take either the shortest or the quickest paths-for instance, a cricket-ball in the air. But Maupertuis discovered that there was a quantity known as the "action" associated with the motion either of a single object or of a group of objects; each bit of motion involved a certain calculable rate of expenditure of "action," and, no matter what forces were in operation, objects moved in such a way as to make the total expenditure of action a minimum. There was no obvious physical reason why this should be, although Maupertuis advanced one of a metaphysical nature, arguing that the perfection of nature required the greatest possible economy in the expenditure of action. The older principles of least distance and of least time now became absorbed in the new principle of "least action," which provided a synthesis to cover the motion both of objects and of light-of matter and radiation, the two constituents of the physical universe. The synthesis was not quite perfect, as we shall shortly see, but even so it has been of tremendous value. We saw how the special principle of "least time" for rays of light was explained by supposing light to consist of waves. This explanation proved inadequate when it was discovered, only a few years ago, that in many respects waves of light behaved rather more like particles of matter than like our earlier conceptions of waves. This was followed by the discovery that the ultimate particles of matter-electrons and protons-behave very much like waves. We now know that it is quite impossible to divide nature up into particles and waves; we can no longer find any sharp-cut distinction between them. The synthesis of "least action" shows how this can be, and is found to give a satisfactory explanation of the behaviour of both particles and waves. This explanation is of course purely mathematical: it tells us nothing as to the nature of objects it deals with. And, indeed, we still know 5</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY very little about what we used to call particles of matter except that they are not mere particles, and very little as to the nature of light except that it is not mere waves. The physicist who wishes to work at the properties of either matter or light must do so in purely mathematical terms; science has reached a stage in which the old physical concepts of particles and waves will only lead him astray. Nevertheless, the simple synthesis of "least action" has not proved capable of explaining everything in nature. At first it could be altered and extended so as to bring new phenomena under its scope, but-ominous sign!-with each extension it became more intricate and, to all appearances, more artificial, until finally it broke loose from the facts altogether; nothing could make it fit. Even in its most intricate form, it still predicts that gravitating bodies should bend starlight only half as much as they are observed to do; it still predicts that the perihelion of Mercury should stand still, instead of advancing round the sun at about eighty miles a year. The principle suffers from the fundamental defect that it supposes bodies to be moved by mechanical force, whereas the theory of relativity has banished force, and, indeed, mechanism in general, from nature. Actually the principle, and the mechanical concepts on which it was based, received their death-blow in some experiments which Michelson and Morley performed with simple mirrors and lenses in 1887, although it was not until many years later that the scientific world became convinced of this. A mechanical conception of nature fits the events of everyday life in which we do not go far from home exceedingly well-as also does a conception of a flat earth. But as science has extended the scope of its operations, viewing the farthest depth of space and even the cosmos as a whole, and penetrating into the hidden recesses of the atom, this mechanical concept has failed: it left off bringing law and order into the phenomena of nature, and brought contradictions and nonsense instead-much as the concept of a flat earth would bring contradictions and nonsense into the efforts of a Zetetist to describe his travels to distant lands. We have already seen how the average man thinks of the objects of the world as arranged in a three-dimensional space, while its occurrences take place in a one-dimensional time, a sort of ever- flowing stream, so that we can say: this event happened at such an instant in the course of time, this other event at another instant lower down the stream, and so on. Like the flat earth, this scheme fits the facts well enough so long as we stay near home; it is perfectly sensible and logical to say that the Battle of Hastings took place at a certain region of the earth's surface, at a certain point of time which we designate as A.D. io66. Yet we now know, thanks mainly to Einstein and Minkowski, that such a procedure is only sensible 6</page><page sequence="5">THE MATHEMATICAL ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE and logical so long as we, and all the objects with which we are concerned, move much more slowly than light. We have no direct knowledge of the objective existence of either space or time; we simply infer them both from everyday experiences in which space and time are both involved. And the theory of relativity has shown us that for the general phenomena of nature the concepts of space and time are equally meaningless; the only proper framework for the representation of these phenomena is one in which space and time are inextricably welded together, three dimensions of space being combined with one of time, so as to make something which is neither space nor time-the four-dimensional "space-time" con- tinuum of modern physics. Each of us individually divides this into three dimensions of space and one of time, but our division is as subjective and as local as the Aristotelian division of the three dimensions of space into one vertical and two horizontal. This latter division was "local" to people residing on the same small bit of the earth's surface. Our special division of the space-time continuum into space and time is "local" to people who are moving through space with the same speed as ourselves. When we arrange the general phenomena of nature in the new four-dimensional space-time framework provided by the theory of relativity-when we project them on to such a background-they become consistent and make sense; if we refuse to do this, they become mere nonsense and compel us to abandon our belief in the uniformity of nature. Thus we must give up our old belief in space and time as objective realities, and replace them by a new framework, in which it is meaningless to speak of a point of space or an instant of time. Points in the framework represent events; the distance from one event to another is called the "interval," and involves a blend of space with time. Our old principles of "shortest length" and "least time" cannot even be expressed in this new framework; the only principle which can possibly have any consistent or logical meaning is one of "least interval." And in actual fact this principle is found to govern and to predict the whole motion of the universe, except possibly for the internal motions of the atom. It equally governs the motion of a ray of light and of a moving body, and it remains valid-or so we suspect, although this is not fully confirmed yet-whatever physical agencies are in action, whether gravitation, electricity, or what not. The presence of a gravitating mass such as our earth does not "draw a body off from its rectilinear path," as Newton thought, by exerting forces; it twists up the framework so that the path of "least interval" itself becomes curved. The flat-earth heretic who took to travel might begin by drawing 7</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHY a flat map of the earth on which to record his journeys-it would be the ordinary Mercator projection. On such a map he would find that all steamship courses looked very curved; in the northern hemisphere the shortest course from point to point always bends towards the north pole, so as to "take advantage of the shorter degrees of longitude up north." The traveller might at first think the ships were pulled out of their courses by some attractive force towards the north pole-this would correspond to Newton's concept of a "force of gravitation." Then one day all his theories might be upset by the discovery that these tracks actually were the shortest possible, in spite of their apparent curvature. After this he might set his thinking faculties to work, discover that his two-dimensional map did not truly represent the facts, and devise a map drawn on the surface of a sphere-this would correspond to Einstein's work of I9I5. When once he had grasped the concept of a spherical map, he would see that it fitted all the facts. He would at once see that his ships had appeared to follow curved tracks, not because forces were pulling them out of their courses, but because the framework of latitude and longitude, which actually is twisted by the curvature of the earth, had been artificially untwisted in his projection. The curvature is inherent in the framework of latitude and longitude, and not in the ship's course; in unnaturally uncurving the one, an apparent curvature is introduced into the other. And it is the same with the curved paths of a cricket-ball or of a planet round the sun. The true curvature which is inherent in the framework of latitude and longitude on the earth's surface causes this to curve back on itself and close up into a finite surface. It is the same with the curvature which Einstein's theory imposes on the space-time frame- work. This causes the framework to curve back on itself and so gives us a finite universe. It is in this way that we now believe that space is finite, and it is geometry that makes it so. A framework which curves back on itself and closes up does not necessarily resemble the earth or a sphere in its geometry. At first Einstein thought that the closing up of the universe was more like what we obtain when we roll a sheet of paper into a cylinder, so that in one direction there was no closing up at all. This one direction he identified with time, so that space became finite while time remained infinite, extending from an eternity back in the past, through the present, to an eternity in the future. Recent work by Lemaitre and others suggests that this cylinder must be replaced by a cone or horn-shaped surface-again with time for the open axis. Space, which is the cross-section of the horn, is still finite, but it for ever expands as we move outwards from the mouthpiece of the horn-i.e. as time advances. Time itself has a beginning in the past, although not very clearly defined, represented by the 8</page><page sequence="7">THE MATHEMATICAL ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE mouthpiece of the horn. But there is no end in the future, time running steadily on from some instant not very long ago to eternity, with the spatial universe expanding all the time. At first sight this may look like a mere phantasy-mathematics run amok. Yet we seem to be driven to it not only by theory, but also by what appear to be well-established facts of observation; the expansion of space obtains direct observational support in the apparent recessions of the great extra-galactic nebulae. If the observations are taken at their face value, these nebulae are running away from us and from one another at terrific speeds, ranging up to I2,300 miles a second, and the details of their motions are just about what we should expect if space were actually expanding. I have tried to describe how Hero's first simple synthesis of the two laws of Euclid has been gradually extended and modified until it has finally emerged as a general principle covering all the pheno- mena of nature. We used to think of it as applying to particles of matter and to rays of light existing and travelling in a framework of space and time. But in the process of making a perfect fit between the principle and the observed facts of nature, we have had to discard space and time as objective realities; forces and mechanism have dropped out of the picture altogether, and we have discovered that, whatever matter and radiation may be, they are very different from anything we used to imagine. In spite of all this, the principle has retained its mathematical form practically unchanged since it was first enunciated more than twenty centuries ago. While the mathematical principle has stood fast, one physical dress after another has been tried with a view to clothing it-and none has been found to fit! For just as Hero was unable to give any physical or mechanical explanation of his simple principle, so modern science is unable to give any physical or mechanical explanation of the new and wider principle; we have an almost complete and perfect knowledge of the principle itself, but none as to the nature of the objects with which the principle deals; a particle and a ray of light can still be expressed only as mathematical symbols. If we must try to interpret the principle, perhaps our best course will be to translate the old interpretation of Maupertuis into modern language, and attribute the principle of "least interval," as he did that of "least action," to the infinite perfection of nature. This perfection is of a purely mathematical nature, and this encourages us to say that the physical universe is constructed on mathematical lines-or, as Plato said, that God for ever geometrizes. Other developments of modern science lead us to the same con- clusion. Time after time, when physical concepts have introduced confusion and inconsistency into science, the concepts of pure 9</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHY mathematics have come to the rescue, and restored law and order. Broadly speaking, it is true that treating the ultimate problems of nature on physical or mechanical lines has not been successful, while treating them on mathematical lines invariably has been successful. To see the full significance of this, let us glance at the general history of scientific thought. Briefly, man's efforts to interpret nature fall into three epochs, which may be suggested by the words animistic, mechanical, and mathematical. The first covers the period up to Galileo and Newton; the second the period from Galileo and Newton up to the beginning of the present century; the third the period from this date to the present time. The animistic period was characterized by the error of supposing that the course of nature was governed by the whims and passions of beings more or less like man himself, by the capricious wills of good or evil spirits or of gods and goddesses, wood-nymphs or demons. The mechanistic period came when physical science applied itself to the study of inanimate matter. The simplest way of affecting inanimate matter was to push it or pull it by means of muscular effort. And, so long as men could only experiment with objects which were comparable in size with their own bodies, the whole of inanimate nature appeared to behave as though its constituent pieces exerted pushes and pulls on one another, exactly similar to those we exert on them by the action of our muscles-it was in this way that the science of mechanics had its origin. Each piece of matter was supposed to exert a "force" on every other piece, and these forces produced the motions of the bodies in question, or rather the changes of motion. It was found these could all be explained by postulating a quite simple scheme of forces. The force which A exerted on B was equal in amount to that which B exerted on A. When the forces were gravitational or electrical, the bodies need not be in contact; increasing the distance between A and B then decreased the amount of the force in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance A B, and so on. For a long time this scheme seemed to provide a perfect interpretation of inanimate nature-as indeed it did so long as, to return to our flat-earth comparison, we did not wander too far from home. Thus it came about that, until near the end of last century, science proceeded on the assumption that the whole external world neces- sarily behaved in a mechanical way. The scientist saw himself surrounded by an ocean of machinery, and assumed that all the phenomena he observed resulted from the activity of this machinery. The deadly working hypothesis that all nature must ultimately I0</page><page sequence="9">THE MATHEMATICAL ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE prove to be mechanical pervaded the whole of the physical science of the nineteenth century, and much effort was directed to inferring the nature of the machinery from the phenomena. Then, as science began to wander farther from home, its inferences as to the nature of the assumed machinery became first confused, and then contradictory and absurd, until finally there was only one inference possible, namely, that the assumed machinery did not exist at all. Science began to see that the assumption of a mechanical universe in which objects pushed one another about, like players in a football scrimmage, was as much an anthropomorphic error as the earlier animistic universe of our primitive ancestors, in which events took place according to the caprices and whims of gods and goddesses. Man had freed himself from the error of imagining that the workings of the universe could be compared to those of his own whims and caprices, only to fall into the similar error of imagining that they could be compared to the workings of his own muscles and sinews. So far scientists had proceeded on the same general lines as the child and the unreflective savage; out of the impressions registered through their senses, they had built an inferential world of external objects which they believed to be real. The ingredients of this inferential external universe which still survived in I900 were space, time, material bodies, forces acting on these, and a substantial ether which filled all space and transmitted forces. Twentieth-century science, penetrating to the farthest depths of the universe, has swept these away one and all-not from choice, but from necessity. They had to be swept away, because their presence introduced confusion and inconsistency into the scientific picture of the world. Space and time, it is true, have not been swept completely out of existence, but they have lost all individual identity, and become merged together to form something different from either-the space- time "continuum." Had science continued to pursue its old methods, it might next have tried to draw a concrete picture of this continuum. Actually it followed a very different line. For just about this time, mainly under the guidance of Poincare, Einstein, and Heisenberg, it came to recognize that its only proper objects of study were the sensations that the objects of the external universe produced on our senses. The dictum esse est percipi was adopted whole-heartedly from philosophy-not because scientists had any predilections for an idealist philosophy, but because the assumption that things existed which could not be perceived had led them into a whole morass of inconsistencies and impossibilities. The new policy was not adopted of set purpose or choice, but rather by a process of exhaustion. Those who did not adopt it were simply left behind, and the torch of knowledge was carried onward by those who did. II</page><page sequence="10">PHILOSOPHY To take an instance, nineteenth-century science, in its blind faith in a mechanical universe, had supposed that where electric effects were transmitted from one point to another, as in radio, there must be a substantial medium-the ether-to transmit them. Now that science has failed to find any direct action of this ether on our senses, it has dropped the ether out of its stock of concepts, and finds that in so doing it can reduce the phenomena in question to complete order and consistency. Another example has already been mentioned. The old scheme by which forces produced changes in the motion of objects was based upon the assumption that objects moved in an objective space with a speed which could be measured against the flow of the river of time; in brief, it assumed the existence of objective space and objective time. As soon as Einstein discarded these assumptions, and with them the now meaningless concept of force, he was able to reduce the phenomena of the whole universe to law and order, through the principle of minimum interval, which forms the central concept of his theory of relativity. This procedure saved science from making assumptions, anthro- pomorphic or otherwise, which had no counterpart in external nature, and set it free to study the observable universe, the world which is capable of affecting our senses, aided of course when neces- sary by intensifying instruments such as telescopes, microscopes, photographic plates, electrometers, galvanometers, and all the other paraphernalia of the physical laboratory and the observatory. It naturally studies the behaviour of the phenomenal world in a mathematical way, partly so as to be able to describe and discuss this behaviour with complete exactness, but partly also because it is the only objective way. The poet may see poetry in the universe, the artist may see art, the moralist may see purposiveness, but these are all subjective-the art, poetry, and purposiveness are as much secondary qualities of the universe as colour and smell are of separate objects in it. Just as colour-blind men are incapable of seeing colour, so many are blind to poetry and art. But all can agree on exact measurements. Hence the objective pre-eminence of the mathematical way of regarding the outer world. It is then inevitable that the picture which modern science draws of the external world should be mathematical in its nature; it could not be otherwise. The essential point is not that the picture is mathematical, but that a particular kind of mathematical picture is successful, and this with a kind of success such as is not shown by, let us say, the aesthetic, poetic, or moral pictures of the universe -there is nothing to correspond to the mixture of evil with good, of the unbeautiful with the beautiful. The secret of nature has yielded to the mathematical line of attack. I2</page><page sequence="11">THE MATHEMATICAL ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE This picture is one from which everything has dropped out except purely mental concepts. Again, it may be said that it could not be otherwise, since science has deliberately excluded all else from its purview. But the essential point is not that science has done this. It is that science found itself forced to do this by the hard facts of nature. One physical concept after another has been abandoned, not from choice but from necessity, until nothing is left but an array of events in the four-dimensional continuum. Science, studying the arrangement of these events, finds that this is of an exceedingly simple mathematical kind. It might reasonably have been expected that the discovery of the arrangement would disclose, or at least suggest, some reason why this special arrange- ment prevailed rather than another. It is as though we had set out to study the fundamental texture of a half-tone print, and had found this to consist of regularly spaced dots. Incidentally this would not of course imply that the picture might not have, say, a moral or aesthetic value-such values are not the province of science. The point of interest to science is that when we had discovered the fundamental texture of the picture, this might have been expected to tell us something as to its physical nature, something, for instance, as to the substance on which the picture was printed. But in its present-day picture of the universe, science is unable to discover anything about the dots except the exceedingly simple orderliness of their arrangement. Every attempt to assign a meaning to the dots has so far led to mere confusion and inconsistency: nothing seems to possess any reality different from that of a mere mental concept. To take an obvious illustration of this, the finite space of modern science is most easily understood as a mental concept; we can hardly picture it as a physical reality. If we try to do so, we are at once asked what is outside the space. What can there be except more space, and so on ad infinitum?-which proves that space cannot be finite. The concept of an expanding space raises similar questions. What can space expand into, except more space? And if it does so, the space which expands cannot be the whole of space, and so on, whence it follows that the whole of space cannot be expanding. Thus we cannot attribute any reality to the space of the universe, except as a mental concept. In part, of course, this merely reaffirms the necessity for abandoning the objective reality of space; we have already seen that space cannot have any objective reality except as one constituent of the continuum. But similar considerations apply to the continuum itself, the one entity in which science absorbs all others, and to which alone an objective reality seems possible. We find that we must regard this too as bounded, and I3</page><page sequence="12">PHILOSOPHY unless we treat this also as a mere mental concept, we are con- fronted with the question as to what lies beyond the boundaries. Thus at present any attempt to treat either space or the con- tinuum itself as other than a mental concept seems to lead to con- fusion and contradiction. Yet it may of course be that precisely through these concepts science is leading us to a new kind of reality, hitherto unimagined by us. If this is so, I do not know whether the old conflict between realism and idealism still has any meaning in the light of the findings of modern science. If it has, which I doubt, it seems to me that the statement of the alternatives would have to be somewhat as follows. As science conducts us along the road from our perceptions, through superficial appearances and our first hasty, and possibly erroneous, inferences as to their origin, until we finally reach the law and order which we are now finding to lie behind them, does the prospect we see become more like or less like that at the start of our journey? Realism, of course, expects the answer "less like," because it maintains that the journey carries us away from thought to a reality, which it believes to be of entirely different kind from thought. Idealism expects the contrary answer, believing that the journey carries us from thought, through possible illusions, back to thought. I may as well admit I hardly expect that this will be accepted as a fair statement of the case, but if it should be, it seems to me-although many will disagree-that modern science distinctly inclines towards the answer for which idealism is waiting. But she can make no claim to be all-wise-indeed, she is only just beginning to learn-and if she is prudent she will add that she may con- ceivably again exercise her privilege of changing her mind. Perhaps it would be even more prudent to say she does not know-or perhaps that she finds the question unintelligible. I4</page></plain_text>
