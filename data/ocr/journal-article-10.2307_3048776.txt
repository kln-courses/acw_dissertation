<plain_text><page sequence="1">FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO MARTINI, Trattati di architettura ingegneria e arte militare, ed. Corrado Maltese, transcript by Livia Maltese Degrassi, 2 vols., Milan, I1 Polifilo, 1967. Pp. lxviii + 616; 331 pls. L. 30,000. In this publication Corrado Maltese and Livia Maltese Degrassi have edited and annotated four manuscripts constituting a part of the fundamental literary work of Francesco di Giorgio Martini (1439-1501). These manuscripts are Cod. 148 in Turin, Biblioteca Reale; Ashburnham 361 in the Laurenziana, Florence; Cod. S. IV. 4 in Siena, Biblioteca Comunale; and the Trattato in the first ninety- eight folios of Cod. Magl. II. 1. 141 in Florence, Biblioteca Nazio- nale. This publication is a definitive first edition; it presents almost the whole oeuvre as well as the textual interrelationship of these descriptive writings about architecture and engineering. Against a background of meager or antiquated or obsolete studies of manuscripts attributed to Francesco di Giorgio, this excellent pub- lication of the Trattati is most valuable. Authors and publishers have successfully achieved a superbly balanced arrangement of a transcript of four manuscripts, full illustration of one and the greater part of a second. Every eccentricity of writing, whether it is Francesco's or that of the scribe, is recognized and placed in foot- notes or in separate sections and in two sets of a "Catalogue of Drawing Pages," all composed discreetly and with evident regard for accessibility and legibility. By the range and size of illustra- tions from Cod. 148 and Cod. Magl. II, 1. 141, the reader sees the exact physical relationship between texts and drawings and their continuity. Now that these volumes are in print, a project should be undertaken for a third, that should include the machines and for- tresses of the Magliabecchiana manuscript. In the meanwhile, this fine edition should promote new studies in a field so long neglected. Among issues reserved for the introductory chapter are analysis and interpretation of the material now in print, and the quest for a chronology based on documented facts and new evidence in the form of manuscripts discovered in this century. Maltese gives a thoughtful and persuasive defense of the evidence, although he is hampered by a scarcity of publications on engineering preceding the work of Francesco in Siena and others in Italy and northern Europe. Maltese's study of lexical elements in a stesura (finished draft-composition) represented by Cod. 148 and Ashburnham 361, which are copies, yields his theory that the autograph drawings in the latter manuscript were completed and set aside in order to continue work on a more extensive project (Cod. 148), giving spe- cial care to its drawings, reviewing texts, and entering illustrations. He explains the loss of technical precision in Francesco's drawings in Cod. 148 as caused by the monotony of duplicating drawings previously introduced in Ashburnham 361. He assigns Harley 3281 (MS 24949, British Museum) and the Codicetto, both of which are authentic, to the years 1472-77, as the former manuscript seems to be the Opusculum for the Duke of Urbino. The enrichment of phrasing about military stratagems in Cod. 148 and Ashburnham 361 over the Codicetto is said to have been stimulated by humanists in Urbino. Maltese rightly sees the engineering contents of Cod. 148 as a renewed study of material in the Codicetto, although he does not know that the latter is almost entirely derived from Mariano Taccola's notebook. The drawings of Cod. 148 were gradually en- tered in 1481-84; Francesco then went to Cortona where he de- signed the church of the Calcinaio in 1484-85. The addenda of antique monuments in Cod. 148 was worked on until 1486. Francesco had been forced to use poorly translated excerpts from Vitruvius in his early manuscript. Maltese proposes that Francesco sought a better translation, which is now in Cod. Magl. II. 1. 141. It was written ca. 1486 in Urbino by his hand, following the dictation of the translator. Through a judicious examination of all complex factors and nuances in the language, writing and revisions of another pair of manuscripts, of which the first is Cod. S. IV. 4, Maltese concludes that Francesco's second stesura, now lost, was revised by humanists who provided philosophical additions and erudition to his fundamental material. He began work on it in 1487-89, continuing on it in Campania in 1491, but doing no work on it while he was briefly in Milan in 1490. Its counterpart is Cod. Magl. II. 1, 141, published by Promis in 1841 as the Trattato</page><page sequence="2">440 The Art Bulletin of 1491-1500. The confident rendering of drawings in this Trattato suggests to Maltese that Francesco once again restated his own drawings. While we await the publication by Michelini Tocci of the Vatican Codicetto, the folios of which measure slightly more than one inch, we may propose some review of the theory that the drawings in Cod. 148 and Magl. II. 1. 141 are by Francesco's hand. Two incontrovertible groups of drawings testify to Francesco's early and late styles, and these differ greatly from the Trattati drawings. In first place, although not authenticated by Francesco's hand- writing, is the Opusculum de architectura (Harley 3281), formerly in the library of the Duke of Urbino, and accepted by Maltese as an authentic work. It was discovered and partly published by A. Pop- ham and P. Pouncey as recently as 1950. Maltese offers a plausible date for it in 1474-77, although it may be dated earlier. Then the Taccuino del viaggio of 1489-93 contains Francesco's annotated sketches. I may suggest the earlier year for the Taccuino, because Francesco was then in Gubbio and probably made sketches of antique buildings in Spoleto. The date of the Opusculum and the Codicetto may be advanced in time, because the vigorous yet delicate modelling of five swim- mers in the Opusculum, their postures and proportions, are best re- lated to Francesco's figures in miniatures of De animalibus, ca. 1463, to the statue of St. John the Baptist, ca. 1464, and to nude youths in the Coronation of 1471. Francesco's figure of Abbondanza on a triumphal car in the opusculum is posed in a manner taken by the Virgin Annunciate in a panel of ca. 1471, and the same pose is adopted for the Christchild in Neroccio's altarpiece (No. 282) of 1476. The triumphal car of Mars in the Opusculum is drawn by horses like those painted in the St. Benedict stories of the early 1470's. Evidently the Opusculum was prepared by Francesco in Siena and later brought to Urbino. None of the Trattati figures has the quality of penwork and the anatomical articulation of the Opusculum figures, so delicate yet forcefully modelled. The Trattati figures, including swimmers, are invariably soft and dainty, like those in the St. Benedict cycle. Pictures by Francesco's pupils in the 1490's, such as the Novella panels and the Stripping of Christ, contain figures posed in the manner of the anthropomorphic columns and the sketch of the Cal- limachus legend shown in the first stesura of the Trattati. It is not possible to agree with Maltese that uninspired drawing in Cod. 148 is due to tedium. Academic dullness is characteristic of this artist's style. Francesco could not sustain boredom over the period of time it took to produce this quantity of drawings. One annotated draw- ing by Francesco on fol. 6v fairly leaps off the page. Certain features of the elevations of classical monuments in Cod. 148 indicate that at least four of these were derived from the Taccuino of 1489-93. Since Cod. 148 was written by one scribe, it was wholly executed in the later 1490's, not before 1486 as is pro- posed by the finding published by Buddensieg. Each of four eleva- tions and many more among the classical monuments from Spoleto, Rome and Tivoli in the Taccuino is marked with an X to indicate it was copied or is selected for copy. We follow the copyist's hand at work in the set of four presented in Cod. 148, noting that he translated Francesco's composition of a few sketchy lines with exacting precision, as most professional copyists do. His following of Francesco's vague lines in the sketch of the Tempio alla Fonte del Clituno near Spoleto resulted in neatly outlined blocks in the intercolumniation. He did not know what the lines represented, but he makes it clear to us that he could not reject any of them. It is hard to believe that Francesco di Giorgio would forget what they represented and rework them in this feeble way. Certain character- istics in the drawing of elevations among the antiquities in Cod. 148 indicate copywork. There are faults of unconnecting lines be- tween structural parts in some drawings. In others, raking cornices do not rest on the cyma, as they do in Francesco's sketches in the Taccuino. There are additions without structural significance at the side of the Septizonium, and the whole left side of the Antonine temple is bungled. In numerous drawings architectural ornament is finely rendered, but it appears against a void or non-existing wall surface which it is intended to articulate. Francesco's sketches in the Taccuino are proof that he recorded only a few lines, not enough to allow a copyist to do more than draw them accurately and straight. Many plans of antique monuments in the Taccuino are marked with an X and they recur in Cod. 148 addenda. Finding stylistic and architectural elements of the antiquities section carried over into marginal illustration in the section of the book devoted to temples and columns indicates that there are no hard and fast boundaries in applying illustrations to a book or adding them to previously formulated texts. Certain examples of architectural membering in the chapters on temples and columns, including the church fagade with a dome in the style of Leonardo, have classical features that differ from ornament in the Palace of Urbino; they resemble only remotely the interior ornament of the church of the Calcinaio, worked on after the 1490's. In attributing the copywork (Cod. 148) to the 1490's, it is still possible to assign the autograph manuscript or at least the greater part of its texts to an earlier date. Maltese notes that Francesco had previously represented without descriptive texts many engines of Cod. 148 in refined form in Harley 3281, the Opusculum. Many more of these engines have earlier representation as well as Italian texts in the Codicetto. The prior sources for these are in Mariano Taccola's De ingeneis, De machinis, and a notebook, ca. 1427-53, and the workshop copybooks of engineering drawings with de- signs of Brunelleschi and other engineers (in pls. 89-98). Those from Taccola include such things as chimneys, water conduits, siphons, mills, pumps, hoists, haulers, cars, military devices, diving equipment, pontoons and a ferry (pls. 40-41, 46-49, 78, 110-14, 124-25). Francesco's carri falcati are based on Taccola's notebook rather than Valturio's De re militari of 1472, so the latter date need not apply to the Codicetto and Cod. 148. Francesco's Codicetto may date before 1469-71 when he worked on fountains and aqueducts under contract with the General Council of Siena. He brought it along to Urbino and it entered the Vatican Library from the ducal library. His gathering of drawings and descriptive texts for the first stesura began in the 1460s. There are almost more texts than drawings from Taccola's work in Cod. 148 and Ashburnham 361. They range from random sen- tences to whole paragraphs in Italian, translated from De ingeneis, De machinis, and the notebook. These are used in a slight way in the first chapter on fortresses where the architect is defined, and</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 441 in chapters on temples, hoists and mills, water sources, and siphons. They appear very extensively in descriptions of hydraulic engines, cisterns, fountains and tunnels in the chapter on private houses. Francesco also adapted for his own purpose, in the chapter on tem- ples, Brunelleschi's opinion about the work of the architect. Doubt- less he had read it quoted in Taccola's notebook. Another item which may come from Taccola's influence is the use of symbols for cross-references to drawings in the second stesura. When Fran- cesco's phrasing is not an exact translation of Taccola, or when his drawings of engines are variants of Taccola's, they seem to be developed and amplified through Taccola's basic formulation of practical methods in construction. It leads directly to Francesco's form of descriptive writing; it partly explains why his own fame increased in the measure to which that of Taccola was eclipsed. Francesco's contributions in the engineering field have not yet been recognized but they surely exist. Many long paragraphs from Taccola's De machinis of 1449 (Lat. 28800, Munich) are paraphrased in Italian in Francesco's chapter on military science and stratagems in Cod. 148, so it is Siena not Ur- bino where these developed. They are similarly worded in a manu- script (Add. 34113, British Museum) first cited in 1950 by A. Pop- ham and P. Pouncey in their notes to Harley 3281. Francesco's texts in the Codicetto are also paraphrases of Taccola's Latin. Since the minute size of this work cannot have allowed Francesco to translate them while doing the sketching, evidently he had help with Latin in Siena. It seems possible to propose that Francesco was formulating and revising the pictorial material for this stesura of the treatise in 1490 when he was in Milan. The part of Add. 34113 with a copy of Taccola's De ingeneis in translation includes the name of a city, Leboncie (after a village near Domodossola), and the drawing style of some narrative scenes is clearly north Italian. In this codex, Francesco is named author of Della providentia della guerra and some of its texts are transcribed. It is merely a translation of Taccola's writing and illustrations finished in 1449, but it is strik- ingly similar to the wording in Cod. 148. A group of formulas on metalwork in Add. 34113 correspond in content and order with texts about metals in Cod. 148, a section that is not in Ashburnham 361. Thus the engine drawings of Add. 34113, the Opusculum and Cod. 148 are closely interconnected. Francesco's sojourn in Milan and Pavia probably affected the quantity and themes of drawings in this first stesura. The pages in the first chapters on fortresses, bridges, city-plans, temples, thea- ters, columns and private houses are crowded with drawings in margins. The textual descriptions are usually independent of the marginal illustrations, except for general statements about drawings placed at the end of paragraphs, as if they were afterthoughts in the copied version. Francesco collected and composed drawings un- til the time of the stesura issued in S. IV. 4, judging from the way certain buildings have almost identical illustration in three manu- scripts. In the margins of Cod. 148 and Magl. II. 1. 141, these similar sets include plans and elevations of fortress complexes and fortress towers, city-plan compositions (modified only in that the later versions consistently show a later form of round tower with a conical roof), the human bust adjusted to the entablature profile, human figures in relation to column shafts, and column shafts with measured cross-section in simultaneous showings of two views. Paradoxically, Cod. 148 and Ashburnham 361 contain many draw- ings of the human figure or bust in relation to architectural parts, yet the analytical guidelines for this proportioning are written in the second stesura. Vitruvian scholarship flourished at the Sforza court. Giacomo Andrea di Ferrara, architect and Vitruvianist, ar- rived there ca. 1480, and Leonardo's friendship with him in Pavia in 1490 is well-documented. Another science-the study of man- is symbolized in the drawing of a human skeleton on fol. 16v. In addition to Leonardo's drawings of this type, Milan had those of the noted students of medicine and geometry Gerolamo and Piero Marli- ani. A two-views showing of architectural members was a major innovation in geometry and perspective. The device was first worked out and proposed for artists by Piero della Francesca in his De prospectiva pingendi written between 1480-90 and dedicated to Federigo, Duke of Urbino. In Francesco di Giorgio's writing (Cod. 148), this type of drawing in marginal addenda is placed near trans- lated Vitruvian excerpts about the method of composing the entasis of column shafts. However, the Tratttati drawings seem only to propose a module proportioning of capitals and column bases to the diameter of column shafts. There is a wide gulf between the innocent wording of the Vitruvian excerpts on the one hand, and the scientific method and refined classicism of the drawings on the other. With a basic text prepared, Francesco di Giorgio could select drawings from a large reserve and distribute them in manu- scripts as he wished or as he instructed his copyists. The plans of basilicas and round temples in the chapter on tem- ples probably accrued to the autograph manuscript through Fran- cesco's experiences in Milan and Pavia in 1490, or at least through his acquaintance there with Bramante of Urbino, Luca Pacioli of Borgo San Sepolcro and Leonardo among others. The initial letters of classic form used in Cod. 148 may perhaps be owed to the method taught by Pacioli, who was then working on a treatise on architecture. Indeed, some of Pacioli's oddities in architectural terms coincide with Francesco's: tigraphi for triglyphs (in Cod. 148 and Francesco's Vitruvius translation), tetrante, and others. The quadratura aspect of Francesco's drawings may also have been pro- moted by discussions with men of science and art in Milan. Strangely, in the chapter on columns, there is no concordance be- tween the marginal drawings of human proportions in relation to columns and entablatures and the nearby Vitruvian texts that do not mention this proportioning method. These and the Vitruvian figure in a circle seem to have been fostered by theoreticians in Leonardo's circle in Milan. Pacioli's brief citation of human propor- tions and columns is a late reflection of such discussions. There is little likelihood of Francesco's originality in this area before his sojourn in Milan because his writing undertaken in Siena and Urbino does not express the theory which is here set down in graphic form. Cod. 148 includes many plans of basilicas and round buildings, the former with intricate arrangements of spaces at the domed transepts with radiating chapels. These features far exceed Fran- cesco's design of 1484 in Cortona, which is frequently reflected in sketches of cities in Cod. 148, and they differ with almost all con- temporary architecture in central Italy. The plans compare instead with the Certosa and Cathedral of Pavia, with new structures in</page><page sequence="4">442 The Art Bulletin Milan by local Lombard architects and Bramante, and with Leo- nardo's drawings of basilicas and domed churches in MS B. These "Lombard" plans are represented in Ashburnham 361 which con- tains notes in Leonardo's hand, so they were probably added to Fran- cesco's autograph version of this stesura in 1490. Other drawings were added to chapters on temples, columns, private houses and gardens. A case in point is the drawing of a tree-trunk column. It is related to Leonardo's sketch in the Codex Atlanticus and to columns in Bramante's arcade of the Canonica in Milan of the late 1490's. Other Bramantesque concepts are the drawings of capitals and col- umns (on pls. 20, 24, 26) with clear moldings in thin bands against smooth planes, and an entablature section resting on the capital. Bramante first used these in constructed form in the cloister arcades of the monastery of Sant' Ambrogio of 1497-99. A variant com- bination was reproduced in architectural paintings in the Sala della Pace in Siena, a work attributed to Pietro degli Oriuoli perhaps in 1491 after designs by Francesco di Giorgio. A drawing formulated on legend at an early time was considered by Francesco a personal symbol of the architect and his work. Cod. 148 has a literary description without illustration of Dinocrates' anthropomorphic form of Mt. Athos, its building and water source. Its exact figurative form and symbols, shown (later) only in Magl. II, 1. 141, is a drawing of a nude youth-Dinocrates wearing the lion's skin of Alexander-holding a bowl and a fortress. It is placed near another version of the legend where the word tazza is substituted by fonte. However, on the first folio of Cod. 148, a (new) drawing of the human figure in the outline of a fortress plan accords perfectly with Francesco's newly formed manifesto on the fortress. The statuesque figure of Dinocrates-Mt. Athos in Magl. II. 1. 141 resembles Francesco's early work rather than his late sculptures and paintings which are full of dynamic and free move- ment. On account of similarities in physiognomy and stance with the Scipio Africanus of ca. 1497, the Dinocrates-Mt. Athos drawing must be attributed to a pupil of Francesco di Giorgio. It should be possible to identify this artist who is presently nameless. GUSTINA SCAGLIA Queens College of the City University of New York</page></plain_text>
