<plain_text><page sequence="1">Celtic Ornament, Irish Gospel Book Decoration, and the Illustrated Prose Lancelot of Yale 229 Elizabeth Moore Willingham As certain decoration in The Book of Kells (TCD MS 58) and the motifs of early Irish and Pictish Christian carvings are thought to trace some of their influences to the art of pre-Christian Egypt and Eastern Christianity,1 Irish-inspired Gospel Books may have offered the most beautiful and artistically sophisticated models to book decorators in the secular workshops of the late thirteenth century.2 The elaborate decoration of the large, Old French secular codex known as Yale 229 (The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University), a compilation of three parts of the Lancelot (Vulgate), suggests certain aspects of Gospel Book 1 Trinity College Dublin [TCD]. The shelf mark of manuscripts cited is shown within the text and notes at the first mention. For The Lindisfarne Gospels, see the site sponsored by the North East Museums, Libraries and Archives Council. Regarding Eastern influence in Insular Gospel Books, see the catalogue description of The Lindisfarne Gospels (Cotton Nero DIV) at The British Library's Digital Catalogue. Also see The Book of Kells, f.7v, "Virgin and Child with Angels," (an image mirrored on a grave stone at Iona). The two images are compared with a Byzantine model in The Book of Kells: The Work of Angels? (VHS 2000). 2 Swartwout (1932) devoted his work to questioning accepted assumptions about monks as artists and builders using documentary evidence, but many of those assumptions persist over seventy-five years later. He addresses this "hypothetical dividing line between the ages of monastic and of lay supremacy in art," asserting that most of the artists working in monastic ateliers were not monks (Ch. Ill "Monastic Artists"). Swartwout quotes A.H. Springer on the period from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries in which Springer found that from twice to three times as many artists working in the monasteries he surveyed were laypersons as "clerical." Even so, Springer's "figures for clerical artists" are deemed "too high" (Swartwout 24-25 and appendices). Thus, when artists took their craft into lay ateliers, the skills and the formative environment may have been "monastic" without the artists having been so.</page><page sequence="2">ORNAMENT IN YALE 229 decoration and of Celtic ornament.3 Both the external circumstances of medieval book production and the internal evidence of Yale 229 suggest that these earlier models, each with its eclectic embrace of diverse and beautiful forms, are consciously reflected in the art of Yale 229. M. Alison Stones (1992) affirms Yale 229's artistic link to religious book models when she speculates that the master artist of Yale 229 may have spent most of his life illustrating devotional books. At the same time that he worked on Yale 229, she finds that he was also at work on a Franciscan Psalter (Paris, BN, lat, 1076: 229). Among the external evidence of Irish books having had a significant effect on English and Continental book production are the obvious modes of Irish invention and practice that became standard: word separation, "Insular" scripts, the use of initials, and certain marks of punctuation.4 Scholars often cite evidence of contact and exchange between the Irish and Continental centers of book production. Colum Hourihane (2001) writes that "close cultural connections existed between Ireland and Italy . . . from the sixth century onwards," and notes that "this [habit of pilgrimage] has been proposed as one possible transmission route" to explain their shared "iconographical programmes" (61). St. Columbanus and other Irish monks following his example established monasteries around the present-day U.K. and Western Europe, where monastic scriptoria continued the insular tradition of book production.5 Christopher Calderhead, who documented the making of the St. John's Bible, writes that monks were known to travel considerable distances to view a particular manuscript. A list of Celtic manuscripts labeled as "Libri Scottice" appears in the oldest St. Gallen (Switzerland) catalogue, dated as early as 750, an 3 The Shailor catalogue is available online through the courtesy of the Beinecke and also in print. See also, Shailor's Catalogue (322-331). 4 These elements are widely discussed. See Fair's "Introduction" (1997) for summary and bibliography (especially 16-17 and notes). 5 See Stalley's exposition on the exchange of styles and the role of clerical travels in the process that created "Insular" style in his introduction to "Insular [Hibemo-Saxon] Art" (870-878). 300</page><page sequence="3">ELIZABETH MOORE WILLINGHAM earlier date than that usually assigned to The Book of Kells.6 Other evidence of a far-flung exchange arises from the fact that the blue of the Kells decoration came from modern-day Afghanistan, the source of lapis lazuli, the basis for ultra-marine blue at the time (de Hamel Craftsmen 62). Speaking to the issue of whether a French book artist of the later Middle Ages could have had Insular models and experience, Janet Backhouse (1997) cites the "interdependence" between England and France during the period that Yale 229 was created. Michelle P. Brown identifies Insular "interlace" as a part of "Franco-Saxon" style when it is brought from the Continent back to England in manuscript illustration early in the Carolingian renovatio (i.e. roughly, the last quarter of the eighth century; see Groves 875). Stones (1996) cites a later, secular example of the travels and influence of certain illustrated codices on later productions directly related to Yale 229. She suggests that BN fr. 95 (containing the middle sections of the Lancelot) and Yale 229, probably created as "sister" manuscripts in Northern France, may both have arrived in Italy by separate routes during the fifteenth century, and that their decorative features exerted an influence on Italian Arthurian manuscripts in "a channel of iconographic influence" (204-205). Stones observes that in working through the vast decoration of a BN fr. 95, presumably produced prior to Yale 229, the decorator developed his ideas of decoration in "interesting directions" (227). For the purposes of this discussion, the term "Celtic" will refer to elements found in "Insular" manuscript decoration, made in the Irish or Hiberno-Saxon tradition. Insular manuscripts use Celtic decorative elements seen in Hallstatt and La Tene style artifacts and in "Celtic revival" styles seen in Post-Roman occupation metalwork that is designated "Ultimate La Tene."7 These added features are 6 See the Work of Angels?, for an interview conducted with the St. Gallen librarian. 7 The manuscript tradition I refer to includes such often-cited examples of Gospel Books as The Cathach of St. Columba (Irish Royal Academy MS S.N.); The Book of Kells; The Lindisfarne Gospels; The Durham Gospels (Durham Cathedral Library, fragments found in separate codices: MS. A.II; MS C.III; MS C.III); and in lesser-known examples like The Gospels of MacRegol 301</page><page sequence="4">ORNAMENT IN YALE 229 described as Germanic, Pictish, or Anglo-Saxon, thus Hiberno Saxon. Insular manuscript decoration resonates with the curvilinear detail, interests, and motifs of Celtic metal and stone artifacts, some dated well before the Christian Era.8 The Gospel Books "celticize" Christian forms like the vine and the cross, reinterpreting these and other Christian symbols as one might invent a mediated word on a borderland between nations, using characteristic features of articulation from both sides of the divide. Other adaptations include fantastic composites and stylized human and animal forms with detail borrowed from Pictish and Germanic styles and turned to Gospel Book uses. Even though the decoration of Yale 229, by means of the presence of some of these elements and a high degree of artistic consciousness in their use, appears to owe a clear debt to Insular manuscript decoration, it is just as obvious that Yale 229's decoration is distinct from Insular Gospel Books in broad aspects of its results and implied mandate. Yale 229 lacks the lavish carpet pages and the decorative density of The Book of Kells and The Lindisfarne Gospels (British Library Cotton MS. Nero D. IV.), though significant areas in Yale 229 are left open and could have been so used.9 Where these Gospel Books use the broad canvas of the page to create text woven into decorative elements, the folios of Yale 229 are divided into two columns of text, and decoration is arranged around them. Yale 229's columns of text contain the illustrations, and a letter of the text becomes a part of the illustration only infrequently. Text and embellishment do not combine on a large scale in Yale 229 as they do in Lindisfarne (see the Incipit pages: St. (Oxford, Bodleian Library, Ms. Auct. D.2.19). Later Irish religious art maintained its Irish or Celtic character, rather than bowing to Continental style. See Harbison's article "The Otherness of Irish Art in the Twelfth Century" (2001), which treats aspects of the "manuscripts of the 'golden age'" (i.e. Kells, etc.) in the context of noting the differences between Irish art of the twelfth century and Romanesque styles. 8 See, for example, Irish archeological finds given in Brindley (1994) and Green (1989). 9 The closing folio of the Agravain is mostly blank, and the verso before the Queste is left entirely open. 302</page><page sequence="5">ELIZABETH MOORE WILLINGHAM Mark f. 95r; St Luke f. 139r; St John f. 21 lr, for example) and in Kells. Another significant difference between the manuscript decoration of Yale 229 and that of Insular gospel manuscripts is that Yale 229's decoration (excluding two-color border work) is frankly narrative in that the characters, places, and events of the text are represented in the illustrations and that marginal decoration also tells a story, whether or not we can interpret it plausibly at this chronological and cultural distance. Marginal decoration may suggest a reversal of the main narrative, a parody of a character engaged in some action, or it may emphasize an aspect of the main narrative (like wounding, imbalance, or sexual conduct). Linking the marginal scene to the main narrative on some folios is problematic in that marginal figures appear to be acting out some tale of their own. In the Gospel Books, the principal decoration does not generally illustrate narrative directly, though text and decoration compose an indivisible artistic and textual unit.10 With these notable exceptions acknowledged, elements of Insular decoration are yet clearly and consistently present in Yale 229. The Book of Kells presents the earliest extant example of an historiated initial, a feature that becomes a staple of secular illustrated manuscripts, including some three dozen in Yale 229. At folio lr (fig. 1) [all referenced illustrations follow article], a somewhat painterly historiated initial opens the text and features a vivid blue background with gold embellishments.11 Also in Yale 229, one observes elements from gospel and religious book 101 refer to the implied activity in Kells of marginal and initial-bound animals (zoomorphic figures) who are shown reacting to the text in some subtle way, or interacting with one another in ways that could be deemed "narrative." The so called "Arrest of Christ" (f.l 14r) may reference the text. See Farr (1997) for the liturgical and scriptural background. 11 By accessing &lt;http://beinecke.library.yale.edi^rbldl/&gt; and searching "arthurian," the reader sees the image of a large brown book, Yale 229 in its older binding.

In addition, the skillful use of gold, pattern, and color in design, a realistic depiction of detail shown in the shadow and lines of drapery, armor, and other clothing, and a sympathetic portrayal of human and animal expression follow the high standards of Insular Gospel Books. Among repeated motifs, an occasional head or even group of heads unencumbered by bodies or topping a zoomorphic form appears, and human and animal figures are caught in the process of shape-changing.12 Men, fantastic creatures, and familiar animals chase, hunt, hide, fight, and bite, as in Gospel Book margins and carpet pages, enlivening the upper and lower landscapes of Yale 229 and sometimes transparently reflecting the narrative. Figures are occasionally called into service to support a miniature with hands or teeth, or to form the border of an initial. Celtic examples of this kind of activity appear at the terminals of columns and in the serpentine "biting" designs in The Book of Durrow (TCD MS.A.IV.5) carpet page at f. 192v. Such examples are found in later Irish church carving, such as that in the column-capital decoration at Ballintober (Ballintubber) and Boyle Abbeys (the Monastery of Boyle) and at Christ Church Dublin, among early twelfth century examples cited by Stalley(184-186).13 In addition, Yale 229's artists used religious decorative elements common to Insular Gospel Books. Christ is made "flesh" on Yale 229's vellum in the ever-present grape leaf, rendered in realistic and stylized forms; in the fruits of the vine; in the meandering and lacing 12 Stones notes the severed head motif in Yale 229 in the incident in which Lancelot discovers a severed head and eventually restores it to the tomb where his grandfather's body lies, but Stone's interest is not in connecting such aspects ofthe art of Yale 229 with Celtic design. 13 Stalley (1987) refers to these carvings (first quarter of the twelfth century) as "Romanesque" but their Celtic or Irish character is clear, especially in the human figures and in the entwined beasts. See Staley (page 185, figs. 194,195, 196, and 198), where little faces are set among the leaves. Cf. E. M. Jope's examples (Illus. II 145-47). 304</page><page sequence="7">ELIZABETH MOORE WILLINGHAM vine itself (interlace, vine scroll); and in representations of the cross. On a few pages, the decoration is biblical, didactic, or liturgical: representations of Adam and Eve and of the sacrifices of Cain and Abel validate the narrative bloodline, provide visible cautionary tales, and affirm typologies and themes expounded in the text; the soul of the pious and long-suffering King Mordrains is taken into heaven by angels (267v); Perceval is visited by Christ in his trials (217v); and Christ/Josephe celebrates the Eucharist (269v). Yale 229's illustration often takes hermits and their hermitages as its subject (75r, lOOv, etc.), places a bishop or an angel in the margins (267v, 269v), or furnishes an illustration with censers and candles (lr, 269v). The legs of the royal bench14 of Yale 229 and various other ornaments suggest the Chi or Chi rho (see fig. 9 following) and the cross forms an architecture around a significant number of Yale 229's decorated pages (75r, HOv, 126r, 132v, etc.). Insular Gospel Books, by their nature, abound in symbols of the Eucharist, and are rich in the cross and Chi rho and in fish (the sign and monogram of Christ), vines, chalices, flabella, grapes, and representations of the host. While many folios of Yale 229 are text folios without illustration, the margins around the text are decorated in ways that demonstrate a high level of artistic intention, invention, and consciousness?and funding?, for this secular manuscript. Foliate border designs in red and blue, and framed gilt initials (from one to four) are usual on the text folios. The gilt initial is framed within a blue and red or blue and pink background, divided on the diagonal, with impressionistic vegetal and animal designs and white detail laid on over the shaded, colored backgrounds, as one sees in Yale 229 at f. 45v(fig. 3). On fully decorated pages, such as folios 99v and 183v, inter-columnar and marginal decoration becomes a "page architecture" with upper and lower "landscapes" on which real and fanciful figures suggest a tale told in the margins, (figs. 5 &amp; 6) The method of embellishing colored forms with lighter or white strokes delivered with the point of the brush (or a quill?), mentioned 14 This backless bench on which the king is usually seated (at 272v, fig.9, for example) looks Roman in origin, and is not the high-backed throne we usually associate with the king and the court. 305</page><page sequence="8">ORNAMENT IN YALE 229 above in relation to f. 45v (fig. 3), and of outlining painted forms with solid points or tiny circular strokes, I will call "punctilist," adapting the Latin punctus (point) to indicate these ornamental details.15 These embellishments suggest an adaptation into paint from the decoration seen on early Celtic bronze metalwork (on shields and vessels), seen, for example, in "dimple" form on the Gundestrup Cauldron's figures (silver 300-100 BC), and on a gold bowl whose entire decoration is achieved with contrasting flat (unworked) forms surrounded by tiny bosses ("pimples," rather than "dimples").16 In Insular manuscript decoration, these points outline figures and letters and may create fill patterns within figures. The "filler" style is seen in The Book of Dimma (TCD MS.A.IV.23) in the figure of St. Mark (30v) and in the Eagle of St John (104v); and in The Book of Durrow's Lion of St Mark (in the porcine face) and within the lace along the frame (19 lv). These "small bosses" (Harbison) in metal and stonework become tiny circles and "dots" on the manuscript page of Yale 229, usually done in white. In Yale 229 at f. 43r (fig. 4), punctilist work sets light around the miniature and along the blue and pink bodies that lead into the frame of the initial. This miniscule detail appears in tiny curls of vine along thicker pink vine / leaf / body within the ascender from the historiated initial, and in the white detail in the elongated blue leaf that forms a brief, upper landscape. 15 Terming this kind of embellishment is problematic. The punctus, of course, has its own use in the field of punctuation. Fair refers to comparable decoration outlining a cross in Kells as "a contour of dots, a device used in Late Antique manuscripts to bestow decorative emphasis" on certain initials (17). See Jope's examples (501-44) from metal and pottery ornament, characterized in metal as "dimples" or small bosses, and in pottery as "stipples." In seeking a designation to describe this embellishment, borrowing the late nineteenth-century term "pointillist" ("dots" of pure color densely applied to create the entire image, like the tiles of a mosaic made of very small fragments) does not work since the process and aim are entirely distinct. 16 On the Gundestrup cauldron, note the filler on the body of the snake and on several other creatures (see the forelegs of the gryphons), and in the layered relief surrounding the vegetal designs. The "chased gold bowl" was discovered in Switzerland and is housed in the Schweizerisches Landesmuseum, the Swiss National Musem in Zurich (Green 138 fig. 58). 306</page><page sequence="9">ELIZABETH MOORE WILLINGHAM On this upper "ground," a dog chases a rabbit and plays out the frequent marginal theme in Yale 229 of the chase or hunt (f. lr (fig. 1), 99r, 183v). The theme is presented in the decoration of Kells (with animals such as the cat and mouse and with chasing animals), and it appears in examples of metalwork frequently cited as La Tene.17 In some sense, all hunting or chasing scenes tell a story, and in Yale 229, these reference the narrative of Yale 229. A signal feature of the debt owed by manuscripts such as Yale 229 to Insular book art is the relationship between text and decoration, executed as an artistic unit in the Gospel Book, and realized in Yale 229 in illustrations and marginal responses to the narrative. Insular echoes appear on the text f. 45v (fig. 3), where two-color and gold vertical borders frame the text in a leaf-profile-and-tendril design, and four decorated initials comprise the decoration. One sees the same kinds of artistic values evinced in this simple decoration that one sees in the finely illustrated and decorated pages. There is significant attention to detail, a meticulous use of gold, a deliberate program of alternation in color, variation of form, a tolerance for asymmetrical conception, a subtle balancing of some forms, and a high standard for artistry.18 Within the frame of the three L initials on f. 39r (fig. 2 another text-only page) and f. 45v (fig. 3), curves, spirals, and punctilist detail are done in white on alternating backgrounds of pink and blue. Significant to the artist in the context of Insular decoration is his use, not only of the curve and spiral on the decorated initials and borders, but his use of tendrils and spirals as the means of terminating his vertical borders, especially clear on f. 39r. The b-column terminals (upper and lower) of f. 45v form triskeles, and, considered with their source lines, they suggest 17 La Tene as a period and style was studied by E. C. R. Armstrong (cited by Mahr). See Mahr (1932,1941). See "La Tene" in the Dictionary of Art (Turner, ed.). See Dillon &amp; Chadwick for Gaulish and Iberian work in metal (figs. 9,10). 18 This mode of decoration begins on f.9r with red verticals, continues in red through f.49v, changes to blue verticals on f.50r, and returns to red on f.56r. Jope describes instances of asymmetry ("dissymmetry") in Celtic art and ornament (Text I "Anatomy of Insular Early Celtic Ornament," esp. "Symmetric Layouts" 1337 ff). 307</page><page sequence="10">ORNAMENT IN Y ALE 229 crosses as well.19 The triskeles of f. 45v are formed of elongated leaves, and the vertical border is made of leaves in profile, variously interpreted, a recognized component of Celtic ornament.20 In the same column (at 45v-b) the artist has created an "owl face"?though "human" or "puffin" may be suggested?in the initial L. The two E initials on this folio may also intend this "face," and the initial P at f. 43r(fig. 4), as well. In the L, two faces, one inverted over the other, appear on the opposing color grounds of pink and blue within the space contained by the high flourish at the base of the L. Such faces are frequent motifs in Yale 229 and in Celtic art and are also referred to as masks or monster faces.21 Such a "face," on an Irish bronze disk, is called "a stylized representation of the human 19 Curves, spirals, and triskeles are found in the Late Celtic or Ultimate La Tene revival and recall early Celtic stone carving and metalwork ornament. Triskeles and trumpets appear in metalwork, as well as in the "fill" decoration within larger forms in The Book of Kells and in the vining (scrollwork, interlace) that ornaments the folios of Yale 229. See Jope's examples, 551 ff. One of the earliest examples is a megalithic stone, carved in spirals and dated around 2500 B.C., found at the entrance to a tomb (New Grange, County Meath). Images of this stone are frequent in books on Celtic and Irish art. See the introduction to G. Frank Mitchell's Treasures of Irish Art, which contains some of the clearest color reproductions of Irish artifacts. Jope (II) contains over 900 images. Mahr gives 130 large, non-glossy black-and-white plates. At this time many artifacts may be fruitfully searched electronically, by name or descriptors in an online image search. 20 See Jope's discussion (Text 1344-346) of the Celtic use of leaves as ornament and their impressionistic and curvilinear results on artifacts (Illus. II). 21 Garton pictures some examples of these large-eyed heads in her treatment of human and animal heads and interlace in church stone sculpture. See several "angle-head" examples (especially Glendalough, County Wicklow, St. Savior's, chancel arch capital, plate 3) and various animal heads "biting" (see examples from plates 6,7, and 8). See Jope (Illus. II) for suggestive designs (with roundels and bosses) among those at 747-749; 756-919, and esp. 772 (having the "undeniable effect of grimacing face" [sic])', Nos. 810, 821, 857, and mirrors are also informative. See Stalley's later examples (Cistercian) at Tintem Abbey where the faces (or heads) are described as "secular in spirit" and look like death masks. Stalley writes: "vigorous modeling of the faces has few parallels" in Ireland (1987 189). Cf Jope's "face" examples (Illus. II, 145 -147). 308</page><page sequence="11">ELIZABETH MOORE WILLINGHAM face" by Harbison (1988: 182). The design also appears on the Battersea Shield, where four "faces" symmetrically surround the boss of the central motif.22 Quite similar is the "two-eyed" curvilinear design repeated around the reverse side of the Birdlip mirror (Jope Illus. 244-47; Dillon fig. 26) and similar artifacts (cf. Jope pi. 238 ff.) The earliest extant example of this effect in Celtic (Irish) art may be a macehead in stone in the National Museum of Ireland (Brindley 23, Brindley fig. 5), which, without the handle, indeed looks like a human face, with strokes appropriately placed for the hair and beard. In Celtic metalwork, animal figures mutate into new forms as the viewer's perspective moves around the piece: a bull becomes a fantastic beast, and a bird's tail becomes the beak of another bird, etc. This malleable perspective is modified for the medium of the codex surfaces in Yale 229 where the artist depends on the reader's cumulative memory to develop the changing perspective. As the viewer's eye follows figures from folio to folio along the organic path of the decoration, prominent features of beasts?beaks, wings, tails, and various paws and feet?appear attached to new figures and modified in some fresh way on figures that previously featured them. In other designs, features are conflated and confused so that the viewer has a puzzle to unravel. One such conflation that may reflect Celtic influence is the bird's head terminal of f. 43r that reaches into the text to the right of the historiated initial (A for Apres), and in the apparently disembodied mammalian (lion) head that appears at a curious intersection of bodies toward the upper left corner of the asymmetrical initial. The bird's head, on a pink neck, appears to connect to a blue, winged body that descends in a tail as a part of the border, but the forms are conflated and their connections, difficult to discern. The "lion" head?perhaps with its mouth wide, ready to bite?is turned around on an ambiguous neck. Is it the pink neck moving upward (see the dorsal fin and white feet)? Or is the blue, pink-winged one moving down the page? The convergence of forms 22 Dillon and Chadwick place the Battersea shield as an example of the "Gallo British tradition of Celtic art." Jope dates it as "not later than the second century B.C." (Text 333, see detail villus, pl. 76 ff). 309</page><page sequence="12">ORNAMENT IN YALE 229 is something of a visual puzzle, and in that, it recalls the mischievous character of certain Celtic Gospel Book decoration. Impressionistic and imaginative animal postures and foliate designs in the foregoing examples recall the Ultimate La Tene style (post Roman Conquest), known for curvilinear detail realized in triskeles, curves, spirals, scrolls, and trumpets. At f. 99v (fig. 5), the ornament within initials, several of the larger designs, and elements of the borders suggest Hiberno-Saxon patterns of interlace. The artist makes use of leaves to form spirals, curves, and triskeles, and uses stems and vines as a source of interlace in the upper and lower landscapes. Below, figures with female heads, human upper bodies, and the lower bodies of fish play stringed instruments and "float" just above a land- or seascape made of elongated blue leaves, detailed in white and curling into spirals at either end. Pink leaf-triskeles emerge from either end of the blue-leaf spirals and each holds a tiny green fruit at its tip. Three three-lobed leaves?the grape or the shamrock?serve as terminals in the center design where the Chi rho or cross is suggested in the turns of leaves and vines. Arrangements in threes at the center of the lower landscape include three three-lobed leaves and two groupings of three red fruits / red leaves. The curve of the king's bench (one inverted and one upright) mirror the throne suggested by the wings of the central figures above.23 I also suspect that the vining and fruits intentionally form an inverted mask or face of some indeterminate creature or possibly an "owl face" with a beak formed in an unpainted area and the eye hollows formed by the curling blue vine, terminating in red "fruits" as eyes. This particular example is especially reminiscent of the faces of Celtic artifacts. At f. 99v (fig 5), one sees the consistent and lavish use of gold that encloses the text in narrow, layered borders and calls attention to decorative detail by introducing bright points of light onto the page. Notice in this regard, the curving sweep of the stylized leaves, each enhanced in gold. Generous application of gold embellishes borders 23 For an example of the shape of the king's chair or bench, see the upper register of the large miniature at f.272v (fig. 9) and its echo in the design above the mid-column space. In both examples, lion heads form the terminals of the chair and orange paws are its feet. 310</page><page sequence="13">ELIZABETH MOORE WILLINGHAM and initials and forms backgrounds for illustrations and the least of the marginal objects in Yale 229, reflecting the applications of gold in certain Gospel Books as well.24 On the upper landscape at 99v, gold enhances the center design as a lighted ground, and accents elongated leaves in blue (left) and pink (right) that curl into vining and terminate in triskeles that are formed by stylized leaves of the opposite color of the base leaf (i.e. blue, right; and pink, left). The lower arm of the would-be "triskele" at the left is cut short by scribal necessity. In a good number of instances, goldleaf places light where there would otherwise be shadow behind the principal design as around the winged lion-headed serpent above and the elaborately layered center design below. Compass-and-ruler-drawn building architecture, such as architectural columns, arches, windows, doors, and roof lines, accented in gold and carefully detailed to suggest a castle, church, or town (see the double miniature at f. 99v (fig. 5)), form columns and arches within which gospel narratives are outlined and compared in parallel tables. The townscapes of the secular manuscript Yale 229 also recall the castle, church, and civic architecture of rooftops, walls, and towers in liturgical manuscript decoration.25 Somewhat more skilfully represented architecture appears in the double miniature at f. 183v, where exterior architectural features of the upper register present a fa?ade of crenellated walls, roof, and tower with interiors showing on either side. The lower register's exterior 24 Whitaker refers to the "aesthetics of light" (based in gold, silver, and brilliant color) as informing the beauty of the thirteenth-century Arthurian manuscript page: light directly suggests the nature of God since light is "the least material" component of the visible world (borrowing on Ruskin, cited, in Whitaker 22 n.44). 25 Backhouse (1997) features several apt examples in selected folios dating from the seventh to eleventh centuries (15-34). Backhouse, Turner, and Webster (1984) give a variety of examples from "Anglo-Saxon" manuscript culture (46 51). Alexander (1992) provides examples of Canon Tables of Gospels under architecture (7) and of city architecture from a later religious manuscript, that of the New Jerusalem (Douce c. 1270, fig. 63 p. 43).

Insular decorative models are reflected on f. 183v in the rendering of horses' manes and human hair as "locks" and the well delineated folds of drapery worn by the figures of the miniature suggest the Insular model in delineating human hair in curling locks, a method that appears to reflect how hair is worked in wood, metal, and stone.26 Models for these kinds of detail in Insular work appear in Kells in the so-called "Arrest of Christ" (f. 114r); in the "Portrait of St. Matthew" (f. 28v); and on the Liber generationis (f. 29r).27 At the lower left of f. 183v, the lacing suggests the "owl-face," the throne, and the chi rho. At the far right and left, carefully executed white puntilist detail follows the whole of the design going toward the terminal shapes.28 26 These characteristic renderings are attributed by Pirani (1966, 1970) to Master Honore and those under his direction. Pirani credits Honore with BN 95, said by Alison Stones to be a "sister manuscript" to Yale 229, but this is highly unlikely, and no other art historian as far as I am aware has made such an attribution. Nevertheless, see examples in Pirani (116-121) and a folio from an Honore example (Add. MS 54180) in Backhouse (1997 97). 27 A good source for these images is Bernard Meehan's The Book of Kells. 28 Interlace has been called "ribbon" by various art historians, and Budny characterizes it as "fabric" whose "strand[s]" do the lacing. Interlace, however, is entirely unlike ribbon in its flexible and turning nature because even silk ribbon does not bend, turn, braid, weave, knot, and flow in smooth curves from a single strand without considerable twisting and pressure and the result is not flowing, as interlace is, at a close look. Fabric, of course, does not turn and curve at all unless it is cut on the bias of the weave, and then must be coaxed and prodded. An artifact like The Book of Durcow (TCD MS.A.IV.5) verso that faces St. Mark's opening page would probably suggest weaving with bias cut fabric to anyone familiar with laying down such a pattern in textile as a medium. On the other hand, vines?like grape vines, which are green, opportunistic, and supple?bend, curve, curl, and twine in nature, suggesting a botanic inspiration for most aspects of interlace. Tendrils, prominent in Yale 229 within the interlace (see lower left, f.l83v, for example), must come directly from the botanical example. The coiled and supple postures of snakes are a possible inspiration for some examples of interlace, from the zoological perspective. Generally, the postures of snakes (unless they are in mass 312</page><page sequence="15">ELIZABETH MOORE WILLINGHAM Also of possible interest in terms of older Celtic motifs on f. 183v is the attention to severed human and animal heads on this page: at the right terminal of the upper landscape, a creature is about to be beheaded; below, three heads in white, green, and orange observe the text and decoration from the right margin, and the game along the lower landscape appears to parody the theme with a competition intended to "behead" a duck. The three heads emerge from a blue neck that begins as a leaf and morphs into a serpent's back; the winding neck is an extension of the center arm of a three armed spiral that is constructed of leaves. This folio (183v) also contains an intriguing lower left marginal design that arises from a series of connected leaves and leaf stems that become vines (with tendrils) and then become leaves again, but in the opposing color. The white ornament on the pink marginal bar and within the central design shows painstaking attention to regular detail, even in a marginal venue. With perhaps a nod to the Insular manuscript tradition of incorporating the cross and chi rho into the decoration, the cross is made serviceable and symbolic in Yale 229, as is seen in the marginal work on the folios so far examined. The sword makes a convenient form for suggesting the cross in a chivalric text, as on a chivalric gravestone, like the many located on the Island of Iona. In Yale 229, an example of an interesting cross cum sword made from an initial L appears at f. 139r The hilt, suggesting the king's bench in its curving horizontals and the X (Chi) at the upper terminal, are formed from six pink leaves in various sizes with gold accents and orange fruit. Tiny "new" leaves serve as terminals. White and orange points ornament the blade and perhaps draw attention to its role in the beheading shown in the miniature. At f. 346r, a compressed but rather dynamic and anthropomorphic X appears at the base of the intra-column decoration. Multiple suggestions of the Chi rho appear in the complex turnings of the design. Fairly often in Yale 229 the cross forms an "architecture" around the text, as on f. 346r, where the suggestion of a head, arms, drooping hands and out-turned feet hibernation) lack the intricate quality of vines and leaves that is present in Celtic interlace and in that of Yale 229. 313</page><page sequence="16">ORNAMENT IN YALE 229 form a crucified human figure in an organic unity of leaves, vines, and fruit. The formation and ornamenting of the cross from the elements of the grape vine stand as witness to Christ's words in John 15:1, "I am the true vine," and the vine stands as a witness to the sacrifice of the cross, as is accomplished with like symbols in the Gospel Books. In spite of its secular material, a certain odor of sanctity hangs over the decoration of Yale 229. As the pre-Christian elements of Celtic, Germanic, and Pictish styles were turned to the purposes of Christianity to validate the new faith for the old religionists, Arthurian narratives were turned to orthodox Christian uses in late medieval poetry and prose, and those orthodox signs in turn gave new weight to the recast narratives. In Yale 229, we see these elements at a distinct remove from the old religion, at a remove from the monastic scriptorium and the Gospel Book, dressed out in new guises that tease perception and inspire imagination.
