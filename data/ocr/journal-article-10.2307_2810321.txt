<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPIKE. The Story of a Whitetail Deer. Written and Illustrated by Robert M. McClung. Wm. Morrow &amp; Company, New York. $2.00. 64 pp.; ill. 1952. This well-written book, illustrated with dainty repro- ductions in black and white, is well suited for children 6 to 8 years of age. Covering much of the same ground despoiled by Bambi and his inhuman animals, the book avoids the insipidly anthropomorphic attitude and retains a great measure of natural behavior. Yet it has its moments of danger and excitement to enthrall children, and also of tender peace. ISIDORE GERSH</page></plain_text>
