<plain_text><page sequence="1">/ ST GILES' LECTURES. SECOND SERIES—THE FAITHS OF THE WORLD. LECTURE II. RELIGIONS OF INDIA: BUDDHISM. By the Very Rev. John Caird, D.D., Principal of the University of Glasgow. BUDDHISM is, in one point of view, a reaction against Brahmanism ; but in another and deeper point of view, it is a new step in that progressive movement of religious thought which we have en¬ deavoured to trace in the religions of India. In the former aspect, it is simply the recoil of the aggrieved moral instincts from the immoral and anti-social re¬ sults of the earlier religion, and a protest against its idolatrous rites and observances. Neither in its religious nor in its moral teaching was Brahmanism true to its fundamental principle. Pantheism, as D</page><page sequence="2">38 The Faiths of the World. we have seen, may, viewed from opposite sides, be regarded either as a religion in which everything vanishes in God, or as a religion in which everything is consecrated by the presence of God. But though both forms of religion start from a common panthe¬ istic origin, only one of them may be said to be strictly and logically true to it. Brahmanism may be described as the false or illegitimate consecration of the finite ; Buddhism as the recall of the religious consciousness to that elevation above the finite from which, in its indiscriminate deification of material and sensuous things, the former religion had fallen away. When you have begun by saying that the world and the things of the world are unreal and illusory, and that, in the whole compass of being, God is the only reality, you cannot legitimately return to rehabilitate that world which you have already denied and renounced. So far from pantheism lending its sanction to the deification of human and animal forms, or of every material object on which the superstitious imagination may fasten, its teaching would seem to be, that only by abstraction from the finite, by the mental annulling of the forms and phenomena of a world which is nothing but illusion, can we get near to God. So far, again, from finding in pantheism the basis of a morality which consecrates existing facts, and practically asserts that whatever is, is right—it would be nearer the truth to say that its ethical result is, logically, that whatever is, is wrong; and that only by emancipating ourselves from the thraldom of custom, by the obliteration of illusory</page><page sequence="3">Religions of India. 39 social distinctions and inequalities, can we rise into union with the Divine. • It would seem, therefore, from this point of view, that Buddhism must be re¬ garded as a reaction against Brahmanism,—a return to a religion of abstraction and a morality of renuncia¬ tion which are the legitimate outcome of a panthe¬ istic conception of God. Yet though, no doubt, there is some truth in this view of the matter, Buddhism cannot be regarded simply as the return of Brahmanism to its funda¬ mental principles. Like other religious reforms, it is at once a return and an advance. It reproduces in their simplicity and purity the ideas of the past, but it reproduces them with the deeper meaning which history and experience have infused into them. It reasserts the negative element involved in pantheism, and, as we shall see, exaggerates it till not only every finite and anthropomorphic ingredient, but every vestige of positive thought, vanishes from the idea of God, and we seem to be left in the absolute negation of atheism. But when we have examined the history and results of this singular religious revolution, we shall perhaps be able to discern in it something more than negation ; we shall find that the emptiness to which it seems to lead is one in which a richer fulness begins to dwell, and that, at once in what it denies and in what it asserts, it constitutes a necessary step in that process of development which is to be traced in the religious history of the world. At first sight no event in the religious history of mankind seems more unaccountable than the rapid,</page><page sequence="4">40 The Faiths of the World. widely extended, and enduring success of the religion which owes its origin to Buddha. Promulgated at first by a solitary teacher in a country in which Brah¬ manism had for more than a thousand years domin- ated the thoughts and lives of men, it succeeded in a short time in overthrowing the ancient faith and in transforming the social life of India ; and in less than two hundred years from the death of its founder, Buddhism became recognised as what, in modern phraseology, would be called the State religion. But \ more than that—inspired by a proselytising enthusi¬ asm unparalleled in any other heathen religion, its missionaries went forth spreading its doctrines far beyond the country of its birth, amongst Asiatic races both savage and civilised. It penetrated, in the * south, to Ceylon, which became, and has continued to our own day, the stronghold of Buddhism; in the north and east, to Kashmir, to the Himalayan countries, to Tibet, to the Chinese empire (where, early in the Christian era, it could claim an equal place with the religions of Confucius and Lao-tse as one of the three State religions); and finally, to the shores of the Japanese islands. In India, indeed, though for many centuries it constituted the prevail¬ ing religion, Buddhism gave way at length to a re¬ vived and modified Brahmanism; but its successes in other lands more than compensated for its extru¬ sion from its original home. Its conquests have been greater, more extended, and more lasting than those of any other religion, Christianity not excepted ; and even now, wellnigh twenty-four centuries from the</page><page sequence="5">Religions of India. 41 birth of its founder, Buddhism is, nominally at least, the religion of five hundred millions of the human race. It is thus a religion which not only carries us back through the ages to a period earlier than the origin of almost all other existing faiths, but which is still strong with the vitality of youth, and constitutes at this very moment the sole source of spiritual faith and hope to a population larger than the whole popu¬ lation of Europe, and more than half that of Asia. Yet if we inquire into the nature of the religion which has achieved a success so marvellous, the answer seems to be, that it is a religion destitute of every idea that has lent, or that can be conceived to lend, to any system of belief, its power over the human spirit. It is a religion which seems to deny the very being of God, and which refuses to man the hope of immortality. It teaches, as one of its cardinal doc¬ trines, that existence is wretchedness, and the love of it a feeling to be suppressed and exterminated—that the highest happiness attainable on earth is in the extinction of all natural desires and affections, and the only heaven beyond it utter and final annihila¬ tion. Than such a creed as this, none could well be conceived more cheerless and unattractive, more des¬ titute of either real or spurious conditions of success. Pessimism may sometimes have an attraction for ex¬ ceptive minds, or, when presented in a philosophic form, may, like any other thesis on which speculative genius wastes its subtilty, achieve, as recent experi¬ ence proves, a temporary popularity. But the limited success of the modern philosophy of despair affords</page><page sequence="6">42 The Faiths of the World. obviously no parallel to the wide and enduring pre¬ valence of Buddhism. The success of false reli¬ gions, again, has sometimes been traced to the adaptation of their doctrines to the passions and prejudices of men — to the proffer of worldly tri¬ umph and glory, or the promises of future bliss, which they presented to their votaries. But to no such appeal to human selfishness can the preva¬ lence of Buddhism be ascribed. Instead of adapting itself to the spirit of the age and the prejudices of society, it seemed purposely contrived to revolt the class antipathies and jealousies which had rooted themselves for ages in the Hindu mind, and to arouse the hostility at once of the civil and ecclesiastical powers whose authority it assailed, and of the people to whom that authority had become nothing less than sacred. Instead of pandering to the selfish instincts by the proffer of a cheap relief from the stings of con¬ science, of temporal advantages, or of a futurity of sensuous bliss, it demanded, as the condition of sal¬ vation, the renunciation of the only pleasures which most men care for; and as the reward of austere self-mortification, it held forth the prospect,—to the majority, of a long series of future penitential ex¬ istences in human and other forms—to the few, of immediate entrance on that Nirvana which is the Buddhist climax of blessedness, and which means the complete and final extinction of conscious being. To what, then, in the absence of the ordinary causes of success, are we to ascribe the rapid and permanent triumphs of Buddhism What was there in a religion</page><page sequence="7">Religions of India. 43 which appealed neither to what is lofty nor to what is base, neither to the deeper spiritual instincts nor to the lower selfish impulses of the human heart, that could secure for it a success which not even the most notable religions that have tried either way—which neither Christianity nor Mohammedanism—have at¬ tained I shall endeavour to answer this question by sub¬ mitting to you a sketch of the leading doctrines of Buddhism in their relation to the development of reli¬ gious thought. It is impossible, however, to under¬ stand the origin and the characteristic ideas of Bud¬ dhism without some reference to the life and character of its founder. Nor can it be doubted that amongst the causes to which, at any rate, its early successes were due, not the least was the singular personality and career of Buddha. As to these, our means of information are, it must be acknowledged, by no means either abundant or very authentic. The can¬ onical Buddhist works from which our knowledge is derived belong to a period at least 200 years after the events to which they relate; and though those of the northern Buddhists contain an elaborate biography of Buddha under the title ' Lalita Vistara,' yet in this work so large an element of the marvellous and legendary has been interwoven with the story, that it is difficult to disentangle from it what may have been the original element of fact. It would be a waste of time, especially within the limited compass of a single lecture, to repeat the narrative which passes with various modern writers for the life of Buddha; but</page><page sequence="8">44 The Faiths of the World. some of its leading incidents are corroborated by the somewhat earlier books of the southern Buddhists, and in its general tenor it represents an ideal too ex¬ alted to have been the mere invention of the age and country from which it sprang. It is at any rate an ideal which profoundly impressed itself on the Indian mind in a very early age, and which has exerted a deep and lasting influence on the religious history of mankind. I. Omitting details, then, which are probably the mere embellishments of popular tradition, the out¬ line of the story is somewhat as follows. In the course of the sixth century B.C., Gautama (who after¬ wards came to be known by the designation " Bud¬ dha," the Enlightened), the son of a rajah or chief of the Sakyas, an Aryan tribe of central India, aban¬ doned in early life his position and prospects as heir to his father's throne, and passed the rest of his life as a wandering religious mendicant. Various inci¬ dents, related with dramatic detail, are said to have led to this act of renunciation. But if we reflect on the influence which the conditions of the time—an age of gross and degrading superstition, and of in¬ tense social corruption—would exert on a mind of great intellectual originality, and of deep moral and religious susceptibilities, the step is one not difficult to account for. Buddha's seems to have been one of those natures, reflective, introvertive, restless, for which the problems of the spiritual life have an im¬ portance transcending all outward interests, and which are impelled to seek the solution of these problems</page><page sequence="9">Religions of India, 45 by an imperious inward necessity. In whatever form the object of spiritual inquiry presents itself—whether as the search for truth, or for the meaning and end of human life, or for the explanation of its moral con¬ tradictions and anomalies, or for salvation from sin and sorrow and death—for such natures there is no rest till the inward perplexity and anxiety are re¬ moved. Passive acceptance of circumstances is for them impossible; and if the outward conditions of life seem to conflict with the profounder needs of the spirit, we can understand how such minds, jealous of their influence, in some access of spiritual anxiety and impatience, may at one stroke shake off the bondage of outward position, and set themselves free for what they deem the great task of life—the work of spiritual thought and inquiry. The subsequent career of Buddha is in keeping with the view I have now suggested. It is the history of a soul in search of spiritual rest, of the various ex¬ periments by which he vainly sought to find it, of the success which at last crowned his efforts, and finally, of his life-long endeavour to communicate to others the blessing he seemed to himself to have attained. Of his abortive endeavours, two are specially recorded —the search after spiritual satisfaction, first, by phil¬ osophic thought, and secondly, by ascetic austerities. He had recourse, in the first place, to some of the most famous Brahmanical teachers of the time, en¬ rolling himself amongst their disciples, and listening patiently to their expositions of the great questions of ontology and ethics. But though in the doctrines</page><page sequence="10">4-6 The Faiths of the World. he subsequently taught we find traces of this sort of culture, and of his familiarity with the ideas of the so-called schools of Hindu philosophy, his studies, we are told, failed to bring him the mental peace he sought. His was not a nature which could find rest in speculative investigations or subtle dialectics. The relation of such inquiries to the exigencies of human life is too indirect to give them a permanent hold on a mind the practical side of which was so strongly developed. His moral and religious sympathies were too intense, his interest in humanity and its struggles and sorrows was too keen, to admit of his resting content with any satisfaction which abstract thought can bring. His next attempt to find what philosophy had failed to bestow was by a discipline of bodily austerities. He retired, says the story, along with five faithful friends, to a wild and solitary spot in "the jungles of Uruvela," and there gave himself up to fast¬ ing and other bodily mortifications of the most rigid kind. This discipline the youthful ascetic continued with unflagging courage for a period of six years. But perhaps it is one among the many proofs of that strength and balance of character which, through the dim light of tradition, we can discern in this great religious reformer, that the mystic visions and hys¬ teric ecstasies which ascetics have often mistaken for supernatural revelations, found no access to his mind, and that at last he became convinced that in seek¬ ing spiritual peace by any outward regimen he was a second time on the wrong track. Giving up, then, his vigils and penances, and forsaken by his compan-*</page><page sequence="11">MP Religions of India. 47 ions, to whose superficial natures this change seemed a grievous relapse, he betook himself thenceforth, it is said, simply to meditation and prayer. Translated into modern language, the attitude of his mind at this point may be said to be that of one who has renounced the idea of salvation by works, by meri¬ torious self-denials and outward observances. Was there, then, no other pathway to peace The answer came when he least looked for it. Wandering, says the story, from place to place, and ministered to by some humble women who had been touched by his piety and gentleness—still waiting, longing, aspiring after the secret of spiritual rest—at length, after a more than usually protracted period of meditation, while resting under a tree at a place which pious reverence named afterwards " Bodhimanda," the seat of intelligence, a new light seemed to break upon his mind, his doubts and difficulties vanished, and the secret at once of his own spiritual freedom and of the world's regeneration was within his grasp. This is the great moment when, according to the belief of his disciples, he became entitled to the designation by which, for thousands of years, he has been known —that of " Buddha," the Enlightened, the possessor of spiritual intelligence. What the new doctrine was, we shall see more fully in the sequel. If we said that this wondrous revela¬ tion, this idea so precious as to seem cheaply pur¬ chased by all the sacrifices and sorrows of past years, was no more than this—salvation, not by outward penances and sacrifices, but by inward renunciation</page><page sequence="12">43 The Faiths of the World. and self-devotion,—the great discovery would sound to modern ears but a trite and commonplace ethical maxim. It is, however, in all lines of investigation, a false complacency which, in the pride of modern enlightenment, looks down on the discoveries of the past, and measures the value of advances in knowledge, not by the imperfect light which preceded them, and the struggles it cost to gain them, but by the wider knowledge which in our day is the possession of all. But even if Buddha's discovery meant no more than this, that salvation, happiness, blessedness—the good, call it what you will, which is the end or goal of human life—consists, not in outward condition, but in inward character, and is to be sought, not in a future heaven which is the arbitrary reward of piety, but, here or hereafter, in superiority to all selfish desires and pas¬ sions, in the inward heaven of the spiritual mind,— even, I say, if this were all he taught, it is a doctrine not so universally accepted and acted on in our own day, two thousand years after the Indian teacher first proclaimed it, that we can afford to contemn it as trite or commonplace. From this time forward, the life of Buddha is that of the preacher or prophet of the new doctrine. Filled with a boundless compassion for the igno¬ rance and wretchedness of his fellow-men, and be¬ lieving himself to be possessed of the only truth which could save them, he went forth with enthusi¬ astic zeal on his mission of love. He proclaimed his doctrine first in Varanaci, the modern Benares, then in other cities and villages in the valley of</page><page sequence="13">Religions of India. 49 the Ganges. Gradually the fame of the new teacher and his doctrine began to spread far and wide. His zeal, his rigid self-renunciation, combined with serene gentleness and benignity, his wisdom and eloquence, and even, it is said, his personal dig¬ nity and beauty, gave strange force to the stern doctrines he taught, and won men's hearts wherever he went. Crowds flocked to his teaching, and thou¬ sands of all ranks enrolled themselves among his adherents. The schools of the Brahmans began to be deserted ; some of the most notable Brahmanical teachers became themselves his converts. The terri¬ ble bondage of caste became incapable of resisting the power of the newly awakened spirit of human brotherhood, and a moral reformation of the most undoubted character witnessed to the salutary influ¬ ence of his teaching. In the fulness of his fame and influence he revisited, twelve years after he had left it in loneliness and uncertainty, his father's court; and soon, it is recorded, his father, his wife, his son, his foster-mother, and other members of his family, were numbered among his disciples. It is impos¬ sible, however, to pronounce what credit is due to this and to many other incidents with which tradi¬ tion has filled up the outline of the latter part of his career. He is said to have lived to the great age of fourscore years, and to have found for many years an asylum in the dominions of a rajah or prince who had become one of his earliest converts. The ruins of a spacious building, erected for him by the piety of this prince, were pointed out to a Chinese pilgrim</page><page sequence="14">50 The Faiths of the World. in the seventh century of our era; and the tradition still ran that here were delivered many of those dis¬ courses which are preserved as the words of their master in the sacred books of the Buddhists. However difficult it maybe to separate the historic from the legendary and fictitious element in the story of Buddha's life, if the foregoing narrative can be re¬ garded as even an approximately accurate represen¬ tation of the facts, something at least of the won¬ derful success of Buddhism must be ascribed to the personal character of its founder. It brings before us the picture of a very rare and lofty nature. We seem to see in him a mind not only deeply reflective, but of great practical sagacity and insight, capable of profound and comprehensive views of life, able to discern the hidden causes of the evils under which society laboured, and to devise and apply the proper remedies. The impression, moreover, left on the mind by his whole career, is that of a man who com¬ bined with intellectual originality other and not less essential elements of greatness — such as magnan¬ imity and moral elevation of nature, superiority to vulgar passions, an absorption of mind with larger objects, such as rendered him absolutely insensible to personal ambition ; also, self-reliance and strength of will—the confidence that comes from conscious¬ ness of power and resource—the quiet, patient, un¬ flinching resolution which wavers not from its pur¬ pose in the face of dangers and difficulties that baffle or wear out men of meaner mould. Along with these, we must ascribe to him other qualities not</page><page sequence="15">Religions of India. 51 always or often combined with them, such as sweet¬ ness, gentleness, quickness and width of sympathy. On the whole, whilst there is in the system of doc¬ trine ascribed to him much which, to the modern mind, seems erroneous and repulsive, I do not think we shall err in conceiving of the character of Buddha as embracing that rare combination of qualities which lends to certain exceptive personalities a strange power over all who come within the range of their influence, calls forth the love and devotion of human hearts, welds together under a common impulse the diversified activities of multitudes, and constitutes its possessors the chosen leaders of mankind. II. Amongst what may be called the secondary causes of the success of Buddhism, an important place is undoubtedly due to the morality which was not only embodied in the life of Buddha, but consti¬ tuted a great part, if not the main substance, of his teaching. The tendency of the pre-existing religious system had been to dissociate morality from religion by transforming the latter either into a thing of speculation and school-learning, or into a thing of outward ceremonial. For the few who were capable of philosophic culture, spiritual perfection was identi¬ fied with a kind of esoteric wisdom, attainable only by meditation and mental abstraction. For the great mass of the people, the moral and religious instincts were misdirected into the channel of an elaborate ceremonial—of prayers, penances, purifications, mi¬ nute authoritative precepts and prohibitions appli-</page><page sequence="16">52 The Faiths of the World. cable to almost every relation and action of daily life. Now it is the singular merit of Buddhism, whatever view we take of the ultimate end to which it pointed as constituting the salvation of man, that the way by which it taught men to reach that end was simply that of inward purification and moral goodness. Outside of Christianity, no religion which the world has ever seen has so sharply accentuated morality and duty as entering into the very essence of religion, or as inseparably connected with it. If it made knowledge a condition of salvation, it was not a knowledge of theological dogmas or esoteric mysteries, possible only to acute or speculative minds, but a knowledge of which morality is the indispens¬ able presupposition, and which is to be attained by clearing the soul from the darkening influence of impulse and passion. " The highest insight," is the declaration ascribed to Buddha, " is not that which can be measured by an intellectual standard ; but it is of little use only to know that: what is of supreme importance is a change of the heart and spirit." If, again, the founder of Buddhism did not provoke the hostility of the priests or offend the prejudices of the multitude by declaring open war against the whole ceremonial system of Brahmanism, we find him con¬ stantly endeavouring to infuse into it a rational and moral meaning. " Anger," he says, " drunkenness, deception, envy—these constitute uncleanness; not the eating of flesh." " Neither abstinence, nor going naked, nor shaving the head, nor a rough garment; neither offerings to priests, nor sacrifices to the gods,</page><page sequence="17">Religions of India. 53 will cleanse a man not free from delusions,"— i.e., from the deluding influence of sensual pleasure, spiritual ignorance, and the selfish lust of life. In short, the large and important place which practical morality occupies in the Buddhist system, and the fact that, so far, it rests its claim, not on arbitrary dogmas and sacerdotal observances, but on an appeal to the conscience and the spiritual nature of man, constitutes one great secret of its strength. It would unduly protract this lecture to illustrate at any length what has now been said, by citations from the ethical part of the Buddhist sacred writings. In one of Buddha's discourses, he is said to have summed up his whole system in the following com¬ prehensive formula: " To cease from all sin, to get virtue, to cleanse one's own heart—this is the doctrine of Buddha." Besides the severer rules laid down for those who entered on the technically religious life— that is, the life of the orders of religious mendicants —there is in the sacred books a systematic digest of duties, negative and positive, which Buddha is said to have inculcated on the laity. Amongst the former are included the five cardinal prohibitions—of mur¬ der, of theft, of unchastity, of lying, of drunkenness. The positive virtues are summed up in "love of being"—i.e., benevolence to all living beings—a pre¬ cept extending not only to all human beings, includ¬ ing the lowest castes and the vilest outcasts, but also to the lower animals. From the " Dhamma-pada," or Scripture verses, a collection common to both schools of Buddhists, the following extracts have E</page><page sequence="18">54 The Faiths of the World. been given by a recent writer (Rhys Davids's ' Bud¬ dhism,' p. 128 ff.) : " Never in this world does hatred cease by hatred — hatred ceases by love ; this is always its nature." " One may conquer a thousand men in battle, but he who conquers himself is the greatest victor." " As the rain breaks in on an ill- thatched hut, so passion breaks in on the untrained mind." " Let no man think lightly of sin, saying in his heart, It cannot overtake me." " As long as sin bears no fruit, the fool thinks it honey; but when the sin ripens, then indeed he goes down in sorrow." " Let us live happily, not hating those who hate us." " Let a man overcome anger by kindness, evil by good, the stingy by a gift, the liar by truth." ''Let a man speak the truth; let him not yield to anger; let him give when asked, even from the little he has. By these three things he will enter the pres¬ ence of the gods." " Not by birth, but by his actions alone, does one become low caste or a Brahman."1 1 The following translation of a poem, embodying moral precepts ascribed to Buddha, is quoted by the above-named writer under the title "Buddhist Beatitudes : "— A deva speaks— '' Many angels and men Have held various things blessings, When they were yearning for happiness. Do thou declare to us the chief good." Buddha answers— " Not to serve the foolish, But to serve the wise ; To honour those worthy of honour: This is the greatest blessing.</page><page sequence="19">Religions of India. 5 5 There is not a little in some of these sentences to remind us, in their spirit, and even in their form, of the lessons of a greater teacher. Yet, much as has Much insight and education, Self-control and pleasant speech, And whatever word is well-spoken: This is the greatest blessing. To support father and mother, To cherish wife and child, To follow a peaceful calling : This is the greatest blessing. To bestow alms and live righteously, To give help to kindred, Deeds which cannot be blamed : This is the greatest blessing. To abhor and cease from sin, Abstinence from strong drink, Not to be weary in well-doing : This is the greatest blessing. Reverence and lowliness, Contentment and gratitude, The hearing of the Law at due seasons : This is the greatest blessing. To be long-suffering and meek, To associate with the tranquil, Religious talk at due seasons: This is the greatest blessing. Beneath the stroke of life's changes The mind that shaketh not, Without grief or passion, and secure : This is the greatest blessing. On every side are invincible They who do acts like these, On every side they walk in safety, And this is the greatest blessing."</page><page sequence="20">56 The Faiths of the World. been made of the apparent coincidences between the Buddhist and the Christian morality, it will appear, I think, on closer examination, that the similarity is in some respects only a superficial one. The main defect of the former—arising, as we shall see, out of the fundamental principle of Buddhism—is, that it is a morality of negation or renunciation. It lays almost exclusive emphasis on the passive virtues of submis¬ sion, resignation, indifference to the allurements of sense and passion, deadness to the world and the things of the world ; and if it seems to find any place for active benevolence and kindred virtues, it does so only in name, or by a kind of noble inconsistency. Its precept of universal love is only to the ear identi¬ cal with the virtue of Christian charity. The latter is essentially based on the idea of the value and dignity of man's spiritual nature as made in the Divine image and capable of an infinite destiny; but the universal love of the Buddhist has in it no element of respect for man as man, and can rise no higher than compassion towards a being whose very existence is vanity and illusion, and whose highest destiny is to pass away into nothingness. With all its imperfections, however, there can be no question that the comparatively pure and elevated morality which Buddha taught and exemplified is one of the causes to which we must ascribe the marvellous suc¬ cess he achieved in his own day, and the deep hold which his system has taken of the religious conscious¬ ness of the East through succeeding ages.</page><page sequence="21">Religions of India, 57 III. Yet moral teaching could never of itself have sufficed to create a religious revolution. A prac¬ tical morality that is not based on universal prin¬ ciples — in other words, that has not its source in religious ideas—cannot take any deep or permanent hold of the spirit of man. Moreover, so far as we can learn, Buddha's was one of those deeply reflec¬ tive natures in which the speculative instinct, the tendency to examine into the ultimate principles of things, is never wanting; and this tendency could not fail to be stimulated and developed by his long training in the schools of the Brahmans. We might naturally expect, therefore, to find in Buddhism something more and deeper than a system of practical ethics. And this is actually the case. Of the three " Pitaka" which constitute the canonical books of the Buddhists, and which, 170 years after the death of Buddha, are said to have received the sanction of his disciples as embodying the teaching of their master, one is devoted to the statement of doctrines and the exposition of metaphysical principles. Yet, when we proceed to examine into their contents, the difficulty with which we started recurs. For the strange fact meets us, that we have here what pur¬ ports to be a system of religious doctrines in which the very idea of God is left out; and though we find in it the doctrine of a future state of retribution, it is only under the fantastic form of the transmigration of the soul after death into the bodies of men and of the lower animals, and even into plants and inorganic</page><page sequence="22">58 The Faiths of the World. substances. Though, again, there is in this singular creed a doctrine of final blessedness—or, in modern language, of " the salvation of the soul"—yet that in which this blessedness consists is what is termed " Nirvana," which, according to the generally ac¬ cepted interpretation, means simply annihilation,— absolute and final extinction of conscious being. How, it may well be asked, could the personal in¬ fluence of any individuality however noble, or the practical power of any system of morality however pure and exalted, lend currency to a system of doctrines apparently so incredible and revolting How was it possible for a religion that seems to be the negation of the very essence of religion—a re¬ ligion without God, without immortality, without heaven—to gain a single sane convert, not to say to become the religion of more than one-third of the whole human race In order to answer this question, it will be neces¬ sary to examine a little more closely into the nature of the Buddhist doctrines, and the reasonings on which they were based. As, however, within our limits, a detailed examination of them is impossible, I shall, in what remains of this lecture, confine my remarks to an explanation and criticism of that doctrine of Nirvana which may be said to consti¬ tute the key-stone of the whole system. The word Nirvana is that which Buddha employs to denote the consummation of his own spiritual struggles and aspirations, and the blessedness in which he invited</page><page sequence="23">Religions of India. 59 all men to share. It was in his eyes the highest reward of goodness—the state into which only those who, it might be after ages of penitential discipline, were purified from all taint of evil, could be per¬ mitted to enter. What then, precisely, in the view of Buddha, did Nirvana mean Now on this point there has been great discussion and division, turning mainly on the question whether Nirvana is an absolutely negative idea, or admits of any positive element such as in other religions enters into the conception of a future state; whether, in other words, it means simply annihilation, or only an escape from pain and sorrow—the cessation of existence, or merely the cessation of the evils of existence, and the transition into a state of perpetual rest and blessedness. In deciding between these two interpretations of the word, etymology does not help us: for, according to different authorities, it may be translated either " blowing out," the act of extinguish¬ ing a light; or " without blowing," a state of calm which no breath of wind disturbs. Understood in the former sense, it would mean the complete extinc¬ tion of being; in the latter, the passing away of the spirit into a region where the perturbations of life can follow it no more. By some Sanskrit scholars it is maintained that " two opposite sets of expressions in the Buddhist texts, with reference to Nirvana, repre¬ sent two phases of the doctrine—the one ancient, the other modern. The original doctrine taught by Buddha is that of the entrance of the soul into rest,</page><page sequence="24">60 The Faiths of the World. while the dogma of annihilation is a perversion in¬ troduced by metaphysicians in later times." This theory has been shown by a recent investigator, Mr Childers, author of a dictionary of Pali, the sacred language of the Cinghalese Buddhists, to be unten¬ able ; and he himself propounds the theory that "the word Nirvana is used to designate two different things—the state of blissful sanctification called Ar¬ hatship, and also the annihilation of existence in which it ends." " Arhatship," he maintains, " cannot be the ultimate goal of the Buddhist, for Arhats die like other men. But Nirvana, whatever it is, is an eternal state in which Arhatship necessarily ter¬ minates ; and, therefore, expressions properly appli¬ cable to the former, might, in a secondary sense, be used of the latter." These various theories as to the meaning of Nirvana are not, it seems to me, incapable of reconciliation. The word may be employed to denote either the ultimate end to which the Buddhist aspires, or the means by which it is to be attained. In the second sense, it is unquestionably frequently applied in the Buddhist scriptures to the completion of that process of renunciation by which the aspirant after perfection seeks to kill out the love of life, and all those desires and impulses which make men cling to life. In this sense it is a state or attitude of the human spirit attainable during the present life. The Buddhist conceives it possible, by self-discipline, to extinguish in his breast not only all selfish desires and passions, but the very consciousness of self in</page><page sequence="25">Religions of India. 61 which they centre. The four " Sublime Verities," as they are called, which are represented as constituting the sum and substance of Buddha's teaching, are these : (i.) Existence is only pain or sorrow ; (2.) The cause of pain or sorrow is desire; (3.) In Nirvana all pain and sorrow cease; (4.) The way to attain Nir¬ vana is by what is called the " noble path," which means virtuous self-discipline, ending in ecstatic obli¬ vion of self-consciousness. When this last point is reached, everything that constitutes our separate in¬ dividuality—feeling, thought, the very consciousness of personal existence—is annihilated ; the oil that fed the lamp of life is drained off, and the flame goes out of itself. It is true that the man who has reached this blank mental nothingness still exists, but all that is left of his personality is the mere bodily form. When death has dissolved that, there is nothing left to constitute the basis of a new existence of trouble and sorrow, nothing to light up the lamp of life anew; and Nirvana, already virtually attained, reaches its actual consummation in death. But whilst, in this point of view, it is possible to regard Nirvana as a state of perfection attain¬ able in the present life, if we consider what it is in which that perfection consists, and the way in which it is supposed to be attained, I think we cannot hesitate to pronounce that this heaven of the Buddhist contains in it, at least explicitly, no positive element such as we express by the words " moral and spiritual perfection," but is neither</page><page sequence="26">62 The Faiths of the World. more nor less than absolute annihilation. This conclusion will, I think, be made still more obvi¬ ous, if, without dwelling on particular passages in the Buddhist canon in which Nirvana is referred to, we trace briefly the process of deduction which led Buddha to regard it as the summum bonum, the goal, of all human aspiration and effort. His train of reasoning, if so we can term it, is in substance this : There is no possibility of escape from the vanity and wretchedness that embitter human exist¬ ence but by escape from existence itself. If we examine into man's nature closely, we shall be forced to conclude that vanity and misery are not accidents of his being, but enter into the very constitution and essence of it, and therefore, that we can only cease to be wretched by ceasing to be. Take any of the elements of man's nature, and you will find it to be so. Our senses subject us all through life to the most miserable delusions. They fool us into belief in a world which has no reality. The things that please the eye and gratify the senses, are not as we seem to see them. The world is only a world of appearances that exist for the moment in us, and not in things that have any permanent reality without us. In regarding them as real existences, we are only the fools of our own fancy. Our desires and affections, again, subject us to a still more deplorable deception. They are not only directed to objects that have no real but only a phantasmal existence, but they perpetually cheat us with promises that are never fulfilled. The</page><page sequence="27">Religions of India. 63 joys of sense soon sate us. The palled appetite turns with disgust from the object that proffered it only delight, and sensuous pleasure long pursued dries up the very capacity of enjoyment, and leaves in the soul a weariness and vacuity more intolerable than the sharpest positive pain. The raptures of love, the joy of gratified ambition, the pleasures of gain, honour, worldly distinction and success, never are what in anticipation we fondly imagined them to be. A thousand drawbacks mar the sense of enjoy¬ ment ; sickness and the fear of death poison it; pos¬ session soon deprives it of its zest. It is just the man who has tasted most deeply of life's joys, whose experience of life and its pleasures has been the widest, who will be the readiest to acknowledge what a mockery it all is. It is true that he who does so discern the unsatisfactoriness of life's pleasures is not necessarily delivered from their fascination. Moral¬ ising to-day on their hollowness, to-morrow he may be lured anew by the bait he despised. But this very fact only deepens the painful sense of unreality and deception. That we have seen through it, that we know it, and yet that open-eyed we let ourselves be deceived by it—this only adds to disappointment the shame of conscious weakness, the humiliation and remorse of self-detected folly. Nor is there anything inconsistent with this conviction of the vanity and misery of human life in the fact that the man who has thus learned to despise life should still dread to quit it—that there should be an instinctive clinging</page><page sequence="28">64 The Faiths of the World. to life even in the heart that has ceased to hope for anything from it. But this, again, only serves to deepen the conviction of the ineradicable falsehood and deceptiveness of human existence, and to add to the conception of it a new touch of ridicule and absurdity. It is something like this which seems to have been the train of thought which led the deeply meditative spirit of Buddha to that conclusion which the word Nirvana expresses. Human life is only vanity, de¬ lusion, wretchedness. What is the remedy for all its ills, what the only salvation from a misery so inextricably intertwined with our whole conscious experience Is it to be found in death Does Buddha think of the grave as the place where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest, or anticipate the tone of modern sentimentalism which thinks of "our little life as rounded with a sleep," of death as the dreamless slumber in which " after life's fitful fever we sleep well" The answer is—No, death is not Buddha's cure for life's ills: for the source of these he perceived to be an inward and spiritual one—in the mind, and not in man's outward condition and circumstances ; and death, though it may change the latter, leaves the former, the true root of evil, unextirpated. Though not in the Christian form of the doctrine, Buddha, as we have seen, taught a kind of future retribution. To the soul which reaches the close of life unemancipated from its de¬ sires and passions, death is only the transition into</page><page sequence="29">Religions of India. 65 a new earthly existence, at once retributive and pro¬ bationary; and that again, when it has run its course, if the cause at once of existence and its sorrows be yet uneradicated, is succeeded by another, and so on interminably. If, then, not even in death can we find it, is there no other way of escape, no other refuge from evil Yes, Buddha answers, there is one and only one haven of rest from the storms of life, one way of salvation from all its ills. The disease is spiritual, and so, too, must be the cure. It is not life, but the desires that make us cling to life, in which the secret of our wretchedness lies. If these remain, no con¬ ceivable change of circumstances will avail us. Kill desire, extinguish feeling, quell every throb of emo¬ tion and passion within the breast, cease to care or wish for happiness, let not one pulsation of selfish feeling remain to ruffle the moveless calm of the spirit, and then Nirvana will be yours. Even here on earth you will be numbered among the enlight¬ ened and the free. The shadows which men mistake for realities will no longer befool you. The degrad¬ ing bonds that enslave them will bind you no more. All that constituted the fatal gift of individual exist¬ ence will have vanished away. And death, when it comes, instead of being only the entrance on a new cycle of sorrows, will be but the final rush of dark¬ ness on a spirit that has for ever ceased to be. Such, then, is the strange doctrine which forms the fundamental principle of the Buddhist faith. Yet, state it as you will, have we here any solution of the</page><page sequence="30">66 The Faiths of the World. problem of the wide and lasting success of Bud¬ dhism Can we conceive any human being attract¬ ed to a religion which preaches annihilation as the supreme good, the highest blessedness in store for humanity Exceptive cases there may be, in which minds unhinged by misfortune or distracted by re¬ morse have found it possible to prefer death to life, non-existence to an existence which has become one prolonged agony. " Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery," are the plaintive words of one from whose life all joy had vanished,—" wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul; which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?" And the same sentiment is expressed in the well-known words of a modern writer— " Count o'er the joys thine hours have seen, Count o'er thy days from anguish free ; And know, whatever thou hast been, 'Tis something better—not to be." The analogy, however, which these cases present to the Buddhist longing for Nirvana, is a very im¬ perfect one. That in a few rare and exceptive cases remorse, satiety, intolerable pain or shame, and the like motives, should overcome the love of life, helps but little to explain how millions of human beings should be attracted to a creed which makes anni¬ hilation the supreme good of man. Moreover, does there not seem to be a strange inconsistency between</page><page sequence="31">Religions of India. 67 this doctrine and the moral teaching and unwearied personal philanthropy of its author? Why try, by softening its hardships, to make life less intolerable or more sweet to those whose highest virtue is to cease to care for it Or again, why be anxious for the moral culture of a nature not merely destined to speedy extinction, but whose highest hope and as¬ piration is to be extinguished Why be at pains in adorning, purifying, and ennobling that which at the end of the process, and as the result of it, is to cease to exist The explanation of these difficulties is to be found, I think, in this—that here, as elsewhere, the real attrac¬ tion of a doctrine or system of doctrines is in some¬ thing deeper than its form, and that men believing ostensibly in Nirvana, really believed in the deeper truth which unconsciously they discerned beneath it. The long struggle of thought with the mystery of the world and human life, which we have traced in the Indian religions, seems to have issued only in the dis¬ covery that God is a negation, and blank annihilation the final destiny of man. But when we examine the genesis of the doctrine, we are led to the conclusion that the Nirvana of Buddhism is, at least implicitly, something more than the mere negation it seems to be, and that what gave it its real power was the positive element it virtually contained. The worship of a negation, it may be conceded, is an impossibility, and an atheistic religion a contradiction in terms. But Buddhism, though apparently, is not really, an</page><page sequence="32">68 The Faiths of the World. atheistic system. It starts from the basis common, as we have seen, to all pantheistic religions—that of the unreality, the evanescence, the unsubstantiality of the world and all finite things—and it presses this notion to a point of exaggeration at which it seems to pass into a deification of nothingness—an attitude of mind which it seems impossible to distinguish from absolute atheism. It sweeps away even that captit mortuum of a deity, the abstract substance in union with which Brahmanism found its heaven, and its only heaven is identification with the blank negation which is all the deity that is left to it. But those who thus identify Buddhism with atheism overlook two all-important considerations : first, that the nega¬ tion of Buddhism could not exist without a virtual affirmation; and secondly, that all religion, and the Christian religion most of all, contains a negative element—or that negation is a necessary step in the process by which the human spirit rises into com¬ munion with God. As to the former of these points, it needs little reflection to see that that very recogni¬ tion of the nothingness of the world and of all finite objects of desire, which in Buddhism reaches its cli¬ max, is a virtual appeal to a positive standard of real¬ ity by which we measure the world and pronounce this verdict upon it. He who avers that we are such stuff as dreams are made of, could not be conscious of that fact save by his knowledge of a real existence that is outside of the shadowy world of dreams ; and even the slumberer who only dreams that he dreams,</page><page sequence="33">Religions of India. 69 is not far from waking. Absolutely unconscious ignorance and error—the ignorance and error of a mind that is content with its aberrations au \ " lusions because it does not know them to be such—'nlply no conception of anything better ; but to perceive my thoughts to be vagaries, my notions and reasonirgs futilities—this implies that I have virtually got be¬ yond them, that I have in my mind a criterion by which I appraise and detect them; and I am at least half-way to a truth which I can already unconsciously employ as a criterion of error. In like manner, a religion whose cardinal doctrine is the negation of the finite, bears unconscious evidence to the fact that it has already transcended the finite. Before the mind that has become profoundly convinced that the things that are seen are temporal, there at least floats some vision of the things unseen and eternal; and if the vision be as yet shadowy and uncertain, that it can be even unconsciously apprehended as an ideal is the silent prophecy of a future when it shall be grasped as a reality. Have we not here, therefore, a principle which enables us to discern in Buddhism something more than the impossible worship of a blank negation In the fact that its negation was one which felt and knew itself to be a negation, in those strange dogmas which make its teaching seem but one long scornful wail over the vanity and misery of the world and human life, may we not read the longing for, and latent belief in, a higher truth, in the light of which it saw and rose above the negation F</page><page sequence="34">70 The Faiths of the World. Was it not the eternal and divine, though it could only as yet be defined as the negative or contradiction of the transient and human, which gave their reli¬ gion its secret hold over men's hearts Whilst they seemed to themselves only to seek after escape from a world that was unreal and a life that was nothing but vanity, what they really though unconsciously sought after was participation in that infinite life which is and abideth for ever. Moreover, as I have said, though religion cannot be a merely negative thing, all religious thought and feeling contain in them a negative element It is not the language of paradox which the Christian believer employs when he speaks of " dying in order to live ;" of " losing his life in order to find it;" of " bearing about in the body the death of Christ, that the life also of Christ may be manifest in us ; " of " becoming dead to the world, that we may live unto God." That self-surrender to God in which the essence of religion lies, involves, as a necessary element of it, the abnega¬ tion of self, the renunciation of any life that belongs to me merely as this particular individuality—of any life apart from God. As it is the primary condition of the intellectual life that the thinker effaces him¬ self, gives up all merely individual opinions, preju¬ dices, preconceptions—all ideas that pertain to him merely as this particular self—and lets his mind become the pure medium of the universal life of truth and reason,—so it is the essential characteristic of the spiritual life that the individual lives no longer to him-</page><page sequence="35">Religions of India. 71 self. The initial act by which he enters on that life implies the renouncing of every wish and desire, every movement of inclination and will, that belong to his own private, exclusive self, or that point merely to his own interests and pleasures ; and its whole sub¬ sequent course may be described as the more and more complete extinction of the narrow, isolated life that centres in self, the nearer and nearer approach to that state in which every movement of our mind and every pulsation of our spiritual being shall be in absolute harmony with the infinite mind and will, and apart from the life of God we shall have no life we can call our own. The error, therefore, of Buddhism is, not that in it religion contained a negative element, but that it stopped short there. In the Christian conception of self-renunciation, to live no longer to ourselves is, at the same time, to enter into an infinite life that is dearer to us than our own ; it is a death to self which rises to live again in the universal life of love to God and charity to all mankind. Yet even in that strange, morbid suppression of all human desire and passion, that impossible extinction of every natural impulse, which Buddhism inculcated, we may discern the un¬ conscious groping of the spirit of man after something higher. To be in love with annihilation, to kindle human hearts by the fascination of nothingness, is indeed an impossible aim. And if we are confronted by the moral paradox of a religion of negation which drew to itself the faith and devotion of countless</page><page sequence="36">72 The Faiths of the World. multitudes, we may be sure that the attraction was not in the negation it seemed to preach, but in the positive truth in which that negation finds its com¬ plement and its explanation. Its last word was of the triumph of death over all human hope and love; but there was here at least some dim anticipation of another and yet unspoken word which it was given only to a far-off age to hear—"When this corrup¬ tible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."</page></plain_text>
