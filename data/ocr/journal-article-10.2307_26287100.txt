<plain_text><page sequence="1">ASSUMING THE POSITION! FUGITIVITY AND FUTURITY IN THE WORK OF CHESTER HIMES Kevin Bell But there exist other values that fit only my forms. Frantz Fan on, Black Skin, White Masks In the disappeared third side of a Parisian triangle he draws between Richard Wright, James Baldwin, and Chester Himes, drink ing and fighting, advancing and recoiling, all on the terrace of Les Deux Magots on a spring evening in 1953, New Yorker writer Hilton Als, describing the scene nearly fifty years later in a profile on Himes, detects the betrayal of an unspoken ideological mandate presum ably governing the field of black American literature after the second World War. The alcohol consumed by the three writers that evening loos ens the boundaries of a hazardous zone of dense interpersonal ten sion, already laced by an ancient intertwining of fiction's force and ideology's racialist insistence. The primary fabric of this tension is a ruptural, sarcastic word-play that, without drink, might have remained soberly submerged, repressed within a public sphere essentially tone deaf to the agonistic gestures of an inchoate, expatriate black litera ture, defined from its very beginnings by the paradoxical task of making poetic sense of the multiply dislocated conditions of its own expression.

The freedom of the dialogue's violence, however, is silently enframed and brutally circumscribed throughout by the American literary rules of professionalized "blackness." The rigors of such rules policed as they are within the self-reproductive regimes of the pub lishing arm of the American culture industry—are amplified even as they are reconfigured by this interplay among artists who are rivals and, in the shared-ness of the ground each seeks, also brothers, writers who will never form an ideological or creative unit, yet who will ever be viewed within a certain unitary fusion. The scene at Les Deux Magots in 1953 is originally recorded by Himes himself in the first volume of his memoir The Quality of Hurt (1972). By Himes's account, its very arrangement is born in an an tagonistic swirl of egoism, betrayal, voyeurism, and perhaps, not so-surprisingly, fraternity: Later, as we were preparing to leave for the party, the telephone rang. When Dick returned from answering it, he wore that look of malicious satisfaction which his close friends knew so well. He asked if I knew James Baldwin. I said no, but I had heard a great deal about him ... I had read a review of Lonely Crusade that Baldwin had pub lished in the Socialist Party's newspaper, the New Leader, but I had never met him. Dick said that he had been instrumental in getting Baldwin an award for eighteen hundred dollars and a re newal for nine hundred from Harper &amp; Brothers to enable him to write his first novel. ... He said Baldwin had "re paid his generosity" by "attacking him" in a number of published articles. . . . "Now Baldwin has the nerve to call me to borrow five thousand francs (ten dollars)" he said gleefully. He had made an appointment to meet him at the Deux Magots, and insisted that I go with him. I remember thinking at the time that he sounded as though he wanted a witness . . . Then we hurried to the Deux Magots and found Baldwin waiting for us at a table on the terrace across from the Eglise Saint-Germain. I was somewhat surprised to find Baldwin a small, intense young man of great excitabil ity. Dick sat down in lordly fashion and started right off needling Baldwin, who defended himself with such inten sity that he stammered, his body trembled and his face quivered. I sat and looked from one to the other, Dick play</page><page sequence="3">848 Fugitivity and Futurity in the Work of Chester Himes ing the fat cat and forcing Baldwin into the role of the quivering mouse. It wasn't particularly funny, but then Dick wasn't a funny man. I never found it easy to laugh with Dick; it was far easier to laugh at him on occasion. Dick accused Baldwin of showing his gratitude for all he had done for him by his scurrilous attacks. Baldwin defended himself by saying that Dick had written his story and hadn't left him, or any other black writer, anything to write about. I confess at this point they lost me. (199-200) Somewhere within the sudden relocation of a conflict from the sphere of the personal and its competing narcissisms, to the more abstracted planes of the political and the aesthetic, Chester Himes becomes unmoored from the contest's stakes. Where he becomes "lost" is on the idea of a somehow "proper" program by which to write or re-present the linguistic, aural, and textu(r)al fluidity of an immanent blackness that, in Himes's own work, is always anteced ent to the local act of closure and exclusion that is racialization. Much of the cited passage gestures toward that realm of strange ness—that fevered, often ecstatic and megalomaniac blindness to the limits of one's own position in space; that blackness, which is prior to and always outside social orders of propriety, designation, and tradition. It is a plateau of nonidentity and ongoing incompre hensibility that, for Himes, designates the actual point of writing's commencement. Stage directions toward this zone of private abandon gone pub lic abound in Himes's account: the silent self-satisfaction with which Himes notes Wright's curiously "malicious" pleasure at Baldwin's embarrassing need for money; the more conspicuous editorial si lence about what Himes thought of Baldwin's review of Himes's sec ond novel; the wicked suggestiveness of the thought that Wright may have wanted and even needed "a witness" before his dealings with the suddenly-suspect Baldwin; the studied attunement to Wright's supposedly defunct humor; the sharply critical opposition of Wright's "lordly" "fat cat" to Baldwin's effeminized, nearly infantilized "stam mering," "trembling," "quivering mouse." Each of these character izations transmits an enmity born of intimacy that disrupts the scene's reportage even as it reconstitutes it, and by way of caricature in the last instance, points toward the textures of the tragicomic absurd that Wright and Baldwin tend to abjure in their own work. But at the same time, these are the vertiginous textures of self-abyss and self contradiction within which the writing of Chester Himes finds itself very much "at home."1</page><page sequence="4">Bell 849 In his reconstruction of the conversation, Als notes with a mo mentary prescience that is nearly fatally compromised by a charac teristic glibness, that Himes's quiet dis-identification that evening is at least partially a function of his aesthetic comportment, a salient feature of the singular philosophical freedom that enables his indif ference to the personal and political rewards over which Wright and Baldwin now carp. As Als writes: He was not a skilled literary politician nor was he as adept as Baldwin or Wright at self-promotion. He had never been hungry enough or insecure enough to learn the game. So, on that Paris evening, he failed to recognize that his com patriots weren't discussing the finer points of literature— that, unlike the former college boy sharing their table, Wright and Baldwin were gladiators by necessity, fighting, at Les Deux and in parlors around the Faubourg Saint Germain, to establish whose spear was long enough to pierce their largely white audience's consciousness, and anoint its wielder head literary Negro. (93) As we observe, the vanishing side of this would-be triangle is more cutting in the totality of its self-effacing, its disappearance more play fully and indeed, drunkenly, free in its withdrawal than is the hyper defensive aggression of either of the anxiously narcissistic combat ants. Which is only to say that in the absence of anything for which to compete against either Wright or Baldwin this particular evening, Himes dissolves into the unheard contouring of another articulation— into the soundless articulation of an altogether different mode of critical presence, belonging to a completely other set of critical im peratives. He abandons, or more precisely, is abandoned by what he imagines as a literary zone of social realist pathos, now demanding and regulating the aesthetic re-presentation of a black masculinity whose continual estrangement from any hope of self-possession would allegorize the entirety of twentieth-century black thought and expe rience in the United States. In his disengagement from the performative protocols of such conventionality, Himes opens a silent investigation into the deeper implications of Als's journalistic reduction of the encounter's stakes. But the theoretical space cleared by Himes's silence extends also into the darkly vast otherness of an ongoing history of abjections and abolishings, whose energies and afterlives cannot be managed or accounted for by reigning academic practices of historicism, and whose extradocumentary realities are only marginally available to any representational aesthetic logic of realism. The question at Les Deux Magots that evening, while clearly inflected with the kinds of</page><page sequence="5">850 Fugitivity and Futurity in the Work of Chester Himes careerist gamesmanship foregrounded in Als's snapshot has more to do with how to animate novelistically these ancient and future reali ties of black survival and black creativity. The question is compli cated in Himes's case by the fact that his literary project seeks to activate an aesthetical-political engagement of a de-legitimated and outcast sensibility, whose ineffable and ineradicable blackness is at once anterior to the logic of racialization, and at the same time, augmented, reshaped, and intensified exactly by those dimensions of lived experience unique to the scene of public fascination and public abjection (or exclusion from the zones of thought, value, and history) that is cultural blackness. Himes's critical tendency toward the necessarily highly reflec tive figurality of this discarded life and thought has something vital to do with what Theodor Adorno sees as "radical" in all "dark" art after 1945 : its reopening of an abyssal "speechlessness" that ac companies and critiques the banalities and horrors of everyday con sumerism, administered sameness of social and commercial forms, and, the nonstop atrocities on which such art obsessively ignites (.Aesthetic Theory 39, 40). It is an art whose blackness inheres in its open inability to console or to reconcile its auditor or spectator with such realities, produced and intensified as these realities are by the hyper-capitalism to which they are attendant, and by which its spec tators are compliantly conditioned. In Himes, however, this imma nent blackness moves beyond what might seem the strictly dialecti cal terrain of Adorno's model, and into the question of what Jean-Francois Lyotard later calls the impenetrable "space-time-mat ter" of language in the moment of working within literature (6). This question, as we will see, forms a great part of the basis of Himes's most incendiary work, and seriously complicates, if it does not ex plode, the customary critical logic by which his work is disposed of as strictly "oppositional." Such a logic presumes Himes's work to be yet only another sounding of the "cry of anguish" of social realism or naturalism that Robert Bone pronounced it to be in 1965.2 It is sug gested here that in both his detective fiction and his novelistic medi tations, Himes' work actually produces something much closer to the cry of the real that by necessity escapes every symbolic coding and classification, that breaks every contract of transparent mean ing or valuation and undoes every uninterrogated "law of the named" (de Certeau 149). Not attuned to the radical nonpositionality of this kind of figurai irruptivity, Als, throughout his New Yorker piece conflates author and literature. He continually collapses presumably explanatory nar ratives of class warfare, threatened masculinity, and, most predict ably, "black authenticity" into the journalistic conjuring of a one-man</page><page sequence="6">Bell 851 Negro Problem—the very ethos that Himes himself weaves and unweaves so athletically throughout each of his nondetective novels, and suggests so intensely in the detective works. It is the literary *//7weaving of this ethos in Himes's work that most of his commenta tors, like Als, leave almost entirely unattended, focusing instead upon what seems the "hardness" of the hard-boiled cadence that charac terizes the speech of many of his protagonists and the general style of his narratives themselves. What customarily eludes analysis is the equally palpable parallel track of Himes's style—an imperative of in cessant and fluid movement, the continually transformative upheaval of internal vision and thinking by which those same protagonists become more sharply defined in the first place. It is a fluidity within which what is hard is made to boil and dissolve, a technical principle of liquidity by which these characters' masculinist stances and pos tures are constantly exposed as nothing more than identificatory stops between situational and conceptual crises—which themselves turn out to be as foundational to the stylistic figuration of the novels as they are to the works' thematic premises. As Als claims: Himes produced male characters who really were noir— in fact and in sensibility. Unapologetic and testosterone-driven, they weren't hard-done-by; they were in love with having done wrong. Turned on by their own bravado, they claimed entitlement and viewed sex as a struggle for power—the only form of intimacy that engaged them. "Race was a handicap, sure . . . but hell, I didn't have to marry it," says Bob Jones, one of Himes's narrators, before describing how he has used his skin color for financial gain . . . Undoubtedly, Himes's detachment from the forces that shaped his fellow writers had much to do with his own social entitlement. Unlike Wright or Baldwin, he was a child of the middle class. Privilege doesn't always cushion you from the sting of the lash, but it can act as a balm. Still, Himes was in constant rebellion against his background. ... In a sense, Himes's entire oeuvre can be read as an attempt to prove how black he really was, and to authenticate, de facto, that abstraction. (90-91) Just now, it does not seem advantageous to send those stranger effects of Himes's writing into the conceptual lockdown of a merely strategic move of defense against such a psychologizing, even pathologizing account as Als has provided us, though, among other things, the totality of Als's misreading of the cited lines from If He Hollers may appear to demand exactly such a direct and immediate</page><page sequence="7">852 Fugitivity and Futurity in the Work of Chester Himes rejoinder. For what eludes Als is the radical hollowness at the center of each example of "hard-boiled" Himesian positivity he enumer ates; the acutely reflexive and ever-present absence of the kinds of self-certitude and self-consistency that such "testosterone-driven" "bravado" as that found in Himes's protagonists would depend upon for all psychic support. Such internal absence characterizes the very first image that Als presents—Himes's own silence before Wright and Baldwin at Les Deux Magots. Himes's quiet withdrawal from the triangle Als imagines is not an act of aggression or repudiation but is something far less voli tional. His concluding line, "they lost me," is in the lexicon of a cer tain incompetence. It testifies to a frank inability to participate in the exchange as an equal on the field of assertive positing and combat. However, its passivity registers not as a withered impotence but as an educated hesitancy to step into any line of argumentation that might validate primary presumptions of cultural "blackness" or the stasis of subject positionality or identity of any kind. His identifica tion is not with the professional "race-men" that Als all too blithely and reductively suggests Wright and Baldwin to be; nor is it with any flattened, commercial image of "the writer" by which Als can be said to frame the cafe exchange itself. The signature shifting speeds and intensities of Himes's writerly style, and its general organizational liquidity, all seem to channel Blanchot's channeling of Schlegel: "you can only become a writer, you can never be one; no sooner are you, than you are no longer, a writer" (61). Himesian becoming permanently disables and scatters the no tion of "Himesian" being, and is, for this reason, largely unavailable to instrumentalist or identitarian /ideological concerns of how black, how middle-class, or how rebellious he was or was not. Such typol ogy marginalizes the strangeness to which Himes is attuned, con verting the play of his poetics into the flat realism he molecularizes— and thereby reverses. It freezes the divergent energies, tensions, contradictions, colors, and tones that constitute thinking/writing life into a uniform set of narrative ordinances that would choreograph the scripted gestures of some such novelistic "black" subject in the American textual marketplace. Himes's reticence is thus only a with drawal from the assertive furor of transparency and certitude that is taken so frequently and unironically to mark his own highly reflexive writing. For Himes, I argue, the only reality of noir is its dissonant, discordant, always jarring sensibility. What Als puns as noir's social "fact"—the cultural imposition of anthropomorphic "blackness"—is for Himes only one more bizarre code inscribing the matrix of con structed social boundaries, identities, and binaries: top/bottom; in/</page><page sequence="8">Bell 853 out; black/white, that alienate thinking life from itself and constitute what Himes views as the absurd aspiration of locating one's place in American culture. In such work, the question of literature's time, space, and mat ter, or its figurai materiality, as heard and felt within its American twentieth century anyway, is always already cut by the urban sonori ties, colors, and movements that, in most of his American literary contemporaries, constitute little more than added flavorings, punc tuations and accents by which to augment an already-established, normative "white" interiority. That is to say, that for most of Himes's contemporaries, forms of vernacular blackness are reduced to modes of black affectivity that are depreciated into the mere instrumental ity of seasoning, distorted and imported for the purpose of stereo typic ridicule. What Himes realizes and reworks is the inexhaustible force of this figurality's darkness to itself: the aesthetic shock, to itself, of its very becoming, the ongoing event of its necessary re generation within the discarded districts of his Harlem, his South Central Los Angeles, his Cleveland, his Jersey City. This figurality's own time, space, and matter, its duration, movement, sound and color, is the surface expressivity of thinking's motion. It is a mem brane of expressivity as impenetrable as any other; indeed, more so, owing to the thick wall of mythology constructed around its mean ings. It is the criminally resistant idiom of an abjected and discarded urban blackness, defined primarily by its being subject to discourses of its utter /7o/rsubjectivity. While the gestures of such an idiomatic opacity work in part to subvert the "rational" arresting procedures of ideological machiner ies of comprehension and mastery, in Himes's fiction they also haul themselves in for routine questioning, exposing a reflexive inclina tion toward self-suspension and self-dissolution in his art that is fun damentally at odds with the conventions of the hard-boiled tradition within which his work is customarily flattened and slotted critically. The dark sensibility that informs the singularities of his work by 1953 is sharply differentiated from the by-then normative protest routes of resistance and advocacy made so pristinely and programmatically respectable and devoid of risk or even surprise, as to be nearly im potent by the midst of the civil rights movement (indeed, so predict ably respectable that in novels from If He Hollers Let Him Go [1945] and Lonely Crusade [1947] to the delirious satire Pinktoes [1961], Himes makes a concentrated point of holding what he views as the paralytic middleclass liberalism of the movement up to sustained ridicule, as only another hustle in an American matrix of endless con games). In other words, the silence that is the breaking of the triad at Les Deux Magots is only another moment of a critique immanent to</page><page sequence="9">854 Fugitivity arid Futurity in the Work of Chester Himes a wave of untimely and often unknown black artists that includes such figures as Himes and, before him, George Schuyler, as well as younger contemporaries such as Charles Wright, William M. Kelley, the filmmaker Melvin Van Peebles, and Ishmael Reed. Their work, in its radical obsession with the fullness of its own poetic effects and with the rupture of ideological continuum constituted by the very fact of such figurai obsession, shows the degree to which it is also calculated to expose the hollowness of the social equilibrium from which it issues. Disappearance, taking the affective form of reticence during the meeting at Les Deux Magots, is Himes's only logical response to cryptic chords sounded by Wright and Baldwin. Himes hears these chords as part of a pathetic and premodern song demanding the novelistic rehearsal and reprojecting of an essential black humanity and even nobility. The entire life project of such a humanity, as Himes hears it, would be to demonstrate the truth of its claims to the very structure of power and exclusivity that has made the performance of such a plea necessary. In a word, perhaps Himes's favorite, such a project is essentially absurd. That Himes's social nonengagement of this demand might blithely undermine a cultural metanarrative of American "blackness"—that his art undertakes to shatter, rather than to exploit—is theoretically consistent, if affectively incongruous, with the more overtly noisy and aggressive ruthlessness of his writerly aesthetic. As Himes writes in If He Hollers: The alarm went off again; I knew then that it had been the alarm that had awakened me. I groped for it blindly, shut it off; I kept my eyes shut tight. But I began feeling scared in spite of hiding from the day. It came along with con sciousness. It came into my head first, somewhere back of my closed eyes, cold and hollow. It seeped down my spine, into my arms, spread through my groin with an almost sexual torture, settled in my stomach like butterfly wings. For a moment I felt torn all loose inside, shriveled, paraly sed, as if after a while I'd have to get up and die. (2) Abandoned here is the calm self-mastery and effortless resourceful ness of the traditional hard-boiled hero, now collapsed into the invol untary shudders and spasms of a body at the mercy of the unconscious's submerged frequencies. Self-mastery is inverted, self estrangement is intensified as Bob Jones, protagonist of the first Himes novel, If He Hollers Let Him Go, begins to sense, long after the fact, that he is caught up in what Avital Ronell would call an "exploration of the limits of interiorizing violence" (93). What comes "along with consciouness" is the noxious return of ideological matter</page><page sequence="10">Bell 855 ingested from without. He finds his body to have been no more than a false boundary, powerless to exclude the toxins that so organize and paralyze his movements. He finds, with repeated surprise, that if ideology is indeed ingested like the air we breathe, the racialism that it plugs into is necessarily and incessantly breathed back out into the atmosphere in the next moment with the vengeance of an internally eviscerating virus, returned to the zone of its origin. Himes writes: It was the look in the white people's faces when I walked down the streets. It was that crazy, wild-eyed unleashed hatred that the first Jap bomb on Pearl Harbour let loose in a flood. All that tight, crazy feeling of race as thick in the street as gas fumes. Every time I stepped outside I saw a challenge I had to accept or ignore. Every day I had to make one decision a thousand times: Is it now? Is now the time?. . . I carried it as long as I could. I carried my muscle as high as my ears. But I couldn't keep on carrying it. I lost twenty pounds in two weeks and my hands got to trem bling. I was working at the yard then as a mechanic and every time my white leaderman started over toward me I drew up tight inside. I got so the only place I felt safe was in bed asleep. I was scared to tell anybody. If I'd gone to a psychia trist he'd have put me away. Living everyday scared, walled in, locked up. I didn't feel like fighting anymore. I'd take a second thought before I hit a paddy now. I was tired of keeping ready to die every minute ... (4) The detached perspective of the knowing hard-boiled hero is here broken up, folded into a scene that heretofore it would have de scribed and managed as if from a clear-eyed distance. Jones finds himself possessed within the field of social vision, his claustrophobic view limited only to the immediate scene of the affective movements before him, his thinking now organized not by the social premapping of any given situation, but strictly in terms of his internal responsive ness to the image of "the look," to the suffocating thickness of a crazy, wild-eyed feeling. The reality of this feeling is exposed in its total inability to articulate itself into anything as reassuringly direct as an actual "challenge"; its force is made more palpable and tyran nical by its failure to cohere itself into something like a position, by its utter difference from anything resembling a discourse. Negotiat ing this passage, like so many in Himes, means abandoning the pre</page><page sequence="11">856 Fugitivity and Futurity in the Work of Chester Himes sumptively given scene of "the racial" and radically re-thinking the contours of the social. For what we observe in Jones are the gradual movements of the opening of an internal vision—not as it reacts to the practical ordering of a situation within culture—as in the narra tive progressions of a workday or a trip to the grocery store—but as it reacts to the unfoldings of singularized images, sounds, move ments, and textures momentarily disconnected from the principles of "situation." In its dislocation from the narrative logic of situational continuity, the fluidity of Himesian scenography transmaterializes the defining lines of "identity," for we observe here that Jones's sense of a recognizable self-shape is sharply compromised by the fact of his hyper-responsiveness not to "selves" or to types, but to glances, blinks and stares, tonalities and cadences of voice, speeds and arcs of movement. Such fragmentary agents orbit around him as a con stellation of blindnesses and deafnesses, insensate and indifferent to any analytic of control or identity, forcing him into an excruciat ingly liberatory zone of what Nathaniel Mackey might term a "post expectant futurity." Within which the redemptive promise of "the human" and its hierarchies of rights and values are abandoned in the experimental practice of life continually exposed to the impossibility of finally determining its own meaning (50-51). What is required is the movement of life into the continual opening of such internal vi sion and hearing, unburdened from the weight or preemptive condi tioning of the baggage of former hope or expectation, of any specific circumstance, disposition, or ending. In this way we observe that Himes's thematizations of racialist American antagonisms function as conceptual vehicles by which not merely to de-scribe, but to deto nate and déstructuré as radically absurd the American ideological nexus of "race," consumerism, and anti-intellectualism that so com pletely warps his swarming cityscapes. It is in this sense that Himes's fiction and, perhaps most devastatingly, the series of detective nov els for which he is best known and most popular does more than eviscerate the "high/low" ideological dynamics that separate such writing from the proper novel. It also disrupts the troglodytic politi cal drives that prop up mythologies of racialism and also support humanist notions of canonicity, literary modernism, and even postmodernism that are formed nowhere near so rigorously as the unsparingly ironic writing that exposes their contradictions and ab sences. The sudden popular resurgence of the long-obscured Himes as the grand documentarian of all things "street"—whose customary invocation itself forms only another static substitution for actual en gagement of his writing—displaces with the frozenness of journalis tic image the aporetic fields of sonic and chromatic breakage and</page><page sequence="12">Bell 857 duration that are the real object of Himes's obsession. Each of these fields houses an intrinsic force that Himes maximizes in the motions, tones, and subtones of word and phrase. Each field is the locale for the kind of sensorial engagement that implicates Himes within the tropics of modernism and the surreal, and in exile from the flat real ism with which he is still customarily associated. His terrain is the figurai, which, as Lyotard reminds us, "is a denial of the position of discourse" (9). The plasticity of the figurai improvises and highlights difference, finding its home in paradox and confusion, playing in an aphasie state marginalized by orders of knowledge and imperatives of proper designation. Stumbling into a new mode of hearing and being during a mari juana stupor at the Blue Note in St. Germain Des Pres, one autumn night in 1961, he awakens to a revelation. "I suddenly realized my slang was ancient; I was inventing a language no one spoke any more. What makes my books popular was not that they were hip; they were popular because they were absurd" {My Life 241). Like Walter Benjamin on hash Himes realizes that language is not his to manipulate but that language "happens to him like an outward event" (Ronell 30; emphasis added); he finds himself within its grip and not the other way around. Like Benjamin also, he recognizes this private truth of "self" only through ingestion of something exterior and inhu man. Where he is lost during drinks at Les Deux Magots in 1953 and again at the Blue Note in 1961 is exactly at the boundary of the inhuman and the re-presentational. For by thinking not in dogma or advocacy, but in sound and texture, not in discourses but in discontinuities and intervals, not in positionality but in energies and speeds, he abandons every mapping of the reassuringly human, of the uncomplicatedly "black," and crosses into the poetic nonidenti cal. In this zone, he relinquishes the notion that the ongoing mutila tion of the American racialized can be converted either into an ideo logical referent or an object of aesthetic manipulation. Himes works within a more profoundly negative zone of art, in which the redemp tive tendency to try to equalize or protest the silencing of the abjected via the logic of re-presentation is trashed by the unpresentable real ity that haunts it. He realizes that to make the living history of that abjection the object of a cognition, a mere re-presentation by con cept is to once again callously "drown out the screams of its victims" (Adorno, Negative Dialectics 67). Himes's literature is concerned in stead to create worlds of movement, sound, texture, line and break age that interact directly with bodies, institutions, laws, and cul tures, amplifying the singularity of each, by addressing not its powers of instrumental language, but of affective furor, of each field's indi</page><page sequence="13">858 Fugitivity and Futurity in the Work of Chester Himes vidual idiom of pure expressivity, its abilities to convey meanings that operate in excess of language. It is work that emphasizes less the presumed content of a discourse than the inscriptive cuts that modes of thinking such as affect and idiom enact on discourse. The Open Secret ofTime Even in what he thought of as his serious novels, as opposed to the detective series he produced in Paris between 1957-69, Himesian authenticity unfolds not at the levels of the sociological, but always within the exquisitely temporal core of the affective; within his re fusal to arrogate to a function of identity or "race" thinking the apha sie and suspenseful compulsions of thought, desire, and question that identificatory habituation stops cold and that also cut art loose from any idea of its fixed comprehensibility. Unlike most writers oc cupying the genre spaces of naturalism or social realism, which allow the image of a more or less stoic subject to stand, racialized, sexual ized, gendered, flattened within the political grids of capitalistic modernity's classifications, the proliferation in Himes's work of dis junctive energies and intensities scatters the notion of a self-coher ent, unitary protagonist who judges and organizes from without an equally free-standing, external world of meaning. In Himes, thinking is something that calls the thinker from the outside, again, some thing that takes possession of him from a distance, transfiguring his being, splintering him from an organized unit of coherence and au tonomy into a highly volatilized swarm of disjointed affects, impres sions, sensations, memories and constructs. In other words for Himes, the social reality of reified, racialized life in the States is always al ready beyond surrealism; and the movement of thinking, like that of literature, or music, or the sermon, exposes our actual experience of the passage of time, presenting what Deleuze terms "the pane" through which time is split and "presents pass, replacing one by the next while towards the future, but also of preserving all the past dropping it into an obscure depth" (Cinema 87). In the following passage from Himes's 1938 short story "Pork Chop Paradise," the voice of the preacher performs the function of the interconnective pane: He rocked his congregations, he scared them, he startled them if by nothing else except his colossal ignorance, he browbeat them, he lulled them, he caressed them. He made hardened convicts want to shout, he made gambling ad dicts repent and give away their ill-gotten gains and stay away from the games for two or three whole days. He</page><page sequence="14">Bell 859 played upon people's emotions. His voice was like a throb bing tom-tom, creeping into a person's mind like an insidi ous drug, blasting the wits out of the witty, and filling the hearts of the witless with visions of everlasting beauty. It had an indescribable range, sliding through oc taves with the ease of a master organ. It was like a jour ney on a scenic railway, dropping from notes as clear and high as Satchmo ever hit on his golden trumpet, like the sudden startling dive of a pursuit plane, to the reverberat ing roar of heavy artillery. You could see hell, in all its lurid fury, following in its wake, and then, with as abrupt a change, the voice took you to green pastures lush with manna. {Short Fiction 261) This voice is the mechanism by which opening fuses itself to open ing; by which present disappears itself into a past now gone, dis placed by another present now present. The immobility that is the scene of listening is at the same time the scene of this visual pageant's procession—a procession itself borne by the ongoing movement and changing of the voice's sonority. It is a literary playing out of what Eleanor Kaufman describes, in a provocative discussion of time, im age, and posed immobility in Klossowski and Resnais, as "a solecism of time, in which past and present inflect one another with a contra dictory yet nonetheless sustainable tension." We observe that the friction, or resistance between the fixity of the listening ear and the nonending fluctuation of crescendo and diminuendo projecting from the voice produces a continual (re)opening of the abundant internal life of visual/sonic forms themselves; the experience of changing images and sounds, which is only the exchange of different pre sents, is not determined by the organizing narrative of de-scriptions by the speaker, but is motored entirely by the vocative intensity or force of his explorations in the dimension of sonority itself. Invited by Marcel Duhamel, editor of Gallimard's detective novel series, La Serie Noire to start working in this genre in 1956, Himes initially balks, uncomfortable with what he considers his ignorance of the noir novel's conventions. Duhamel appeals to him with an ocu lar/auralization of literature in which the emphasis is relocated from plot and discovery of meaning or value to the movement of cut and paste, from writing in pathos to thinking in images of a psycho visual and acoustic dream space of endless labyrinths and passages in which colors, energies, and textures appear and shift without warn ing—writerly effects that are made more forceful, ironically, by way of a certain immobility. Himes describes it thusly in his memoirs.</page><page sequence="15">860 Fugitivity and Futurity in the Work of Chester Himes "Get an idea," Marcel said. "Start with action, some body does something—a man reaches out a hand and opens a door, light shines in his eyes, a body lies on the floor, he turns, looks up and down the hall. . . . Always action in detail. Make pictures. Like motion pictures. Always the scenes are visible. No stream of consciousness at all. We don't give a damn who's thinking what—only what they're doing. Always doing something. From one scene to an other. Don't worry about it making sense. That's for the end. Give me 220 typed pages. . . . Keep the suspense going. Don't let your people talk too much. Use the dia logue for narration, like Hammett. Have your people use the description. You stay out of it." {My Life of Absurdity 102; emphasis added) The apparent refutation of thought argued by Duhamel, is in truth only the articulation of thought now unbinding itself from its pre sumptive obligation to the metaphysical //77&lt;?^e of thought. That dead image is replaced with an emphasis upon exteriority that necessi tates a new orientation toward time in which time is no longer that which connects, in the illusion of a linear unity, movements, ideas, and bodies, but is instead that which allows each of these to open up and unfold with power, independently of each other, according to the inner logic and intensity of each. His indifference is not at all to the motion of thinking, but only to the idea that this question is subordi nate to that of who does the thinking. What Deleuze says of Kleist can be thought equally productively of the Himes who produces worlds of such indifference, that in his work, "feelings become uprooted from the interiority of a subject to be projected violently outward into a milieu of pure exteriority that lends them an incredible veloc ity, a catapulting force: love or hate, they are no longer feelings but affects. . .. Even dreams are externalized, by a system of relays and plug-ins, extrinsic linkages" (A Thousand Plateaus 356). At work in Himes is a sensorial labor by which impression is reprojected not simply as expression but more like what Tom Cohen calls ex-scription, in which the inscriptive cut made upon us by the impressions we absorb from the outside creatively marks itself as the trigger of a now-transfigured thinking (17). The cut of the im pression that we attempt to narrate or re-present, necessarily reconfigures the mechanics by which we narrate, thereby guaran teeing the virtual and differential character of the former impression now rendered in another form. Here is an example of Himes enacting Duhamel's formation, in which the presumably descriptive actually opens up an alternative of speed as a way of seeing and thinking</page><page sequence="16">Bel! 861 matter; in which the value of an image seems to depends upon its relation to other images in the surface of the text and is therefore dependent upon the figuration of that text. By maximizing isolated faculties of description (darkness, speed, uncertainty) Himes forces the relinquishment of this habit of comparison, and makes available to us the invasion of nuance or timbre: The second shot creased the back of his neck, burned through his fury like a red-hot iron and lighted a fuse of panic in his enraged brain. He was in an awkward position, his left leg crossed over his right onto the stair below, left arm raised in reflexive defense, right arm groping forward, and his body doubled over in a downward slant like an acrobat beginning a twisting somersault. But his corded muscles moved as fast as a striking snake. His taut legs propelled him in a burst of power across the landing and his right side slammed into the wall, bruising him from shoulder to hip. Mother-raper! He cursed, gasping through gritted teeth and came of the wall turning, pushing with his right leg and right arm and right hip . . . moving so fast he was around the corner and out of range before Walker's third shot dug a hole in the white plaster wall where a fraction of an instant before, the shadow of his head had been. He went down the bottom stairs in a somersault. It was started and he couldn't stop it... so he took it, catch ing the third stair with the palms of both hands . . . Walker chased him, charged down the top stairs tee tering as though half blind. He missed the last stair before the landing, slammed sidewise into the wall and fell to his hands and knees. "Wait a minute, you black son of a bitch!" he screamed unthinkingly. Jimmy heard him and came up from his squatting position with a mighty push. The minds of both were sealed, each in its compel ling urge, one to kill and one to live, so that neither regis tered the humor in Walker calling to Jimmy to wait and get himself killed.{Run, Man, Run 31) The differential force of the scene's speed emerges by way of its interspersed stoppages, as the very thinking necessary to move ment articulates itself by way of a metaphorical vocabulary of action's necessary breaks. Metaphors of movement and intensity disguise the arresting, cessational function they actually perform; the "red</page><page sequence="17">862 Fugitivity and Futurity in the Work of Chester Himes hot iron" that underscores the speed of the bullet that creases Jimmy's neck is itself a rigid solidity possessed of an internal force that leaves the permanent mark of a singe, the "striking snake" that makes visible the danger, speed, and rage that only becomes threatening within the suspended, poised coil of his taut, ready musculature; it is at the same time, however, a solidity, a firm body that while capable of murderously rapid motion, is also there, available to be captured and struck itself by a movement faster than its own. It is the "sealed" quality of each man's thinking—its inflexible indifference to the den sity of any physical obstacle to the surging of their movements—an unusually, and powerfully enabling closure—that separates them hopelessly from any extra-physical dimension of abstraction, such as humor, honor, or justice. In another passage, from Yesterday Will Make You Cry, the customary freneticism of Himes's fiction is shifted from the fissured, entropie cityscape of Harlem tenements, canyons, and unlit streets to the claustrophobic interior of an American penitentiary in the 1930s. Within the immobility of the imprisoned consciousness giving spring to itself, the motion of the unannounced intervals between images articulates the facticity of thinking's weaving and unweaving of its own limits; which is only to say that what we observe in the passage is the conversion of matter's event into matter's reflection by way of an enforced fixity. This conversion provides the means of a certain transport out of lockdown's stasis (state lockdown) into the fluidity of what Deleuze calls "recollection-images," individuated, multiple images that that trigger within us the past in which they are pre served (Cinema 87). What emerges in the passage however, is not simply the life of the boundary at which past collides with the present of its reanimation—but what one sees/hears as an outward move ment borne by the very gesture of thinking's rush, and the dissolv ing or collapsing of each of its images into the next—a jumble of movements and shifts whose friction eventuates in the production of images that live, and are yet, unseen. This materiality of movement within the space of immobility is the historical writing of an utterance unable to assemble itself into a positive statement: Those were the days; the moving, living, endless days with legs that dragged but yet kept marching through the stone and steel and five-foot thicknesses of concrete walls. The days with bloody guts filled with the gory slime of degen eracy, enclosed with the gray stone blankness of walls, lashed with bars falling in steady monotonous blows—the bleeding, living, peopled days of convicts doing time . . . But there were the nights, which were not nights at all but were the moments alone when he escaped the days.</page><page sequence="18">Bell 863 The moments when no one was with him, neither the con victs nor the guards, nor the discipline nor the rooted, im movable prison. The nights of loneliness of which no one knew, which had no past, no future, no hope or perspective or founda tions in respectability or beliefs or faith or love or hate, but which were only the times immediately present with thoughts which grew out of nothing and conclusions which grew out of them . . . All of those confused and not very clear and not very old and too touching thoughts and emotions which grew out of those nights out of hackneyed, tear-squeezing sto ries, out of lying awake when he should have been asleep, or from an old tune in clear notes on some distant convict's mandolin—a sudden lilt of melody across a moment's mood like an eccentric artist's fingers upon the chords of chaotic groping, weaving into romantic confusion or violent rebel lion the new and jumbled and not very clear and too touch ing thoughts and emotions of those nights alone . . . And those thoughts, like angels' words, like the side walks trying to speak, like the mute prayers of the black scared night, weaving fantastic, unsleeping dreams into patterns of girls who were never born, and muted tones that were never played, and poems that were never writ ten; into tense emotional situations wherein he always acted in a brave and noble manner; into horses breaking the barrier at Saratoga while he leaned against the railing, ciga rette curling a nonchalant ribbon of smoke into the blue, sunny sky, with fifty thousand dollars on Red Rosebud . . . Only in his thoughts. The lovely stimulating bitter sweet sensations—so utterly unreal. Like something from another world. And the next day, ashamed of them. Ashamed as if they were the clap or syphilis or cancer. (225-228) Memory's motion, as it slams against the thick concrete walls and lashing bars of the present, links imprisoned thought to the exterior surfaces and shapes of images and sounds that themselves live, embodying an unchecked freedom whose evidence is shown by their very disconnectedness to each other in (their) time and teleology— but not in space—the concretely rigidified space within which they collide without end. This is the scene of radical freedom heard in Mackey's remarkable distillation of the experimental/improvisational in his phrasing of a somehow "post-expectant" (50) futurity, in which</page><page sequence="19">864 Fugitivity and Futurity in the Work of Chester Himes the imagining of an elsewhere of unborn girls, speaking sidewalks, unwritten poems and unperformed music finds the reality of these sounds and their contours, unbound from any purposiveness beyond their own expressivity or articulation. It is a freedom whose first emancipation is from the very hope of its foundation within language or culture. Himes meditates upon the abyss of radical isolation in which thinking becomes thinking. The space of nothingness is by necessity one of contingency and purest experimentality in that noth ing is returned to its occupant, no correction, no validation, no rec ognition, no refutation, no discourse of legitimation or even rejec tion. The materiality of its psychic and linguistic fabric is forced into an obsession with finding and moving beyond its own limits, its bound aries discovering and rediscovering themselves only in the exercise of their own gestures. Such writing crumples the censoring schémas of genre that would divide surrealism from hyperrealism, modern from postmodern, dismissing the despotic tendencies of those laws of canonicity and racialism that would neutralize into tone-deaf positionalities of either affirmation or repudiation the bodily shudders of horror and guttural cracks of laughter provoked by the laconic athleticism of Himes's expression. Hardly any plunge into a violently nihilistic pool of rela tivism, Himes's novels are rather an improvisational rethinking of time and event that in their irreverent defusing of the definitional and in their cinematic poetics of discontinuity, expose and eviscerate the American culture industry that produces "race," "gender," and other categories of cultural identity solely in order to exploit them. In so doing, his work unfolds a strange and darkly impressionistic language in which those closely related dimensions of abjection, the niggered, the noncanonical, and the non-identical can converse openly, demanding an absolutely irreducible form that makes no pretense of strict re-presentationality. This work foregrounds the figurai materi ality of language in which its accidental, unmotivated timbre or nu ance touches that telic, ideologically programmed dimension, a meet ing in which the ongoing mutual inscription of these two dimensions clamors for recognition as an event in itself. What Is Left Baldwin's informal notion of there being nothing left to intro duce or to explore for black writing after Native Son automatically implies its opposite, namely, that there exists a something to be left out. In this way he unintentionally announces his subscription to an analytic of propriety and exclusivity that he attacks and dismantles elsewhere throughout his life and career. As he and Wright skirmish</page><page sequence="20">Bell 865 on the ideological question of "what is left" for black writing after Native Son, Himes checks out, witness once again to the fact that his peculiar field of writerly interest—American absurdity—has just now proven itself as fertile as ever. The very articulation of the "nothing left" is enabled by its belonging a strictly identitarian principle regu lating a constellation of issues and pressures unique and proper to "the" project of African-American writing. The negatively charged remainder that is everything outside that constellation, or whatever might be "left" in the aftermath of the absolute truth apparently delivered/captured by Native Son, is, for Baldwin (at least in this youthful, tense, challenged instance) a marker of impoverishment. But for Himes, the very enunciation of this "nothing left" functions as the commencement of an outward excursion. "What is left" has ev erything to do with how to play the membrane dividing and connect ing what Himes hears as excess and what Baldwin hears as scarcity in the literary imagining of African American subjectivity in the 1940s and 1950s. The vicious procedure by which the spectral figure of "black ness" is forced to internalize the rhetoric of otherness that literalizes its subjective distance from its "white" double, unfolds somewhat more subtly but no less fatally in The End of a Primitiveren in If He Hollers. Himes again plays upon the white egoism that creates the phantasmagorical myth of the bestial black Other who is materially conditioned to eventually become exactly the nightmare that race ideology has always already ordained him to be. The protagonist, Jesse Robinson, is acutely aware (and more cynically so than Bob Jones before him) of the transformation and denuding of his chaotic "inside" of possibility, at the hands of an ideologically constricted and racialist "outside." The terms by which Jesse attempts repeatedly to assert his completeness as a writer and intellectual in racialist culture, are not distant from those by which the novel must assert itself formally and aesthetically. It stands not only against its immediate precursors in African American literature such as Ellison's Invisible Man (1952) and Wright's The Outsider (1953), but also against the grand narra tive of literary history itself, as Robinson's habits of quotation and reference from Rabelais to Gorki to Proust represent the tapestry of narratives into which Himes belatedly weaves himself. Jesse's Man hattan is interpretable only in its self-stratification into ontological categories of its own construction. It is a product of presumably stable determinations and oppositions such as black and white, high and low, masculine and feminine, that create for it a readily acces sible catalogue of rubrics by which to illusorily define and compre hend itself. In this sense Himes's work addresses a central problem</page><page sequence="21">866 Fugitivity and Futurity in the Work of Chester Himes atic of literary modernism, this being that the imperative of identity itself assumes the character of law. The narratives of textual code and sign that the characters must assemble if they are to decipher culture are the same by which they are to assemble themselves into discrete beings. Wresting himself from the last in a series of nightmares structured by the thematic constant of his complete social invisibility, Jesse takes lonely survey of his Harlem rented room. He blearily recomposes himself amidst the accumulation of temporal waste that metaphorically underscores his simultaneous superfluousness and fragmentation: dirty ashtray, half-emptied package of cigarettes, half-eaten candy bar, half-emp tied milk carton, an alarm clock with a cracked crystal face. Then his eyes meet an ancient mahogany cabinet situated in a corner: "Inside the cabinet, behind the closed doors, were his stacks of unpublished manuscripts, carbon copies, old papers and letters which he always kept nearby, carting them from place to place, hanging on to them year after year, to remind himself that—no matter what he did for a living—he was a writer by profession" (,Primitive 36). The only av enue into self-actualization for Jesse is textuality, as he has literally written himself into personal subjectivity, staging a rhetorical iden tity by which to insert himself into the grand narrative of abstracted humanity. Summoning himself into a suddenly coherent self by means of discarded, rejected writing, Jesse inscribes the supposedly sec ondary function of writing as something else, something generative that doesn't merely document his difference, but produces it. Himes narrates this function not only as a necessary precondition of the writer but of subjectivity itself. This is not merely to undermine any presumed dichotomy between subject and object, but to demon strate that anxiety and uncertainty compel the tissues of social nar rative and signification that function above all as strategies of reso lution, in the forms of codes, traditions and identities by which culture defines itself to itself. The cost of such an existence for Jesse is the near absolute indifference of a postliterate culture, or what he terms "all the pro cessed American idiocy" (21). To comfortably situate himself at a remove from the culture of television and waste he so caustically dismisses, he must ignore his own participation within it, discounting the psychedelic possibilities at his immediate disposal in favor of the "higher" responsibilities of a serious writer: He was still too drunk for a hangover but his head felt unset and his body unjointed and everything had a double edged, distorted look like a four-color advertisement with each color slightly out of line.</page><page sequence="22">Bell 867 However his brain was sharp. For the past five years it had never let him down. It was packed with some defi nite emotion, defined in intellectual terms; futile rages, tearing frustrations, moods of black despair, fits of suicidal depressions—all in terms of cause and effect, of racial im pact, and "sociological import"—intellectual horseshit—but nagging as an unsolved problem, slugging it out in his mind, like desperate warriors . . . whatever he did to deaden his thoughts, there was this part of his mind that never be came numb, never relaxed. It was always tense, hyper sensitive, uncertain, probing—there must be some goddamned reason for this, forthat. (33) The deadpan absurdity of the second paragraph's reversal of the first nearly renders the scene comic. Jesse's logo-logical anxiety even penetrates and undercuts the inebriation by which he presumably attempts to obliterate it. But what is actually negated by the admit tedly "desperate war" of telos, of "meaningfulness," and the primacy of fixed literary and intellectual conventions, even as they are recog nized as the cheapest clichés, is the possibility of self-discovery or invention via actual experience represented here albeit crudely, by the state of drunkenness. Abandonment to radical ambiguity, to the aporetic wonder of "four color," "double-edged" distortion is finally forsaken in the name of "definite emotion" rendered in "intellectual terms," that can access nothing but a heavily commodified, popu larly manufactured and conventional representation of blackness, a politically soberized version of black exotica.This commodity is be reft even of the charm of kitsch, for unlike kitsch, this kind of cultural reification takes itself dead seriously. The shattering racism that dic tates the vicious reduction of life to what Jesse views as such one dimensional "intellectual horseshit" is only made possible by an ab solute negation of irony and "tense, hypersensitive" uncertainty, all of which might undermine the "'sociological import1" of good protest writing. This genre, true to Himesian fatalism, goes out of style while Robinson is in midcareer—and its demise might seem to create an opening in which he might forge a finer art. But no such opportunity exists; one clichéd fad must be replaced upon its death with an other: Pope laughed. "You're a hell of a good writer Jesse. Why don't you write a black success novel? An inspirational story? The public is tired of the plight of the poor downtrodden Negro." "I don't have that much imagination." "How about yourself? You're certainly a success story.</page><page sequence="23">868 Fugitivity and Futurity in the Work of Chester Himes You've published twelve novels that were very well re ceived." "That's what I mean." "I don't understand you." "Damn right you don't," Jesse thought. He didn't care to remind Pope that a moment or so back he'd termed the rejected novel as autobiographical. (124) Himes's wicked burlesque directed at the racialist banality of Ameri can publishing and indeed, at the numerous authors who produce such writing, reaches its most penetrating as he permits Jesse to perceive the stupidity of his professional conditions, but also forces him to internalize and accept them. The customary impressionism by which Jesse is able to decipher at the level of the social is brutally repressed at the level of the professional. Sacrificed in his careerist capitulation is the recalcitrant inclination to intertextual distortion and ironic revision that so marks his personality elsewhere. The dif ferential character of his analysis, burdened and burnished as it is by material and political concern, is outlawed by the conventions of a literary market that cannot allow the miscegenation of "black" writ ing and modernist, impressionistic sensibility. From where he stood at the corner of Eighth Avenue—a pesthole of petty thugs where a man could buy a gun, hot or cold, for fifteen dollars up—down to the tricornered, old stone Times building in the narrow angle were Broadway crossed Seventh Avenue, was a block of infinite change. Once in the lives of very old men it had been a mudhole; then had come an era of fashion, of furred and diamonded women with their potbellied escorts alighting from lacquered carriages beneath the glittering marquees of plush mod ern playhouses. Now it was descending into a mudhole again, but of a different kind. The once famous playhouses, lumped together on both sides of the street, were now crummy second- and-third-run movie theaters, contesting with the cheap appeal of a penny arcade with its shooting galleries, mechanical games, flea circus, thimble arena where Jack Johnson had done a daily stint of boxing in his waning years. And in between there were the numerous jewelry stores with fake auctions every night, beer joints, cafeterias, sporting goods stores .. . book stores that dealt principally in pornography, second-class hotels and filthy rooming houses. "Poor man's Broadway," Jesse thought sourly, as his searching gaze flitted from the lighted movie signs to the</page><page sequence="24">Bell 869 passing faces: then his mind began improving on the com monplace phrase, "Melting pot . . . already melted—rust ing now . .. last chance ... I can get it for you hot—hotter than you think, bud . . . this side of paradise—way this side." (61) Jesse fades into the loose narrative of images that he imposes on the urban landscape, finally disappearing behind the Fitzgerald refer ence that maintains its status as forbear only momentarily before it is corrupted by the street suggestion of the leering coda, "way this side." Rather than a mournful elegy to the block's bygone "era of fashion," the passage elucidates Jesse's vision of the inevitability of temporality's rush, of "infinite change," and of the perpetual impro visation made necessary by ongoing impoverishment. Even the de serted past is rendered in imagery of fleeting light and transient beauty, of "diamonded women" passing in "lacquered carriages be neath glittering marquees." The evident waste of the now "crummy" movie houses, "lumped together" into an undifferentiated mass still presents the opportunity of Otherness suggested by the "way this side" of paradise, clearly a "cheap appeal," but still an open invita tion into an infinite, anarchic zone of differentially rather than into a self-evident, solid "state" of ruin. Himes's identification for the articulation of temporalized sensi bilities in writers from Proust to Joyce translates into a precondition for the narrative structure of Primitive, in which the language of the interior is identical to that of the social, and in which the horrors of urban reality are staged in the unconscious. The End of a Primitives not so much a naturalistic expression of the futility of relationships "interracial" or otherwise as it is an ironic catalogue of the signifying procedures that expose the oxymoronic status of positive terms like "interracial," that firstly presume a proper "racial" category to be engaged. In the figure of a "white woman" who is devalued and shunned by "her own," because she indulges in sex with "black men;" and in the figure of a literary "black man," who privileges his own eccentricity above any collective implication or allegiance, Himes addresses a more comprehensive problem in modernism itself. This problem is the dismantling of the antagonisms of purity and con tamination, home and homelessness, origin and absence that con tinually reproduce themselves as idealizations or abominations and that atrophy into social law. What enraptures Jesse as he stands on the corner are writerly revisualizations, by which to rediscover the animation of the images that swarm around him without freezing them into the stasis of defi nition. These gestures, contradictory, unstable, dispersive, consti</page><page sequence="25">870 Fugitivity and Futurity in the Work of Chester Himes tute the pure point of affect at which articulation itself is revealed as the tissue that substantiates the notion of a self, the point at which expressivity alone materializes the body of thinking. It is a space that in other words, is hopelessly divorced from every discursive principle by which it would organize itself into a re-cognizable positionality. Its occupant's thinking can only determine itself against the nothingness of its boundaries, can only measure itself against the absence of its return or response from without. For Himes, the square cell of imprisonment in Yesterday and the Harlem corner of Primitive are exactly analogous to the philosophical zone of experi ential/experimental freedom suggested in Paris by Duhamel and worked out exhaustively in each of the seventeen novels he pro duced. It is a freedom, following thinkers from Nathaniel Mackey to Jean-Luc Nancy, that is not addressed by any logic of rights or even knowability, but more by a post-Idealist/postexpectant conception of freedom, which abandons every notion of denotation, every claim of truth and propriety, finding itself only in constant confrontation with its utter inability to stabilize the foundations of a solid state calling itself an "I." It is the freedom of writing and of speech, to split from itself and propel itself toward its outside, in the very instant that its sounding opens it to itself forever. Notes 1. Lawrence P. Jackson, who has authored the first serious biographical study of Ralph Ellison, describes lucidly another transgression of the one-vision-at-a time rules of engagement that all but completely dominate black literature in the immediate postwar period. Jackson exposes not merely the deeper implication of a nearly fatal myopia in the imagination of African American life and thinking on the part of our culture industry, resulting in the calcification of an aestheti cally narrowed canon; more importantly, he throws light on pivotal moments of philosophical and artistic becoming, or discoveries and intensifications of creative vision—divergent and even mutually hos tile though these may have been—in the writing lives of Ellison and Himes. While not especially concerned with issues of Himes's stylis tic endeavors, and indeed appearing to hurl Himes back into the pre modernist schema that my essay attempts to complicate, Jackson is one of remarkably few serious critics to note the historical signifi cance of Himes's novels in the thematic expansion of African Ameri can writing. 2. Such an approach finds its most perfectly crystallized expression in Bone. He includes Himes's work in what he designates as the "Wright School" of African American writing, a naturalistic arc in which</page><page sequence="26">Bell 871 literature is an emotional catharsis—a means of dispelling the inner tensions of race. Their novels often amount to a pro longed cry of anguish and despair. Too close to their material, feeling it too intensely, these novelists lack a sense of form and of thematic line. With rare exceptions, their style consists of a brutal realism, devoid of any love, or even respect, for words. Their characterization is essentially sociological. . . . The white audience, on perceiving its responsibility for the plight of the protagonist, is expected to alter its attitude to ward race. (157) While most contemporary Himes criticism pushes recognition of the work's tonal dimension beyond Bone's rigidities, Michael Denning is among the very few who appear to see in Himes's figurativeness at least the possibility of a radical literary politics. Restricting his analy sis to the detective series, he concludes by writing of one of its later installments, Blind Man with a Pistol, that "Here the original comic absurdity is joined to his social vision, and the detective genre is twisted to a postmodernist experimentation that makes this a just contemporary of Ishmael Reed. Here nothing is solved ... the Harlem of his topography assaults the imaginary Harlems of white America" (DenninglO-18). Works Cited Adorno, Theodor W. Aesthetic Theory. Trans. Robert Hullot-Kentor.
