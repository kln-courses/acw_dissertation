<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Islamic Studies 6:1 (1995) pp.51â€”75 THE ETHICAL PHILOSOPHY OF AL-RAGHIB AL-ISFAHANl1 YASIEN MOHAMED University of the Western Cape, Bellville Majid Fakhry classifies the ethics of al-Raghib al-Isfahanl as 'religious ethics' rather than 'philosophical ethics' as he considers it to be more firmly rooted in the Qur'an and the traditions.2 In describing Raghib's ethical theory, however, Abul Quasem states: 'This theory is an amalgam of philosophic ethics, Islamic religious teachings and a few Sufi ideas; the first element seems to be dominant in it.'3 This latter view concurs more with BayhaqT who stated that Raghib was 'among the philosophers of Islam who combined Law {Sharfa) with wisdom (.hikma), and who was mainly concerned with the intellectual sciences'.4 Madelung, however, points out that Raghib had some sympathy for philosophy which he combined with religious revelation, but that he was more of an adtb, concerned with aesthetic formulations through suitable quotations from prose and poetry.5 Al-Raghib is known in the Muslim world mainly through his unique Qur'anic lexicon, Mufradat Alfaz al-Qur'an. However, he is unknown in the Western world. All that is available in English is a chapter by Majid Fakhry, which gives only a brief description of some of the contents of al-Raghib's ethical treatise, al-Dharfa ila Makarim 1 The suggestion for this study came from Professor Hans Daiber who felt that research on al-Raghib's ethical treatise, al-Dbarf a ila Makarim al-Sharfa, would fill an important gap in the field of Islamic philosophical ethics. 2 Majid Fakhry, Ethical Theories in Islam, 151. 3 Abul Quasem, The Ethics of al-GhazzalT, 42. 4 Zahir al-DIn al-Bayhaql, Ta'rTkh Hukama' al-Islam, 23. 5 Wilferd Madelung, 'Ar-Raghib al-Isfahanl und die Ethik al-Ghazali' in lslamwissenschaftliche Abhandlungen, ed.

Before this, and probably the earliest writing in English, was a work by Abul Quasem. The author, in his study of al-Ghazall's ethics, points to the textual similarity between lhya' 'Uliim al-DTn and al-Dhan a. However, he states that Ghazali casts his ethics into more religious and mystical forms. Furthermore, in combining the good elements in philosophical works with the SharTa al-GhazalT has relied upon al-Dbarf a.6 There is a growing interest in Raghib as is evidenced by recent editions of his works.7 We now have a sufficient basis for a closer analysis of his thought. This would be a worthwhile effort because of the apparent importance of Raghib as a source for Ghazali's ethics, and also because of his unique combination of Greek ethics and Qur'anic theology in his Dharfa. An investigation of parallel sources of the Dharfa would enable us to draw conclusions regarding the impact of Miskawayh and other ethical writers on al-Raghib, and also the impact of Raghib on others, particularly Ghazali. As a starting point for such an investigation we have completed the translation of al-Dharfa ila Makdrim al-SharTa.s We hope that it will facilitate and initiate a critical evaluation of Raghib's contribution to Islamic philosophical ethics. AL-RAGHIB: HIS LIFE AND WORKS It is surprising, considering the scholarly stature of al-Raghib al-IsfahanT, that so little is known about his life. Biographical works refer to him as: Abu 1-Qasim al-Husayn b. Muhammad b. al-Mufaddal al-Raghib al-Isfahanl, but al-Suyutl calls him al-Mufaddal b. Muhammad al-Isbahanl al-Raghib.9 According to 'AjamT, he lived during the second half of the fifth/eleventh century between Isfahan and Baghdad;10 but according to Madelung, he did not live beyond the 6 Abul Quasem, op. cit. 42. 7 The following works by Raghib have been edited recently: Mufradat Alfaz al-Qur'an (1972), Kitab al-Dharta ila Makarim al-Sharfa (1985, 1987), Kitab Tafstl al-Nash'atayn wa-Tahsil al-Sa'adatayn (1988), and Kitab ft I Vtiqadat (1988). 8 This English translation, to be published elsewhere, is the first into a Western language. We have chosen to translate part I because the philosophical and religious basis of Raghib's ethical theory is articulated therein. The rest of the book is an elaboration of the first part and contains mainly definitions of ethical terms. The translation of part I (the largest part in the book) is intended to serve as a basis for a critical introduction and commentary, examining its sources and its impact. 9 al-Raghib al-Isfahanl, al-Dharfa, ed. 'AjamT (as cited by 'AjamT in his introduction to al-Dharfa, 19). 10 Ibid. 19. 'AjamI refers to Zahlr al-DIn al-Bayhaql's Ta'rTkh Hukuma' al-lslam, stating that Raghib was born in 499/1105 and died in 565/1169 (p.19). However, BayhaqT provides no date.

One source states that he died in Baghdad and another that he was martyred in Spain.13 This lack of information inhibits biographical and historical analysis. The best starting point to arrive at some historical perspective, therefore, is an analysis of his written works. The use of Raghib's al-Dharfa by al-GhazalT, as we shall demonstrate later, points to an earlier date of death than popularly cited. If Ghazall died in 505/1111, then the date assumed by Madelung, the middle of the fifth century, is more realistic. GhazalT's dependence on Raghib has been acknowledged by a few scholars, but they all without fail assume the date 502/1108 as being the date for Raghib's death. Another argument for the earlier date is the deep impression Miskawayh (421/1030) made on Raghib, coming from the same town of Isfahan. Raghib was learned in Qur'an, Haditb, language, poetry, literature, ethics, wisdom (bikma), and the sciences of his predecessors, such as Greek philosophy. As a religious scholar, he was widely accepted by the masses as well as the elite and belonged to the Shafi'T school of Islamic legal thought. He is often compared with the illustrious al-GhazalT, who used to take al-Dharf a along with him on his travels. BaydawT's well-known commentary of the Qur'an depended on Raghib's Mufradat Alfaz al-Qur'an.14 It is said that Raghib was not connected to any official position or political party, and this is perhaps why historians have neglected him.15 Al-Raghib's existing works are: al-Dbarfa ila Makarim al-Sbart'a, Mufradat Alfaz al-Qur'an, Tafsil al-Nash'atayn wa-TahsTl al-Sa'adatayn, Kitab al-l'tiqadat, Mubadarat al-Udaba', Muqaddimat al-TafsTr.16 His lost works are: al-Akblaq, al-lman wa-Kufr, Tabqtq al-Bayan ft Ta'wtl al-Qur'an, Afanin al-Balagba, Kitab Mutashabihat al-Qur'an, Kitab Kalimat al-Sababa.17 See also Max Meyerhof, "Ali al-Bayhaql's Tatimmat Siivan al-Hikmah', 168. The recent editors of Raghib's works all give the date of 502/1108. Most modern biographies give the same date. The Berlin manuscript also has this date attached to it (cf. Madelung, op. cit. 156).

The TabqTq al-Bayan is</page><page sequence="4">54 YASIEN MOHAMED With so much uncertainty about Raghib's life, it is difficult to establish the precise chronological dates of his works. Raghib states in his introduction to DharVa 'In my dictated book, TakqTq al-Bayan ft Ta'wTl al-Qur'an, I have already referred to the difference between the rules of Law (ahkam al-shar? a) and its noble qualities (makarim).'ls Thus, we know for certain that TabqTq al-Bayan preceded al-Dhar? a. This is probably why Raghib did not discuss the rules of Law in his ethical treatise, al-Dhari'a. Thus the TabqTq was assumed in his exposition of ethics as contained in the Dbart'a. In his introduction to Alfaz Mufradat al-Qur'an Raghib refers to al-Dhar?a which means that al\x=req-\ DbarT*a preceded the Mufradat. It is most likely that the one book followed the other in immediate succession. That is, TabqTq al-Bayan was followed by al-Dharf a which in turn was followed by Mufradat al-Qur'an. These three works form a trilogy in that they are all Qur'an\x=req-\ based. The DharT'a comes between the Qur'an commentary and the Qur'anic lexicon, and is an attempt to integrate philosophical ethics into a Qur'anic world view which is evident from the numerous verses of the Qur'an woven into his ethical treatise.19 It is to be expected that when the same Qur'anic terminologies are found in both the Mufradat and the Dharfa their explanations should correspond. The Mufradat should therefore serve as a source for elucidating the Qur'anic ethical concepts in the former. The author of Kasbf al-Zunun states that the D bar fa is considered to be an introduction to TafsTl al-Nasb'atayn wa-TahsTl al-Sa'adatayn.20 This is doubtful because the former is more elaborate than the latter. RAGHIB AND ISLAMIC ETHICS Islamic philosophy is a creative assimilation of Greek thought by open\x=req-\ minded representatives of the Islamic tradition. In the field of ethical philosophy Miskawayh was the first to attempt such a creative synthesis as reflected in his TabdhTb al-Akblaq. In his attempt to Islamize Greek ethics he has reinterpreted Islamic ideals in terms of their ethical philosophy. Although he is the principal philosophical writer on ethics in Islam, Islamic ethical writers such as al-Muhasibl (d.245/859), al-Baghdadl (d.298/910), al-Tirmidhl (d.285/898), and al-Kharaz essentially a work of tafsTr which according to Baydawl is available in the form of a manuscript in the Aya Sofya library (al-Nahl, op. cit. 14). 18 Ibid. 58. This is the first page of the Dbari'a text. 19 There are about 400 verses from the Qur'an in the Dbari'a. See 'Ajaml's index, 427-63. 20 Ibid. 32.</page><page sequence="5">THE ETHICAL PHILOSOPHY OF AL-RAGHIB AL-ISFAHANI 55 (d.286/899) preceded him.21 Constantine Zurayk cites the influence of this work on Muslim ethical writers such as Nasir al-DIn al-TusI (d.672/1273), Jalal al-DIn al-Dawwanl (d.908/1502), and Abu Hamid al-Ghazall (d.505/1111), but unfortunately makes no mention of Raghib al-Isfahanl, or of the impact of Miskawayh's Tahdhib on the Dharfa. As in Miskawayh's TahdhTb al-Akhlaq,22 Raghib begins his Dbarfa with an Aristotelian-Platonic anthropology. In the tripartition of the soul three faculties are identifiable: the rational, the concupiscent (appetitive), and the irascible (indignant).23 Although Raghib uses the same division of the soul, he does not follow Miskawayh's terminology. Miskawayh uses the term natiqa for the rational faculty, while Raghib uses fikriyya; Miskawayh uses gbadabiyya for the irascible faculty, and Raghib uses hamiyya.24 Interestingly, the irascible faculty has a more positive function when compared with the appetitive faculty in the psychological thought of Miskawayh, Raghib, and Aristotle. According to Miskawayh, although the irascible faculty lacks morality, it has the capacity to acquire it. This is not the case with the appetitive faculty (or the beastly soul).25 The irascible is required to subdue the beastly soul.26 According to Raghib, when the irascible has mastery over the appetitive, the soul is rightly disposed: 'In the same manner, when the soul seeks the aid of the intellect in regulating, and the faculty of indignation (hamiyya) is disciplined, having been given mastery over the faculty of appetite (shahwa) and its powers, it (the soul) becomes disposed to the right state, but if not it becomes corrupted.'27 Aristotle, too, expresses the higher function of the irascible over the appetitive: Passion (irascible) seems to listen to reason to some extent, but to mishear it, as do hasty servants who run out before they have heard the whole of what 21 Fakhry, op. cit. 4. For Aristotle as a source for Miskawayh's ethics, see Aristotle, Kitab al-Akhlaq (ed. Abdurrahman Badawl), 27-31. 22 Cf. Miskawayh, Tahdhib al-Akhlaq, 15; and Zurayk, The Refinement of Character, 16. 23 Raghib, al-Dharta, 100. Cf. Miskawayh, 10b; lhya', I, p. 9, li. 23-30. 24 Miskawayh, op. cit. 10b; Raghib, op. cit. 100. For Miskawayh, natiqa is also called malakiyya, al-shahwiyya is bahimiyya, and al-ghadabiyya is associated with al-sab'iyya, cf. Tahdhib, 10a. As a matter of interest, for later comparison, al-GhazalT, in his Kimiya' al-Sa'ada, 130, uses quwivat al-'ilm for the rational faculty; and although he does not use al-hamiyya for the irascible, he implies it when he states that the lack of his faculty leads to the loss of hamiyya (131). 25 Zurayk, op. cit. 52; cf. Tahdhib, 33. 26 Ibid. 54, li. 1 ff. al-DbarTa, 101, li.9-11. Cf. Jonathan Barnes (ed.), The Complete Works of Aristotle, p. 1149a 26ff.; and cf. Badawl (ed.), Kitab al-Akhlaq, p. 1149 a,b. In the latter work the translator, Ishaq ibn Hunayn, uses the term ghadabiyya for the irascible, and fikriyya for the rational faculty (p. 1149 a,b).</page><page sequence="6">56 YASIEN MOHAMED one says and then mistake the order, or as dogs bark if there is but a knock at the door, before looking to see if it is a friend, so passion on account of the warmth and hastiness of its temper, no sooner hearsâ€”even though it has not heard an orderâ€”-than springs to take revenge. For reason or imagination informs us that we have been slighted, and passion, reasoning as it were that anything like this might be fought against, boils up straight away; while appetite, if reason or perception merely says that an object is pleasant, springs to the enjoyment of it. Therefore passion follows reason in a sense, but appetite does not.28 Both Miskawayh and Hunayn ibn Ishaq use the term ghadabiyya for the irascible faculty. Raghib, however, uses the term hamiyya for the same. Whereas ghadabiyya simply connotes anger, hamiyya expresses the higher function of anger, as suggested by the above quotation.29 It seems to me that Raghib's usage of the term hamiyya is not only an original contribution, but also connotes action expressing a more accurate understanding of the faculty of indignation. The irascible (indignant) has a positive function because it is pliable and receptive to the guidance from the intellect {'aql), and the intellect cannot subdue the appetitive faculty without its aid. Furthermore, the faculty of indignation, as it is defined, does not simply express negative anger, but is also associated with courage directed at a purposeful goal.30 For Miskawayh, al-nafs al-ghadabiyya (spirited/ indignant soul) means the faculty of the psyche which expresses itself 'in anger, displays of vigour and energy in pursuits, ventures in dangers, and strives for domination, promotion and varieties of honour'.31 According to Lane's lexicon, hamiyya connotes anger and indignation, and it serves to protect what is sacred and inviolable. Furthermore, by indignation is meant a sense of purposeful anger, a force which turns against wrong and injustice. Hamiyya (indignation) is also closer to its 28 Jonathan Barnes, The Complete Works of Aristotle, II, p. 1149a. Cf. M. F. Burnyeat, 'Aristotle on Learning to be Good' in Essays on Aristotle's Ethics, 84. See also BadawT, op. cit. 1149b. 29 The above quotation of Aristotle contains a description which echoes Plato. It implies a kind of reasoning: 'injustices must be fought against, and since I have been wronged, I should take revenge.' As in Plato, the zealous dog in us is concerned with what is noble and just, with honour and self-esteem, without thinking of broader consequences of action. Cf. Burnyeat, op. cit. 84. If this is what is implied by the irascible faculty (ghadabiyya/hamiyya), then translations such as passion, spirit, irascible, and anger are all unsuitable. We prefer to use the word 'indignation' because it conveys more accurately what is implied: 'indignation implies depth and intensity of anger, often righteous or generous anger, aroused by something one considers mean, shameful, or otherwise unworthy of a man or men' (Webster's New Dictionary of Synonyms). 30 J. A. K. Thompson, Nicomachean Ethics, 1116b, and Kitab al-Akhlaq, 1116b. 31 Abdul Haq Ansari, The Ethical Philosophy of Miskawayh, 98. Cf. Tahdhib, 12b.</page><page sequence="7">THE ETHICAL PHILOSOPHY OF AL-RAGHIB AL-ISFAHANI 57 Greek equivalent, thumos which means 'strong feeling, spirit, temper, courage, mettle, and zeal of anger'. Interestingly, Ghazall uses the term ghadabiyya, but when he wants to suggest its positive function of subduing the appetitive faculty he uses ghadabiyya along with hamiyya.31 This is also found in the MTzan al-'Amal. Sometimes Ghazall uses it as two separate words, al-gbadab iva-l-bamiyya, or, as a unitary expression, al-bamiyya al-gbadabiyya.33 As we said, hamiyya serves the function of protecting what is honourable and sacred. Thus the intellect, which is considered to be honourable, must be protected in order to make its virtue become evident. As Raghib states: wa li-hadha la yatabayyanu fadilat al-'aql li-man la hamiyyata lahu,34 Incidentally, this same sentence is used by Ghazall in the MTzan al-'Amal with slight changes: wa-li-dhalika la tatabayyanu fadilat al-'aql li-man la hamiyyata lahu.3S Since the term hamiyya is likely to be a unique contribution of Raghib, it is inevitable that al-Ghazall must have appropriated this term from him. We shall illustrate al-Ghazall's reliance on al-Dbari'a later. A healthy balance among the three faculties (the rational, the appetitive, and the indignant) leads to the four Platonic cardinal virtues of wisdom (hikma), temperance ('iffa), courage (shaja'a), and the equilibrium of these three, justice ('adala).36 Daiber presents a list of vices and virtues to illustrate that Raghib used Miskawayh, but not slavishly. Raghib would sometimes use different terms and give Miskawayh a different orientation and context.37 He modified Miskawayh's thoughts by using additional sources such as the Qur'an. For example, the Neoplatonic notion of the soul's purity is taken from Miskawayh, but Raghib associates it with the Qur'anic concept of khalifa.38 After quoting two Qur'anic verses (2:30; 6:165) to substantiate God's appointment of man as vicegerent {khalifa) on earth, Raghib points out that God's khalifa is only permissible with the purification of the soul, as Islamic worship is only permissible with the purification of the body.39 He explains that his book is intended to be a Means (al-Dharfa) to the Noble Qualities of Law (Makarim al-Sharf a), and how man may attain to servitude {'ubiidiyya) of God, a status which is honourable for the God-fearing, and, moreover, how to surpass this level by becoming 32 al-GhazalT, Ihya' 'Uliim al-DTn, III, p. 9 li. 23-30. 33 al-GhazalT, MTzan al-'Amal, 236-7. 34 al-Dharfa, 102, li.6: 'The virtue of the intellect cannot become evident for one who has no (sense of) indignation.' 35 MTzan, 137, li.19. This sentence is not to be found in the Ihya'. 36 Ibid. 16-17. Dharfa, 60; cf. Tahdhib, op. cit. 128a-129b. Ibid. 59; cf. Daiber, op. cit. 186. Raghib, op. cit. 59.</page><page sequence="8">5Â» YASIEN MOHAMED khalifa, which is honourable for the righteous and the martyrs.40 The combination of the Law, together with the noble qualities of the Law (through knowledge and action), must lead to high spiritual rank, piety, and heaven.41 This passage (p.59 li.1-12) is the quintessence of Raghib's ethics. It leads man to happiness (sa'ada) in this world and in the next. This is akin to Miskawayh, whose idea is consistent with the Platonic\x=req-\ Peripatetic tradition. But Raghib combines the concept of worship ('ibada) and the Aristotelian-Platonic virtues with the Qur'anic notion of khalifa. Raghib starts with the premiss that 'absolute noble qualities' such as wisdom (.hikma), generosity (jud), knowledge ('ilm), forbearance (hilm), and pardon {'afw) can be used to describe God.42 Miskawayh mentions the same qualities except for 'afw. Elsewhere Raghib describes them as leading to the imitation (iqtida') of God in ruling (siyasa) according to human ability. This new variant of the Platonic-Neoplatonic likeness of God played a big role in Islamic political philosophy.43 A passage in Dharfa (p.103 li. 6â€”9) echoes the Platonic conflict between intellect and passion, but Raghib describes it with an additional picture which may also be traced back to a text by Galen:44 Furthermore, the parable of the intellect is like the parable of the rider hunting for prey; his passion is like his horse and his anger is like his dog. If the rider is skilful, his horse is tamed, and his dog is trained, he is able to realize his needs through hunting; but when he is stupid, and his horse is defiant or obstinate, and his dog is voracious, then his horse cannot proceed below him, nor will his dog comply with him obediently, thus he deserves to perish, not to mention of the fact that he is not aware of what he really required.45 By comparing the above with the translation of Galen's passage in Rosenthal, one can immediately notice that the same idea of conflict 40 Ibid. 59. 41 Ibid. 42 Ibid. 43 Cf. Daiber, op. cit. 44 Abdurrahman Badawl, Dirasat wa-Nusiis ftl-Falsafa wa-l-'Ulum 'inda l-'Arab, 192. For a translation of this passage, see F. Rosenthal, The Classical Heritage in Islam, 87-8. See also Richard Walzer, Greek into Arabic, 142-63. Galen's De Moribus was probably written in Rome between AD 185 and 192. An Arabic summary, which is based on a translation by Hunayn ibn Ishaq in AD 842, is available. This has been published by Paul Kraus in 1939. The De Moribus contains four books with one of the principal topics of ethical philosophy dealing with character (cf. Walzer, 142-4). The Arabic text (27 pp.) with a preface (24 pp.), also in Arabic, has been published: Kraus, 'Kitab al-Akblaq li-Jalmus\ Bulletin Faculty of Arts, Egyptian University, 5 (1939). Cf. Rosenthal, 85. Miskawayh used Galen as a source, as Walzer states: 'We have a few references to and even some verbal quotations of the fuller text in later Arabic writers, particularly in Abu All Miskawayh's Tabdhtb al-Akhlaq' (143). 45 al-Dbarta, 104, li.lOff.</page><page sequence="9">THE ETHICAL PHILOSOPHY OF AL-RAGHIB AL-ISFAHANI 59 between the intellect and passion is expressed, with the same analogy being used. Also the same relationship between the rider, his horse, and the dog is expressed. When comparing the Arabic passages we notice the difference in wording and grammatical usage. Raghib uses the word mathlu and Galen qiyas; Raghib uses al-'aql and Galen al\x=req-\ natiqa; Raghib uses ghadab and Galen al-nafs al-ghadabiyya. Raghib uses nouns, while Galen uses verbs to express the same idea: Raghib states kalbubu 'aquran, and Galen 'aqarahu kalbuhu; Raghib uses farasubu jumiihan and Galen jamaha bihi farasabu; Raghib uses yaslasu and munqadan separately, and Galen uses one expression, salisat al-inqiyad.46 Raghib compares the intellect to a rider, passion to the horse, and anger to the dog. The identical analogy is found in Galen except that Galen uses the word al-nafs al-natiqa instead of 'aql. As shown above, Raghib and Galen use different words to connote the same idea; Raghib uses nominal sentences and Galen verbal sentences; but interestingly, the nouns and the verbs come from the same root letters. Furthermore, Raghib's passage is more concise and precise, whereas Galen's passage is more elaborate and explicit, probably for the sake of elucidation. Thus, although these two passages are not exact parallels because of the differences in style, grammatical usage, and degree of conciseness, the idea of conflict between intellect and passion is the same, the analogy is the same, as are some of the words. This analogy can also be found in Miskawayh's ethics,47 when he attempts to illustrate the relationship of each of the three faculties of the soul with each other. Compared with Galen, he provides a more detailed description of the consequences when the horse and the dog are disobedient to the rider. The wording, however, is completely different. Although Raghib and Galen have different styles, they use words which have the same root stems. Such a connection in word usage is absent when comparing Raghib and Galen with Miskawayh. Since Raghib could not have used Miskawayh as a source because of the dissimilarity in their passages, it is more probable that he could have used Galen as a source for his analogy. Although we know Miskawayh cites Galen in his Tabdhib, it is unlikely that he used Galen as a source for his analogy. We shall demonstrate later that the above picture, with the same idea of conflict between passion and intellect, and the very same wording, is to be found in the Ibya' and MTzan of al-Ghazall. 46 See the transliteration of Raghib's passage in Table A. For Galen's passage see Badawl, op. cit. 192. 47 Miskawayh, op. cit. 33b; cf. Zurayk, op. cit. 47.</page><page sequence="10">6o YASIEN MOHAMED RAGHIB AND ISLAMIC THEOLOGY Accusations of Raghib being a Shi'ite or Mu'tazilite emerged only after his death. According to 'AjamT, Raghib did not have a bias for any particular school (madhbab), but was mainly preoccupied with the study of Man (msan).48 In the Rawdat al-Jannat he is classified as belonging to the Shafi'T legal and Ash'arite theological schools. The dispute concerning his bias for Shi'ism stems from his love for the family of the Prophet, and from his habit of narrating stories about them and quoting from their works. These accusations have sometimes reached a point of exaggeration when, for example, Khwansarl claimed that Raghib only cited from 'AlT and not from the other caliphs.49 TabrisI states in Asrar al-lmama that Raghib was one of the Shi'ite sages. He argues that Raghib was charged with being a Mu'tazilite, which suggests his affinity to Shi'ism. Furthermore, Raghib's preference for the sayings of 'All, and the fact that he comes from Isfahan, attests to his Shi'ism.50 Another argument is his concern for the intellect, which, according to 'AjamT, is not alien to Islam.51 According to Madelung, Raghib's sympathy with 'All and his descendants reflects the atmosphere of the Buwayhids.52 The Buwayhid dynasty ruled in what is today Iraq, from 320/932 to 447/1055. By 945 the three Buwayhid brothers had their courts in Shiraz, Isfahan, and Baghdad. They left the caliph in Baghdad as a figurehead with little authority, but he was responsible to the Buwayhids as military lords. The Buwayhids took the task of cultural patronage from the caliphs, and although they encouraged Shi'ite theological writers, they also allowed the caliphs to encourage Sunn! learning. They also encouraged 48 Dhatfa. Cf. 'Ajami's introduction, 26. 49 Ibid. We know that this argument is unsound because even in the DharTa he cites from the sayings of 'Umar b. al-Khattab, Abu Bakr al-Siddlq, Mu'awiya b. AbT Sufyan, and other Companions. But most of the sayings are from AlT b. AbT Talib. 50 Ibid. 27. Part II (pp. 167-288) of the Dhar'Ta is devoted to the nobility of the intellect. It is a long section dealing with his epistemological theory. 51 Ibid. 31-4. 'AjamT argues that the Qur'an talks about the importance of the intellect, and that scholars such as MuhasibT (d. 245/859), MawardT (d. 450/1058), and Ibn Sam'anT (d. 489/1095) have written about its importance. Like Raghib (169), MawardT makes a distinction between the instinctive and the acquired intellect. Even Ibn Taymiyya combines intellect with Law in his dar' ta'arud al-'aql wa-l-naqlj the Law is independent, but we can only know it through the intellect. However, Ibn Taymiyya argues that the al-'aql al-mustafad (active intellect) is alien to the Qur'an. Thus, 'AjamT argues that Raghib's concern with the intellect is no proof of being a Mu'tazilite. He also attempts to refute the claim of 'Abbas Muhammad Ahmad that Raghib denied God's attributes, stating that there is no evidence from the page cited by the said scholar. Cf.

As they became increasingly dependent on Turkic slave soldiery, the Buwayhid dynasties eventually succumbed to Seljuq power by 1055.53 Until then, it had been a period of creative religious writing in Shi'ite history. For example, the Nahj al-Balagha was compiled and edited by the poet al-SharTf al-Radl (407/1016). While the political prominence of the Shi'ites was transitory, their intellectual contribution had a pervasive influence on subsequent centuries, even within Sunn! circles. Their influence was not only the general exaltation of 'All, but more specifically in the widespread use by Sunn! scholars of Nahj al-Balagha, almost as a secondary scripture after the Qur'an and HadTtb.54 Raghib exemplified this trend. There are twenty-four of All's sayings cited in the DharVaâ€”many more than any of the other Companions of the Prophet.55 To be sure, this reflects the spirit of the time, and it was therefore not unusual for a Sunn! scholar to quote extensively from the Nahj al-Balagha. The argument that Raghib is a Shi'ite because of his preference for All's sayings is therefore dismissed. Undeniably, Raghib quoted extensively from 'All's sayings. This reflected more the relevance of the subject-matter, and easy access to the Nahj al-Balagha. Raghib's main preoccupation was not to take a middle position between Shi'ism and Sunnism, but rather to develop a SharT'ite basis for his concept of man.56 Al-NahT states that Raghib is not a Mu'tazilite, but his attempt to link 'aql with shar' is because of the influence of MaturTdiyya and his inclination to Sufism.57 Many Shi'ites regard him as Shi'ite, and SunnTs generally regard him as Mu'tazilite. 'All TabrisT (698/1299) considers him as one of the Shi'ite philosophers (min hukama' al-ShTa).58 SunnTs state he was a Mu'tazilite, probably because of his way of interpreting Qur'anic anthropomorphic verses; for example, he interprets God's face (wajh) as His essence (dhat).59 Madelung points out that Raghib rejects the Mu'tazilite concept of free-will, that his complaint against them is that they attribute man's actions to himself and, by so doing, deny the original cause.60 53 Marshall G. S. Hodgson, The Venture of Islam, II. 35. 54 Ibid. 37-8. Dharta, 'AjamT's index, 473-5. Raghib cites from Abu Bakr al-Siddlq twice, Mu'awiya b.

They refer to two verses which do not bear any proof (for what they claim).'61 In al\x=req-\ Dharfa, he differs from the Mu'tazilites concerning the concept of faith (Tman). Raghib states that one who utters the declaration (shabada) from his heart is a believer (mu'min). But one who utters it with his tongue, but it is not in his heart, is accountable to God, for He alone knows what is in his heart.62 Furthermore: The Law (Sharf a) also becomes applicable in designating faith (Tman) on someone who manifests it from himself, but not by examining his heart, so one should abstain from designating faith on someone who does not reveal anything which negates faith. The contrary is what some Mu'tazilites claim: that it is incorrect to call someone a believer (mu'min) who has not been tested in the five principles; and that a thorough inspection should be taken regarding the reality of what he is.63 Thus Raghib disagrees with the Mu'tazilite concept of faith (based on man's action); and secondly, with the Mu'tazilite view that a believer 61 al-Raghib al-IsfahanT, Kitab al-I'tiqadat, 98. The key expressions in those verses are lan tardrii (you will not see Me) and la tudrikuhu al-absdr (the visible creation does not perceive Him). Raghib also differs from the Mu'tazilites concerning the knowledge (ma'rifa) of God which they claim to be acquired, whereas it is part of the human fitra (ibid. 35-6). 62 Dharfa, 210-11. 63 Dharfa, 211. For the five principles of the Mu'tazilites cf. Abu Rayyan, TarTkh al-Fikr al-Falsaft fT l-lslam, 163â€”9. We state briefly the main points: (a) al-Tawhid: God is knowing ('Alim) by His essence, not by an attribute of knowledge. Attributes are not independent of God's essence. God should be free from similitudes akin to human attributes. So vision of God in the Hereafter is denied because human vision cannot see the absolute soul (riihan mutlaqan) (Rayyan, 160-2). God is not a physical substance which requires length, breadth, direction, and incidents, but He is eternal (Rayyan, 163). (b) al-'Aql: divine justice is a response to the claims of the intellect and logic. Since man is free, he creates his own actions, and therefore he is responsible for them. Lying, stealing, killing is not evil because the Law states it is, but it is evil in itself. Thus, man is responsible for noble qualities (makarim al-akhlaq) even if the Law has not reached him (Rayyan, 165â€”8). (c) Manzila bayn al-manzilatayn: one who commits a major sin is a fasiq (wrongdoer). Faith is knowledge in the heart, confirmation by tongue, and action by limbs. Every action, fard or nafal, enters faith. Thus faith increases with increasing good, and decreases with decreasing good. (d) Wa'd wa-l wa'Td: divine justice necessitates reward for obedience, and punishment for disobedience (if no repentance). (e) Amr bi-l ma'riif wa-nahT 'an al-munkar: principle of struggle against those who transgress God's commandments (Rayyan, 168-9).</page><page sequence="13">THE ETHICAL PHILOSOPHY OF AL-RAGHIB AL-ISFAHA NI 63 must be tested in its principles (see below). In the third principle every action has a bearing on faith, whereas Raghib is suggesting that faith cannot be judged on the basis of action, for it is a matter of the heart over which only God has jurisdiction. In his Kitab al-l'tiqadat, Raghib outlines the seven principles of the ahl al-Sunna,64 which are elaborated upon throughout his book. The main pillars are: 1. God is one, nothing in the creation resembles Him, or shares with Him, except in some of His names, and then too, only in words but not in meaning.65 2. Belief in God's attributesâ€”that He has knowledge, power, and sight. God's sight does not take a visible form (ghayr mahsus). 3. Belief in all His actions {af al)â€”good and evil is by His knowledge, wish, will, decree, and power. 4. Belief in iva'Tdâ€”none should despair of His Mercy: if God wishes he punishes or forgives. 5. Belief that faith is in the heart, confirmed by the tongue, enacted by the limbs, increases with obedience and decreases with disobedience.66 6. Qur'an is the speech of God, it should not be described as created (makhluq). To attribute createdness to God's speech is a lie (kadhib) and an innovation {bid'a). One should also believe that His speech is like the rest of His attributes, and that not a single one of the attributes can be compared with the attributes of the creation.67 7. Belief in Imama (kbilafa)â€”God promised the believers that He would make them successors (khulafa') ,68 This is not the place to analyse these principles; it is sufficient to examine principle 5 and compare it with the Hanafite and Mu'tazilite theological perspectives. By so doing we hope to bring into focus Raghib's theological position. First of all, the ahl al-Sunna belief (principle 5) is in fact an expression of the Ash'arite theological view. Faith (Tman) consists of both word 64 DharTa, 28-31. Cf. Rayyan, op. cit. 338-41. The fifteen principles of ahl al-Sunna, as outlined by 'Abd al-Qahir al-Baghdadl (d. 429/1037), are mentioned here. Vtiqadat, 28. Cf. DharTa, 58. 66 Cf. Dharfa, 215-16. I'tiqadat, 29-30; 170-4. Cf. Abul-Hasan al-Ash'ari, al-Ibana 'an Usui al-Diyana, 20-8. This view is contrary to the Mu'tazilite view that the Qur'an is created; it is hadTth ft mahall (occurs in place). The Ash'arites make a distinction between the kalam al-nafs which is eternal (as the Qur'an) and kalam al-Mutalafi which is created, such as the letters, sounds, and reading of the Qur'an within the range of time; but it does not mean that they are the words of the Prophet because they are created before revelation. Cf. Rayyan, 200 ff. 68 I'tiqadat, 28-31.</page><page sequence="14">64 YASIEN MOHAMED and deed, and increases or decreases according to performance of SharT'ite duties.69 This view is at variance with the MaturTdite Hanafite theological position that faith is in word only, belonging to the heart and tongue. In other words, faith is inner conviction accompanying the formal profession of faith (sbahada).70 The Mu'tazilite view holds that faith is knowledge in the heart, confirmation by the tongue, and action by the limbs. It rejects the Hanafite position of faith being inner assent and outward confession. Rather, it holds that faith is the performance of all religious duties, obligatory and supererogatory, though in many cases the omission does not constitute disbelief (kufr). One who commits a major sin is a wrongdoer (fasiq), and he is in a state between Tman and kufr.71 Thus Raghib's theological position on this matter is clearly Ash'arite. That faith increases and decreases in accordance with SharT'ite duties is further confirmed by his chapter on Tman in his Dhar'Ta. He makes plain that faith consists of both word and action, and complete faith cannot exist in an adulterer (zanT) or a thief (sariq). That is to say, actions will determine the level of faith of the believer.72 Similarly, with the Mu'tazilite, faith consists of both word and action, and Raghib would not disagree with this. However, the Mu'tazilites make every action part of faith to the extent that the grave sinner is in a state between faith and unbelief. In this respect a Mu'tazilite considers himself capable of passing judgement on the state of a person's belief. While Raghib recognizes the impact of action on one's faith, he leaves the judgement of one's faith to God. Since faith is contained in the heart, only God can judge what is in it. There is no reason why a person who professes faith, and who does not do anything which clearly negates it, should not be considered a believer. Furthermore, Raghib rejects the judgemental approach of the Mu'tazilites who expect a person to pass through their five principles before he can be worthy of 69 Montgommery Watt, The Formative Period of Islamic Thought, 315; cf. Dharfa, 215-16. 70 Watt, loc. cit. Abu HanTfa held that Tman is indivisible and does not increase or decrease. In article 1 in Fiqh al-Akbar he rejects the Mu'tazilite view: 'We do not declare anyone an unbeliever through sin, and we do not exclude anyone from Tman.' Cf. Watt, op. cit. 132. The implication, thus, is that acts are not part of Tman. 71 Ibid. 134-5. The intermediate position between faith and unbelief originally has political implications. It was probably first applied to 'Uthman and subsequent to his death with all its implications. The Murji'ites were the first to respond to Kharijite extremism of expelling the grave sinner from the community. To the Murji'ites this question of the belief status of the grave sinner should be 'postponed'. The intermediate position of the Mu'tazilite position is therefore not far removed in practice from the Murji'ite position (Watt, op. cit. 229-30). 72 Sharfa, 215-16.</page><page sequence="15">THE ETHICAL PHILOSOPHY OF AL-RAGHIB AL-ISFAHANI 65 the name of iman. Although Raghib differs from the Maturldite Hanafite position of limiting faith to the heart and tongue, he is closer to their position than the Mu'tazilite with regard to recognition of who can be classified as a believer. That is to say, as long as a person professes the faith with inner conviction he is a believer. Although Raghib comes from Isfahan, and his citations are mostly from 'All, his theological views, elaborated upon in his Kitab al-Vtiqadat, are within the framework of the SunnI Ash'arite tradition. To situate Raghib's theology historically would obviously have been easier had we known more about his life. Nevertheless, by looking at some of the theological developments of his era, we should be able to gain some historical perspective. Kalam (demonstrations of articles of faith) as a speculative method only gradually earned the respect of the Shari'ite-orientated 'ulama\ The original Mu'tazilite school of Kalam was represented both among the SunnTs and especially among the Shi'ites. The more creative attempts were from the Ash'arite and Maturldite schools. Although the Malik! schools tended to abstain from Kalam speculation, it was a Malik! qadT, al-Baqillan! (404/1013), who did the most to popularize Ash'arite Kalam.73 He developed a systematic, comprehensive doctrine (such as atomic creation). Since he was orientated towards polemic within the Kalam tradition, he seems to have insisted that those who believed without sound reason were not sound believers. This would presumably imply that those who did not accept Ash'arite Kalam were not true believers.74 Baqillan! maintained that, since it was possible to derive true conclusions from false premisses, 'the demonstrations of the articles of faith are reversible in the sense that, if the demonstrations are wrong, the things proven by them are wrong.' Thus, demonstrations of the articles of faith (or premisses upon which they are based) hold the same position as articles of faith themselves.75 Imam al-Haramayn Juwayn! (419/1028-478/1085) used more subtle methods than his predecessors. Although his purpose was still polemic, he continued with the atomistic doctrine in a more rationalistic, philosophical vein.76 Inevitably, it dominated the Ash'arite school of his 73 Hodgson, op. cit. 175. 74 Ibid. 176. Some Mu'tazilites seem to have adopted a similar position with regard to non-Mu'tazilites. It is this judgemental attitude of the Mu'tazilites which Raghib rejected. Cf. Dbari'a, 211. 75 H. A. Wolfson, The Philosophy of the Kalam, 40. 76 Juwaynl's work is apparently more refined than al-Ash'ari's; it reflects his acute awareness of the intellectual standards of logic and metaphysics maintained by the Faylasufs. He recognized that the early Ash'arite attempt to maintain God's omnipotence was rationally unsatisfactory. Ibid. 177.</page><page sequence="16">66 YASIEN MOHAMED time.77 He witnessed the last attempt of the people of HadTth to suppress Kalam disputation altogether. The vizier of Tughril Beg, al-Khunduri, ordered the cessation of all Kalam teaching. JuwaynT and other Kalam scholars were restored to favour only after Alp Arslan's vizier, Nizam al-Mulk, came to power. He was a Sunn! Persian, trained in the GhaznavT administration in Khurasan, and he sought the loyalty of Sunn! administrators for his centralized system. He personally founded the Nizamiyya madrasa in Baghdad (460/1067) which had a broad orientation, not limited to the teaching of HadTth and fiqh. Kalam disputation, especially in the Ash'arite and Maturidite forms, became a standard part of the training of 'ulama', despite the objections of the Hanbalites. Sunn! Kalam became part of the intellectual life which had integrated elements of Falsafa and Sufism as well as the literary traditions of adab. All these elements could be found in the same books and the same men.78 The Kalam scholars of this time attempted to modify the conclusions of Falsafa, to bring its analyses closer to the loyalties of the Islamic community.79 Interestingly, but not surprisingly, it was with Juwaynl's disciple, Abu Hamid al-Ghazall (450/1058-505/1111), that Kalam came to make full use of the resources of Falsafa and was able to meet it on its own terms.80 In 1091 GhazalT became the director of the Nizamiyya madrasa at Baghdad.81 Since the intellectual climate of this period in Baghdad was one where the scholars were exposed to philosophical and theological ideas, it gave them the opportunity to integrate these elements into their Islamic world view. Raghib must have lived during this period, and in this broad intellectual atmosphere, which gave birth to his creative ethical treatise, al-Dhart'a ila Makarim al-Sharfa. AL-DHART'A: PRINTING, MANUSCRIPTS, AND 'AJAMI'S EDITION According to AjamT, the text of al-Dhan a has been published several times, first in 1299/1881 and finally in 1400/1979. The first edition was 77 Hodgson, op. cit. 176. 78 Ibid. 48. A study of the DharVa reveals that Raghib himself had integrated all these elements into his world view. Philosophical, mystical, theological, literary, and Shari'ite elements are reflected in this work. 79 Ibid. 179. 80 Ibid. 180. 81 Ibid. 108. The Ash'arite doctrine was defended at the Nizamiyya, and the bila kayfa attitude dropped into the background. During this period much stress was laid on the fact that a Muslim should have reasons for his faith, otherwise he cannot be a true Muslim.

In the latter Taha 'Abd al-Ra'uf Sa'ad claims his edition is a new effort, but in reality it is no different from the original printed version. In 1400/1979 the Beirut publisher, Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyya, brought out the same version, copied from the 1308/1890 printing.83 Thus all these printed versions are taken from the same source, Najjar. It has to be noted, however, that Najjar did not base his corrected version in 1890 on all the manuscripts available and the accuracy of all the subsequent editions based on this has to be questioned. Fortunately, we now have available to us the first critical edition of al-Dharfa, printed in Cairo in 1987. The editor, Abu al-Yazld al-Ajaml, based his edition of al-Dharfa on three texts, the printed version and two manuscripts. One is the Berlin manuscript (3345/Oct), and the other the Dar al-Kutub al-Misriyya manuscript (b. 22994). AjamI considered the Berlin manuscript to be the oldest (592/1195),84 but the oldest is in Princeton University Library, dated Sha'ban 584/Sept. 1188. This manuscript is not complete. AjamT found a big difference between the Berlin manuscript and the printed version. The other manuscript he chose, although dated 1121/1709, was copied from a manuscript copied by Muhammad Sa'Td, dated 697/1297. This he determined from its title-page.85 Furthermore, the Cairo manuscript, though dated 1121/1709, was revised by Ahmad b. Nasir al-DIn b. 'Ali al-Baqa'T al-Shami in 1343/ 1924. Apparently, he based his corrections on two other manuscripts, and, when AjamI compared it with the Berlin version, it was very similar. In the footnotes of Ajaml's edition he referred to the Berlin text as 'alif', the other as 'dal', and the printed version 'ta'.

THE CONTENTS (PART I) The structure of the content of al-Dharf a is as follows: (a) part I (pp. 58-166); (b) part II (pp. 169-288); (c) parts III-VII (pp. 289-426). Part I forms the major part of al-Dharfa which contains Raghib's philosophical exposition of his ethical theory. Part II forms the second major part of al-Dharf a where Raghib devotes his attention to a discussion of the intellect, a keynote of his ethical philosophy. As in other moralists such as al-Ghazall, the intellect is viewed as the faculty which enables man to acquire knowledge and virtue; it distinguishes him from the rest of the creation, entitling him to be the vicegerent of God on earth. The author divides intellect into natural and acquired intellect, and the former which is an inborn aptitude is actualized by the latter. The intellect is organically connected to revelation; the intellect cannot be guided without the revelation, nor can revelation be made explicit without the intellect. The moral qualities of the Law, as already noted in part I, can only be achieved through the reform of the appetitive and the indignant faculties. This is only possible if the faculty of indignation is obedient to the intellect. The Islamic Law or the Sharta (based on Qur'an and HadTth) is the foundation for Raghib's ethical theory. The rules of Law (ahkam al-SharTa) include both the noble qualities (makdrim) and the prescribed acts of worship (cibada).90 Noble qualities are part of worship, but not all forms of worship are part of noble qualities. Noble qualities of the Law are additional to worship which is compulsory, and they are unacceptable without the acts of worship.91 Man has been created for three specific functions: the making of civilization, worship, and vicegerency (khilafa) of God. Vicegerency is defined as 'imitation of God in accordance with man's ability in ruling by application of the noble qualities of Law'. The noble qualities 88 Carl Brockelmann, Geschichte der arabiscben Litteratur, I. 289. 89 Ibid. 506. Dhatfa, 58. 91 Ibid. 94.</page><page sequence="19">THE ETHICAL PHILOSOPHY OF AL-RAGHIB AL-ISFAHANI 69 are wisdom, justice, forbearance, beneficence, and graciousness. The purpose of these is to attain paradise and proximity to God.92 It is precisely man's capacity to attain these noble qualities which entitles him to become vicegerent of God. For him to surpass the level of servitude to God, he has to combine it with the status of vicegerency which is an honour for the righteous ones and the martyrs. It is by combining the rules of the Law with the noble qualities of the Law that man will attain to perfect piety, high rank, and paradise.93 The basis for vicegerency is the purification of the soul; and he who has not purified his soul (or attained to noble qualities of the Law) is not fit for vicegerency.94 The soul must be purified by improving the three faculties of the soul in order for noble qualities to emerge. By cultivating the faculty of thought (fikr), wisdom and knowledge will emerge; by subduing the faculty of appetite (shahwa), modesty and generosity will be attained and the gradual taming of the faculty of indignation (hamiyya) will cause it to yield to the intellect, and, consequently, courage and forbearance are obtained. When these three faculties are properly regulated, justice and benevolence arise.95 The appetitive faculty is the most recalcitrant. By crushing it, man rises above the bestial level and achieves a divine state. However, this is not possible without the faculty of indignation which must subdue it, and the faculty of indignation cannot subdue it without being receptive to the guidance of the intellect.96 Thus the virtue of the intellect cannot become evident without the faculty of indignation. The intellect cannot have mastery over the appetitive faculty without the aid of the faculty of indignation.97 Raghib reduces virtues to five divine gifts. The highest and noblest of virtues is the happiness of the Hereafter: it involves permanence without extinction, power without incapacity, knowledge without ignorance, and richness without poverty. The attainment of these is not possible without the virtues of the soul (al-fada'il al-nafsiyya). These are not possible without the perfection of reason through knowledge, temperance through God-fearingness, courage through struggle, and justice through fairness. These virtues make up the core of Raghib's ethical theory. These virtues are fulfilled through the bodily virtues (e.g. good health) and the external virtues (e.g. wealth). All these virtues require as a precondition the virtue of divine assistance (tawfiq).98 But the noblest 52 Ibid. 91. 93 Ibid. 59. 94 Ibid. 96: cf. 92. 95 Ibid. 100; cf. 111. 96 Ibid. 101. 97 Ibid. 102. 98 Ibid. 128. Ghazali's account of these goods in the Mtzan is identical to the Dhart*a, cf. M. A. Sherif, GhazalTs Theory of Virtue, 77.</page><page sequence="20">7Â° YASIEN MOHAMED of virtues is psychic virtue (which needs no preservation, is absolute, and is beneficial in this world and the Hereafter). This applies especially to intellect and knowledge. But external acquisitions such as wealth and honour belong to the average good deeds (al-khayrat al-mutawassita) because they are attracted to virtue at times (if accompanied by intellect) and to vice at times (when accompanied by ignor ance).99 However, all five types of goods and virtues are in need of one another. Otherworldly happiness cannot be attained without the virtues of the soul, and these in turn are in need of bodily and external virtues, which in turn depend on divine assistance. The principal virtues of the soul are four: reason, courage, temperance, and justice. These produce subsidiary virtues which in turn produce other virtues. For example, justice gives rise to mercy and mercy to forbearance which requires pardon.100 The virtues of the soul such as reason (intellect), courage, temperance, generosity, and justice are inseparable from one another, and they are interconnected so that the one implies the other. For example, if man is just, he will not take what does not belong to him, nor will he be selfish regarding what he possesses; and if he is courageous, his passion will not tempt him to take what is not his, nor will he oppress others, nor will he be grudging because of poverty. If the virtues of the soul are present in man, he will have present in him the state of humanity, freedom, and noble-mindedness. And upon these, submission, faith, God-consciousness, and sincerity are firmly established.101 AL-DHAR1A AS A SOURCE FOR AL-GHAZALI'S ETHICS Ghazall's ethics are contained in his MTzan al-'Amal, but also in parts of the Ibya' 'Uliim al-Dtn. According to Madelung, it is generally accepted that the MTzan al-'Amal was written soon after Ghazall's Mi'yar al-'ilm. Since the Mi'yar was finished in 488/1095â€”499/1105, the MTzan must have been an earlier work by al-Ghazall.102 Thus, since Ghazall's period of retreat into Sufism was between 488 and 499, the MTzan must have been written before this period of conversion to 99 Ibid. 131. 100 Ibid. 142. These four principal virtues are also expounded in MTzan and Ih-ya'. These virtues and their psychical basis are identical with their counterparts in the Greek philosophical tradition: cf. Sherif, op. cit. 24. 101 Ibid. 152. Madelung, op. cit. 152.</page><page sequence="21">THE ETHICAL PHILOSOPHY OF AL-RAGHIB AL-ISFAHANI 71 Sufism, and the Ihya' after this period. The MTzan therefore preceded the Ihya', and it should also be mentioned that the MTzan never quotes the Ihya'.103 Although attention has been given to the congruence between al-DharT a and al-MTzan, the question of dependence between both books has not been studied thoroughly.104 Madelung observes that al-Ghazall takes over wording of al-Raghib with a few minor changes, sometimes even taking an idea from Raghib and elaborating on it in his own words, using his own examples. It is evident where GhazalT has taken from Raghib when one compares their styles. Thus it is not possible for Ghazall and Raghib to have used the same source.105 We shall illustrate, by textual comparison, the dependence of al-MTzan on al-DharT'a. Also, we need to ask whether the ethical passages of the Ihya' were taken from the MTzan or directly from al\x=req-\ DharT a. We tabulate three passages: Table A is a passage from al\x=req-\ DharT a-, Table B a passage from al-MTzan-, and Table C a passage from Ihya'. TABLE A TABLE B TABLE C mathalu l-'aql ka-mathli faris mutasayyid wa\x=req-\ shahwatuhu ka-farsihls wa-ghadabahu ka-kalbihl fa-mata kana al-farisu hadhiqan wa-farasuhu murawidan wa-kalbuhu mu'allaman fa-huwa qamln bi-idrak hajatihl min al-sayd wa-mata kana akhraqa wa-farsuhu jumuhan aw kalbuhu 'aquran fa-la farsuhu yanba'ithu tahtahu munqadan wa-la kalbahu yaslasu ma'hu mutl'an fa-huwa qamTnun an ya'tabu fadlan "an an yudrika ma talab.106 mathalu l-'aql ka-mathlli faris mutasayyid wa-shahwatahu ka-farasihT wa-ghadabahu ka-kalbihl fa-mata kana al-farisu hadhiqan wa-farasuhu murawidan wa-kalbuhu mu'addaban mu'allaman munqadan sara harlyan bi-najah wa-mata kana huwa bi-nafsihi ahmaqa wa-kana al-farasu jumuhan wa-kalbuhu 'uquran fa-la farsahu yanba'ithu tahtahu munqadan wa-la kalbuhu yastarsilu bi-sharatihl mutl'an fa-huwa kbalTqun bi-an ya'tabu fadlan 'an an yanala ma talab.107 mathalu l-'aql ka-mathali faris mutasayyid wa\x=req-\ ghadabahu ka-kalbihl fa-mata kana al-faris hadhiqan wa\x=req-\ farasuhu murawidan wa-kalbuhu mu'addaban mu'allaman kana jadlran bi-l-najah. wa-mata kana huwa bi-nafsihi akhraqa wa\x=req-\ kana al-farasu jumuhan wa-l-kalbu 'aqQran fa-la farsuhu yanba'ithu tahtahu munqadan wa-la kalbuhu yastarsilu bi-sharatihl mutl'an fa-huwa khalTqun bi-an ya'tabu fadlan 'an an yanala ma talab.108 103 Maurice Bouyges, Essai de chronologie des oeuvres de al-Ghazzuli, 29.

Tables B and C are more or less the same as Table A except for one sentence (li.8â€”10) in Table A, omitted in B and C: fa-huwa qamTn bi-idrak hdjatihi min al-sayd (for then he is fit to realize his need through hunting). The word barunan in A is also entirely omitted in B and C. The following words and expressions in A are omitted in B and C but they have been replaced by other words in B and C: the word qamtnun is replaced by the synonym khalTqun-, and yudrika by the synonym yanala; and yaslasu ma'hu is replaced by yastarsilu bi-sbaratihT. If we observe difference between B and C, we find that C is identical to B except for one expression, sara banyan bi-najab (B), which is replaced by kana jadtran bi-l-najah (C). Also, the word abmaqa (B) is replaced by the word akbraqa (C). Interestingly, the latter word is also found in Table A. Thus, A, B, and C are almost identical. How do we explain this? It may be argued that Raghib and GhazalT have taken this idea from a common source, Miskawayh or Galen. As we have already shown, the greater probability is that Raghib took this idea from Galen rather than from Miskawayh. The same would apply to GhazalT, if we assume a common source, because of the connection between the wording of Miskawayh and the Raghib/GhazalT passage. But as we would have noticed, the wording and style are different. Just as it is not possible for al-Ghazall to have taken the wording from Galen, it is also not possible for Raghib to have done the same. The conclusion we come to, therefore, is that Raghib used his own words, but GhazalT copied them literally in the MTzan. Assuming the chronological sequence of these works that we have proposed, it can be assumed that B copied from A, and C copied from B. That is to say, GhazalT relied on passage A to write passage B, and he relied on passage B to write passage C. It appears that the MTzan was used for the ethical passages in the Ihya', but at the same time GhazalT used the Dharfa. For example, A is almost identical to B, which proves that GhazalT copied from the MTzan to prepare parts of the Ihya'. But how is it that GhazalT removed the word abmaqa (B), and replaced it by akbraqa? It is no coincidence that the latter word was also used by Raghib in the same passage (A) in the Dbari'a (p.104 li.6). We are therefore inclined to believe that GhazalT used the Mizan for writing parts of the Ihya but that he also made direct reference to al-Dharfa. Let us take another example from the Ihya' (p.10 li.lâ€”4) which is identical to a passage in the MTzan (p. 238 li. 13-20). The Ihya' passage must have been copied from the MTzan because they are identical. The same passage is in the Dbari'a (p. 103 li.7â€”10), though it is not identical to it. The only difference in the two passages is the word assarahw, it</page><page sequence="23">THE ETHICAL PHILOSOPHY OF AL-RAGHIB AL-ISFAHANI 73 is in the MTzan, but not in the Ihya' which uses the word hazzamahu. In the Dbarf a passage the word hazzamahu is also used. This proves our argument that GhazalT not only copied from the MTzan, but also made reference to the Dharf a in writing parts of the Ihya'. Furthermore, it may be assumed, the word assarahu in the MTzan is GhazalT's own word, but it is most probably a variant, taken from another manuscript of al-Dharfa. 'AjamT identified it as a variant in the 'dal' manuscript.109 To conclude, the description in these passages is not unique to Raghib because it is echoed in Miskawayh and other ethical writers before Raghib. Nevertheless, the textual similarity of these passages leads us to conclude that GhazalT's source was al-Dharf a. For a deeper insight into the philosophical ethics of al-Raghib al-Isfahanl a critical commentary of al-Dharfa with a literary and source analysis of the text is required. 109 'AjamT, 103. In his footnote to the word bazzamahu, he cites assarahu as a variant which is synonymous with the latter word, and which is found in the 'dal' manuscript and the printed version of the Dharf a.
