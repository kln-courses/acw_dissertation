<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews the text reproduces, often for the first time, materials attributed to Span- ish, French, and English adventurers, missionaries, government officials, artists, and scientists, including a 1941 essay written by a young Douglas Taylor, smitten by the way Caribs were misunderstood and mistreated in his adopted home, Dominica. His role in the so-called Carib War of 1930 on that island is only alluded to, but the recounting of that incred- ible episode and its shameful conclusion are enough to help us understand his bias. The forty-eight illustrations include a map showing some of the native Caribbean names for the islands of the Lesser Antilles, numerous photo- graphs of paintings and sketches from earlier times, and many photos of today's Caribs. As a specialist on Black Carib (Garifuna) culture, this writer rues that that branch of the Carib nation is not mentioned after their 1797 deportation to Central America, where they have, in fact, preserved more of the original culture than is to be found in the Lesser Antilles today. But that would have required another book, and Wild Majesty deserves to be emulated. As with all ethnohistory, the text is an interpretive exercise: the edi- tors' selections and interpretive introductions to each document or account orient the reader's own views and conclusions about the people and events described. A clear romantic element underlies the entire presentation, but that should make its perusal more enjoyable, for scholars and laypersons alike. The result is "straight" enough to please historians and social scien- tists, while the whole can be appreciated by any educated reader with interest in American Indians, the history of the Encounter, or the mod- ern Caribbean. For those without such interests or knowledge, this book could serve as an introduction, both painful in its revelations about much of the past, but at the same time, uplifting in its modern message, which is concisely foreshadowed in the dedication: "To commemorate 500 years of Carib survival on the islands of Dominica and St. Vincent." For many, survival is the real message of the Quincentennial itself. Blood-Sucking Witchcraft: An Epistemological Study of Anthropomor- phic Supernaturalism in Rural Tlaxcala. By Hugo G. Nutini and John M. Roberts. (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1993. xxii + 476 pp., pref- ace, introduction, maps, tables, conclusion, glossary, notes, references, index. $40.00 cloth.) Alan R. Sandstrom, Indiana University-Purdue University, Fort Wayne In December 1960 Hugo Nutini was conducting ethnographic fieldwork among the Nahuas in rural Tlaxcala when he was informed by Don Julian 69z</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Tecolotzin that bloodsucking witches had murdered seven babies in the night. Nutini subsequently documented forty-seven cases of infant death attributed by residents to bloodsucking. This monograph is a detailed study of the tlahuelpuchi, or bloodsucking witch, a creature implicated in a remarkable one-fifth of infant deaths in Tlaxcala. Nutini and the late John M. Roberts document the conditions that preceded the deaths as well as the psychological and social aftermath of each tragedy. The study is unmatched in the wealth of ethnographic data about a little-studied aspect of contemporary Mesoamerican culture. In the I96os many Tlaxcalans believed that the tlahuelpuchi prowled in search of young victims. According to informants, the witch transforms herself into an animal such as a turkey or donkey, approaches a victim's house, enters the house as a flea or bird, mesmerizes the adults, and pro- ceeds to suck the lifeblood from the infant. Upon completing her task, she leaves the body by the opened door and disappears into the night. Once the body is discovered, members of the victim's household enter into a state of extreme agitation and distress. Occasionally people organize a witch-hunt, and Nutini has documented cases where old women have been executed. Because of the long-term fieldwork of Nutini and others, Tlaxcala is a well-known region in the anthropological record. This book contrib- utes to that record, but several shortcomings undermine the strength of the ethnography. The lengthy theoretical and analytical sections are not as clear as they could be. Overly long sentences, sometimes idiosyncratic terms, and repetitiveness make the book difficult to read. Although the authors criticize the lack of ethnographic research on religion and witchcraft in Mesoamerica, they overlook recent new works on the Maya, Mixe, Otomi, and Nahua. They also omit the multivolume Etnolingiiistica series that includes several monographs on the Nahuas. Also absent from a book on anthropomorphic supernaturalism is refer- ence to the growing literature on the paper-figure complex among Nahua, Otomi, and Tepehua peoples just to the east of Tlaxcala. These figures are often anthropomorphic and could have enriched the analysis. The work also lacks clear theoretical direction. The authors lead the reader to believe that their analysis will transcend that found in clas- sic works such as Kluckhohn's Navaho Witchcraft (1944) and Evans- Pritchard's Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic among the Azande (I937). Yet after hundreds of pages of depse text they state, "No theory of bloodsuck- ing witchcraft or magical action has emerged, and from this standpoint, this monograph has not conceptually advanced what has been achieved by witchcraft studies so far" (398). The text is littered with interesting clues suggesting an alternative strategy for understanding the Tlaxcalan bloodsucking complex. The 693</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews infant dies from asphyxiation, and the tlahuelpuchi appears to be an ex post facto rationalization for infanticide. Usually discovered by an opened door where someone must have positioned the body, the victim is often a member of a family that already has many children. Also, the father is surprisingly sympathetic to the victim's mother even though he has a right to criticize her for neglecting to protect the child properly, and so on. In the absence of contraceptives and in difficult economic times, infanticide may be the only recourse for some families. By focusing on the "epistemology" of witchcraft, Nutini and Roberts do not discuss key vari- ables that may be required to explain this cultural complex. For example, in recent years, Tlaxcalans have been increasingly exposed to Mexican urban culture. This circumstance has resulted in increased economic op- portunity and the likely availability of contraceptives. Perhaps beliefs in bloodsucking witches decline when people no longer need this convenient scapegoat for redirecting accusations of infanticide. By focusing on bloodsucking witchcraft as an epistemological prob- lem, the authors are unable to explain why it sometimes occurs in epi- demics. Why seven incidents in one night? Clearly women coordinated their infanticide to give further credence to the witch's guilt in the episode. Inclusion of more pragmatic, materialist factors in their explanation of this phenomenon would in itself be a significant contribution to anthropo- logical explanations of witchcraft. Nutini and Roberts seem to overlook such factors in favor of more eclectic strategies in organizing their excel- lent empirical observations. Data on the role of children in the household economy, the effect of urban Hispanic domination on rural Tlaxcalans, and the transition from farming to factory work that has characterized the region would have been welcome. These data, in addition to descriptions of psychological states and alternative epistemologies, would contribute to a more satisfactory explanation of bloodsucking witchcraft. Nutini and Roberts have nevertheless provided a great service to Mesoamericanists and social scientists at large by publishing this compen- dium of data on Tlaxcalan bloodsucking witchcraft. Despite limitations in explanation and exposition, it is the finest description available of this cul- tural phenomenon and will contribute significantly to the ongoing debate over the role of witchcraft in human society. 694</page></plain_text>
