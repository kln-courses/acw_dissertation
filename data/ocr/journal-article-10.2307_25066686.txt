<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001-2005 For Dieter Mertens on his retirement INTRODUCTION Sicilian archaeology has had to face old and new challenges during the five years covered by this report. The protection and management of Italy's cultural heritage continue to be fundamental issues, just as in the last report (AR [2000-2001], 145). There has been a flurry of action and top-rate publication (itself deserving a review article) on archaeolog ical risk assessment, the prevention of looting and the illicit trade in antiquities, the cataloguing and conservation of finds and the political economy of cultural heritage. For a specifi cally Sicilian context for these issues, readers can turn to three recent publications: G.I. Rizzo and R. Trowse (eds), The Economics of Heritage: A Study in the Political Economy of Culture in Sicily (Cheltenham and Northampton, MA 2002); I. Romeo, Bern culturali nelle riviste siciliane: spoglio di articoli dal 1975 al 2000 (Palermo 2004); A. Sposito (ed.), Coprire Vantico (Palermo 2004). The problems of looting and the illicit trade in antiquities, which continue to plague Sicily, can be followed in a more general piece by G. Pastore, in N. Brodie, J. Doole and C. Renfrew (eds), Trade in Illicit Antiquities: The Destruction of the Worlds Archaeological Heritage (Cambridge 2001), 155-60. But alongside these developments, and in part related to them, are two crucial matters that need to be singled out and addressed, especially since their overall impact is still not clear. The first involves the watershed, both positive and negative, that 2001 was in the history of international cultural relations and heritage. This year saw the signing of a bilateral agreement between Italy and the USA to protect the former's cultural heritage, the Taliban's destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan, the election of Silvio Berlusconi's government in Italy and the 9/11 attacks in the USA. All these events quickly became entangled in Italy as Berlusconi's government initiated discussion of a programme aimed at revamping the nation's system of cultural heritage in favour of a model based on priva tization and economic criteria. Criticism was swift and intense and was led by the distinguished Cl art historian Salvatore Settis, currently director of the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, in two important monographs: Italia S.p.A. L 'assalto al patrimonio cult?rale (Turin 2002); Battaglie senza eroi. I beni culturali tra istituzioni e profitto (Milan 2005) (the latter is a helpful collection of Settis' main articles and correspondence with government officials otherwise scattered and in difficult to obtain publications). Settis cast his critique by reviewing the history and successes of Italy's state-sponsored institutions of cultural heritage, linking them to national unity and identity. In doing so he questioned the appropriateness of adopting American-style models, for which the Berlusconi government showed much admiration. The defeat of Berlusconi's government in May 2006 seems to have put such discussions and the overhauling they sought on hold. But, even so, as Settis himself also has written extensively about, there are unresolved underlying issues connected with the decline of Cl studies and systems of public education and research, for whose state of play the reader is referred to another two of his monographs: Quale eccellenze? Intervista sulla Normale di Pisa, edited by S. DeirOrso (Bari 2004); Futuro del 'classico ' (Turin 2004) (English edition published in 2007 by Polity in Cambridge). How these issues will play out remains to be seen. By contrast, it is already clear how the bilateral cultural agreement signed by Italy and the USA is playing out (for the agreement, see M. Papa Sokal, Accordia Research Papers 9 [2001-2003], 183-88; PIA VI, 530-33). The collecting practices of American art museums with material coming from Italy have come under close scrutiny. The J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, California and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York featured prominently in world news in early 2006. What garnered attention was the trial in Rome of Marion True, a former antiquities curator at the Getty, who is alleged to have trafficked looted objects, including some said to have come from Sicily (for details, see E. Bensard, Archeo xxii.4 [2006], 58-65), and the pledge by the Metropolitan Museum to return artefacts like the Euphronios krater and a Hel silver set, the latter reputedly from Morgantina in Sicily (see the section 'Central Sicily' below). A new leaf has certainly been turned, one which will have reverberations well beyond the two signatories of the agreement, as became evident in 2002 when Italy and Germany signed a similar bilateral agreement (M.A. von Hase Salto, Archeo xviii.6 [2002], 15). The second matter which requires singling out concerns the enlargement of the EU in 2004 and 2007, in which a dozen more states, located in central, southern and eastern Europe, joined. These states are all generally under developed by the regional policies of the EU (http://europa.eu/pol/reg/index_ en.htm), and how this will impact cultural funding in the longer term in regions like Sicily, which lost its 'have-not' status in 2005, is already starting to take shape. In interviews I have conducted in this reporting period with colleagues working in the Sicilian archaeological service the changed status has already been felt: there are fewer funds for projects. The trends and predictions in Sicilian archaeology noted in the previous report have all materialized in some way (AR [2000-2001], 145), as readers will see for themselves in the following pages. A new development, whose origins go back a generation in Sicily, needs highlighting: the organization of underwater archaeology has come to fruition. In 2004 a 'Soprintendenza del Mare' was created (http://www.regione. sicilia.it/beniculturali/archeologiasottomarina/), three years following the so-called 'Dichiarazione di Siracusa sul patrimonio cult?rale del mare Mediterr?neo' which, although not legally binding, represents a turning-point in underwater archaeology in Italy and other countries bordering on the Mediterranean Sea (see the overviews provided by G. Allotta, Tutela del patrimonio archeologico subacqueo [Agrigento 2001]; P. Pruned, ArchViva xxi.91 [2002], 78-79). The new Superintendency, whose mandate is no different from the Superintendencies dealing with cultural heritage on land, is based in Palermo and directed by Sebastiano Tusa, who has long been active in underwater research in the waters off Sicily (for his thoughts on this Superintendency and the future of underwater heritage, see Archeo xix.10 [2003], 32-37; Archeo xx.6 [2004], 14). It is the first Superintendency of its kind in all of Italy, and this should not cause surprise given the island's central location in the Mediterranean and long archae ological tradition. The creation of the 'Soprintendenza del Mare' could not have come at a better time, as interregional research in the anc. and Med Mediterranean gains momentum and as new directions in eco-archaeological or nature-archae ological parks are explored (for the latter, see UNA 31.1 [2002], 1-2, 74-82, 83-88). This is a chapter in Sicilian archaeology from which we can expect many more develop ments to report on in future years.</page><page sequence="2">124 FRANCO DE ANGELIS There are also some developments to note in connection with the sources of information for Sicilian archaeology. Many of the trends and predictions discussed in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 145-46) have continued and grown. Three new bibliographies deserve to be noted for the richness of their information: V Olivastri, Sicily (World Bibliographical Series vol. 213) (Oxford 1998) (which was missed in the last report); E. Acquaro (ed.), Bibliotheca phoenicia: dodicimila titoli sulla civilt? fenicia (La Spezia 2000); and F. Mora and V Aiello (eds), Polifemo: rassegna bibliogr?fica di storia delle religioni e storia antica (published annually in Messina 2001-). Of the already established bibliographies, there are three more volumes to note in the BTCGI series: xvi (2001), xvii (2001), and xix (2005). The internet is also being exploited for the dissemination of information, as was already the case in the previous reporting period (AR [2000-2001], 148-49). Individual archaeological projects often maintain their own webpages, but attention will be drawn here to three more broadly based sites, all containing Sicilian material: 'Fasti Online' (http://www.fastionline.org), which, like the 'Fasti Archaeologici', is the work of the Associazione Internazionale di Archeologia Classica in Rome; 'Archaeogate: il p?rtale italiano di archeologia' (http://www.archaeogate.org/iice/), run by the Istituto Italiano per la Civilt? Egizia at the University of Turin; and 'ArchaeoSicily' (http://www.palermoweb.com/archeo/index. asp), the initiative of Sicilian archaeologists operating out of Palermo. It is to be hoped that these and other websites will encourage the flow of information and help make good the time-lag confronted by many Italian journals, of which there are many new ones to report. We should first begin with some important updates on pre-existing journals. QuadMess, contrary to what was said in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 145), continues under new impetus. Despite a hiatus following the death of Sabatino Moscati, RSF also continues to be published, picking up the numbering of the last volume edited under the stewardship of the great master. The ArchStorSir now has a very handy general index prepared by F. Migliore, Archivio Storico Siracusano: indice gen?rale dei voll. 1-37: 1955-2002 (Siracusa 2003). Explosion describes accurately what has happened in Italy over the past years in respect of journal publishing. There are no fewer than 27 relevant new journals that must be mentioned, if only briefly. Three of these new journals (Archivium Historicum Mothycense, Mediterr?nea, and Sicilia Antiqua) deal specifically with Sicily, while others have broader mandates that can accommodate Sicilian material, as has already happened in the pages of some of them. Readers wishing to chase up more details about each of these journals are highly recommended to consult the recently revamped catalogue of the consortium of Rome's various libraries 'URBS' (or 'Unione Romana Biblioteche Scientifiche' located at http://www.reteurbs.org/). Here is the list (ordered alphabet ically) of new journals, all of them in theory published annually, but time-lags have already occurred in some cases: Agri Centuriati: An International Journal of Archaeology (Pisa 2004-); Ancient West and East (Leiden 2002-2006; Leuven 2007-); Anemos: studi di storia antica (Padua 2000-); Archaeologia Mar?tima Mediterr?nea: An International Journal on Underwater Archaeology (Pisa 2004-); Archaeologiae. Research by Foreign Missions in Italy: rivista semestrale (Pisa 2003-); Archeologia Aerea (Rome 2004-); Archeologia della acque: rivista semestrale di antropolog?a, archeologia, etnograf?a, storia delVacqua (Forli 1999-); Byrsa: rivista di arte, cultura e archeologia del Mediterr?neo p?nico (Sarzana 2003-); Eidola: International Journal of Classical Art History (Pisa 2004-); In binos actus lumina: rivista di studi e ricerche sull 'idraulica storica e la storia delta t?cnica (La Spezia 2002-); Incidenza dell'Antico: dialoghi di storia greca (Naples 2003-); Journal of Ancient Near Eastern Religions (Leiden 2001-); Journal of Intercultural and Interdisciplinary Archaeology (Naples 2003-; online only: http://www.jiia.it/); Marmora: An International Journal for Archaeology, History and Archaeometry of Marbles and Stones (Pisa 2005-); Medioevo Greco: rivista di storia e filolog?a bizantina (Alessandria 2001-); Mediterr?nea: ricerche storiche (Palermo 2004-); MHNH. Revista Internacional de Investigaci?n sobre Magia y Astrologla Antiguas (Malaga 2001-); Musiva &amp; Sectilia: An International Journal for the Study of Ancient Pavements and Wall Revetments in their Decorative and Architectural Context (Pisa 2004-); N?a Rh?me: rivista di ricerche bizantinistiche (Rome 2004-); Orizzonti: rassegna di archeologia (Pisa 2000-); Polis: studi interdis cip linar i sul mondo antico (Rome 2003-); Rivista di Studi Punici (La Spezia 2000-); Rivista Italiana di Archeoastronom?a (Rome 2003-); Sardinia, Corsica et Baleares Antiquae: International Journal of Archaeology (Pisa 2003-); Sicilia Antiqua: An International Journal of Archaeology (Pisa 2004-); Thalassa: genti e culture del Mediterraneao antico (Palermo 2004-); Workshop di Archeologia Classica: paesaggi, costruzioni, reperti (Pisa 2004-). The last journal in this list has been reviewed by V. Jolivet in BMCR 2006.02.37'; its comments are not just restricted to the new journal but also to the changes the Italian publishing industry has witnessed over the past several years. It is an insightful read. The dizzying pace of research referred to in previous Sicilian reports (AR [1995-1996], 59-60; AR [2000-2001], 146) continues at a more dramatic pace than ever. The Festschriften published in honour of distinguished senior colleagues are another important (and at times staggering) source of information for Sicilian archaeology, often providing ideal contexts for the more timely dissemina tion of research, as well as summaries of the honorand's life and bibliography. The late L. Bernab? Brea received five such volumes during this reporting period (Studi BdAB, Studi ClassiciBB, Studi MemoriaBB, Studi PreistoriciBB, Studi RiunioneBB). Other volumes have appeared for M.R. Cataudella (Studi Cataudella), the late A. Ciasca (Studi Ciasca), the late M. Cristofani (Studi Cristofani), E. De Miro (Studi De Miro), H.P. Isler (Studi Isler), the late B. Lavagnini (Studi Lavagnini), the late J. de Waele (Studi de Waele), the late Pierre L?v?que (AA.VV., Dialogues d'Histoire Ancienne suppl. vol. 1 [Paris 2005]), the late F. Sartori (Sileno 30 [2004]), and B. Shefton (Studies Shefton). Volumes in honour of two other prominent Sicilianists, S.N. Consolo Langher and the late S. Calderone (cf. EC. Flesca, Polis 1 [2003], 285-86), are in the works. Eleven other Festschriften should also be noted for their Sicilian connections, whether in terms of scholar and/or material: D. Calazza (ed.), It?lica ars. Studi in onore di Giovanni Colonna per il premio I Sanniti (n.p. [Italy] 2005); J.-M. Carrie and R. Lizzi Testa (eds), 'Humana sapit': ?tudes d'antiquit? tardive offertes ? Lellia Cracco Ruggini (Turnhout 2002); C. M?ller and F. Prost (eds), Identit?s et cultures dans le monde m?diterran?en antique en l'honneur de Francis Croissant (Paris 2002); AA.VV., A. Giuliano: scritti minori (Xenia Antiqua suppl. vol. 9) (Rome 2001); V.B. Gorman and E.W. Robinson (eds), Oikistes: Studies in Constitutions, Colonies, and Military Power in the Ancient World, offered in Honour ofA.J. Graham (Leiden 2002); AA.VV., Epigraphica: atti delle giornate di studio di Rome e di Atene in memoria di Margherita Guarducci (1902-1999) (Rome 2003); K.

Studi di amici e colleghi in onore di Vera von Falkenhausen, as a special issue of the new journal N?a Rh?me: rivista di ricerche bizantinistiche 1 (2004). (Studies on the lives and works of the recently deceased scholars receiving Festschriften are reported on below in the section 'History of Scholarship'.) The reprinted essays of distinguished colleagues are yet another invaluable source of information, especially since they bring together studies in publications often not possessed by other than the world's best libraries. Eight such volumes can be noted here: G. Colonna, Italia ante romanum imperium. Scritti di antichit? etrusche, italiche, romane (1958-1998), 6 vols, edited by C. Ampolo and G. Sassatelli (Pisa 2005); F. Cordano, Studi siciliani: miscellanea 1974-2000 (Milan 2000); M. Cristofani, Scripta selecta: trenta anni di studi archeologici sull'Italia preromana, 3 vols (Pisa 2001); A.J. Graham, Collected Papers on Greek Colonization (Mnemosyne vol. 214) (Leiden 2001); L. Polacco, L 'arte di Siracusa greca (NAC suppl. vol. 4) (Lugano 1998) (missed in the last report); D. Musti, Magna Grecia: il quadro storico (Rome 2005); F. Panvini Rosati, Monete e medaglie (Bolletino di Numism?tica suppl. vol. 37) (Rome 2004); M. Sordi, Scritti di storia greca (Milan 2002); F.W. Walbank, Polybius, Rome and the Hellenistic World: Essays and Reflections (Cambridge 2002). There has been little change in the structure and number of learned meetings since the last report (AR [2000-2001], 146), with one noteworthy exception: the Palermo conference on Sicilian antiquities did not happen at all (on the old cycle it would have taken place in late winter/early spring of 2005). This is no doubt a result of the death of E. Manni, the force who kept anc. Sicilian studies together. The unfortunate result for Sicilian archaeology is that there is no longer a forum for the public airing of basic archaeological reports by the various Superintendencies, which obviously makes the task of staying informed by those not directly involved in these excavations so much more difficult. This is not helped by the continuing shuffling of archaeological personnel around Sicily's Superintendencies, a legacy of the early 1990s crackdown on corruption (AR [1995-1996], 59). A major shuffle occurred in late 2004/early 2005, and this immediately impacted research, with individuals separated from their previous projects. It is to be wondered, just as my predecessor Roger Wilson did, how effective this bureaucratic shuffling is. The in-built limitations noted in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 147) have now been compounded with these problems. Meetings held in this reporting period that have been published are discussed below, if published between 2001 and 2005, and in the next report, if published in 2006 and after. The same goes for the exhibitions. Of those that happened and whose catalogues were published in the reporting period, we may note here the general exhibitions with relevance to all or large parts of Sicily, leaving the ones referring to particular themes and sites to the sections below: M. Salerno and I. Romeo (eds), L'isola molteplice: pluralit? d?lie culture nella storia della Sicilia (Palermo 2001) held in Turin; F. Spatafora and S. Vassallo (eds), Sicani, Elimi e Greci: storie di contatti e terre difrontiera (Palermo 2002) (reviewed in ArchViva xxi.96 [2002], 6-7) (the exhibition travelled from Palermo to Z?rich in 2004 and to Marseilles in 2006, resulting in German and French catalogues); M. Bennett, A.J. Paul and M. Iozzo, Magna Graecia: Greek Art from South Italy and Sicily (Cleveland 2002) held in Cleveland (for a synopsis, see M. Bennett and A.J. Paul, Minerva 13.6 [2002], 9-16; catalogue reviewed by D. Ridgway, AWE 4 [2005], 480-81); AA.VV, L'isola del mito: antiche e recenti scoperte archeologiche in Sicilia. Caltanissetta Ex Palestra Bilotta (zona San Francesco) via Villarosa 7 dicembre 2005-22 gennaio 2006 (Palermo 2005). For an exhibition of another kind, showcasing French archaeo logical work, see AA.VV., Arch?ologies. Vingt ans de recherches fran?aises dans le monde (Paris 2005), which, although it contains nothing on Sicily per se, gives an excellent overview of the aims and extent of recent French work. Three new research institutes/centres and a new association deserve mention here too. First, a merger between the Istituto per 1'Archeologia Etrusco-italica and the Istituto per la Civilt? Fenicia e P?nica has occurred. The new institute is called the Istituto di Studi sulle Civilt? Italiche e del Mediterr?neo Antico, which, if anything, is another reflection of increasing attention being paid to interregional scholarship in this century, and it has its own publication, a series of notebooks ('Quaderni') under the appropriate series title 'Mediterr?nea'. The first volume contains an extensive and important discussion of Italian EIA chronology reported on below in the 'Chronology' section. Second, M. Marazzi, known for his work on PH Italy and Sicily, has created a Centra Mediterr?neo Preclassico at the Istituto Suor Orsola Benincasa in Naples, with a publication by the same title that first appeared in 2004. Third, the arrival of Roger Wilson to the University of British Columbia, Vancouver as head of department and Professor of the Archaeology of the Roman Empire, thus becoming the colleague of the present writer, has stimulated the development of the Centre for the Study of Ancient Sicily (CSAS), the only one of its kind in the world outside Sicily (http://cnrs.arts.ubc.ca/CSAS). Its mandate is to promote ancient Sicilian studies and research throughout the world. A new International Phoenician and Punic Studies Association has been founded, as is only to be expected given the rise in Phoenicio-Punic studies over the last generation. The association is based out of the Department of Archaeology at Ghent University and has a very helpful website with news and bibliography regularly posted on it (http://www.ippsa.net/). The creation of this association will do much to aid the growth and development of Phoenicio-Punic studies. Acknowledegments.

I would like to dedicate these reports to Professor Dr Dieter Mertens, who recently retired from the directorship of the DAI Rome. He has been a very supportive and encouraging colleague, ever since we first met when I was a student at the British School at Rome in 1996-1997. His many contributions to Italian and Sicilian archaeology are monuments in themselves, true models for emulation and respect. I wish him all the best. Abbreviations, besides the standard ones used on the inside front cover of this volume, are to be found at the end of this report. GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS Following tradition, this report is divided into two main parts: the first deals with general developments relevant to all or large parts of Sicily, and the second with the regional developments on a site-by-site basis. Discussion of the general developments follows a roughly chronological and cultural order, with the exception of the first two sections which contain more general material relevant to all or large parts of Sicily.

There is an entry on A.D. Trendall in R. Todd (ed.), The Dictionary of British Classicists (Bristol 2004), as well as entries on other figures relevant to anc. Sicily, like A. Blakeway, T.J. Dunbabin, E.A. Freeman, R.P. Knight, and H. Payne. An article on Freeman has also appeared in H.C.G. Matthew and B.H. Harrison (eds), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 20 (Oxford 2004), 920-24 from the pen of F. Barlow. A new dictionary on Cl archaeology contains several entries for scholars who worked on Sicilian material, including J.D. Beazley, W.B. Dinsmoor, P. Orsi, M. Pallottino, D. Randall Maclver and H. Payne (L.M. Medwid, The Makers of Classical Archaeology: A Reference Work [Amherst, NY 2000]). There is small but important round-up of Sicilian</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001 -2005 127 archaeologists based in Palermo in the 19th and 20th Cts by N. Bonacasa (Thalassa 2 [2005], 195-216), who discusses A. Salinas, E. Gabrici, B. Pace, P. Marconi, G. Cultrera, A. Adriani, J. Bove Marconi and V Tusa. Some of these scholars have also been the subject of separate studies. On Salinas as photographer, M.A. Castiglione has an important and insightful piece in QuadMuseoSalinas 5 (1999 [2001]), 33-39. For Pace, see G. Di Stefano (ed.), Scritti giovanili (Comiso 2000), and the personal reflections of A. Giuliano, Xenia Antiqua 10 (2002), 239-43. A. Holm and E. Pais, two other figures closely connected with Palermo, but not considered by Bonacasa in the above-cited article, have also been studied in this reporting period. For Pais, there is the volume edited by L. Polverini, Aspetti della storiografia di Ettore Pais (Rome 2002) (reviewed by F. Canali De Rossi, BMCR 2004.02.38; E. Federico, Incidenza dell'Antico 2 [2004]), and for Holm, G. Uggeri considers his contribution to the study of anc. Sicilian historical geography in RTA/JTA 10 (2000 [2002]), 277-86. A major conference was devoted to Holm as well: 'Cento anni dopo. La figura e Topera di Adolfo Holm. Colloquio dell'Istituto Siciliano per la Storia Antica, 3 maggio, 2000, Palermo.' Proceedings are slated to appear in Kokalos 46 (2000). On R. Koldewey, known in Sicily for his monumental study on Greek temple architecture, there is an article commemo rating his 150th birthday anniversary by O. Matthes, Alter Orient 6 (2005), 15-17. The centenary of the death of T. Mommsen naturally attracted considerable attention. A volume on his connection to Italy appeared as AA.VV, Convegno sul tema Theodor Mommsen e I 'Italia: Roma, 3-4 novembre 2003 (Rome 2004). For Mommsen's thought and handling of anc. sources, see G. Alfoldy, Ephigraphica 66 (2004), 217-45; B. Holtz, JDAI 119 (2004), 307-15; H.-M. von Kaenel et al. (eds), Geldgeschichte vs. Numismatik: Theodor Mommsen und die antike M?nze.

Cucchiara, Kalos 13.4 (2001) 12-17. On L. Savignoni, the first holder of the Chair of Archaeology in Messina, see V La Rosa, Studi De Miro, 439-543. For U. Zanotti Bianco, one of the archaeolo gists who worked with P. Orsi at Sant'Angelo Muxaro, there is a piece by G. Rizza, Magna Grecia (Cosenza) xxxviii.1-4 (2003), 18-21, commemorating the 40th anniversary of his death. R. Bianchi Bandinelli has received a monograph from the pen of M. Barbanera, Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli: biograf?a ed epistolario di un grande archeologo (Milan 2003). A. Brelich, the historian of religion, has had his Introduzione alia storia delle religioni (Rome 2003) reprinted; there has also been a reflection on his scholarly development: A. Carandini, Workshop di Archeologia Classica 2 (2005), 207-25. The Austrian Byzantinist, Herbert Hunger, has been honoured with a volume commemorating 40 years of the institute he founded in Vienna: W. H?randner, J. Koder and M.A. Stassinopoulou (eds), Wiener Byzantinistik und Neogr?zistik (Vienna 2004) (reviewed by F.E. Shlosser, BMCR 2005.05.56). The history of archaeology, on which the foregoing studies of individuals is in part based, continues to receive much attention, as research frameworks and practices are re-assessed (for a statement, published in this period, on the importance of such work, see T. Murray, Antiquity 76 [2002], 234-38). T. Robinson and A. Guidi have published brief histories of Italian PH and Cl archaeology in, respectively, T. Murray (ed.), Encyclopedia of Archaeology (Santa Barbara, CA 1999-2001), 721-32, and P.F. Biehl et al. (eds), Arch?ologien Europas: Geschichte, Methoden und Theorien/Archaeologies of Europe: History, Methods and Theories (M?nster 2002), 353-60. There is a second edition of P.G. Guzzo's Antico e archeologia (Bologna 2004). There is a detailed overview of more than a century of Italian archaeologists using aerial photography by G. Ceraudo, Archeologia Aerea 1 (2004), 47-68. The involvement of women in Italian PH archaeology is investi gated by S.T. Levi (Origini 23 [2001], 191-223). For a history of research in Magna Graecia, whose relationship with Sicily is linked and cannot be overlooked, there is the catalogue of a comprehensive exhibition held in Catanzaro: S. Settis and M.C. Parra (eds), Magna Graecia: archeologica di un sapere (Milan 2005) (for overviews of the exhibition, see S. Settis and G. Pugliese Carratelli, Archeo xxi.6 [2005], 54-65; D. Barbagli and P. Pruneti, ArchViva xxiv.113 [2005], 16-27). For the relationship between nationalism and archaeology, there are two works with frequent reference to Italy and Sicily: R. Etienne (ed.), Les politiques de l'arch?ologie du milieu du XIXe si?cle ? l'or?e du XXF: Colloque organis? par l'?cole Fran?aise d'Ath?nes ? l'occasion de la c?l?bration du 15(f anniversaire de sa fondation (Paris 2000); AA.VV., Antiquit?s, arch?ologie et construction nationale en Italie: journ?es d'?tudes, Rome 29-30 avril 1999 et Ravello 7-8 avril 2000 (published as a special issue of the M?langes de l'?cole fran?aise de Rome: Italie et M?diterran?e 113 [2001], 475 815). On Fascism and archaeology, both in Italy and elsewhere, three monographs worth noting have appeared in recent years: B. N?f (ed.), Antike und Altertumswissenschaft in der Zeit von Faschismus und Nationalsozialismus: Kolloquium Universit?t Z?rich 14.-17. Oktober 1998 (Mandelbachtal 2001); M.L. Galaty and C. Watkinson (eds), Archaeology under Dictatorship (New York 2004); M. Munzi, La decolonizzazione del passato. Archeologia e pol?tica in Libia dalVamminis trazione alleata al regno di Idris (Rome 2004), as well as two articles on, respectively, German archaeology during the Third Reich (M. Maischberger, Antiquity 76 [2002], 209-18) and the relationship between Fascism and PH archaeology in Italy (M. Tarantini, Origini 24 [2002], 7-65). The merging of Cl archaeology and contemporary art in Sicily was exhibited, often with bizarre pieces, all over Sicilian archaeological sites in 2004; a catalogue can be consulted: A. Riva (ed.), Iconica: arte contempor?nea e archaeology in Sicily ?contemporary art and archaeology in Sicily (Milan 2005). The influence of the past continues. The centenaries of the British School at Rome (1901 2001) and of the Belgian Historical Institute in Rome (1902 2002) were celebrated with a handful of articles exploring their history in, respectively, PBSR 69 (2001), 1-96 and Bulletin de l'Institut Historique Belge de Rome/Bulletin van het Belgisch Historisch Instituut te Rome 73 (2003), 1-313. A thumbnail sketch of the history of Dutch archaeology in the Mediterranean is provided by M. Kleibrink, in P. Attema et al. (eds), New Developments in Italian Landscape Archaeology (BAR International Series vol. 1091) (Oxford 2002), 13-17. For the relationship between French politics and anc. Greece after World War II, one can turn to M. Leonard, Athens in Paris: Ancient Greece and the Political in Post-War French Thought (Oxford 2005). One might also cite in this connection E. Gran Aymerich, Dictionnaire biographique d'arch?ologie 1798-1945 (Paris 2001). The early development of German Cl scholarship has been the subject of two volumes published in this period: G.W. Most (ed.), Disciplining Classics Altertumswissenschaft als Beruf (G?ttingQn 2002) (reviewed by</page><page sequence="6">128 FRANCO DE ANGELIS D.t.D. Held, BMCR 2003.07.31), and I. Gildenhard and M. Ruehl (eds), Out of Arcadia: Classics and Politics in the Age of Burckhardt, Nietzsche and Wilamowitz (Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies suppl. vol. 79) (London 2003) (reviewed by H. Lloyd-Jones, BMCR 2004.02.43). The cultural connections between Germany and Sicily (and Italy as a whole) can now be studied in more details thanks to two studies by C. Costanza: Rapporti culturali tra Germania e Sicilia dal sec?lo XIII al XVIII (Messina 2000); Rapporti culturali tra Germania e Sicilia nel sec?lo XIX (Messina 2002). On Swedish archaeology in Sicily, there is a note by P. Pelagatti, Opuscula Romana 27 (2002), 106-08. There continues to be much interest in antiquarians, learned travellers and the development of collections and museums before and after the development of national cultural institutions. A good overview of recent work on an tiqua ri anism can be found in V De Angelis (ed.), Sviluppi recenti nella ricerca antichistica (Quaderni di Acme vol. 54) (Milan 2002). For antiquarianism in a specifically Sicilian context, up to Italian unity, there was an exhibition in Palermo: A. Anselmo et al, Bibliotheca archaeologica: studi antiquari e archeo logici in Sicilia dal Cinquecento alVunit? d'Italia (Palermo 2004). A long investigation on the life and times of V Mirabella has been penned by S. Russo (ArchStorSir 10 [1996 (1997)], 87-112; 11 [1997 (1998)], 13-34). The Colombaria palermitana society is investigated by M. Scalfani (QuadMuseoSalinas 1 [2001 (2003)], 9-32). On the interests and contributions of the Princes Biscari and Torremuzza we have a study by G. Pagnano, Le antichit? del Regno di Sicilia. I plani di Biscari e Torremuzza per la Regia Custodia: 1779 (Palermo 2001), as well as a reprint, introduced by G. Salmeri, of the El 9th work by D. Sestini, II Museo del principe di Biscari (Catania 2001). G. Lo Iacono and C. Marconi have published three more instalments of their work on the archival documents of the activities of the Sicilian Antiquities Commission before the creation of the modern Italian state mentioned in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 148); again, they are supplements of the QuadMuseoSalinas 5 (1999 [2000]), 6 (2000 [2002]) and 8 (2002 [2004]). The origins of Sicilian 'Wunderkammer ' were explored in an exhibition in Palermo, with the following catalogue: V Abbate (ed.), Wunderkammer siciliana. Alle origini del museo perduto (Naples 2001). The birth and early development of Catania's museums are discussed by R. Equizzi (Orizzonti 5 [2004], 127-36), while elsewhere Equizzi joins A. Lapis (QuadMuseoSalinas 6 [2000 (2002)], 73-98) to discuss the 'San Martino delle Scale' collection now part of the Palermo Museum. C. Leonardi (QuadMuseoSalinas 6 [2000 (2002)], 99-117) and S. Bertolino (QuadMuseoSalinas 8 [2002 (2004)], 71-86) also discuss collections (the 'Astuto' and 'Camp?lo' ones) now part of the same museum. K. Korhonen (Arctos 35 [2001], 85-102) has some observations on Sicilian epigraphic collecting. The formation of PH collections in Italy as a whole is explored by R. Skeates, The Collecting of Origins: Collectors and Collections of Italian Prehistory and the Cultural Transformation of Value (1550-1999) (BAR International Series vol. 868) (Oxford 2000). Foreign travellers from the Arabs to 1950 are extensively studied in three volumes by S. Di Matteo, Viaggiatori stranieri in Sicilia dagli Arabi alla seconda meta del XX sec?lo: repetorio, analisi, bibliograf?a (Palermo 1999-2000). That subject was also treated in an exhibition in Paris dealing with Campania, Sardinia and Sicily: A. Mozzillo et al, Les ?diteurs du soleil: la d?couverte de l'Italie par les voyagers ?trangers (Naples 2001). On Italian and foreign travellers in Sicily and their connections with the Sicilian folklorist G. Pitre, there is another hefty study by A. Rigoli, Viaggiatori italiani e stranieri in SiciHa/Giuseppe Pitre (Comiso 2000). Danish involvement in pre- and post-Grand Tour Italy, including Sicily, is explored in several articles in Analecta Romana Instituti Danici 28 (2001). On the Grand Tour itself, there is a general survey from the pen of J. Black, Italy and the Grand Tour (New Haven, CT 2003). On the clothing worn by Sicilians in the time of the Grand Tour, one can refer to AA.VV, Rustico &amp; galante: gli abiti dei siciliani al tempo del Grand Tour (Siracusa 2004). The history of tourism at Taormina, which began in earnest in the Grand Tour, has been studied by G. Restifo, Tourism and the History of Taormina, Sicily, 1750 1950 (Lewiston 2000). G. Fiorentini collects the depictions of Cl monuments and sites by foreign artists in Sicilia Antiqua 1 (2005), 193-218. On J. Houel, there was an exhibition at Siracusa, whose catalogue is by F. Gringeri Pantano, Jean Ho?el Voyage a Siracusa. Le antichit? della citt? e del suo territorio nel 1777 (Palermo 2003). The Italian and English documents relating to the travels of the Englishman R.P. Knight are translated ad studied by A. Ponte, Le paysage des origines:le voyage en Sicile, 1777, de Richard Payne Knight (Besan?on 2000). The travel writings of W. Fleury were translated into Italian from the French by C. Rizzo as Trinacria: passeggiate ed impressioni siciliane (La Spezia 2002). Lesser known 19th-Ct travel writers are discussed by L. Cappugi (QuadMuseoSalinas 5 1999 [2001], 73-83). Individual studies on travellers of this period have also appeared. On W.H. Thompson: I. Corr?ale, La Sicilia di WH Thompson: 1809-1810 (Palermo 2001). On B. Gamba: L. Cerruti and M. Cerrutti (eds), Bartolomeo Gamba: lettere scritte nel mi? viaggio d 'Italia e di Sicilia (Caltanissetta 2003). The writer L. Pirandello's relationship with archaeology was traced in an exhibition: G. Cani, R. D'Affronto and A. Perniciaro (eds), Pirandello e I 'archeologia: mostra documen tar?a (Palermo 2001). Several guidebooks dealing with Sicily in whole or in part have been published during this reporting period. Italy as a whole is the subject of four archaeological guidebooks: M. Denti, L 'archeologia dell 'Italia antica: Greci, Etruschi, Italici e Romani dalla Sicilia alla Valle dAosta (Milan 2001); F. Durando (ed.), Italia antica: viaggio alla scoperta dei capolavori d'arte e dei principali siti archeologici (Vercelli 2001) (in an English edition too); Guida Touring, L'Italia antica: siti, musei e aree archeologiche (Milan 2003); Italy: Past and Present: Rome, Ostia, Sicily, Herculaneum, Pompeii, Hadrian s Villa, Paestum (Rome 2003), the latter consisting of mostly colour illustrations. Sicily is also part of a revised guidebook on southern Italy: Touring Club Italiano, Campania, Puglia, Basilicata, Calabria, Sicilia (Milan 2002). There is one new guidebook on anc. Sicily as a whole: A. Tullio (ed.), hi?eran archeologici in Sicilia (Palermo 2002). The Touring Club Italiano has also produced guidebooks in this period for different parts of Sicily: Enna e provincia (Milan 2001); Palermo e la Conca d'Oro, Agrigento, Siracusa, Catania, Taormina, gli arcipelaghi e le isole (Milan 2002); Trapani e provincia (Milan, 2002). The Palermo Superintendency also has a new series of colourful 'brief guidebooks, each in the four main modern languages, devoted to particular sites and material (the contributions that have appeared so far are discussed below in the section 'Western Sicily'). Two new guidebooks for museums also deserve to be noted. On the museum of the 'Fondazione Mormino': F. Bucchieri et al, Villa Zito Museo d'Arte e Archeologia ?I. Mormino? (Palermo 2002), and on the nearby national museum of Calabria: E. Lattanzi (ed.), // Museo Nazionale di Reggio Calabria (Rome 2003).</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001 -2005 129 NATIVE AND OTHER ITALIC We begin with an update to the two 'watershed' developments noted at the start of this section in the last report (AR [2000 2001], 149). A version of the 'Prima Sicilia' exhibition travelled to Naples in 2001, resulting in another two-volume catalogue: M. Marazzi and S. Tusa (eds), Preistoria: dalle coste della Sicilia alle Isole Flegree. Istituto Suor Orsola Benincasa, Napoli, 5 maggio-3 giugno 2001 (Naples 2001). The proceedings of the 1997 conference on Sicilian pre- and proto history held in Corleone were recently published as special issues of the journal Seminario di Scienze Antropologiche 19 20 (1999-2001) under the editorship of G. Grotta, A. Scuderi, S. Tusa and A. Vintaloro. Interest in native Sicilian studies in PH and protohistory continues (cf. V. Tusa, Atti elimi IV, 1239 46), leading one of the field's leading specialists, E. Procelli, to take stock of the situation in two ways. First, he has produced an immensely useful bibliography: Bibliograf?a della Preistoria e Protostoria della Sicilia e d?lie isole minori (Florence 2005). Second, he has reviewed scholarly develop ments over the last generation (SicArch xxxiii.98 [2000], 49 55), making several important suggestions for the subject to grow and develop in the long term in a healthy way. As in the last report, there are several syntheses and period studies to report. All of Mediterranean PH is dealt with in a thematic manner in E. Blake and A.B. Knapp (eds), The Archaeology of Mediterranean Prehistory (Oxford and Maiden, MA 2005) (reviewed by M. Pluciennik, Antiquity 80 [2006], 472-75). Sicily is found frequently throughout these pages. On the Neo in the central Mediterranean: E. Giannitrapani (SicArch xxxiii.98 [2000], 57-73) and G. Di Stefano, in E. Derwich (ed.), Pr?histoire des pratiques mortuaires (Li?ge 2003), 11-14. On the Serraferlicchio culture in Copper Age Sicily: C. Malone and S. Stoddart (SicArch xxxiii.98 [2000], 97-103). K. Kristiansen and TB. Larsson, The Rise of Bronze Age Society: Travels, Transmissions and Transformations (Cambridge 2005) deals with the BA as a whole across Eurasia, and includes an important introductory chapter on the theory of interaction (reviewed by A. Harding, Antiquity 80 [2006], 463 65). R.M. Albanese Procelli, a leading specialist, studies the Sicilian BA and IA in an excellent new monograph, Sicani, Siculi, Elimi: forme di identit?, modi di contatto e processi di trasformazione (Milan 2003). The second millennium BC in Sicily is the focus of another excellent new monograph by another leading specialist: G. Castellana, La Sicilia nel II millennio a.C. (Caltanissetta 2002). These two books contain discussion of all the major topics, including the many contacts the island had with the outside world. On the EBA, there are several thematic essays on Sicily in D. Cocchi Genick (ed.), L'et? del bronzo recente in Italia (Viareggio-Lucca 2004). A reprinted paperback edition of R. Peroni, L 'Italia alle soglie della storia (Bari 2004) has appeared; the original was cited in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 149). On the Italic cultures of Italy in the 1st millennium BC, there are two helpful synthetic works: M. Antico Gallina (ed.), Culture della prima Italia (Balsamo 2005); F. Pesando (ed.), L 'Italia antica: culture e forme del popolamento nel I millennio a.C. (Rome 2005). There is also a wealth of information in the five volumes dedicated to L. Bernab? Brea (Studi BdABB, Studi ClassiciBB, Studi MemoriaBB, Studi PreistoriciBB, Studi RiunioneBB), some of whose contributions have been cited on their own throughout this report. Interregional contact and exchange are a frequent feature of all the preceding syntheses and period studies, but there are also several studies that address particular aspects of the topic that deserve to be noted (the question of chronology is discussion in the 'Chronology' section below). For contacts between Malta and Sicily: A. Cazzella (SicArch xxxiii.98 [2000], 87-96; Studi Ciasca, 139-52); D.H. Trump, Malta: Prehistory and Temples, 2nd ed. (Valletta 2004); N. Bruno, in R. Laffineur, E. Warmenbo and J. Driessen (eds), Actes du XIV Congr?s UISPP, Universit? de Li?ge, Belgique, 2-8 septembre 2001/Acts oftheXIVth UISPP Congress, University of Li?ge, Belgium, 2-8 September 2001. Section 11: ?ge du bronze en Europe et en M?diterran?e/Section 11: Bronze Age in Europe and the Mediterranean (BAR International Series vol. 1337) (Oxford 2005), 209-216, who argues that BA Sicilian 'pilaster' tombs are not of Maltese inspiration. A.M. Bietti Sestieri (Studi RiunioneBB, 557-86) examines Sicily's geographical and historical role during the 2nd millennium BC, along with the other three large Mediterranean islands (Cyprus, Crete and Sardinia). Sicily is shown to have played a strategic role in establishing relationships and maintaining contacts between the various, usually differentially structured BA polities of the E and W Mediterranean. All four large islands were open to external contacts and often incorporated foreigners into their own local societies, but insofar as Sicily is concerned, it is very unlikely that we are dealing with outright control of the island by outside powers, like the Myc Greeks. Instead, we see intense interconnections which may have resulted in Aegean exchange being based in Sicily, visible perhaps in the material culture, which shows widespread integration of Myc Gr features. Relations between Sicily and Myc Greece are examined in detail in four other works: S. Tusa, SicArch xxxiii.98 (2000), 9 39; M. Bettelli, Italia m?ridionale e mondo miceneo (Florence 2002); E. Borgna and P. Cassola Guida, ASAA 82 (2004 [2006]) 149-80; A. Vianello, Late Bronze Age Mycenaean and Italic Products in the West Mediterranean: A Social and Economic Analysis (BAR International Series vol. 1439) (Oxford 2005). The Myc and E Mediterranean influences that have often been cited in native Sicilian BA settlements should be assessed against scholarly developments in both Sicily and Greece. O. Doonan (Journal of Mediterranean Archaeology 14 [2001], 159-88) re-examines domestic architecture and settlement planning in the EBA and MBA in Sicily, underlining the importance of local conditions. Two studies on BA Gr urbanism and structures have appeared: K. Branigan (ed.), Urbanism in the Aegean Bronze Age (Sheffield 2001); P. Darcque, L'habitat myc?nien. Formes et fonctions de l'espace b?ti en Gr?ce continentale ? la fin du If mill?naire avant J.-C (Athens 2005). There is also an up-to-date treatment on Myc political economy that should be mentioned here: S. Voutsaki and J. Killen (eds), Economy and Politics in the Mycenaean Palace States (Cambridge 2001). In a related discussion, P. Militello {Emporta, 585-97) concludes that private Myc entre preneurship, and not palace control, explains best Myc involvement in the W In another important paper, Bietti Sestieri (PIA VI, 9-24) hypothesizes that the collapse of Italy's core areas in the BA, namely the Palafitte-Terramare and Sicily, led to their replacement by Etruria and Sardinia in the EIA. She regards Etruria as the main political and economic region, with Sardinia as the base for E-W interaction. On the Etruria Sardinia relationship, see in detail O. Paoletti and L. Tamagna Perna (eds), Etruria e Sardegna centro-settentrionale tra Vet? del bronzo finale e Varca?smo (Pisa 2002) (reviewed by J. Macintosh Turfa, BMCR 2004.03.32). Elsewhere Bietti Sestieri argues that Italy took the initiative in maintaining contacts with DA Greece (in B. Cunliffe et al. [eds], Archaeology: The Widening Debate [Oxford 2002], 425-26). This argument needs to be set against a backdrop of increasing research on the Etruscans outside Italy, for which see recently G. Camporeale (ed.), Gli Etruschi fuori d'Etruria (San Giovanni Lupatoto 2001) (English translation: The Etruscans outside Etruria [Los</page><page sequence="8">130 FRANCO DE ANGELIS Angeles 2004], reviewed by V. Jolivet, BMCR 2005.09.14). C. Giardino discusses the insights that PH Sicilian hoards provide for interregional contact and exchange in the W Mediterranean (in C.F.E. Pare [ed.], Metals make the World go round [Oxford 2000], 99-107). One of these W Mediterranean regions was Calabria, whose contacts with Sicily can now be followed in detail in AA.VV, Atti della XXXVII Riunione Scientifica dell Tstituto Italiano di Preistoria e Protostoria della Calabria, 2 vols (Florence 2004). Much of this interregional contact and exchange was stimulated by the search for metals, on which there has been considerable attention in this reporting period. A.M. Bietti Sestieri (Accordia Research Papers 9 [2001-2003], 23-43) gives an overview of her planned catalogue of the 800 copper, bronze and iron artefacts from various collections in The British Museum. She calculates that 40% of these artefacts have accurate contextual information. Sicilian material in this round-up includes five EBA axes from Agrigento. A wealth of information can be found in A. Leho?rff (ed.), L'artisanat m?tallurgique dans les soci?t?s ancienne en M?diterran?e. Techniques, lieux et formes de production (Collection de l'?cole Fran?aise de Rome vol. 332) (Rome 2004), especially the paper by R.M. Albanese Procelli (193-209) on PH bronze working (see also her articles on the same subject in: Atti elimi IV, 11-28; D. Ridgway et al. [eds], Ancient Italy in its Mediterranean Setting: studies in honour of Ellen Macnamara [Accordia Specialist Studies on the Mediterranean vol. 4] [London 2000], 75-90; A. Giumlia-Mair and F. Lo Schiavo [eds], Le probl?me de l'?tain ? l'origine de la m?tallurgie/The Problem of Early Tin [Oxford 2003], 139-45). There are also thoughts on the development of bronze-working in SicArch xxxiii.98 (2000) by D. Marino (145-58) and L. Maniscalco (159-66). The beginnings of iron technology in Italy are considered by Bietti Sestieri and C. Giardino (Mediterranean Archaeology 14 [2001], 125; PIA VI, 491-505) and A. Corretti and M. Benvenuti (Mediterranean Archaeology 14 [2001], 127-45), articles summarizing research which provides the necessary background for Sicilian developments. The latter are discussed by R.M. Albanese Procelli (Studi PreistoriciBB, 241-59), who argues that the introduction of iron appears to have occurred earlier than the arrival of Phoenicians and Greeks in the island, coming from other parts of Italy, and that the permanent settlement of these immigrants in Sicily brought the natives into even greater contact with two more iron producing regions of the anc. Mediterranean, while Giardino, in articles just cited, considers the Aegean as well as Italian possi bilities. There is a most helpful summary of bronze fibulae in S Italy and Sicily, from their origins to the 6th Ct BC, in E. Formigli (ed.), Fibulae: dall'et? del bronzo all'alto medioevo (Florence 2003), 19-39. J. Toms argues, contrary to T. Hodos (OJA 18 [1999], 72-73), that both the long catch-plate and arch fibulae developed in Italy and had nothing to do with the Greeks (in D. Ridgway et al. [eds], Ancient Italy in its Mediterranean Setting: Studies in Honour of Ellen Macnamara [Accordia Specialist Studies on the Mediterranean vol. 4] [London 2000], 91-116). W Sicilian bronze statuettes of the 7th and 6th Cts BC are surveyed by C. Di Stefano (Studi De Miro, 285-92). The types consist of animals and humans, the latter usually making offerings with outstretched hands. Standardization in weights and measures between central Europe, Italy and the Aegean has been noted for the LBA/EIA, something which facilitated the exchange of metals (cf. two articles in E.C. De Sena and H. Dessales [eds], Metodi e approci archeologici: Vindustria e il commercio nell 'Italia antica/Archaeological Methods and Approaches: Industry and Commerce in Ancient Italy [Oxford 2004], 63-79 and 80-88). Other items that circulated across great distances were obsidian and ivory. A study of Italian obsidian using the fission-track method reveals, among other things, that obsidian from Lipari is the most widely distributed and that Pantellarian obsidian is not found in continental Italy (G. Bigazzi and G. Radi, PIA VI, 571-77). Ivory in BA Italian contexts is studied in detail in L. Vagnetti, M. Bettelli and I. Damiani (eds), L'avorio in Italia nell'et? del bronzo (Rome 2005), with papers devoted to Sicilian material by R.M. Albanese Procelli and R. Panvini (this volume began as a session at the conference 'La terra degli elephanti/The World of Elephants' held in Rome in 2001, for which the proceedings by the same title have been published and edited by G. Cavarretta and others). There are several developments to report in other areas too. R. Skeates (Accordia Research Papers 9 [2001-2003], 163 81) reviews new radiocarbon dates from PH Italy, including Sicily. R. Leighton surveys recent development in PH settlement studies, re-evaluating older theories in light of these new data (European Journal of Archaeology 8 [2005], 261-87). Among his conclusions, he observes that the transition from the Copper Age to EBA seems less emphatic than previously thought, and that proximity to the coast in the MBA has been over-emphasized. G. Di Stefano (Studi RiunioneBB, 247-54) collects the evidence for domestic archi tecture in LBA E Sicily, and F. Spatafora (PIA VI, 317-24) considers changes in Ar native settlement space. There is an overview of agriculture in later PH Italy by A.M. Bietti Sestieri, in G. Forni and A. Marcone (eds), Storia dell 'agri cultura (Florence 2002), 205-17. Questions of social structure derive some of their information from such studies on settlement and agriculture, but most of the information comes from necropoleis, which still form the bulk of evidence for the BA and IA. The connection between social structure and necropoleis is explored for Italy as a whole by G. Bartoloni, Le societ? dell'Italia primitiva: lo studio delle necropoli e la nascita delle aristocrazie (Rome 2003). E. Procelli and R.M. Albanese Procelli (Studi RiunioneBB, 323 41) review BA funerary ritual in Sicily, relating changes to shifting attitudes to society, wealth and property. Pilaster and semi-pilaster tombs are the subject of a paper by N. Bruno (Studi RiunioneBB, 1087-91). T. Hodos (PIA VI, 103-08) argues for the need to view native Sicilians as communities, rather than viewing them through the lens of Gr literary sources and anthropological evolutionary terminology. Native Sicily's tendency to one-man rule is examined, with particular reference to Archonides, by S. De Vido (Acme 50 [1997], 7 37) (missed in the last report). The broader picture of social complexity can be followed in detail in A. Guidi, Preistoria della complessit? sociale (Rome 2000). Religion is another area receiving attention. An ongoing project dealing with S Italy can be noted here: G. Mastronuzzi, Repertorio dei contesti cultuali indigent in Italia m?ridionale (Bari 2005-). The first volume deals with the Ar period. Religion in EBA Sicily has two studies in this period: R. Belluardo and G. Ciavorella, SicArch xxxii.97 (1999 [2001]), 147-64; M. Cultraro, PIA VI, 588-95. On pottery, there are three studies to report. C. Antonaccio (Studies Shefton, 55-81) rightly observes, among other things, that the study of native Sicilian pottery is usually overlooked in favor of Gr wares, and that using the usual label 'Sikel' to describe Siculo-Geometric pottery allows for no variation. Antonaccio hypothesizes that Morgantina's 'Sikel' wares were not made at the site, probably coming from Marianopoli and from 'Elymian' W Sicily. C. Trombi (Studi De Miro, 693-710) surveys plastic applications on pots of the</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001-2005 131 7th to 5th Ct BC, and S. Vassallo (SicArch xxxii.97 [1999 (2001)], 147-164) publishes a drawing of a native figured krater. E. Caltagirone, La lingua dei Siculi. Un mistero finalmente svelato (Barzago 2003) claims that the Sikel language derives from Sanskrit. Greek-native relations are the focus of a number of studies published in this period. Sicily is mentioned in passing in works by G.F. Chiai, RSF 30 (2002), 125-46 (who sees the very toponyms of Sardinia and Sicily as embodying pacific co existence between the various cultural groups resident there); F. D'Andria, in P. Attema et al (eds), New Developments in Italian Landscape Archaeology (BAR International Series vol. 1091) (Oxford, 2002), 52-59; E.M. De Juliis, Greci edltalici in Magna Grecia (Bari 2004). Burials with headless bodies or just crania in Gr cemeteries are studied by L. Mercuri (MEFRA 113 [2001], 7-31) and G. Shepherd (OJA 24 [2005], 115-36), who arrive, respectively, at the conclusion that they represent and do not represent native elements amongst their population. The question of integration is examined further in three other studies: J.L. Men?ndez V?rela (The Ancient History Bulletin 11.1-4 [2003], 48-84) focuses on the territorial development of the W Gr poleis vis-?-vis the natives, seeing incorporation of the latter as equals in cities and as slaves in rural settlements; F. De Angelis (AWE 2 [2003], 19-50) moves beyond such more traditional lines, arguing for the impact of Sicily's natives on Gr town planning, political structures, religious ritual and agriculture; and P. Anello, in M.G. Angeli Bertinelli and A. Donati (eds), II cittadino, lo straniero, il b?rbaro, fra integrazione ed emargin azione nell'antichit? (Rome 2005), 143-76, distinguishes three phases of relations from the 8th to 4th Ct BC: friendly relations at the time of foundation, followed by hostilities as the Gr city states developed and concluding with assimilation. R.M. Albanese Procelli (PIA VI, 358-66) picks up the latter topic in her study of the development of native Sicilian food culture in later PH and Ar times as a result of contact with Greeks and Phoenicians. She investigates systems of cooking, preparation and storage, noting both continuity and change over previous practices. In Atti elimi TV, there are four articles that can be noted here: P. Anello (37-56), drawing on various sources, argues for a distinct Elymian ethnos in the 5th Ct BC; M. Moggi (973-86) explores the evolution of Campanian mercenaries into citizens; U. Fantasia (467-95) rightly draws attention to the ethnic realities of Sicily noted by Plato in his VIIIth letter; and R. Sammartano (1115-48) and G. Camassa (127-34) look at the Elymians' Trojan connection, noting, respectively, that the use of this legend in Sicily must predate Athenian interest in the island in the 5th Ct BC and that it was used for defining the other (on the uses of Troy, see also A. Erskine, Troy between Greece and Rome: Local Tradition and Imperial Power [Oxford 2001]; D.P. Thompson, The Trojan War: Literature and Legends from the Bronze Age to the Present [Jefferson, NC 2003], reviewed by D.M. Pollio, BMCR 2004.04.38). PHOENICIO-PUNIC AND NEAR EASTERN The bibliography under this heading continues to grow by leaps and bounds. The two new journals and scholarly association devoted specifically to Phoenicio-Punic studies mentioned in the introduction are a reflection of this, as are the numerous bibliographic round-ups and scholarly surveys that have appeared. The single largest of these is the CD-ROM by E. Acquaro (ed.), Bibliotheca phoenicia: dodicimila titoli sulla civilt? fenicia (La Spezia, 2000). Annual bibliographie surveys are also still being produced by the new editors of RSP; so far they have been published in volumes 29 (2001), 245-87; 30 (2002), 237-74; 31 (2003), 177-98. Recent trends in Phoenicio-Punic studies in Sicily can be found in an article by S.F. Bondi, in P. Donati Giacomini and M.L. Uberti (eds), Fra Cartagine e Roma: seminario di studi italo-tunisino, Bologna, 23febbraio 2001 (Faenza 2002) 87-94. P. Bartoloni (Sardinia, Corsica et Baleares Antiquae 1 [2003], 123-30) provides a brief history of the work carried out by the recently merged Centro di Studio per la Civilt? Fenicia e P?nica (see introduc tion) in the islands of Italy, including in Sicily. Of the works of synthesis, we may begin by noting that a second edition of M.E. Aubet, The Phoenicians and the West: Politics, Colonies, and Trade (Cambridge 2001) has appeared (reviews by: L. Casson, UNA 31 [2002], 302-03; R. Wright, BMCR 2003.12.17). There are also several new syntheses to report: P.K. Hitti, History of Syria: Including Lebanon and Palestine I (Piscataway, NJ 2002-); M. Heinz, Altsyrien und Libanon. Geschichte, Wirtschaft und Kultur vom Neolithikum bis Nebukadnezar (Darmstadt 2002); E. Acquaro, I Fenicifra Oriente e Occidente (Cinisello Balsamo 2003) (cf. also E. Acquaro, Studi De Miro, 21-36; ArchViva xxiv.109 [2005], 18-33); J.A. Zamora (ed.), El hombre fenicio: estudios y materiales (Rome 2003); M.N. Santangelo, Le berceau des Ph?niciens (Leuven 2004). The growing interest in the Phoenicians is connected in part to their uses for identity purposes. On this, see B. Garnand, Stanford Journal of Archaeology 1 (2002) (http://archaeology.stanford.edu/journal/ newdraft/garnand/index.html); A. Kaufman, Reviving Phoenicia: The Search for Identity in Lebanon (London 2004). We can also note here the publication the proceedings from the of 4th and 5th international conferences on Phoenicio-Punic studies: M.E. Aubet and M. Barth?l?my (eds), Actas del IV Congreso Internacional de Estudios Fenicios y P?nicos: C?diz, 2 al 6 de Octubre de 1995, 4 vols (C?diz 2000); A. Span? Giammellaro (ed.), Atti del V Congresso Internazionale di Studi Fenici e Punid, Marsala-Palermo, 2-8 ottobre 2000, 3 vols (Palermo 2005). Phoenician navigation and exploration are, naturally, topics that have attracted attention in this reporting period: E. Lipinski, Itineraria phoenicia (Leuven 2004); V. Pe?a. CG. Wagner and A. Mederos (eds), La navegaci?n fenicia: tecnolog?a naval y derroteros (Madrid 2004). So much of this navigation and exploration was conducted for purposes of trade and exchange, on which many new studies have been published. Despite its title, the volume edited by P. Fern?ndez Uriel, C. Gonz?lez and F. L?pez, Intercambio y comercio precl?sico en el Mediterr?neo (Madrid 2000) is entirely dedicated to a Phoenicio-Punic theme. There are also three papers in R. Rollinger and C. Ulf (eds), Commerce and Monetary Systems in the Ancient World (Stuttgart 2004): K. Radner (152-69) on Assyrian trade policy; M. Sommer (233 44) on the world system of the EIA; and H.G. Niemeyer (245 56) on the Phoenicians' role in creating a 'multi-national' Mediterranean (cf. also Niemeyer's piece on the Phoenician contribution to anc. globalization, in K.J. Hopt et al. [eds], Herausforderungen der Globalisierung [G?ttingen 2003], 47 55). One of these three authors, M. Sommer, has examined his theme in more detail in Die Ph?nizier. Handelsherren zwischen Orient und Okzident (Stuttgart 2005). M.L. Zimmerman Munn discusses the evidence for Punic finds in Corinth and concludes that the trade in salt-fish from Gades in the M5th Ct BC may have been the result of direct long-distance trade between the regions in possibly Gr hands (in C.K. Williams II and N. Bookidis [eds], Corinth: The Centenary 1896-1996 [Princeton 2003], 195-217). In doing so, she adds a dissenting voice to the idea that a Carthaginian trade blockade existed in the central Mediterranean, and that Sicily, as a result, would have been the middleman in this trade.</page><page sequence="10">132 FRANCO DE ANGELIS The cultural contact and change that resulted from trade and exchange are tackled for the far west in B. Costa and J.H. Fern?ndez (eds), Colonialismo e interacci?n cultural (Eivissa 2004). The topic more generally is surveyed by S.F. Bondi, in S.F. Bondi and M. Vallozza (eds), Greci, Fenici, Romani: interazioni culturali nel Mediterr?neo antico (Viterbo 2005), 17-26, who observes that the Hellenization of Phoenicio-Punic culture was the deepest in Sicily in all of the Phoenicio-Punic world, and that there were also Greeks living and worshipping in Phoenicio-Punic settlements. For Gr influences on Punic culture, see also V Tusa (Studi De Miro, 711-19). Elsewhere Bondi looks at native-Phoenician relations in Sicily, arguing that the evidence from Motya suggests that natives could have been socially and economically subordinate, employed as labourers (in P. Negri Scafa and P. Gentili [eds], Donum Natalicium. Studi presentati a Claudio Saporetti in occasione delsuo 60? compleanno [Rome 2000], 37-43). K.A. Raaflaub considers the possible impact of Phoenician state formation on Gr state formation, concluding that there was not any per se (in R. Rollinger and C. Ulf [eds], Griechische Archaik. Interne Entwicklungen-Externe Impulse [Innsbruck 2004], 271-89). On the transmission of iconography, see E. Acquaro and P. Callieri (eds), Transmarinae imagines. Studi sulla transmis sione di iconograf?a tra Mediterr?neo edAsia in et? classica ed ellenistica (La Spezia 2003). On the Phoenician language, we can avail ourselves of three works by C.R. Krahmalkov: Phoenician-Punic Dictionary (Leuven 2000) (reviews by: K. Jongeling and R. Kerr, Orientalia 71.2 [2002], 173-81; P. Mosca, BASOR 329 [2003], 90-92); A Phoenician-Punic Grammar (Leiden 2001); an overview piece in J. Kaltner and S.L. McKenzie (eds), Beyond Babel: A Handbook for Biblical Hebrew and Related Languages (Atlanta 2002), 207-41. The multi-lingual landscape of N Africa can be read about in Antiquit?s Africaines 38-39 (2002-2003), the result of a one-day colloquium held in Paris in 2001. In the sphere of epigraphy, there is G. Pisano and A. Travaglini, Le iscrizioni fenicie e puniche dipinte (Rome 2003) to note. Much work has been done on matters related to environment and economy. These subjects are discussed in detail in C. G?mez Bellard (ed.), Ecohistoria del paisaje agrario. La agricultura fenicio-p?nica en el Mediterr?neo (Valencia 2003), though, interestingly, none of the contribu tions is devoted to Sicily. Food derived from land and sea is the subject of a fascinating paper by A. Giammellaro Span? (Kokalos 46 [2000 (2005)], 417-64), who bases her account on literary and archaeological sources and includes food preparation and presentation. Preparation and consumption are also the themes of L. Campanella and A.M. Niveau de Villedary y Marinas' treatment of fish in the Phoenicio-Punic world in S.F. Bondi and M. Vallozza (eds), Greci, Fenici, Romani: interazioni culturali nel Mediterr?neo antico (Viterbo 2005), 27-67. The role of salt in Phoenicio-Punic life is examined by P. Bartoloni, in L 'industria del sale marino in Sicilia (Trapani 1997) (missed in the last report). On metallurgy, two papers consider early iron technology at Carthage and other Phoenician settlements: H.G. Niemeyer, Mediterranean Archaeology 14 (2001), 83-93; I. Keesman, Mediterranean Archaeology 14 (2001), 95-108. There are some thoughts on Punic everyday life in A. H?bner, OJA 24 (2005), 137-42. There are developments to report for other aspects of material culture. For architecture, an important overview can be found in F. Prados Mart?nez, Introducci?n al estudio de la arquitectura p?nica (Madrid 2003). The latter includes discussion of construction techniques, which is also the subject of an article by F. Verga, Byrsa 1 (2003), 129-60. Whether every tophet was accompanied by a temple is examined by S. Ribichini (Studi Ciasca, 425-39), who concludes that the data are not sufficient to support the idea that temples are always found in tophets. He notes, however, that when a temple is found in a tophet, it was usually constructed after the tophet's appearance, and that the destruction and abandonment of these tophet temples did not impact the tophet's functioning. There were two Sicilian contributions to a Spanish seminar on Phoenicio-Punic necropoleis: A. Gonzalez Prats (ed.), El mundo funerario. Actas del III Seminario Internacional sobre Temas Fenicios (Alicante 2004). In the first, A. Giammellaro Span? (205-51) sums up the evidence, while in the second R. Di Salvo (253-65) sums up the available palaeodemography. Some of the same themes addressed in this volume on necropoleis are discussed and expanded in another volume: A. Gonz?lez Blanco, G. Manila Seiquer and A. Egea (eds), El mundo p?nico. Religi?n, antropolog?a y cultura material (Murcia 2004). Stelae in The British Museum are published by C. Mendleson, Catalogue of the Punic Stelae in The British Museum (London 2003). On anthropoid sarcophagi, there is the important study in two volumes by S. Frede, Die ph?nizis chen anthropoiden Sarkophage (Mainz am Rhein 2000), who has an article in another, more general volume on sculpture and votive monuments: R. Bol and D. Krekenbom (eds), Sepulkral und Votivdenkm?ler ?stlicher Mittelmeergebiete (7. Jh. v. Chr 1. Jh. n. Chr.): Kulturbegegnungen im Spannungsfeld von Akzeptanz und Resistenz (M?ohnesee 2004), which contains contributions on Sicilian and Carthaginian material, as well as on religion. On the latter subject, we might also note here the following works: T.N.D. Mettinger, The Riddle of Resurrection: Dying and Rising Gods in the Ancient Near East (Stockholm 2001) (reviewed by D. Frankfurter, BMCR 2002.09.07). Discussed in this work is, among others, Melqart, on whose iconography, see F. Pinnock (Studi Ciasca, 379-89). Altars in W Sicilian sanctuaries are studied by F. Spagnoli, SicArch xxxvi.101 (2003), 169-90. On scarabs, there is J. Boardman, Classical Phoenician Scarabs: A Catalogue and Study (BAR International Series vol. 1190) (Oxford 2003). On related topics, H.G. Niemeyer (Studi Ciasca, 361-IS) wonders whether the Aegyptiaca found in the Mediterranean were Phoenician trade goods, and R. Fletcher (AWE 3 [2004], 51-77) examines Egyptianising amulets across the Mediterranean. Ostrich eggs are the subject of a paper by G. Pisano (Studi Ciasca, 391-401). On pottery, note N. Schreiber, The Cypro-Phoenician Pottery of the Iron Age (Leiden 2003) (reviewed by M. Iacouvou, BASOR 336 [2004], 61-66), as well as the attempt to distinguish, via archaeometry, the ceramic productions of Motya from those of Solunto (R. Alaimo et al., in V. Kilikoglou, A. Hein and Y. Maniatis [eds], Modern Trends in Scientific Studies on Ancient Ceramics [BAR International Series vol. 1011] [Oxford 2002], 207-18; Atti elimi IV, 1-9). Phoenician and Punic amphorae in the Mediterranean basin and beyond are discussed throughout J. Eiring and J. Lund (eds), Transport Amphorae and Trade in the Eastern Mediterranean (Aarhus 2004) (reviewed by R.F. Docter, BMCR 2006.02.44). Punic amphorae in the underwater collection of the Palermo Museum are collected by G. Sara (QuadMuseoSalinas 5 [1999 (2001)], 85-8), who observes that the finds are sporadic and without context. On coins, a third volume has appeared of E. Acquaro (ed.), Monete puniche nelle collezioni italiane: Napoli, Museo Archeologico Nazionale (Rome 2002). A review of Phoenician and Punic coins on the internet suggests to L.-I. Manfredi, Archeologia e Calcolatori 16 (2005), 41-58, the need for an</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001-2005 133 integrated system of recording. A. Cutroni Tusa (AUN 41 [2000 (2002)], 249-265) reviews Punic coinage in Sicily and elsewhere (SicArch xxxiv.99 [2001], 183-189) considers the hoard IGCH 2119 as evidence for the first Carthaginian mint in Sicily. Three further studies on Punic coins can be noted: astral symbols (A. Cutroni Tusa, Studi Isler, 75-82); legends (L. Mildenberg, Studi Isler, 303-14); crab symbols (L.-I. Manfredi, Studi Ciasca, 323-36). We should also mention here CA. Di Stefano 's (Due Dionisi, 81-91) review of the foregoing kinds of material culture from the main Punic sites in W Sicily in the time of Dionysius I?II. Some developments regarding Carthage must also be noted, given the inseparability ofthat city from Sicily. We must begin with an important exhibition held in Karlsruhe, whose catalogue has appeared as S. Peters (ed.), Hannibal ad portas: Macht und Reichtum Karthagos (Stuttgart 2004) (for a Synopsis, see K. Hattler, Minerva 15.6 [2004], 18-21). An overview of recent excavations bearing on Carthage's Ar topography is provided by R.F. Docter (Talanta 24-25 [2002 2003], 113-33). Parallels between the houses of Carthage and Megara Hyblaia are noted by M. Gras, in C. M?ller and F. Prost (eds), Identit?s et cultures dans le monde m?diterran?en antique en l'honneur de Francis Croissant (Paris 2002), 183? 198. In a related vein, B. Tang explores houses in three trading centres, including Carthage, in Delos, Carthage, Ampurias: The Housing of Three Mediterranean Trading Centres (Analecta Romana Instituti Danici suppl. vol. 36) (Rome 2005). On the tophet: H. B?nichou-Safar, Le tophet de Salammb? ? Carthage: essai de reconstitution (Collection de l'Ecole Fran?aise de Rome vol. 342) (Rome 2004). The structure of Carthaginian adminstration may be read in L.-I. Manfredi, La pol?tica amministrativa di Cartagine in Africa (Atti della Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Classe di Scienze Morali, Storiche e Filologiche, Memorie vol. 16.3) (Rome 2003). S.F. Bondi (Daidalos 3 [2001], 27-35) and S. Cataldi (Atti elimi IV, 217-52) sum up what we know of Carthage's involvement in ?and control of Sicily, and, in a similar way, M.H. Fantar (Studi Ciasca, 227-37) rounds up Carthage's relationships with Greeks from Dorieus to Hel/Rom times. On Carthaginian mercenaries, A.C. Fariselli has produced a work with much food for thought: / mercenari di Cartagine (La Spezia 2002). On a related topic, A. Cutroni Tusa (Atti elimi IV, 355-365) reconsiders the coin evidence for Sardinian mercenaries in Sicily, concluding that their presence in the island is possible. The Carthaginian navy is the focus of a monograph by S. Medas, La mariner?a cartaginese. Le navi, gli uomini, la navigazione (Sassari 2000), while for Carthaginian trade with the 'Far West' of the Mediterranean there is an article by J.L. L?pez Castro (Rivista di Studi Punid 1 [2000], 123-44). D. Hoyos devotes a monograph to Hannibal: Hannibal's Dynasty: Power and Politics in the Western Mediterranean, 247-183 BC (Oxford 2003). Three developments regarding the Phoenicio-Punic presence on nearby Malta should also be noted: C. Sagona, The Archaeology of Punic Malta (Leuven 2002) (reviewed by: A. Termini, AWE 4 [2005], 503-06); N.C. Vella, Ancient Near Eastern Studies 39 (2002), 83-112 (on Ptolemy's Temple of Hercules); A. Bonanno, Malta: Phoenician, Punic and Roman (Valletta 2005). As is well known, anc. Sicily also had connections with other Near Eastern peoples, not just the Phoenicians. Two general works of relevance can be noted first: M.

GREEK There are some general developments in art and archaeology that can be noted first. Although not systematically dealing with the Gr world beyond Greece, there is much relevant food for thought in R. Osborne's survey of recent work (AJA 108 [2004], 87-102). The same goes for the following four works which at times discuss Sicily directly or developments related to it: J. Whitley, The Archaeology of Ancient Greece (Cambridge 2001) (reviews by: P.D. Scotton, BMCR 2002.09.41; D.W. Rupp, Mouseion 1 [2002], 263-68; J.M. Hall, Classical Philology 98 [2003], 290-96; C. Smith, Classical Review 53 [2003], 211-13); J.G. Pedley, Greek Art and Archaeology, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ 2002); M. Belozerskaya and K. Lapatin, Ancient Greece: Art, Architecture and History (Los Angeles 2004) (reviewed by F. Greenland, BMCR 2004.12.01); L. Burn, Hellenistic Art from Alexander the Great to Augustus (Los Angeles 2005) (reviewed by C. Gorrie, BMCR 2005.07.40). The art and archaeology of the W Greeks is treated in two recent works: F. Bourbon and F. Durando, Magna Graecia. Kunst und Kultur der Griechen in Italien (Munich 2004); L. Cerehiai, L. Jannelli and F. Longo, Citt? greche della Magna Grecia e Sicilia (Venice 2002) (the English translation of 2004 is reviewed by J.A. Evans, BMCR 2005.04.56). See also more generally: G. Francesio, E. Russo and M. Minnella, Sicilia: storia e arte (Venice 2002); M. Oppenheimer, The Monuments of Italy: A Regional Survey of Art, Architecture and Archaeology from Classical to Modern Times (London 2002), especially volume five (199-266) with a long section on Sicily. The amount of 'Classical' in Sicilian art and archaeology is investigated by N. Bonacasa in his contri bution to the German exhibition on Die griechsiche Klassik. Idee oder Wirklicheit (catalogue published in Mainz am Rhein in 2002). Architecture and urbanism. There are two handy reviews of studies on W Gr urbanism dealt with in the previous report by E. Greco (AION 4 [1997 (2000)], 207-20; 7 [2000 (2001)], 223-33). Mediterranean urbanization as a whole is the subject of two volumes with frequent mention of Sicily: C. Gates, Ancient Cities: The Archaeology of Urban Life in the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece and Rome</page><page sequence="12">134 FRANCO DE ANGELIS (London 2003); R. Osborne and B. Cunliffe (eds), Mediterranean Urbanization 800-600 BC (Proceedings of the British Academy vol. 126) (Oxford 2005). These are important contributions to comparative perspectives, which place Gr developments in a larger context, something which has traditionally not been done. In this light can E. Greco's exploration of tradition and innovation in Ar Gr urbanism be read (Ag?is und Mittelmeer, 13-21), as well as a general treatment of the Gr city which often discusses Sicily: P. Morachiello, La citt? greca (Bari 2003). An exhibition rounding up recent results in Sicilian Gr urbanism was held in Agrigento in this reporting period (on the exhibition, see Archeo xxi.3 [2005], 14). The published catalogue has appeared as Urban?stica e architettura nella Sicilia greca, edited by P. Mina (Palermo 2005), whose contents are mostly made up a short scholarly articles. The origins of town planning are investigated in detail by J.L. Men?dez V?rela, Consideraciones acerca del origen y la naturaleza de la ciudad planificada en las colonias griegas de Occidente (BAR International Series vol. 1104) (Oxford 2003) (reviewed by A.M. Jim?nez Flores, Habis 35 [2004], 467-70). Men?dez V?rela argues that Hippodamus'/7orw/? is to be placed ca 470 460 BC, and that he may have been the first theorizer of town planning, but not its inventor, who must be sought in the early W Gr developments. These are hardly novel conclusions. On similar subjects, one can also cite here a long article by G. Shipley, in M.H. Hansen (ed.), The Imaginary Polis (Acts of the Copenhagen Polis Centre vol. 7) (Copenhagen 2005), 335-403, who argues, among other things, that there is no single town planning typology, and that egalitarian values cannot be read into Ar town planning. On the development of the agora, there is a summary (in Ag?is und Mittelmeer, 23 28) of U. Kenzler's book on the early development of the agora that was cited in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 152). F. Cordano examines 'republican' and 'tyrannical' foundations in Sicily in the 5th Ct BC in M. Redd? et al. (eds), La naissance de la ville dans l'antiquit?. De l'arch?ologie ? l'histoire (Paris 2003), 121-25, while A. Di Vita surveys Sicilian urbanism in the 4th Ct BC (Due Dionisi, 139-46) and overall in Greek Archaeology without Frontiers (Athens 2002), 209-20. Fortifications of the Cl period in the Gr W are the subject of a paper (missed in the last report) by one of the leading specialists: H. Tr?ziny, Pallas 51 (1999), 241-82. Urbanism and structures in the PH and Ar Greek world were the focus of a round table held in Toulouse in 2001, whose proceedings have been published as a special issue of the journal Pallas 58 (2002) edited by J.-M. Luce with the title Habitat et urbanism dans le monde grec de la fin des palais myc?niens ? la prise de Milet (494 av. J.-C). There is much of relevance here, especially the contribution by H. Tr?ziny on pages 267-82, who argues that some Gr town plans with multiple orientations in E Sicily must have followed pre existing circulation routes and other independent criteria. The transition from huts to houses in anc. Italy and Greece was discussed in a seminar in Rome, whose proceedings have been published in this period: J.R. Brandt and L. Karlsson (eds), From Huts to Houses: Transformations of Ancient Societies (Stockholm 2001). Gr houses have received attention that deserves to be noted: S. Rougier-Blanc, Les maisons hom?riques. Vocabulaire architectural et s?mantique du b?ti (Paris 2005); B.A. Ault and L.C. Nevett (eds), Ancient Greek Houses and Households: Chronological, Regional and Social Diversity (Philadelphia 2005) (reviewed by R. Westgate, BMCR 2006.03.35). T. Schattner discusses house models in B. Muller (ed.), ?Maquettes architecturales? de l'Antiquit? (Paris 2001), 161-209 and observes that, where the context of these finds in known, the models were mainly dedicated in chthonic sanctuaries or in votive deposits close by. Temples make up the bulk of the discussion contained in the two-volume work by M.-C. Hellmann, L'architecture grecque (Paris 2002-2006). On the origins of the Gr architectural orders, there is a monograph by B.A. Barletta, The Origins of the Greek Architectural Orders (Cambridge 2001), which devotes consid erable attention to W Gr material (reviews by: R.F. Townsend, BMCR 2002.08.30; R. Tomlinson, AWE 4 [2005], 182-83). Elsewhere, Barletta (?g?is und Mittelmeer, 203-16) returns to the question of Ionic influence in W Gr architecture; and on Ionians abroad more generally (including craftsmen), there are two other contributions in ?g?is und Mittelmeer to note (by A. Faustoferri and G. Tsetskhladze on, respectively, 315-24 and 521-24). A study on the orientation of W Gr temples reveals a slight impact by Italic cultures (A.F. Aveni and G. Romano, Archaeoastronomy 25 [2000], 51-57; Rivista di Archeologia 24 [2000], 15-22). Decoration on W Gr temples is examined in three lengthy articles by P. Danner (R?mische Historische Mitteilungen 42 [2000], 19-105; 43 [2001], 17-144; 44 [2002], 19-102). The first of these studies treats gorgoneia, which Danner observes were common in Sicily starting in the 6th Ct BC, but not in the Gr homeland. The second study looks at frontal decoration on funerary monuments and on models, and the conclusion is drawn that they reflect only in part what is going on in the decoration of monumental architecture. The third study investigates mythological scenes, figured and non figured decoration in W Gr monumental architecture, and one of its conclusions is that the mythological scenes mirror homeland Gr examples, while the figured and non-figured decoration derive inspiration from independent W Gr models. Sicilian temple architecture of the 4th and 3rd Cts BC is the subject of an article by I. Correa Morales (NAC29 [2000], 191 234), who concludes that, following a period of 'stagnation', Hieron II sought to turn a new leaf by latching on to the island's Ar architectural traditions, resulting in novel combinations and developments. Correa Morales hypothesizes that this was an attempt by Hieron II to set himself apart from Timoleon's democratic reforms. There has also been much attention to theatres in this period. Sicilian theatres are discussed in two general and two specific works: P. Ciancio Rossetto and G. Pisani Sartorio, Memoria del teatro. Censimento dei teatri antichi greci e romani (Rome 2002); P. Ciancio Rossetto and G. Pisani Sartorio, Memoria del teatro. Teatri antichi di Sicilia (Rome 2002); L. Todisco, Teatro e spettacolo in Magna Grecia e in Sicilia: testi, immagini, architettura (Milan 2002); D. Susanetti, // teatro dei greci: feste e spettacoli, eroi e buffoni (Rome 2003). The first three of these works are reviewed by G. Calcani, ArchClass 54 (2003), 497-501. L. Gallo (Atti elimi IV, 537-48) has some thoughts of the political uses of anc. theatres in Sicily, and, on a related topic, H.P. Isler (Studi De Miro, 429-33) collects the evidence, both written and archaeo logical, for bouleuteria in Sicily, noting that they appear partic ularly in two crucial constitutional moments which favoured local autonomy, namely the period of Timoleon and the Romans following the lex Rupilia. Chronology. The rekindled interest in chronology mentioned in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 153) has developed into a steady flame in this period. A broad reflection of this growing interest can be seen in the general treatments of chronology: B. B?bler, Arch?ologie und Chronologie. Eine Einf?hrung (Darmstadt 2004); R.M. Rosen (ed.), Time and Temporality in the Ancient World (Philadelphia 2004), which includes contributions on Hesiod and the Gr Chronographie traditions relating to the first Olympic games; R. Hannah, Greek and Roman Calendars: Constructions of Time in the Classical</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001 -2005 13 5 World (London 2005) (reviewed by A.-M. Lewis, BMCR 2005.10.04). The Austrian-led research programme on 'Synchronisation of Civilisations in the Eastern Mediterranean' (SCIEM) in the BA, whose implications go well beyond this region in antiquity, has produced five substantial volumes of edited proceedings: M. Bietak (ed.), The Synchronisation of Civilisations in the Eastern Mediterranean in the Second Millennium B.C. I?II (Vienna 2000 and 2003); M. Bietak (ed.), The Middle Bronze Age in the Levant (Vienna 2002); S. Deger Jalkotzy and M. Zavadil (eds), LH IIIC Chronology and Synchronisms (Vienna 2003); M. Bietak and E. Czerny (eds), Scarabs of the Second Millennium BCfrom Egypt, Nubia, Crete and the Levant (Vienna 2004). Synchronisms between Italy and the Aegean in the later BA are explored by R. Jung (Emporta, 473-84), who produces a valuable table relating the different chronological systems. EIA chronology has also received considerable attention. In the E Mediterranean, the Levant and Anatolia have naturally been a centre of attention; a good overview of these discussions, citing all the relevant bibliog raphy, can be found in G.R. Tsetskhladze's review of the state of play of Gr 'colonization' (in G.R. Tsetskhladze [ed.], Greek Colonisation: An Account of Greek Colonies and Other Settlements Overseas [Leiden 2006], xxxi-xxxviii): overall the trend for those challenging present chronological schemes has been to raise dates by one or two generations, to which there has been resistance in some quarters. What is happening chronology-wise in the E Mediterranean must, of necessity, be taken on board in studies on the rest of the anc. world, and it is not surprising that the new Istituto di Studi sulle Civilt? Italiche e del Mediterr?neo Antico discussed earlier has dedicated its first publication to Italian IA chronology: G. Bartoloni and F. Delpino (eds), Oriente e Occidente: metodi e discipline a confronto. Riflessioni sulla cronolog?a dell'et? del ferro in Italia. Atti dell'incontro di studi, Roma, 30-31 ottobre 2003 (Pisa 2005) (reviewed in depth by J. Macintosh Turfa, BMCR 2006.08.10). Among the many contributions, we may note here R.M. Albanese Procelli's (517-25) review of the state of play in Sicily, and the revisions to EGr pottery chronology by A.J. Nijboer (527-56; cf. also by the same author, AWE 4 [2005], 255-77). Nijboer begins by reviewing the foundations on which the absolute chronology currently rests, pointing out that it encapsulates a 'a veni, vidi, vici process of colonisation' which can no longer stand and that we need to lengthen the pre-colonial trading phase. He suggests raising the absolute chronology of Geo and EProtoCor as follows: EGeo = 925 BC - 875 BC; MGeo 900/875 BC - 825/800 BC; LGeo 825 BC - 750/700 BC; EProtoCor 750/740 BC - 700/675 BC. K. De Vries' review of Cor pottery from Corinth and the Gr W causes him, among other things, to doubt that Pithekoussai was founded much, if at all, before the other Gr settlements in the 730s BC (in C.K. Williams II and N. Bookidis [eds], Corinth: The Centenary 1896-1996 [Princeton 2003], 141-56). The Ar chronology found in mainly Herodotus and Thucydides is helpfully reviewed by R. Bichler in R. Rollinger and C. Ulf (eds), Griechische Archaik. Interne Entwicklungen-Externe Impulse (Innsbruck 2004) 207-48, who notes the penchant of these authors for synchronisms and their avoidance of absolute dates. Demography. Two extensive reviews of Sicilian population history have appeared in this period: M.J. Becker, Rivista di Antropolog?a (Rome) 80 (2002), 1-120; M. Rubini and S. Mogliazza, Storia delle popolazioni italiane dal neol?tico a oggi. I nuovi orientamenti dell 'antropolog?a (Rome 2005). Both these reviews stress that great potential exists to develop such studies, something which becomes evident in G. Kron's review of the anthropom?trie data from Italy (Historia 54 [2005], 68-83), where Sicilian data are few. As in the previous two reviews, Kron also argues for greater attention to the skeletal material in order to test and fill out his conclusion that the overall standard of nutrition in Graeco-Rom antiquity often exceeded that of the 18th and El9th centuries AD. Two topics related to the latter have received publication in this period: a 'short' history of pygmies in Greece and Italy (M. Harari, Studies Shefton, 163-90) and the question of old age in antiquity (see T. Parkin in P. Thane [eds], A History of Old Age [London and Los Angeles 2005], 31-70). Future anthropolog ical studies of human populations will impact our under standing of anc. demography, including health, which continues to attract attention. The appearance of three general treatments of anc. medicine, with reference to Sicily, is one reflection of such interest: H. King, Greek and Roman Medicine (London 2001) (reviewed by M. Shefer, BMCR 2002.12.33); V. Nutton, Ancient Medicine (London 2004) (reviewed by J. Scarborough, BMCR 2005.07.74); H. King (ed.), Health in Antiquity (London 2005). On the relationship between wine and health in the anc. Gr world, there is a volume edited by J. Jouanna and L. Villard, Vin et sant? en Gr?ce ancienne (Bulletin de Correspondance Hell?nique suppl. vol. 40) (Paris 2002). Malaria, which was also a problem along Sicilian coasts, has been the subject of study too: R. Sallares, Malaria and Rome: A History of Malaria in Ancient Italy (Oxford 2002), and a special issue in World Archaeology 35 (2003), which includes discussions on the anc. Mediterranean world from archaeological and genetics perspectives (see particularly the papers by J.C.C. Hume et al; P. Mitchell; D. Soren). Absolute levels of population, including those in Sicily, have also been discussed. W. Scheidel (JHS 123 [2003], 122-40), using models and comparisons, considers population growth from the DA to the 4th Ct BC and argues, among other things, for the unlikelihood of overpopulation in overseas settlement and a total of 450,000-770,000 people in the Gr W. L. Gallo (Atti elimi IV, 537-48) argues against using the capacities of anc. theatres in Sicily to establish overall population size, and that there were more substantial populations in those communities with theatres than previous scholars have allowed. Epigraphy. Any developments in Sicilian epigraphy to report are thoroughly reviewed in the two standard places: REG 114 (2001), 601-03; 115 (2002), 777; 116 (2003), 682-84; 118 (2005), 589-91, and SEG 48 (1998 [2001]), 387-96; 50 (2000 [2003]), 319-36; 51 (2001 [2005]), 372-400; 52 (2002 [2006]), 296-317. Some of these volumes contain material discussed in the previous Sicilian report, and some of the material published in this period, it should be noted, has not yet appeared in SEG. The linguistic history of Sicily is reviewed by G. Ruffino, Sicilia (Profili Linguistici delle Regioni) (Rome 2002). Bilingualism is one of the features in Sicily's linguistic history, and the subject in general is discussed at length in another volume: J.N. Adams, M. Janse and S. Swain (eds), Bilingualism in Ancient Society: Language, Contact, and the Written Word (Oxford 2002) (reviewed by J.T. Katz, BMCR 2004.02.19). On related topics, it is worth noting two other studies dealing with questions of culture contact and long-distance communication, both essential for understanding the Sicilian situation: B.B. Powell, Writing and the Origin of Greek Literature (Cambridge 2003) (reviewed by D. Steiner, American Journal of Philology 125 [2004], 135-40; A. D'Angour, Classical Review 55 [2005], 394-5) and E. Wirbelauer, in R. Rollinger and C. Ulf (eds), Griechische Archaik. Interne Entwicklungen-Externe Impulse (Innsbruck 2004), 187-206. An important collection of Sicilian epigraphic material in Catania, containing inscriptions from other parts of Sicily and Italy, has been re-edited and published in this period: K. Korhonen, Le iscrizioni del Museo C?vico di Catania. Storia delle collezioni-cultura epigr?fica</page><page sequence="14">136 FRANCO DE ANGELIS edizione (Helsinki 2004) (reviewed by F. De Angelis, Gnomon 79 [2007], 138-41). F. Ghinatti investigates aspirates in Sicilian inscriptions in a lengthy article (Sileno 26 [2000 (2002)], 13-94). Ar Gr texts on amphorae were the subject of a seminar in Milan in 2001; the proceedings, edited by F. Cordano, are published in MEFRA 116 (2004), 733-809. Material from Himera is the focus of one of the papers by A. Brugnone and S. Vassallo (761-80), which discusses at least 43 texts from funerary contexts, although Sicilian material is found throughout these proceedings, especially in a series of 'intervenu' towards to the end of the volume. Four other more general volumes have relevance to Sicily and deserve to be noted: P. Easterling and C. Handley (eds), Greek Scripts: An Illustrated Introduction (London 2001) (reviewed by A. Kerkeslager, BMCR 2002.08.24); E. Lupu, Greek Sacred Law: A Collection of New Documents (NGSL) (Leiden 2005) (reviewed by J.-M. Carbon, BMCR 2005.04.07); R. Osborne and P.J. Rhodes, Greek Historical Inscriptions? 404-323 BC (Oxford 2003) (reviewed by T. Corsten, BMCR 2004.10.08; J.P. Sickinger, AJA 109 [2005], 314-15); B.H. McLean, An Introduction to Greek Epigraphy of the Hellenistic and Roman Periods (Ann Arbor 2002). Historical topics. Anc. Sicily was an important meeting place of cultures (cf. F. Prose, Sicilian Odyssey [Washington, DC 2003]), and it is not surprisingly that the island makes frequent appearances in the recent flurry of comparative culture contact histories: K. Randsborg, Acta Archaeologica 71 (2000), 171-82; G. Urso (ed.), Integrazione, mescolanza, rifiuto: incontri dipopoli, lingue e culture in Europa dall'anti chit? all'umanesimo (Rome 2001); CL.

Malkin (ed.), Ancient Perceptions of Greek Ethnicity (Cambridge, MA 2001) (reviews by: M.C. Miller, BMCR 2002.08.12; A. Snodgrass, AWE 1 [2002], 496-98; A. Dakouri Hild, AJA 109 [2005], 304-07); J.M.

Written sources provide a sizeable portion of the information on which the foregoing historical topics are based. Since Cl archaeology has traditionally received many of its marching orders and interpretative frameworks from written sources (for a recent discussion, see A. Snodgrass, Cambridge Archaeological Journal 12 [2002], 179-94) and since approaches to written sources are quickly shifting from positivist to more sophisticated readings (for a recent discussion, see C.B.R. Pelling, Literary Texts and the Greek Historian [London 2000]), we must round out our archaeolog ical arsenal with the following four basic works dealing with written sources: J. Marincola, Greek Historians (Greece and Rome New Surveys in the Classics vol. 31) (Oxford 2001); R. Vattuone (ed.), Storici greci d'Occidente (Bologna 2002) (reviewed by J. Prag, BMCR 2004.11.21); T.E. Duff, The Greek and Roman Historians (Bristol 2003); C. Higbie, The Lindian Chronicle and the Greek Creation of their Past (Oxford 2003) (reviews by: V. Gabrielsen, Classical Review 55 [2005], 319 22; J. Marincola, BMCR 2005.04.59); E. Galvagno, / successori di Timeo. Studi sulla storiografia siceliota di et? ellenistica (Padua 2004). Land, sea and economics. The Mediterranean as a whole has received considerable attention in this reporting period, particularly as a result of P. Horden and N. Purcell's book The Corrupting Sea mentioned in the previous report (AR [2000 2001], 156). With this attention comes greater understanding of Sicily's place in the wider Mediterranean world. Of the many works published on the Mediterranean in this period, the following three can be suggested as essential reading: D. Abulafia (ed.), The Mediterranean in History (Los Angeles 2003) (reviewed by R.K. Balot, BMCR 2004.07.51); W.V. Harris (ed.), Rethinking the Mediterranean (Oxford 2005) (reviews by: F. Fern?ndez-Armesto, The Times Literary Supplement [24 June 2005], 12; M. Pluciennik, Antiquity 80 [2006], 472-75; J. Boardman, AWE 5 [2006], 345-46; C. Moatti, BMCR 2007.02.40); I. Malkin (ed.), Mediterranean Paradigms and Classical Antiquity (London 2005) (reviewed by E.K. Petropoulos, BMCR 2006.02.41), which started its life as a special issue of Mediterranean Historical Review 18.2 (2003). Such work on the Mediterranean as a whole is having an impact too on particular aspects of Mediterranean geography. We may note, for instance, two works on the history of cartography, including the production of atlases referring to anc. S Italy and Sicily: F. Prontera, Geographia Antiqua 10-11 (2001-2002), 59-64; G. Giarrizzo and E. Iachello (eds), Le mappe della storia: proposte per una cartograf?a del Mezzogiorno e della Sicilia in et? moderna (Milan 2002). Another relevant impact can be seen in the attention to island history, on which one can turn to H. Dawson, PBSR 71 (2003), 313-14 (a summary of a comparative study of Italian islands from the Neo to IA); S.M. Fitzpatrick (ed.), Voyages of Discovery: The Archaeology of Islands (Oxford 2004) (reviewed by V. Fenwick, UNA 34 [2005], 177-78); C. Malone and S. Stoddart, in J. Cherry et al. (eds), Explaining Social Change: Studies in Honour of Colin Renfrew (Cambridge 2004), 93-102; F. Latsch, Insularit?t und Gesellschaft in der Antike (Stuttgart 2005). Worth citing here as well are three recent studies on Sardinia, an island with which Sicily was in frequent contact throughout history: R.J. Rowlands Jr., The Periphery in the Center: Sardinia in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds (BAR International Series vol. 970) (Oxford 2001); A. Mastino (ed.), Storia della Sardegna antica (Nuoro 2005); A. Mastino, P.G. Spanu and R. Zueca, Mare Sardum: merci, mercati e scambi marittimi della Sardegna antica (Rome 2005). Of the works dealing with Sicilian geography, coastal geomorphology in the Quaternary is studied by F. Torre (Archeologia delle Acque 3 [2001], 140-43), who observes that with the melting of glaciers the sea submerged the exposed continental shelf that joined Sicily, Malta and the Aegades Islands. It is also worth noting here the important work on the Tunisian littoral by H. Slim et al, Le littoral de la Tunisie: ?tude g?oarch?ologique et historique (Paris 2004) (reviewed by D.L. Stone, BMCR 2006.04.07). On the relationship between geology and settlement in the Gr and Rom periods, there is book by D.P. Crouch, the seasoned field-worker, entitled Geology and Settlement: Greco-Roman Patterns (Oxford 2004) (reviewed by M. Anderson, Journal of Roman Studies 95 [2005], 319-20), whose Sicilian component consists of Agrigento, Morgantina, Selinous and Syracuse. The recent activity of Mt Etna has doubtless done much to stimulate interest in its history, past, present and future: see T. Pfeiffer, Scientific American 288.4 (2003), 58-65; A. Bonaccorso et al. (eds), Mt Etna: Volcano Laboratory (Washington, DC 2004); M.S. Balmuth, D.K. Chester and P.A. Johnston (eds), Cultural Responses to the Volcanic Landscape: The Mediterranean and Beyond (Boston 2005), especially the two papers co-authored by D.K. Chester, A.M. Duncan and J.E. Guest (57-69; 93-107). Several works deal with aspects of the anc. written sources for Sicilian geography. Of these, we may first note that E.Manni's Geograf?a f?sica e pol?tica della Sicilia antica (Rome 2004) has been reprinted (original ed. 1981). T. Braun (Studies Shefton, 287-347) dedicates a long article to Hectataeus' knowledge of the W Mediterranean. F.P. Rizzo (Studi De Miro, 591-97) collects what the anc. geographers have to say about the lengths of Sicily's coast. On constellations and sailing, in and around Sicily, there is a piece by M. Girone in Atti elimi IV (737-51). Communication by land and sea in the time of Dionysius I?II of Syracuse is investigated by G. Uggeri (Due Dionisi, 295-320). F. Cordano examines Polybius' treatment of Sicily's geography in U. Laffi et al. (eds), Artissimum memoriae vinculum. Scritti di geograf?a storica e di antichit? in ricordo di Gioia Conta (Florence 2004), 143-48. K. Geus (Orbis Terrarum 6 [2000], 55-90) considers utopias, including Euhemerus the Sicilian's contribution to them. For Euhemerus, see also M. Winiarczyk, Euhemeros von Messene (Munich 2002) (reviewed by P.W van der Horst, BMCR 2002.07.21). The study of landscapes and territories continues apace, as predicted in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 145). The state of play is summarized for Italy as a whole in two works: P. Attema et al. (eds), New Developments in Italian Landscape Archaeology (BAR International Series vol. 1091) (Oxford 2002); S. Stoddart (PIA VI, 1-8). See also S.E. Alcock and J.F. Cherry (eds), Side-by-side Survey: Comparative Regional Studies in the Mediterranean World (Oxford 2004) (reviewed by D.R. Stewart, BMCR 2005.01.17). Discussion of W Gr landscapes and environments in all their facets can be found in three works: Atti Taranto XL; Atti Taranto XLII; G. Camassa et al. (eds), Paesaggi di potere: problemi e prospettive (Rome 2000), especially the papers by A. Muggia (199-218) on 'la zona di rispetto' (cf. AR [2000-2001], 152) and F. Veronese (239-83) on sanctuaries. Village life in Cl Sicily is mentioned in passing in W. Schmitz, Nachbarschaft und Dorfgemeinschaft</page><page sequence="16">138 FRANCO DE ANGELIS im archaischen und klassichen Griechenland (Klio suppl. vol. 7) (Berlin 2004) (reviewed by R. Osborne, Gnomon 78 [2006], 423-26). On the supplying of fresh water for both human consumption and irrigation in Sicily, there are two articles by one of the leading specialists: S. Collin Bouffier, in J.-P. Brun and P. Jockey (eds), Techniques et soci?t?s en M?diterran?e (Paris 2001), 513-27; In binos actus lumina 1 (2002), 27-35. In both articles, the author calls for more systematic work on a topic which, while of crucial significance, is generally overlooked. Also relevant here is J.A. Krasilnikoff, in K. Ascani et al. (eds), Ancient History Matters: Studies Presented to Jens Erik Skydsgaard on his Seventieth Birthday (Rome 2002), 48-62, who argues that irrigation occurred more frequently than most scholars currently imagine. A. Dalby, the well-known writer on anc. food, has produced a general work deserving citation here: Food in the Ancient World: From A-Z (London 2003). J. Wilkins (Journal of Mediterranean Studies 10.1-2 [2000], 213-22) and R. Padalino (Siculorum Gymnasium 56 [2003], 115-60) have some thoughts on the development of food culture in zones of culture contact, including in this case Gr S Italy and Sicily. See also Wilkins' The Boastful Chef: The Discourse of Food in Ancient Greek Comedy (Oxford 2000). The first volume of a multi-volume history of Italian agriculture, edited by G. Forni and A. Marcone (Storia dell ' agricoltura italiana [Florence 2002]), is devoted to the PH and Rom periods and includes a chapter on the W Gr potential by M. Nafissi. F. Cantarelli, La primogenitura storica della Sicilia alimentare (Noceto 2002) studies the Sicilian agricul tural past in a search for elements to be deployed in future economic and marketing strategies. There is a chapter on wine and oil in anc. Italy from Gr 'colonization' to the Rom conquest in one of J.-P. Brun's many recent volumes: Le vin et l'huile dans la M?diterran?e antique (Paris 2003), 159-86, which includes an overview of the evidence from Sicily. The wines of Sicily as a whole are discussed by C. Privitera, Vini di Sicilia (Catania 2005). There are also works on Sicily's fauna to report. Sicily is mentioned at times in a work on Cl and Hel pastoralism: C. Chandezon, L'?levage en Gr?ce (fin Ve-fin Fr s. a.C). L'apport des sources ?pigraphiques (Bordeaux 2003) (reviews by: E. Mackil, BMCR 2004.07.39; H. Derks, The European Legacy 11 [2006], 541-46). The horse culture of Ar Italy is studied in detail by N. Lubtchansky, Le cavalier tyrrh?nien (BEFAR vol. 320) (Paris 2005). On the 'cirneco' dog, used in hunting deer, G. Manganaro (Quaderni Catanesi di Studi Antichi e Medievali ns 3 [2004], 47-59) collects all the surviving literary, icongraphic and numismatic evidence. An overview of linen production is provided by M. Gleba, in C. Alfaro et al. (eds), Purpurae vestes. Actas del I Symposium Internacional sobre Textiles y Tintes del Mediterr?neo en ?poca romana (Ibiza, 8 al 10 de noviembre, 2002) (Valencia 2004), 29-38. The sea and its products have received much attention, as part of the Mediterranean-wide perspectives referred to earlier. We begin with two works on salt: L. Gallo (Studi Cataudella, 459-71); J.M. Dillon, Salt and Olives: Morality and Custom in Ancient Greece (Edinburgh 2004) (reviewed by G.S. Bowe, BMCR 2004.12.12). On fish, there is an important potted history of the role of fish in the anc. economy by T. Bekker Nielsen, in K. Ascani et al. (eds), Ancient History Matters: Studies Presented to Jens Erik Skydsgaard on his Seventieth Birthday (Rome 2002), 29-38, in which arguments against minimalist views of fishing are advanced. Archestratos of Gela continues to attract attention, as in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 157): C. Fucarino (ArchStorSic 28 [2002], 5-51), who emphasizes that the Arab period is not to be regarded as the chief stimulus on Sicilian fish cuisine. Sicilian clay weights attached to fishing nets are studied by P. Lo Cascio (SicArch xxxii.97 [1999 (2001)], 181-98). Several general works on the sea and shipping in all their dimensions refer to Sicily in passing and in detail, and these are listed here in chronological order: G.J. Oliver et al. (eds), The Sea in Antiquity (BAR International Series vol. S899) (Oxford 2000) (reviews by: C. Ward, UNA 32 [2003], 130-31; N. Purcell, AWE 5 [2006], 361-62); M. Wedde, Towards a Hermeneutics of Aegean Bronze Age Ship Imagery (Mannheim 2000) (reviewed by C. Ward, UNA 30 [2001], 306-07); J. Morton, The Role of the Physical Environment in Ancient Greek Seafaring (Mnemosyne suppl. vol. 213) (Leiden 2001) (reviewed by C. Ward, UNA 30 [2001], 313-14); G. Allotta (ed.), // mare e la sua vita (Agrigento 2002); J. Andreau and C. Virlouvet (eds), L 'information et la mer dans le monde antique (Collection de l'?cole Fran?aise de Rome vol. 297) (Rome 2002); G. Harlaftis and C. Vassallo (eds), New Directions in Mediterranean Maritime History (St John's, Nfld 2004); A. Lindenlauf, World Archaeology 35 (2004), 416-33; S. Medas, De rebus nauticis. L'arte della navigazione nel mondo antico (Rome 2004); A. Tilley, Seafaring on the Ancient Mediterranean: New Thoughts on Triremes and Other Ancient Ships (BAR International Series vol. 1268) (Oxford 2004); P. Arnaud, Les routes de la navigation antique. Itin?raires en M?diterran?e (Paris 2005); S. Mark, Homeric Seafaring (College Station 2005). On landings and ports, and the activities in and out of them, see A. Gallina Zevi and R. Turchetti (eds), Le strutture dei porti e degli approdi antichi (Soveria Mannelli 2004); M. Pasquinucci and T. Weski (eds), Close Encounters: Sea- and River-borne Trade, Ports and Hinterlands (BAR International Series vol. 1283) (Oxford 2004). On shipwrecks, including reference to Sicilian material, there is a special issue of World Archaeology 32 (2001), 279-428, edited by D. Gibbins and J. Adams. Stone anchors, which are often found in shipwreck sites, are ordered by type and catalogued with descriptions and photographs by A. Papo, Ancore di pietra. Viaggio alle radici della storia (Formello 2005). Of the many works published in this period concerned with economies on land and sea, we may note the following. The collection of articles in J. Manning and I Morris (eds), The Ancient Economy: Evidence and Models (Stanford 2005) is perhaps the most up-to-date work in existence, which takes account of new views of the anc. Mediterranean and argues for comparative approaches, ones which, among other things, laudably seek to bring down barriers between the Near Eastern and Cl worlds and between disciplines. Other collections of articles also have much to contribute: P. Cartledge, E.E. Cohen and L. Foxhall (eds), Money, Labour and Land: Approaches to the Economies of Ancient Greece (London 2002), and for a convenient review of several important French works, see E.E. Cohen, AJA 105 (2001), 313-15. Sicily also features in other general works synthesizing particular periods of economic history: L. Migeotte, L'?conomie des cit?s grecques (Paris 2002) (reviewed by S. von Reden, Gnomon 78 [2006], 648-50) (an Italian translation, edited by U. Fantasia, appeared in 2003); A. Eich, Die politische ?konomie des antiken Griechenland (6.-3. Jh. v. Chr.) (Cologne 2005); Z.H. Archibald et al. (eds), Hellenistic Economies (London 2001) (reviewed by R. Osborne, BMCR 2001.03.24); Z.H. Archibald et al. (eds), Making, Moving and Managing: The New World of Ancient Economies (Oxford 2004); E. Lo Cascio and D.W. Rathbone (eds), Production and Public Powers in Classical Antiquity (Proceedings of the Cambridge Philological Society suppl. vol. 26) (Cambridge 2000), particularly the general papers investi</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001-2005 139 gating the theme by R. Sallares and M. Austin, as well as C. Ampolo's paper on sacred land in the Ar and Cl Gr world, including S Italy and Sicily. The question of the ownership of land by sanctuaries is also treated in a monograph by M. Horster, Landbesitz griechischer Heiligtuemer in archaischen and klassischer Zeit (Berlin 2003) (reviewed by S. Isager, BMCR 2005.07.20). There is an excellent overview of the history of anc. Gr agricultural studies (including Sicily) over the past two centuries by U. Fantasia, Quaderni di Storia 57 (2003), 101-45. Trade and human mobility are other themes that have items to report on. Workshops and production amongst the W Greeks in general are discussed by T. Fischer-Hansen, in P. Flensted-Jensen et al. (eds), Polis and Politics: Studies in Ancient Greek History Presented to Mogens Herman Hansen on his Sixtieth Birthday, August 20, 2000 (Copenhagen 2000), 91-120, who considers a subject that the Copenhagen Polis Centre did not include in its database, since it was not directly relevant to the project's aims. Mobility in general is the subject of a volume edited by C. Moatti, La mobilit? des personnes en M?diterran?e de l'antiquit? ? l'?poque moderne: proc?dures de contr?le et documents d'identification (Collection de l'Ecole Fran?aise de Rome vol. 341) (Rome 2004). On the Ar Gr trader, and aristocratie connections, see F. Kudlien, M?nsterische Beitr?ge zur antiken Handelsgeschichte 18.2 (1999), 56-72; A. Duplouy, Revue Beige de Philologie et d'Histoire 80 (2002), 5-24 and K. Raaflaub, in R. Rollinger and C. Ulf (eds), Commerce and Monetary Systems in the Ancient World (Stuttgart 2004), 197-217. An overview of Aeginetan trade in Italy is provided by S. Hiller (Ag?is und Mittelmeer, 461-9). The relationships between trade and politics are explored in C. Zaccagnini (ed.), Mercanti e pol?tica nel mondo antico (Rome 2003), with several relevant papers on the anc. Gr and Italian worlds. For piracy in the Adriatic, there is a book by G. Scotti, I pirati dell 'Adri?tico (Trieste 2003). We also need to mention here two works on slavery: F.H. Thompson, The Archaeology of Greek and Roman Slavery (London 2003) includes discussion of Gr S Itlay and Sicily, as also in H. Bellen and H. Heinen, Bibliographie zur antiken Slaverei (Stuttgart 2003) (reviewed by W. Scheidel, BMCR 2005.09.39). Mining and metal-working in the W Mediterranean from PH to Rom times have received a recent in-depth treatment: A. Leho?rff (ed.), L'artisanat m?tallurgique dans les soci?t?s ancienne en -M?diterran?e. Techniques, lieux et formes de production (Collection de l'?cole Fran?aise de Rome vol. 332) (Rome 2004). The part played by anc. Greeks is discussed often throughout this volume, as it is by A. Zifferero in P. Attema et al. (eds), New Developments in Italian Landscape Archaeology (BAR International Series vol. 1091) (Oxford 2002) 60-68 and by V.F. Buchwald, Iron and Steel in Ancient Times (The Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, Historisk-filosofiske Skrifter vol. 29) (Copenhagen 2005). Regarding the development of Sicilian Gr bronze-working, G. Manganaro (Mediterr?neo Antico 6 [2003], 767-94) re-asserts the old line that the Greeks had a superior culture vis-?-vis the natives, and that the Greeks learned nothing from the inhabitants they encountered on the island. At the same time, Gr Sicily's bronze-working was a provincial offshoot of the Gr homeland. Whether or not true, it is important not to dismiss developments in native Sicilian metallurgy, of which our under standing is constantly growing (see 'Native and Other Italic' section above), while keeping an eye on developments in Greece itself. In this connection, one could also cite here three relevant works: J.-L. Zimmermann (Mediterranean Archaeology 14 [2001], 111-23) on the adoption of iron in DA Greece; J. Bouzek (?g?is und Mittelmeer, 363-69) on Macedonian bronze in PH and Ar Italian contexts; N. Papalexandrou, The Visual Poetics of Power: Warriors, Youths and Tripods in Early Greece (Lanham, MD 2005) (reviewed by M. Wilson Jones, BMCR 2005.08.23). There is also a handy catalogue of ribbed bronze bowls from across the Mediterranean in F. Sciacca, Patere baccellate in bronzo: Oriente, Grecia, Italia in et? orientalizzante (Rome 2005). Myth and religion. Some of the developments in myth and religion are reviewed as part of the 'Chronique arch?ologique de la religion grecque' by N. Cucuzza, Kernos 14 (2001), 292 94; 15 (2002), 470-77; 16 (2003), 341-45; 17 (2004), 290-94; 18 (2005), 519-24. Of the general works with relevance to anc. Sicily, we begin with a new project entitled Thesaurus Cultus et Rituum Antiquorum, 5 vols (Los Angeles 2004). A refreshing cross-cultural perspective is taken in S.I. Johnston (ed.), Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide (Cambridge, MA 2004), and in S. Georgoudi et al. (eds), La cuisine et l'autel. Les sacrifices en questions dans les soci?t?s de la M?diterran?e ancienne (Turnhout 2005). On Gr religion, there is now a volume by J.D. Mikalson, Ancient Greek Religion (Oxford 2005) (reviewed by G. Bodard, BMCR 2005.04.33). Nine papers are devoted to the methods and problems of using images in the history of religion (MEFRA 113 [2001], 175 400), including a contribution by M. de Cesare (383-400) on the myth of the Proetids on a Siceliot calyx krater from Syracuse. In a related vein, the limitations of the documentary sources for the study of sanctuaries are focused on in O. de Cazanove and J. Scheid, Sanctuaires et sources. Les sources documentaires et leur limites dans la descriptions de lieux de culte (Naples 2004). The subject of festivals is the richer thanks to A. Motte and C. Ternes (eds), Dieux, f?tes, sacr? dans la Gr?ce et la Rome antiques (Turnhout 2003) (reviewed by J.M. Bremer, BMCR 2004.02.07). There are also studies on the religious history of regions of the Gr homeland connected with Sicily's settlement: J. de la Geniere (?g?is und Mittelmeer, 133-41) on E Gr religion; R. H?gg (ed.), Peloponnesian Sanctuaries and Cults (Stockholm 2002) (reviews by: G. Salapata, BMCR 2004.04.30; C. Antonaccio, AJA 109 [2005], 308-11); M. Prent, Cretan Sanctuaries and Cults (Leiden 2005) (reviewed by N. Kourou, BMCR 2005.09.60). D.J.I. Begg argues that 'BA' Gr myths connected with Sicily are later propaganda, not PH reality, in J.P. Bews, I.C. Storey and M.R. Boyne (eds), Celebratio: Thirtieth Anniversary Essays at Trent University (Peterborough, ON 1998) 62-66 (missed in the last report). Turning to Sicilian religion per se, E. Manni's important work Sicilia pagana was reprinted in 2003 in Palermo. This is an amplified reprint of the 1963 original, containing two intro ductory essays and photographic documentation prepared by disciples of his so-called Palermo School. The relationship between myth and history is explored further in four other works: B. Parodi, Miti e storie della Sicilia antica (Bergamo 2003); P. Schirripa, Kokalos 46 (2000 [2005]), 327-43, whose particular focus concerns Sicilian myths in Sophocles; C. Ca?ame, Myth and History in Ancient Greece: The Symbolic Creation of a Colony (Princeton 2003), (a translation of the French original cited m AR [2000-2001], 158); S. des Bouvrie (ed.), Myth and Symbol I: Symbolic Phenomena in Ancient Greek Culture (Bergren 2002) (reviewed by B.B. Powell, BMCR 2004.01.16). Observations on the spatial organization of ritual in Ar and Cl Sicily can be found in M. Fitzjohn (?g?is und Mittelmeer, 197-200). The theory that ritual dramas occurred in Gr and Italic sanctuaries is proposed by I. Nielsen in Cultic Theatres and Ritual Drama: A Study in Regional Development and Religious Interchange between East and West</page><page sequence="18">140 FRANCO DE ANGELIS in Antiquity (Aarhus 2002) (reviewed by R. Taylor, BMCR 2005.09.04). Sicilian evidence is considered and Phoenician influences on it postulated, for which see also generally S. Ribichini, M. Rocchi and P. Xella (eds), La questione delle influenze vicino-orientali sulla religione greca (Rome 2001) (reviews by: N. Robertson, Mouseion 1 [2002], 365-73; E. Lupu, BASOR 328 [2002], 94-95). Sicilian activity at Panhellenic sanctuaries is discussed in five publications. M. Rausch explores 'nationality' via the cult of Zeus at Olympia, in L. Braccesi (ed.), Hesperia X/F(Rome 2001), 85-103. S.E. Harrell (Mnemosyne 55 [2002], 439-64) explores how Syracuse's Deinomenid tyrants represented their political position in epinician poetry and in dedications at Olympia and Delphi, pointing out that they saw themselves as Panhellenic figures benefitting the city and its people. At the same time, the poetry represented the tyrants as epic kings, while the inscrip tions celebrate them as private benefactors of the sanctuaries and avoid direct reference to their political position in Syracuse. On monumental offerings made at Delphi, A.Jacquemin, Offrandes monumentales ? Delphes (BEFAR vol. 304) (Athens 1999) (missed in the last report) and in Y. Perrin and T. Petit (eds), Iconographie imp?riale, iconographie royale, iconographie des ?lites dans le monde greco-romain (St Etienne 2004). And A. Di Vita (Sicilia Antiqua 1 [2005], 63 73) summarizes Sicily's Olympic victors. We can also note a volume celebrating the German excavations at Olympia: H. Kyrieleis (ed.), Olympia 1875-2000: 125 Jahre deutsche Ausgrabungen (Mainz am Rhein 2002) (reviewed by W.A.P. Childs, BMCR 2004.02.26). Three studies on divination can be noted here too: D. Ogden, Greek and Roman Necromancy (Princeton 2001); S.I. Johnston and P.T. Struck (eds), Mantik?: Studies in Ancient Divination (Leiden 2005) (reviewed by A. Nice, BMCR 2006.04.10); J. Eisner and I. Rutherford (eds), Pilgrimage in Graeco-Roman and Early Christian Antiquity: Seeing the Gods (Oxford 2005) (reviewed by L. Nasrallah, BMCR 2007.02.19). Several heroes and divinities have also been the focus of scholarly attention. On Acheloos: E. Mussini, Studi Etruschi 65-68 (2002), 91-119. On Aphrodite: A. Dalby, Venus: A Biography (Los Angeles 2005) (reviewed by D. Lowe, BMCR 2005.10.42). On Apollo: I. Schachar, Mediterranean Historical Review 15.2 (2000), 1-26, who observes that not all of the 40 place-names derived from the god were because he guided their 'colonization'. On Demeter and Persephone: A.M. Corradini et al, ArchViva xxiii.105 (2004), 54-67; G. Pruned, ArchViva xxiii.107 (2004), 16-17. Demeter and Persephone are also discussed in several other works on women and anc. religion, a very topical subject at the moment. Note in particular the following works: L.E. Doherty, Gender and the Interpretation of Classical Myth (London 2001) (reviewed by S. Deacy, BMCR 2003.08.02); M. Dillon, Girls and Women in Classical Greek Religion (London 2002) (reviewed by K.L. Gaca, BMCR 2002.11.06); J.M. Redfield, The Locrian Maidens: Love and Death in Greek Italy (Princeton 2003) (reviewed by D. Boedeker, Classical Review 55 [2005], 608-10); S.G. Cole, Landscapes, Gender, and Ritual Space: The Ancient Greek Experience (Berkeley 2004) (reviewed by S. Lape, BMCR 2004.09.18; J. Larson, Phoenix 59 [2005], 369-70; R. Osborne, Gnomon 79 [2007], 80-2); B. Goff, Citizen Bacchae. Women s Ritual Practice in Ancient Greece (Berkeley 2004) (reviewed by W.D. Furley, BMCR 2005.04.12); A. Bottini (ed.), // rito segreto. Misteri in Grecia e a Roma (Rome 2005). On Hera: J.D. Baumbach, The Significance of Votive Offerings in Selected Hera Sanctuaries in the P?loponn?se, Ionia and Western Greece (BAR International Series vol. 1249) (Oxford 2004) (reviewed by J. Boardman, AWE 4 [2005], 477-78; N. Papalexandrou, BMCR 2005.05.55), who notes regional differences in cult practices. On Herakles: D. Barbagli and P. Pruneti, ArchViva xx.88 (2001), 26-37; M. Giangiulio and G. Panessa, Atti elimi IV, 719-25, 987-98 (Panessa notes that the myth of Herakles reflects historical reality of Myc contact with W Sicily); I. Malkin, in E. Gruen (ed.), Cultural Borrowings and Ethnic Appropriations in Antiquity (Stuttgart 2005), 238 58 (cf. also more briefly Malkin in Modern Language Quarterly 65.3 [2004], 359-63); P. Bernardini and R. Zueca (eds), II Mediterr?neo di Herakles: studi e ricerche (Rome 2005). Heroes more generally, including Herakles, are investigated in two other volumes: V Pirenne-Delforge and E. Suarez de la Torre (eds), H?ros et h?ro?nes dans les mythes et les cultes grecs (Kernos suppl. vol. 10) (Li?ge 2000) (reviewed by M.P.J. Dillon, BMCR 2002.12.17); G. Ekroth, The Sacrificial Rituals of Greek Hero-cults (Kernos suppl. vol. 12) (Li?ge 2002) (reviews: J. Jenson, BMCR 2003.06.28; N. Dimitrova, AJA 109 [2005], 307-08). On Sichas: G. Manganaro, SNR 82 (2003), 5 16, publishes a unique silver fraction of the [S]Ichaninoi of the E4th Ct BC depicting a sanctuary of the river-god Sichas. On Zeus: in the same article just cited, G. Manganaro also publishes a Gr silver ring whose iconography is related to Zeus Soter. Numismatics. Six works on particular numismatic themes discuss Sicilian material throughout their pages. The origins of Gr coinage have received two monograph treatments in this period: R. Seaford, Money and the Early Greek Mind (Cambridge 2004) (reviewed by M.S. Peacock, Cambridge Journal of Economics 30 [2006], 637-50); D.M. Schaps, The Invention of Coinage and the Monetization of Ancient Greece (Ann Arbor 2004) (reviewed by J.H. Kroll, Classical Review 55 [2005], 344-46; M.S. Peacock, Cambridge Journal of Economics 30 [2006], 637-50); as well as two essays by N. Parise and C. Boehringer in L. Milano and N. Parise (eds), II regolamento degli scambi nell'antichit? (III-I millenio a.C) (Bari 2003). A series of articles on coin metrology was edited by N. Parise and published in AUN 47 (2000 [2002]), 7-213. On money in the Gr world, there is the monograph by A. Meadows and K. Shipton (eds), Money and its Uses in the Ancient Greek World (Oxford 2001) (cf. also the review of money in the anc. world by S. von Reden, Klio 84 [2002], 141? 74). The study of Italy's coinage is much the richer thanks to N.K. Rutter (ed.), Historia Numorum: Italy (London 2001) (reviews by: D. Castrizio, Polifemo 1 [2001], 38-41; J. Morcom, The Numismatic Chronicle 162 [2002], 431-34; W Fischer-Bossert, SNR 83 [2004], 165-71). Phokaian coins in the W were the subject of a conference published as AA.VV, La monetazione dei focei in occidente (Rome 2002): see especially the paper on the coinage of Velia by N. Rutter (167 85), who casts his discussion in the wider context of S Italian and Sicilian coinages as a whole. Another conference has focused on coins in the countryside of anc. Gr overseas settlements: AA.VV, Presenza e funzioni della moneta nelle ?chorai? delle colonie greche dall 'Iberia al Mar Nero (Rome 2004). These proceedings contain two studies specifically on Sicily by M. Caccamo Caltabiano and M. Puglisi (333-70) on the Ar and Cl periods, and A. Cutroni Tusa (371-95) on W Sicily's Gr settlements. M. Caccamo Caltabiano also has an article on bimetallism and bronze coinage in Sicily (in F.M. Vanni and S. Bussi [eds], La moneta fusa nel mondo antico: quale alternativa alla coniazione? [Milan 2004], 17-53). Turning from the more general works, one may begin by noting a review article by the distinguished numismatist H. Mattingly on the methodology used in recent Sicilian work, mentioned in the last two reports, on the 3rd Ct BC (SNR 79 [2000], 35-51). M. Caccamo Caltabiano and M. Puglisi investigate the function of coinage in anc. Sicily, concluding</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001-2005 141 that historical and political events stimulated the production of coinage the most, and not the distribution of wealth (in G. Gorini [ed.], Ritrovamenti monetali nel mondo antico:problemi e metodi [Padua 2002], 31-49). S. Garraffo (Studi De Miro, 351-62) updates his 1984 monograph on overstrikes on Sicily's Ar and Cl coinage. H. Nicolet-Pierre (Klearchos 40 41 [1998-1999 (2000)], 93-115; Polis 1 [2003], 125-36) argues for a more critical approach to pseudo-Athenian tetradrachms, dating this series not to the Athenian invasion of Sicily in 415-413 BC, but to the E4th Ct (before ca 340 BC). She singles out Memphis in Egypt as the main place of their production and hypothesizes that mercenaries carried these coins to Sicily. S. Frey-Kupper and J.-N. Barrandon (Atti elimi IV, 507-36) study W Sicilian bronze coinage in some French and Swiss collections, noting continuity in the Rom period with the preceding Punic and Syracusan monetary traditions. There are several Sicilian papers in a recent volume on the iconography of coinage: M. Caccamo Caltabiano, D. Castrizio and M. Puglisi (eds), La tradizione iconica come fonte storica. 11 ruolo della numism?tica negli studi di iconograf?a (Reggio Calabria 2004) (reviewed by G. Gir?la on the Societ? Numism?tica Italiana website: http://www.socnumit.org/ biblioteca/recensio.htm). Two studies touch in different ways on pan-Sicilianism as reflected in coinage (M. Caccamo Caltabiano, Atti elimi IV, 105-25; R.J.A. Wilson, Studi De Miro, 721-47; the latter is an earlier version of an article mentioned in the previous report: AR [2000-2001], 159). Sicily's coinage from Agathokles to the Rom take-over of the island is studied in a monograph by B. Carroccio, Dal basileus Agatocle a Roma. Le monetazioni siciliane di et? ellenistica (cronologia-iconografia-metrologia) (Messina 2004). Pottery. There is considerable food for thought on the mod. collecting and trading of Gr vases in V. Norskov, Greek Vases in New Contexts: The Collecting and Trading of Greek Vases. An Aspect of the Modern Reception of Antiquity (Aarhus 2002) (reviewed by CL. Lyons, BMCR 2003.09.16). This study provides an excellent background for understanding Sicilian collections, on which several studies have appeared in this period (see also the section above 'History of Scholarship'). Here we can note the article by M. Scalfani (QuadMuseoSalinas 8 [2002 (2004)], 55-70), who throws light on a Sicilian contribution to the 18th-Ct debate about the Etruscan or Gr origins of painted pottery. The contribution came from S.M. di Blasi who argued that the vase was of Sicilian Gr manufacture, and not Etruscan, as was widely believed at the time. Scalfani reviews the matter now that the vase attributed by Beazley to the Pig Painter has been refound in the Palermo Museum, where it is thought to have arrived via a donation by the prince of Cattolica. Moving on to specific pottery types, there on two updates of the ongoing archaeometric work on Myc pottery in Italy: L. Vagnetti, Opuscula Atheniensia 26 (2001), 107-15; R.E. Jones, S.T. Levi and L. Vagnetti, in V. Kilikoglou, A. Hein and Y. Maniatis (eds), Modern Trends in Scientific Studies on Ancient Ceramics (BAR International Series vol. 1011) (Oxford 2002), 171-84. This work has revealed both direct imports and locally made versions thereof, as well as noting that their relative proportions in overall ceramic assemblages are due to the date, location and status of the find-spot. An up to-date overview of the pithoi of LBA Aegean inspiration, including those discovered in Sicilian sites, is provided by S.T. Levi and A. Schiappelli, in E.C. De Sena and H. Dessales (eds), Metodi e approci archeologici: Vindustria e il commercio nell'Italia antica/Archaeological Methods and Approaches: Industry and Commerce in Ancient Italy (Oxford 2004), 96 108. J.K. Papadopoulos (Hesperia 70 [2001], 373-460) inves tigates the Akhaian LGeo and Ar plain banded and monochrome kantharoi found in S Italy and Sicily (specifically Naxos, Megara Hyblaia, Syracuse, Gela, Leontinoi and Himera), arguing, among other things, that they provide evidence for the continuing bonds and links between Greece and Italy in the DA. The uses of Gr pottery in general was the subject of a large Spanish exhibition, with the following catalogue: P. Cabrera, P. Rouillard and A. Verbanck-Pi?rard (eds), El vaso griego y sus destinos (Madrid 2004). Questions of copying and identity are dealt with in two papers in Studies Shefton (R. Jones and J. Buxeda, 83-114; J. Boardman, 149-62), as well as in Archaeometry 47 (2005), 745-62 by G. Barone and others, who attempt, through chemical analysis, to distinguish between imported and locally produced copies of 'Chalcidian', 'banded', 'unvarnished' and 'black varnished' pottery of Ar to Hel date. Boardman argues against the recent tendency to dissociate pots from people, coining the slogan that 'pots are for people'. On Cor pottery, which inspired many Sicilian productions, there are up-to-date overviews by M.K. Risser, E.G. Pemberton and A.B. Brownlee, in C.K. Williams II and N. Bookidis (eds), Corinth: The Centenary 1896-1996 (Princeton 2003). Much scholarly attention has also been paid in this period to E Gr pottery, also widely imported and copied in Sicily. A new classification system for E Gr pottery has been proposed by M. Kerschner and U. Schlotzhauer, AWE 4 (2005), 1-56 (cf. also contributions by the same two authors in ?g?is und Mittelmeer, 407-16, 487-91). On Ar Ionic pottery, there is the publication of an important Spanish conference: P. Cabrera Bonet and M. Santos Retolaza (eds), C?ramiques j?nies d'?poca arcaica: centres de producci? i comercial itzaci? al Mediterr?neo occidental (Catalunya 2000). On Attic pottery, S. Batino devotes a study to the skyphos' iconography and function in Lo skyphos attico dall'iconograf?a alla funzione (Naples 2002). Depictions of 'barbarians' on Attic pottery was the subject of a major conference, the proceedings of which have appeared in four volumes as F. Giudice and R. Panvini (eds), 77 greco e il b?rbaro e la cer?mica attica. Immaginario del diverso, processi di scambio e autorappre sentazione degli indigent (Rome 2004-2006). These proceedings contain much Sicilian material. Iconography more generally has also been treated in two other relevant works: E. Mugione, Miti della cer?mica attica in Occidente: problemi di trasmissioni iconografiche nelle produzioni italiote (Taranto 2000); I. Colpo, I. Favaretto and F. Ghedini (eds), Iconograf?a 2001. Studi sull'immagine: atti del convegno (Padova, 30 maggio-1 giugno 2001) (Rome 2002). Worth noting here too is G. Semeraro's overview (Studi Ciasca, 489-531) of Ar Gr pottery in Malta. A and Cl transport amphorae are the subject of three papers in ?g?is und Mittelmeer: the thrust ofthose by P. Dupont (445-60) and V Gassner (493-96) is on production and development of types, while R.M. Albanese Procelli (479-85) focuses on the movement of foodstuffs. The state of play of Attic and Italiote pottery in Sicily in the 4th Ct can be found in the Due Dionisi volume by F. Giudice (169-201), M. Schmidt (253-64) and U. Spigo (265-93). All these contributions, particularly that of Giudice, contain many details about painters and the distribu tions of their wares. A. Montironi (CdA 36 [1997 (2002)], 129-33) examines Sicilian perfume jars of the 4th Ct, noting their derivation from Attic types at first and their own development thereafter. Apulian pottery has also received an in-depth study: M. Denoyelle (ed.), La c?ramique apulienne: bilan et perspectives (Naples 2005). Tragic themes on S Italian and Sicilian pottery are investiaged by C. Bacilieri, La rappresentazione dell'edificio teatrale nella cer?mica italiota</page><page sequence="20">142 FRANCO DE ANGELIS (BAR International Series vol. 997) (Oxford 2001) and by L. Todisco (ed.), La cer?mica figurata a soggetto tr?gico in Magna Grecia e in Sicilia (Rome 2003). The origins of Graeco-Italic amphorae are explored by G. Olcese, in the volume edited by De Sena and Dessales cited earlier in this section (173-92), who concludes, among other things, that Campanian wine was traded in the W Mediterranean earlier than the Second Punic War. There is a comparative study of Gnathian and West Slope Ware by A. Alexandropoulou, Gnathia- und Westabhangkeramik. Eine vergleichende Betrachtung (M?nster 2002). Sculpture and Terracotta. The reception of Ar Ionic sculpture in the Gr W is investigated by H. Kyrieleis (Ag?is und Mittelmeer, 265-74). The influences of the Gr homeland can be seen in two items of sculpture that may have a Sicilian connection, as has been argued in the case of the first item (cf. R.R. Holloway, The Archaeology of Ancient Sicily [London 1991], 109-12), which consists of the famous Riace bronzes. These statues have received a detailed publication in this reporting period: A. Melucco Vaccaro et al. (eds), / bronzi di Riace: restauro come conoscenza (Rome 2003). An article on these bronzes argues that their torso and limbs were cast from life, and not modelled in clay beforehand (N. Konstam and H. Hoffmann, OJA 23 [2004], 397-402). The other item concerns the 'Reggio Calabria' kouros recovered by police authorities in 1990 and acquired by the archaeological service in 2000. In her publication of the piece, E. Lattanzi (BdA 115 [2001], 1-22) notes that the sculpture, whose legs and arms are only partially preserved, stands to a height of 90cm and is made of white Parian marble. She dates the piece, with its Ar smile, to the end of the 6th Ct BC and suspects that it is of W Gr manufacture and, like other such contemporary kouroi, once probably resided in a sanctuary or a necropolis. Elsewhere S. Pafumi (NAC 33 [2004], 41-96) considers the social role of Sicilian sculpture of this very period, in which she observes that no sculptural workshops seem to have existed in cities of changeable and unstable politics, and that private funerary sculpture declined in favour of sculpture of a votive character. However, when social conditions were right, such workshops flourished, such as when Hippokrates and Gelon put the right political conditions in place. Large sculpture in clay in Italy and Greece is compared by A. Moustaka (Ag?is und Mittelmeer, 275-82). A comparative perspective with the Gr W is also maintained by G. Salapata (BABesch 11 [2002], 19-42) in her study of votive plaques, in which she attempts to establish a new typology for this class of material. C. Marconi (Sicilia Antiqua 1 [2005], 75-93) inves tigates whether the subject-matter of a fragmentary play by the Athenian playwright Aeschylus was influenced by the Silen antefixes he must have seen during his sojourn in Sicily, but considers the equally possible scenario that the stimulus came from Athens. Sicily's theatrical masks continue to attract attention. In 2002 in Palermo there appeared Terrecotte teatrali e buffonesche della Sicilia orientale e centrale by the late L. Bernab? Brea and M. Cavalier. From the pen of the same two authors is Maschere e personaggi del teatro greco neue terracotte liparesi (Rome 2001), which must be read in conjunction with the review of D.C. Steures (BABesch 79 [2004], 215-7), who warns that this is the same book as Bernab? Brea's Menandro e il teatro greco neue terrecotte liparesi (Genoa 1981), but now with a different publisher and containing many typographical errors. There are three studies on kourotrophic statuettes. In the first, S. Ducat?-Paarmann (Analecta Romana Institua Danici 11 [2001], 37-45) publishes a statuette of this type in Copenhagen and makes some general remarks on the iconography of Demeter in Sicily. In the second study, J.P. Uhlenbrock (Quaderni di Archeologia della Libya 18 [2003], 15-26) nicknames 57 statuette fragments lacking aesthetic appeal 'The Ugly Family', which is derived from late Ar Sicilian prototypes and consists of an enthroned female holding a bird and wreath. He argues that the group illustrates Cyrene's dependence, in its formative period, on Sicilian terracottas, but in what exact ways remains uncertain, and suggests that this may have come about via Punic trade through Selinous. The third study is a monograph on the so-called 'Athena Lindia' statuettes by M. Albertocchi, Athena Lindia. Le statuette siceliote con pettorali di et? arcaica e classica (Rivista di Archeologia suppl. vol. 28) (Rome 2004) (cf. also her article on the Ionic influences on this class of material in ?g?is und Mittelmeer, 349-56). Albertocchi catalogues all the known examples by type and iconography and singles out Akragas in the 6th Ct BC as their primary place of production, thereby denying their traditional identification with Lindos in Rhodes. The distribution of these statuettes in Sicily is hypothesized to have been because of their use in fertility cults. An overview of terracotta production in the time of Dionysios I and II in another article by J.P. Uhlenbrock (Due Dionisi, 321-37) points out that, despite their abundance, terracottas remain a little studied class of material. Hel mould-made lamps are discussed by D. K?ch (Studi Isler, 205-17). ROMAN Interest in the Rom Republic continues to grow, thus throwing by extension attention on anc. Sicily. For historical overviews, see H.I. Flower (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic (Cambridge 2004) (reviewed by U. Roth, BMCR 2005.07.47), as well as more specific portraits in four other works: R.M. Carra Bonacasa (ed.), Atti del convegno Tradizione ellenistica nella Sicilia romana: continuit? e discon tinue (Palermo 2002) (some of the essays in this volume have also been published in Seia 6-7 [2001-2002]); L. Campagna, Ostraka 17.1 (2003), 7-31 (on the historiography of the last half century of research); Nuove Prospettive; E.C. Portale, S. Angiolillo and C. Vismara, Le grandi isole del Mediterr?neo occidentale: Sicilia, Sardinia, Corsica (Rome 2005). On the diversity of Rom Italy, see N. Horsfall, Scripta Classica Israelica 20 (2001), 39-50. The Punic Wars continue to garner attention. There has been a reprinting of the classic work by S. Mazzarino, Introduzione alle guerre puniche, with a preface by D. Musti (Milan 2003) (original ed. Catania 1947). On the Punic Wars, see also: D. Hoyos, Unplanned Wars: The Origins of the First and Second Punic Wars, 247-183 (Oxford 1998) (missed in the previous report); C. Steinby, Ancient Society 34 (2004), 77-114 (on naval warfare in the Second Punic War). The transforma tion of Italy under the Rom Republic is examined by N. Morley, Journal of Roman Studies 91 (2001), 50-62; L. De Ligt, Mnemosyne 57 (2004), 725-57 and H. Sidebottom, Historia 54 (2005), 315-30. On Sextus Pompey, there is a general work by A. Powell and K. Welch (eds), Sextus Pompeius (London 2002) (reviewed by J. F?ndling, BMCR 2003.11.02) and a case study by S.E.M. Zarrow on the 'numismatic dialogue' between the Caesarian and Pompeian factions, in which he argues that Sextus Pompey's use of the Catanean brothers from Sicilian myth on his coins was intended to attach himself and his adopted father to their brother and to their claim to Sicily (The Numismatic Chronicle 163 [2003], 123-35). On Augustus: K. Galinsky (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to the Age of</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001 -2005 143 Augustus (Cambridge 2005). Augustus was responsible for founding several colonies in Sicily, on which there are two specifically Sicilian papers (K. Korhonen, 233-54; G. Salmeri, 255-308) in G.Salmeri, A. Raggi and A. Baroni (eds), Colonie romane nel mondo greco. Atti del Convegno, Pisa, novembre 2000 (Minima Epigraphica et Papyrologica suppl. vol. 3) (Rome 2004). Connections between Sicily and Egypt are explored by G. Manganaro (Mediterr?neo Antico 4 [2002], 615-38). The Barbarian invasions are discussed in three volumes: P. Delogu (ed.), Le invasioni barbariche nel meridione dell'impero: Visigoti, Vandali, Ostrogoti (Soveria Mannelli 2001); G. Arnaldi, L'Italia e i suoi invasori (Bari 2002) (English ed. 2005); C.

Rathbone, JRA 15 [2002], 558-60); G. Kron, Athenaeum 92 (2005), 441-95, arguing that Italy under Augustus probably had the same population as early 19th Ct AD Italy. On mobility, W. Scheidel, Journal of Roman Studies 94 (2004), 1-26; 95 (2005), 64-79. The connection between economy and war for Sicily and other regions is explored by T. Yaco del Hoyo, Vectigal incertum: econom?a de guerra y fis calidad republicana en el occidente romano, su impacto hist?rico en el territorio (218 133 a.C) (Oxford 2003). On coinage: F.

Howgego, V. Heuchert and A. Burnett (eds), Coinage and Identity in the Roman provinces (Oxford 2005). Grain is discussed in two works: C. Soraci, Quaderni Catanesi di Studi Antichi e Medievali ns 2 (2004) 289-401; P. Erdkamp, The Grain Market in the Roman Empire: A Social, Political and Economic Study (Cambridge 2005) (reviewed by J.

There have been more national conferences on Med themes than ever before (including a 3rd instalment of the CNAM discussed in the last report), as well as opinions expressed about the field's current and future directions (cf. L. Paolinelli, Archeologia M?di?vale 28 [2001], 419-22; C. Wickham et al, Quaderni Storici 106 [2001], 295-301; A. Augenti, Archeologia M?di?vale 30 [2003], 511-18). Overall, there has been an increase in work across all areas of Byz and later Med archaeology in both quantity and quality, including its theoretical development (cf. L. Lavan and W. Bowden [eds], Theory and Practice in Late Antique Archaeology [Leiden 2003]). We begin with the many syntheses that include Sicily in their pages. Two new encyclopaedias deserve to be mentioned: P.J. Crabtree (ed.), Medieval Archaeology: An Encyclopedia (New York 2001); C. Kleinhenz (ed.), Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia, 1 vols (New York 2004). General works dealing specifically with Sicily include L. Gatto, Sicilia m?di?vale, 2nd ed. (Rome 2002) and F. Maurici, La Sicilia occidentale della tarda antichit? alla conquista isl?mica: una storia del territorio ca. 300-827 d.C (Palermo 2005). Sicily also appears in works devoted more generally to Med Italy: O. Capitani, Storia dell'Italia m?di?vale (Bari 2004); P. Fouracre (ed.), The New Cambridge Medieval History I: ca 500-ca 700 (Cambridge 2005); C. Wickham, Framing the Early Middle Ages: Europe and the Mediterranean 400-800 (Oxford 2005); C. La Rocca (ed.), Italy in the Early Middle Ages: 476-1000 (Oxford 2002); D. Abulafia (ed.), Italy in the Central Middle Ages: 1000-1300 (Oxford 2004). There are also two syntheses focusing on women and gender that include Sicilian material: P. Skinner, Women in Medieval Italian Society 500-1200 (Harlow 2001); J.M. Brubaker and J.M.H. Smith (eds), Gender in the Early Medieval World: East and West, 300-900 (Cambridge 2004). Many of these works contain inter regional perspectives, on which some other works put the emphasis: P. Corrao, M. Gallina and C. Villa (eds), L'ltalia mediterr?nea e gli incontri di civilt? (Bari 2001); M. McCormick, Origins of the European Economy: Communications and Commerce AD 300-900 (Cambridge 2001); D. Abulafia and N. Berend (eds), Medieval Frontiers: Concepts and Practices (Aldershot 2002); C. Wickham, DOP 58 (2004), 161-74. On road-systems: S. Fiorilla (SicArch xxxiii.98 [2000], 247-57) collects the evidence for SE Sicily, while the bigger picture in all of Italy can be found in S. Patitucci Uggeri (ed.), La viabilit? m?di?vale in Italia: contributo alla carta archeologica m?di?vale (Florence 2002). The possibilities of using pottery for economic history are considered by A. Molinari (Archeologia M?di?vale 30 [2003], 519-28), while, on a related topic, career prospects for Med archaeometric studies are weighed by T. Mannoni (Archeologia M?di?vale 28 [2001], 593-94). Discussions of pottery as a whole are contained in S. Patitucci Uggeri (ed.), La cer?mica altomedievale in Italia (Florence 2004). The state of play in Med archaeozoology is summarized by F. Salvadori (CNAM III, 176-81), whose distribution maps are mostly made up of sites in central and N Italy and contains only two Sicilian sites (Brucato and Fiumedinisi). The balsam trade in the Med Mediterranean has been studied by M. Milwright, Journal of Mediterranean Archaeology 14 (2001), 3-23. Two books on Christianity can also be mentioned here: M. Tosti (ed.), Santuari cristiani d 'Italia: committenze e fruizione tra medioevo e et? moderna (Rome 2003); AA.VV., Cristianit? d'Occidente e cristianit? d'Orient? (s eco H VI-XI), 1 vols (Spoleto 2004). Most of the Med work to report concerns the Byz period. The extensive bibliography for the Byz world as a whole has been reviewed in the pages of Byzantinische Zeitschrift 94 (2001), 375-539, 766-905; 95 (2002), 184-397, 727-924; 96 (2003), 333-492, 805-963; 97 (2004), 263-515, 643-827; 98 (2005), 151-359, 617-883. Some of the recent developments in Byz art are reviewed by G. Peers (Florilegium 17 [2000], 155-66). We may begin by citing six general works on the Byz world: C. Mango (ed.), The Oxford History of Byzantium (Oxford 2002) (reviews by: M. Henig, Journal of the British Archaeological Association 156 [2003], 192; G.T. Dennis, The Ancient History Bulletin 18.3-4 [2004], 188-89); R. Loverance, Byzantium (Cambridge, MA 2004) (reviewed by P. Stephenson, BMCR 2004.10.26); T.E. Gregory, A History of Byzantium (Oxford 2005); J.F. Haldon, Byzantium: A History, 3rd ed. (Stroud 2005); J.F. Haldon, The Palgrave Atlas of Byzantine History (Houndmills 2005); S. McLachan, Byzantium: An Illustrated History (New York 2005). On the Byz connections with Italy in particular, see also E. Kislinger, Regionalgeschichte als Quellenproblem. Die Chronik von Monembasia und das sizilianische Demenna. Eine historisch topographische Studie (Vienna 2001); G. Ravegnani, I bizantini in Italia (Bologna 2004). In this connection, it is worth noting three new works on Justinian: M. Meier, Das andere Zeitalter Justinians: Kontingenzerfahrung und Kontingenzbew?ltigung im 6. Jahrhundert n. Chr. (G?ttingen 2003); M. Meier Justinian: Herrschaft, Reich und Religion (Munich 2004) (reviewed by R. Bloch, BMCR 2005.04.45); M. Maas (ed.), Cambridge Companion to the Age of Justinian (Cambridge 2005) (reviewed by M. Meier, BMCR 2006.03.12). The Corleone conference on Byz Sicily, mentioned in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 145), was published in 2002 (cf. Sicilia Bizantina). There are several programmatic papers in this volume, especially those by the late S.L. Agnello, K. Belke, E. Kislinger, E. Vitale and S. Scuto; all of these statements provide much food for thought and will ensure the subject's continued growth and development. There are many new studies on settlement and architecture to report. We begin with two general works: F. Martorano (Polis 1 [2003], 247-58) finds Vitruvian echoes in Byz city foundations, and K. Dark's Secular Buildings and the Archaeology of Everyday Life in the Byzantine Empire (Oxford 2004). Sicily's coastal defences from the Byz period to the end of the Middle Ages are examined by F. Maurici, in J.-M. Martin (ed.), Zones c?ti?res littorales dans le monde m?diterran?en au Moyen ?ge (Collection de l'?cole Fran?aise de Rome vol. 105.7; Collection de la Casa de Velazquez vol. 76) (Rome and Madrid 2001), 177-204; the volume to which this article belongs includes much useful information on Mediterranean coasts and the activities associated with them throughout Med history. Some of the coastal defences discussed by Maurici include castles, which have also been the focus of three books that discuss to some degree periods beyond the Byz: AA.VV, Castelli medievali di Sicilia: guida agli itinerari castellani dell'isola (Palermo 2001) (reviewed by E. Giannicheda, Archeo xvii.8 [2001], 112); F. Maurici and M. Minnella, Castelli (Palermo 2005); G. Vallone, I castelli della Sicilia (Rome 2005). Religious architecture in Byz Sicily is discussed in three monographs: A. Messina, Le chiese rupestri del val Demone e del val di Mazara (Palermo 2001); S. Giglio, La cultura rupestre di et? storica in Sicilia e a Malta: i luoghi di culto (Caltanissetta 2002); S. Giglio, Sicilia Bizantina: l'architettura religiosa in Sicilia dalla tarda antichit? all'anno Mille (Acireale 2003). PH rock-cut tombs were often used as chapels in Byz Sicily; the subject of such</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001 -2005 145 re-use is explored in general by E. Blake, in R.M. Van Dyke and S.E. Alcock (eds), Archaeologies of Memory (Oxford 2003), 203-20 (reviewed by P. Low, Antiquity 78 [2004], 930-94). On a related topic, there are two papers about the 'Christianization' of Sicily in Sicilia Bizantina (R.M. Carra Bonacasa, 105-17; R. Rizzo, 119-46). Villages have also received attention: M. Scarlata (Studi Lavagnini, 315-20) and G. Di Stefano (Magna Grecia (Cosenza) xxxviii.1-4 [2003], 59-60) look particularly at architecture and fortification, while the wider Byz context can be followed in detail in J. Lefort, C. Morrison and J.P. Sodini (eds), Les villages dans l'empire byzantin: IVe-XVe si?cle (Paris 2005). See also in this connection: N. Christie (ed.), Landscapes of Change: Rural Evolutions in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages (Aldershot 2004) (reviewed by P. Squatriti, BMCR 2005.05.05). An overview of Byz economic history is provided in A.E. Laiou (ed.), The Economic History of Byzantium: From the Seventh through the Fifteenth Century, 3 vols (Washington, DC 2002). On Byz food culture, there is another book by the food historian A. Dalby, Flavors of Byzantium (London 2003). The sea and ships did so much to hold the Byz world together, and these and other topics are the subject of two recently published volumes: L. De Maria and R. Turchetti (eds), Rotte e porti del Mediterr?neo dopo la caduta dell'Impero Romano d'Occidente (Soveria Mannelli 2004); A. Carile and S. Cosentino (eds), Storia della mariner?a bizantina (Bologna 2004). On a related topic, K. Dark explores EByz mercantile communities in the W, in C. Entwistle (ed.), Through a Glass Brightly. Studies in Byzantine and Medieval Art and Archaeology Presented to David Buckton (Oxford 2003), 76-81. On coinage, there is a monograph by R. Calciati, Monete bizantine di bronzo della Sicilia, 565-867 d.C (Pieve del Cairo 2000), which is reviewed by D. Castrizio (Polifemo 1 [2001], 5-7), who notes the opportunity this volume missed in not going beyond description to include questions of culture, history and economics. Three papers on coins, and money more generally, in Byz Sicily can also be found in Sicilia Bizantina by A. Cutroni Tusa (413-37), who provides an overview, including the transition from LRom Sicily, C. Perassi (439-74) on glass weights, and A. Fallico and G. Guzzetta (687-744) on, among other things, coins finds in towns. B. Callegher's discussion of bronze coins in the collections of the Museo Battacin in Padua has things to say about EByz Sicilian mints (N?a Rh?me 1 [2004], 101-19). Other metal objects have also been studied in this period: G. Manganaro (Studi Lavagnini, 203-12; Minima Ephigraphica et Papyrologica iv.6 [2001], 131-78) studies graffiti on seals and small finds; M.A. Lima (QuadMuseoSalinas 5 [1999 (2001)], 59-71) publishes some gold jewellery in the Palermo Museum; and G. Manganaro and F. Maurici collect further evidence for personal adornment, especially belt-buckles, in two separate but equally lengthy articles in Sicilia Bizantina (475-511; 513-57). A noticeable increase in attention is also being paid to Islam in Sicily and other parts of the Mediterranean. We begin with the general works. Several articles under the banner of 'Focus on Islam' were published in Antiquity 79 (2005), and they provide an excellent overview of the state of play of the field. On Islam in Italy, see V. Bianchi (Medioevo Dossier 5.3 [2002], 98), and G. Damiani and M. Scalini (eds), Islam: specchio d'Orient?. Rarit? e preziosi nelle collezioni statali florentine (Livorno 2002). Sicily also features in other general works. On seafaring, Y.Y. Al-Hijji et al. (eds), Aspects of Arab Seafaring: An Attempt to Fill in the Gaps of Maritime History (Athens 2002) (reviewed by C. Ward, UNA 34 [2005], 155-58). On cities, P. Wheatley, The Places Where Men Pray Together: Cities in Islamic Lands Seventh through Tenth Centuries (Chicago 2001) (reviews by: A. Hughes, BMCR 2001.09.12; M. Tillier, Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient 47 [2004], 277-80). On coinage, see AA.VV, Simone Assemani. Symposium sulla monetazione isl?mica (Padua 2005). On historiography, C.F. Robinson, Islamic Historiography (Cambridge 2003). Two classic works by M. Amari in the study of Islamic Sicily have been reprinted: Storia dei musulmani di Sicilia (Florence 2003); Sicilia isl?mica neue cronache del Medioevo (Palermo 2004). New developments in the field into the early 1990s are summed up in AA.VV, Giornata di studio del nuovo sulla Sicilia musulmana (Roma, 3 maggio 1993) (Rome 1995) (missed in the last report), and the developments since then can now be measured against AA.VV, La Sidle ? l'?poque islamique. Questions de m?thode et renou vellement r?cent des probl?matiques, published as MEFRM116 (2004), 7-519. Research on the Norman period in Sicily and elsewhere has also picked up pace in this reporting period. For the general works, note the following: G.M. Bacci and A.M. Mastelloni, I Normanni nel sud/The Normans in the South (Messina 2003); G.S. Brown, The Norman Conquest of Southern Italy and Sicily (Jefferson, NC 2003); N. di Mauro, Normanni. I pedroni venuti dal Nord (Florence 2003); G. Scarcella, I Normanni in Sicilia (Palermo 2003); S. Spoto, Sicilia normanna: viaggio nella Sicilia cosmopolita, centro d'arte e cultura tra Oriente ed Europa (Rome 2003). Among the thematic studies, there are studies on the Norman cavalry in Sicily by E. Cuozzo, La cavalleria nel Regno normanno di Sicilia (Atripalda 2002), on settlement by I. Giannetto et al (eds), Ruggero I, Serlone e I 'insediamento normanno in Sicilia (Troina 2001) and by A. Casamento and E. Guidoni (eds), Le citt? medievali dell'Italia m?ridionale e insulare. Storia dell'urban?stica. Sicilia IV (Rome 2004), and a case study devoted to Roger II by P. Aube, Roger II de Sicilie: un Normand en M?diterran?e (Paris 2001). There are studies too dealing with cultural relations and legacies. On Arabs and Normans, note J. Johns, Arabic Administrations in Norman Sicily: The Royal dl wm (Cambridge 2002) and A. Metcalfe, Muslims and Christians in Norman Sicily: Arabic Speakers and the End of Islam (London 2003). On the infusion of Byz and Romanesque forms with Arab ones in Norman Sicily, the proceedings of an international conference can be found edited by D. Knipp in R?misches Jahrbuch der Bibliotheca Hertziana 35 (2003-2004), 33-208. The results of archival research into the Gr presence in Norman Sicily can be read in V Von Falkenhausen 's paper in Sicilia Bizantina (31-72). Studies that blend the Norman period with that of Frederick II can also be noted here: A.-M. Flambard H?richer (ed.), Fr?d?ric II, 1194-1250, et l'h?ritage normand de Sicile (Caen 2001); A. Giuliano (ed.), Studi normanni e federiciani (Rome 2003); AA.VV, Il sarc?fago dell'imper atore. Studi, ricerche e indagini sulla tomba di Federico II nella Cattedrale di Palermo, 3 vols (Palermo 2003); T. Broekmann, 'Rigor iustitiae': Herrschaft, Recht und Terror im normannisch staufischen S?den (1050-1250) (Darmstadt 2005); C. Friedl, Studien zur Beamtenschaft Kaiser Friedrichs II. im K?nigreich Sizilien (1220-1250) (Vienna 2005). On the Jews in Sicily, there are three works that can be noted: H. Bresc, Arabes de langue, juifs de religion: l'?volution dujuda?se sicilien dans l'environnment latin, XIF-XV* si?cles (Paris 2001); H. Bresc, Siculorum Gymnasium 56 (2003), 263 84 on the policies towards them; S. Simonsohn, The Jews in Sicily III-IX(Leiden, 2001-2006). The first two volumes were mentioned in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 161).</page><page sequence="24">146 FRANCO DE ANGELIS SOUTHEAST SICILY Provinces of Syracuse and Ragusa For Syracuse, we begin with the guidebooks and general works published in this period. Three guidebooks have appeared: AA.VV., Isola di Ortigia, Siracusa (Rome 2002); L. Acerra, Siracusa. Itinerari storico-artistici/Historic and Artistic Itineraries (Siracusa 2002); C. Voza and R. Lamberto, A Guide to Syracuse (Siracusa 2002), the latter an English edition translated and edited by H. Fracchia of the 1994 original Italian edition. Of the general works, there are two reprints of classic works to note first: F.S. Cavallari and A. Holm, Topograf?a archeologica di Siracusa: atlante (Troina 2002) (original ed. Palermo 1883); E. Mauceri, Siracusa e la Valle dell'Anapo (S.G. La Punta, CT 2003) (original ed. Bergamo 1909). Another general work on the Myc and Levantine presence in the Siracusano can be mentioned here: V. La Rosa (ed.), Le presenze micenee nel territorio siracusano: I simposio siracusano di preistoria siciliana in memoria di Paolo Orsi, Siracusa, 15-16 dicembre 2003, Palazzo Impellizzeri, Museo Archeologico Regionale Paolo Orsi (Padua 2004). In his intro ductory essay, La Rosa (9-44) reviews modern scholarship on the subject, noting a lack of interest outside Sicily on this region and calling for comparative work that situates Sicily in a wider historical context (a briefer version of this essay has also been published in Sicilia Antiqua 1 [2004], 11?20; Emporia, 571-83). The remaining contributions tackle this problem in two ways: either through the publication of new data or through the reinterpretation of older finds, particularly those of P. Orsi, who laid the groundwork for studies between Sicily and the E Mediterranean in the LBA. In other words, the volume represents a major reconsideration of the question. The various contributions are accompanied by abstracts in English, so as to invite accessibility, and contributors to the volume have aired their views in other forums in languages other than just Italian (for example, G. Alberti, Emporia, 343-51 on Cypriot connections). For the region's later history, we begin with studies dealing with the Gr city's historical topography. There are new details on the topography of Ortygia (B. Basile and S. Mirabella, Studi ClassiciBB, 295-343). During sewer works, archaeologists from the Syracuse Superintendency were able to retrieve details regarding the original coastal morphology of a NW part of Ortygia, in an area previously very poorly known (Fig. 1). Remains of what have been interpreted to be the Cl arsenal, mentioned by Thucydides (vii.22), have been found (no. 1 on the plan). The stone derives from the Monti Climiti, NW of Syracuse. The entire area was levelled in the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC and replaced in Hel times by a quay, 3m w. and at least 8m /., oriented in a N-S manner (nos 2-3 on the plan). The quay is made up of three courses of square blocks whose stone came from the Plemmyrion quarry and sits on a sand/clay mud layer. Hel structures have also been found 30m to the N; they are thought to be those of a mole, with evidence of stagnant water on one side and the moving sea water on the other. Two identical and parallel walls, perhaps belonging to a canal of some sort, cut the quay just discussed. Close to the quay, another tower of the Dionysian city wall was discovered, intended to protect the arsenal (no. 9 on the plan). It has both similarities and differences to the other known towers, suggesting that the city wall may have been built at different times. A little later, in the L4th Ct BC, an embankment was constructed along the coast with a pile of rubble. Evidence of the Byz period also came to light, including the remains of houses, a craftworking area and the fortification system, the latter built in the 1st half of the 7th Ct AD. More details have also been revealed through new excavations in the Ar necropolis of Giardino Spagna, made possible during maintenance work on the nearby hospital (E. Messina and G. Ancona, Studi ClassiciBB, 49-72). The burials, oriented E-W, were made in pits cut into the rock and covered with slabs, either placed on a ledge inside the pit or directly on top of the pit (Fig. 2). Most of the 67 burials were disturbed by the later Hel-Rom occupation of the area, and as a result it is uncertain whether the lack of grave-goods in the burials reflects disturbance or actual patterns of deposition. The oldest grave-goods date to the 2nd half of the 6th Ct and consist mainly of imported pottery: Cor, EGr, and Attic black glaze and rf. Involving this and other necropoleis, we have two more installments of R.M. Albanese Procelli's study on ?lite secondary cremations in bronze lebetai discussed in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 164): Kokalos 46 (2000 [2005]), 75-125; in Gli Etruschi da Genova ad Ampurias. Atti del XXIV Convegno di studi etruschi ed italici, Marseille, Lattes, 26 settembre-1 ottobre 2002 (Pisa 2006), 307-18. Beyond the city, there has been an attempt by F. De Angelis (?g?is und Mittelmeer, 109-15) to estimate the size and nature of Syracuse's Ar territory. He notes three phases of growth (at 700 BC, it may have extended for an area of about 100km2; at 600 BC, this may have grown to about 720km2, reaching its greatest Ar extent of 1000km2 by 500 BC) and stresses the need to avoid letting Syracuse's later history shape interpretations of earlier periods. We turn now to particular archaeological and historical themes by period. D. Mertens (Sicilia Antiqua 1 [2004], 29 34) explores the relationship between architecture and power in Syracuse, from Ar times to the reign of Hieron II, illustrating the connection by using particular monuments from these various periods of the city's history. C. Ciurcina (Studi ClassiciBB, 43 47) looks closely at a fragmentary arula depicting Medusa holding Pegasus. She dates the piece, via other Sicilian parallels, to the 3rd quarter of the 6th Ct BC. On the Deinomenid tyrants, we can note, in addition to Mertens' article just discussed, G. Mafodda's study (Seia ns 5 [2000], 9-16) on the demareteion coins, in which the propaganda aspects are emphasized. For the period of democracy that followed, E. Robinson (Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 100 [2000], 189-205) interprets 1. Syracuse: Ortygia topography</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001-2005 147 2. Syracuse: Giardino Spagna burial the available evidence as indicating that a democracy existed, and N.K. Rutter, in R. Brock and S. Hodkinson (eds), Alternatives to Athens: Varieties of Political Organization and Community in Ancient Greece (Oxford, 2000), 137-51, concludes that democracy with oligarchic tendencies existed. The failed Athenian invasion continues to attract attention: G. Uggeri (Studi Cataudella, 1273-84) and L. Piccirilli (Atti elimi IV, 1049-58) focus on Athens' defeat and the many mistakes leading to it, and J. De Voto (The Ancient History Bulletin 16.1 2 [2002], 61-69) reconsiders the Athenian retreat. On theatre in the 5th Ct BC, we have a long study by S. Amato (ArchStorSir 12 [1998 (1999)], 29-63) (missed in the last report) and a shorter study that looks more widely at the anc. world by G. Pruneti (ArchViva xxiv.110 [2005], 76-80). Our knowledge of Dionysius I-II has advanced greatly as a result of the Due Dionisi volume. Most of its contributions deal with history, especially when their topics stay close to Syracuse itself, but there are articles by D. Mertens (243-52) on Syracuse's 'Long Walls' and on coinage by M. Caccamo Caltabiano (33-45), who looks at three topics: monetary policy, propaganda and the re-use of Dionysius I's coins after his downfall. Many of the archaeological studies contained in this volume focusing on particular Sicilian cities and regions are discussed in the pages below, but here we may note the helpful round-ups of Gr activity in the Adriatic in the 4th Ct BC (by N. Cambi, 47-75, N. Ceka, 77-80, F. D'Andria, 117-37, G. Gorini, 203-15, J.-L. Lamboley, 217-21, and M. Lombardo, 427-42) that otherwise would not be mentioned elsewhere in this report. In other studies on Dionysius I, D. Musti (Sicilia Antiqua 1 [2004], 35-39) discusses the geo-political centrality of Dionysius I's kingdom, noting that it was the largest in Europe before Macedonia, and that Dionysius I made sure that Sicily, not Sardinia, was viewed as the Mediterranean's largest island. S. Aiosa (QuadMess 2 [2001], 91-110) takes another look at the anc. literary sources for Dionysius I's palace on Ortygia and what features they record about it. Aiosa also observes that Dionysius I inspired the monumental practices of later times. C. Cobianchi (Anemos 3 [2005], 7-88) collects and discusses the 44 surviving inscriptions from Dionysius I's Adriatic colonies, whose populations, as reflected in these inscriptions, were made up of both Gr and Illyrian components. J. Morcom considers bronze coinage, in R. Ashton and S. Hurter (eds), Studies in Greek Numismatics in Memory of Martin Jessop Price (London 1998), 287-92 (missed in the last report), and a lead test-piece for a Syracusan tetradrachm of the late 5th Ct BC is published by W. Fischer-Bossert (The Numismatic Chronicle 162 [2002], 1-9). We might also note here the publication of the illustrations to accompany an article mentioned in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 163): G. Manganaro, RIN 102 (2001), 147-65. On Dionysius II, we have a monograph, missed in the last report, by F. Muccioli, Dionisio IL Storia e tradizione letteraria (Bologna, 1999), which, despite its title, does consider somewhat material aspects. I. D'Angelo (Acme 75 [2001], 9-24) argues, by drawing on literary, epigraphic and numismatic evidence, that the basileus mentioned in the Zeus inscriptions from Locri Epizephyri is Dionysius II, and not Agathokles or Pyrrhus. The deification of Dion is debated by M. Zahrnt (The Ancient History Bulletin 14.4 [2000], 171-9) and B. Bosworth, in W. Heckel and L. Tritle (eds), Crossroads of History: The Age of Alexander (Claremont, CA2003), 11-28. The refoundation of Syracuse by Timoleon has been treated in a recent book: B. Smarczyk, Timoleon und die Neugr?ndung von Syrakus (Abhandlungen der Akademie der Wissenschaften in G?ttingen, Philologisch-Historische Klasse vol. 251) (G?ttingen 2003). It is worth noting here L. Campagna's (Studi ClassiciBB, 149-68) re-dating of a Sicilian Hel capital of the Cor order discovered in the area of the Foro Siracusano, from the period Timoleon, to which it is usually dated (H. Lauter Bufe, Die Geschichte des sikeliotisch-korinthischen Kapitells [Mainz am Rhein 1987], 5-9), to the reign of Hieran II, and in particular to the 3rd quarter of the 3rd Ct BC. This is yet another example of the down-dating of archaeological material often attributed to Timoleon (for those instances in the previous report, see AR [2000-2001], 155, 164, 168, 176; and for another example in this reporting period, see the 'Paterno' entry in the 'Northeast Sicily' section below). On Agathokles, L. Raffone (Minima Ephigraphica et Papyrologica iv.6 [2001], 209-28) returns to P. Oxy. xxiv.2399 to reveal details about the political situation in Syracuse during his African campaigns. The latter also feature prominently in V. Armagrande's examination (QuadMess 1.1 [2000 (2001)], 209-41) of Agathokles' Kore/Nike tetradrachms. Armagrande divides this series into two stylistic groups and three historical phases, all in and around Agathokles' African campaigns. The second phase involved minting for military purposes, and the third phase for paying the peace indemnity to Carthage and as a last assault upon Syracuse's oligarchs. On the ideological strategies of Agathokles' reign, there are three papers in different publications by S.N. Consolo Langher: in E. Luppino Manes (ed.), Storiografia e regalit? nel mondo greco: colloquio interdisciplinare, Cattedre di storia della storiografia greca e storia greca, Chieti, 17-18 gennaio 2002 (Alessandria 2003), 287-301; in M. Caccamo Caltabiano, D. Castrizio and M. Puglisi (eds), La tradizione iconica come fonte storica: il ru?lo della numism?tica negli studi di iconograf?a. Atti del I Incontro di studio del Lexicon Iconographicum Numismaticae (Messina, 6-8 marzo 2003) (Reggio Calabria 2004), 335-49; Nuove Prospettive, 79-90. The first of these papers argues that after his African campaigns Agathokles transformed his domain</page><page sequence="26">148 FRANCO DE ANGELIS economically, culturally, politically and ideologically by seeking greater ties with the Hel E; the second paper considers his imagery and legends on coins; and the third looks at the division of power and ruler-cult during the reigns of Agathokles and Hieron II. Ideology is also a theme running through a recent book that also considers the reigns of Agathokles and Hieron II: C. Lehmler, Syrakus unter Agathokles und Hieron II Die Verbindung von Kultur und Macht in einer hellenistischen Metropole (Frankfurt am Main 2005) (reviews by: J.M. Gonz?lez, BMCR 2006.08.40; F. Daubner, G?ttinger Forum f?r Altertumswissenschaft 9 [2006], 1019-23; B. Smarczyk, Historische Zeitschrift 284 [2007], 421-22). Hieron II, on his own, is discussed in several papers in the volume Nuove Prospettive. N. Bonacasa (35-48) has much to say about him in reviewing the archaeology of Sicily in the 3r Ct BC, in which it is observed that this period is a 'delicate' one in the study of the island's material culture. In other contributions: A.M. Prestianni Giallombardo (99-123) connects fortifications and granaries in Sicily as two sides of the same coin; G. Sfameni Gasparro (125-31) underlines the E connection in Hieron IPs religion; L. Campagna (151-89) connects architec ture with ideology, starting with the tricky question of dating (recall also his re-dating of a Sicilian Hel capital of the Cor order discussed above); F. Ferruti (191-212) examines the role gymnasia played in Hieron's value system; C. Parisi Presicce (213-28) provides an overview of work on the monumental altar, arguing that the area W of the altar could have been used to tie up the animals before sacrifice, and that a real temple once existed in front of the altar; E.C. Portale (229-64) considers Hieron II's relations with the rest of the Gr world; A. Carb? (267-75) traces constitutional developments in coins with a figure whose head is crowned with a laurel-leaf crown and later a diadem, arguing that this is none other than Gelon, Hieron II's son, sharing power with his father; and M. Pugliesi (305-27) demonstrates the limited circulation of Hieron II's silver and gold coins, suggesting that they were used for internal purposes in the kingdom. In other publications, we have an examination of Hieron II and Rome's activities in the Adriatic by G. Millino, in L. Braccesi (ed.), Hesperia XVII (Rome 2003), 105-27, as well as two publications on Archimedes: C. Voza, Archimede: Siracusa e il suo genio (Palermo 2002); R. Netz, The Works of Archimedes (Cambridge 2004) (reviewed by E. Dickey, BMCR 2004.07.14). Syracusan society in the aftermath of Hieron II's reign is studied by M. Zahrnt, in L. Mooren (ed.), Politics, Administration and Society in the Hellenistic and Roman World (Leuven, 2000), 489-514. There have also been some studies on Rom and Byz Syracuse in this period. A book on both these periods was published by the late S.L. Agnello, Una metr?poli ed una citt? siciliane fra Roma e Bisanzio (Siracusa 2001) (cf. also his paper in Studi Lavagnini, 3-22). S. Pafumi (BdA 122 [2002], 55-84) convincingly argues that a male torso found by P. Orsi in 1921 is not an original piece of Gr sculpture, but a Rom copy of the Flavian/Trajanic period, and thereby throws light on questions of Syracusan patronage, artistic output and topography. Further insights into Rom society are obtained by K. Korhonen in examining funerary inscriptions: he reveals a multilingual city in the Rom period, strongly rooted in its Gr past, but also with influxes of Latin speakers from nearby regions of the Empire, in E.N. Ostenfeld (ed.), Greek Romans and Roman Greeks (Aarhus Studies in Mediterranean Antiquity vol. 3) (Aarhus 2002), 70-80. Syracuse's catacombs have been the subject of two recent papers: S. Burrafato, Rivista di Archeologia Cristiana 78 (2002), 119-43, discusses painted paradise scenes on the acrosolia of the 'Vergine Siracusana' (in the San Giovanni catacombs, which now have a new antiquarium) and 'Marcia' (in the Vigna Cassia catacombs) tombs; M. Griesheimer and L. Regalbuto, Rivista di Archeologia Cristiana 80 (2004), 85-114, examine the Politi Mausoleum in the heart of Syracuse's N necropolis (near the San Giovanni catacombs), dating it to the M4th Ct AD, and seeing its occupants as pagans buried close to Ch tombs. E. Russo (Studi Lavagnini, 303-14) reconstructs from 18th- and 19th-Ct drawings a LRom building with tubular arches that once stood in Neapolis, on the road leading to the San Giovanni catacombs (Fig. 3). This is another monument with such terracotta vaulting, which is thought to have originated in Syracuse (cf. R.J.A. Wilson, JRA 5 [1992], 110, 127). We might also note here one final item, an exhibition catalogue on Saint Lucy, who is thought to have died ca AD 304: C. Ciurcina (ed.), L'occhio e la luce: omaggio a Lucia (Siracusa 2004). 3. Syracuse: LRom building with tubular arches We may next turn to developments for sites in Syracuse's immediate hinterland. D. Tanasi's re-analysis of the PH cemetery at Cozzo del Pantano highlights the limitations in P. Orsi's published description of tomb 7, which account must be combined with the unpublished excavation notebooks of his assistant E. Caruso (Studi Micenei ed Egeo-anatolici 47 [2005], 323-31). When both accounts are combined, they reveal that the LH IIIA2 kylix found in this tomb was actually placed alongside an individual in a separate burial niche, away from the major burial cell. Tanasi hypothesizes that it belonged to a male native Sicilian of some rank who had exchange contacts with the Aegean. There has been further work on the long known Plemmirio B and Capo Ognina shipwrecks. For the Plemmirio B wreck of ca AD 200, D.J.L. Gibbins (World Archaeology 32 [2001], 311-34) provides evidence of N African amphora production, and for the Capo Ognina wreck, F. Lo Fauci (Archeologia Subacquea 3 [2002], 335-52) assembles all the finds, both published and published, of many years of work, often only published in preliminary form. The author proposes a new framework for terminology, as well as details on the contents and dating of the various wrecks. This is a most valuable contribution, which now forms the point of departure for all future work. To the NW of Syracuse is the peninsula of Thapsos, the site of the well-known BA settlement, from which D. Tanasi (Sicilia Antiqua 1 [2004], 21-27) reconsiders three Myc-inspired clay models. These models are moulded in the shape of a throne and a little bed ('lettuccio') and come from funerary, votive and</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001-2005 149 settlement contexts of LH IIIA2 and IIIB1 date. Tanasi argues that these models recall the benches found in native Sicilian EBA and MBA domestic and funerary contexts, and that the native ?lite chose to adopt and adapt the elements that they wanted from their Myc visitors. Tanasi makes a similar point elsewhere in connection with Myc pottery types imitated at Thapsos (Emporta, 561-69). Tanasi extends this discussion to Pantalica (see below). Away from the coast, to the NNW of Thapsos, is the town of Melilli, in whose environs PH finds have long been known. Another contribution to them is made by G. Cacciaguerra (SicArch xxxiii.98 [2000 (2001)], 129-43), who publishes a tomb with trilithic relief decoration. A brief notice on PH finds in Melilli's Vallone Naga has also appeared from the pen of I. Russo (RSP 55 [2005], 551), who also has produced a small monograph on the EBA fortified village of 'Petraro' near Villasmundo, further to the N of Melilli: // Petraro di Villasmundo (Melilli) (Augusta 2003). On the coast close to Melilli and Villasmundo is the anc. Gr city of Megara Hyblaia. Here, as concerns the well-known French work at the site since the end of World War II, we have mainly new studies of previously excavated material to report, as well as notice of some new excavations, all information kindly supplied by Henri Tr?ziny, one of the directors of the French project. The biggest single accomplishment to note is the 5th volume of the final publication: M. Gras, H. Tr?ziny and H. Broise, M?gara Hyblaea 5. La ville archa?que: l'espace urbain d'une cit? grecque de Sicilie orientale (M?langes d'Arch?ologie et d'Histoire suppl. 1/5) (Rome 2004). This volume collects in ten chapters all the evidence currently available (Fig. 4). In the final chapter (547-84), the authors draw general conclusions on such topics as the aims of the early settlers and the world they left behind and the development of the community, in terms especially of social structure and demography. The volume achieves what it sets out to be: the starting-point for all future work on the Ar city. Elsewhere, Gras and Tr?ziny return to Megara Hyblaia's agora, in E. Greco (ed.), Architettura, urbanisitica, societ? nel mondo antico. Giornata di studi in ricordo di Roland Martin: Paestum, 21 febbraio 1998 (Paestum 2001), 51-63. Megara Hyblaia also features in a more general piece by Tr?ziny on the foundation and re-foundation of Gr cities in the W Mediterranean {Revue d'Histoire Urbaine 13 [2005], 51-66). Material from the early Italian work at Megara Hyblaia has also received attention in this period by A. Iacovella, who is also connected with the French project: N?cropole occidentale de M?gara Hyblaea: reconstitution de l'espace (Lyon 2000) (non vidi); MEFRA 113 (2001), 401-69, the latter using archival documents to retrace the excavations carried out between 1860 and 1897. In his report Tr?ziny notes other studies that belong to more general works cited already elsewhere in this report, as well as other studies in press or in preparation that will appear in the next reporting period and hence discussed then. The new work at Megara Hyblaia involves a three-year project (2005-2007) between the French School at Rome and the Syracuse Superintendency and aims to restore the Cantera lighthouse and Antiquarium, to carry out excavations around Cl temple to the N of the lighthouse and to invest in the mise en valeur of the W sector of Ar city wall, accompanied by targeted control excavations. Outside the circles of the French project, Megara Hyblaia has been the subject of various kinds of study. A guidebook has been prepared by E. Miccich?, Megara iblea: alia riscoperta dell 'antica colonia greca. Guida confidenziale (Catania 2002). I. Malkin reconsiders the question of Megara Hyblaia's foundation, in V.B. Gorman and E.W. Robinson (eds), Oikistes: Studies in Constitutions, Colonies and Military Power in the Ancient World, offered in Honour ofAJ. Graham 4. Megara Hyblaia: Ar town plan (Leiden 2002), 195-225. Malkin begins by noting how 'foundation studies' have fallen out of favour in recent 'colo nization' studies and restates his oft-repeated views that foundation was a process that ended with the establishment of a cult to the dead founder(s). At the same time, Malkin finds evidence of Megara Hyblaia's gradual development, rightly rejecting the retrojection of any later Cl model and thinking to such early foundations as Megara Hyblaia. He ends by wondering whether native Sicilians had something to do with Megara Hyblaia's foundation. This is a theme picked up on and elaborated by F. De Angelis (AWE IA [2003], 19-50), in a general article (cited earlier in the section 'Native and Other Italic') that tackles the role of native Sicilians played in shaping EGr culture in the island. De Angelis has also contributed two other works to Megara Hyblaia. In OJA 21 (2002), 299-310, he argues that silos found in 8th and 7th Ct contexts may represent ?lite attempts to produce a grain surplus for the purposes of trade, thus uniting the usual dichotomy of trade versus agriculture. He has also produced a book on the Megarian city-states of Sicily: Megara Hyblaia and Selinous: the Development of Two Greek Citv-States in Archaic Sicily (Oxford 2003), reviewed by: F Lef?vre, REG 117 (2004), 785 86; D.G. Smith, BMCR 2005.01.28; B.A. Ault, Antiquity 80 (2006), 214-18; R.R. Holloway, AJA 110 (2006), 326-27; H. Tr?ziny, Gnomon 78 (2006), 712-16; A. Robu, L'Antiquit? Classique 75 (2006), 205-12. This is an archeological history whose chief focus is on the development of settlement, society and economy. The study attempts to provide a wider regional context for Megara Hyblaia's development, both inside Sicily and with Gr city-state culture more generally. J.G. De Voto (The Ancient World 36.1 [2005], 90-106) also considers the Megarian city-states of Sicily, though using a more traditional historical approach and older bibliography To the NW of Megara Hyblaia is the mod. town of Lentini, home to anc. Gr Leontinoi, as well as rich earlier and later remains. Visitors can once again view the region's archaeo logical heritage thanks to the re-opening of Lentini's archaeo logical museum on 27 March 2004, after a fourteen-year hiatus brought about by damage caused by the 1990 earthquake. For the site's recent archaeological developments, we begin with a monograph on the Gr city's fortifications mentioned in the previous report but which I had not seen and digested properly (AR [2000-2001], 164): S. Rizza, Studi sulle fortificazioni</page><page sequence="28">150 FRANCO DE ANGELIS greche di Leontinoi, 1 vols (Catania 2000). This volume fulfills a desideratum that has long existed in the study of these walls, namely sufficient documentary material to accompany the numerous excavation reports and studies (Fig. 5). All the relevant dating material is collected and re-examined in two appendices by G. Biondi and A. Montironi (75-128). The following building history is envisaged and based as far as possible on stratigraphie evidence. The fortification's initial construction is dated to the end of the 7th Ct BC to the 1st half of the 6th Ct BC. The fortification suffered destruction in the E5th Ct BC, probably at the hands of Hippokrates. There was reconstruction in the M5th Ct BC, but that was quickly followed towards the end of the century by another destruction, probably at the hands of Syracuse. A second and final recon struction occurred in the L3rd Ct BC (by whom is uncertain), but the fortification suffered another destruction, this time for good, most likely in connection with Rome's conquest in 214 BC. There is also a helpful collection of the 88 mason marks found on various building blocks; among these, 35 different marks can be distinguished. Nearly all the letters of the Gr alphabet are attested, and all the marks were deeply engraved on their respective blocks. Concentrations of marks suggest a division of labour into groups of workers working on different sectors of the fortification; common marks suggest contiguous tracts of wall. Another major step forward in understanding the anc. Gr city is made in M. Frasca (ed.), Leontinoi: il mare, il flume, la citt?. Atti della giornata di studio, Lentini, 4 maggio 2002 (Catania 2004). The first five contributions in this volume concern geography, geomorphology, and archaeology in coastal and underwater contexts, while the next eight contributions are devoted to reports on new discoveries and studies of the city and territory. Of the many results that could be discussed, emphasis here will be placed on new discoveries and interpre tations. F. La Fauci (21-26) reports on new shipwrecks found in a little less than 2m of water in the bay of Agnone. The finds, which date from the 7th Ct BC to the 16th Ct AD, are too heterogenous to be considered a single wreck. The oldest find is the neck of Cor Ar transport amphora and the necks of 'orlo a cuscinetto rigonfio' amphorae, though W Gr Cl and Hel transport amphorae, as well as Rom amphorae and fine wares of various types, predominate. Two lead bars used for weighing down wooden anchors are broadly dated to Cl-Hel times. A quarry of what seems to be the Gr period is studied by E. Felici and G. Buscemi Felici (27-48). The quarry extends for about 2km along the coast between Punta Castelluzzo and Brucoli. Gr letters may be cut into some of the blocks. The area was sheltered enough to allow the loading of blocks for use in the city inland, perhaps in connection with the construction of the fortification mentioned earlier. E. Marilli (55-70) cannot come to a clear conclusion as to whether lake Lentini existed in antiquity. The port of Leontinoi and the river San Leonardo, probably the anc. Terias, which connected it to the sea, are considered by M. Caffi (71-77), who notes that one can still travel by river today, especially in winter, to a place close to Lentini known locally as 'Seggiu' and that comparative evidence from the 19th Ct AD provides insights into the movement of people and goods of all kinds. Interestingly, at the river-mouth, moreover, material from PH to mod. times has been recovered over the years. G. Rizza (81-86), long involved in the archaeology of Leontinoi, provides a thumbnail sketch of work at the site and points out some of the gaps in our knowledge, such as necropoleis of the 8th and 7th Cts BC. M. Frasca (87-98) pieces together various clues to locate the city gate exiting to the campus Leontinus, as it was known in the Rom period. Although there are so far no actual traces of the 5. Leontinoi: reconstruction of barricade wall gate, Frasca hypothesizes that it must have been located close to the quadrangular towers in the curtain wall blocking the N entrance of the valley, where two parallel walls may have formed part of the road for the gate. B. Basile (99-116) discusses the recent discovery of a sanctuary at Scala Portazza just outside Lentini to the W. The sanctuary, built on two terraces joined by a staircase and surrounded by a t?menos wall, was built in the M6th Ct BC and remained in use until the E5th Ct BC. The discovery of the remains of a decorated altar and architectural fragments suggests the existence of a temple, whose overall plan is unknown. Layers of ash, animal bone and pottery were uncovered around the altar; some of this material seems to predate the construction of the altar, thus documenting an earlier ritual use of the area before its monumentalization. Hera may have been worshipped here, judging from a grafitto on a pottery sherd with the first letters of her name. Elsewhere, G. Manganaro (ZPE 149 [2004], 55-68) has published an E5l Ct bronze inscription from this sanctuary. The inscription measures 9.9cm by 4.4cm and has several names inscribed on it. Manganaro hypothesizes that the inscription may have functioned as a tag ('targhetta') that accompanied a votive offering by a group of worshippers. Close by in contrada Alaimo, L. Grasso (117-22) and G. Rizza (RAL 13 [2003], 537-67; Studi De Miro, 579-91) provide more details of excavations that took place in 1987-1988 in a Sanctuary of the Dioscuri (cf. AR [1987-1988], 114). Most of the finds consists of pottery, generally cups of various kinds, often found in conjunction with animal bones, and thus interpreted as votive offerings. The pottery dates to the 7th and 6th Cts BC and comprises both locally produced wares (usually miniature jugs, hydriai and amphorae) and imported ones (ProtoCor, Cor, EGr, Rhodian and Attic). Other finds include terracotta statuettes, loomweights, spindle-whorls and bronze ornaments, though the latter are of Cl-Hel date. In another contribution to the Leontinoi: il mare, il flume, la citt? volume, F. Pulvirenti (139 44) provides details of the archaeological site located at Masseria Castellana, located NW of Lentini. The anc. site is situated in a watershed with defensive possibilities and commanding views of the surrounding territory. Surface work brought to light material dating from LNeo to Med times. There are post-holes cut into the rock and aligned in a regular manner, perhaps belonging to a PH settlement that</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001 -2005 151 accompanied a nearby necropolis. Pulvirenti suspects that the mod. quarry and road leading into it may have had anc. Gr precedents. In the last contribution to be discussed from this volume, S. Scerra (145-47) argues that Leontinoi was the hub of a defensive system established by Dionysius I to control the region's grain lands, interest in which can be retraced via the ceramic workshops established during the tyrant's reign. In other studies, G. Rizza (Studi ClassiciBB, 35-41) returns to an Attic amphora with a depiction of the birth of Athena, picked up in J.D. Beazley, Paralipomena (Oxford 1971), 129, 3bis, and F. Valenti (SicArch xxii.97 [1999 (2001)], 169-80) has published an article on the topography of the Rom city, noting the city's shift N to the plain, where it continued to develop in the Arab and Norman periods. On Monte San Basilio, NW of Lentini, I. Russo (SicArch xxxiv.99 [2001], 107-11) discusses new PH finds from the E slope. Almost due S is Francofonte, where there have been recent discoveries of PH material during agricultural works (I. Russo, RSP 52 [2002], 389). SE of Francofonte is the spectacular site of Pantalica, one so popular with visitors and campers that a plea has been made for the site's protection (M. Di Luca, ArchViva xxiv.112 [2005], 2). The new studies to report concern the Myc influences on the Pantalica North Culture by D. Tanasi, ArchStorSicO 96 (2000), 1-88; in N. Kyparissi-Apostolika and M. Papakonstantinou (eds), The Periphery of the Mycenaean World: 26-30 September, Lamia 1999: Proceedings of the Second Interdisciplinary Colloquium (Athens 2003), 599-611; in V. La Rosa (ed.), Le presenze micenee nel territorio siracusano: I simposio siracusano di preistoria siciliana in memoria di Paolo Orsi, Siracusa, 15-16 dicembre 2003, Palazzo I^vellizzeri, Museo Archeologico Regionale Paolo Orsi (Padua 2004), 337-97; Emporia, 561-9. As with his work at Thapsos (see above), Tanasi emphasizes how the native ?lite chose to adopt and adapt the elements that they wanted from their Myc visitors. SW of Pantalica was anc. Gr Kasmenai, the Syracusan outpost usually located on Monte C?sale. Here M. Melfi (Geo-Archeologia 2 [2000], 39-48) reconsiders the so-called Temple of Ares. After a brief description of the temple's structural history, Melfi focuses attention on the votive deposits of arms, which traditionally have been interpreted as indicating a military function for the site aimed at the conquest of neighbouring native communities. Melfi puts Kasmenai's metal finds in context, noting parallels with native typologies, but observes, by contrast with earlier interpretations, that the native parallels are older in date than those found at Kasmenai and that the material used is different, bronze as opposed to iron at Kasmenai. On this basis, she excludes a model of conquest, replacing it with a model of collaboration that involves native metalworkers operating out of Kasmenai and drawing upon locally stored metals. S SE of Kasmenai is the hill-top town of Buscemi, where we have publications on the EBA site at Contessa di Sotto (B. Basile et al., Studi RiunioneBB, 903-07) and on Med and E mod. castle (S. Distefano, CNAM III, 496-503). Close by to the SE is Palazzolo Acreide, location of anc. Gr Akrai, site of another Syracusan outpost (and later occupation). Here we have a reconsideration of IG xiv.217 by G. Manganaro (ZPE 147 [2004], 115-22). The inscription deals with the renting of public space for religious festivals and probably dates to before 211 BC. Manganaro argues that the inscription can be connected with the city's cult of Demeter and Kore, known from literary and numismatic evidence, and that the cult's seat should be identified with the so-called Temple of Aphrodite near the theatre. For wine produced in the countryside in LRom and Med times, see S. Distefano, SicArch xxxv.100 (2002), 89-112. To the SW is the Noto region, site of the old and new city, the latter created after the infamous earthquake of 1693. The extensive anc. and Med remains in this region have been the subject of a recent volume: F. Balsamo and V La Rosa (eds), Contributi alia geograf?a storica dell'agro netino. Atti delle giornate di studio, Noto, Palazzo Trvgona, 29-30-31 maggio 1998 (Noto 2001). Of the nine contributions contained in this volume, we may begin by noting those of M. Frasca (47-54) and R.M. Albanese Procelli (55-72), who summarize the region's LBA and EIA data, which include the important site of Monte Finocchito, with which the early Greeks were in contact. Frasca reviews in particular the settlement evidence, taking the opportunity to respond to comments made on his earlier study of Monte Finocchito (CdA 20 [1981], 13-102). Albanese Procelli tackles the region's social and economic organization, finding subtle differences in grave-goods, which usually are read in a more cursory manner as evidence of an egalitarian community. G. Manganaro (73-96) collects the available literary, epigraphic and numismatic data for the Graeco-Rom periods. L. Guzzardi (97-109) discusses recent archaeological discoveries all across the region, including a new 4th Ct BC inscription, of probably funerary function, found in contrada Zisola in the territory of anc. Heloros and a large farmstead, with occupation spanning the 6th to the 4th Ct BC, midway between Noto and Rosolini. A. Patan? (111-23) considers Rom Noto, while A. Messina (125-38) and L. Arcifa (159-99) examine aspects of Med settlement and society. We might also note here in context an article by L. Falesi, published in another volume (Studi Classici e Orientali 47 [2004], 199-237), on the territory of Noto Antica in Hel times - a subject matter that complements the studies of Manganaro, Guzzardi and Patan? just discussed. There are also developments pertaining specif ically to Eloro (anc. Heloros), SE of Noto on the coast. On the anc. settlement's origins, there has been an article published by F. Copani (Acme 58 [2005], 245-63), who does not view the early Syracusan settlement as a military outpost, but an agri cultural settlement jointly established with a pre-existing native community. At the same time, Copani does not deny strategic motivations and thinks that Heloros provides insights into the behaviour of Syracuse's Gamoroi, who sought to amass a large territory for their economic gain. The Rom period has not gone unnoticed in this reporting period. The stunning mosaics at the Tellaro villa were put on public display in Noto. An accompa nying exhibition catalogue has also appeared: G. Voza, Mosaici del Tellaro. Lusso e cultura nel sud-est della Sicilia (Siracusa 2003) (cf. also G. Pruneti, ArchViva xxiii.103 [2004], 4-5). In the neighbouring province of Ragusa, the regional archaeological museum in the provincial capital has a new guidebook: G. Di Stefano (ed.), // Museo Archeologico Ibleo di Ragusa (Naples 2001). To the S of Ragusa, near Monte Streppenosa in the Irminio river valley, we have a further study of the 30kg bronze hoard of the 10th and 9th Cts BC found at the Ragusano Castelluccio (cf. AR [1987-1988], 116-17; AR [1995-1996], 73), in which G. Di Stefano discusses the imports from the W Mediterranean, in A. Leho?rff (ed.), L'artisanat m?tallurgique dans les soci?t?s ancienne en M?diterran?e. Techniques, lieux et formes de production (Collection de l'?cole Fran?aise de Rome vol. 332) (Rome 2004), 211-27. Directly E is the hill-top town of M?dica, where there has been extensive work on the region's history in recent years, including the creation of a local historical journal, mentioned in the introduction, called Archivium Historicum Mothycense (some issues are available online at: http://web.tiscali.it/ enteliceoconvitto/). Two scholars in particular have been especially active in advancing knowledge: V.G. Rizzone and A.M. Sammito. hi Archivium Historicum Mothycense 3 (1997)</page><page sequence="30">152 FRANCO DE ANGELIS and 4 (1998), they summarize what is known archaeologically of M?dica from BA to Arab times. In Archivium Historicum Mothycense 5 (1999) and 7 (2001), they have compiled, respec tively, gazetteers of BA and LRom sites (the LRom gazetteer is reviewed by N. Cavallaro, Rivista di Archeologia Cristiana 80 [2004], 349-51). In SieArch xxxv.100 (2002), 137-49, they discuss BA tombs with decorated fa?ades. Elsewhere Sammito alone discusses the necropolis in contrada Mista (SicArch xxxii.97 [1999 (2001)], 87-104) and presents an overview of recent acquisitions of Neo material by the M?dica Museum (RSP 52 [2002], 345-66). G. Di Stefano, the indefatigable Superintendent of Ragusa province, has also made three contri butions to M?dica in this period: on synagogues, in G. Helmig et al. (eds), Third International Conference of Medieval and Later Archaeology (Hertingen 2002), 322-3; on Modica's Hel bronze statuette of Herakles found in contrada Cafeo in 1967, in Archivium Historicum Mothycense 10 (2004), 9-18; on a 'rupestrian' church, in La chiesetta rupestre di San Nicol? inferiore a M?dica (Ragusa 2005). The geography and history of M?dica is related to regions further to the E and S, and so it is not surprising to see M?dica featuring in thematic works that focus particularly on these neighbouring regions, such as, most notably in this reporting period: F.P. Rizzo (ed.), Di abitato in abitato. In itinere fra le piu antiche testimonianze cristiane degli Iblei. Atti del convegno internazionale di studi (Ragusa Catania, 3-5 aprile 2003), published as a special issue of the journal Seia 8-9 (2003-2004) (Pisa 2005). Here early Christianity is discussed with a wide range of sources, including archaeology, and from a wide range of perspectives: tombs, settlements, architecture, to name only some. The famous tombs and settlements in Cava d'Ispica, to the E of M?dica, are discussed in many of the works contained in this volume, as well as in three other recent works: G. Di Stefano and S. Fiorilla, CNAM III, 510-14; G. Di Stefano, in G. Volpe and M. Turchiano (eds), Paesaggi e insediamenti rurali in Italia m?ridionale fra Tardoantico e VAltomedioevo (Bari 2004), 667-74; E. Giannichedda, L. Lapadula and E. De Mini?is, Archeo xxi.7 (2005), 78-97, the latter a more general work devoted to the wider Mediterranean. For an earlier period, G. Di Stefano (SicArch xxxv.100 [2002], 125-35) reports on a season of excavation in 1982 at the EBA site in contrada Baravitalla at Cave d'Ispica, a site noted by Orsi in the E20th Ct. Here remains of a fortified village with huts has been discovered; some 50 tombs associated with this village were also explored. Most of the tombs were plundered long ago, though some ceramic finds were made. We now have further details of the so-called 'Api' farmstead on the right bank of the river Irminio, to the W of Sicicli: G. Di Stefano and M. Anelli, SicArch xxxiv.99 (2001), 31-50 (fleetingly mentioned in AR [1981-1982], 90). The farmstead was first constructed in the L5th Ct BC, but mainly used between about 400 and 250 BC. Its plan comprises six rooms, in addition to a courtyard and possible sacellum. Areas devoted to cooking and agricultural production have been detected on the basis of the ceramic and other finds made within them. This and other 4th Ct houses closer to Kamarina (and discussed in the last report: AR [2000-2001], 165-66) are helpfully collected and discussed by G. Di Stefano elsewhere (Due Dionisi, 93 115). At Marina di Ragusa, on the coast to the SW of this farmstead, what is thought to be a preparation pit for garum has been noted near the water's edge (V. Piazzese, Archeo xix.7 [2003], 10). The pit is cylindrical in shape and about 35cm deep; a worked stone lid was also found nearby. To the NE, midway between Ragusa and S. Croce Camerina, a new Byz farmstead has been discovered in contrada Costa (fleetingly mentioned in the previous report: AR [2000-2001], 169). More surface work has allowed corrections to be made to the previously published plan. The farmstead consists of five rooms over an area of more than 600m2 and may have been fortified with a tower. Messina thinks that this site must be one of the kastellia mentioned in the Cambridge Chronicle and connects it to the militarization of the Sicilian landscape in the 8th Ct AD due to Muslim incursions (on the latter theme, see also Messina's article in Sicilia Bizantina, 167-72). Messina also sees parallels with the so-called BA/IA anaktoron at Pantalica, which, as he has already urged (SicArch xxvi.82 [1993], 61-65), needs to be down-dated into the Byz period. The LMed village which gave its name to S. Croce Camerina was the subject of an exhibition in 2003, for which see the published catalogue: G. Di Stefano (ed.), // C?sale Sanctae Crucis de Rasacambra (Ragusa 2003). On the coast SW of S. Croce Camerina is the Byz village, often associated with Kaukana. In Sicilia Bizantina (173-90), G. Di Stefano attempts to identify the function of the various buildings and spaces, in the same kind of study he carried out in the previous reporting period (AR [2000-2001], 168-69). Elsewhere, Di Stefano (Archivio Storico Ibleo 2 [2000], 1-7) publishes a silver patera and cooking wares (in C. Bakirtzis [ed.], VIF Congr?s International sur la c?ramique m?di?vale en M?diterran?e, Thessaloniki, 11-16 octobre 1999 [Athens 2003], 505-08). P. Pelagatti, the original excavator, pro vides her reasons for the site's exploration and her rationale for identifying it with Kaukana, in F.P. Rizzo (ed.), Di abitato in abitato. In itinere fra le piu antiche testimonianze cristiane degli Iblei. Atti del convegno internazionale di studi (Ragusa Catania, 3-5 aprile 2003), published as a special issue of the journal Seia 8-9 (2003-2004) (Pisa 2005), 151-61. R.J.A. Wilson, in the volume just cited (163-67), expresses justified reservation of Pelagatti's identification, in addition to commenting on the dating of the church. Further along the coast to the NW, we have an update on the restoration of the Illyrian helmet found in the Punta Braccetto shipwreck (G. Di Stefano, Archeo xvii.ll [2001], 18-20; cf. AR [1987-1988], 70), as well as two attempts by G. Di Stefano to insert the helmet into a historical context: in F. Lenzi (ed.), L 'archeologia dell'Adri?tico dalla preistoria al Medioevo (Florence 2003), 209-12; in Alessandro il Molosso e i 'condottieri' in Magna Grecia. Atti del quarantatreesimo Convegno di studi sulla Magna Grecia, Taranto-Cosenza 26-30 setiembre 2003 (Taranto 2004), 579-82. At Kamarina, still further along the coast to the NW, we can begin by noting a new guidebook to the site: G. Di Stefano, Camarina: guida archeologica (Florence 2004). The anc. literary sources for Kamarina are collected and translated into Italian by M. Mattioli, Camarina citt? greca: la tradizione scritta (Milan 2002). Great strides have been made in this reporting period on publishing previously uncovered material. There has been much work on pottery. R. Salibra (BdA 120 [2002], 1-20) takes a first step in publishing the collection of the marquis Orazio Arezzo of Celano, who owned the land on which the Passa Marinaro necropolis excavated by P. Orsi stands. The collection, still in possession of the marquis' descendants, was put together by Orsi himself as a gesture of thanks to the marquis for facilitating his excavations. In this article, Salibra focuses on the collection's 5th Ct Attic rf (four column kraters, bell krater, two lekythoi and miniature hydria), and in doing so proposes attributions, dates and comparanda. In another study (BdA 133-34 [2005], 41-56), Salibra and F. Caruso publish a rf krater from the same necropolis from a later excavation by Pelagatti. The krater, which dates to the 3rd quarter of the 5th Ct, is attributed to the Orpheus Painter and bears a scene of Herakles and Eurytos engaged in an arrow</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001 -2005 153 shooting contest. Miniature pots from the Cl necropoleis are collected by G. Di Stefano, in B. Schmaltz and M. S?ldner (eds), Griechische Keramik im kulturellen Kontext (M?nster 2003), 38-46. M. Pisani (Kokalos 45 [1999 (2004)], 111-55) publishes five fragmentary mobile supports (lasa?a) for holding cooking pots over a fire, found in association with a kiln outside the NE perimeter of the city wall (Fig. 6). The material was found in pits dated to between the M5th and L4th Cts BC. Pisani draws comparisons with finds from other parts of the anc. Gr world, presenting a valuable overview of a class of object that all too rarely gets published. Pisani's interests in everyday life also extends to terracottas: see her article in BdA 123 (2003), 3-24, which includes examples from Kamarina and Syracuse of Ar and Cl date. A. Pautasso (CdA 36 [1997 (2002)], 47-59) makes a compelling case for Kamarina having been the place of production of the Biscari Kore in Catania. She dates the piece to the last quarter of the 6th Ct BC. P. Pelagatti (Studi De Miro, 515-32) brings together eighteen clay Ar-Cl antefixes thought to have come from Kamarina. The types include Silen, Gorgon, male and female heads, and palmette. The relationship between pottery and votive material, like pinakes, is explored by F. Giudice, in A. Cornelia and S. Mele (eds), Depositi votivi e culti delVItalia antica dalVet? arcaica a quella tardo-repubblicana. Atti del convegno di studi, Perugia, 1-4 giugno 2000 (Bari 2005), 703-11. A fascinating piece of stone sculpture of a Celtic shield has been published by A. Rapin (Germania 79 [2001], 273-96) (Fig. 7). The sculpture, in low relief, conforms to the norms of Cl Gr sculpture and appears on a s ne block (110cm /. by 60cm d.) found in 1958. The sculpture is dated on stratigraphie and iconographie grounds to the end of the 5th Ct BC. The block may have been built into a wall facing in the direction of Syracuse and documents materially the use of Celtic mercenaries in Sicily known from anc. literary sources. Mercenaries were often paid with coins, on which there have been two publications (of earlier discoveries) relating to Kamarina in this period: P. Pelagatti, AHN 48 (2001 [2003]), 259-66; T. Lucchelli and G. Di Stefano, Monete dall 'agora di Camarina. Campagne di scavo 1983-1995 (Milan 2004) (reviewed by S. Struffolino Kr?ger, RIN 106 [2005], 450-52). The extensive excavations in the Passa Marinaro necropolis continue to receive publication. R. Salibra (Kokalos 45 [1999 (2004)], 41-110) presents a preliminary analysis of 407 tombs excavated by Pelagatti in 1972-1973. The tombs date to the 5th to 3rd Ct BC (with some gaps, discussed below) and consist of various types under the general rubric of 'inhumation' (at least 85% of the grand total) and 'cremation' (at least 10% of the grand total). About 61% of all tombs contained grave-goods, generally made up of pottery; grave-goods were not numerous and average three items per tomb. Attic rf and black glaze make up the bulk of the imported pottery and include rf column kraters by the Bowdoin Painter, the Siracusa Painter, the Painter of London E489 and Canea Painter and black glaze skyphoi, pateras and lekythoi. Salibra's study also allows her to refine P. Orsi's chronology for this necropolis, since Orsi did not find any material datable to the first two decades of the 5* Ct. Salibra also notes that no material can be dated with certainty to two periods of Kamarina's history: 484-461 BC and the 1st half of the 4th Ct BC. These periods follow important moments in Kamarina's political history, on which there have been further recent studies. E.W. Robinson sees in Kamarina's lead plates a democracy in the 5th Ct, in V.B. Gorman and E.W. Robinson (eds), Oikistes: Studies in Constitutions, Colonies and Military Power in the Ancient World, offered in Honour of A.J. Graham (Leiden 2002), 61-77, and L. Del Monaco (Mediterr?neo 6.

See also F. Cordano and C. Grottanelli (eds), Sorteggio pubblico e cleromanzia dall'Antichit? all'et? moderna. Atti della tavola rotonda (Milan 2001). Democracy at Kamarina had well-known impacts on the countryside through land redistribution. A first attempt to gather the evidence for water-supply installations, so important to agriculture, is provided by G. Di Stefano, In binos actus lumina 1 (2002), 21-25. On Kamarina's 'Mesopotamium' wine, see G. Di Stefano, I Quaderni del Museo (Edizioni Comune di Vittoria) 5 (2004), 53-54. The impressive finds from the sea off Kamarina discussed in the previous report (AR [2000 2001], 166-7) have been rounded up in publications, all by G. Di Stefano, appearing in this period: SicArch xxxvi.101 (2003), 127-42; in A. Benini and M. Giacobelli (eds), Atti del II Convegno Nazionale di Archeologia Subacquea, Castiglionallo, 7-9 setiembre 2001 (Bari 2003), 147-55; in M. Giacobelli (ed.), Lezioni Fabio Faccenna. Conferenze di archeologia subacquea (III-V ciclo) (Bari 2004), 59-62. We also have further analysis of the Rom shipwreck 'Camarina A' (cf. AR [1995-1996], 71): G. Di Stefano, Da Thabraka a Camarina. L'ultimo viaggio. Notizie preliminari sul relitto delle colonne (Florence 2003). See also on this and the 'Randello' Rom wreck (cf. AR [1987-1988], 115): G. Di Stefano, in M. Khanoussi, P. Ruggeri and C. Vismara (eds), L'Africa romana: lo spazio marittimo del Mediterr?neo occidentale. Atti del XIV convegno di studio, Sassari, 7-10 dicembre 2000 (Rome 2002), 627-42. NNE of Kamarina, in contrada Paolina (midway between Ragusa and Kamarina), G. Di Stefano (Studi RiunioneBB, 1083-86) pro vides a brief report on the discovery of three EBA 'megalithic' tombs, whose plans are square (in two cases) and circular (in the other case). What makes all three tombs stand out in the Castelluccio cultural tradition is that their bases and walls were constructed in stone slabs, unlike at all the usual rock-cut chamber tombs of this period. For Comiso, to the N, we have the publication of an inscribed golden amulet found on the surface in the Rom bath-building (AR [1995-1996], 73). For the amulet: G. Di Stefano, RAL 14 (2003), 373-87; for the inscription, G. Bevilacqua and F. De Romanis, RAL 14 (2003), 389-402, who observe that the sixteen-line Gr text dates to the 5th Ct AD, and that it is an exorcistic prayer to Jahweh which, though containing Jewish traditions, is unique amongst known amulets and magical papyri. Just to the NW of Comiso is the native site at Castiglione, where most of the scholarship in this reporting period has engaged the spectacular 'Guerriero di Castiglione' sculpted relief found in 1999 (cf. AR [2000-2001], 167-68). A seminar, aimed at studying the relief closely, was devoted to this find in 2000 and published soon thereafter: F. Cordano and M. Di Salvatore (eds), II Guerriero di Castiglione di Ragusa. Greci e Siculi nella Sicilia sud-orientale. Atti del Seminario-Milano, 15 maggio 2000 (Hesperia vol. 16) (Rome 2002), with a detailed review by F. De Angelis, AWE 6 (2007), 375-78. One of the developments in this volume to highlight regards G. Di Stefano's report (17-49) on an excavation undertaken in the area of the sculpture's find-spot, which revealed eighteen tombs, all datable to the 1st quarter of the 6th Ct. On this basis, he dates the sculpture to the end of the 7th Ct/lst quarter of the 6th Ct BC. Among these tombs was found a 'princely' burial surrounded by a circular perimeter wall containing a tumulus. The burial was made in a fossa tomb with the rare acephalous rite, with six crania lining one end of the tomb. Di Stefano hypothesises that the sculpture once decorated the architrave of a door and belonged to an aristo cratic individual, perhaps linked to the land (judging from the iconography), who may have emigrated from a neighbouring Gr settlement to this native site in the Sicilian interior, whose sites are generally well known for their close ties with the Greeks and their mixed ethnic make-up. The epigraphists in the volume, especially F. Cordano (51-58), are also content with a date in the 1st half of the 6th Ct BC. The remainder of the volume sketches out the larger cultural context of the find, as well as attempting to tease out as much information as possible from the piece's inscription, iconography, and historical and artistic context. Some of views of Di Stefano and Cordano contained in this volume have been published elsewhere too: Kokalos 46 (2000 [2005]), 17-29; Archeo xvii.4 (2001), 18. We should also note G. Manganaro's (ZPE 128 [1999], 115-23) suggestion, missed in the last report, though made buried under an article title that gave no hint, that the word 2?YAOI inscribed on the 'Guerriero di Castiglione' monument, a word which is thought to be a personal name by the great majority of scholars, should actually be read as 2?YAON, meaning 'booty'. Manganaro goes on to connect this reading with Syracuse's extraction of tribute known from later history. Of other finds, G. Di Stefano has also published a bronze statuette (4.5cm h.) of a well known type in Sicily: a couple standing side by side touching each other's shoulders (Studi PreistoriciBB, 331-37; AA.VV., Atti della XXXVIIRiunione Scientifica dell'Istituto Italiano di Preistoria e Protostoria della Calabria [Florence 2004], 877 81). Although not found in a stratified context, Di Stefano dates the piece, via comparisons, to the 4th-3rd Ct BC and connects it to mercenaries from the Italian peninsula making a dedication in a local sanctuary. At two sites NE of Castiglione, Chiaramonte Gulfi (NW of which is the site usually identified as anc. Acrillae) and Scornavacche, there are two publications, both by G. Di Stefano, on, respectively, a votive funerary relief with banqueting scene of the 2nd Ct BC (SicArch xxxiii.98 [2000], 277-81) and medical instruments (Anthropos &amp; Iatria 8 [2004], 27-33). NORTHEAST SICILY Provinces of Messina and Catania There are two important developments to report for the archaeology of Catania province as a whole with which we must begin. The first is the catalogue of an exhibition organized by the Superintendency: F. Privitera and U. Spigo (eds), Dall'Alcantara agli Iblei. La ricerca archeologica in provincia di Catania. Guida alla mostra. Catania, Chiesa di S. Francesco Borgia 22 ottobre 2005-31 gennaio 2006 (Palermo 2005). (The exhibition was in fact extended into the summer of 2006.) The catalogue provides a much welcome overview from PH to Byz times and includes a brief history by U. Spigo (21-40) of archaeological research in what is today Catania province, from the time when it was part of the Siracusa Superintendency, through to the creation of its own Superintendency in 1987, to the present. The second development to note is a CD-ROM, also produced by the Suprintendency: M.G. Branciforti (dir.), hi?era. Siti archeologici della Provincia di Catania (Palermo 2001). The CD-ROM is organized into four main categories, all in four modern languages (French, English, Italian and German): 'Introduction', 'Bibliography', 'Topographical Selection' and 'Chronological Selection'. Both the exhibition catalogue and CD-ROM contain a wealth of information and images and are indispensable starting-points for anyone interested in the archaeology and history of Catania province from PH to Med times.</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001-2005 155 For the city of Catania, we begin with a work on the recent refurbishment of the Museo Civico a Castello Ursino by A.L. D'Agata and C. Guastella, II Museo Civico a Castello Ursino. Introduzione al nuovo ordinamento (Catania 2000). There are two general works to note: a reprinting of the 1925 Italian edition of A. Holm, Catania antica in 2003 in S.G. La Punta (CT) by the Gruppo Editorale Brancato, and a second edition of Catania. I quartiert della metr?poli, edited by R. D'Amico (Catania 2001). On natural history, especially earthquakes and the many eruptions of Mt Etna, an entire volume has been devoted to the subject: E. Boschi and E. Guidoboni (eds), Catania terremoti e lave dal mondo antico alla fine del Novecento (Rome 2001), with an essay on the anc. period by E. Guidoboni and A. Muggia (13-34). Two papers in another volume also explore the history of Mt Etna's activity: A.M. Duncan, D.K. Chester and J.E. Guest, in M.S. Balmuth, D.K. Chester and P.A. Johnston (eds), Cultural Responses to the Volcanic Landscape: The Mediterranean and Beyond (Archaeological Institute of America Colloquia and Conference Papers vol. 8) (Boston 2005) 57-69 and 93-107. The history of Catania's port to the present has been studied in A. Coco and E. Iachello (eds), IIporto di Catania: storia eprospettive (Siracusa 2003). Two papers deal with antiquity: E. Procelli (25-29) on PH and E. Tortorici (31-44) on the Graeco-Rom period. Both authors note the difficulties of reconstructing topography given the geomorphological changes that have occurred over the centuries, but nevertheless heroically push forward, taking the discussion as far as it can be. Elsewhere the latter author, E. Tortorici, provides an important summary of chance and systematic archaeological discoveries in the waters off Catania (Archeologia Subacquea 3 [2002], 275-334). Tortorici's study contains nineteen sites, both the well-known and not so well known ones. He concludes that anc. Catania had two ports: one used for commerce and the other for military/naval purposes. He hypothesizes that Acitrezza may have been used for landing and maintaining fishing boats in antiquity. Developments have also occurred for particular historical themes. M. Branciforti (Studi De Miro, 95-120) reports on excavations in the Hel-Rom levels in various parts of the city. The best preserved finds are those retrieved through excavations in the ex-monastery of San Nicol? 1'Arena, which allowed investigations to be conducted over a more extended area. Here a building with nineteen rooms has been exposed. Some of the rooms preserve simple cocciopesto pavements with traces of red colouring and geometric mosaics. Evidence exists for a partly porticoed courtyard (room C) and a peristyle house (rooms F-I). On Catania's Hel coinage, the influences of Rome and the E are traced by M. Casabona, RIN100 (1999), 13-46. A Rom house with frescoes and at least one simple opus sectile floor has been found in the Purit? district (near the university). At the time of writing, the photographs posted on the internet (at http://www.sudest.net/default.asp) that one could view in November 2004 have now been removed; therefore, we will have to await the publication of this discovery in future years. On the Rom amphitheatre, particu larly its reconstruction and restoration, we have C. Sposito, Anfiteatro romano di Catania: conoscere, recupero e valoriz zazione (Palermo 2003). G. Manganaro argues that the lamps of the Agyrinaioi, mentioned in the previous report (AR [2000 2001], 161), were not made in anc. Agyrion (mod. Agira in Enna province), as suggested by R. Wilson, in a study also mentioned in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 161), but at Catania itself (in AA.VV, Epigraphica: atti delle giornate di studio di Rome e diAtene in memoria di Margherita Guarducci (1902-1999) [Rome 2003], 135-40). LRom remains are collected and analysed for a group of islands NW of Catania by P. M?rchese, Isola Lachea e Faraglioni dei Ciclopi. Testimonianze di et? tardo romana (Catania 2000), while, back in Catania, there is a new guide to the 'Bonajuto' Byz chapel by A. Scifo and G. Flaccavento, Cappella Bonajuto: preziosa architettura bizantina a Catania (Catania 2005), available in both Italian and English editions (on this chapel, see also A. Tempio, ArchViva xxiv.112 [2005], 15). We may note next the developments for sites NW of Catania, along the S, W, and N slopes of Mt Etna. About 6km N of Catania, in the area of San Gregorio, we have the publication of archaeological finds, mostly PH, made in the Domenico Conti grotto (F. Alberghina and E. Procelli, SicArch xxxv.100 [2002], 113-23). There was an Israeli exhibition on the tetradrachms of anc. Aitna, the city (which one is uncertain): F. De Callat?y and H. Gitler, The Coin of Coins: A World Premiere (Jerusalem, 2004), also available online: http://www.imj.org.il/images/ exhibitions/2004/grid_b20.pdf (cf. also the same authors in Archeologia 412 [June 2004], 56-60). On a Temple of Demeter at the city-site of Aitna, see E. Galvagno, Studi Cataudella, 473-86. Close by in the region of Paterno, A. Pautasso (CdA 36 [1997 (2002)], 67-128) publishes material recovered from the surface in 1954 at Civita. The bulk of the material is made up of figured terracottas and pottery and dates to the end of the 5ih/lst half of the 4th Ct BC, and fills an important gap in our knowledge of craft production in Sicily in the two generations before Timoleon, to whom so much archaeological evidence is often wrongly attributed. It may have once belonged to a Sanctuary of Demeter and Persephone, on the basis of the tell tale terracottas of a female worshipper holding a piglet. Pautasso also throws her support behind earlier scholars who have identified the nearby settlement remains with anc. Inessa. From Paterno itself, there is an exhaustive study by G. Platz Horster, JDAI 118 (2003), 205-83, on the nine silver cups in Berlin discovered in 1909 at the foot of the Norman tower. Parallels are found with the ceramics of Tarentum and Apulia of the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC, thus making the Paterno finds the earliest example to date of W Gr silver. The silver seems to have changed hands on several occasions before being buried during the Second Punic War. At Adrano and environs, A. Franco (SicArch xxxii.97 [1999 (2001)], 199-210) identifies Mendolito with the anc. toponym 'Trinakie'. G. Lamagna (SicArch xxxii.97 [2000 (2001)], 221-46) publishes terracotta theatrical masks from Adrano itself, and S. Barresi (MEFRA 114 [2002], 611-53) provides a most useful collection and analysis of the figured Siceliot pottery found in Adrano's anc. city and countryside since the 19th Ct. Most of the material is without context, but can be dated to the 100 years spanning the M4th to the M3rd Ct BC. There are specimens from proto Siceliot painters, the Lentini-Manfria group, the Borelli group and the Etna group. Barresi leaves open, for lack of evidence, the question of how far his material was produced locally or at Syracuse. NE of Adrano, on the NW slopes of Mt Etna, we have news of the display of the archaeological collection of Baron Vagliasindi of Randazzo in the city's Med castle. The material, which includes Cor, Ionic and Attic rf pottery, as well as a Phoenician glass pasted vase, terracotta statuettes and Hel gold jewellery, was excavated by the Baron in a necropolis on his estate (Archeo xviii.3 [2002], 23). We turn next to the plain of Catania and to the many sites known in river valleys. For Palagonia, we have the publication, missed in the previous report, of the results of a topographic survey conducted in the surrounding fields: L. Sapuppo, Alle origini. La presenza umana nel territorio di Palagonia (Palagonia 1998). 26 sites, stretching in date from PH to Byz times, have been recorded. The EIA and Hel period are poorly attested so far in the region. Sapuppo suspects that</page><page sequence="34">156 FRANCO DE ANGELIS Palagonia did not properly belong to the territory of a Gr city and that, at best, it may have been part of the eschatia of either Gela or Leontinoi. PH remains of particularly the Copper Age found at Dosso Tamburaro near Militello uncovered through excavation are discussed by B. McConnell (Studi De Miro, 489-98; cf. also on the larger regional context McConnell's contribution in Studi RiunioneBB, 225-38). W of Militello, in the region of Mineo, R. Belfiore (SicArch xxxiii.98 [2000 (2001)], 259-76) discusses the Hellenized native settlement on Piano dei Casazzi, in particular the evidence for a possible chthonic cult connected with a nearby necropolis, and we have a full report of work on the Sanctuary of the Palici at Rocchicella di Mineo mentioned in the last report (AR [2000 2001], 170) by L. Maniscalco and B.E. McConnell, AJA 107 (2003), 145-80. The evidence now supports earlier hypotheses regarding a religious function for the structures, which, besides the temple mentioned in the previous report, includes a stoa with mud-brick altar and libation area in one of its rooms. W of Mineo are the Monti Algar, an area covering some 200km2 between the rivers Tempio-Petrarossa and Caltagirone-Mari. F. Nicoletti's (SicArch xxxiii.98 [2000 (2001)], 105-27) survey here emphasizing the EBA revealed 34 sites. At Grammichele and environs, to the S, there has been much scholarly activity in recent years, including the opening of an archaeological park at the old town site of Occhiol? (destroyed by that terrible earthquake of 1693), for which see E. Costanzo (ed.), Grammichele: il parco archeologico di Occhiol? e valle dei Margi (Catania 2000); A. Patan? et al., Nuovi materiali da Terravecchia (Grammichele 2001). These booklets provide up-to-date overviews of the region's archaeo logical remains, first investigated by P. Orsi in the 1880s. One of the discoveries made by Orsi has received attention in this period, namely a bronze cista with a fragmentary lid containing a scene in relief of deer (M. Micozzi, Prospettiva 102 [2001], 32-36). Even though Orsi noted the piece's N Italian connection, he believed that the piece was made in Gr Leontinoi. Micozzi, however, is able to relate the cista to developments since Orsi's time and notes that the cista must have been made somewhere in the Golasecca culture area in the L6th/E5th Ct BC, further wondering if such objects from elsewhere in Sicily also came therefrom. There are also some new excavations at the anc. site to report (M. Barra Bagnasco, Orizzonti 2 [2001], 27-35,46-7). On Poggio del Rullo, a team from Turin in collaboration with the Catania Superintendency brought to light material of the 6th to 3rd Ct BC in contexts contaminated with Med and mod. material. Parts of a rectangular building, possibly used for religious purposes, were also revealed. Further to the N, at the EIA site at Madonna del Piano, we have three studies to report: the first on the pottery found in the necropolis by R.M. Albanese Procelli, SicArch xxxiii.98 (2000 [2001]), 167-80; the second on metallurgy by F. Lo Schiavo, R.M. Albanese Procelli and A. Giumlia-Mair, in A. Giumlia-Mair (ed.), / bronzi antichi: produzione e tecnolog?a (Montagnac 2002), 76-88; and the third on the site's cultural connections with Calabria by R.M. Albanese Procelli and F. Lo Schiavo, in Atti della XXXVII Riunione Scientifica dell Tstituto Italiano di Preistoria e Protostoria della Calabria (Florence 2004), 403-20. Almost due W of Grammichele is Caltagirone, where we have a new guide: Caltagirone (Itinerari dei musei, gallerie, scavi e monumenti d'ltalia vol. 63) (Rome 2002). On the anc. period in particular, D. Seminerio (Magna Graecia [Cosenza] xxxvii.3-4 [2003], 29-30) finds further support for his theory that Morgantina is to be located at Caltagirone (cf. Morgantina a Caltagirone e altre ipotesi di identificazione degli antichi abitati dei Margi [Catania 1975]). Seminerio draws on an inscribed (and now lost) 'dagger' found in an 'a cappuccina' tomb in 1841 during construction of the public garden. The Baron of Carioto published the 'dagger' soon after in a local history. Seminerio's revisit of this find leads him to suggest that it was probably a bronze strigil, judging by the overall contents of the tomb, and that its inscription reads better, not as 'Enna', but as 'EYNA' - none other than the personal name of the leader of the famous slave revolt in the 2 Ct BC, who was taken to Morgantina and buried there following his death. We also have another contribution (cf. AR [2000-2001], 171) by M. Frasca on the burials from the anc. site located at Monte San Maura, to the SW of Caltagirone, in BdA 117 (2001), 1-26. Frasca focuses on a group of four aristocratic tombs of the 6th Ct BC. The tombs were isolated from the others in the necropolis and contain high status objects, particularly metalwork and pottery. Tomb 164, which belonged to a young woman, was the most conspicuous, standing out by the number and quality of finds placed in a specially built hypogeum. Many of the finds can be paralleled with works from Samos, causing Frasca to wonder whether the woman herself hailed from this island. In the environs of Ramacca, NE of Caltagirone, we have two studies on the EBA village in contrada Torricella at the NW foot of the 'Montagna': S. Agodi et al., Bollettino dell 'Istituto dell'Accademia Gioenia di Scienze Naturali in Catania 33 (2000), 17-30; E. Procelli et al., in R. Laffineur, E. Warmenbo and J. Driessen (eds), Actes du XIV Congr?s UISPP, Universit? de Li?ge, Belgique, 2-8 septembre 2001/Acts of the XIVth UISPP Congress, University of Li?ge, Belgium, 2-8 September 2001. Section 11: Age du bronze en Europe et en M?diterran?e/Section 11: Bronze Age in Europe and the Mediterranean (BAR International Series vol. 1337) (Oxford 2005), 241-45. On transport amphorae from earlier excavations in the Ar and Cl site on the summit and nearby plateau of the same 'Montagna', see R.M. Albanese Procelli (Studi De Miro, 37-50). The amphorae consist mostly of Cor Ar types, but there are also types from other parts of the Gr world (for example: Attic, N Aegean, E Gr and W Gr), as well as the non-Gr world (Etruscan, Punic and so-called Levantine). On the Neo in the mid and lower Simeto valley, E of Ramacca, see L. Maniscalco (Studi RiunioneBB, 963-68). For Naxos in the NE corner of the circum-Etna region, there has been the usual combination, as in previous reporting periods, of new explorations and the study of older material, led by Naxos' highly energetic scholar, M.C. Lentini. One of her initiatives involves an exhibition and seminar on the two cities of Naxos, both leading to publications edited by her: The Two Naxos Cities: A Fine Link between the Aegean Sea and Sicily. Exhibition 14-30 June 2001, University of Athens, 6-31 July 2001, Archaeological Museum of the Island of Naxos (Palermo 2001); Le due citt? di Naxos. Atti del seminario di studi, Giardini Naxos, 29-31 ottobre 2000 (Florence 2004). Elsewhere Lentini (Studi Cristofani, 73-79) discusses the few items of jewellery in precious metals found at Naxos. These items consist of a pair of 'a grappolo' gold ear-rings and three sprial bracelets in silver, and come from inhumation burials that are datable from the L7th/lst half of the 6th Ct BC. Lentini also observes how ear-rings were usually made in silver. Lentini (?g?is und Mittelmeer, 425-28) has also published a Middle Wild Goat I oinochoe and an overview of Naxos in the 1st half of the 4th Ct BC (Due Dionisi, 223-41), which consists of coins, tombs and a suburban cult area with nearby pottery workshop. This same period is the focus of M. Rossi's publication (RIN 106 [2005], 431-34) of two coins in Berlin. Both coins depict Apollo, and for both we know nothing of their find contexts. The Rom and Byz periods at Naxos have not gone neglected in recent years. It is again thanks to the efforts of M.C. Lentini</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001-2005 157 that we have another exhibition with catalogue: Naxos di Sicilia in et? romana e bizantina ed evidenze dai Peloritani: catalogo mostra archeologica, Museo di Naxos, 3 dicembre 1999-3 gennaio 2000 (Bari 2001). To be noted is the publication for the first time of the various phases of a L Imperial granary, not to mention the general collection and discussion of all the relevant material for the region's Rom and Byz occupation. In connection with the new work at Naxos, more excavations have taken place in the dockyards (cf. AR [2000 2001], 174). D. Blackman, one of the collaborators, writes: 'After a series of tests had confirmed the identification of Gr walls at Naxos as those of the anc. dockyard, a first full season of excavation was carried out in 2001. A preliminary report has been published in Blackman and Lentini (2003). Naxos was the first Gr colony in Sicily (founded 734 BC), and was destroyed by Dionysios of Syracuse in 403 BC for having sided with Athens in the war that had just ended. A series of three seasons of excavation has been carried out since 2003 with EU funding by the Archaeological Service of the Soprintendenza of Messina, directed by Maria Costanza Lentini in collaboration with David Blackman; a final short season will be held this coming summer. Four shipsheds have so far been identified, aligned on the 5th Ct city plan (Fig. 8). One priority last year was therefore to define the relationship of the shipsheds as a public architectural complex to the city street plan: a main N S cross-street (stenopos 6: unusually wide at 6.40m) lies just to the W of the back wall of the shipsheds We tried to delineate the relationship between street and dockyard, but the Cl Gr levels have been destroyed by eep levels of LRom occupation of the site. The northernmost shipshed (no. 1) was excavated in 2001, cut in the bedrock; its N wall was clearly the outer wall of the building, with what appears to be an unroofed slipping area beyond. In 2003-2004 two more slipways (nos 2-3) were extensively excavated. Here we made the surprising discovery of ramps of sand in the upper part of the slipways, apparently continued lower down by cobbled ramps. The sand ramps were built on the bedrock, and lined with low stone retaining walls; the ramps were re-surfaced and the retaining walls raised from time to time within the 5th Ct BC, and we are now inclined, after studying the stratified pottery, to date the early phases before 450 BC. A fine stretch of paving was found on the S side of shipshed 2, between the retaining wall of the ramp and the main shipshed wall 3 (Blackman and Lentini 2006a: 194, fig. 6). The top (W) end of this ramp has just been excavated: it had already been uncovered for a length of 15m, and its total surviving length now measures over 16m. The ramp ends just before, and its retaining wall and the paved side-passage end at, the E edge of a platform 1.80m w. at the back of the shipshed; a damaged platform was found at the back of shipshed 1 in 2001, but we are now able to reconstruct the back end of shipshed 1 by analogy with shipshed 2, where the situation is clearer despite the damage along its N side discovered in 2004 and again in 2005, caused by LRom pits and stone-robbing. On neither shipshed platform did we find any evidence for hauling equipment. The surprising feature of the sequence of sand ramps is that in the later (last?) phase(s) they are no longer central and 3.50m-3.65m w. but narrower (2.20/2.35 2.60/2,70m) and displaced by about 40cm to the S (Blackman and Lentini 2006a: 194-96); the S retaining wall remains on the same line, and it is the N retaining wall which is displaced. Excavation at the end of last season concentrated on the upper parts of shipsheds 3 and 4, where a strikingly similar arrangement was found, different from that in shipsheds 1 and 2: the ramps of the final phase had a curving end, adapted to the stern of a ship, with indications of a possibly shorter ramp in an earlier phase. An interesting discovery in 2004 was patches of 8. Naxos: overview of dockyards excavations red colouring in shipshed 3, on the surface of the middle phase of the ramp of the three identified, and on the bedrock of the S side-passage, about 6.80m from the back wall. One sample has been analysed and identified as iron oxide which has a natural red colour (haematite) (results of analyses conducted by Konsorzio Kavaklik-Roma: Blackman and Lentini 2006a: 196 97, fig. 7). As with lead oxide, minium, this pigment could have been used to paint ships. Much more evidence was found in 2005, with red pigment also found adhering to the inside of amphora body sherds and the first evidence of blue pigment in shipshed 3; the lump has not yet been analysed, but blue was another colour used on ancient ships. Clearly ships were being painted in these shipsheds We are now uncovering the E continuation of shipshed 4 and its S wall (wall 5), under many phases of Rom walls and rubble. Poorly preserved remains of the sand ramp were found in the last days of last season. We have not had the space to establish clearly whether there was a further shipshed beyond to the S; we are impeded by the thick walls of an Emod. mill. But there are some indications that wall 5 was an outside wall: in this case the dockyard had 4 shipsheds - appropriate for the small fleet of a medium-sized Gr city which was never a major maritime power. Ramps of earth have been identified at Kerkyra and at Kition, and at Syracuse (Baika 2003; Yon 2000; Basile 2002). This is clear evidence that the shipsheds concerned were roofed. At Naxos (as at Kition) we also have the evidence of roof tiles, but no evidence for the form of roof support. Bibliography. Baika, K. (2003) Neosoikoi. Installations navales en M?diterran?e.

At Taormina, just further N of Naxos, we have an account by the late L. Bernab? Brea (QuadMess 1.1 [2000 (2001)], 59 106) of the restoration undertaken on the famous theatre between 1949 and 1956. U. Spigo and M. Triscari (AISCOM IX, 399-418) publish the mosaic pavements of the Rom Imperial domus that came to light in 2002 during the construc tion of a multi-level parkade at Porta Pasquale, located less than 500m from the theatre. The structure contains five rooms aligned in an E-W manner and dates to just after Augustus' establishment of the colony. There are remains of 'cocciopesto rubricato' in one room and of wall-paintings in three other rooms. R.J.A. Wilson (Studi ClassiciBB, 247-74) studies a dozen house-tombs on the outskirts of the Rom city. These tombs have been long known, but neglected until Wilson's study, who observes that most of them were probably constructed in the 2nd Ct AD and that the presence of niches implies cremation as the rite for their middle-class users. NW of Taormina, in the interior, is Francavilla di Sicilia, whose previously uncovered anc. remains have been further studied in this reporting period. In Studi De Miro (643-63) U. Spigo summarizes the two decades of archaeological work, noting that we are still poorly informed about the pre-contact native period. Later occupation can be divided into two phases: one covering most of the 6th Ct BC, and the other covering most of the following century. Elsewhere Spigo (BdA 111 [2000], 1 60; BdA 113 [2000], 1-78) has extensively discussed the well known pinakes. The 118 coins recovered from the site are published by A. Carb? (Studi De Miro, 181-202). The coins range in date from the 5th Ct BC to mod. times, but most date from the end of the 4th to the M3rd Ct BC and mostly come from sites in NE Sicily, as well as from Rhegion and Syracuse. Carb? also observes that Rom and Byz coins are practically absent. For Messina, in the NE corner of Sicily, the most important single development to report is the complete publication of the exhibition and catalogue 'Da Zankle a Messina' mentioned in the last report (AR [2000-2001], 171): G. Bacci and G. Tigano (eds), Da Zancle a Messina: un percorso archeologico attraverso gli scavi, 2 vols in 3 pts (Messina 1999-2002 [2000 2003]). This is a major achievement which constitutes, needless to say, a major boost in our understanding of the city and region in antiquity, and which has already caused scholars to rethink the history of the whole area. The Gr portions of this exhibition were put on display in the National Museum in Reggio Calabria during the second half of 2001, for which a catalogue has also appeared: G.M. Bacci and G. Tigano (eds), Dall'altra parte dello Stretto. Zancle-Messina (VIII-Isec. a.C.) (Messina 2001). If anything, this is yet another reminder of how both sides of the straits of Messina were linked in antiquity, just as they are today, which we are informed about in a recent large and scholarly volume published by the lobby group seeking the construction of a bridge across these straits: F. Ghedini, J. Bonetto, A.R. Ghiotto and F. Rinaldi (eds), Lo stretto di Messina nell 'antichit? (Rome 2005). Two other works linking both sides of the straits in antiquity have also appeared in this period: B. Gentili and A. Pinzone (eds), Messina e Reggio nell'antichit?: storia, societ?, cultura. Atti del Convegno della S.I.S.A.C (Messina-Reggio Calabria 24-26 maggio 1999) (Messina 2002); S. Accardo et al, Il profilo degli dei a Rhegion e Zancle Messana/The Profile of the Gods in Rhegium and Zancle Messana (Messina 2004), the latter a catalogue from a 2004 exhibition. While the latter three works focus primarily on the well-documented Gr and Rom periods, it is important to remember, as becomes evident in reading all recent publications on the region, that the straits of Messina's crucial role as a crossroads extends well into prehistory. For instance, excavations have revealed a Neo settlement at C?maro, just S of Messina (G.M. Bacci, J. Caramuta and M.C. Martinelli, Studi RiunioneBB, 839-42), a BA site on the Via La Farina in Messina itself (G.M. Bacci et al, Origini 11 [1998-2000 (2000)], 195-250) and a LBA/EIA settlement on Monte Tidora, in the hills behind the city (U. Spigo and M.C. Martinelli, Studi RiunioneBB, 899-902). On the pre-Gr situation, both in Messina and as far W along the coast as Caronia, see also the following two works: M.C. Martinelli and U. Spigo (eds), Tra i Peloritani e i Nebrodi prima dei Greci (Lipari 2000); C. Bonanno, SicArch xxxiii.98 (2000), 75-86. On the topography of the EGr city, we have two contributions by M. Gras and G.M. Bacci in the just cited volume edited by Gentili and Pinzone, Messina e Reggio nell'antichit? (13-24 and 25-46, respectively). The evidence now allows us to gauge the overall extent and basic layout of the city, though the dimensions of city blocks remain unknown. Gras sees a hiatus between the BA and Gr periods and notes that no preceding conditions seem to have shaped the organization of the polis of Zankle. The Gentili and Pinzone volume contains a wealth of mostly (historical) studies, to which we can add some others. On Gr and Latin inscriptions, we have the first volume of a projected multi-volume publication by I. Bitto, Le iscrizioni greche e latine di Messina (Messina 2001). On the Euboeans in Calabria, see now L. Mercuri, Eub?ens en Catabre ? l'?poque archa?que (BEFAR vol. 321) (Rome 2004) (reviewed by D. Ridgway, JRA 19 [2006], 375-80). On the discord between Zankle's two oikists in the literary sources, A. Jannucci (Sileno 24 [1998], 173-79) argues that this was a very public affair between different factions (in a study missed in the last report). G. Tigano (Studi De Miro, 665-70) publishes an arula depicting a zoomachia from block Z in the Ar city, from what seems to have been the courtyard of a house. She argues that it was probably made in Locri in the last quarter of the 6th Ct BC. Archaeometric analysis carried out on 25 clay specimens (tile, arulae and pottery) revealed a local origin for most, including the specimens of so-called 'Chalcidian' pottery: G. Barone et al, in V. Kilikoglou, A. Hein and Y. Maniatis (eds), Modern Trends in Scientific Studies on Ancient Ceramics (BAR International Series vol. 1011) (Oxford 2002), 219-25. G. Millino considers the coinage of the tyrant Anaxilaos, in L. Braccesi (ed.), Hesperia XIV (Roms 2001) 105-40. Tyche/Fortune coins are studied by M. Caccamo Caltabiano (Studi De Miro, 139-49). L. Campagna (Studi De Miro, 167-79) publishes an Ionic capital in the Messina Museum. While its find-spot is unknown, Campagna suggests that it dates to the M3rd Ct BC, and that it may have once belonged to a private dwelling. This capital takes us down into the period of transition to the Rom Empire. C. Bonanno (SicArch xxxiv.99 [2001], 175-82) publishes a funerary altar, of L Neronian/E Flavian date, found in 1952 in the via Cesare Battisti. L. De Salvo (Studi De Miro, 271-74) draws together the evidence of Keay LII amphorae on both sides of the straits of Messina, thereby illuminating the wine trade. There is a most useful round-up by M. A. Mastelloni (AISCOMIX, 419-40) of the mosaic finds made over the years in Messina. Some of these mosaics came to light following the many earthquakes Messina has suffered over the centuries. For a possible earthquake in the straits of Messina in the 4th Ct AD, see E. Guidoni, A. Muggia and G. Valensise, in W.G. McGuire</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001-2005 159 et al. (eds), The Archaeology of Geological Catastrophes (London 2000), 45-70. The next developments to report move us into the Norman period. We begin with a general work: G.M. Bacci and A.M. Mastelloni (eds), I Normanni nel sud/The Normans in the South (Messina 2003). G. Scibona (CNAMIII, 504-09) reports on excavations undertaken at the 'Muncipio', while C. Filangeri (Sicilia Bizantina, 593-609) turns to archival material to discuss two no longer extant Norman churches. The conservation of the mosaics in the Norman cathedral is discussed by G. Bernardi in two papers (AISCOM VI, 439-50; AISCOM VII, 595-608). There are several developments to report for Milazzo, the long and narrow peninsula to the W of Messina city. Evidence of PH activity continues to grow (see A. Vanzetti, Studi RiunioneBB, 345-65; G. Tigano, Studi RiunioneBB, 889-93; ST. Levi et al, Studi RiunioneBB, 895-98; M.C. Martinelli and G. Tigano, ASP 55 [2005], 550-51). A helpful round-up of burial between the 8th and 1st Cts BC has appeared: G. Tigano (ed.), Le necropoli di Mylai: VIII-I sec. a.C: catalogo (Milazzo 2002). Elsewhere Tigano (Studi ClassiciBB, 281-94) has collected her thoughts on the topography of the Gr and Rom city, noting that no evidence has so far come to light for EGr presence on the heights today home to the Norman-Swabian castle. The earliest evidence dates only to the 4th Ct BC, leading her to wonder whether the anc. Gr city developed at the foot of these heights. Tigano speculates that the very tip of the peninsula may have had a military outpost in Ar and Cl times, but calls for more work to clarify the overall topography of this area. There are notes too on the Hel and Rom periods. For the latter, A. Olla (Studi ClassiciBB, 237-46) publishes the Italian and Eastern sigillata pottery from excavations in the early 1990s in zona Ciantro. SW of Milazzo, along the Torrente Patri, is an area rich in archaeological finds. Near the small town of Rod!, on Monte Gonia, we have the preliminary report of the excavation of a Hel farmstead (A. Siracusano, B. Campagna and D. Falcone, QuadMess 1.2 [2000 (2001)], 5-40). Some structural remains were uncovered, as well as a cistern and three tombs in rectangular fossae covered with stone slabs. Floral and faunal material was also retrieved. Directly S, at anc. Longane near mod. Milici, there is the definitive publication of excavations undertaken by the late L. Bernab? Brea and G.F. Carettoni (QuadMess 1.1 [2000 (2001)], 7-57) in the L 1940s and E 1950s. This posthumous study by the two men directly involved in this work is an important contribution for posterity. There has also been a topographic survey of some 23km2 on land belonging to both Rodi and Milici (B. Campagna, Studi De Miro, 151-66). The finds date from the BA to the Rom Imperial period. The IA settlement accompanying the native necropolis on Monte Gonia could not be identified. Gr material first appears in the M6th Ct BC, and in general the Gr presence is probably to be connected with small fortified sites in what must have been a frontier zone at this time (cf. F. De Angelis, PBSR 68 [2000], 131). Four small farmsteads of Hel and Rom date also came to light. Campagna ends by rightly calling for further work in this area. NW of the Rodi and Milici area, an important gap in the regional sequence has been partially filled with the discovery of a BA site at Terme Vigliatore (so far a brief notice has appeared: A. Oll? and G. Tigano, RSP 55 [2005], 549-50). In the interior, almost due S, is mod. Tripi, in whose environs anc. Abakainon/Abacaenum is usually located. G.M. Bacci (Studi ClassiciBB, 223-36) publishes two small lead heads of EHel date found in earlier excavations in the cemeteries (cf. AR [2000-2001], 171-72). The heads are both of theatrical subjects, probably the Therapon pappos and the Tettix, and the only evidence so far that can be connected with a cult of Dionysus. Since 2002 survey work in both city and country has also been undertaken by G.F. La Torre (Sicilia Antiqua 1 [2004], 117, n. 37). Preliminary results have yet to be published. There is much to report for anc. Tyndaris on the coast to the NW. D. Musti (Sicilia Antiqua 1 [2005], 141-43) examines the origins of the city's name, arguing that it belongs to the political and spatial strategies of the kingdom of Dionysius I of Syracuse. Two overviews of the city's archaeology and history have also been published: M. Mollica, Tindari: dalla citt? greca al culto della Madonna ?era (Messina 2000); U. Spigo (ed.), Tindari: Varea archeologica e Vantiquarium (Milazzo 2005). On Tyndaris between Cl and Rom times, O. Belvedere and E. Termine (Studi de Waele, 85-91) examine the orthogonal town plan, regarding it as the apex of Sicilian urbanism, and G.F. La Torre (Sicilia Antiqua 1 [2004], 111-46) devotes a lengthy and important study to the 'Romanization' of Tyndaris, arguing generally that absolute dating has paid little or no attention to archaeological contexts, preferring to rely on the general historical narrative. This leads La Torre to date Tyndaris' urban plan and fortifications, not to Dionysius I, but to Agathokles, if not later. The theatre is considered a LHel structure of around 100 BC, and the houses in insula IV to this same period, if not slightly earlier. La Torre thinks that the settlement founded by Dionysius I was probably nothing more that a small fortified village of a purely military character. The site and antiquarium at Patti Marina, just W of Tyndaris, has a guidebook produced in this period: AA.VV, Patti Marina: il sito archeologico e Vantiquarium (Patti n.d.). At Capo d'Orlando, further W on the coast, a new antiquarium was inaugurated in December 2002. In connection with this event, the opportunity was seized to survey what is known of the archaeology and history of the region from PH to Byz times: U. Spigo (ed.), Archeologia a Capo d'Orlando. Studi per VAntiquarium (Milazzo 2004). The new excavations mentioned in this work were reported in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 172). The archaeological work carried out at San Marco d'Alunzio between 1970 and 2000 went on display in an exhibition held in the town in the second half of 2005. A catalogue appeared soon after: AA.VV, Da Alunzio a San Marco: indagini archeologiche dal 1970 al 2000 (Palermo 2006). The finds, mostly artefacrual though some structural too, cover PH to mod. times. For Caronia (anc. Kaleakte), further along the coast to the W, we have a preliminary report of Sicilian-Swedish excavations undertaken here between 1999 and 2001: M.C. Lentini, K. G?ransson and A. Lindhagen, Opuscula Romana 11 (2002), 79-108. Most of the results were discussed in last report (AR [2000-2001], 172). For anc. Halaisa near the town of Tusa, at the W end of Messina province, there are three studies to report. Two of them are by A.M. Prestianni Giallombardo as part of her ongoing work on the Tabulae Halaesinae: in Atti elimi IV (1059-1103), she collects the evidence for divinities and cults attested in the city, and in Minima Ephigraphica et Papyrologica vii-viii.9-10 (2004-2005), 229-48 she discusses watercourses in the territory (which has also had a preliminary air photography investigation in this period: O. Belvedere etal,Agri Centuriati 1 [2004], 199? 215). The third study consists of two notes by G. Scibona (Studi De Miro, 599-603) on IG xiv.352. We also have a preliminary study by M.A. Mastelloni on pavements uncovered by A. Salinas in 1912 in Tusa itself, in F. Guidobaldi and A. Paribeni (eds), Atti del Will colloquio dell 'Associazione Italiana per lo Studio e la Conservazione del Mosaico (Firenze, 21-23 febbraio 2001) (Ravenna 2001), 689-720. Mastelloni dates one of these pavements to the 3rd Ct BC, and the other to the 2nd half of 3rd Ct AD, with possibly an earlier phase around the 1st Ct AD.</page><page sequence="38">160 FRANCO DE ANGELIS In the Aeolian islands, to the N of the Messina province's mainland, there has been much work, in part the result of the outpouring of studies dedicated to the late L. Bernab? Brea. We begin with studies devoted to all or large parts of the Aeolian islands. More volumes have appeared in the Meligunis Lip?ra series created by Bernab? and M. Cavalier, and populated with studies by them and their numerous collaborators: Meligunis Lip?ra IX: Topograf?a di Lipari in et? greca e romana, in 2 pts (Palermo 1998); Meligunis Lip?ra XI: gli scavi nella necropoli greca e romana di Lipari nell 'area del terreno vescovile, in 2 pts (Palermo 2001) (reviewed by D. Ridgway, Classical Review 54 [2004], 214-15); Meligunis Lip?ra XII: le iscrizioni greche e latine delle isole Eolie (Palermo 2003). On maritime topography and archaeology, from PH to Rom times, we have a study by E.F. Castagnino Berlinghieri, The Aeolian Islands: Crossroads of the Mediterranean Routes (BAR International Series vol. 1181) (Oxford 2003), reviewed by C. Calcagno, UNA 34 (2005), 163-64. On the structure of MBA and LBA settlements, see C. Albore Livadie et al, Studi RiunioneBB, 113-42. For the alphabet, onomastics and dialect of the Aeolian islands in the anc. Gr period, see the study by L. Dubois, REG 118 (2005), 214-28. Forty years of p?trographie work, already published in the pages of various Meligunis Lip?ra volumes, are surveyed by ST. Levi and J.L. Williams (Studi PreistoriciBB, 265-304; Studi RiunioneBB, 987-90). On pre-20th Ct German scholars and travellers to the islands, there is a piece by H. Blanck in Studi ClassiciBB (25-34). The contribution of the mod. Aeolian dialect to local natural history is explored by P. Lo Cascio and S. Pasta (Archeologia Eoliana, 131-51). For the island of Lipari, research begins in the Neo period with M.C. Martelli's publication (Archeologia Eoliana, 9-28) of the lithics from the village in contrada Diana. E.F. Castagnino Berlinghieri (Studi RiunioneBB, 1043-48) discusses the EBA shipwreck of Pignatoro di Fuori, found in the waters off Monte Rosa, NE of the Lipari town-site. This is the oldest known BA wreck site, containing pottery and raw material. The question of exchange with Lipari is raised as a result of L. Vagnetti's publication (Studi PreistoriciBB, 261 64) of a Myc kylix fragment from the contrada Diana necropolis of later date. Although the fragment is quite small and without context, Vagnetti hypothesizes a date of LH IIIA1. On the Ar Gr foundation, M. Gras (Studi ClassiciBB, 11-16) moves beyond the well-trodden issues and approaches to this period, putting Lipari's foundation into a wider political and economic context. Most of his attention is devoted to speculating on the names and number of oikists, for which he concludes that the replacement of Pentathlos with three oikists was meant to represent each of the three dimensions of the dead oikist's rich personality. M.A. Mastelloni (Studi ClassiciBB, 169-200) examines the beginnings of Lipari's bronze coinage in the 3rd quarter of the 5th Ct BC, suggesting that it was minted to celebrate a successful victory or acquisition. On the so called 'slave' necropolis, there was an exhibition in 2001, with the following catalogue: A. Sardella and M.G. Vanar?a (eds), Lipari: la necropoli degli schiavi in contrada Portinenti (Palermo 2001). A. Langella and M. Langella (Archeologia Eoliana, 153-56) discuss a iron item found in a male tomb in the Gr and Rom necropolis. The object, discovered along with a strigil, was folded like a 'W' and has two discs at either end, leading the Langella duo to speculate whether it was used for a pelvis/hip or shoulder sport injury. U. Spigo (Archeologia Eoliana, 29-54) explores the ceramic relationship between Lipari and Locri via a bell krater from the contrada Diana necropolis. Dancing figures on pottery and terracottas of the 4th and 3rd Cts BC are examined by A. Sardella (Studi ClassiciBB, 73-89), while bronze mirrors with handles in relief decoration of these same centuries are the subject of a paper by M.G. Vanar?a (Studi ClassiciBB, 91-101). In another study by A. Sardella (Archeologia Eoliana, 55-63), the focus is on pinakes depicting horsemen dating to around 300 BC. The catalogue of an exhibition on Sicily's theatrical masks, particularly those of Lipari, are studied in G.M. Bacci and U. Spigo (eds), Prosopon Persona. Testimonianze del teatro antico in Sicilia (Lipari 2002). On a related topic, terracotta potraits of the 1st half of the 3rd Ct BC, there is a study by the late Bernab? Brea and M. Cavalier, / ritratti greci nelle terrecotte liparesi della prima meta del III sec?lo a.C. (Rome 2000). The recovery of archae ological finds at the Banco del Bagno, in the SW waters around Lipari, is reported by V. Agnesi et al (Archeologia Subacquea 3 [2002], 187-207). The finds consist of 21 amphorae (of mostly Hel and Rom date), dolia, anchors, a millstone, a lead plaque (for protecting the ship's sheathing), a copper nail and lead fistulae. Similar material of a similar date has been recovered from another underwater site ('Le forbici') S of the island of Lipari (A. Oll?, Archeologia Eoliana, 93-97). A Rom Imperial skyphos with lead glaze from the contrada Diana necropolis receives the attention of L. Campagna (Archeologia Eoliana, 75-85), who underlines its uniqueness. A. Oll? (Archeologia Eoliana, 87-91) singles out an already published example of Hayes II shape on account of its excellent (and hence representative) state of preservation. Nine Cretan transport amphorae of E Imperial date are published by G. Ancona (Archeologia Eoliana, 99-112), and small LRom amphorae, perhaps once containing regional wine, are discussed by E. Messina (Archeologia Eoliana, 113-24). On the inscription mentioning the female (possibly ECh) 'gatekeeper' Proba, see A. Pagliara, Seia ns 6-7 (2001-2002), 113-76. V. Giustolisi (Studi Lavagnini, 153-72), contrary to the opinion of the late Bernab? Brea, collects evidence from Lipari to reveal a EByz presence in the island and calls for future fieldwork on this period (see also Giustolisi [ed.], Alla ricerca di Lipari bizantina [Palermo 2001]). Norman Lipari has also received attention in recent years: L. Bernab? Brea and M. Cavalier, QuadMess 1 (2001), 171-268; L. Catalano, Archeo xix.2 (2003), 22-25. On the island of Salina, NW of Lipari, there is the final publication of excavations in the MBA village at Portella: M.C. Martinelli (ed.), // villaggio dell'et? del Bronzo medio di Portella a Salina nelle Isole Eolie (Florence 2005), which contains discussion of seventeen well-preserved huts (cf. also M.C. Martinelli et al, Studi RiunioneBB, 883-87). M.G. Vanaria (Archeologia Eoliana, 65-74) publishes five terracottas found around Valdichiesa di Luni in the 1950s. The terracottas date to the century spanning 350 to 250 BC and may have once belonged to a cult of Demeter and Persephone. Near to here, M. Cavalier (Sicilia Antiqua 1 [2005], 157-72) publishes eighteen tombs uncovered during and following public and agricultural works. All the tombs date to the ist_2nd Ct AD, excepting two, which date to the 1st half of the 3rd Ct BC. The two Hel tombs are of the fossa type with stone slab coverings, and their contents consist mainly of pottery. The Rom tombs are roughly made sacrophagi with stone slab and tile coverings and their grave-goods, where they exist, comprise primarily pottery and lamps. To note are an inscription with the name DEXIS found on a tile, a pair of gold ear-rings and a silver ring. For the island of Filicudi, to the W of Salina, we have a study on the origins of the island's name by P. Lo Cascio and S. Pasta (Archeologia Eoliana, Ml-19), who suggest that it derives from the Gr toponym 'Phoinkodes' meaning 'palm', and another by M. Cultraro (Studi RiunioneBB, 765-80) on the religion of EBA Capo Graziano.</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001 -2005 161 We may end by mentioning here a theme entailing all of Messina province, namely U. Spigo's (Studi ClassiciBB, 103? 20) overview of Siceliot pottery found throughout the province. So far there are finds from Taormina, Francavilla di Sicilia, Messina, Milazzo, Tripi and Lipari. CENTRAL SICILY Province of Enna For Enna there are two studies relating to the cult of Demeter to report. In the first, G. Manganaro (Epigraphica 65 [2003], 9-18) collects the written and numismatic evidence for her cult, casting the discussion in the wider context of Enna's history and Gr settlement in Sicily. In the second, M.L. S?nchez L?on (Geri?n 22 [2004], 135-45) argues, drawing on literary and numismatic evidence, that Eunus controlled Demeter 's sanctuary during the First Slave War. We can also mention here the study by A. Mientjes (PIA VI, 64-75) on the rural history of Enna in the 19th and E20th Cts. The author combines documentary and archaeological sources which not only makes a contribution to Enna's history, but also provides insights for comparative purposes, especially for scholars interested in earlier periods of history. Mientjes' study is a spin-off of the nearby Torcicoda valley survey project mentioned in the previous report (AR [2000 2001], 176). Mark Pluciennik, one of the project's directors, has kindly supplied the following report: 'The Archaeology of the Torcicoda Valley Project has continued with further survey and small-scale excavation. Although identifying further PH material, primarily assigned to the late Copper Age, EBA and LIA, much of the recent work has concentrated on mod. landscapes and structures from the last two centuries (Mientjes et al. 2002; Pluciennik et al. 2004). Such historical archaeology is undeveloped in Sicily and southern Italy: although this area is traditionally situated in the heart of a latifondo landscape, a combination of fieldwork and archive research can identify changes in working patterns, and complex but geographically - and historically - differentiated systems of land tenure and use. These latter can be related to broader socio-political and economic changes such as the political unification of Italy, the rise of the rural mafia, Fascist attempts at land reform and the post-war economic frustrations of contadini and pastoralists. The rich multi-period histories available in these landscapes are typified by the Riparo 1 di San Tommaso, where we have carried out three seasons of small-scale excavations. This rock-shelter has provided evidence of occupation from the Castelluccio period (EBA), to the MIA (a period unrepresented in surface survey material) and subse quently the 7th and 6th Cts BC (shown by the presence of Licodia-Euboea wares) and Hel times. The nearby mill dates back to at least the 17th Ct, while the structures inside the rock shelter date from the M 19th to M20th Ct. Within a few kilometres and stretching across a steep hillside, careful mapping has revealed the remains of an intricate series of terraces, wine presses, field roads, field divisions and occasional houses (along with the remains of a robbed-out Cl tomb), which we suggest is an area where intensive labour investment and the use of land or cash-crops as collateral could enable some degree of social mobility for all but the most impoverished. Direct linkages can be shown between some of the land-holders in this area and family or shared leasing of nearby watermills (Fig. 9), which were important social, cultural and economic nodes in these landscapes from late Med to mod. times.

In the municipality of Calascibetta, a new 'rupestrian' site has been discovered in the heavily vegetated Vallone Canalotto (S. Raffiotta, Archeo xvii.l [2001], 12). PH to Cl material, including tombs of the Copper Age Malpasso culture, were found on the surface, but the main part of the site consists of various rooms, for both civil and religious use (the latter indicated by various crosses), cut into the rock. Two possible churches have been identified, whose crypts, if the interpretation is correct, were presumably accessed via wooden stairs and ladders; Rom-like niches for funerary urns were cut into the walls. This new site takes its place alongside the long-known PH settlement discovered by L. Bernab? Brea in 1950 at Realmese. Some of the first results of the publication programme are reported by R.M. Albanese Procelli and E. Procelli, in A. Giumlia-Mair and F. Lo Schiavo (eds), Le probl?me de l'?tain ? l'origine de ta m?tallurgie. Actes du XIVe Congr?s UISPP, Universit? de Li?ge, Belgique, 2-8 septembre 2001: Section 11, Age du bronze en Europe et en M?diterran?e (BAR International S?ries vol. 1303) (Oxford 2004), 395-98. Most of the material, which consists of coarse domestic wares (including a female figure, an appliqu?, it seems) and stone, dates to the Copper Age, with some earlier Neo as well. More new work has taken place at Montagna di Marzo, which has not appeared in these reports since AR (1987-1988), 135. The new work has sought to document unplundered areas, concentrating its efforts on the summit and the E necropolis (L. Guzzardi, Kokalos 45 [1999 (2004)], 535-53) (Fig. 10). Surface work revealed another clay sarcophagus fragment of Cl Gr type, decorated with a frieze of lotus flowers, known from other parts of Sicily (Fig. 11). Excavations revealed LPH lithic and ceramic material in secondary deposits from historical contexts. More details are also now available on the town plan and the roads leading to other nearby settlements. In sector B, remains of a Hel-Rom and L antique structures were discovered; these are thought to lay close to the agora, posited 9. Enna: Mulino Valata (in use until 1950 and now severely damaged)</page><page sequence="40">162 FRANCO DE ANGELIS 10. Montagna di Marzo: urban plan to have existed between the acropolis and residential quarter. The building contained a cavea, belonging to a theatre which must have had multiple functions. Among the finds were a plaster fragment with Gr graffiti and various scratched designs, one of them identified as the prow of a ship (Fig. 12), and two fragments of statues. Construction of the theatre is placed in the 2nd Ct BC. Excavation in the same area revealed an archi tectural fragment, possibly a gronda, of Cl date, leading to the hypothesis that a building, possibly of religious function, once stood here. Two more glandes with inscriptions and numerals were also uncovered in this work: on one are the names GLAUKOS NEONOS, accompanied by the numeral eight, and on the other are the names HERAKLEID AS DEINARCHON, accompanied by the numeral fourteen. Guzzardi sees these as ex-votos or ballot balls with certain civic figures on them, similar to objects found in the Sanctuary of Athena at Kamarina (cf. AR [1995-1996], 70). In sector D, outside the settlement proper, excavations brought to light a craftworking area, including two poorly preserved kilns. In sector C, in which the E necropolis is located, material was recovered from a partially pillaged chamber tomb. This material includes the base of an aryballos and kotyle of Cor manufacture, dating to the 1st half ofthe6thCtBC(Fig. 13). From Barrafranca, to the SW, R. Panvini (CdA 36 [1997 (2002)], 61-65) publishes an Attic rf column krater in a private collection in Bronte (on the NW slopes of Mt Etna). The vase can be attributed to the Painter of the Florence Centauromachy. On the main register is a bearded Zeus chasing Aegina and Asopus, while on the other side there is a generic scene of three ephebe lovers in conversation. Close by to the E, at Piazza Armeria, there are two kinds of work to report. The first naturally involves work on the well known Rom villa. We now have the final publication in three volumes of the excavations by G.V Gentili, La villa romana di Piazza Armerina Palazzo Erculio (Osimo 1999). The first volume contains, among other things, a history of excavations at the site, as well as a description of the architecture; the second volume contains discussion of the finds; and the third volume describes and interprets the figured mosaics. There is also a new guidebook to the site: Piazza Armerina: la villa romana villa del C?sale, Morgantina (Messina 2003), published simultaneously also in English, French, German and Spanish versions. In another work, F.S. Brancato and R. Mingoia, Piazza Armerina apud thermas apud Hennam. La cosiddetta villa romana del C?sale (Comiso 2002), identify Piazza Armerina with a bath-house, a theory which is not likely to find widespread support. Much food for thought as to the purpose of the villa is found in an article by G. Manganaro (Sicilia Antiqua 2 [2005], 173-91), who, among other things, argues that the owner was of senatorial rank and that the villa was the provincial governor's residence, which had a latifundium and vicus in the vicinity. R.J.A. Wilson (Sicilia Antiqua 1 [2004], 153-70) identifies the figure in the S apse of the Great Hunt corridor with Aethiopia, whom he argues fits all the evidence. The second kind of work has focused on the Med period in and around the famous villa. New excavations were undertaken in 2004 and 2005 through the collaboration of insti tutions in Sicily and Rome and were exhibited in Piazza Armerina between August 2006 and December 2007 (http : //www. comune .piazzaarmerina. en. it/mostra_medievale. asp). The fieldwork brought to light an Arabo-Norman settlement whose life ended in the reign of Roger II, and it has encouraged reconsideration of the Med remains found in Gentili's excavations, which were not given the same attention as the Rom material, as was the way until the recent rise of interest in Med archaeology.</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001 -2005 163 Fifty years of American excavations at Morgantina, further to the NE, were commemorated with a special colloquium entitled 'Polis Axiologos: Morgantina at Fifty' held at the 106th annual meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America (details of the various papers can be consulted at the AIA's online abstract archive http://www.archaeological.org/ webinfo.php?page= 10248). As in the last few reports, work at Morgantina in this period has entailed some new small-scale excavations in all the major periods represented at the site (results will appear in the next report) along with the study of previously uncovered material. The results of the field survey around Morgantina are put into comparative Italian perspective by S. Thompson, in P. Attema et al (eds), New Developments in Italian Landscape Archaeology (BAR International Series vol. 1091) (Oxford 2002), 76-82. G. Greco (Studi Cristofani, 11. Montagna di Marzo: sarcophagus fragment 12. Montagna di Marzo: ship's prow on plaster fragment 13. Montagna di Marzo: Cor kotyle 93-102) has challenged the idea of Phokaian manufacture for the Ar anteflxes and revetments and the reconstruction of the naiskos to which they originally belonged, as posited by one of Morgantina's researchers. She argues that it is simpler to view them as having been executed by local craftsmen working in the hybrid and mixed cultural setting that was Sicily. The more than 1,000 miniature vases of Cl and EHel date from the Central Sanctuary are the subject of an article by I.E.M. Edlund-Berry, in C. Scheffer (ed.), Ceramics in Context: Proceedings of the Internordic Colloquium on Ancient Greek Pottery held at Stockholm, 13-15 June 1997 (Stockholm 2001), 71-75. The vases are all wheelmade and come in a variety of shapes, particularly cups, bowls, plates and pitchers. Drawing on parallels from sanctuaries elsewhere in Sicily and S Italy, she notes that such vases are usually associated with cults of Demeter and Persephone, but at Morgantina she sees a more complex situation involving Greeks and non-Greeks finding common ground in the worship of a female divinity. M. Bell</page><page sequence="42">i 64 FRANCO DE ANGELIS (Nuove Prospettive, 135-48; Studi de Waele, 93-99) identifies a public office on the agora, possibly for tax collections, and residences with special rooms set off with screen walls and containing stone basins as the houses of bankers. We also have a full study of the Hel silver set (Fig. 14) thought by many to have come from Morgantina (cf. AR [2000-2001], 177), by P.G. Guzzo, BdA 121 (2002), 1-46 (an English version of this same study has appeared in Metropolitan Museum Journal 38 [2003], 45-94). This study contains a detailed catalogue of all fifteen items in the set, including discussion of their state of preservation, weight, inscriptions (on ten of the fifteen pieces), monograms and manufacture. Guzzo observes that the numbering system is 'pseudo-ascendant', commonly found in Sicily, but not in Daunia (where the find-spot is sometimes placed), and that the average weight unit is 3.31 grams, very close to the Persian-Seleucid shekel in use until the 2nd Ct BC. He hypothesizes, moreover, that the set may have been buried around 200 BC and finds it 'probable' that the set was found at Morgantina, speculating that the hoard belonged to a group of mercenaries led by a certain Eupolemos. However, he allows for other possibilities as to how the set may have arrived at Morgantina, such as a trade item from Syracuse. At the E end of the Ennese, the study of Centuripe (anc. Kentoripai) has expanded considerably in recent years. One of the reflections of this has been the creation of a new museum, inaugurated in December 2000. A glossy overview of Centuripe from antiquity to the present is contained in a Kalos supplement to 14.4 (Oct.-Dec. 2002). A wealth of new data and interpretations can be found in G. Rizza (ed.), Scavi e ricerche a Centuripe (Catania 2002). Rizza (9-40) begins by reviewing the last half century of archaeological work. G. Biondi (41-81) next makes a contribution to the 'carta archeo logica', reporting on results of a surface survey undertaken between 1991 and 1995. 33 sites are contained in Biondi's catalogue. The earliest material dates to the Pal. The region seems to have been unoccupied in the LBA, with evidence of habitation appearing at the hill-top settlements at Monte Ficarazza and Monte Policara. The Ar period may have witnessed the aggregation of various native sites at Centuripe; there is as yet no certain evidence thereafter until the period of Timoleon. Dense occupation of the countryside is attested in Hel-Rom times, which continues into Byz times, followed by another gap in Arab-Norman times. Elsewhere, Biondi (PIA VI, 1008-15) devotes a case study to Monte Ficarazza. In the third article in Rizza's edited volume, Biondi (83-99) reports on his surface survey around the 'Riparo Cassataro', a site known for its PH 'paintings.' Among the finds are fragments of an Attic cup and Lakonian krater, Licodia Eubea pithoi and LRom/Byz striated tiles of the 5th-7th Cts AD. The next article is also by Biondi (101-03), who publishes a second inscription in apparently the Sikel language. The inscription, which was found on a tile recovered from surface survey, reads as follows: [ ]EINAN[I?-]. Biondi leaves it up to the linguistic specialists to decide whether we are dealing with the Sikel or Gr languages, but he observes that tiles were used in anc. E Sicily to cover tombs. R. Patan? (105-14) provides a fuller report on an already known house of the 4th Ct BC (cf. AR [1995-1996], 84). Three phases of occupation have been recognized. The final phase dates to 350-330 BC and belongs to a destruction horizon, thereby supplying valuable insights into everyday life. In the next contribution, A. Pautasso (115-26) examines the reliefs from a Hel tomb that was destroyed shortly after its discovery in 1950. She heroically reconstructs four reliefs: one comprising a banqueting scene; another of a horse; yet another of an individual on foot leading a horse; and the last of an athlete. Pautasso connects these reliefs with the ?lite practice of showing off their wealth in burial in the 3rd Ct BC. In another contribution by Patan? (127-67), the connections between Centuripe and Rome are explored in detail by drawing on all kinds of possible evidence. Biondi discusses in yet 14. Morgantina: Hel silver set</page><page sequence="43">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001 -2005 165 another contribution (169-87) the Hel and Rom material found in the area of Monte Calvario after the removal of tens of cubic metres of earth. Many animal bones were found in a rich, thick, dark soil. Most of the Hel pottery is black glaze, and the LHel and Imperial Rom material consists of Campana Cl and Eastern Sigillata A. These new finds are combined with what was already known archaeologically from Monte Calvario from both burial and settlement contexts. Biondi hypothesizes that Monte Calvario may have been the site of an Augustan expansion of the town. In the final contribution of the volume, Patan? (189-97) gives another fuller report of earlier excavations in contrada Difesa undertaken during sewer works. These excavations revealed two phases of Rom terracing dating to the 2nd/lst Ct BC. Elsewhere V. La Rosa (Studi Cristofani, 188-90) publishes a 'grotesque' terracotta statuette in Catania. The statuette is of a male figure holding a goose and preserves traces of its polychromatic painting. As to its date, La Rosa hazards a guess of the 2nd-1st Ct BC because of the statuette's Alexandrian flavour. It seems appropriate to mention here an article by G. Manganaro (ArchClass 53 [2002], 551-63) on metal instrumenta domestica in a private collection formed in the Centuripe area. The objects are of Hel, Byz and Med date and consist of clasps, keys, buckles and whips. The multi-faceted work at Troina, to the NW of Centuripe, mentioned in the last report (AR [2000-2001], 179) has entered the publication stage. A general round-up of results can be consulted in C. Malone, G. Ayala, M. Fitzjohn and S. Stoddart, Accordia Research Papers 9 (2001-2003), 7-21. The geo archaeological research can also be read about in Studi RiunioneBB (959-62 by G. Ayala) and in Geoarchaeology 20 (2005), 149-67 by G. Ayala and C. French. There are two developments to report from Gagliano Castelferrato to the SE of Troina. A native site has been discovered on a series of hills (1116m asl), known locally as the Tl castello della principessa', located about 5km NE of Gagliano Castelferrato (R.P.A. Patan?, CdA 36 [1997 (2002)], 9-33). The site occupies a surface area of more than 2km, over which a thick carpet of ceramics and tile, as well as metal and coin finds, was picked up during surface survey. Several plundered tombs of the Licodia Eubea culture were also explored and any remaining material recovered from them. The site was abandoned from Hieron,II's reign to Med times, its life probably being brought to an end by Hieron II's well-known attempt to expel the Mamertines from fortified heights in Sicily's interior. The Med castle in Gagliano Castelferrato itself is the subject of a study by F. Maurici and R. Landicina, Archeologia M?di?vale 31 (2004), 273-84, who observe that its first appearance in documents and its basic form took shape in the Norman period. At Nissoria to the SE, there has been a surface survey and a study of the fortifications visible on the 'Montagna' to the E of the modern town (775m asl) (for the survey: G. Buscemi Felici, Orrizonti 5 [2004], 175-88; for the fortification: E. Felici and L. Lanteri, in S. Quilici Gigli and L. Quilici [eds], Viabilit? e insediamenti nell'Italia antica [Atlante Tem?tico di Topograf?a Antica vol. 13] [Rome 2004], 411-32). The fortification consists of a double curtain wall with several towers and a postern gate and belongs to the 'ad aggere' type, which in broad terms dates from Neo times to the 4th Ct BC. The researchers hypothesize that the hill top was fortified in the 7th and 6th Cts BC when the native site was established, although they allow for earlier and later development of the fortification. Several seasons of survey were conducted on the summit of the 'Montagna' and in two other nearby areas, bringing to light a wealth of finds. The earliest material belongs to the Copper Age and also includes finds of the later PH periods (Castelluccio, Cassibile and Licodia Eubea). The Castelluccio material is uncharacteristically found on a height. Tombs of the Licodia Eubea period were also identified, and Buscemi Felici agrees in dating the fortification to this time. Anc. Imachara and Mestraton are to be situated in this region, although no evidence exists, as yet, connecting the settlement on the 'Montagna' to one of these ancient toponyms. There is also Hel/Rom material, including a farmstead of the 2nd/lst Cts BC. Occupation continues down in Byz-Med times, when there was a tendency to occupy heights for defensive purposes. From Assoro, to the SE in the direction of Enna, we have the results of an archaeometric study of pottery by G. Barone, S. Ioppolo and G. Puglisi, in V. Kilikoglou, A. Hein and Y. Maniatis (eds), Modern Trends in Scientific Studies on Ancient Ceramics (BAR International Series vol. 1011) (Oxford 2002), 227-32. Ten Hel items were analysed, revealing the use of local material in their production. SOUTHERN SICILY Provinces of Agrigento and Caltanissetta For Agrigento, we begin with the general works that have been published: E. De Miro et al, ArchViva xxiv.112 (2005), 40-67; V. Librici Alfio, Agrigento: dall'apoikia rodio-cretese alia saga dei Chiaramonte (Palermo 1999) (missed in the last report); M.S. Di Fede, Agrigento nel Veta moderna: identit? urbana e culto dell'antico (Palermo 2005). Works on particular historical themes have also appeared. On Phalaris, M. Vaglio (Anemos 1 [2000], 151-55) reconsiders his hometown, arguing that he came from Astypalaea on Cos, where crabs were also used as images on coins. Such imagery was a way for the Akragantines to honour the Coans who took part in the city's foundation. The legends and letters attributed to Phalaris are the subject of two monographs: D. Muratore, Le epistole di Falaride: catalogo dei manoscritti (La Spezia 2001); V. Hinz, Nunc Phalaris doctum protulit ecce caput. Antike Phalarislegende und Nachleben der Phalarisbrief e (Munich 2001) (reviewed by J. Henderson, BMCR 2002.03.43). On Empedocles, we should note the book by S. Trepanier, Empedocles: An Interpretation (New York 2004), and D.M. Bailey's publication of a LRom wine dipper in The British Museum, in C. Entwistle (ed.), Through a Glass Brightly. Studies in Byzantine and Medieval Art and Archaeology Presented to David Buckton (Oxford 2003), 1-9, in which he argues, among other things, that this wine dipper must have been the kind of object Empedocles' little girl is playing with in fragment 100. G. Tagliamonte (Due Dionisi, 501-17) examines the literary and archaeological evidence for Italic mercenaries at Akragas and in doing so reveals possible material support for their presence. Akragas in the time of Dionysius I?II and later post-Agathoklean tyrants are studied by E. De Miro (Studi Cataudella, 361-67), G. Fiorentini (Due Dionisi, 147-67) and E. Zamb?n, in L. Braccesi (ed.), Hesperia X/F(Rome 2001), 179-89. On the epigraphy of Gr Akragas, there has been a reprinting of R. Arena, Iscrizioni greche arcaiche di Sicilia e Magna Grecia II: iscrizioni di Gela e di Agrigento (Pisa 2002); the revisions to this volume are outlined by Arena himself in Acme 56 (2003), 245-50. P. Pocetti provides a proper edition of a previously known lead curse tablet, thought to come from Agrigento (Mediterr?neo Antico 1 [2004], 615-72; cf. L. Dubois, Inscriptions grecques dialectales de Sidle: contribution ? l'?tude du vocabulaire grec colonial [Rome 1989], no. 180; J. B. Curbera, Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies 38 [1997 (1999)], no. 15). The inscription contains a mixture of Gr and non-Gr names and</page><page sequence="44">166 FRANCO DE ANGELIS reflects the city's diverse population make-up in the 5th Ct BC. On a related topic, the relationship between Akragas and its native hinterland is explored by T. Fischer-Hansen, in T.H. Nielsen (ed.), Even More Studies in the Ancient Greek Polis (Papers of the Copenhagen Polis Centre vol. 6) (Stuttgart 2002), 125-86 (the whole volume is reviewed by M.P.J. Dillon, BMCR 2004.03.14). Turning to discussion of the developments in Gr material culture, we may start by noting that there has been a reprinting of P. Griffo, II museo archeologico regionale di Agrigento (Rome 2000), and the creation of an autonomous archaeolog ical park of the Valley of the Temples, headed by P. Meli. There are some developments to report regarding the city's topography and architecture. G. Tripodi (Studi De Miro, 685-91) reconsiders the location of gate IV (Aurea Porta), suggesting that it is to be placed a few hundred metres to the E of where it is usually thought to have lain, and in particular in the garden to the Villa Aurea. Here, on the hill's summit, traces exist in the rock of a possible structure connected with the gate. G. Barbera and A. Pitrone (Kalos 14.1 [2002], 26-27) provide a colourful overview of the kolymbethra. Akragas' chthonic sanctuaries are the subject of detailed discussion by C. Zoppi, Gli edifici arcaici dell'santuario delle divinit? ctonie di Agrigento: problemi di cronolog?a e di archittetura (Alessandria 2001) (cf. the notice in Kernos 17 [2004], 292 for discussion of its main arguments). Elsewhere Zoppi (Sicilia Antiqua 1 [2004], 41-79) takes a close look at the phases of construction of the San Biagio 'sanctuary' (fountain). Three phases can be distinguished with certainty, although they are difficult to date. Zoppi suggests a 5th Ct BC date for initial construction and admits that it is also difficult to establish the relationship between the fountain and a nearby temple and two grottos. The second phase is placed in the time of Timoleon, when small tubs and some renovation can be noted. The third phase is dated early on in the First Punic War, when water canals were added to feed the tubs, and attempts were made to conceal the entrance of the grottos in order to preserve their sacredness. Zoppi ends by calling for more fieldwork in this entire extramural area of the anc. city. Akragas' monumental temples always attract attention, including more popular attention: G. Ortolani, La valle dei templi di Agrigento (Rome 2004); and the CD-ROM by G. Hoppe, Agrigent und das Tal der Temple (Munich 2004). Because of the popularity of the Valley of the Temples with tourists, there has also been a focus in recent years on conservation issues: P.A. Piazza (ed.), Un progettoper la Valle dei Templi (Rome 2002); P. Meli (Studi De Miro, 499-506); G. Ferrara, Paesaggi di idee: uno sguardo al futuro della Valle dei Templi di Agrigento (Florence 2005). The only other development to report is another contribution by the late J. De Waele (Studi De Miro, 499-506) on the 'standardiza tion' of stone blocks used in the construction of these temples: for the Temple of Juno Lacinia, a foot of 0.307m is used, and for the Temple of Concord, a foot of 0.32m. The Asklepieion has received a hefty final publication: E. De Miro, Agrigento II. Isantuari extraurbani: l'asklepieion (Rome 2004) (on the main results, cf. the notice in Kernos 18 [2005], 521-22, as well as the reviews by CG. Malacrino, ASAA 81 [2003 (2005)], 726 32; C. Zoppi, Orizzonti 5 [2004], 200-01). M. Bell (Studi de Waele, 93-9) identifies certain residences with special rooms set off with screen walls and containing stone basins as the houses of bankers. Coins must certainly have played a part in the transactions of these bankers, and the study of anc. coins in Agrigento is richer thanks to the publication by M. Caccamo Caltabiano (ed.), Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum Italia: Agrigento Museo Archeologico Regionale, Fondo dell'ex Museo Civico e altre raccolte del Medagliere (Palermo 1999) (missed in the last report). In respect of pottery studies, V. Cali (QuadMess 3 [2003], 145-64) interprets the pottery recovered from the Sant'Anna sanctuary, arguing that it represents the material residues of ritual activity concerned with the preparation and consumption of meals. The Attic bf pottery found in a 6th Ct cenotaph near Agrigento is debated by C. Marconi and R. Osborne, in C. Marconi (ed.), Greek Vases: Images, Contexts and Controversies (Leiden 2004), 27-40 and 41-54 (the whole volume is reviewed by R. Neer, BMCR 2005.09.53). They arrive at opposite conclusions: Marconi argues that the signifi cance of Attic material must be understood in its Italic context, while Osborne argues that the Athenian context is central. These case studies are a reflection of the growing interest, discussed earlier under 'Historical Topics', in questions of intercultural contact. The collection of 4th Ct BC wares in the Agrigento Museum has been published by M. de Cesare, Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Italia 72. Museo Archeologico Regionale di Agrigento 2 (Rome 2005). Two studies on statuettes have appeared in this period. The chronology and typology of the 'Athena Lindia' terracotta votives found at Agrigento are discussed by G. Fiertler (QuadMess 2 [2001], 53-76), and V. Cali (Studi De Miro, 131-38) publishes a marble statuette of W Gr manufacture in complete tondo found in a well between the Temple of Zeus and the Sanctuary of the Chthonic Divinities. The figure, wearing a himation, sits on a cube-shaped throne and is identified with Dionysos or possibly Hades. Comparanda suggest a date in the L6th and 5th Cts BC and a dedicatory function. For the Rom and later periods, we begin with a study by A. Cutroni Tusa (Scienze dell Antichit? 11 [2001-2003], 305 18) on the return of the city's mint in L3th Ct BC. She argues that the mint exhibits signs of independent activity, supplying the Carthaginian contingents engaged in the Second Punic War and thus operating separate from Syracuse and Rome. E. De Miro (Studi De Waele, 169-76) discusses the Augustan building programme and its later renovations. G. Fiertler (Studi De Miro, 321-37) publishes the 'Pantellerian Ware' from the Rom city. A. Polito (Studi De Miro, 553-69) collects and discusses the 22 lamps in African Sigillata discovered in Rom houses. Most of the lamps date to the 4th-6th Cts AD. The so called 'minor hypogea' of ECh times are examined by R. Carra Bonacasa (Studi De Miro, 203-18). The later Ch uses of the Temple of Concordia are explored by M. Milvia Morciano (Studi Cataudella, 943-54). A study on the 'rupestrian' churches of Santa Maria delle Tortorelle has appeared from the pen of G. Amarj, SicArch xxxiv.99 (2001), 157-66. At Herakleia Minoa, to the W of Agrigento, we have a preliminary report on three 'saggi' to the S and W of the site's theatre by V. Cali and S.C. Sturiale, QuadMess 1.2 (2000 [2001]), 41-64. The excavators revealed two two-roomed Hel structures: the first may have been used for craftworking, judging from a pithos containing clay; the second has been dubbed the 'casa delle anfore' from the six amphorae whose bases were sunk into the courtyard's ground. For the theatre, E. De Miro (Studi ClassiciBB, 275-9) places the structure in a Sicilian context by comparing its urban placement, historical background and architecture to other theatres known in the island. G. Fiorentini (Sicilia Bizantina, 223-41) provides more details of the ECh and EByz rural basilica mentioned in an earlier report (AR [1995-1996], 93). On the Hel-Rom agricul tural village at Campanaio mentioned in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 181-82), there is a glossy overview of the finds by its excavator, R.J.A, Wilson, Kalos 13.4 (2001), 24 31. The final publication has been in preparation during this reporting period. Studies dealing with parts of the Platani</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001 -2005 167 river valley may be mentioned here. D. Gulli (QuadMess 1.1 [2000 (2001)], 139-77) reports on new PH and Ar sites discovered via topographic survey in the mid and lower river valley. Native and Gr material was found on several sites, all located in strategic positions. Three of the Gr sites are tentatively identified asphrouria connected with the expansion of Akragas in the L6th and E5th Cts BC. Further up the valley, V. La Rosa (QuadMess 1.1 [2000 (2001)], 125-38) summarizes and examines the MBA and LBA evidence. Med settlement in all of the river valley is discussed by M.S. Rizzo, L'insediamento m?di?vale nella valle dei Platani (Studi e Materiali vol. 11) (Rome 2004) (cf. also Rizzo's contribution in Sicilia Bizantina, 215-22). Throughout Rizzo laudably combines written and material sources, testing the rhetoric of the former against the reality of the latter. For Sciacca, we have another book (cf. AR [2000-2001], 182) by the local history enthusiast, G. Verde, on the region's hot-springs: Storiografia delle Terme di Sciacca. Quattromila anni nel piu antico territorio termale di Sicilia/Historiography of the Sciacca Spa: Four Thousand Years in the Most Ancient Spa Area of Sicily (Alcamo 2004). We may also mention here the brief history of the discovery and legal debate between Palermo and Agrigento caused by the so-called Sciacca Melqart by R. Camerata Scovazzo (QuadMuseoSalinas 6 [2000 (2002)], 9-14), who, as the director of the Palermo Museum, notes that the matter is far from resolved. For the new discoveries, we can turn to the preliminary report by A. Polito (QuadMess 1.2 [2000 (2001)], 103-23) of a rural settlement in contrada Carboj just to the W of Sciacca. Two seasons of excavation have revealed occupation from Hel to LRom times, as well as several walls (whose overall plan remains unclear, partly on account of destruction caused by agricultural works) and a scatter of archaeological material covering a surface area of lha. We may also note here the publication of a long-known Selinountine defixio dealing with adoption matters in the Sciacca Museum: G. Manganaro, REG 116 (2003), 685-89. For the impressive hill-top town of Caltabellotta, 20km NE of Sciacca, a local appassionato has produced a topographic study of the site and its surroundings: L. Rizzuti, C?rnico: topograf?a di una fortezza...dalla leggenda...alla realt? (Sciacca 2004). The main conclusion drawn, self-evident in the book's title, is that Caltabellotta, particularly the Rupe Gog?la, was the location of anc. Kamikos. Anc. Triocala is the other toponym scholars sometimes associate with Caltabellotta. Some bronzes found in wealthy tombs, of the L6th/E5th Cts BC, at Monte Adranone are argued to be of Etruscan, Italic and Magna Grecian manufacture by E. De Miro (Studi Cristofani, 438-50). These bronzes can be connected with the sphere of wine drinking and athletics, and De Miro hypothesizes that they arrived on Sicilian shores via Etruscan traders. On the EBA and MBA site at Pietra, between Grotte and Comitini (to the N of Agrigento), there is an article by R. Palumbo, SicArch xxxii.97 (1999 [2001]), 127-46. There is a new antiquarium at Milena, to the NE, together with a guide by C Guzzone, L'antiquarium 'A. Petix' (Caltanissetta 2002). Our knowledge of the Milena area in the BA continues to grow: V. La Rosa (Studi PreistoriciBB, 305-15) discusses three more chamber ('tholos') tombs uncovered through illegal excavation. The tombs date to the LBA-Final BA (Pantalica II and Cassibile periods) and fill an important gap in the regional sequence. The finds left behind consist mostly of pottery, some of it belonging to the so-called 'Ausonian' culture of the Aeolian islands. The latter supplies evidence of interaction, previously little documented, in this period. In a companion study, F. Tomasello (Studi PreistoriciBB, 317-30) examines the construction of these new tombs, wondering whether a standard measurement derived from the Aegean was employed. For Sant'Angelo Muxaro, directly W of Milena, we have an important re-consideration of the native tombs excavated by P. Orsi and U. Zanotti Bianco in 1931-1932 in G. Rizza and D. Palermo (eds), La necropoli di Sant'Angelo Muxaro. Scavi Orsi-Zanotti Bianco 1931-1932, published as CdA 24-25 (1985-1986) in Catania in 2004. This work is now the starting point for future studies and constitutes, as its publishers point out, the monograph on Sant'Angelo Muxaro that Orsi never wrote. D. Palermo, in his concluding remarks on the character and development of the site (179-220), draws attention to the poor contextual information for most finds, but carefully hypothesizes that the famous gold objects belong mainly to the 7th Ct BC, a time of great prosperity at Sant'Angelo Muxaro, though the site continued to be wealthy, albeit less grand than before, into the 1st quarter of the 5th Ct BC, as suggested by a gold ring found in tomb VI. Palermo does not exclude the possibility of Sant'Angelo Muxaro being anc. Kamikos, which, as just seen above, is sometimes also placed at Caltabellotta. To the NE, in the environs of Casteltermini, excavations have revealed a native sanctuary for a chthonic cult (D. Gulli, Studi De Waele, 375-99; Sicilia Antiqua 1 [2005], 9-62). The complex consisted of three rectangular rooms, with an E-W orientation, and can be paralleled with structures and religious practices in the Geloan-Akragantine cultural sphere. Cult offerings were made via a clay tube fixed into the ground; storage containers, for both liquids and solids for ritual purposes, were also discovered in this structure. Other votives include clay model huts and a bronze hoard. The excavator notes similarities with the cult of Demeter, including worshippers from a wide social range, and argues that we need to add ferrous minerals and red ochre to the usual list of exports (grain, salt and sulphur) from this region. The IA clay models of round structures uncovered in excavations at Polizzello are studied by D. Palermo (CdA 36 [1997 (2002)], 35-45), who draws parallels with Cretan material of LM III-ProtoGeo date in which a goddess with upraised arms is standing on the inside of similar clay structures. Palermo, following Orsi and others who have worked in this part of Sicily, sees widespread Cretan influence in cult and culture from the BA to the foundation of Gela, in which Cretan settlers took part, using this evidence as support for his study of Polizzello's clay models. Palermo has also undertaken some new excavation at Polizzello (Orizzonti 4 [2003], 95-99). A rectangular structure, of the 6th Ct BC, has been found on the acropolis. It measures 8.3m by 5.6m and contained many animal bones, perhaps connected with sacrifice. For Marianopoli, there is a museum catalogue to report: R. Panvini (ed.), Marianopoli. II Museo Archeologico: catalogo (Caltanissetta 2000). At Resuttano, in the northern most part of Caltanissetta province, we have the second Sicilian contribution in the 'Forma Italiae' series (vol. 42 overall): A Burgio, Resuttano (IGM 260 III SO) (Florence 2002). This volume focuses on one of Sicily's important watershed regions, a frontier between different territorial jurisdictions. Burgio's catalogue contains 84 sites of PH to Med date. There seems to be a penchant for hill-top settlement in the IA, but this was accompanied by dispersed, and probably permanent (indicated by possible tombs), rural settlement in Ar and Cl times, which only intensified in Hel and Rom times. The Med evidence is not as clear. P.M. Day and L. Joyner's thin section examination of two body sherds of coarseware stirrup jars from the BA site at Cannatello (SE of Agrigento) suggests a central Cretan origin for the fabric, which adds another important little piece in the picture of international exchange in this period (Studi Micenei ed Egeo-anatolici 47 [2005], 309-14). The 1998 season of</page><page sequence="46">168 FRANCO DE ANGELIS excavation at Monte Grande, further along the coast to the E, was published by G. Castellana, the excavator, in Studi RiunioneBB (515-23). The article comprises material discussed in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 183). Further to the NE, in the Salso river valley, we have the publication of more material from years of excavation at the native-Gr site at Monte Saraceno di Ravanusa. A. Siracusano (QuadMess 2 [2001], 29-49) considers the evolution of native material culture as a result of contact with Greeks, finding collaboration and the selective adoption of Gr pottery ideas. A. Denti (QuadMess 1 [2001], 77-90) publishes a dozen burials from contrada Tintoria, located W of Monte Rosso and S of the modern town. The burials, which span a century in date (L6th to L5th Cts BC) were discovered in 1973 during road works. Only three of the tombs were intact. The rite consisted mostly of single inhumations in rectangular pits, sometimes lined with slabs; a sarcophagus fragment, with parallels to material from Gela, was found in tomb 2. There is much Attic pottery amongst the grave-goods, especially bf lekythoi. The topographic relationship of these tombs to the anc. settlement remains unclear. We also have another report by Denti (Studi De Miro, 247-69) on another group of burials, this time in contrada Stornello. This group comprises 22 burials excavated in 1989. The rite is more varied than the first group of burials just discussed: we have mainly inhumation, though some cremation too, in sarcophagi, enchytrismos, tiles and earth fossae. There is imported Gr pottery amongst the grave-goods (LCor, EGr and Attic), which helps to date these tombs to the century spanning the M6th to the M5th Ct BC. Denti's studies provide much-welcome details on his earlier brief reports (cf. AR [1995-1996], 99). A composite vase found in another burial (tomb 25, perhaps of a child or young boy) from another anc. necropolis, that near the via Olimpica in the modern town, is singled out for publication by G. Fiorentini (Studi De Miro, 339-50). The vase is a stamnoid pyxis with ovoid body and cylindrical neck and depicts Dionysos on one side and a satyr on a quadruped on the other. Such vases appear in the Attic repertoire of the L6th/E5th Cts BC, to which time period it is accordingly dated. Two figured oscillae of the 5th and 4th Cts BC receive publication by A. Siracusano, Studi De Miro, 605 17. An overview of the anc. site in this same time period is provided by A. Calderone (Due Dionisi, 19-31). From Sommatino, directly to the N of Ravanusa, there is the publication of a survey concentrating on the Castelluccio (EBA) period by F. Ianni, // Castellucciano nel bacino centro occidentale del flume Salso (Caltanissetta 2004). In area of about 100km2, 16 PH sites were discovered, 12 of them belonging to the Castelluccio culture, the other four to the Copper Age, MBA, LBA and EIA. The sites range in size between 1 and 13ha and were often situated close to water and sulphur resources. Another field survey has been published for the Brajemi valley to the NE: E.F. Castagnino Berlinghieri, RTA/JAT 12 (2002 [2004]), 197-220. This is a systematic, multi-period survey, with groups of six to seven fieldwalkers spaced 4m apart. In her preliminary report, Castagnino Berlinghieri focuses discussion on the PH period, placing her results in the overall context of Sicilian prehistory. We now have evidence from this valley of the kind of developments known elsewhere in the island. For Manfria, to the W of Gela, we have a reconsideration of the EBA (Castelluccio) settlement by E. Procelli (Studi De Miro, 571-72), spurred on by four decades of scholarly advances made since Manfria's excavation. Procelli postulates a clan structure and open society eager for contact with Malta, E Sicily and the Aegean. Elsewhere Procelli and F. Alberghina (PIA VI, 337-45) publish the cooking wares from EBA Manfria. The much later LRom necropolis in Manfria's contrada Monumenti is discussed in R.M. Carra Bonacasa and R. Panvini, La Sicilia centro-meridionale tra il 2. ed il 6. sec. d.C: catalogo della mostra: Caltanissetta-Gela, aprile dicembre 1997 (Caltanissetta 2002), 95-101. The many finds of PH to Med date made at Butera over the years are collected and discussed in R. Panvini (ed.), Butera dalla preistoria all'et? m?di?vale (Caltanissetta 2003). There are reports on new Byz settlements found near Monte Dessueri and Mazzarino by R. Panvini (Sicilia Bizantina, 191-213). At Monte Canalotti and Monte Maio, in the environs of Monte Dessueri, two farmsteads were found during excavation of a LBA village. Tile finds suggest a date of the 6th and 7th Cts AD for the farmsteads. In contrada Minnelli, 2km S of Mazzarino, work here uncovered a large residential complex, whose foundations consist of lame roughly hewn stones, which cut into layers spanning the 6th Ct BC to the 7th Ct AD. Finds of Attic bf date the earliest layer. The complex has what seems to be a lime-working area. Panvini follows a previous identifica tion that sees this area as the location of Macarina and underlines the notableness of such a large Byz settlement so close to Sofiana. Some 12km to the E of Mazzarino at Sofiana there are discussions regarding the Rom material in R.M. Carra Bonacasa and R. Panvini, La Sicilia centro-meridionale tra il 2. ed il 6. sec. d.C: catalogo della mostra: Caltanissetta-Gela, aprile-dicembre 1997 (Caltanissetta 2002), 103-235, 303-34. New discoveries and studies derived from older archaeolog ical investigations can be reported for Gela in this period. For syntheses and historical themes, there is much of relevance to mention. For Gela from PH to present, a very glossy work, containing numerous colour photographs, has been published by 'Agip': AA.VV, Omaggio a Gela (Colora-Lodi 1997). This book, missed in the last report, is an 'edizione fuori commercio' and can be viewed as a 'public relations' exercise by the multi national petroleum company, whose presence looms large at Gela. On anc. Gela alone, C. Raccuia has produced an up-to date and highly readable account in Gela antica. Storia, econom?a, istituzioni: le origini (Biblioteca dell'Archivio Storico Messinese vol. 29) (Messina 2000) (cf. also her article in Kokalos 46 [2000 (2005)], 319-25) (Raccuia's book is reviewed by A.J. Dom?nguez, Polifemo 2 [2002], 107-10). As noted already, R. Arena, Iscrizioni greche arcaiche di Sicilia e Magna Grecia II: iscrizioni di Gela e di Agrigento (Pisa 2002) has been reprinted, with revisions outlined by Arena himself in Acme 56 (2003), 245-50. The proceedings of a colloquium on Gela's history referred to in the previous report (AR [2000 2001], 147) have now appeared in Kokalos 45 (1999 [2004]), 383-533. Among the eleven contributions, we may note the following in particular. In the introduction, F.P. Rizzo (383-84) observes how it is archaeology that is advancing knowledge of the anc. city. P. Anello (385-408) considers the early history of the Gr foundation, particularly questions of site selection, the Lindioi and cultural components in the city, the first two topics of which are also tackled by R. Sammartano (471-99). A. Cutroni Tusa (413-26) reconsiders Geloan numismatics in particularly the 4th Ct BC, noting a richer and less lacunose picture than that portrayed by G.K. Jenkins, The Coinage of Gela (Berlin 1970). G. Turco (521-33) examines the territory of Gela from especially a geological and hydrological viewpoint. Elsewhere, an Italian translation, with introduction by E. De Miro, has apparently appeared of J. Schubring's 19th Ct work on the historical geography of Gela and surroundings: Studio storico geogr?fico sulla Sicilia antica: Gela, Phintias, i Siculi meridionali (Licata 1997) (non vidi). The relationship between Gela and the native sites in its hinterland is explored in two studies: L.G. Lo Presti, Kokalos 46 (2000 [2005]), 365</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001-2005 169 80; T. Fischer-Hansen, in T.H, Nielsen (ed.), Even More Studies in the Ancient Greek Polis (Papers of the Copenhagen Polis Centre vol. 6) (Stuttgart 2002), 125-86 (the whole volume is reviewed by M.P.J. Dillon, BMCR 2004.03.14). We also have another contribution by J. de la Geniere (REG 114 [2001], 24 36) on identifying Campanian mercenaries in Gela's tombs (cf. AR [2000-2001], 185). P. Pocetti, referring to the latter's work, re-studies a lead curse tablet discovered by P Orsi in 1906 in a tomb at the site and concludes that it supports the idea of Italic mercenaries receiving burial at Gela (Mediterr?neo Antico 1 [2004], 615-72). The economic and diplomatic relations between Rome and Gela in the time of Gelon are explored by G. Mafoda, Kokalos 46 (2000 [2005)]), 253-59, and Gela in the time of two later Syracusan tyrants, Dionysius I-II, is studied by G. Fiorentini (Due Dionisi, 147-67). For items that deal more directly with material culture, we start with studies on the topography and monuments of the Grcity. M. Milvia Morciano (RTA/JAT 11 [2001 (2003)], 115 54) interprets afresh the fortifications at Capo Soprano, arguing that the walls were planned and initially built in stone, with the upper brick part belonging to a later phase of construction. The latter occurred in the time of Agathokles, and support is given to the first phase of the fortification as belonging to the time of Timoleon. More is known about Gela's sacred topography. To R. Panvini and L. Sole we owe a debt of gratitude for their important work which examines the votive deposits found in the area of Molino a Vento on the acropolis in the 1950s by D. Adamesteanu and P. Orlandini: L'acropoli di Gela. Stipi, depositi o scarichi (Corpus delle Stipi Votive in Italia vol. 18) (Rome 2005) (reviewed by P.D. Scirpo, BMCR 2006.07.33). The authors reconsider earlier interpretations of these deposits, providing important insights into the evolution of coroplastics and cult practices during the 7th to 5th Ct BC. In a similar spirit is a work by P Orlandini (Studi De Miro, 507-13), who reports on rescue work carried in 1991 at the Thesmophorion at Bitalemi. These new data, which include graffiti and terracotta statuettes, confirm Orlandini's interpretations of a generation earlier, while adding new evidence for a cult building that replaced in the 5th Ct BC an earlier structure. M. Castoldi (Ag?is und Mittelmeer, 245-49) returns to Gela's LAr painted antefixes (cf. AR [2000-2001], 185), arguing for E Gr inspiration. We have a round-up of the evidence for the cult of Herakles at Gela by G. Manganaro (Epigraphica 67 [2005], 9 16). S. De Vido (SicArch xxxii.97 [1999 (2001)], 67-74) reconsiders two inscribed votive plates of LAr date, seeing them as connected with a river-god cult of some kind. Terracottas connected with a cult of Demeter and Kore found in excavations in the area of the old train station are the subject of a study by G. Spagnolo (QuadMess 1.1 [2000], 179-201). The material dates to the 5th Ct BC. Two independent studies have focused in this period on Baubo, the old woman at Eleusis connected with the myth of Demeter, known at Gela via terracottas: C. Masseria, Ostraka 12 (2003), 177-95; M.C. Lentini, BABesch 80 (2005), 213-15. The most impressive new discovery relating to the religious sphere is three altars uncovered during excavations at Bosco Littorio (Figs 15-17) (for a brief account, see R. Panvini and L. Sole, ArchViva xx.89 [2001], 80-84; the French exhibition catalogue provides the fullest account to date: AA.VV., Les autels archa?ques de Gela: une d?couverte exceptionnelle en Sicile [Caltanissetta 2001]). The altars, which were likely made at Gela judging from the clay, seem never to have been used, but abandoned, perhaps because of a natural disaster. One of the altars (1.16m h. by 0.335m d.) has discernible Cor style and depicts Medusa. Another altar (1.14m h. by 0.35m d.) has on it three goddesses, perhaps Demeter, Kore and Hekate (or Aphrodite), or even the 15. Gela: altar depicting Medusa 16. Gela: altar depicting three goddesses</page><page sequence="48">170 FRANCO DE ANGELIS 17. Gela: altar depicting Kephalos (or Tithonos) and Eos Meteres, with an upper register containing a lion attacking a bull. The third altar (0.53m h. by 0.43m d.) depicts the abduction of Kephalos by Eos, a myth already known from pottery at Gela. Of the pottery found with the altars, we may note here the bf works by the Lindos Group and in the style of Haimon. The interpretation of the figures represented on the last of these altars has already been challenged by A. Calderone (Studi De Miro, 121-30), who argues that Tithonos, and not Kephalos, is depicted. From C. Ingoglia (Studi De Miro, 417 28) we have yet another contribution on Cor kotylai, to be placed alongside her earlier work (cf. AR [2000-2001], 185). There are other pottery studies to report. R. Bortolin (Rivista di Archeologia 24 [2000 (2001)], 70-77) publishes a lekythos, said to be from Sybaris, depicting Herakles fighting the Nemean Lion and identifies it as a work of the Gela Painter. M.C. Lentini (BdA 133-34 [2005], 57-60) publishes two Laconian bell kraters belonging to the group III classifica tion of the last decade of the 6 Ct BC. Gela's role in redis tributing these kraters in Sicily is also underlined. Figured Attic pottery found at Gela has been the focus of considerable attention in recent years, as witnessed particularly by two publications: R. Panvini and F. Giudice, Ta Attika. Veder greco a Gela: ceramiche attichefig?rate dall'antica colonia (Rome 2004); R. Panvini, Ceramiche attiche fig?rate del Museo Archeologico di Gela. Selectio vasorum (Venice 2004). Three lekythoi, said to be from Gela, by the Pan Painter in the Museum of Art of the Rhode Island School of Design are published by R. Holloway (Studi De Miro, 401-04). G. Barone (Peri?dico di Mineralog?a 71 [2002], 273-87) reports on his preliminary analysis of transport amphorae of the 6th and 5th Cts BC found in excavations, concluding that they were all made in Gela itself, with one exception in nearby Agrigento. N Aegean transport amphorae of Ar and Cl date found at Gela have been published by G. Spagnolo (Z udiDeMiro, 619-41). This is an important article of a class of material that is still too little known, as the author herself notes. The amphorae, where identifiable, come from Thasos and Mende, and the conclusion is tentatively drawn that Athens may have been an interme diary in bringing N Aegean wines to the Geloan aristocracy. L. Sole (AHN 49 [2002], 285-320) publishes 200 recently confiscated coins. There are also several developments to report regarding the LAr shipwreck discovered in 1988 in the waters off Gela (cf. AR [1995-1996], 98). An overview of the finds is provided by R. Panvini and her collaborators in La nave greca arcaica di Gela: eprimi dati sul secondo relitto greco (Caltanissetta 2001) (an English version translated by B.E. McConnell appeared in the same year). As declared in the subtitle, this volume discusses a second shipwreck, discovered in 1990 about 1km E of the first wreck. This second wreck dates to the 3rd quarter of the 5th Ct BC and contained ballast from E Sicily, which suggests that it stopped in at ports there on the way These wrecks raise all kinds of questions, including those of conser vation, for which see A. Giglio et al, Archeologia Marittima Mediterr?nea 1 (2004), 99-108, who point out that the fragments from the first shipwreck were kept in improvised tanks without treatment for fifteen years (cf. also ArchViva xxiii.103 [2004], 10). Some first thoughts on the Attic material recovered from the first wreck can be found in F. Giudice, Studi De Miro, 363-68. The faunal material recovered from both wrecks, some 99 items in total, has been studied by C. Di Patti, R. Di Salvo and V Schimmenti, QuadMuseoSalinas 1 (2001 [2003]), 121-24. The remains all belong to domesticated animals and consist of bos/taurus, equus asinus, equus sp., ovis/capra, aves gen e sp. indet, and other unidentifiable types. The bos/taurus show signs of butchering and are argued to have been killed for the crew's sustenance. The equus and ovis/capra material shows no signs of butchering and may have been used, respectively, for transport and/or trade purposes and for milk for the crew. The birds were probably consumed for their protein. A helmet of Chalcidian type, datable to the 6th/5th Cts BC, was also retrieved in the waters off Gela (Archeo xviii.6 [2002], 10). Investigation of the alleged find-spot revealed no signs of a wreck, and hence its archaeological context remains uncertain for the time being. There are also some studies on Rom to Med topics to report. A general round-up of Rom Gela and its hinterland features in R.M. Carra Bonacasa and R. Panvini, La Sicilia centro meridionale tra il 2. ed il 6. sec. d.C: catalogo della mostra: Caltanissetta-Gela, aprile-dicembre 1997 (Caltanissetta 2002), 57-93, 269-72. For the Med pottery from work in Piazza Umberto I, see S. Fiorilla, SicArch xxxii.97 (1999 [2001]), 75-86. A multi-period field survey, spanning PH to Med times, has been undertaken in this period in a portion of Gela's territory. J. Bergemann, director of the survey, has kindly supplied the following report on its aims and early results: 'Since 2002 about 200km2 have received archaeological survey by a German team from Ruhr University, Bochum. A combined method of intensive and extensive survey has been developed, which fits with local conditions on the ground (Fig. 18). At present, only the sites which have been identified by extensive walking are being surveyed intensively by collecting all visible material on the ground. In this way almost 250 new sites have been identified: from the BA (35 sites), through Gr (126 sites), to the Rom and Byz (63 sites) periods. The sites consist of BA rock-cut chamber tombs and settlements, Gr farm sites, sanctuaries and necropoleis, and Rom villae rusticae, agro-towns and necropoleis. The survey work was completed in 2005, and its area is at present probably the best-known area from an archaeological viewpoint in all of Sicily.</page><page sequence="49">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001 -2005 171 18. Gela: part of survey area, with arrows indicating finds Settlement intensity oscillated in quite a characteristic manner. During the BA, down to about 1500 BC, there was dense settlement over the whole area. Thereafter, the number of sites diminished significantly, so that in the EIA, before the arrival of Greeks, indigenous populations occupied only a few sites in safe positions on hill-tops, such as Butera, Monte Desusino, Monte Bubbonia and others. The Greeks arrived in a mostly uninhabited costal and inland area, which may explain why they were able to establish themselves all over with a large number of farm sites and sacred precincts, even around the earlier indigenous settlements (Fig. 19). During the 7* and 6th Cts, and culminating in the 4th Ct BC, an all-time high of settlement density can be observed. After the destruction of Gela (282 BC), there remained only a few settlements, though it is interesting to observe that some new settlements appeared in Gela's former territory in Hel times. In E and L Imperial times a whole new system of settlements can be observed; there were fewer sites, but in many cases they came into existence as larger and much more densely inhabited agro-towns. Recent scholarly literature maintains that Gela's costal plain was not inhabited in antiquity. However, our survey has detected some 30 sites, both Gr and Rom, and in particular Ar Gr settlements. It is obvious that Greeks also settled the coastal plain in the 7th and 6th Cts BC, although the coastline probably was less straight and had more bays at the river mouths than today. This problem will be treated more in detail in 2006 in co-operation with coastal geologists. The project's starting-point was the question of Gr-native relations throughout the colonial period. The dense record of Ar ceramics recovered in the survey creates a valid base to answer this question. Evidently, there was no precisely defined border between Gr and native territories. As elsewhere in the W Gr world, no Gr border inscriptions (horoi) are known so far from Gela's chora. But the arrival of Greek settlers caused intense contact between both populations for several centuries, which ended in an overall assimilation of mostly the indigenous people and vice versa. The local settlements close to the coast were surrounded, after only a few generations, by inhabited, stable Gr farms, which occupied the mostly unused soil. The indigenous settlements in central Sicily slowly adopted Gr urban models and other cultural features. The character of 'Mischkultur' remains extant for several centuries. By the 4th Ct BC even the rural economy of isolated farms was adopted in indigenous areas and the settlements started to define themselves as real poleis. The Gela Survey Project continues, therefore, to describe cultural interaction and economic inter dependence between both sides. Results have so far been published in J. Bergemann and U. Gans, MDA1(R) 111 (2004), 437-76.' Significant developments have been made in this period on the publication and housing of the archaeological collections in Caltanissetta. A new museum in contrada Santo Spirito was inaugurated on 27 March 2006, accompanied by an impressive catalogue edited by R. Panvini, Caltanissetta. II Museo Archeologico: catalogo, 2nd ed. (Caltanissetta 2006) (1st ed. 2003). The Attic figured pottery has also been catalogued: R. Panvini, Le ceramiche attiche fig?rate del Museo Archeologico di Caltanissetta (Bari 2005). Rom finds retrieved in and around Caltanissetta are discussed in R.M. Carra Bonacasa and R. Panvini, La Sicilia centro-meridionale tra il 2. ed il 6. sec. d. C: catalogo della mostra: Caltanissetta-Gela, aprile dicembre 1997 (Caltanissetta 2002), 237-67, while a report of Byz to Norman tombs near the Santo Spirito Abbey, on the outskirts of Caltanissetta, can be found in R. Panvini, Sicilia Bizantina, 199. For Vassallaggi near San Cataldo, W of Caltanissetta, R. Panvini provides an overview of what is known of this anc. hill top site in C. Naro (ed.), Un paese di nuova fondazione. San Cataldo dalle origini ad oggi (Caltanissetta 2002), 7-12. We also have the publication of 78 tombs from the S necropolis excavated in 1956: M. Pizzo, NSc 9-10 (1998-1999 [2000]), 207-395. The tombs date to the last three quarters of the 5th Ct BC, and their rite consisted mostly of inhumation. Pizzo also takes into consideration 184 tombs excavated in 1961, in order to provide a broader base for discussing ritual practices, and hypothesizes the existence of semata, probably in wood, at which libations were made to the dead. Afterwards, the vessels used were intentionally destroyed. Male burials were often accompanied by kraters, knives/strigils and ung?entar?a that can be connected with athleticism and ritual meals. 0 3crn 19.

Province-wide themes can be mentioned here: recent discoveries of native Sicily in Caltanissetta province, mentioned already above for particular sites, are also conve niently summarized in the catalogue of the exhibition held in Hamburg between October 2005 and March 2006: C.

Fiorilla (Sicilia Bizantina, 243-73) rounds up the Byz evidence. WESTERN SICILY Provinces of Palermo and Trapani For Palermo, several general works which contain anc. and Med components have appeared. We begin with a work, mentioned in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 185), that has had two more volumes published in this period: R. La Duca (dir.), Storia di Palermo II: dal tardo-antico all'Islam (Palermo 2000) and Storia di Palermo III: dai Normanni al Vespro (Palermo 2003). There are three new works: A. Calabr? (ed.), Palermo: passeggiate d'autore (Palermo 2001); S. Di Matteo, Palermo: storia della citt?. Dalle origini adoggi (Palermo 2002); P. Todaro, Guida di Palermo sotterranea (Palermo 2002). It is also appropriate to mention here the 'digitization' of the city's historical centre, also exhibited publically: A. Fresina and P. Misuraca (eds), Ortofotocarta digitale del centro storico di Palermo: Palermo 3-20 maggio 2001. Palazzo dei Normanni, Sala G ?alla, Cortile Maqueda (Palermo 2002). These works - as well as those of R. Santoro, Bizantini a Palermo (Palermo 1998), R. Rizzo, Kokalos 46 (2000 [2005]), 193-248, and, to a lesser degree, F. D'Angelo, La citt? di Palermo nel Medioevo (Palermo 2002) - employ mostly literary and archival evidence, but a new and laudable direction to collect fresh archaeological data for the city has been pursued by F. Spatafora of the Palermo Superintendency, with the results appearing in her Da Panormos a Balarm. Nuove ricerche di archeologia urbana (Palermo 2005). Here in overview are the main developments. It is likely that the first settlement was located on the Cassaro's highest part, expanding eastwards in the L6th/E5th Cts BC. The Neapolis occupied the rocky spur down to the sea and was enclosed by a wall, new stretches of which have been discovered in the Santa Chiara convent. The wall is constructed in limestone isodomic blocks, has a thickness of 2.15m and survives to a h. of at least 2m. Further confirmation has also come to light for the Punic city being divided by two main thoroughfares. The Punic city was reorganized in the 4th Ct, but the Romans seem not to have made any changes to the town plan (including the city wall). New Rom buildings, of religious and domestic functions, have been revealed in Piazza Sette Angeli, Piazza della Vittoria and Palazzo Scalfani. In Piazza Vittoria, more excavation was carried out around building B (cf. AR [2000 2001], 185), revealing an arcade with nine by six columns. Evidence of mosaics, a parapet and foundations were found in one of the rooms opening on to the arcade. Excavations in the Palazzo Scalfani uncovered the NE part of a peristyle house, as well as other rooms with decorated floors, and in Piazza Sette Angeli they revealed a big domus or hall of a public office, with geometric mosaic flooring. Rom material has also been found elsewhere. For the Byz period, there appears to have been no change to the city's basic urban framework, though new churches and cemeteries can be noted. The Muslim period brought changes: old buildings were adapted and new features added. For interested readers, it is worth noting that Spatafora has also published these results in other fora: Palermo: The Punic-Roman City (Palermo 2004); Atti elimi IV, 1175-88 (on the anc. period); MEFRM 116 (2004), 47-78 (on the Med period). Studies have also been undertaken on particular periods and themes. CA. Di Stefano (Studi Ciasca, 189-99) publishes seventeen amulets (all except one pendent amulets) with Egyptianising themes discovered in a child's burial in chamber tomb 63 in the Caserma Turk?ry Punic necropolis. The themes include the Eye of Horus, Annubis and crocodile (Fig. 20). These amulets derive from older excavations in this necropolis, but there has also been new work there since the last report (AR [2000-2001], 185). F. Spatafora has kindly supplied the following report: 'Between February and June 2004, excavation continued under my direction in the Punic necropolis located within the Caserma Turk?ry. Around 150 burials in total, all distributed next to one another within the area investigated, were excavated. The data, when considered as a whole, provide fairly precise information on tomb typology and ritual (Fig. 21). The most attested rite was inhumation and cremation in simple burials, sometimes covered with a layer of clay, with provision made later for the collection of burnt remains in an appropriate container, and then deposited on the 8 9 10 11 J2 13 14 15 16 20. Palermo: Egyptianising amulets from Punic necropolis</page><page sequence="51">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001-2005 173 :^0^l ??tlll 21. Palermo: altars from Punic necropolis necropolis floor or in underground chambers. Inhumations were placed, in most cases, in the chamber tomb, which was entirely dug into the calcium deposit and consists of an underground celia of rectangular plan with a flat roof, and entered from the NE by a stepped corridor, cut into the rock and at times very steep depending on the chamber's depth. The entrance was usually blocked with one or more flat limestone slabs, and, in such cases, marked with a cippus, also of limestone. Because most of the burials appeared to be collective, we make the reasonable proposal that the members were of a single family group. In a few cases the inhumations also happened to be in sarcophagi placed on the necropolis floor, or, in some cases, in simple burials dug into the rock. These are usually burials of infants or youths and are distin guished by the placement of belongings within the sarcophagus near the deceased. With regard to the distribution of the burials, what appears to be significant is the particular concentration of cremations in primarily the N sector of the excavation area, as well as the fact that most were accompanied by fine grave goods, mostly typical Phoenicio-Punic vases. It is possible, therefore, to speak of an area occupied by the first generation of colonists who arrived in the 7th Ct BC, because some of these burials can be dated, chronologically, to the end the 7th Ct BC. In respect of topography, very revealing was the discovery of a thoroughfare, located in the S sector of the excavation area, which transversed the necropolis in a NW-SE manner: the street is about 3m w., the same dimension of the stenopoi in the city, and corresponds to about 6 Punic cubits ( 1 cubit=51.6cm). The thoroughfare is characterized, in its S section, by two deep parallel ruts, probably due to wagon traffic, and more recently deepened further by water erosion. The tombs were regularly distributed and, on the whole, followed the same orientation of the thoroughfare, which they respected and used from at least the end of the ?'Vstart 5thCt BC The Punic period has also featured in some other studies. G. Manganaro (Jahrbuch f?r Numismatik und Geldgeschichte 50 [2000 (2002)], 1 -20; Atti elimi IV, 847-60) distinguishes twelve types in the SYS-Panormos coinage, each symbolizing a feature of the region, especially the flora and fauna. B. Garozzo (Atti elimi IV, 557-683) devotes a long study to inscribed instrumenta domestica from Palermitano collections; the material includes Punic, Hel Gr and Rom amphorae. On the coins of the Roman city, there is a study by C. Mangano (Atti elimi IV, 861-84). The Porta d'Ossuna catacomb has received a small monograph: R.M. Bonacasa Carra (ed.), La catacomba di Porta d'Ossuna a Palermo (Catacombe di Roma e d'Italia vol. 7) (Vatican City 2001), reviewed by D. Mazzoleni, Archeo xvii.ll (2001), 111. This little volume contains an up-to-date text, accompanied by sufficient illustration, and forms an important contribution to Sicilian catacombs, knowledge of which is presently dominated by Syracuse. The finds from the Porta d'Ossuna catacomb are poorly preserved and not abundant; nevertheless, its hey-day is placed in the 4th and 5th Cts AD, CA. Di Stefano (Sicilia Bizantina, 307-21 ) focuses on the transition from the LRom to Byz periods in the Palermitano, discussing new data and open matters. The use of earth in Palermo's Med architecture is explored by E. Pezzini (CNAM III, 624-28), who observes that earth was used before the Arab period and cannot, therefore, be considered a reliable chrono logical and social indicator. The qanats established by the Arabs in the Palermitano are examined by P Todaro (In binos actus lumina 1 [2002], 7-19). A. Paribeni and A.A. Aletta (AISCOM VI, 669-84) consider the role of the tree in the decorative programme of the Norman Church of the Martorana. For Monreale, in the hills behind Palermo, we have studies on the Med period concerning the documents for the Abbey's territory (F. D'Angelo, Studi Isler, 91-99) and topography (M. Vaggioli, Atti elimi IV, 1247-1317). Still on the outskirts of Palermo, D. Hoyos (Historia 50 [2001], 490-95) returns to the question of anc. Heirkte. He throws his support behind earlier identifications that place it on Monte Pellegrino, the promontory by Palermo, and in particular believes that Monte Castellaccio, the highest point, is the best candidate for the heights occupied by Hamilcar. Clinching the case, in his view, is Polybius' circumference of 100 stadia. E of Palermo at Phoenicio-Punic Solunto, we have a new guide by C. Greco, Solunto: guida breve (Palermo 2005). Coin finds made at the site since the 19th Ct have been collected and discussed by L. Gandolfo (Atti elimi IV, 549-55). Some 600 coins are studied, and they range in date from the M5th Ct BC to the end of the 2nd Ct AD. Rom coins make up 7% of the total. Hel houses have received a monograph: M. Wolf, Die H?user von Solunt und die hellenistiche Wohnarchitektur (DAI Rom Sonderschriften vol. 14) (Mainz 2003). The material is helpfully situated in a comparative perspective. Of the study's many conclusions, we may note that Wolf convincingly demon strates that the so-called Gymnasium is in reality a particularly rich house. M. Bell (Studi de Waele, 93-99) identifies, as he does for Morgantina and Agrigento (see above), certain residences as bankers' houses. On a related topic, we have the preliminary report of work on Solunto's wall-paintings by A. Merra, R. Mandina and C. Gratziu, QuadMuseoSalinas 5 (1999 [2001]), 41-52. All the painted fragments are of Pompeian style IA (1st quarter of the 1st Ct BC) and have been subjected to restoration and mineralogical-petrographic analyses. V. Tusa (Studi Isler, 433-38) restates his belief that the famous so called statue of Zeus should be identified with Baal/Hammon Saturnus. SE at Termini Imerese, G. Manganaro (Jahrbuch f?r Numismatik und Geldgeschichte 48-49 [1998-1999 (2001)], 71-99) focuses on the bronze coinage minted in the 4th Ct BC, reviewing its history and making connections with regional political developments. Stretches of Rom roads leading to the E and SE from Termini Imerese are studied in two articles by A. Burgio and R.M. Cucco (both in RTA/JAT 10 [2000(2002)], 163-82, 183-204).</page><page sequence="52">174 FRANCO DE ANGELIS At Himera, further E, there are several studies on previously uncovered material and some new excavations to report. Visitors to the site can now avail themselves of two helpful guidebooks (both also available in English versions) by S. Vassallo: Himera: guida breve (Palermo 2004); Himera, citt? greca: guida alla storia e ai monumenti (Palermo 2005). Another general work is in the making: namely, the proceedings of the colloquium 'Per servir? la storia di Himera, Palermo 22 novembre 2003', which are slated to appear in Kokalos 49 (2003). For the new excavations, mostly centred on the lower town (and thus continuing a trend: AR [2000 2001], 187), we have an overview by S. Vassallo (PIA VI, 325 33). These investigations have now made it clear that an expansion in the urban plan occurred in the lower town in the 1st half of the 6th Ct BC. As Vassallo notes, Himera's urban coherence was challenged by the decision to expand into this area; nevertheless, the anc. planners successfully laid out, in an area of some 50-60ha, a series of N-S running blocks, each 41m w., separated by roads, each about 6.2m w. At least 24 blocks can be hypothesized to have once existed, each containing oikopeda tentatively estimated to have covered a surface area of 400m2 in each case. The measurements used in the lower town's urban plan differ from those of the upper town, as Vassallo observes, who suggests that the rationale for this is grounded in social and economic factors. Excavations in the NW corner of the lower town have also brought to light, for the first time, a stretch of the city wall. The wall sits on a stone base standing to a height of about 1.5m and was crowned with a mud-brick superstructure, strengthened by rectangular buttresses, especially in connection with the postern gates. Vassallo estimates, on the basis of these new data, that Himera may have covered at least 100ha. Older finds continue to be published and interpreted. Vassallo (Atti elimi IV, 1343-56) collects and analyses the native pottery found in settlement and funerary contexts, so as to counter-balance the easily recognisable and frequently discussed Gr material. He concludes that natives must have been living at Himera as normal members of the community, through intermarriage and general integration. N. Bonacasa (Studi Isler, 41-52) calls for a reconsideration of Sicilian Gr sculpture, following the future publication of the sacred area in Himera III. 2 (the latter volume is apparently still in preparation, having been announced as of imminent publication in the previous two reports). M. Torelli (Studi De Miro, 671 83) attempts to identify the cults connected with the various structures in this sacred area: temple D is thought to have been dedicated to Athena, temples A-B to Aphrodite and temple C to Zeus Soter. A. Brugnone (Atti elimi IV, 75-89) publishes a very fragmentary bronze tablet found in this sacred area. Brugnone notes parallels with the Chalcidian laws from Monte San Mauro, wondering if the inscriptions were cut by the same workshop and reflect deeper underlying institutional connections between Chalcidian settlements. Ionic cups from a votive deposit in temple A are published by V. Tardo (Kokalos 46 [2000 (2005)], 381-415), who tackles the challenges of distinguishing regional manifestations of this catch-all pottery type and calls for further work at Himera and elsewhere along these lines. Bonacasa (Studi ClassiciBB, 135-48) publishes seventeen 'caricature' terracottas, all from the upper town and all dating to the 2nd half of the 5th Ct BC. On coins, A. Cutroni Tusa (Studi Cristofani, 120-23) considers silver litrae from Himera and museum collections which have, on the obverse, a bearded and horned male human figure with the hind of a lion and, on the reverse, a naked youth riding on top of a goat with one hand holding one of the goat's horns and the other holding a caduceus. She notes that their weights wary between 0.63 grams and 0.89 grams and suggests a date for this series in the L5th Ct BC. Down in the lower town, C. Zoppi (Sicilia Antiqua 2 [2005], 111-21) looks closely at the horizontal carvings on the steps of the Temple of Victory, which suggests architec tural links with Syracuse. In the Pestavecchia necropolis E of the anc. city, we now have S. Vassallo's publication (Kokalos 45 [1999 (2004)], 329-79) of the transport amphorae, mentioned in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 187). Of the novelties, we may note a Cypriot amphora of the L7th/lst half of the 6th Ct BC and certain unidentified amphorae that are a cross between various well-known types (Fig. 22). An inscription in prosody from this necropolis on the base of an Attic kylix was published by Vassallo and Brugnone (ASNP 3 [1998], 323-26) in the previous reporting period. The kylix and inscription date to the end of the 6th/E5th Ct BC. On the countryside beyond the city, another volume has appeared on the most recent phase of the field survey: O. Belvedere et al, Himera III/2: prospezione archeologica nel territorio (Rome 2002). Some of the same researchers connected with this work have published elsewhere two articles on particular features of the project: O. Belvedere et al, Archeologia e Calcolatori 16 (2005), 129-52 explore the relationship between geomor phology, post-depositional processes and visibility, and D. Laura, Archeologia Aerea 1 (2004), 193-214 outlines the part played by air photography, which has revealed traces of land division and buried structures. A change to large estates has been noted for the Rom period. Further E at Cefal?, two relevant studies have appeared in this period. One is a brief general work, with several colour illustrations: G. Chiaramonte, Frammenti della Rocca: Cefal? (Palermo 2002). The other is a plea for systematic work on, 22.

SE of Cefalu in the mountainous interior is Gangi, where there has been some recent work by G. Storey, who has kindly provided the following report: 'Gangivecchio is a 14th Ct Benedictine Abbey on a 56ha estate (Fig. 23). From surface survey and several test pits, a French-Sicilian team in 1974 concluded that Gangivecchio was a Rom occupation from the 1st to 5th Cts AD. Investigations resumed in 2000 by the University of Iowa, in co-operation with the Palermo Superintendency, confirmed the previous results with five test pits. In addition, what appear to be highly eroded Gr bf sherds were found in a deep sounding in the Abbey, as well as Gr common wares on the W side of the property, distinct from the Rom ceramics on the E side. Further investigations in 2004, with five more test pits and ground-penetrating radar, in 22 radar grids covering 3,500m2, showed numerous sub-surface features all over the property. Radar showed the remnants of a large structure in parcel 19, probably the remains of a Rom villa. A test pit in the courtyard confirmed a radar target as a crypt cap stone for a LRom burial under a possible Byz structure. In 2005, three soundings in the Abbey courtyard testing another radar target found a possible church structure pre-dating the Abbey (possibly the pavement of the Church of Santa Maria dell' Annunziata, known from documentation but never located), with a LRom necropolis underneath, containing women and children interred in a tight stack at the bottom of a prepared crypt and buried with several whole vessels dating to approximately AD 350. Investigations to this point have not conclusively established the nature of the site, which has been in the past and remains currently a possible candidate for the lost city of Engyion, described by Diodorus Siculus. However, the site may also have been the asty (lower city) in tandem with the remains of the Balza di Pezzalunga, 3km to the NW, which may have been the acropolis (upper city) of a Gr colonial centre. The four natural springs pouring water out of the moun tainside connected with the Abbey, plus the permanent flow of the river Gangivecchio coursing just S of the Abbey, eventually connecting to the river Himera, point to the crucial importance of water on the site. Local tradition concerning the presence of the cult of the Dee Materes, plus the Ch associations with the Virgin Mary, attest to the importance of the site as a possible long-standing cult centre. The basement of the Abbey is very like the barrel vault of Rom bath-houses found in Sicily, although the date of the basement is undetermined. A very deep radar test showed a rectangular structure 3m-5m below the current surface of the Abbey courtyard, very suggestive of the celia of a Cl period temple. The upper levels of the Abbey courtyard could be the necropolis of the Rom villa in parcel 19,</page><page sequence="54">176 FRANCO DE ANGELIS and the pattern of mixed period burial contexts next to a cult structure is not unlike the many burial complexes around the main temple complex at Agrigento. Future work will be devoted to establishing the precise nature of the site.' Almost due W, at Polizzi Generosa, the excavations in the Hel necropolis discussed in the previous report (AR [2000 2001], 188) have encouraged the opening of a small local museum in the town hall in 2001. A. Tullio (Studi ClassiciBB, 121-34), the excavator of this necropolis, has also analysed closely an E4th Ct amphora depicting Herakles fighting the Nemean Lion, revealing not only the potter's fingerprints but also, more importantly, that the amphora represents the (still too little understood) transition between proto-Siceliot and proto Campanian pottery. Almost due W, at Caltavuturo, we have a colourful little study of the 4th Ct BC gold phiale that was recently returned to Italy after having been illegally excavated (cf. AR [1987-1988], 139-40) and sold to a customer in the USA: F. Spatafora and S. Vassallo, La phiale aurea di Caltavuturo (Palermo 2005). To the SW, some new excavations have taken place at Castronuovo di Sicilia. The excavator, S. Vassallo, has kindly supplied the following report: 'In the summer of 2005, the Palermo Superintendency's excavations at Monte Kassar, near Castronuovo di Sicilia, permitted investigation of an imposing fortification, which, though known since the 19th Ct, had remained unexplored (Fig. 24). The fortification enclosed a large settlement, occupied in the Ar period (7th to E5th Cts BC) and again in the Byz period (6th-9th Cts AD). It is probably to the latter period that the fortification should be dated. The wall, which runs for 2km and has an average w. of 3.5m, is constructed of limestone blocks bonded with mortar. Eleven towers and three gates have been identified; the easternmost gate, which has almost entirely been uncovered, was defended by two quadrangular towers (ca 8m by 9m) which stand on either side of an entrance (ca 3.8m) sealed off with a portcullis on the exterior and a large wooden door on the interior. Research on this fortification, an extraordinary and isolated example of an EMed defensive system in Sicily, will continue in the immediate future. In contrada San Luca, elsewhere in the territory of Castronuovo di Sicilia, research has resumed in a Rom villa, first explored with test trenches in 1992 (Fig. 25). The site covers an area of about lha and was occupied contin uously from the 5th Ct BC to the end of the Byz period in the 9th Ct AD, although its most monumental phase was the Rom villa, built in the 1st Ct BC and used, with some renovations, throughout the entire Imperial period. A peristyle (ca 23m by 20m) has been discovered, flanked on three sides by a colonnade and on the fourth by pilasters. Not far away is the villa's pars rustica, where a long building (ca 20m by 7m), probably used for the processing and storing of agricultural products, has come to light.' The PH metal-working moulds from Colle Madore, to the N, that were briefly mentioned in the last report (AR [2000 2001], 192) have recently been published in detail by S. Vassallo (AWE 3 [2004], 20-37). Prehistory is also the theme at Roccapalumba to the NE: S. Gagliardo, Roccapalumba e il suo territorio nella preistoria (Palermo 2005). There are developments to report for Montagnola di Marineo, NW of Roccapalumba. A new museum, housing regional archaeological finds, opened in 2004. This museum already contains some of the finds made in excavations on the Montagnola, where investigation is ongoing. F. Spatafora, director of this project, has kindly supplied the following report of her recent work there: 'In 2003 and 2005 further excavations were carried out on Montagnola di Marineo. Work focused on the anc. settlement, recently identified, thanks to the discovery of a group of tiles inscribed with Gr letters, with anc. Makella, known from written sources. The group of tiles came from an area immediately behind and W of a large cistern with a vaulted roof. This find-spot, together with the structure's dimensions, suggests a public context. The inscriptions were engraved before firing with a pen or stick; the script, which was very fluid and written in a cursive capital style, dates to the Hel period. Inscriptions on tiles and bricks, rare in the Ar period, are common from the beginning of the Hel period until the L Imperial period. Nevertheless, as opposed to the spread of stamped tiles, whose recognition inside a different set of tiles is largely agreed upon, those inscribed by hand prior to firing turn out to be less numerous. The brick material ordered by a city was usually used for public buildings, as discoveries have shown elsewhere in Sicily (Monte lato, Segesta and Lipari). Montagnola di Marineo was strategically situated to control the Eleuterio river valley, very important for communication from Sicily's S and N coasts, and thus between Gr and Phoenicio Punic settlements. Work in habitation contexts and the area of fortification, which is nearby, also uncovered an important votive deposit of Gr-type bronze armour. Overall the settlement was continuously occupied from the 9,h-8th Ct BC until, at least, the late Norman period; new and significant light has been shed on the organization of the urban area during the course of the various periods. Above all, an EIA phase has been revealed with clarity, characterized by the presence of simple huts and artefacts with parallels to material from central W 24.

Also better established was the extent and typology of the small iron workshop set up near the city wall after its destruction in the First Punic War. Excavations along the line of the fortification also revealed an extensive Hel building, re-used in the Med period.' The studies in this period on Corleone, to the SW, have focused on the Med period: J. Johns (Sicilia Bizantina, 275-94) on Arabs under Norman rule; N. Scalisi (Sicilia Bizantina, 295-306) on the Jewish community. For Entella, SSW of Corleone, the work by the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa has followed the pattern seen in the previous report (AR [2000 2001], 191): new fieldwork and the study of previously known material. Pride of place in this discussion must be given to the catalogue and exhibition on the Entella Tablets: C. Ampolo (ed.). Da un 'antica citt? di Sicilia. 1 decreti di Entella e Nakone (Pisa 2001) (reviewed by J.R.W. Prag, BMCR 2002.05.37; F. Cordano, BdA 119 [2002], 95-98). The exhibition travelled throughout Italy in 2002 (cf. A. Corretti, ArchViva xxi.92 [2002], 4-5; M.I. GuUette, Arc heo xviii.2 [2002], 20-21). The catalogue collects, for the first time, everything needed to study the tablets, for which in this volume and elsewhere a new numbering system has been proposed (C. Ampolo, A. Magnetto and L. Porciani, ASNP 6 [2001 (2003)], 1-10). The exploita tion of regional chalk sources in antiquity is investigated by I. Gennusa (Atti elimi IV, 685-92). Entella's coins have been the subject of three studies: I. Lee, The Numismatic Chronicle 160 (2000), 1-66 (on the silver coinage of the Campanian mercenaries); A. Facella, SicArch xxxii.97 (1999 [2001]), 165 68 (on the find-spot of IGCH 2119); A. Cutroni Tusa, SicArch xxxiv.99 (2001), 183-89 (on IGCH 2119 and the first Carthaginian mint in Sicily). A reconstruction of the topography of Timoleon's military activities is essayed by M. Gulletta (Atti elimi IV, 753-825). On ceramics found at Entella, there are publications by M. De Cesare (Atti elimi IV, 253-69) on the figured Italiote and Siceliot, and by A. Corretti and C. Capelli (Atti elimi IV, 287-351 ) on the amphorae from the Hel granary. C. Di Noto (Atti elimi IV, 403-10) has penned a piece on personal ornaments found in Cl, Hel and Med contexts. C. Michelini (Atti elimi IV, 933-72) assembles the available material evidence (aside from the Tablets, it is mainly ceramic and numismatic) for the Hel city between the 3rd and 1st Cts BC, noting its paucity and poor state of preservation in the case of structural remains. For Rom prefects in this period, there is an article by M. Corsaro, in A.M. Corda (ed.), Cultus splendore: studi in onore di Giovanna Sotgiu (Senorbi 2003), 373-96. From the active pen of the late G. Nenci (Studi Isler, 315-17) is an article on the Arab bronze and lead weights. Thorough and timely fieldwork reports on work conducted in the previous and current reporting period have also been published: see especially AA.VV, ASNP 4 (1999 [2001]), v xxv, 1-188; 7 (2002 [2004]), 427-564 (we can include here too: M. Parra, Atti elimi IV, 1029-48). In these reports we learn that a new field survey has been carried out for almost the entire territory (itself some 136.4km2) began in 1998 (on the survey, see also: A. Arnese, Archeologia e Calcolatori 11 [2000], 339-46; Atti elimi IV, 61-70, on the digital database; M.A. Vaggioli, SicArch xxxiv.99 [2001 (2002)], 51-66, on preliminary results for the Punic period; A. Corretti et al, MEFRM 116 [2004], 145-90, on preliminary results for periods spanning LRom to Swabian). A total of 529 sites/scatters has been recorded: they range from a single object to a LRom village of several hectares in size. Of the total, some 266 sites/scatters belong to stable BA-Med settlements, while the remaining 263 sites/scatters are considered 'sporadic'. Study 26. Montagnola di Marineo: city wall of the material is under way. More excavations have also taken place in necropolis A, resulting in a further 39 new tombs, of Ar-Hel date, coming to light. Bone material continues to be kept and studied by a physical anthropologist. Further excavations have also taken place in the city, continuing to reveal Ar layers underneath previously investigated Hel public buildings. Explorations in the city wall's NW sector has provided evidence for its construction in the L6th/E5th Cts BC, as well as later additions of a tower, gate and road in the 2nd half of the 5th Ct BC. The 30 coins (25 are anc. and five Med) from all these new excavations and surveys have also received preliminary study. The Palermo Superintendency has also undertaken some small-scale excavations at Entella, having been called in following chance finds brought to light during afforestation activity (F. Spatafora, A. Ruvituso and G. Montali, Atti elimi IV, 1189-1201). This work uncovered an extra mural sanctuary, for a chthonic cult (practising the Thesmophoria?), judging from the material recovered: lamps, kernoi and statuettes (worshippers carrying piglets). Finds suggest that the sanctuary was in use from the L6th/E5th to 3rd Cts BC. Six Arab burials, comprising simple pits with slab coverings, were found above these sanctuary remains. For Monte Maranfusa, to the N, there are two important developments to note. The first is the final publication of the archaeological research that has featured in the pages of the past few reports: F. Spatafora, Monte Maranfusa: un insediamento nella media valle del Belice (Palermo 2003). This volume is made up of a variety of specialist studies by Spatafora and her many collaborators, and together with the opening in 2004 of the accompanying antiquarium at nearby Roccamena, they form a happy-ending story in Sicilian archaeology. At Monte lato, practically due N, the pattern of research has been the same for this period, namely a combination of new excavations and publication of previously uncovered material (AR [2000-2001], 190-91). We begin with a new guidebook: H.P. Isler and F. Spatafora, Monte lato: guida breve (Palermo 2004). On Monte lato in the bigger scheme of Sicilian Ar and Hel history, see S. Consolo Langher (Atti elimi IV, 271-85). J. Fuchs K?ch (Studi Isler, 175-82) examines depictions of birds on Ar and Cl pottery. H. Taeuber (Tyche 18 [2003], 189-200) rounds up and discusses the graffiti found at Monte lato. S. Frey-Kupper (Studi Isler, 159-73) publishes a new 'Acheloos' coin and reconsiders early coinage at the site. An overview of Hel architecture in light of recent discoveries can be found in H.P. Isler, in R. Frei-Stolba and K. Gex (eds), Recherches</page><page sequence="56">178 FRANCO DE ANGELIS r?centes sur le monde hell?nistique. Actes du colloque interna tional organis? ? l'occasion du 6(f anniversaire de Pierre Ducrey (Bern 2001), 259-68. On the theatre, there are two studies by Isler: SicArch xxxiii.98 (2000), 201-20; Dioniso 1 (2003), 276-91. The laconicum mentioned in the previous report has been the subject of a full study by M. B?rge (Studi Isler, 57-66). The Byz period has not gone without attention: H.P. Isler, NAC 29 (2000), 357-85. On the conservation work undertaken at the site, see articles by F. Spatafora and H.P. Isler, in A. Sposito (ed.), La conservazione affldabile per il patrimonio architettonico (Palermo 2004), 162-64, 184-85. On the new excavations, H.P. Isler, the director, has graciously furnished the following report: 'At Monte lato the pattern of excavation continues to be annual seasons of five weeks' duration. Work concentrated in the Gr agora and in different areas of the W and E districts. Excavations have continued in Ar layers underneath the Hel pavement in the SW part of the agora. The first layer rests directly on the bedrock and dates to the beginning of the 6th Ct BC, and the second layer dates to the 2nd half of the 6th Ct. Two entrances to the agora have been found, both dating to about 300 BC. In the W district, the excavation of a LAr courtyard house has almost been completed. The house's dimensions (28.8m by 18 m) are notable for the period. It was possible to excavate stratified 'pre-colonial' deposits in the area E of the peristyle house 1 ; the oldest material dates to the 8th or 9th Ct BC. The area proved to be covered with another LAr building, possibly an oikos temple, of contemporary date with one found further N that is currently being excavated. Intruding in its SW part is an Augustan period room with opus signinum pavement and third style decoration (Fig. 27). Outside peristyle house 2 the remains of Cl dwellings have been identified. In the E district, a thick Ar layer was uncovered under peristyle house E 2, in which was excavated a house with door and hearth (Fig. 28), destroyed in the 1st half of the 6th Ct BC. Another group of Ar houses, recovered from Cl, Hel and Med constructions, has been located in the area near the mountain. Annual reports are published in: Antike Kunst 45-49 (2002-2006) and SicArch xxxv. 100-xxxvii. 102 (2002-2004). See also Atti elimi IV, 827-38.' NW of Monte lato is Terrasini on the coast, where G. Mannino (SicArch xxxvii.102 [2004], 107-28) has published the results of his archaeological explorations in the surrounding caves. He has recorded 26 sites, with material stretching, as is only to be expected, from PH to mod. times. In an important appendix, Mannino throws water on G. Pottino's theory (cf. AR [2000-2001], 186) that the walls he discovered on Monte Palmeto are to be connected with anc. Heirkte. As we saw earlier, this is usually placed on Monte Pellegrino close to Palermo. Mannino calls for new work to test this theory. At Capaci, further along the motorway to Palermo, Mannino, in another article (SicArch xxxiv.99 [2001], 113-29), publishes the latest PH finds from the area. At Isola delle Femmine, off the coast to the N, L. La Rocca (SicArch xxxvii.102 [2004], 171-85) examines the history offish-processing here, taking the story back into periods covered by this report. We come full circle in our review of Palermo province with another island, Ustica, 57km N of Palermo. We begin with the American work discussed in the previous report (AR [2000 2001 ], 188-89), including a preliminary report (R.R. Holloway, Studi RiunioneBB, 239-45) and a final report by R.R. Holloway and S.S. Lukesh, Ustica II: Excavations of 1994 and 1999 of the Regione Siciliana, Soprintendenza ai Beni Culturali ed Ambientali, Provincia di Palermo in collaboration with Brown University (Providence, RI 2001) (both volumes of the final publication are reviewed by R. Leighton, AJA 108 [2004], 103 27. Monte lato: W district, Augustan-period room from SW 28. Monte lato: E district, Ar house from SW 06). Lukesh and Holloway (Antiquity 76 [2002], 974-79) have also published a vigorous defence for the authenticity of the tufo sculpture, observing that the photographs published by Sicilian prehistorians to attack the sculpture's authenticity are those of a second image in stone that is different from the discovery they made through excavation. There have been new excavations at this same site by the Palermo Superintendency. F. Spatafora, director of these excavations, has generously supplied the following report: 'The village at I Faraglioni is one of the most important complexes in both PH Sicily and the Mediterranean. The settlement's principal phase of use can be dated to the MBA Thapsos-Milazzese ./?feto (1400-1250 BC) that was widely distributed in E Sicily, the Aeolian Islands and at several sites in W Sicily. Excavations resumed in 2003, carried out under the direction of the present writer with the collaboration of Enrico Procelli (Catania). Investigations continued in 2004, allowing for considerable advances in our understanding of the settlement's chronological and cultural sequence and use of intramural space. It is evident that housing was constructed on two terraces of different elevations connected by a short ramp (Fig. 29). Exploration of a large portion of the upper terrace in the SE part of the village has added new and significant evidence regarding the village's overall plan. In addition, huts and adjoining enclosures have been found on either side of a road, about lm wide, that in turn runs parallel to another road uncovered in earlier excavations. The road turns at nearly a straight angle northward and then it descends towards the lower terrace. It is very clear from the stratig</page><page sequence="57">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001-2005 179 raphy how the road relates to the last phase of the village's life and how the road adjusts its course to the walls of the huts along it. To the sides of the roads the huts do not appear to be regularly placed side by side, like the stretch of road that was revealed in the lower terrace, but rather they seem to be grouped around an open space, a common courtyard. The same organization of space seems to characterize the nucleus of huts discovered in the W central part of the village, where the huts are distributed around a type of open courtyard, with a large stone mortar placed in its centre. In regard to the forti fications, work has concentrated on their N half, where extensive tests had never been carried out and where fewer of the so-called towers seem to be found. Until now, nine semi circular towers had been recognized in the S part of the settlement, and possibly a tenth tower in this N part. Excavations between towers 9 and (presumed) 10 in 2003 2004 brought to light four more small towers/buttresses, but not presumed tower 10: only a row of large shapeless blocks resting on a previous level of collapse was found. These blocks are likely related to the collapse of the upper courses of the actual wall. It is likely, therefore, that, following the collapse, the reinforcing semi-circular towers were constructed, all of them, with the exception of number 3, resting on the line of fortification.' A brief report of this and previous work at Ustica, as well as some recent underwater discoveries made by the annual field school, has appeared: F. Spatafora and G. Volpe, ArchViva xxiii.105 (2004), 80-84. For Trapani province, we begin with Trapani city itself. A general history has been produced by A. Filippi, Un antico porto del Mediterr?neo: archeologia e storia di Trapani dalVet? arcaica a quella bizantina (Erice 2005) (cf. also his articles in SicArch xxxv.100 [2002], 73-87; Atti elimi IV, 497 506), On Cl coins found in Trapani, there is an article by A. Cutroni Tusa (SicArch xxxwl 101 [2003], 149-52). Interest has also been shown to the Med period on its own. An overview of settlement in Trapani province is provided by F. Maurici, Medioevo trapanese. Gli insediamenti nel territorio della provincia di Trapani dal tardo antico alle soglie deU'et? moderna (Palermo 2002) (cf. also his article on the Byz portion of this study in Atti elimi IV, 885-931). A province-wide overview of Byz painting can be found in A. Testa, Sicilia Bizantina, 559-91. We can also mention here a new museum at Paceco for Trapani's hinterland (M. Vento, SicArch xxxv.100 [2002], 145-47), and the publication of a LRom shipwreck in the waters off Marausa S of Trapani (S. Tusa, B. Ampola and F Lentini, SicArch xxxvii.102 [2004], 151-70). 29. Ustica: houses NE of Trapani city is the hill-top town of Erice (anc. Eryx), where there are some new excavations and studies to report. A general history has been written by L. Zichichi, Storie di Erice (Palermo 2002). Two closer looks at the Ar city wall have been published. D. Zirone (SicArch xxxii.97 [1999 (2001)], 35-54) revisits the results of the 1967 excavations, calling for further work, and S. Tusa and F. Nicoletti (Atti elimi IV, 1215-38), recognizing the same need, report on their stratigraphie excavations, concluding that the city wall was built in the L7th/E6th Ct BC in response to Gr settlement in W Sicily For the Flower of Adonis on coins, see I. Lee, The Numismatic Chronicle 159 (1999), 1-31 (missed in the last report). G. Garbini (RAL 15 [2004], 25-32) argues that Eryx, not Lilybaeum, inherited Motya's role as port after 397 BC. An attempt to locate Dorieus' first settlement in Sicily called Herakleia, which is usually placed somewhere around anc. Eryx, is made by M. Vento, SicArch xxxvi. 101 (2003), 143-48. In the waters off San Vito lo Capo, NE of Erice, S. Tusa (Sicilia Bizantina, 677-86) reports on a Arab-Norman shipwreck, as well as two other wrecks of the same period in waters closer to Palermo. For Alcamo, to the SE, we have two volumes of topographic survey published by the local scholar, I. Messana: La preistoria ad Alcamo (Alcamo 2003); Alcamo romana e araba: lefattorie, i casali (Alcamo 2004). A. Filippi (Sicilia Bizantina, 375-83) also tackles LRom and Byz rural settlement, as well as a foray into the history and archaeology of the Med site on Alcamo's Monte Bonifato (Archeologia M?di?vale 29 [2002], 275-82). For Segesta, SW of Alcamo, we have a combination of new field research and studies on previously uncovered data to report. The work of the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa discussed in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 194-95) has received a long preliminary report: C. Ampolo et al, ASNP6 (200\ [2003]), 413-510. The Scuola Normale's new work at Segesta took place between 2002 and 2005, for which preliminary reports have already appeared: C. Ampolo et al, ASNP 8 (2003 [2006]), 385-430. Efforts have continued to be directed to the Hel-Rom and Med periods, as they were in the previous reporting period, filling out with more details the picture delineated in earlier fieldwork. Segesta's N acropolis witnessed a major urban transformation in the 2nd Ct BC, with the construction of the agora and public buildings around it. The epigraphic harvest continues to be bountiful, leading one Segestan researcher, S. De Vido (Atti elimi IV, 367-402), to speak of 'Segestan genealogies', whereby the lives of certain male and female magistrates are outlined in so far as they can. The growth of the city centre continued in the Rom period, when, for instance, a round building, identified as a macellum, and temple were constructed, the latter discovered with an inscription in situ mentioning dei forenses. There has been further work by the Trapani Superintendency in the theatre, as reported by R. Camerata Scovazzo (QuadMuseoSalinas 6 [2000 (2002)], 150-64). This work has revealed that the cavea was built on a system of artificial terraces; part of paved road, which may have connected the theatre to the agora, was also uncovered. In the countryside, F. Cambi (Atti elimi IV, 135-69) considers the question of Hel rural settlement at Segesta, arguing that small and medium properties did not disappear in the 3rd Ct BC, but continued unabated at least until the M2nd Ct BC. A sampling of early Imperial Rom fine ware s found at Segesta has been submitted to archaeo metric study, something which has rarely been done in the island (G. Montana et al, Archaeometry 45 [2003], 375-89; cf. also M. Denaro, Thalassa 1 [2004], "l85-222). This work has confirmed its point of departure hypothesis: that there were numerous centres of production in the W Mediterranean,</page><page sequence="58">180 FRANCO DE ANGELIS and that the Segestan samples were made locally. The Med component (LRom to Swabian) of the field survey mentioned in the last report has a preliminary report: A. Molinari and I. Neri, MEFRM 116 (2004), 109-27. Emerging out of this survey work is A. Molinari's discussion (Sicilia Bizantina, 323-53) of the relationship between rural settlement and forti fications in the Byz period (Selinous, discussed below, is also included by Molinari). The Sicilian-Scandinavian project in and around Salemi continued into this period (cf. AR [2000-2001], 197). In the countryside around Salemi, we have reports on a 4th Ct BC settlement (P. Vecchio, M. Kolb and G. Mammina, SicArch xxxvi.101 [2003], 115-26) and on finds from the LRom and Byz periods (M. Kolb and P. Vecchio, Sicilia Bizantina, 839 46). Neutron activation analysis has been carried out on samples of 'Elymian' pottery from the Salemi region (M.J. Kolb and R.J. Speakman, Journal of Archaeological Science 32 [2005], 795-804), revealing details about regional production centres and exchange in the 5th Ct BC. Monte Polizzo, the hill top site located about 6km NW of Salemi, has seen the bulk of the archaeological attention. The following two reports have been kindly supplied by two of the projects. We begin with I. Morris' report of work on the acropolis' summit: 'The international excavations at the Elymian site of Monte Polizzo continued. Teams led by Sebastiano Tusa, (formerly) Superintendent of Archaeology for Trapani province, and Kristian Kristiansen, Professor of Archaeology at Gothenburg, explored the 6th Ct BC settlement, while the Stanford team, directed by the present writer, focused on the religious areas on the acropolis (Fig. 30). Michael Kolb of Northern Illinois University conducted surveys around Monte Polizzo and excavated in Salemi. Stanford University gratefully acknowledges the support of the American Academy in Rome, which sponsors this project and sent students from its summer programme, and of teams from the universities of British Columbia, Calgary, Michigan and Roma 'La Sapienza'. The Stanford team excavated on the acropolis from 2000 through 2004, and conducted a study season in 2005. The main occupation dates ca 700-525 BC. Terracing around 625 BC destroyed most traces of the small 7th Ct village on the acropolis, but a midden preserves layers dating ca 675-525, including good faunal and botanical evidence. Wheat and barley dominate the carbonized seeds, but there is also evidence for legumes and fruit, including wine grapes (Vitis viniferis s. sp. viniferis) dating back to ca 600 BC. Animal bones include sheep, goat, cow and pig; about 5% of the domestic assemblage belongs to wild animals, mostly red deer. The midden also reveals the steady growth in Gr imports, from tiny amounts before 600 to about 15% of the finewares by 525. Phoenician/Punic imports were very rare. A sanctuary was established at the summit ca 625 and went through very rapid changes in the use of sacred space. It began with a series of one-roomed rectilinear shrines on the W terrace (ca 625-600). The W terrace was then converted to open-air use, and between 600 and 575 a circular shrine was built on the upper terrace (Fig. 31). This was modified extensively between 575 and 525, when it was converted into a rectangular open-air enclosure. Burned sacrifices took place on a rectangular altar outside the shrine (Fig. 32). We found three large deposits of discarded ash and storage pottery, containing over 20,000 fragments of red deer antlers. One deposit included human bones from an adolescent. The settlement was abandoned around 525, but the sanctuary continued receiving visitors until ca 350-300 BC, when two small huts were built over it. These were poorly preserved, but finds included Punic bronze coins, limestone dice and a small Punic stele. The entire site was abandoned between 300 BC and AD 1000, when a small village was built on the acropolis. The village was abandoned around 1125. Preliminary reports have appeared in the following places: I. Morris et al, MAAR 46 (2001), 253-71; 47 (2002), 153-98; 48 (2003), 243-315; 49 (2004), 197-279; SicArch xxxvii.102 (2004), 35-90; Kokalos (forthcoming).' On the Norwegian-Swedish work on the hill's lower slopes, the following overview has been provided by its directors: 'Excavations at Monte Polizzo began in 1998, directed by Christopher Prescott of the University of Oslo. A Norwegian Swedish team excavated house 1, dated to the M6th Ct BC. The excavations were resumed in 2002 by Christian M?hlenbock and Kristian Kristiansen of the University of Gothenburg. Additional houses were excavated S of house 1, subsequently named house 2 and house 3. Both dated to approximately the same period. Two additional areas, areas B and C, were opened at the settlement's W end, where traces of additional structures were encountered, also dated to the M6th Ct. The evidence at hand suggests that large parts of the settlement were abandoned around 550, either as a consequence of pillage or perhaps even more likely due to an earthquake. The evidence from the combined accumulation of structures points towards consider able variability in the various households, where particularly house 1 stands out as an exception. It compromises six rooms, occupying an area of around 200m2 in size, compared to approximately half the size for the other houses. House 1 was a multi-purpose structure where we find evidence of everyday activities like cooking, weaving and milling. The great quantities of drinking and eating vessels also provide evidence of feasting as an important practice within the domestic context, combined with features and finds providing evidence of libations. There are, furthermore, two finds which deserve particular attention. The first is a polished stone axe, dated to the LBA and interpreted as an important heirloom. The other is an anthropomorphic drinking cup, found close to a fragmentary bronze bowl in the storage room located on a porch outside the structure's westernmost wall. It has parallels with material from Gratta Vanella in Segesta. The figurative element and archaeological context suggest that it represents a female deity, possibly related to a fertility goddess. The ceramic tradition represented in the structures supplies evidence of a compara tively traditional style, where incised grey ware constitutes around 30% of the sherds from the houses in area A. The dominance is even more articulated as only a few percent are matt-painted ware. The imports constitute 15-20% of the material which includes Gr, Siceliote, Etruscan and a few Phoenician sherds. The excavations on Monte Polizzo have produced evidence which has made it possible to start comparing different households with one other. House 1 is clearly a combination of a profane and sacral structure where the division between the two is rather fuzzy. Further ceramic analysis and more detailed comparisons with other parts of the settlement will, it is hoped, widen the possibility of gaining a broader understanding of the similarities and differences between different parts of the settlement.' There has also been more Italian work on Monte Polizzo's S acropolis, referred to briefly in Morris' report above. These excavations have focused on the area where some trenching had been carried out by V. Tusa in 1970 (see BTCGI x.434 435). Preliminary reports are in preparation. All this new work at Monte Polizzo has re-opened the question of the location of anc. Halykiai, which is usually placed at Salemi (E. Manni, Geograf?a f?sica e pol?tica della Sicilia antica [Kokalos suppl. vol. 4] [Rome 1981], 177-78). L. Lazzarini (SNR 84 [2005], 15-26) publishes a silver litra and some bronze coins attributed to Halykiai, which he locates on Monte Polizzo. Lazzarini then</page><page sequence="59">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001 -2005 181 SSAP excavation 1998-99 ("Profil*") winter stream 30.

Monte Polizzo: incised and stamped dipper (ca 600 BC) from beneath building Al goes on to consider generally Halykiai's coinage, fixing its beginning in about 415 BC with the minting of tetrantes followed by silver litrae. More tetrantes were coined in 390 370 BC. Coin types were related to the region's flora and fauna. SE of Salemi is Partanna, where earlier PH discoveries have stimulated the creation of a new museum: M. Vento, SicArch xxxiv.99 (2001), 193-97. On the S coast, at Selinous, we begin with the general works: E. Miccich?, Selinunte: alia riscoperta della metr?poli greca: guida confidenziale (Catania 2000), as well as the historical treatments by De Angelis and De Voto (discussed earlier under Megara Hyblaia in the 'Southeast Sicily' section). The latter consider the earliest phases of the Gr city, which have been treated elsewhere as well. Early coins are the subject of two studies by L. Lazzarini (NAC 32 [2003], 11-22; SNR 83 [2004], 17-26), who, in one, argues that obols from two hoards sold on the antiquities market belong to Selinous and, in the other, publishes three coins from private collections: two didrachms and the other of unusual weight and diameter (larger than an obol). Coins are usually connected to the physical development of the city-state, and on this subject we also have a paper by C. Parisi Presicce, MDAI(R) 110 (2003), 263-84, who sees two phases behind this process: conquest of the land followed by urban development. On the latter, we have an overview of the German work, past and present, by D. Mertens, in U. Dirschedl (ed.), Die Stadt als Grossbaustelle: von der Antike bis zur Neuzeit (Berlin 2003), 24-31. Their final report on the city walls has been published: D. Mertens, Selinus L Die Stadt und ihre Mauern, 1 vols (DAI Rom Sonderschriften vol. 13) (Mainz 2003). Of the many results, some simply restate ments of previously aired views, we may note the following. Work on the Ar city wall was limited to the stretch investigated in the Gorgo Cotone valley between streets 11 and 6, and the conclusions drawn in preliminary reports remain essentially unchanged. Geophysical survey suggests that the N part of the town plan was never fully occupied and may have contained kilns and an industrial area. Mertens restates an earlier conclusion regarding the walls surrounding the acropolis: they date to between 409 and 250 BC, A large reinforcement wall was added to the N gate's exterior by Dionysius I at some point during his activities at the site, while for the Hel fortification Mertens finds parallels with the Eurylaos fortress at Syracuse (Fig. 33) and credits Agathokles with the systematic reconstruc tion of Selinous' defences on his return from Africa in 307/306 BC. The Germans have continued their work on the agora and Punic period (D. Mertens et al, MDAI(R) 110 [2003], 389-446; AA [2001], 631-62; [2002], 127-31; [2003], 164-65; [2004], 256-59; [2005], 151-55). In the agora, work has been focused on a block on its E side and has revealed equal plot sizes (somehow demarcated by circular stone platforms), a two roomed house with courtyard, shops facing the agora, a cult place and remains of a hestiatorion (built on what seems previously to have been private land). The agora-facing side of this block was monumentalized in the M6th Ct BC, in line with a trend that has long been noted elsewhere in the city at this time. Some of the finds from one of the shops have already seen publication: C. Dehl-von Kaenel (Studi Isler, 101-10) on sixteen fragmentary Ar transport amphorae produced in various part of Greece and the Gr W. Excavations in the middle of the agora have uncovered what is said to be a 'hero cenotaph', a kind of cist grave, whose walls are built of large worked stones. Interestingly, A. Rallo (RA [2002], 194-98), another of Selinous' excavators, has recently hypothesized that the Manuzza necropolis, E of the agora, was where the oikists were venerated down into the 5th Ct BC (and afterwards venerated in another way, with a cult of Tanit, during the city's Punic occupation). Selinous' temples and accompanying myths and rituals have, unsurprisingly, attracted scholarly attention in this period. R. Camerata Scovazzo (QuadMuseoSalinas 6 [2000 (2002)], 15-19) looks at the myth of Europa found on metopes, noting that this is one of the oldest attestations of this myth, which is generally rarely depicted in W Gr art. Its presence is explained by Selinous' unique culture contact setting. E. 0stby (Ag?is und Mittelmeer, 291-98) considers the Ionian elements in Selinous' metopes. M.C. Conti (Sicilia Antiqua 1 [2005], 95 109; see also SicArch xxxii.97 [1999 (2001)], 59-66) collects the evidence for the sima of Temple C, publishing six new fragments in doing so. She attempts to reconstruct their original sizes and re-dates them a quarter of a century later than usually thought. C. Marconi (QuadMuseoSalinas 5 [1999 (2001)], 9-19) argues that Temple C is not likely to be an Apollonion. Conti (Bollettino di Archeologia 51-52 [1998 (2003)], 33-48), in another study, publishes a pinax depicting the myth of Eos and Kephalos discovered in earlier excavations in Temple E (Heraion) (Fig. 34). The pinax, no doubt a votive offering of some kind, can be dated to 530-520 BC and constitutes a rare find at Selinous. EGr influences can be discerned, and a connection can be made with Hera's focus in this temple on marriage. The EC1 metopes from this same temple are examined by K. Junker (MDAI(R) 110 [2003], 227 61), who argues that, since the myths do not depict a common narrative thread, interpretation must focus on the personalities represented. Junker hypothesizes that relations between the sexes are the underlying theme.</page><page sequence="61">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001-2005 183 33.

Both studies follow the traditional idea, insufficiently supported with evidence, that the sanctuary was pan-Sikan. The female protomes from this sanctuary have recently received a monograph: E. Widerkehr Schuler, Les protom?s f?minines du sanctuaire de la Malophoros ? S?linonte (Cahiers du Centre Jean B?rard vol. 22) (Naples 2004). C. Pecoraro (QuadMuseoSalinas 1 [2001 (2003)], 33-44) argues that the similarity of themes depicted on arulae from the sanctuary and on ie piccole metope' (Temple Y) from the acropolis may be due to the latter influencing the former. Pecoraro also observes that the arulae may have been made in Corinth, and that they may be arranged in the sanctuary, like the metopes, with a programmatic criterion. M.C. Conti (SicArch xxxii.97 [1999 (2001)], 55-58) has also published a miniature altar from the sanctuary. We now have a much-needed catalogue, with analysis, of the stelai from the Sanctuary of Zeus Melikhios: M.L. Fam? and V Tusa, Le stele del Melichios di Selinunte (Padua 2000) (reviewed by A. Precopi Lombardo, SicArch xxxiv.99 [2001], 191). The authors, cognizant of the problems with dating, suggest that the aniconic stelai belong mainly to the 6th Ct BC, and the figured stelai start at the end of the 6th Ct BC and continue into the 3rd Ct BC. Native, Gr and Punic elements can be recognized in the stelai, and often the elements are so blended as to be hard to distinguish - a sign of syncretism no doubt. We might also note here the studies published on the lex sacra from hereabouts: S.I. Johnston, Restless Dead: Encounters between the Living and the Dead in Ancient Greece (Berkeley 1999) (reviewed by M. Cropp, Prudentia 34 [2002], 88-91); S. Georgoudi, in G. Hoffmann and A. Lezzi-Hafter (eds), Les pierres de l'offrande. Autour de l'oeuvre de Christoph W. Clairmont (Z?rich 2001), 152-63; A. Brugnone, Kokalos 45 (1999 [2004]), 11-26. R. Kotansky and J. Curbera (Mediterr?neo Antico 1 [2004], 681 ? 91 ) publish three lead tablets (one clearly a curse tablet and the other two may be so) given to the Getty Museum along with the just mentioned lex sacra. In their surviving forms, the tablets are mostly made up of names, two of them new (of possibly Egyptian or Italic origin). A general study of Selinous' curse tablets, from this and other parts of the city, has also recently appeared: L. Bettarini, Corpus delle defixiones di Selinunte: edizione e commento (Alessandria 2005) (reviewed by G. Bevilacqua, ArchClass 56 [2005], 603-07). Close to the W side sanctuaries is the Manicalunga necropolis, excavated in the 1960s, for which the final publication has appeared from the pen of A. Kustermann Graf, Selinunte: necropoli di Manicalunga: le tombe della contrada Gaggera (Soveria Mannelli 2002) (reviewed by M. Albertocchi, Rivista di Archeologia 27 [2003], 161-63). About 218 tombs appear in Kustermann Graf's catalogue, but the old excavation records allow the plans of only 57 to be drawn. Two phases of use are distinguished: 60 tombs belong to the 1st half of the 6th Ct BC, and 140 belong to 500-409 BC (the remaining eighteen cannot be dated). Kustermann Graf notes too much variety in funerary practices to allow patterns to be distin guished, but in general we are dealing with inhumations and cremations. More exact details can be found in her discussion, which also contains extensive analysis of the grave-goods 0 f)cm i_._i_._._i 34. Selinous: fragmentary pinax of Eos and Kephalos</page><page sequence="62">184 FRANCO DE ANGELIS (imported and local pottery mainly). Non-Gr objects are regarded as 'exotica', and not as ethnic indicators. Overall, Kustermann Graf is left with an impression of uniform social structure. We can also mention here the publication of a tombstone in the Getty Museum probably plundered from one of Selinous' necropoleis: M.H. Jameson and I. Malkin, Athenaeum 86 (1998), 477-85. The editio princeps must be read with a note by the late G. Nenci, Kokalos 45 (1999 [2004]), 3-9, who argues vehemently that the tombstone originally came from Selinous and that it must be returned to Italy. The tombstone, which dates to the end of the 6th Ct BC, preserves the earliest attestation of the term Latinos, in this case a personal name, alongside the word Rhegginos (interpreted as a patronym by Nenci or as the place-name by Jameson and Malkin). It is a highly interesting tombstone, providing all kinds of possible windows into cultural interaction in the central Mediterranean. For Cave di Cusa, one of Selinous' quarries NW of the city, S. Tusa (Archeo xxi.4 [2005], 12) sounds a note of caution as one of Europe's largest distilleries is about to be established only a few kilometres away and reminds us of the region's natural and historical importance. We can mention F.S. Calcara's overview (Ar?hStorSic 24 [1998 (2000)], 5-21) of the discovery, theft and recovery of Selinous' bronze Ephebe now on display in Castelvetrano. Given recent interest in Cl reception studies, we can also draw attention to three works which discuss the impact Selinous' sculpture has had on later artists: M. Scalfani, SicArch xxxiv.99 (2001), 167-73; L. Figurelli, QuadMuseoSalinas 1 (2001 [2003]), 89-100; P. Moreno, Archeo xxi.l (2005), 114-17. For the Punic period, we begin with a recent study identifying two earthquakes at Selinous: one earthquake occurred at some point in the 4th and 3rd Cts BC, and the other between the 6th and 13th Cts AD (E. Guidoboni et al, Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America 92.8 [2002], 2961? 82). As mentioned earlier, there is ongoing German interest in the Punic period, especially its houses. Elsewhere, M. Fourmont (SicArch xxxv.100 [2003], 31-33) puts the hexaglyph in the context of the Punic Doric style, and F. D'Andria and L. Campagna (Studi Ciasca, 171-88) examine the development of the Punic settlement in and around Temples A and O built in the Gr period. The well-known Tanit mosaic in the pronaos of Temple A is taken to be part of a larger sanctuary (measuring 44m by 46.5m), with shops and public space as part of the complex. P. Pensabene (Studi De Miro, 533-43) looks at the Rom shipwreck found in the waters off Capo Granitola, SW of Selinous, from the point of view of the marble trade, concluding that the cargo bears witness to inter-provincial trade in pre-fabricated and partially worked architectural parts. We turn next to Mazara del Vallo, to the NW, where the single most important item to report concerns another underwater find, namely the so-called 'S?tiro Danzante' (found in the previous recording period, when it was tentatively being called 'Aeolus': AR [2000-2001], 145, 159). But first we must mention some other, more general developments, beginning with two volumes on the history of Mazara del Vallo by a local historian: E Gancitano, Mazara prima dei Normanni: dalle origini alle moschee (Castelvetrano 2000); Mazara dopo i Musulmani fino alle signorie: dal vescovado all'inquisizione (Castelvetrano 2001). Some fields and suburban areas, with previously discovered finds, were investigated by topographic survey and published by B. Calafato, S. Tusa and G. Mammina, Uomo e ambiente nella storia di Mazara del Vallo. Indagine topogr?fica nell'agro mazarese (Palermo 2001). The material recovered extends from Pal to mod. times, and the settlement developments noted parallel patterns known from other parts of Sicily: for instance, only one IA site is known prior to the arrival of the Greeks, who settled here in the 6th and 5th Cts BC, and Rom sites were situated for maximum agricultural potential. The authors admit that their work is but a first step, calling for further study. The success of the Rom economy in this region is indicated by another find made in the city itself: a new sarcophagus of the M3rd Ct AD, discovered during restoration work in the 'Cappella dellTncoronata' (C. Di Stefano, Atti elimi IV, 411 -21 ; M. Valentino, Atti elimi IV, 422 35). The sarcophagus, sculpted out of white crystalline marble with a grey-blue vein, is of the lenos type and has the myth of Endymion depicted on its principal side. Most of the excitement in the archaeology of Mazara del Vallo concerns the 'S?tiro Danzante' - the fragmentary bronze sculpture, which, when not travelling, as it did to the World Exposition in Japan in 2005 as part of the Italian pavilion, is on display in a new museum, refurbished out of the former Church of Sant'Egidio in Piazza Plebiscito (the museum has a website: http://www.mazaraonline.it/satiro/museo_satiro_01.htm). Interested readers can also read online several articles about the sculpture's initial discovery, restoration and trip to Japan collected on the website of the city of Mazara del Vallo (http://www.mazaraonline.it/satiro/archivio.htm). Both these websites contain numerous images of the sculpture from these various stages of its recent life. Of course, there has already been much scholarly literature devoted to the sculpture, and with it a wide range of opinions concerning its date, context of display and how it came to rest on the sea-floor of the Sicilian channel, as is only to be expected with a find retrieved in a fisherman's nets. The main bibliography and interpretations are discussed here. Three books have appeared: R. Petriaggi (ed.), // S?tiro Danzante (Milan 2003); M. Curti (ed.), / mille volti del S?tiro Danzante: storia di un eccezionale ritrovamento raccontato dai protagonisti (Alcamo 2004); R. Petriaggi (ed.), // S?tiro danzante di Mazara del Vallo: il restauro e Vimmagine. Atti del Convegno, Roma, 3-4 giugno 2003 (Naples 2005) (for the conference, see the summary by G. Quattrocchi, Archeo xix.7 [2003], 20). The last volume contains articles by authors who have also published their thoughts in other places and are listed here to give a sense of the authors who have stated opinions on the piece: P. Moreno, Kalos 13.3 (2001), 4-8; B. Andreae, Forma Urbis 8.4 (2003), 1; A. Di Vita (Studi De Miro, 293-99); P. Moreno, Archeo xxix.3 [2003], 110-15; E. La Rocca, SicArch xxxvi.101 (2003), 41-52; C. Parisi Presicce, SicArch xxxvi.101 (2003), 25-40; S. Tusa, SicArch xxxvi.101 (2003), 5-24; P. Moreno, CA. Di Stefano, S. Tusa and A. Venditti, ArchViva xxii.100 (2003), 72 77; CA. Di Stefano, Sicilia Antiqua 1 (2004), 81-86; P. Moreno, Archeo xx.7 (2004), 110-12; P. Moreno, Archeo xxii.2 (2006), 114-17. Two other scholars have also weighed in: A. Giuliano, BdA 124 (2003), 1-8; N. Bonacasa, Sicilia Antiqua 1 (2004), 87-109. AU scholars are in agreement that the sculpture is of the Cl style, and that the figure, probably a Satyr (the initial identification as 'Aeolus' has been abandoned), is involved in some kind of vigorous Dionysiac-style dance (some have drawn parallels with the whirling Dervish dance). But there is disagreement as to whether it is an original or later copy, and to how it was originally displayed and came to find itself on the sea-floor. Big names in anc. art (Scopas, Praxiteles and Lysippus) have also been suggested, whether for the sculpture's original execution or at least for its inspiration. The absolute dates proposed by these scholars range from the 4th Ct BC (Di Stefano; Di Vita; Tusa), end of the 2nd/start of 1st Ct BC (La Rocca), 1st Ct BC (Bonacasa; Giuliano), lst-2nd Ct AD (Moreno); M2nd Ct AD (Andreae). As for original context, Di</page><page sequence="63">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001-2005 185 35. Pantelleria: portrait of Julius Caesar i^Sft? mm ^^- Nif-' 36.

Pantelleria: portrait of Titus Vita wonders whether the piece adorned the stern post of a ship, but Bonacasa finds that unlikely on grounds of the piece's weight and pose. Bonacasa, instead, hypothesizes that the piece travelled W in a mixed cargo between the end of the First Mithridaic War and Pompey's take-over of Syria and may have been an attempt by Pompey to represent his owner returning from India and Asia. Giuliano thinks that the statue was part of a group originally set up in Alexandria to celebrate Mark Antony's triumph over the Armenians and brought to Rome by Augustus after Actium. In turn, the Vandals may have plundered the piece to bring to it Carthage, on the way to which the shipwreck occurred. La Rocca also sees the piece as belonging to the general plunder occurring in the 2nd and 1st Cts BC, but he does not conjure as specific a context as Bonacasa and Giuliano do. Andrea suspects that the sculpture may been transported in the Byz period, when valuable statues are known to have been moved from Rome to Constantinople. This bronze sculpture will doubtless continue to stimulate discussion and debate in the coming years. The 'S?tiro' was retrieved out of the sea between Sicily and N Africa, and it is on the island of Pantelleria (anc. Cossyra), in this same stretch of water, that some spectacular finds have been made in this reporting period. Pantelleria, the volcanic island covering roughly 83km2, has hitherto rarely appeared in the pages of these reports, but that has now changed with the veritable explosion of research and knowledge, from PH to Med times. We start with some more general works. D. Musti explores the origins of the island's name, in L. Braccesi (ed.), Hesperia XIV(Rome 2001 ), 191 -97. The from-the-ground-up nature of research on Pantelleria has not just been restricted to toponymy; first attempts have been made to establish the 'carta archeologica': M. Tosi, M. Cattani and B. Cerasetti, Ocnus 9 10 (2001-2002), 305-09. All this recent activity has necessi tated the establishment of a new museum, able to meet the demands of the new archaeological reality. In 2004, an exhibition highlighting recent finds was displayed in a temporary space, a former power station, but work is well under way to make the 'Castello Barbacane' in the town-site the permanent seat (R. Baldassari and M. Fragonara [eds.], Pantelleria e V archeologia: parco laboratorio nel Mediterr?neo [Pantelleria 2004]; M. Vento, SicArch xxxvii.102 [2004], 187-94). On PH Pantelleria, attention has naturally turned to the previously known settlement at Mursia and to the 'Sesi' (megalithic funerary monuments): M. Marazzi and S. Tusa (Emporia, 599-609); S. Tusa, Archeo xix.6 (2003), 8-10; S. Tusa, Archeo xx.10 (2004), 8-10. Recent excavations in the settlement at Mursia have revealed three phases spanning the EBA and MBA and in contact with the Aegean and E Mediterranean; one of the finds consists of a small statuette (almost 5cm h.) with crudely sculpted face, eyes, nose and mouth. The island may have been uninhabited until the Phoenicio-Punic period, when the hill-tops of San Marco and Santa Teresa, located 2km S of the main town-site, were occupied. This period has attracted considerable attention, via excavations and surveys: B. Cerasetti, Rivista di Studi Punici 1 (2000), 101-14; E. Acquaro and B. Cerasetti (eds,), Pantelleria p?nica. Saggi critici sui dati archeologici e riflessioni storiche per una nuova generazione di ricerca (Bologna 2006). A fortification system, with monumental gate and towers, of the 4th and 3rd Cts BC has been uncovered. The Romans continued to occupy the site following their take-over of the island. New evidence for this period has come to light from underwater and land contexts. A shipwreck at Suraki being worked by a Bologna team has revealed an amphora stamp with Pompey's name on it, suggesting his presence on the island during his war on piracy (D. Manacorda, Archeo xxi.4 [2005], 104-07). On land, finds include a temple of the 2nd Ct BC, a large domus with tetrastyle peristyle, and a public water-supply system with interconnected cisterns, later filled in, often carefully, with all kinds of discarded material from the settlement. Two of these cisterns contained one of Pantelleria's most spectacular finds: three marble portraits of well-known Rom figures (Figs 35-37): Julius Caesar, Antonia Minor (or, less likely, Messalina or Drusilla) and Titus (see M.</page><page sequence="64">186 FRANCO DE ANGELIS Osanna, T. Schaefer and S. Tusa in SicArch xxxvi.101 [2003], 79-84 and Archeo xix.ll [2003], 8-10; M. Osanna et al, Siris 4 [2003], 63-97). The portraits were quickly put on display in the Palermo Museum (R. Camerata Scovazzo and S. Biondo, QuadMuseoSalinas 8 [2002 (2004)], 131-34), but the exhibition also later travelled to T?bingen, Hamburg and Agrigento, for which catalogues were produced: R.-M. Weiss, T. Sch?fer and M. Osanna (eds.), Casear ist in der Stadt. Die neu entdekten Marmorbildnisse aus Pantelleria (Ver?ffentlichungen des Helms-Museum, Hamburger Museum f?r Arch?ologie und die Geschichte Harburgs vol. 90) (Helms 2004); S. Tusa (ed.), Pantelleria. I ritratti tra storia e archeologia/Les portraits imp?riaux entre histoire et arch?ologie (Palermo 2004). These finds attest to the political and economic importance of Pantelleria in the 1st and 2nd Cts AD, when it had thriving agriculture and industry and served as an important transport hub for traffic from all points of the compass. A thin gold sheet (about 8cm di.), with a face with wild hair in relief, was also found in one of these cisterns (S. Tusa, Archeo xx.l [2004], 12). The face may be that of Medusa, and the sheet may have been a dress ornament. Another shipwreck off Scauri has been explored (L. Abelli, R. Baldassari and S. Tusa, PIA VI, 403-05). The shipwreck dates to the 1st half of the 5th Ct AD and contained a cargo made up mostly of 'Pantellerian Ware' (entrusted to D. Sami for study: PIA VI, 406-12; Archeologia M?di?vale 32 [2005], 401-08). This discovery has encouraged a more general study on this type of ware: S. Santoro Bianchi, G. Guiducci and S. Tusa (eds), Pantellerian Ware. Archeologia subacquea e ceramiche da fuoco a Pantelleria (Palermo 2004) (see also S. Santoro Bianchi, Rei Cretariae Romanae Fautorum Acta 36 [2000], 443-48). The LRom-Byz transition in the island is considered by D. Sami (Sicilia Bizantina, 395-412), who suspects that Pantelleria must have been the westernmost point of the Byz Empire following the Muslim capture of Carthage in AD 697/698. N African imports in LRom-Byz times are explored by S. Massa (Sicilia Bizantina, 385-94). Returning to the Sicilian mainland, we pick up the discussion with Marsala (anc. Lilybaion/Lilybaeum). Two well-known finds, the Punic ship and painted funerary stelai, have received brief general works, written by the same author, M. Vento: La nave p?nica di Marsala (Trapani 2000); Le stele dipinte di Lilibeo (Marsala 2000) (reviewed by B. Parodi di Belsito, SicArch xxxvi.101 [2003], 191). The painted stelai were also the subject of an exhibition and conference (cf. M. Vento, SicArch xxxv.100 [2002], 149). An overview of what was known of the city's topography into the 1990s can be found in yet another work by M. Vento, La topograf?a di Lilybaeum (Trapani 1999). The picture presented there has already been modified thanks to more recent excavations, especially in the archaeological park, where all the land has now been appropriated (see R. Giglio, SicArch xxxiv.99 [2001], 67-83). Here work has been carried out in three specific areas: the decumanus maximus (P. Vecchio, SicArch xxxiv.99 [2001], 85-95), ?nsula I (E. Caruso, SicArch xxxvi.101 [2003], 153-68), and in the 'Grotta della Sibilla' in the Church of San Giovanni Battista al Boeo (R.Giglio, SicArch xxxvii.102 [2004], 91-96; E. Caruso and S. Tusa, SicArch xxxvii.102 [2004], 97-106, and in Archeo xxi.10 [2005], 12-13). In excavating the latter, a fragmentary marble statue (1.18m h.) of a female figure was found on a Med pavement. The marble is medium-grained, of possibly Parian provenance, and the statue, which is missing its head and most of its legs, may have originally stood 1.7m h. Half of the right arm and most of the left arm are also missing. An architectural fragment found nearby, perhaps a tympanum re-used as a threshold, has a Latin inscription on it, a dedication to Venus by someone of senatorial rank. The inscription dates to the 1st Ct AD and may be connected with the statue, which has accordingly been placed between the 1st and 2nd Cts AD. The excavators argue that the Venus' epithet was Kallipygos. This find has again put Marsala on the archaeological map (cf. J. Cardinale, Archeo xxi.6 [2005], 12-13), and the city has been quick to make images of the Venus and its find-spot accessible on the internet (http://www2.comunemarsala.it/marsala_tour/it /sc_anselmi.html). Elsewhere in the city, there was a rescue archaeology excavation in the Via Quarto (R. Giglio, Atti elimi IV, 727-36), which uncovered part of a structure datable to the 4th and 3rd Cts BC, and on the Punic and Med fortifications (E. Caruso, Atti elimi IV, 171-207). The Punic fortification consisted of emplekton construction, towers, fossa and galleries, all said by the excavator to fit the textbook descrip tions of Philo of Byzantium. For the Byz period, R. Giglio (Sicilia Bizantina, 355-74) draws together funerary decoration, while in the countryside P. Merola (Archeologia Aerea 1 [2004], 301-17) reports on the preliminary application of a Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS), which has revealed linear patterning belonging to anc. structures only partially identified by traditional archaeo logical techniques. At Motya, the Phoenicio-Punic island city NE of Marsala, some new work has taken place alongside the study of older material, a pattern unchanged since the last report (AR [2000 2001], 195-96). Some new guidebooks and synthetic works have recently appeared. For the guidebooks, see R. Giglio, Mozia, Lilibeo: un itinerario archeologico (Trapani 2001); C. Lo Nero, Alia scoperta di Mozia (Palermo 2005), to which group might also be added A. Saitta, Mozia riscoperta: ricog nizioni e ipotesi ricostruttive (Palermo 2003). For the synthetic works, see G. Servadio, Alia scoperta di una civilt? scomparsa (Palermo 2003) (on G. Whitaker's excavations); M.P. Toti and M.G. Amadasi Guzzo (eds), Mozia: dalle origini alia riscoperta dell'antica citt? (Trapani 2004); L. Nigro and G. Rossoni (eds), La Sapienza ' a Mozia. Quarant 'anni di ricerca archeologica (1964-2004). Catalogo della mostra, Universit? di Rome ?La Sapienza?, Facolt? di Scienze Umanistiche, Museo dell'Arte Classica, 27febbraio-18 maggio 2004 (Rome 2004). Studies drawing on older data have also been published on particular themes. A. Giammellaro Span? (Studi Ciasca, 545-53) studies the mud-brick structure in Motya's industrial area (K and K Est), noting the use of mud-brick at other Sicilian sites, especially Himera. M.P. Toti (Studi Ciasca, 555 65) publishes the pottery (some 800 items) from a partially excavated dump discovered in 1989 next to kiln M58 near the city's N gate. Most of the material belongs to the 4th Ct BC and is made up of shapes used for the preparation, cooking, serving and storage of food. In another work, Toti (Atti elimi IV, 1203 14) publishes Phoenicio-Punic amphorae in the Whitaker Museum's collection. Some thoughts on Motya's coins are published by A. Cutroni Tusa (Studi Ciasca, 163-70). D.S. Reese (OJA 24 [2005], 107-14) reports four sperm whale vertebrae, crushed purple-dye shells and stone tools from earlier excavations. The material was found in contexts dating to the 6th and 5th Cts BC. The whale vertebrae were employed as platforms for breaking the shells. Reese places these finds in a wider Mediterranean context, providing interesting insights into anc. whaling and purple dye-working in Italy. P. Bernardini (Sardinia, Corsica et Baleares Antiquae 3 [2005], 55-70) returns to the difficult question of the tophet, largely drawing tentative negative conclusions: the urnfield at Motya has nothing to do the with cruel acts depicted in the Bible, it was not used for infant sacrifice and it was not the graveyard</page><page sequence="65">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 2001 -2005 187 of premature children. The rite was not exclusive and homogenous. Bernardini suggests that we need to rethink using the term 'tophet', since it brings to mind images that have nothing to do with what at its most basic level is a sanctuary for children. The very rich final publication for excavations previously undertaken in zone A (cf. AR [1995 1996], 119) has appeared in this period: M.L. Fam?, Mozia: gli scavi nella 'Zona A' dell'abitato (Bari 2002). Rome's 'La Sapienza' University has been carrying out new work in various parts of the anc. city, especially in the area of the kothon. Preliminary reports have already appeared: L. Nigro, Scienze dell'Antichit? 11 (2001-2003), 567-77; SicArch xxxvi.101 (2003), 85-98; Archeo xix.6 (2003), 32-43; Archeo xxii.4 (2006), 42-53; L. Nigro (ed.), Mozia X: Zona C. II kothon, Zona D. Le pendici occidentali dell 'acropoli. Zona F. La porta ovest (Rome 2004); L. Nigro (ed.), Mozia XI: Zona C, il tempio del Kothon (Rome 2005). See also the volume edited by Nigro and Rossoni, 'La Sapienza ' a Mozia, cited above. Among the results, we may especially note the theory that the kothon was a sacred pool, closed off to the sea and fed by a freshwater spring, meant to accompany a nearby recently discovered sacred complex on the kothon's E side. The complex consists of a paved area with temple, whose entrance faced the S gate and dates to the 6th to 4th Cts BC. Five naves of quadrangular columns (the intercolumniation is 3.12m) made up the temple, which also has a rectangular celia and large interior courtyard. A kind of pyramidion was set up as a marker around which offerings of metal and animals were made. This theory has already stirred up reactions, just as the long-known 'Motya Boy' marble statue continues to do. A 1:1 plaster cast of the 'Motya Boy' now stands in the Museo dell'Arte Classica in Rome's 'La Sapienza' University. The reasons for creating this cast, along with an overview of what is known or thought to be known of the sculpture, can be found in the Nigro and Rossoni 'La Sapienza ' a Mozia volume cited above (98-101). Elsewhere, E. Pochmarski (?g?is und Mittelmeer, 299-306) places the piece in a wider WGr sculptural context; P. Moreno (Kalos 14.1 [2002], 12-19) returns to the identification with Melqart; and F. Zevi (Studi De Miro, 749-56) considers Akragantine connections. See also J. P. Thuiller's (CRAI [1999], 1081-1106) mention of the piece in his discussion of another statue from Carthage - an interesting perspective to take. A preliminary air photography investiga tion has happened in this period, part of a larger project already mentioned above (under 'Halaisa' in the 'Northeast Sicily' section): O. Belvedere et al, Agri Centuriati 1 (2004), 199? 215. Almost due W of Motya is a series of low hills known as Montagnola della Borrania, where two seasons of surface survey have now been published by D. Lauro, Kokalos 45 (1999 [2004]), 157-271. The survey revealed 42 sites/scatters in an area of 14km2; the earliest material is Pal and the latest Arab. Most of the material recovered, comprising the usual kinds of surface finds, is thought to belong to villages and small rural settlements, which are particularly thick on the ground in the Rom period, when the sites/scatters cover surface areas of 4-6ha, but none has so far revealed evidence of luxury mosaics and architecture. Small Arab hamlets/villages with accompanying burial plots may be in evidence. On the island of Favignana, NW of Motya, M.L. Fam? (Studi Ciasca, 213-25) discusses discoveries made at the anc. and EMed site roughly 2km SE of the town of Favignana. The finds consist mostly of pottery (like amphorae) and belong mainly to a plundered necropolis, for which two phases of use, spanning the 3rd and 2n Cts BC, can nevertheless be recognized. Also found is a possible agricultural building that may have produced wine or oil. There are some developments relating to the famous naval battle around the Aegades islands that helped to end the First Punic War. M.I. Gulletta (SicArch xxxiv.99 [2001], 97-106) attempts to reconstruct the battle's topography, while S. Tusa (Archeo xxi.3 [2005], 10-12) publishes a confiscated rostrum and a legally retrieved Rom helmet found off Levanzo in 2004. The Times reported on Saturday 7 August 2004 that 25 Punic shipwrecks, victims of the defeat by Rome in 241 BC, have been discovered in the Stagnone lagoon at Marsala (a reference I owe to R.J.A. Wilson). These developments have helped to stimulate new work in these waters, some of it being conducted collabora tively by Tusa and Jeffrey Royal, Director of the RPM Nautical Foundation in Key West, FL. A new shipwreck of the 4th Ct AD has already been found; its cargo comprised, among other things, vaulting tubes. There have also been further publications relating to the Rom shipwrecks in the Skerki bank mentioned in the previous report (AR [2000-2001], 189 90): A.M. McCann, Rei Cretariae Romanae Fautorum Acta 36 (2000), 443-48 (on the amphorae, particularly those of wreck D); 37 (2001), 257-64 (on wreck F); A.M. McCann and J.P. Oleson, Deep-water Shipwrecks off Skerki Bank: The 1997 Survey (JRA suppl. vol. 59) (Portsmouth, RI 2004) (reviewed by J. Lediwanger, BMCR 2007.03.21).
