<plain_text><page sequence="1">KEVOD HATZIBBUR: TOWARDS A CONTEXTUALIST HISTORY OF WOMEN'S ROLE IN TORAH READING1 Alick Isaacs This article suggests a novel approach to the problem of how the talmu- dic concept of kevod hatzibbur (the dignity of the community) should be understood and applied in contemporary Jewish law. The methodology of historical contextualism- not commonly used in halakhic discourse- is employed to reconstruct the historical meanings of kevod hatzibbur in distinctive historical contexts. In talmudic literature, the fear of violating the dignity of the community corresponded to a fear of violating the "masculinity" of the ritual setting of the Torah reading ceremony. By way of extension, the violation of the Torah scroll is related to its anthropomorphosis in talmudic culture. Thus, fears of sexual impropriety might apply not only to the possible violation of the ritual setting by the inclusion of women, but also to the inappropri- ate handling of ritual artifacts whose public meanings are gendered as well. In medieval Ashkenazi literature, the gendering of the ritual situa- tion came to be associated with its sanctity. Ultimately, the violation of the masculine setting banished the divine presence- the kavod- from the synagogue. Those who continue to object to the participation of women in the Torah reading ceremony today must recognize that their halakhic under- standing perpetuates highly specific values found in particular historical contexts. Given that contemporary notions of women and gender are (or at least should be) different from those in the past, it seems appropriate to argue that the exclusion of women from reading the Torah constitutes an indignity that, perhaps ironically, demands correction as prescribed by the talmudic principle of kevod hatzibbur. NASHIM: A Journal of Jewish Women 's Studies and Gender Issues. © 2006 26 1</page><page sequence="2">Alick Isaacs Everyone is included in the counting of seven, even a woman, even a child. One does not bring a woman to read to the public. If a synagogue has only one man who is able to read, he stands, reads, and sits; stands, reads, and sits; stands, reads, and sits- even seven times. (Tosefta Megillah 3:11-12) Everyone is included in the counting of seven, even a woman, even a child, but women may not read because of kevod hatzibbur. (BT Megillah 23a) The Babylonian Talmud in Megillah 23a objects to the active inclusion of women in the Torah-reading ceremony on the grounds that their participation violates the dignity of the community- kevod hatzibbur. The growing demand among many Orthodox women today to play a more active part in synagogue life, and in the public reading of Torah, has sparked a great deal of rabbinic and scholarly discussion of kevod hatzibbur- including a paper published by Rochelle Millen in the pages of Nashim? While the literal meaning of kevod hatzibbur might seem straightforward, there are two significant obstacles to understanding how the term should be interpreted and applied. First, the collective feelings that express a commu- nity's sense of dignity are hard to quantify and arbitrate. Is it possible to set broadly applicable standards for identifying something so variable (across space and time) and subjective as a violation of dignity? Second, the talmudic (and subsequent) usage of kevod hatzibbur is applied to a number of differ- ent violations. In addition to the case of women's Torah reading, the Talmud objects to five other practices on the same grounds: A community may not read from a humash (a scroll containing only one of the Five Books of Moses) (BT Gittin 60a).3 A kohen (priest) may not ascend the podium to deliver the priestly blessing wearing sandals. (BT Sotah 40a ) A (poor) child with ripped clothes may not read from the Torah. (BT Megil- lah 24b) The Torah scroll may not be rolled in front of the community in a way that constrains the members to stand and wait. (BT Yoma 70a ) The cantor in the synagogue may not remove the cloth covering from the lectern. (BT Sotah 39b) 262</page><page sequence="3">Kevod Hatzibbur: Towards a Contextualist History A brief glance at this list yields the straightforward conclusion that kevod hatzibbux is clearly connected in a general way to the dignity of the synagogue environment. However, the more specific qualities that these cases share are not readily apparent. In this paper, I would like to suggest a novel approach to the common denominator that unites these cases and their meanings under different historical settings. To date, two interpretations of kevod hatzibbur have been proposed. Shmuel and Chana Safrai suggested a reading that was closely and specifically tied to the context of women reading the Torah.4 They argued that the talmudic prohibition was related to sexuality. The appearance of a woman center stage before men in a synagogue was bound to attract sexual attention and distract the men from following the Torah reading. According to the Safrais, the intro- duction of impure thoughts into the synagogue was perceived by the Rabbis of the Talmud as a violation of the honor and dignity of the community -hence the use of the term kevod hatzibbur. In a paper published in response to the Safrais, David Golinkin argued that it was a mistake to deal with only one case and that a more comprehensive understanding of kevod hatzibbur must deal with the other uses of the term.5 This response was preceded by an extensive teshuvah (responsum) in which Golinkin makes a halakhic ruling permitting the reading of Torah by women.6 He argues there that kevod hatzibbur is invoked throughout the Talmud to obviate embarrassments to the community. Talmudic and halakhic literature refers to embarrassing or shameful situations as causing genai (shame). In the case of a woman reading from the Torah, the scene itself suggests to an observer that there are no men in the community capable of reading in her stead. Hence, the men are put to shame by her participation. Similarly, the community is ashamed to read from a humash since doing so might lead an observer to conclude that the community is too impoverished to own a full Torah scroll.7 Subsequent authors have said little about the actual meaning of the term and have chosen to direct their attention elsewhere. For example, Mendel Shapiro, Daniel Sperber, and Eliav Shochetman all built their discussions of kevod hatzibbur around the halakhic weight of the concept while taking its specific meaning more or less for granted. Mendel Shapiro and Daniel Sperber each wrote a rabbinic or halakhic statement in favor of women reading the Torah. Shapiro argued that the sense of "shame" experienced by a community is allayed by the current status of 263</page><page sequence="4">Alick Isaacs women in modern secular society. Under today's conditions, a community is entitled to concede its right to object to women's participation in the Torah reading.8 Sperber weighed the dignity of the community against the value of human dignity (kevod haberiyot), arguing that in communities where women feel their personal dignity compromised by their exclusion from participation in the Torah reading ceremony, a ruling that protects their feelings is consistent with the halakhah.9 My critique of this analysis of kevod hatzibbur is as much methodological as it is substantial. The discussions of this term and of its implications for contemporary halakha seem not to give enough credence to the historicity of the concepts involved. Sexuality, shame, dignity, and community each have histories of their own. As Eliav Shochetman has recently argued, a conven- tional reading of halakhic literature does not point to a precedent that supports either Sperber's or Shapiro's insistence that the force of kevod hatzibbur can be overruled. It seems that there is no denying the persistence with which the exclusion of women from Torah reading has been enforced.10 Ultimately, Shochetman insists, "even if evidence of such a precedent could be found, any halakhic ruling on this issue cannot ignore the extent of the custom that women may not partake in the reading of the Torah, which has been accepted by all the communities of Israel."11 Though my primary concerns in this paper are interpretive and not legal, I believe that the alteration of an ancient religious tradition should require more than that the custom seem unusual to us now. Alteration should demand understanding that the social imaginary, the way in which we understand the world, has changed (or needs to change) so fundamentally that we can only with great effort understand what our ancestors thought or begin to see what they saw. In certain cases, practices that have been generated or sustained by a worldview that no longer exists are simply not relevant to our own circum- stances. However, the variety of historical analysis that I believe should pre- cede and accompany the réévaluation of legal premises is not yet considered appropriate to halakhic discourse. It is the subtle changes that take place in the meaning of the halakhic terms themselves that allow ancient ideas to endure over time. As they are subtly adapted, they assume meanings that allow them to remain compelling in dif- ferent circumstances and for different people. In this paper, I shall attempt to make some initial remarks about how the concept of kevod hatzibbur has been understood and framed in different historical contexts. I have chosen to focus 264</page><page sequence="5">Kevod Hatzibbur: Towards a Contextualist History my attention on two particular settings. Based on a rereading of talmudic and medieval Ashkenazi (European Jewish) sources, I shall offer new interpreta- tions of kevod hatzibbur that relate to the correlation between the dignity of the social body and the human body. I believe that this correlation is central to an understanding of the evolution of the term's usage over time. Finally, I shall make some initial remarks about the implications that the methods I use in this analysis might have for contemporary halakhah. The assumption that is implicit to my investigation is that a discrepancy between contemporary understandings of "éigmiy" {kavod) and those presented in a historical recon- struction of the term call for a resolution through adjustment of halakhic prac- tice. I suggest that this adjustment draws its legitimacy from the understanding that the endurance of the halakhic tradition is not a testimony to its consistency through time. On the contrary, it endures by virtue of its capacity to absorb the constant reformulation of concepts such as kevod hatzibbur, allowing their meanings to remain compelling in distinctively different contexts. Interpretive Gaps My primary methodological contention is that a contextualist approach to historical interpretation (rather than an essentialist or legal-positivist one) can facilitate the halakhic process when the method is directed at understanding how halakhic language is (and has, in the past, been) used.12 "Contextual- ism" as a term refers to methodologies (or modes of reading) that delay the moment of presumed understanding of texts- texts written in the more or less distant past- and use that delay to render interpretation self-conscious and self-critical.13 Delay permits a search for unfamiliar or surprising patterns of thinking- interpretive gaps- embedded in what might otherwise be thought familiar uses of language. Contextualist methods question the notion that tra- ditional interpretations and ideas are static in time and that their long histories are evidence of their resistance to change. Thus, they question the presumption that the meanings of words in old texts are made apparent through philological reconstruction alone. The cultural or mental gap that divides the modern reader from a historical text poses the greatest challenge to modern understanding. Texts must therefore be read in cultural context. Applied to the halakhah, the desired effect of a contextualist approach is to slow the process whereby aposek (a rabbi charged with the authority to make 265</page><page sequence="6">Alick Isaacs rulings in matters of Jewish law) decides how to apply the ruling of an old, authoritative text to a new situation. With respect to kevod hatzibbur, &amp;posek might begin by questioning whether the exclusion of women from the Torah reading ceremony continues, without complication, a two thousand year-old practice. Raising this question would imply not that women did read from the Torah in synagogues somewhere at some time in the past, but rather that the persistence of two thousand year-old beliefs and practices is of necessity com- plicated. The contextualist's task is to reconsider in more complex- which is to say, fuller and thus disorienting- terms the exclusion of women from public reading of the Torah. What is it about the presence of women in this ceremony that violated the notion of kevod hatzibbur in talmudic times, and how does this violation relate to the other cases in the Talmud where the term is used? What was the force of the term originally? Is the exclusion of women an inci- dental effect- an application- of the concept, or does their exclusion reflect a prejudgment for which a justification was, and continues to be, sought? Reading the Tosefta Following the work of Lee Levine in his comprehensive study of the ancient synagogue, I wish to begin my historical interpretation by establishing that the prohibition of women's Torah reading is talmudic. In his chapter dedicated to the role of women in liturgical life, Levine maintains that no precedent for this prohibition can be drawn from pre-talmudic texts. His discussion deals with the contradictions found between the former and latter statements of the Tosefta in Megillah 3: II.14 Levine's argument is as follows: The Tosefta begins by taking the striking position that "everyone is included in the counting of seven [people to be called up to read from the Torah on the Sabbath], even a woman, even a child." In order to place this statement in context, Levine begins by pointing out the generally disparaging and uncom- plimentary terms used by Josephus, Philo, and others to describe women in antiquity. On the basis of this survey, Levine concludes: "It seems clear that in all the different classes and regions of Jewish society, women were generally considered inferior and as such were expected to remain outside of the public sector."15 In this context, the opening of the Tosefta seems to be an exceptional statement. However, the following lines of the text move straight on to rescind the permission granted to women- on two counts. First, the Tosefta says, 266</page><page sequence="7">Kevod Hatzibbur: Towards a Contextualist History "One does not bring a woman to read in public." Then it adds, "If a synagogue has only one man who is able to read, he stands, reads, and sits; stands, reads, and sits; stands, reads, and sits- even seven times."16 In his commentary on the Tosefta, Saul Lieberman had argued, on the basis of his reading of the second and third statements (and also of his understanding of mainstream medieval rabbinic interpretation), that the Tosefta's first state- ment was never intended to endorse the reading of the Torah by women: Their public appearance, in front of an audience of men, was prohibited. Insistence that the same man conduct the entire ceremony on his own if no other men are present explicitly excludes the possibility of turning to one or more women to help out.17 According to Levine, however, Lieberman's reading of the text leaves a number of important questions unanswered. Why did the Tosefta open this door to the inclusion of women in Torah reading if its intention was simply to close it? Why is it that the talmudic discussion of the Tosefta in BT Megillah 25% rejects the notion that women may read from the Torah on differ- ent grounds from the Tosefta's? Surely the second and third statements of the Tosefta should have sufficed? Levine concludes: "It would seem therefore that what we have are ... independent traditions that were arranged contiguously in the Tosefta but were originally separate and independent pericopae."18 According to Levine, it is possible (though historically unverifiable) that the first line of the Tosefta attests either to a historical practice or at least to a point of view that permitted women to read from the Torah. It is this posi- tion that is dealt with by the Talmud when it says: "But women may not read because of kevod hatzibbur.'" The second and third statements included in the Tosefta originally existed separately from the first, but were placed alongside it by later editors in order to reaffirm the talmudic prohibition. If so, we may conclude that the value of kevod hatzibbur is the legal foundation upon which the historical prohibition against women reading from the Torah is built. A Weak Claim? As I noted above, Shapiro and Sperber have suggested that kevod hatzibbur might be outweighed by other halakhic concerns. The idea that kevod hatzi- bbur is a weak basis for pesikah (a halakhic ruling) is found in an unusual responsum by Maimonides rejecting the Talmud's prohibition, on the grounds of kevod hatzibbur, against reading the Torah from a humash. Maimonides 267</page><page sequence="8">Alick Isaacs reasons: "They [the Rabbis of the Talmud] should have ruled against this by saying that the humash itself is a faulty [pasul] ritual object . . . and in this matter not so much as a twitter has been uttered."19 In other words, according to Maimonides, kevod hatzibbur is a weak objection used to forbid practices that might in principle be considered legitimate. He distinguishes between an object required for the performance of a commandment (such as a lulav20) and an object employed during the performance of a commandment (such as a text used in study). In the case of the Torah reading, the Torah scroll clearly, in his view, belongs to the second category. It makes no difference how and where the words are written down, so long as they are pronounced out loud for the community to hear and learn. Since, in his view, the Rabbis of the Talmud had raised only a second-order objection to the humash, Maimonides light-hand- edly disregards their concern for kevod hatzibbur and permits the practice of reading from an incomplete text, a bound book, or even from memory with no written text at all.21 Maimonides' interest in Torah reading is focused entirely on the Torah's verbal meaning. He attaches virtually no significance to the idea that the Torah scroll functions meaningfully as a sacred object in ritual practice.22 However, in the Talmud- and, as we shall see, among the Jews of medieval Germany (Ashkenaz)- the Torah scroll itself was considered meaningful, apart from the words it contained. Moreover, I agree with Shochetman, who argues that in the Talmud kevod hatzibbur is not an incidental, weak, or secondary con- sideration. Rather than accept Maimonides' dismissal, I think it is important, in order to offer an account of the tenacity with which the objection to women participating in Torah reading has been raised and sustained, to contend with the meaning of kevod hatzibbur where it is more clearly upheld. Anthropomorphosis of the Torah Scroll in the Talmud My reconstruction of the historical meanings of kevod hatzibbur in both tal- mudic and Ashkenazi sources begins with the notion that the socio-religious situation of the Torah reading ceremony and of the minyan (the quorum often adult men required to perform the ceremony) is that of a social body. Beyond the importance of body images in understanding this situation, both talmu- dic and Ashkenazi sources are replete with anthropomorphic metaphors that animate the sacred objects used in synagogue ritual. This anthropomorphosis 268</page><page sequence="9">Kevod Hatzibbur: Towards a Contextualist History extends the implications of gender in the Torah reading ritual. Fears of sexual impropriety might apply not only to the possible violation of the ritual setting by the inclusion of women, but also to the inappropriate handling of ritual artifacts whose public meanings are gendered as well. In his analysis of the symbolism associated with the Torah scroll, Harvey Goldberg comments: It does not require a stretch of the imagination to suggest that the sefer Torah may be viewed as analogous to a human being. One of the basic laws with regard to a sefer Torah directly suggests the parallel. A sefer, which is no longer fit for use (public reading) ... is put away in a manner parallel to the burial of humans. Thus it is not surprising to discover in other contexts the symbolic association between the sefer Torah and human beings in general, or specific kinds of human beings in particular.23 In the Talmud, responses to the anthropomorphic conception of the Torah scroll seem to divide into two categories. On the one hand, the Talmud is reti- cent about any suggestion that the Torah scroll somehow participates actively or magically in the ritual life of the community. On the other hand, when the Talmud wishes to protect the honor and dignity of the Torah scroll, it does so in anthropomorphic terms. Examples of both kinds of talmudic response are plentiful: Rabbi Yohanan says, whoever holds the Torah scroll naked will himself be buried naked. Naked is what you think this means? But he will be buried naked (i.e., stripped) of his good deeds. Naked of his good deeds is what you think this means? Rather, Abaye states that he is buried naked of that particular good deed. (BT Megillah 32a) Rabbi Yohanan 's initial remark establishes a direct correlation between the naked Torah scroll, held without its wrappings, and a human body buried without a shroud. The metaphor is animated by the suggestion that the Torah scroll itself exacts retribution upon the body of the person who mishandles it (midah keneged midah), indicating a belief in mystical or magical powers attaching to the scroll. This point of view is rejected. The Talmud interjects: "Naked is what you think this means? But he will be buried naked of his good deeds." The idea of direct retribution is ruled out, and nakedness is converted 269</page><page sequence="10">Alick Isaacs into a metaphor for a life without merit. In Abaye's final modification of the statement, even the notion of metaphorical retribution is eliminated, and only the specific commandment of handling the Torah scroll appropriately is (tautologically) lost by the act of mishandling. A similar response meets Rav Huna's extension of the anthropomorphosis of the Torah scroll to the suggestion that the Holy Ark might be used to com- plete a quorum of ten when only nine men are present in the synagogue (BT Berakhot 47b). Rav Nahman interjects ironically, "and an ark is a person?" By comparison, another expression of Rav Huna's tendency toward anthropo- morphosis of the Torah is received quite differently. According to Rav Huna, when a Torah scroll needs to be rolled in front of the community, it may not be replaced by another Torah scroll already rolled to the required position, "because of the diminished dignity of the first scroll" (BT Yoma 70a)- a phras- ing used elsewhere in the Talmud, in the name of Rabbi Yohanan, with refer- ence to priests. The Torah scroll may not be replaced, it would seem, because otherwise its feelings might be hurt. In this case, Rav Huna's view is accepted by the Talmud and is applied thereafter in halakhic literature. The attitudes to anthropomorphosis in these discussions seem to suggest a rule of thumb: anthropomorphosis of the Torah scroll enters into the talmudic halakhah only when it is applied as grounds for a stringent ruling that relates specifically to the protection of the Torah scroll from misuse. When body metaphors are applied to the Torah scroll for other reasons, they are ridiculed and rejected. Despite the clear limitations that the Talmud imposes upon the use of body metaphors for the Torah scroll, we are left in any case with the interesting conclusion that the halakhic obligation to protect the dignity of the scroll is often expressed in bodily terms. Kevod Hatzibbur in the Talmud With the exception of the priest who may not ascend the podium in sandals (he must be unshod), all the talmudic uses of kevod hatzibbur apply to acts that demean the Torah reading ceremony. Among these, two- reading from a humash and rolling the Torah scroll- refer directly to cases in which the scroll itself is demeaned by the violation, whose essence may well lie in the metaphorical relationship sensed between the dignity of the scroll and the dignity of the human body. It is for this reason that the concept of kevod 270</page><page sequence="11">Kevod Hatzibbur: Towards a Contextualist History hatzibbur applies not only to improprieties within the community, but also to mishandling of the scroll. The relationship, in talmudic culture, between violation of the Torah scroll and its anthropomorphosis presents what I have called an "interpretive gap." Since this notion of the scroll's dignity seems a historical oddity, perhaps it is beyond our capacity to empathize with it fully. In circumstances of this kind- and they are more frequent than traditionalists tend to acknowledge- historical thinking moves onto an openly interpretive or hermeneutical plane. The strangeness of this particular imagining (Torah scroll as body) suggests that our own experience of the scroll is not the best reference for reconstructing its meaning in the past. We are forced, then, to draw more broadly, creatively, and metaphorically upon our experience of the world in order to reconstruct the mentality, the thinking and intuitions, implicit in the talmudic text under consideration. It is this process of thinking metaphorically in order to con- textualize phenomena that can fill the interpretive gap. As has so often been demonstrated by the accusations of tendentiousness that no scholar, thinker, or historian can ever really avoid, the choices that we make in this process are indicative if not definitive of who we are and in what we believe. 24 It is at this stage in the investigation of kevod hatzibbur that the contem- porary commentator should find him/herself concerned- of necessity, not preference- with the dimension of gender. The metaphorical relationship between the human body and the sacred objects associated with the ritual of Torah reading invites consideration in terms of pre-modern notions about masculinity and femininity. One of the gender distinctions that require analysis in this context is the presumption that the male body is complete, while the female body is somehow lacking. Caroline Walker Bynum and Gerda Lerner (among others), have gathered abundant evidence that- in pre-modern con- texts- "the dichotomy male/female can serve as a symbol for the dichotomies strong/weak, rational/irrational, soul/body."25 While Bynum's arguments focus particularly upon medieval Christian sources, her phenomenology of gender distinctions is applicable to the interpretation of both talmudic and medieval Jewish sources. The distinctions to which Bynum points are explained by the perhaps deeper insight that the female body was understood, in ancient and medieval science, to be lacking in body parts. Bynum draws upon the work of Thomas Laqueur and Marie-Christine Pouchelle in proposing that: 271</page><page sequence="12">Alick Isaacs medieval natural philosophers argued that men and women are really a superior and inferior version of the same physiology. Women's reproduc- tive system was just man's turned inside out. . . . Medieval scientific ideas, especially in their Aristotelian version, made the male body paradigmatic. It was the form or pattern or definition of what we are as humans; what was particularly womanly was the unformedness or physicality of our humanness. Such a notion identified woman with breaches in boundaries, with lack of shape or definition, with openings and exudings and spill- ings forth. . . . Men and women had the same sex organs; men's were just better arranged. These assumptions made the boundary between the sexes extremely permeable.26 These dichotomies- "completeness/lacking"; "order/exudings"- are appli- cable to the anthropomorphosis of sacred objects. My suggestion is that the notions of dignity that define proper handling of the Torah scroll in the Talmud might be better understood if associated with masculinity, while mis- handling is associated with effeminacy. In this light, kevod hatzibbur might be presented as the principle by which the Talmud resists offenses against the metaphorical masculinity of the Torah scroll. The gendering of the term invites new explanations of the violations of kevod hatzibbur discussed in the Talmud, which may be considered to have originated in the "improper state" of people and ritual objects alike. Those violations, we recall, include reading from a humas h\ removing the cloth covering from the lectern; calling up a tattered child or a woman to read; and allowing a priest to ascend the podium in sandals. In the case of reading from a humash, the text being used is incomplete- it lacks four of the books that comprise a complete Torah scroll. It is this dimin- ished or "lacking" state that is associated with effeminacy in the Talmud. The central presence of an effeminate object or person at the Torah reading ceremony is considered a violation of kevod hatzibbur. The term connotes a correlation between masculinity and the dignity of the ritual. In the case of rolling the Torah scroll, the indignity caused to a scroll that is not ready for use is the source of an impossible dilemma. Bringing another scroll would be an insult to the first scroll, but rolling a scroll to the proper place exposes it to public shame. In this situation, the community is ill at ease with the scroll, and in its diminished or shameful state the scroll's presence constitutes an offense. As the scroll lays naked, open, its boundaries breached, lacking real shape and 272</page><page sequence="13">Kevod Hatzibbur: Towards a Contextualist History definition, it represents an effeminate presence that, like the humash, violates communal dignity during an important ritual. The same logic can be applied in explaining the Talmud's objection to removing the cloth covering from the lectern on which the Torah scroll rests. Rav Huna extended the anthropomorphosis of the Torah scroll to include the Holy Ark; a further extension of the body metaphor to the other objects with which the Torah comes into contact would account for the sense of indig- nity experienced when the lectern is laid bare. With its cover missing, the nakedness of the lectern shames the scroll, diminishes its dignity, exposes its deficiency, and subtracts from the ritual's completeness. In the next two cases- of a tattered child and of a woman- it is the "condi- tion" of the people involved, rather than that of the ritual objects, that accounts for the talmudic objection. Children and the poor, it would seem, belong to a group of people that the Talmud apprehends as metaphorically effeminate- as lacking or exposed.27 The grouping of children with women and slaves on the one hand, and with the physically and mentally impaired on the other, sug- gests that the symbolic status of children and women relative to male adults mirrors the status of the humash relative to the Torah scroll. Children, women, and the impoverished are incomplete men, just as a humash is an incomplete scroll. Moreover, the nakedness of a child (katan poheah) corresponds to the exposure of a Torah scroll, and both are analogous to the absence of the complete male community -the minyan- required for the ritual to proceed. In the absence of a minyan, one might say that the Torah cannot be read because there is no tzibbur (properly male social body) present. Similarly, one might say that in the absence of a complete set of ritual objects, or in the presence of incomplete persons, the Torah may not be read, because there is no complete (or completely) male community present. The one kevod hatzibbur prohibition that seems less describable in terms of gender construction, exposure, or incompleteness is that of a priest wear- ing sandals while blessing the congregation. The objection here is not to the priest's exposed feet, for tradition requires that he perform his blessing (in the synagogue as in the Temple) unshod. Unlike a child in tattered clothing, a priest without sandals is not exposing flesh that is normatively covered, and the priest's attire is thus not "incomplete." The talmudic objection is, rather, to the dirt on the priest's sandals. Uncleanness as a violation of kevod hatzibbur does not fit well with the other violations thus far described. Though this loose end cannot be tied up neatly, there are, I believe, three threads we might retrieve. 273</page><page sequence="14">Alick Isaacs First, the halakhic principle used by Rav Huna to ensure the protection of a Torah scroll from indignity when another scroll replaces it is invoked again in the case of the priestly prerogative to read first from the Torah. When there us no Lévite present to be called to read second, the same priest called to read the first portion is invited to read the second as well. Another priest is not called to replace him, for fear of "diminishing the dignity of the first." This concern does not seem to be personal (the first priest is not consulted in the matter). In the context of Rav Huna's statement, it appears that the situation is objectified as offensive and diminishing of status. Perhaps the common ground here- the use of the same terminology to protect the dignity of the priest and that of the Torah scroll- can draw the case of the priest's dirty sandals closer to the other cases cited. The dirt on his shoes may diminish the priest's dignity at a moment when he is fulfilling a commandment of the Torah applicable only to him and when the congregation is thus doing him special honor. Second, the priestly blessing is not part of the Torah reading ritual, and so the same categories may not apply. Third and finally, it is striking that medieval discussions of kevod hatzibbur make no reference at all to the case of the priest's sandals. Perhaps the anomaly was deemed insignificant, or else the mention of dirty sandals was deemed extrinsic to the talmudic discussion. A case has been made for a talmudic reading that seems to have powerful implications for our understanding of this concept in subsequent medieval sources- namely, that kevod hatzibbur has to do with the dignity of the com- munal prayer situation and of the ritual objects used therein, and the conceptu- alization ofthat dignity is associated with "completeness" and "masculinity." A scholar reconsidering the exclusion of women from Torah reading must take into account that the talmudic aversion to including women reflects a gendering of the ritual that is distinctive to a culture now well in the past. Sacred Bodies in the Middle Ages In the communities of medieval France and Germany, the anthropomorphosis evident in talmudic literature was continued. The symbolic representation of the human body in the Torah scroll is exemplified by a number of medieval sources and ritual practices.28 Similarly, the reverse idea- the metaphori- cal representation of children as Torah scrolls- reinforces the sense that the 274</page><page sequence="15">Kevod Hatzibbur: Towards a Contextualist History body and the scroll were connected in medieval Jewish culture. Ivan Marcus discusses this reverse correlation in his study of the initiation rite performed by medieval Jews to mark the beginning of a little boy's Torah education. The celebrant child was wrapped in a ritual shawl (tallii) and carried through the streets from his home to the synagogue by a Torah scholar. In this rite, as Marcus explains it, The child is likened to a Torah scroll. This is connoted not only by the requirement that the child be wrapped in a tallit but also by the stipulation that he be escorted from home to school by a Torah scholar or another respected adult who is knowledgeable in Torah. . . . The similarity between the child's being wrapped and carried from home to Synagogue in the ini- tiation ceremony and customs about carrying a Torah scroll from ark to ark is but one of several similarities in Jewish culture between the treatment of small children and of Torah scrolls.29 In medieval Europe, an additional dimension was added to the Torah/body metaphor, one that has significant implications for our understanding of kevod hatzibbur. "Tighter" structures of communal identity were associated with the belief that the Jewish social body was a sacred collective (kehilah kedoshah).30 Both the community members and the sacred objects they collectively pos- sessed were essential components of this sacred identity. I would like to sug- gest that, in medieval Europe, violations of kevod hatzibbur not only dimin- ished the dignity of the community but, more importantly, threatened the social body with the loss of its sanctity. As I have argued elsewhere,31 Rabbenu Tarn (leader of the twelfth-century French school of Talmudic commentators known as the Tosafists) contested the medieval practice of using the Torah scroll to complete the quorum of ten men needed for prayer on the grounds that the custom bordered on nonsense: There are those who complete the minyan with a child on the condition that he hold a humash in his hands, and Rabbenu Tarn said that this custom is nonsense, for the Talmud has already said about the Holy Ark- you wish to substitute an Ark for a man? In the same vein- you wish to substitute a humash for a man? Those who wish to say that a child might complete a minyan could say so even without a humash. Moreover, we have not seen 275</page><page sequence="16">Alick Isaacs in any place that this is permitted except when declaring a leap year . . . and even in this case R. Isaac ben Samuel says that Rabbenu Tarn did not himself follow this practice. (Tosafot to BT Berakhot 48a32) I would like to suggest that the point of contention between Rabbenu Tarn and practitioners of the custom he opposed was over how to categorize the sanctity of the Torah scroll. Is the scroll sacred because of the text it contains, or is the physical object- the Torah 's body, as it were- sacred in itself? The tension between these two positions is apparent in the response of R. Isaac ben Asher Halevi, a leading German Tosafist and a student of Rabbenu Tarn,33 to the talmudic description of Rabbi Yohanan's mystical anthropomorphosis of the vengeful Torah scroll. R. Isaac not only rejects Rabbi Yohanan's claim but also seems unsatisfied with Abaye's modification of it. To him, it makes no sense to say that someone who mishandles the Torah loses the commandment of handling it well. R. Isaac's objection is not simply to the tautology; there is no commandment involved in handling the Torah at all. Thus, he concludes: "Buried naked of that particular good deed" . . . that he was doing at the time he held the Torah scroll and read from it. ... He has no reward for that reading. Similarly, he has no reward if he mishandled it when rolling the scroll or making corrections to it. (Tosafot to Megillah 32a) In other words, according to R. Isaac, it is the reward for the commandment performed by way o/the Torah that is lost when the scroll is mishandled; the suggestion that there might be a reward for handling the scroll respectfully seems to him pointless. In his view, the scroll is sacred because it contains a sacred text to be read, studied, or corrected, not because it is a sacred object in its own right. This insistence that the scroll is essentially a text underlies Rabbenu Tarn's objection to its use for completion of a quorum. Moreover, it seems to me that in asserting this point of view, both R. Isaac and Rabbenu Tarn were objecting- consciously- to an entirely different per- ception of the scroll, one that I think dominated medieval German attitudes to kevod hatzibbur. Rabbenu Tarn apparently recoiled from the Christian affinities of the medieval European iconography of the Torah scroll.34 276</page><page sequence="17">Kevod Hatzibbur: Towards a Contextualist History The Scroll and the Host The tradition of seeing the Torah scroll as the source of sanctity in the syna- gogue can be traced back to the second century.35 However, in medieval Germany a new dimension was added when a connection was made between (1) the idea that the presence of the Torah consecrates space, and (2) the metaphorical association of the scroll with a body. I believe that in order to contextualize this connection properly, the iconography of the Torah scroll should be considered comparatively. In recent years, scholars such as Israel Yuval, Reuven Bonfil, and Ivan Marcus have demonstrated extensively the many ways in which medieval Judaism was related to the culture of Latin Christendom, despite the prejudice and hostility that dominated the relations between Christians and Jews. The present discussion requires attention to the similarities between the symbolic meanings of the Torah scroll and those of the relics and consecrated hosts kept in the reliquaries and altars of medieval churches. The consecrated host embodied the real presence, the flesh and blood, of Christ. As for the Torah scroll, Jewish sources are typically less explicit. Nonetheless, the Torah was clearly, if implicitly, perceived as a sacred body. A striking analogy used by Rabbi Judah the Pious is illustrative: It is forbidden to show the body of a Jew in a grave to a gentile. One gentile, a nobleman, asked the Jews to open the ark in which the Torah scrolls were kept. An old [wise] man told them, do not open it, for Hezekiah sinned when he showed the Ark of the Covenant to the noblemen sent by the king of Babylon, and whoever shows the Torah scrolls to gentiles deserves punishment in the world to come. (Sefer hasidim, § 763) The initial statement forbids showing the body of a dead Jew in a grave to a gentile. The precedents offered as verification of this claim draw on cases that Judah seems to think are plainly analogous. The body is compared both to Torah scrolls in the ark and to the tablets of stone in the biblical Ark of the Covenant. The three are tellingly run together as one. By combining these symbols, the connection between sacred space and body is made. In biblical literature, the Ark of the Covenant embodied the presence of God. It was kept in the inner sanctuary of the Temple and was credited with magical powers. The presence of God was believed to rest between the cherubim that adorned 277</page><page sequence="18">Alick Isaacs it. Thus, the ark is a superlative metaphor of divine presence, as is the Torah scroll. Next, in order for the lesson of the biblical story concerning King Heze- kiah to be applied to the case at hand, Judah draws upon the dual symbolism of the Torah scroll. The Torah functions as a metaphorical intermediary between the sacred tablets and the body, thus implying that it is both at once: The Torah scroll is a sacred body. Against the backdrop of medieval Christian culture, whose central icon was the consecrated host that embodied Christ, Judah 's comparison of the sacred Torah scroll with a body in a grave assumes a striking new meaning. The sug- gested correlation between the ark in the synagogue and a grave is strongly reminiscent of the connection drawn between sanctity and death in medieval Christian iconography. Church altars are often represented symbolically as graves, and reliquaries, used to hold relics of dead saints, are frequently coffin- like in appearance (the word "casket" can be applied to both).36 The anthropo- morphosis of the Torah scroll, considered in the context of the contemporane- ous church, suggests that Jews imagined the scroll as an embodiment of the divine. Like the host, the scroll represented God's presence in the sanctuary in a bodily form. Further similarities between the host and the scroll reinforce this connection. Both the host on the altar and the Torah scroll in the ark stood near the eastern wall of God's house, indicating the direction of prayer. In both cases, the sacred object was used to consecrate space. The rituals of church consecration and of hakhnasat sefer Torah (the rite that accompanies the bringing of a new Torah scroll to a synagogue) both involved a procession in which the host or the Torah, respectively, was carried under a canopy and ceremonially placed in the sanctuary, from which neither was ordinarily to be removed. Both the reading of the Torah and the performance of the mass were preceded by an act of elevation that was met with the adoration of the sacred object through gestures of kissing and bowing down.37 Kevod Hatzibbur in the Middle Ages The idea that the Torah symbolized divine presence in bodily form accounts, in my view, for the practice of replacing the missing man with the Torah scroll. In medieval thinking, the scroll replaces both the missing man and the divine presence that, according to the Talmud (BT Berakhot 6a), resides within an assembly often men. Rabbenu Tarn objected to the custom, because it seemed 278</page><page sequence="19">Kevod Hatzibbur: Towards a Contextualist History to sanctify the object rather than the text it contained- and also, it would seem, because he objected to imagining and treating the scroll as Christians imagined and treated the consecrated host. In the medieval world, Patrick Geary has shown, the possession of sacred objects played an important role in the community's ability to wield divine power when confronting danger.38 The Torah scroll as an embodiment of God's favor was thus a compelling idea- and despite Rabbenu Tarn's objection, the practices associated with that idea continued. The symbolic connections among the Torah scroll, the body, and the presence of God had a significant bearing upon the medieval understanding of kevod hatzibbur. Henceforth, the "complete" forms of ritual community associated in the Talmud with masculinity come also to be associated with the divine pres- ence. As Israel Ta-Shma has shown, the same Jewish communities that prac- ticed the custom of completing the minyan with the Torah scroll consistently objected to reading the Torah from a humash, on the grounds that this practice violated kevod hatzibbur.39 It is possible to connect the two ideas and suggest that the humash was unacceptable because the Torah scroll in this diminished or "effeminate" form was considered inadequate to the sanctity of the situa- tion. This interpretation would lead to the not very surprising conclusion that medieval Jews considered the "complete" and "masculine" character of the ritual as essential to its sanctity. Lacking this character- this sanctity- rites requiring a minyan may not be performed. In the medieval understanding, the violations of kevod hatzibbur listed in the Talmud are cases in which the divine presence evacuates the community because of the latter 's incomplete or diminished state. As in the Talmud, these violations are analogous to a minyan short on members. However, the analogy refers in this period not only to the indignity caused by incompleteness but also to the divine absence resulting from violations of kevod hatzibbur. In this context, the term should therefore be understood as denoting the presence or absence of kavod- meaning here, virtually, God- in the community.40 Medieval Ritual and the Language of Gender Broadly speaking, as we discuss the medieval context, gender categories delineate aspects of religious ritual. The boundary between "masculine" and "feminine" ritual settings is defined by the presence or absence of sexual 279</page><page sequence="20">Alick Isaacs segregation. A significant category of "feminine" ritual included anything involving food or drink. Such rituals were typically practiced in the sexually mixed environment of the home. Practices such as the recitation of kiddush (the benediction that consecrates the Sabbath day) over a cup of wine in the synagogue on Friday nights were thus problematic. On the one hand, the prac- tice of sanctifying the Sabbath day in the course of the synagogue service was masculine in character, and so the adult males present (who were expected to recite the kiddush for their families at home after the service) were not sup- posed to drink the wine. On the other hand, a rule of proper use demanded that someone must drink from the cup after the blessing over the wine had been uttered, and so in the Middle Ages the custom evolved of passing the cup of wine to children instead. This gendering of ritual seems to apply to the practices of the medieval church as well. In the church, men and women shared public space; the significant line of divide was between the clergy and the laity. Hence, com- munion (which involved food and drink) was delivered in the church by the male clergy to a mixed laity, but women were consistently excluded from entering the clergy.41 Thus, while the social construction of the church ritual was different from that of the synagogue, the generic perceptions of the rituals significantly overlapped. Rituals performed in the synagogue involving the presence of a minyan and associated with sanctity fall into the masculine category. Men performed these rituals alone, while women and children were assigned marginal roles as observers. The reading of the Torah clearly fell into this category. Active participation in the ritual was essentially a masculine empowering experi- ence, and so the greetings to those who approached the Torah used a language of strength and power.42 Participation by members of the effeminate social category was thus considered inappropriate. This category included children and anyone else lacking in status- all those referred to in medieval German Jewish texts as ketanim. The medieval German usage of the terms gedolim and ketanim (literally, "big people" and "little people") is generic, not biological. Ketanim seems to refer to males who were admitted to the public sphere of communal ritual but whose presence was essentially marginal. I would conjec- ture that even adult males such as lepers, vagrants, and the poor were at least partially held back from playing key roles in communal ritual, on account of kevod hatzibbur.43 Their presence detracted from the essentially masculine and sacred quality of the ritual setting. That quality was associated with power, 280</page><page sequence="21">Kevod Hatzibbur: Towards a Contextualist History most specifically the power to contribute to the embodiment of God's presence (and power) within the group. Returning to Contemporary Halakhah I began by questioning the simplicity with which a scholar today might assume that the exclusion of women in our time from the reading of the Torah loyally continues a stable and ancient tradition. I have suggested that this tradition might be reconstructed differently by using methods of contextualist historiog- raphy. What the historian finds is that, though exclusion of women from Torah reading is a consistent phenomenon, the apparently seamless consistency has been achieved through a dynamic process of reinterpretation. It is this process that has replenished the "appeal" of sexual discrimination in the practice of ritual. In different historical circumstances, the masculine construction of the ritual setting and the feminine construction of its violations have been injected repeatedly with vitality as the meanings of practices and concepts- "reading the Torah," "the Torah scroll," kevod hatzibbur, ketanim and gedolim-have evolved. In the Talmud passages, kevod hatzibbur defends a ritual situation from the violation of its masculinity. This applies variously to the masculinity of the social environment, from which women are excluded, and, by way of association, to the disqualification of incomplete ritual objects from use. In Medieval Europe, the term expands to defend not only the dignity of the ritual situation but also its "sanctity." On the one hand, the creativity with which this vitality has been preserved is a marvel. The ability to reinvent and reapply itself is an essential quality of the halakhic tradition. On the other hand, it seems equally the case that reinvention achieves vitality only when it is undertaken in the service of ideas, beliefs, and values that are truly compelling in their contemporaneous context. It remains for the contemporary scholar to consider how kevod hatzibbur and related concepts and practices are best preserved in our day. It is here that the rabbinic scholar or posek encounters not only his responsibility to the law but also his burden as an educator. It is here that he makes an interpretive decision that sets a standard for communities of Jews to learn what the heart and soul of their ritual practice is. The contemporary interpretation of kevod hatzibbur is an educational statement- a statement from which contemporary Jews are to learn what matters in and to Judaism. An interpretation of kevod 281</page><page sequence="22">Alick Isaacs hatzibbur in any temporal context must express what loyalty to the tradition means and what the fundamental values of the tradition are: what is central and what is extraneous. The method of historical contextualization stretches our understanding of concepts and social imaginaries that are out of reach, but the effect of the exercise is, paradoxically perhaps, that the concepts become more relevant, because more flexible, in our own context. I would urge the claim that a contextualist reading of kevod hatzibbur mandates, rather than prohibits, the participation of women in public reading of the Torah. If the historical reconstruction of communal dignity- and the dignity of ritual objects- that I have offered here is compelling, then halakhic discussion of women's participation in the reading of the Torah today must confront contemporary reticence about the association of "femininity" with "violation" in a ritual situation. My suggestion is that the exclusion of women from reading the Torah on these grounds constitutes an indignity that, perhaps ironically, demands correction as prescribed by the talmudic principle of kevod hatzibbur. Those who resist the reinterpretation of kevod hatzibbur must recognize that their readings and understandings perpetuate highly specific values found in particular historical contexts. In this case, these are the patriarchal communi- ties of the talmudic and medieval periods. Given that contemporary notions of women and gender are (or at least should be) different from those in the past, it seems appropriate to embrace the concept of kevod hatzibbur and continue the tradition of asserting meanings for it that reflect our own experiences of both community and dignity. The honor and wholeness of a congregation comprised of both men and women render mandatory the protection of the dignity of all its members.

By legal-positivist, I refer to the assumption that the meanings of halakhic or legal terms can be distilled in a pure form from "the sources themselves" and that an essential or single true meaning endures over time. In this sense, legal positivism is an essentialist approach. Tamar Ross has argued at length that the critique of legal positiv- ism is a vital component of a feminist reconstruction of the halakhah. See her book, Expanding the Palace of Torah:, Orthodoxy and Feminism (Waltham, MA: Brandeis University Press, 2004), pp. 71-99; and see her discussion of kevod hatzibbur, ibid., pp. 16-17 and 89, and especially her critique of Yehuda Henkin on the grounds that his analysis rests uncritically on legal-positivist assumptions, pp. 179-181 See also Yehuda Henkin, Equality Lost: Essays in Torah Commentary, Halakha and Jewish Thought (Jerusalem: Urim Publications, 1999). 13. The approach to contextualism advanced in this paper is a moderate one. Con- textualist opposition to universalist claims about culture can be taken too far. When overstated, the possibility of human beings understanding each other across cultural divides seems to dissolve. This position, sometimes termed "right-wing Kuhnianism" or "right-wing Wittgensteinianism," has alternatives that are perhaps less chaste philo- sophically but more ethically sound. The method of H.-G. Gadamer, notably, combines a contextualist recognition of the "otherness" of past cultures with strenuous efforts at comparison. Comparison of this hermeneutic kind draws relevant conclusions about the other while self-consciously admitting that those conclusions find their value close to home. As a method in the interpretation of law, contextualism was most famously 283</page><page sequence="24">Alick Isaacs developed by Clifford Geertz; in particular see his essay, "Local Knowledge: Fact and Law in Comparative Perspective," in Local Knowledge: Further Essays in Interpre- tive Anthropology (New York: Basic Books, 1983), pp. 167-234.

It is interesting that Maimonides' deflation of kevod hatzibbur is not applied to other cases, in particular the case of women reading from the Torah. Evidently, his sensitivity to the fear of sexual impropriety in the synagogue was so implicit to his thinking that the possibility was never raised. 22. Ta-Shma, in Early Franco-German Ritual (above, note 19), illustrates how unusual Maimonides' position actually is. In particular, Ta-Shma cites scholars who com- mented upon the apparent cancellation of the laws applying to the Torah scroll that is implied by Maimonides' position (p. 171).

See, e.g., the account of the elevation prayers in Eamon Duffy, The Stripping of the Altars: Traditional Religion in England, C.1400-C.1580 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992), p. 103: Holding up of the hands and the more or less audible recitation of elevation prayers at the sacring was a gesture expected of everyone. . . . And the refusal of such gestures might be held to exclude one from the human community, since they excluded one from the church. . . . Since the end of the twelfth century it had been customary for the consecrating priest to elevate the Host high above his head . . . seeing the Host became the high point of lay experience of the Mass. 38. Here I refer to Patrick Geary's study of the medieval practice of stealing sacred objects and relics with the purpose of gaining control of the saints they embodied. See Geary, Furta Sacra: Thefts of Relics in the Central Middle Ages (Princeton: Princeton University Press, reprint edition 1991). 39. Ta Shma's first study of the question pertains to the custom of reading the Torah portion from a humash; see idem, Early Franco-German Ritual (above, note 19), pp. 171-181. In a second study, he focused on the practice of completing the quorum with a Torah scroll: idem, Early Ashkenazic Prayer: Literary and Historical Aspects (Jerusalem: Magnes, 2003), pp. 237-249 (Hebrew). 40. In medieval Germany, kavod figured in discussions of specific aspects of the Godhead to which prayer was directed. On this meaning of kavod see Gershom Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York: Schocken, 1946), pp. 1 10-1 15. See also Joseph Dan, Torat hasod shel hasidut Ashkenaz (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1988), pp. 104-116. 41. On the exclusion of women from the clergy see for example Schussler Fiorenza, In Memory of Her (above, note 24), pp. 288-294. 287</page><page sequence="28">Alick Isaacs 42. 1 refer here to the greetings yishar koah (strength be upon you) and hazak (strength or power) extended to one who has been called up to read from the Torah. See Ta Shma, Early Franco-German Ritual (above, note 19), pp. 182-186. 43. See, e.g., Sefer hasidim (above, note 28), § 458: "Do not let a madman enter the synagogue, because he takes away [detracts from] the intentionality of prayer." For a full study of the role of marginal persons in Ashkenazi Jewish society see E. Shoham- Steiner, "Social Attitudes Towards Marginal Individuals in Medieval Jewish European Society" (Ph.D. dissertation, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2002; Hebrew); on the primary sources that testify to the exclusion of deviants from synagogue life, see pp. 162-170. 288</page></plain_text>
