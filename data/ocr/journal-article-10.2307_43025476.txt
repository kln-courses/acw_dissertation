New Departures in Con- trastive Linguistics/Neue Ansätze in der Kontrastiven Linguistik. Proceedings of the Conference Held at the Leopold-Franzens-Univer- sity of Innsbruck, Austria, 10-12 May 1991. 2 vols. (Innsbrucker Beiträge zur Kulturwissenschaft, Anglistische Reihe Band 4, Band 5). Innsbruck. ISBN 3-85124-159-2; 3-85124-160-6. Richard Matthews As the editors note in their preface, the conference of which these two volumes are the proceedings took place in the euphoric days following the raising of the Iron Curtain. It was conceived in such a way as to encourage pluralism in discipline and approach as well as a rapprochement between western and eastern European linguists. Heady, no doubt, with hopes of a new age dawning in European linguistics, too, the editors chose the title New Departures... (incidentally, only weakly rendered in German by 'Neue Ansätze' (cf. 'new approaches')), for a collection of disparate and uneven presentations. Noble though the editors' purpose may have been, its product is a reviewer's nightmare: not only because of the sheer number of papers included (53), but also because of the lack of thematic and disciplinary unity. A just and reliable evaluation for the wider linguistic community seems well-nigh impossible. But rather than shirk a reviewer's responsibility, I shall attempt at least to give a broad idea of the content and relevance of papers for those who have not had the volumes in their hands, and to give contributors an idea of how their work may be received. By way of conclusion, I shall indulge in some discussion of the status of contrastive linguistics. I shall divide this review into sections that match the sections of the proceedings. Because of the considerable variation in length and scale of the papers, which is partly attributable to the fact that some were originally plenary lectures while the rest were section papers, I will indicate 'plenary' where appropriate. It is unfortunate that the editors did not make such a division themselves, and also unfortunate, inciden-</page><page sequence="2">380 Buchbesprechungen tally, that they did not include a brief abstract of each paper. It should be noted that the volume of my comments on individual papers is in no way proportionate, directly or inversely, to their value. The section topics, some of them too broad, are: phonet- ics and phonology; morphology and syntax; word formation, lexicology and semantics (Vol. I); pragmatics and sociolinguistics; translation; language learning and language acquisition research (Vol II). Some of the papers contain a number of typographical errors: spelling, misplaced or unplaced commas, etc., but more importantly some redactional errors. I have noted after each article, where appropriate, only errors that are seriously misleading or confusing. I shall refrain from any comment on language errors, save this general observation: that a number of them should have been edited from this point of view as well! In my discussion I have changed the order of papers from the editors' alphabetical ordering within each section to one that is more the- matic. 1 .0 Vol. I begins with Phonetics/Phonology. With only three, thematically unre- lated papers, this is the most poorly represented section: Grassegger's concern is phonetics; Markus embraces prosody; and Hung enlightens us on tonology. The papers by Schütz and Wieden might have been included here rather than under Pragmatics and Sociolinguistics, and Language Learning respectively. 1.1 Grassegger ('On perception and production of English vowels by Austrian speakers', p.3-10) presents experimental evidence to demonstrate that non-native speakers of English have perceptual as well as articulatory difficulties in the target language (as every phonetics teacher knows from experience). Statistically, the experiment is a little weak, as there is an imbalance between the test group (10 German-speaking students of English) and the control group (4 English students). The core of the experiment takes five tokens of each of the items, of which only three synthesize native formant patterns of /e a e a/; /a/ gets called 'a velar vowel', inciden- tally. Any experimentation of this kind throws up a number of questions, apart from that of the point of the whole operation: how homogeneous were the two groups? were all the (Austro-)German speakers from one dialect area? of comparable ability in English? comparably exposed to native English? etc.). But beyond this, there is the fundamental problem that there is no objective measure of the imitative ability of the Austrian test subjects. Or is learning ability held to be a constant? [Caveat lector: p.4 'left' and 'right' relate to diagrams that appear top and bottom of the next page.] 1 .2 Markus ('Rhythm, stress and intonation in English and German seen contras- tively', p.13-36) presents mingographic evidence based on all of two conjoined clauses in formal newscasters' German and four phrases in much less formal, probably spontaneous, spoken English, uttered by one speaker each, plus a lot of half-digested secondary material (2-5 pages of bibliography to 12-5 pages of text) in order to prove 1) that English 'prose [sic] speech' is rhythmical, while German and French (the latter is mentioned for the first time in his conclusion) do not "really have</page><page sequence="3">Buchbesprechungen 38 1 rhythm"; 2) English stress is mainly a combination of intensity and duration, German stress a combination of pitch and duration; 3) destressing in English is a reduction of intensity and duration, in German a reduction of duration but mainly of pitch; 4) English pitch picks out theme-rheme structure and sentence mode -the falling curve of the intonation body signals position of both head and nucleus -, in German the pitch curve undulates corresponding to stress; 5) pitch starts higher in the tone group in English than in German; 6) "raising one's voice at the end of a tone group" typically marks continuation in German, but not in English. Though there may be an element of truth in some of these claims, the article is expositorily confused: inferences are made without the premisses being stated; sources are distorted; terminology is fluid, tautologous ('oral speech') or bizarre ('prose speech'). [Caveat lector: syllables are not unambiguously assigned to F0 and intensity values in Figure 4.] 1 .3 Hung ('Syntax-phonology interaction in Chinese and English', p.1 1-20) offers an insightful and interesting comparison of a part of the prosodies of certain Chinese dialects (= languages: Mandarin, Fuzhou, Shanghai) with English, taking Selkirk ('sense unit') and Hayes ('clitic group') inter alia as analytical bases. He demonstrates that Tone Sandhi in Chinese dialects may be organized differently (Sense unit or Clitic group), but that argument-head and modifier-head structures are also signifi- cant; to an extent order is relevant. Also that the tonal neutralization of certain content words (lexical heads) operates in a similar way to the non-assignment of nucleus to final content words in English. These he claims are syntactic factors, but in fact this is a loose use of 'syntactic': one is semantic, one semantico-syntactic and one pragmatic. 2.0 Morphology/Syntax. This section contains a number of theoretically significant works, as well as most of the plenary lectures in this volume. They interrelate quite well, even if they adopt different positions. 2.1 An overriding issue appears to be Hawkins' unity principle (which would be better termed 'unity hypothesis') that "where the grammars of English and German contrast, the surface forms of German are in closer correspondence with their associated meanings", which can be taken as a claim about the match between Chomsky's S-structure and L (ogical) F (orm). The central papers on this are those of Rohdenburg, who argues against, Kortmann &amp; Meyer, who adopt an ambivalent view, and Hawkins himself, who offers a revised typology. 2.1.1 Rohdenburg ('Bemerkungen zu infiniten Konstruktionen im Englischen und Deutschen', p.1 87-207) contrasts English and German non-finite embedded con- structions both synchronically and diachronically in the light of Hawkins's claim for the greater explicitness of German. He demonstrates that in terms of Subject, Object and Empty Object Control English has to all intents and purposes lost the last mentioned, has increasingly conventionalized Gerund forms for retrospective and negated matrix</page><page sequence="4">382 Buchbesprechungen verbs with Subject Control at the expense of the infinitive, and has extended from + Gerund constructions with Object Control with non-prospective verbs with negative orientation, also at the expense of the Infinitive. In general, English tends to adhere, as far as Control is concerned, to Rosenbaum's 'Minimal Distance Principle', to have reduced ambiguous Control, and, above all, to have become more explicit. This Rohdenburg sees as confirmation of a view of drift in English that contrasts starkly with that of Hawkins: English has moved towards a closer match between form and content. Although his interpretation of the data and his argumentation are convincing, one has certain reservations about some of his constructed examples, e.g. bother does not fit into the paradigmatic frame: (p. 199), and also about the representative- ness of some of his historical data, because text examples are so few and, to a large extent, random. His statistical evaluation is ill-founded: there is little significance in comparing percentage occurrence based on fewer than 10 cases; sometimes he only has one! If a diachronic statistical comparison is to be made, a comparable number of cases has to be taken for each period. 2.1 .2 Kortmann &amp; Meyer ('Is English grammar more explicit than German grammar, after all?', p.155-166) discuss the case for and against Hawkins's unity principle. They consider the contrary view of Rohdenburg, who argues that English far more than German allows or requires (lexico-syntactic) means of expressing what might otherwise be expressed morphologically, thus involving greater semantic specificity, i.e. explicitness. Kortmann &amp; Meyer argue on the basis of the lexicality-grammaticity scale and the nature of prepositions that English has a greater degree of lexicalization; and on the basis of a heaviness scale and the types of pre- and post- modification in English and German NPs that English has a preference for more explicit 'verbal cores', while German favours less explicit 'nominalization', preferences noted, incidentally, by practising philologists, translators and language pedagogues for generations! Both Hawkins's and Rohdenburg's hypotheses are thus upholdable, depending on which phenomena one examines. By way of conclusion, they also discuss Hawkins's adaptation of Sapir's 'drift hypothesis' and decide that it is a useful addition, which can also explain some of Rohdenburg's and their own observations, though it may be of less use in explaining 'the strengthening of non-finite forms' in English or the English tendency towards multiple predication. In general, this is somewhat opaquely and clumsily argued: a lumpy package. 2.1.3 Hawkins ('A performance approach to English/German contrasts', p. 115-136 - plenary), in fact, develops a rather different typology from the one referred to in connection with the unity principle. Taking a number of parameters in English and German (Subject-to-Subject Raising; Tough Movement; Subject-to-Object Raising; ^movement; semantic diversity of grammatical relations; sub-categorizaion possi- bilities, cf. Hawkins 1986) as well as structural ambiguities as a basis, the author attempts to establish from a parsing point-of-view (i.e. processing) why such differ- ences hold. He argues that the different parsing/processing required by SVO and SO V languages determines their morpho-syntactic nature; in SVO English, the criterial predicate frame potential is determined early in the parsing process, so the</page><page sequence="5">Buchbesprechungen 383 exclusion of various possible interpretations of the inflectionally unmarked remaining elements can be processed in due course; in SOV German, the criterial predicate frame potential can only be resolved late in the parsing process, so it is necessary, from a 'performance' point of view, to have inflectionally marked elements. His (new) hypothesis is (p.1 31 ) a. if SOV, then case system; b. if case system, then narrow (semantically transparent) associated semantic roles; c. if SOV, then semantically transparent cases and basic GRs [= grammatical relations]; d. if SO V, then no (or limited) raising; e. if SOV, then no (or limited) ^-extraction. This hypothesis is broadly corroborated from a PhD-student's data, covering Korean, Japanese, Mala- yalam, Turkish, German, Russian, Chinese, Sawu, Hebrew, Indonesian, Jacaltec and English. In other words, most of the structural differences between English and German follow from the fundamental SVO vs. SOV distinction. (German, of course, does have SVO, but this is restricted.) [Caveat lector: 'node' for 'note', p.131] 2.2 A dependent major issue is the appropriacy of the GB model for contrastive linguistics. Here we have a (negative) theoretical statement from Boas, and applica- tions from Abraham and Beukema &amp; Tomic. 2.2.1 Boas ('Contrasting construction types or fixed parameters?', p.83-104 - plenary) is a closely and persuasively argued examination of whether Chomsky's 'Government-and-Binding' model with its modularity of subcomponents and principles and the parametrization of 'Universal Grammar' (the innate language faculty of humankind) can, as Hawkins 1986 optimistically predicts, achieve 'greater explana- tory and descriptive adequacy' than Chomsky's 1965 Standard Theory and can lead to the discovery of significant generalizations about English and German which went unstated in the Standard Theory'. The conclusion, based in part on Boas' own work on the passive in English and German, is that the modularity and parametrization of GB makes it impossible to capture 'systematically significant equivalences, similari- ties and differences on the levels of morpho-syntactic surface- and deep-structure of semantic construction types across languages ... GB-based work has become almost irrelevant to contrastive studies'. [Caveat lector: Ex. 29 has no empty category 'e', cf. text, though Ex. 30 does.] 2.2.2 Abraham ('Contrastive linguistics vs. linguistic typology: Middles and syntactic ergatives in sundry European languages', p.39-63 - plenary) presents a demanding and challenging argument on the need to use sophisticated theoretical insights in order to make generalizations about the nature of typological contrasts in an area as complex as that of diathesis ('voice'). The phenomena: middle and 'ergative' (in Burzio's use of the term, not Halliday's, nor Dixon's) and their relationship to transitiv- ity and voice, primarily in English, Dutch and German, but with a fair amount of coverage of French and Spanish, and some mention of Italian, Frisian, Icelandic and Danish. The theory (theories) used: Government-and-Binding, Theta-role theory. Many of the claims made are persuasive, though clearly there is a need for corrobo- ration from other languages - to an extent even from the languages discussed. In particular, the differentiation of event and property middles seems to be important, as</page><page sequence="6">384 Buchbesprechungen is the suggestion that these types are intimately linked to the presence or absence of a distinction between eventive and statai passives. There is also some examination of the interaction of diathesis types with aktionsart and aspect. Even if one does not adhere to the GB model Abraham uses, much of the discussion and many of the conclusions transcend models. Some of the translations and glosses of examples are rather strange, however, and some of the claims are vitiated by the equivocality of examples, e.g. it is claimed that an adverbial is obligatory in English middles, but cf. This floor waxes, that one doesn't. 2.2.3 Beukema &amp; Tomió ('Government-Binding Theory and Contrastive Linguistics: Clitics in Romance, Germanic and Slavonic', p.65-81) is an attempt to use the split- INFL GB-model, cf. Pollack 1989, and Belletti 1988 to contrast French, Dutch, Bulgarian, Czech, Polish, Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian clitics, mainly pronominal ones. Though relatively clearly presented, the argumentation is not as transparent as it might be. I fail to understand: "In negative-interrogative sentences, in its turn [sic], the whole cluster can be right-adjoined to the li clitic in C and we get: (42) Ne mi go dava li pismoto.n Since CP is the left-most (and highest) node and since they argue that li must originate there, I presume 'right' should be read as 'left' or else they have failed to note //-movement in this example. They duck the question of how clitic pronouns differ from non-clitic pronouns, or else assume that pronouns are sui generis a sub-class of clitics. Their conclusions on the similarities and differences particularly among the Slavonic languages are too long to quote, but they depend crucially on the GB-model and the principle of movement to explain word-ordering phenomena given a UG clause template, and therefore do not necessarily translate into any other model. Their more general conclusion that the assignment of closely related languages to particular typological parameters may be only relative is hardly sensational. [Caveat lector: there is a branch missing on the S-structure tree on p. 43] 2.3 A pedagogical insight into contrastive linguistics is attempted by Nehls ('Con- trastive lexico-grammar', p. 177-1 85), in whose view there are three groups of con- trastive linguists: universalists, who look for similarities in languages: those like himself who look for differences between them; and typologists, who look for both similarities and differences. The paper is overall a clearly presented if somewhat slight piece on some lexico-grammatical contrasts between English and German: in aspectual distinctions, use of discourse particles and modal verbs. The data has been knocking around for a long time and is fairly standard in pedagogical grammars and handbooks on translation. With a conclusion like: 'The lexico-grammatical differences between German and English which I have discussed ... have to be laboriously acquired by the foreign language learner in the classroom in spite of the existence of universal principles common to both languages", it does little, I fear, to dent the universalist position. 2.4 Papers that approach contrastive linguistics primarily from a typological point of view are those of König, Mair, Brdar &amp; Brdar Szabó, which all seem to presuppose a</page><page sequence="7">Buchbesprechungen 385 TG approach with movement transformations, and Stícha, which is oriented more towards translation equivalence. 2.4.1 König ('Contrastive linguistics and language typology', p.137-154- plenary) The first half discusses the relationship between contrastive linguistics and typology, and sets this off against (contrastive) language pedagogy. It also discusses some of the major achievements of selected individual studies from a typological viewpoint, including Hawkins. The second part consists of an examination of 'semantic scope', which he distinguishes from both 'syntactic scope' and 'valency', and ambiguity arising from 'wide' vs. 'narrow' semantic scope. This is the kind of relation discussed in Jackendoff 1972 (Semantic Interpretation in Generative Grammar), which can be sensitive to word order, intonation and certain lexical choices such as some vs. any. In GB, it is handled under that controversial module L (ogical) F (orm). König demon- strates that there are differences between English and German in this, and presents arguments from his own work on the changes in scope that have accompanied meaning changes (reanalysis) with items like yef and AmE anymore. The elucidation of such phenomena, both synchronic and diachronic, underpins König's claim about the "symbiosis between contrastive linguistics and typology". It has to be noted, however, that one or two English examples are infelicitous: in quoting Taglicht's 1994 example as: 'I did not lock the door/ deliberately', which doesn't work, instead of 'I didn't lock the door/ deliberately', which does; and in giving 'entlassen' as a gloss for: I hope they won't lay off Paul too/either [sc. preferred reading: 'stop molesting'] instead of I hope they won't lay Paul off too/either [sc. preferred reading: 'release from employment']. The significance of König's claim that the scope of not in the English can't seem to construction (first noted in generativist literature, incidentally, in Langendoen 1970) has no correlate in German is vitiated by the fact that both English and German have 'Neg-raising' constructions: I don't think he's coming ; ich glaube nicht , daß er kommt, German sometimes with no lexical correlate in English: Ich hoffe nicht, daß er kommt £1 don't hope he's coming (cf. I hope he's not coming). 2.4.2 Mair ('"Raising" in English and German: Formal explanation, functional explana- tion or no explanation at all?', p. 167-1 76) gives us a mercifully concise and well- presented, if perhaps (cf. Kortmann &amp; Meyer) slightly under-argued, case against existing typological classifications based on systems of clause combination for English vs. German raising patterns, while recognizing, in principle, the importance of typological studies of a large number of languages, taking account of lexico- semantic classes, in making hypotheses that can "serve as correctives on hasty generalizations based on language pairs". Central to Mair's case is a comparison of the patterning in Latin (with most 'raising'), English, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Russian (with least 'raising'). This suggests that the behaviour of individual languages with respect to raising cannot be easily reduced to a single universal implicational chain. 2.4.3 Brdar and Brdar Szabó ('How tough is tough-movement to typologize?', p.1 05 - 1 1 4) looks at 'Tough Movement'-like phenomena in English, German and</page><page sequence="8">386 Buchbesprechungen Croatian. They refute the arguments of Comrie and (S.) Matthews 1990 that English and German differ structurally in such phenomena because English has be + Adjec- tive + Infinitive, while German has sein + Adverb [sic] + Infinitive -which is supposed to explain why semantically similar lexical items in English and German pattern differently -and conclude that in German there is a cline from adverbial to adjectival, [nb. some of the German examples wouldn't work in English.] On Croatian, they claim that close equivalents to Tough Movement (TM) structures are often castigated as sub-standard or the result of German caiques. They argue that relatively free word- order and an intact case system in Croatian inhibit the development and exploitation of such structures; conversely, that English with its 'rudimentary' case system favours the development of TM. Modality may be a factor. The easy/difficult-c'ass seem to be the semantic prototype, they say, because they are indeterminate between reference to the whole situation and matrix subject NP. They thus support Mair's corpus-based findings that these are the core cases; others are analogous thereto or metaphorical extensions therefrom. 2.4.4 Štícha ('Die lexikalische Übersetzbarkeit des Objektkomplements im englischen, französischen, deutschen und tschechischen Satz', p.225-232) com- pares empty object slots in English, French, German and Czech, which can be divided into cases of implicit anaphors, where the missing object is given in the immediate linguistic context, and non-anaphoric empty objects, which divide into 1) those with implicit reference to a general object 2) those with implicit reference to a specific, situational^ determined object (or set of objects), and 3) those with conven- tionalized implicit reference to a specific object which need not be situational^ inferrable: e.g. hang up [sc. the receiver]. Štícha notes here a number of cases where the languages in question differ: e.g. English: Open the door! German: Aufmachen! There are also cases of polysemy. In dealing with implicit anaphors, he comes to the conclusion that Czech and German resist such ellipses, while English tolerates them and French allows them quite freely. Apart from the further claim that while both English and French have frequent implicit anaphors relating to a situation (German has es), French frequently has implicit anaphors to objects, and a note that semanti- cally related verbs may behave differently: il faut distinguer vs. *il faut discerner, there is no further theoretical discussion nor more detailed analysis. He seems more by implication than argument to arrive at the conclusion that such patterns are after all conventional rather than structural, and pleas for better coverage in dictionaries. Many of the examples are literary in style; not all the English ones are felicitous. 2.5 The remaining papers in this section, Schaller Schwaner and Davidsen-Nielsen, are concerned with tense systems and should probably have been included under section 3 on semantics. 2.5.1 Schaller Schwaner ('Future time expressions in English and German: A contrastive notional perspective', p.209-223). In this, notions are taken to be 'fuzzy sets' after the manner of Coates' 1983 corpus-based treatment of English modal auxiliaries - indeed Coates' influence is noticeable throughout the paper. From a</page><page sequence="9">Buchbesprechungen 387 number of notional treatments of 4 English futurate expressions, she extrapolates 7 concepts: will=Prediction, will=Resolve, will=Willingness, going to=lnterpreting Signs, going to=lntention, Present progressive=Arrangement, Present simple=Fact, some of which have fairly clear special uses, e.g. Willingness has a special use: Insistence. A comparable operation on German expressions is less straightforward because, she claims, fewer approaches to the subject matter are notional. Nevertheless, she discusses in some detail about 15 sources for notional claims about German, and arrives at a set of 5 concepts for the two forms selected: Präsens=Anticipation, Präsens=Premeditation, Werden=Conjecture, Werden=Prediction, Werden=Announcement of Intention. She admits that her presentation ignores certain central lexical means of indicating futurity, that it needs to take account of the markedness of expressions, and that it does not establish points of similarity and difference between the respective notions or 'conceptual networks' of English and German. Fuzzy set theory is controversial; it may be no more than a notational variant of prototype theory. And certainly it is not a necessary consequence of a notional approach to grammar. The notions she appeals to are no more than abstrac- tions from sets of pertinent situational (including contextual) conditions, with only sketchy characterization of other predication relevant properties like agency, situation-type, etc. She makes no attempt to establish their contrastivity, and little attempt to relate them to utterance-meaning or the pragmatics of the ideational component of the predications involved. Her conclusion: "This[that the notional make- up of English is different from that of German] probably means that speakers of both languages have to develop new 'conceptual networks' when learning the [sc. other] language. A notional contrastive grammar may be one important key to promoting this process effectively." This is somewhat naive. Notions that are not rigorously defined do not "translate" into another language unambiguously enough to counteract native language interference in foreign language performance. Such notions are just monolingual labels; what a learner needs to acquire is an abstraction from essential situational conditions for the appropriate use of a form comparable to that of a native speaker; a label can at best be a useful mnemonic. 2.5.2 Davidsen-Nielsen ('Remarks on tense in English and Danish', p.233-244) discusses first a general analysis of tense and then the use of tense in English and Danish. In essence this is a potted version of his book on tense and mood in English 1990. He first argues in favour of including non-volitional wilh-V as future tense and also perfect forms as tenses, which means he can establish exactly the same eight tenses for English and Danish: present, present perfect, past, past perfect, future, future perfect, future past, future past perfect, which "express external event time". These are then characterized in a modified Reichenbachian system - the modifica- tion is to add another type of reference time (B = basis time) to handle future past and future past perfect -and also in a feature system: ±then (±remote would have been better), ±posterior, ±previous (±anterior would have been better -and he in fact uses anterior later). Under certain conditions, such as non-finite constructions in English, these can be neutralized: ±then and ±posterior in English; ±then in</page><page sequence="10">388 Buchbesprechungen Danish. It seems to be treating the notion of 'neutralization' a little cavalierly to say that in narrative fiction ±Then is also neutralized, unless one differentiates between syntactic and pragmatic neutralization. The 'historic present' is a present used for events that are not necessarily linked to speech time. In comparing tense uses, Davidsen-Nielsen determines that there are primary and secondary uses: to refer to the future, English primarily uses the future, secondarily the present; Danish uses both future and present primarily. It is not clear what the necessary conditions for this division are. In addition to some fairly well-known facts about English, there are some interesting contrasts that are brought to light. The two main areas of contrast are: in the use of present perfect and past (here Davidsen-Nielsen fails to discuss the distinction between definite and indefinite temporal reference), and the 'future' vs. 'present' in main clauses and future past vs. past in irrealis clauses. Apart from certain reservations about Davidsen-Nielsen's classification and use of terminology, I fear he has been sometimes a little lax with the interpretation of his examples and rather parsimonious in his consultation of the available literature on tense. His apparent surprise, revealed in a footnote, that some English //-clauses can have will+M illustrates both points: his overheard example: Let's go to the third floor ; if it ' [the lift] will take us there is a) not strictly a conditional structure (as he terms it) to which this 'rule' applies; b) arguably volitional will used of a force (lift); c) matched by other examples in a taxonomy in Davies 1979:147-152 (The Semantics of Syntax. London: Croom Helm). 3.0 Word-formation, Lexicology, Semantics. This section is an unbalanced mixture of serious lexicology and lexicography: papers by Brdar Szabó &amp; Brdar, Ďurčo, Rathay and Weisemann, and a more theoretical paper by Hartmann; insightful semantics: Tobin; and the deviant didactics of 'false friends': Barnickel, Fanning, Gläser and Siegrist. 3.1 Lexicology and lexicography 3.1.1 Brdar Szabó &amp; Brdar ('Einige Besonderheiten in der Distribution von nomina agentis und nomina patientis in interlingualer Relation', p.251-259) is to be under- stood as an integrative approach to word-formation that combines the fact-oriented description of traditional studies with the hypothesis-oriented predictivism of genera- tive studies. Their material is taken from English, German, Russian, Croatian and Hungarian. Their hypotheses include: 1) a possible division of languages into those that favour compounding and those that favour suffixation; 2) a possible interaction between syntax and word-formation patterns; 3) a preference for suffixation in languages with more flexible word-order. The suffixation patterns for nomina agentis and nomina patientis in English, particularly -er and -ee, do seem to have a syntactic explanation: -er for nomina agentis of transitives and agentive intransitives, -eefor nomina agentis of unaccusative intransitives and nomina patientis of transitives.</page><page sequence="11">Buchbesprechungen 389 Others like -nik in Croatian do not seem to be syntactically motivated, though there are no ambiguous nomen agentis-nomen patientis pairs with -nik. Where suffixation fails, composition can always be fallen back on. Suffixation for nomina agentis is not only much more frequent than for nomina patientis, there is also a marked preference for it in Russian, Croatian and Hungarian (with freer word-order) compared with English and German (with more fixed word-order). They argue ultimately that al- though derivational patterns may be influenced by syntax, they are primarily deter- mined pragmatico-semantically. 3.1 .2 ĎurCo ('Ein Matrixmodell für ein- und zweisprachige phraseologische Wörterbücher', p.261-269) presents a 'matrix model' for mono- and bilingual phraseological dictionaries, the aim being to capture all the information relevant to the form, meaning and use of an idiom or bilingual pair of idioms. This information is classified as being structural, semantic or pragmatic, and then as microstructural (to do with the structure itself) or macrostructural (to do with the place of the expression with respect to the phraseological and general lexical system), both of which are further divided into 'inner design' and 'outer design', which appear to correspond roughly to paradigmatic and syntagmatic. This gives a3*4 matrix, i.e. with 12 slots: A - L, which are illustrated individually. The paper concludes with a monolingual demonstration article for etwas auf dem Kerbholz haben. It would have been interest- ing to have seen a bilingual example worked through, because equivalents are usually only partial: to have blotted one's copy book (one possible translation) is derived from a base form: (to) blot one's copybook. So, though this may be monolingually exhaustive, it is hard to see exactly how it works bilingually, and harder still to see whether it could be integrated into computer applications. The presenta- tion, however, is not as explicit as one could wish: a number of notations and abbrevi- ations in the diagrams of constituents A - L are left unexplained, and there is a certain amount of inconsistency, too: under E, for example, the intention is to show that gang und gäbe cannot be combined with wie to function as an adverbial, but the asterisk is wrongly placed, thus excluding the acceptable: er verspätete sich wie üblich. The stylistic value of etwas auf dem Kerbholz haben is given as 'umg' = umgangssprachlich; its frequency as 'kolloquiať. This seems to be more a pilot model than a fully-fledged production model. [Röhrich 1977 and Wahrig 1968 are missing from the list of references] 3.1.3 Hartmann ('Contrastive Linguistics: (How) is it relevant to bilingual lexicogra- phy?', p.293- 299) attempts a state-of-the-art assessment of how contrastive linguis- tics (CL) and bilingual lexicography (BL) interact. Limiting his comments to the lexicological, he observes that if anything bilingual lexicography, as the older disci- pline, has given more to contrastive linguistics than vice versa. He then notes how bilingual dictionaries handle cultural specifica. In principle there are four scales of interest: a) cultural diversity on a scale from general to particular; b) degree of equivalence from full to nil; c) translation method: transfer* substitution, modulation, circumlocution; d) devices used to deal with prqblematic equivalence: direct match, cross reference, label, explanatory gloss. Comparison of two bilingual with selected</page><page sequence="12">390 Buchbesprechungen differentiated monolingual dictionaries shows that the bilingual dictionaries do surpris- ingly well, and that specialized territorial dictionaries are no better than general all- purpose dictionaries. Hartmann establishes that such comparisons hide the nature of the translation process in establishing interlingual lexical equivalents: monolingual lexicographers abstract from contextual uses; bilingual lexicographers use these abstractions for their equivalences; translators accordingly find that substitution does not work. His suggestion is, citing Laffling 1991 , that parallel text analysis or contras- tive textology might be the 'missing link' between CL and BL. He believes "there is ... a chance that a new generation of computer-assisted parallel text analysis can bring us a step nearer the old dream of 'text-insertable translation equivalents'." Your reviewer demurs: 'contrastive textology' may improve knowledge of cultural equiva- lence where it exists; it will barely help where it does not, e.g. Ersatzdienst. Even if we could work out subtle reformulation, paraphrases or fairly obvious glossing, it is not clear how this could be made 'text-insertable' in any appropriate fashion. 3.1.4 Rathay ('German equivalents of English zero-derived denominal verbs', p.301-310) suggests first that there are generally six semantic types involved in denominal verbs: ornative, privative, instrumental, resultative, locative, and agentive. He examines German denominal verbs in -en, -ier-en, - ig-en , -el-n' -en corresponds to all semantic types, but most frequently with ornative and instrumental; -ier-en seems not to correspond to locative, agentive, privative, but to favour ornative. Prefixed denominal verbs, i.e. with ab -, an-, be-, ein-, ent-, ver-, zu-, etc. correspond closely with specific semantic types. Many German equivalents are prefixed or unprefixed verbs with a non-nominal base, which cannot be so easily classified; and many are phrasal, e.g. mit Schilf decken = thatch. These, too, can be related to semantic types. He allows that there are also some minor derivational classes as well. The study is completed by a look at some of the semantic and pragmatic factors involved in selecting equivalents; the polysemy or monosemy of the underlying noun; the polysemy, monosemy or homonymy of derived verbs; and more briefly, generality vs. specificness, figurative extension, and collocation with adverbial particles. In view of the fact that one of his stated aims was to discuss: "some factors influencing the choice of German equivalents, essentially when they occur in a specific linguistic context", this is a little disappointing. By restricting linguistic context to lexical colloca- tion, a great mass of the problem of translation is left under the surface. A case in point from his examples: (to) teargas can only be equated with Tränengas einsetzen when the latter is active and transitive: sie setzten Tränengas gegen die Demonstranten ein , but not when it is passive as in: the demonstrators got tear- gassed/ were teargassed out of the building. Exclusion of such syntactic properties means that we will indeed have 'lo look for equivalents that are not in the dictionary, but might be the only or at least the most appropriate form in a given context"! 3.1 .5 Weisemann ('To wheel-clamp the economy - on the description of metaphori- cal verbs in English', p.343-350). This is an examination of various types of meta- phorical uses of verbs. He notes that as far as word-formation is concerned, the whole spectrum of patterns is represented. After a brief discussion of the phylogeny</page><page sequence="13">Buchbesprechungen 391 of such phenomena, noting Lehrer's 1974 claim that once a figurative extension takes place, other synonymous and antonymous items will become available for similar extension, preserving, of course, their basic semantic relation, he suggests first the possibility of classifying them according to metaphorical type (semantic process), e.g. physical verb to abstract verb, denominal verb (from concrete inanimate or animate non-human noun) as metaphorical verb. Without pursuing this further, he notes that broad meaning classes are another possibility: 'ruin/hinder/check'; 'criticize/attack'; 'increase/spread rapidly'. It is unfortunate that neither of these possibilities is explored in full. Both could be of interest to those concerned with semantic universais: it has long been held that metaphorical transfer can be reduced to a few metatypes, e.g. concretive, animistic, anthropomorphic, synaesthetic; it has also been held that certain meanings are reducible to a few metatypes like: state, change of state, action, etc. 3.2 Semantics is represented by just one paper: 3.2.1 Tobin ('Contrastive linguistics: A sign-oriented point of view', p.31 1-335 - plenary). This is a thought-provoking paper conducted, as the title implies, from a semiotic point of view, which stands opposed to the generative-universalist point of view. Unfortunately, it does not actually look at a language pair, only English! Tobin first elucidates his concept of 'semantic integrality' ("the perception of an entity or entities within a single, unified, continuous space", and applies it to the problem of analyzing just and only , which traditional grammar has failed to solve. Explanations in terms of syntactic distribution, different historical origin, different style, different medium, and synonymy all ultimately prove wanting. Tobin's view is that just and only have a minimally different invariant meaning: both are limiters; just ìs marked, on/y is unmarked; semantic integrality permits two fundamental ways of perceiving entitites: just relates to continuous space only, only is neutral with respect to continuous or discontinuous space. This analysis is then exemplified on data from four American novels: with minimal pairs phrases ('microlevel'), multiple occurrence of one or the other, juxtaposition of the two, minimal pairs at text level ('macrolevel'), text level multiple occurrences. His conclusion is: "Invariant Meaning Motivates Distribution!" and his moral: "Only when we know what the linguistic signs in specific languages really mean can we even begin to compare sign systems across languages in a responsible and scientific way." This would incidentally disqualify a number of other papers in the proceedings. Sympathetic though one may be with Tobin's view and even his analysis, it is difficult to go along with a lot of his exemplification - he admits in his introduction to being "extreme" in the view of others'. He makes a monosemantic hypothesis based on a fairly precise cognitive classification, but does not appear to allow for a meaning difference between adjectival just arid subjunct just (p. 322) based on word-class meaning. Nor does he explore the combinative seman- tics of colligating subjunct just and only with different word-classes, e.g. is the limiting effect influenced by the gradability vs. non-gradability of an adjective, the stativity vs. the dynamicity of a verb, the concreteness vs. abstractness of a noun, etc.? Such are</page><page sequence="14">392 Buchbesprechungen the kinds of question a responsible descriptivist should pose. Moreover, when he examines the use of just and only at what he calls the macrolevel, and makes claims like: "The constant use of the unmarked form [only] - noting a non-integral view - may also be exploited to show a 'disunity' in text or discourse as well and their collocation within the same text or context may further emphasize the difference between them based on their markedness relationship..." and "In example (39) we have the multiple use of only which is used consistently as a means to contrast two people" he has left the realms of linguistics and entered those of literary appreciation. Such a confusion of alleged poetic intent and semantics undermines his claims. 3.3 'False friends'. The basis for these papers is a discredited approach to lan- guage teaching, i.e. the translation approach. Just as the age-old concept of 'hard words' (established by a mediocre C16th grammarian, Mulcaster) is no alternative to a theory of native language acquisition, so 'false friends' are a no more than a didactician's makeshift for a theory of language interference. Though no doubt research such as Gläser's (cf. 3.3.3 below) can provide a useful tool for a damage limitation operation, it does not provide a feasible didactics of foreign language learning. It is comparable to taking a taxonomy of mutants as a theory of biogeny. 3.3.1 Barnickel ('Trügerische Verwandte: Überlegungen zu einer Erweiterung des false friends- Begriffs', p.247-250) is a brief plea for the extension of the notion of 'false friends' to include 'deceptive relations' or 'deceptive kin', i.e. lexical items that are etymologically related but have either undergone different development prior to their establishment in English or German, or have undergone orthographic or accen- tual changes, have followed different vowel shifts, or have changed sense. Finally, he notes cases where items semantically related to base words, like breast:Brust are latinate in English: pectoral , but not German: Brust -, and suggests how dictionaries might accommodate such cases. Some cases of 'deceptive kin', however, are only interesting as anecdotal marginalia to illustrate how a knowledge of Latin or Greek might induce German speakers to hit upon false English forms. An inaccuracy noted: affectations for 'Allüren' is unusual - it's normally singular, cf. 'airs'. There is no bibliography. 3.3.2 Fanning ('Falsche Freunde in verschiedenen Sprachen: Ein Vergleich des Deutschen, Englischen und Russischen', p.271-280) looks at 'false friends' in German and English, and Russian and English from four points of view: phonology; orthography; morphology; semantics; and also looks for an explanation for the semantic false friends in historical terms. Her examples are based on the lemmata given under the letter 'A' in a basic list for English cross-checked with monolingual dictionaries of English, German and Russian. The gleanings for semantic false friends -the most important group -are classified as absolute or partial false friends, the latter being subdivided into: 1) those with more sememes in English of which a) the first meaning is identical, b) the first meaning is different; 2) those with more sememes in German or Russian; 3) those with the first meaning identical and the same number of semes; 4) those with different semes in one sememe (stylistically</page><page sequence="15">Buchbesprechungen 393 neutral); 5) those with a difference in one sememe (stylistically marked); 6) those with a difference in range of application though with identical basic meaning; 7) those with a difference in topolectal terms. The results are carefully presented and exemplified, but the conclusion arrived at, that closely related languages share more similar words than less closely related ones, but that for German and Russian the number of false friends is surprisingly close, will hardly shake the linguistic community to its founda- tions. 3.3.3 Gläser ('False Friends in LSP vocabulary - with special reference to foreign language teaching', p.281-292) looks at 'false friends' in English and German techni- cal vocabularies and the way they are handled in ESP (English for Special Purposes) textbooks: medicine, chemistry, mathematics, physics, process engineering, civil engineering, economics. Here, too, a distinction is drawn between total and partial 'false friends'. Strangely, a confusion (in general vocabulary) between, e.g. take place and sit down (cf. German 'Platz nehmen') is excluded per definitionem by Gläser. In a final section, she discusses some interesting cases with 'onymic constituents', i.e. names of inventors, etc. like Boyle's [sic] Law- it is incorrectly printed as 'Boyle Law'. Her conclusion: "The general phenomenon of interlingual interference caused by false friends is omnipresent in the training of technical translators and ESP learners in university courses and, therefore, deserves appropriate theoretical and linguodidactic treatment" is rather more cautious than that of the preceding paper. 3.3.4 Siegrist ("'False friends" in Varietäten des Englischen mit Bezug auf die Ausgangssprache Deutsch', p. 337-341) gives us further insights from a topolectal point of view. Many of these are pretty well-known, like vest (AmE) = waistcoat (BrE) = Weste (G); vest (BrE) = undershirt (AmE) = Unterhemd (G). His purpose is to appeal for more variety-sensitive approaches to 'false friends' in the didactics and methodology of foreign language learning. Many of the examples are tried and tested; two that are less hackneyed are s (c)hlepper and schmuck in American English, both of which he glosses as 'blöder Kerl, Blödmann', which is somewhat misleading. Both are originally Yiddish, and depend for their insultingness, depending on context and speaker, on their original or base meaning: shlepper's comparable to drip , slob , s/itf in BrE, cf. G. Niete, Penner , Schlampe (and is not gender-specific), while schmuck is like calling someone a prick or pillock in BrE. 'False friends' here seem to be encountering 'genteel aunts'! 4.0 Volume II begins with a section on Pragmatics and Sociolinguistics, which is not a particularly happy marriage of subjects. Two papers (4.1) are really typological, though not in a 'typological universal' sense; they could perhaps be characterized as 'the pragmatics of typology', using 'pragmatics' in the general rather than the linguistic sense. Three (4.2) involve language specific and culturally-based conventions, behavioural or socio-pragmatics; two others (4.3) look at the functions of discourse elements, pragmatics in the classical sense in linguistics, one involves</page><page sequence="16">394 Buchbesprechungen the sociology of language use (4.4), and finally one (4.5) looks at dialect change and its social correlates. 4.1 'Pragmatics of typology' 4.1.1 Čmejrková (linguistic comparison and linguistic characterology', p. 3-8) is a statement of how the Prague school, as exemplified by Mathesius, with its notion of linguistic characterology stands in relation to language typology. Characterizing a language as a discrete whole, rather than viewing it as a construct composed of an individual selection from a set of universal features (parameters), appears to come closer to a metaphysical view of a language, 'the spirit of a language' in Ertl's terms. This lies behind speakers' senses of correctness, conformity and nativity, senses which may be disrupted by exposure to other languages. Cmejrková's purpose in establishing this is to pave the way for a brief and rather slight consideration of how difficult it will be for Slavic languages, with their multiple marking of gender, to suc- cumb to the influence from English and German in 'revising the patriarchal paradigm', i.e. in avoiding sex-specific formulation. 4.1.2 Tesak, Niemi &amp; Koivuselkä-Sallinen (Telegraphese and ellipsis in German and Finnish: A comparison, p. 75-83) consider a comparison between the kinds of ellipsis in German and Finnish determined by telegraphese. The main findings seem to be that because of their nature the two languages differ markedly with respect to ellipsis: German employs it extensively, Finnish less so (88.8% to 22.4%). This is surely no great surprise: the agglutinativity of Finnish means that words contain a lot of grammatical information; the (partial) analyticity of German that 'words' tend towards agrammaticality, syntactic relations being indicated by markers, which are precisely what can be omitted when their function is redundant or predictable. (The inclusion of English would no doubt have revealed its even greater propensity for ellipsis/telegraphese, as superficial comparison of headline conventions implies.) 4.2 Culturally based linguistic conventions 4.2.1 Engberg ('Pragmatische Aspekte einer komparativen Analyse von deutschen und dänischen Urteilen', p. 6-19) is a work-in-progress report of a 'Textsorten' approach to a typology of German and Danish judgments in civil proceedings. The core of the paper is a structural comparison of signalling functions, lexical conven- tions and frequent syntagma in the various subtexts of typical judgments, the purpose being to improve the translatability of such judgments. One of the interesting fortu- itous findings of this approach is the fact that a variety of modais are relatively frequent in one type of subtext in Danish, while the equivalent subtext in German is practically limited (in the corpus material) to the deontically anonymous haben zü+lnfinitive construction. This contribution could have been included in the Transla- tion section. 4.2.2 Fill ('Joking in English and German: A contrastive study', p. 21-31) offers a comparison of spontaneous, even if conventionalized and socially integrative joking</page><page sequence="17">Buchbesprechungen 395 (as opposed to telling jokes) in English and German on a number of parameters including frequency and distribution, laterality, techniques, preferred topics, object of joke and function. Though he avoids stereotyping, and has to admit that his sets of data are not well enough matched to allow statistical evaluation, some of his findings do tend to support such generalized impressions as flippancy or earnestness. On the other hand, by taking 'English' and 'German' as supranational speech communities, (national or regional) cultural distinctions may be overlooked. The data is largely taken from Corpus of English Conversation and Texte gesprochener deutscher Standardsprache supplemented by other text material and personal observation. 4.2.3 Trommer ('Metacommunication in interviews', p. 67-73) This looks at metacommunication phenomena in printed interviews (in time). Metacommunication is communication about communication or, following Stubbs, Verbal monitoring of the speech situation'. This includes what Halliday would call the interpersonal and textual components. What she selects from her interview corpus are interviewers' topic introducers, qualifying strategies, role specification and interviewees' content organiz- ing (comparable in many ways to conjuncts in Quirk et alii's terms), comments on the form of a question, refusals and hedges, specification of attitude (many of which would be disjuncts in Quirk et alii's terms), concept clarifying, and attention formulae. These are then compared selectively and briefly with metacommunication in spoken discourse and scholarly articles. Many of these are fairly predictable differences based on the medium (or the editing thereof) or formality (no attention checks like Are you listening? in printed interviews); intratextual reference was markedly different, there being only two anaphors and no cataphors in the printed interview corpus. This is intralingual Contrastive Analysis, rather than Contrastive Linguistics in the usual sense. 4.3 Discourse elements 4.3.1 Kryk ('A cross-linguistic look at discourse particles', p.43-49) reports on the Polish particle no and its uses, with an areal linguistic look at similar particles in Russian, Czech, German and Slovenian as part of a Sprachbund. The links are quite plausible, though one language central to this Sprachbund, Hungarian, is not consid- ered. Her examples are treated somewhat cavalierly -no accents in Polish or Czech, and the Russian is given using an apparently Polish transliteration. I miss, despite the otherwise fairly extensive bibliography, any reference to Walter Arndt's 1960 paper comparing German and Russian, and Maria Schubiger's 1965 paper comparing English prosodie variation with German discourse particles. 4.3.2 Ramisch ('English tag questions and their equivalents in German', p. 51-59) outlines formal properties of tag questions, miscalculating the maximum number of possible collocations since he is apparently unaware that there functions like a subject with all operators except am. He suggests German equivalents, one or two of them being very dicey, and compares what 6 German grammars of English (for Sekundarstufe) have to say on them. Generally, I find this a rather naïve secondary</page><page sequence="18">396 Buchbesprechungen discussion that is too reliant on other accounts - no apparent empirical basis or use of informants. The examples, particularly those for which German equivalents are offered, require more pragmatic explication than they are given. 4.4 Sociology of Language Use 4.4.1 Hardt-Mautner ('Absorbing news?' Investigating the production and compre- hension of radio news from a sociolinguistic and contrastive point of view', p. 33-41) This is a report of findings from a survey of comprehensibility of BBC1 vs. BBC4 news among 400 or so 16-18 year-old sixth formers (subdivided into grammar vs. comprehensive schools) and 27 45-60 year olds. The study was an attempt to replicate work by Lutz and Wodak on Austrian radio news (ORF), while extending and refining it analytically. The main contrasts: ORF news was generally found to be hard to follow; BBC news was generally felt to be easy to follow. Simplified ORF news reports led to a widening of the gap between those who understood well and those who didn't; the simpler BBC1 format led to a reduction of the gap between achievers and underachievers, which I suppose is good news for 'dumb downers'. Some of the variables looked at, 'gender', social class and school types, correlate significantly with achievement: grammar school students achieved better on formal BBC4 news than comprehensive school students, which I suppose is bad news for non-selective education. 4.5 Dialect Change and Demographic Change 4.5.1 Schütz ('Hase wie Hose ? Lautliche Veränderungen in der Mundart von Achenkirch', p. 61-66) takes five distinctively local features noted by Moser in his 1962 Innsbruck dissertation on certain NE Tirolean dialects and examines their reflexes or equivalents in the current young generation - generally, they have been lost and replaced by forms that conform better to the local regional variety, and there is strong demographic evidence why this should have happened. Her analysis is sound, but unfortunately she uses an obscure computer readable version of SDS transcription (Sprachatlas der deutschen Schweiz), which makes interpreting values even more difficult for a phonetically inclined human than SDS itself, which is unfamil- iar to many scholars outside the field. 5.0 Translation. From a number of these contributions one gets the impression that the goals of (descriptive) linguistics are rather poorly understood by 'translatologists', as some of them would style themselves; some may be excellent translators, but they should beware of claiming to be linguists. Typical of such linguis- tic posing is the latching onto some buzzword concept - here it is Fillmore's 'scenes and frames' proposal - and using it as some kind of philosopher's stone that explains everything there is to know about translation, and saves one the bother of finding out what linguistics is really all about. I have divided the contributions into those con- cerned with translation practice (5.1) and those concerned more with theory (5.2).</page><page sequence="19">Buchbesprechungen 397 5.1 Translation Practice 5.1.1 Ben-Shahar (Translating literary dialogue: The problem, and translation into Hebrew', p.87-94) This is a general statement about the parameters to be taken account of in translating literary dialogue: information, expressive, conative, phatic, and why modern Hebrew in particular has a poor tradition in literary dialogue, let alone its translation. 5.1.2 Denton ('Elegant variation, informativity and co-reference in Italian/English translation', p.95-106) focuses on a stylistic difference between English and Italian: a preference in English for anaphoric chains vs. a preference in Italian for 'elegant variation' (referentially synonymous definite descriptions that are typically non-infor- mative, at best reinforcive, e.g. "the victor at Austerlitz". German tends to be like English, French like Italian. Illustrates how the failure to replace one by the other makes Italian-English or English-Italian translation pragmatically inappropriate, with associations of pretentious floweriness or prosaic flatness respectively. 5.1.3 Lee ('A contrastive analysis of Chinese zero anaphoric subjects in English translations', p. 107-115) This is concerned with strategies for the translation of Chinese zero-subjects, viz. 1) subject reference, 2) subject specification, 3) subject connection via hypotaxis, etc., 4) subject rearrangement (rephrasing and changing of clause sequences), 5) leaving unspecified through the use of passives or existentials. It would have been good to see this linked to Foley and Van Valin's (proto-universal) differentiation of pragmatic and semantic pivot languages - English, for example, has a pragmatic subject pivot throughout clauses in common with many European languages. 5.1 .4 Schaffner ('Translating governmental documents', p. 143-154) This is a rather lengthy attempt to analyze political texts in German and British and American Eng- lish. It is concerned with cultural content, but the most productive part is a consider- ation of how metaphor is handled in translation. Despite occasional references to 'frames', cf. Pöchhacker's and Snell-Hornby's papers, this is a practical rather than a theoretical contribution. 5.2 Translation Theory 5.2.1 Niedzielski ('Cultural and linguistic contrasts in translating and interpreting', p.1 17-129) makes an appeal for cultural translation, which tries on the one hand to give an historical overview and yet on the other to exemplify cultural translation of metaphor, proverbs and humour. Though clearly based on a great deal of knowledge of the field (over two pages of bibliography), it is written a little too casually (it has points of non-sequitur, citations that appear irrelevant to the point being made) and with too much hype: gratuitous evaluation epithets abound, which makes one wonder whether their use might not be another culturally variable stylistic phenomenon like the 'elegant variation' examined by Denton above.</page><page sequence="20">398 Buchbesprechungen 5.2.2 Pöchhacker ('Contrastive frame semantics for translation: Problems and prospects', p. 131-142) Despite the state-of-the-art, overview dimensions of this contribution, I find it a rather confused attempt to exploit an as yet only half formu- lated distinction between 'frame' and 'scene' (Fillmore passim). The arguments in general are poorly illustrated. He rejects Leechian semantics, though apparently unaware of the import of doing so: how apart from rigidly distinguishing sense and denotation, language knowledge vs. language use, can one handle figurative aspects of language? And besides, Leech is not the only practitioner of this brand of seman- tics, though others do not figure in Pöchhacker's bibliography. He makes much of the problems of translating Jäger into English: 'Jäger' and 'hunter' are not just socio- culturally distinct, they are also not isomorphic denotationally, which Leechian se- mantics would be able to express. The term he needs to supplement 'hunter' is 'game warden'. The overall impression is that applied linguistics, of which "translatology" is a part, with literary or socio-cultural metaphysics rather than linguistic analyticity as a basis is a very murky subject indeed. 5.2.3 Snell-Hornby ('System vs. text: From contrastive linguistics to translation theory', p. 155-165 - plenary). In contrast to the foregoing, this is an illuminating discussion of the relationship between linguistics and 'translatology', using four carefully selected examples which depend on: 1) culturally-based conventions (pragmatics) 2) culturally-dependent irony (also pragmatics), as well as register, etc. 3) culturally-dependent background knowledge 4) language-specific information structuring. She argues, in particular, that Contrastive Linguistics when descriptive (in grammar) and when psychological (in lexis, cf. Rosch's prototype theory) can be of considerable use in translation. The usefulness of other approaches, especially typological ones is questioned. Translation is a decision process that can be aided by good CL descriptions. Translatologists are shown to have discovered text and text linguistics long before linguists. 6.0 Language Learning and Language Acquisition Research. The papers in this section fall into three groups: those that are theoretical (6.1), those that are method-oriented (6.2), and those that involve experimentation and analysis (6.3). 6.1 The theory of language learning and language acquisition. 6.1.1 James ('Awareness, consciousness and language contrast', p. 183-198- plenary) is a closely argued statement on the roles and relationships of skills, intu- itions and 'metacognition' in language awareness and consciousness-raising in foreign and second language learning, which draws a brief practical moral for con- trastive linguistics: what to raise to consciousness, when to do so, and how to do so. In discussing 'how', James vindicates - though without much argument now -that well-known and controversial language operation, translation! 6.1.2 Nickel ('Recent trends in error analysis: 'Contrastive' vs. 'non-contrastive' errors', p.21 1-222 - plenary) Despite the title, this is more of an attempt to</page><page sequence="21">Buchbesprechungen 399 contextualize Contrastive Linguistics and its various schools with respect to Foreign Language and Second Language acquisition, and also to delimit it to an extent from Error Analysis - somewhat undirected and confusing in argumentation, it reads in part like a review of Dulay, Burt and Krashen (1982). Ultimately, more a defence of Error Analysis than an overview of Contrastive Linguistics. 6.1 .3 Wekker ('Contrastive linguistics and second language acquisition', p.279-292 - plenary) is a well structured and well presented paper on the recent history of Contrastive Linguistics in second language learning, and the competing claims of Universal Grammar (UG), Government and Binding (GB) and Typological Universal (TU) theories. On the basis of test cases like 'Pro-drop', empty categories and wh- movement, subjacency, etc. he re-examines the interpretation of experiments made by committed UG-researchers, and finds that the claims are overstated and the proofs equivocal or even lacking. Second Language acquisition from a TU position fares better. He concludes with a proposal for a balance between CL and language typology, and claims that it is L,, as a product of (human) language capacity, that is exploited in the acquisition of L2, not UG. 6.2 Language Learning Methods 6.2.1 Selinker &amp; Kuteva ('Metaphor as a consciousness-raising strategy', p. 247-259) argue -at times somewhat sophistically - for a 'Metaphor Consciousness- Raising Strategy' (MC-RS) in language learning. 'Metaphor' is taken as anything non- literal, i.e. includes abstraction, generalization, metonymy, synecdoche, metaphor proper, etc. They work through an example involving the polysemy of get, which is illuminating so far as it goes, but which throws up a number of analytical questions. It is claimed that a structured presentation of such polysemous items improves acquisition. But a stronger claim is made, though then diluted to an hypothesis, namely that, once acquired, the MC-RS can be used as a learning strategy. They suggest that the variable semantics and the notional vagueness of the German verbal prefix aus- might be an area where it could be employed. Though they refer to empirical work, there is absolutely no rigorous testing of the claims/hypotheses made. Their apparent belief in the (synchronic) motivation of morphological and phraseologi- cal structure seems to be pushing Foreign Language and Second Language teaching and learning back to the comparative, etymological paradigm. 6.2.2 Wallmannsberger ('cascade - Computer-aided, student-centred approaches to the description of errors: Perspectives in applied contrastive analysis', p. 261-277) presents ways of using various software and applications in advanced language learning, in particular programs called tact and ERR/Base, an interactive textual database using hypertext. These allow not only records of errors (provided the learners' texts and their correction are adequately tagged), but also collation of particular types of errors, as well as their probable causes, and also references to dictionaries, etc. where more information is to be found. The basic tenet is that advanced learning relies on a kind of linguistic analysis process, and that, even if the</page><page sequence="22">400 Buchbesprechungen CALL-euphoria has now waned, computer-based methods still have a significant part to play in language learning. 6.3 Experimentation and Analysis 6.3.1 Cots ('Native and non-native speakers' intuitions about conversational compe- tence', p. 1 69-1 81 ) tests native and non-native reactions to a set of multiple choice items to complete an actual piece of spontaneous dialogue. The text used as a basis was somewhat dysfluent; there were no clear differences in sensitivity towards natural spoken discourse, so the results are largely equivocal. Native speakers, significantly, did consistently select more formal/more polite items. It seems to me that there is a flaw in the experiment in using multiple choice: how would groups have looked if subjects had been asked to fill in instead of select? The evaluation, too, seems somewhat flawed in not presenting a correlation of types of pragmatic function (sociolinguistic and discourse) with the performance of the two groups. 6.3.2 Laufer ('Native language effect on confusion of similar lexical forms', p.1 99-209). This is concerned with confusibility of similar lexical forms in L2 learning - distinguishes 10 types of similarity of form ['synforms'] which reduce to four metatypes: suffix, prefix, vocalic and consonantal. Carefully argued and presented, she establishes that, for example, Semitic learners are least error prone on conso- nantal 'synforms' but much more so on vocalic 'synforms'; that Germanic learners score well on prefix 'synforms', poorly on suffix 'synforms'. There appear to be clear L1-determined prejudices in acquiring the mental lexicon, so L2-acquisition does not reflect L1-acquisition directly. Form, rather than meaning, appears, overall, to be the primary organizational principle in lexicon acquistion, particularly in the case of unrelated languages. 6.3.3 Plag ("'There was a man picking pears': Participial /'ng-clauses in native lan- guage, interlanguage, and target language", p. 223-235). As the title suggests, this is an examination of the role particular constructions; presentational and perception participial clauses, play in learners' oral and written language use (compared to their native (oral) use and to the use of native speakers of the target language). What transpires is that both an error avoidance strategy as well as an erroneous transfer of native language pragmatics to the target language conspire to make these con- structions commoner among non-native speakers than native speakers. 6.3.4 Rakušan ('Contrastive approach to the strategies of naming in ESL', p. 237-246) presents an interesting study of differences between two generations of Czech immigrants to Canada (1948 and 1968), which reveals the significance of different types of language training: the 1948 group had some English (and German) in Czech schools, but no language tuition in Canada; the 1968 group had primarily Russian in Czech schools and a programme of English language instruction in Canada. The results do not, however, prove the author's contention, following Trnka and other Prague school linguists, that English has "syntagmatic or sentence orienta-</page><page sequence="23">Buchbesprechungen 40 1 t¡on", while Czech has "etymological or word orientation", though this may be very plausible. Other means of testing, including testing of native English processes, would be necessary to prove the significance of this distinction. 6.3.5 Wieden ('On contrastive analysis and second language acquisition', p. 293-300) presents selected statistical data to demonstrate that acquisition of L2 phonology is not simply a case of transfer in one direction or the other, but of "gradual approximation via intermediate variants", the moral being that more comprehensive and refined methods of CA are needed to understand how L2 phonology is acquired. 6.3.6 Zimmermann ('Lexical knowledge: Evidence from L1 and L2 narratives and L1-L2 translation', p.301-311) reports on categories of lexical insecurity indicators developed by the author for a project 'Analysis of Lexical Errors and Strategies' (ALES). There are twenty in all, with differing types of property: pausing, commenting, questioning, code-switching, etc., many of which may be symptomatic of a set of different disturbance, disruption or other dysfunctional performance phenomena. The whole is rather tentative, and in taking examples from both narration and translation together, Zimmermann appears to ignore the very different processes involved, unless one assumes, controversially, that narration is covert translation from Lv This paper has some histograms appended to it on pause profiles, which, though referred to in the text, are not explained. This is perhaps an appropriate enough way for the second volume to fizzle out. 7.0 Discussion Apart from provoking me to occasional flippancy, the foregoing has, I think, more than underscored my point that conference proceedings of this nature, despite being brought under the umbrella of 'contrastive linguistics', are disparate and unwieldy. This, however, is an objection that could be leveled at many conference proceedings, unless the editing of papers is rigorous and selective, or unless the conferences themselves are rigidly, and even narrowly, thematic. One example of the latter that springs to mind is is the Conference on Current Approaches to Syntax of 1979 (University of Madison-Milwaukee), which resulted in a volume edited by Moravcsik and Wirth (1980) Current Approaches to Syntax. Syntax and Semantics, vol. 13 (New York: Academic Press). Here the contributors were all given a brief, a list of theoreti- cal issues and problems, and a set of sample sentences, to which their papers had to respond in the light of their particular model of syntax. The result, even if a couple of participants withdrew their contributions, was an extremely successful and useful state-of-the-art presentation of (western) syntactic models. Translated into the terms of the status of Contrastive Linguistics, albeit a much wider topic, this would mean posing questions like: what needs to be incorporated into a contrastive phonology of, say, English and German; which descriptive model of syntax is most appropriate for a comprehensive contrastive account of, say, French and Chinese; how many parameters and categories are needed for a contrastive pragmatics of, say, Russian</page><page sequence="24">402 Buchbesprechungen and Italian discourse, etc. The editors point out that the plenary speakers, in particu- lar, chose their topics on the basis of methodological questions involved in contrast- ing languages - but this clearly doesn't go far enough: in most papers such questions are only subordinately or implicitly present. Another way of getting some kind of thematic unity into such an enterprise would have been to invite contributors to address the question of establishing a program for research in Contrastive Linguistics relevant to their particular discipline. Instead of this, we have a large number of papers, some of good quality and interesting in themselves, that would be better included in more specific collections. And we have discussions of issues that are largely fortuitous, rather than essential. Essential issues include, from a theoretical stance, typological universais (in morphol- ogy and syntax), basic 'monosemicity' (alias grundbedeutung) in semantics, and discourse universais in pragmatics; and from an applied linguistic stance: language facility and acquisition (cf. Language Acquisition Device) and interlanguage and language learning. Fortuitous issues include: 'false friends', 'scenes and frames', interference and performance problems, language learning methods, social and cultural composition and attitudes, and even cultural translation - an issue that goes back generations. But perhaps there is a fundamental question that should be posed: What is Contrastive Linguistics? Is it a branch of linguistics in its own right? Surely it is no more than a purpose-oriented application of descriptive and explanatory methods to two (or more) languages. So the issues and questions and problems facing Contras- tive Linguistics are those of Linguistics tout court , plus the question of application, and, of course, purpose: are we contrasting simply for the scholarly goal of the perfection of scientific pursuit (i.e. analyzing everything imaginable) or for the purpose of applying the contrast in translation, language learning and acquisition, etc. or for the purpose of gaining a better understanding of language (as opposed to languages) as a fundamental human capacity. It is the answers to such questions that determine Contrastive Linguistics. If a formalization of the morphology, syntax, semantics and pragmatics of time indicators (as a common, if not quasi-universal, feature) in two languages leads to better human (or machine) translations, then this is not a vindica- tion of contrastive linguistics but of linguistics in general. And if a translatologist over- extends concepts like 'scenes and frames', this is in part an indictment of the narrow- ness of general linguistic theory and its failure to provide an adequate cognitively- based pragmatics. If we now view Contrastive Linguistics as it is usually practised on two, or at best a few, languages in the light of language as a human capacity, and the attendant question of universais, then it seems that Contrastive Linguistics is far too limited an exercise, there being currently little prospect of it showing up anything more than communality within a Sprachbund - a controversial enough notion as it is. It is debatable whether we can approach the question of universais by factorization from a sufficiently large number of contrasted language pairs. The question of universais, then, seems to demand a typological approach, which is dependent for its success on the comprehensivity and rigour and 'diplomaticity' (if one can borrow a concept</page><page sequence="25">Buchbesprechungen 403 from the business of manuscript redaction) and comparability of single language descriptions. Little that is produced these days in the name of Universal Grammar is either comprehensive or diplomatic, and it is increasingly lacking in rigour, too. Here typologists have the edge, and the contributions to these volumes that are typological in approach are among the more thought-provoking ones, even if they are fairly selective in their data. So is Contrastive Linguistics really Contrastive Analysis? I suspect that this is the view that some applied linguists, including James, who, in 1980, published a widely regarded monograph under this title. From the point of view of Applied Linguistics, it is Contrastive Analysis, rather than Contrastive Linguistics that is the raw material of a number of applications of linguistics: the study of bi- and multi-lingualism (sociolin- guistics and psycholinguistics), theories of L1 acquisition and L2 learning, and theories of translation. Here I feel the contributions are disappointing, because they fail, largely, particularly in the translation section, to address the question of how CA is presupposed by the various disciplines of Applied Linguistics. To come now to a sort of conclusion, the kind of question that should be asked in an enterprise like the one under discussion is not so much: What (or which) new departures can be discerned in Contrastive Linguistics?, but rather, from a general linguistic point of view: How does (or can) Contrastive Linguistics reflect new depar- tures in Linguistics? or, from an applied linguistic point of view: How can new theoreti- cal insights and new methods in corpus analysis, etc. be exploited for a better understanding of the workings of foreign and second language learning or of transla- tion? The conference papers only fit such questions partially. There may, however, be a fundamental contradiction between such a scholarly expectation and the political terms of reference of the conference at the time it was held - not just between general/theoretical and applied linguistic goals, but also between a privileged western group and a disadvantaged eastern group that had only just begun to have - albeit theoretically -access to international linguistic literature. Contrastive Linguistics as represented in these two volumes is lop-sided with respect to general/theoretical linguistics vs. applied linguistics, and with respect to western vs. eastern practioners.
