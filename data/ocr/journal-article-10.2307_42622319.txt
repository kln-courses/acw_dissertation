Early excava- tions in this region by members of the Larco family provided the first extensive collec- tions of Moche ceramic vessels for the study of this complex society (Berrin 1997; Larco Hoyle 1938, 1939, 1963, 1966). Nevertheless, apart from a few studies of monumental architectural and funerary contexts, very lit- tle was known about the Moche occupation of the Chicama Valley until recently. This paper provides an overview of Moche sites in the valley, followed by a summary of the recent investigations at the El Brujo complex, a major site located close to the Pacific Ocean (fig. 1). A decade of excavations and conserva- tion at Huaca Cao Viejo, a large platform mound at the El Brujo complex, has led to the discovery of polychrome friezes and murals, providing exceptional information on Moche ritual practices, use of space and ideology. The Moche established sites throughout the Chicama Valley from the Andean foothills, at some 1000 m above sea level, down to the middle valley and the Pacific coast, where the most important settlements are found (fig. 1). This large area offers a range of ecosystems, including coastal lagoons and plains along the Chicama River, hillsides and mountain peaks in the middle and upper valley areas, and deserts. The Upper Chicama Valley In a desert area located toward the upper Chicama Valley, some 39 km away from the Pacific Ocean and 500 m above sea level, lies the site of San Nicolás (fig. 2). This Moche settlement occupies the south and west sides of a rocky slope forming part of the extreme west of Cerro Serrucho, at the confluence of the quebrada San Nicolás and Santa Maria. The site consists of two sectors, the first of which is located on the south side of the slope and characterized by terraces and stone re- taining walls. The other sector is an elevated terrace above the dry riverbeds and consists of a group of structures with stone foundations. At San Nicolás, Moche IV fineware and ceramics of a style known as Cajamarca cur- sivo were found (fig. 3). The latter suggests that the inhabitants of this site were in con- tact with the highland Cajamarca culture. Additionally, petroglyphs depicting anthropo- morphic and geometric representations were identified at the site near a spring. It seems likely that San Nicolás was contemporaneous with middle to late Moche sites in the middle and lower Chicama Valley, and may have been occupied during an episode of climatic upheaval related to an El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. Another relatively important Moche settle- ment in the upper valley was found at Pampas de Jagüey. This site occupies the northeastern side of Cerro Peña del Gallinazo-Gashpa, in 141</page><page sequence="3">the narrowest section separating the middle and upper valley (fig. 4). It lies at the conflu- ence of the Chicama and Quirripano rivers (to the south of Pampas de Jagüey), over 400 m above sea level and 54 km away from the ocean. At Pampas de Jagüey, Moche III and IV phase ceramics vessels were found as well as Cajamarca ceramics (fig. 5). There is evidence for ceramic production at this site, including the creation of mold-made ceramics. Nonres- idential structures were constructed with adobe bricks. The residential units are lo- cated on tiered terraces with stone and clay retaining walls (fig. 6). Elite tombs were constructed within the monumental sector of the site. Construction techniques of the buildings and adobe types suggest that Pam- pas de Jagüey was contemporaneous with the later phases at the El Brujo complex and Mocollope. A third major Moche site in the upper val- ley is Cerro Grande, located over 1000 m above sea level, and 62 km east of the ocean. This settlement would have occupied a strategic position in terms of coast-highland contacts. Both Moche IV fineware and Caja- marca domestic vessels have been found (fig. 7). As with the site of Galindo (Bawden, this volume, and 1977), a large wall seems to have separated elite from commoner architecture (fig. 8). Elite architecture consists of small residential units (fig. 9) with quadrangular precincts connected to each other, with open- ings, narrow passages, benches, and niches. In some cases, stone grinding tools are found. Commoner architecture consists of simple structures occupying a terrace south of the large wall. These three sites from the upper Chicama Valley - San Nicolás, Pampas de Jagüey and Cerro Grande - are interesting in that they all document occupation during the Middle and Late Moche periods and indicate contacts with communities of the highlands, as evidenced by ceramic artifacts recovered. These sites may have served as places of refuge when the valley floor, the usual location of agricultural produc- tion, was adversely affected by ENSO flood- ing. Licapa, discussed below, also in a desert setting, may have served a similar purpose. i . Principal Moche sites in the Chicama Valley 142 GÁLVEZ AND BRICEÑO</page><page sequence="4">2.

View of the monumental sector of Pampas de Jagüey GÁLVEZ AND BRICEÑO I43</page><page sequence="5">Our ethnographic data indicate that in nor- mal climatic conditions it is impossible to live in the desert due to the complete lack of water resources. During an El Niño, however, the valley is dramatically affected: strong rains prompt the appearance of springs in the desert, and dry ravines like San Nicolás are converted into rivers, making cultivation possible during periods as long as a year after the end of the ENSO event. Thus, in January 1999, agricul- turists seeded maize along the banks of nor- mally dry rivers, which carried water as a con- sequence of the intense precipitation of the 1998 El Niño. For example, in the typically dry Quirripano River area corn had been harvested for the second time, with a yield of 4,000- 5,000 kilos per hectare, without the use of the insecticides or chemical fertilizers that are common in normally fertile areas, where the yield reaches 6,000 kilos per hectare. Additionally, such catastrophic events may have led to some sort of ritual practices regarding sites in places considered to be close to the origins of water, particularly up- valley sites near springs and hills. This short- term contact may have led to a renewal of Moche beliefs: a special exchange with the ancestors in their "natural" temples. The Middle Chicama Valley Our understanding of the Moche occupation in the middle Chicama Valley mainly comes from investigations around Cerro Mocollope, located at the center of the lower valley. A number of other sites with Moche occupa- tions such as Fachén, Chicamita, San Ramón, Portachuelo and La Arenita have been identi- fied, but these are of a smaller scale and are not discussed here. The site of Mocollope occupies the hill- sides and summit of Cerro Mocollope and the hillside of Cerro Mayal, over 200 m above sea level and 22 km from the ocean (fig. 10). Mocollope is one of the largest settlements in the valley, representing c. 500,000 m3 of con- struction (Attarian 1996: 6-9). The monu- mental architecture at Mocollope was further enhanced by incorporating the natural topog- raphy of the cerro (hill) and ridges as plat- forms for construction. As with other Moche sites such as Huaca de la Luna (Moche Val- ley), Huancaco (Virú Valley), and Pañamarca (Nepeña Valley), cerros appear to be the focus of the site's planning, with structures located along the foot and sides of the peak. The principal group of buildings was erected on the western side of Cerro Mocollope and contains large precincts and structures on natural terraces projecting towards the coastal plain. Two isolated mounds, dense domestic occupations and cemeteries have also been identified at the site. The site was inhabited from the earlier Gallinazo period, and probably extended through Moche V (fig. 1 1, a). The settlement included a large ce- ramic production area, c. 1.5 km from the ceremonial center of Mocollope, on the flanks of Cerro Mayal (Russell and Jackson, this vol- ume; Russell, Leonard, and Briceño 1994a, 1994b). Polychrome murals have been docu- mented at Mocollope, although they are in poor state of preservation (Reindel 1993: fig. 106; Glenn Russell, personal communication, 1990). Traces of white, gray, yellow, red, and black paint have been documented. From what can be discerned, the best-preserved mural documented to date represents a frontal anthropomorphic figure. 5 .

It is located on a plain below the southeastern flank of Cerro Azul, some 23 1cm from the ocean and over 130 m above sea level. Two principal struc- tures dominate the landscape, around which residential areas and a cemetery were found (fig. 12). The practice of erecting two major monuments at an architectural complex appears to be a pattern at a number of Moche sites, including the El Brujo complex and the site of Moche. After the abandonment of Licapa by the Moche, the site was used as a cemetery by the later Lambayeque culture. The Lower Chicama Valley Moche occupation of the lower Chicama Val- ley has recently been documented at the La Campanilla and El Brujo complexes, as well as other sites not discussed here, such as Tres Huacas. In contrast with the Moche con- structions in the upper valley, the construc- tion materials in the lower valley were largely earthen, as less stone is available in this area. La Campanilla is located c.iom above sea level and 4km east of the Pacific Ocean. This settlement consists of a group of structures, dating to the Middle Moche period, the outer façades of which were originally decorated with clay war clubs (fig. 1 1, b; see also Uceda, this volume). The residential area of this site was unfortunately destroyed by modern agri- cultural activities. The Moche occupation of the lower Chi- cama Valley, however, is best seen at the large El Brujo complex in the littoral. This site occupies a natural terrace, triangular in shape, 17 m above sea level and close to the seashore (fig. 13). The site is close to the important 6.

Two monumental constructions, Huaca El Brujo (also known as Huaca Cortada) (fig. 14) and Huaca Cao Viejo (Huaca Blanca) (fig. 15) dominate the site. Huaca Cortada lies close to the ocean and its important marine resources. The monumental platform was severely 146 GÁLVEZ AND BRICEÑO</page><page sequence="8">io.

The other major monument, Huaca Cao Viejo, is located further inland, in an area of ancient lagoons, today dominated by culti- vated fields. Between these two components is an extensive area where smaller structures thought to represent elite and commoners' residences have been identified. Additionally, production areas, cemeteries, and a deep well have also been identified (Franco, Gálvez, and Vasquez 1998b). Interestingly, no ceramic production areas have been identified at this site yet, which is in marked contrast to Mocollope and Moche, sites comparable in size. Proximity to the sea and its effect on production may have played a role in this, or it is also possible that local production was unnecessary if such goods could be obtained through offerings. It seems likely that the El Brujo complex was the major religious center of the valley over the course of centuries, if not millennia. GÁLVEZ AND BRICEÑO 147</page><page sequence="9">12. View of Licapa 13. Plan of the El Brujo complex Huaca Cao Viejo Huaca Cao Viejo is an architectural complex composed of two main components: a plat- form mound and a large plaza (fig. 16). The platform mound is a roughly square, tiered structure. The plaza, located to the north of the platform, is 140 m long and 80 m wide, and is delimited by high structures and walls to the north, east and west. As of now, the only structure identified within this large space is a small room located in the southeast corner, adjacent to the northern façade of the main building and defined as Precinct 1 . The platform mound has six tiers or ter- races, originally decorated with reliefs painted in bright colors. On the summit of the mound was a smaller platform, also ornamented. Access to the platform mound was possible through a long, steep ramp leading to the east- ern edge of the northern façade. Another ramp led to the top, zigzagging along the façade tiers. A third ramp provided access to the small upper structure from the top of the main platform. Excavations on the top of the platform and along the façades, together with a careful study of adobe brick types and manufacture marks, revealed that the building had been built in at 148 GÁLVEZ AND BRICEÑO</page><page sequence="10">14- View of Huaca Cortada, El Brujo complex Photograph by Edward Ranney (©) least seven successive phases, dating from around the first century a.d. to the seventh century a.d. (Franco 1998: 104). These have been designated Phase A (the most recent) to Phase G (the oldest construction identified so far). Seven corresponding phases were also identified in the excavation of the plaza (Franco, Gálvez, and Vasquez 1996: 88). 1 Moche I, II, III, and IV ceramics have been tound in association with the architecture and burials, and Moche V ceramics have been found only in burials. It is clear that this monument maintained a standard layout for at least the last four con- struction phases. Additionally, we now know that each of the seven successive buildings was decorated. The earliest façades were deco- rated with simple mural paintings. In the later phases, at least on the north façade, relief ornament was preferred (fig. 17). A frag- ment of a geometric relief with interlocking motifs (fig. 17, A) dates to Phase C, or the fifth construction phase. These motifs may repre- sent a stylized fish or serpent, and are typi- cally seen in the earlier phases of Moche iconograpy. Similar reliefs have been noted from the earlier phases of Huaca Cortada (Kroeber 1930: 84). Another relief (fig. 17, B), also associated with Phase C, is composed of a panel of at least six pairs of figures. The fig- ures on the left brandish ceremonial knives and grasp smaller figures, perhaps children, on the right by the hair. Most of the information available on the architecture and decoration of Huaca Cao Viejo comes from the last construction phase (Phase A). The northern façade, the focus of investigations, was decorated with a series of 15. View of Huaca Cao Viejo, El Brujo complex GÁLVEZ AND BRICEÑO I49</page><page sequence="11">bold, brightly painted reliefs, which would have been visible from a considerable dis- tance. The reliefs were made by carving designs on the existing adobe bricks walls, or by applying designs made out of modeled clay (Morales 1994). Subsequently these reliefs were painted white, and eventually they were decorated with bright colors. The first three stepped tiers of the main façade facing the plaza were decorated with some of the most impressive painted reliefs known from any Moche site. The first tier of the platform facing the plaza contains the most arresting imagery: a lifesize depiction of the procession of prison- ers. A Moche warrior is shown leading ten naked prisoners bound together by a rope at their necks (fig. 17, H; fig. 18). Behind this group, to the west, other warriors are depicted carrying garments and weapons, presumably those of the defeated prisoners. Although the east wall is badly damaged, another line of lifesize figures can be discerned (fig. 17, G). The figures appear to be warriors, marching in the direction of the north end of the 16.

Depictions of wounds in the junctures be- tween the penises and the testicles and on the legs of the reliefs suggest that these scenes relate to sacrificial practices where the col- lection of blood was a key element. This relief may represent a portion of an extended ritual, perhaps culminating in the sacrifice of these prisoners (see Bourget, this volume). In the southeast corner of the large plaza that extends to the north of the main platform was a small room (3.8 m x 4 m) defined as Precinct 1. Adjacent to Precinct 1 was a small platform (3.8 m x 5 m) with an access ramp. Originally both the precinct and the small platform were roofed. The roof was decorated with ceramic porras or war clubs (fig. 19), an architectural feature seen in certain buildings in the Chicama Valley (La Campanilla) and elsewhere (see Uceda, this volume). Precinct 1 and a section of wall adjacent to it were decorated with unusual painted reliefs. These were in a style very different to the ones found on the main platform façade. In contrast to the lifesize figures on the ad- jacent walls, the precinct is covered with compositions made up of repetitions of small figures, either aligned in registers or arranged seemingly randomly. On the west wall of Precinct 1 (fig. 17, F, fig. 20) are polychrome reliefs presenting what Hocquenghem (1987: GÁLVEZ AND BRICEÑO I5I</page><page sequence="13">I20- 121 ) has called an allegorical ritual battle. Forty-eight warriors appear in four registers separated by red borders. In each panel there are six pairs of warriors, armed with war clubs and shields, apparently engaged in face-to-face combat. Distinctions in costumes suggest that these pairings repre- sent two distinct groups of warriors (Franco, Gálvez, and Vasquez 1996: 91). The reliefs on the north wall of Precinct 1, however, are more difficult to interpret. Here a plethora of small-scale figures appear to be scattered loosely about the composition (fig. 1 7, E, fig. 21). The flora and fauna of different ecological zones are represented, including river shrimp of the coastal lagoons and river mouths, squirrels of the lower valley, and snakes, owls, deer and fox of the desert and interior valley zones. Mythical animals are also depicted, as are reed boats and nets. Combat scenes are present, as are depictions of figures wearing crowns and carrying maces (fig. 22). On the second tier of the platform above the plaza are depictions of elaborately dressed human figures holding hands, facing outward toward the plaza (fig. 17, D, fig. 23). The fig- ures are shown wearing headdresses, ear orna- ments, and red tunics and loincloths with yellow circles, probably representing gold ornaments that would have been sewn to actual garments. Their faces, hands, and feet are painted black, and their feet project out over a red lower border. In an unusual detail, human and mammal bones were placed in the feet of one of the figures. The human bone was a fragment of a femur, and had clear cut marks on it (Verano and Anderson 1996: 151). The bone may have been taken from a combat or sacrificial victim when the body was " fresh. " The reliefs on the third tier above the plaza are mostly destroyed, but show an anthropo- morphized arachnid (fig. 17, C, fig. 24). This figure is often identified as the Decapitator in Moche iconography (Cordy-Collins 1992: 2 1 . Relief E, Huaca Cao Viejo I52 GÁLVEZ AND BRICEÑO</page><page sequence="14">22. Detail of relief E 217). These reliefs were painted white, black, yellow, and grayish blue. Although partially destroyed, the figure appears half human, half spider, with two appendages on each side of the body, and carries a tumi (ceremonial knife) in the right hand. Excavations on the summit of the main building revealed the existence of a small platform with a ramp oriented east-west (17.6 m long by 1.5 m wide). The remains of several wooden posts were found, indicating the existence of a roofed structure, long since destroyed. Ceramic porias or war clubs were also found here, suggesting that again these may have been used to ornament the roof of this important space. Painted reliefs, also dating to the last construction phase, once graced the walls of the summit structure (fig. 25,- Franco et al. 1999). These reliefs show a high degree of similarity with those of the Great Patio at Huaca de la Luna in the Moche Valley (Uceda, this volume). As with the Huaca de la Luna reliefs, the composition was 23.

Detail of reliefs from the summit of Huaca Cao Viejo organized around rhombi and triangles. The rhombi are encased within several borders, but here the thickest border is rendered as undulating serpents with felinelike heads. The interior spaces of the rhombi were filled with supernatural visages, with volutes ex- tending from the face, bulging eyes, figure- 8 ears, wide and prominent noses, and mouths with feline fangs. The supernatural faces in the triangular spaces created between the rhombi also have serpentlike appendages. The color patterning is similar to the Huaca de la Luna reliefs, with prominent use of red, black, yellow, and white, with some grey. In general terms, there seems to be an evo- lution in the formal treatment of painted reliefs at Huaca Cao Viejo, from the lowest tier to the summit. At the lower levels, the representations are essentially naturalistic - the parade of prisoners and warriors, the com- bat scenes, the murals decorating the walls and ceiling of Precinct 1 - and almost all the elements can be identified with equivalents in the real world (Franco et al. 1999). Moving up the tiered structure, the personages hold- ing hands and the arachnid Decapitator are more abstract, and appear to be more of the supernatural world. The murals decorating the summit are even more disembodied or abstracted, and seem heavily charged with symbolic content. Other interesting features were found on top of Huaca Cao Viejo. In the southwest corner of the monument, large rooms with interior subdivisions, walls with niches, and pillars of adobe bricks were recently exca- vated. These rooms - all associated with Phase D - were painted white, as were the rooms with pillars and pilasters in the corre- sponding location on Platform I at Huaca de la Luna (see Uceda, this volume). In one of these rooms, a sculpted and painted wooden post was found (fig. 2 6), probably deliberately buried during Moche times. A male figure is sculpted in high relief on the front of the post, surmounted by a band on which two super- natural animals are perched, face-to-face. The creatures, often referred to as Moon Animals, have felinelike bodies with long curling tails and prominent sharp claws. Their heads are rendered with enormous maws with inter- locking fangs (the one on the figure on the right is now missing), and headdresses with a stepped design terminating in volutes. They both appear to hold some sort of staff. The fig- ures were painted red, with details in black. A number of burials were also found during excavations. In the southwest corner of the main platform, two large funerary chambers were identified (Tomb 1 and Tomb 2). The careful excavation of these features clearly indicated the existence of complex funerary practices during Moche times, involving the reopening of certain graves (Franco, Gálvez, and Vásquez 1998c, 1999). Tomb i, built within the fill covering Phase D, contained evidence related to two distinct funerary events (Tomb 1 A and Tomb iB). The 154 GÁLVEZ AND BRICEÑO</page><page sequence="16">26. Sculpted wooden post, Huaca Cao Viejo Instituto Nacional de Cultura, La Libertad, Trujillo first interment contained the remains of at least eleven individuals (Verano and Lom- bardi 1999). At a certain point it was reopened and partially emptied. A new chamber was built inside the previous one. Two individuals were buried together inside this new chamber together with Moche III ceramics.2 Tomb 2 was a large funerary chamber, which also con- tained evidence of grave reopening.3 This chamber - also located in the fill covering Phase D - originally contained at least thir- teen individuals buried with both Moche III and IV ceramic vessels. A long cane stalk ( Guadua angustifolia ) was found inside the grave, and may once have served as a grave marker. Finally, a single individual, missing its head, was found buried on top of the main platform in association with Phase D (Franco 1998). The Moche settlement at the El Brujo com- plex was abandoned during the Moche IV period. Our study revealed that this abandon- ment occurred only after the occupants had dismantled parts of the huaca (Franco, Gálvez, and Vásquez 1998c). Subsequently, heavy rains destroyed parts of the monument. Huaca Cao Viejo later served as a burial ground during the Middle Horizon and Late Intermediate periods. A series of Lambayeque burials was found interred in the rubble of the huaca. In contrast to Moche burials, the Lam- bayeque individuals were buried in a seated position, wrapped in textiles. The bundles contained ceramic vessels from the coastal Lambayeque culture, but highland artifacts were also found, together with Spondylus shells and semiprecious stones (Franco, Gál- vez, and Vásquez 1996: 94). Detailed studies of these bundles is still underway by physical anthropologist John Verano and textile special- ist Amy Oakland Rodman, but a preliminary analysis shows that most of the individuals exhibit evidence of cranial deformation. The End of the Moche Occupation in the Chicama Valley It appears that the abandonment of the El Brujo complex in the Moche IV period was contemporaneous with the abandonment of other sites in the Chicama Valley. Few Moche V sherds have been reported from scientific excavations in the valley.4 As noted above, a small number have been found in burials at Huaca Cao Viejo, and a few have been found at Cerro Mayal/Mocollope, but these do not appear to have been produced there (Glenn Russell, personal communication, 1992). It is possible that these ceramics were brought in GÁLVEZ AND BRICEÑO I 5 5</page><page sequence="17">from elsewhere, such as the Jequetepeque Valley, and included in burials at the sites after their principal occupation. It is clear that a number of these sites maintained their prestige after the abandonment in the Moche IV period, as attested to by their use as sacred burials grounds in subsequent periods. The El Brujo complex, perhaps the most important ritual center in the valley, may even have maintained its role as a sacred center into the colonial period: a Dominican convent was built in the great plaza in front of Huaca Cao Viejo (Franco, Gálvez, and Vásquez 1996: 94). Church authorities may have recognized the power of the place, and inserted themselves into the history of a site that had endured for millennia. NOTES The authors acknowledge Lic.

Two circles, one inside the other, were incised into the plaster of the plaza floor in front of the north façade, and associated with Phase B (the penultimate phase). The outside circle was 5.12 m in diameter, and a number of straight lines cut across the circles as well as pass nearby. These lines may have been oriented towards specific points (Franco, Gálvez, and Vásquez 1996: 88). 2. For a complete description of this complex feature, see Franco, Gálvez, and Vásquez 1999b. 3.

A number of Moche V vessels have been reported to have come from the Chicama Valley (de Bock 1998; Larco Hoyle 1938, 1939, 1963, 1966), but in the absence of scientific documentation of their original contexts, these data must be put aside.
