<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST C. BRADFORD WELLES, Editor The Editor wishes to thank those who have helped him in abstracting the material for this issue of the Digest. They are Margaret Brine, John L. Caskey, G. F. Ekholm, Henry Field, Harold N. Fowler, A. Goetze, Paul L. MacKendrick, W. K. Pritchett, and M. I. Wiencke. The following are the principal journals reviewed: Archiv fiir Orientforschung, xiii (1939-1941) and xiv (1942); Annual of the British School at Athens, xliii (1948); Bulletin de correspondance hellinique, lxx (1946); Hesperia, xvii, 3 (1948); Jahrbuch des deutschen archdiologischen Insti- tuts, lix/lx (1943/44); Orientalia, xvi (1947) and xvii (1948). GREECE General LOSSES AND SURVIVALS IN THE DODECANESE. - In BSA, xliii (1948), pp. 193-200, T. W. French publishes a supplement to the Stationery Office book- let, Works of Art in Greece, the Greek Islands, and the Dodecanese. He records the condition at the end of May, 1946, on the islands of Rhodes, Kos, Leros, and Patmos. There is a good deal of deterioration, but little serious damage to the classical, Byzantine, and Mediaeval buildings. (H.N.F.) THE END OF GREEK ART. -Kasimierz Michalowski in BCH, lxx (1946), pp. 385-392, traces the late stages of Greek art, and points out the continuance of cer- tain superior features throughout the Roman imperial period. Although it can be stated in general that Roman imperial art is strongly hellenized and super- ficially uniform, several local styles can readily be distinguished. By way of illustration, a comparison is made between two somewhat similar heads, the Augustus from Prima Porta and the Augustus from Pergamum now in the museum at Stamboul. The former is an historical document in a formal, linear style; the latter is the spiritual portrait of an indi- vidual, and shows the influence of the emotional Hellenistic portraiture. Throughout antiquity Greece continued to create splendid monuments of architec- ture, but always of a conservative nature; and the art of this period, like that of the archaic, is mostly anony- mous, because of the absence of truly great works. Artistic production ceased to be an individual matter and became collective. In the late second and early third centuries A.D. Athens produced great numbers of sarcophagi which were exported even to distant parts of the empire, and which show a high artistic standard. Greek portrait heads of the period of Con- stantine (particularly the "philosopher" heads) reveal a new renaissance of Greek art, a revival of that in- terior dynamism which was seen in the Augustus from Pergamum, and which contrasts strongly with the style of the porphyry group of Tetrarchs from Venice, for instance. The last great plastic monument of the ancient world, the reliefs on the base of the obelisk of Theodosius at Constantinople, shows a style already near the Byzantine. (W.K.P.) EXCAVATIONs. -Homer A. Thompson, "The Ex- cavation of the Athenian Agora, Twelfth Season: 1947," Hesperia, xvii, 3 (July-Sept., 1948), pp. 149- 196. (1) Topography. The plan of the southwest corner of the market square was clarified, the west end of the Middle Stoa was cleared, and there was brought to light a complex of civic offices (plan, p. 152), perhaps built after the Sullan sack of 86 B.c. and destroyed in the Herulian sack of A.D. 267. (2) Tombs. Two more Mycenaean chamber tombs were found on the north slope of the Areopagus close to the two discovered in 1939. Another chamber tomb of the same period, its offerings intact, came to light at the foot of the Hill of the Nymphs. (3) Sculpture. The rich finds included a late archaic Herakles, an Athena torso of a date early in the 30's of the fifth century, a small marble plaque of a horseman in the style of the Parthenon frieze, and a kerchief-bound head (P1. 52) from the Nike parapet. (4) Pottery. The yield was enormous. (5) Inscriptions. 120 were found, of which the most important have already been published by Meritt (Hesp. xvii, pp. 1 ff.) and Ferguson (ib., pp. 112 i ff). (6) Ostraka. The number was virtually doubled. (7) Miscellaneous. These finds included terra-cotta figu- rines and molds, especially of the late Hellenistic and Roman periods; 3460 coins, including eight silver tetrobols of Histiaea (197-146 B.C.); weights and measures; and lamps. (P.L. MacK.) Saul S. Weinberg, "A Cross-Section of Corinthian Antiquities (Excavations of 1940)," ibid., pp. 149-241. The area (24 X30 metres) along the east side of the Corinth Museum affords a relatively complete sam- pling of the material remains from the site as a whole. (P.L.MacK.) EXCAVATIONS AT ITHACA, V. -In BSA, xliii (1948), pp. 1-124, W. A. Heurtley and Martin Robertson describe and discuss the results of excavations at Aetos in 1931, 1932, and 1934. The finds, chiefly pot- 200</page><page sequence="2">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST o01 tery, catalogued and discussed by Mr. Robertson are very numerous. (H.N.F.) Architecture ALCMAEONIDS AT DELPHI. -Pierre de la Coste- Messeliere in BCH, lxx (1946), pp. 271-287, reex- amines the 'problem of the part played by the Alc- maeonids in rebuilding the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. An examination of the material elements leads the present author to believe that the two pediments, with geison and sima, are surely of the Alcmaeonid period, the capitals probably so, and the frieze and epistyle quite possibly so. (W.K.P.) THE GREEK THEATRE CAVEA. -In BSA, xliii (1948), pp. 125-192; 0. A. W. Dilke discusses the cavea of the Greek theatre, its origin as determined by the roughly circular orchestra, and the names of its parts. Vitruvius' ideal directions for the construction of a Greek theatre (Book v) fit almost exactly the theatre at Delos. The Greek odeum (the earliest known is the odeum of Pericles) was a square or rectangular build- ing with pillars or columns supporting the roof. In Roman times the seating is always circular, but the building is square only if it has a roof. (H.N.F.) GRANARIES. - Sp. Marinatos in BCH, lxx (1946), pp. 337-351, rejects Bulle's theory that the earliest Greek houses were circular. This theory was founded on the identification as houses of the circular buildings at Orchomenos. Marinatos believes these buildings to be not houses but granaries. They are dated Early Helladic I by the presence of Urfirnis ware. (W.K.P.) EARLY CHRISTIAN BASILICAS. -Paul Lemerle in BCH, lxx (1946), pp. 319-328, reviews the status of studies on early Christian church architecture in Greece. (W.K.P.) Sculpture PEDIMENTS. -E. Lapalu in BCH, lxx (1946), pp. 299-311, analyzes the development and underlying significance of the central motif on Greek pediments. In the earliest pediments the motif has a mainly apotropaic significance, and even where motion is implied, the figure or figures are static and isolated from the rest of the scene. The introduction of move- ment is accompanied by a diminution in the prophy- lactic intention. The new tendency is seen in the Peisistratid Hekatompedon, where, on the front pedi- ment, a human figure (Athena) replaces the old apotropaion, and where she takes an active part in the scene. This development takes place only gradually, however; and on other pediments of the same period conservatism prevails, notably at Aegina, where there is a conscious archaism and a "calculated hieratism" in the attitude of the central Athena. The Alcmaeonid temple at Delphi marks the introduction of the divine epiphany, the significance of which is mainly didactic and theological. At Olympia, the Zeus of the east pediment is still outside the action, preserving an abstract quality. On the Parthenon pediments, mythology is the dominant factor, and the central figure participates in the action; moreover on the west pediment the center is occupied not by a single figure but by a diverging group of two. These freer tendencies are carried further in the fourth century; the central space is no longer accorded any special importance, and heroic or merely human figures re- place the gods in it; the single exception is the temple of Apollo at Delphi. This development throughout reveals a change in religious thought which parallels the change in the conception of the pedimental com- position. (W.K.P.) PYTHAGORAS. -In the first issue of the JdI to appear since the war (Vol. lix/lx, 1944/45; published in Feb., 1948, pp. 1-44). Ludwig Curtius in a leading article has reexamined the ascription of sculptures to Pythagoras and from his new grouping has presented a critical and interpretative analysis of the sculptor's work. The study is illustrated with excellent plates (mostly from new photographs) which further support the author's contention that Greek sculpture should be displayed and studied not fiat against museum walls and under artificial lighting but where the figures may be viewed at all angles and if possible in the natu- ral light of the out-of-doors. The author begins with a description of a head from the Museo Chiamonti in the Vatican (No. 388 A) which he believes to repre- sent the work of Pythagoras and which he calls an "Apollo," although hitherto identified as a female head in the style of the peplos figures as represented by the Mariani statue from Candia. A head which was in the possession of a Roman art dealer in 1934 is shown notably by the execution of the hair to be a copy of the Chiaramonti head. The Pythagorean group is further illustrated by the Ludovisi Discobolos herm (Museo Nationale in Rome) and a Discobolos head from the Galleria Geographica in the Vatican. Chiefly on the basis of the former statue, a torso in Rome (Museo Nationale, No. 414), and the Boboli athlete in Florence, the author is able to develop an exhaustive interpretation of the anatomical proportions and rendition of musculature which he considers charac- teristic of the sculpture of Pythagoras. The reclining figure of Kladios alone of the pedimental sculptures from the temple of Zeus at Olympia he would associ- ate with the Pythagorean group; he rejects the ascrip- tion of the Valentine torso, copies of an Apollo on coins from Croton, and certain gems with representa- tions of Philoctetus which have been described as copies of a work of Pythagoras. (M.I.W.)</page><page sequence="3">202 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY CoINs AND GREEK STATUES. -L. Lacroix in BCH, lxx (1946) pp. 288-298, offers observations on this subject, of which he hopes later to make a complete study. In many cases coins aid in the reconstruction or identification of fragmentary statues. (W.K.P.) Vases WHAT IS PROTOGEOMETRIC? -In BSA, xliii (1948), pp. 160-172, V. R. Desborough discusses the Proto- geometric style, for it is a style, not a period. It has geometry as the essence of its decoration, differing from the Geometric style proper in its treatment of the decoration (H.N.F.) TRAVEL AND REPOSE. -H. Metzger in BCH, lxx (1946), pp. 374-384, explores the themes of travel and repose in fourth century Attic red-figured pot- tery. (W.K.P.) CYPRUs.-F. Mayence in BCH, lxx (1946), pp. 369-373, publishes a Cypriote vase in the Archaeologi- cal Museum of the University of Louvain. It is an oenochoe with an elongated, almost cylindrical body; the mouth is painted to represent a human face, with eyes, nose, and mouth. Its shape, technique, and dec- oration indicate a date between the eighth and sixth centuries B.c. (W.K.P.) Inscriptions INSCRIPTIONES GRAECAE, V, 1. -In BSA, xliii, (1948), pp. 209-259, A. M. Woodward contributes "some afterthoughts" concerning Spartan inscrip- tions, mainly of the Imperial age, published in IG, v, 1, and in BSA, xxvi-xxx. (H.N.F.) THE STRAIGHT IOTA IN CORINTHIAN EPICHORIC INSCRIPTIONS. -In BSA, xliii (1948), pp. 201-208, L. H. Jeffrey examines the use of the straight iota in Corinthian epichoric inscriptions. He finds that the crooked iota was still in use in the last decade of the sixth century and the straight form was established by ca. 475 B.C. (H.N.F.) DELPHI. -J. Bousquet in BCH, lxx (1946), pp. 32- 41, brings together eight fragments of a stele con- taining proxeny decrees of the third century B.C. (W.K.P.) Miscellaneous TRIPODS FROM THRSOS. -C. H. Emelie Haspels in BCH, Ixx (1946), pp. 2833-37, publishes two terra cotta tripods, found near the Odeion at Thasos. Each consists of three panels engraved with fantastic animal figures, separated by openwork tripods. (W.K.P.). TURKEY BIBLIOGRAPHY. - Tirkiyenin Arkeoloji, Epigraft ye Tarihi Cografyasi Iin Bibliyografya (Bibliography for the Archaeology, Epigraphy and Historical Geography of Turkey), by Arif Muifid Mansel. Tirk Tarih Kurumu Yayinlarndan (Publications of the Turkish Historical Society) xii. Seri-No. 1. Pp. xvi +616. Ankara, 1948. Dr. Mansel's bibliographical compilation constitutes an important and valuable work of reference. Although written in Turkish and primarily for Turks, it presents many thousands of titles in their original languages' and is therefore useful to the whole scholarly world. Particularly welcome are the notices of Turkish archaeological studies, many of which are basic and indispensable, but not always widely enough known in western Europe and America. Enterprising members of the Turkish Historical Society like Dr. Mansel, by their excavations and other researches, have in a few years earned our grati- tude and admiration. At the same time they have presented students of Anatolica with a new obliga- tion -that of acquiring at least a working knowledge of the modern Turkish language.2 As a first step, we may begin to use the present publication as an auth- ority for the spelling of Turkish names. To be sure, Turkish spelling in the modern alphabet is not yet perfectly standardized; but there is now no possible excuse for books in English to display monstrosities like Sendschirli for Zincirli or Tschanakkalessi for Canakkale, second-hand designations that were once considered our only refuge from the Arabic script. Bibliography is classified in the present work under twelve main headings: I, works of general information which deal chiefly with Greece and the East but have also a bearing on lands that are now Turkish; II, General Works on Anatolia; III, miscellaneous special works on Anatolia; IV, Greek and Roman inscrip- tions; V, archaeological maps of Anatolia; VI, a topographical bibliography by districts, cities, vil- lages, mountains, rivers, etc.; VII, Istanbul; VIII, the environs of Istanbul; IX, Thrace (Turkey in Europe); X, museums and other collections in Turkey; XI, publications of archaeological and other scientific societies; XII, additions and corrections. Finally there are indexes of geographical names and of authors and publishers. Books and articles are listed chronologically by date of issue, from the sixteenth century down to 1939 (references to ancient literature are not included). In Chapter VI (pp. 77-434) the chronological arrange- ment is maintained within the sections on the various 1 Chiefly English, French, German, Greek and Italian; titles in Russian, Polish, Czechish, Hungarian and Rumanian are translated into Turkish. 2 H. C. Hony's excellent Turkish-English Dictionary, pub- lished by the Clarendon Press in 1947, will greatly facilitate the work of Anglo-Saxons.</page><page sequence="4">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 203 places, which themselves are in alphabetical sequence from Agana to Zizima; and a similar alphabetical subdivision is employed in Chapter VIII (pp. 500- 529). When different authors have referred to the same place by different names we find entries under each: for example, one page of bibliography on Izmir and five on Smyrna, two on Konya and one on Ikonion. A number of helpful cross-references are included in cases like these, but still further cross-indexing might have been valuable; Aeolian Larisa, for instance, is listed under L, with the present name Buruncuk in parentheses, but there is no reference to it under B. The compiler was aware of this difficulty, and in gen- eral minimized the references to small villages, whose names are subject to change. In the selection of material for inclusion in the bibliography Dr. Mansel was obliged by the war to rely chiefly upon the libraries available in Turkey. In the preface, signed in 1944 (four years before publica- tion), he describes the origin and scope of the compila- tion and expresses a hope that supplements may be issued at intervals of about ten years. In general the work appears to reflect propor- tionately the number of books and articles that have been written on the various topics, greater and smaller. Antiquity receives most attention, but the Middle Ages are not neglected, twenty pages being devoted to the churches of Istanbul. Classical antiquity, furthermore, is by no means slighted in favor of the more specially Anatolian cultures. Under Bogazkoy we find five pages of entries, under Kiiltepe only one; whereas Ephesos has fourteen, Pergamon eighteen, and Troia twenty-one. No bibliographical compilation will appear perfect to all, if indeed to any, who use it. Some articles on (e.g.) the Hittites, that are listed in Chapter I, might perhaps better appear in Chapter II, as might also some accounts of travels which are included in Chapter VIII because they mention Constantinople. By and large, however, the system, which is modelled after that of Mau's catalogue of the library of the German Institute in Rome, is orderly and usable. Misprints and typographical inconsistencies can be found, but these are all but inevitable in a book containing quota- tions from many languages. In general the editing is accurate and the printing admirably clear. Sincere thanks and hearty congratulations to Dr. Mansel for his valuable contribution to scholarship. (J.L.C.) ARCHEOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES IN ANATOLIA. - Cur- rent reports on excavations on Turkish territory used to reach us late and in a form which is not accessible to everybody. Mrs. Hialet Qambel's report in Orientalia xvii (1948), pp. 255-261 is therefore highly welcome. Drawing on preliminary reports and personal com- munications she deals with undertakings in Alaca HyiyUk, Elbistan, Karatepe, Tarsus, Mersin and Agana. (A.G.) PREHISTORIC CEMETERY NEAR BABAKiY. -In AOF, xiii (1939), pp. 1-28, Kurt Bittel presents the results of his examination of a prehistoric cemetery near Baba- kBiy in Western Anatolia. Finds from there had been offered on the market; Bittel arrived in time to find at least one tomb intact. It is a pithos tomb apparently used twice within a short period of time. The pottery and the other meager finds that could be salvaged at- tribute the cemetery to the Yortan civilization which was contemporaneous with Troy I and the earlier part of Troy II. In this civilization the dead were buried outside the settlement, not within it as in Central Anatolia. (A.G.) THE HITTITE MUSEUM IN ANKARA.-The Direc- torate of Antiquities of the Turkish Government has united all surviving Hittite sculptures in Ankara where they have been assembled in the so-called Bedestan, an old market which has been restored for this purpose. Professor GUterbock, the Hittitologist of the University of Ankara has closely cooperated with the museum authorities in the task and helped to rebuild in the large hall of the Bedestan the monu- ments in their proper context. It is now possible to view there the long sequences of reliefs from Karke- mish, the sculptured gate from Sakce Gozu, the front from Alaca Hytiuk, the Lion gate from Malatya, and a large number of isolated pieces. A report on the Bedestan is found in AOF, xiii (1941), pp. 345-348; it has been superseded in the meantime by the official guide-book Ankara Bedesteninde bulunan Eti Miizesi biiyiik salonun kilavuzu (Guide to the Hittite Museum in the Bedestan at Ankara) (Istanbul, 1946) which was written jointly by H. G. Giiterbock and Nimet Ozgii. (A.G.) CYLINDER SEALS FROM ANATOLIA. -For questions of chronology synchronisms with areas where the sequence of cultural developments is well known are all important. In the light of Mesopotamian archae- ology K. Bittel discusses in AOF, xiii (1941), pp. 299-307 the few seal cylinders which have been found in Anatolia -one from Troy, one from Aligar, one from Alaca Hdiyuik, three from Ktiltepe. They confirm the existence of relations between Mesopotamia and Anatolia in the Jamdat Nasr period (ca. 3000 B.c.) and during the Akkad period (ca. 2400 B.c.). They do not help yet in dating Anatolian layers more precisely. (A.G.) CULT STANDARDS FROM ALACA HdYuK. -Among recent finds on Anatolian soil the Copper Age tombs of Alaca Hiyuk (ca. 2200 B.c.) are no doubt the most significant both by their richness and the perspectives they open to the archaeologist. Among their inven-</page><page sequence="5">204 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY tories the "cult standards" - bronze disks adorned in geometric patterns and showing in part bulls and stags -are particularly noteworthy. In AOF, xiii (1941), pp. 289-298 F. Hancar expresses the view that both these animals represent the "Great Mother." [The argumentation is not convincing. Comparable Mesopotamian monuments establish merely parallels. It would be more pertinent to investigate the religious significance of the bull and the stag in Anatolia.] (A.G.) TERRA COTTAS.--Alfred Laumonier in BCH, lxx (1946), pp. 312-318, publishes a group of twenty-two terra cottas in his own collection, purchased at Izmir, and possibly from the ancient factory at Smyrna; they show similarities to the Gaudin collection in the Louvre, of undoubted Smyrniote origin. The group includes various known types, most importantly, a number of grotesque heads, some realistic, some pathological. Laumonier appends a paragraph on the possible usage and origin of these latter, suggesting that they may have been modelled from life by stu- dents in the famous medical school that existed in Smyrna in the first century B.C. (W.K.P.) SYRIA GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS. -The Directorate- General of Antiquities of Syria has published an English translation (by Mesdames E. Will and D. Schlumberger) of the guide-book to Palmyra, "The Bride of the Desert," by Jean Starcky and Salahud'din Munajjed (Damascus, 1948). SYRIA BETWEEN 950 AND 720 B.C. -In AOF, xiv (1942), pp. 153-172 A. Jepsen discusses the relations between Israel and Damascus in the light of Near Eastern history. In the period considered the history of Syria and Palestine consists of continuous fighting between the national states that existed there- "Hittite" in the north, Hebrew in the south- the infiltrating Arameans and the Assyrians who then expanded toward the Mediterranean. Damascus plays a leading part in this fighting. [The period on which the finds of ancient inscriptions at Karatepe promise to throw new light has recently been the subject of two other treatments, one by K. Elliger in Festschrift Otto Eissfeldt (1947), 69-108, the other by B. Landsberger in his monograph Sam'al (1948).] (A.G.) EGYPT PROPORTIONS OF EGYPTIAN STATUES.--According to H. Senk, AOF, xiii, (1940), pp. 135-144 Egyptian statues show a definite regularity in their proportions. If one takes the head (from top to shoulder), as the determining unit, it more or less equals the distances from shoulder to waist, from waist to hip, from hip to knee, and from knee to ankle. (A.G.) EGYPTIAN TEMPLE STATUES. -Egyptian ideas con- cerning the relationship of god and man underwent a deep change in the New Empire. E. Otto, in Orien- talia, xvii, (1948), pp. 448-466, makes use of the temple statues of the New Empire and their inscriptions to demonstrate it. The inscriptions imply that the man whom they represent promises to protect the god and expects the god's protection in turn. He is represented as carrying his gods on his hands. Man's personality has become sanctified to such a degree that he can take part in the divine while still alive in this world. (A.G.) SCARAB OF AMENHOTEP III. -To the New King- dom scarabs with the picture of a pharaoh defeating his enemy D. Opitz in AOF, xiii (1939), pp. 55-58 adds an early example with an inscription of Amenhotep III. (A.G.) IRAQ RELIGIOUS RITES IN THE URUK PERIOD OF MESO- POTAMIA.--Against the view that before the Early Dynastic period worship in Mesopotamia was aniconic Mrs. E. Douglas Van Buren points in AOF, xiii (1939), pp. 32-45 to the scenes depicted on Uruk seals and other monuments of the period. They testify not only to the existence of a developed ritual but also to the worship of several well-defined deities conceived in anthropomorphic form. There are in particular a Mother-goddess and her bridegroom, gods who in different places bear different names. (A.G.) THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE PREHISTORIC PERIODS IN MESOPOTAMIA. -Since the discoveries at Mari Mesopotamian chronology has undergone a sub- stantial lowering. This cannot be without consequences for the chronology of the prehistoric periods. By investigating the sequences observed at the main sites and by rejecting the occurrence of 'Ubaid pottery as chronological clue F. Wachtsmuth (AOF, xiii (1940), pp. 194-203) arrives at the conclusion that the so- called Uruk and Jamdat Nasr periods, and even part of the Halaf period, fall within the first half of the third millennium. [A shortening of the early chronology was indicated; but this one seems to be excessive.] (A.G.) THE SEVEN DOTS ON MESOPOTAMIAN SEAL CYLIN- DERS. -The view is customarily maintained that the seven dots found often on Mesopotamian monuments and particularly on seal cylinders -we are provided with an exhaustive and lengthy list of the occurrences -are symbols of the Pleiades, a constellation to which astrology ascribed an unfavorable influence on man- kind. In AOF, xiii (1941), pp. 277-289 Mrs. E. Douglas van Buren argues that this is due to relatively late associations. Originally the seven dots represented</page><page sequence="6">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIGEST 205 the stones used in casting lots; this means of determin- ing man's fate was late placed or refound in the sky. (A.G.) EARLY SUMERIAN SCULPTURES.--A Swiss collector acquired from a Paris dealer six rather crude small sculptures which E. Borowski publishes in Orientalia, xvi (1947), pp. 481-490, plates XXXV-XLIII under the label "early Sumerian." According to the author they represent masterpieces of previously unknown types and style. Before pronouncing oneself on the pieces one should like to see something of the kind recovered in actual excavations. Otherwise one runs the risk to consider something as unique that in reality is a fake. (A.G.) THE AKKAD DYNASTY AND EGYPT.--A. Ungnad devotes a short note in AOF, xiv (1942), pp. 199 ff. to the possibility of an armed clash between Narim- Sin of Akkad (23rd cent. B.C.) and Egypt. The Akkad king records a victory over Manium of Makkan; alabaster vases marked as booty from Makkan look exactly like Egyptian pieces of the 5th or 6th dynasty. Manium must not be identified with Menes, but he may well have been one of the last kings of the Old Egyptian Empire. (A.G.) GATE KEEPERS ON MESOPOTAMIAN SEALS OF THE AKKAD PERIOD. -In the opinion of Mrs. E. Douglas Van Buren who published an article on this subject in Orientalia, xvi (1947), pp. 312-32 (with an additional note ibid., pp. 477-80) the minor gods who watch the gate of certain gods on either side are twins, Akk. talimft. She lists six such pairs. Lugal-girra and Mes- lamta-ea, Lf-lM and Latarak, Dumuzi and Nin- gizzidda, Kettu and Mi'aru, Girru and Nusku, Gil- gamei and Enkidu. An attempt is made at identifying the guardians found on seals of the Akkad period with these pairs. [Comment. The combination which the authoress makes of the three concepts guardian, twin, and talimu is arbitrary. Only the two first pairs mentioned are known to be twins, only the third pair to be door keepers; and talimu does not mean "twin."] (A.G.) THE HORNED CROWN OF A BABYLONIAN GOD. - Mesopotamian gods are recognizable by a horned crown which they wear. Such a crown, made of bronze, greatest diameter 15 cm. - either an exvoto or part of a statue -forms part of the collection of Dr. R. Schmidt in Solothurn (Switzerland) and is published by E. Borowski in Orientalia, xvii (1948), pp. 9294-298 (with plates 25-928). (A.G.) THE ASSYRO-BABYLONIAN GOD NUSKu.-The god has previously been explained as the embodiment of the lunar crescent. Drs. Hildegard and Julius Lewy ar- gue in Orientalia, xvii (1948), pp. 146-159 in favor of a new interpretation which sees in Nusku the planet Mercury in his role as either the morning or the eve- ning star, his counterpart being Bilgi. The "bright staff" which Nusku and also Nabf -later identified with Mercury in its double role -hold is the zodiacal light. His epithet mar seld&amp;si bumbuli means "son of the 30th (day) of (Mercury's) absence." The name Nusku may be of West Semitic origin and since it interchanges with Nashu, Nasuh, a fact which points to derivation from nsh; its original meaning may be "absence" or "absent." (A.G.) HORSE-BITS FROM MESOPOTAMIA. -Among the numerous cultural changes which characterize the second millennium B.C. in the Near East the introduc- tion of the light chariot drawn by horses is of particular importance. To further its clarification H. A. Potratz studies in AOF, xiv (1941), pp. 1-39 the horse-bits that have come down to us. He distinguishes two groups. The first -straight Knebel and composite mouth-piece -is dated to the second half of the second millennium and connected with the ethnic movements that brought the horse into Mesopo- tamia and Egypt at that time. The second -circular Knebel and straight mouth-piece or mouth-piece halved and each half rigidly connected with its Knebel -is already used contemporaneously with the first, but becomes more usual between 800 and 500 B.C.; comparative material is spread over all the territory between the Caucasus in the east and Hungary in the west. [In the historical concepts of the author the Kassites play a role which seems not justi- fied by the information to be gathered from the available sources.] (A.G.) FRAGMENT OF A STONE LID FROM THE TIME OF TUKULTI-NINURTA I OF AssUR. -D. Opitz discusses in AOF, xiii (1940), pp. 219-225 a fragment (about a quarter) of a circular lid which was excavated in Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta and has been first published by W. Andrae. It is important because of the relief with which it is adorned, the more so as little is known about early Assyrian sculpture. The upper register shows a hero defeating an enemy and corpses filling the available space; of a middle register only the upper part of a man, the heads of a team of horses and parts of the head of the man who rides on the chariot are preserved. (A.G.) ASSYRIAN RELIEFS. -When after the end of the war the treasures of the Vatican Museum were taken out of their hide-outs three fragments of Assyrian reliefs came to light which had been stored away since 1855. They are published by A. Pohl in Orientalia, xvi (1947), pp. 459-463, plates XXIX-xxxIII. They came from Nineveh and seem to belong to the time of Assurbanipal. With them go two fragments of in- scriptions on alabaster, one of them demonstrably from Nimrud (Kalakh). (A.G.)</page><page sequence="7">206 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY THE PREPARATION OF PERFUMES IN ASSYRIA. - Texts from the German excavations in Assur dealing with this subject are published by E. Ebeling in Orientalia, xvii (1948), on 49 pages of autographs. Their philological treatment -including that of similar texts previously presented -is simultaneously begun (pp. 129-145, 299-313). (A.G.) IRAN PERSIAN STANDARDS. -A pair of roughly circular bronze "standards" -one in Berlin, the other in Paris, both known for more than 40 years -is re-examined by F. Sarre in AOF, xiv (1942), pp. 195-199 in the light of the numerous Luristan bronzes which have since then come to light. The author claims the standards as Persian and dates them with some re- serve before 1000 B.C. The view is expressed that the four demons in Knielauf arranged in the center of the pieces in some kind of a swastika and the bulls sup- porting the circular part establish a connection with the cult of the sun. (A.G.) PAINTED POTTERY FROM TRANSCAUCASIA. -Trans- caucasia is a territory which is of great potential interest to the archaeologist of Anatolia as well as of Mesopotamia. It is regrettable that our knowledge of it is so meager. The more gratifying is the presenta- tion, based on Russian sources, which F. HanZar gives in AOF, xiv (1944), pp. 284-298; it unites the avail- able information on the painted pottery of the region. It is not yet sufficient for a comprehensive picture, but it assures the existence of interrelations. It holds out the hope that we shall obtain knowledge of the cul- tural sequences of Transcaucasia in the near future and thus be enabled to approach the larger problems with better expectations for success. (A.G.) ITALY SCULPTURE. -In the JdI, lix/lx (1944/45), pp. 45-68, Paul v. Blankenhagen publishes a colossal head from the Palazzo dei Conservatori (Rome) which he identifies as a fifth century portrait of Trajan. Several of the later Roman emperors regarded Augus- tus and Trajan as most exemplary of beneficent rule and their physical characteristics were frequently reproduced in imperial portraiture. The dating of these later portraits is to be determined primarily upon stylistic grounds. The head from the Conservatori bears close resemblance in the rendering of hair and eyes to the heads in Aquileia and a head of the em- peror Eugenius from the second quarter of the fifth century. The author places it among the imperial portraits belonging to the end of reign of Honorius or the beginning of that of Valentinian III, both of whom claimed descent from Trajan through Theodosius. The portrait is one of the last extant examples of a classical revival in art which had begun under Theo- dosius. (M.I.W.) SPAIN CAVE PAINTINGS. -In the north of Spain, the Basque country, the land is honeycombed with caves containing pre-historic works of art. Jose Miguel de Barandaran in "Las Cavernas Prehistoricas en la Mitologia Vasca," published in Cuadernos de His- toria Primitiva (1946), 2, pp. 71-89, reports on the findings of twelve of the caves which have been ex- cavated. There are paintings and engravings of bulls, horses, birds, goats and serpents. They represent in that pre-historic phase as they do today, ideas and popular superstitions which the Basques call "oi." There are also included figures part human and part animal "mari," figures human with bird-like claws "maide." The writer quotes a series of legends he found still in use in this area. They reflect the same figures, the same legends as those used by paleolithic man. This does not necessarily mean that the Basques are direct descendents of Paleolithic man, but the idea deserves consideration. (M.B.) VISIGOTHIC CEMETERY. -Joachim Werner, ibid., (1946), 1, pp. 46-50, reports on the excavation of 1941 in the extensive Visigothic cemetery of Castiltierra. (M.B.) NEOLITHIC AGE.--In ibid., pp. 5-33, San Valero Aparisi presents evidence relative to the arrival of the Neolithic Age in the Hispanic Peninsula. He main- tains that this was something more than an industrial phase and presents the following evidence: a. A change in the appearance of the landscape. b. A change in the human type. c. A new economy to support an increased popula- tion. d. A change in tools motivated by new needs. e. A displacement of social forces, the herdsmen and agriculturists becoming superior to the hunter. f. A change of foods brought about by the invention of bread and the utilization of milk. g. A displacement of spiritual forces. The earliest date given this new culture places the Age in the Valleys of Mesopotamia and the Nile about the year 5200 B.C. Two branches were diffused west- ward, one into the Danubian area and the other through North Africa. The writer presents detailed evidence as shown in work patterns, herding, agricul- ture, ceramics, arms and megalithic monuments to prove that the Neolithic which arrived in the Hispanic Peninsula around 2500 B.c. followed the North African route. The new culture found fertile fields and spread north to the banks of the Rhine. (M.B.) U.S.S.R. CRIMEA. -P.

This Scythian town was protected by a cliff on the east, a deep ravine on the west and by a defensive wall on the south. In the residential section a large building (ca. third century B.C.) was found with a cellar cut into the cliff; nearby were grain pits. The tiled roof of red, yellow and green plaster and polished brown clay indicates the decorations of an elaborate Scythian house. Trade contacts were indicated by fragmentary Greek amphorae from Rhodes and Cnidus. Here were also found coarse and polished Scythian ware and carved bone ornaments of Greek design but em- bellished with stylistic elements from their local wood-carving. Excavations near the southern sector of the defense wall (8.4 m. thick) revealed that it was constructed of large boulders reinforced by stone facings. Five grain pits were hewn into the rock near this wall and nearby were hearths with pottery vessels for baking flat cakes. Heaps of round pebbles were probably used as sling-shots. A square mausoleum of polished stone contained royal Scythian graves. This building (second century B.C.) originally had a roof of wooden beams, probably brick-covered. A door led to the eastern wall and a stone staircase led to the top of the wall. In the northwest corner stood a half-sunk sepulcher cut into the rock. Here lay a Scythian king a tergo with his head facing west, his left arm extended and his right flexed. Three gold-tipped spearheads and a sword with a silver hilt lay at his feet. Another sword, a helmet, and bronze ornaments were on the right side. Bronze buckles, from which hung a combined bow case and quiver covered with gold plate, were ornamented with a serpent and a swan in evolved naturalistic style. His clothing was stitched with golden thread and covered with gold leaf decorations. Seven hundred Greek and Scythian articles of gold were found. Three round plates depicting the sun god were sewn onto the cap. The coat was bordered with golden stars, bees, petals, drops and stylized waves. Among special objects were cordate ornaments, round shields and lions' heads with inlaid paste eyes and in their mouths golden chains with round pen- dents. The king's arms and legs were entwined with golden coils. Hundreds of tubular gold beads were sewn into the shroud now disappeared. In the center of the mausoleum was a gilded and carved wooden sarcophagus painted pink and blue. Although crushed by the fallen roof, reconstruction showed the rectangular sarcophagus to have been covered with garlands of laurel and acanthus leaves tied with rosettes and ribbons carved on the sides with legs shaped like sphinxes and griffins. Gilded columns once supported the canopy, superimposed by a cen- taur and a lion. This queen's sarcophagus of the first century B.c. had unfortunately been pillaged in antiquity. However, some objects were salvaged; these included a massive ring of twisted gold with two stones inset, a golden medallion with an image of the sun, a gold needle and earrings. Four horses had been buried between these two tombs. Large colored paste beads adorned the fore- head of one of the horses. These graves had also been looted. In addition, seventy human skeletons were ar- ranged in tiers of wooden chests, some containing the entire family. Felt, reed mats or animal skins lined some of these coffins. The oldest graves, attributed to the second and first centuries B.C., lay on the floor above a thick stratum of stone flakes. The majority, of these skeletons lay a tergo, legs extended, or rarely crossed. One arm was usually folded across the chest. Children's skeletons were often turned on the side. Near the head were placed wine and perfume vessels and the bones of sacrificed animals. Among the more important vessels was a black polished censer with an engraved image of the sun. In addition to weapons, bronze bits, polished bronze mirrors there were beads, necklaces, and pendents of sard, jet, chalcedony, amber, amethyst, rock crystal, Egyptian paste and Phoenician glass. There were 1,327 golden objects found in the mausoleum. The second important discovery was that of five painted vaults in the necropolis where twenty-eight rock-cut tombs were excavated. Vault No. 9 was decorated by a master artist. A colored border of triangles and zigzags around the top of the walls resembled an embroidered canopy. Opposite the en- trance on the left was painted a square rug with nine checks framed with arrows. Beside this stands a bearded Scythian, a coat over his shoulders, and hold- ing a lyre. In the center is a mounted hunter with a spear in his right hand. On the right a red and a black dog are attacking a wounded boar. These decorations still retain traditions of the nomad tent. At the same time the snow-white walls, niches and decorations suggest a Ukrainian cottage. Here at Neapolis evolved artistic achievements resulting from culture- contacts with the north, east and Mediterranean area. (H.F.) CENTRAL ASIA. -S. Rudenko found recently at Pazyryk Kurgan in the Altai Mountains a mummified body tattooed with wild animals. Within this tomb was a chariot, leather carpets with embroidered animal figures, wooden diadems covered with thin golden laminae, bronze mirrors, carved furniture, jewelry and furs. Previously, Rudenko had found a mummified woman nearby; her long fingers and the number of stringed instruments in the tomb indicate that she was a talented musician.

CENTRAL AMERICA SANTA LUCIA COTZUMALHUAPA. -J. Eric S. Thomp- son in An Archaeological Reconnsissance in the Cot- zumalhuapa Region, Esquintla, Guatemala, Contri- butions to American Anthropology and History, ix, No. 44, Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1948, has supplied us with a much needed review and dis- cussion of this perplexing and highly important archaeological zone of the Pacific Coastal Region of Guatemala. All of the stone sculptures are illustrated in excellent photographic plates and a detailed analy- sis of the Cotzumalhuapa style is given. Brief strati- graphic excavations are reported with an analysis of the pottery, artifacts, and all available information on architecture. A full discussion of the early historical sources on the distribution of peoples and languages - especially of the Pipil, leads Dr. Thompson to the tentative conclusion that these Nahuat-speaking people were responsible for the Cotzumalhuapan re- mains. The principal period of occupation and of sculptural activity is shown to have probably been during the last half of the Classic Period. The dominat- ing influence is clearly from Mexico, and Dr. Thomp- son suggests that some unknown center in southern Mexico may have been its point of origin. (G.F.E.) PLUMBATE POTTERY. -In Plumbate, A Mesoameri- can Trade Ware, by Anna O. Shepard, Publication 573, Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1948 we have the most complete and detailed analysis to date of a single Mesoamerican ware. It is a pottery type of excep- tional interest and importance for its unique glazed surface and for its wide distribution in trade through- out most of the Mesoamerican area -making it of especial value in the cross correlation of cultures. Miss Shepard's study is one not only of technological analysis, in which field she has made the most signifi- cant contributions to American archaeology. Here she describes and discusses all known examples of the ware from the various "archaeological" points of view as well, such as form, decoration, distribution, and chronological position, but maintaining the high standards of scientific precision characteristic of her technical work. It is a highly important monograph, certainly the most complete pottery study of its kind we have for the entire American field. (G.F.E.) HIGHLAND GUATEMALA. -The excavation of the site of Kaminaljuyu in the suburbs of Guatemala City has been of exceptional importance in the development of Mesoamerican archaeology, for it has provided the first clear demonstration of the contemporaneity of the first half of the Classic or Old Empire period of the Maya and the fully developed Teotihuacan culture of central Mexico. The complete report appears in Excavations at Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala by Alfred V. Kidder, Jesse D. Jennings, and Edwin M. Shook, Publication 561, Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1946. The excavations detailed here were made in only two of the many mounds of the site, but both of them contained a number of tombs richly stocked with elaborately decorated pottery, jade objects, mosaics, etc. These materials are analyzed in ex- haustive detail and profusely illustrated in black and white and color plates. Included in the introduction and final discussion is the best general review of Mesoamerican prehistory available at the present time. (G.F.E.) FORTIFICATIONS. -Pedro Armillas in Fortelezas Mexicanas, Cuadernos Americanos, vol. 5, Sept.-Oct., 1948, pp. 143-163, discusses the previously unexplored situation in regard to the presence and significance of fortresses in Mesoamerica. He points out that the construction of defenses or the use of defensible posi- tions for centers of population is a feature limited almost exclusively to what he calls the Historic Period. (The Tula-Toltec, Aztec Periods in Central Mexico and the Mexican and later periods in the Maya area.) This is in marked contrast to the apparently peaceful aspect of the previous Classic Period and would seem to indicate quite different socio-economic conditions. It is a provocative essay in line with the present trend toward an attempt to analyze the basic social history of the native American civilizations. (G.F.E.) SMOKING PIPES OF MEXICO. -Pipas Precortesianas by Muriel N. Porter, Acta Antropologica, vol. iii, no. 2, Mexico, 1948, is an excellent detailed study of the classification and distribution of smoking pipes in the New World, with especial emphasis on those of Mexico. It is shown that pipes are limited to only certain areas of Mexico and to a relatively late period in the known cultural sequence. A generously proportioned English summary of the text is given and there is an introduction by Chita de la Calle which includes considerable data on the various uses of tobacco by the Aztec. Acta Antropologica is issued by the students of the National School of Anthropology of Mexico, and is devoted to the publication of theses presented for degrees in the School.
