It is surprising to see the synesthesic effect it has when you utter it. People's facial expres sions are transformed, their eyes shine. You can al most hear them salivate, and the desire to eat some is almost overwhelming. The urge is even greater when you're in a cold or hostile environment: walking through the woods in winter or down a snow-cov ered street. Fortunately, nowadays it is widely avail able, and always provides a special kind of pleasure, sometimes even relief. This fascination with choco late led to Artes de México's two previous issues on the topic exploring its significance and value. They may have quenched our readers' thirst for discover ing the origin and culture behind this sumptuous gift of Mexico's to the world, but the topic of chocolate remains apparently inexhaustible: we never cease to discover new stories, legends, and secrets. This issue examines heretofore-unexplored as pects of the topic, and perhaps it will serve as a ref erence for those readers who have become chocolate enthusiasts. On this occasion we make great leaps forward and back through time. We have returned to the pre-Hispanic past because it continues to provide us with novel information on cacao. For instance, Sal vador Reyes Equiguas tells us how a group of Aztecs brought cacao beverage as a gift to the ancient inhab itants of Aztlan and to the goddess Coatlicue. These simple, peaceful ancestors of the Aztecs were unaware of the existence of cacao, a crop that was part of the new Mexica Empire's economy of war. On another front, anthropologist Anahí Luna discusses a finding made in Xochicalco of an imposing sculpture that she proposes to name the "Cacao-Man" for the vines bear ing cacao pods wrapped around its body. This statue opens the door to an enigmatic history that experts will surely be unraveling for some time to come. From Xochicalco we travel to eighteenth-century Guatemala where magic, ritual and faith healing were an essential part of everyday life. Martha Few relates how cacao potions were then prepared exclusively by women, and how this was sometimes enough for them to be taken directly to the Inquisition. The bev erage's flavor and dark color easily masked powders, herbs or even female body fluids, which were used to control or invigorate men's sex drives. In present-day western Guatemala, many peo ple and the Ch'orti' Maya in particular still perform agricultural rites involving the cacao beverage. In addition to this, Johanna Kufer, Nikolai Grube and Michael Heinrich also examine cacao's medicinal properties and its uses among the Ladinos of the same region. We then explore the links established because of cacao between America and Europe. Jorge Betanzos unearths references to chocolate from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. José Luis Trueba tells us about the rivalry between chocoholics and caffeine addicts in nineteenth-century Mexico: cacao repre sented conservatives, whereas liberals drank coffee. Today we might have to redefine this duality, because both addictions now indeed overlap. In certain parts of Europe, coffee is always served with a small piece of dark chocolate: a heavenly combination. The subsequent texts are "ramblings"—to quote Rafael Vargas, who wonders why nineteenth-century literature features so few situations or tropes related to cacao. Our last story concerns Guadalupe Loaeza's childhood memories and her habit of eating choco late daily (one she has yet to give up entirely). If this issue can be compared to anything, really, it would be a box of chocolates in which each piece has its own flavor and lore. The articles herein reveal facets of chocolate that had not been touched upon in our previous issues, and we hope our readers will enjoy the flavors they release. + Translated by Clara Marin.

He mentions that cacao was only imbibed by the upper classes, that it was called yollotli eztli, "the price of blood and heart," and any one who was not a priest or warrior caught drinking cacao would be put to death. Several Nahuatl myths refer to cacao as a discov ery of Quetzalcoatl when he ruled Tula, where there were abundant, colorful cacao trees called xochicaca hiatl. Quetzalcoatl, who lived a life dedicated to art, also had a refined palate and sense of taste. Quetzalcoatl's cultural reform in Tula could be said to have included various dietary and other changes for the Chichimecs who arrived in this Toltec city: quelite and mezquite plants were off the menu and ixtle garments no longer worn. According to the myth, the cacao found by Quet zalcoatl in Tula disappeared with him too. The conver sion of cacao into mezquite, which took place when Quetzalcoatl had to abandon Tula, referred to by Fray Bernardino de Sahagún's sources, tells of the advent of a new era: the splendor of Tula had ended, and the steady influx of Chichimecs imposed new life styles. The Mexica, hailing from Chichimec lands, ad opted the Toltec cultural models known as tolte cayotl—the mythical legacy of Quetzalcoatl—shared by all the tribes of Mexico's central highlands. By describing themselves as heirs to this tradition, they constructed a new image of themselves as cacao drinkers and wearers of cotton clothing. Adopting these cultural traits must have led to some crisis of conscience, as they were aware of their humble ori gins and their previous lack of precious goods. They were still dealing with this predicament at the time of Western contact: although they dominated large swathes of Mesoamerica, they were aware that their ancestors had suffered privations before founding the city that their god had promised them. Although they probably did not long to return to those days of hardship, humbleness certainly remained one of their moral virtues. The desire to resolve this conflict is expressed in a unique version of the myth of the search for Aztlan as told by Fray Diego Durán in his History of the Indies of New Spain. During the reign of Moctezuma I—the emperor who created laws on the use of cotton, pre cious stones, quetzal feathers, and cacao consump tion—the Mexica attempted to find Aztlan Chicomoz toc, the land of their forefathers, in order to send them riches and treasures. Moctezuma had received notice that Coatlicue, the mother of Huitzilopochtli, had re mained there and, apart from gifts, he wanted to give her news of her son and how his life had turned out as ruler of most of their known world. The warrior-priest Tlacaelel warned that the difficult mission of reaching Aztlan and finding Coatlicue could not be made by strong warriors, but only by witch doctors, magicians and shamans. So he set out to find the wisest magi cians of the time: he called upon the royal historian, Cuauhcoatl, who explained that Aztlan could be found surrounded by water, with a nearby hill called Culhua can, which had caves where their ancestors had lived. According to Durán, Aztlan means "whiteness," and Aztecs thus refers to "the people of the whiteness." It was a fertile place filled with various types of ducks, herons, crows, waterfowl and many species of fish. The ancient Aztecs also enjoyed the shade of the cypresses at the water's edge; canoes were used for transport and raised beds were used to sow corn, chilies, tomatoes, amaranth, beans and all kinds of seeds. We cannot know whether Aztlan was indeed as bounteous as Durán described it in this account. The important thing is that the Mexica imagined it as a paradise, but not a fantastical one, since the text does not mention the existence of cacao, cotton, or tree sized corn or amaranth. The Mexica had left Aztlan the plentiful. Cuauh coatl does not mention the reasons, but he does talk about the consequences: "after leaving that wonder ful place for firm ground, everything turned against them. The saw-toothed grass, the sharp stones, the fields full of thistles and thorn bushes: everything turned against them, so they would not be able to turn back, or know how to." Following the advice given by the royal historian, Moctezuma sent the magicians in search of Aztlan. He loaded them with cloths, precious stones, gold, jewelry, much cacao, teonacaztli (a yellow, pungent flower that was used to flavor the cacao drink), cot ton, vanilla pods, feathers of all kinds—in short, all the most precious treasures they had for Huitzilo pochtli's mother. The magicians left for Tula, where 74 Salvador Reyes Equiguas</page><page sequence="4">there was a hill called Coatepec. There they smeared their bodies with ointments that transformed them into many kinds of wild beasts and birds. They ar rived as animals at a large lake, in the middle of which stood the hill of Culhuacan. At the water's edge, they returned to their human form and upon seeing people fishing in canoes, they asked for help in reaching the hill. They addressed the fishermen in Nahuatl, and they understood them. The magi cians told them that they were Mexica, governed and sent by Moctezuma and Tlacaelel, and that they worshipped Huitzilopochtli, son of Coatlicue, whom they had come to find in Culhuacan. The fish ermen led the Mexica to the priest of the goddess Coatlicue. Showing great reverence and respect, the visitors approached the old priest, who said he did not know Moctezuma and Tlacaelel; he pointed out that the Mexica who had left Aztlan had different names, such as Ocelopan, Tenoch Cuauhtloquezqui and Axolohua. The magicians told him, "O lord, we confess that we have no knowledge of these men any more, nor have we seen them; memory of these people has been lost, because they have all now died. Though we once heard their names mentioned." The priest replied, "Oh, lord of all creation! Who killed them? Who are those living now?" He asked them if they had seen their god before coming, and if he had told them something, to which they replied no. The old priest then asked them when Huitzilo pochtli would return, because his mother was wait ing for him, and her sadness was so great that no one could comfort her. The magicians then loaded the gifts that they had brought onto their backs and followed behind the old priest, who began to climb up Culhuacan hill, which was covered in fine sand. The old priest climbed sprightly and weightlessly, while the magicians fol lowed with great difficulty because their feet sank into the sand. The old priest turned his head and saw that they could not climb any further because they were stuck up to their knees in the sand. The magi cians admired how the old man walked so quickly that he appeared not to touch the ground. The old priest told them: "What have you done, Mexica? What has made you so heavy? What do you eat in your lands?" They answered, "Lord, we eat the food that is grown there and we drink cacao." 75</page><page sequence="5">The priest said, "That food and drink, my chil dren, is so heavy that it prevents you from seeing the place your forefathers came from, and this has brought you death. And the riches that you bring, here we have no use for them, we only use plain, simple things. Give me your presents and stay here; I will call the lady, the mother of Huitzilopochtli, so she can come and see them." The old man put the gifts on his back with such ease that he seemed to be carrying straw. After he had reached the top of the hill with all the riches, an an cient woman, unimaginably ugly and dirty, appeared. Weeping bitterly, she told the magicians, who listened to her from down below, that she had not bathed or washed her face since her son Huitzilopochtli had left, and that she would not do so until he returned. They told her that Moctezuma and Tlacaelel had sent them to kiss her hands and to advise her that Moctezuma was the fifth ruler of the Mexica, governing a free and prosperous city, not like the former kings who suf fered hunger and poverty, and who had to pay tribute to other provinces. They boasted that all the other cit ies were under Mexica dominion and that mines had been discovered with gold, silver and precious stones. Therefore Moctezuma had sent these gifts, to show the riches that her son had acquired. The goddess then stifled her tears a little and thanked them for the news. She asked whether those who had left with Huitzilopochtli were still alive, and she was surprised to be told that they were not, be cause in Aztlan their contemporaries were still alive. The goddess asked if what they had brought was food, and the magicians replied that cacao was a drink that could also be eaten if mixed with other things. The goddess told them that this was what made them so heavy, the reason why they had been unable to climb up the hill to see her up close. Coatlicue asked them to tell her son about her fast and penitence and that he should take pity on her. She reminded the magi cians what Huitzilopochtli had told her when he left: "Mother of mine, I shall not be gone long, only as long as it takes to bring these seven groups of people to where they must settle [...] Once this is done, I shall turn back." The goddess had heard her son say that he would return after he had gone to war with all the provinces and placed them under his rule. However, as soon as he had conquered those lands, they were taken away from him again and he was vanquished. Coatlicue asked the magicians to take a cloak and a loincloth to her son so he would be reminded of her and return to her. The magicians listened to the old woman from below. She told them to stay and see how the people in Aztlan never grew old. She asked them to watch the priest, who was old at the top of the hill, but who would come back down to them as a young man. And indeed, the old priest became younger as he climbed down, and aged as he climbed up. This meant they could escape death. The priest returned to the subject of their harmful diet and told them: "Look at all the damage this cacao that you drink and this food that you eat have done to you; it has corrupted you and changed who you are. And as for these cloaks, feathers and riches that you brought with you and wear, they only bring you ruin." He then called for all kinds of ducks, geese, herons, fish, vegetables and flowers to be brought as gifts for Moctezuma and Tlacaelel, together with the cloak and the loincloth. They took the gifts and returned from whence they came, helped by the ointment that transformed them into animals. However, only a few made it back safely, because a third of them were eaten by other wild animals and birds of prey. In Mexico, they immediate ly appeared before Moctezuma, presenting him with the gifts and telling him of their journey. They spoke of how Huitzilopochtli's mother had complained about waiting for her son, how the old man had become 76</page><page sequence="6">young again, and how those that their own ancestors had left behind there were still alive. They also told him how they had been unable to climb up Culhuacan because of their heavy, un healthy diets, due to the cacao and fruits that were grown in Mexico. Upon being reminded of their fore fathers and their desire to return to their homeland, Moctezuma and Tlacaelel wept. They sent everyone to rest and ordered the cloak and the loincloth to be taken to the temple, to deliver the message sent to Huitzilopochtli by his mother. This lengthy account is vitally important to ex plain the conflict the Mexica faced once they became undisputed rulers of the entire Anahuac region and many other lands. If we follow the story closely, we can find various elements that provide a basis for the state ments about the Mexica's humble origins, the sacred ness of this humility, and the transformation of their way of life, especially their diet. In Aztlan, the Mexica had everything they needed to survive. Cuauhcoatl describes the agriculture of Aztlan as "raised beds where they grew corn, chilies, tomatoes, amaranth, beans and all the kinds of seeds" they had brought to Anahuac. They possessed the gen erous resources provided by an agricultural society, all the basic foodstuffs, but they lacked cacao. Apart from agricultural products, the Mexica in Aztlan en joyed all kinds of food found in and around the water: fish, frogs, snakes, and waterfowl. In other words, the same things they found in Anahuac. We should note here that it seems that the riches of Aztlan were more like those of Tlalocan (the mythical kingdom ruled by Tlaloc) than those of the legendary Tula. The life of Aztlan's inhabitants, as described by Moctezumas magicians, was much like the daily life of the Mexica peasants and all the poor subjects dwelling along the rivers of the Anahuac region. This account would seem to contain a message targeted at the Mexica aristocrats to remind them of the peas ants who most resembled their ancestors, and who lived a humble life and satisfied their needs without luxuries or wastefulness. On departing from Aztlan, the Mexica lost their agricultural wealth but found the riches of Toltec refinement, which included a taste for cacao, the pleasure of cotton and the beauty of quetzal feath ers. They also found death: they went from being fishermen and farmers to becoming warriors, and they began to harvest hearts instead of corncobs. The Aztecs who received Moctezumas envoys be lieved that the latter had been corrupted by cacao and heavy foods, while they themselves stayed light on their feet by eating vegetables and products from their lake. In Aztlan they had not yet discovered the fine arts of cloth embroidered with precious stones, or gold and silverwork, established by the Toltecay otl. They could not ascribe any value to these things they did not know even existed. This is the crux of this story: the recollection of the humble origins of Huitzilopochtli and the Mexica. The pain at discov ering that their wealth was worthless to their ances tors, that they had built an artificial world in which their own god had betrayed his roots to the extent of even forgetting his mother, forced the Mexica to rediscover their humility. This explains why they ac cepted to re-clothe Huitzilopochtli with his maxtlatl or loincloth made of ixtle or agave fiber, since cotton (like cacao) were refinements of the new life style. All these symbolic contradictions are present in Mexica thought: a past that was humble yet rich in agriculture, and a present that was rich in sumptuous goods, with war maintaining the status quo; a humble tutelary god and an initially feeble solar god had be come the supreme rulers of the universe; a past with virtuous ancestors and a present tainted by a harsh social stratification whose legitimacy was nonethe less based on the same ancestors who had censured their ways when they had met again. Tlalocan had corn, amaranth, beans, chia seed, squash: the treasures of Tlaloc and his helpers, the tlaloques, who were responsible for distributing the rain. But in this paradise there was no cacao or cot ton, products that represented Quetzalcoatl's trea sure and cultural inheritance. Amaranth occupied a special place among the foodstuffs mentioned above because it symbolized humility. For the Nahua, am aranth was the food of fasting, a purifying food, a spiritual remedy, a magical cure against swellings, an offering for fire and a contrast to cacao, which meant wealth, power, delicacy. Each group of plants repre sented a different lifestyle: on the one hand, farmers, gatherers, fishermen and hunters, and on the other, warriors, artisans and merchants. Translated by Quentin Pope.

Within the sprawling expanse of tablelands, we can picture complex artistic crossovers as clandestine routes that lead us to prominent urban settlements of that era, such as Xochitecatl-Cacaxtla, Teote nango, La Quemada and Xochicalco. I suggest we pause at the outer limits of Cuauhnahuac, skirt around the fortified walls, and enter Xochicalco, a city-state that had its peak between the 700 and 900 CE thanks to its strategic position between the Pacific and the central highland area. The city's collapse came after a period of growing and tumultuous polarization. Since the nineteenth century, travel ers and scholars of the pre-Hispanic world have given us a new understanding of those days of upheav yt'* al, fires, looting and A -' abandonment. In 1992, archeologist Hortensia Novoa led explorations of the buildings located above the Large Plat form of the Acropolis that revealed a puz zle formed by ^ fragments of sculp tures, pots and human and animal bones that were the remains of larger pieces, which are now treasures of Mesoamerican art. The state of the artifacts found can be seen as a metonym for the break-up precipitated by the fall of the Xochicalca state: all the pieces show signs of intentional destruction. Among the artifacts, I was particularly interested in a beautifully reassem bled clay object, recently dubbed El Creador (The Creator) by archeologist Silvia Garza Tarazona. I propose interpreting this figure as a "cacao-man" in the evolution of its transformation based on a different reading, and identifying in it evidence of the cultural ties between the Xochicalca and the Maya, Zapotees, Nahua and other peoples. Cacao beans in pre-Hispanic times served both practical and ritual purposes. Apart from be ing a valuable item of exchange, cacao was also a powerful substance in itself, directly associated to processes of creation. From this perspective, we need to reexamine how cacao activated an entire corpus of political, aesthetic, psychological and creative relationships. The bearded face and other features of the cacao-man figure suggest direct associations with the feat performed by the god Quetzalcoatl as told in the Leyenda de los soles or Legend of the Suns: when the gods gathered together to see who would inhabit the world, he was chosen to shape man, so he descended into the underworld to search for the bones of his ancestors. He created man by mix ing together a sacrificial victim's bones and blood he collected from piercing his penis. The legend also tells the story of the origin of corn: the food that Quetzalcoatl gave to the men he had created. The cacao-man shows the complexity of re lationships in which beings accumulate identities through transformations from one life form to an other. This strange piece represents the continuity between the worlds of humans, plants and animals: it is impossible to keep these spheres and connec tions separate. I refer to a unique fusion where the vigorous lianas, with elliptical leaves and cacao pods (Jheobroma cacao) hanging off them, cover the body and also define it as a meeting point, as a re flexive artistic concept that encourages us to rethink how Mesoamerican peoples viewed humanity. The cacao-man can be seen as a rhizome (re ferring to the philosophical concept developed by Gilíes Deleuze and Félix Guattari) that shows gen eral principles of connection, heterogeneity and multiplicity; it activates an endless continuity which brings into play sexuality—given its references to 78 Anahí Luna</page><page sequence="8">Dangerous Delight the phallus and to semen converted into cacao— but it also establishes a link to the animal world, clearly emphasized in the figure's jaguar-like fangs. This dynamic world of associations contrasts with the rigid position of the figure's trunk. Like the year symbol it wears as a headdress, the lianas are not so much decoration as the cacao-man's attire. They are a kind of skin: they envelop him, cover him, and convert him into a fantastic creature, thus suggesting a series of progressive metamorphoses from Quetzalcoatl to jaguar-man to cacao tree. As such, the cacao-man is a clear example of how indigenous art, and Mesoamerican art more specifically, is an art of transformations. By exam ining these art forms we discover breathtaking cre ations that are far more than simple sculptures or mural paintings. As intermediary forms, they are images, texts, presences and relations that provide meaning based on a complex, unbounded concep tion of art.

Late Classic, 650-900 CE Chocolate, SEX, and Disorderly Women Martha Few Starting in the 1590s, Spaniards overcame their aversion to chocolate. Unlike native peoples, Spaniards often mixed in vanilla, cinnamon, and sugar. By the seventeenth century, Guatemalans from all social and ethnic groups had access to chocolate in cities such as Santiago de Guatemala, and they drank it in a wide range of contexts in daily life. The trans formation of chocolate drinks into a basic staple that could be consumed daily by not only Mayas but also Spaniards and castas (mixed-race peoples) probably occurred, in part, through native women working as servants in colonial kitchens. Not everyone could af ford Indian servants, however, which meant that less wealthy Spanish, casta and Afro-Guatemalan women most likely learned to prepare chocolate from their Indian neighbors and served it to their families. Some men and women consumed chocolate bev erages daily, especially at breakfast. The neighbor of an elderly priest described how he often brought the priest hot water so he could mix his morning choco late drink. Inhabitants of colonial Guatemala drank chocolate in many other day-to-day contexts. Mourn ers drank chocolate to fortify themselves during all night wakes. Women prepared chocolate for fiestas and other family and community events. One woman reportedly even served bewitched chocolate drinks to her slaves to prevent them from interfering in her sor cery practices and to keep them from running away. Chocolate had properties associated with healing as well. A free mulatto female servant described how a female Indian curer of magical sickness adminis tered a chocolate beverage to heal the mulatto's Indi an husband of madness. Hospitals in the capital city of Santiago budgeted money for chocolate among their food expenditures for their patients. The Royal Hospital in Santiago additionally purchased choco late for the priests who cared for the sick: forty-eight reales worth for Fray Juan de Dios Lara, the head of the hospital, and twenty-four reales for each of the eight caretaker priests. The budget also included money for chocolate for the hospital servants. Martha Few pp 78-79 El Creador (The Creator). Sector B, Structure 2, Room 3 of Xochicalco, Morelos. Late Classic, 650-900 CE</page><page sequence="9">Women continued to prepare chocolate for their families and neighbors as part of their social roles in food procurement and preparation. Female mar ket sellers also sold chocolate drinks in stalls in the capital's outdoor markets. Only in extreme cases did men prepare chocolate, as seen in Juan de Fuentes's complaint to Inquisition authorities that his wife bewitched him with sorcery. Juan, a thirty-three year-old mulatto construction worker in Santiago, Guatemala, denounced his mulatto wife Cecilia to the Inquisition, accusing her of acting as a "sorcerer witch." He charged that Cecilia used spells and curses "so that he could not be a man on all the occasions that he desired to have intercourse with [her]." Ultimately, Juan's evidence that Cecilia had used sorcery to bewitch him centered on what he per ceived to be their inverted household gender roles, shown by his inability to control his "unnatural" be havior of preparing the morning chocolate while his wife slept in. The Inquisition gave the following sum mary of his testimony: His wife treats him not as a husband but as a ser vant. He lights the fire in the kitchen, he boils the water, he mixes the chocolate and heats the food [...] and he gets up very early every morning to do this while his wife stays in bed and sleeps until very late. And when his wife wakes, he brings her chocolate so she can drink it after she dresses. And even though it is very late [in the morning], he has the water ready, [and] he drinks chocolate with his wife [...] in this way his wife has turned him into a coward, and all this cannot be a natural thing. 80</page><page sequence="10">Cecilia was eventually convicted by the Inqui sition in Santiago for sorcery, and officials sent her overland under guard to the central Inquisition jail in Mexico City. Cecilia brought a number of items along with her to ease her stay in jail including cloth ing, bedding, and an image of the Virgin of Guada lupe. She also brought with her four cakes of choco late, and a jicara, or gourd cup, specifically used to drink chocolate. By the late seventeenth century, as inhabitants from all social and ethnic groups in colonial Guate mala drank chocolate in large quantities, the cultural meanings of chocolate had expanded from ancient Maya ritual and economic meanings and became re fashioned and transformed to include associations with female social disorder. In accounts of women who acted "disorderly" in a variety of public contexts, colonial authorities and inhabitants of the capital of ten included descriptions of women's illicit sexual activity and practices of sexual witchcraft, where women took advantage of their roles in food prepa ration to assert power over the men in their lives. Because of its dark color and grainy texture, chocolate provided an ideal cover for items associ ated with sexual witchcraft. These included various powders and herbs, as well as female body parts and fluids, which women then mixed into a chocolate beverage and fed to men to control their sexuality. Manuela Gutiérrez, a twenty-year-old single mu latto servant, consulted a mulatto sorcerer named Gerónima de Barahona for sexual witchcraft. Gutiérrez described how she was having problems with her lover and wanted something to attract him. De Barahona gave her some powders and told Gutiérrez to wash her partes naturales (genitals) with water, then beat the powders and the water into a hot chocolate drink and give it to the man she desired. Nicolasa de Torres, a single, free mulatto servant, wanted to sexually attract her employer. She consulted an Indian woman named Petrona Munguia, who told her to take her pubic hairs and a small worm found under a certain type of stone, and then mix everything together and put it in her employer's chocolate. At times, mothers and daughters cooperated in their use of chocolate in sexual witchcraft, passing this knowledge from one generation to the next. In 1705, a mulatto slave accused her mistress, a wealthy mulatto widow named Francisca de Agreda, and her daughter, Juana, of practicing sexual witchcraft. The slave claimed that Francisca and Juana concocted a bewitched chocolate drink to send to Franciscas lover, the parish priest of the primarily indigenous town of Santa Maria. The slave asserted that the drink contained Franciscas pubic hairs, gray hairs from her head, her fingernails, and saliva, along with hairs from Juana. The women were perhaps inspired to mix their bodily matter by the belief that this in creased their power over Francisca's lover. Not only poor, mixed-race, and Indian women consulted female sorcerers for sexual witchcraft using chocolate; elite Spanish women did as well. Women often asked their neighbors and friends for recommendations on whom to consult for sorcery, and they also used them as go-betweens to acquire the necessary ritual items. Gerónima de Barahona, herself a well-known sorcerer in late-seventeenth century Santiago, acted as a go-between for Luisa de Gálvez. Gálvez gave Barahona half a loaf of bread and four bread rolls and asked her to take them to the house of an Indian woman named Maria de Zu magra and trade them for some ritual powders for sexual witchcraft. Barahona went and returned with three packets of powders, one for Gálvez to place in the clothes of the man she desired, and the other two to put in his chocolate and food. Gálvez then washed her armpits and genitals with water, and another woman mixed the powders and this water for her into a chocolate drink. Despite her elite sta tus, Gálvez had a violent reputation as shown by her nickname, La Machete. Barahona explained that ev eryone called Luisa Gálvez "La Machete'" "because she could cut out a tongue with a machete." Chocolate also proved a useful cover for ritual items designed to force men to return home, or to stop them from using physical violence. Gertrudis de San José, a twenty-two-year-old free mulatto wom an, had a fight with her husband, a muleteer, and he left her. To try to force him to return, she chewed cacao beans, mixed them with black powders, and buried them under the door to her husband's house. Not satisfied that the ritual would suffice, she also gathered worms from underneath stones called rosquetas, toasted them in a pan, and ground them with powders. San José then mixed everything into a chocolate drink to give to other men she desired "so that the men would not leave her and that they would love her." Other women used sexual witchcraft to desenojar al hombre, literally "to free a man of his anger." Maria de los Angeles, a thirty-year-old Spanish seamstress, mixed black powders and water she had used to wash 81</page><page sequence="11">her genitals into a gourd cup filled with hot chocolate so that her lover "would lose his anger." The aforementioned Luisa de Gálvez, in search of relief from physical abuse by her male partner, pursued a simi lar strategy. She consulted an Indian woman named Anita for a spell "to free him of his anger." Anita gave Gálvez some green and cinnamon-colored powders. First, Gálvez washed her geni tals with water. She then mixed the water with the powders into a hot chocolate drink, and fed it to her partner. A single light skinned mulatto woman named Melchora de los Reyes, began a sexual relationship with her lover before marriage, probably after he had promised to marry her. He lat er abandoned Reyes, threatening her reputation as a doncella (virgin). Reyes bought some powders from a sorcerer and mixed them into her lover's chocolate to make him "subject to her will," so that he would return and marry her. Women also used bewitched chocolate drinks to take revenge against sexual competitors. Catarina Delgado, a twenty-eight-year-old Spanish woman, accused a woman named Agustina of doing just that Delgados husband, sergeant Nicolás Callejos, also a Spaniard, had been conducting an illicit affair with Agustina, a mulatto servant who lived next to the Uni versity of San Carlos, in the house of her employer. According to Delgado, one day Agustina came to their home and fought "with much brazenness" in public with her husband Nicolás. A few days passed and Agustina and a female friend brought them over some chocolate as a peace offering. Catarina Delgado, her husband, and their female Indian servant all drank the chocolate. Delgado soon fell ill, describing her sick ness as "expelling black and yellow flow," where she alternately vomited yellow, green, and blood-colored, water-like substances. The female Indian servant fell ill with the same sickness and died, while the husband apparently remained healthy. Men were well aware that women used chocolate as vehicles for sexual witchcraft, and they sometimes took advantage of the association between hot choco late drinks and sexual witchcraft in their pursuit of female lovers. Rosa de Arevillaga was a twenty-eight year-old mulatto slave of a nun and lived cloistered in the convent of Santa Catalina Mártir in Santiago. Despite her slave status, Inquisition authorities listed Arevillaga as a doncella or virgin. She had received an education in the convent, as evidenced by the letter she wrote to Inquisition authorities denouncing her confessor for solicitation in the confessional. In the letter, Rosa described how she had gone to confess during the Easter holidays. As she waited, she served the priest, Padre Francisco de Castellanos, a cup of chocolate in front of the other priests "as it was the fashion and kindness that one does in the convent for the confessors." When she entered the confessional, Padre Francisco attempted to seduce her, calling her "his soul, and his life, and his Rose of Jericho." As Rosa fended off his advances, Padre Francisco told her that he knew that she had put powders in the chocolate she served him so "to gain his love." Because of the close association between choco late drinks and sorcery in colonial Guatemala, those who were served chocolate by women with whom they had ongoing conflicts treated the drinks with suspicion. In 1730, Manuel Antonio Calderón, a twenty-one-year-old free mulatto weaver, described his marriage to his seventeen-year-old wife Magda lena as contentious. According to the Inquisition's summary of his testimony, "there has not been one day that they [Manuel and Magdalena] have not fought, because she mistreated him in word and deed." Manuel suspected that his wife had cast a spell on him, putting demons in his body that caused him to suffer from an "affliction of reason." He re counted how six months before, Mag dalena, his mother-in-law, and his sister-in-law offered him a cup of chocolate. When Manuel took the cup, he noticed that it weighed more than usual and became suspicious, thinking that the women had perhaps added something nefarious to the drink. Manuel decid ed not to drink the choco late and placed the cup in the corner of the room. He put next to the choco late a sprig of rosemary, an herb associated with ritual cleansing and protection from evil in Spanish cul ture. When he returned, 82</page><page sequence="12">his wife and her mother and sister "laugh [ed] at [him], taking [him] for an idiot." The next morning when Manuel checked the cup, he "found the cup of chocolate filled with such a large quantity of white worms that the cup of chocolate appeared to move on its own, which horrified [him]." Manuel pointed to the bewitched chocolate as the first in a series of incidents that led him to believe that his wife had cast a supernatural illness on him that caused symp toms of "confusion" and "insanity." He eventually un derwent a series of exorcisms conducted by the local parish priest to cleanse him of the sorcery. Inquisition records describe how chocolate could also be used as the basis for ritual beverages designed to cast supernatural illnesses, or even mur der rivals. Maria de Santa Inés, described by wit nesses as a "one-eyed, dark-skinned mulatto," had a citywide reputation for violence and murder. Santa Inés was known in the capital as La Panecito (The Pastry), because of rumors that she used bewitched chocolate pastries to murder her enemies. Pascual Pinto, a married mestizo who ran a shop in the front of his home, claimed that people called Santa Inés La Panecito because she cast a spell on a woman from another neighborhood with a bewitched chocolate pastry. Pinto's sister, a thirty-year-old woman mar ried to a tailor, confirmed Santa Inés's violent reputa tion, reiterating the aforesaid claim. She added that local authorities had punished Santa Inés with ban ishment for having participated in beating another woman to death. Teresa de Solorzano, a thirty-year old, single mulatto, told Inquisition authorities that Cecilia de Arrióla inflicted a supernatural illness on her neighbor's female Indian servant after a series of arguments between the two women. The Indian ser vant supposedly suffered nausea and breathlessness after eating bewitched pastry and died soon after. This is an excerpt of the article "Chocolate, Sex, and Disorderly Women in Late-Seventeenth-and Early-Eighteenth-Century Guatemala" published in Ethnohistory. Ancient Delight Ch'orti Cacao Johanna Kufer, Nikolai Grube, Michael Heinrich The Ch'orti' Maya live in eastern Guatemala and western Honduras, near the Maya ar chaeological site of Copan. The region com monly referred to as "Ch'orti' area" includes the Gua temalan municipios of Jocotán, Camotán, San Juan Ermita and Olopa, altogether comprising approxi mately 100 000 inhabitants. In the neighbouring mu nicipio of Quetzaltepeque, the use of the ancestral language has recently disappeared, while other ele ments of Ch'orti' culture, particularly rain ceremo nies and other rites of the agrarian cult, continue to be practiced. The latter is mainly concerned with asking for copious rainfall during the rainy season (May to October) and paying the Holy Earth, as well as the "angels" (rain gods) their dues in a grateful and respectful manner. One of the most important cer emonial events of the agricultural year is the Great Inaugural Rain Ceremony in late April, locally called traída del invierno ("fetching of the rain"), which includes a ritual meal next to a sacred spring in the mountains, the sacrificial offering of black chilate (a cacao-and-maize gruel) and a pair of turkeys to this spring, and the invocation and feeding of the rain gods with black chilate at the confraternity building, according to anthropologist Raphael Girard. Cacao Uses in Eastern Guatemala Although the local production of cacao has fallen to in significant amounts, the dried beans are traded in the markets and used for culinary and ritual purposes in ways specific to the area. The use of cacao-containing beverages on ritual and ceremonial occasions demon strates that cacao continues to be culturally important even though it has lost its economic importance. Cacao uses in Eastern Guatemala differ signifi cantly according to ethnicity, a fact that is partly ob scured by the use of the term "(hot) chocolate" for different preparations. Ladinos in the area continue to prepare two kinds of drinks containing cacao. The first is hot chocolate, for which the gently parched beans are peeled, ground and mixed with sugar and cinnamon. It is used as a Pewter chocolate jar. Imperial Silver Company. Omaha, 1900. MUCHO Johanna Kufer, Nikolai Grube, Michael Heinrich Pewter chocolate jar. Imperial Silver Company. Omaha, 1900. MUCHO</page><page sequence="13">festival drink, especially on Christmas and New Year, and used to be an important part of women's post partum diet. In the town of Jocotán, Ladinos also use chocolate as a filling for a type of flat cake made for Christmas and New Year. The other culinary use of cacao by Ladinos in the area is for making tiste, a refreshing cold drink con taining cacao, sugar, cinnamon, and annatto, which gives it a red colour. It is said to possess a cooling and refreshing effect on the stomach and the urinary sys tem, as well as a mild diuretic action. The most im portant occasion for drinking tiste is around Easter, during the hottest part of the year. Hot chocolate prepared by the Ch'orti' in some hamlets of Jocotán significantly differs from the La dino recipe: dry cacao beans are toasted on the griddle (comal), but not peeled, and ground with an equal amount of heavily toasted maize. Unrefined cane sugar and water are added. This chocolate was and continues to be an important food gift exchanged between parents and godparents at baptism—ac cording to anthropologist Charles Wisdom—and hot chocolate is occasionally still used as a festival drink. Ground cacao beans are sometimes also added to cof fee and pinol, particularly on festive occasions. Pinol, also called "maize coffee," is made from heavily toasted ground maize, sweetened with unrefined cane sugar and often seasoned with spices like cinnamon, allspice and anise. It is particularly recommended for the post partum period and supposed to stimulate lactation. Cacao is used as a main ingredient in two dif ferent ritual drinks also containing maize which are both locally called chilate but vary in their mode of preparation. One kind of chilate is made from ground maize and water, boiled and filled hot in jicaras (cup shaped calabash dishes made from fruits of Crescentia alata). Before serving it to pilgrims and participants in rituals, a blob of chocolate, made from toasted ca cao and maize, is added to the individual vessels. The other kind, black chilate, is made by mixing ground maize and cacao (without toasting) with cold water, resulting in a thick dark-brown liquid. This is filled in guacals, bowl-shaped calabash dishes made from a different species of calabash tree (C. cujete) and des tined for ritual offerings. Another cacao drink used during the rain ceremonies is called fresco de cacao. Like the second type of chilate, it is prepared with cold water and ground cacao beans without parching. It is a refreshment which helps the ritual specialists to keep cool while they carry out the rituals of the Great Inaugural Rain Ceremony in late April. The Symbolism of the Cacao Tree The symbolism of cacao is complex and includes a num ber of different aspects that are related to biological and ecological characteristics of the cacao tree. According to Mary Miller and Karl Taube, it also includes aspects connected to another Mesoamerican concept central in Maya religious thought: a cosmological order based on the structural principle of paired opposites. These opposites are complementary rather than compet ing, because a balance between both partners of a pair is considered essential for the continuation of human civilization and the periodical recreation of the world. The most important pairings include male and female, day and night, sky and earth, life and death and fire and water. These individual pairings of opposites may be grouped into complexes, with one side rep resenting day, sun, male and fire, whereas the other represents night, moon, female, and water. The oppo sition between field and forest is another aspect of this cosmological order. The field is an open space where sunlight reaches the ground, hence it belongs to the sun-day-light complex, whereas the cool, damp shade of the forest is associated with the com plex moon-dark-night, Taube also states. The classification of food, medicines, and illnesses into "hot" and "cold" is an important ethno-medical concept throughout Latin America. Since this classi fication does not always refer to thermal qualities of the classified entities, but includes other criteria and is related to the dry/wet dichotomy, American anthro pologist George Foster has interpreted its prevalence in Latin America as a simplified version of the Hip pocratic theory of four humors, resulting from the introduction of these ideas by the Spaniards. How ever, given the importance of binary oppositions in Mesoamerican cosmology, it seems likely that such a basic dichotomy as the hot/cold one should already have been important in Mesoamerican thinking be fore contact with the Europeans, "hot" forming part of the symbol complex sun-light-day-male and "cold" belonging to the complex moon-dark-night-female. The maintenance of balance between "hot" and "cold" is generally regarded as desirable and essential for human health in most areas where the hot/cold dichotomy is in use. In the hot lowlands of eastern Guatemala, illnesses associated with fever and pain are a major health problem and generally treated with "cool" remedies. In the context of women's reproduc tive health, however, "cold" is regarded as the principal danger and the maintenance of body warmth with the 84</page><page sequence="14">help of "hot remedies" is seen as essential for female fertility. Spicy and/or dry foods, as well as plants grow ing in sunny, dry areas are generally classified as "hot," whereas unripe, sour and juicy fruits, mucilaginous and fatty substances, diuretics and plants growing in wet, shady places are classified as "cool" {fresco). In the context of Ch'orti' rain ceremonies, it is of prime importance for the ritual specialists to keep their bod ies and environment "cool" in order to attract the rain. Besides abstention from the "heat" of sexual activity and avoidance of the "warm" colors red and yellow in ritual clothing, "cool" plants are indispensable requi sites to keep dangerous heat at bay. The cacao tree and its products are classified as "cool," mainly because it grows under shade trees and shows a preference for humid places. The fatty consis tency of the seeds and their diuretic action, caused by theobromine content, may further contribute to this classification. The "cool" character of cacao is generally seen as beneficial, which is reflected in the use of the word fresco (cool, fresh) to describe it, while a perni cious cold quality is usually referred to as helado (icy). To quote Martin Prechtel, in contemporary highland Maya myths, the cacao tree uses these beneficial quali ties to provide protection and shade for the sun/maize deity: according to the Tz'utujil Maya of Santiago Ati tlán, the sun takes a rest every day at noon under the cacao tree that grows in the umbilicus of the sky. In a K'iche' myth from Chichicastenango recorded by Ruth Bunzel, Jesus Christ, who often takes the place of the sun/maize god in contemporary versions of Maya myths, finds refuge from his persecutors under the ca cao tree and subsequently gives his blessing to it. Some preparations containing cacao, such as hot chocolate and pinol with cacao, are classified as "hot" and even recommended specifically for the postpartum pe riod when all "cool" foods and drinks are banned. How ever, the "hot" quality of these beverages originates not from the cacao bean itself, but is achieved by parching the beans (which reverses their "cool" nature), adding spicy hot condiments such as cinnamon, cloves or allspice, and boiling the beverages. Cacao and Maize Maize and cacao form a pair of opposites based on opposing biological and ecological characteristics of the two plants. Maize grows in the full sun on fields, while cacao grows in the cool shade under other trees. Maize is an annual plant and only requires water during the few months of its lifecycle, while Cacao tree.

Engraved in steel plate and hand colored. MUCHO the cacao tree lives many years and requires a cer tain degree of humidity all year. At the same time, the arrangement of seeds in a cacao pod resembles a maize ear, which is reflected in the use of the Span ish word mazorca for both. This may be one of the reasons why, according to Simon Martin, cacao is the most prominent of the "anthropomorphic" fruit trees in Maya mythology. Many of the plants con sidered sacred by the Maya have an anthropomor phic structure—this has been documented among contemporary and Classic period Maya. The special relationship between cacao and maize also becomes apparent in the similarity between processing meth ods of cacao beans and maize grains for the prepara tion of ritual drinks. Given the importance of fallow periods for con tinued soil fertility in a shifting cultivation system, it seems plausible that a conceptual pairing should exist between the main staple maize, for which the forest must be cut down, and the cacao tree, which requires the forest to grow well. Thus the pairing of maize and cacao represents two important aspects of a successful agricultural economy—healthy open fields and a healthy diverse forest. Using the environ mental requirements of these two plants as a guide, the Maya may have limited their impact on the envi ronment to a sustainable level.

MUCHO</page><page sequence="15">A Taste of His Own CHOCOLATE You were once the drink of deities, bitter and tart at the outset, but then you became a bad habit, the cure for horrible infirmities, your fame spread at great velocity, and made you an element crucial for staving off the colonial chill, warming hearts that were sad. Even aphrodisiac uses you had. You were even the cause of a funeral. From steaming bowls of chocolate, all day they'd drink of you, and alongside this tasty brew, pastries, sweets and tartlets, candied bars made of peanuts, biscuits spiced with cinnamon, and every kind of sugared bun. They served you fresh from the pot in clay mugs, still piping hot, thick and frothy, properly done. They drank you at all hours, at any time and in any place. Even Mass you were sure to grace. At the oddest times they served you, while the ladies rustled through, the servants couldn't beat any faster the sermon was an utter disaster, so long were the servants toiling that the bishop's blood was boiling, just like water for chocolate. The bishop was befuddled, and had you excommunicated, but your exile only created an uproar and a muddle. A fatal dose caused the trouble, for he drank a cup of such size that you brought on his demise. And as the popular saying states, his accounts were settled, if late, but happily not so the chocolate. The news was soon widely known: killed not with kindness or coffee, but with chocolate, most cruelly only to drive the point home. And when his time had come, the bishop's final absurd feat was to ban everyone's favorite treat. The bigmouth by his own mouth died, and it surely cannot be denied, was given a taste of his own chocolate. Tra-la-la Maria, chocolate and French bread. I never drink it at home because I'd have to drink it alone but I would drink it gladly if you would stir it up for me.

Museo del Objeto (modo).</page><page sequence="16">Prodigious Delight Celestial Nectar Jorge Betanzos By 1753, the year in which Linnaeus's Species Plantarum was published, cacao had been tasted across Europe. Although it is not en tirely clear why the Swede named it the "food of the gods"—the learned physician Sir Hans Sloane played a part in the story—the reasons are not hard to imag ine. Perhaps the name was an attempt to legitimize the drink of choice at court in France, or because it was the Zeitgeist. But the many possible explanations all relate to people's extreme fondness for cacao and the various concoctions that used it as an ingredi ent. Even in literature, we can see the jump from ca cao's demonization to its worship, as evidenced in the Parte práctica de botánica del caballero Carlos Linneo (1786), the book that introduced Linnaeus's taxonomy to Spain, which claims: "The cacao almonds are greasy and slightly bitter, nutritious, aphrodisiacal and hot [...] and their butter is useful for cracked skin on the chest. [...] This plant was given the name Theo broma, which [in Greek] means the Food of God." If literature—and especially popular literature can be said to reflect its time, the pleasure aroused by chocolate in the eighteenth century can be seen in the ballad quoted in Gabriel Saldívar's Historia de la música en México. Its title sums it up: "The joys of the most revered, excellent and eminent Lord Tablet of Chocolate" and its first three quartets: "Your ex cellence and virtue / Inspire us into singing. / God strengthen and preserve you, / Chocolate of my be ing. // Warm skies above Caracas / Viewed your il lustrious birth: / For you the sounding rattles / Made merriment and mirth. // Our troubles flee before you, / Joy flavors your arriving. / God strengthen and preserve you, / Chocolate of my loving." We can add another part because, like with chocolate, one taste is never enough: "Friars, monks and chaplains, / nuns devout and saintly, / pay you their obeisance; / beauties too and gallants / praise you extravagantly." According to the compiler, this text is likely to have been sung as a corrido, since the Diccionario de autoridades already included it as a type of dance with accompaniment. Here there are two aspects that catch our eye: "Caracas" and "our troubles flee before you." Theobroma cacao probably originated in the Amazon, from where it spread to Mexico; how ever, this happened thousands of years ago. The bal lad refers to the period when cacao was imported from Central and South America due to the signif icant number of casualties caused by the conquest and epidemics in Mexico. For the line "our troubles flee before you," we can offer the following explanation: after Cortés mentioned in his Cartas de relación that the drink prepared with cacao gave his men enough strength for the whole day, countless treatises were written to justify (and some to refute) its medicinal proper ties, and these remained lodged in people's minds for centuries. Those who argued in its favor will have delighted in La cartuja de Parma that Clélia Conti wrote to Fabrizio del Dongo: "The poison! Be careful with the water, with the wine, with everything. Live off chocolate, do not touch the food they give you." Clearly, he was left no other option; but he did not seem to be concerned about a diet that a physician would be reluctant to prescribe today. Disapprovers have left us with amusing accounts that are eminently unscientific and reveal more about their demanding tastes: in Historia del Mondo Nuovo (1572), Girolamo Benzoni wrote off cacao as "more suited for pigs than for men," and in Theatrum Botanicum (1640), John Parkinson states the Indians held it in great esteem for want of anything better, but that to Christians it seemed like pigswill, though he grudgingly admits that if there was nothing better to drink, they could get used to it. English and Dutch pirates are also famed for calling cacao beans sheep "droppings," and they would throw cacao overboard or burn it if they found it in the hold of an inter cepted Spanish vessel. As a final note, centuries later, when addressing one of his friends, José Antonio Alzate wrote in his Gaceta de literatura: "You, who have never been willing to drink something that has the reputation of causing or increasing melancholy, on hearing the word Theobroma, told me: I'd call it a practical joke of the gods instead." This reputation mentioned by Alzate was not in vented by his friend, nor did it even come from his era; one of the most frequently cited books in favor of chocolate, Problemas y secretos maravillosos de las Indias (1591) by the physician Juan de Cárdenas, considered it unhealthy to drink the foam "since it is nothing more than a little air that inflates the stom ach, prevents digestion and even lies heavy on the 87 Jorge Betanzos</page><page sequence="17">heart, as they say, and causes terrible melancholy." If this was true, perhaps it explains why Lord Byron was a member of the Cocoa-Tree Club, one of the most famous chocolate houses in England; or per haps it is the origin of Goethe's taste for chocolate until his old age. One year after he became friends with Schiller, the German poet spent various weeks in Jena. He brought provisions with him, and re marked, "Whoever drinks a cup of chocolate will be able to withstand a whole day's journey. I have done this ever since Von Humboldt advised me to." Alexandre Dumas would also discuss Chocolate in his Great Dictionary of Cuisine (1873), a book pub lished posthumously by Leconte de Lisle and Anatole France. Fernando del Paso writes that, in nineteenth century France "the Aztec origin [of chocolate] was generally recognized after people had forgotten the legend that claimed an angel, landing in Bayonne, had brought it to Europe." Among other things, Du mas suggests that "to obtain the very best chocolate, one must mix—in equal proportions—Caracas, Santa Magdalena and Berbice cacao." Also, the nineteenth century was the century of philology and Dumas could not resist the temptation to state that "It is believed that the term 'chocolate' comes from two words in the Mexican language: 'choco,' sound or noise, and 'atle,' water, because the Mexicans beat it in water to pro duce foam;" in a word, it's onomatopoeic. This could take us to Dumas's source; that, and an excerpt from his Dictionary. "The ladies of the new world seem to be besotted with chocolate and use it frequently. It is rumored that, not content with drinking it in their homes throughout the day, sometimes they even take it to church, an indulgence that has often led to the disapproval and reproaches of their confessors." A Taste of His Own Chocolate In 1625, the bishop Bernardino de Salazar y Frías, just four years after his arrival in Chiapas, sparked a notorious controversy that cost him his life when he forbade ladies from drinking chocolate (served by servants and slaves) during Mass, since it disrupted the solemnity of the church service. The ladies found it helped them sit through lengthy sermons; it ap pears their attitude was inflexible, and poison was added one morning to the bishop's cup of the deli cious drink. Artemio del Valle Arizpe refers to this incident to explain the coinage of one of most typical sayings in Mexico: le dieron una sopa de su propio chocolate, "they gave him a taste of his own medicine," a statement found in his introduction to the Relación que contiene los viajes de Tomás Gage a la Nueva Es paña. And it is Thomas Gage again who told of the fateful incident of the poisoning and who, we might deduce, is Dumas's source for his Dictionary entry. The English clergyman stated that the "name choc olatte is an Indian name, and is compounded from atta' which in the Mexican language signifieth water, and from the sound which the water (wherein is put the chocolatte) makes, as 'choco, choco, choco,"'— a bit of philology that we cannot attribute to him either. Gage spent twelve years in Mexico, during which time he drank five cups of chocolate a day; this would give him the sufficient authority to state that the nuns of Oaxaca prepared it with particular skill, and it is this gastronomic fame of Oaxaca, formerly known as the Valle de Antequera, that was displayed at tables during the Spanish Golden Age. Oaxaca in the Spanish Golden Age In El entrometido y la dueña y el soplón, Francisco de Quevedo speaks of the Indies' "revenge" on Spain: "they have done us more damage with their powders and smoke and clay jugs and molinillos [a wooden whisk used for preparing cacao beverages] than any thing done by the Catholic king to Columbus, Cor tés, Almagro and Pizarro." A low blow that would continue to hurt for centuries, and that could still be felt in Spain's stomach in the seventeenth century. In No puede ser, Agustín Moreto gets Tarugo to entice Don Félix: "It does you no harm, drink it, / for the chocolate in Madrid / is taken as much as tobacco," thus revealing the craze for cacao at the time." While on the subject, we should quote from the learned Julio Monreal's El Chocolate: "The [choco 88</page><page sequence="18">late] which immediately shot to fame as the best from the land of Columbus came from Oaxaca." Calderón de la Barca offers proof of this in several texts, such as El escondido y la tapada and El pésame de la viu da, in which Beatriz says "Lacking cacao from Oaxa ca, / this other one ultimately is not too bad, / cacao from la Mancha." And if more proof were needed, we could begin with La rabia, in which Negro, among a group of creditors, makes the following demand on Doña Aldonza: "Ma'am, will you pay me / for those three cases of chocolate / ... I had to give twelve re ales, / since much of it is Oaxacan." In La garapiña, the gallant Don Gil says to the Italian cobbler Coquerón: "Would you have at this time / a candy frosted / with chocolate?" And Co querón replies: "Oh, and 'ow good! / Chocolate from //oang /iaka!" The fame of Oaxacan chocolate could be debated in the seventeenth century, saying it only appealed to Calderón, but Sebastián de Villaviciosa and Fran cisco de Avellaneda add their voices to the ample number of references in Cuantas veo tantas quiero (1661), where Doña Elena says, "Chairs, Celia! and tell Lucretia / they are to bring chocolate / for these two gentlemen." To which Coleto replies: "Madam, if it's from Oaxaca, / and has an egg-yolk in it... / when taking chocolate, I / am a man of charming nature." It is remarkable that this level of enthusiasm did not find an echo in Mexico, and that in a text as verbose in its descriptions as La grandeza mexi cana (1604), for example, Bernardo de Balbuena leaves out cacao trees and instead refers to pines, elms, willows, cypresses and firs that are much more evocative of Europe. Might the author have been somehow reluctant to name it because it seemed "vulgar"? Was Balbuena not aware that in the sev enteenth century chocolate from Turin—a city that could surely legitimize cacao's inclusion on the list of trees—was very well known and highly esteemed? The answer might be as simple as this: the cacao plantations were thousands of kilometers away... but what about the drink? Mexican Literature (and some Reports from South America) Falling in love with customs and settings, the nine teenth century had the delicacy of leaving us various literary works adding to our knowledge about choco late. For example, in Memorias de mis tiempos, Guill ermo Prieto wrote that for the middle classes of his era, "when the table had to be elegantly laid, the fam ily began breakfast with the usual chocolate, but not any old chocolate, rather the one called de tres tantos (a combination of equal parts cinnamon, sugar and cacao), thickened with cornstarch for the little ones." Coffee was certainly the drink—and coffee hous es the meeting places—of the nineteenth century, but in Mexico at least, chocolate makes notable cameo appearances, even in cafés as distinguished as Pro greso or the one at the National Theater, with such important witnesses as Manuel Payno and Guill ermo Prieto himself. In Payno's work, the chocolate industry was poetic enough to provide the setting for one of the period's classic novels, El fistol del dia blo (1845): "On one side, one could see eight or ten women grinding up the chocolate, breaking up sugar, toasting cacao, crushing it, or making tablets in the usual shapes and sizes; on the other, long rows of jars of guava and quince-flavored cajeta from Arequipa..." Antonio García Cubas, in El libro de mis recu erdos (1905), treats it as a character who lives in his memory and in the most renowned locations: "The cafés, such as the venerable Cazador, Progreso, Bella Unión and Gran Sociedad, opened their doors at the crack of dawn so that early-risers could eat a hearty breakfast of chocolate or café con leche" 89</page><page sequence="19">How much of a leap is there between being the main actor (such as "Lord Tablet of Chocolate") and just being part of the scenery? Imagine, if you will, the brilliant scientists concerned with discovering which part of the tongue the chocolate must come in con tact with to achieve its effects, and then confidently providing an unequivocal answer like in One Hun dred Years of Solitude, where Father Nicanor, in an attempt to offer up "irrefutable proof of the infinite power of God," miraculously levitates after drinking a cup of chocolate given to him by an acolyte. The eye can travel a road in an instant, and chang es happen in the blink of an eye. From being treated as treasure to being a drink only fit for the poor, from being offered to the most distinguished guests to be ing the perfect gift for a budding romance, chocolate will always be waiting to surprise someone credulous looking for the origin of the pleasure and passion for the "the food of the gods." Addenda: Strange Uses Chocolate being what it is, leaving us always want ing more, this final section could also be called "the second cup... but just half-full." Here we must recall the Marquis de Sade's The 120 Days of Sodom, in which there was a regulation stipulating that eight naked young girls were to serve the drink to the eleven friends, who "shall repair to the quarters appointed for the little girls. In that place will be served breakfast consisting of chocolate, or of roasts cooked in Spanish wine or of other appropriate restoratives"... an echo of the aphrodisiacal vigor always ascribed to it. Although it sounds unfamiliar to us, the oft-cited use of cacao seeds as common currency continued in some parts of Mexico until the end of the nineteenth century. According to the Mexican anthropologist José García Payón, it was used as a currency "in small quantities until 1887 in different markets in Mexi co and Central America, where Charnay witnessed transactions in the town of San Cristóbal in Chiapas; and according to information given to me by Luis González Obregón, in the courtyard of Mexico City's Cathedral, there was an Ecce Homo with a basket into which the pious folk would toss a cacao coin,' and the icon was called "The Lord of Cacao."' We should men tion that this tasty currency subsidized another pi ous act, speeding up the beatification process for Se bastián de Aparicio, which had been left unresolved between 1696 and 1700. On the lists appear "eight pounds of chocolate given to the most distinguished promoter of the cause, and two to his secretary," a gift that was given, in increasing amounts even, on a yearly basis. And to conclude, we can mention a tradition that has nowadays been elevated into something sophisticated in the context of the spa: the chroni cler Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo remarks (and Thomas Gage mentions something similar) that in Nicaragua the locals "spread that paste on their fac es so that they appear caked in mud [...] they and the womenfolk [think] that the most mudded is the most handsome, and so they go on [...] doing what they see fit, and from time to time, they lick off a little of this oil, using their fingers to eat bits of it." Thus, the chronicler observed, they managed to pro tect themselves from the sun, look beautiful and sate their appetite: three things that could only be done by applying this most mouth-watering of foods.

Its marvelous flavor was more than enough to consider it the "food of God." If I think about it, the name would have even been suitable the century before the publication of his Species Plantarum, since when Anne of Austria married Louis XIII, chocolate lost its Jesuit and Cistercian sobriety and took on the excesses of rococo. The queen had brought it to Eu rope in order to turn it into the drink of the European aristocracy, and according to Wolfgang Schivelbusch, it quickly acquired the same status as the French lan guage, tobacco, whalebone corsets and fans. Thereby, the aristocrats (obviously given their privileges by the unimpeachable will of God) began to take frothing pitchers to the boudoir; offering no resistance, they let themselves be swept away by its properties: ac cording to Antonio Lavendan's Treatise on the Use, Abuse, Properties and Virtues of Tobacco, Coffee, Tea and Chocolate, cacao led to "more spirited blood" that kept the "frenzy of malignant fevers" at bay or, at least, repaired the constitution and the soul of sinners overcome by alcohol, voluptuousness and laborious discussions that could not fail to cause them morti fying insomnia. Cacao beverage was so good that in 1662, the prickly business of whether ingesting it vio lated the fast was decided, when Cardinal Francisco Maria Brancaccio dictated this definitive sentence: "Beverages do not break the fast, since wine, being as it is so nutritious, does not break it. The same applies to cacao beverage." Cacao beverage, in the Spanish or French style, was seen in Europe as the beverage of the clergy and nobles, of sensible and decent people; it was clearly nothing like coffee, which was imposing itself in the Protestant countries and kingdoms. Therefore, it is not by chance that it conquered Europe via Spain, France and Italy, once men of the sword and colo nists learned to appreciate it, in the words of Marcy Norton, thanks to their continual material depen dence on the Indians. It is true that cacao bever age and powder were Catholic, even ultramontane. Therefore it does not surprise me that, during the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the Galician chocolatier Matías López López still wrote about it in profoundly religious terms: Yes; chocolate is the divine food, and this is re vealed even in its making; since when he is elaborat ing it, a man is on his knees, as if he were asking God for the strength and wisdom to create such a delicate paste without tainting its delicious aroma; when it is dissolved in the chocolate pot, hands are joined in an act of giving thanks to the Heavens for the ambrosia it exhales, for the aroma with which it perfumes us and through which our intelligence is strengthened and inspired; and when ingesting it, it seems that man, looking up at the sky, believes [...] that in that instant his spirit is flying towards Heaven. Though cacao beverage had those overtones on the European side of the Atlantic, in eighteenth-cen tury New Spain things were quite different: during the Bourbon period and Frenchification—due to the influence of liberals rather than Anne of Austria's— pitchers of cacao were gradually withdrawn from con vents and monasteries, from decent homes where the most militant Catholicism was practiced. A new bev erage had arrived in this part of the kingdom: coffee. After meeting with some resistance and quite a bit of scorn, it was accepted by the inhabitants of New Spain who—according to Salvador Novo—began growing it around 1790. Coffee was so liberal that drinking it was recommended for people who were spending too much time in churches. In 1810, a weekly newspaper, the Semanario Económico de México, stated that "to day's physicians believe that the use of coffee is advis able for corpulent people, who lead sedentary lives," such as priests and women of good families. José Luis Trueba Lara</page><page sequence="21">During the nineteenth century, drinking either cacao or coffee revealed two contrary attitudes. Ca cao led to a waking dream state, immobility, to an oth erworldly paradise; on the other hand, coffee sparked movement, discussion and, in some cases, direct ac tion. This was its nature: Antoine Galland, the man who made the One Thousand and One Nights known in Europe thanks to a very questionable translation, stated that the Turks served it before a conversation began to lag, since coffee awakened wit, dispelled the heaviness caused by (alcoholic) vapors, animated the spirit, but above all, it made people happy. The differences between cacao and coffee were not limited to the effects they had on their consum ers, who ended up irreconcilably divided. Their consumption was also clearly divided along gender and political lines, and the places where they con sumed differed. Cacao beverage, as I have said, was preferred by ladies, the clergy, nuns and aristocrats; coffee was for virile men, unruly politicians and the hardworking bourgeoisie. As an example, in 1828, Mariano José de Larra relates that a gentleman was quite surprised by reading the title of the book El té de las damas (The Ladies' Tea): "Oh, how this title had him stumped! In Spain, where ladies do not even drink tea [...], why did it not say The Ladies' Cacao?" On the other hand, places where these bever ages were consumed were also seen as antithetical: cacao was served in the cloister and in parlors where people had just finished restoring their spirits by re citing the mysteries of the rosary or the three prayers of the Angelus, while the café first appeared as a place that was even more mannish than the pulquería. The first of these establishments, the Café de Manrique, located on Tacuba Street in Mexico City, only al lowed in men, and those that followed it did their best to maintain this segregation. Cafés increased in number as the scope of public life grew, and after in dependence had been declared, they came in every shape, color and price range. Some were even listed in tourist guidebooks: for instance, in his Guía de fo rasteros y repertorio de conocimientos útiles (Guide for Foreigners and a List of Useful Tips), Juan Nepo muceno Almonte recommended going to Progreso, La Bella Unión and La Gran Sociedad, among others. While talk at the cloisters focused on preserving the past, "cafés [...] were [...] meeting places, sites for political conspiracies, for reading newspapers and for literary events," in the words of Clementina Díaz y de Ovando. Therefore, many conspirators and liberals in 92</page><page sequence="22">those days spent a great deal of time in cafés. Some of them, such as Miguel Hidalgo, became the stuff of myth at the Café de Manrique, while others were mere habitués. What they discussed is illustrated in a wide range of books that describe Mexican archetypes, or in novels and memoirs, such as that of Guillermo Pri eto, an author who is always worth quoting at length: "Through the thick cigarette and cigar smoke that darkened the room, you could distinguish small tables made of ordinary wood painted brown, covered with rubber fastened with brass tacks, and wicker chairs around them [...]. Look at that small table presided over by Mr. Palacios Lanzagorta, the son of one of Miguel Hidalgos illustrious companions; look at him with his dirty hat, his sickly complexion, his missing teeth, his twisted face and his novel ideas, an enthusi ast of [President Valentín Gómez] Farias and his laws on monastic vows, tithes, and public education. His pronouncements are seconded by a certain Borja, a repulsive, unkempt accountant whose lip is crossed by a scar he got in a back-alley quarrel over love. [...] This accountant curses and attacks monks, nuns, administrators and secret societies, praising [Lorenzo de] Zavala, considering [Vicente] Roca fuerte extraordinary and constantly quoting Voltaire, Pigault-Lebrun and d'Alambert." Obviously, none of these characters—or the ca fé's other clients—would be welcome in places of pi ousness and retreat; they were excessively liberal, an ticlerical and heretical. Not without reason, they had the same vice as Voltaire, whose "admirable clarity"— according to Brillant-Savarin—could be attributed to coffee, and the same could be said of the revolution ary Silvio Pellico and Alexander Pope, whose hand did not shake as he wrote, " Coffee, which makes the politician wise / And see through all things with his half-shut eyes." On both sides of the Atlantic, there were clear ly two opposing camps. In Europe, as Wolfgang Schivelbusch states, cacao was the beverage that represented status during the Ancien Régime, while coffee was considered a stimulant of the intellect and belonged to bourgeois entrepreneurs. For its part, in recently independent Mexico, cacao and caffeine afi cionados were also taking sides: cacao drinkers were conservative, centralists, monarchists, Scottish Rite Freemasons and sometimes even staunch supporters of Santa Ana; on the other hand, coffee drinkers were liberals, federalists, republicans, York Rite Freema sons and, why not tell the truth, ashamed supporters of Santa Ana, like Valentín Gómez Farias. Rivalries between cacao and caffeine drinkers were not confined to churches and cafés: they took to the streets, filled the pages of La Águila Mexicana and El Sol, and soon began to resolve themselves on the battlefields. We all know the outcome: on December 22, 1860, the cacao drinkers—along with Leonardo Márquez and cassock-wearers—were defeated in San Miguel Calpulalpan by a group of coffee drinkers led by Jesús González Ortega, Ignacio Zaragoza and Leandro Valle; and, a few years later, the executions spread to the Cerro de las Campanas, where Maximil ian, Miramón and Mejía faced the firing squad. Cacao and God were defeated; in the future only the flag of the coffee cherry would be hoisted. Translated by Clara Marin. "Abbey 1790" porcelain chocolate pot. George Jones and Sons.

Or am I wrong? The memories brought forth by hot cacao always entail a gathering, always at night—someone has just returned from a trip or is about to leave, the windows are aglow to say farewell. (It is Arthur Rimbaud who is setting off on foot for Belgium, with nothing but a piece of chocolate that his friend, Emmanuel Essarts, has given him for the trip, hoping it will give him strength). In the kitchen, pots are boiling, or rather one could say they are floating on the fire, the milk bubbling, arms beating, and as the cake dissolves at the bottom, the white becomes tinted with the color of clay, as if the pot itself were melding into the ingre dients that are being mixed within it. Such preparations sometimes lead us to thinking that chocolate, like water, can appear as three states of matter: steam, liquid or in the shape of a bar. (Few things bond delicacy and solidity as emphatically and definitively as chocolate does.) It is surprising how infrequently images or meta phors appear in the work of our poets and writers relating to a product—one is tempted to say "fruit"— that is so significant in Mexico's history and so pres ent in our daily lives. Especially during the nine teenth century, when chocolate was extraordinarily popular and was drunk morning and night, as both a stimulant and a sedative. Then again everyone knows that the Koran barely mentions camels. It is mentioned here and there, in two or three paragraphs of a story, a chronicle or a novel, but it is almost always peripheral, not the main character. Seldom does its presence shine with relative inten sity, as it does in the scene depicted by historian José N. Iturriaga, whereby on September 30, 1866, Pope Pius IX received Carlota, who was seeking help for the tottering Mexican Empire, and was utterly dis mayed when the poor woman suddenly grabbed a piece of bun, dipped it, fingers and all, into his choc olate, and then anxiously put it in her mouth, saying she was famished, as she feared everything that was being served to her had been poisoned by orders of Napoleon III. It is also strange that it was not the subject of a playful poem by José Juan Tablada, who wrote verses on mole, horchata, chiles en nogada, alfeñique sweets, and cajeta from Celaya... or of an encrypted statement by López Velarde, who probably would have qualified it as "nuptial" (chocolate beverage was commonly served at wedding banquets in those days) or perhaps as a "matchmaker" (many a cup of chocolate would have been a pretext for dates after Mass in the early-twentieth century). Poets should know enough about cooking to see the constellations of chocolate embroidered on the firmament of the nation's tablecloths. But few of them have cultivated the art of preparing and drink ing it. One of them was Carlos Pellicer who, with the same ceremonial splendor as the ancient people of his native Tabasco (the Olmecs), ground his own cacao and smoked and cured gourd cups with deer grease in order to increase the intensity of the flavor. It is therefore surprising that he never wrote a poem about it. Contrary to expectations, it is more common to find references to chocolate in the work of prose and narrative writers. For instance, in Artemio de Valle Arizpe's book Del tiempo pasado (1932) there is a beautiful fantasy, "Las damas chocolateras" about which little should be said in order not to spoil one's reading it. 94 Rafael Vargas</page><page sequence="24">One great Mexican writer who devotes sev eral pages to chocolate is Alfonso Reyes, who in his Memorias de cocina y bodega (1953) recalls that in ancient Mexico it was prepared as "a cold and bit ter beverage, different from the one that has become popular in our days, always dissolved in water. Indig enous people had no cattle, and upon the arrival of the first cows, they represented them in their paint ings as fat deer." Another is Fernando del Paso, who, in his book Dulzura y pasión de la cocina mexicana, written in Paris in collaboration with his wife in 1991, com poses a "Eulogy to Chocolate," actually a dense com pendium of chocolate's multifaceted role in various historical and literary settings, bringing to mind both Hernán Cortés (who tells the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V that the beverage grants his soldiers great vigor) and the Marquis de Sade (one of whose char acters suggests that chocolate is "the beginning of the union of love and death"). Obviously there is still much to be written on this cacao-derived product: one of the foods, along with chili and corn, which have defined the Mexican palate. One is under the impression, however, that chocolate is increasingly being relegated to the cat egory of junk food, and that its literary appreciation will not grow until we regain our appreciation for its genuine taste, if its importance as one of the main ingredients of our cuisine is not properly understood and disseminated. Nowadays, the idea of chocolate that dominates our imagination is closer to the simile that Amado Ñervo used for the grid-like streets of New York, say ing the city was like a "a great chocolate bar." The food of the gods has been industrialized. Powdered chocolate has literally pulverized the ritual of preparing and shar ing a pot of ambrosia. In supermarkets all around the world, there are stacks of thousands of bars and can dies produced in Europe and the United States. Unfortunately, most of the cacao used for this production does not come from where it was origi nally cultivated—Mexico and the Amazon Rainfor est— but rather from African nations—Ivory Coast, Ghana and Cameroon supplying seventy percent of global production—and its consumers are concen trated in a few European countries. In light of our country's decline as a leader of the chocolate world, we can at least console ourselves by reading a passage from Francisco de Quevedos El entrometido y la dueña y el soplón, which refers to the introduction of tobacco and chocolate in Europe: There came the devil of tobacco and the devil of chocolate, about whom I may have had my doubts, though I never regarded them as complete devils. They told me they had avenged the Indies against Spain, for they had done more harm by introducing among us those powders and smoke and chocolate cups and chocolate-beaters than the Catholic King had ever done through Colombus and Cortés and Almagro and Pizarro. For it was better and cleaner and more honorable to be killed by a musket ball or a lance than by snuffling and sneezing and belching and dizziness and fever; the chocolate imbibers idol ize the cup that they raise on high and adore and go into a trance over; the tobacco addicts are like Lu therans: if they take it in by smoking, they are serving their apprenticeship for hell; if in snuff, for catarrh.

I see myself in the schoolyard of the San Cosme French School. I am wearing my dark blue uniform with a white collar and frayed cuffs. Suddenly, Madame St. Louis walks towards me wearing her red wig covered by a hairnet: Tiens, ma petite, tu as gagné un choco lat, she says while her pudgy hand places in mine a tablet of Vaquita Wong chocolate. I snatch the treat and in a split second have removed the lilac wrap per with the picture of a black-and-white spotted cow. I also remove the silver foil that covers the eight squares of what to me is a unique delicacy. "Yuuum!" I exclaim as my eyes close and my taste buds perceive the wonderful flavor. How delicious! It tastes heav enly to me. One might say that at that precise mo ment angels descend from heaven and carry me up through the clouds to a paradise where cacao trees grow chocolate bars instead of leaves. Here lies my earliest memory of one of my most sinful indulgences: chocolate! As contradictory as it may seem, it is actually the French nun's fault. With out realizing it, little by little she fostered my ad diction to one of the devil's many temptations. The louder I sang Frére Jacques, Frére Jacques, dormez vous? the more I deserved a Vaquita, so I belted it out with all my soul. I was so loud they could hear me all the way in the nuns' dormitory. Then came the era of Vanguardias, that social club of the 1950s for girls and boys from well-to-do families at 16 Frontera Street; I went there not so much to see the triple-features se lected by father Pérez del Valle, or to go to its fa mous posadas where I always wanted to be picked to play the Virgin Mary, but be cause I knew that their candy store sold little "chocolate pots." So, if I had received a decent allowance that week, I would buy a pack of chocolate ciga rettes! And a choc olate bunny, wrapped in gold tin foil. If I had any money left over, I'd go back to the store and get a Turin brand nut-sprinkled "Ex otica" bar. "Mmm!" I would ex claim again, not caring if anyone saw me making a spectacle of myself. My mother had a very strange re lationship with chocolate. She did not have what I would call a very refined sense of taste. She was happy with a bar of Ibarra or La Abuelita cooking chocolate. I remember her taking big bites and gulping them down. She drank hot chocolate without removing the film. She also tended to add more chocolate than necessary when making mole. It was delicious. What my mother tru ly enjoyed was making the hot chocolate froth. I can still see her in that tiny kitchen, standing in front of the stove, leaning over the clay pot, vigorously whisking the hot chocolate. I loved watching the brown foam rise, thick and aromatic. "Can I try?" I'd ask over and over, but she didn't hear me. She was too focused, probably on her own problems. What did Doña Lola think about while frothing her hus band's hot chocolate? Maybe about the Guadalajara egg bread that he would be dunking into it, or may be she unconsciously hummed the song that was so fashionable then—"he drinks hot chocolate, he pays what he owes"—thinking of the debts that al ways had her worried. And yet the words seemed to have the opposite effect on her: they stimulated her appetite. Interestingly, one of the sayings she most often quoted was las cuentas claras y el chocolate caliente (roughly equivalent to "speedy reckonings make long friends" but referring to hot cacao). Now that I'm a grandmother, I want to learn to make the best chocolate desserts for my grandson Tomás. In order to initiate him into the pleasures of chocolate, I will begin by purchasing a box of Carlos V bars, "the chocolate emperor and the emperor of all chocolates." I will also buy him a bag of La Mar quesa chocolate coins wrapped in gold foil. I will buy five cans of cacao powder and sing, "I am healthy and strong as you can see because I drink Express choco late." I will take him to El Moro to have churros and hot chocolate. I will teach him how to say "chocolate" in several languages and finally I will make my spe cialty—chocolate mousse—with his French great great-grandmother's unique recipe.
