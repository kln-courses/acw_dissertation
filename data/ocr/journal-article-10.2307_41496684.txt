<plain_text><page sequence="1">Desert-kites of the Hemma Plateau (Hassake, Syria) P.-L. van Berg, M. Vander linden, S. Lemaitre, N. Cauwe and V. Picalause Abstract : Since 2001, the remains of 11 individual desert kites have been discovered on the eastern border of the Hemma basaltic pla- teau (Hassake, Syria). The enclosure is polygonal or sub-rectangular. One of the guide walls generally runs along the border of the pla- teau, while the other goes down to the wadi. At Hemma, as in Jordan, desert kites are generally built on a slope, balanced on a natural crest with guide walls on one side, enclosure on the other. The dating of these structures is still discussed : in Southern Syria and Jordan, some have been assigned to the Neolithic, others to the Chalcolithic or the EBA, but later dates and uses cannot be excluded. Peripheral cells have been placed at the angles of the polygon, along its lower wall or at the far end of the enclosure. No definitive solution has been reached regarding the function of these buildings but they were probably intended to accommodate animals. Some 70 carved depictions of desert kites have been discovered. Their rocky support is often used as a natural landscape. The carvings belong to the same cultural phases as the buildings, but show a more diversified typology. Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures associated with them refer to hunting, divinities or uninterpretable scenes. Similar representations discovered in Jordan often show the same stylistic characteristics as those of the Hemma, which raises the question of their possible attribution to mobile populations. Résumé : De nombreux sites archéologiques et d ' art rupestre ont été découverts depuis dix ans en bordure orientale du plateau basal- tique du Hemma (Hassake, Syrie) et le long des wadis qui l ' entaillent . Les récoltes de surface montrent que la zone est occupée du 7e millénaire à la fin de l ' époque parthe ; la période néo-assyrienne est la mieux représentée. Les vestiges archéologiques comportent des desert-kites, des cercles de pierre (non datés) et des habitats d 'époque néo-assyrienne et achéménide. Quelque 2 500 roches gravées s 'échelonnent entre le 5e/4e millénaire et le IIIe siècle de notre ère, avec deux concentrations principales sur les sites de Khishâm-2 et de Kefra. Depuis 2001, le travail de terrain est assuré par une mission syro-belge qui pratique des sondages, des prospections et des relevés de l 'art rupestre. L ' article est consacré aux desert-kites, illustrés par des structures construites et des gravures rupestres. Les vestiges de 11 desert-kites, ont été découverts sur une distance de 25 km. Celui de Khishâm-2, muni d'un enclos long de 140 m, est le plus grand et le mieux conservé. Ces constructions se présentent individuellement et non en chaînes, comme ce peut être le cas en Syrie méridionale et en Jordanie. Aucun nouvel élément de datation n 'est apparu jusqu 'ici. Les dates proposées ailleurs se répartissent géné- ralement du Néolithique au Bronze ancien, sans que des constructions et des usages plus tardifs puissent être exclus. Les enclos polygo- naux ou sub-rectangulaires sont généralement installés sur une pente, en équilibre sur une crête naturelle, murs d 'accès d 'un côté, enclos de l 'autre. Les cellules périphériques se trouvent aux angles du polygone, le long du mur le plus bas et le long du mur opposé à l 'entrée. Aucune solution définitive n 'a été atteinte en ce qui concerne l 'utilisation de ces structures sans doute destinées à accueillir des animaux. Quelque 70 représentations rupestres de desert-kites ont été découvertes. Leur support rocheux est souvent utilisé comme un paysage naturel. Ces figures appartiennent aux mêmes phases culturelles que les constructions, mais leur typologie est plus diversifiée. Les figu- res anthropomorphes et surtout zoomorphes associées renvoient tantôt à la thématique de la chasse , tantôt à des divinités ou présentent des scènes non interprétables. Des représentations similaires découvertes en Jordanie présentent souvent les mêmes caractères stylisti- ques que celles du Hemma, ce qui soulève la question de leur attribution éventuelle à des populations mobiles.

CAUWE and V. PlCALAUSE The rock art and archaeological sites of the basaltic pla- teau of the Hemma (fig. 1, upper part), in North-Eastern Syria, have been studied from 1998 to 2000 by Paul-Louis van Berg (Free University of Brussels), since 2001 by a joint Syro-Belgian mission, directed for the Belgian part by Paul- Louis van Berg, and, since 2003, for the Syrian part by Abd el-Messiah Bagdo (Department of Antiquities, Hassake)1. The Hemma plateau is located thirty kilometers north of the modern city of Hassake. It covers more than 500 km2, but, so far, only the slopes and some of the wadis that crosscut it present archaeological features. The fieldwork activity has been carried out exclusively on the eastern side, which directly faces the wadi Aweidj along which several tells have been occupied from the Neolithic up to the Parthian period2. Furthermore, it must be noted that the archaeological land- scape of this area has gained more consistency thanks to recent extensive surveys3. However, the design of these studies was focused on tells and/or their immediate surround- ings and therefore, has only scarcely touched on marginal areas. This situation, partly resulting from the quantity of impressive archaeological sites, implies that very little is known about peripheral areas and societies from an archaeo- logical perspective, although literary documents attest to their existence and role in the culture-history and politics of upper Mesopotamia4. Archaeological work on the Hemma plateau mingles excavations, rock art recordings, and survey in order to eval- uate the archaeological potential and the historical dynamics of the area. These sites thus provide a unique documentary combination of archaeological sites other than tells and of rock art, a type of human manifestation so far little known in Syria, as compared to other regions in the Near East5. This paper will explore the co-existence of desert-kites in both archaeological and rock art expressions. 1. VAN BERG et Анмо, 2002 ; VAN BERG et AL-MECHRIF, 2003. 2.

ARCHITECTURAL DESERT-KITES Since Paléorient has already published a series of impor- tant papers regarding this type of archaeological structure6, we will only briefly summarize the main issues and available data. Initially observed and documented during the 1920's by English pilots who made the first aerial pictures of the region7, desert-kites are monumental stone constructions made up of a large open polygonal enclosure and small circular or semi-cir- cular cells mainly placed at the angles of the polygon. Out of the enclosure, two, or more, long walls converge towards the entrance, forming a funnel-shaped device. The size of these monuments can extend from ten to two hundred meters, the form of the enclosure exhibiting much variability. Desert-kites are distributed throughout the Near East : estimation ranges between 700 and 800 built structures8. Dense concentrations have been found in central and southern Syria, in the Khabur basin in Syria, in northern Jordan, in the Negev and in the Sinai, as well as in northern Saudi Arabia. Other groups are known in Uzbekistan9. Except for one recorded in the first half of the century by Poidebard10, the desert-kites of the Hemma plateau discussed are the first recorded, and thus studied, in northern Syria. During the 1999 season, on the main site of Khishâm-2, in the valley of the wadi Kakhort, an affluent of the wadi Aweidj, which cuts the plateau from West to East, Paul-Louis van Berg observed a monumental desert-kite (flg. 1, lower part), while a second one appeared after careful examination of an aerial photography taken from a kite. The first one, well preserved and complete, extends on the southern slope of the Kakhort valley. Its polygonal enclosure is about 140 m long and between 80 and 40 m wide. It is opened towards the east, thus facing the alluvial plain. North of the wadi at the entrance of the valley, the remains of the second one, largely destroyed, consist of two walls and a circular cell. A survey carried out in 2002 has revealed the existence of 9 other desert-kites on the eastern border of the plateau (flg. 1 , upper part) : 2 in Khishâm- 1, 2 more in Khishâm-2, 2 in Kefra, 2 between Tell Beydar and Qasrek, and 1 in el-Bar- foïya. Due to the destructive impact of agriculture on the pla- teau, their state of conservation varies greatly, and it is likely 6.

Lower part : Khishâm-2 : desert-kite 1 (drawn by F. DEPUYDT). that several desert-kites are no longer recognizable as such in the modern landscape, if not under the form of unconnected long walls running parallel of the plateau or blocking the entrance of valleys. Actually, although one cannot really speak of chains of desert-kites as in the south Syrian and Jor- danian desert, the Hemma plateau yields an impressive con- centration of these architectural forms, located in each of the more or less deep valleys that cut up the slopes of the plateau, suggesting an extensive economic system. CHRONOLOGY The dating of desert-kites remains one of the central and most debated issues when dealing with those archaeological features. Indeed, they traditionally yield few archaeological artifacts of chrono-cultural value or organic material suitable for being radiocarbon dated. Yet, if Betts and Helms have strong arguments to push back the erection of some Jordanian desert-kites as far as the PPNB11, it is generally assumed that most of the others can be assigned to the 4th or 3rd millennium ВС12. The suggestion by Betts and Yagodin13 that some series of chained monuments could belong to prehistoric times, while those which could be assigned to historic periods appear to be mostly individual, must still be verified. Up to the present, the sites of the Hemma plateau have not modified this state of research as virtually nothing has been discovered in the test trenches dug out in the great desert-kite of Khishâm- 2. Survey yielded only a little insignificant material. Nevertheless, several buildings were erected using walls belonging to desert-kites, thus providing a terminus ante quern for those structures. This does not allow a precise dat- ing, but confirms that desert-kites were not in use when the full scale sedentary settlement of the plateau began, which apparently happened during the neo-Assyrian period14. TYPOLOGY AND MORPHOLOGY Former typologies have insisted on the morphology of the enclosures, but have put less emphasis on their relationships with the landscape15. Indeed, most Near Eastern desert-kites are first of all characteristic of steppe milieus, whereas those of the Hemma are located in a region where dry farming has been possible since the 8th millennium, an original ecological situation which must have led to some peculiarities in their mode of production and, probably, their use. The desert-kites of the Hemma are generally settled on a slope, balanced on a natural crest, the opening walls on one side, the enclosure on the other, so that it could not be immediately seen by the entering animals16. Similarly, the middle of enclosure of the main desert-kite of Khishâm-2 is lying on an excrescence of the slope, the visual outcome being virtually identical. Like- wise, the location of the circular cells seems to correspond to 11. HELMS and BETTS, 1987 : 50 ; BETTS, 1999 : 191-205. 12. ECHALLIER et BRAEMER, 1995 : 54-56. 13.

Some of the kites recorded by Betts seem actually to also conform to this pattern : BETTS, 1986 : 67-68 ; HELMS and BETTS, 1987 : 50. Likewise, most of the kites recorded in the Sinai adopt the same topographic layout : ROSEN and PEREVOLOTSKY, 1998 : 109.

PlCALAUSE regular settling procedures : we find them at the angles of the polygon, alongside its lower wall and at the far end of the enclosure, but always in position of inter-visibility. A kite with a double polygonal enclosure has been found in Khishâm-1 and two neighbouring kites between Tell Beydar and Qasrek. Note also that in some instances walls take advantage of natural screes. In two cases in Khishâm-1, built walls are interrupted where the abrupt character of the rocky scree appeared sufficient to create the expected closure. The fact that the difference of level between both sides of the scree are not very important (ca 1.5 m nowadays) suggests that the built walls were probably not very high. Three test trenches were dug in the main desert-kite of Khishâm-2 (fig. 1 , lower part) : the first one lies at the south- eastern angle, the second one at the joining point of the south- ern entrance wall, which runs parallel to the edge of the pla- teau, and of the blocking wall of the entrance, while the third trench is located at the north-eastern angle. Although limited in extension, these provide us with some further architectonic indications. First, the entrance walls, which progressively nar- row the entrance and lead inside the structure, run under the blocking wall of the entrance and were thus built before the enclosure. Second, the general plan of the enclosure has been distorted so that the junction of the walls forms an excres- cence under the shape of an acute angle, on which rests the round cell built there. This last element demonstrates that the location of the cells was planned from the very beginning of the construction process and that the desert-kites of the Hemma plateau are the outcomes of a specific architectural design, an hypothesis to be further elaborated. Helms and Betts also observed that, in the Jawa, Dhuweila and el-Azraq areas, the guide walls of chained kites were all pointing East, while those of isolated kites varied in direction, illustrating adaptations to local conditions. This appears to be also the case in the Hemma. Moreover, all the kites recorded in the Hemma belong to the polygonal and, maybe, rectangular types, and none to the star-shaped kind, as do the chained kites of the Jawa, Dhuweila and el-Azraq areas17. FUNCTION The purpose of these stone buildings also remains difficult to assess, although a consensus of opinion suggests that they were used for gathering animals in the enclosure, as clearly 17. HELMS and BETTS, 1987 : 50-52. indicated by the funnel-shaped guide walls. Moreover, as we could observe at the Hemma, diverse and complicated entrance devices indicate that these monuments primarily functioned as snares. Moreover, it has often been considered, on the basis of ethnographic parallels, that desert-kites were primarily designed as hunting enclosures, related to the gath- ering and massive killing of gazelles or other wild animals18. In this model, peripheral cells would have allowed the hunters to hide from the animals. Yet, ethnographic testimonies describe hunting traps in which the animals are pushed to ditches so that they fall and break their legs19, a feature that remains unknown in the archaeological record. Betts suggests that the difficulty of digging ditches or pits into the basalt can have led to slightly different hunting techniques20. On the basis of this discrepancy, and resorting more to eth- nographic work carried out by the British anthropologist Tim Ingold among the Saami, Echallier and Braemer have set forth an alternative model which supports the role of desert-kites in the process of domestication of wild animals21. For them, desert-kites could have been used to ease the gathering of ani- mals living in a semi-freedom in the steppe and, later on, to the herding and keeping of domestic animals like sheep or cat- tle. However, Rosen and Perevolotsky have contested the value of this hypothetical model, arguing that it does not cor- respond to the behavior of the various animals reported to be trapped in desert-kites, being various species of gazelles, oryx, ostriches or the local Equus 11 . Furthermore, the archi- tectural devices described here seem much too complex sim- ply to keep cattle, sheep or goats, for which simple scrub enclosures could easily fulfil the requirements. Yet, if these traps were conceived to hunt - and then to kill for their meat ? - as many animals as possible, the exact nature of the hunted animals remains to be determined. In this hypothesis, the most likely candidates are onagers and gazelles, which appear to be the major sources of meat during the most likely periods of construction and use of desert- kites23. For the case of gazelles, the behavior of the Mesopot- amian variant, Gazella subgutturosa 24, seems to fit well with the design of the desert-kites recorded on the Hemma plateau. 18.

Second, once a year, they migrate under the form of large dense herds rang- ing from fifty to several hundred animals25, which would be easier to drive up into the valleys of the plateau where the desert-kites were situated. Likewise, onagers and/or wild donkeys would also be a possible game, not necessarily for their meat. Indeed, as noted by Wright26, the large-scale trade movements which charac- terize the Uruk period, potentially synchronous with the desert-kites, must have required large quantities of pack ani- mals. Furthermore, it must be recalled that several administra- tive documents found in Tell Bey dar and which can be dated to the mid-third millennium ВС reinforce the major economic role and the reputation of local asses27. However, this hypoth- esis will be difficult to test since it would be unlikely to find bones in the enclosures. ROCK ART AND DESERT-KITES CARVED REPRESENTATIONS OF DESERT-KITES The additional importance of the Hemma plateau lies in the massive presence of rock art carved on blocks of the slopes28. So far, over 2 300 carved rocks have been identified all over the edge of the plateau, with a series of significant concentrations, chiefly in Kefra (1 200 rocks) and in Khishâm-2 (500 rocks). The iconographie repertoire encom- passes anthropomorphic (characters with raised arms and/or holding various objects...) and zoomorphic figures (mostly "gazelles", but also cattle, equidae, canidae...), as well as about 70 depictions of desert-kites, of which around 50 lie in Khishâm-2. Few images of desert-kites are recorded in Khishâm-1, Tell Beydar, Kefra, Umm el-Masamir and al- Rahmaniya. This presentation will focus on the carvings at Khishâm-2, since they are encompassed in a larger context that allows to better understand their specificity in the frame- work of the rock art and archaeology of the Hemma plateau. The state of conservation of the carvings is variable : one third of them are incomplete because of erosion or lichens. In 25. ROSEN and PEREVOLOTSKY, 1998 : 109. 26. WRIGHT, 2001 : 127. 27. VAN LERBERGHE, 1996a, b ; ARCHI, 1998. 28. VAN BERG, 2001a, b ; VAN BERG et PlCALAUSE, 2001. a few cases, only a small part of the original representation is still visible. Depicted in schematic plan, carvings of desert-kites are among the most ancient known map drawings29. The relative proportions of the various elements are not respected, for rea- sons most probably related to the carving technique and to the choice of analytic realism : walls are too wide, as are the peripheral cells, while entrance walls are too short. However, nothing in these depictions seems to be fortuitous. It is evident that the elements of the images have been controlled by their relationship with their rocky natural support. As we have seen, architectural desert-kites are often established according to the local topography. This disposition can also be observed in the case of the carved ones, where the rock is often compre- hended as a model of the landscape : the lines representing the enclosure walls strictly follow the limits of the rock, entrance walls and cells can also be placed on another facet of the block. Similar characteristics have been recorded for the desert-kite carvings of the Dhuweila area30. As for architecture, it is possible to set forth a typology of carved desert-kites on basis of the morphology of the enclo- sure which can be circular (4), elliptic (4), semi-elliptic (12), rectangular (4) or polygonal (12). The star-shaped type observed by Betts and Helms in the rock art of the Harra is lacking. Let us also note the existence of double desert-kites or systems of desert-kites (at least 3 occurrences, and 2 puta- tive ones) : two enclosures are linked and can share the same entrance device, as it is possibly the case in Khishâm- 1 ; sim- ilar monuments are also known elsewhere in the Near East31. Furthermore, a coherence between the various shapes of the enclosures and their size has been observed : the semi- elliptical and circular ones are generally small (between 15 and 50 cm), while the polygonal ones are larger (between 50 and 90 cm). Rectangular carved desert-kites lie in the middle of the sample (between 40 and 65 cm). It seems that this typology is not related to the parameters of the entrance devices and the cells, which present few, if no relationships with the size and form of the enclosures. Their forms could, in some instances, be related to commodities of representation or adaptation to the rock, rather than by a wish to exactly repro- duce a local real model. The number of cells varies between 0 and 8, but most of the complete carved desert-kites have between 3 and 5. They 29. Others are to be found, for instance, at the rock art site of El Hosh, upper Egypt : HUYGE, 1998 and 2001. 30. BETTS and HELMS, 1986 : plate 1.3. 31. HELMS and BETTS, 1987.

Their size ranges between 3 and 15 cm, more if an animal has been carved inside (see below). Cells are generally placed alongside the external perimeter of the enclosures, very frequently at the angles, but they are also found in the middle of rectilinear or curvilinear walls. Sometimes, a cell has been carved at an excrescence of the enclosure, as in the reality, for instance in Khishâm-2. Cells can also be placed on the external side of one of the entrance walls, at the junction of an entrance wall and the enclosure, or between both enclosures of a double desert-kite. The position of the entrance device is variable in relation to the form of the enclosure. It is generally oriented towards the upper part of the rock, towards the left, the upper left or the upper right, other possibilities being however documented from time to time. Some examples present a third wall as part of the entrance device. A few desert-kites also lack guide walls, or have only one. Indeed, real kites exhibit such a vari- ability, although it is not easy to state this at the moment for the Hemma plateau. Correspondences as well as discrepancies between archi- tectural and rock art patterns prove that the people who carved those representations were not simply reproducing what they were seeing in the landscape, but rather had an intimate knowledge of them. Likewise, groups of carved desert-kites have been recorded on several sites, and real desert-kites sometimes occur in conjunction. These elements therefore suggest that most, if not all, carved and architectural desert- kites belong to the same chronological and cultural stage of the history of the Hemma plateau. CARVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH REPRESENTATIONS OF DESERT-KITES A dearth of elements deriving from the actual archaeological desert-kite precludes dating the building and/or its use, as well as to assess its function. In this sense, the neighbouring rock art may provide us with some clues in order to bypass these pro- blems. Indeed, in some twenty cases in Khishâm-2, carved desert-kites are associated with other figures, anthropomorphic characters and/or animals, which sometimes form a scene. In rare instances elements of desert-kite walls exhibit carvings. Most zoomorphic figures can be grossly labeled "gazelles", but some others also depict cattle, canidae, felines and equidae. In some cases, it seems possible to distinguish between domestic and wild animals : for instance, several carvings show that dogs participate in the hunting and seem to drive the prey. From both chronological and interpretive points of view, the nature of the association of these figures and of the carved desert-kites is a crucial and problematic issue. Arguments of contemporaneousness rest on the examination of the patina, of style, of the carving technique and of general composition. If it is possible to demonstrate that the composition was made during one period, the coherence of the "message" is war- ranted. Conversely, if there are several phases of carving, the association between the various figures is no less significant, but raises different problems. A few selected examples will help us in this perspective. Some carved rocks seem to refer to a general hunting and / or trapping theme. On the rock KH2-F1 13 (fig. 2, upper part), a large animal is enclosed in a polygonal desert-kite, while two characters standing in the entrance device seem to prevent it from escaping. Likewise, the rock KH2-G22 (fig. 2, middle part) shows a desert-kite with three entrance walls. Between the left and central walls, a human character is standing, hold- ing an object (weapon ?). The enclosure is occupied by uniden- tified figures, besides one character holding something in the hand. Probably the most obvious association of a carved desert- kite and hunting lies in Kefra, sector F (fig. 2, lower part) : a character with a possible animal head seems to push an animal into a desert-kite, the contemporaneousness of the various fig- ures being assured by the similar carving technique used, as well as by the patina. The morphology of the horns, quite dif- ferent from the majority of other depictions of "gazelles" in the site of Kefra32, suggests that it could be a depiction of a Gazella subgutturosa. Indeed, the horns affect the form of a lyre, diver- gent from the basis of the skull and then slightly converging33. Note also that, in this case, the upper entrance wall is not com- pletely carved, but placed in such a position that it is prolonged by a natural edge of the rock. Other rocks exhibit associations between desert-kites and animals whose meaning is not obvious. The rock KH2-B37 presents a large polygonal enclosure inside which a scene takes place (fig. 3, upper part) : a large quadruped, most probably a cow, stands above a circular figure. The animal is depicted with a raised tail. These two figures seem to be more recent than the carving of the desert-kite, as suggested by their clearer patina. In the lower part, a character with a lengthened head touches the nostrils of a small caprine animal with short horns. At the bot- tom of the animal, one finds a human character with raised 32. See for instance VAN BERG et AHMO, 2002 : plates 19, 20, 27. 33. For a complete description of the morphology of the horns, see VILA, 1998 : 37-38.

The desert-kite of the KH2-G28 rock is incomplete, but the inner carved scene is still visible (fig. 3, middle part) : a character is surrounded by two caprine animals and by another unidentified one. The character holds an object linked to the head of the animal on the right. The nature of the interaction is far from clear. The rocks KH2-A3 (fig. 3, lower part) and KH2- E55 (fig. 4, upper part) bear representations of double desert- kites with cells, some of them having been enlarged in order to place figures. It is not possible to identify what is represented inside the central cell of the rock A3, but in the right one and on the rock E55, one can easily identify horned quadrupeds. Throughout the sample, only animals are depicted in cells. Last, carved desert-kites are sometimes associated with figures whose identification may be assessed through analogy with well-known Mesopotamian iconography. The rock KH2-F68 presents a large desert-kite with two, or perhaps three, entrance walls (fig. 4, middle part). The right part of the rock is collapsed. Inside the enclosure, one can distinguish three zoomorphic figures and a human character ; left, proba- bly a dog ; right, a character with raised arms standing above an unidentifiable quadruped, perhaps a canid34. The line link- ing the arm of the character to the head of the animal could be interpreted as a tether. This element can be seen on other rocks in Khishâm-2, most notably a character standing on a bull (KH2-E1 : fig. 4, lower part). According to the classical con- ventions of Mesopotamian iconography, it is tempting to rec- ognize those standing characters as divinities, each of them being identified according to its attribute-animal. For instance, the bull is related to Adad, the storm-god, whilst the lion is associated either with Ishtar or Ningirsu, the dog being the sacred animal of the goddess Gula35. If such identifica- tions are correct, they furthermore give us a terminus post quern for the date of these carvings since the oldest attesta- tions of an anthropomorphic character, probably a divinity, standing above an animal seem to date from the first centuries of the third millennium BC (Diyala culture). NEAR EASTERN PARALLELS Rock art depictions of desert-kites are not numerous and, as far as we know, the Hemma plateau provides the largest 34. Unless this iconographie indecision echoes a voluntary, semantic- like, association of both animals since, "as far as the Sumerians were con- cerned, the lion was grouped together with dogs and wolves as a canine rather than a feline" (BLACK and GREEN, 1992 : 1 19). 35.

For instance, in the Azraq basin (eastern Jordan), Betts and Helms have found several carvings of desert-kites similar to ours from both tech- nical and stylistic points of view. One observes the same use of the rock surfaces for the disposition of the various architec- tonic elements. Some of those carved desert-kites are also associated with zoomorphic figures, probably ostriches, placed at the entrance and inside the enclosure. On the basis of the date proposed for structures of the star-shaped type, the authors consider that the corresponding petroglyphs could be of prehistoric date36. The close similarity bringing together some of the kite-carvings found in the Harra and those of the Hemma suggest a similar dating and raises the question of the stylistic diffusion and, subsequently, of population move- ments. This could support the hypothesis that at least some of kite carvings were made by moving populations. Another group of carved desert-kites, but in a different style and technique, is known in Jordan. One of those, known as the carving of the Hani Cairn, is dated by means of Safaitic inscriptions, somewhere between the 2nd century ВС and the 2nd century AD37. One can observe characters with raised arms in the entrance and some animals, some of them may have horns, moving towards the enclosure. As noted by Echallier and Braemer38, nothing allows us to state that this is a hunting scene as the characters are not armed. DISCUSSION AND PERSPECTIVES Carved desert-kites are but one facet of the relations between humans and animals displayed in the rock art of the Hemma plateau. Besides a quantity of isolated representations of "gazelles" of which the meaning is still unknown, numer- ous depictions of hunting scenes, involving "gazelles", lions or fantastic animals, suggest that hunting was a significant practice for the people who carved them39. Of course, this somewhat vague thematic identification does not imply that these manifestations constitute a global monolithic unit. Quite the contrary, several stylistic elements and comparisons with classical Mesopotamian iconography demonstrate the long life of this production, ranging from the 5th/4th millennium 36.

See for instance illustrations in VAN BERG et al., 2003, especially plate 4, middle left and lower right. ВС up to the very first centuries AD40. Yet, be it during one particular period or not, hunting evidently appears as one of the privileged themes. In this perspective, the building of desert-kites and their synchronous representations surely con- stitute promising elements. First, the close connection observed between the rock sur- face and the carved desert-kites is seldom in the rock art of the Hemma plateau. At this moment, it is difficult to state if this specificity is related to the nature of the representation, or if it expresses a cultural phase, characterized by a particular adap- tive mentality and/or behaviour towards the surrounding land- scape. Second, the multiplicity of figures, as well as the depic- tions of divinities in desert-kites reinforces the global impres- sion that these monuments were not only very significant for those who build and carved them, but were also integrated in their religious thought. Evidently, the crucial point lies in the dating of both archaeological and carved desert-kites. As we have seen, there is no definitive argument for the moment. If the neo- Assyrian settlement of the valley provides a clear terminus ante quem, a terminus post quern is much more difficult to assess. So far, neither the monuments, nor their representa- tions have been dated. Therefore, we assign them tentatively to the fourth or the third millennium in accordance with the most commonly accepted dates, but an older date can not be excluded. Only further exploration, especially test trenches will help us to clarify this point, essential for the understand- ing of monuments which obviously have a particular signifi- cance for the culture history of this specific ecological niche and, hence, of northern Mesopotamia.
