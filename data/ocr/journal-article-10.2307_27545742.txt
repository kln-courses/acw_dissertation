<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTS AND LETTERS THE USES AND ABUSES OF ROMANTICISM THEODORE ZIOLKOWSKI When Nietzsche, in the second of his Untimely Meditations, addressed himself to the uses and abuses of that knowledge of history on which the nineteenth century so greatly prided itself, he observed that a sterile and pedantic academicism was gradually atrophying any productive sense of the past. Surveying the field of literary studies today, one might conclude that, mutatis mutandis, something similar is happening, if "theory" is substituted as a new shibboleth replacing yesterday's "his tory." For the past twenty years romanticism has provided the favorite testing ground?not to say playground or battlefield?of literary theory in Europe as well as the United States. But while theory has thrived, it is not evident from three recent books that our understanding of European romanticism has progressed greatly as a consequence. In his 1966 inaugural lecture at the University of Z?rich Paul de Man observed that "the comparative study of European literature is still in its beginnings." For more than twenty years de Man dedicated much of his energy to the attempt to better that situation. Seven of his essays, pub lished from 1960 to 1979, plus two new ones written especially for the volume, make up The Rhetoric of Romanticism, the last book de Man published before his death. (The essays are fleshed out to a full-length book by the inclusion of one hundred pages from de Man's Harvard dis sertation, "Image and Emblem in Yeats" [I960]; that section, which does not obviously belong in a book on romanticism, will not be discussed here. ) De Man denies at the outset that his essays display either "dialectical progression or, ultimately, historical totalization." Indeed he even makes a virtue of necessity: "By stating the inevitability of fragmentation in a mode that is itself fragmented, one restores the aesthetic unity of man ner and substance that may well be what is in question in the historical study of romanticism." (Such justifications always remind me of a remark by the late Professor Bernhard Blume, of Harvard and La Jolla, apropos Paul de Man, The Rhetoric of Romanticism. Columbia University Press, 1984. x + 328 pages. $22.50; Jerome J. McGann, The Romantic Ideology: A Critical Investiga tion.

The logical corollary, Blume quipped, would be that the only way to render the ennui of modern society would be to write a truly boring novel.) However that may be, de Man continued to believe that it is still too early for grand syntheses and that we are doomed to remain "trapped yet longer in the labyrinth of individual interpretations." (Note the image of entrapment.) Accordingly his essays are restricted in every case to the analysis of individual works by specific romantic writers, and he makes a concession to synthesis only to the extent that poems or writers from different literatures are frequently coupled for comparison and contrast. Despite his reluctance to generalize, several of the pieces exemplify de Man's conviction that "the affinity of later poets with Rousseau . . . can well be considered to be a valid definition of romanticism as a whole." Thus the first essay compares passages from La Nouvelle H?lo?se, book 6 of The Prelude, and H?lderlin's elegy "Heimkunft," in all of which is depicted the transition from an earthly and material nature to one that could be called mental and celestial. The analysis exposes the tensions characteristic of texts describing "the ascent of a consciousness trapped within the contradictions of a half-earthly, half-heavenly nature ... to ward another level of consciousness, that has recovered 'cette paix in t?rieure . . . perdue depuis si longtemps.' " (Note again the theme of entrapment.) "The Image of Rousseau in the Poetry of H?lderlin" cul minates in a splendid interpretation of the hymn "Der Rhein," in which Rousseau appears as "the man of language" as opposed to the Prome thean hero who precedes him and is associated only with action. Accord ing to de Man, H?lderlin saw in Rousseau "a man who, in reaffirming the ontological priority of consciousness over the sensuous object, put the thought and the destiny of the West back onto its authentic path." The long reading of Shelley's "The Triumph of Life" ("Shelley Disfigured") might well have been subtitled "Shelley's Image of Rousseau." The "un easy mixture" of sensibility and violence that de Man senses underlying Rousseau's writings parallels the thematic concern of Shelley's lengthy fragment with its tension between consciousness and power. De Man presses on to conclude that Rousseau's disfigured appearance in "The Triumph of Life"?notoriously he first appears to Shelley in the Apen nine hills as "an old root which grew/To strange distortion out of the hillside"?thematizes reading as an act of disfiguration that resists the aestheticizing and monumentalizing tendencies of romantic historicism. A second cluster of essays is grouped around Wordsworth. "Words worth and H?lderin" deals with that "experience of the temporal relation between the act and its interpretation" that de Man regards, again de</page><page sequence="3">278 ARTS AND LETTERS spite his professed reluctance to generalize, as one of the main themes of romantic poetry. De Man's reflection on act and interpretation in Words worth's poem on "The Boy of Winander" (The Prelude, book 5) and H?lderlin's "Mnemosyne" convinces him that "we cannot avoid the inter pretive task left us by our romantic precursors if, for our part, we would achieve a historical significance." "Autobiography as De-Facement" seeks to demonstrate by an unpersuasively short reading of Words worth's Essays upon Epitaphs the currently fashionable (and question able) assumption that autobiography is not merely a genre or mode but a figure of understanding common to all texts. In "Wordsworth and the Victorians" de Man deconstructs the facile opposition poet-philosopher by showing that Wordsworth's texts display coherent lexical continuities as well as word-sequences that result in near-total chaos. This incom patibility, which forces the reader in contradictory directions, has caused critics to respond to Wordsworth in manners?whether ethical or aes thetic?that evade the tension that de Man regards as characteristic of his work. "Landscape in Wordsworth and Yeats," based on meticulous readings of "Composed by the Side of Grasmere Lake" and "Coole Park and Ballylee," demonstrates at de Man's brilliant best that both poems tolerate two distinct interpretations that depend on totally divergent uses of landscape?as natural analogical image as well as emblematic key. In "Anthropomorphism and Trope in Lyric" meditations on a passage from Nietzsche introduce an analysis of the "specular" relationship be tween Baudelaire's poems "Correspondances" and "Obsession"?a struc ture that unmasks for de Man the mirrorlike relationship that obtains between any text and our reading of it. (The pretentious term specular, through which de Man asserts a thematic generalization while denying the intention to do so, is vastly overused and should have been edited out of the volume.) The last study, "Aesthetic Formalization in Kleist," uti lizes Schiller's aesthetic theory to expose what de Man regards as the violence underlying the romantic ideal of aesthetic perfection that Hein rich von Kleist was allegedly discussing in his great essay ?ber das Mar ionettentheater. This late study epitomizes how de Man approached problems of romanticism in his greatest maturity as a critic. By the end of Kleist's essay, de Man argues, "the word Fall has been overdetermined in a manner that stretches it from the theological Fall to the dead pendulum of the puppet's limbs to the grammatical declension of nouns and pronouns (what we call, in English, the grammatical case)" with the result that any composite word that includes Fall acquires "a disjunctive plurality of meanings." De Man supports his argument by referring to Kleist's essay ?ber die allm?hliche Verfertigung der Gedan ken beim Reden ("On the Gradual Fabrication of Thoughts While Speaking"), where, he says, "the memorable tropes that have the most</page><page sequence="4">ARTS AND LETTERS 279 success (Beifall) occur as mere random improvisation (Einfall) at the moment when the author has completely relinquished any control over his meaning and has relapsed (Zuruckfall) into the extreme formaliza ron, the mechanical predictability of grammatical declensions (F?lle)." But F?lle, as de Man triumphantly glosses in the final paragraph of his essay, "of course, also means in German 'trap,' the trap which is the ultimate textual model of this and of all texts, the trap of an aesthetic education which inevitably confuses dismemberment of language by the power of the letter with the gracefulness of a dance." This passage exem plifies perfectly de Man's deconstructive technique, which moves from the surface meaning of the text (aesthetic perfection) through the hidden implications of the language to expose "the anamorphic transformations of tropes"?"the ultimate trap, as unavoidable as it is deadly." This brilliant and seductive reading gives the final elegant flourish to the theme of entrapment that de Man has been elaborating throughout the volume?and is utterly wrong. Not implausible, not unconvincing, not unpersuasive. Wrong! For this entire conclusion, which constitutes the rhetorical highpoint of the book, is based on a simple grammatical error, a misreading of the German. The word F?lle, namely, does not mean in German "trap"; it is nothing but the plural form of der Fall. The word for trap is die Falle; and though separated only by an umlaut, the two words have been etymologically distinct at least since Old High German: they are different in gender, and they have separate declen sions. There is simply no way in which Kleist's passage could have the implications that de Man attributes to it. Moreover it is not just the last paragraph that is unacceptable: the entire preceding argument is mis leading because the series of composite words that de Man cites as "anamorphic transformations of tropes" do not all occur in Marionetten theater (e.g., Fall in the sense either of the biblical Fall or of grammatical case), and they do not occur at all in the other essay, which is adduced as proof. (Only Fall in the sense of a legal case or situation can be found there.) Clearly de Man has been ensnared in a misreading, toward which he constructs his entire argument, by his own fervent desire to detect a trap in Kleist's texts. Now I realize that my objection to de Man's deconstructive playful ness is based on what I was once informed by an indignant graduate student is "only a fact." I have also been accused ( quite an accusation for someone with my surname!) of "Teutonic pedantry" by a well-known British critic in whose manuscript I had the temerity to point out a sim ple lexical error that undermined his reading of Heidegger. Yet I am still made uncomfortable by linguistic mistakes and remain unpersuaded by arguments, no matter how captivating, that are based on factual er rors. That is precisely the reason for my discomfort with de Man's read</page><page sequence="5">280 ARTS AND LETTERS ings?and, further, with the effect they may have on followers who ac cept them unquestioningly. For the errors noted above are symptomatic of a tendency among many deconstructionists to extrapolate too readily and too capriciously?not to say irresponsibly?on the basis of inade quate evidence. De Man's "Anthropomorphism and Trope," for instance, is based on a definition of truth that occurs in Nietzsche's essay ?ber Wahrheit und L?ge ("On Truth and Lying"): "Ein bewegliches Heer von Metaphern, Metonymien, Anthropomorphismen." De Man, having pointed out the apparent opposition between "metonymy" and "anthro pomorphism," concedes that perhaps Nietzsche is just being casual in his terminology: "but then, opportunities to encounter technical tropo logical terms are so sparse in literary and philosophical writing that one can be excused for making the most of it when they occur." (Note: they are sparse only when one limits one's reading to romantic and post romantic writers.) De Man construes the phrase as "a mobile army of tropes"?a translation that, by asserting "the complicity of epistemology and rhetoric, of truth and trope," has the effect of turning "this alliance into a battle." But in order to accomplish this deconstructive opposition de Man must do violence to Nietzsche's text, which he has quoted so selectively as to distort it completely. If he had gone on to cite the suc ceeding phrase?"kurz eine Summe von menschlichen Relationen"?it would have been obvious that Nietzsche was using the word Heer in its second principal meaning of "host"?not a mobile army with military implications of violence but a variable host or "sum of human relations." The second reading, in turn, establishes the connection between anthro pomorphism and metaphor, a relationship that Nietzsche takes pains to clarify in his explanation that metaphor is the attempt of human beings to transform nervous stimuli ( which he calls primary metaphors ) into terms comprehensible to other human beings (which he calls secondary metaphors). In short there is absolutely no need to read inconsistency or military tension into Nietzsche's text. De Man is able to achieve his effect only by a willful distortion of a short fragment of the text with the im plication that his argument is supported by Nietzsche's authority. A similar distortion occurs in the opening essay, which seizes upon two lines from a long poem by H?lderlin to define H?lderlins concep tion of the poetic image. In this case de Man is concerned with the apparent illogicality of the metaphoric relationship between "words" and "flowers" that are said by H?lderlin in a vivid passage to "originate." De Man, however, in his preoccupation with two lines only and his neglect of the remaining 160 lines of the elegy Brot und Wein, obscures the point that the key word Wort occurs three times in an ascending se quence of metaphors leading from "das str?mende Wort" by way of "es w?chst schlafend des Wortes Gewalt" to the final exclamation: "Nun,</page><page sequence="6">ARTS AND LETTERS 281 nun m?ssen daf?r Worte, wie Blumen, entstehn." By this point an anal ogy between words and nature has been established that legitimizes the metaphoric relationship that de Man regards as illogical. Paul de Man was a learned and imaginative reader, capable of teasing rich and unexpected meanings out of familiar texts; and for this chal lenge to our thinking we must be grateful to him. De Man at his best can provoke us into a reappraisal of specific texts; but The Rhetoric of Ro manticism teaches us very little about romanticism. Instead we learn a great deal about de Man's theory of rhetoric, which is based upon a bleak view of literature as a threatening realm of discrete and fragmen tary texts disfigured by an underlying violence in which the unwary reader is entrapped. Jerome McGann does not cite de Man's essays in his "critical investi gation" The Romantic Ideology. But if he had read de Man?or Derrida, or even some of the seminar papers being written these days in many graduate schools?he could hardly have supported his principal thesis. Defining ideology according to the western Marxian tradition as "a co herent or loosely organized set of ideas which is the expression of the special interests of some class or social group," McGann argues that "the scholarship and criticism of Romanticism and its works are dominated by a Romantic Ideology, by an uncritical absorption in Romanticism's own self-representation." He proposes to expose this ideology under which other critics read?and thus misread?romanticism by using Heinrich Heine's The Romantic School as a model for literary analysis because "Heine's critique of Romanticism sees its ideology as historically removed, as a consciousness with which Heine can no longer identify." McGann begins by surveying several "normative" theories of roman ticism that he regards as contaminated by unthinking acceptance of the romantic ideology. Thus Lovejoy's despair, in his essay "On the Discrim ination of Romanticisms," does not stem from a rejection of received opinion; instead he is pained by the irreconcilable contradictions among accepted views that seem plausible to him. Wellek's triad of imagination, organic nature, and symbolic poetry represents for McGann a compro mise of id?es re?ues that lends itself too easily to trivialization. Abrams's grand scheme in Natural Supernaturalism is unacceptable because Abrams's understanding of romanticism is so somber that it cannot ac commodate a figure like Byron. Finally Morse Peckham's view is dis credited because it attributes such a central role to Hegel. The problem with our understanding of romanticism, McGann summarizes, is that we have uncritically accepted "the Une of Coleridge and the line of Hegel," wrongly regarding them as critical analyses of romanticism rather than as expressions of romantic ideology itself. To rid ourselves of this distorting ideological filter inherited from</page><page sequence="7">282 ARTS AND LETTERS romanticism, McGann proposes a dialectical approach borrowed from Heine that assumes "an antithetical but non-Romantic point of view toward its subject" and, rather than seeking a romantic reconciliation of discordant materials, attempts to maintain contradictions in "an enlight ening conflict." Armed thus with Heine, McGann takes up Wordsworth as the normative and in every sense exemplary romantic in order to ex pose "the grand illusion of every Romantic poet"?the notion that poetry or consciousness can liberate us from history and culture. ( De Man also indicts this notion as "one of the most seductive, powerful, and deluded topoi of the idealist and romantic period.") He then moves on to an analysis of Coleridge with the aim of illuminating the romantic use of allegory as the poetical form "associated with a divided or alienated consciousness." McGann's most productive contribution can be seen in his thoughts on the phases of English romanticism. McGann divides poetic works into two categories : "primary" ones that are immediate and untroubled by dialectical tensions; and "secondary" ones characterized by a questioning attitude toward their own ideals that produces a "romantic" despair. In English romanticism McGann distinguishes three different phases of these respectively visionary and revisionist relationships. From 1789 to 1807-8 Blake moved from "primary" works like The Marriage of Heaven and Hell to works like Milton and lerusalem, in which the "secondary" characteristic of self-doubt is evident. In their "primary" phase from 1797 to 1807 Coleridge and Wordsworth were already appreciably self critical in comparison to Blake, with the result that their later poetry advanced into a "secondary" phase marked by elements of despair (e.g. Coleridge's "Limbo" and "Nature"). The third phase from 1808 to 1824, dominated by Byron, is already so profoundly revisionist that it can be defined only in negative terms of nihilism, cynicism, and anarchism. Convinced that the finest poetry of the later English romantics was written in a period of intense reaction, McGann devotes the later chap ters of his book to a rapid survey of Shelley's idealism, Byron's sensa tionalism, and Keats's aestheticism as vehicles of cultural analysis and critique. McGann's approach has much to recommend it?that is, to recognize romanticism, whether English or European, as a historical phenomenon and to appraise it within its own context but not according to its own terms and self-understanding. This being said, however, I find it difficult to guess to whom McGann is bringing his gospel, which in the 80s can hardly be news any more. McGann's "critical investigation" gives the impression of having been written by someone who has been brooding fitfully for twenty years and is suddenly jolted awake by his own cries at ghosts from the past: Love joy! Wellek! Abrams! One can imagine as</page><page sequence="8">ARTS AND LETTERS 283 profiting readers, at least of the cursory theoretical chapters, only those provincial students of English literature who have been so totally iso lated from developments outside their field that they have not attended to the important critical trends in Paris and Frankfurt and their Amer ican outposts during the past two decades. Paul de Man and his not in considerable group of followers have devoted formidable?indeed often excessive?ingenuity to the deconstruction of romantic ideologies. Mean while, on another front altogether, a similar effort has been undertaken by the practitioners of what the Germans call Ideologiekritik, an enter prise derived, like McGann's, from western Marxism and elaborated by such thinkers as Mannheim, Horkheimer, Adorno, Habermas, and the Frankfurt School. Over fifteen years ago Erwin H?lzle published an ex haustive history of the movement (Idee und Ideologic Eine Zeitkritik aus universalhistorischer Sicht, 1969); and six years later Alfred Heuss opened his Ideologiekritik: ihre theoretischen und praktischen Aspekte (1975) with the assertion that "ideological criticism is today in full sway." Ideological criticism in both Germany and the United States has devoted itself extensively to the analysis of ideology in literature, including spe cifically romanticism; and it has been ably assisted in this effort by the proponents of reception theory. No one who has kept up with criticism and theory in Europe during the past twenty years can possibly be over whelmed by the novelty of an ideological critique of romanticism? especially one with such a sketchy philosophical foundation. More original is McGann's cooptation of Heine as a critical model. It is easy to appreciate why a scholar who regards Byron as "perhaps the single most important figure in the history of European Romanticism" would be attracted to the brilliant and irreverent German poet who offers the closest continental analogy to the British impresario of Weltschmerz. But McGann does not seem to realize how deeply he is ensnared (to use de Mans image) in his own ideology: for Heine's ambivalence toward romanticism is itself a generational attitude shared by such European contemporaries as M?rim?e, Gogol, and others who came to their literary maturity between romanticism and realism?who were all entranced, on the one hand, by the allure of romanticism and yet, on the other, were unable to accept uncritically the very modes and moods that they had embraced so fully in their earliest works. In this sense Heine's "critique" is as profoundly ideological as that of Coleridge or Hegel. It is simply an ideology more congenial to McGann. Heine's whipping boy in The Romantic School was his former pro fessor, the literary historian-translator-critic August Wilhelm Schlegel (not his brother Friedrich, the theorist of romantic irony). If McGann had set out to invent a whipping boy for his own purposes, he could hardly have done better than to imagine Geoffrey Thurley, whose intel</page><page sequence="9">284 ARTS AND LETTERS ligent, philosophically knowledgeable, and rather old-f ashionedly spec ulative book The Romantic Predicament embodies much more effec tively than recent American, French, or German criticism the kind of ideology that McGann is attacking. Thurley begins with the assumption that modernist criticism has left us with a distorted view of romanticism, which needs to be corrected by a "socio-historical" approach that "ac cepts the historical actuality of Romanticism and understands that to analyse Romantic art in its forms and intentions is to explain its his torical situation and vice versa." Thurley disagrees sharply with the "dissociation-of-sensibility critics" who assume that romantic art intro duced an aesthetic phase that fell away from the high ideals of earlier creation "not through historical evolution . .. but through false intellec tual models." His essential disagreement with McGann becomes clear when he argues that direct lines of continuity involve us in the romantic predicament and that therefore the modernist theory of language and art, which would seek to differentiate sharply between romanticism and modernism, amounts to "the greatest fallacy of recent cultural history." Thurley begins by examining one of the principal charges leveled against romanticism by its modernist detractors?that romantic sub jectivism represents "a sudden collapse into self-indulgent egocentricity by men no longer capable of achieving the 'objective' strength of earlier artists." Thurley suggests that we need to differentiate between sub jectivity (the condition in which all art is born and experienced) and subjectivism ( the attitude toward the purpose and content of writing in any given historical phase). Pope strikes us as being more "objective" than Wordsworth simply because his thematic material is different: "Pope is working upon objective contents concerned with what is true of man as a social being rather than as a private individual." As the condi tions of life changed in the late eighteenth century, the more advanced artists realized that the so-called "objective" themes of Augustan liter ature had gone dead on them. When subjectivity, in turn, entered the realm of aesthetic structure as its new content, subjectivism became "the only authentic objectivity of the period." Far from being a bourgeois retreat from the social and objective realm to the private and subjective, therefore, romantic subjectivism "constituted a proper response to the changed condition in which Western man lived in the late eighteenth century." Thurley provides a similar reappraisal of the "paucity of verbal tex ture" with which F. R. Leavis and his followers reproached romantic writing. In contrast to such seventeenth-century poets as Herrick, who poeticize meaning by an exercise of subjectivity, the romantic writer makes the "thing" itself into a symbol. "Meaning is carried not by agreed social convention, but by the forms of the everyday things we experience</page><page sequence="10">ARTS AND LETTERS 285 in common." Accordingly the characteristic of a poem by Wordsworth, in contrast to one by Herrick, is not so much the celebration of an experi ence as rather "the apprehension of the kind of significance such experi ences have for us." These thoughts lead Thurley to redefine romanticism as "the crisis of that moment at which our values?our sense of meaningfulness?suf fered an unalterable shift from the realm of structure to that of content." Meaning, which had hitherto been regarded as something immanent within the beholding mind, became itself an object of study when Kant postulated the mind's constructive faculties as a consolation in the face of skepticism. The loss of fixed meaning in the world, in turn, neces sitated the loss of any commonly acknowledged goal of life?or liter ature. Accordingly in romanticism the traditional quest romance?hav ing lost its faith in the grail, or the flag, or the perfect woman, or any other ideal?turns into a goalless voyage from nowhere to nowhere. The example that Thurley analyzes is Childe Harold, but he might equally well have cited any number of Bildungsromane from German roman ticism. With this loss of fixed meaning alienation became "the hidden content of all poetry." Traditionally the artist had been able to assume his unity with the society to which he was obligated. According to Rousseau, eighteenth-century man gradually was divorced by historical circum stances from his role as a citizen and became increasingly a prisoner of societal mechanisms. Both metaphysical (Fichte) and sociological (Marx) alienation emerged from this historical period as a result of the schism between the man of good will and the new facts of political life. Aliena tion, in turn, produced a shift in the traditional literary contents. The loss of political, military, and religious dimensions rendered the tradi tional materials of literature unavailable to the poet of good faith. Hence the poet's interests shifted from the public to the personal: Wordsworth was chiefly preoccupied with the question of the poet's function, his role, his power, his obligations. This crisis of consciousness, Thurley argues, rather than disaffection with society as such, underlies romantic despair. Byron became the great European model for the political alienation ex perienced by many of his contemporaries. Thurley goes on to suggest that the Victorians did not advance be yond the level attained by Byron and the romantics. As a result the tension and excitement of discovery are lacking from their efforts. In France, by way of contrast, an avant-garde emerged, basing itself not on such French models as Hugo and Lamartine but on early romanti cism as transmitted by Poe, with which it was linked by the shared theme of absent or lost experience. Thurley boldly suggests that Kipling, Alain Fournier, and Robert Frost all exploit the devices developed by roman</page><page sequence="11">286 ARTS AND LETTERS tics for presenting the absolute which is the true point of aspiration in all art. Proust appears as the final rumination upon these basic themes. The Romantic Predicament is an opinionated, chauvinistic, almost ar rogantly self-confident?and thoroughly delightful?book. How can one not be sympathetically disposed toward a critic who calls Lacan's "end less discourses" little more than "an intellectual plaything for a bored bourgeois intelligentsia with revolutionary aspirations" and who labels Foucault's view "fantastical?the kind of philosophical rococo that fi nally overtakes any long established view (in this case the kind of Heg elianism that ran the gauntlet of Marxism)." But because the book's energy comes largely from its reactions against other critics, Thurley misses opportunities to make use of writers who have taken a similar philosophical approach to romanticism?notably M. H. Abrams but also E. D. Hirsch, Thomas McFarland, James Engell, and many others. In ad dition Thurley's curmudgeonly (and fundamentally anti-German) pose prevents him from realizing how extensively his arguments could be supported by German literature of the romantic age. (For instance Fichte has virtually an intellectual patent on romantic subjectivism as Thurley defines and uses the term; Novalis is close to Thurley's Cole ridge; M?rike is in many senses the equivalent of his Keats.) Method ologically eclectic, Thurley assumes "the common sense code of 'bour geois' humanism, dispensing with the more ponderous and ridiculous periphrases by which Eagleton, Foucault and others have tried to replace the 'subject.'" The product of a well-educated and elastic mind, the book delights the reader with unusual and unexpected associations: "as Gorgias?and Hitler?demonstrated, the wrong case can be argued as persuasively as the right." The classical Japanese haiku poet Basho "is certainly clearer and more coherent than Coleridge" as a literary the oretician. All in all, however, the reader regrets in all three of these books the lost opportunities. One would have liked to hear Thurley argue with McGann about Marx and Byron or with de Man about Rousseau and Wordsworth. We could use a more thorough explication of Ideologie kritik than McGann offers and a book in which de Man's insights were not vitiated by his excesses. But the missed opportunities are sympto matic of a larger problem, not just in the study of European romanticism but in literary scholarship generally. For in all of these works roman ticism is not the subject but merely the occasion. Indeed McGann con cedes in his preface that his topics would have been drawn from other periods had he been educated as a Restoration scholar or medievalist. No, in all three cases romanticism is being used to the point of abuse? for the exercise of rhetorical analysis, for Ideologiekritik, and for the defense of bourgeois humanism. As a result all three authors remain</page><page sequence="12">ARTS AND LETTERS 287 essentially within their own citation cartels, not taking issue with the positions represented by the others and, for the most part, preaching to the converted. If history recovered from the hypertrophy that Nietzsche diagnosed a century ago?to go on, to be sure, to cliometrics, psychohistory, and other problematical permutations?then there is hope for literary studies as well. Perhaps the next generation of literary scholars will turn to Eu ropean romanticism as Nietzsche urged the return to history?not as an abstract model of theory but as a cultural phenomenon, vivid in its varie gation and yet vibrant in its integrity.</page></plain_text>
