It marks a shift of the center of Ming politics and administration from the Forbidden City to the Park, and the begin- ning of the emperor's twenty-five-year isolation from the bureaucracy. From 1542 until the end of the reign, he continued to rule the empire through a small group of advisors who were granted access to the re- stricted area of the Park. Meanwhile, he devoted himself to a pursuit of immortality by means of Daoist cultivation. Despite its political sig- nificance in mid-sixteenth-century China, West Park is little known to us. Why did the Jiajing emperor prefer it to some other location? What kind of environment did he choose to be his permanent residence? How did he change it over the course of his residency? What do these changes tell about his exceptionally long seclusion there? Shen Defu ítlfêíí (1578-1642) offers thoughts on these questions in his book Wanli yehuo bian HBSPÂIIí. Shen believes that the Jiajing emperor grew to dislike the Forbidden City after a visit to his former princedom in Anlu Huguang ífflSf (present Hubei) in 1539. The immediate cause of his withdrawal was, however, the assassination at- tempt of 1 542. 1 On the night of November 27, a group of palace maids attempted to strangle the emperor with a silk cord while he was sleep- ing in the palace.

WAN death, however, their brutal act was exposed.2 The palace maids and implicated concubines were swiftly executed; the seriously injured em- peror was, after some delay, rescued. Shen suggests that the emperor was terrified by the thought that some of the maids, especially those who may have been unjustly executed, would become malicious ghosts. Therefore, he decided to move out of the Forbidden City.3 Shen fur- ther proposes that he decided to live in the Yongshou Palace in West Park because of its auspicious history. That palace had originally been the princely residence of the Yongle emperor (1403-1424). Un- like the Forbidden City where most of the Ming emperors lived and died, it had not witnessed the death of any emperor or concubine since the Yongle period. It was, therefore, considered an auspicious place to inhabit.4 Shen's account, though convincing as far as it goes, does not explain why the Jiajing emperor undertook extensive changes at West Park and secluded himself there so completely. This article examines the program of construction at West Park during the Jiajing emperor's rule and explores the extent to which changes in the Park's physical and cultural environment were related to his continued seclusion. My argument is that the emperor's choice of permanent residence was closely related to his lifelong belief in Daoism, which included pursuit of physical immortality.5 Through ex- 2 The palace maids strangled the emperor with a cord, but wrongly knotted the cord in the process. At this critical moment, one of the palace maids changed her mind and went to inform the empress about the incident. The empress thus led a group of palace guards to rescue the emperor and ordered all the involved palace maids and concubines to be caught and execut- ed. This assassination attempt is often stated as having taken place in the night of the 21st day of the 10th mo. (November 27, 1542). However, Zhouzai E&amp;Üic records the confession of one of the assassins, Yangjinying who claimed that it occurred in the mao #P period, i.e., 5am to 7am, November 28; Zhang He (b. 1507), ZJiouzai (Congshu jicheng xubian edn.; Taibei: Xinwenfeng chubanshe, 1989, vol. 18) 2, p. 40.

I begin by introducing the idea of immortal lands as it was found among the Ming elite. Then we have an outline of the environment of West Park, as well as the Jiajing emperor's Daoist beliefs before 1542. The main analysis there treats the way the emperor turned West Park into an immortal land. In particular, this section discusses the many con- struction works undertaken and rites and ceremonies performed during his residence. A comparison of the Park before the 1540s with the Park subsequently will provide clues to the emperor's objectives.6 IMMORTAL LANDS Ming-era concepts of immortals and immortal lands need to be understood before West Park can be properly considered in the context of the Jiajing court. The term immortal or xian ÍÚ' refers to individuals who were often seen as having gained an existence free of death.7 The quest for immortality had been one of the main goals of religious Dao- ism (hereafter simply termed Daoism) from the time it was formulated around the first century ad.8 In Tang times, there had been a general understanding that everything that had form possessed a Daoist nature.9 The possession of a Daoist nature enabled an ordinary man with suffi- cient faith and self-cultivation to undergo a spiritual and physical trans- formation, reaching a life beyond the mundane effects of yin and yang , and enjoying longevity and immortality.10 Immortals were thought to 6 In this issue of Asia Major , Yu Huichun writes about certain aspects of West Park dur- ing Qing times that relate to the emperor's antiquities collections; see Yu, "Qianlong's Divine Treasures: The Bells in Rhyming-The-Old Hall." 7 The term "xian" is alternatively translated as "transcendent" by some scholars to empha- size the xian's being transferred from the common human state to a more subtilized form of esistence, closer to the nature of the Dao.

They lived in certain lands designated as dongtian or cave-heavens, which existed in the vast stretch of the Great Void between heaven and earth.11 Novels and dramas dated from the sixteenth to eighteenth century portrayed such immortal lands as quiet and secluded, yet beautiful, places.12 Characteristically, an immortal land was shrouded by colorful mists and clouds and planted with thousand-year-old trees, wonderful flow- ers, and fragrant grass. In particular, fungi of immortality and peach trees were often said to have grown there. Besides immortals, these lands were populated by fabulous birds and animals, including cranes, phoenix-like birds, deer, apes, and elephants. They were not only immortal abodes, but also places in which earthly Daoists could pursue their own spiritual and physical transfor- mations. It could be reached by humans through designated earthly landmarks, also called dongtian , in the mountains.13 These caves were connected mysteriously with the real dongtian , or immortal lands. It was believed that the immortal lands were particularly favorable environ- ments for pursuing immortality. There, practitioners could effectively achieve union with the Dao by refining alchemical drugs. Contempo- rary paintings frequently imagined this fantastic land as a court garden dotted with pavilions and halls, and populated with elegantly dressed maidens.14 As Kiyohiko Munakata perceptively notes, the courtly ver- Art Institute of Chicago and University of California Press, 2000), p. 313.

Gou analyses the structure of the cosmos as described in 1 6th- 1 8th c. nov- els. Three realms are noted: tianjie or Heavenly Realm where lived highest gods and deities. Then was dijie or Earthly Realm, the chaotic world where human beings resid- ed. At the same time, in the dijie there were landmarks leading to immortal lands that re- sembled the Heavenly Realm but were separate from it and distinct from the Earthly Realm. These were places where immortals lived and mortals aspired to visit to cultivate themselves as they pursued immortality. The third realm was diyu íMlft or Hell, where ghosts were locked up, judged, and penalized. The immortal land concerned here is referred to as a separate im- mortal region in the Earthly Realm. I base the following descriptions of the immortal land on Gou's analysis. 13 Li, Liuchao Sui Tang , pp. 207-8. 14 Examples include "Festival of the Peaches of Longevity" (15th c.), in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, and "Jade Cave Fairyland" by Qiu Ying (ca. 1494-ca. 1552), 68</page><page sequence="5">JIAJING EMPEROR'S WEST PARK sion of the immortals' realm is likely to have developed in the society of high officials and even emperors. They patronized Daoism and "built their court gardens after the image of a luxurious paradise."15 The per- vasive belief in an immortal land as an ideal place for the pursuit of immortality would have underlain thejiajing emperor's choice of West Park as the site for his practice of Daoist rituals and self-cultivation. BEFORE 1542 West Park West Park was a renowned imperial garden long before thejia- jing emperor took it as his residence. Adjacent to the Forbidden City in present-day Beijing, it was originally built by Khubilai Khan based on a Jin dynasty (11 15-1234) construction. It was redesigned and re- constructed together with the Imperial City between 1407 and 1420 and became the imperial resort of the Ming dynasty.16 Located in the western portion of the Imperial City, it occupied almost a third of the latter's total area.17 (See the map provided, following page.) It was made up of three main parts. The first was a parkland covering approximately the area of present Beihai Park and Zhongnan hai It was primarily occupied by three interconnected lakes, collectively known as Taiye chi or Jinhai Some of the lake area was dug in the twelfth century and then greatly expanded in the early fifteenth.18 The water stretched out over four li M (about 2,240 meters) from the north to the south, taking up over half the parkland.19 West of the park- land was the second part of West Park, namely, Tu'er shan If. This artificial hill was located southeast of Xi'an men the western portal of the Imperial City. It was constructed during an earlier time, as a resort for the Yuan dynasty.20 Parts one and two were renowned in the Palace Museum, Beijing; see Little and Eichman, Taoism and the Arts of China , cat. 27; Richard Barnhart et al., Three Thousand Tears of Chinese Painting (New Haven and London: Yale U.P.; Beijing: Foreign Languages Press, 1997), pl. 212. 15 Munakata, Sacred Mountains , p. 130. 16 Nancy Shatzman Steinhardt, Chinese Imperial City Planning (Honolulu: U.

The third part of West Park was the palace complex between the parkland and the artificial hill. It was built upon the site of the old Yuan Palace, Longfu gong Together with Tu'er shan, the complex was regarded as Xinei or the Western Interior, in Ming times. The Jiajing emperor lived in this palace after he moved to West Park. It was not open for sightseeing, not even imperially-granted tours.22 In order to better understand the particularities of West Park, we can take a journey through texts.23 Our journey begins at the main portal, Xiyuan men situated on the southeast perimeter (see map). Passing through Xiyuan men, we are immediately confronted by a vast stretch of water. It was the Lake Taiye. Coiling mist and clouds shroud the water surface. Amidst cattails and reeds, we see birds and water creatures playing and singing. Moving northward along the east- ern shore, we reach Jiaoyuan ffiKI, or Jiao Garden. Hidden behind leafy pines, cypresses, and fruit trees, to the north of the Jiaoyuan, is a richly adorned circular hall named Chongzhi dian JR^ML24 Continu- ing northward, we encounter our first island, on which stands a high terrace known as Yuancheng Höc. Near its gate grow fragrant flower- ing trees and ancient pines, which are shaped like dragons stretching their claws.25 The terrace is surmounted by the Chengguang dian ^ jianzhi yange tukao (Shanghai: Shangwu yin shuguan, 1947), pp. 55-58.

For example, in "Xiyuan shi shishou" by Wen Zhengming (1470-1559), a poem concerns Wansui shan which was beyond the eastern boundary of West Park, as defined above; Wen Zhengming, Wen Zhengming ji (Shanghai: Shanghai guji chubanshe, 1987), pp. 299- 300.

The reports include: "Ci you Xiyuan shi xu" by Yang Shiqi #±^(1365- 1444) who visited in 1433 (Huang Zongxi JItkII [1610-1695], Ming wenhai [SKQS edn.; Shanghai: Shanghai guji chubanshe, 1987] 258, pp. I4a-i5b); "Ci you Xiyuan ji" MM by Han Yong (1422-1478) ( Xiangyi wenji [SKQS edn.] 9, pp. ia-6b); "Ci you Xiyuan ji" by Li Xian (1408-1466) (Sun Chengze [1592- 1676], Chunming mengyu lu [SKQS edn.; hereafter, CMMTL ] 64, pp. 22b-25a).

WAN a grand building providing a vantage point for viewing the lake scenery. Here, Ming emperors used to appreciate colorful lanterns set in the Park.26 Passing the white marble bridge to the north of Yuancheng, we reach the largest island on the lakes - Qionghua dao (Isle of Fine Jade). Its name is associated with certain beautiful stones from which the home of the Queen Mother of the West in Kunlun was made.27 The hill is piled up with magnificent rocks of unusual shapes. At the foot of the hill is a stone wall. Passing a gate, we find a small hall surrounded by gorgeous flowers and rare plants, chess boards, stone beds, and jade screens.28 Along the craggy road on the western slop are stone mounds and grottoes, one named Tiger Cave, the other called Grotto of Lü S the Immortal. Higher up, resplendent halls and pavilions come into view, notably the four pavilions - FanghuíJit, Yingzhou Yuhong 3£SI, and Jinlu skM. The former two took the names of legendary isles of immortals in the East China Sea, whereas the latter two recalled the jade rainbow and sweet dew found there. The pavilions flank a large building on the hilltop.29 Known as Guanghan dian JjffSSIS:, a name identical to the palace of the immortal Lady in the Moon, Chang E, it is an ornate hall with four sides richly decorated with colorful intricate carvings.30 From this high point, we can look afar and appreciate the rosy clouds shrouding the Park. If we turn our gaze to the northeast, we immediately see a grand hall named Ninghe ÍKÍP standing on the shore together with a few pavilions. Gazing northwestward, we observe a set of pavilions and gates, together with a newly renovated hall, the Taisu dian yfcítJS. Extending southward from there, we see a picturesque hall, the Yingcui dian stand- ing on the western shore across the lake. Turning our gaze back to the southeast, we can enjoy the stately architecture of the Forbidden City in the distance, and even view the whole capital city. A small bridge on the eastern slope of the island leads us back to the northeast bank. If we walk northward along the shore, we pass all the pavilions and halls that we have just seen from the hilltop.

Farther south, pass- ing the middle lake, we reach a long bank of earth planted with trees. On it was built a graceful hall called Zhaohe Bp^P, which faces the the third island, Nantai "SÄ. Here we can enjoy the sight of gulls flying above the rippling surface of the lake.31 Although we manage to observe only some of the representative scenic spots in the parkland region, this excursion has shown that the Park was associated with an immortal land before the Jiajing reign. The design of West Park, with Lake Taiye and the three islands Qionghua dao, Yuancheng, and Nantai, recalled such legendary immortal islands as Penglai 31^, Fangzhang and Yingzhou Ä$tl, floating on the East China Sea.32 Its fantastic landscape, with fragrant and elegant plants, magnificent rockeries, richly ornate palaces and halls, coiling mist and clouds, also resembled the courtly version of the immortal land as stated in the fifteenth and early-sixteenth-century texts dis- cussed earlier. The otherworldly associations of some features of the Park further indicate that it was thought to be linked to immortal lands from the beginning of the Ming. However, Ming emperors before the Jiajing emperor generally viewed West Park as a pleasure garden in which they themselves and their families could relax and enjoy natural scenic beauty. It was only in the Jiajing reign that the Daoist element of immortality developed further. The Jiajing Emperor When the Jiajing emperor came to the throne in 152 1, he was only in his early teens, and there was no mention in historical records of his interest in West Park.33 Being merely an indirect descendant of the previous emperor, he devoted much time and energy in the first years of his reign to establishing imperial authority and legitimacy in the succession.

Lothar Ledderose also identifies West Park as a typical paradise garden in the Chi- nese tradition; "The Earthly Paradise: Religious Elements in Chinese Landscape Art," in Su- san Bush and Christian Murck, eds., Theories of the Arts in China (Princeton: Princeton U.P., 1983), p. 171.

WAN the imperial rituals and titles proper for his late father, coined by his- torians as the "Great Ritual Controversy," marked his first success in asserting supremacy. Nonetheless, his position remained tenuous without an heir, as he had not fathered a son in the first decade of his reign.34 On the recommendation of a eunuch in the imperial house- hold, Daoist prayer ceremonies for fertility were conducted.35 Such cer- emonies, once conducted in the preceding reign, were enthusiastically supported by the emperor, whose belief in Daoism and its rituals had been noticed and criticized by his officials shortly after accession.36 In 1524, the emperor further summoned to the court Shao Yuanjie 315 TCtff (1459-1539)? a Daoist master associated with the Zhengyi JE-^ School.37 Among other duties, Shao held Daoist rituals and prayed for an imperial heir. When the emperor fathered his first son in 1533, he credited Shao and showered him with lavish gifts and honorary titles, making him the most influential religious figure of the time.38 The im- portant role of Daoism in consolidating the imperial authority of the Jiajing emperor must have thus strengthened his faith. In this period, the emperor began to show interest in external al- chemy and drugs of longevity, as shown in a personal letter of 1526 that he sent to Celestial Master Zhang Yanpian 3RIÍIS, requesting se- cret prescriptions.39 In the same letter, the emperor designated himself as Yuanyang dijun TÉ (Emperor of Primordial Yang).40 This ex- traordinary Daoist name suggests that the emperor already identified himself with Daoism and its pantheon. A series of tragedies occurring between 1538 and 1542 has usually been considered as crucial to the Jiajing emperor's ultimate seclusion.41 34 Yang, "Mingdai zhudi," pp. 80-84. 35 Frederick W.

This tragedy was shortly fol- lowed by a serious devastation that he experienced during his grand tour to the south.43 In the spring of 1539, the Jiajing emperor made a two-month trip to his former princedom in Anlu in order to inspect the potential burial ground for his mother. That was the first and also the last long-distance journey he made during his reign. During the journey, he saw starving people and refugees in numerous places. The suffering must have been immense and impressed him so deeply that he ordered the treasury to grant 20,000 liangW for emergency relief.44 The people's misery may also have led the emperor to believe that his reform of state rituals and government bureaucracy over the past eighteen years was in vain.45 Two years after the southern tour, the emperor still demanded candidates in the civil examination to explain why people's suffering did not come to an end despite his having fol- lowed Confucian teaching in upholding ethical relations and restoring ritual orthodoxy.46 The frustration experienced during the southern tour contributed to his increasing disinterest in state affairs. A huge fire happened during the same journey; this further brought the emperor to a critical juncture vis-a-vis Daoism. On the twenty- eighth day of the second lunar month of 1539, a fire broke out in the temporary quarters of the Jiajing emperor on his way to Anlu. The fire was actually specifically predicted by Tao Zhongwen (ca. 1481-1560), a Daoist recommended to the emperor by Shao Yuanjue in 1 538, 47 and fortunately the emperor was saved by one of his tour- ing staff.48 Shortly afterwards, Tao became the master of the Jiajing emperor and had profound influence in shaping the latter's religious behavior. As the emperor's concern for his own mortality grew, Tao encouraged the emperor to explore the practice of external alchemy and 42 MS II5, p. 3554. 43 MS; MSZSL 221, p. 4598; 223, p. 4630. 44 Tan Qian Guo que PÜfll (Beijing : Guji chubanshe, 1958) 57, p. 3575 45 Lin .Jiajing huangdi dazhuan, pp. 166-67. 46 MSZSL 247, pp. 4952-54. 47 MS 307, p. 7896; Mote and Twitchett, eds., Cambridge History of China , p. 464.

From 1539 on, the Jiajing emperor began to live partly in West Park. He ordered his grand secretaries to remain in the Park overnight and to compose Daoist prayers for him. The assassination attempt that took place in 1542 (see above) steeled him to his plan for withdrawal. Shortly after it, he moved into West Park. From then on, he left his grand secretaries to deal with most affairs, while he devoted himself to various religious practices. WEST PARK AFTER 1542 Throughout his residency in West Park, the Jiajing emperor took a series of measures to change its physical and cultural environment. These measures and activities point to a strong intention to transform the Park into an immortal land. They included 1 . buildings for Daoist uses, forming quite a change in the physical set- ting of West Park ; 2 . new designations for places, thus manipulating the collective under- standing of the Park's features; and 3. ordering or encouraging various Daoist religious activities, such as rituals, alchemical practices, divination, and auspicious signs to take place there. These measures and activities all contributed to an environment favor- able to enacting an idealized life of an immortal.50 At this point, we look at each one of these measures. Buildings The number of construction works in West Park during the Jia- jing period outnumbered those of other Ming reigns. Table 1 (facing) shows a total of eighteen buildings either built or rebuilt by the Jiajing emperor in the vicinity of the Park during the last twenty-five years 49 MS 209, p. 5516; 307, p. 7898; WLTHB 27, p. 749.

I also make use of other accounts written by late Ming and Qing eye-witnesses for providing supplementary ma- 77</page><page sequence="14">MAGGIE C. K. WAN of his reign. The construction of these buildings was concentrated in three periods of time, with the first period between 1542 and 1543, the second between 1557 and 1558, and the third from 1564 to 1566. These works coincided with three important points of the emperor's religious life.51 The first period marks just the beginning of the emperor's resi- dency. Five buildings were constructed, namely Dagaoxuan dian jSJS (B24), Youguo kangmin leidian f&amp;SÄSS® (B27), Leiting hong- ying dian IfSÂJíSIS (Bi), Ningdao leixuan ®ítff?Ť (B2), and Yutan AK! (B3). It seems obvious that the aim of the construction works was to provide the emperor with desirable venues for Daoist services, be- cause the majority of rituals that took place in West Park for the rest of his life were held in the temples and altars from this period.52 Among them, the Dagaoxuan dian was the most important. It was a grand Daoist temple completed in the fourth month of 1542, well before the Jiajing emperor moved to the Park.53 In front of the temple were two inscribed steles, which read, "Palace dependents and other people reaching this point must all dismount from chariots and horses ËÎ#À^ÏJÎfc{JIT^ IS." In the opinion of Liu Ruoyu, a late-Ming eunuch, this instruction indicated the Jiajing emperor's respect for Daoism.54 On the front gate were four characters "Shiqing daojing translated as "Daoist Realm of the Initiating Empyrean." To the left and right of the gate were two monumental archways. One was inscribed "Xiantian ming- jing; Taiji xianlin" meaning "Bright Realm of the Anterior Heaven; Immortal Forest of the Supreme Ultimate." The other read "Kongsui huangzuo; Hongyou tianmin" íLISM/fF; mean- ing "Great Stability for the Imperial Reign; Broad Support to Heaven and the People." Behind the gates were two pavilions: the Jiongming ge on the left and the Yinling xuan ?W§S$Ť on the right.55 The main hall was installed with the statues of the Three Purities.56 To its terials : Jiang Yikui ^ (16th c.), Chang'an kehua (Beijing: Beijing guji chubanshe, 1994); CMMYL'JATSBJ' Yu Minzhong ŤSW (Ï7I4-I779) et al., Qinding Rixia jiuwen kao ifcSBTÄM# (hereafter RXJWK) (SKQS edn.

The emperor also let palace maids and eunuchs live there when they were learning Daoist scriptures and rituals.60 Comparable in size and significance to the Dagaoxuan dian was the Leiting Hongying dian located at the northern end of Lake Taiye. It was an altar complex built in 1543.61 Extant record provides no de- scription of this complex, except for its fourteen name-plaques.

The Jiajing emperor was recorded to have prayed for rain and snow and offered Daoist sacrifices within the Leiting Hongying dian, a topic taken up below. The other three buildings of this period were all for religious or semi-religious purposes. Youguo kangmin leidian was a Daoist altar initiated by Tao Zhongwen in 1542. 63 Ningdao leixuan was a favor- ite private studio of the Jiajing emperor, where he prayed and fre- quently visited in the daytime.64 Yutan was built in 1543 for praying for rain.65 bao tianzun and the Daode tianzun jüÜLÍÜ^ÍÍ.

K. WAN The second period saw the construction of the Daguangming dian (B20) in 1557 and Daxuandu dian AStßfä (B8) in 1558.66 The former is particularly worthy of notice because it was the largest altar complex in West Park. It had, behind its front gate, a large circu- lar altar resembling the Altar of Heaven.67 It was composed of many richly ornate halls. One of them called Tianxuan ge A2CKJ (Bžok; this and various other numbers are found only in table 2) had a tablet say- ing "Chanxuan baozuo" Bfl3rfScST=, that is, "Expounding the Mysterious Way; maintaining the Good Fortune of the Nation." The roof of the hall was covered with yellow glazed tiles and its exterior walls were covered with green glazed tiles; columns in the front were red with gilt decoration and dragon ornaments. Inside the hall, windows and ceiling were carved and painted in gold. The tablet stating Qibao yunlong shen "trÄÄfltt (Cloud Dragon God of Seven Treasures) for worshipping Heaven on High was set upon three layers of white marble. It is said that the Jiajing emperor practised self-cultivation and discussed internal alchemy with Tao Zhongwen there.68 Like the Daguangming dian, the Daxuandu dian was also a venue for Daoist ceremonies.69 The completion of the Da Guangming dian and the Daxuandu dian occurred one to two years after the emperor proclaimed himself a Dao- ist deity. In 1556, he publicly conferred upon himself three magnificent Daoist titles. They were: 1 . Lingxiao shangqing tonglei yuanyang miaoyi feixuan zhenjun 2.

At the same time, he granted to his natural parents similarly extravagant Daoist appellations.70 The emperor's proclamation made clear to his subjects that he was not only the emperor of the Ming ter- ritories, but also a transcendent being, a Daoist god. Although written evidence to substantiate the relationship between his proclamation and the construction of the grand hall of Daguangming dian is yet to be 66 For the Daguangming dian, see Zhu, Ming Qing liangdai gongyuan , pp. 18, 56-58; RXJWK 42, pp. 16b, 17a; CMMYL 6, pp. 5ia~52a.

Although there is little written description, we know that some of the buildings were intended for religious pur- poses, and Daoist ceremonies were mentioned.80 The large number of construction works in this period coincided with many Daoist rituals and auspicious occurrences ordered or fostered in West Park by the emperor in the hope of obtaining blessings. Designations While buildings were mainly constructed in three periods, the names of places and buildings in West Park underwent unprecedented changes during the Jiajing period. Table 2, below, lists buildings that were named or renamed from 1542 to 1567.81 An analysis of the mean- ing of these designations shows that they mainly revolved around four themes. The four themes correlated closely with the preoccupations and religious activities of the Jiajing emperor during different phases of his religious belief. The first theme centers around immortals and spirits. Names linked to this theme include such words as: xiani tlí, lingWí, shen #, zhen X, and ming^M.

Some records are so brief that it is hard to establish whether some buildings were in the precinct of West Park.

The emphasis on thunder was closely related to the affiliation of the Jiajing emperor and his Daoist associates with the long tradition of the Daoist Thunder Rite. For example, in 1539 and 1546, the emperor granted three hon- orary titles to his Daoist master, Tao Zhongwen, all beginning with the phrase Shenxiao WW, which indicated a connection with the Thunder Rite that had come into prominence starting in the twelfth century.85 85 MS* 307, p. 7896; MSZSL 314, p. 5874. 84</page><page sequence="21">JIAJING EMPEROR'S WEST PARK [21/ 1542] Dagaoxuan dian ArtííJS (Hall of Superior Primordial) a.

WAN S®, Huguang.88 The assignment of names with the word "leť to stu- dios and altars between 1542 and 1543, not long after the initiation of Tao's project, can be ascribed to the emperor's strong commitment to the worship of thunder gods during that time. The fourth theme is auspiciousness. It was signaled by incorporat- ing one of the auspicious triad, namely, shou H (longevity), fu te (good fortune), and lu Ã® (emolument), or auspicious words like ji pf and xiang into a designation. Examples include Yongshou gong äcl#® (Bioi), Shouyuan dian (B6i), Shousheng ju íUSSÜj (B2oh), Fuzhen qi MM (B20Í), Luxian shi (B2oj), Wanshou gong ¡ÜÜK (Bioiv), Enshou gong (Bioiii), Zhaoxiang ge BpW® (Bui), Yannian dian (B36), Longji zhai tipfSf (B12Ü), Fengxiang guan (B13Ü), Bailu gong (Bi8i), Wufu dian Sii® (Big), Shouqi HIS (625a), Fushe í¡§ (B25b), Lushe /TffrÉř (B25C), and Shouqing gong Ifilfciî (B35). The growing prevalence of auspicious words in the final years of the Jiajing reign paralleled the increasing desperation of the emperor for eternal life and signs from heaven. The Jiajing emperor's religious preoccupa- tion and activities will be further examined in the next section. What seems obvious at this point is that the emperor manifested his shifting religious concerns through a manipulation of names. Why did the Jiajing emperor attach so much importance to the names of buildings? A name is important as a cultural sign. By giving a physical structure a name with Daoist connotations, the emperor speci- fied a Daoist reading of the physical setting. The proclamation of new designations and the installation of new plaques reinforced the dissemi- nation of a Daoist conception of the place in a collective understand- ing. To recall an old name of a physical structure in this circumstance would have been dangerous. For it would be violating the new concept of the place and would undoubtedly have raised objections. Shen Defu records an anecdote about mislabeling a place in West Park in 1544. He notes that grand secretary Zhai Luan IBÜI (1477-1 546) mentioned in a petition the old name of a hall called Wuyi dian (in the Wanshou Palace complex) rather than its newly granted Daoist designation of Shangxuan gaoxuan (The Superior and High Primordial) or Xuanwei xuangong 2JS3CÍ0 (The Might and Virtue of the Primordial). The Jiajing emperor was enraged. Zhai was deprived of his office and was chased out of the palace. After narrating the story, Shen sighed and concluded, "After that, no one dared to mention the 88 MS' WLTHB 6, p. 179; MSZSL 236, pp. 4823-24; 245, p. 4922; 305, p. 5765. 86</page><page sequence="23">JIAJING EMPEROR'S WEST PARK old names of either the hall and the [accompanying] pavilion! ifctíSíf This helps us understand two significant aspects of West Park and the way naming could relate to the Jiajing emperor. As our dis- cussion of the names of construction works and buildings has shown, the Jiajing emperor manipulated West Park to follow the pattern of his religious beliefs. The frequent changes highlighted his concern over the Daoist elements of his living environment. More importantly, by changing building designations, he was able to make known things otherwise not easily discerned. What the anecdote above tells us, on the one hand, is the extent to which the emperor's dedicated approach towards "naming" was recognized by his contemporaries. The way in which the emperor conceived of and designated a building, and by extension an environment, had to be followed by his subjects, or pen- alty would be imposed. By establishing new physical structures and providing them with authorized readings, the Jiajing emperor dictated a Daoist-immortal conception of his living environment, with special emphasis on its auspicious nature. Individuals who lived and worked in West Park would, therefore, have had no choice but to accept and participate in such a concept. On the other hand, the anecdote demonstrates how the Jiajing em- peror assumed the position of Daoist emperor. According to the Mingshi Eßife, Zhai Luan, the main character, was prosecuted for having two sons who cheated in the civil examination and tampered with examination results.90 To defend himself, Zhai stated in his petition that he was on duty at West Park during the incident. His explanation enraged the Jiajing emperor who had Zhai, his sons, and the examiners removed from office and downgraded to commoners. As also noted in Mingshi , Zhai had not been a favorite of the emperor since becoming grand secretary in 1540.91 In particular, he was involved in many petitions against the emperor's plan to confer imperial title upon his late father in the Great Ritual Controversy, and was later accused of having secret dealings with his fellow colleagues and subordinates.92 Therefore, it is probable that his faults in miscalling places and mentioning his duty in West Park in his defense were used as a pretext to expel him. 89 WLTHB 2, p. 51; RXJWK 36, p. 7a. 90 MS 193, p. 51 12. 91 MS 193, pp. 5111-12. 92 For his involvement in the Great Ritual Controversy, see Hu Jixun, "The Great Ritual Controversy and Personnel and Ethical Change in the Court of Ming Shizong: A Study of the Political Consequences of the Officials Who Protested at the Zuoshun Gate in 1524," Ph.D. diss.

WAN A similar case was that of Xia Yan MH (1482-1548), the Jiajing emperor's once-favorite grand secretary. For various reasons the em- peror's resentment against Xia Yan grew, and the latter was executed in 1 548. Yet, Xia's refusal to wear the Daoist fragrant-leaf cap in rituals was used as a charges against him prior to his imprisonment.93 In both cases, that of Zhai Luan and Xia Yan, the Jiajing emperor might have been genuinely enraged by their contempt for Daoism.94 Nonetheless, the overriding position of the Daoist religion in West Park also gave the emperor the power to make all sorts of decision under various kinds of Daoist reasoning. Being the only person who decided what constituted any sort of contempt for Daoism and who had revealed such feelings, the Jiajing emperor placed himself in the position of a Daoist emperor, whose authority could no longer be challenged by his court officials with Confucian logic and reasons. Religious Activities Besides manipulating the physical environment of West Park, the Jiajing emperor ordered religious activities to take place in it throughout his residency. Four practices were dominant: Daoist rituals, alchemy, spirit writing, and the making of auspicious signs. The ultimate objec- tive of most of these practices was to assist the emperor in his pursuit of immortality. However, not only the emperor but also his court was involved. The court members referred to here were the imperial fam- ily, government officials, eunuchs, palace maidens, and religious spe- cialists. They played crucial roles in introducing and persuading the Jiajing emperor to take up such practices. Their participation made the religious performances look grand; their cooperation contributed to giving religious rhetoric a form of "reality," as West Park was trans- forming into a Daoist immortal land on earth. The four practices are discussed in turn. In records concerning Jiajing-period religious activities, Daoist rituals included performances designated as zhai Hf, jiao H, zhaijiao Si, and dadian ^ft.95 In general the performance of a Daoist ritual in- 93 MS 307, p. 7897. 94 Previous scholarship has shown that the Jiajing emperor had little tolerance to whoever showed contempt for Daoist religion; see Yang, "Mingdai zhudi," pp. 104-6. 95 The word dadian was a generic term for religious ceremonies, whereas zhai and jiao carried specific meaning in early Daoist history. The word zhai was referred to as a fasting ritual in which a participant would purify himself through ritualized penitence and self-denial and accumulate merit by recitations from the sacred scriptures and penitential litanies. Mean- while the word jiao was referred to as an offering ritual, where the participant made offerings and celebrated his communion and covenant with celestial beings. Both types of ritual can be 88</page><page sequence="25">JIAJING EMPEROR'S WEST PARK volved the establishment of an altar, usually composed of three super- imposed stages. The stages were furnished with colorful placards and talismans. At the center of the altar was an incense burner, together with name-plaques of celestial beings, writs, offerings, and ritual imple- ments. In the course of a ritual, the chief Daoist priest would visualize his own return to the primordial, where he would encounter celestial beings and petition them on behalf of the community or individuals he served.96 In the meantime, five or more minor Daoist priests would present incense, chant scriptures, and supervise ritual minutia. A band, which probably consisted of fifty-two musicians in the case of a grand Daoist ritual in the Jiajing court, would perform ritual music through- out the process.97 Ritual as such might last for a few hours or days, and involve only several individuals to dozens of performers. Extant Ming records note approximately 260 instances when Dao- ist rituals were ordered. Roughly about 30 fall in the first phase between 1522 and 1541; 120 in the second phase between 1542 and 1555; and 110 occurred in the third phase between 1556 and 1567.98 The dura- tions were mostly about 3 days in the first phase and from 3 to 9 in the second and third phases, with some exceptionally important rituals running up to 46 days in the second phase and 78 in the third. The in- crease in frequency and length of Daoist rituals indicates the emperor's indulgence in Daoist rituals after he moved into the Park. West Park was the main venue for Daoist rituals in the last two phases. In the second phase, about 60 out of those 120 occasions were said to have taken place there, whereas about 70 out of 1 10 ritual events were held there in the third phase. The majority were held in the Da- gaoxuan dian (B24) and Leiting hongying dian (Bi).99 Occasionally, they were also performed in the Wanshou Palace complex (Bio), the traced back to the Eastern Han period and flourished in medieval China; Zhuang Hongyi Mingdai Daojiao Zfrengyi pai (Taibei: Taiwan xuesheng shuju, 1986), pp. 145-53; Little and Eichman, Taoism and the Arts of China , p. 190.

In addition, there were prayers for good harvest, thanksgiving ceremonies for rain, rituals for the arrest of rebels, and for successful military action along borders.101 The surge in number and diversity of rituals signaled the emperor's growing belief in the omnipotence of Daoist gods. The Jiajing emperor presided over some of the rituals, especially Daoist prayers for rain and snow. The Ming shilu and Mingshan- zang ŽilUWii note that he offered Daoist prayers for rain and snow in 1541, 1548, 1549, 1550, 1 551, i553&gt; and at least once a year between 1558 and 1566 except for 1563. 102 Xia Yan vividly describes one of the emperor's prayers for snow in his poem. It reads, On the Altar of the North Dipper inside the Palace of the Purple Ultimate, The emperor brandished the divine sword coldly in the moonlight.

Xia's poem does not mention that anyone else participated in the prayer. However, as described above, most rituals and prayers involved at least several Daoist priests and a band of musicians. In some rituals, even senior government officials would play a part. Xia was one of the grand secretaries who actively participated in Daoist rituals through composi- tion of the qingci 1=NhI, or "blue-green paper prayers." Qingci were Daoist prayers written on blue-green paper that were presented to Daoist dei- ties by the act of burning.104 As early as 1523, the offering of the qingci was already mentioned as an integral part of the Daoist ritual held in the palace.105 Gu Dingchen HlffjE (1473-1540) and Xia Yan, were among the earliest grand secretaries who won the Jiajing emperor's favor by their skillful writing of Daoist prayers.106 After 1539, ministers, includ- ing Yan Song USj (1480-1567), Yuan Wei (1508-1565), Li Chun- fang ^#5? (jinshi 1547), Yan Na JÜlft (1511-1584), and Guo Pu fW, acquired their high positions through their skill at writing prayers.107 These ministers were assigned to West Park to supply prayers on de- mand. Their writings were ornate and filled with flowery and imagina- tive wordings. For example, Gonghe lingfan wushou álíPÂIffEllí , another poem by Xia Yan, describes a ritual scene as follows: Precious banners were raised high in the Palace of Myriad Longevity. i=fl=K^P Heavenly maidens from the Blue Empyrean descended to the Jade Altar.

In the spring the immortal park showed [a scen- ery like] the painting of auspicious snow.109 The poems praise the ritual banners in the Wanshou Palace com- plex for attracting the heavenly maidens to descend to the altar; the movement of the banners in the air was viewed as an indicator of the coming of deities. Poems and prayers as such artfully delineated invis- ible deities and their responses to the emperor's Daoist arts.110 The imaginative scenarios these writings offered constituted an indispens- able part of the Daoist rituals. In addition to Daoist rituals, the Jiajing emperor dedicated himself to two types of alchemy: waidan (external alchemy) and neidan (internal alchemy). External alchemy referred to a practice that aimed at achieving the elixir of immortality by using laboratory tech- niques to refine minerals and metals in accordance with an ancient theory of cosmology. The story of the false alchemist Duan Chaoyong mentioned earlier indicates that the Jiajing emperor was strongly com- mitted to alchemical drugs as early as the 1540s. During the rest of the reign, he continued to bestow presenters of alchemical drugs with valuable goods and high official ranks.111 Further, he ordered elixirs to be produced in West Park. In one of Xia Yan's poems, there is a line regarding the Jiajing emperor's participation in the refinement of alchemical drugs. It reads, The foul air from the neighborhood has not yet completely disappeared. The emperor has labored to blend the medi- cines and pray for efficacious spirits.

The medicine, including thirty-five pills together with related prescriptions, coins, and silver, were put in a small white silk bag on which was a stamp with the phrase " Ningdao leixuan n ÄiSffff.113 Ningdao leixuan was a studio (B2) on the northern shore of Lake Taiye in West Park. In 1566, when the emperor discovered some drugs at his bedside in the Wanshou Palace complex (Bio), he had little doubt that heaven had granted immortal drugs to him and gratefully ordered the offering of thanksgiving rituals.114 There are few records about the emperor's practice of internal alchemy, probably due to its esoteric nature. Internal alchemy was a technique that combined meditation and breath control with the in- tention that the practitioner should visualize the creation of elixirs in the inner landscape of his own body; it aimed to lead the practitioner to spiritual perfection and to reunite him with the Dao.115 The accom- plishment of internal alchemy was a prerequisite for any believer to ac- complish the goals of major Daoist rituals and prayers. In one of Xia's poems on a zhai ritual held in West Park, thejiajing emperor was de- scribed as having "secretly said prayers to deities in the highest realm of heaven, securely sealed the mysterious pearl that formed in a jade tripod, filled the Yellow Court with the harmonized Golden Liquor, and given birth to the immortal embryo in the tenth month. fi, ÍSÍP^®ÍÍSÍ1, +£j|S{tIli§"116 Such esoteric terms as jinye huangting Itili, and xianying fill# were often used in the discourse of internal alchemy.117 They were referred to as important parts of the body of the practitioner, that is, the Jiajing emperor, in 112 Xia, Xia GuizJhou xiansheng wenji 6, p. 326. 113 Xu Chong (i6th-i7th c.), Nuanshu youbi , in Cangshuo xiaocui series (rpt. 1606 edn.

WAN his return to the primordial during the ritual.118 As noted before, the Jiajing emperor discussed internal alchemy with Tao Zhongwen in the Daguangming dian (B20). As the goal of external alchemy and internal alchemy was to assist the adept to achieve longevity and immortality, it is little surprise that the Jiajing emperor was dedicated to these and reserved spaces in West Park in which to perform them. Spirit writing was the third kind of religious activity held in West Park. By spirit writing, I refer to the practice known as fuj i Í£ÈL (or fu- luan í£Sf) or "wielding the planchette," "automatic" or "passive" writing supposedly produced by otherworld beings such as gods, immortals, and spirits communicating with this world.119 The writing could be done ei- ther by sticking an implement in a sieve and tracing characters in sand, ashes, or powders, or by fastening a brush on a Y-shaped wooden im- plement and producing traces with ink on paper.120 The characteristic emphasis of the practice was that immortals and gods could take posses- sion of a writing implement, be it a brush or a stick, and compose what they wished, with or without the assistance of spirit mediums. Hence, man could have direct access to these intangible beings, inquiring into every mortal issue through the medium of writing. The Jiajing emperor's interest in spirit writing became manifest around 1540. A passage in Mingshi notes that the emperor set up a spe- cial terrace for consulting the planchette, known as Jixian tai tSLilÜÄ, or Terrace for Immortal Divination, in the inner court.121 He occasionally rewarded or punished his subjects in line with information obtained through spirit writing.

Their release, according to Mingshi , resulted partly from the information that the emperor obtained through spirit writing.122 In the same year, fol- lowing a séance of spirit writing, the emperor also ordered a bridge to be built at Liangxiang ÜÄ across the River Liuli í0íl.123 Since these events happened after the emperor secluded himself in West Park, it is most likely that the emperor and his medium practised spirit writ- ing in one of the halls there. However, the absence of a precise record makes it impossible to pin down exact sites. A record in Mingshi allows us to have a glimpse into the way in which the emperor practised spirit writing. It describes the procedure as follows: Lan Daoxing won imperial favor by his skill in wielding the planch- ette. Whenever the emperor had a question, he put it into a sealed envelope, and dispatched a eunuch to the altar, to burn it there. The answers usually were irrelevant to the content [of the impe- rial writing]. The emperor blamed this on the bad conduct of the eunuch. The eunuch was scared and colluded with Daoxing. The eunuch then opened and read the [emperor's] questions before burning them. From then on, the answers tallied well with the content [of the imperial writing].124 fx, mmmmt, The Jiajing emperor presented his questions to gods through the burning of sealed questions. It is possible that Lan Daoxing was, in this case, a medium who was supposed to have been possessed by gods, holding the writing instrument and producing divine answers to the emperor's questions. Successful communication with gods and immor- tals through planchette had an important implication in West Park. Al- though gods and immortals were invisible and intangible, the planch- ette attested that they existed and could be reached there. The last religious activity is concerned with the making of auspi- cious signs. There had been a long tradition in China of interpreting 122 MS 209, p. 5526. 123 Zhajizao ïËHii'Ë: (1601-1676), Zuiweilu (Xuxiu siku quanshu edn.; Shanghai: Shanghai guji chubanshe, 1995) 22, p. 177. In 1563, the emperor again decided to expel his once favorite grand secretary Yan Song from the court. This decision followed spirit writing, which stated that Yan was the cause of the unrest of the Empire; MS 307, p. 7899. Since the Jiajing emperor had grown to distrust Yan Song well before this example of the practice of spirit writing, it is probable that the spirit writing was taken as a pretext for expelling Yan Song from the court. 124 MS 307, p. 7899. 95</page><page sequence="32">MAGGIE C.

The appearance of strange plants and beasts and the sighting of strange natural phenomena were interpreted as manifestations of heaven's approval of the enlightened rule of the emperor. During almost every reign, the Ming emperors received their fair share of reports of auspicious phenomena from all parts of the empire.125 What, however, was exceptional in the Jiajing period was that a large number of auspicious signs were reported as appearing inside West Park, rather than throughout the rest of the em- pire.126 Moreover, thejiajing emperor repeatedly attributed auspicious signs to the Daoist Supreme Primordial. The first appearance of auspicious signs in West Park was reported in 1543, less than a year after the emperor established the Park as his permanent residence. In the eighth month of 1543, auspicious grain was found in the Park.127 In the eighth month of the following year, the Park again yielded auspicious grain. Within a month came another report of a sighting of sixty-four auspicious grains on one stalk with two ears. Meanwhile, millet with five tassels was also found at the Yutan (B3). Responding to these auspicious phenomena, the emperor granted to his ministers an instruction, as follows: Double-eared wheat is seen in the imperial field. This is bestowed upon us by heaven and earth, and is different from grains of the Zhou and wheat of the Han. Moreover, the number of the grains is sixty-four, which is exactly the same as that of the hexagrams. Also, in the Altar of Rain there is a plant of millet with five tassels... All these are signs given by the Most High. Furthermore, there is little rain this year, and the barbarians also attacked several times. We cannot be ignorant of the kindness of the Primordial and should worship the Way of Heaven.128 fSJH 12 5 Peter Sturman, "Cranes above Kaifeng: the Auspicious Image at the Court of Huizong," Ars Orientalis 20 (1990), pp. 33-68; Maggie Bickford, "Emperor Huizong and the Aesthetic of Agency," Archives of Asian Art 53 (2002-2003), pp. 71-104. 126 Carney Fisher, "Ming Shizong and Daoism," Bulletin of Ming-Qing Studies 4 (1999), p. 45. 127 For a detailed record of auspicious events in the sixteenth century, see Xu et al., Guochao dianhui 113, p. 767; Fisher, "Ming Shizong and Daoism," pp. 43-68.

The appearance of the auspicious grain and millet was a manifestation of the Most High, Laozi, and they were different from those obtained in the past. Thejiajing emperor defined the unusual plants in West Park as Daoist signs. The variety and frequency of auspicious phenomena that appeared in West Park grew toward the end of the reign. For instance, in the fourth month of 1562, an auspicious rabbit in the Park was said to have given birth to two offspring.129 In the fifth month of 1564, a peach was found behind the imperial throne while the emperor was sitting in the garden. Thejiajing emperor considered it a gift sent by heaven and ordered a thanksgiving ritual to be held for five days. On the next day, again, a peach was said to have descended from heaven.130 Shortly afterwards, two deer were born. The emperor was so grateful for such blessings from heaven that he wrote all the congratulatory documents with his own hand. As Carney Fisher rightly points out, "auspicious omens" as re- corded to have appeared in thejiajing reign included the presentation of a large number of natural and ordinary products, such as beasts and plants.131 Other auspicious signs, such as pills, were obvious fabrica- tions that eunuchs and officials around the emperor had a hand in their discovery. In the occurrence of either kind of auspicious omen, grand secretaries in power never failed to lead high officials to flood the em- peror with congratulatory hymns and prose once an auspicious sign was reported. Many of these writings are still preserved.132 The affirmative attitude of their testimonies rendered the appearance of auspicious signs an indubitable "reality." The choice of West Park as the venue for aus- picious phenomena further echoed the conscious effort of thejiajing emperor to turn the Park into a sacred space. Here, the appearances of auspicious signs were visual confirmations of heaven's approval of the otherworldly character of the Park. At the same time, they might have been considered as heaven's positive response to the good governance 129 MSZSL 508, p. 8372. 130 MSZSL 534, p. 8680; Xu et al., Guochao dianhui 113, p. 767. 131 Fisher, "Ming Shizong and Daoism," pp. 44-49. Fisher agrees that West Park was "a place made sacred by the presence of the emperor" and that the fertility of animals, such as rabbits, "were identified as auspicious signs because they live in the confines of the palace or the Western Garden." 132 Some of the panegyrics can still be seen in the collected works of grand secretaries.

WAN of the Jiajing emperor, as had long been so understood in the Confu- cian tradition.133 As the emperor grew old and his health worsened, nothing was more reassuring to the emperor than knowing that he was already living in an immortal world and that blessings from the Most High upon his mortality and his empire were within reach. CONCLUSION The Jiajing emperor had a definite objective in his use of West Park. From the early Ming period, West Park, with its three intercon- nected lakes and islands, had been regarded as resembling the immor- tal islands in the sea off China's east coast. This characteristic of West Park must have attracted the attention of the Jiajing emperor. He used the large area to create landscape features that afforded the possibil- ity of realizing the Daoist concept of immortality. He ordered ritual complexes to be constructed inside the Park, and rebuilt many halls to serve religious and semi-religious purposes. He urged palace maids and eunuchs to receive Daoist teachings and wear Daoist costume. Even officials serving in the Park were given Daoist robes and caps.134 To ensure the recognition of this landscape the emperor granted to many buildings new names with Daoist and immortal connotations. Through the installation of new name-plaques he specified a Daoist reading of the whole geography. Inside these buildings Daoist rituals and cer- emonies were held; various practices for achieving immortality were performed; auspicious animals and plants were orchestrated to appear in various places in the Park. This was a setting in which the Jiajing emperor took on his role as an immortal. I have stressed the importance of the Jiajing emperor's pursuit of immortality over other factors in explaining his seclusion in West Park in an attempt to demonstrate that the emperor's choice for his permanent residence was not simply a Park but an immortal land. He prepared for himself a dongtian, an ideal place for him as a human be- ing to cultivate physical immortality and as an "immortal on earth" to reside. This dual approach - the recognition of a specific setting and the creation of a role - offers a promising way through which to inter- 133 Ibid., pp. 44-49. Fisher has elaborated on the reading of the auspicious omens in the Jiajing reign in relation to the Confucian tradition. 134 Palace poems of the Jiajing period also mention that palace maids serving in West Park wore Daoist robes and special ritual shoes; Li Gun (jinshi 1553), Li Zjtian shiji EHf#JÍI (preface dated 1601) (Congshu jicheng xubian edn.

As Shen Defu notes, a few month after the emperor's death, many of the buildings in West Park were destroyed and tablets removed, such as the Leiting hongying dian and the Ningdao leixuan.136 By the end of the seventeenth century, when Gao Shiqi (1645-1704) wrote about West Park, most of the buildings first established by thejiajing emperor had already disappeared except for the two major temples, Dagaoxuan dian and the Daguangming dian.137 Today, the Dagaoxuan dian is the only architecture still extant. Unfortunately it has been occupied by military units since the mid-twentieth century and badly damaged. It is no longer accessible to anyone without special approval.
