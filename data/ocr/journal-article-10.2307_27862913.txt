Austin-Broos Pentecostals and Rastafarians: Cultural, Political, and Gender Relations of two Religious Movements1 ABSTRACT Pentecostalism and Rastafarianism generally are assumed to be quite unrelated religious phenomena. However, closer examina tion reveals that both religions address a complex of issues which are of central concern to Jamaican men and women. They harbour gender-specific approaches to everyday life which have significant ideological and political implications. Indeed Pente costalism has become for its adherents no less an indigenous phenomenon than Rastafarianism. At the same time, Pente costalism's significance for Jamaican geo-politics and culture extends far beyond the local community, and promotes an ideological style which challenges Rastafarianism as a dominant form of Folk belief. These characteristics of Pentecostalism are examined in relation to Rastafarianism and used to support some general propositions about the political nature of Jamaican and Caribbean culture. INTRODUCTION In the context of Jamaican working-class life Rasta farianism and Pentecostalism have a tendency to be gender specific and to provide strategies and symbols for living which are complementary opposities: complimentary but opposite ways to address some moral perennials of working class life. An examination of Rastafarianism and Pentecosta lism along with a brief comparison with a middle-class funda mentalism demonstrates that these religions, opposed in important and irreducible ways, should be considered never theless as part of the same cultural and theological universe. This claim cuts across a great deal of received opinion about Rastafarianism and by implication Pentecostalism as well. By</page><page sequence="2">2 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES way of introduction let us rehearse and examine this opinion to see just how these religions have been situated in the cultural context of Jamaican life. A focus on the African heritage in New World religion has long been a feature of Caribbean anthropology [Hersko vits 25; Curtin 20; Simpson and Hammond 49; Bastide 7], though the original emphasis on survivals is complimented now by analyses which link a tradition of African practice with a process of mass resistance [cf. Mintz and Price 37; Comaroff 18]. The approach is stated most succinctly by historian Monica Sch?ler [45] in the introduction to her discussion of Myalism and the 'African Religious tradition in Jamaica'. Sch?ler [45: p. 65] observes, If there is a certain similarity and continuity detectable in Jamaican religious movements from Myalism in the eighteenth century through Revivalism in the nineteenth century and Rastafarianism in the twentieth, it is not solely because they are lower class responses to colonial oppression. That explanation accounts only for the circumstances of the movement's development. Their shape and content are derived from an older, precolo nial African tradition... In these accounts of Jamaican folk religion, Pentecosta lism is inevitably excluded notwithstanding the fact that today it is a major religion among the masses. Despite its popularity in the Caribbean and in east and west Africa, it is not in the sense of these writers an 'African' religion. Its association with North American missionary enterprise has meant that Pentecostalism is seen to be consistent with a conservative political stance and aspirations for upward mobility [Chevannes 15; Wedenoja 57; Beckford and Witter 8] . The fact that its iconography is white and appears not to question the European cultural heritage of Caribbean Christianity, seems to make it nothing more than a hegemonic system maintained as a dimension of American dominance in the region. Yet according to the 1982 census, Pentecostalism is the</page><page sequence="3">Pentecostals and Rastafarians 3 espoused faith of roughly half a million Jamaicans (in a popu lation of just under 2.2 million).2 By contrast Rastafarianism's modest census register of 14.25 thousand suggests that its acceptance among the masses as a primary religious affiliation, as opposed to a diffuse cultural orientation, is relatively limited (see Table 1). Pentecostalism like Rastafarianism took root in the first 30 years of this century and has grown rapidly since (see Table 2). This expansion has been due mainly to the evangelism of Jamaicans though it has received some selective funding from the United States.3 This evan gelism, moreover, has been very critical of the denominational churches and has thereby identified itself as a religion for the poor. Its success must be placed beside the failure of the denominational churches over the past 100 years to increase the proportion of the Jamaican population they claim as affiliates [MacGavran 35]. Certainly, the argument concern ing American cultural hegemony captures one aspect of Pen teeostalism's spectacular growth in Jamaica. A desire to assert spiritual superiority in terms significant to a regional power clearly provides one key to the religion's early and rapid acceptance. However, it cannot be the sole explanation of Pentecostalism's prominence. Another American based group, the Seventh Day Adventists, have proselytized widely in Jamaica and been relatively successful (also see Table 2). Their affiliation is almost as large as the Anglican church and in fact is as large or larger than Jamaica's biggest Pentecostal Church of God. Yet the church shows little of the compre hensive penetration of the society exhibited in concert by the numerous Apostolic churches and Churches of God. Many of these are small independent groups with no American affilia tions at all.3 Indeed it is in the diffuse nature of Jamaican Pentecostalism that its strength resides. It has become a major folk institution articulated as an alternative to 'estab lished' religion. It is not an African derived religion, and yet it is a folk religion (with American connections) clearly identi fied with the poor.</page><page sequence="4">4 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES TABLE 1 Population by Religious Affiliation, by sex ALL JAMAICA Total Male Female TOTAL 2,172,879 1,063,462 1,109,417 Anglican 154,548 71,287 83,261 Baptist 217,839 98,700 119,139 Brethren 22,961 10,029 12,932 Church of God 400,379 175,140 225,239 Methodist 68,289 30,770 37,519 Moravian 31,772 14,924 16,848 Pentecostal 113,570 47,974 65,596 United Church 58,938 27,154 31,784 Roman Catholic 107,580 50,769 56,811 Seventh Day Adventist 150,722 67,129 83,593 Jehovahs Witness 25,016 10,991 14,025 Rastafarian 14,249 11,661 2,588 Salvation Army 11,131 5,040 6,091 Jewish 412 202 210 A.

The African sequence of Myal, Revival and Rastafarianism is, after all, something of an artifice. Des pite indigenous curing and spirit beliefs, Revival churches maintain a white iconography, and in their ritual, strong retentions from the Baptist church [cf. Simpson 48]. Rasta farianism has employed an aspect of Christianity - the des cription of the returned King in Revelations - to establish an Ethiopian iconography still interpreted through extensive reference to the Bible. Similarly, Pentecostalism is a medium through which various indigenous and African related beliefs concerning spirit possession, spiritual travel and supernatural healing have received a metropolitan legitimation. Each of these religions is not so much an African religion as a recon ciliation between folk belief and Jamaican interpretations of</page><page sequence="6">6 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES the Christian text. That text in turn has been promoted in Jamaica by a range of different organizations with different affiliations. Only Rastafarianism is in fact a totally indigeous organization enmeshed in the medium of the Christian text nevertheless. Neither is it true to say that theMyal-Revival-Rastafarian triumvirate is aunivocal vehicle of'cultural resistance'. Rastas' political implications have been developed through its alliance with Garveyism, and through its role as a symbol of contem porary nationalism. Myal and Revival on the other hand, developed in periods prior to Jamaica's consolidation as an independent nation state. They were essentially localised forms of magico-religious control without the pan-Caribbean implications of the Rastatfarian doctrine. It is unlikely that they ever would have been vehicles for a black nationalism very much the product of a twentieth century politics and politicians who have sought to co-opt folk forms to their own particular ends. Rasta as a vehicle of nationalist politics has even to a degree become respectable in Jamaica. Notwith standing earlier hostility, it has recently received strong encouragement from sections of the middle class and from the intelligentsia. Pentecostalism, on the other hand, even with some political encouragement in the 1980s, has remained a relatively alien phenomenon for the middle class. Its apparent anti-nationalist bias has made it unwelcome to many Jamaicans remote from its ethos and practical concerns. Yet Pentecostalism, like Revival before it, has become a vehicle for folk beliefs highly critical of Jamaican's religious establishment. It has offered its own theological critique of Jamaican society. These remarks suffice to show that in Jamaica the logid of local and extra-local relations between religion, culture and politics is an extremely complicated one. While elites have the power to co-opt local movements to their extra local ends, so the folk have the ability to be cultural bricoleurs,</page><page sequence="7">Pentecostals and Rastafarians 7 turning foreign acquisitions like Pentecostalism to indigenous ly defined ends. Indeed, it is in this latter process that Pente costalism has assumed its relevance to and interrelations with Jamaican Rastafarianism. Both religions have made very immediate appeals to local Jamaicans and both religions have a range of significant political implications. Pentecostalism's rapid and pervasive indigenization in volves a number of different factors - the predominance of Jamaican evengelists in the field, a degree of ritual and theolo gical compatibility with Revivalism, its emphasis on healing in a folk culture much concerned with spiritual healers, and the informal networking between Jamaicans resident in Jamaican and the United States which makes an 'American' religion hardly strange in a Jamaican environment. Each of these factors might be explored at length, for in concert they help explain how a religion, ostensibly antipathetic to Jamaican nationalism, could have become integral to mass society; how a 'foreign' church could, in 1986, be the venue for a state sponsored service marking National Heroes' Day.4 In this regard, Pentecostalism presents two other charac teristics which deserve special attention. Like Rastafarianism, Pentecostalism in Jamaican hands has grappled with prejudicial notions of a moral inferiority among black people. This theme which has underpinned the strident racism of the New World certainly pervaded in some degree early churches in the region [Russell 44]. It has elicited in Jamaica, especially in this century, religions which underline the righteousness of black people. Rast a does this by pronouncing a New World dominated by whites as the Babylon from which black people should free themselves. Pentecostalism, with no specific reference to black people, nevertheless holds up the holiness or sinless state as an attainable goal for all who are saved and sanctified; a goal which is for more conventional Christians unreal and possibly blasphemous. When this doctrinal dif ference between pentecostal and denominational churches is placed in a Jamaican environment, Pentecostalism contextual</page><page sequence="8">8 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES ly defines its mainly poor and black adherents as a spiritual elite seeking the holiness state. Both creeds act to redefine the temporally improve rished as spiritually endowed. In additon, Pentecostalism is a religion ministered mainly by men which finds its following predominantly among women. Most forms of Christianity in Jamaica show a femi nine bias reflected in a muted fashion in census statistics, but more noticeable still in the weekly attendances at local churches. It is the remarkable growth of Pentencostalism in Jamaica's feminised religious world which gives it special interest as a form of Jamaican Christianity which makes its appeal mainly to women. Rastafarianism, by contrast, is one of the few Jamaican religions which the census clearly con firms as predominantly male. If there is a feminine bias in Jamaican religious observance generally, and Pentecostalism is a religion in Jamaica with a special appeal to women, this would explain one previously ignored dimension of its growth, and one reason for Rastafarianism's much more limited appeal. Rastafarianism and Pentecostalism may re present two religions concerned in gender specific ways with the righteousness of Jamaica's poor. The following discus sion demonstrates how the behaviour of women is integral to the definition of a working-class Pentecostalism,just as Rasta farianism is commonly articulated through a symbolism which is predominant male. We see the propensity of the two religions to appeal to different genders and the ideologi cal complex which they, along with a middle-class fundamen talism, constitute in Jamaica. Each religion addresses dilem mas familiar in the working-class, specifically those concerning Jamaican mating patterns and the matri-focal family. Each religion provides a strategy of redemption specific to its context and inter alia an interpretation of these Jamaican gender relations. Ultimately these faiths draw together issues of colour and moral worth through the medium of religion and its implications for domestic life. This issue of colour in</page><page sequence="9">Pentecostals and Rastafarians 9 turn gives these ostensibly local concerns wider political implications. Rastafarianism and Pentecostalism become not entirely strange companions, though companions in a com petitive mode. The analysis demonstrates that folk culture in Jamaica is an inherently ambiguous phenomenon shot through with the contradictions engendered not only by local conflicts but also by the extra-local relations of the region. It demonstrates that meaning itself, in the culture and history of a people, is created both internally and by engagement with a larger world. Certainly the analysis throws into question the rather simple notion of a folk religious tradition concerned with an African resistance. At the summation we consider another way in which the issue of the African heritage is relevant to these religions, and might be situated in analyses of Jamaican culture; a culture which has been forged in a highly politicized and eclectic sphere but which addresses, nevertheless, peren nial issues of the New World. WOMEN AND CLASS IN TWO PENTECOSTAL COMMU NITIES To introduce working-class Pentecostalism, let me des cribe a church I have been associated with since the 1970s [see also Austin 3,4]. In the late 1970s the church member ship numbered around 60, three quarters of whom were women. (In terms of regular weekly attenders the proportion of women is even higher.) The majority of members are either employed, or involved in marketing or personal service activi ties. Members of the church follow strict rules concerning dress and demeanour; they do not smoke or drink and are enjoined not to cohabit outside marriage. To this end domestic groups of Pentecostalists sometimes live in close proximity - even in the same yard - so that more stable practitioners can watch over more youthful, generally female adherents. The ritual of the church, particularly in the course of its</page><page sequence="10">10 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES Sunday evening evangelical services, involves united vocal prayer and boisterous chorus singing with tambourines, cymbals wrought from saucepan tops, and occasionally, electric guitar. There is prolonged testimony of the faith in which most members of the congregation participate. Their testimonies rehearse at length their personal suffering includ ing illness, unemployment, and problems with landlords. This testimony is interspersed with chorus singing and can conti nue for a number of hours. Testimonies also precipitate spirit possession, dancing in the spirit, vigorous glossolalia and shrieks of joy. Sermons concentrate on the theme of sin, especially fornication, and on the retribution which will be visited on the unrepentant. The senior pastor, now referred to as 'Elder' in the church, is reputed for his healing powers and keeps a phial of consecreated oil with which he anoints his followers to exorcise evil [cf. Glazier 23]. Doctrinally the emphasis in the church is on the attainment of the holiness state through a process of revelation rather than learning. Middle-class denominational religion is seen to represent tem poral laws rather than the laws of God, an intrusion of man into the proper domain of spirit. The Bible Way church5 has a savings account in the care of the evangelist who acts as clerk to the church. The church officers - the bishop who now resides overseas, the elder, the junior pastor, evangelist and deacons - receive only com pensation for expenses incurred in the church's business for the church is very poor and unable to support its pastors. Unlike Pentecostals in the country these urban saints are unable to support their leaders by gifts in kind. Although in principle they tithe, members simply try to give something to the church every week, and financial issues are discussed at the Sunday school which all attend, both adults and children. The leaders of the church have no formal training. The bishop and elder, both vendors in central Kingston, were called to the ministry through personal revelation. The</page><page sequence="11">Pentecostals and Rastafarians 1 1 younger pastor who grew up in the church also has received no formal training in the ministry and retains employment in a modest clerical position. Although this phenomenon of entirely untrained leadership is fast diminishing in pentecostal churches, historically it has been the typical situation. The bishop and pastors of the church are male, and some of the deacons are male also, but all those with spiritual gifts in the church are women. The three most notable are the evangelist who is reputed not only for her administrative skills, but also for her impact as a wayside preacher; another sister reputed for her hymn singing and prophecies concern ing illness and misfortune; and a third sister revered for her spiritual dancing which involves a distinctive shuffling pro gression right around the church, somewhat reminiscent of trumping in the Revival churches [Seaga 46]. This form of leadership constitutes a familiar pattern within Jamaican working-class and rural congregations. Although pastors and bishops can be women, they are more frequently men.6 These men, in turn, are held in great affection by their spiritual followers and generally are supported and often directed by a group of senior women accomplished both in spiritual and administrative affairs. Others in the neighbourhood consistently describe the church as a 'poco' or Pocomania church with the connotations that it is African derived, immoral and involved in the secret practice of obeah [cf. Beck with 9; Simpson 48]. This associa tion is based on rather vague criteria including the fact that evangelical services can continue long and loud, involve speak ing in tongues, a congregation primarily female and generally led by men, and moreover women who dress in white for their services. In addition, neighbourhood gossip asserted a few years ago that a deacon expelled from the church had rendered a number of saints pregnant, a common occurence, some residents maintain, in the 'poco' churches. Rejecting the spiritual propriety of middle-class religious ritual and con fronting this environment, the leaders of the church are com pelled to affirm the properly Christian nature of their enter</page><page sequence="12">12 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES prise against these charges of spurious healing and immorality. This is accomplished through vigorous preaching particularly to their young, largely female following, concerning the importance of chastity. This is an emphasis we will see below which also has a separate and important theological rationale. Older women of spiritual virtue are constantly brought for ward as paradigms of the Christian faith. These women, forthright and powerful in their presentation of the gospel, spend a great deal of time counselling and guiding the younger women. The product of this situation is an emphasis on revelation and on chaste women filled with the Spirit who are almost disdainful of men unless they are saved; a distinctly working-class puritanism at odds, these saints believe, with middle-dass mores. This complex of a preponderantly female church central ly concerned with the evils of fornication and with the loud and vigorous display of spiritual gifts is specific to the work ing class. A rather different church of God demonstrates the character of a lower middle-class fundamentalism . The pastor of the church when I was first associated with it was employed as an insurance salesman. His congregation numbered around 200 and was constituted of men and women employed as clerks in the civil service or in private enterprise, as primary school teachers, store managers, shop-floorwalkers and a few in own account business. Approximately 30 members of the church were much poorer Jamaicans who resided in a shanty town on the outskirts of the area. The church is one of around 90 congregations of the Church of God in Jamaica, a holiness church established in Jamaica in 1907. The church's activities are co-ordinated by an executive council which elects representatives to at least five boards including the general financial board, the board of Christian education, publica tions, church relations, and evangelism and missions. The properties of each local church are handled by a financial committee in the church and the local congregation is respon</page><page sequence="13">Pentecostals and Rastafarians 13 sible for appointing and financing its own pastor [Olsen 40]. Although it is unlikely that there is a completely uniform style of worship among all Church of God in Jamaica congre gations, certainly the ritual of this church complements the rather more secure status position of its congregation. The order of service for a Sunday evening differs little from the Bible Way church. But testimonies of saints seldom refer to their personal trials and present instead general celebrations of the goodness of Jesus. Sermons are generally related to one specific Bible passage and emphasise more the virtues of a 'born-again Ufe' than the sins of the outside world. Fornica tion is not an issue addressed in sermons and the pastor does not provide for the exorcism of evil spirits. Moreover, these saints do not regard baptism in the spirit, including speaking in tongues, or tarrying for the spirit as a necessary part of the born-again experience. Revelation, it is maintained, is an in tellectual rather than an emotional process evidenced by a water baptism and the ability and willingness to explain the faith to others. A deacon of the church gave me this reason for rejecting both the ritual of tarrying and in-filling of the spirit: ...to tarry and wait for manifestations is fleshy and is not part of God's programme. Many have gone on that, but wherever you find it there is confusion, and this is proof, because God is not "the author of confusion", so that is wrong. Apart from the purported association of spirit possession with immoral rites, the abandon of working-class women in the spirit is particularly offensive to men and women in this congregation which accepts at least some of the injunctions to female submission found in the Pauline epistles (see foot note 6). Indeed, one of the most marked contrasts between the working-class and middle-class church involves the differ ent roles and presence of women in the two congregations, ?n the middle-class church women are spiritually, socially and organisationally subordinate.</page><page sequence="14">14 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES All the major offices of the church except the women's association and the Sunday School are held by men, and they totally dominate the financial administration of the church. Many of the youth active in evangelism are also male, and the deaconate though populated by women is given a very sub dued role. Though particular women are recognised as prime examples of homely virtue, there are no women in the church reputed for their spiritual gifts. Indeed, the exclusion of glossolalia, prophecy, in-filling of the spirit, dancing, prolonged testimony and vigorous chorus singing from the ritual of the church means that the major area of female symbolic expres sion in the Bible Way church is excluded in this middle-class domain. The concern with formication, such a dominant part of the Bible Way church is also ignored. In a lower middle-class congregation that sees itself socially distanced from the working class by its very lack of common4aw domestic relations, the theme of fornication is not appropriate except in the context of missionary work among the poor. However, a concern with the control of the flesh remains in the liturgical debate over 'fleshy' manifestations. Where the working-class saints accept that physical excess can be sancti fied, these middle-class saints do not. Thus it is expunged from their doctrine, equated with other unsanctified excesses like fornication, and used as further evidence of the immorality of'ignorant' working-class practice. In Jamaica [Dreher and Rogers 21; A. Smith 50; Austin 2] and elsewhere, [Pope 41 ; Sundkler 53; Calley 12; Williams 58, but see LaRuffa 32, 33] accounts of working-class Pente costalism note the majority participation of women in these congregations. Hollenweger [28] in his wide-ranging discus sion of Pentecostalism in Africa, Europe, South America and the United States observes that "individual women with special talents can attain an extraordinarily high status, a fact which presents a remarkable contrast to the Pentecostal theological teaching about the position of women in the</page><page sequence="15">Pentecostals and Rastafarians 15 church", a reference once again to the Pauline injunctions. Such a wide ranging pattern suggests that some constant social and psychological factors are at work to precipitate this uniform prominence of women in the working-class environment. However, just as Sundkler argues in the case of Bantu Zion that special circumstances of the homelands promote the prominence of women, so for contemporary Jamaica there seem to be particular circumstances which con tribute to this situation. Again, fundamentalism is reputed for its puritanism concerning sexual matters. However, here also there seems to be a special contextual dimension to the Jamaican situation. To explore these issues it is useful first to consider that other major contemporary variant in Jamaican working-class religious life, Rastafarianism. RASTAFARIANISM AND PENTECOSTALISM The fundamental beliefs and practices of Rastafarianism have been rehearsed many times and reflect the changing social contexts of the movement [Simpson 47; Smith, Augier and Nettleford 51; Brown 11; Barrett 5,6; Chevannes 13; Nettleford 38:41-111; Owen 39; Tafari 54; Hill 26]. The rural working-class religion which once looked to the miracu lous arrival of boats to take Jamaicans back to Africa became feared by governments as a possible force for violence and revolution especially when it became assoicated with the more politically potent Garveyism. It was studied by acade mics from the university, and leading Rastafarians were sponsored by government on 'missions to Africa' to enquire about repatriation. Its more violent manifestations were countered by the force of the state, turning it inevitably in a quietistic direction. As middle-class Black Power advocates adopted elements of Rastafarian symbolism in the 1960s, so the Peoples' National Party (PNP) became involved in the same enterprise in the 1970s. Rastafarianism is a movement easily incorporated into contemporary notions of nationalism</page><page sequence="16">16 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES which stress a unified non-white people opposed to the domination of a white metropolis. The PNP's joint espousal of socialism and nationalism in the 1970s and early 80s allowed Rastafarianism to be incorporated as a complement to the anti-imperialist stand of more radical members. However, less radical politicians have seen Rastafarianism as a lumpen ideology likely to undermine the discipline required to rebuild the economy [de Albuquerque 1], and more recently Jamai cans have been encouraged to think of Rastafarianism prima rily as a cultural and aesthetic phenomenon. Rastafarianism's achievement has not been in the size of its religiously committed following, always relatively small [Waters 55:306], nor in forms of organisation which are notoriously weak [Nettleford 38; Stone 52], nor in its doctrinal clarity which is sometimes vague and often varied [Smith et. al. 5 1 ; Hogg 27; Waters 55:228], but in the contri bution it has made to rendering the word 'African' one with more positive connotations. Unfortunately this process of redefinition has not entirely succeeded among some working class and middle-class people for whom the word still carries ambiguous connotations. Nevertheless, the movement at least has sensitized Jamaicans to the fact of a 'white' Chris tianity which has pervaded Jamaican culture since emancipa tion. It has promoted an environment in which a large variety of Jamaican churches have sought to define their Christianity &gt; if not in 'African' terms, at least in terms they understand as Jamaican. Wedenoja [57] has argued that the Pentecostal move ment in Jamaica is a movement to small independent churches away from denominational ?mission churches. The Apostolic churches certainly exhibit this characteristic save for the United Pentecostal Church, and so do a significant number of the churches of God. Moreover, most of the leaders in these churches place a self-conscious emphasis on the spirituality of Jamaicans exemplified in the success of their own evangelism. The message of cultural autonomy encoded in Rastafarianism,</page><page sequence="17">Pentecostals and Rastafarians 17 elaborated by Garvey and also expounded by the middle class, curiously may have been instrumental in creating an appropriate climate for these churches to flourish. However, this observation poses the question of why Pentecostalism, even in the 1920s to 40s grew so rapidly in relation to Rasta farianism. Given Rastafarianism's early reputation as a har binger of revolution, the quick answer is that Pentecostalism drew the respectable working class as the rural based Revival religion in Jamaica; often it was associated closely with Poco mania and encountered enormous resistance especially in rural areas from denominational churches and local officials.7 Another explanation would point to the funds of the large American pentecostal churches, yet these funds, used primari ly in building programmes for established congregations, were not especially prevalent until the 1950s, and even then were unevenly distributed between the few large, and the many small, independent churches.8 Some commentators have mentioned, though few have elaborated on, the male-bias involved in Rastafarianism [Kitzinger 30, 31:585; Dreher and Rogers 21 ; Barrett 5, 32-3;Cumper 19, Nettleford 38; 106]. If indeed there has been a division according to gender in religious belief and practice this could explain the contempo raneous growth of two religious variants. Moreover, if it can be demonstrated that women might have had greater reason than men to order their world through religion, a further explanation of Pentecostalism's popularity and growth would be at hand. Let us consider the case of Rastafarianism. Leonard Barrett's [5] initial analysis of Rastafarianism suggested that subordination of women was very close to the heart of the movement. Barrett argued that the male work ing-class Rastafarian believes that the matrifocal household common in his class, developed out of slavery where black men could not be masters of their destiny and where their women became the prey of more powerful men. It there fore bacarne an 'African' practice to reject common-law</page><page sequence="18">18 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES forms of relationship. But after their 'changing of hands' which signifies marriage , it is only the woman who is enjoined to be faithful to her husband and not the Rastafarian man to his wife, for it is his duty to spread his seed as widely as possible to ensure the survival of the African race in the New World. In pursuing a reconstructed African paradigm, these Rastafarian men also may have been duplicating an image of the Jamaican middle-class family where men, due to greater financial security, traditionally have been able to care for their children and control a wife, whilst retaining comparative freedom in their own sexual relations [Henriques 24]. Certainly Nettleford [38:106] makes it clear that he is toying with this view when he observes of Rastafarianism that "The strong emphasis on the male suggests apatrifocal organi zation and a possible solution to what some people view as a major problem of Jamaican family organization viz. the household without a man at the head". The formal attitude of Rastafarianism to women is even more extreme than its Pentecostal counterpart. The follow ing account comes from Maureen Rowe [43:15] writing as a Jamaican Rastafarian: Females aie not called to Rastafari except through a male. Only a man can make a woman 'sight' Rastafari. ...Males are the physical and spiritual head of the female as well as the family. The female must seek the man's guidance in all things spiritual. He also accepts the responsibility for balancing' her thoughts. The female cannot share the chalice of the males. This excludes her from experiencing the communal nature of the culture in a direct way ... - The female should always have her head covered when praying (1 Corinthians 11:5-6). As she is always expected to be receptive to spiritual instruc tion it follows that the head should always be covered. An unclean female cannot approach a ritual gathering of m ales...nor should she prepare meals for any males during that time. ...The male/female role in Rastafari is further strengthened by the fact that the is seen to have come under the influence of Babylon and therefore stands in need of cleansing. The inter action between Jah and man cleanses the male and he in turn cleanses the female. Rowe details a number of modifications to this doctrine</page><page sequence="19">Pentecostals and Rastafarians 19 among Rastafarians with whom she is familiar. Nevertheless she acknowledges, like other commentators, that women play a subordinate and very minor role in working-class Rasta farianism. Now why should this be so when in the case of Pentecostalism a hostile code does not preclude women rising to prominence in particular spheres at least? In the working-class area that was my fieldsite there were no formally organised Rastafarian communes although many young men wore locks and espoused at least some of the doctrines of Rastafarianism. The activities they identi fied as 'Rastafarian' mainly involved dietary taboos, street corner socializing, (the majority were unemployed), partici pation in the neighbourhood gangs and 'reasoning' while smoking ganga [cf. Stone 52; Chevannes 16]. Interestingly, of the eight dreadlocks I knew reasonably well over a number of years, only one had a girlfriend or baby-mother who evidenced in any ritual way a strong commitment to Rasta farianism for herself and her children. None assumed the out ward garb of a Rastafarian woman. Moreover, evidence of such garb was very rare at the football matches we frequently attended which were major social occasions for Rastafarians in the area. In a reasoning with these local Rastas one day, my own position at the time as a married woman with no children was contemplated. Contraception as an explanation of the situation was not considered by these youths, one of whom observed to me, "Yu marry a weak man, daughter!" The conclusion was that only a white man could be so weak as to give his woman no children. I was in any case an object of some curiosity in the neighbourhood because youths of both sexes generally believed that bearing children confers adulthood; a woman apparently uninterested in bearing children was seen as something anomalous [cf. Brodber 10]. I relate this tale only in order to suggest that for the present and possibly for the past the explicit doctrines concerning women as set out by Rowe may not have been significant for many Rastafarian men. Certainly my Rasta friends could</page><page sequence="20">20 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES enunciate only very general formulae of male superiority, unconnected with specific Biblical truth. They saw procrea tion as a medium for expressing masculine power and as inte gral to their status as Rastafarians. However, their commit ment to procreation as an assertion of masculinity constantly was undermined by their inability to dominate or even con trol women they could not support economically. In the context of variable mating patterns and a high incidence of matrifocal households, Rastafarianism became an attempt to raise male status in lieu of a stable position in the household [cf. Cumper 19]. The issue of African manhood in the neigh bourhood context is thus articulated through sexual and domestic relations; Rastafarianism comes to complement a more diffuse cultural concern with the social, sexual and political efficacy of the black peasant and working-class male. This concern with male efficacy is seen nowhere more clearly than in the symbolism of Rastafarianism. Dennis Forsythe [22] contrasts the frequent use of the Lion as a symbol in Rastafarianism with the dominance of Anansi the spider tricker in traditional Jamaican folk culture. Forsythe offers an analysis of Anansi reminiscent of Elkins' account of the Sambo personality. The lion, by contrast, Forsythe suggests is a noble animal who bows to no-one. Brer Lion, or often in Jamaica, Brer Tiger is in fact Anansi's antithesis. Forsythe quotes from an Anansi story, "when Tiger whispers the trees listen. When Tiger is angry and cries out, the trees tremble. But when Anansi whispers no-one listens, when he shouts everyone laughs" [Forsythe 22:68]. Lacking Italian political theory's cyclical view of the struggle between the lion and the fox, Forsythe proposes that Jamai can history involves three cultural 'webs', Anansi. Judaic Christianity, and 'African-Original Vibrations' represented by the Lion. Forsythe [22:75] observes: Most Rastas attempt to become lions by attempting to syncretise and use all of these elements, as a means for their survival and progress. But some of these factors have ceased to be sources of strength - they have now ,</page><page sequence="21">Pentecostals and Rastafarians 21 become fetters and chains ... to hold back the development and expression of the more wholesome African vibrations. This attempt to construct a new and noble identity out of the purported degradation of the trickster is also remarked on by Barrett [6:142]: The lion represents not only the King of Kings, but the dominant maleness of the movement. The Rastafarians simulate the spirit of the lion in the way they wear their locks and in the way they walk. To the public the image of the lion suggests strength, dominance and aggressiveness. These comments suggest that Rasta has addressed issues that are not gender marked, but in a symbolism and social context which is. Moreover, even when Rasta does manifest itself in communal organisation, lack of an extensive liturgy may make domestic life with its concomitant subordination of women, a major focus [cf. Barrett 6:182-5]. The way in which a man defines the nature of his role as patriarch then determines to a large extent a woman's role as a Rastafarian 'queen'. She may indeed, as Nettleford [38:106] suggests, be the 'link' between her man and the larger society. How ever, the degree of her autonomy in this role is questionable, for her subordination is in fact an integral component of the male's leonine identity. Like Chevannes [14] I agree that Pen tecostalism and Rastafarianism are the two major develop ments out of Jamaica's rural based Revival religion. However, I would also suggest that Rasta, irrespective of its particular political message, has not been attractive to working-class women with religious sensibility simply because its ethic, symbolism and social context, more often address the con cerns of men. Can we make sense of working-class Pentecostalism in terms of the concerns of women? Here the picture is less clear and yet thought provoking. Traditionally the work available to women in Jamaica has been in three major sectors: agriculture, marketing, and personal service with a limited</page><page sequence="22">22 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES amount of factory process work. Despite these domains of female employment women household heads suffer unem ployment rates well over twice as high as men and generally have occupied highly vulnerable sectors of the economy. The class experience of women has been frequently more acute than that of men. Seldom enjoying a situation of mass collec tive employment, working-class women have been driven into intimate contact with other classes, experiencing in the face to-face relations of domestic employment for instance, the effects of both economic and status deprivation. Despite a history of dire economic circumstances, work ing-class women have higher fertility rates than their middle class counter-parts and are less likely to have stable mating relations in their childbearing careers. Both Cohen [17:424-7] and Mintz [36; Mintz and Price 37:40-2] have remarked on the expectations of working-class men that women should be financially autonomous even in the childbearing period. Cohen argues that men positively seek to avoid their paternal responsibilities. At the same time, as 1 have remarked, there is tremendous emphasis in working-class life on the demon stration of fertility as a proof of wifely capacity. Despite this preference for an early involvement in childbearing, women are reluctant to bind themselves to a man who cannot provide, particularly when men prove negligent in their parenting. As a consequence early explorations of sexuality often accom pany much later marriage and periods of enormous ambiva lence and uncertainty in the interim - a pride in maternity and distress at the vagaries of men [cf. Roberts 42:10-11 ]. This situation, also an historical situation for Jamaican women, was exacerbated in the first 20 years of this century when extensive ma?e emigration created a marked sex-ratio imbalance in Jamaica [Roberts 42:8]. The male emigration of the period was accompanied by a significant migration of women in Jamaica from agriculture into personal service, whilst those who remained in agriculture assumed the more onerous tasks of labourers in the sugar industry and on the</page><page sequence="23">Pentecostals and Rastafarians 23 smaller domestic farms [Lobdell 34]. We hear very little of the situation of these women left behind. Though they con stituted slightly more than 50 per cent of the workforce there was no real attempt to unionise them. Women were ready to acknowledge and follow political leaders cast in the heroic style but were offered little in the way of organiza tional infrastructure to ameliorate their position; a position which straddled the arenas of economic and domestic life, the poles of the political and the moral. Pentecostalism has been a religion with a mode of organi sation and a theology readily adaptable to the particular situation of these women. It does not simply allow but endorses the active participation of ordinary members in the church; the acquisition by women of a superior status general ly denied them in other areas. When women are converted to Pentecostalism they take up financial as well as spiritual obligations to the church. The religious duty to tithe is hedged about with other requests for missionary donations, building funds and tributes in kind to the pastor. The practi cal networks that the church supplies very often enable women to become or remain modestly viable members of the workforce through work sharing in the countryside and employment networks in town. Pentecostal saints do find work for each other, co-operate in marketing ventures and subsidise fellow members in severe need. Pentecostalists strive for economic self-sufficiency as a religious duty and fully expect this proficiency to come with maturing years. Conversion to Pentecostalism also articulates with the domestic lives of working-class women. The fact of adult baptism and sanctification has meant that women in their thirties with children born out of wedlock (a significant recruitment category in the churches), are not debarred from church membership. When saved and sanctified, their status as unwed mothers does not carry with it the permanent social stigma that traditionally has obtained in the denominational</page><page sequence="24">24 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES churches. If women live in extended households independent of their baby-fathers, sanctification relieves them of previous misdemeanour. Women in unions, whether cohabiting with men or not, have the opportunity once they are saved, to strive for sanctification through regularizing of the union. To separate from a spouse rather than cohabit with him if he will not regularise the union is a readily endorsed strategy in the churches and one which women occasionally follow. How ever, Jamaican unions show a tendency to stabilize over time and also to be regularized [Roberts 42:3]. As the process of being saved and sanctified can be quick or take a number of years Pentecostal doctrine in fact accomodates to Jamaican mating and domestic relations, whilst retaining a properly orthodox attitude to the sexual lives of followers. These organisational compatibilities are clothed in a theology which is particularly significant to women. Three particular themes stand out: the image of Jesus as companion and friend; the notion of blood as a purifying force; and the notion of the Holy Spirit as a mystical and genderless person that fills believers and makes them whole. Jesus plays no role in Rastafarianism for his pivotal place as redeemer in the Jesucentric faiths is taken by Ras Tafari who will return the brethren to Africa. However, for Pentecostal women Jesus is a brother, a companion, a friend, a very close and real assistance in times of trouble. A com mon theme in the testimony of women saints concerns the point at which they decided to 'give it all over to Jesus', to allow Him to guide their decisions on an everyday basis. Jesus and his temporal representative, the pastor, assume the identity of idealized patrons to these women. These are con fidants and comforters to the saints who draw spiritual sustance from Jesus as they materially sustain the pastor. Understandably the devotion these women can demonstrate towards a pastor is considerable. However, they also have the power to dislodge from a church a pastor they dislike or find</page><page sequence="25">Pentecostals and Rastafarians 25 spiritually unacceptable. Independent evangelists who cannot command the loyalty of such women inevitably find it difficult to sustain a ministry. The material dependency of pastors makes them attentive to the needs of their saints and in being so they generally minister effectively to their follow ers. Jesus and His pastor representative offer a constant spiri tual support to women whose usual experience is the vagaries of men in their social roles. The power a pentecostal woman derives through her association with Jesus finds her in an ordered environment in which she can act to contain adver sity and strive for influence and respect. This theological strategy runs parallel to and often substitutes for involvement in a social milieu infused with political patronage. The tradi tional use of hymns and prayers as part of local political meet ings suggests that Jamaican politicians understand the need to validate themselves by reference to the spiritual realm. 'Lean ing on the everlasting arm of Jesus', is a perennial hymn at political meetings which suggests an homology between spiri tual and temporal largesse. In this context the white icono graphy of Jesus assumes a different dimension as a spiritually perfected interpretation of the light-skinned majordomo s these women traditionally have relied on in political life. The cult of Jesus in Pentecostalism both reflects and supercedes Jamaica's culture of patronage politics. Saints are offered more than they can ever receive from politics, the inexhaus tible reservoir of salvation, and also through their material exchange some control over the pastor. The purifying nature of Jesus' blood, the blood sacrifice for sins, is emphasised in the Pentecostal churches as the one path to salvation and the one means to relieve sin. Both in hymns and testimonies the theme of guilt - the burden of guilt created by sin - is especially prominent. Although this sense of guilt is certainly cultivated by churches as a prelude to salvation, it appeals successfully to Jamaican women who are sometimes convinced that the unruliness of children, irregu lar sexual unions, poverty, sickness, and their "facestyness" [Ed: "facety " ? Jamaican for fast, fresh, forward]are due</page><page sequence="26">26 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES to their own unworthy state. This sense of unworthiness especially among younger women is exacerbated in everyday patterns of cursing which make female menstruation and the repugance of that phenomenon a central theme. Rastafarianism with its Levitical attitude to menstrual blood simply reflects and endorses this particular undercurrent in Jamaican gender relations. Jesus, however, is a different sort of man. He saved humankind through the shedding of his blood and thereby made the unclean clean. Blood, in the everyday temporal world associated with female imperfection, becomes through the symbolism of Jesus a powerful and potent symbol of good, even of perfection. Women, once they are washed in the blood, can also aspire to this perfection through the cleansing of their temporal lives. They assume power over their lives and a release from dependence on carnal men. The guilt of women, but the vileness of man is a major theme in Jamaican Pentecostalism. A description of heaven published by a prominent Kingston Pentecostal church des cribed it among other things as a place 'where men are holy as well as women'. A Pentecostal pastor once explained to me that when he was saved at the age of 17, he had only avoided the status of 'vile man' through the strict control of his Baptist parents - a delicate reference to his virginal state in the image of Jesus. Notwithstanding the central role of Jesus in this symbolic complex, it is in fact the genderless Holy Spirit that redefines these women's lives. The Holy Spirit cannot fill an unchaste woman, and thus a full commitment to Pentecostalism in a very real sense removes some women from a common dilemma: of continuing to prove their womanhood to men through procreation, and thereby exacerbating their economic vulner ability, or of remaining less vulnerable, but less a woman in the eyes of some men. Pentecostalism re-orders the priorities by exalting marriage to the Holy Spirit and demanding a temporal chastity realised either by sexual abstinence, or by confining sexual expression within the married state, prefer</page><page sequence="27">Pentecostals and Rastafarians 27 ably to a fellow saint. The explicit nature of this idea was underlined for me by a pentecostal pastor discussing the Unitarian doctrine of the Apostolic churches. He argued that trinitarian doctrine must be wrong because when women are saved they become 'the brides of Christ', a reference to the New Testament des cription of the church as a spiritual body, 'the Bride of Christ'. Taking up this notion in an anthropomorphic form, the pastor pointed out that if in fact there were three gods, the brides of Christ would be nothing but whores. His point was that the church, having saved women in Jamaica from whoredom, would not consign them there again. The godhead therefore, would needs be a unity. Some hymns and choruses used in the churches where I have worked demonstrate these themes: With reference to Jesus Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus He is a friend that's well known You have no other such friend or brother Tell it to Jeus alone. and again Shackled by the heavy burden, 'Neath the load of guilt and shame, But the hand of Jesus touched me, And now I am no longer the same. He touched me, And the Joy that filled my soul... He touched me and made me whole. On the cleansing power of Jesus' blood 111 be present when the roll is called Pure and spotless thro' the crimson flood I will answer when they call my name; Saved thro' Jesus' blood. And in relation to the Holy Spirit, Here like empty earthen vessels, Lying at the Master's feet,</page><page sequence="28">28 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES Small but clean through Jesus' merit, Wait till through thy work complete, Welcome, welcome, welcome, Holy Ghost, we welcome Thee: Come in power and fill thy temple, Holy Ghost we welcome Thee. There is no convincing evidence that becoming a bride to the Holy Spirit actually substitutes on a significant scale for the standard patterns of procreation in Jamaica.9 The core set of believers in any church who are saved and sancti fied is relatively small and women who display notable spiri tual gifts are generally over 40 years old. Women become deeply involved in this Jesucentric Christianity as they gradual ly pass their childbearing period. Evidence from elsewhere in the Caribbean suggests that they take up their union with the Holy Ghost and their communion with Jesus as an alternative to and liberation from a more confined and dependent domestic life [cf. Kerns 29]. Where younger women are con cerned, Pentecostalism does not always change the contours of their life. However, it offers them a spiritual rendering of their situation, a practical support, and also a means of terminating their childbearing period if they wish. Pentecostalism like Rastafarianism is not in essence a gender specific religion. However, in the Jamaican context it is fair to use Weber's term and speak of Pentecostalism's elective affinity' with the economic and domestic position of working-class women [Weber 56]. Pentecostalism is a religion more likely than Rastafarianism to be seen as akin to the female domain just as Rastafarianism in its idiomatic expres sions is more amenable to the aspirations of youth and young men. THE THREE VARIANTS RECONSIDERED Now it is time to see how these three religious variants fit into one larger set of ideological relations. The three forms of religions, working-class and middle-class fundamentalism</page><page sequence="29">Pentecostals and Rastafarians 29 and working-class Rastafarisnism, are bound together by a common concern with an issue of morality, or more explicitly how to control gender relations. The Rasta male and the working-class Pentecostal female have separate and conflict ing strategies for dealing with this situation. The Rasta man binds his 'queen' to him, but also makes a virtue of prolific procreation. Moreover, he does this in the name of the destiny of the nation. The Pentecostal saint argues that chastity is central to the holiness life and seeks to subordinate procreation to that life. Womanhood is now realised in the status of proper bride to the Holy Spirit. The Pentecostal thereby ensures her own individual salvation. The middle-class fundamentalists imply that the issue of sexuality is not problematic. Their holiness has brought them prosperity and with it the capacity to organise an orderly family life. These middle-class Christians instead turn their attention to the working-class and some times assert that it is a chain of immoral procreation that links the contemporary working-class with its past [cf. Austin 2]. They thereby seek to explain economic deprivation in terms of a moral degradation associated with African slavery and the absence of an orthodox religion. Both fundamenta lisms endorse the traditional saviour Jesus, against Ras Tafari, the African alternative. However, where the working-class Saviour welcomes folk expressions of spirituality, the middle class Saviour does not. All three religious variants however, recognise the ordering of domestic relations, particularly sexual life, procreation, and social relations between men and women, as an essential ingredient in strategies for salvation. That this should be so suggests that traditional notions of res pectability with their colour-class connotations, still imbue religious life in Jamaica. The middle-class fundamentalist group in its studied respectability showed remnants of the white bias which per vaded colonial society. That bias involved at its core an inter pretation of Africa and Europe through the medium of</page><page sequence="30">30 Pentecostals and Rastafarians religion; a Christianity which emphasised the significance of sin and its active agent, the Devil, in ordering the cosmos. The historical juxtaposition of good and evil with white and black all too often cast Africans in the role of gullible vehicles for the devil, and created in Jamaica a Manichean dimension to Christianity which is reflected in folk religion. It is the intermeshing of racial ideology and a cosmology of sin that Rastafarianism addresses when it pronounces the New World constructed by Europe a Babylon to be abandoned for the purity of Africa. Rastafarianism reverses the more normal cosmological order when it pronounces on the essential righteousness of Africans. Pentecostalism, on the other hand, has provided amore ambiguous response. Like Rastafarianism, Pentecostalism in Jamaica has firmly asserted the capacity of black people to be righteous - holy saints of God - almost by virtue of their lowly temporal state. However, this essen tially spiritual assertion which links Jamaicans with a pheno typically neutral God, is realised through a medium whose temporal reference points are mainly American. Moreover, the daily touchstone of this religion, the ever-present Jesus, is represented iconically as a fair-skinned man who is patron and friend; a representation which reflects and reinforces the colour-stratified nature of the Caribbean polity. Pentecosta lism has allowed Jamaicans to celebrate their capacity for spiritual redemption a capacity New World racism often denies - but within constraints that are politically significant for the region. Moreover, the capacity of Pentecostalism to encompass notions integral to Jamaican spirituality which are sometimes described as 'African' ? spirit travel and posses sion, tongues, the cleansing power of water and blood, and the efficacy of malignant spirits ? means that this is a religion which followers see as a vehicle of redemption and not as a foreign intervention. In conjunction with Rastafarianism's male bias these elements deflect Rasta's ideological thrust. Indeed, the Pentecostal pastor is a modem Anancy: the mediator of cultures and gender relations, the one who</page><page sequence="31">Pentecostals and Rastafarians 31 survives domination by consent, the persona Rastafarians have tried to put aside.10 Pentecostalism as much as Rastafarianism then, involves a patterned response to New World culture. Both religions in Jamaica seek to address the purported immorality of the African, and both offer a model of ultimate spiritual redemp tion. Both do this in Jamaica through addressing gender relations. Both religions established themselves in the early years of the nationalist period when Jamaicans of all classes began to address themselves self-consciously to the issue of race. It is this total context which makes these religions dis tinctively twentieth century phenomena; responses to a particular historical situation. What these sallies into new religion indicate, is a people ready to try different responses to an extremely intimidating environment. And moreover, an environment in which men and women are set even more than usually at war with each other as their lives are moulded and remoulded by a complex geo-political situation. It is certainly significant that even as Rasta began to evolve as a nationalist ideology, the politically more vulnerable sector of Jamaican society - the women of the workforce who lacked representation - were courted by a religion with con servative political implications. The religion grew strong through addressing effectively their immediate spiritual and practical needs. Pentecostalism thus became indigenized in Jamaica, and mainly through the evangelism of Jamaicans. In this very process it has become politically and culturally potent for the region. Rastafarianism, less obviously foreign, nevertheless is becoming less politically potent, not simply due to political manipulation, but also because it has failed to address the spiritual sensibility of large numbers of Jamaicans. If only the African and indigenous dimensions of religion are emphasised, this complex situation is hidden by a false dis section of Jamaican culture. CODA ON CULTURE Jamaican culture from the beginning has addressed the</page><page sequence="32">32 Pentecostals and Rastafarians historical issues raised by the founding of the New World. Jamaica is a society shot through with different competing resolutions to the conundrum of race and morality; a conun drum which very often finds its nexus in gender relations. Because Jamaicans have been a mobile people traditionally travelling within their region and often beyond it, they are more than usually reflective about their history and their contemporary situation. The African heritage within Jamaica is not then a heritage of static categories and practices, but a heritage of issues, questions and conflicts concerning a people and its place in the cosmos. Jamaicans, especially through the medium of religion, continually ponder their African descent, for their identity as Africans constantly brings them closer to the people of the book, the Israelites, who were also enslaved. The instability of Jamaica's economy which confers regular and intense suffering on generations of descendants keeps alive the issue of an unjust world which accomodated slavery. Inevitably, different historical periods present dif ferent aspects of the issue, and different resolutions to ques tions concerning the nature of black people, their past and their destiny. Though Jamaica as well as the Caribbean region is fraught with instances of metropolitan hegemony, if Pente costalism is any guide, these hegemonies endure only as they are turned to address this central issue of Caribbean culture. The essence of Jamaican culture may not be found then in the fact of survivals, symbolically important as these survivals may be, but in the skill and sensitivity with which Jamaicans, men and women, nurture their awareness of an African past even as they embody the political constraints of the region. Ironically a number of saints have explained to me that Pente costalism is more popular than other Christian forms in Jamaica because it allows expression to their African spiritu ality.</page><page sequence="33">Pentecostals and Rastafarians 33 FOOTNOTES iThis essay has been in preparation for quite some time, and has benefited from the help and/or suggestions of the following colleagues: Joan French, Keith Hart, Elizabeth Pigou, Carl Stone and Connie Sutton. The research was funded by the Australian Research Grants Scheme. 2An accurate estimation of nominal affiliation to the Pentecostal faith must take into account both the categories *Church of God' and 'Pentecostal'. Only a small proportion of Church of God affiliates are not Pentecostal. These latter generally follow the holiness doctrine alone. See Table 1. 3My rough estimation is, having conferred with officials from the peak Organisations of the Pentecostal movement - the Pentecostal Union (Apostolic) and the Association of Full Gospel Churches - that just over a half of Pentecostals in Jamaica are affiliated with churches that have a direct American connection. 4This service was held in Pastor Carmen Stewart's church, herself a great contemporary nationalist and worker for the poor. Pastor Stewart's work, among others, makes anomalous a common view that Pentecostalism is per se a foreign phenomenon in Jamaica. 5This is a fictitious name for a church situated in East Kingston. ^The Pauline injunctions (1 Corinthians 11:5-6, 14:34-5, Ephesians 5:22-3 ; Timothy 2:8-15) provide theological reasons why women are disinclined to be pastors. However, only one male bishop I interviewed actually stipulated that his church would not have women pastors. Most explained the lack of women pastors in terms of portability - mature women with children find it difficult to move from place to place every few years. More diffuse gender considerations also seemed to prevail; i.e. the idea that women simply did not like to assume authority positions over men in the church. 7Rural Pentecostalists in the parishes of Manchester, Clarendon, St. Ann and St. Mary related many stories to me concerning physical violence wrought on early Pentecostal meetings and the exclusion of converts from local public office and from teaching positions. These stories pertained to the period 1920 to 1937. ^The inter-censal period which shows most rapid growth is 1923-1943. Of the major churches with American affiliations only the New Testament Church of God and the Church of God of Prophecy were active for this entire period. The Assemblies of God began only in 1937, and the United Pentecostal Church was during this period under a Jamaican bishopric. Church of God officials have emphasised that large-scale building programmes occurred only from the 1950s, and had ceased by the end of the 1970s.</page><page sequence="34">34 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES 9Two rather different types of attempt have been made to measure the impact of religion on fertility in Jamaica. Roberts and Sinclair [42:107-9] measure knowledge about reproduction according to religious affiliation. Baptists and Church of God affiliates score lowest. The International Statistical Institute in its September 1984, Scientific Report (no. 57), measures fertility for the cate gories 'Church of God' and 'other Protestant'. Unfortunately these categories do not demarcate clearly Pentecostals from other protestant types in Jamaica. l^The larger Pentecostal churches still recruit their pastors from the poorer sections of Jamaican society, both rural and urban. Their various Bible colleges and American connections can offer young men with relatively little education an interesting avenue of mobility with no real counterpart elsewhere in the society. Clusters of young male aspirants to the ministry, acting as deacons, are noticeable at most successful Pentecostal churches.
