Cushing's field techniques, however, were as good as those of his contemporaries, and he tried to give meaning to what he found and to shed light on the past, rather than simply dig for rare and beautiful ob- jects for museum exhibition. Baxter comments on the archaeological attitude that he himself ac- quired, presumably from Cushing: "The circum- stances under which objects are found, particu- larly when observed by one competent to make deductions from these circumstances, are fre- quently of even more value than the objects themselves in their relation to the main purpose of such explorations-the understanding of the people of whom they are relics" (p. 168). This volume is a promising beginning for an ambitious long-term project that Hinsley and Wilcox have set for themselves. The Hemenway Expedition was without precedent in American archaeology, and knowledge of it is central to the history of the development of American southwestern archaeology. The public attention the expedition received through Baxter's popular journalism was a significant force in the growing interest in America's pre-Columbian past. The Antiquities Act of 1906 and the creation of ar- chaeological national monuments owe a great debt to this developing public interest in and un- derstanding of archaeology. DOUGLAS R. GIVENS Vincent G. Potter. Peirce's Philosophical Per- spectives. Edited by Vincent M. Colapietro. xxviii + 212 pp., app., bibl. Bronx, N.Y.: Ford- ham University Press, 1996. $30 (cloth); $16.95 (paper). Vincent Potter emphasizes a characteristic of Charles Peirce's work that deserves more atten- tion: the systematic nature of his thought. Born in Boston in 1839, Peirce was the son of a promi- nent mathematician. He was initially trained in chemistry at Harvard University and spent many decades as a scientist in the employ of the United States Coast and Geodetic Service (now the Na- tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra- tion). His philosophy of science was developed in the field. Before his death in 1914 he pub- lished numerous scholarly articles and reviews. Some thousands of pages of manuscripts remain unpublished, although two major attempts to an- thologize his work have been undertaken, the most recent a chronological edition to be com- pleted in twenty volumes within the next cen- tury. In a series of essays, Potter has attempted to synthesize, as he believes Peirce would have, certain disparate aspects of Peirce's philosophy into a more coherent whole by using the pub- lished editions of Peirce's work. Although Pot- ter's essays were edited posthumously by Vin- cent Colapietro, Potter had virtually completed the selection before his death with the objective, as Colapietro says, of gathering together pieces that "had been subjected to the critical review of scholarly colleagues." The result, however, is that, with the exception of a central core of a half dozen essays that will interest philosophers and historians of science, Peirce's Philosophical Perspectives is not itself systematic. It is more a vehicle for Potter's work than a comprehensive reconstitution of Peirce's ideas. Several difficul- ties intrinsic to the study of Peirce may account for the fragmentary nature of this book. First, Peirce' s system is hard to track in the collections of published works so far available to us, and Potter does not seem to have made use of manu- script sources. Second, the system itself is vast, complex, and both ingenious and radically novel, employing many of its own proofs in or- der to make further points or more mature infer- ences. Potter demonstrates a strong feel for over- coming the second difficulty in Essays 3-6, on normative science and pragmatism, and in "Peirce's British Connection," an essay survey- ing Peirce's relationship to the ideas of Duns Scotus, John Stuart Mill, and Alexander Bain (although not to the ideas of Darwin and Spen- cer). Readers of Potter's core essays will find lucid commentaries that reveal Peirce's participation in the nineteenth-century debates on realism and nominalism currently being revisited by philos- ophers and scientists. Peirce takes the side of "scholastic realism," supporting the notion that generals or conceptual structures are real and ubiquitous in both mind and nature. Potter dis- cusses Peirce's contribution to the question of how scientific inquiry can and should be under- taken in the context of an architectonic scheme that utilizes aesthetics, ethics, and logic as nor- mative sciences for the natural sciences. The unique method Peirce invented and developed, "pragmatism," is distinguished from the prag- matism of William James and others and defined as a tool for the conduct of scientific inquiry and for discovery. In presenting the relationship be- tween James and Peirce, Potter adheres to the customary view that it was cordial, but he does not neglect to detail James's and Peirce's exact philosophical differences. Thus the picture of a lively and significant professional antagonism emerges. 556</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 88: 3 (1997) This book is worth reading for Potter's voice-that of a thinker who has taken the ideas he writes about to heart and measured their weight by their usefulness in questions as ab- stract and intellectual as the relationship of phi- losophy to science and as personal as whether anthropomorphic conceptions (of God) are better or worse for being anthropomorphic. PATRICIA TURRISI Charlotte G. Borst. Catching Babies: The Pro- fessionalization of Childbirth, 1870-1920. xiv + 254 pp., figs., tables, app., index. Cambridge, Mass./London: Harvard University Press, 1995. $39.95. This meticulously researched and engagingly written contribution to the history of American midwifery is a fascinating account of the role midwives played in women's lives at the end of the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth. Charlotte Borst is impatient with the various historical narratives on the subject of childbirth that have assumed much with little ev- idence, and she sets the record straight on a num- ber of historical issues in a study that is sensitive to gender, ethnicity, race, and class. Her book is a significant contribution to our understanding of the experience of birth in this country and of the professional and social contexts in which it oc- curred. The local study (of four counties in Wiscon- sin) is essential to the author's ability to trace with great precision the transition from midwife to obstetrician, and Borst is especially adept at weaving qualitative and quantitative evidence together without interrupting the flow of her story. Beginning with a detailed description of the midwife in her social and ethnic milieu, Borst demonstrates the extent to which the entire birth- ing process was embedded in traditional com- munal and gender relationships. She argues that although by the end of the century reliance on neighbor women who had received informal training gave way to deliveries by more educated practitioners, some of whom actually attended new midwifery schools, midwife deliveries were always distinct in their social and economic meaning from the practice of either medicine or nursing, both of which had begun to become pro- fessionalized by this period. Distinguishing midwifery from medicine and nursing, especially in her discussion of the meaning and outcomes of professionalization, enables Borst to explain a great deal about the decline of midwifery in the twentieth century, contradicting historians' romantic assumptions that midwifery was suppressed from above by angry doctors who were determined to repel en- croachments on their professional territory. Al- though Judith Leavitt's work has already called into question previous scholarly assumptions about doctors' domination of patients, Borst shows us why, from the perspective of midwives themselves, there was little impetus to profes- sionalize. Her work offers an alternative ap- proach to the interaction between medical pro- fessionals and other birth attendants at the turn of the century, reevaluating assumptions about power relations and female agency to create a much more complex portrait than we have had heretofore. Especially noteworthy is her contri- bution to our understanding of the relationship of ethnicity, acculturation, and medicine. Thanks to Borst's sensitivity to the ethnic context, we see how communal ties among various urban and rural ethnic groups, together with traditional gender assumptions, shaped the fate of mid- wives. Unlike interpretations presented from the doctors' perspective-in which the persistence of midwifery into the first several decades of the twentieth century signified ignorance and lack of adequate acculturation-Borst's account traces a gradual transition from midwife to doctor, a tran- sition tempered by communal ties and one that doctors could only imperfectly regulate. Even when ethnic women willingly visited a physi- cian, they chose a doctor who shared their back- ground, ethnicity, and social outlook. Also intriguing is Borst's assessment of the effect of physician education on the transition from midwife to doctor. She notes that in ob- stetrics the professionalization process was slower than in other specialties, so that, for one disjunctive moment, while elite obstetricians called loudly for the suppression of midwifery in favor of physician-managed care, medical education could not keep pace. General practi- tioners were often no more skilled than mid- wives. According to Borst, the medicalization of childbirth was a two-step process: general prac- titioners entered the arena first, and specialists who practiced almost exclusively in hospitals then followed. Catching Babies is a fine study, a contribution not only to the history of medicine and science but to women's history and ethnic history more broadly.
