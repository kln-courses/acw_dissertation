<plain_text><page sequence="1">"They honor our Lord among themselves in their own way" Colonial Christianity and the Illinois Indians CHRISTOPHER BILODEAU In 1666 when the Jesuit missionary Claude Allouez first met Illinois Indians at his mission of Saint Esprit on Chequamegon Bay, he could scarcely believe their enthusiasm for Christianity. They were, he wrote, "the fairest field for the Gospel" in New France. Though he barely understood their Algonquian dialect, Allouez discovered that they lived "sixty leagues hence toward the South," and that "[t]hey used to be a populous nation, divided into ten large Villages; but now they are reduced to two, continual wars with the Nadouessi [Sioux] on one side and the Iroquois on the other having well-nigh exterminated them." But most important, Allouez wrote, they "worship one who is preeminent above the others ... because he is the maker of all things," and they all longed to "see" this powerful manitou, or spirit, which "greatly facilitates their con- version" to Christianity. He thought that he only needed to replace this single manitou with the Christian God, tell the Illinois how to worship him, and they would convert. Allouez wrote that he preached about Jesus Christ to eighty Illi- nois traders and helped them worship their new God. "They honor our Lord among themselves in their own way," he wrote, "putting his Image, which I have given them, in the most honored place on the occasion of any important feast, while the Master of the banquet addresses it as follows: 'In thy honor, O Man-God, do we hold this feast; to thee do we offer these viands.' " The Illinois then traveled home from Saint Esprit and told their people of the Christian God. "[C]onsequently," Allouez wrote, "I can say that this Mission is the one where I have labored the least and accomplished the most."' Scholars of religious contact between Europeans and American Indians dur- ing the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have used stories like Allouez's to argue vastly different points. Some argue that religious conversion was a rela- tively simple act, as Indians, convinced by the rhetoric of missionaries, under- stood Christian concepts as the missionaries themselves did.2 Others argue that missionaries failed in any way to convert Indians to Christianity. They 352 Bilodeau: Colonial Christianity and the Illinois Indians</page><page sequence="2">claim that Indians either understood that conversion would bring cultural de- struction and instead used the missionaries to get access to material benefits, or that Europeans understood their world so differently than the Indians that the missionaries could not adequately translate Christianity to them.3 All of these scholars in turn have been critiqued by those who contend that conver- sion is much more complicated. They attempt instead to highlight and de- scribe how each group approached and understood religious contact and used that cultural interaction to create new lives.4 Scholars have yet to explore closely this complexity in the case of Indian people who made up the Illinois Confederation, however. Most historians and anthropologists examining the Illinois country of the seventeenth and eigh- teenth centuries have focused on the French.s The few that examine the Illinois Indians fail for the most part to engage the religious and missionary history of the Illinois, opting instead for population studies or narratives of diplomacy and war.6 This essay attempts to fill this gap with an analysis of Illinois Indian religious culture and Illinois-French missionary contact. Missionaries and other European observers during the colonial period wrote much about their contact with American Indians, and their writings give historians a perspective on how Indians viewed and understood their world, the events of their time, the contact with Europeans, and Christianity. Various factors played into Illinois motives to embrace Christianity in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Wars with the Iroquois, Sioux, and other tribes had devastated the Illinois, forcing them to look for advantages over their enemies. The Illinois believed that French trade and knowledge could bring them protection and power. They believed that this power came in part from a Christian God who, if they worshipped him, would aid them in war, bring peace to their country, and stem their depopulation-in effect, would help them rejuvenate their culture.7 But these motives only partly informed the Illinois' decision to adopt aspects of Christianity and, therefore, tell only part of the story. When confronted with an Indian group acting in ways understood by the French as spiritual, the French missionaries believed that the Illinois would be an ideal group to con- vert, a people who would easily transfer their devotion from their manitous to the Christian God and would discard their "traditional" spiritual practices. But actual conversion is much more complicated, and the Illinois and the French missionaries understood it differently.8 When the French priests observed the Illinois seemingly comporting with Christian worship, they assumed the Illi- nois understood that worship as the French did. However, the Illinois viewed themselves and the world in which they lived in vastly different ways from the French. Like many Indian groups throughout North America, the Illinois had AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 2001/VOL. 25, NO. 3 353</page><page sequence="3">a complex understanding of their world based on centuries of ritual and myth.9 This mentality permeated Illinois' attitudes toward everything in their environment, such as people, places, and phenomena.10 To convert to Christianity, the Illinois relied on their precontact mentality- one based on their physical surroundings-to rationalize and understand a religion based on a decidedly foreign mentality. The term "physical" has sev- eral different meanings within Illinois ideology. One aspect of this definition of "physical" is "worldly." "Worldly," as opposed to "otherworldly," reflects the importance of the Illinois' environment in answering their religious ques- tions. To the Illinois such objects of spiritual importance as manitous rested in their environment. Manitous could reside in any object in that environ- ment-an animal, a bird, a river, or a rock-and the Illinois would then use these spiritual, "worldly" objects to explain the world around them. And they interpreted Christianity in the same way. The Illinois made no distinction be- tween what could or could not be spiritual within their environment, nor did they separate a spiritual realm from a physical one. The Illinois viewed every "worldly" object in their environment as a potential spirit, and this view had interesting effects on how the Illinois practiced Christianity. The second aspect of the definition of "physical" is "material," which re- flects the importance of material benefits to the Illinois. The Illinois based their relationships with both humans and manitous in part on material exchanges. The material they exchanged could range from tobacco and furs, like any or- dinary economic trade, to a gift of one's self, like hospitality. Either type of mate- rial always demanded some type of recompense. A manitou proved its worth, for example, by generously reimbursing its worshippers after they sacrificed. But when the Illinois looked to Christianity with this "material" mentality, they at times practiced the religion in ways that many European Christians would find inappropriate, even alarming. The Illinois made traditional sacri- fices to the Christian God, or expected tangible, material benefits for their wor- ship. Arguments over the material elements of the rite of baptism between the Illinois and French missionaries occasionally erupted into violence. Combined, the "worldly" aspects and the "material" aspects of the Illinois mentality help to explain and clarify how the Illinois interpreted Christianity."I They can help to explain how the Illinois understood, interpreted, and practiced the religion of the Jesuit missionaries and can perhaps lead to insights into Na- tive American mentalities during the period of European colonial contact. The "Illinois Confederation" was a large conglomeration of Indian groups, made up of Peoria, Kaskaskia, Cahokia, Tamaroa, Moingwena, Tapouaro, Co- iracoentanon, Chepoussa, Espeminkia, Chinkoa, Maroa, and Michigamea In- dians. Some Miami Indians, who spoke an Algonquian-based language simi- 354 Bilodeau: Colonial Christianity and the Illinois Indians</page><page sequence="4">lar to the Illinois, shared a common mythology with the Illinois, and lived in Illinois villages, also belonged to the confederation. The confederation was comprised of roughly ten thousand people in the 1670s. Between 1650 and 1700, all of these groups converged on the Illinois and Mississippi River Valleys to form three concentrations of Illinois villages: one on the northern section of the Illinois River near Starved Rock, one at Cahokia at the mouth of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, and one at Kaskaskia, at the mouth of the Mississippi and Kaskaskia Rivers. After 1700 the Peoria, Kaskaskia, Cahokia, Michigamea and Tamaroa absorbed all the other groups into their ranks.12 When the French first contacted members of the Illinois Confederation in 1666, French officials of the Crown and Church believed that the future of New France lay in the Illinois country. The French government hoped to exploit the land's resources, mostly for its furs. French traders began to move into these areas of the Illinois country looking for possible avenues of trade.13 French mis- sionaries soon followed French traders into the Illinois country looking for souls to convert. Father Jacques Marquette, who in 1669 took an interest in find- ing a river that flowed to the south, leapt at the chance to join the adventurer Louis Jolliet on an exploratory expedition to the American interior, on which they found the Mississippi in 1673. On their route down the Illinois River to the Mississippi, they encountered the Illinois Indians.14 Marquette established the mission of Immaculate Conception among the Kaskaskia Illinois on the north- ern Illinois River in April of 1675.' He was the first of a number of missionaries who traveled to the Illinois country to participate in what they thought could be the most successful mission in New France. Claude Dablon, a Jesuit mission- ary who worked with Marquette and became ecclesiastical superior of New France in 1670, wrote that the Illinois Confederacy "will swell the church, for they are well disposed toward Christianity." The French continued to praise Illinois enthusiasm for Christianity throughout the early years of the Illinois missions. They believed that the Illinois would be the ideal Indian converts.16 They believed this, and wrote such glowing appraisals of the Illinois, because they oversimplified the reasons why the Illinois embraced Christianity. The Illinois understood Christianity in complicated ways, as part of the package of French colonialism in the area. They saw the French as potential allies. They welcomed first French goods, which they acquired from the French and other Indians to the north, and then encouraged French forts and settlers, with the military might and trade opportunities that they brought. "Having been intro- duced to firearms and gunpowder, dyed cloth and brass kettles," Eric Hinder- aker remarks, "many of the Illinois Indians were quite prepared to be initiated into the rites of power appropriate to the 'god of iron.'" '7 But many Illinois Indians embraced Christianity in ways different from how the missionaries intended. And in order to understand how the Illinois came to AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 2001/VOL. 25, NO. 3 355</page><page sequence="5">understand Christianity, the Illinois religious mentality needs to be clarified.'18 This is no simple task-as the missionaries themselves discovered. "It would be difficult to say what the religion of our Savages is," pondered the Jesuit Ga- briel Marest in a letter to a Father Germon from his mission at Kaskaskia in 1712, though he went on to write that "it consists solely of certain superstitions, by which their credulity is gratified." 19 "All of their knowledge is limited to the knowledge of animals, and the needs of life," he continued, mockingly, "so it is to these things that all their worship is limited." His words point to a crucial element of the Illinois ontology--that they comprehended their world with a mentality based on their physical surroundings.20 The Illinois in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries emphasized the spirituality of things "worldly"-physical objects in their everyday envi- ronment. "Worldly" in part reflects elements of Illinois ontology, or sense of being in the world. For the Illinois, this sense rested in an important way on their relations with spirits, or manitous. The word manitou meant, in various con- texts, "power," "mystery," and "medicine," but its most important definition to the Illinois religion was "spirit." Here the work of A. Irving Hallowell on the Ojibwes is key. Hallowell argues that for the Algonquian-speaking Ojibwe In- dians, manitous are understood as "other-than-human persons." These other- than-human persons can take the shape of things Europeans and Americans would certainly understand as inanimate objects, while for the Ojibwes they had animate properties, were anthropomorphic, and could change shape. All events and actions-from thunderstorms to illnesses-were caused by these other-than-human persons, thereby making causation always personal. The Ojibwes made no distinctions between natural and supernatural, as European Christians did, for they had no concept of an impersonal nature. The Ojibwes understood their relations with certain plants and animals-in which could reside other-than-human persons--as if they were dealing with persons who can understand and react to what humans say and do. The ability to transform one's shape reveals implicitly the Algonquian hierarchy of power: other-than- human persons are more powerful than humans, in part because they can do things human beings cannot do, such as change shape. They are not different from humans in kind, but rather in degree.21 The Illinois understood their manitous in the same way. A manitou resided in the normal, everyday objects in the Illinois' world, ranging from animals, trees, and rocks to the moon and the stars. These manitous were not under- stood as being categorically different from the Illinois themselves and were of the same ontological makeup as any man or woman. The Illinois related to them on a personal level, as they related to one another. And manitous were the ul- timate cause of all phenomena, from violent storms to victorious battles, and the Illinois needed to handle manitous with extreme care, treating them with 356 Bilodeau: Colonial Christianity and the Illinois Indians</page><page sequence="6">respect, and, at times, with awe. The existence ofthese manitous, in other words, situated the Illinois and other Algonquian Indians within their world, for the Illinois used manitous as a way to explain not only the causes of phenomena in their environment but also their proper place within that environment.22 Manitous varied in power and importance for the Illinois. In general, the Illinois maintained two sets of manitous: overarching manitous that affected the group as a whole and personal manitous that both protected and assisted individual Indians, serving also as a foundation of personal identity. The over- arching manitous were often the most powerful manitous for the Illinois. Al- louez hinted at one important one, the sun. As with a number of central Al- gonquian Indians of the pays d'en haut, or Great Lakes region, as well as many groups of North American Indians, the sun was a central manitou of the Illi- nois, which they called Manitoua assouv, or "Great Spirit." 23 The Manitoua as- souv, like most manitous, delivered to the Illinois the things they needed to live, like rain and successful hunts. The manitou of war, which took the shape of a bird, was invoked to bring speed to Illinois warriors that would terrify their en- emies.24 Other manitous, such as Michipissy, or "Great Panther," who created winds and storms when it waved its enormous tail, would receive homage when the Illinois needed clement weather for travel.25 Allouez told Marquette that the Illinois "worship the Sun and Thunder," thus betraying his European Christian ways in understanding spirituality.26 He did not understand that the Illinois revered the manitou of the sun, and he assumed that their reverence equated to a Christian worship of God. But the end result was the same, as his words point to the fact that the religious world of the Illinois rested on the world around them because that was what they recognized as reality.27 In addition to this group of overarching manitous, spirits with whom the Illinois needed to maintain proper relations as a group, the Illinois recognized personal manitous, manitous that related to, protected, and possibly bestowed certain powers upon individual Indians. The Jesuit Sebastien Rale, when talking about the Ottawas in a letter to his brother in 1723, wrote a passage on Algon- quian religion that can apply to the Illinois as well as all central Algonquians. "Besides [the] common Manitous," Rale wrote, each person has his own special one, which is a bear, a beaver, a bustard, or some similar animal. They carry the skin of this animal to war, to the hunt, and on their journeys,- fully persuaded that it will preserve them from every danger, and that it will cause them to succeed in all their undertakings."28 RAe also noted that once someone acquired a personal manitou, usually in the early teen-age years, that manitou would remain a constant companion, guide, and protector for that individual for the rest of his or her life.29 The Illinois dealt with these manitous, and all manitous in general, through AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 2001/VOL. 25, NO.3 357</page><page sequence="7">ritual. Young Illinois inaugurated their relationships with personal manitous through the vision quest, one of the most important methods of manitou wor- ship. Common among Algonquian Indians, the vision quest inaugurated the spiritual life of all individuals. When Illinois children reached puberty, they would go into the woods alone and fast. After four or five days without food, these children usually dreamed of a figure, normally an animal or a bird, but often another form, which they would interpret as their own personal mani- tou for life, one that would reappear at certain crucial times to guide, warn, help, or instruct. This dream was not a qualitatively different state of being, or solely a product of the mind, but was simply another state of reality, as life when awake. In the words of Lee Irwin, the visionary dream was "recognized as a form of encounter with mythically defined sources of personal empowerment and as a manifestation of the mysterious contents of a visionary world."30 Therefore, dreams of all kinds, not just those associated with the vision quest, received careful consideration by the Illinois.31 The Illinois continued to use this mentality after missionaries arrived in their country. Although receiving news of the Christian God with apparent re- spect and wonder, they used their precontact mentality to understand him. They linked their sun god Manitoua assouv with the Christian God, perhaps believing that the Christian "Man-God" inhabited a human's body on earth, mirroring the existence of an Illinois manitou.32 Jacques Marquette described a similar belief on his first trip down the Mississippi River in 1673, when he stopped at a Peoria village. The village leaders, after Marquette told them of the powers of his God, expressed amazement and happiness. One declared, "It is thou who Knowest the great Spirit who has made us all. It is thou who speak- est to Him, and who hearest his word. Beg Him to give me life and health, and come and dwell with us, in order to make us know Him." 33 As they embraced this new Christian God, the Illinois did not accept the French insistence that they worship only him.34 For the Illinois, different worldly spirits caused different worldly phenomena, and they continued to believe this even after they were taught of the Christian God. They did so by viewing Chris- tian objects as manitous themselves. For example, the Illinois revered chapels as manitous of protection. Kaskaskia and Peoria Illinois Indians, devastated by Iroquois and Sioux attacks, traveled from the Illinois River and present-day Iowa to the southern tip of Green Bay to live near the French, settling next to the chapel at the mission of St. Frangois Xavier. Claude Allouez noted in his Re- lation of 1673-74 that he believed that these Illinois had traveled this distance "in the conviction that the house of God will protect them, and keep them safer than they formerly were." "Sometimes," he continued, "even in their councils they address their speeches to this house of God, and speak to it as to an ani- mate being."35 The Illinois believed that the Christian God warranted the kind 358 Bilodeau: Colonial Christianity and the Illinois Indians</page><page sequence="8">of respect and adoration that they previously reserved for their Manitoua as- souv but also continued to recognize other manitous that surrounded them. Even if the Illinois had stopped recognizing all other manitous and focused on the Christian God, they still would have had to act out that relationship, acts that rested just as much on their worldly mentality as did the manitous them- selves. Dreams provide a telling example. After French missionaries moved into the Illinois country, the Illinois continued to view dreams as necessary parts of their spiritual lives. However, they now began to incorporate Christian themes and rites to understand these dreams. An Illinois Christian whom Ga- briel Marest called Henri is a case in point. Henri and his family all contracted a fatal disease -most likely smallpox--in the early 1700s. His wife and several of his children died. "When he thought he had only a few moments longer to live," Gravier wrote of Henri, "he imagined that he saw the Missionaries, who restored him to life, opened to him the gate of Heaven, and urged him to en- ter there. From that moment he began to grow better." Once he was strong enough to travel, Henri and his surviving family moved to the Kaskaskia mis- sion of Immaculate Conception, which in 1700 had moved from the northern Illinois River down to the Mississippi at the mouth of the Kaskaskia River. Though the disease left him permanently blind, he began Christian instruction with Father Gravier and went on to teach his surviving children the lessons of the Gospel. All were soon baptized.36 Gravier's word choice and his interpreta- tion of Henri's travails all point toward his bias as a European Christian-that is, Gravier believed that God sent a message to Henri in his dream, telling him to renounce his paganism and convert to Christianity. However, Henri's dream does fall within Illinois Christian understanding, for his response to the power of the dream, as an interaction with "mythically defined sources of per- sonal empowerment," mirrors Illinois precontact behavior regarding dreams. Henri believed that his recovery after the dream proved the existence and power of the Christian God, and he shifted his relations accordingly. But he did so through his Illinois understanding of the importance of dreams. But Henri's story reveals more. Henri possibly treated the French mission- aries in a way that other Illinois initially did-as manitous themselves. He dreamed of the missionaries and viewed them as guides and instructors, just as Illinois children dreamed of and viewed manitous during their vision quests. In his Relation of167o -71, Claude Dablon wrote of several Illinois traders whom he met along the Fox River in present-day Winnebago County. The traders asked Dablon and his group to travel south with them to the Illinois country "to preserve them from all mishap on the way." Though Dablon respectfully declined, the Illinois remained satisfied, for when "they took their leave of us," Dablon wrote, " [they were] very proud of having spoken with some spirits, as they said, and of having received tidings from the other world."37 Dablon did AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY / SUMMER 2001/VOL. 25, NO. 3 359</page><page sequence="9">not understand the Illinois cosmology enough to recognize that the Illinois re- lated to manitous in their physical surroundings-a distinction as foreign to Dablon as an earth without manitous was for the Illinois. But he did grasp that the Illinois treated him as a manitou, as an earthly spirit with powers linked to the Christian God.38 But what Dablon omitted from his journal is equally as telling as what he wrote. Dablon purposefully failed to correct the Illinois traders when they called him a "spirit." He cherished the power that missionaries would have if the Illinois continued to think that the French were manitous. Other mission- aries, such as Father Louis Hennepin, a Recollect priest who accompanied the explorer La Salle on his first trip to the Mississippi River, realized this poten- tial as well--and exploited it. When Hennepin arrived at an Indian village on the Illinois River in December of 1679, he wrote that the Kaskaskia elders there insisted that the Mississippi was impossible to navigate. However, he learned later that night from a young Kaskaskia boy that one could easily float down the Mississippi all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. The next day, Hennepin told the elders that God spoke to him during the night and told him of the naviga- bility of the Mississippi. The Kaskaskia leaders were stunned, Hennepin wrote. They admitted the lie, expressed amazement at the power of the French God, promised never to lie again, and pleaded with Hennepin to stay in their village. Hennepin tricked the elders into thinking he had the power to speak with a powerful manitou. For the Illinois, those who could communicate with man- itous in such a way-usually shamans, the most important spiritual people in each village--were often thought to be manitous themselves.39 Hennepin suc- ceeded in making the Illinois believe he had the power of a shaman, giving him a powerful weapon with which to convert the Indians.40 Hennepin's failure to disabuse the Indians of the notion that he was a man- itou raises the question of missionary methods throughout New France. Much like the Recollect missionaries before them and the Sulpician missionaries af- ter them, the Jesuits at first believed that they needed to "civilize" the Indians before "Christianizing" them. The missionaries taught and prayed in estab- lished parishes at French villages throughout the St. Lawrence River Valley and nowhere else. The Jesuits followed this plan until 1640, when they realized- or rationalized--that the less-stationary, more-mobile American Indian soci- eties could still convert to Christianity while maintaining many elements of their precontact culture. No longer would Jesuits teach only within French settlements, as they then traveled to the outskirts of French towns and lived with the Indians themselves, away from the potential vices-the worst being alcohol-that French settlers brought with them. Both the Recollect and the Sulpician missionaries disagreed with this approach and persisted in trying to "civilize" Indians. Both groups failed miserably, while the Jesuits succeeded to 360 Bilodeau: Colonial Christianity and the Illinois Indians</page><page sequence="10">attract more Indians to the Gospel. As the contemporary Jesuit missionary and historian Pierre de Charlevoix noted, An experience ... of more than a century has taught us that the worst system of governing these people and maintaining them in our interest, is to bring them in contact with the French, whom they would have esteemed more, had they seen them less closely. In fine, there was no longer any doubt that the best mode of Christianizing them was to avoid Frenchifying them.41 This reversal in conversion strategy, this acknowledgment of cultural rela- tivism, was the foundation upon which French missionaries related to Indians generally and the Illinois in particular. The Jesuits believed that they could suc- cessfully convey the intricacies of their religious practice and thought to soci- eties like the Illinois, though each group based its religion on fundamentally different ontological assumptions. One of the main methods of teaching the Illinois Christianity--through hymns--highlights the ways in which the Illi- nois translated Jesuit religious pedagogy and ritual through their own worldly mentality.42 After decades of preaching the Gospel from the mouth of the St. Lawrence to the Mississippi River Valley, the missionaries realized the importance of hymns in their quest to indoctrinate and convert American Indians. Throughout the centuries, the Catholic Church used hymns to appeal to masses of illiterate practitioners and teach the liturgy.43 The missionaries among the Illinois did as well. Claude Allouez and Father Louis Andre used hymns extensively at the mission at Bay de Puans at the De Pere rapids on the Fox River. Andre wrote hymn lyrics that both praised Christianity and ridiculed traditional Indian re- ligious concepts and practices, which he then taught to Miami and Mascouten children at his mission. He would walk through the dirt paths and roads of the village playing a flute, and the children would follow him, singing these songs. Allouez used hymns and songs with the Illinois when he arrived in 1677, and subsequent missionaries followed his lead. Jacques Gravier wrote in 1694 that he taught children to sing and chant to "instruct them and keep them occu- pied," and Father Gabriel Marest, who by 1712 had lived with the Illinois for fourteen years, wrote that he taught all the Illinois through hymns, "which they retain more easily because the words are set to airs which they know, and which are pleasing to them."44 Though their affection for hymns mirrored that of Christians throughout the world, the Illinois valued hymns in particular because of the importance of the spoken word in their society. As an oral culture, the Illinois--and other In- dians throughout precolonial and colonial North America-believed in the spirituality of spoken words. They did not recognize the European concept of print, or at least they did not invest print with meaning in the ways Europeans AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 2001/VOL. 25, NO. 3 361</page><page sequence="11">did. But they revered speaking as a sacred act. As James Axtell notes of Indian societies, "Theirs was a predominantly voice-and-ear world in which a word was a real happening, an event of power and personal force." 45 Because words and phrases contained such significance, the Illinois were attracted to the hymns, and many diligently attended services in chapels, for they either found the hymns appealing in their beauty and power, or the hymns mirrored the songs and rituals of their relations with other manitous. Mathurin Le Petit, an Illinois missionary in the early 1700s, wrote in 1730 that hymns drew great crowds to the Church, and inspired a deep devotion.... To listen to them, you would easily perceive that they took more delight and pleasure in chanting these holy Canticles, than the generality of the Savages, and even more than the French receive from chanting their frivolous and often dis- solute songs.46 But the Illinois "took... pleasure in chanting these holy Canticles" in trans- lation, highlighting yet another level of cultural space that they negotiated with their precontact mentality. Much like other American Indians, the Illinois showed little interest in learning the French language, forcing the Jesuits to speak in the Illinois' native tongue.47 They sang the hymns, heard the sermons, and were catechized in the Illinois' Algonquian language. Many important Christian concepts had no equivalents in Illinois, and the Jesuits had to use Illi- nois words that only approximated those concepts. Therefore, when the Illinois learned Christianity through these hymns, they learned ambiguous definitions of Christian concepts in their own language, language infused with their mentality.48 A number of examples will illustrate this point. Chikagou, an Illinois elder, traveled in a celebrated trip to Paris to visit King Louis XV in 1725. After his conversation with the king, Chikagou decided he should try to convince his fellow Illinois to convert to Christianity. He told his people when he returned that "[w]hen I went over to France, the King promised me his protection for the Prayer, and recommended me never to abandon it. I will always remember it." 49 The Illinois, whose language obviously had no word for "Christianity," called it anamehoa, or "prayer." Within the Illinois worldly mentality, the word "prayer" could be construed as the physical act of praying itself, the actual kneeling in supplication. It seems plausible that, through the word anamehoa, the Illinois in some ways emphasized the performative acts of Christianity- as an act of praying, of maintaining proper relations-and de-emphasized the religion's complex system of morality and spiritualism- or at least reconfig- ured that system within their own mentality. In this context, the Illinois "per- formed" the rite of Christianity.50 Other words highlight a similar dynamic. The Illinois used no word for an 362 Bilodeau: Colonial Christianity and the Illinois Indians</page><page sequence="12">overarching god such as the Christian God, so they used the term Manitoua assouv, which literally meant "Great Spirit" but had been previously used to refer to the powerful manitou of the sun. Quite possibly numbers of Illinois re- lated to their new Christian Manitoua assouv with preconceptions of their old Manitoua assouv, such as giving him a human form on earth, as did the Illi- nois Indians who spoke to Allouez in 1666.51 The Illinois language had no word for "cross," so the Illinois called it taouane, meaning "tree" or "wood." The meaning of the word "cross" to a Christian certainly went beyond its material, and the Illinois may have either de-emphasized or discounted this symbolism. Though no records even hint at how the Illinois understood the cross, the fact that they used the word taouane opened the door to a conceptualization of the cross within an Illinois mental framework. Even the most astute and diligent Jesuit missionaries must have had extreme difficulty- or complete faith in cultural relativism-in overcoming what they must have seen as the problem of translation and its potential to lead to a distinctively Illinois view on Chris- tian rites and symbols.52 The French hoped that the Illinois would convert to Christianity wholesale, but realized that they would have to permit the Illinois a large amount of cul- tural agency and autonomy in order for that to happen. That sentiment only reinforced what the Illinois were predisposed to do: to rationalize Christianity within the structures of their mental world, one based on their "worldly" phys- ical surroundings. It thus comes as no surprise when Allouez wrote of the Illi- nois that "[t]hey honor our Lord among themselves in their own way."53 The Illinois also defined their relationships with each other, other Indian tribes, and manitous in part through material exchanges. And, similar to the "worldly" aspects of their mentality, the Illinois relied on material exchanges to define their relationship with the Christian God. Investigating how the Illinois used and viewed material exchanges at the point of European contact will help clar- ify how an Algonquian view of the world subsequently shaped their views of Christianity. The Illinois exchanged more than just material things. One of the more im- portant types of "material" they exchanged was hospitality. Hospitality to strangers, friends, and family could include gifts and food but also affection and deference. Many Indians throughout North America regarded hospitality as important to themselves and their fellow villagers. Indian hospitality "sur- passes all that which is general among the Europeans," wrote Nicholas Perrot, a coureur de bois, trader, and agent of the Canadian government who lived in New France among Indians for over thirty years.54 "Although such generosity may be astonishing," noted Perrot, "it must be admitted that ambition is more the motive for it than is charity." The Illinois AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 2001/VOL. 25, NO. 3 363</page><page sequence="13">and Indians in general acted hospitably because they anticipated comparable material-either hospitality or gifts-in return. Only injury or disgrace from a guest prevented an Illinois from acting hospitably. But when the rare guest did leave without reciprocating the hospitality, the Illinois believed they still re- ceived something in return, for hospitality in Illinois culture-and Indian cul- ture- merited praise as a virtue. Indian hosts drew attention to their virtue by boasting of the luxury and comfort their guests received, though, as Perrot noted, "this is done smilingly and with all possible graciousness." Even when guests left without reciprocating the gifts they received, the material exchange that was so important to the Illinois still took place.55 This Illinois hospitality impressed the French immediately. Allouez mar- veled in 1666 that "it is said that whenever [the Illinois] meet a stranger, they give a cry of joy, caress him, and show him every possible evidence of affec- tion." Dablon noted that the Illinois "showed us such politeness, caresses, and evidences of affection as will scarcely be credited." When Marquette and Jol- liet arrived at the Peoria village in 1673, they were welcomed by the Illinois elders, who led them to their cabins, laid them down on mats, and massaged their legs and feet. After a steam bath, the French ate from the best food the villagers could offer in a cabin the Illinois provided. The Illinois treated all strangers to the village in this same way. Once they provided for their guest's comfort, the Illinois would politely ask the strangers of news from other villages, maintain- ing a strict silence when the guests, or anyone else, spoke. When they knew a guest lied, they ignored it. At the end of a visit, they always gave a gift-in- cluding deer and beaver pelts-for a guest's journey home. In fact, the Illinois granted a guest's any request.56 The Illinois used these material exchanges to define their relationships with other Indians and with the French. But the Illinois also used them to define their relationships with manitous through the practice of sacrifice. Just as they gave material to strangers and allies, they sacrificed material as gifts to mani- tous. The Illinois occasionally sacrificed dogs, usually by hanging them by trees or poles, as Father Jacques Gravier noted with disgust in 1694. The Illinois hung skins from deer and other animals on trees and poles as offerings to the sun or to lakes. But mostly, and most importantly, the Illinois sacrificed tobacco by smoking with the calumet, which, for the Illinois, was itself a manitou.57 The Illinois offered sacrifices, either through the calumet or otherwise, as their share of an exchange. Whenever they smoked the calumet to negotiate with other Indians or the French, the Illinois hoped for some type of benefit: stronger alliances, peaceful settlements of disputes, or profitable trade, for ex- ample. They symbolically reinforced this move toward alliance by passing the calumet from person to person, as "it creates social communion; it joins all into a sacred circle," as Jordan Paper puts it. They also gave calumets as gifts to 364 Bilodeau: Colonial Christianity and the Illinois Indians</page><page sequence="14">strangers and friends on holidays and special occasions. If an Illinois warrior brought out a calumet of peace in the middle of battle, their enemies often stopped fighting. The Illinois used the calumet as the most important instru- ment they had to initiate exchanges with neighboring Indians and the French.58 Perhaps most significant, the Illinois used the calumet and sacrificed other offerings as a link to manitous themselves. They gave gifts believing that the manitou would provide for the village or the individual in return: the power to destroy an enemy in war, a good hunt or harvest, clement weather, and so on. Other sacrifices worked in the same way. The Illinois did not offer skins or dogs as simple gifts to manitous but as their part of an exchange.59 The importance of exchange to the Illinois did not diminish after French missionaries moved into the Illinois country. The Illinois paid homage to the Christian God in order to receive material benefits they believed he would give them, just as they had when they paid homage to their traditional manitous. They did this by sacrificing to the Christian God. However, the Illinois sacri- ficed things to a Christian God that some early modern European Christians found strange or unfamiliar. Marquette noted this practice in his journal in March of 1673, when he stopped with Jolliet at Allouez's mission of St. Frangois Xavier, near the southern tip of Green Bay, for the Mascouten, Miami, and Kickapoo Indians. "When I visited them," Marquette noted of the Miami, I was extremely consoled to see a beautiful cross planted in the midst of the town, adorned with several white skins, red belts, bow and arrows, which these good people had offered to the Great Manitou (such is the name they give to God) to thank him for having had pity on them during the winter, giv- ing them plenty of game when they were in greatest dread of famine. The Illinois sacrificed here to thank the Christian God for helping them sur- vive a potentially difficult time, to show him their continued devotion. They hoped that the next time they found themselves facing hardships, God would again take pity on them and aid their survival. They continued to sacrifice the same things they had sacrificed for their manitous, like skins, belts, and ar- rows- objects that were unconventional by European standards.60 Marquette's journal entry reveals several layers of Illinois religious practice, for the Illinois were also viewing the cross itself as a manitou. As Allouez noted with these same Miami in 1672, when they viewed the chapel as a manitou and "address [ed] their speeches to this house of God, and [spoke] to it as to an an- imate being," the Illinois seemed to manifest a "worldly" view with the cross as well, looking past the Christian symbolism of the cross and seeing it instead as an "other-than-human person." The Illinois here used both the worldly and material aspects of their mentality by believing the cross was a manitou and by sacrificing material in the hope of gaining material from God.61 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 2001/VOL. 25, NO. 3 365</page><page sequence="15">Not only did the Illinois sacrifice to their new God in ways similar to their sacrifices to manitous, but they also hoped to receive in return the same things that they believed their manitous had given them-rewards that at times conflicted with European Christian values. More than twenty-five years after Marquette noted the cross in his journal, Father Julien Binneteau, a Jesuit in the Kaskaskia village at Fort Crevecoeur in 1699, wrote that several Illinois In- dians questioned the worth of a Christian God who did not give them material goods: "'Where is the God,' they say, 'of whom the black gowns tell us? What are the feasts they give us?' " Some Illinois prayed to the Christian God to im- mediately avenge crimes against other Christians. For example, when a young man killed his sister's slave, the sister asked the Lord to kill her brother, instead of pleading for God to forgive him. "'Let [God] make my brother die ... and I will be a good Christian.' " Relations with God were predicated on equal ex- change. This Illinois woman believed that this type of exchange-her brother's death for her loyalty and reverence-was a proper one, for that was a proper material exchange in an Illinois society that placed such importance on reci- procity. Of course, according to a European Christian, a sister praying for her brother's death defies Christian logic. But it does not defy Illinois Christian logic, in which a responsive God answers the pleas of an anguished woman in an immediate and material way.62 Throughout the colonial period, French missionaries recognized that the Illi- nois wanted material goods in exchange for their devotion, and they exploited that notion to gain converts. Jacques Gravier and Julien Binneteau adeptly used trade goods when they taught the Gospel to Illinois children. Gravier, a man who spent roughly twenty-six of his thirty years in New France with the Illinois, would wander through the village of the Kaskaskias and question the children on the catechism, doling out presents for correct answers. The Illinois parents begged Gravier to question their children. "It is true that the hope of getting a red bead ... or a needle, a medal, a cross or a rosary (especially if it be red), a small knife, or other curious objects, given as a reward, incites the children to answer well," wrote Gravier in 1694. Gravier gave a rosary or a cross to the child who answered several days' worth of questions correctly. He req- uisitioned beads especially to give to the Illinois children, as his 1702 list of ne- cessities included "Ten livres of large glass Beads-black, white, and Striped. Ten livres of small glass Beads-white, green and transparent." All were for the Indians. Father Binneteau also used this method, for the gifts "make them try to give correct answers, and they learn a great deal in a short time." It is im- possible to know whether the Illinois parents wanted their children to answer correctly for religious reasons or simply to get a rosary, cross, or bead, which they possibly viewed as manitous. In either case the missionaries understood the importance of exchange to the Illinois, and they targeted children as a way to insinuate Christianity into each house and family.63 366 Bilodeau: Colonial Christianity and the Illinois Indians</page><page sequence="16">At times the Illinois emphasized the material aspect of religious practice so much that they threatened the lives of missionaries. The Illinois rose in anger most frequently over baptism.64 As is well known, many American Indians blamed missionaries for the deaths of recently baptized Indians. At first, the Illinois believed that the ritual of baptism gave the body eternal life, as Allouez wrote of the Miami in his journal of 1672-73.65 When sick Illinois died soon af- ter they were baptized, however, many Illinois began to believe that baptism caused their deaths. When an Illinois child became ill, as often happened, the missionaries insisted on baptizing the child, believing that the soul of a non- baptized child would suffer eternally in hell. The missionaries also insisted on baptizing dying non-Christian adults, just in time, they believed, to save their souls. So, more often than not, missionaries baptized Illinois Indians who then died. It is not surprising, then, that the Illinois connected baptism with death. Many Illinois treated missionaries as if they were evil, and even at times threat- ened to kill them after a baptized Indian died.66 The Illinois reaction to baptism may reflect both the importance of healing in Illinois society and the Illinois emphasis on material exchange. The Illinois privileged the power to heal above almost all others. Central to healing was the shaman, whose power rested in a large part on his ability to successfully use medicine to heal. " [T]he shaman is the person," notes John A. Grim, "who ex- periences, absorbs, and communicates a special mode of sustaining, healing power." This power "evokes the awesome feeling generally associated with the holy," and though often this power was used by shamans for positive purposes, "this power is also feared when experienced in its terrifying aspects," such as when it is used by a witch or sorcerer. "Powers could be used to enhance and promote human welfare or to destroy and seduce," writes Lee Irwin on Plains Indians and witchcraft, "depending largely on the specific nature or type of power bestowed on the individual." Allouez wrote in his 1666 journal that the Illinois sacrificed to the medicine itself, treating it as a manitou, and a shaman who controlled the use of that medicine commanded great respect in a village or community. Shamans who healed large wounds, such as from a gun shot, were deemed manitous themselves. Shamans healed illnesses but also warded off evil spirits by using medicine, magic, ceremonies, and prayers. As the spir- itual leader and healer, the shaman held an important position in an Illinois village and wielded a formidable amount of power.67 The healing ceremony of the shaman may help explain why the Illinois be- lieved that baptism caused death. The French explorer Pierre Deliette, a rela- tive of Henri de Tonti and someone who spent over forty years with the Illinois and other Indian tribes in the Mississippi Valley, described the ceremony of an Illinois shaman when he traveled there in 1687.68 When attending to someone sick, he wrote, the shaman shook a chichicoya, or gourd with a small glass bead inside. After the shaman finished, he stated that his personal manitou told him AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 2001/VOL. 25, NO. 3 367</page><page sequence="17">which evil manitou infected the patient, and he gave the patient a powdered medicine. If the sick person died, then the shaman attributed his or her death to the power of the manitou inside the body. If the patient began to recover, the shaman returned to the home, danced around the patient, and then bit the patient where he said his manitou told him to. He then jumped back from the patient and pulled an eagle's claw, a dog's paw, or some other part of an animal out of his own mouth. The shaman would claim that this animal part was the evil manitou that had caused the illness, and that he had removed it from the patient's body. He then took the patient out for a bath, and upon their return the shaman took his payment from the patient's family, usually trade goods. The payment depended on the nature of the illness.69 It is possible that as the Illinois people watched missionaries-who some believed had the powers of shamans, if not manitous-baptize dying Illinois, they viewed the act as an offering to the powerful Christian Manitoua assouv who would then heal the sick, and maybe even give the sick body everlasting life. The importance of the bath in the healing ceremony of the shaman and the role of water in baptism certainly add to the possibility that the Illinois equated the two ceremonies. Though it is impossible to know exactly how the Illinois understood baptism, it is known how they reacted when a baptized Indian died. Using the notion of material exchange in religious practice, the Illinois reasoned that the ceremony caused the death. "Contrary to the children's jin- gle about sticks and stones," notes James Axtell on oral cultures like the Illi- nois, "words can hurt, even kill, in the form of charms, spells, and hexes." 70 The Illinois could see this powerful ritual being performed upon their children and loved ones, and with their dual understanding of power and healing in both positive and negative terms, many possibly understood that this ritual was an act of witchcraft or malevolence, killing the recipient. Though the mis- sionaries said that a Christian God offered the salvation of the soul, the Illinois did not believe that salvation was worth the death of one of their own. Though the Illinois urged the French to come to their lands, the French pres- ence in the upper Mississippi Valley and the pays d'en haut precipitated an era of demographic and economic decline from which the Illinois could not recu- perate. The French contaminated Illinois villages with devastating diseases, used Illinois warriors to help fight their wars, limited Illinois births by demand- ing monogamy, introduced the Illinois to the scourge of brandy, and forced uncooperative Illinois Indians to leave their settlements. Not surprisingly, the population of the Illinois Confederacy dropped steadily after the French ar- rived, from roughly 9,800 people in 1677 to 2,300 in 1763.71 Depression and desperation permeated Illinois villages. Louis Vivier, a Jesuit missionary with the Kaskaskias from 1749 until his death in 1756, did not exaggerate when he 368 Bilodeau: Colonial Christianity and the Illinois Indians</page><page sequence="18">wrote in 1750 that the only thing missionaries could do for the Illinois was bap- tize their dying children.72 Yet as tragic as the case of the Illinois was, their experience with Christianity does indicate a vitality in their traditional culture that they effectively used to interpret Christianity. Their experience shows the power of Indian culture and agency, even in the face of daunting biological and social odds. Perhaps this is their greatest legacy. By looking at the Illinois experience, one can analyze how other Indians, perhaps ones who survived the ordeal of European contact, in- fused Christianity with their own mentalities and traditions to create new, dis- tinctly Indian types of Christianity.

In this essay, I will rely on the term "mentality" as an analytic device to approach the Illinois. I will use this term, in Robert Darnton's words, "to see things from the na- tive's point of view, to understand what he means, and to seek out the social dimen- sions of meaning."

Though called the "Illinois Confederation," this group had none of the political AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 2001/VOL. 25, NO. 3 371</page><page sequence="21">relationships that existed with the Iroquois; only geography and cultural ties, such as a mutually intelligible language, linked these peoples together.

For population, see table 3 in Zitomersky, French Americans-Native Americans, 201. The French used the term "Illinois" instead of the Algonquian word Ilinioiiek, which, contrary to the belief of many historians and contemporaries of the Illinois, does not mean "man," and may not even be an Illinois word. Its meaning re- mains unknown. The Illinois called themselves inoca, the meaning of which is also un- known. See Zitomersky, French Americans-Native Americans, 679.

Vecsey, in his Traditional Ojibwa Religion, 3-4, outlines the religious understanding and worldview of the Ojibwes. Vecsey proposes a heuristic definition of religion, based upon "con- ceptions of, and relations with, the ultimate source(s) of existence." By "conceptions" Vecsey connotes ideas and beliefs; by "relations" he connotes "the communication, the active affinity, between the subjects and objects of religion, between those persons who hold the conceptions and the embodiments of those conceptions." These terms pro- vide a better description of the relationship between American Indians and their man- itous than "worship," which has clear hierarchical connotations, connotations that did 372 Bilodeau: Colonial Christianity and the Illinois Indians</page><page sequence="22">not exist for many American Indians. For scholarship that has been equally influential to my thoughts in this article, see Morrison, "Montagnais Missionization." 19. Thwaites, Jesuit Relations, 66:233. 20. In the work on the ontology of Algonquian Indians such as the Illinois, schol- ars almost universally defer to the anthropologist A. Irving Hallowell, one of the most penetrating thinkers on American Indian ontology. See Hallowell, "Ojibwa Ontology, Behavior, and World View." Methodologically, I have followed the lead of Christopher Vecsey, who outlines a methodology that combines early accounts such as the Jesuit Re- lations, sources on the nearest Algonquian neighbors, whether religious aspects reflect a group's "concerns, culture, and religious system," and recent testimony and scholar- ship. See Vecsey, Traditional Ojibwa Religion, 7. 21. See Hallowell, "Ojibwa Ontology, Behavior, and World View," 143, 149, 151-52, 157-58, 160, 163. Also see Smith, Island ofAnishnaabeg, 6-7. 22.

Though some narrators of New France, such as Deliette, asserted that the Illinois had no overarching deity, the Illinois did have one principal manitou, the sun. Claude Al- louez and Henri de Tonti both noted that the Illinois worshipped the sun.

Again, another Indian group can be used to corroborate the Illinois case, as the Ojibwes maintained relations with manitous of thunder, or, more specifically, Thunder-Birds. See Smith, Island of the Anishnaabeg, 65-94, and Vecsey, Traditional Ojibwa Religion, 75. 27. What of an Illinois's afterlife? Two versions of an Illinois afterlife exist-one claiming they did have one, the other that they did not. Pierre Deliette, an experienced explorer of the Illinois country, wrote that the Illinois believed that upon death a soul passed over a great river to a land of beautiful women, dancing, fine food, and a warm climate. His view is corroborated by the Jesuit S6bastien Rale and the Recollect Louis Hennepin. This version of a land of the dead is mirrored with other American Indian groups throughout North and South America and is well represented in the literature.

However, the Jesuit missionary Jacques Gravier, a man who lived in the Illinois country for over fifteen years, wrote in his Relation of 1694 that a Kaskaskia family refused to believe that souls existed. "They told me that man died utterly; and that if the soul lived, as I said it did, men would be seen to come back on earth after their death." Gravier's claim is an anomaly not only in the histori- ography but in the Jesuit Relations as well. For Deliette, see Pease, French Foundations, 358. For Rale, see Thwaites, Jesuit Relations, 67:153-59. For Hennepin, see Louis Hen- nepin, Description of Louisiana: Newly Discovered to the Southwest of New France by Order of the King, ed. and trans.

In this analysis, I follow the work of Axtell, Invasion Within, 10-13. Of course, once American Indians became used to the idea of Europeans, this belief about the Eu- ropeans was somewhat tempered, as Indians then began to view missionaries as pow- erful shamans, or persons like themselves. For examples of Indians viewing missionar- ies as shamans, see Trigger, Natives and Newcomers, 246, and his "Early Native North American Responses to European Contact," 1202. 39. The importance of shamans to Illinois villages and spirituality is discussed below. 40.

Peter Dorsey links this type of difficulty in language with a "universal gram- mar," one from which all languages stem, thereby in part enabling Jesuits to rational- ize cultural difference. See Dorsey, "Going to School with Savages: Authorship and Au- thority among the Jesuits of New France," William and Mary Quarterly 60:3 (1998): 409-12. 49. Chikagou's words come in a speech in which he lends Illinois support in war- fare against the Natchez, an Indian group who had recently killed over two hundred Frenchmen in an attack in 1729. His words are from a letter written by Matherin le Pe- tit to D'Avaugour, Procureur des Missions de l'Amerique Septentrionale, 12 July 1730, in Thwaites, Jesuit Relations, 68: 203-5. Also see Thwaites, Jesuit Relations, 67:175. 50. But this performance, Sam Gill notes, has as much spiritual content as the words uttered in the prayer itself. In talking of Navajo prayers specifically, and prayers generally, Gill writes "that while prayer is the communication of an intelligible message describing an expected pragmatic effect, the form in which that message is carried en- gages real processes which serve to achieve the desired results, even to the extent of physical cure." And these processes, I argue, are informed by distinctly Illinois percep- tions of their world.

The mass remained in Latin for the French, but for the Illinois it was in their own language. They sang psalms together, alternating stanzas as well as languages; the French would sing one stanza in Latin, the Illinois would sing the next in their language, and so on. See McWilliams, Fleur de Lys, 139. The Illinois language died before a systematic study of the language could be done. Only words found in both the "Illinois and Miami Vocabulary" and the Jesuit Relations are used here. See Callender's note on the Illinois language in his "Illi- nois," 673. 53.
