<plain_text><page sequence="1">The History of "Hylomorphism" Gideon Manning "Hylomorphism" will be unfamiliar to the casual reader of the history of science and philosophy, but among scholars working in these fields it is now the preferred term when referring to the Aristotelian doctrine of matter and form.1 It is important to acknowledge, however, that although a single term has achieved this preferred status, there is likely no pure or singular doctrine answering to "hylomorphism." This will be apparent when we recall that Aristotle put matter and form to many uses.2 He differentiated the sublunary world from the celestial one by noting that celestial objects I would like to thank Peter Adamson, Roger Ariew, Michael Edwards, Sinikki Elvington, Mordechai Feingold, Daniel Garber, Gary Hatfield, Kristine Haugen, Marita Huebner, Brad Inwood, Melissa Pastrana, Mac Pigman, Robert Richards, Marius Stan, and Joan Steigerwald. I am especially grateful to the Journal's two anonymous referees. 1 "Hylo" is a compounding form of hyle, meaning matter, and morphe means form. Com- pound words of the Greek first declension do not use the genitive of the first word. Sometimes the long alpha or eta is retained; at others, by analogy to the second declen- sion, an omicron is substituted. So either "hylomorphism" or "hylemorphism" would be acceptable Greek. As a result, one frequently finds not "hylomorphism" but "hylemorph- ism," as, for example, throughout The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy, ed. Charles B. Schmitt et al. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-Century Philosophy , 2 vols., ed. Daniel Garber and Michael Ayers (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), and The Cambridge History of Science, Volume 3: Early Modern Science, ed. Katharine Park and Lorraine Daston (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006). In French, too, "Phylomorphisme" and "l'hylemor- phisme" are equally common, although "Phylomorphisme" appears first in the nine- teenth century. 2 What follows above is an abbreviated version of the list of uses compiled in G.

Difficult as it may be to imagine now, even change of place was conceived in this way: the "natural place" sought by a falling body was determined by its form.8 In this paper, I do not wish simply to reject the use of "hylomorphism" because the term, as it is used in contemporary scholarship, purports to represent a single view of matter and form. Idealizations fill a necessary role in simplifying scholarship and there is no reason to persecute them for doing so. Instead, I want to highlight and understand the particular risk attendant to the use of "hylomorphism" as a simplification not only of Aristotle, but also the Peripatetics and those responding to them. For it is especially in contexts where comparisons between historical epochs or self- professed innovators, and the traditional views they reject, that "hylomor- phism" is likely to mislead us. The route I propose to take is a genetic one, as the history of "hylomor- phism" is not at all obvious. Neither the word nor its cognates appear in early modern dictionaries such as Rodolphus Goclenius's Lexicon Philo- sophicum (1613), Charles du Cange's Glossarium mediae et infimae latini- tatis (1678), Jean Nicot's Thresor de la langue française (1606), Jean- 3 All citations of Aristotle will include the Latin title and the Bekker pages, e.g., as De cáelo I.2.269bl8-270b31 in the present case. 4 See, for example, De anima II.1.412al9-28.

Ephraim Chambers's Cyclopaedia (1728) lacks an entry, and the revised 1886 edition fails to remedy the omission. A search of Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language (1755) is similarly unhelpful. Thus, in spite of its now being a staple of historical scholarship, used to distinguish Aristotle and his Peripatetic followers from competing traditions in ancient, medieval, Renaissance, and even early modern science and philosophy, the exact origin of the term "hylomorphism" remains a mystery. By unraveling the history of "hylomorphism," I will explain how the term's origin has handicapped and misled early modernists in particular. I will specifically show that the term "hylomorphism" first appeared in English in 1860, though it was initially used to refer to materialism - the view that the natural world is co-extensive with the material world and material causes. Curiously lacking any connection to Aristotle, the first appearance of "hylomorphism" does not shed any light on the current use of the term. Instead, it was in the context of the Catholic Church's formal revival of Thomism that, in the 1880s, "hylomorphism" began to refer to Peripatetic views, ultimately spreading to historians of science and philoso- phy in the twentieth century with the same Thomistic bias. In what follows, I first detail the history of "hylomorphism" by locat- ing its initial appearance and then identifying the moment when it began to refer, as it does today, to the Peripatetic doctrines of matter and form. After this I address the obstacles the term has created for scholars. I conclude with the suggestion that historical work comparing epochs and specific authors would benefit from using "hylomorphisms" or otherwise acknowl- edging the diversity of views that constitute the Aristotelian tradition. As with many questions of language use, a good place to begin is with James A. H. Murray's A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (1901), which would later become the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). Although Murray's dictionary lacks a dedicated entry for "hylomorphism," 9 All these dictionaries are searchable at http://artfl-project.uchicago.edu/content/diction naires-dautrefois (last visited September 2010). 175</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS ♦ APRIL 2013 it lists "hylomorphism" among the compounds made from "hylo-." It also cites evidence that the word first appeared in the late nineteenth century.10 The current OED preserves the 1901 entry of "hylo-" and, like its progeni- tor, credits the British theologian James Martineau's A Study of Religion (1888) with bringing "hylomorphism" into the English language. It also offers the following definition: "the doctrine that primordial matter is the First Cause of the universe." Though informative, there are two deficiencies in the OED account that ought to be corrected. First is the definition of "hylormorphism." A New English Dictionary and the OED emphasize hyle but fail to account for morphe. Martineau's A Study of Religion goes some way to explain this emphasis. Contrasting " Anthropomorphism , B/omorphism, and Hylomor- phism," Martineau attempted to "mark the differentia of . . . three theo- ries" about the "universal cause of Nature."11 He believed there "are but three forms under which it is possible to think of the ultimate or immanent principle of the Universe - Mind, Life, [and] Matter." According to Marti- neau's view, then, "anthropomorphism" refers to any theory of the universe as coming from thought, while "biomorphism" refers to any theory that emphasizes animistic growth as a cause. "Hylomorphism," by contrast, appeals only to matter, which "mechanically shuffles into equilibrium." Martineau's use of "hylomorphism" clearly emphasizes hyle , and Murray and the OED simply follow his lead. But by sidelining morphe , their defi- nition deprives hylomorphism of what is frequently thought to be its main advantage: that it is neither a species of Cartesian style substance dualism nor a straightforward materialism of the atomist variety. Regardless, the suggestion that matter alone is the first cause of the universe, without any role for form, will appear to the modern reader profoundly un-hylo mor- phic; so too will Martineau's claim that hylomorphism involves a mechani- cal shuffling. We obviously must look more carefully for the moment at which "hylomorphism" came to refer to the Peripatetic's commitment to matter and form. The second deficiency in the accounts in A New English Dictionary 10J.A.H. Murray, An English Dictionary on Historical Principles (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1901), 5: 494-95.

Rather, the term appears to have been coined in a translation done by Fred- erica Rowan of a curious letter, written in German in 1818 by Friedrich Schleiermacher to Friedrich Jacobi, though an oversight in the 1858 and 1860 editions of Schleiermacher's correspondence had the unfortunate con- sequence of leaving the precise meaning of the word underdetermined. The theological content of Schleiermacher's letter need not concern us here, but the circumstances of its publication are worth describing in detail for the light they shed on the history of the first appearance of "hylomorphism" in English. Schleiermacher's letter to Jacobi was first published in 1837, in the short-lived journal Der Kirchenfreund für das nördliche Deutschland.12 (Precise numbers on the circulation of Der Kirchenfreund für das nördliche Deutschland have proven difficult to find, although worldwide, for all years of its publication run, only seven universities currently own copies of the journal, suggesting that the 1837 reprint of the letter was not widely read.) The letter was republished in the 1858 edition of Schleiermacher's corre- spondence, which made it available to a broader readership. In 1858 the relevant passage reads as follows: Der Anthropomorphismus, oder lassen Sie mich sagen, der Ideom- orphismus, ist aber unvermeidlich auf dem Gebiete der Dolmet- schung des religioesen Gefuehls; ob der Hylomorphismus nicht eben so unentbehrlich ist auf der Seite der Naturkunde, will ich nicht entscheiden, weil ich zu wenig davon verstehe.13 Frederica Rowan's translation of this passage is given in the text below, but it is essential to see the German to understand the history of "Hylomorphis- mus." For what is most remarkable about the passage is that the 1858 edition of Schleiermacher's correspondence, as well as the 1860 reprint, omit a par- enthetical remark that Schleiermacher made to clarify his interest in "Hylo- morphismus." This omission is particularly glaring given that the earlier 1837 version had included Schleiermacher's parenthetical explanation: Der Anthropomorphismus, oder lassen Sie mich lieber sagen Ideomorphismus, ist aber unvermeidlich auf dem Gebiete der Dol- 12 For a full account of the provenance of the 1818 letter, including its publication history, see Martin Cordes, "Der Brief Schleiermachers an Jacobi: Ein Beitrag zu seiner Entsteh- ung und Überlieferung" in Zeitschrift für Theologie und Kirche 68 (1971): 195-212. 13 F.

Schleiermacher's reference to the "lebendigste Physik," literally the "most living physics," though one might translate it more idiomatically as the "most organic" or "most animated physics," qualifies what he meant by "Hylomorphismus." Unfortunately, his qualification would have been lost on readers of the 1858 and 1860 editions of Schleiermacher's correspon- dence. As a result, the "lebendigste Physik" played no part in the reception of Schleiermacher's "Hylomorphismus." Nevertheless, it is worth pausing to consider precisely what Schleier- macher means by the "most living physics." What can be discerned from the letter, at least initially, is that by "Ideomorphism" Schleiermacher seems to mean "the form of ideas"; so when he questions whether "Hylomorphis- mus" is needed in natural science he likely is asking about "the form of matter." But this is not the form implicated in the matter-form thinking of Aristotle. Rather, it is the form or structure assigned to atoms in an atomis- tic physics. In his parenthetical remark, Schleiermacher is contrasting the atomistic physics, which he rejects, with the "most living physics" to which he subscribes. And he is specifically acknowledging to Jacobi his uncer- tainty as to whether "the form of matter" so essential to an atomistic phys- ics, with its lifeless matter, is essential to the "most living physics." As for what the "most living physics" refers to, it is well documented that Schleiermacher's natural scientific views were informed by the work of Friedrich Schelling.15 In all likelihood the "most living physics" is a refer- 14 The 1837 letter is reproduced in Cordes, "Der Brief Schleiermachers an Jacobi"; emphasis added.

Schelling, however, does not refer to the "lebendigste Physik" in either his 1799 Erster Entwurf eines Systems der Naturphilosophie or his 1800 System des transcendentalen Idealismus . But these works do express an anti-Newtonian and, more tellingly, anti- atomistic understanding of nature: the same view of nature endorsed by Schleiermacher in his letter to Jacobi. Thus, even upon closer inspection of the complete 1818 version of the letter cited above, "Hylomorphismus" is not a reference to the Peripatetic doctrines of matter and form; and given that the 1858 version of the letter omits the reference to the "lebendigste Physik," there is no basis on which to interpret Schleiermacher's "Hylo- morphismus" as referring to Peripatetic doctrines. This is noteworthy because, as I mentioned earlier, the first appearance of "hylomorphism" is tied to Schleiermacher's 1818 letter, albeit the 1858 version. Frederica Rowan's The Life of Schleiermacher (1860), refers to the former, but treats the 1858 text cited above as authoritative. Rowan's entirely adequate translation of the German reads: Anthropomorphism, or let me rather say ideomorphism, is, how- ever, unavoidable in regard to the interpretation of the religious feeling: whether hylomorphism is not equally indispensable in regard to natural science, I cannot undertake to determine, be- cause I am not sufficiently acquainted with the subject.17 This passage along with the rest of the 1818 letter was thought important enough by a reviewer for The Westminster Review that Rowan's translation of the letter was reproduced almost in its entirety.18 Rowan's translation predated Martineau's work by nearly three decades, but because Rowan relied on the 1858 version of Schleiermacher's letter her translation suffers 16 For a brief but illuminating discussion of Schelling's philosophy, see R.-P.

Consequently, in spite of all the sources dis- cussed so far, we still do not know when "hylomporphism" came to refer to the Peripatetic's account of matter and form. The answer can be found two decades later as part of the Catholic Church's conservative response to events in the late nineteenth century. Begun by Pope Pius IX with his Syllabus Errorum (1864), the Church's response to the errors of the modern age continued with growing urgency as it became clear that the Pope and Papal State were on the losing end of a battle with secular political powers, especially in Italy. Modern science was also viewed as a threat by the Church during this period. In 1878 Pius IX's successor, Pope Leo XIII, issued his encyclical Aeterni Patris , declaring in paragraph thirty that it was the "grossest injustice" to claim that "our philosophy . . . opposed the advance and development of natural science."20 Meant to insulate the Church from any accusations that science and reli- gion were incompatible, the Aeterni Patris even more clearly directed all Catholics henceforth to follow the doctrines of Thomas Aquinas. "Our first and most cherished idea," concludes paragraph twenty-six of the Aeterni Patris , "is that you should all furnish to studious youth a generous and copious supply of those purest streams of wisdom flowing inexhaustibly from the precious fountainhead of the Angelic Doctor [Thomas Aquinas]." Thus, an important challenge facing the Church's defenders was to show that Thomism and modern science were compatible. Finally, we come to one such defender, the prominent nineteenth- century German Jesuit Tilmann Pesch.21 It was Pesch who, in 1877, first 19 The same is true of François Bonifas's La doctrine de la rédemption dans Schleier- macher : "L'anthropomorphisme - que j'appellerais plus volontiers idéomorphisme, - est inévitable, je le reconnais, lorsqu'il s'agit de traduire en langage humain le sentiment religieux; je ne déciderai pas la question de savoir si V hylomorphisme est aussi inévitable sur le terrain des sciences naturelles" (F.

Instead, it is from Pesch's 1880 Institutiones Philosophiae Naturalis - the first volume in a series titled Philosophia Lacensis taking up the cause of Thomism and published by the Jesuits of Maria-Laach - that "hylomorphism," as we still use it today, derives.23 So influential was Pesch's work that Joseph Louis Perrier would later describe it as part of "the most important contribution of Ger- many to Scholastic philosophy since the days of Kleutgen and Stökl," both of whom were among the earliest founders of Neo-Scholasticism.24 In part four of Pesch's Institutiones he expressed his misgivings about both empiricism - with its overreliance on the material world - and the claims of modern science, especially when they were at odds with orthodox Church doctrine. Where the achievements of modern science were undeni- able, however, Pesch proceeded to assimilate science into what he called Thomas's " systema hylomorphicum He summarized his position with the following four claims: 1) the basic commitments of the systema hylomor- phicum are "absolutely certain"; 2) its "immediate consequences" are equally certain for "philosophical reasons"; 3) it is the best hypothesis for explaining "chemical change"; and 4) we can and should substitute the "observations" of modern scientists for those "inexact conjectures" offered by medieval doctors.25 Although Pesch did not actually use "hylomorphism" in the Institu- tiones - he wrote in Latin and used the adjective "hylomorphic" - reviewers of his book made use of "hylomorphism" when discussing the systema hylomorphicum .

But there is one point we wish to bring into due prominence - viz., his comments on the several systems for dealing with . . . corporeal substances . . . [where he] establishes the hylomorphical [sic] system held by St. Thomas.27 Additional reviews of Pesch's Institutiones appeared after a slightly modi- fied second edition was published in 1897. The Month: A Catholic Maga- zine summarized the work as follows: "It differs in no point of doctrine from the first edition. . . . [Volume one] contains theses dealing with the false systems of dynamists and others respecting the constitution of bodies and establishing the scholastic doctrine of hylomorphism."28 By 1897 "hylomorphism" was being used without qualification or explanation, referring simply to "the scholastic doctrine." There is additional evidence that "hylomorphism" came into wide use in the years between the two editions of Pesch's work and that orthodox Catholic doctrine in particular embraced the Thomistic provenance of "hylomorphism" between 1880 and 1897. Notable here is Thomas Quen- tin Fleming's Thomist-inclined Hylomorphism of Thought-Being from 1888. This was the first book to use "hylomorphism" or any of its cognates in a title, something that did not go unnoticed. The reviewer for The Dublin Review noted of Fleming's work, "Many, no doubt, on hearing the title of this book will wonder what 'hylomorphism' means but those who have studied Scholastic theory of 'matter and form' will understand that 'hylo- morphism' denotes the formation of a compound from two principles, one active, the other passive."29 Judging from this review, the "Scholastic theory of 'matter and form,' " which had been well known since the Middle Ages, was considered common knowledge in 1888, but the label "hylomorph- ism" was still novel. In 1897, however, the same year the review of Pesch's 26 T. Davidson, "Review of Institutiones Philosopbiae Naturalis secundum principia S.

A final testament to Pesch's success in influencing discussions of matter and form can be glimpsed in the highly successful Traité élémentaire de philosophie written by Cardinal Mercier and the Professors of the Higher Institute at Louvain. Originally composed in 1906 and translated into four "of the European languages" within a decade, the 1916 English translation declares that "all the great thinkers of antiquity and the Middle Ages believed material substance to be a com- pound of two substantial principles, primary matter and substantial form - a theory now often called hylomorphism ."30 By the end of the nineteenth century "hylomorphism" and its cognates had become an established part of the Neo-scholastic vocabulary when referring to Peripatetic doctrines of matter and form. We now know when "hylomorphism" first appeared in English - 1860 - and we know it began to refer to the Peripatetic doctrines of matter and form in the 1880s. Thus, in spite of its ubiquitous use among historians of science and philosophy today, we also know that neither the word "hylo- morphism" nor the compound from which it derives was used by Aristotle, the ancient or medieval commentators, or early modern natural philoso- phers. This is worth remembering, for the use of "hylomorphism" implies the existence of a single doctrine spanning these many figures and time periods - this is made explicit in the passage quoted from the translation of the Traité élémentaire de philosophie . But also recall that the word was coined to refer to "the scholastic doctrine" associated with Thomism and was meant as an alternative, really the alternative, to secular and scientific trends in the nineteenth century. These trends and the pressures felt in the Catholic Church left little room to acknowledge that there may not be a singular doctrine shared by Aristotle, Aquinas, and other scientists and phi- losophers. Yet to insist upon a singular doctrine of matter and form is to ignore the diversity of views held by the Peripatetics and the layers upon layers of commentary that created the Aristotelian tradition beginning in the third 30 Cardinal Mercier et al., A Manual of Modern Scholastic Philosophy , trans.

Consider just the early disagreements over whether "prime matter" - matter wholly devoid of form - was necessary to explain substantial change. Many of the commentators argued that in the generation of a new substance there must exist some matter that stands ready to receive a form. To deny the existence of such matter was to compromise Aristotle's analysis of change, or so claimed prime matter's defenders.32 The fact th; t Aristotle never explicitly or consistently endorsed the existence of prime matter effec- tively guaranteed that disputes over its existence could not be settled. The early commentators also disagreed about the separate existence of some "substantial forms" - forms without matter - that would be eternal and unchanging; in a sense, the antithesis of prime matter. These disputes inter- ested not only Alexander, an early proponent of prime matter, but later commentators as well, including Porphyry, Simplicius, and Philoponus. And the same debates returned with vigor in the High Middle Ages. For, whereas the Thomists referred to prime matter but rejected its possible exis- tence, the Scotists sided with Alexander and maintained that prime matter can and must exist separate from form. The differences within Aristotelian scholasticism were so apparent beyond just disputes about hylomorphism that during the sixteenth century the University of Padua established sepa- rate Thomist and Scotist chairs in metaphysics and theology, effectively endorsing the view that there were no fewer than two legitimate versions of Aristotle.33 This alone urges caution when using the term "hylomorphism." More troubling, however, "hylomorphism" has also served to hide the deep agreements that existed between Peripatetics and their supposed execution- ers, the seventeenth century's novatores. To be sure, the rhetoric of the seventeenth century was firmly against the "philosophy of the schools," as Aristotelian scholasticism was frequently identified. But rhetoric is not 31 For the early reception of Aristotle, see the contributions in Aristotle Transformed: The Ancient Greek Commentators and Their Influence, ed.

The misstep is to allow this rhetoric, cou- pled with the late nineteenth-century use of "hylomorphism" noted above, to lull us into believing in a singular doctrine unifying all of the Peripatetic tradition that is capable of being unilaterally rejected. In other words, when contemporary scholars find the likes of Descartes, Hobbes, or Boyle reject- ing the school philosophy, it is all too easy to interpret them as rejecting hylomorphism and therefore all matter-form thinking. But this is simply not what occurred. More accurately, these early mod- ern figures were rejecting specific incarnations of matter-form thinking, such as the common (but not ever-present) Aristotelian scholastic belief that forms were "substantial" and capable of existing without matter. Or, they were rejecting the Scotist belief that there existed a "prime matter" that was a formless and undifferentiated precondition for change. These specific features of matter-form thinking were ridiculed and abandoned by the novatores , who took little interest in disputes taking place within the Peripatetic tradition even while taking one side against the other. But matter-form thinking persisted, and this is the point likely to be obscured by unqualified use of "hylomorphism." Descartes assimilated forms to con- figurations of matter and claimed that the human mind was the substantial form of the body.34 Hobbes chose to title his most important work " Levia- than; or The matter , forme, &amp; power of a commen-wealth eccesiasticall and civil " and Boyle, for all his objections and qualifications, acknowl- edged that he would "retain the word Forme."35 While the persistence of matter-form thinking in the work of the nova- tores has been noticed by other scholars, as has the diversity of scholastic accounts of matter and form, more often the presumption that "hylomor- phism" equals Peripatetic and that Peripatetic equals what the novatores rejected has led historians of science and philosophy to misrepresent the role of matter-form thinking in the seventeenth century and beyond.36 There are occasions when the historian's interest does not lie in exactness, as one anonymous reviewer pointed out to me. But exactness is required 34 "Omnem materiae variationem, sive omnem eius formarum diversitatem pendere à motu" (René Descartes, Oeuvres de Descartes [Paris: Librairie Philosophique J. Vrin, 1996], 8: 52).

Michael Hunter and Edward B. Davis (Lon- don: Pickering and Chatto, 1999), 5: 324. 36 Without discussing the history of "hylomorphism," this conclusion is also reached in Christoph Ltithy and William R. Newman, " 'Matter' And 'Form': By Way Of A Preface" Early Science and Medicine 2 (1997): 215-26. 185</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS ♦ APRIL 2013 when we seek to understand purported shifts away from central doctrines that critics allege define a movement, as matter-form thinking was taken to define the essence of Aristotelianism by the early modern novatores. Des- cartes could write that the diversity of opinion within the schools did not trouble him "because one can easily overturn all of the foundations on which they are in agreement," but it is a mistake to take Descartes's word for it.37 Describing Descartes as "[Rejecting the hylomorphism of the schools," the mechanical philosophy that characterized early modern sci- ence as having "rejected any ideas of hylomorphism in physical explana- tions" or early modern atomism as having "undermined the hylemorphic foundation of peripatetic physics and consequently all the doctrines con- structed upon it," without specifying which version of hylomorphism was being rejected, or that substantial form and not form per se was in dispute, reinforces the misrepresentation engendered by "hylomorphism" during the last years of the nineteenth century: that there exists a singular and unified Peripatetic doctrine of matter and form.38 There is one remaining question to consider in light of these results: should the history of "hylomorphism," and its misleading implications, require us to discontinue using the term? A similar question was once asked about "Aristotelianism" by Charles B. Schmitt in the course of his pointing out that "Aristotelianisms" would be a more appropriate term to convey the diversity that lurks behind "Aristotelianism." I would suggest some- thing similar here. "Hylomorphisms" is a more appropriate term for us to use than "hylomorphism."39 Aside from emphasizing the plurality of matter-form thinking we have already encountered, if we use "hylomorph- isms," I believe we will be encouraged to ask questions that do not frequently enough occur in our scholarship. For example, if there are hylomorphisms, which of them were rejected, and when? Which were 37 "[C]ar on peut aisement renuerser tous les fondemens desquels ils sont d'accord entr'eux" (Descartes, Oeuvres , 3: 232). 38 These quotations come, respectively, from J. A.
