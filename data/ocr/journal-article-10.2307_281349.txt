Troublesome superposition of glyph elements could suggest renewal, perhaps revivification, ofglyphs that have had their reddish color obscured by soot. Tools for manipulating supernaturally charged media are also important; I would consider the fragment of cedar in this regard. Muller concludes his chapter by noting that "Mud Glyph Cave may give a glimpse into beliefs of its time, but only as a result of very careful internal and com- parative study" (p. 80). I eagerly take this and his sev- eral other indications of studies not yet done as a prom- ise that he will do them. Anyone inspired to work independently with the site data will need to travel to Knoxville or Carbondale, since this volume is limited in both explication and description. There is no listing of glyphs, motifs, and provenience. The map of the glyph gallery is scaled to about 1:580 to fit page size, and does not show glyph locations except for 12 illustrated in plates. There are no line drawings. The 26 photographs are small (largest is 8 x 12.5 cm), and the scale is cropped out on four of them. There is no knowing how many glyphs are not represented or how glyphs relate one to another. Rock art only recently has begun to gain respectabil- ity. My hope is that Muller's continuing analysis and interpretation of the similar art of Mud Glyph Cave may stimulate yet more acceptance of stationary art as a proper subject for serious scholarship. The dust jacket proposes that the volume "will be prized by scientists, cavers, and armchair archaeologists alike." I suggest that scientists may need to wait a bit longer for their prize, but it could be a very well-rewarded wait. Ancient Texans: Rock Art and Lifeways along the Lovw- er Pecos. HARRY J. SHAFER, with photographs by JIM ZINTGRAFF. Texas Monthly Press, Austin, 1986. xiv + 247 pp., appendix, biblio., index. $35.00 (cloth). Reviewed by Karen Nissen, Basin Research Associates. At a time when many archaeological reports are writ- ten in jargon that is difficult for archaeologists to de- cipher, it is welcome to see a publication written in language for the general public. The publication of An- cient Texans is aimed at unraveling the lifeways of the Indians of the Lower Pecos River, and it is intended to complement an exhibition covering the 9,000 years of culture history on display at the Witte Museum in San Antonio. While other archaeologists have pre- sented more detailed examinations of individual sites discussed in this book, Shafer has synthesized these data to present a readable overview of the archaeology and rock art in the Lower Pecos region. Shafer introduces the reader to the prehistory with a fictional account of one band living in the region 1,740 years ago. This novel ethnography encapsulates a small segment of the seasonal round of a band. Hav- ing recently read some of Jean Auel's novels, I was expecting the worst when I was introduced to Moon, Lizard, Owl, and other band members. However, Shaf- er has written a good account of how one small band functioned, describing the resources, artifacts, and be- liefs in a manner that leads the reader to an under- standing of how life might have been. Adding to this reconstruction are illustrations by George Strickland. The second chapter covers the environmental back- ground, discussing how geologic forces and climate gradually transformed the region to its present state and formed the rock-shelters and caves in which the inhabitants lived and left their rock art. Shafer notes the importance that geology, paleontology, palynology, botany, etc. play in providing information on the evolving landscape. Minor reversals to a warming trend are present ca. 2500 B.P. and 650 B.P. when cooler and moister conditions prevailed, and this led to short periods when bison moved to the region and were ex- ploited by hunters. Shafer notes that the most dramatic changes have occurred within the past century when domestic animals were introduced, range fires sup- pressed, and dams and waterworks were constructed resulting in overexploitation of the environment. Vaughn Bryant wrote sections on palynology and cop- rolite analysis, describing how these studies can con- tribute to our understanding of environment, diet, uses of artifacts, etc. Shafer continues with a discussion of the cultural sequence in the Lower Pecos. Following a brief intro- duction discussing the peopling of the New World, there is a detailed description of the cultural sequence ranging from Folsom points associated with a bison drive at Bonfire Shelter to the historic period. More than 800 bison remains recovered from Bonfire Shelter during the Devil's Interval (3000-1000 B.P.) point to a cooler moister period ca. 2500 B.P. The Pecos River Style of pictographs represented by large anthropo- morphic figures holding atlatls is correlated with this period and may be older. During the Comstock Inter- val (1000-400 B.P.), small projectile points mark the introduction of the bow and arrow, and some new site types suggest movement of populations into the region. Two new pictograph styles, the Red Monochrome and Red Linear, appear at this time; notable in the Red Monochrome Style are figures holding bows and ar- rows. During the Historic Interval (400-150 B.P.), a number of groups are known to have used the area, and depictions of churches, priests, horses, etc. are rep- resented in the rock art. Discussions and descriptions of Baker Cave by Thomas Hester and Bonfire Shelter by Solveig Turpin follow. These brief articles provide additional data on techniques used in excavating cave deposits, the cul- tural sequence, etc. Turpin also wrote a section on small hearth sites located along canyon rims and on isolated hilltops. These are interpreted as sites for sig- nal fires, and they are thought to date to the Late Pre- historic or Protohistoric periods. Shafer continues with a description of the material culture and lifestyles of the inhabitants of the region. He notes how the diversity of resources and the sea- sonal round archaeologically are reflected in sites such as burned-rock middens, rockshelters, etc. A nice chart shows the sequence of projectile points, pictographs, painted pebbles, and sandals in the region. An in-depth discussion by Shafer of the pictographs, painted and engraved pebbles, and clay and fiber fig- urines follows. The earliest pictograph style, the Pecos 206 [Vol. 54, No. 1, 1989]</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES River Style, was divided into four periods by W. W. Newcomb based upon superimposition. This style is characterized best by large anthropomorphic figures, often referred to as shamans, who hold atlatls, pouches, throwing sticks, etc. While it is noted that there are no similar figures in the rock art of nearby areas, some of these figures bear resemblance to those from Barrier Canyon, Utah, as noted by Schaafsma (The Rock Art of Utah, 1971). The later Red Monochrome Style is marked by human figures carrying bows and arrows. Human figures in this style appear more realistic and less surrealistic than those of the Pecos River Style. The Red Linear Style, of limited distribution, consists of small paintings of humans and animals. Historic- period pictographs portray horses, churches, etc. Ex- cellent color and black and white photographs by Jim Zintgraff in this chapter and others enhance the book, however, it would be helpful to have a scale in the photos. Painted and engraved pebbles are also part of the art of the Lower Pecos. These occur in deposits that date ca. 8500 to 550 B.P. Analyses of these pebbles by Mark Parsons showed that all shared three basic elements and could be grouped into six styles. Early styles 1-4 seem to be quite geometric, but in styles 5 and 6 the pebble designs appear to represent human faces. Detailed discussions of rock art by other contributors follow. Terence Grieder discusses methods for record- ing, dating, and interpreting pictographs. Solveig Tur- pin adds more data on the Red Monochrome and later styles of pictographs. To attempt to understand how the art might have functioned in the Lower Pecos, Shafer includes a de- scription of Bushman art in southern Africa and the rock art of Australian Aborigines. More detailed dis- cussion of Bushman paintings is presented by Megan Biesele, who notes the recent interpretations of the paintings by Lewis-Williams as depictions of trance states and soul transformations. A good discussion of Australian rock art by Richard Gould shows how the paintings reflect Aboriginal culture. This art contrasts with that of the Lower Pecos, which Gould sees as more variable and expressive than that of Australia. He sug- gests the Lower Pecos was a more affluent environment that allowed more individual variation in the art. A good discussion of shamanism by Peter Furst pro- vides information on the role of hallucinogens and ecstatic trances in religion. He notes the possibility that some of the paintings may represent images seen by people who had ingested mescal beans, Sophora se- cundiflora. Furst's description of the shamanic ecstatic experience is similar to the trance state described by Lewis-Williams for Bushman paintings. The book concludes with a note on the destruction of archaeological sites and a short history of archaeo- logical work in the Lower Pecos. All in all, it is an excellent introduction to the archaeology of the Lower Pecos River. While more detailed discussions of the rock art are present in The Rock Art of the Texas In- dians (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967) and in site re- ports, Ancient Texans provides a very readable syn- thesis of the archaeology which can be enjoyed by both the general public and professional archaeologists. Jumano and Patarabueye Relations at La Junta de los Rios. J. CHARLES KELLEY, with forward by JOHN D. SPETH. Anthropological Papers No. 77. Mu- seum of Anthropology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1986. xvii + 180 pp., illustrations, plates, biblio. $10.00 (paper). Reviewed by Harry J. Shafer, Texas A&amp;M University. The area west of the Pecos River in Trans-Pecos Texas and adjacent portions of Coahuila and Chihua- hua, Mexico, constitutes one of the least known ar- chaeological regions in North America. Few major ar- chaeological studies have been carried out in the southern Trans-Pecos area despite the visibility and preservation of archaeological materials, conditions which usually attract researchers. Most of the work was carried out over 45 years ago. One was a pioneering effort in geoarchaeology that examined the association of archaeological materials with geological deposits and provided an important step forward in developing a chronology for the region (Kelley et al., TheAssociation of Archaeological Materials with Geological Deposits in the Big Bend Region of Texas, 1940). Another was the research in the La Junta district by J. Charles Kelley which is the subject of this volume. The monograph is Kelley's dissertation submitted at Harvard in 1947 and published essentially without revision, and despite the outdated archaeological interpretations, it repre- sents one of the most important archaeological studies of Trans-Pecos Texas. Archaeologically, the La Junta district is part of a broad, arid intermontane area that stretches from cen- tral Texas to Oaxaca. Characterizing the earlier ar- chaeological assemblages are those of an Archaic ad- aptation that spanned some 9,000 years of prehistory in northern Mexico and southwest Texas (Shafer, An- cient Texans: Art and Lifeway Along the Lower Pecos, 1986). This Archaic adaptation gave rise to complex civilizations in Mesoamerica, but the northern frontier remained little changed throughout the long cultural sequence. Some of these groups in the La Junta district became marginal agriculturists sometime after the be- ginning of the Christian era (Griffen, Culture Change and Shifting Populations in Central Northern Mexico, 1969); the hunting and gathering life style of other groups essentially remained unchanged. The degree to which the La Junta groups took to agriculture is a mat- ter of debate, but they can certainly be described as marginal southwestern farmers when Espejo first en- countered them in 1582; Cabeza de Vaca may have visited them as early as 1535. La Junta lies in narrow, deeply entrenched valleys of the Rio Grande and Rio Conchos surrounded by arid hills and mountains of the Chihuahuan desert, and some 300 miles southwest of the bison herds of the southern High Plains. La Junta archaeology involves a study of Chihuahuan desert Archaic adaptation, mar- ginal agriculture along the rivers, and bison hunting. Kelley addresses all three issues, which is one reason why this work is so important. Furthermore, some of the archaeological sites recorded and studied by Kelley are no longer available for archaeological research. 207</page></plain_text>
