It is always a pleasure to thank them, as well as the various scholars who have con- tributed excavation reports and photographs. ATHENS AND ATTICA Agora. In 1968 the excavations were conducted by Professor T. Leslie Shear, Jr., who has succeeded Professor Homer A. Thompson as Field Director. Work was concentrated around the sw corner of the Agora where some of the principal ancient streets entered. Beneath the w end of the Middle Stoa (AJA 72 [1968] 266), the exploration of strati- fied deposits uncovered a significant section of the classical road which led into the center of the Agora from the Pnyx and the western slopes of the Areo- pagos. The street was in use from archaic times until the Middle Stoa was built over it in the second century B.C. At a point where the street opened into the square a large rectangular monument, built around 430 B.c., was investigated. Its size (9.80 x 2.25 m.) and prominent location suggest a building of some importance. Evidence from the stratified fill be- side the monument shows that it had been sys- tematically demolished in the mid-fourth century B.c. At this time the Peribolos of the Eponymous Heroes was constructed opposite the Metroon, and there is evidence to suggest that the rectangular building is the earlier monument of the Epony- mous Heroes, known from literary and historical testimonia to have existed as early as 424 B.c. Of particular interest is the discovery, among the small buildings just beyond the sw corner of the Agora, of a structure used as a sculptor's studio and marble worker's atelier for more than 150 years. The fill over which the earliest floor of the build- ing was laid contained debris typical of the Persian destruction of Athens in 480. The house was finally destroyed at the very end of the fourth century B.C. On the earliest floor was found a polished bone tool bearing the name of the first owner of the house, the sculptor Mikion, while the last owner has also left his name, Menon, scratched on sev- eral of the drinking cups found in a cistern. A large and important group of terracotta figurines, many from the same mold, were also recovered from a cistern in the courtyard. On the Nw slopes of the Areopagos a definitive architectural investigation was made of the large complex of late Roman baths, the earliest of which was a circular bath of the second century B.c. This was renovated in the first century B.c. and then replaced by a larger bath, the main rooms of which had floors of pebble mosaic. This was in turn re- placed by a large vaulted building of the Hadrianic period, including several large halls with hypo- causts and furnaces for central heating. There are also remains of pools for hot and cold water, dress- ing rooms and a latrine. The building was badly damaged by the Herulii in A.D. 267, but in the fourth century it was extensively remodeled, and used as a bath until late in the sixth century. Lower City. Demolition of an old house at No. 78 Hadrian st. in July 1968 led to the discovery of remains of a large and splendid Roman building (plan, ill. i). The excavation was directed by the Ephor of the Acropolis, George S. Dontas. Part of the N outer wall (orientation E-w, and running roughly parallel to Hadrian st.) was uncovered (pl. 85, fig. i) and s of this a row of three pillars, cross-shaped in plan. The wall is constructed of big blocks of Peiraeus poros, and is preserved at its E end to a height of four courses. The Nw cor- ner of the building was found in 1956 (Hadrian st. No. 72) and an adjoining stretch of the N wall in 1961 (Hadrian st. No. 74). In 1967 another part of the N wall and part of a large entrance hall (see plan) were uncovered to the E of the present finds (Hadrian st. No. 84 and Mnesikles st.). Blocks of the entrance hall are visible in the basement of a house on the E corner of these streets. The building is reconstructed by Mr. Dontas as a basilica in form. Below it are remains of large Hellenistic and early Roman buildings. Superimposed layers of roads of packed earth</page><page sequence="2">342 MIRIAM ERVIN [AJA 73 e, ~ , , '"" . ,oo M . .. " Io' P.Ao 0 0 o0 0 4 o o ,o " r 0= ILL. I. Roman building in Hadrian st. ran along the outer N face of this building, and it is evident that modern Hadrian st. follows roughly the course of an ancient road. Pausanias (1.18.9), in connection with his de- scription of the sanctuary of Zeus Olympeios at Athens, mentions a OEoZS -o^t Trao-v LEpOV KoWvOV among the buildings made by Hadrian for the Athenians. The resemblance in construction of the building to that of the Library of Hadrian and the peribolos wall of the Olympieion, as well as its obvious importance in size and position, make plausible its identification as the Pantheon of Ha- drian mentioned by Pausanias (George Dontas, "A New Hadrianic Building in Athens," AthAA I [1968] 221-224). The digging of a trench on Haimon st. near its junction with Tripolis (three blocks from the ex- cavations of Mr. Stavropoullos at the Academy of Plato) led to the discovery in situ of a Horos of the Academy (pl. 85, fig. 2) and part of the ancient road. The Horos is of marble, and the base, resting two m. below the present road level, is of poros. The inscription, cut vertically on the side of the stone facing E, reads: H]OPOZ TEX HEKAAE- MEIAX. It is dated by the Ephor, Miss O. Alexan- dri, to ca. the end of the sixth century B.c. (Deltion 22, B' [1967] 46; AthAA 1:2 [1968] o101-10o2). The earliest use of the ancient road appears to be from this same period. Trenches dug by utility and construction com- panies expose bits of the city's fortification system. The finds are being systematically described by the Ephors in the Deltion Chronika (Deltion 20, B' [1965] 43, 72?; 21, B' [1966] 55f; 22, B1 [1967] 37f), and more recently there are notes also in the AthAA. Wherever possible, the remains are being preserved in basements. Here described are a few of the recently found sections: South of the Olympieion, opposite No. 3 Vour- vachi st., a piece of the fourth century wall running E-w and 9 m. long was uncovered in 1966. It was three courses high and three m. thick (Deltion 22, B' [1967] 70). Another big section was exposed in 1968 in a building lot on the NE side of the street. The wall turns near here toward the Olympieion to follow the general line of the Ilissos, and in 1965 was found to run along Iosiph ton Rogon st. (Del- tion 21, B1 [1966] 55f, 65f, 67). Construction of the times of Conon and Lykurgus as well as later Ro- man work could be distinguished. To the w, in Syngrou st. between Misaraliotou and Chadzichris- tou, the wall makes a zigzag before continuing w (Deltion 20, B1 [1965] 87f, 91). It has been found at a number of places in Erechtheion st. (see Del- tion 20, B' [1965] 80-87). In 1966 part of the The- mistoclean circuit, with an E-w orientation, was ex- posed at No. 20 (AJA 71 [1967] 295; Deltion 22, B' [1967] 76). It continues a piece found earlier be- neath the opposite house (pl. 85, fig. 3).- Part of the Nw line of fortifications was found in 1968 in Dipylon st. (No. ii). The wall runs E-W across the building lot, and 11.75 m. was uncovered, three courses high and 3.35 m. wide. Miss Alexandri places this section in the fourth century and notes the correction in the line of the wall that must now be made; it had been thought to lie further to the Nw (AthAA 1:2 [1968] 102-107). A big stretch of the fourth century wall has for a long time been visible between Aristeidou and Dragatsaniou sts. (see Travlos, AA 55 [1940] 165, fig. 31), and in 1966 its continuation was found at Aristeidou and Pezmazoglou sts. (Deltion 22, B' [1967] 56). The wall, running Nw-SE, was uncov- ered for I8 m., and the proteichisma exposed (pl. 85, fig. 4). At the SE end seven courses are left, 2.96 m. high. It is constructed of big poros and con- glomerate blocks. The proteichisma, 8.5o m. to the</page><page sequence="3">1969] NEWS LETTER FROM GREECE 343 NE, is built like a retaining wall. Between the two, and parallel to them, is a drain. South of the Acropolis a 25 m. length of the Rizocastro was exposed E of the Theater of Diony- sos in the demolition of houses there (Deltion 22, B1 [1967] 35; for the problem of its date see J. Travlos, IloXEo0ojLKq' EXtMetq rwv AOhvwv [Athens 1960] 159-162). A portrait head of the third century A.D. was found at Pittakis st. No. ii, built into a pithos of the Byzantine period (pl. 85, fig. 5; Deltion 22, B1 [1967] io8). Publications. A new guide to the Heraklion Mu- seum has been published in Greek and in English (trans. by David and Eliz. French): St. Alexiou, Guide to the Archaeological Museum of Heraclion (Athens 1968). Editions in French and German will be available shortly. It is fitting that the intro- duction is by the author of the previous guide (1964), Professor N. Platon. The introduction again gives a history of the museum, a brief gen- eral history of the various excavations in Crete, and an account of the Minoan civilization, all brought up to date. This is followed by the catalogue itself. The new guide was necessitated by the addition of a new wing with four galleries, and the acquisition of the collection of Dr. Giamalakis. Some 8o ex- hibition cases have been added, and a great many objects not previously displayed are now on view. The work was carried out under the supervision of the Ephor, St. Alexiou. The French School at Athens has published a Guide de Thasos (Paris 1967), which is more than a simple guide to the excavated sites. A brief de- scription and history of the island are followed by an archaeological guide to the ancient city, a tour of the island, a description of the museum, and shorter sections on Thasian institutions, economic life, cults and coins. The first preliminary report of the excavations at Akrotiri in Thera, sponsored by the Greek Archae- ological Society, has been published: Sp. Marina- tos, Excavations at Thera, First Preliminary Report 1967, Publications of the Archaeological Society No. 64 (Athens 1968).

Karouzou, National Ar- chaeological Museum, Collection of Sculpture, A Catalogue (Athens 1968, trans. Helen Wace). CORINTHIA AND THE ARGOLID Argos. In 1968 the French School continued work in the ancient Agora (sector a) and in the square s of the Odeion (sector 8) under the super- vision of J.-Fr. Bommelaer, J.-P. Sodini and Fr. Croissant. (For the letters given the various con- structions see BCH 92 [1968] "Chronique des fouilles d'Argos," fig. i.) In sector a, the date of Building J was confirmed as Hellenistic (BCH 91 [1967] 81o-814). The Ro- man drain, K, was found to be contemporary with a floor beneath which was a fill containing frag- ments of Red-on-White lamps, but very few Corin- thian lamps. A Hadrianic denarius (third consu- late) in very good condition appears to give a still more precise date. South of the big classical portico (BCH 77 [1i953] 252-253) earlier soundings had revealed a bathing establishment. In 1968 hypocaust rooms were uncovered and what is probably a court and frigidarium. Two or three building phases were recognized as preceding the last period of use as a bath (fourth or fifth century A.D.). In the square s of the Odeion (sector 8) further excavation in the temenos found in 1967 (AJA 72 [1968] 270) confirmed its identification as a sanc- tuary of Aphrodite. Several new dedications were recovered (pl. 92, figs. 6-7) and an abundance of ceramic votive material ranging from archaic to Roman. The most important discovery was the temple on the lowest slopes of the Larissa. It is in a bad state of ruin and little is left of the super- structure. The foundations (pl. 92, fig. 8), ori- ented E-w, are partly cut into the rock, partly con- structed of poros blocks. The general plan appears to have been that of a simple cella with pronaos in antis. The few remaining blocks of the super- structure, of a local limestone, show careful work- manship and traces of double-T clamps which would agree with a date in the third quarter of the fifth century B.c. indicated by the stratigraphy at the E end. A small foundation deposit of minia- ture vases and terracotta figurines had been placed beneath the pronaos. It belongs for the most part to the end of the seventh or beginning of the sixth century B.C. These offerings are the earliest so far found in the sanctuary and they evidently remain from the destruction of an earlier temple, the foun- dations of which appear to have been incorporated into the fifth century poros foundation. Several meters from the E fagade is the poros foundation</page><page sequence="4">344 MIRIAM ERVIN [AJA 73 of an archaic altar (6 x 1.75 m., first half of sixth century B.c.), and a polygonal retaining wall be- longing to the terrace which surrounded the primi- tive temple (see pl. 92, fig. 8). The terrace was partly destroyed by the building of the fifth cen- tury temple, but its E end continued in use as part of the approach. The complete line of the peribolos is not yet clear. The entrance was probably at the NE. The s side, partly exposed in 1967, is earlier than pre- viously supposed and the w part at least should be contemporary with the building of the second temple (pl. 92, fig. 9). A settlement of the Middle Helladic period, with two phases of occupation, stretched over most of the area excavated. This was succeeded, after a period of abandonment, by a Mycenaean settlement comprising two phases, each destroyed by fire. The second phase belongs to the time of LH III C pot- tery. Precise dating of the first phase awaits analy- sis of the pottery. Corinth. The American School excavated five areas of Ancient Corinth in 1968, with Charles K. Williams as director. Investigation of the Sanctu- ary of Demeter and Kore by the road ascending Acrocorinth was continued under the direction of Miss N. Bookidis. Mr. W. Biers conducted a fourth season in the large Roman bath N of the modern plateia (to be published by the excavator). North of the Peribolos of Apollo and just E of the Lechai- on road is another bath in which a limited inves- tigation was made. The plan is early Roman and extensive alterations were made in the second cen- tury A.D. Exploration in the area of the Sacred Spring was particularly rewarding in the information gained about its history. The earliest fountain house was a rectangular building; its w wall was built into the cliff on which, further NW, stands the apsidal shrine. To the E it projected as a free- standing building. It had a reservoir with a narrow draw basin on its long E side. The roof was sup- ported by three rows of rectangular piers. On the facade was a triangular pediment. A corner block of the tympanon (pl. 85, fig. io, block visible in upright position), suggests that its height at the apex was over 0.79 m., higher than the cliff. A wall built along the top of the cliff for this pur- pose abutted the w end of the roof. No architec- tural pieces have been found so far that give any indication of the order of the facade. Pottery as- sociated with this earliest fountain house indicates construction in the first half of the fifth century B.c. It is worth noting that the pottery from the strata that had accumulated before the fountain house was built is considerably earlier. There is an abrupt change to Classical styles in the pottery which has been found in levels associated with the building, and almost no examples of the Proto- corinthian and Corinthian styles. Contemporary with the fountain house are the apsidal shrine and the Horos. The extent of the spring complex at this time is not yet known, as the associated levels are still to be excavated. At some time before the last quarter of the fifth century, the roof and res- ervoir were dismantled, and 0.23 m. of earth ac- cumulated over the original poros slab paving. In the levels of the last quarter of the fifth cen- tury the dimensions of the complex can first be recognized. The N limit was marked by the Horos, a stone curbing to the E and the wall of a ramp leading up to the triglyph terrace. The w limit of the temenos may have been formed by the triglyph wall, or may have been further w. A mudbrick wall on a stone socle marked the s boundary, and the E limit was probably the classical road. Within the temenos, E of the spring, a mud altar was con- structed and thrice rebuilt within this period (pl. 85, fig. ii). It is a sizable altar; in its third re- building it was 8.75 m. long, o.88 m. wide and 0.267-0.269 m. high. It had a greenish-tan mud plaster surface. There are heavy marks of burning along the entire length, and around each of the altars a thin layer of ash is spread out over the floor. Animal skulls and bones (butchered) were recovered from fills to E and w. East of the altars, the ground had been perforated by holes (diam. generally 0.08 to o.io m.) over an area of ca. 20 sq. m., evidently to hold stakes; 145 were counted. To the last quarter of the fourth or the beginning of the third century B.c. belongs a major alteration of the spring house. The early triglyph wall was reerected to run diagonally over the reservoir of the early spring house, where it can now be seen in situ (pl. 85, fig. io). East of the triglyph wall fill was added to raise the level from that of the fountain house floor to that of the bottom of the wall. The open w part of the reservoir was roofed and became an underground spring house. Stairs descended along the N wall of the reservoir. It was at this time also that the N-s dimension of the teme- nos was reduced by the building of a terrace wall</page><page sequence="5">1969] NEWS LETTER FROM GREECE 345 at its s side. The wall retained the fill that had been dumped here apparently in connection with a change in the orientation of the Dromos, which now ran E-w, passing only three m. from the s wall of what had earlier been the fountain house. The fall of Corinth in 146 B.c. marks the abandon- ment of the complex. The cult for which the area around the Sacred Spring was reserved remains unidentified. No in- scriptions, graffiti or dipinti were found. The com- monest type of pot was the lekythos until its re- placement in the Hellenistic period by the unguen- tarium. Of some interest also is pottery that shows Cypriote affinities. It was imported in the fourth century and is known from other sites as well (see Lucy Talcott, Athenian Agora III). It may be East Greek in origin. The area just w of the Babbius monument yield- ed Roman levels immediately over those of the Neolithic period, probably a result of Roman level- ing operations after 44 B.c. A few deep intrusions into the Neolithic strata, however, were missed by the Roman spade. Among these was a late Proto- geometric cist grave of a type already known at Corinth (C. Blegen, Corinth XIII, 15, Group B). In this tomb, however, the offerings, rather than being in the compartment at the head of the cist, were in the grave compartment with the skeleton. Isthmia. The University of California at Los Angeles conducted a second campaign in 1968. The three main areas of excavation were Tower 2 and Tower 15 of the trans-Isthmian fortification wall and the cemetery w of Kyras Vrisi, partially excavated in 1967 (AJA 72 [1968] 269). A fourth area, NW of the Temple of Poseidon, partly ex- cavated in 1967, was also investigated. The work was directed by Professor Paul A. Clement. Tower 2 is sE of the Northeast Gate at the junc- tion of the s wall of the fortress with the trans- Isthmian wall. A passageway penetrated the trans- Isthmian wall to the interior of the tower. A stair- way ascends the w face (inside the fortress) of the trans-Isthmian wall. Both fortress and wall contain much material from earlier Roman build- ings. Tower 15 is at the junction of the w line of the fortress with the trans-Isthmian wall. The interior of the tower is well preserved, and scratched into the mortar on the walls are two graffiti: one a fish (pl. 86, fig. 12), the other possibly a bow. A partial arch at the end of the fortress wall forms the en- trance to a passageway into the tower (pl. 86, fig. 13), the lintel of which is formed by several heavy column drums. Built into the back part of the vaulted entrance (pl. 86, fig. 13) is an Ionic col- umn drum evidently once belonging to the orches- tra of the theater (fragments of similar columns have been found previously, AJA 72 [1968] 269). A new gateway was found in the wall just w of the tower (pl. 86, fig. 14). It had been blocked with stone at some later period, as had also the Northeast Gate. In the cemetery w of Kyras Vrisi, some i19 burials have now been opened (pl. 86, fig. 15) most of which belong to the sixth and fifth cen- turies B.c., though a few are fourth century. Most of the burials were in sarcophagi of soft stone, with a stone lid and sometimes plastered on the inside. A few burials, among them the latest, were simple unlined pits covered by a slab. There was no evidence in the area excavated of any cemetery earlier than the sixth century B.c. A considerable amount of the pottery recovered in and around the graves is Attic. Kenchreai. The University of Chicago and In- diana University continued in 1968 their joint ef- fort for the American School. The directors of the excavation were Professors Robert L. Scranton and Dieter Thimme. For earlier accounts of the work, see Hesperia 36 (1967) 124-186 and AJA 71 (1967) 298. The submerged apsidal room (Hesperia 36 [1967] 139, fig. 5) in which the glass panels in opus sectile had been found was again drained, and the three stacks of panels left in situ at the end of the previous campaign were removed. These are now in the Museum at Nauplia where Mr. Delilakis is working on them. The doorway con- necting the apsidal room and the adjoining cellar of the "temple" to the sw was opened, and the original wooden sill, consisting of two planks each some 0.08 m. thick, was found in situ. In addition to evidence provided by radiocarbon dates obtained from the wood of the crates containing the panels (AJA 71 [1967] 298), lamps, pottery and coins indicated that the catastrophe which overwhelmed the buildings, while they were being remodeled or reconstructed, occurred not much later than 360 A.D. At the NE end of the harbor front a massive L- shaped foundation was explored. This is in shallow water, and consists of ashlar blocks on a concrete</page><page sequence="6">346 MIRIAM ERVIN [AJA 73 bedding laid over an earlier wall. Also investigated was a line of unfinished column drums, smooth and with lifting bosses, along the main body of the mole. At the innermost part of the harbor a submerged wall was found, worn by the sea in such a way as to suggest a difference of ca. one m. in sea level between ancient and modern times. Other blocks, some 35 m. from shore, perhaps once part of a wharf, indicate that the water level was still lower when they were laid (as much as 1.75 m.). A trench opened in 1966 on the harbor side of the sw pier was reopened and enlarged, to con- tinue the collection of a heavy deposit of Roman (latter part of first century A.D.) pottery. Among the finds were a carnelian gem showing a bearded head, two small wooden combs, a lamp still con- taining its wick and a variety of vegetable matter including nuts and seeds. On land, investigations at the sw end of the har- bor have shown that the area around the baptistery (Hesperia 36 [1967] 157 and pl. 47 b) was a rectan- gular enclosure ca. 6 x IO m., the walls of which include those of an earlier warehouse. There is evidence that some parts of this warehouse were in use at least into the fifth century A.D. The bap- tistery was probably built in the sixth century. Some 70 m. inland traces were found of more ware- houses. These were evidently part of the same sys- tem, which would thus have had a total length of at least 175 m. from the outer end of the pier. There is evidence in both areas that the system was built around the time of Augustus. The glass panels that had been removed from the apsidal room by the end of the 1966 season have now been cleaned and treated for preservation by Mr. Ch. Deilakis, Mme. Gille Faure and Mrs. Dieter Thimme (formerly Miss Danae Hadjila- zarou). They are now stored at Isthmia. Of par- ticular interest are: i) Portrait of Plato. This was in the same crate as the portrait of Homer which was cleaned in 1966 (Hesperia 36 [1967] pls. 42- 43; here, pl. 87, fig. i16). 2) Four very well preserved panoramas showing buildings along a water front with ships, fish and fishermen (pl. 86, fig. I7). 3) Among the fragmentary panels is part of an- other portrait. Four letters of the name are pre- served: A C T O. Mrs. Deilakis has plausibly sug- gested that he was Theophrastos. Mycenae. In 1968 excavations were continued at Mycenae as a joint Hellenic-British operation un- der the auspices of the Greek Archaeological So- ciety and the general direction of Professor George E. Mylonas. Under the supervision of Lord William Taylour, work was resumed in "Wace's Citadel House" (JHS 87 [1967] ArchRep 1966-67, 8-9) to remove the baulk left from previous excavations and to clarify the plan of the pre-destruction walls (LH III B). The excavation was both rewarding and surprising. A small storeroom (ca. 2 x 2 m.) was uncovered near the E end of the baulk and in part beneath it (ILN [4 Jan 1969] 25-27). The floor of the room was the leveled rock covered by a thin white plaster. It was filled to capacity with a series of some i6 clay figures, varying in size (the large ones ca. o.6o m. high), two complete coiled snakes of clay and fragments of at least four more. Illus- trated here are a number of the figures and one of the snakes (pl. 88, figs. 18-22). The large figures were turned on the wheel, the head as well as the body (pl. 88, fig. i9). A layer of finer clay was applied over the surface, and the features (round protruding eyes, prominent noses, surprisingly nat- uralistic ears, lips modeled and separated by a deep- ly incised line to form a compressed smile) were modeled on the surface in this finer clay. Holes in the tops of their heads will have allowed even firing of the figures. The heads of the terracotta statues of Ayia Irini, Keos, were left open on top for the same reason. The arms of the figures in general are raised, the left one sometimes stretched forward. One of the female figures has both arms forward, holding, or resting on, a pole of some sort which springs from where the navel might be. Possibly this is simply a support for the ex- tended arms; possibly, as suggested by the excava- tor, the figure held a double-axe. These larger figures are painted a monochrome red or black, with areas of the faces left in the buff color of the clay. One of the smaller figures is decorated with a pottery pattern belonging to an early phase of the LH III B style (pl. 88, fig. 22). Although the figures bear a strong resemblance to each other, great variety of detail is apparent. Most represent women (with pointed breasts and long curls over the shoulders), but one can be recognized as male (pl. 88, fig. 20). Tiny holes at various places on the larger figures (under the arms, on the neck, below the breasts for example) and on the snakes may have been necessary for the proper firing of the clay. It is possible also that some of them were</page><page sequence="7">1969] NEWS LETTER FROM GREECE 347 used for the attachment of additions in metal or fabric of some sort. In the storeroom were also undecorated kylikes and bowls, in one of which was an assortment of mold-made glass-paste ornaments. Three portable offering tables were found. The entire room was sealed up and the entrance plastered over before the general destruction of the late thirteenth century B.c. The objects within were smashed by the collapse of the roof, those in the center of the room suffering more than the ones along the walls. Adjoining this room to the w, where the ground level falls off steeply, is another, larger room, most probably related to the storeroom. The Nw corner only was excavated in 1968. Like the storeroom, this room was built directly on the rock, and is therefore at a lower level. The w wall is of mud brick covered with a layer of white clay. Against it an oblong dais (ca. 1.05 m. high) was built, and below this is a stone platform approached by two square steps. All these constructions were plastered with the white clay used for the wall. The arrange- ment of the platforms is asymmetrical. Next to the large room or court dug in 1966, and about 5 m. w of the storeroom, two communicating rooms were partially excavated. In the more east- erly room, the discovery of a number of pieces of partly worked ivory and one unworked ivory cube (0.07 m.) suggests a workshop. In the other room is a fresco, the middle part preserved over a con- tinuous surface of two m. It has three panels, each with a human figure. One shows the upper half of a woman wearing an elaborate headdress and holding in each hand some object, possibly a bunch of foliage or cereal. In another the lower half of a dress is preserved, and in the third is the almost complete figure of a man (body painted red) in woman's apparel. Porto Cheli. In 1968 a season of exploration and excavation was again carried out in the area of Porto Cheli by Indiana University and the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania under the auspices of the American School of Classical Studies. The co-di- rectors were Professors M. H. Jameson and T. W. Jacobsen, with Professor Jacobsen serving as field director (Archaeology 22 [1969] 4-9). The submerged remains of classical Halieis in the harbor of Porto Cheli were examined. As sus- pected in 1967, there proves to have been an en- closed harbor within the fortification of the classical town, the full extent of which has yet to be de- fined. A large building detected in last year's aerial photographs was investigated. The building lies next to a road some seven m. wide, which came from one of the big city gates (beneath the Ro- man bath explored in 1965) and probably went toward Hermione. Pottery found along the walls of the building suggests a date in the classical pe- riod, perhaps the fourth century B.C. Surface finds E of Halieis (about halfway be- tween the city and the ancient cemetery) included classical sherds, fragments of terracotta figurines and fragments of marble sculpture. It is likely that these finds belong to the sanctuary of Demeter first recognized by Philadelpheus. On the Acropolis, in 1965, a pit in bedrock was found containing seashells and sherds of late Neo- lithic type (grooved linear decoration). The Uni- versity of Pennsylvania has given the following C-i4 dates (P-i397): 3152 ? 72 B.c. (half life 5568) and 3306-? 74 B.c. (half life 5730). The Franchthi cave at Koilada has proved to be of tremendous importance. It has produced substan- tial stratigraphic evidence of the Mesolithic period, and it is the first site in Greece to show an appar- ently continuous sequence of occupation from late Pleistocene times through the Neolithic period (pl. 92, fig. 23). In 1968 soundings were made in two of the 1967 trenches (F and G) and one new trench (H) was dug. A particular effort was made to study the terminal aceramic horizon (first appear- ance of sheep and goat). A sequence in the late aceramic deposits directly beneath the pottery lev- els, recognized in 1967 in trench A, was also found in trench F. Samples from each of these levels have been submitted to the University of Pennsylvania for radioactive carbon analysis. A preliminary ex- amination by S. N. Payne shows the following fauna to be associated with the Middle Neolithic deposit from trench G: sheep (ovis) and goat (ca- pra) in greater numbers than anything else, pig (sus), bovid (bos)-not large animals-red deer (cervus elaphus) and other animals in small quan- tities as well as fish vertebrae of quite large size. This trench has also produced the thickest Meso- lithic deposit so far found (nearly 4 m.). The Meso- lithic levels contained chipped stone tools (general- ly flint, with obsidian first appearing near the mid- dle of the deposit) and some polished bone awls and points. Tentative identification of the fauna yielded the following: red deer, mainly adult (cer-</page><page sequence="8">348 MIRIAM ERVIN [AJA 73 vus elaphus)-in greater numbers than any other animal, fox (vulpes), pig (sus), bovid (bos or bison)-a much larger animal than the Neolithic bovid and found only in about the third quarter of the deposit. Other animals include a small canine (probably canis lupus), and there were fish with large vertebrae after the first quarter of the deposit. Near the bottom of the Mesolithic levels was a human burial with the earliest complete skeleton so far found in Greece. It lay in a semi-contracted position, legs drawn up and arms folded over the chest. It was surrounded and partly covered by many small stones. In trench H, below the Neolithic and Mesolithic levels, an abrupt change in fauna was observed. The animals resemble those of the late glacial (Wiirmi- an) deposits of south Italy (Grotta Romanelli) and Epiros (Kastritsa cave): deer (probably cervus elaphus), larger than those of the post-glacial levels and abundant in quantity; equid (probably equus hydruntinus), common throughout the de- posit; bovid (bos or bison), common in the lower levels; large caprine (probably capra ibex), spo- radic; and in small numbers hare (lepus) and pig (sus). As yet there is no evidence of a significant difference in the chipped stone industry to accom- pany the faunal change.

In 1968 the German Institute, under the direction of Professor Jantzen, excavated in the Lower Citadel (the northern part of the acropolis) in connection with work done there in 1962 (Ver- delis, Deltion i8 [1963] Chronika 66f) and with the 1965 Greek-German excavation (AA 1968). The field director was J. Schdifer. One of the most important results has been the cleaning up of many great wall blocks which had been tumbled by earthquake into the Lower Citadel where they obstructed excavation. All the area N of Dragendorff's trenches across the citadel (ill. 2, plan, No. IV) has now been cleared. The blocks have been placed on the restored part of the w fortifica- tion wall (N 49/50) and on a wide piece of the w wall just s of the northern point. The area of the deep soundings made in 1962 and 1965 within the citadel opposite the two cov- ered passages which lead to the water supply (pl. 89, fig. 24) was further explored.

Tiryns, N end of Lower Citadel (after survey by P. Grossman)</page><page sequence="9">1969] NEWS LETTER FROM GREECE 349 was cleared and the excavation carried down to bedrock, which has a steep slope at this place. The fill between floor and bedrock contained small sherds of LH III B pottery, and the date of this building is most probably in that period. In the fortification wall, opposite the w room of Building 1, a niche-like room was cleared and investigated (pl. 89, fig. 25). Other similar rooms have been observed in the wall. Their purpose is not yet clear. Further N (plan, trench II I), the s end of Build- ing 3 was clarified (pl. 89, fig. 26). The w long wall curves around in a bend into the s wall which forms an obtuse angle with the w wall and con- tinues in an approximately straight line. The s wall ends without any connection and there are no traces of a break or destruction; nor is there any eastern continuation of the wall, or any east- ern long wall. The excavators suggest that the building had the form of a hall, having at least three rooms, and being open to the E. The floor of the building consisted (at least in part) of flat slabs set on mud. Here, and in the clayey layer of debris above the building, were slight traces of fire. Sherds found in this layer were few, and it is at present uncertain whether they belong to the LH III B or C phase. In the debris on the earthen floor of the northernmost room lay two badly de- teriorated large sheets of lead similar to those pre- viously found at Mycenae and elsewhere (JHS 76 [1956] ArchRep 40), probably the remains of lead vessels. The LH III B pottery found in 1965 in and beneath the floor of Building 3 was insufficient evidence for more than a terminus post quem for the construction of the building. There is now further evidence of a settlement in the Lower Citadel after the destruction of Build- ing i. In 1962 a considerable number of LH III C sherds were found in the N and s spring passages by Verdelis. In 1965 clay floors and pottery were discovered belonging to the period following the destruction of the buildings described above. In 1968 LH III C pottery was found on a muddy layer at the bottom of the niche in the fortification wall opposite Building i (pl. 89, fig. 25), including a deep bowl fragment (pl. 89, fig. 27) with metallic black glaze and a crater fragment (pl. 89, fig. 28). Remains of an Early Helladic settlement were ascertained E of Building 3 (plan, trench II 2) in crevices and a hollow in the rock. In the Nw part of trench II 2 was a heavily burned layer of debris containing crude brick and the remains of a car- bonized beam. Pottery belongs to the "Lerna III" phase (EH II) and parallels were noticed with pottery found earlier at Tiryns (K. Miller, Tiryns IV, II, pl. 3; I18, pl. 7). Many EH sherds were also found on the surface all over the Lower Citadel. A new survey of the course of the Lower Citadel wall, started in 1965 by P. Grossman (AA 82 [1967] 92f), is being continued, and a detailed plan drawn. In addition to the work on the Lower Citadel, test trenches were made along the Nauplia-Argos road w of the site as a check on the size and density of settlement in the Lower City. Finds ranged from the EH through the Geometric styles, and the latest pottery observed was Hellenistic. A con- siderable amount of LH I-LH III A i pottery was found (property of Tsegrekos family), including several "Ephyraean" goblet fragments. There was comparatively little pottery of the LH III A 2 to III C period. Sub-Mycenaean and Protogeometric pottery were rare. There was a considerable amount of Argive Geometric pottery and it is possible that in this place there was a Geometric cemetery. On property belonging to M. Bavela, there were re- mains of a Mycenaean building. ELIS Armatova. At the invitation of the Greek Ar- chaeological Service, salvage excavations were car- ried out in 1968 by the American School of Clas- sical Studies with the cooperation of the University of Colorado. The field director was Professor John E. Coleman. The site is on a table-like hill NE of the village of Agrapidochori, overlooking the Pe- neios at its juncture with the Ladon river (AJA 72 [1968] 272, ill. i). Themelis and Coleman be- lieve that this is the Pylos in Elis the ruins of which were seen by Pausanias as he traveled the moun- tain road from Olympia to Elis (Paus. 6.22.5; Ernst Meyer in RE, s.v. Pylos, 2133-34; J. Sperling, "Ex- plorations in Elis, 1939," AJA 46 [1942] 79; P. Themelis in Deltion 20, B' [1965] 214). Identifi- cation rests on the literary evidence, as no archaeo- logical remains have yet provided confirmation. The ruins near Agrapidochori were observed by the French Commission in 1829. Colonel Leake pre- ferred a site further up the Ladon on its left bank (Travels in the Morea II [London 1830] 228-229; Peloponnesiaca [London 1846] 219). Trial trenches were made in 1964 by the Epime-</page><page sequence="10">350 MIRIAM ERVIN [AJA 73 lete, P. Themelis (Deltion 20, B2 [1965] 214) and in 1907 by the Austrian Archaeological Institute (not published). In 1968 a number of trial trenches were first made to determine the nature of the ancient deposit which proved, in general, to be shallow. Remains of houses were found in two areas. Near the sw edge of the hill (Area C) where Themelis had found and partly cleared a classical house, several houses were excavated. The lower parts of the walls are of unworked pieces of sandstone; it is likely that the upper parts were made of brick. Pottery found is datable to the late fifth and early fourth cen- turies B.c. Houses found at the w end of the hill (Areas B and E, the largest section excavated) yielded clearer groundplans. Two of the best pre- served have a number of rectangular rooms, and there is an alleyway between them (pl. 92, fig. 29). Their construction is similar to that of the houses near the sw edge of the hill. The arrangement is reminiscent of Olynthos and suggests a town grid. Finds include household pottery of the early fourth century and terracotta spools. In this same area, Themelis had found a well which contained late Geometric and early archaic pottery. Its excavation was completed in 1968. Pottery recovered resem- bled that found in 1964, although there were no figured pieces. In a field NE of Armatova (Area F) seventeen Roman graves of the late third or early fourth cen- tury A.D. were excavated (two had been dug in this cemetery by Themelis). Twelve of these con- tained objects, for the most part pottery, but in- cluding also some terracotta lamps, glass vessels, coins and a bronze dipper. An earth-cut well was found in the SE group of graves in this same area. It contained many fine potsherds, evidently of a local style (J. E. Cole- man, "Archaic Pottery from Pylos in Elis," AthAA S1:3 [1968] 285-288). The decoration is usually a fine black glaze, occasionally with bands of red or white. Some pots have patterns in black and red on a light ground. A few pieces have figures. Shown here is a fragment with a man drawing his sword (pl. 92, fig. 30). The well was evidently out of use at some time in the late seventh or early sixth century B.c. At the E end of the hill a number of graves were exposed, one of which contained a Middle Bronze Age cup (Gray Minyan). LACONIA Pavlopetri Island. The Cambridge University Underwater Exploration Group, acting under the direction of the Ephor of Lakonia and Arcadia, A. Delivoria, in 1968 explored a prehistoric site at Pavlopetri island between Elaphonisos and the mainland (Cambridge University Underwater Ex- ploration Group, Expedition to Elaphonisos 1968; a full report is to appear in BSA 64 [19691). Mr. G. Cadogan, attached to the expedition as archaeologist, has kindly provided the information for this account. The ancient remains represent a large settlement that extended from the present mainland shore, where some 60 small round chamber tombs have been found, out to and including Pavlopetri, which is ca. 200 m. offshore. The old coast line will have been s of the island and the reefs along its s side. The site beneath the sea was discovered in 1967 by Mr. N. C. Flemming of the National Institute of Oceanography while studying changes of sea level in the eastern Mediterranean. The cemetery on the mainland shore and some quarries of unknown date were noticed in 18o6 by Colonel Leake. As a result of the underwater survey, a plan was made (plan, ill. 3) showing building complexes and a main NE-SW street, with others leading off from it at right angles. Across one of the streets (plan, street i) is a wall which might be a founda- tion for a gate. The houses seem to have as many as ten rooms, varying in size from 10io x 5 m. to 4 x 2 m. A large square room in the center of some of them may be a court. Other building remains were found on Pavlopetri (particularly noticeable in an eroded bank on the N side) which, although now separated by ioo m. from the ruins under water, was once part of the main site. The town was probably Mycenaean, but, as no excavation has been made either on land or beneath the sea, and hardly anything comparable has been dug on the mainland, this cannot be regarded as certain. The pottery found is of the EH (showing affinities with the pottery of Syros), MH and LH I-III B styles. No LH III C pottery has been reported. There is little evidence of any reconstruction on the site, but one building (IX) seems to antedate the site proper and may belong to the EH period. In addition to the chamber tombs on the main- land shore, two rectangular Mycenaean chamber tombs were found on the s side of the island, and, among the houses under water, 37 slab-built (or</page><page sequence="11">1969] NEWS LETTER FROM GREECE 351 - dbs .4.4 s t t - ii*-J 4 ~n 0 's5il b* Wt90do w0 ow dm UVu  El .... .,/t_d_ g -W  :. ..

Their date and relationship to the houses is at present uncertain. The latest occupation on the island is late Roman, and it is possible that there was a settlement of refugees from the Slav invasions of the sixth and seventh centuries A.D. (see S. Hood on Porto Rafti and Navarino in Acta Musei Nationalis Pragae 20 [1966] i65f). THESSALY Mt. Olympos. As a result of the construction of a meteorological station (1961-65) on the summit of Ayios Antonios (a peak s of the highest point, Mytikas, and ioo m. lower), evidence has been found for the existence of a sanctuary of Zeus (a number of fragmentary inscribed stelai) at least as early as the Hellenistic period (bronze coin of Antigonos Gonatas) and continuing on into the Christian era (B. Kyriazopoulou and G. Libada, 'ApXaoXOYLoK6 Ep'v'pTLa raTL -T?7~ Kopv-U)lM 'TOV 'OX irov 'Ayol 'Avrdjvo, Deltion 22 A [ 1967] 6-14).

The bones include a good number of astragaloi. There are also pottery frag- ments, a few iron nails, and fragments of statue bases and statues. CYCLADES Delos. The 1968 campaign of the French School continued exploration of the Skardhana quarter, Insula E and the immediate neighborhood (plan, ill. 4). Five houses (III-VII) occupy a series of three terraces w of those previously explored, on the slope that rises toward the House on the Hill. Their mediocre construction, lack of peristyles and mosaics, and stereotype floor plans indicate a mod- est section of the town. North of the insula, toward the angle formed by the N and w streets, a sounding revealed a more luxurious house, with rooms arranged E and w of a large court with mosaic pavement. The thresholds are of long marble slabs, carefully polished. A plat- form of marble slabs and mosaic rises at the N part of the court. Architectural elements found here suggest that the platform supported a portico. A small monument was found in situ in front of the platform. Both Insula E and the buildings to the N were violently destroyed. A burned layer, 1.50 m. thick, covered the mosaic court and extended beyond it</page><page sequence="13">1969] NEWS LETTER FROM GREECE 353 in all directions. It contained fragments of car- bonized wood. The intensity of the fire was such that the lead from the drains melted and formed pools in the cavities of the pavement. The walls of House VII were blackened by the fire. Abandoned by the inhabitants were silver coins, and pieces of bronze applique which recall in style the bronzes of Mahdia. There is some evidence that this fiery destruction was the result of war. Three skeletons were found, and beneath the surface of the last pe- riod of use of the w and N streets is a layer of de- struction and rubbish thrown out from the neigh- boring houses. Finally, these streets were blocked off, near the corner of the insula, by walls hastily constructed of a variety of materials. In the insula where the jewelry was found, - of Insula E, stratigraphic soundings clarified the ear- lier phases of occupation and building plans. The earliest of these goes back to the end of the third century. Keos. Excavations at Ayia Irini were continued in 1968 by the University of Cincinnati under the sponsorship of the American School of Classical Studies and the authority of the Greek Archaeo- logical Service. Work on the Early Bronze Age House E (J. L. Caskey, "Investigations in Keos, 1963," Hesperia 33 [1964] 319) was resumed. Part of this building lies beneath the foundations of House C and is inacces- sible. Beneath the place where the big terracotta pan-hearth had been found in 1963 was an earlier hearth, smaller and less elaborate. It has been removed. Remains of Early Bronze Age walls have now been found in various places (plan, ill. 5), characterized by the use of small flat stones and neatly constructed. The orientation of the EB walls so far found differs slightly from that of the suc- ceeding buildings. In 1967 an apsidal construction was uncovered within the big fortification wall (AJA 72 [1968] 274) at a point nearly opposite the stairway lead- ing to a spring chamber outside the fortification wall in Area J. Excavation in 1968 showed this to be a tower of a defensive system which precedes the big fortification wall and belongs to an early stage of the Middle Bronze Age. Some of the in- ner face of the tower wall is preserved and a door- way leading into it. A stretch of about 32 m. of the fortification wall (DJ) belonging to it (1.20- 1.50 m. thick) and a gateway, 1.20 m. wide, have also been found. A street ran along the inner, s .oU ILL. 5. Keos. Ayia Irini, general plan 1968 side of the wall for at least part of its course. Evi- dence for a more precise date of this earlier fortifi- cation system has not yet been examined in detail. The western end of the big establishment known as House A, and the three southern rooms of House F were cleared (J. L. Caskey, "Excavations in Ke- os, 1964-1965," Hesperia 35 [1966] 371-373). Rooms IV and V of House F (like I, II and III) are deep basements. A stairway leads from V to VI, which has no cellar beneath it. A second flight of stairs continues to the missing second floor. Pre- liminary inspection of the pottery indicates that House F was repaired and reused after a partial destruction in the big earthquake of the fifteenth century. Debris from the western rooms of House A, on the other hand, suggests that they were not reused. Among the finds from these rooms was a large piece of a bronze ingot of "ox-hide" shape. A retaining wall, A (see plan), on the E side of the town beyond the main gateway (pl. 89, fig.- 31), proved upon further examination to have been wholly exposed along its outer face in late Roman times, though probably it was built much earlier. Under it were found older retaining walls, notably MG (pl. 89, fig. 32), which is of cyclopean mason- ry. They are below modern water level and can be investigated only with the use of a pump. Sherds of</page><page sequence="14">354 MIRIAM ERVIN [AJA 73 LH III A 2 style lay near the foot of MG. These walls may have been built to support the ground outside the main gate and protect it from erosion, perhaps after a sudden rise in the level of the sea. Conservation of the finds was ably carried for- ward by Miss Stella Bouzakis and Miss Anastasia Voutsina, recent graduates of the course in Con- servation of Antiquities at the Doxiadis School. Naxos. Professor N. Kontoleon resumed his ex- cavation in 1968 of the Mycenaean settlement along the shore at the N edge of the town, under the aus- pices of the Archaeological Society (Ergon 1965 [1966] 121; Ergon 1967 [1968] 82).

Mycenaean settlement, 1967 Ergon 1967 (1968) 85, fig. 87 Although the house now lies partly beneath the sea, it was possible to expose three of the walls and a plaster floor. In the middle of the s wall is a doorway with threshold. Fragments of a pithoid jar with spiral decoration of the last phase of My- cenaean III A were beneath a stone that had fallen onto the floor, probably as a result of an earth- quake. It gives further evidence that the floruit of the town coincides with the Mycenaean III A style. Overlying walls and floor levels give evidence of continued occupation of the site. In building complex A (see plan) a hard floor belonging to the Geometric period lies above these earlier struc- tures. The Hellenistic stoa along the E side of the Agora was further explored. North of the road another foundation was found, which does not form an exact right angle with the Hellenistic stoa and may therefore belong to another building. Santorini. Akrotiri. In 1968 Professor Marinatos continued the excavation of the site below Akrotiri which he initiated in 1967 (AJA 72 [1968] 276-277). The work was again under the sponsorship of the Archaeological Society. For the 1967 season, the reader is referred to Sp. Marinatos, Excavations at Thera, First Preliminary Report 1967 (Athens 1968). For 1968, see Marinatos, "The Excavation of Thera," AthAA 1:3 [1968] 213-220. Work was continued w of the ravine in a section known as Bronos 2, where remains of the upper storey of a building with flagstone floor and a pil- lar were partially excavated in 1967. More fresco fragments were recovered, among them pieces showing birds, plants and grasses, while one piece appears to represent part of a blue monkey. The storeroom opened in 1967 on the E side of the ravine (Arvanitis i) has now been completely uncovered. It has three compartments, and had been packed full of pottery of various kinds. Part of a series of pithoi were found in situ in 1967 and more were uncovered in 1968. Some still had their stone lids in place. Most of them are painted; some are decorated with relief bands of rope pattern. Illustrated here is a fine example with white lilies on a dark ground (pl. 90, fig. 33). In it was found a clay figurine. Large snails lay at the bottom of one of the smaller pithoi (pl. 91, fig. 34) and in another there was barley flour. Among the smaller pots were the two jugs shown here (pls. 90-91, figs. 35-36). Pottery of various categories has been found, in- cluding Cycladic matt-painted ware, white on dark, and polychrome ware with decorations in black, red and white. Animals, men and birds are rep- resented on some of the pots. A magnificent nar- row basin with a flight of swallows around its sides is shown in pl. 91, fig. 37, and three swal- lows decorate the belly of a bird-beak jug (pl. 90, fig. 38). Imported Minoan pottery has also been found. As reported in 1967, nothing later than the LM I A style has been recognized. One of the most interesting of the finds from the storeroom is a series of lead weights, the small- est weighing I1 gr., the largest 737 gr. They are in general badly oxidized. Weights of this same sort have been found at Ayia Irini in Keos. Another weight from the storeroom is of stone. It weighs 20.2 gr. and is inscribed with a triangular mark A.</page><page sequence="15">1969] NEWS LETTER FROM GREECE 355 Professor Marinatos emphasizes that the excava- tion of 1968 was of limited extent, major attention being given to the protection and consolidation of the area and the channeling of the stream that runs through the ravine in the rainy season. OTHER AEGEAN ISLANDS Samos. In 1965 Professor Ulf Jantzen started a new excavation in Kastro Tigani, the fortress built in 1824 by Lykourgos Logothetis on the small peninsula s of the ancient walled city of Samos. The village of Tigani covers part of the site today. The area has suffered generally from later construction, and lime kilns have also ac- counted for a number of ancient remains. The building of a school in 1915, however, led to the finding of portrait heads of Roman Imperial date and ultimately to the excavations in 1928 and 1930 of E. Buschor and W. Wrede (AA 53 [1928] 623f; 54 [I929] IIOf; 56 [1931] 286f). The 1965-68 cam- paigns have been concentrated on the area of Wrede's "Late Hellenistic Rectangular Building," "North and South Peristyles" and to the s. As a result of the 1966 campaign, the constructions, thought earlier to be unconnected, were recog- nized as part of a single palatial Hellenistic villa. Professor Jantzen compares the late Hellenistic houses of Delos and Priene, and the palace on the acropolis at Pergamon. The building has two inner peristyle courts ("North and South Peristyles") with connected halls and rooms (including the "Late Hellenistic Rectangular Building") grouped around these (see plan AA [1966] 164, fig. io). A stairway, found in 1965 at the NW, leads into the first inner court, the "North Peristyle." It cor- responds with the long approaches of other Hel- lenistic villas. Architectural elements include col- umns, architrave blocks, simas with lion spouts and a Corinthian capital. A cistern found beneath the "Rectangular Building" (AA [1968] "Samos 1967") was filled before the building went up. It contained pottery no later than 150 B.C., thus giv- ing a terminus post quem for the complex. In Roman times considerable changes were made, including the addition of water installations with channels and basins and a fountain. Over the N part of the complex lie the remains of an Early Christian basilica of the second half of the fifth century. For the foundation of its N wall the s wall of the "Rectangular Building" was employed. Within the s court a small Byzantine chapel of uncertain date was erected. The E and w parts of the complex have not yet been excavated. Some of this lies beneath modern buildings. The s part has to some extent been destroyed by the sea, but enough remains for a reconstruction of the plan. Beneath the Hellenistic villa lies a thick prehis- toric deposit. In 1967 and 1968 undisturbed strati- fied deposits were found in a number of places, giv- ing evidence of a late Neolithic settlement: hollows in the virgin soil, a stone vessel in situ on slabs of schist next to a wall, shells, bone and obsidian tools, pottery, house walls and a burnt stratum. A group of ten wholly preserved pots are of some impor- tance in connection with the relationship with Ana- tolia discussed by Milojcid (Chronologie der jin- geren Steinzeit Mittel und Siideuropas [1940] 24; Samos I. Die priihistorische Siedlung unter dem Heraion [1961] 56) and Mellaart (AnatSt 7 [19571] 70). One of the late Neolithic pots from Tigani is illustrated here (pl. 87, fig. 39). City of Samos: a new plan of the entire fortifica- tion wall, together with the existing remains of the city within, is being prepared and has clarified the actual area of the town. Earlier plans are those of F. Humann in 1861-62 and E. Fabricius in AM 9 [1884] pl. vii. In 1930 W. Wrede made new meas- urements, a few small excavations in various places, and photographed the entire course of the wall (AM 6o-6i [1935-36] 114). This work was not finished. The entire circuit is approximately 6.7 km. long, and encloses an area of o103 hektars. The wall is 4.6 m. wide. There are evidently 35 towers and at least 12 gates or smaller entrances. In some places the wall is still preserved to a height of 6 m. The oldest parts are of polygonal masonry (pl. 87, fig. 40) belonging to the sixth century B.c. and possibly built by Polykrates. The early circuit had the same extent as in later times. The sea and harbor walls have also been traced. Although most of what is visible today is not an- cient, it appears that Humann, in plotting the course of these walls, was able to follow the line of the ancient construction (Hdt. 3.60). The course of the Roman water supply system was studied during 1967 and 1968. It originates above the village of Myli some io km. away, and follows a route along the slopes N of the Heraion plain. It courses s below the Eupalinos system, along an arched aqueduct, and can be followed into the Chesios valley.</page><page sequence="16">356 MIRIAM ERVIN [AJA 73 At the sw corner of the city, where the land and sea walls come together, are the ruins known to- day as the "Dontia" (pl. 87, fig. 41). The three buttresses standing ca. 6.5 m. high have always been a puzzle. Preliminary inspection revealed that they belong to a large vaulted hall with four pillars on either side (N and s). The construction resembles that of the period of Justinian. Built into the foundations are fragments of Hellenistic build- ings. The construction was later incorporated into a Byzantine church. Archanes. In 1967 the Epimelete I. Sakellarakis continued excavation of the Minoan burial ground on Phourni hill for the Archaeological Society (Ergon 1967 [1968] 96-103). The extent of the cemetery was investigated and further work was done in the building enclosing tomb B (found in 1966). A gold ring with a representation of a god- dess driving a griffin, and a steatite seal in the form of a bull's head came from the room with a central pillar, although that room had been looted. At a lower level were found earlier wall foundations and floor slabs. To this Early Palace period belong also a number of larnax burials and, among other objects, the stone figurine shown in pl. 92, fig. 42. South of tomb B, the excavation of F was con- tinued. It is square in shape, with four rooms and a stairway along the E side rising to the second floor. From this building came three ivory seals, an ivory comb, spherical and almond-shaped beads of gold and, of especial interest, fragments of tripod offer- ing tables and plaster horns of consecration. Building E, w of F, has five rooms. In the w part of the building were pithoi and larnakes con- taining skulls, placed here in the Early Palace pe- riod. These differ strikingly from those found in the earlier ossuary (1965) in which the skulls, mainly in larnakes, were accompanied by many of- ferings. In building E the skulls were mainly in pithoi and there were few offerings other than a Near Eastern cylinder seal of lapis lazuli. Knossos. In 1967 the excavation of the Unex- plored Mansion next to the Little Palace was un- dertaken by the British School of Archaeology in the hope of acquiring new evidence for the date of the main destruction at Knossos (JHS 88 [1968]; ArchRep 1967-68, 21). The work was continued in 1968 under the direction of M. R. Popham and L. H. Sackett. The post-Minoan overlay of the Un- explored Mansion was cleared, revealing in the sw area a section of paved Roman street and as- sociated occupation level of the first century A.D., a Hellenistic occupation level and some Geometric and Protogeometric remains. The Unexplored Mansion had been used as a stone quarry and was full of deep robbing pits, chiefly of Geometric times. Part of the E facade had been removed, and in some places the founda- tion course had been reached. A paved E-w pas- sage, which divided the area in half, was cleared. Above it was an ashy earthen floor which contained LM II sherds. LM II sherds were found also in the debris of a back stairway of the building which must have remained out of use after its destruction at some time in this period. Resting above the ashy earthen floor was debris which had fallen from an upper storey, and which included LM III A i sherds. LM III A i pottery was found also in a blocked window of the N facade along the pas- sageway. The debris which fell into the passageway had never been removed, and indicates a major catastrophe at the time of the LM III A i pottery style. The main rooms of the building evidently were cleared out following the LM III A i de- struction. The extent of LM III A i reconstruction and restoration is difficult to distinguish from sub- sequent LM III B work. Some of the rooms, after further remodeling, continued in use into the time when LM III B pottery was made. A large figurine of a goddess with upraised arms and a stirrup jar with painted Linear B inscription, both probably fallen from some upper room, form a strange con- trast to the crude manner of building then in use. Although it is uncertain when the Unexplored Mansion was built, it is likely to have been at the time that LM II pottery was used. The N wall of the passageway proves to be a terrace wall, the fill behind which contained early LM I A sherds. One of the rubbish pits which had been dug into the fill, however, produced a fine stone vase engraved with a bull-catching scene comparable to that on one of the Vaphio cups. There are no LM I B sherds either from the terrace and pits or from the house. It is possible therefore that the terrace fill represents debris from a building abandoned when LM I A pottery was in use, and demolished when the site was prepared for construction of the Un- explored Mansion. This building may well prove to be the first LM II structure so far found at Knossos. At Sellopoulo two tombs were investigated by the British School in collaboration with the Ephor S. Alexiou. The first tomb, some 150 m. SE of the</page><page sequence="17">1969] NEWS LETTER FROM GREECE 357 two tombs excavated previously by Professors Hux- ley and Platon, had been robbed. A few bronzes and some LM III A i vases were found. The second chamber tomb, nearby, had not been robbed, but had been damaged by the fall of the roof and con- sequent penetration of water. In it were three skeletons, two of them male and buried with swords, spearheads, gold and faYence necklaces, seal- stones, rings, mirrors, razors and many bronze ves- sels. There were also remains of a wooden bier. The third skeleton had around its neck a necklace of falence and glass-paste ornaments and a scarab with a cartouche of Amenophis III (ca. 1417-1379 B.c.). The vases found were chiefly plain wares of LM III A i style. There are however a large dec- orated LM III A i stirrup jar and a high spouted jug of Mycenaean III A i style (if not of Myce- naean origin), and the scarab has thus provided one of the best synchronisms so far found for this period. Lato. The French School continued in 1968 their exploration of the area of the big temple (BCH 92 [1968] 1125; AJA 72 [1968] 277). Soundings be- tween the N wall of the temple and the terrace wall showed that the terrace had been made at one time by bringing in a pebbly fill. Beneath the ter- race fill were found three kilns. One was very well preserved and still had intact the lower chamber with a pillar in the middle to support the firing chamber. The kilns contained much pottery, al- though nothing whole. Among the finds were pithos fragments, two daedalic heads and a basin with a stamped decoration. The kilns have been dated from the finds in the second half of the sev- enth century. The most remarkable of the objects found here is a statuette representing an enthroned pregnant woman, undoubtedly to be connected in some way with Eileithyia, the most important god- dess of Lato. The kilns and their contents are to be published in BCH 93 (1969) Part II. Clearing of the area at the N foot of the temple terrace revealed a series of steps (pl. 92, fig. 43) partly built, partly cut out of the rock. A building (12 m. x 2.50) at the E end of the steps should belong, with them, to some public complex. Mrs. V. Hadjimichali continued her study of the houses of Lato, and part of the city wall was cleared s of the Agora. Mallia. In 1968 the French School excavated in three areas: in the Palace w of the central court, sw of the Palace (BCH 85 [1961] 940-943), and in the large Protopalatial building w of Sector A (Sector Mu). Palace: beneath Rooms VI 9, VI io and Store- room II i were found remains of the first palace of Mallia, hitherto known only from sparse pottery finds. The walls have the same orientation as the main lines of the second Palace. Later walls pre- vented the complete exploration of the rooms, but they are evidently small, with a floor of pounded earth or a layer of pumice. Violent destruction by fire at the time of EM III pottery left the rooms full of burned debris. Southwest of the palace: earlier soundings had revealed a stratification that included pre-palatial levels (BCH 89 [1965] 10oo5); these were investi- gated further. Sector Mu: in the third campaign in this section, exploration was extended toward the E. A deposit found in a building here consisted of 12 "clay labels" similar to those found in the hieroglyphic deposit of the Knossos Palace and in the archives storeroom of the Palace at Mallia, four hieroglyphic seal impressions on clay (identical to three other imprints found in 1966 and 1967). The "labels" are inscribed on one face only with two to four signs. Further E a storeroom with many jars in situ was uncovered, and two small rooms with benches. To the w, the exploration of a building noticed in 1967 revealed basement rooms approached through an entrance with a column on either side, a paved vestibule and stuccoed courtyard. The courtyard served additional rooms in which were found a Camares polychrome cup and a tablet fragment with a hieroglyphic sign on each face. Myrtos. A second campaign by the British School at Myrtos near Hierapetra uncovered the rest of the town in 1968. It proves to be a single complex of more than 8o rooms, covering ca. 1250 sq. m., without fortifications. The place was occupied only in EM II and was destroyed by fire. Objects found include some 550 vases and pithoi, a group of pot- ter's tournettes, sealstones, a dagger and a chisel of copper, small figurines, some obsidian, bones of sheep/goat, pig and cattle, and grape seeds. A bell- shaped anthropomorphic figure about 8" high, found on a flat-topped stone structure in one of the rooms, suggests to the excavator that this was a religious shrine (P. Warren in ILN [8 Feb. 1969] 26-27). ATHENS AND CINCINNATI</page><page sequence="18">ERVIN PLATE 85 FIG. I. Hadrian st. 78, N outer wall of Roman building FIG. 3. Erectheion st. 20, city wall FIG. 4.
