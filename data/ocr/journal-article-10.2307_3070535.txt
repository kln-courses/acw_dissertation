<plain_text><page sequence="1">OPINION KNOWING QUANTA: THE AMBIGUOUS METAPHORS OF POPULAR PHYSICS BY ELIZABETH LEANE In the late 1990s popular science writing has gained a prominence not seen since the interwar period of James Jeans, Arthur Eddington and J. B. S. Haldane. This is evident not only in the increased commercial success of the genre but also in its impact on traditional literary culture. John Carey, in his introduction to the Faber Book of Science, claims that science popularizers 'have created a new kind of late twentieth-century literature, which demands to be recognized as a separate genre, distinct from the old literary forms, and conveying pleasures and triumphs quite different from theirs'.' In April 1999 the Royal Society of Literature announced its decision to invite scientists to be fellows, as 'an acknowledgement of the quality and range of contemporary science writing'.2 The Cheltenham Literary Festival, in October of the same year, featured over a dozen science popularizers in its programme.3 Creative writers have been quick to explore the possibilities presented by the new genre. Michael Frayn's play Copenhagen, which opened to critical and popular acclaim in May 1998, is only the latest in a series of literary harbingers of a new age of harmony, or at least meaningful exchange, between literature and science. Acknowledgements to science popularizers-usually physicists-are becoming a common sight in prefaces to novels and plays. Besides Frayn, one could mention Tom Stoppard, who found inspiration for Arcadia in James Gleick's Chaos, and begins Hapgood, a play centred on a convoluted quantum mechanical espionage plot, with a quotation from physicist and popularizer Richard Feynman;4 or Ian McEwan, who acknowledges physicist David Bohm's Wholeness and the Implicate Order as a source for The Child in Time, and has a science writer as the protagonist of his Enduring Love.5 The 'male novelists of 1 J.

S. Byatt, who enlisted snail geneticist cum popularizer Steve Jones to provide the scientific background for her Babel Tower;7 or Margaret Atwood, who in the acknowledgements to her novel Cat's Eye states, 'The physics and cosmology sideswiped herein are indebted to Paul Davies, Carl Sagan, John Gribbin and Stephen W. Hawking, for their entrancing books on these subjects', and borrows a quotation from A BriefHistory of Time as an epigraph;8 and Janet Turner Hospital, who lists three physics popularizations, including FritjofCapra's The Tao ofPhysics, as 'helpful background material' for her novel Charades.9 Literary critics should be well equipped to deal with these interdisciplinary appropriations, as they have themselves been mining popularizations, parti- cularly those dealing with supposedly 'postmodern' areas of physics such as quantum mechanics, for at least two decades. Quantum mechanics entered into popular consciousness about twenty-five years ago, following the huge success of The Tao of Physics and its New Age imitators, such as Gary Zukav's bestseller The Dancing Wu Li Masters.10 Since this time, almost every quantum phenomenon has been leapt upon with alacrity and assigned one or more literary parallels: 'complementarity corresponds to the oxymoron, holism to the synecdoche, fusion of identities to the metaphor and the shifting of identity to the metonymy. The observer-participation has its counterpart in the problem of interpretation.'l1 The wave-particle duality is a challenge to 'the Aristotelian logic of identity that informs all Western metaphysics';12 the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) thought experiment is presented in terms of Derridean metaphysics as 'Perhaps the most unsettling evidence of the invisible (or "occulted") presence of the other, or the apparently absent'.13 6 L.

(Frayn's central achievement in Copenhagen is to bring a refreshing perspective to this tired metaphor.) This kind of construction of cross-disciplinary parallels between physics and literary criticism is subject to constraints which do not necessarily apply to the freewheeling metaphors of Stoppard and others. Physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont, in their attack on the misuse of science within the humanities, Intellectual Impostures, have no grievance with a poet who 'uses words like "black hole" or "degree of freedom" out of context and without really understanding their scientific meaning', reserving their wrath for those whose 'intention is clearly to produce theory'.'4 Ficto-criticism and post- structuralist playfulness notwithstanding, the majority of literary critics would probably agree that standards of accuracy and clarity of meaning differ between literature and scholarship. The onus falls, then, on those who construct metaphorical connections between quantum mechanics and literature to explain why these particular parallels should be considered important or useful. One of Feynman's many anecdotes describes a talk he attended in which the speaker suggested a mathematical analogy for his subject, poetry. Feynman, then a student, was asked to extend this analogy to theoretical physics. He gleefully relates his response: I got up and said, 'Yes, it's very closely related. In theoretical physics, the analog of the word is the mathematical formula, the analog of the structure of the poem is the interrelationship of the theoretical bling-bling with the so-and-so'-and I went through the whole thing, making a perfect analogy. The speaker's eyes were beaming with happiness. Then I said, 'It seems to me that no matter what you say about poetry, I could find a way of making up an analog with any subject, just as I did for theoretical physics. I don't consider such analogs meaningful.'5 The mature Feynman is equally concerned about the validity of analogies: 'How do you get new ideas? That you do by analogy, mostly, and in working with analogy you often make very great errors. ... I leave to your English professors the problem of pointing out the errors of reasoning by analogy.'16 Feynman is not known for his sensitivity to non-scientific disciplines, and very few literary critics would take his criticism or advice seriously. Never- theless, his comments do raise important questions. Why do literary critics find the parallels they identify between literature and science meaningful? Sokal and Bricmont claim that 'a metaphor is usually employed to clarify an 14 A. Sokal and J. Bricmont, Intellectual Impostures: Postmodern Philosophers' Abuse of Science (London, 1988), 8. 15 R.

In the past an unstated purpose of such analogies has frequently been to lend scientific authority to literary concepts. Literary critic Katherine Hayles, among others, has devoted much effort to replacing the unthinking assumptions of this 'influence model' with a more complex understanding of disciplinary parallels originating from a broad 'cultural matrix' in which both scientific and literary concepts are embedded.18 Less attention, however, has been paid to the question of 'error' in science- based analogies. This is surprising, given the amount of criticism which scientists and mathematicians such as Sokal, Gross, and Levitt and others have levelled at the misuse of scientific terms by critics in the humanities.'9 They criticize the way in which non-scientists reduce scientific theories to 'themes' such as '"uncertainty", "discontinuity", "chaos" or "non-linearity" which are then analysed in a purely verbal manner', and argue that 'scientific theories are not like novels; in a scientific context these words have specific meanings, which differ in subtle but crucial ways from their everyday meanings, and which can only be understood within a complex web of theory and experiment. If one uses them only as metaphors, one is easily led to nonsensical conclusions.'20 Sokal's infamous hoax article-Feynman's prank writ large- contains numerous misuses of scientific terms and inaccuracies which the editors of Social Text presumably overlooked or deemed insignificant. One issue raised by the 'Sokal affair' is that of authority: to what extent can a non-scientist be competent to appropriate, analyse, or judge analyses of scientific theories and concepts? While Sokal suggests that it is possible for specialists to gain 'a modest knowledge' of other disciplines, he does not directly address the question of how non-scientists might acquire such a knowledge of physics. In a footnote, however, he adds that 'intelligent non- scientists seriously interested in the conceptual problems raised by quantum 17 Intellectual Impostures, 9. 18 N. K.

Scholnick (ed.), American Literature and Science (Lexington, 1992), 229-50. 19 Gross (a biologist) and Levitt (a mathematician) published a monograph entitled Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and its Quarrels with Science (Baltimore, 1994), a virulent attack on a range of related approaches to 'science studies' including post-structuralist literary criticism, constructivist sociology, and political criticism.

The editors of Social Text, a leading US cultural studies journal, failed to recognize Sokal's article as a parody of science studies criticism. The 'Sokal affair' received world-wide media attention and revived the 'two cultures' debate in a new form. 20 Sokal and Bricmont, Intellectual Impostures, 177. 414</page><page sequence="5">KNOWING QUANTA mechanics need no longer rely on the vulgarizations (in both senses) published by Heisenberg, Bohr and sundry physicists and New Age authors' (recom- mending in their place David Alberts's Quantum Mechanics and Experience).2' The question which indirectly arises from Sokal's observations is one which is rarely addressed in 'literature and science' criticism: what sources do literary critics refer to when they decide to appropriate or analyse scientific theories, and are these sources themselves subjected to literary analysis? My central argument here revolves around the assertion that-in the case of quantum physics, at least-science popularizations provide a major source for these critics, and that the rhetorical construction of these popularizations will influence critics' (as well as other readers') understanding of scientific concepts. In particular, the rhetorical devices employed by popularizers, such as metaphor, may generate meaning in excess of the accepted scientific concepts which are the apparent content of the text. Yet what has been missing in the excited embracement of popular science described above is critical- rather than creative-attention to the popularizations themselves. One preliminary step towards a critical engagement with popularizations is to ask which particular texts literary critics favour, and how this affects their theorizing. Although some of the critics working within 'literature and science' criticism (Hayles, for example) have scientific training, it is likely that the majority do not have a background in science. This becomes evident when articles contain statements which appear scientifically misleading, if not inaccurate. A common error is the assumption that the theory of relativity leads logically to quantum theory, a confusion presumably deriving from the fact that Einstein made important early contributions to the latter;22 a similar conflation between the two theories leads to the claim that relativity 'collapses the subject-object dichotomy'.23 On other occasions critics obfuscate, inten- tionally or unintentionally, the meaning of popularizers they cite by neglecting to include the context of their remarks, or by presenting a speculative idea as an established theory.24 21 A. Sokal, 'Transgressing the Boundaries: An Afterword', Dissent, 43/4 (1996), 217-52 (repr. in Intellectual Impostures, 248-58; see pp. 254-5); D.

As Alan Friedman and Carol Donley note in their Einstein as Myth and Muse (Cambridge, 1985), 140, in relativity theory the dependence of observed data on the perspective of the observer is 'determined by the relation between the reference frame of the observer and of the object, and not by the act of observation'; thus, 'Subject and object are separable in relativity; they are inextricably joined by every act of observation in quantum theory.' 24 For an example of the former, see D. George, 'Quantum Theatre-Potential Theatre: A New Paradigm', New Theatre Quarterly, 5/18 (May 1989), 171-9: 174. Cf. George's citation of Paul Davies with the original passage in Davies's popularization Other Worlds: Space, Superspace and the Quantum Universe (London, 1980), 12-13. An example of the latter can be found in P. Warrick, 'Quantum Reality in Recent Science Fiction', Extrapolation, 28 (1987), 297-309: 297.

There are a number of sources to which literary critics with little or no scientific background might turn to gain some understanding of the central concepts of quantum theory: scientists in their acquaintance, previous literary criticism involving scientific ideas, historical and philosophical accounts of quantum theory, and, in many cases, popularizations. However, there has as yet been little attempt to address which particular popularizations literary critics turn to, and how this might affect 'quantum criticism', and 'science and literature' criticism in general. A brief survey of some recently published articles provides a rough indication of literary critics' preferred popularizations of quantum theory.25 An arbitrary selection of articles reveals a large variety of source material, but it is possible to isolate some particularly well-used sources. Heisenberg's non- technical publications are prominent, as are Bohr's to a lesser degree-but these early popularizations are generally used as sources of quotations rather than scientific guides. Of contemporary popularizers, John Gribbin, Nick Herbert, Heinz Pagels, Paul Davies, and, particularly, Zukav and Capra are most commonly cited. It is interesting that these two prominent New Age popularizers are at least as popular as more 'standard' expositors. Zukav's The Dancing Wu Li Masters is especially favoured by literary critics. One critic states that 'any number of popular accounts have been published to make those implications [of quantum theory and relativity] accessible to the non- physicist', but remarks, 'Unfortunately, these accounts are of varying quality. A good starting point is Gary Zukav, The Dancing Wu Li Masters'.26 This advice would be readily understandable if the critic were writing in the early 1980s, when sources of quantum theory accessible to the layperson were few. He is, however, writing in 1990, and yet recommends Zukav's text over well- known 'mainstream' popularizations, such as those by Davies and Gribbin.27 Why, one might ask, do literary critics favour a text with twelve undisputed: 'If quantum theory is accepted, one must conclude that the world of our commonsense experience is not the only universe. Billions of others exist, some almost identical to ours, some wildly different, inhabited by near carbon-copies of ourselves.' 25 To obtain an arbitrary selection of articles, I took those listed in the MLA Bibliography on CD-ROM (WILSONDISC version 2.5.3), which covers the period Jan. 1981 to Sept. 1994, under the subject headings 'quantum theory', 'quantum mechanics', and 'quantum physics'. Of the thirty-five entries in English, I included only articles (discounting the three dissertations and one book) and discounted the two articles which I knew to be written by physicists. Of the remaining twenty-nine articles, I was able to access twenty-four. Of the writers of these articles, nine used Heisenberg as a source, eight used Zukav, six used Capra, five used Gribbin. Bohr, Pagels, and Herbert were used by four critics, Eddington, Davies, and Bertrand Russell by two. 26 M. K. Booker, 'Joyce, Planck, Einstein, and Heisenberg: A Relativistic Quantum Mechanical Discussion of Ulysses', James Joyce Quarterly, 27/3 (1990), 577-86: 577, 585. 27 Similarly, most of the citations of Zukav and Capra occur predominantly in articles written in the late 1980s and early 1990s, hence their prevalence is not due to lack of other early texts. 416</page><page sequence="7">KNOWING QUANTA 'Chapter l's,28 and which, according to one contemporary reviewer, 'sounds as if it had been written for people under the influence of soft drugs'?29 A possible explanation is the connection between the New Age and literary critical embracements of quantum theory. Both approaches oppose the reductionist, objectivist aims of Western science, and emphasize the impossibility of a one-to- one correspondence between language and reality. One critic who recommends Capra's text suggests that it is particularly suitable because 'it approaches physics as a language and compares modern physics to the teaching literatures of Japan and China-a more familiar ground for most literature students'.30 Another reason, in Zukav's case, could be the fact that he is not a physicist, and makes a point of emphasizing his identity with his non-scientific readers. He argues that people fall into 'two categories of intellectual preference'-they have either a 'scientific mental set' or a 'liberal arts mental set' (p. 23)-and he aligns himself (and implicitly his readers) with the latter: 'I hope this book will be a useful translation which will help those people who do not have a scientific mental set (like me) to understand the extraordinary process which is occurring in theoretical physics .... For better or worse, my first qualification as a translator is that, like you, I am not a physicist' (p. 24). But although Zukav's non-scientific 'mental set' is a possible factor in literary critics' favouring of his popularization, it is not always recognized as such: a number of critics are strangely unaware of the academic credentials, or lack thereof, of the popularizers they read. Andrew Ross, one of the co-editors of Social Text, assumes that Zukav is a scientist;31 Steven Carter, in a discussion of quantum mechanics and American poetry, labels him 'The physicist Gary Zukav'.32 Similarly, Susan Strehle in her Fiction in the Quantum Universe introduces mathematical physicist Davies as a 'historian of science';33 and C. A. Buckley, in a discussion of quantum theory and poetry, claims that research psychologist Lawrence LeShan, author of The Medium, the Mystic, and the Physicist, is 'a theoretical physicist'.34 28 This numbering is presumably in accordance with the philosophy of one of Zukav's sources of inspiration, T'ai Chi Master Al Huang: 'Every lesson is the first lesson' (p. 35). 29 R. Sokolov, review of The Dancing Wu Li Masters, New York Times Book Review, 17 June 1979, 18. To be fair, I should note that Sokolov applies this description only to 'some of[Zukav's] language', and admits, 'From time to time, Mr Zukav does manage to explain bona fide scientific topics with real clarity.' 30 C.

It is certainly not my intention here to support what Michael Whitworth terms 'A hierarchy ... in which the "purest" and most "accurate" popularizations are considered to be those by working scientists';35 nor do I wish to perpetuate the pedantic mining for errors in scholarship which has characterized many exchanges in the Science Wars. However, I do believe, with Sokal, that it is important for literary critics to be 'informed' with regard to their sources of scientific information. Questions of the construction of authority-in both a scientific and literary sense-of popular texts should be something of interest to literary critics, but in the recent past it seems that many critics have chosen and employed their sources uncritically. By doing so, they run the risk of unconsciously abandoning the interpretative constraints imposed by the scientific commun- ity, blurring the science-based parallels and metaphorical extrapolations of their analyses to the point of meaninglessness, and alienating the scientific community from a potentially fruitful exchange. In the remainder of this article my purpose is to explore the role of metaphor in the popularization of quantum physics using Zukav's text as a case study, and hence to indicate why popularizations need to be approached with a literary-critical eye. Metaphor, in particular anthropomorphic metaphor, has long been a staple of science popularization. Richard Boyd distinguishes between 'theory- constitutive metaphors' and those metaphors which 'might plausibly be termed exegetical or pedagogical metaphors'; the latter 'play a role in the teaching or explication of theories which already admit of entirely adequate nonmetaphorical (or, at any rate, less metaphorical) formulations'. He suggests as examples 'talk about "worm-holes" in general relativity, the description of the spatial localisation of bound electrons in terms of an "electron cloud," or the description of atoms as "miniature solar systems" .36 Boyd's examples are more accurately considered as belonging to a particular subset of metaphor: analogy. I am following here Dedre Gentner and Michael Jeziorski's definition in which 'analogies map relational structure independ- ently of object descriptions', as opposed to another subset, 'mere-appearance matches'-these 'map aspects of object descriptions without regard for 35 M. Whitworth, 'The Clothbound Universe: Popular Physics Books, 1919-1939', Publishing History, 40 (1996), 53-82: 59. On the contrary, it could be argued that the popular writings of the founders of quantum mechanics such as Heisenberg and Bohr are just as vague and open to misinterpretation as the work of contemporary non-scientist popularizers such as Zukav. Mara Beller, in her article 'The Sokal Hoax: At Whom Are We Laughing?', Physics Today, 51/9 (1998), 29-34, suggests that the real figures of ridicule in Sokal's hoax should not have been postmodernist critics but the quantum physicists whose obscure writings provide support for their claims. Given that Sokal, in the remark quoted above, groups Bohr and Heisenberg together with New Age popularizers as the producers of 'vulgarizations' which mislead non-scientists, it seems to me that he acknowledges this point to some extent. 36 R. Boyd, 'Metaphor and Theory Change: What is "Metaphor" a Metaphor For?', in A. Ortony (ed.), Metaphor and Thought (1979), 2nd edn. (Cambridge, 1996), 481-532: 485-6. 418</page><page sequence="9">KNOWING QUANTA relational structure'.37 Employing this criterion, a worm-hole is an analogy in the sense that it relies on a similarity of structural function-'something which can be tunnelled through'-rather than similarity of appearance. Inaccuracy can enter metaphorical description when an analogy is mistaken to some degree for a 'mere appearance match'-if, for example, a reader imagined the worm-hole as a three-dimensional shape in a solid earth-like material, rather than a possible feature of curved space-time which shares structural features with a hole. Gentner and Jeziorski imply this potential difficulty in their list of principles of analogical reasoning, in which they note that analogies improve with increasing 'common causal relations' within the 'base' and 'target' domains, and do not improve with other associations between the base and target, such as 'object descriptions', 'thematic connections' or causal relations.38 Analogy is particularly relevant to quantum theory owing to the non-sensory and seemingly nonsensical nature of subatomic phenomena. Consider the solar system metaphor mentioned by Boyd in the quotation above. Thomas Kuhn, writing in response to Boyd, takes issue with the claim that Bohr's solar system model is a metaphor for a system which is also established non-metaphorically- i.e. that it is translatable to a literal statement. According to Kuhn, Bohr's 'actual' model, in which the nucleus and the surrounding electrons are 'repres- ented by tiny bits of charged matter', may have replaced the solar system metaphor, 'but not, by doing so, a metaphorlike process. Bohr's atom model was intended to be taken only more-or-less literally; electrons were not thought to be exactly like small billiard or Ping-Pong balls'.39J. W. N. Sullivan in 1925 pointed out the problems experienced by expositors of the new physics who were used to employing 'pictorial' models of this kind, the standard tool of nineteenth- century popularizers: 'The method is still successful in many expositions. Thus an atom is presented as a "miniature solar system" with the result that ordinary readers have no difficulty in understanding atomic theory-provided the quantum theory is not mentioned. A way of presenting quantum theory pictorially has not yet been invented.'40 In the standard Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory developed by Bohr and Heisenberg, the question of what electrons actually are is explicitly avoided.41 Far from conforming with the classical view in which each component of reality has a one-to-one relationship with a component of scientific description, quantum theory cannot claim to refer to reality, but only to 'the results of experiments'.42 The mathematics employed in quantum 37 D.

Quantum theory thus implies a radical failure of metaphor: the metaphors popularizers employ, like the equations employed by particle physicists, are all vehicle and no tenor. Eddington suggested as much in The Nature of the Physical World: 'No familiar conceptions can be woven round the electron. . . . Something unknown is doing we don't know what-that is what our theory amounts to.' For Eddington, nonsense verse provides the most appropriate metaphorical description for the quantum domain: 'Eight slithy toves gyre and gimble in the oxygen wabe; seven in nitrogen. By admitting a few numbers even "Jabberwocky" may become scientific.' He concludes, 'It would not be a bad reminder of the essential unknownness of the fundamental entities of physics to translate it into "Jabberwocky"; provided all numbers-all metrical attributes-are unchanged, it does not suffer in the least.'43 Metaphor and analogy, then, carry a heavy load in popularizations of quantum mechanics, as in the absence of mathematics these are the only means to explain its concepts to the non-scientist, and these concepts do not always have a literal, non-mathematical interpretation. In New Age popular- izations such as Zukav's and Capra's, this burden is increased as further parallels with Eastern mysticism are introduced. A brief comparison between The Tao of Physics and The Dancing Wu Li Masters, however, indicates that the reception of an analogy can be highly dependent on the interpretative framework in which it is embedded. Capra's primary technique is what Sal Restivo has termed the 'parallelist method of juxtaposed quotations', which rests on the 'basic assumption' that 'if the rhetorical, imagery, and metaphoric content of statements on physics and mysticism is similar, the conceptual content must be similar'.44 Capra adopts a parallelist strategy on both a macro- and micro-scale. His text is divided into three sections: the first outlines the new physics, the second discusses Eastern mysticism, and the third establishes the similarities between the two world-views by explicit juxtaposition of quotations and descriptions. Capra's method is thus essentially that of simile, in that his comparisons are explicit and easily unpacked; the reader is left to judge the strength of the parallels suggested. Zukav, by contrast, tends to rely on figurative language to draw connections which he avoids stating directly. Unlike Capra, who announces in his subtitle his intention to explore 'the parallels between modern physics and Eastern mysticism', Zukav states in his introduction that his 'is not a book about physics and eastern philosophies', but rather a discussion of 'quantum physics and relativity' conducted within the 'poetic framework of Wu Li (p. 25).

His comparisons are tangled and hidden: they urge identity rather than mere likeness. His method is that of metaphor. In order to expand on these observations, I will concentrate on a section of text near the beginning of The Dancing Wu Li Masters in which Zukav figuratively establishes what I would argue is a central, though hidden, theme of his popularization: the role of human consciousness in quantum mechanics. Before looking at Zukav's text, it will be helpful to discuss briefly the place of this theme generally within quantum theory and its popularization. Although the radical re-evaluation of the observer-observed relationship implied by Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is well known, the exact nature of consciousness in the quantum mechanical measurement process has been debated by physicists and philosophers for decades. In the Copenhagen interpretation, a quantum mechanical system remains in a superposition of a number of possible states, the probabilities of which are described by a 'wave function', until a measurement is taken, at which point the wave function 'collapses' into one of these states. This collapse is triggered by the interaction of the microscopic system with macroscopic measuring instruments. 'The conscious observer', popularizer John Polkinghorne observes, 'can then take note if he wishes to do so'; the observer is integral to the system only in that she or he chooses 'the disposition' of the classical measuring instruments.45 There are obvious difficulties, however, in distinguishing between the microscopic system being measured and the macroscopic measuring system. As Davies notes, 'even Bohr conceded that [the measuring apparatus] must be subject to the minute uncertainties that are the characteristic of quantum physics. There is no clear dividing line between what is a microscopic system and what is a macroscopic measuring device.'46 This 'measurement problem' is highlighted by thought experiments such as the Schrodinger's cat and Wigner's friend paradoxes, which entail sentient creatures existing in a superposition of contradictory live/dead states until viewed by an external observer. To address these difficulties, Eugene Wigner and others suggested an interpretation of quantum theory which postulates the conscious observer in the place of the classical measuring equipment as the mechanism for the wave function collapse. Some speculative theories, such as John Wheeler's 'participatory universe', go so far as to claim that the reality of past events such as the Big Bang relies on the eventual appearance of conscious observers. The idea that consciousness has some integral role in the physical world has been dwelt upon by popularizers of quantum theory since its inception. Eddington, towards the end of The Nature of the Physical World, lists the changed understanding of consciousness due to the new physics as one of his central philosophical points: 'Recognising that the physical world is entirely 45 J. Polkinghorne, The Quantum World (1984; London, 1990), 63, 78. 46 Other Worlds, 128. 421</page><page sequence="12">ELIZABETH LEANE abstract and without "actuality" apart from its linkage with consciousness, we restore consciousness to the fundamental position instead of representing it as an inessential complication'.47 In the post-Capra period, 'quantum conscious- ness' (for want of a better term) has become the central theme of numerous popularizations.48 As Victor Stenger observes in The Unconscious Quantum, 'The popular literature abounds with this theme as paranormalists of every stripe, from psychics to astrologers to physicists to cosmologists, proclaim the oneness of the human mind and the fabric of the cosmos'.49 The philosophical implications of quantum theory are not straightforward, however, and idealist interpretations such as that proposed by Eddington are by no means universally supported. 'While there is little doubt that at the operational level [quantum] theory is a brilliant success', writes Davies, '. . . nevertheless the epistemological and metaphysical aspects of quantum physics continue to cause anxiety.'50 Many physicists believe there is an overemphasis on consciousness in some philosophical interpretations of the theory. Polkinghorne states that 'there is something very unattractive about this particular suggestion [that consciousness triggers the wave function collapse]. It is astonishingly anthropocentric.'51 Stenger's book is a vehement attack on what he terms 'the myth of quantum consciousness'. He too argues that the myth is fundamentally anthropocentric, tapping into the human unwillingness to accept post-Coper- nican peripherality.52 John Bell (the creator of 'Bell's theorem', a mathematical reformulation of the EPR paradox often used to support New Age speculations) has similarly identified 'a myth ... that quantum theory has undone somehow the Copernican revolution'. He writes that, although 'from some popular presentations the general public could get the impression that the very existence of the cosmos depends on our being here to observe the observables', he sees 'no evidence that it is so in the success of contemporary quantum theory' and thus concludes that 'it is not right to tell the public that a central role for consciousness is integrated into modern atomic physics'.53 In the following 47 p. 317. 48 Examples include F. Wolf, Mind and the New Physics (London, 1985), also published in 1984 in the United States with the title Star Wave: Mind, Consciousness, and Quantum Physics; R.

This is, of course, an eclectic mix of books which vary enormously in their approaches and claims; certainly not all of them could be considered to adopt a 'New Age' or semi-mystical approach. However, it gives an indication of the amount of public interest in 'quantum consciousness' over the last decade or so. 49 V.

'Quantum consciousness' infiltrates The Dancing Wu Li Masters while remaining largely unacknowledged on an explicit level. An early hint is provided when Zukav mentions that the person who invited him to the 'conference on physics' which inspired the book was Jack Sarfatti, 'the physicist director of the Physics/Consciousness Research Group' (p. 31); however, the reader must search fairly carefully to realize that the conference appears to have been more specifically a 'Conference on Physics and Consciousness' (p. 337 n. 5). It also requires attention to detail as well as a wider knowledge of the genre to recognize that at least four of the five physicists who 'read and commented upon the entire manuscript' are themselves interested in physics-and-consciousness issues.54 Zukav provides only one page reference, under the index entry 'Consciousness, physics and' (p. 102), despite the fact that the word 'consciousness' itself appears in a highly relevant context on at least six other occasions,55 and general discussion of the connection between 'the mind' and quantum reality occurs frequently. This lack of acknowledgement seems strange until one realizes that Zukav's argument relies on the reader absorbing rhetorical claims about quantum physics and consciousness without being presented with any explicit argument for these claims: to challenge, or even to identify, Zukav's claims, the reader must turn to literary criticism rather than scientific evidence. On a figurative level, Zukav is constantly making connections between quantum and mental phenomena. His overarching metaphor, 'the Dancing Wu Li Masters', refers, on one level, to physicists, or rather to a particular group of physicists who, unlike mere 'technicians', seek 'the true nature of physical reality' and deal with 'the unknown'-those who have reached a degree of enlightenment about their subject comparable to that of an Eastern 54 Zukav lists these names in his acknowledgements (p. 7). Sarfatti, as already noted, is the director of a physics/consciousness research group. Henry Stapp has written a popularization dealing with quantum physics and consciousness (see n. 48 above). David Finkelstein attended the same conference on physics and consciousness as Zukav and Sarfatti. Brian Josephson, along with V. S. Ramachandran, has edited the proceedings of an interdisciplinary symposium on consciousness (University of Cambridge, Jan. 1978) entitled Consciousness and the Physical World (Oxford, 1980) and is interested in both Eastern philosophy and psychic phenomena. 55 In the first uncited example Zukav cites parallel quotations from Carl Jung and Wolfgang Pauli and concludes that 'If these men are correct, then physics is the study of the structure of consciousness' (p. 56); in the second he states that 'Some physicists, like E. H. Walker, speculate that photons may be conscious!' and quotes Walker's belief that 'Consciousness may be associated with all quantum mechanical phenomena' (p. 88; original emphasis); in the third he explains the contrasting roles of consciousness in the Copenhagen and many worlds interpretations (p. 107); in the fourth, he claims that 'there is speculation, and some evidence, that consciousness, at the most fundamental levels, is a quantum process' (p. 240; original emphasis); in the fifth he explains that 'Bohr's principle of complementarity . . . addresses the underlying relation of physics to consciousness' (p. 323); in the sixth he suggests 'A new instrument of thought such as is needed to understand Bohm's physics . . . would radically alter the consciousness of the observer, reorientating it toward a perception of the "unbroken wholeness" of which everything is a form' (p. 326). There is no apparent reason why these references to consciousness are not cited in the index. 423</page><page sequence="14">ELIZABETH LEANE Master (pp. 36, 42). Einstein, we are told, 'was perhaps a Wu Li Master' (p. 35). Zukav introduces the 'dance' metaphor by stating that a Wu Li Master 'dances with his student'; he knows that he is not explaining the world but rather 'dancing' with it (p. 35).56 From this point on, this metaphor appears variously and frequently. It is often used, in a sense reminiscent of Yeats,57 to indicate that participators are inextricably part of and defined by the system in which they participate: 'The Wu Li Masters move in the midst of all this, now dancing this way, now that ... Now they become the dance, now the dance becomes them' (p. 43); 'At the subatomic level the dancer and the dance are one' (p. 212). But Zukav also employs the dance metaphor more specifically to describe the movements of physical entities: 'Waves are playful creatures that like to do dances of their own' (p. 82); 'Subatomic particles forever partake of this unceasing dance of annihilation and creation. In fact, subatomic particles are this unceasing dance of annihilation and creation' (p. 235; original emphasis). Thus, as the text progresses, the dance becomes a metaphor for the interaction of subatomic particles, and in a wider sense, all matter/energy, as well as for the relationship between physicists and their research.58 The dance describes both the intellectual processes of physicists and the continuous interaction of subatomic particles, thus establishing a connection between consciousness (the physicists' minds) and quantum phenomena. This connec- tion is reinforced by further metaphors and loaded adjectives: the philo- sophical implications of quantum mechanics are termed 'psychedelic' (p. 35); 'imagination' is described as 'physics come alive' (p. 35); the description of subatomic particles as an unceasing dance quoted above is followed by a claim that 'Hindu mythology is virtually a large-scale projection into the psycho- logical realm of microscopic scientific discoveries' (p. 235). In the next chapter (that is, the first 'Chapter 1' of the second 'Part 1'), Zukav effectively establishes consciousness as a central theme of his text. At the seminal points of this chapter Zukav relies very little on scientific evidence or authority, but rather persuades by means of an explicit anthropomorphic argument implicitly reinforced by anthropomorphic metaphor. The basic 56 The masculine pronoun is employed here in line with Zukav's usage. 57 'O body swayed to music, 0 brightening glance, I How can we know the dancer from the dance?': 'Among School Children', 11. 63-4, in Collected Poems (1931), rev. edn. (London, 1990), 242-5. 58 Zukav's application of the metaphor to modem particle physics is not new: four years before The Dancing Wu Li Masters was published, Capra had extensively discussed the Eastern origin of this metaphor and applied it directly to quantum theory: a major theme of The Tao of Physics is the way in which the interaction of particles can be represented as a ceaseless dance, which parallels the Dance of Shiva, the Hindu Lord of the Dancers (preface, ch. 15). This precedent is unacknowledged by Zukav (who mentions Capra's text only in two obscure and unindexed footnote references). Moreover, while Zukav emphasizes that the notion of a 'cosmic dance' of annihilation and creation has an ancient tradition in Eastern culture, he fails to mention that this metaphor also has a long tradition in the West. According to Alan Brissenden's Shakespeare and the Dance (London, 1991), not only is the notion of a cosmic dance an ancient one in Western culture, but also the concept of a dance of atoms has been established since at least the second century (p. 3). 424</page><page sequence="15">KNOWING QUANTA rhetorical structure of his argument centres on the term 'Wu Li'. One of the possible interpretations of 'Wu Li' is 'patterns of organic energy', and Zukav employs this metaphor as the title of his second 'Part 1'. The first chapter of this section is aptly entitled 'Living'. Zukav's initial rhetorical strategy in this chapter is to provide his own idiosyncratic interpretation of the relationship between 'organic energy' and quantum physics: When we talk of physics as patterns of organic energy, the word that catches our attention is 'organic'. Organic means living. Most people think that physics is about things that are not living, such as pendulums and billiard balls. This is a common point of view, even among physicists, but it is not as evident as it may seem. (p. 70) Zukav has earlier introduced his readers to the New Age buzz-word 'organic', noting that the participants at the physics conference he attended at Big Sur ate 'organic food' (p. 31). In the paragraph above, his definition-'Organic means living'-is a simplification of the usage favoured by New Age devotees and popularizers such as Capra,59 in which 'organic' generally means 'Belong- ing to or inherent in the organization or constitution (bodily or mental) of a living being' and 'characterized by systematic connexion or coordination of parts in one whole'.60 Zukav goes on to develop his definition via an imaginary dialogue with a hypothetical person, Jim de Wit, 'the perpetual champion of the non-obvious' (p. 70). Jim's argument (pp. 70-2) is anthropomorphic and, paradoxically for a text which promotes organicism and holism, highly reductionist. Jim asserts that it is impossible to 'say with certainty' that apparently inanimate entities such as chemicals do not process and respond to information in the same way humans do: 'Under the right conditions, for example, sodium reacts to chlorine (by forming sodium chloride-salt), iron reacts to oxygen (by forming iron oxides-rust), and so on, just as humans react to food when they are hungry and affection when they are lonely.' When 'we' (layman Zukav and his reader) reply that 'it hardly seems fair to compare a chemical reaction to a human reaction', Jim counters that we do not know that 'our responses are not as rigidly preprogrammed as those of a chemical, with the only difference being that our programs are enormously more complex'. Thus if we do not consider inanimate matter such as stones to be organic, we cannot consider ourselves organic, and thus cannot consider ourselves alive. 'Since this is absurd', concludes Zukav, 'the only alternative is to admit that "inanimate" objects may be living'. The reductionist strategy here is clear: if human (organic) reactions are simply a complex arrangement of chemical reactions, there can be no difference between the properties of the two, and chemicals must therefore be organic (in Zukav's sense) also. 59 Tao of Physics, 23: 'In contrast to the mechanistic Western view, the Eastern view of the world is "organic" .. . The cosmos is seen as one inseparable reality-for ever in motion, alive, organic; spiritual and material at the same time'. 60 OED, 2nd edn., CD-ROM. 425</page><page sequence="16">ELIZABETH LEANE Nevertheless, drawing on this argument, Zukav asserts: The distinction between organic and inorganic is a conceptual prejudice. It becomes even harder to maintain as we advance into quantum mechanics. Something is organic, according to our definition, if it can respond to processed information. The astounding discovery awaiting newcomers to physics is that the evidence gathered in the development of quantum mechanics indicates that subatomic 'particles' constantly appear to be making decisions! (p. 72) No doubt many cognitive scientists would take issue with Zukav's extended definition of 'organic' (in other words, 'living') as something which 'can respond to processed information'-by this definition, an electronic auto-bank is certainly a living creature; so is every computer, in fact. This loose definition allows Zukav to claim for subatomic particles a talent usually reserved for conscious beings: the ability to make decisions. In the discussion that ensues, the qualifying 'appears' eventually disappears, and the anthropomorphic logic is reinforced by the use of the word 'know': subatomic 'particles' constantly appear to be making decisions! More than that, the decisions they seem to make are based on decisions made elsewhere. Subatomic particles seem to know instantaneously what decisions are made elsewhere, and elsewhere can be as far away as another galaxy! The key word is instantaneously. How can a subatomic particle over here know what decision another particle over there has made at the same time the particle over there makes it? All evidence belies the fact that quantum particles are actually particles. ... [Instantaneous communication] means that 'particles' may not be particles at all... It also means that these apparent particles are related with other particles in a dynamic and intimate way that coincides with our definition of organic. (p. 72; original emphasis) Zukav seems poised here to introduce the wave-particle duality; and indeed, a few paragraphs later he announces, 'To understand these decisions and what makes them, let us start with a discovery made in 1900 by Max Planck' (p. 73). If we were to interpret literally Zukav's earlier claim that particles make, or appear to make, decisions, the answer to 'what makes them?' would simply be 'the particles'; thus this sentence suggests the first claim was merely meta- phorical. Nonetheless, in the remaining part of the chapter Zukav does not return explicitly to the idea of decision-making by particles, and in fact again encourages the concretization of this metaphor by stating excitedly that 'Some physicists . . . speculate that photons may be conscious!' (p. 88; original emphasis). The scientific evidence cited to support this is slim-one quotation from E. H. Walker, who is the leading theoretician of 'paraphysics' (the attempt to use physics to support parapsychology),61 although Zukav fails to mention this detail to his reader. However, to the lay reader the idea of 'conscious' subatomic entities may not seem in need of much supporting evidence, as it is an assumption that has been implicit in Zukav's anthropo- morphic language since the beginning of the chapter. 61 M. Gardner, The New Age: Notes of a Fringe Watcher (Buffalo, NY, 1988), 111. 426</page><page sequence="17">KNOWING QUANTA It might be argued here that the kind of anthropomorphic slippage of which I am accusing Zukav is ubiquitous and indispensable in science popularization. It is certainly true that in some cases, anthropomorphic metaphors have developed into rhetorical conventions, accepted and employed by a large number of popularizers. For example, the word 'know' is often employed as a convenient metaphorical shorthand to describe seemingly inexplicable inter- actions between an object and its environment. Davies uses this device in his discussion of the double slit experiment: 'How does any electron know what the other electrons, maybe in other parts of the world, are going to do?'62 Gribbin employs similar language: 'The electrons not only know whether or not both holes are open, they know whether or not we are watching them, and adjust their behaviour accordingly.'63 Feynman asks how a photon '"makes up its mind" whether it should go to A or B'.64 I would argue, however, that while in these examples from Feynman, Davies, and Gribbin, the figurative language is relatively stable, this is not the case with Zukav's anthropomorphism. The question of whether a particular use of metaphor is likely to produce unpredictable interpretations centres on a recognition of the importance of context. This is a point which Gillian Beer has emphasized in her readings of Darwin's Origin of Species and elsewhere. In Open Fields she argues that while both literature and scientific writing are multi- vocal, there is an accepted difference in the way these two discourses are received: 'professional scientific writing has to rely on tacit agreements with a projected readership to a degree that literature evades, and ... the shifting of linguistic levels has notably different functions in literary and in scientific communication'; in other words, 'Not what is said, but the agreement as to constraints on its reception, will stabilize scientific discourse.'65 Darwin, in defending his use of the anthropomorphic term 'natural selection', insisted that while 'In the literal sense of the word, no doubt, natural selection is a misnomer', nevertheless 'Everyone knows what is meant and is implied by such metaphorical expressions; and they are most necessary for brevity'.66 Beer explains: 'The problem, of course, was that every one did not know what was meant by natural selection-the term was a neologism and therefore stood forth with full metaphorical expressiveness and personifying power.' This statement is underpinned by her earlier observation that Darwin's text was addressed not only to his scientific colleagues, but also to a general readership which inevitably 'dissolved the limits of words familiar in a natural-historical context'.67 62 Other Worlds, 66. 63 J. Gribbin, In Search of Schrodinger's Cat: Quantum Physics and Reality (1984; London, 1991), 171. 64 R. Feynman, QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter (1985; London, 1990), 18. 65 G.

Beer notes that anthropomorphism, in particular, is essentially impossible to purge from any discourse because 'language is anthropocentric' and 'language always includes agency, and agency and intention are frequently impossible to distinguish in language'.69 This inbuilt anthropomorphism and intentionality of language is not necessarily always a negative, constraining force. In the case of Darwin, Beer argues that the 'multi-vocal nature of metaphor' was also an enabling device, allowing him to suggest ideas-about kinship, for example-in a non-explicit manner. For Beer, the question which follows is whether 'the sub-text of The Origin [is] simply unavoidably full of human reference (because cast in human language) or is it knowingly, even strategically, so? And if so, to what ends?'70 A popularizer's pedagogical use of the term 'know' applied to an electron is stable, I would argue, if it has no particular resonance with the broader claims presented in the text. Zukav's use of anthropomorphic metaphor, by contrast, is both knowing and strategic: it resonates with the broader metaphorical connection between quantum phenomena and human consciousness. The result is that the 'expressiveness and personifying power' of these metaphors is amplified by potential philosophical implications, rather than damped by scientific constraint. This interpretation is strengthened by the fact that Zukav clearly connects the 'organic', or 'living', nature of subatomic particles with an anthropocentric world-view, the world-view which Stenger and others believe lies behind 'quantum consciousness' arguments. Near the end of the chapter in which Jim de Wit presents his argument, the following summary is given: This brings us back to where we started: Something is 'organic' if it has the ability to process information and to act accordingly. We have little choice but to acknowledge that photons, which are energy, do appear to process information and to act accordingly, and that therefore, strange as it may sound, they seem to be organic. Since we are also organic, there is a possibility that by studying photons (and other energy quanta) we may learn something about us. (p. 88) It is clear where this argument is leading: towards the claim that unlike classical science, which decentres humans and reduces them to the sum of inanimate parts, the 'organic' physics of quantum mechanics might resurrect them to new importance. Sure enough, Zukav begins the next chapter by recounting the beliefs held by humanity 'In the days before Copernicus': the belief that the earth was the centre of the universe, and, in India, the belief that 69 Darwin's Plots, 53. 70 Ibid. 61, 62. 428 68 Open Fields, 160.</page><page sequence="19">KNOWING QUANTA 'each person, psychologically speaking' was the centre of the universe. Zukav argues that this belief is not egotistical, as it applies to every person. It would be difficult, however, to argue that this is not an anthropocentric position. He goes on to assert that the new physics-relativity and quantum mechanics-is the site of the re-emergence of'an ancient paradigm': 'In vague form, we begin to glimpse a conceptual framework in which each of us shares a paternity in the creation of physical reality. Our old self-image as impotent bystander, one who sees but does not affect, is dissolving' (p. 114). Here Zukav is employing the first person plural voice, as he often does, to produce the effect of identifica- tion with the reader. Over the next page or so, this identification becomes more significant as Zukav decries the alienating and decentralizing effects of the work of 'the Scientists' on 'us'-lay people like the reader and himself-whom he places in direct opposition to 'the Scientists'. Zukav's language takes on a lyrical quality as he announces humanity's reversal of fortune: 'Amid the powerful purr of particle accelerators, the click of computer printouts, and dancing instrument gauges, the old "science" that has given us so much, including our sense of helplessness before the faceless forces of bigness, is undermining its own foundations.' For Zukav, 'the faceless forces of bigness' refers not only to the indifferent workings of the post-Copernican universe, but also to the esoteric proceedings of science itself. He goes on to proclaim the good news of centrality regained: We have tried to [disown our part in the universe] by relinquishing our authority to the Scientists. To the Scientists we gave the responsibility of probing the mysteries of creation, change, and death. To us we gave the everyday routine of mindless living. The Scientists readily assumed their task. We readily assumed ours, which was to play a role of impotence before the ever-increasing complexity of 'modern science' and the ever-spreading specialization of modem technology. Now, after three centuries, the Scientists have returned with their discoveries. They are as perplexed as we are.... 'We are not sure,' they tell us, 'but we have accumulated evidence which indicates that the key to understanding the universe is you.' This is not only different from the way that we have looked at the world for three hundred years, it is opposite. (p. 115; original emphasis) There is a definite note here of triumphant 'We told you so!': the resentment of'literary' types (Zukav and his reader) of the scientists' monopoly on the 'big questions' has turned into delight due to this apparent reversal. But this reversal is achieved only through a blatantly anthropocentric presentation of the implications of the embeddedness of the observer in quantum mechanics. And when the kind of anthropomorphic language described above is combined with this anthropocentric philosophy, a space is opened for the reader to embrace the 'full metaphorical expressiveness' of the language, and for 'secondary' meanings of metaphors to become concretized and used as an integral feature of this philosophy. When lay readers later come to Zukav's claim that 'there is speculation, and some evidence, that consciousness, at the 429</page><page sequence="20">ELIZABETH LEANE most fundamental levels, is a quantum process' (p. 240; original emphasis), it would be close to impossible for them not to approach this idea with a perspective unaffected by his anthropomorphic language. Whether or not quantum physics does explain consciousness, whether or not photons are conscious, is not the issue; the point is that Zukav's exposition of scientific ideas rests on the persuasiveness of his anthropomorphism. One important feature of Zukav's rhetorical strategy is that it defies Gentner and Jeziorski's stipulation that 'Analogy is not causation'. Zukav supports a causal argument with an argument based on analogy: quantum phenomena are metaphorically given the characteristics of consciousness, and are then presented as the cause of consciousness's new central role, if not consciousness itself. Analogy-association based on structural similarities-is combined with metonymy-association based (in this case) on cause and effect. The result is a rhetorical sleight of hand that confuses, rather than clarifies, the argument presented. This explains to some extent the difficulties experienced by literary critics relying on Zukav. Dennis Bohnenkamp, for example, during a discussion of modern physics and the work of Joyce, announces confidently, without any qualifications, that 'One of the mysterious findings of quantum physics is that matter is not inert or dead, but like objects in the epiphany reveals distinct signs of life.'71 The conflation of metaphor and metonymy that I have identified in The Dancing Wu Li Masters can be applied to other pedagogical metaphors in science writing. Consider Richard Dawkins's famous 'selfish gene' metaphor. Beer notes that Steven Rose, Leon Kamin, and R. C. Lewontin have identified this kind of endowment of human characteristics upon non-human entities as a product of the 'translation' problems which tend to occur when one moves between, rather than within, 'levels' of scientific discourse: 'Genes cannot be selfish or angry or spiteful or homosexual, as these are attributes of wholes much more complex than genes: human organisms.'72 But isn't 'confusion over levels' exactly what metaphor is built upon? A metaphor gains its power not merely from likeness but also apparent unlikeness. As Stephen Jay Gould notes, in attributing 'conscious action to genes', Dawkins is 'only perpetuating, albeit more colourfully than most, a metaphorical shorthand used (perhaps unwisely) by all popular writers on evolution'.73 The problem here is not confusion over levels but rather confusion between likeness and causality. To label genes 'selfish' because they behave in a way similar to selfish humans, and then to argue that genes are the cause of innate selfishness in animals such as humans, is rhetorically to beg the question. As with Zukav's decision-making particles, it is not that the original metaphor is not useful pedagogically, but 71 'Post-Einsteinian Physics', 24. 72 S. Rose, L. Kamin, and R. Lewontin, Not in our Genes: Biology, Ideology and Human Nature (Harmondsworth, 1984), 278, quoted in Beer, Open Fields, 159-60. 73 S. Gould, The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History (1980; Harmondsworth, 1983), 76. 430</page><page sequence="21">KNOWING QUANTA rather that in the context of the overall argument it takes on a strategic role which both encourages and depends upon its concretization. Putting scare quotes around metaphors does not automatically pre-empt such criticism when they are so deeply and strategically embedded in the text's structure. Throughout this analysis I have tended to present the ambiguities of meaning generated by metaphor in a negative light, as sources of distortion or confusion. However, as I discussed earlier, metaphorical multi-vocality is also an enabling device: the fact that it allows Zukav to present speculative ideas without making overt claims should perhaps be considered negative only if it goes unacknowledged. Ambiguity does not always entail distortion, and can be a means by which meaning is renewed and reinterpreted in a useful sense. As Beer observes, the shift in meaning which occurs when scientific terms are placed in a wider context 'is not a matter of careless or ignorant reading by those outside the technical argument (though it may sometimes also be that); it is that the insurgency of signification, the perception of fresh relations, is inherent to all language'.74 The question of whether 'insurgency of signification' should be considered a fruitful or confusing process in literary analyses which employ quantum-mechanical notions reflects back on the question of the function of analogies between literature and science. If critics are implicitly employing science to lend authenticity to their conclusions about literature, then the authenticity of their sources is paramount. If their framework is more sophisticated in the manner of Hayles's cultural matrices, then the issues are more complex, but accuracy and disciplinary respect remain important. I do not wish to suggest that literary critics accept only those popularizers, or those statements, approved by the scientific community, and ignore anything speculative, idiosyncratic, or unusual. I do, however, suggest that they should show a contextual awareness of how the rhetorical construc- tion of a particular popularization situates it with respect to the body of knowledge developed by the scientific community. Only then will literary critics be able to achieve the degree of finely nuanced argument that will render their analyses meaningful, not only within the community of 'science and literature' scholars, but within a broad, multidisciplinary academic sphere.
