Ancestry as a pole made up of the opposition of a The exclusion of culture in defining ethnic groups has valued heritage versus a nonvalued one. Originally, this long been a critique addressed to Barth (see Dormon meant, in addition to American birth, French or Spanish 1980). In fact, what Barth rejected was the assumption heritage versus non-Latin roots which included African that ethnic traits were necessarily objective cultural as well as American ancestry; now, the importance of traits; instead he advocated that the focus be placed on Latin ancestry must be assessed within the context of the subjective evaluations of objective cultural content ‘‘American’’ ancestry in a manner similar to Alba’s that people use to define and characterize ethnic groups.
