<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Paterson THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE AS TRAGEDY S A MAN OF ms time and place, Thomas Hardy was ill-equipped . to meet the challenge of tragedy in its traditional form. Although ' the romantic and scientific humanisms to which his expatriation in London had exposed him did not exclude a tragic vision of human experience, they were incompetent, by their denial of moral and re- ligious universals, to provide that framework of theme and form which could alone make peace with a tragic vision. Hence the maimed achieve- ments of The Return of the Native and Jude the Obscure. In the absence of a justice, an ethical substance, which is beyond man's power to shape or control but to which, at the same time, he is necessarily responsible, the disasters in which these works culminate are deprived of a moral and hence fully tragic significance. Celebrating the human at the ex- pense of the superhuman, they cannot justify the ways of God to man. Hardy was not, however, exclusively or even primarily a man of his century. As the citizen of a provincial Dorset which had had no news of Swinburne and Darwin, he inherited a traditional moral wisdom not yet damaged by the romantic and scientific inspirations which were DECEMBER 1959</page><page sequence="2">John Paterson everywhere shaking the confidence of the modern imagination. In Far From the Madding Crowd and The Woodlanders, for example, he could magnify not the romantic agonies of those condemned, like the Eustacias and the Judes, to live in a world without justice or dignity but the modest pieties of the Oaks and the Winterbornes, their decent adoration of a Nature that was still a mystery and a miracle, still the earnest of a moral consciousness in the universe. Their diabolical an- tagonists, the Sergeant Troys and Dr. Fitzpiers, invite in fact not the fatuous indulgence of the romantic imagination but the horror and dis- gust of the medieval imagination in the presence of Dr. Faust. Even in The Return of the Native, the "tragic" apotheosis in death of the re- bellious Eustacia Vye is criticized retroactively by the comic apotheosis in marriage of Diggory Venn and Thomasin Yeobright' who have, like the Oaks and the Winterbornes, come to terms with central headquar- ters. As the beneficiary of a pre-nineteenth-century culture whose primitive decencies neither Swinburne nor Darwin had entirely con- founded, Hardy's imagination could still be possessed, evidently, by what Keats has nostalgically called "our deep eternal theme," by "the fierce dispute, / Betwixt damnation and impassioned clay" that author- izes the form and substance of traditional tragedy. Hence the lonely and peculiar significance in the literature of modern times of The Mayor of Casterbridge. Temporarily freed from the disabling humanistic biases of his age, exploiting a level of the mind to which his romantic sympathies and naturalistic assumptions could not penetrate, Hardy here assumes what the literature of tragedy after Shakespeare has not found it easy or possible to assume: the existence of a moral order, an ethical substance, a standard of justice and recti- tude, in terms of which man's experience can be rendered as the drama of his salvation as well as the drama of his damnation. Reviving a body of beliefs about man and fate, nature and society, that were once the ordinary possession of the Western imagination, he exploits a wisdom that makes possible the achievement of tragedy in the heroical sense of a Sophocles or a Shakespeare. 1 As Hardy was himself to confess in the celebrated footnote on p. 473 of the British Wessex edition ( 1912), he was forced, by editorial pressure and the necessities of serial publication, to provide for a happy ending. The allegedly extraneous sixth book of The Return of the Native is less inapposite, however, than Hardy and some of his critics would lead one to believe. His attitude to Eustacia's romantic revolt, to the extraor- dinary and the tragic in human experience, is not after all wholly uncritical. Hence the celebration of the ordinary and the comic in human experience which is the do- mesticating effect of the sixth book is not altogether foreign to the novel as originally con- ceived. The implications of his footnote notwithstanding, in other words, Hardy in effect converted editorial necessity into artistic virtue. VICTORIAN STUDIES 152</page><page sequence="3">THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE AS TRAGEDY I The traditional basis of The Mayor of Casterbridge as tragedy emerges at once in the plainly fabulous or hyperbolical quality of its first episode. Discouraged by his failure to get on in the world and impatient of ordinary domestic restraints, Michael Henchard, the jour- neyman haytrusser, arrives at the fair at Weydon-Priors, steeps himself in the alcoholic brews of the furmity-woman, and in a drunken moment sells his wife to a sailor for five guineas. Clearly calculated to startle the imagination, to appeal to its sense for the grand and the heroic in human experience, Henchard's act of violence bears the same relation to the novel as the betrayal of Cordelia and the murder of Laius to Lear and Oedipus.2 Arousing such forces of retribution as will not be satis- fied with less than the total humiliation of the offender and the ultimate restoration of the order offended, it will come to represent, like its counterpart in Lear and Oedipus, the violation of a moral scheme more than human in its implications. That such is indeed its significance is underlined by its dramatic isolation in the structure of the novel, by the fact that twenty years in- tervene between the shocking event that commands the attention of the first two chapters and the events of the chapters that follow. For the primary effect of this structural peculiarity is to dramatize the causal relation between Henchard's crime and punishment. Recording the re- morseless private and public deterioration of the protagonist, the novel enacts the indignation of the moral order whose serenity his act of im- piety has violently affronted. Forsaken by Farfrae, blasted by the dis- closure that Elizabeth-Jane is not his daughter, and deprived of the love and loyalty of Lucetta; humiliated by the revelations of the furmity- woman and ruined in a trade war with his Scottish antagonist; crushed by his public rebuke on the occasion of the Royal Visit, rejected by the "daughter" whose affection had consoled him in defeat, and reduced in the end to the starkest of deaths, Henchard will be forced, like Oedipus and Faust and Lear, to rediscover in suffering and sorrow the actuality of the moral power he had so recklessly flouted. The actuality of this power is otherwise expressed in the in- exorability with which the guilty past asserts, as in Hamlet and 2 D. A. Dike has explored some of the analogies between The Mayor of Casterbridge and Oedipus Rex in his "A Modern Oedipus: The Mayor of Casterbridge," Essays in Criticism, II (g952), 169-179. DECEMBER 1959 153</page><page sequence="4">John Paterson Oedipus, its claim to recognition and atonement. The series of fatal re- appearances that challenges and undermines Henchard's illegitimate power-i.e., Lucetta's, the furmity-woman's, Newson's as well, of course, as Susan Henchard's ("Mrs. Henchard was so pale that the boys called her 'The Ghost'" [pp. 94-95] )3 - schematizes the determined re- venge of a supernatural authority for which a wrong left uncorrected and unpunished is intolerable. This sinister theme is early adumbrated in the mayor's proud refusal to make restitution for the damaged wheat he has sold to the community. "But what are you going to do to repay us for the past?" an indignant townsman challenges him from the street. "If anybody will tell me how to turn grown wheat into wholesome wheat," the arrogant man replies with an irony of which he is, in the pride of his office, tragically unconscious, "I'll take it back with pleasure. But it can't be done" (p. 41). Henchard thus defines in allegorical terms the conditions of his crime and punishment, his answer pointing up not only the irrevocability of that other and profounder crime buried in his past but also the uncanny pertinacity with which it will return, as the agent of a wounded moral intelligence, to haunt and destroy his life. The authenticity of a moral intelligence beyond man's power to control is verified in the heroic imagination of Henchard himself. For it is the measure of his grandeur, the measure of his dissociation from such mere victims of naturalistic or unconscious force as Tess and Jude and Eustacia, that he should acknowledge from the very beginning the extra-human and specifically moral agency of the opposition that has set itself against him. On the morning after the sale of his wife, for ex- ample, he seeks as it were to propitiate the offended powers by present- ing himself in the local church and swearing to give up drinking for twenty years. He will come to feel, as disaster overwhelms him, "that some power [is] working against him" (p. 219), that he has fully de- served the opposition of a "sinister intelligence bent on punishing him" (p. 144). His recognition of a justice beyond his power to control will be solemnized, finally, not only in the great words with which he leaves Casterbridge4 but also in the heroic self-condemnation of his last will and testament (p. 384). The universality of Henchard's experience is guaranteed by its 3 All page references will be to Harper's "Modern Classics" edition (1922) which is more easily accessible than the definitive Wessex edition.

But my punishment is not greater than I can bear!" (p. 361). VICTORIAN STUDIES 154</page><page sequence="5">THE MAYOR OF CASTERBBIDGE AS TRAGEDY reenactment in the story of Lucetta La Sueur. For one thing, she has sought, in the wilful and impious fashion of the mayor himself, to dis- sociate herself from the past: "my ancestors in Jersey," she says de- fensively, "were as good as anybody in England.... I went back and lived there after my father's death. But I don't value such past mat- ters .. ." (p. 173).5 More to the point, however, in having lived in sin with Henchard in Jersey, she too has been guilty of a moral indiscretion in the past. Indeed, in rejecting her old lover and electing to marry Farfrae, she has refused, once again like her more heroic male counter- part, to recognize and make restitution for her crime. "I won't be a slave to the past - ," she cries pathetically, when the demoniacal Henchard seeks forcibly to legalize their old association, "I'll love where I choosel" (p. 204). At the very moment, however, when her love-letters have been burned and she thinks herself free from the consequences of her de- linquency, she hears the sounds of the skimmington ride which will publish her shame and eventually bring about her death. Her melo- dramatic and middle-class reenactment of Henchard's authentic moral drama bears witness, like Gloucester's prose reenactment of Lear's crime and punishment, to the reality of an order whose indignation, once provoked, can neither be appeased nor controlled. Henchard's terrible retrogression obeys, certainly, a law so dis- tinct and irrefutable in its logic as to suggest an origin more supernatural than natural. Reduced to the humble trade with which he began, dis- carding the shabby-genteel suit of cloth and the rusty silk hat which had been the emblems of his illegitimate power, taking again to the drink he had twenty years before repudiated, leaving Casterbridge exactly as he had entered it, revisiting Weydon-Priors, the scene of the original crime, and dying at last, broken in body and spirit, on the barren wastes of Egdon Heath, Henchard travels with every stage of his decline and fall the long road by which he had come, embraces with every step the past he had denied, and rediscovers, like Lear, in the conditions of his going out the conditions of his setting forth. Having, as Tess and Jude have not, exchanged his humanity for worldly power and prestige, he is systematically deprived of that for which he had exchanged his human- 5 Her irreligious disrespect for the past is more indirectly suggested in her frivolous description of its trophies in the local museum: "there are crowds of interesting things," she tells Elizabeth without conviction, "skeletons, teeth, old pots and pans, ancient boots and shoes, birds' eggs - all charmingly instructive" (p. 178). Her careless im- piety has in fact been underscored by the piety in death of her rival and foil, for Susan Henchard's dust has been said to mingle "with the dust of women who lay ornamented with glass hair-pins and amber necklaces, and men who held in their mouths coins of Hadrian, Posthumus, and the Constantines" (p. 153). DECEMBER 1959 155</page><page sequence="6">John Paterson ity. Guilty, in a sense that Tess and Jude are not, of pride offensive to the gods, his suffering and death acquire a value to which theirs cannot quite lay claim. The fate that presides over Henchard's destruction as the witness of a moral intention in the universe is hardly interchangeable, indeed, with the vulgar and even brutish fate that presides, either as crass casualty or as unwitting opposition, over the destruction of the Tesses and the Judes and the Eustacias.6 In its mysterious remoteness and refinement, fate in The Mayor of Casterbridge has much in common with Hegel's sublime and in- destructible "ethical substance." The conflict upon which the novel is founded does not suggest, after all, the grotesquely unequal contest between good and evil in which a malevolent "superhumanity" tri- umphs, as in Tess and Jude and to a certain extent in The Return of the Native, over an innocent and helpless humanity. It suggests, rather, the more equal, the more ambiguous, conflict that occurs when, to the dis- comfiture of a supernatural wisdom within whose bounds all merely natural oppositions are absorbed and reconciled, one great good is asserted at the expense of another. In this context, the conditions of Henchard's heroic grandeur - his pride, his passion, his ambition - are exactly the conditions of his downfall and destruction. They invite the correction of that absolute wisdom for which the more modest human- ity of Elizabeth-Jane and Donald Farfrae is equally sympathetic. Thus while Henchard stands for the grandeur of the human pas- sions, for the heroism of spirit that prefers the dangerous satisfactions of the superhuman to the mild comforts of the merely human, Farfrae and Elizabeth stand for the claims of reason and thought, for the spirit of moderation that is prepared to come to terms with merely human 6 The critical consensus would have it that fate for Hardy was always synonymous either with a perverse and even wilful Chance or with an exclusively social or natural Ne- cessity. His weakness as a tragedian, Arthur Mizener believes, inheres in his natural- istic assumption "that there can be only one kind of reality . . ." ("Jude the Obscure as a Tragedy," Southern Review, VI [1940], 202). Presupposing that "the nature of inanimate things is unconscious and undesigning," Hardy sees events, writes Jacques Barzun, as "chance collidings of willful and indifferent forces among themselves . . ." ("Truth and Poetry in Thomas Hardy," Southern Review, VI [1940], 184). Generaliza- tions appropriate for Tess and Jude, however, meet in the case of The Mayor of Caster- bridge with unexpectedly stiff resistance. Assuming as it does more than "one kind of reality," its events suggesting not so much "chance collidings of willful and indifferent forces" as a logic or pattern beyond man's power to control and even to understand, The Mayor of Casterbridge can fairly be called a lusus naturae. It may be objected that the novel is unique only insofar as the hero's character creates the events leading to his downfall. In the last analysis, however, these events follow a logic, a pattern, in which the hero as character may participate but for which he himself is not finally responsible. The logic or the pattern acquires a reality of its own independent of the hero's particular contribution. As in much Shakespearean tragedy, in other words, character itself becomes a part or instrument of that general fate which presides, on behalf of a supernature, over the course of human affairs.

Elizabeth-Jane's Cordelia is said to feel "none of those ups and downs of spirit which beset so many people without cause; . . . never a gloom in [her] soul but she well knew how it came there ..." (p. 1oo). Her would-be father, on the other hand, his morale destroyed by his crime, is victimized by mysterious and rebellious depressions which he can neither understand nor control. With her "field-mouse fear of the coulter of destiny," Elizabeth declines to adorn herself in the pomp and pride of fine clothing: "I won't be too gay on any ac- count. It would be tempting Providence to hurl mother and me down . . ." (p. o10). With his leonine pride and contempt of Fortune, on the other hand, Henchard makes love to his own destruction, affecting in his first appearance as chief magistrate "an old-fashioned evening suit, an expanse of frilled shirt. .. ; jewelled studs, and a heavy gold chain" (P. 37). Again, if Henchard suggests the passionate extremities of King Oedipus, Farfrae suggests the less spectacular appeal to reason and compromise for which Creon stands. "In my business, 'tis true that strength and bustle build up a firm," says the mayor, unconsciously al- legorizing the terms of their opposition as well as the basis of his own failure: "But judgment and knowledge are what keep it established. Unluckily, I am bad at science, Farfrae; bad at figures - a rule o' thumb sort of man. You are just the reverse . .." (p. 55 ).7 The conflict between the passion of the one and the reason of the other is thus dramatized as a conflict between the rugged individualist and the organization man, between primitive and modern ways of doing business. In his victory over Henchard's gallant but corrupt and self-defeating Mark Antony, Farfrae in fact recalls, as much in his narrowness as in his shrewdness, the not altogether attractive figure of Octavius Caesar. He brings to the firm an order and regularity of which the owner is rendered, by the very largeness of his nature, mentally incapable: "the old crude viva voce system of Henchard, in which everything depended upon his mem- ory, and bargains were made by the tongue alone, was swept away. Letters and ledgers took the place of 'I'll do't,' and 'you shall hae't' . . ." (p. 103). Later, identifying himself with the new mechanization, Far- frae will be responsible for introducing a modem sowing machine while Henchard, identifying himself with custom and tradition, will remain 7 In his symbolic acknowledgment of his brotherhood with the Scotchman - "Your forehead, Farfrae, is something like my poor brother's - now dead and gone . . ." (p. 54) - Henchard appears to recognize, albeit momentarily, the interdependency between reason and passion which his behavior consistently and tragically refutes. DECEMBER 1959 157</page><page sequence="8">John Paterson true to "the venerable seed-lip [which] was still used for sowing as in the days of the Heptarchy" (p. 191). Indeed, for all the irregularity of his behavior, the mayor is moved by profound emotions to which, in his rudimentary piety, he cannot or will not be unfaithful. As the Fortin- bras, as the Octavius Caesar, of the drama, on the other hand, Farfrae is ready, not long after Lucetta's death, to dishonor the emotion to which he once had thrilled. "There are men," Hardy remarks, and he must have had Henchard in mind, "whose hearts insist upon a dogged fidelity to some image or cause . . . long after their judgment has pro- nounced it no rarity ... and without them the band of the worthy is incomplete. But Farfrae was not of those.... He could not but perceive that by the death of Lucetta he had exchanged a looming misery for a simple sorrow" (p. 348). The novel does not commemorate, then, as Tess and Jude com- memorate, the total degradation of the good and the true. Henchard's defeat and Farfrae's accession to power simply reassert, however pain- fully, the necessary balance between two great values with equal claims to recognition and fulfilment: the grandeur that would transcend the limits of the human condition and the moderation that is satisfied to live within these limits. The fate that controls the world of The Mayor of Casterbridge resembles, to this extent, not the brutal and insentient force that presides over Tess and Jude but the ideal justice and wisdom that Hegel found presiding over the tragic drama of Sophocles and Shakespeare. II In the end, of course, Henchard carries within him, in the per- verse instinct for betraying his own best interests, the seeds of his own downfall and disaster. The Mayor of Casterbridge is not, however, any more than Lear and Oedipus, a study in the impulse to self-destruction. Presupposing a concept of man as traditional as its concept of fate, the novel defines the disharmonies of Henchard's mind and imagination within an ethical and religious rather than a psychiatric or scientific frame of reference. Founding itself upon an ancient psychology, The Mayor of Cas- terbridge celebrates, first of all, the subordination of the passions that link man with nature to the reason that unites him with God. It is Hen- chard's tragedy that, like Lear and Othello, he reverses and destroys this order. For when he sells his wife to a sailor for five guineas in violation of the profoundest moral tact, it is at a moment when, under the spell VICTORIAN STUDIES 158</page><page sequence="9">THIE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE AS TRAGEDY of the furmity-woman, he has allowed the passions to distort and deform the reason. Indeed, the surrender to passion responsible for the original crime will, in spite of his heroic resolution to give up drinking for twenty years, repeat itself in those sudden angers and indignations that alienate Farfrae, Elizabeth, and Lucetta, among others, and eventually deprive him of the ordinary consolations of love and friendship. The precarious balance between reason and passion will be reestablished only at the very end when, thoroughly scourged and chastised, all pas- sion spent, Henchard is displaced by the Farfraes and Elizabeths in whose persons the claims of reason are piously acknowledged.8 The novel rests, however, not only on the hierarchic psychology that enjoins the subordination of passion to reason but also on the hier- archic cosmology that enjoins the subordination of the human to the superhuman. Henchard's tragedy is that he has, in repudiating his soli- darity with the human community, subverted the order that has placed man in the middleground between God and nature. Hence his explicit identification with Dr. Faustus, the archetypal representative of human rebellion: Henchard could be described, Hardy writes, "as Faust has been described - as a vehement gloomy being who had quitted the ways of vulgar men without light to guide him on a better way" (p. 131). Indeed, in selling his wife to a sailor who will later return to claim his due, in joining with Farfrae to make his damaged wheat whole again (that is, to manipulate and defraud nature9), in approaching the conjuror Fall for illegitimate insights into the future course of the weather, Henchard is discovered in the attitude and situation made legendary in the story of the diabolical doctor. Hence the traditional pattern of his decline and fall. In contriving to be more than human, Henchard inevitably becomes a great deal less than human. Arrogating powers and prerogatives that rightly belong to the gods, he forfeits, like Faust and Lear and Othello before him, his own humanity. This retrogression is first of all apparent in his brutal loneliness, in his increasing alienation from the human community. It is also apparent, however, though more indirectly, in the elemental or natural imagery with which he is persistently associated. Troubled by the presence of Elizabeth-Jane, he moves "like a great tree in a wind" 8 Thus in the last pages of the novel, Elizabeth is celebrated in having, unlike Henchard, discovered the secret "of making limited opportunities endurable," in having cultivated "those minute forms of satisfaction that offer themselves to everybody not in positive pain" (p. 385). 9 "To fetch it [the damaged wheat] back entirely is impossible," Farfrae tells him; "Nature won't stand so much as that, but heere you go a great way towards it" (p. 53).

After the cruel discovery that she is not after all his daughter, he greets her in a manner described as "dry and thunderous" (p.192). His habit, after his estrangement from Farfrae, is to look "stormfully past him" (p. 132) and in their grim trial of strength in the loft, they rock and writhe "like trees in a gale" (p. 314). At the very last, of course, the mayor is restored to the human community from which he has wilfully separated himself. In marching Abel Whittle off to work without his breeches and exposing him to public humiliation, Henchard had committed once more, at the level of the comic and pathetic, the startling crime at Weydon-Priors. Once again he had dishonored, as Cain to the Abel of his servant and facto- tum, the sacred bond that unites man with even the lowliest of his kind. For when the antiheroic terms of Abel's creation are granted, his nature is ironically revealed as essentially continuous with the mayor's: he is, in all but the pomp and pride of office, Michael Henchard's own brother. "There is sommit wrong in my make, your worshipful!" the poor man confesses in terms that describe his master as well as himself, "especially in the inside . . ." (pp. 111-112). Indeed, Abel reacts to his public humiliation with a gloomy and morbid sensitivity that recalls Henchard himself in the days of his decline and fall: "Yes - I'll go to Blackmoor Vale half naked as I be, since he do command; but I shall kill myself afterwards; I can't outlive the disgrace; for the women-folk will be looking out of their winders at my mortification all the way along, and laughing me to scorn as a man 'ithout breeches! You know how I feel such things, Maister Farfrae, and how forlorn thoughts get hold upon me. Yes - I shall do myself harm - I feel it coming on!" (p. 113). Hence the significance of the novel's final episodes in which Henchard dies abandoned by all but his simple and stubbornly-loyal workman. He has rediscovered in the figure of a hapless and dim-witted laborer, as Lear has rediscovered in a fool and a madman, that brother- hood with all men to which he had in the pride of his nature and his office been unfaithful. The novel invokes, in short, as The Return of the Native and Jude the Obscure with their humanistic orientation do not, the traditional notion that man has been confined not unjustly to a fixed place in the hierarchy of being and is inspired to go his wilful way only at the risk of the direst penalties. III As the particular terms of Henchard's deterioration may already have suggested, the novel's concept of nature is in many respects as VICTORIAN STUDIES 160</page><page sequence="11">'THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE" AS TRAGEDY traditional as its concept of man and fate. Certainly, there is no equiv- alent in The Mayor of Casterbridge for the grotesque image of an Egdon Heath that dwarfs and ultimately overwhelms a helpless humankind. Where nature does enter the novel, it enters as a force obedient and instrumental to a moral order whose rights and claims take priority over man's. Like Oedipus in murdering his father and like Lear in denying his daughter, Henchard affronts, in casting off wife and child, a nature that antedates both Wordsworth and Darwin. The barbarous violence of his deed and the Babylonian char- acter of the fair that is appropriately its setting are opposed, for ex- ample, to a piety in nature that is a reflex of a piety in the universe: The difference between the peacefulness of inferior nature and the wilful hostilities of mankind was very apparent at this place. In contrast with the harshness of the act just ended within the tent was the sight of several horses crossing their necks and rubbing each other lovingly as they waited in patience to be harnessed for the homeward journey. Outside the fair, in the valleys and woods, all was quiet. The sun had recently set, and the west heaven was hung with rosy cloud ... (p. 13).10 The specifically moral agency of this nature becomes most obvious, however, in the catastrophic weather that eventually insures the defeat and humiliation of the hero. For if the rains and tempests that control the world of The Mayor of Casterbridge do not perform in the violent and dramatic terms of the storm in Lear, they bear in the end the same significance. They reflect, as the symptom of a demoralization in nature, the demoralization of the order that Henchard's unnatural act has, much in the manner of Lear's, produced. Insofar, too, as they confound his designs at the same time that they cooperate with Farfrae's, they reveal the extent to which he has lost the power to "sympathize" with, to intuit, its mysteries. Finally and more especially, they enforce, as the agents of the superhuman, the powerful claims which Henchard's guilty humanity has flouted and abrogated. The presidency of a rational power in the universe is apparent not alone, however, in the anthropomorphism of the novel's rains and tempests.11 It is also apparent in the power of the conjuror Fall to 10 The sense in which the hero's crime has violated, and separated him from, a profound morality in nature is elsewhere suggested by the floral imagery with which he is identi- fied in the days of his prelapsarian innocence: "he looked a far different journeyman from the one he had been in his earlier days. Then he had worn clean, suitable clothes, light and cheerful in hue; leggings yellow as marigolds, corduroys immaculate as new flax, and a neckerchief like a flower-garden" (p. 264). 11 The irritability of an intelligent and moral power confronted by the mayor's continu- ing perversity - he has virtually driven Elizabeth from his house - is intimated in the ominously-repeated "smacking of the rope against the flag-staff" (p. 165). Later, when the weather turns to accomplish his ruin, it performs as the agent of a virtually conscious design: "the sunlight would flap out like a quickly opened fan, throw the pattern of the window upon the floor of the room in a milky, colourless shine, and withdraw as suddenly as it had appeared" (p. 218). DECEMBER 1959 161</page><page sequence="12">John Paterson divine the mysteries of the weather. More than a mere concession to local color, more than a symptom of the amateur anthropologist's in- terest in the folklore of his native region, the weird prophet to whom Henchard comes for help has a function in the novel not unlike that of the oracle in Oedipus. The authenticity of his wisdom, the accuracy of his prognostications, argues, as the Delphic oracle argues, the existence of an order beyond man's power to alter or control. Hence it is one as- pect of the general armistice towards which the novel moves that the hero is restored in the end to that rudimentary natural order whose decencies he had flouted and over whose mysteries he had sought to prevail. Returned to the primitive world of Abel Whittle where time is told by the sun (p. 383), he perishes in a mud hovel scarcely dis- tinguishable in its dilapidation from the natural world surrounding it and in fact resembling Lear's humble refuge in the storm. The concept of nature upon which The Mayor of Casterbridge is founded antedates, then, the permissive nature invoked by nineteenth-century transcen- dentalism and the mechanistic nature invented by nineteenth-century science. It operates, like man and fate, within a traditional moral frame of reference. IV The traditional basis of the novel is nowhere more distinct than in the anachronistic theory of society upon which it is predicated. Iso- lated and dissociated from a nineteenth century whose unity has been undermined by science, industry, and democracy, Casterbridge sug- gests, with its agrarian economy, with its merchant aristocracy and its rude population of mechanics, artisans, and laborers, a primitive hier- archic society. Thus Henchard resembles less the modern mayor than the tribal chieftain and is in fact displaced by Farfrae not in a democratic vote but, figuratively if not literally, in a rude trial of strength. His status and stature as a tragic hero are not affected, certainly, by his membership, at the novel's most superficial level, in the anti-heroic middle-class. He is not after all the mayor of Dorchester, the provincial town whose reality is continuous with London and Liverpool and Man- chester, but the mayor of Casterbridge, the provincial capital whose historical associations are more Roman and Hebraic than English.12 12 The novel is literally saturated with allusions to Hebraic and, more notably, as the Latin root of "Casterbridge" would suggest, to Roman, life and literature. It is worth noting, in this connection, that the Saul-David legend was apparently employed by Hardy to frame, and give historical depth to, his "contemporary" narrative (See Julian Moynahan's demonstration in "The Mayor of Casterbridge and the Old Testament's VICTORIAN STUDIES 162</page><page sequence="13">THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE AS TRAGEDY Hence, although he is greater in will and energy than the Christopher Coneys and Solomon Longways, he is at the same time, in his taci- turnity, in his fatalism, in his grotesque and often brutal humor, their true apotheosis, their "hero" in the epic sense. In his physical resem- blance to the town of Casterbridge itself - they are both described in terms of squares and rectangles, for example- he becomes the very symbol of the place, his leadership acquiring to this extent a super- naturalistic rather than a merely naturalistic sanction. Hence the virtually religious interdependence of the man and the city. Participating, like nature, in a universal moral organization, so- ciety is demoralized, as Henchard himself has been demoralized, by the outrage for which no atonement has been made. In receiving and re- warding a man whose ancient crime has gone unacknowledged and uncorrected, Hardy's city has invited, like the Thebes of Sophocles and the Denmark of Shakespeare, the disapprobation of the gods - a plague, a profound social and political disturbance - from which it will not be released until the guilty party has been publicly identified and punished. The pollution of the provincial capital is first of all suggested in the imagery of damp and decay that conditions the atmosphere of the novel.13 It is even more strongly suggested, however, by the frequent allusions to the corrupt and criminal past that evidently underlies - and the analogy with Henchard's own case is unmistakable - the apparently innocent appearance of the city. "Casterbridge is a old hoary place o' wickedness . . .," one of its gloomier citizens acknowledges. "'Tis re- corded in history that we rebelled against the King one or two hundred years ago, in the time of the Romans, and that lots of us was hanged on Gallows Hill, and quartered, and our different jints sent about the country like butcher's meat . . ." (p. 59). To bear out this depressed description, the violent history of the Roman amphitheater outside the town is developed in lugubrious detail: Apart from the sanguinary nature of the games originally played therein, such inci- First Book of Samuel: A Study of Some Literary Relationships," PMLA, LXXI [1956], 118-130). Henchard's analogy with Saul as well as with Oedipus supports the notion developed in the following pages that the archetype of the diseased monarch is funda- mental to the hero's conception. 13 In the early chapters, for example, the mayor has sold the bakers grown wheat, wheat damaged by damp, and debased the bread of an embittered population. Later, when the weather turns to defeat his speculations, the air itself feels "as if cress would grow in it without other nourishment" (p. 218). Imagined as the "mildewed leaf in the sturdy and flourishing Casterbridge plant" (p. 294), Mixen Lane, the haunt of crim- inals and the very sign and symptom of the town's moral dis-ease, is described in nearly symbolic terms as stretching out "like a spit into the moist and misty lowland" (p. 293). Shortly thereafter, the secret of Lucetta's past will spread through the town "like a miasmatic fog" (p. 308).

In addition to these old tragedies, pugilistic encounters almost to the death had come off down to recent dates in that secluded arena ... (p. 8 )14 Later in the novel, depressed and embittered by the disclosure that he is not Elizabeth's father, Henchard encounters in a walk by the river a half-phantasmagorical scene emblematic not only of his own crime and guilt but also of the crime and guilt that attaches to Cas- terbridge itself: Here were the ruins of a Franciscan priory, and a mill attached to the same, the water of which roared down a back-hatch like the voice of desolation. Above the cliff, and behind the river, rose a pile of buildings, and in the front of the pile a square mass cut into the sky. It was like a pedestal lacking its statue. This missing feature ... was, in truth, the corpse of a man; for the square mass formed the base of the gallows, the extensive buildings at the back being the county gaol. In the meadow where Henchard now walked the mob were wont to gather whenever an execution took place, and there to the tune of the roaring weir they stood and watched the spectacle. (p. 145) Later still, an allusion is made to a large square called Bull Stake, hidden, significantly, between the Market House and the Church and stained, like the amphitheater and the priory, by a history of brutality and suffering: " a stone post rose in the midst, to which the oxen had formerly been tied for baiting with dogs to make them tender before they were killed in the adjoining shambles. In a corner stood the stocks" (pp. 219-220). The demoralization of the present by the corruption of the past is perhaps most vividly allegorized in the description of Lucetta's Cas- terbridge house and, specifically, in the description of its structural peculiarity. The front it offered to the world was "Palladian," the novel records, "and like most architecture erected since the Gothic age was a compilation rather than a design. But its reasonableness made it im- pressive" (p. 160). Like Henchard and Lucetta herself, however, the house has a guilty secret. Its reasonable exterior conceals ugly and gro- tesque passions, passions associated here with the Gothic. For one thing, the secret exit Elizabeth discovers in the rear, an ancient arch- way significantly described as "older even than the house itself," has for its keystone a sinister mask which evokes once again the theme of a hidden decay and disease: "Originally the mask had exhibited a comic 14 "Persons sitting with a book or dozing in the arena," the novel goes on to report, "had, on lifting their eyes, beheld the slopes lined with a gazing legion of Hadrian's soldiery as if watching the gladiatorial combat; and had heard the roar of their ex- cited voices .. . ."

More significantly, the door and the mask conjure up once again the imagery of the vile and violent crimes in the past: "The position of the queer old door and the odd presence of the leering mask suggested . . . intrigue. By the alley it had been possible to come unseen from all sorts of quarters in the town- the old play-house, the old bull-stake, the old cock-pit, the pool wherein nameless infants had been used to disappear" (p. 161). Like its maimed and guilt-haunted ruler, then, Casterbridge is demoralized and disabled by a grisly past.15 Infected, like Thebes and Denmark, by the strong stench of time and human evil, it suggests nothing so much, in fact, as a grim and unhallowed wasteland. For one thing, the local peasantry are plainly discovered in a harsher and more skeptical light than they were in Under the Greenwood Tree, Far From the Madding Crowd, and even The Return of the Native. This reinterpretation in part registers a developing realistic bias in Hardy already adumbrated in The Trumpet Major and eventually dominant in Tess and Jude. More exactly, however, it cooperates with the larger purposes of The Mayor of Casterbridge, a brutalized populace bearing witness, like the pimps and whores of Measure for Measure and the gravediggers of Hamlet, to the moral delinquency of a society that has winked at crime and, in a metaphorical sense at least, offended the gods. The demoralization of the folk, their disillusioned and even cyn- ical way of looking at things, is emphasized in being juxtaposed with the romantic idealism of Donald Farfrae, the Fortinbras-like visitor from the brisker and more bracing climate of the Scottish world to the north. Celebrating in a sentimental song the loveliness of his homeland, he evokes in Casterbridge's hollow men a response at once comic and disenchanted. "Danged," says one, "if our country down here is worth singing about like that! When you take away from among us the fools and the rogues, and the lammigers, and the wanton hussies, and the slatterns, and such like, there's cust few left to ornament a song with in Casterbridge, or the country round" (p. 59). "We be bruckle folk 15 This is not to suggest that as a "cause" of the city's demoralization, the criminality of its past history operates on the same level with the criminality of its chief magistrate. It enters the novel only at the level of reference and allusion and not at the level of the action and to this extent serves no more than a symbolic function. The city's grue- some history acts, in short, less as a direct cause of its discomposure than as an anal- ogy with the history of Michael Henchard. Indeed, insofar as he is haunted by the same history of crime and passion as Casterbridge itself, the virtually religious basis of his rulership - the interdependence of the man and the city - is once again verified. DECEMBER 1959 165</page><page sequence="16">John Paterson here," adds Christopher Coney, defining at once the sterility of the land- scape and the brutalization of its inhabitants, "the best o' us hardly honest sometimes, what with hard winters, and so many mouths to fill, and God a'mighty sending his little taties so terrible small to fill 'em with. We don't think about flowers and fair faces, not we - except in the shape o' cauliflowers and pigs' chaps" (p. 60).16 The local demoralization is perhaps rendered most dramatically in the sinister community of Mixen Lane. Without precedent in the novels that antedate The Mayor of Casterbridge, these polluted precincts harbor a peasantry no longer redeemed, as even Christopher Coney and Solomon Longway are redeemed, by their whimsicality and humor: "Vice ran freely in and out certain of the doors of the neighbourhood; recklessness dwelt under the roof with the crooked chimney; shame in some bow-windows; theft (in times of privation) in the thatched and mud-walled houses by the sallows. Even slaughter had not been al- together unknown here. In a block of cottages up an alley there might have been erected an altar to disease in years gone by" (pp. 293-294). Far from celebrating its charm and picturesqueness, the novel con- templates the delinquent proletariat of Casterbridge with something resembling aristocratic irony and disdain. The inn called Peter's Finger is described as "the church of Mixen Lane" (p. 295). Satirically defined as "a virtuous woman who years ago had been unjustly sent to gaol as an accessory to something or other after the fact," the landlady has "worn a martyr's countenance ever since, except at times of meeting the constable who apprehended her, when she winked her eye" (p. 296). Her customers are described, meanwhile, with a nearly bitter irony, as "ex-poachers and ex-gamekeepers whom squires had persecuted with- out a cause .. ." (p. 296). The monstrous rites of the skimmington ride will in fact expose on the level of action this deterioration of the folk. Having terrorized a helpless woman, they will slink "like the crew of Comus" back to the miasmal suburbs from which they have momentar- ily emerged; questioned by the constables, they will answer with a sinister and dishonorable evasiveness (p. 324). In the end, of course, the denizens of Mixen Lane are no more condemned for their moral dereliction than are Shakespeare's pimps and gravediggers. They are less the causes of the moral and social dis- 16 Indeed, for all his whimsy Christopher will later be guilty of a moral dereliction not significantly different from Henchard's. Acting from an ineluctable moral premise ("Why should death rob life o' fourpence?") and in violation of the profoundest moral tact ("And when you've used 'em, and my eyes don't open no more, bury the pennies, good souls, and don't ye go spending 'em . . ."), he will rifle the grave of Susan Hen- chard for the four ounce pennies that serve as weights for her eyes (p. 137).

They express the bitterness and despair of a so- ciety whose magistrates, in having offended against justice, have for- feited their clear moral authority to rule. For the demoralization of the city is apparent not alone in the brutalization of the lower orders. It is also apparent in the brutalization of those proud merchant princes who, in having welcomed and celebrated a man offensive to the gods, in hav- ing become infected by the mayor's pride and arrogance, have sub- mitted their humanity to base and ugly distortions.17 It is therefore one aspect of the city's ordeal that its safety and stability are threatened throughout by serious internal conflicts. As in Hamlet and Lear, the disturbance of the moral order expresses itself in the disturbance of the social order. The discontinuity between the moral order that Henchard has insulted and the social order that has received and rewarded him is made evident almost at once. Twenty years after the original crime, Susan enters the provincial capital ex- pecting with good reason to find the culprit occupying the stocks: she finds him instead presiding arrogantly over a civic banquet as the wealth- iest and most powerful man in the community. Hence, while the mayor and the members of the local oligarchy hold court in the King's Arms for all the world like depraved Roman emperors, a surly populace, alienated by the corruption of its bread, gathers in the outer darkness of the street on the point of revolt. "As we plainer fellows bain't invited," one citizen remarks in unconscious criticism of the insolence of high office, "they leave the winder-shutters open that we may get jist a sense o't out here" (p. 36). "They can blare their trumpets and thump their drums, and have their roaring dinners," a local Madame Lafarge has declared in terms that point up the Roman character of the revels, "but we must needs be put-to for want of a wholesome crust" (p. 33). The corruption of those in power will eventually be exposed, of course, with the re-appearance and trial of the furmity-woman, the 17 At the banquet held in the mayor's honor, for example, they are described in terms that suggest a fallen, a bestialized, humanity: "the younger guests were talking and eating with animation; their elders were searching for tit-bits, and sniffing and grunt- ing over their plates like sows nuzzling for acorns" (p. 38). Later unmanned, like Henchard himself twenty years earlier, by drink, they undergo Circean transformations: "square-built men showed a tendency to become hunchbacks; men with a dignified presence lost it in a curious obliquity of figure, in which their features grew disarranged and one-sided; whilst the heads of a few who had dined with extreme thoroughness were somehow sinking into their shoulders, the corners of their mouth and eyes being bent upwards by the subsidence" (p. 44). At the scene of the market, finally, these Bulges, Brownlets, Kitsons and Yoppers, whose gross and cacophonous names define the rudimentariness of their spiritual condition (p. 176), are described in terms of an elemental imagery that suggests, as in Henchard's case, a less than complete humanity: they are described as "men of extensive stomachs, sloping like mountain sides; men whose heads in walking swayed as the trees in November gales" (pp. 174-175).

Charged with commit- ting an outrage on the church wall, charged in effect with an irreligious act not different from that for which Henchard, her judge, has gone unpunished, she publicizes the crime he has concealed for twenty years and exposes therewith the discrepancy between the social order of which he is the head and the moral order to which he has done violence. She not only represents, then, the past's determined and inexorable re- assertion of its rights and bears witness, in her own moral delinquency, to the brutalization of the lower classes already discoverable in Chris- topher Coney and the maimed citizens of Mixen Lane. She also ex- presses their revulsion against the social and political order whose man- date to rule and administer justice has, by the fact of its own moral disability, been rendered fraudulent. "It proves," says she, delivering the moral of the occasion, "that he's no better than I, and has no right to sit there in judgment upon me" (p. 232). The moral inadequacy of Henchard's society is in fact underlined by Hardy's farcical treatment of the whole episode. For if, in his tragic embarrassment, the mayor recalls the figure of Duke Angelo, the arresting constable Stubberd re- calls, and indeed fulfills the same function as, Shakespeare's clownish constable Elbow. Regarding the furmity-woman "with a suppressed gaze of victorious rectitude" (pp. 230-231), Stubberd reflects, in his physical decrepitude, in his ignorance and absurd self-righteousness, the moral impotence of the society whose law he has been hired to enforce. The disharmony and confusion to which Henchard's original act of impiety has exposed the city becomes climacteric, finally, in the nearly-savage violence of the skimmington ride. For the hidden impost- hume that silently undermines the moral stability of the town has not, in spite of Henchard's public degradation, been fully removed. In re- fusing like the mayor to acknowledge the crime in her past, in marrying the man who has supplanted him as the town's chief merchant and magistrate, Lucetta has in effect perpetuated the ancient wrong.18 Furthermore, in publicly repudiating the sadly-deteriorated Henchard on the occasion of the Royal Visit, Farfrae as well as Lucetta becomes guilty of the same pride, of the same offense against human solidarity, of which the fallen mayor himself had been found guilty. In this light, the skimmington ride expresses the demoralization 18 The Royal Visit over which she and her husband preside suggests in fact the same barbaric pride and arrogance as the civic banquet over which the guilty Henchard had presided earlier in the novel: Lucetta is defined as Farfrae's Calphurnia (p. 307) and the official carriages are described as rattling "heavily as Pharaoh's chariots down Corn Street" (p. 308). VICTORIAN STUDIES 168</page><page sequence="19">THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE" AS TRAGEDY and confusion of a social order that has continued wilfully to dissociate itself from the moral order. If, as Farfrae not altogether wrongly sus- pects, the organizers of the barbaric rite have been inspired by "the tempting prospect of putting to the blush people who stand at the head of affairs" (p. 346), it is because their claims to rulership have been fraudulent and dishonest. Indeed, the moral incompetence of the society over which Farfrae and Lucetta prevail is dramatized, as in the episode of the furmity-woman's trial, by the comedy of its cowardly constab- ulary. Described as shrivelled men - "yet more shrivelled than usual, having some not ungrounded fears that they might be roughly handled if seen" (p. 323) - Stubberd and his crew conceal in a water-pipe the staves that are the instruments of their office and take refuge up an alley until the skimmington ride is over. At the very last, of course, the agonies of this divided and de- moralized society are permitted to subside. With the total eclipse of Henchard and Lucetta and the marriage of Farfrae and Elizabeth-Jane, the social order is brought once again into harmony with the moral order. In marrying Lucetta with her pride and her guilt and her fine clothing, Farfrae had compromised his right to rule, had aroused, like Henchard in his day, the animosity of his citizen-subjects.19 However, in uniting himself with Elizabeth-Jane who has declined, unlike Lu- cetta, to antagonize the superintending powers, Farfrae restores himself to the good graces of the folk and brings to an end the civil division that had registered the resentment of an affronted moral order.20 Hence, in the novel's final passages, the restoration of the society whose authority Henchard and Lucetta had jeopardized, the reconciliation of the classes whose mutual hostility had threatened its total collapse, can be cele- brated in the mild dominion of an Elizabeth-Jane who perceives "no great personal difference between being respected in the nether parts of Casterbridge and glorified at the uppermost end of the social world" (p. 385). In the context of this novel, then, the social order acquires a virtually religious sanction of which it is almost wholly deprived in the naturalistic contexts of Tess and Jude. Michael Henchard is not, like the protagonists of the later novels, crucified by a brutal and depraved 19 "How folk do worship fine clothes!" one good citizen had bitterly remarked at the time of Farfrae's marriage to Lucetta. "I do like to see the trimming pulled off such Christmas candles," another had ominously declared.

Its corruption and de- moralization register, as in Oedipus and Hamlet, the corruption and demoralization of its chief magistrate. They register the disapprobation of a universal order whose morality the defection of the hero has pro- foundly disturbed. Like fate and nature, society here operates within a traditional moral frame. The sociology of the novel is as archaic as its psychology and cosmology. V To argue that The Mayor of Casterbridge observes the tradi- tional norms of tragedy is not of course to argue that it has no realistic basis whatsoever. It would hardly be a novel if it did not admit some- thing of the life of its particular time and place. The presence of the conjuror Fall and the incident of the skimmington ride bear witness to the amateur anthropologist's authentic interest in the folkways of a dying culture. Indeed, Hardy was himself to acknowledge in his preface (p. v) that the story was specifically inspired by three events in the real history of the Dorchester locality: the sale of a wife, the uncertain harvests which preceded the repeal of the Corn Laws, and the visit of a member of the royal house. To describe the dominating motive of the novel as therefore realistic, however, would be not only to underesti- mate, but also to leave largely unexplained, the great vitality that it ultimately generates. It would be to ignore the fact that its realistic data are in the end assimilated and controlled by the tragic form, and that it is this form and not the content, not its fidelity to the data of social history, that finally accounts for its perennial power. Wife-sale may well have been a virtual commonplace in the rural England of the nineteenth century,21 and such magicians as the conjuror Fall may still have frequented the countryside of Wessex. But their appearance in The Mayor of Casterbridge as the materiel of two of its most crucial episodes is adequately explained less by their reference to aspects of contemporary reality than by their reference to the novel's artistic ne- cessities, by their adaptation as stations in the tragic martyrdom of Michael Henchard. Again, Hardy may well have been concerned, as a social historian, with the new mechanization, with the decay of the primitive agriculture that had been practised since the days of the Heptarchy. Quite clearly, however, this conflict between the old method 21 Miss Ruth Firor has suggested so much (Folkways in Thomas Hardy [Philadelphia, 1931], p. 237) as indeed has Hardy himself at the beginning of ch. iv. VICTORIAN STUDIES 170</page><page sequence="21">THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE AS TRAGEDY and the new is exploited not for the sake of history but for the sake of the novel: it defines and develops the tragic conflict between Henchard and Farfrae, between the old god and the new. The novel is not dam- aged as tragedy, in other words, as Tess and Jude were to be damaged, by a preoccupation with social history or social issues.22 Cut off from contemporary experience as the later novels are not, The Mayor of Cas- terbridge repudiates prose fiction's characteristic willingness to admit, more undiscriminatingly than is possible for epic and tragedy, the un- blessed life of time and history.23 This is so much the case that, as has already been pointed out, the atmosphere of the novel is more Roman and Hebraic than English: it evokes not so much the world of London, Liverpool, and Manchester as the world of Thebes, Padan-Aram, and ancient Rome. To argue, finally, that The Mayor of Casterbridge satisfies the traditional norms of tragedy is not to argue that the celebrant of nine- teenth-century romantic and scientific doctrines is altogether sup- pressed. If the novel assumes, in its concepts of man and fate, nature and society, a traditional frame of reference tolerant of tragedy, there are inevitably occasions when the Swinburnian and Darwinian Hardy reasserts himself with results that make for a reduction of the tragic temperature. After he has identified an order in nature as the delicate reflex of a moral order in the universe, he must pay his respects to the contemporary scientific doctrine that has taken nature out of its tradi- tional frame: "in presence of this scene after the other, there was a natural instinct to abjure man as the blot on an otherwise kindly uni- verse; till it was remembered that ... mankind might some night be innocently sleeping when these quiet objects were raging aloud" (p. 13; see above, p. 161 ). And having decided that the ugly weathers of the novel expressed the reaction of a just and morally-intelligent fate, he must temporarily reassert his humanistic allegiances and openly com- miserate with a cruelly-persecuted humanity: the impulse of the peas- antry, he remarks, "was well-nigh to prostrate themselves in lamenta- tion before untimely rains and tempests, which came as the Alastor 22 Jacques Barzun has pointed out that "no reform of the divorce laws or the entrance requirements of Oxford would by itself alter the chances of Tess' and Jude's coming to happier ends" ("Truth and Poetry in Thomas Hardy," p. 188). This is another way of saying, however, that these issues have an interest in and for themselves that the conflict between the old and the new agriculture cannot claim. Certainly, these questions do dominate Tess and Jude as the agricultural question does not dominate The Mayor of Casterbridge. 23 Which is to question Arthur Mizener's assertion that Hardy "never freed himself wholly from the naturalistic assumption that narrative must be significant historically rather than fabulously" ("Jude the Obscure as a Tragedy," p. 196).

Under some of the roofs abode pure and virtuous souls whose presence there was due to the iron hand of necessity, and to that alone" (p. 295). Most glaringly of all, perhaps, the balance between the heroic passion of Henchard, on the one hand, and the modesty of Farfrae and Elizabeth, on the other, is at times upset by the author's insurgent romantic sym- pathies. Rebelling against the traditional frame he has himself set up, rebelling against the moral dispensation that Henchard himself has been great enough to accept as right and just, Hardy will bitterly revile the mediocrities who have supplanted his doomed and suffering pro- tagonist. Elizabeth's "craving for correctness" he denounces as "almost vicious (p. 248); Farfrae he mocks as celebrating the "dear native coun- try that he loved so well as never to have revisited it" (p. 373). The outrage and indignation of the nineteenth-century humanist in the presence of a suffering mankind, common enough in Tess and Jude and indeed the primary condition of their creation, are not, how- ever, the predominating motives of The Mayor of Casterbridge. These emotions may flare momentarily at the surface of the novel; but they do not penetrate to or issue from its vital center. They appear after all only at the superficial level of authorial commentary and are contradicted and ultimately overwhelmed by the novel's fundamental assumptions, by the traditional moral or religious values rendered at the crucial level of character and action, form and structure. Hence the novel's emer- gence as one of the truly remarkable anachronisms in the history of English literature. Rejecting the disabling doctrine of the nineteenth century and exploiting the enabling doctrine of a time still capable of vibrating to the vision of a just and ordered universe, The Mayor of Casterbridge approximates, as perhaps no novel before or since has approximated, the experience of tragedy in its olden, in its Sophoclean or Shakespearean, sense. University of California, Berkeley 24 Indeed, Henchard's heroic recognition of the moral authority of the power that has humbled his pride, a recognition irrefutably validated in the narrative structure of the novel, is at one point repudiated as bearing witness to his fetichism: "Henchard, like all his kind, was superstitious, and he could not help thinking that the concatena- tion of events this evening had produced was the scheme of some sinister intelligence bent on punishing him. Yet they had developed naturally" (p. 144). VICTORIAN STUDIES 172</page></plain_text>
