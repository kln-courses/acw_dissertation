<plain_text><page sequence="1">Saying Yes to Reality Skepticism, Antirealism, and Perspectivism in Nietzsche s Epistemology Rex Welshon Epistemology is a cautious and methodical inquiry undertaken almost exclusively by professors of philosophy. Sober analyses identifying condi tions necessary and sufficient for belief to qualify as knowledge are presented with all the solemnity of scientific discoveries. Just as scientists proceed by incrementally narrowing the scope of discovery to something experimentally tractable, so epistemologists partition the components of knowledge into belief, justification, and truth so as to facilitate precise inquiry and accurately map alternatives for each. And just as scientists design empirical experiments against which their proposed hypotheses are tested, so epistemologists design thought experiments against which their proposed necessary and sufficient conditions are tested. Nietzsche was not a university philosophy professor for long, and the way he does epistemology bears little resemblance to what is produced in academic hothouses. True, he considers some standard questions that epistemologists ask. Like other epistemologists, he is interested in the scope and constituents of knowledge, and like them he asks questions such as: How much do we know? What do we know when we know? How do we know what we know? What is the difference between knowing something and merely believing it? What is truth, and how does it differ from falsehood? But his approach to answering the questions is neither solemn nor deliberate, for he is a joyful epistemologist who practices a fr?hliche Wissenschaft. Nietzsche's epistemological exuberance can be gleaned from a handful of passages. He asserts that "no honey is sweeter than that of knowledge" (HH 292) and connects knowledge to pleasure and will to power: "Knowledge [is] linked to pleasure ... [fjirst and foremost, because by it we gain awareness of our power, ... [sjecond, because, as we gain knowledge, we surpass older ideas and their representatives,... [t]hird, because any new knowledge, however small, makes us feel superior to everyone and unique in understanding this mat ter correctly" (HH 252). Moreover, pleasure for us moderns is not even worth having without knowledge because "knowledge has in us been transformed into a passion which shrinks at no sacrifice and at bottom fears nothing but its own extinction" (D 429). Even the announcement in The Gay Science that JOURNAL OF NIETZSCHE STUDIES, Issue 37, 2009. Copyright ? 2009 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA. 23</page><page sequence="2">24 Rex Welshon God is dead is taken to be a happy harbinger, for "all the daring of the lover of knowledge is permitted again; the sea, our sea, lies open again; perhaps there has never been such an 'open sea'" (343). Setting out on this sea is cause for rejoicing, "a world of dangers and victories in which heroic feelings, too, find places to dance and play: "'Life as a means to knowledge'?with this principle in one's heart one can live not only boldly but even gaily, and laugh gaily too" (GS 324). Finally, consider the following passage from Ecce Homo: "Knowledge, saying Yes to reality, is just as necessary for the strong as cowardice and the flight from reality?as the 'ideal' is for the weak, who are inspired by weakness" ("Birth of Tragedy" 2). Two things are immediately apparent from these passages. First, Nietzsche is not a traditional skeptic about knowledge in the way that, for instance, Descartes or Hume is a skeptic. That is, Nietzsche is far from claiming that our beliefs are threatened by the possibility that they attach to nothing and are, thus, one and all false. Second, in every one of the passages quoted, Nietzsche links the possession of knowledge with what are blandly called affective states. Whether that state is sweetness, pleasure, feeling superior, passion, daring, gay laughter, or strength, it is clear that knowledge is anything but the dispassionate pursuit of algorithms of justification or precise formulations of thought experiments. This is why he rarely acknowledges work on the category of knowledge already completed by other philosophers, and then only to ridicule it. Nietzsche is scorn ful of knowledge as it is conceived in the philosophical tradition, claiming that it is "the biggest fable of all" (WP 555). He is also dismissive of the traditional epistemologist's emphasis on clarity and truth, claiming to the contrary that "delusion and error are conditions of human knowledge and sensation" (GS 107). Nietzsche has his reasons for abandoning knowledge and truth as conceived by the tradition and for embracing what the tradition would deride as mere opinion and falsehood. These reasons and some of the recent scholarship discussing them are the topics of this essay. Nietzsche's Skepticism Nietzsche is fond of tossing off provocative asides such as, "We simply lack any organ for knowledge, for 'truth"'(G5354).Thispassageand the many others like it sprinkled throughout Nietzsche's work reveal that he allows that there are philosophical problems with knowledge and truth and that these problems are worthy of investigation. But philosophers, especially philosophy professors, are the last people to help us sort these problems out. Nietzsche makes it clear that "conscious thinking, especially that of the philosopher, is the least vigor ous and therefore also the relatively mildest and calmest form of thinking; and thus precisely philosophers are most apt to be led astray about the nature of</page><page sequence="3">Saying Yes To Reality 25 knowledge" (GS 333). This passage has two implications: first, a more vigorous kind of thinking than that found in the philosophical animal will give us a better understanding of knowledge; second, since the philosopher is more likely to compound than resolve the problems posed by knowledge, skepticism is the appropriate attitude to adopt toward what the philosopher has to say about knowl edge. We return to the first implication shortly. Here, consider the second. Nietzsche is convinced that the history of Western philosophizing about knowledge is almost entirely wrongheaded. That is just to say that he is skeptical about virtually every philosopher's epistemological assumptions and discoveries. Chief among these discoveries is, as we will see shortly, the "real" world whose nature is taken by the philosopher to be criterial of knowledge. Note initially that since it is such philosophical arguments that are Nietzsche's primary target, his skepticism digs deep, deeper in fact than the category of knowledge itself. In fact, it goes all the way to the ontological categories and the logical axioms assumed by epistemologists when they reason. While examining his criticisms of logic and ontology would take us too far afield, it is important to recognize that Nietzsche's critical engagement with the epistemological tradition leaks into every other region of philosophizing as well. Two quick examples must suffice. Contrary to Aristotle (and most of the members of the philosophical tradition who think as he did), Nietzsche claims that the law of noncontradiction is not bedrock to thought or world. Like all logical truths, the law of noncontradiction is instead nothing more than a cognitive requirement for us. As such, it and other logical truths may in fact be fundamental, as Nietzsche is sometimes prepared to admit (BGE 4), but they have no demonstrable counterpart in the world, and there is no reason to think that they are binding on other species. Thus, contrary to what is typically assumed about the relation between logic and the world, there is no direct mapping from the former to the latter, and the belief that there is such a mapping must be explained as a psychological palliative rather than as a discovery about the fundamental structure of the world. One implication of the slippage between logic and world is that there is no reason to think that since we employ singular terms in language, there must also be singular entities in the world that match them. The philosopher's "real" world is the world as God would see it were he to exist. This world?in contrast to the world of appearances given in sensory experience?is composed of mind independent, determinate, and self-identical things (BGE 4; WP 516). But God is dead, and with his death the "real" world implodes. However, shadows of that "real" world continue to hold on, embedded in our language as ontological commitments to the nice, neat, orderly things God once knew. Since the syntax of language encodes these mistaken ontological commitments, neither linguistic analysis nor the construction of a logically perfect language can hope to provide insight into what we can know of the world. In short, our faith in the grammar and syntax of natural language generates faith in logic and in synchronically unified</page><page sequence="4">26 Rex Welshon and diachronically identical things. None is much better than faith in God. There may well be unitary things at a time and identical things over time, but they are constructed to serve and satisfy the interests of human perspectives. Nietzsche sometimes says that things are fictions invented by humans (WP 516). The statement "things are fictions" can be glossed as saying that the interpretations of singular terms in a language rich enough to contain existential quantification are not extraperspectival but perspectival entities. Articulating the nature of these perspectival entities is a question that ontology, not epistemol ogy, tries to answer. Nietzsche has a great deal to offer as an ontologist, as has been argued (see especially Hales and Welshon 2000; Poellner 1997; Richardson 1996; Schacht 1983). But our interest is epistemological, not ontological. Still, the position enunciated by saying that we refer to and can know only perspectival entities is an aspect of Nietzsche's perspectivism, which is a kind of antirealism. Typically, antirealism asserts that (a) there is no "real" world consisting of a fixed number of mind-independent objects or things-in-themselves; (b) there may be more than one complete and true description of the world of mind-independent objects; and (c) truth is epistemic in some sense of the term epistemic. Nietzsche's perspectivism is committed to all of these claims. Claim (a) is a statement about the perspectivist nature of the things we know; (b) is a statement about the per spectivist nature of the justification of what we know; (c) is a statement about the perspectivist nature of the truth of what we know. Take the claims in order. The "Real" World and Other Philosophical Confections The claim that there is no "real" world consisting of a fixed number of mind independent objects or things-in-themselves is directed against the long line of philosophers who use epistemological considerations to underwrite a distinc tion between the apparent world given in sensory experience and the real world known by reason. Nietzsche is undoubtedly correct that most epistemological theories in the Western tradition are motivated by a fear of illusion and routinely employ the occurrence of sensory illusions as premises in arguments that deni grate the kind of knowledge available empirically, contrasting such knowledge with more robust forms of knowledge made possible only through the use of reason. Once injected into the collective philosophical psyche, the real/apparent world distinction infects most subsequent epistemology and ontology. Kant marked a fundamental change to this epistemological trajectory, for he accepted the empirical world's knowability and the "real" world's unknow ability. The familiar empirical objects presented in sensory experience can be known only because they have already been subjected to the categories and forms of intuition, whereas things of the "real" world as they are in themselves cannot be known precisely because they are not subject to the categories and</page><page sequence="5">Saying Yes To Reality 27 forms of intuition. However, for all of its unknowability, the noumenal realm of things-in-themselves remains thinkable and plays a crucial role in Kant's moral and aesthetic reflections. Nietzsche is incredulous at this about-face and asks: If the thing-in-itself is unknowable, why continue to insist that it is thinkable? The answer is that Kant requires noumena for his morality to have any bite, but that just makes the Nietzschean point that metaphysical theories are not something discovered through the use of reason but are, rather, the expressions of human, all-too-human, needs. Nietzsche thus pulls the rug out from under Kant's metaphysical grounding of morality by exposing the moral grounding of his metaphysics. Kant is one of Nietzsche's favorite targets, but he is far from the only target. In the early sections of Beyond Good and Evil, again in Twilight of the Idols, and throughout the Nachlass notes from this time period (1881-88), Nietzsche marches through the history of philosophy, isolating and lampooning key phil osophical "discoveries" that are planks in the real/apparent world platform. Among others to come in for scorn are Plato's forms (BGE P), Descartes' cogito (BGE16), Locke's innate ideas (BGE20), Schopenhauer's willing (BGE 16, 19), Schelling's intellectual intuition (BGE 11), and scientific views that try to replace these philosophical whimsies with scientific ones such as materialistic atomism (BGE 12) or laws of nature (BGE 14,22). It is tempting but mistaken to think that Nietzsche's antirealism entails either (i) that the world is exhausted by the fictional entities we have created for think ing, or (ii) that beyond the entities we have created for thinking there resides a set of extraperspectival entities, or (iii) that the world of perspectival entities is anthropomorphically chauvinistic. As against (i), Nietzsche's view is that while every thing that we think about is a consequence of imposing categories onto, and forming concepts out of, sensory chaos, many things lie beyond what we know or can know because every organic entity has its perspective and every organic entity with a perspective categorizes its experience in a way that suits its ends and purposes. (I note, but pass over, Nietzsche's additional claim that not only organic entities but inorganic entities are likewise capable of having perspectives.) So, for all members of all species, there is no distinction between objects that "really" exist in and of themselves and those that exist from some perspective. Yet, although Nietzsche routinely denies that there are ready-made objects in a mind-independent world, he is no idealist. Idealism is admittedly regularly confused with antirealism, but they are distinct positions, idealism being more ambitious than antirealism. Nietzsche rejects idealism with a neat little reductio stated succinctly in Beyond Good and Evil 15. Idealism claims that the physical world is distinct from and a causal result of mental activity. If so, that would make our sensory apparatus, a component of the mind, a cause of itself, a causa sui. Since a causa sui is, Nietzsche thinks, self-contradictory, idealism must be rejected.</page><page sequence="6">28 Rex Welshon As against (ii), Nietzsche's view is that even when human perspectives are subtracted from what there is, what remains is as wrapped up in perspectival interdependence as that which was subtracted. Nietzsche's extension of perspec tives beyond human perspectives and into at least the balance of the organic world warrants his criticism of Kant and every other defender of the real world/ apparent world distinction. Moreover, extending perspectives beyond the human perspective also permits Nietzsche to make his criticisms without his own views relapsing into a mutant form of what he rejects, for since even the nonhuman balance is perspectival through and through, any other argument on behalf of a perspective-free "real" world goes by the boards. As he puts it, using the lan guage of his opponents against them to make his point: "The 'apparent' world is the only one: the 'real' world has only been lyingly added' (77 "Reason in Philosophy" 2). As against (iii), Nietzsche's kind of antirealism is at least not immediately anthropomorphic. If he were to claim that the characteristics of our experience of the apparent world?its impermanence, instability, and indistinctness?are cri terial for all experience, then the charge would stick. However, Nietzsche claims not that the rest of existence is as it is because of the way human experience is but, rather, that human experience is as it is because of the way the rest of existence is. Of course, while this exonerates Nietzsche from the charge of chauvinism at the first level, one might respond that his presumption to have overcome the limitations of the human perspective enough to speak on behalf of what the world is like outside of the human perspective is itself anthropomorphic. After all, if we cannot know anything beyond the human perspective, then we cannot know that every other species?even those that exist outside of our possible knowledge?likewise introduce their own perspectives. By his own lights, no one can get enough epistemological distance from the human perspective to say what the world is like outside that human perspective (Anderson 1999). There is a problem here, and we return to it below. Perspectival Contextualism and Scientific Method Without the "real" world of things-in-themselves, monads, substances, forms, and all the other ontological concoctions, many of the traditional epistemo logical project's core presuppositions collapse. As a result, whatever counted as knowledge on the standards implied by those presuppositions cannot but be unattainable, and whatever can now count as knowledge once those presupposi tions lapse will not count as knowledge on the standards they imply. For what can now count as knowledge is perspectivally justified and perspectivally true. Since there are no truths except perspectival truths and no justification except perspectival justification, there can be no beliefs or statements that are true</page><page sequence="7">Saying Yes To Reality 29 simpliciter or objectively or absolutely without being indexed to a perspective, and there are no justificatory algorithms that will, for any candidate statement input, spit out a thumbs-up or thumbs-down. Toward extraperspectival knowl edge and rationalistic recipes, Nietzsche is a consistent, thoroughgoing skeptic. Still, Nietzsche is happy to call perspectivally true and perspectivally justified beliefs and statements "knowledge." Toward such perspectival knowledge, Nietzsche is not at all skeptical. Most philosophers concerned with Nietzsche's epistemology have focused their energy on the truth of the statements that are candidates for the honorific "knowledge." We look at some of these efforts shortly. In this section, the other component to knowledge?justification?is addressed. Less attention has been paid to Nietzsche's views on this topic. Most contemporary theories ofknowledge accept some version of the semantic theory of truth and thus vary according to how justification gets spelled out. The three most popular contemporary theories of epistemological justification are foundationalism, coherentism, and contex tualism. According to foundationalist theories of justification, a statement is justified whenever it is either implied by or is a foundational statement, where a foundational statement is either indubitable or incorrigible or infallible or imme diately justified or self-justified or noninferentially justified. Preference for the property that justifies foundational statements distinguishes foundationalists? Descartes chose indubitability, incorrigibility, and infallibility; Chisholm argued at different times for immediate justification and self-justification; Alston con sidered noninferential justification and immediate justification. According to coherentist theories of justification, a statement is justified whenever it coheres with others. Various candidates for coherence are live options, including implica tion, mutual implication, pragmatic fit, and others. According to contextualist theories of justification, a statement is justified whenever it is justified within a given context. Candidates for contextual justification include causal relations, counterfactual dependencies, and conceptual roles. If there is anything Nietzsche is not, it is a foundationalist. He repeatedly lampoons certainty, incorrigibility, infallibility, and indubitability throughout his writings. But even more recent versions that abandon those criteria are also subject to Nietzschean critique. Take the strain of foundationalism according to which foundational statements are those that result from self-presenting states, where a self-presenting state is a cognitive state whose content cannot be doubted. An example is that, right now, as I write this sentence, it seems to me that I can hear students outside my window. Now, suppose I believe that I am hearing students outside my window. The statement "I believe I am hearing students outside my window" would be justified, and, hence, knowledge, if it were inferred from the self-presenting state of seeming to hear students outside my window. Nietzsche cannot be this kind of foundationalist either, if for no other reason than he thinks there are no self-presenting states. He thinks that the inner world is full of error</page><page sequence="8">30 Rex Welshon and illusion; so no category of mental state is immune to error; so there is no such thing as an indubitable self-presenting state; so there are no foundations of this sort for justification; so foundationalism of this sort fails. He would make similar arguments against any other foundationalist proposal. Nor is Nietzsche a typical coherentist. Typical coherentists emphasize the role of logical implication in assessing coherence, but Nietzsche cannot follow them in doing so. First, he is generally ambivalent about logic, so it would be unlike him to develop coherence in that direction. Second, coherence as understood by the logician implies consistency across statements, for a presupposition of one statement implying another is that they are both true at the same time. But, as will be seen in the discussion of truth, Nietzsche allows that inconsistent statements can both be perspectivally true. So, again, his coherentism is an atypical one. Still, there are coherentist elements running through Nietzsche's work, chief among them being his central claim that knowledge cannot be presuppositionless or perspective free (GM 111:24; GS 344). If all knowledge is perspectival, it cannot but be that knowledge will require weighing one perspective against the other, as he points out in GS: "The strongest and most evil spirits have so far done the most to advance humanity ... : they reawakened again and again the sense of comparison, of contradiction, of the pleasure of what is new, daring, untried; the compelled man to pit opinion against opinion, model against model" (4). Since all knowledge emerges against the background of older claims to knowledge and the experienced world rather than against a background of objective facts and disinterested reason, comparing and weighing perspectives will also have some pragmatic elements. Still, since it does not follow that justification is nothing more than this exercise of comparison, justification does not reduce to coherence. It is better to think of Nietzsche as a contextualist for whom justification var ies across perspectives and contexts (Hales and Welshon 2000; Welshon 2004). I call this "perspectival contextualism." Both parts of the name are necessary, for each labels a distinct facet of Nietzsche's epistemological thought: first, what justifies a belief is itself always indexed to some perspective; second, the contexts in which a request for justifying beliefs is made vary across a number of dimensions. Thus perspectival contextualism is the dual view according to which claims to knowledge require a context in which a request for justifica tion arises and a perspective to which the resulting justification is indexed. An example shows the difference in the two components. What prompts a demand for justification in a political context need not be, and probably is not, what prompts a demand for justification with the same propositional content in either a scientific context or an interpersonal context or a context of intimacy. That is the contextualist element. Likewise, what qualifies as an answer in each of the distinct contexts will differ, but not only as a function of the distinct contexts. In addition to context, other factors?epistemological, psychological, social, and</page><page sequence="9">Saying Yes To Reality 31 others?also become relevant for determining whether an offered justification qualifies as such. That is the perspectival element. Two, more radical, implications follow. First, a single belief that-/? can be justified from one perspective and unjustified from another. One person A may, for example, know something that another person B does not. If so, then B's reasons for believing that-/? are, from his perspective, justified, while for A they are not justified. Second, a single belief that-/? can be justified in one context and unjustified in another context. Again, justifying a belief that-/? in an everyday conversational context is likely to have different requirements than justifying the same belief in a philosophical discussion. Another implication of perspectival contextualism is that whether statements are justified varies as a function of both the number and the value of the per spectives that come into play when engaged in justification. As Nietzsche puts the matter in GM: But precisely because we seek knowledge, let us not be ungrateful to such resolute reversals of accustomed perspectives and valuations... to want to see differently, is no small discipline and preparation of the intellect for its future "objectivity"? the latter understood not as "contemplation without interest" (which is a nonsensical absurdity), but as the ability to control one's Pros and Cons and to dispose of them, so that one knows how to employ a variety of perspectives and affective interpre tations in the service of knowledge_There is only a perspective seeing, only a perspective "knowing"; and the more affects we allow to speak about one thing, the more eyes, different eyes, we can use to observe one thing, the more complete will our "concept" of this thing, our "objectivity," be. (111:12) Nietzsche need not advocate that justification consists only in adding up available perspectives and announcing that since we have considered fifteen contexts in which a statement is true, the statement is therefore justified. Some perspectives are true but irrelevant, some are relevant but false, and some are relevant but uninteresting. The passage just quoted is illuminating for another reason. Note what Nietzsche says?"the more affects we allow to speak about one thing, the more eyes, differ ent eyes, we can use to observe one thing, the more complete will our 'concept' of this thing, our' objectivity,' be." He is clearly not restricting knowledge to what can be gained through visual perception, for he speaks of more eyes and differ ent eyes. Rather, he is suggesting, first and obviously, that all of the perceptual modalities?vision, audition, gustation, olfaction, and touch?provide us with beliefs about objects and, second and not so obviously, that all of the affective states?emotion, evaluation, moods, and qualia?also provide us with beliefs about objects. Indeed, without the latter claim, Nietzsche's perspectivism cannot get off the ground, for it is the affectivity of conscious and unconscious experi ence that provides the foundation of the interest-relativity of perspectives. This is one of the many places where Nietzsche's views are at complete odds with the philosophical tradition, which has always emphasized, first, the need for</page><page sequence="10">32 Rex Welshon disinterested, pure reason in the pursuit of knowledge and, second, the corruption of knowledge that introducing perspectival interests (self-interested and other wise) is supposed to entail. For Nietzsche, expecting there to be a disinterested pursuit of knowledge or expecting the output of pure reason's exercise to be knowledge is absurd. It is a "demand that we should think of an eye that is com pletely unthinkable, an eye turned in no particular direction, in which the active and interpreting forces, through which alone seeing becomes seeing something, are supposed to be lacking" (GM 111:12). Nietzsche's positive claims, quoted above, immediately follow this passage. Hence, it is apparent that multiplying affective responses to the world, cultivating and refining them, comparing one to the others, discarding some while highlighting others depending on context, and being able, as he succinctly puts it, to "control one's Pros and Cons" are constitu tive of knowledge acquisition and justification. For the great variety of affective responses to the objects of the world maps to the variety of perspectives required for our beliefs to be justified (for further discussion, see Poellner 2001). The perspectival nature of justification helps us understand Nietzsche's ambiv alent attitude toward the science of his day (for additional analyses ofNietzsche's relation to science, see, among others, Clark 1990; Cox 1998; Moore 2002; Richardson 2004; Schacht 1983). It is certainly true that science is preferable to many other perspectives?religion and morality in particular?but Nietzsche has a number of complaints about science that entail that it cannot be uniquely privileged over every other kind of knowledge. One criticism is directed against scientists themselves, focusing on their character flaws. Scientists myopically root around in their specialties, digging "quietly under their molehills" (D 41), blissfully uncritical about the value of their work and never connecting it to the larger personal and social contexts in which it occurs. This trait distinguishes scientists from philosophers, for whom nothing is impersonal (BGE6). A second, more serious complaint is that scientists are ascetics. The ascetic ideal is a kind of self-mortifying decadence. Nietzsche argues in GM that the unquestioned faith in the value of truth found in science makes truth a stand-in divinity for God after he has died. Truth becomes the object to which all sacrifices must be made; hence, scientists are humble in the face of the truth, and by suppressing their desires in order to devote their lives to their research, their labs, and their books, they live a life of chastity and poverty, reminiscent of priests. Thus is the practice of science a practical asceticism. Nietzsche also complains about science itself. It is, for example, mistakenly governed by a set of mechanistic principles that are false (see, for example, GS 373). Now, to the extent that science reduces to mechanism, to that extent this criticism is sound. However, one might think that since mechanism was more widespread in the nineteenth century than it is now, this criticism is not as relevant now as then. But this glib response misses Nietzsche's more trenchant objection, which is to reductionism in science, the view that we can identify fundamental</page><page sequence="11">Saying Yes To Reality 33 categories and explain everything in terms of them (see especially Cox 1998). If anything, reductionism in science has accelerated since the nineteenth century. If you doubt it, simply review the last hundred years of psychology. Until the so-called cognitive revolution in the 1960s, the most widespread theoretical framework in psychology was reductionist behaviorism, according to which the domain of psychology was exhausted by observable behavior. Behaviorism was in turn replaced by computationalism, according to which all cognition was a kind of computation. Computationalism is now also thought by most to be false, since computers are qualitative zombies and we are not. There is something that our psychology has?phenomenological character to our experiences?that comput ers lack. But we still have not learned the Nietzschean lesson, for there are now two new reductionist trends in psychology: cognitive neuroscience, according to which a psychological phenomenon is reducible to neural activity, and evolution ary psychology, according to which a psychological phenomenon is reducible to survival value. Again, Nietzsche's larger point that science is routinely blinkered and self-interested seems to be forgotten again and again. Of course, that no reductionist proposal captures everything in psychology does not entail that none of them captures anything in psychology. Psychological states certainly are emergent from electrochemical neural activity, that activity is caused by and causes overt behavior, and its ongoing functioning is crucial for survival. Nietzsche acknowledges as much. We find numerous passages through out Nietzsche's work employing biological and evolutionary explanations (for discussion, see especially Moore 2002; Richardson 2004). However, although neural activity may be the mechanism that realizes psychological activity, it is just laughable to think that our psychology is nothing more than neural activity. Our psychology has also been infiltrated by at least two thousand years worth of the resentment and decadence found in the slave revolt. And even when, thanks to genealogical investigation, we acknowledge the myriad ways that the slave revolt has oozed into the darkest and least-known crannies of our own character, it is going to take a lot more than genealogy to treat its long-lasting and poisonous effects. Nietzsche's perspectival contextualism underwrites both what can be done now to address the infection and what must wait until the acute phase of the disease has been treated. First, it warrants the use of genealogy as a method for taking the lid off of our fetid interior life so that we can assess the interleav ing of decadence and resentment in the composition of our debased character. As Nietzsche predicts, this is a project that will take some time and requires from the investigators "discipline of the heart [that] permits access to many and contradictory modes of thought" (HH P:4). While this project is ongoing, nihilism is a real threat. Second, it justifies the development of various life affirming strategies that will staunch further infection. Third (and perhaps dis coverable only after the progress of the disease has been stopped and more fully</page><page sequence="12">34 Rex Welshon understood), we will need to develop alternative epistemological perspectives on the world and on ourselves that are characterized by the "formative, curative, molding restorative forces" (HHVA) that are the hallmarks of health. Just as Nietzsche's contextualist perspectivism underwrites including the results of numerous scientific disciplines in our efforts to gain knowledge about ourselves and the world, so too it warrants acknowledging the contributions of science as a whole. Nietzsche need not deride perspectives such as science as utterly worthless; rather, he need only insist that they are not the only perspec tive to take on a subject and that perspectives other than science may enrich our knowledge, and hence, our lives, in different ways. Science is a much bet ter perspective than religion, which conjoins a pathological fear of reality and truth with a tyrant's unilateral imposition of his will that that fear be law, but it still carries the vapors of religion with it in its faith in universality and absolute truth, a point made clearly in GS: "We see that science also rests on a faith; there is simply no science 'without presuppositions.' The question whether truth is needed must not only have been affirmed in advance, but affirmed to such a degree that the principle, the faith, the conviction finds expression: 'Nothing is needed more than truth, and in relation to it everything else has only second-rate value'" (344). From Nietzsche's contextualist perspective, the scientist's faith in truth is a necessary self-deception: given the corrupted state of the scientist's character, he must have faith in something universal in order to start his ques tioning. That something?truth?is not only an immediate advance over other objects of faith; its pursuit will in turn lead both to questioning what it is and investigating whether it has the value it is assumed by science to have. Nietzsche may thus admire a number of things about science without inconsistency. The scientific method, for example, produces the mental "hygiene" (HH635) essential forwarding off superstition and for taking religion and philosophy on. (The fate of the scientific method is a source of some of Nietzsche's greatest sorrow, for, as he sees the matter, it was firmly established two thousand years ago in Greek and Roman culture and then was "sucked dry" by the "covert ressentimenf of Christianity [A 59]. What the Romans recog nized, and what we Nietzscheans "have won back for ourselves today with an unspeakable amount of self-constraint" [A 59], is the rediscovery of the Greek scientific method.) Scientific methods of close observation, hypothesis testing, data confirmation, and rigorous analysis are, he thinks, "essential, as well as being the most difficult, as well as being that which has habit and laziness against it longest" (A 59). Moreover, since it studies only the apparent world, science does not mistakenly divide the world into the "real" and apparent world. So that bit of nonsense can be tossed once and for all. And since its domain is only natural phenomena, science is also nonmoral, and in that way it is beyond good and evil. That is why dogmatic moralists and religious types attack science, as Nietzsche repeatedly points out, perhaps no more colorfully than in The Antichrist: "It is</page><page sequence="13">Saying Yes To Reality 35 all over with priests and gods if man becomes scientific!?Moral: science is the forbidden in itself?it alone is forbidden. Science is the first sin, the germ of all sins, original sin" (48). Nietzsche is in fact so enamored of scientific method that he applies it to his own kind, the free spirits who are, as he is, trying to understand and overcome our shared cultural heritage of decadence and resentment: "But we, we others who thirst after reason, are determined to scrutinize our experiences as severely as a scientific experiment?hour after hour, day after day. We ourselves wish to be our experiments and guinea pigs" (GS 319). In this way, particular features of science?its emphasis on experimentation and discovery?become constitu tive of the free spirit's own character and response to life. With the emergence of science and its appropriately free-spirited practice comes the possibility of discovering the world and ourselves for the first time. As he puts it: "Let us introduce the refinement and rigor of mathematics into all sciences as far as this is at all possible, not in the faith that this will lead us to know things but in order to determine our human relation to things. Mathematics is merely the means for general and ultimate knowledge of man" (GS 246). In short, by making all sciences as rigorous and refined as mathematics, we better understand our per spective on?our relation to?things in the world, and that in turn leads to a better understanding of ourselves. This science is, as is all knowledge, a "regulative fiction" (GS 344). We shape our world and henceforth come to know it, and we know ourselves as inhabitants of the world made calculable by us for us. Perspectivist Truth, Relativism, and Paradox Perspectivism is most notoriously a view about truth. As with justification, perspectivist truth is an alternative to the other popular contenders for a theory of truth: the correspondence, coherence, and pragmatic theories. Recent scholar ship has reached consensus that, despite saying things that are consistent with coherence theories and pragmatic theories, Nietzsche's considered view of truth does not fit comfortably into either camp (Clark 1990; Cox 1998; Hales and Welshon 2000; Richardson 1996). Perspectivist truth is most reasonably inter preted as an alternative to the correspondence theory of truth. Truth perspectiv ism (I will call it alethic perspectivism from here on) is simply stated: the truth of a statement is indexed, or relative, to a perspective. But, as with perspectival contextualism about justification, Nietzsche's alethic perspectivism allows that for all statements s, s is true in one perspective P and false in another perspec tive P\ So, adding alethic perspectivism to perspectival contextualism, we can derive Nietzsche's perspectivism about knowledge: a statement s is perspectiv ally known whenever s is believed, s is true in a perspective, and s is justified in a perspective.</page><page sequence="14">36 Rex Welshon The relativistic implications of Nietzsche's alethic perspectivism are obvious and immediate. If truth is relative to a perspective, then it appears that any statement whatsoever is true, so long as it is affirmed by someone and is true in his or her perspective. Reactions to the relativistic consequences of Nietzsche's alethic perspectivism have varied enormously across interpreters. On the one hand, some Nietzsche scholars and other intellectuals claim that Nietzsche's alleged relativism is a precursor to certain trends in contemporary philosophy, literature, and political theory. For these interpreters and intellectu als, the metanarratives and rationalist commitments of traditional philosophical projects must be jettisoned, and Nietzsche's alethic perspectivism seems to them to be the philosophical theory of truth that best captures their skepticism about the tradition (for examples, see the essays collected in Allison 1977 and Koelb 1990). Others argue that despite Nietzsche being a relativist about both truth and justification, his epistemic relativism need not be in the least bit damaging to either truth or knowledge. For even if alethic perspectivism indexes truth to perspectives, there may be (in fact, as argued below, there must be) statements that are true across perspectives, and this permits Nietzsche to reject the pernicious relativist conclusion that every truth is as true as the next. And even if justification is also indexed to a context or perspective, again there may be cross-perspectival justification practices that can be submitted to cross-perspectival adjudication, thus undermining queasiness about metanar ratives. So, again, Nietzsche's perspectivism, while relativistic, is consistent with the rejection of the claim that every reason for believing something is as good as the next. Objections to Nietzsche's alethic perspectivism are likely to come from the opposite end of the spectrum as well. If he is right, then it appears that there can be no absolute truth of any kind; but, one might be inclined to argue, there are absolute truths about at least some things; so, Nietzsche's truth perspectivism is wrong. Nietzsche has an excellent rejoinder to this kind of criticism. If "absolute truth" refers to statements that are true outside of any human perspective, then he will readily stick to his guns and insist that there is no absolute truth, for he denies that there are any such extraperspectival truths. However, being true outside of all human perspectives is not the same as being true across all human perspec tives. Statements true across all human perspectives would, even on Nietzsche's truth perspectivism, be instances of absolute truths. Whether there are any such truths is a matter of debate. Nietzsche flirts with the idea that some statements of logic are candidates (BGE 4; WP 522), but he persistently denies that there are many other candidates, and the statements offered up by philosophers are almost certainly not among them. Over the years, a number of Nietzsche interpreters have struggled with what has been called the "paradox of perspectivism" (Clark 1990; Gemes 1992; Poellner 1997). It is not really a paradox, for a paradox is a sentence that cannot,</page><page sequence="15">Saying Yes To Reality 37 on pain of violating a law of logic, be true. Rather, the problem that perspectivism really faces is a dilemma: perspectivism appears never to be true, and as such it is self-defeating. A simple version of the problem is stated thusly: if perspectivism is always true, then there is at least one statement?perspectivism?that is absolutely true. If so, then absolutism is true and perspectivism is false. On the other hand, if perspectivism is perspectively true, then sometimes it is false, and where it is false, absolutism is true. Again, absolutism is true and perspectiv ism is false. Either way, it appears that perspectivism is never true. The simple version does not keep distinct the difference between "perspec tivism" being used and being mentioned, so it is not sufficiently precise. Recently, I have been tinkering again with the argument and believe that the version below is, because it is more streamlined, preferable to the versions that Hales and I have published previously. We begin by defining absolutism and perspectivism: Absolutism = df There is at least one statement that is true across all perspectives Perspectivism = df It is not the case that there is at least one statement that is true across all perspectives Note that, as defined, if absolutism is true, perspectivism is false. We make this a lemma for the argument: Lemma: If absolutism is true, then perspectivism is false With these matters in hand, we state an explicit version of the dilemma facing perspectivism: PI: Perspectivism is either perspectivally or absolutely true (premise) P2: Perspectivism is perspectivally true (PI, assumption for proof) P3: If perspectivism is perspectivally true, then there is a perspective P such that perspectivism is false in P (df. of perspectivism) P4: There is a perspective P such that perspectivism is false in P (P3, P2) P5: If there is a perspective P such that perspectivism is false in P, then there is at least one statement s that is true across all perspectives (premise) P6: If there is at least one statement s that is true across all perspectives, then absolutism is true (df. of absolutism) P7: If absolutism is true, then perspectivism is false (Lemma) IC1: If perspectivism is perspectivally true, then perspectivism is false (P2-P7) P8: Perspectivism is absolutely true (PI, assumption for proof) P9: If perspectivism is absolutely true, then all perspectives P are such that perspectivism is true in P (df. of absolutism) P10: If all perspectives P are such that perspectivism is true in P, then there is at least one statement s that is true across all perspectives (premise) PI 1: If there is at least one statement s that is true across all perspectives, then absolutism is true (P6 reiteration) PI 2: If absolutism is true, then perspectivism is false (Lemma) IC2: If perspectivism is absolutely true, then perspectivism is false (P8-P12) IC3: If perspectivism is either perspectivally or absolutely true, then perspectivism is false (P2-IC1, P8-IC2) C: Perspectivism is false (IC3, PI)</page><page sequence="16">38 Rex Welshon The argument has the form of a dilemma: assume a disjunction and show that on either disjunct the same result follows, thereby establishing that result. The argument is, therefore, valid. If the argument fails, it must be because one or more of the premises is false. But which one is it? The only contentious premises are P5 and PI 0?the rest either are derived directly from definitions or are direct inferences from other premises. So, if there are problems with the argument, they will likely attach to P5 's claim that if perspectivism is false in a perspective, then there is at least one statement that is true across all perspectives, or to PlO's claim that if perspectivism is true in all perspectives, then there is at least one statement that is true across all perspectives. Doubts about PI 0 are immediately resolved by noting that the statement that is true across all perspectives if perspectivism is true across all perspectives is none other than the statement of perspectivism itself. P5 is another matter: doubts about it can be generated by noting that in the antecedent, it is hypothesized that perspectivism?a metalinguistic statement about the behavior of the truth predi cate of a language?is false in a perspective, whereas in the consequent, it is not this metalinguistic statement but only some other statement that is true across all perspectives. This difference may suggest that since the referent of the antecedent is distinct from the referent of the consequent, there must be something fishy with the premise. However, brief reflection will show that, even if there is a reference shift, nonetheless if the antecedent is true, then so too is the consequent. If, as the antecedent claims, perspectivism is false in some perspective P, then there is at least one statement in P that is true across all perspectives. It cannot be the thesis of perspectivism itself, of course, so it must be some other statement. Nietzsche offers few clues as to which kind of statement might qualify, but then he may not have thought it necessary to do so. Nevertheless, the consequent is, as claimed, true if the antecedent is true, so P5 is, as claimed, true. Given that all of the premises are true and the argument is valid, the dilemma of perspectivism is a real problem for alethic perspectivism. One implication is that since perspectivism is never true, Nietzsche is compelled to accept the existence of at least one statement that is absolutely true, that is, he is compelled to accept the existence of at least one statement that is true across all perspec tives. Perhaps perspectivism itself is that lone statement, the only absolute truth; perhaps a handful of other statements are also absolutely true. Despite hand wringing from some who remain convinced that Nietzsche cannot tolerate even one statement that is true across all perspectives, no great damage to Nietzsche's overall perspectivist view of truth results from admitting that some statements are absolutely true (in fact, as Hales [1997] has shown, one can dress this revised Nietzschean view up in the language of a model-theoretic definition of relativist truth that is provably consistent). A number of Nietzsche interpreters remain unconvinced that there is a dilemma or that the only way to solve it is to accept the existence of at least</page><page sequence="17">Saying Yes To Reality 39 some absolute truths. Some interpreters do whatever is possible to avoid attributing even a single absolute truth to Nietzsche. One suggestion is that Nietzsche has no positive theory of truth of any kind. If so, then since he does not advocate perspectival truth as a positive proposal, that it is self-defeating is moot. Gemes (1992) and Cox (1998) advocate this approach. Another way to avoid the problems of perspectivism is to distinguish various Nietzschean truth projects from one another and then to stratify them into levels. Adopt this approach and the problems posed by perspectivism can be relegated to a lower level of analysis that is resolved at some higher level of analysis. A number of interpreters try this approach (Nola 1987; Schacht 1983,1999). Third, one can take the argument for the self-defeating implication of perspectivism on directly and try to refute it. Nehamas (1985) tries this tack, arguing that the self-defeating conclusion follows only by using what is possibly true against what is actually true. Three other assessments?by Clark (1990), Poellner (1997, 2001), and Anderson (1999)?allow that Nietzsche proposes a theory of truth and that the dilemma of perspectivism poses a threat to Nietzsche's epistemological project. All three authors argue that Nietzsche's alethic perspectivism is best understood within the context of his rejection of Kant's metaphysical commitment to the thing-in-itself. So, speaking loosely, they agree that Nietzsche's alethic per spectivism is similar to Kant's views on truth were those views stripped of the noumenal world of the thing-in-itself. The three part ways on the implications of a stripped-down Kant. Clark interprets Nietzsche's alethic perspectivism as a version of the semantic theory of truth, according to which the behavior of the truth predicate is exhausted by the set of sentences for a language of the following form: 'V is true iff s. This minimal theory of truth is perspectivist because it is inconsistent with the falsification thesis, which is the claim that all of our statements distort and falsify reality. The argument for these claims and criticism of the approach are too complex to review here (for criticism, see Hales and Welshon 2000). Poellner emphasizes the practicality of human interests that help constitute perspectives, thus distinguishing Nietzsche's alethic perspectivism from Kant's phenomenal truth. Whereas Kant acknowledged that phenomenal reality is con stituted by the cognitive frameworks determined by the categories and forms of intuition, Poellner interprets Nietzsche's alethic perspectivism as a view that individuates perspectives not just by cognitive requirements but by the myriad theoretical, explanatory, and otherwise pragmatic requirements that go into determining the content of a perspective. Thus, a statement from, say, econom ics might be true in a perspective constituted in part by a senator's political considerations but false in a perspective constituted differently, in part, say, by a nongovernmental aid agency representative speaking in Haiti. Perhaps the most radical interpretation of Nietzsche's alethic perspectivism is that by Anderson (1999). He argues that there are actually two senses of the</page><page sequence="18">40 Rex Welshon word truth at work in Nietzsche's mature work. The first sense of truth is the correspondence sense of "truth" : "s" is true iff "s" corresponds to s, where "s" is some sentence or statement that affirms that such and such is the case and "s" is the state of affairs or fact that makes V true. Crucially for Anderson, the objects and properties constituent of a state of affairs are mind-independent. Since the mind-independence of objects and properties is a Kantian residuum that Nietzsche abandons, there can be no correspondence to them and the cor respondence theory of truth collapses. Anderson argues that in its place Nietzsche recommends an account of truth on which truth reduces to meeting epistemic standards. On this second sense of truth, truth becomes an ordinal property of sentences and statements: some statements are truer than other statements because they satisfy our epistemic standards better than those others. While I concur that perspectival truth can be developed to admit ordinality, I do not think that Nietzsche holds that truth reduces to meeting our epistemic standards. As against Anderson, I think that Nietzsche maintains the distinction between truth and justification and that alethic perspectivism does not reduce to justificatory perspectivism, that is, that alethic perspectivism is distinct from perspectival contextualism. Directions for Future Work The last thirty years of Nietzsche scholarship have been remarkably productive andhave successfully?one hopes permanently?dispelled the philosopher's bad reputation. The contentious disagreements between analytic and postmodernist Nietzscheans from the 1980s and early 1990s have likewise thankfully sputtered out. Most of those disagreements were tempests in the same teapot anyway?as far as I can tell, Nietzsche is as much one as he is the other. In the last fifteen years, Nietzsche scholarship has reached new levels of detailed historical and philosophical analysis and argumentative rigor. Scholarship on his epistemo logical views is no exception. While we still await the definitive monograph on Nietzsche's investigations into and assessment of knowledge, the abundance of articles in numerous j ournals leaves no doubt that his epistemological reflections are remarkably sophisticated, nuanced, and prescient of many contemporary discussions. Some areas of Nietzsche scholarship on his epistemological views are cur rently enjoying lively disagreement, and other areas are currently underexplored. That means there is plenty of work for Nietzsche scholars to keep us busy. Consider the following: 1. Some of the interpretations of Nietzsche's alethic perspectivism?for example, Clark's and Anderson's?are inconsistent with one another : Clark</page><page sequence="19">Saying Yes To Reality 41 argues that Nietzsche accepts, and Anderson argues that he rejects, the correspondence theory of truth. If they mean the same thing by "corre spondence theory of truth," one of these has got to be wrong. Further work is certainly needed here to resolve the disagreement. In particular, it seems to me that a review article on the many and incompatible interpretations of Nietzsche's alethic perspectivism written with an eye to dismantling some of the disagreements is overdue. 2. Naturalizing Nietzsche is an ongoing and long-term project with many dif ferent strands of investigation to pursue. Cox's Nietzsche: Naturalism and Interpretation identifies a general framework for such work. Richardson's Nietzsche s New Darwinism, Moore's Nietzsche, Biology, and Metaphor, and Leiter's Nietzsche and Morality (2002) are specific tokens of the type, while Acampora's A Nietzschean Bestiary (Acampora and Acampora 2004) is a related collection of articles on animal imagery in Nietzsche's Zarathustra. But there is much more work to be done on this score. For example, extended critical treatments of Nietzsche's naturalistic views on the following (to name just four) are either severely underrepresented or absent altogether: (i) knowledge and truth, (ii) the emotions, (iii) the mind and consciousness, and (iv) science. 3. Detailed investigations into specific components of Nietzsche's episte mological views can only advance our understanding. Not surprisingly, Nietzsche's rejection of the thing-in-itself, his lampooning of the "real" world, his advocacy of alethic perspectivism, and his alleged relativism receive the lion's share of scholarly attention. Such investigations should of course continue. But there are other, currently underexplored, regions to investigate: (i) the psychology of belief; (ii) the role of emotions and other affective states in knowledge acquisition and justification; (iii) the role of logic, if any, in knowledge acquisition and justification; and (iv) what a Nietzschean science without absolute truths looks like. Other projects need attention as well, but they are not as obviously relevant for understanding Nietzsche's epistemological views as those just listed. It is undeniable that Nietzsche bears part of the blame for the lack of agree ment about the details of his various epistemological projects?he is not the most consistent philosopher or the most precise. I have tried here to provide examples of both areas of wide agreement and areas of narrower disagreement. But the interpretive squabbles that flow from Nietzsche's terminological imprecision are of small importance compared to the consistent interest of what he says about knowledge and our attempts to understand what it is. Maybe Nietzsche is not a great academic epistemologist, but that is one of the reasons he is a better philoso pher than an academic epistemologist can ever hope to be. He insists on turning the soil the epistemologist digs in to expose not only the roots of knowledge but</page><page sequence="20">42 Rex Welshon also the roots of the academic epistemologists' fascination with their peculiar distortion of knowledge. By revealing the academic epistemologists' fear of the very category that their skewed representation purports to describe, Nietzsche exposes a distinctly different way of thinking about knowledge.
