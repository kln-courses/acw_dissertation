<plain_text><page sequence="1">TERMINAL CLASSIC INTERACTION ON THE SOUTHEASTERN MAYA PERIPHERY Rosemary A. Joyce A review of material from Copan, originally assigned a post A.D. 1000 date, suggests the existence of two separate temporal episodes, one a Terminal Classic equivalent. A rare trade ceramicfound in this Copan Terminal Classic and at contemporary Seibal is also present in a ceramic group of Lepa phase (A.D. 625-1000) Quelepa, El Salvador. This identification supports the placement of the Copan material in the Terminal Classic. New data from the Ulua Valley, northwest Honduras, document an extreme southeastern extension of the Terminal Classic Altar Fine Orange ceramic sphere of Seibal. Two networks of interaction linking the southeastern extreme of Mesoamerica and the western Maya area suggested by these ceramic correlations are examined, and the processes involved are discussed. Archaeology of southeastern Mesoamerica (Figure 1) is still in the stage of construction of basic chronologies and exploration of internal and external ties. The problems posed by the sketchy nature of the southeastern archaeological record, characterized by gaps between widely separated, apparently unconnected sequences, are exacerbated for time periods that are ill-understood throughout Me- soamerica, such as the transition from Late Classic to Early Postclassic. Classic period material tends to overshadow that of the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic. Inter-regional dynamics are generally described by reference to vague trends of "militarism," "Mexicanization," or cultural collapse (cf. Baudez 1970; Glass 1966). Only when finer-grained chronologies and regional sequences are well known, as in the Seibal-Altar de Sacrificios area (cf. Adams 1973; Rands 1973; Sabloff 1973) can more detailed models be suggested. As a result of my recent research at the site of Cerro Palenque in the Valle del Ulua of northwest Honduras, I was led to re-examine the published account of post-Classic material from Copan (Longyear 1952).' I believe that it includes both a Terminal Classic facet (ca. A.D. 850-1000) and an Early Postclassic facet (A.D. 1000-1250), not simply the latter, as had previously been assumed. Crossdating for the Terminal Classic facet is provided by Delirio red-on-white from Quelepa, El Salvador (Andrews V 1976), previously unidentified at Copan. The same trade ceramic was found in a Terminal Classic context at Seibal (Sabloff 1975) and along with other Quelepa ceramics in Terminal Classic contexts in the Valle del Ulua. This distribution implies the existence of a network of communication through the southern highlands at this crucial late period. In the following sections, I will first review the ceramic evidence for Terminal Classic contem- poraneity and contact between the Classic Maya sites of Seibal and Copan, and the southeastern periphery at Quelepa, El Salvador and in the Ulua Valley. On the basis of this evidence, two distinct spheres of interaction-one, a southern Highland zone, the other a northern coastal zone-will be outlined. Finally, the importance for Honduran archaeology of the development of these distinct spheres in the Classic period and the outcome in the succeeding Early Postclassic of their differ- entiation are discussed.2 Rosemary A.

CERAMIC EVIDENCE Valle del Ulua Cerro Palenque is a 240 m peak, located in the southwest Ulua Valley, where the Rios Blanco, Ulua, and Comayagua unite (Figure 2). Stone (1941) had reported a small architectural complex at the peak of Cerro Palenque. In 1980 and 1981, I encountered and mapped a further 500 structures, extending northward over a series of 40 to 160 m hills. Excavation in 1982 and 1983 demonstrated that the hilltop complex was of the Late Classic (Joyce 1982, 1985). The bulk of the site, the largest single community documented for the Valle del Ulua to date, postdates the Late Classic. Charac- teristic ceramics of the later occupation include jars and bowls with the same forms and surface finish as those of the preceding Late Classic occupation (Joyce 1983). However, the Late Classic Ulua Polychromes were entirely replaced by fine paste, temperless ceramics identical in forms and surface finish to Altar Fine Orange ceramics of the Terminal Classic western Maya periphery (Sabloff 1975). Fine Orange ceramics from the Valle del Ulua, excavated by Strong, Kidder and Paul (1938) at the site of Santa Rita, had been identified by Glass (1966) as a variant of Silho (X) Fine Orange of Early Postclassic date. Sheehy (1982), discussing Fine Paste ceramics he encountered on the Rio Ulua at the site of Travesia, correctly noted the lack of Silho traits and predominance of Altar Fine 314 [Vol. 51, No. 2, 1986</page><page sequence="3">THE SOUTHEASTERN MAYA PERIPHERY Figure 2.

Decoration is limited to incision, molded panels, or occasional red or black bands or washes on a hard, self-slipped surface varying in color from dark orange- brown to buff, rarely pink or gray. The most distinctive form at Cerro Palenque is a low dish, with vertical, exterior rounded walls, tripod "oven-shaped" or bulbous supports, and incised or grooved patterns on the interior base. This is also the only form Glass (1966) describes for the Santa Rita 315 Joyce]</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY a b 12 cm I d Figure 3.

Other major forms are incurved or barrel shaped vases with flat or pedestal bases, collared bowls, hemispherical bowls and small jars (Figure 3). Previous to my recent work at Cerro Palenque, these fine paste materials were known only as late or minor components from Late Classic Ulua Polychrome sites. The Terminal Classic center at Cerro Palenque, with a 150 by 300 m plaza and ballcourt with 67 by 11 m alley, is the heart of a major community constructed and occupied during the Terminal Classic. Constructional fills in both peripheral residential clusters and in the public center included Terminal Classic ceramic diagnostics. The only polychromes recovered, a few eroded sherds found in the ballcourt fill, suggest derivation from the latest (Santana class) Ulua Polychromes (Viel 1978). Despite excavation in six Terminal Classic residential clusters and in the major plaza and ballcourt, no Early Postclassic ceramics, such as Tohil Plumbate or the cream-slipped Las Vegas Polychrome known from Central Honduran sites, were encountered. In attempting to relate this Terminal Classic occupation to the western Lowland Maya focus of the Altar Fine Orange ceramic sphere, I re-examined Longyear's (1952) description of post-Classic remains at Copan, the Classic Maya center closest to the Ulua Valley. 316 [Vol. 51, No. 2, 1986</page><page sequence="5">THE SOUTHEASTERN MAYA PERIPHERY Copan Despite recent archaeological work at Copan, Longyear's ceramic study remains the most appro- priate source for this discussion. As Viel (1983:475) notes, Longyear's basic ceramic sequence of four periods (Archaic, Early Csslassic, Full Classic, and Postclassic) is essentially correct. Viel's more detailed sequence of seven complexes adds Middle Preclassic components and refines Longyear's sequence, but neither materially revises the content nor the suggested chronological placement of Longyear's periods. Longyear's Postclassic, the focus of this discussion, corresponds to Viel's Ejar complex (Viel 1983:476, 500, 538-539, 542). Viel located no new deposits of Ejar material, and his description of Ejar is an abbreviated reference to the most identifiable of Longyear's materials, Tohil Plumbate vessels and "Mixtec" censers from burials. He suggests that these derive from an ephemeral re-occupation of Copan ca. A.D. 900-1200. Fash (1983:198-199) gives dates of A.D. 850-1200 for the same complex, assigning to this period both Longyear's Postclassic material and an activity area associated with Ballcourt B where Plumbate, "possible Fine Orange," projectile points and green obsidian bladelets were deposited along with scavenged Late Classic sculpture fragments. With this exception, the recent Copan excavations have not reported post-Classic con- texts, and provide neither the specific kinds of data nor the range of materials described by Longyear. Longyear's (1952:31, 33-34) Postclassic materials stem from tombs, caches, and living debris. Although usually lumped together, these contexts include two distinct ceramic components. Both were dated by Longyear as post-A.D. 1000 on the basis of a series of Tohil Plumbate effigies, a Mixteca-Puebla censer, and a Nicoya Polychrome effigy found in Tomb 10. This tomb was located 40 m west and 200 m south of the main Acropolis on the river plain. The stone chamber was built with reused stones, and 60 cm of dirt had accumulated in the chamber before interment. Other post-Classic material was found in the Acropolis proper, centered around the East Court (Figure 4). Thirty centimeters of refuse were found on the west terrace of Temple 22, and similar refuse was found in a shaft in Temple 11. At the foot of the stairs from Temple 22 into the East Court was a two vessel cache. Tomb 4-46, on the center line of the East Court, incorporated sculptured stones from Temple 18. Another post-Classic tomb, 1-40, in Mound 7 at the west end of the Court of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, was located in a reused room and yielded whole vessels as well. The refuse at Temple 22 and 11 included coarse brown jars with "combed" (multiple-toothed- instrument incised) designs and red zones. Similar domestic jars, with multiple line incision or red zones or designs, are widespread in Late Classic ceramic complexes of Honduras, for example the Chinda Rouge and Masica Incised of Los Naranjos (Baudez and Becquelin 1973), and coarse ware jars of Full Classic Copan (Longyear 1952; cf. Cruz Inciso, Viel 1983:525). The distinctive incision is featured on complex red-painted and incised jars of the Ulua Valley contemporary with the earliest Ulua Polychromes, but by the Terminal Classic was largely replaced by red linear designs mimicking the earlier incised designs (Joyce 1983). In Central Honduras, the incised decoration reaches a peak at the end of the Classic, persisting into the initial Early Postclassic (Baudez and Becquelin 1973: Table 4; Sheptak 1983b). At Los Naranjos, "Masica Incised" fine-line incised jars are found with Las Vegas Polychrome and "Olingo Polychrome," identified as Ulua Valley fine paste from the type piece in Honduras and published profiles (Baudez and Becquelin 1973:Figure 112). At Copan, the development of the multiple fine-line incision parallels Central Honduras, with separate red-rimmed incised and red-painted jars in the Classic (31% of rims and 48% of bodies, and 42% of rims and 52% of bodies respectively), followed by an increase in red-rimmed incised jars (to 52% of rims) in the post-Classic (Longyear 1952:89-90). Viel (1983:525) notes that Cruz Incised increases steadily in frequency throughout his Classic Period levels. Copan post-Classic jars are part of a Central Honduran Classic jar tradition, distinct from that of the Ulua Valley, with the high proportion of incised decoration consistent with Terminal Classic to initial Early Postclassic placement. Vessels from the Acropolis East Court ceramic cache and Tomb 1-40, some of which are illustrated (Longyear 1952:Figures 102e, j, 1 1Oe, and 117d) provide another basis for chronological placement of the Copan Acropolis post-Classic. Some may tentatively be identified as Fine Orange. Tomb 1- Joyce] 317</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY R!o N\-" dX^sj J^ Copan 100 m Figure 4.

East Court stair cache, f. East Court Tomb 4-46, g. Temple 16. 40 included a globular orange-ware bowl (unillustrated) with horizontal and vertical light grooves, a technique found on Altar Fine Orange ceramics at Seibal. A restricted-aperture orange-ware vase, from the Temple 22 stairway cache, with a straight collar defined by an incised line (Longyear 1952: Figure 102j), was previously noted as a possible Fine Orange vessel by Glass (1966). An Altar Fine Orange Modelled-Carved vessel, from Guastatoya near San Agustin Acasaguastlan, in the Motagua Valley, has the same restricted-neck, vertical-collared vase form as the Copan East Court cache orange-ware vessel, strengthening the suggested identification of the latter as Fine Orange (Villacorta 1941). In the Museo Nacional in Tegucigalpa, a Fine Orange vessel of the same form occurs in unprovenienced collections of material from the Ulua Valley. A second vessel from Tomb 1-40, in the Copan Museum, duplicates the form and decoration of a Fine Orange vessel found cached in Terminal Classic context at Cerro Palenque in 1982. The Copan vessel, an ovoid, incurved rim vase with sublip and mid-shoulder circumferential incised lines, described as an orange-surfaced Plumbate Ware vessel, has been used to support correlation of Acropolis post-Classic material with the Early Postclassic Tohil Plumbate of Tomb 10. Shepard (1948) illustrated this vessel, noting that the shape was unique in her sample of both Tohil and the earlier San Juan Plumbate. In the absence of thin-section analysis of the paste, the status of this vessel within Plumbate cannot be decided. Traits suggesting an early Plumbate dating are the relative simplicity of form and decorative technique and the orange (visually, very light brown) surface 318 [Vol. 51, No. 2, 1986</page><page sequence="7">THE SOUTHEASTERN MAYA PERIPHERY color, which is more common in earlier Plumbate. Late Classic San Juan Plumbate is known from a more restricted range of sites than the Early Postclassic Tohil Plumbate, including San Agustin Acasaguastlan, not far from Copan (Smith and Kidder 1943). The second vessel in the East Court cache duplicates the vertical-neck vase form of the orange- ware vase of Tomb 1-40 in red-on-cream (Longyear 1952:Figure 102e). An armadillo effigy is created with red-brown painted designs on a thin burnished cream slip, and modeled features emphasized in red. The vessel (Figure 5a) has a 12 cm rim diameter and is 18 cm tall. Tomb 1-40 contained a rounded base bowl of the same red-on-cream ware (Figure 5b), whose dimensions are not recorded, associated with the unique Plumbate vessel described earlier. It is unclear whether any sherds of the same type were found in the Temple 22 refuse. Longyear reported no known duplicates for the type, although the armadillo effigy form inspired him to suggest a southern, Central American source. Subsequently, identical vessels were found associated with Fine Orange ceramics at Seibal. Seibal Sabloff(l 975:224-225), like Longyear before him, was unable to locate a source, or any occurrence other than at Copan, for similar red-on-cream ceramic armadillo effigies. One bowl (Figure 5c) with a 22 cm rim diameter, identical in shape to that in Tomb 1-40 at Copan, has a lustrous cream slip and thin, dark red overslip or paint that match Longyear's description. The red-on-cream ceramic was found in two Terminal Classic Bayal phase contexts at Seibal: 10-30 cm below the patio of small structure (residential) unit 24; and 20-40 cm below the patio of small structure unit D-44. In order to equate his material with that at Copan, Sabloff had to resolve the apparent contradiction between a Terminal Classic dating at Seibal and an Early Postclassic, Tohil Plumbate date at Copan. He cited Gair Tourtellot to suggest that one of the contexts was perhaps intrusive. Tourtellot (1983: 437) notes that the two instances are both in the correct, eastern location for domestic shrines, and are the only post-Classic ceramics from a construction layer at Seibal. These functional and contextual observations suggest that the red-on-cream ceramics are part of an occupation continuous with the Terminal Classic Bayal phase, not a discontinuous re-occupation. The Seibal Bayal phase (A.D. 830-930) Terminal Classic date conforms to the suggested equation of Copan Acropolis post-Polychrome material with Valle del Ulua Terminal Classic Fine Orange deposits. The identification of the source of the red-on-cream polychrome effigies of Copan and Seibal confirms the temporal equation of all these complexes prior to the Early Postclassic. Quelepa, El Salvador: Delirio Red-on-white Andrews V (1976:114-116) describes Delirio Red-on-white of the Lepa phase (A.D. 625-1000) at Quelepa, El Salvador as a fine paste, hard-polished, white-slipped ceramic with dark red, complex geometric designs. One variety has modeled effigy features, often accentuated with red paint. Forms include a round-based bowl with a mean diameter of 19.4 cm; and a round-based vase or small jar with a mean diameter of 11.8 cm. Illustrated vessels (Andrews V 1976:Figure 134d) closely match the ovoid, round-based jar form of the Copan Acropolis post-polychrome Plumbate and red-on- cream jars, and the Guastatoya Fine Orange vessel. An illustrated sherd (Andrews V 1976:Figure 135h) of the modeled variety exactly matches the Copan and Seibal vessels, with rows of crosshatched diamonds as the "scales" of the armadillo (Figure 5d). A detailed comparison of illustrated motifs and band structure of the Copan, Seibal, and Quelepa material (Figure 6) clearly demonstrates the close parallels. The identification of two spiked incensarios found by Maudsley (1889-1902:1:P1. 22) at Temple 16 of Copan's Acropolis East Court (Figure 4) with Lolotique type censers of Lepa phase Quelepa (Andrews V 1977:127) further supports the existence of Lepa phase ties to post- Classic Copan. If Quelepa itself was not the source of the Copan and Seibal vessels, a site within the same ceramic tradition must have been. Further support for Terminal Classic links with Lepa phase Quelepa is found in the Valle del Ulua. Sheehy (1982) reported Delirio Red-on-white in association with Fine Orange at Travesia. At Cerro Palenque, the Lepa phase type Guayabal White Modelled is represented by an unusual Joyce] 319</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY a b c d F I , I t I 5 cm Figure 5.

It is covered with a glossy hard white slip. An apparent anthro- pomorphic effigy is represented by ears, nose, mouth, coffee bean eyes and eyebrows. Effigies are rare or absent in Ulua Valley ceramics (Joyce 1983), although common on contemporary Central Honduran ceramics of similar surface treatment (cf. Stone 1957). Cerro Palenque's Terminal Classic Fine Paste ceramics otherwise entirely lack a contrasting slip. The vessel form itself, and its di- mensions, are unique at Cerro Palenque but match those indicated for the type at Quelepa, El Salvador (Andrews V 1976). The beginning of the Lepa phase is set at A.D. 625, with a terminus before A.D. 1000 suggested 320 [Vol. 51, No. 2, 1986</page><page sequence="9">THE SOUTHEASTERN MAYA PERIPHERY Figure 6.

Certain Lepa phase trade white-slipped polychrome sherds (Andrews V 1976:Figure 1521r, s), listed as possible Early Postclassic Nicoya or Las Vegas polychrome, can be identified with Tenampua class of the Ulua Polychromes, dating to between A.D. 800 and 950 (Viel 1978). These dates correlate well with Seibal's Bayal phase (A.D. 830-930) and the fine paste Terminal Classic at Cerro Palenque (A.D. 850-950). The Copan Acropolis post-polychrome material described by Longyear, rather than representing a single late phase of transient visits to the site, includes two components. The earlier may best be considered a Terminal Classic temporal equivalent occupation, including con- tinuation of Late Classic practices such as tomb burials with exotic ceramics but lacking the resources for new construction and monumental inscriptions. Beyond the issue of chronology, the identification of Delirio red-on-white at Seibal and Copan aids in the reconstruction of networks of interaction for southern Mesoamerica during the Terminal Classic. The roots of these networks in the Late Classic and their evolved forms in the Early Postclassic can also be traced, and implications for economic and social interaction suggested. INTERACTION NETWORKS Two spheres of interaction in the southern Mesoamerican periphery are indicated by Terminal Classic artifact distributions. One sphere is centered on the southern Highlands of Honduras and El Salvador, with communication east and west through the Highlands. The second, centered on the northern, Caribbean, coast, links the Ulua Valley with Belize and the Maya Lowlands. The differentiation of these two spheres can be traced to the Classic period (Figure 7a). The division between them deepened in the Terminal Classic (Figure 7b). By the Early Postclassic (Figure 7c), a major break between the two spheres of interaction is evident. Central Honduras acted as an interface between the two spheres. In the Classic, Central Honduras was a buffer between Copan to the west and the Ulua Valley to the north. By the Early Postclassic, the primary focus of Central Honduran culture had shifted to the south and east. In the Classic period, communication across the boundary between Central and Northern Hon- duras was a constant, two-way process. The divisive effects of within-sphere integration were mod- ulated by the inclusion of both spheres in interaction within the southern Maya periphery. The stronger involvement of the Terminal Classic Ulua Valley in interaction with the Lowland Maya Boca ceramic sphere marked a break in the integration of the Ulua Polychrome area that had included both Central Honduras and the Ulua Valley. The simultaneous redirection of Central Honduras from a focus on Copan to more viable centers further south completed the divergence of the two spheres in Honduras. Following the Lowland Maya Terminal Classic collapse, the Ulua Valley was left stranded, as were other members of the northern coastal interaction sphere, peripheral to Yucatec culture and locked out of the southern Highland sphere. Central Honduras was fully integrated in the Early Postclassic southern Highland sphere, with only minor cross-ties connecting Central Honduran sites to sites in the Ulua Valley.

Classic Period: Integration Beginning in the Classic period, Ulua Valley ceramics share features with Lowland Maya ceramic complexes, especially those in Belize. They diverge from the complexes of Central Honduras, which do not adopt changes in jar forms seen in the Ulua Valley. Ulua polychromes, especially those of the Ulua Valley, parallel Lowland Maya polychromes in their suite of forms, including the cyinder form. In designs and their sequence, they are remarkably close to the polychromes of Altun Ha, Belize (Pendergast 1979). The southern, Highland sphere in the Classic period included Copador polychrome sites, such as Copan and Chalchuapa, El Salalvador (Sharer 1978). Copador Polychrome contrasts markedly in forms with Ulua and Lowland Maya Polychrome, there being a virtual absence of cylinders and a greater number of bowl forms and small jars. Central Honduras, sharing the Ulua Polychrome tradition of the North Coast, acted as an interface between the two spheres in the Classic (cf. Figure 7a). Copador Polychrome is present as a trade ceramic in Central Honduran sites (Baudez 1966, 1973:294-295; Stone 1957:42), but not in the Ulua Valley, where the forms and themes of Copador are occasionally executed with Ulua Poly- chrome technology. The cylinder form, rare in Copador, is represented at Copan by Ulua Polychrome cylinders of Central Honduran type, which feature themes of seated profile humans like those of Copador Polychrome (Viel 1978:232-234, 281; cf. Longyear 1952:Figure 109h). In contrast, Ulua Polychrome bowls and cylinders of the Ulua Valley appear more varied and closer in layout and themes to Lowland Maya models, especially as exemplified by Altun Ha (Pendergast 1979:Figures 32n, 34c, d, and 37c). The maintenance of connections between the Ulua Valley and Central Honduras, indicated by the development of polychrome cylinders in Central Honduras and of Copador imitations in the Ulua Valley, was part of a process that counteracted the tendency towards divergence of the two spheres. Both ceramic and non-ceramic materials are found distributed across the boundary between the two spheres. Exotic ceramics, when from primary context, are often funerary, cached, or simply 323 Joyce]</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY limited to elite residential complexes and civic-religious centers (cf. comments on the Ulua-Yojoa Polychromes at Copan in Viel 1983:526). Non-ceramic materials are equally often exotics showing limited distribution within sites. For example, the pattern of distribution for Late Classic Pacific Spondylus and jade-bead caches further documents communication between the two spheres. These two materials stem from re- stricted sources. The natural range of the shell is interrupted between Oaxaca and Acajutla, El Salvador, relatively close to the Chalchuapa Archaeological Zone (Feldman 1974). The jade beads are presumed to stem from Middle Motagua workshops such as those at Guaytan-San Agustin Acasaguatlan (Feldman et al. 1975; Walters 1980). Copan, Lake Amatitlan in the Guatemala Highlands, and Tenampua in Central Honduras share the use of Spondylus as a container for Motagua jade beads and other substances, especially pearls and cinnabar (deBorhegyi 1966; Longyear 1952; Stone 1957). This cache pattern extends to the northern coastal sphere, at Travesia and Late Classic Cerro Palenque in the Ulua Valley, Pusilha, Altun Ha and San Jose, Belize, Tikal and Piedras Negras (Andrews IV 1969; Joyce 1985; Pendergast 1979; Stone 1941; Thompson 1939). The shell alone is noted at Guaytan, Uaxactun, and Isla Jaina (Andrews IV 1969; Feldman 1974). Andrews IV (1969:43) remarks that the bulk of shell in the southeastern Maya area was imported from the "more distant Pacific ocean." The heavy incidence of these shells in Belize may indicate the route of contact between the southern Highland sphere and the Peten in the Classic, indirectly through the northern coastal sphere. Despite the differentiation of the two spheres, integration of both within a Late Classic southern Maya region maintained connections between them, especially evident in the flow of rare goods throughout both spheres. Terminal Classic: Divergence In the Terminal Classic, communication between the two spheres was de-emphasized as the integration of the Classic Maya zone fragmented, and internal organization of the two spheres shifted radically. Terminal Classic artifact distributions (Figure 7b) emphasize the discontinuity between the northeastern coastal and southeastern highland spheres in Honduras. Ulua Marble Vases, which developed in the Late Classic, are found in Terminal Classic contexts at Uaxactun (Kidder 1947), San Jose (Thompson 1939), and Altun Ha, Belize (Pendergast 1967). San Jose and Uaxactun also have Altar Fine Orange ceramics, while San Jose domestic ceramics share a number of forms and surface treatments with contemporary Ulua Valley domestic ceramics. Terminal Classic ceramic complexes of Seibal and the Ulua Valley include a range of forms filling all serving vessel categories, in both true temperless ceramics and local fine paste, tempered "imitations." The replacement of Ulua Polychromes by Fine Orange forms, and the addition of traits like those of Seibal ceramics to Ulua Valley tempered ceramics, documents a shift in the focus of integration of the northern coastal sphere to the Rio Pasion. Simultaneously, the focus of the southern Highland sphere shifts south, as sites such as Copan decline while Tazumal and other Salvadoran sites continue their development. Pre-Tohil Plumbate is limited, outside the probable origin zone in southwest Guatemala, to Guaytan, Tazumal, Ka- minaljuyu (Shepard 1948), and possibly Copan. The southern Highland sphere lacks elite centers whose major ceramic tradition is Fine Orange. The majority of Terminal Classic Fine Orange vessels found in the southern sphere may be described as Pabellon Modelled-Carved of the Altar Fine Orange group, a member of a class of decorated types that recent research suggests was spread by trade from the Rio Pasion, where Seibal is located (Rands et al. 1982). Pabellon Modelled-Carved has been identified at Chalchuapa, El Salvador (Sharer 1978) and the San Agustin Acasaguastlan area (Smith and Kidder 1943:Figure 19e). The circulation of Pabellon Modelled-Carved in the Highland sphere is independent of the spread of Altar Fine Orange complexes through the north- eastern coastal sphere, although ultimately derived from the same source area. The distribution of Altar Fine Orange through the Highlands from west to east is paralleled by the transmission of Lepa phase Quelepa ceramics (Delirio red-on-white, Guayabal White Modelled, Lolotique Spiked) from east to west, ending at Seibal. 324 [Vol. 51, No. 2, 1986</page><page sequence="13">THE SOUTHEASTERN MAYA PERIPHERY Central Honduras, with the decline of Copan, ceased to interact with the Ulua Valley. Ulua Polychromes, abandoned in the northern sphere, continued to develop in the Comayagua Valley of Central Honduras. The addition of a second, white, slip, and periform shapes, in the Tenampua class of the Ulua Polychromes suggests influence from the white slipped polychrome traditions of Costa Rica and eastern El Salvador, where Tenampua polychrome sherds are present at Quelepa, documenting an eastern focus of the southern sphere in the Terminal Classic. Early Postclassic: Separation The outcome of this division and refocusing is clear in the Early Postclassic period (Figure 7c). White-slipped, geometric polychromes with periform shapes dominate the southern sphere. The Early Postclassic Las Vegas Polychrome of Central Honduras evolved from Tenampua Polychrome, with the substitution of white for orange slip, addition of periform vessels and motifs typical of Costa Rican Papagayo Polychrome (Baudez and Becquelin 1973; Viel 1978). Similar white-slipped polychrome is noted from Tazumal and Copan Tomb 10. Tohil Plumbate, with the same periform shape, spread throughout the area. A distinctive Tohil Plumbate effigy form whose distribution is mainly Salvadoran and Honduran defines the southern Highland sphere. These anthropomorphic effigies, including that of Copan Tomb 10, have coffee-bean features and overlapping disc orna- mentation rare in Guatemala (Shepard 1948). Stone (1941) illustrates similar ceramic effigies from northeast coastal Honduras where Early Postclassic complexes include Tohil Plumbate, Bay Islands Polychrome with periform shapes and motifs similar to Nicoya Papagayo Polychrome, and copper. Copper often accompanies the Early Postclassic ceramics of the southern sphere, and may have spread east from the same center of origin as Plumbate. Copper, whose earliest occurrence in southern Mesoamerica is in Late Classic Soconusco (Bray 1977), spreads in the Early Postclassic throughout the southern Highlands as far as Tazumal, El Salvador. Early Postclassic complexes of Los Naranjos (Baudez and Becquelin 1973), Las Vegas, Comayagua (Stone 1957), and Gualjoquito, Santa Barbara (Sheptak 1983b) all share Las Vegas Polychrome, Tohil Plumbate, and some use of copper. This contrasts strongly with the Ulua Valley, where initial Early Postclassic fine ceramics at Cerro Palenque continue Terminal Classic fine paste forms and decorations (Joyce 1983). Minimal recip- rocal contacts with the closest sites of the southern Highland sphere are suggested by ceramic and other artifactual evidence. "Olingo Polychrome" at Los Naranjos, on Lake Yojoa just south of the Ulua Valley, includes sherds of Ulua Valley fine paste, and is found in strata with Las Vegas Polychrome (Baudez 1973:Table 4). A single biface of a distinctive form and material found at Cerro Palenque matches ones common at Gualjoquito, Santa Barbara, in an Early Postclassic context with green obsidian, Las Vegas Polychrome, Tohil Plumbate, and copper (Sheptak 1983b). A single copper fishhook in a burial at the site of Las Flores Bolsa on the Ulua River (Strong et al. 1938) is associated with domestic ceramics of the Cerro Palenque initial Early Postclassic.3 Unconfirmed reports of Plumbate on the Ulua River are not localized to the Ulua Valley (Shepard 1948). Stone (1957:34) reported Las Vegas Polychrome at Farm 15 in the southern Ulua Valley, and I have tentatively identified Las Vegas Polychrome sherds from late deposits at Cerro Palenque and Tra- vesia. In no case in the Ulua Valley has an Early Postclassic occupation with fine ceramics of the southern Highland sphere and other contemporary exotics (e.g., green obsidian and copper) in association with a viable public architectural center been reported. The sole major center, Cerro Palenque, apparently declined in the initial Early Postclassic. No rebuilding was undertaken at the major plaza and ballcourt. The site manifests a decrease in all exotic goods, as obsidian declines in frequency and jade and shell are absent. With the collapse of Seibal and the Lowland Maya Terminal Classic Boca sphere, the Ulua Valley lost the external contact to which it had strongly re-oriented, coincident with the decline of Belizean sites that had been earlier foci of northern coastal contacts. The failure of Ulua Valley elite culture to survive after the collapse of the Boca ceramic sphere, as well as the abrupt replacement of local polychromes by local versions of Altar Fine Orange ceramic forms, implies strong integration in the Terminal Classic northern network. Joyce] 325</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY The nature of the materials distributed through the two spheres and their contexts suggest that their integration was primarily accomplished through inter-elite exchange. Such exchange, bringing exotic goods into elite hands, has been examined as a means used by elites to demonstrate and maintain their special status, both as separate from commoners and in competition with other elites (Flannery 1968; Helms 1979). Such an interpretation is consistent with the nature and contexts of these materials, their network-like distributions, and the changing nature of the exact items trans- mitted, as elite networks shift focus through time. It is more difficult to understand the case of Cerro Palenque from this perspective. The anomalous features of the Terminal Classic to Early Postclassic Ulua Valley case include the total replacement of fine ceramics of one kind with those of another, rather than the import of a few prized exotics; the decrease in all exotics present; the change in settlement pattern, featuring the emergence of a single center much larger than any previously known; and the failure of the elite at the site to replace the Boca ceramic sphere ties with others. These observations suggest a different process was operative in this case. The first three characteristics-primate settlement distribution, relative poverty, and wholesale adoption of a foreign pattern of elite life-are found in dendritic economies (Smith 1976). In these economies, a region is intensively exploited, often for an agricultural resource, for a foreign market, by either foreign managers or local managers who identify with the foreign culture. This economic model posits the kind of narrowly focused, monopolistic dependency necessary to make the loss of a single external link lead to a collapse in local organization. A possible basis for such integration could have been distribution west of cacao, which was a central exchange item of the Contract period Ulua Valley (Bergman 1969). The inability of the Ulua Valley to replace the lost Lowland Maya contact with Central Honduran ties in the Early Postclassic might imply that the Central Honduran demand for such products was low, or that Central Honduras had access through the southern network to the same products, in the case of cacao, from Pacific coastal sources. By the Late Postclassic, renewal of the northern coastal sphere linked the Ulua Valley and Yucatan in a network that ethnohistoric analysis (Sheptak 1983a) suggests was again separate from that of greater Honduras with the western Maya area. CONCLUSIONS Archaeological research in Honduras and El Salvador has been dominated by the concept of the area as a cultural frontier (Lothrop 1939), at the same time that Lowland Maya archaeology has clearly documented the degree of heterogeneity in the prehistories of different Classic Maya subzones. While recent discussions of the Formative period have made increasing use of models of interaction spheres and networks of communication like those suggested here, and have explicitly indicated processes involved in these developments, similar discussions of later periods are as yet lacking (cf. Demarest and Sharer 1982). The approach adopted in this article has been to view each of the areas discussed as a potential node on a series of interaction networks. This has resulted in the identification of two broadly contrasting networks, each linking part of the southeastern periphery with part of the Lowland Maya area proper. Along these networks flowed goods and information that served to integrate the areas. The internal structure and processes of the networks changed through time, deepening the divergence of the southern and northern spheres of the southern periphery. Consequently, the effects of the central Maya Terminal Classic collapse were strongly expressed in the Ulua Valley, while adjacent areas of Honduras remained stable and made a transition to an Early Postclassic pattern comparable to that of the Highlands of Guatemala.

University of Missouri- Columbia Museum Brief No. 25. NOTES I would like to acknowledge the benefit of presentations on the ceramic sequence of Copan (not including the Ejar phase, post-classic material) made in Honduras by the Copan Project ceramicist, Dr. Rene Viel. 2 I have examined collections of ceramics spanning the Late Formative through Late Postclassic of the Ulua Valley, and the Late Formative through Early Postclassic ceramics of Gualjoquito, Santa Barbara, as well as Baudez and Becquelin's type collection from Los Naranjos, and a small type collection from Las Vegas, Co- mayagua, while in Honduras. I have relied on published descriptions of the ceramics of Quelepa, El Salvador, in the absence of an opportunity to examine them first-hand. Similarly, the majority of the Copan post-Classic material discussed in this article is evaluated from published descriptions and illustrations. The red-on-cream armadillo bowl from Copan was examined at the Copan museum by Sabloff; when I visited the museum, the only vessel from these contexts on display was the ovoid orange-brown Plumbate vessel, which is strikingly similar to Ulua Valley Fine Orange-a similarity remarked on by Glass. 3 This comment is based on my recent study of these materials at the Harvard University Peabody Museum.</page></plain_text>
