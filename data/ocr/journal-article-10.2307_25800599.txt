<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of World Prehistory, Vol. 5, No. 3, 1991 The Transition to Farming in Eastern and Northern Europe Marek Zvelebil1'3 and Paul Dolukhanov2 This paper presents a general survey of the transition to farming in Eastern and Northern Europe, approached within the framework of the availability model and treated from the perspective of local (Mesolithic) hunting and gathering communities. We argue that in Eastern and Northern Europe, the transition to farming was a slow process, which occurred through the adoption of exogenous cultigens and domesticates by the local hunter-gatherer populations, who may have been already engaged in some form of husbandry of the local resources. Contact and exchange with the Neolithic and later Bronze Age of Central Europe had a profound and prolonged influence on the process of the adoption of farm ing in Eastern and Northern Europe. During the slow process of transition, mixed hunting-farming societies emerged, which could be regarded as having a characteristic social and economic organization of their own (i. e., neither "Mesolithic" nor "Neolithic"). In conclusion, we argue for continuity in pop ulation and in social and economic traditions from the hunter-gatherer past until recent antiquity and, in some areas, into the historical period.

We propose to examine this tran sition within the framework of the availability model, which is designed to accommodate the role of hunter-gatherer societies within this development (Zvelebil and Rowley-Conwy, 1984). This paper deals with the transition to farming in the forest zone of Eastern and Northern Europe?an area that lies on the periphery, rather than in the center, of the developments traditionally believed to have led to the "Neolithic revolution." One may ask, Why study the agricultural transition in such periph eral areas? Were they not mere recipients of more dynamic developments from the Near Eastern core? To answer these questions, we have to begin with a more general look at the transition to farming in Europe. For historical reasons, most of our understanding of the transition to farm ing in Europe is based on one area, the southeast and the Danubian corridor, which has thus become a model for other areas. It is further based on a belief in the existence of significant dichotomies, which provide a framework for the transition to farming. These are an economic dichotomy between hunter-gath erer and farmer societies and a geographical dichotomy between core areas, where farming was invented, and peripheral areas, into which it spread. These dichotomies are spatially expressed as an agricultural frontier, spreading out of the core areas in ever-wider circles, representing the wave of advance of agri cultural peoples. The view adopted here departs from the traditional model of the Neolithic colonization of Europe and from these traditional dichotomies. In our view, the "Danubian" pattern of transition to farming was not a normal situation but an exception; the core-periphery dichotomy, though real, has been exaggerated by a Childean respect for Near Eastern civilizations, while the forager-farmer dichotomy, where it actually existed, was of a much more complicated nature. In Northern and Eastern Europe, the agricultural transition occurred slowly. The process can be examined, therefore, at a finer level of resolution. In these areas, the core-periphery dichotomy and the forager-farmer dichotomy are par ticularly inappropriate. Northern and Eastern Europe are also, in our view, more representative of the processes that marked the transition to farming than is the Danubian corridor. Consequently, these areas present an alternative view of the transition. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS The Contribution of Gordon Childe Current views on the agricultural transition cannot be understood without a brief summary of earlier approaches and, particularly, of the work of Gordon Childe. For the most part, the theories of earlier scholars about the origin of</page><page sequence="3">Transition to Farming in Eastern and Northern Europe 235 agriculture followed the prevailing philosophical thought of the time. Thus, the nineteenth-century evolutionists, firmly convinced of the inevitability of human progress and the superiority of farming, and guided by the experience of the European colonial expansion, found the reasons for the adoption of farming to be self-evident: The savage inhabitants of each land, having found out by so many hard trials what plants were useful . . . would, after a time, take the first step in cultivation by planting them near their usual abodes. (Darwin, 1875, pp. 326-327) One of the most active and influential scholars to analyze the agricultural transition was Gordon Childe. He combined evolutionary and Marxist frame works with an environmentalist explanation?the propinquity-oasis theory?to build a powerful model for the origin and diffusion of farming (Childe, 1928, 1934, 1957). His model relied on the following convictions. (1) The Mesolithic period in Europe was one of cultural decline among groups unable to cope with the changing postglacial environment. Childe, in fact, did not even acknowledge the existence of the Mesolithic as an indepen dent period, preferring to see it as the degenerate end of the Paleolithic. (2) All inventions of any significance were introduced into Europe from the Near East at least until the Bronze Age, when an independent culture devel oped. Before that, European prehistory was marked by the imitation, or at best the adaptation, of Near Eastern achievements. (3) The Neolithic revolution was a unique and revolutionary event, which brought about a richer and more reliable supply of food. Within this paradigm, it was quite natural that hunter-gatherer territories would be colonized by the growing farming populations. In the case of Europe, the colonists came from the Near East and progressively displaced, absorbed, or annihilated those "disgusting savages" (Childe, 1928, p. 220), who inhab ited postglacial Europe. Childe's view was reinforced by his early research in southeastern and central Europe, where there was a clear dichotomy between the Mesolithic and the Neolithic cultures and where the best case in Europe can be made for a colonization by immigrant farmers (Zvelebil, 1986b). This led him to adopt this part of Europe as a model for other areas. These developments of a half-century ago need to be spelled out in some detail because most subsequent research on the origins of farming in Europe has been either an elaboration of or a reaction to Childe's diffusionist model. Many later scholars have adopted the diffusionist perspective to a greater or lesser degree (Clark, 1965; Piggott, 1965; Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza, 1984; Renfrew, 1987). Within such a perspective, local Mesolithic societies played little or no role; they acted at best as passive recipients of innovations emanating ultimately from the Near Eastern "core area," where local hunter gatherers began farming as a response to social competition (Bender, 1975), a decline in wild resources (Henry, 1985), or population growth (Cohen, 1977)</page><page sequence="4">236 Zvelebil and Dolukhanov or as a result of a strategic adjustment to a combination of factors acting at a regional level (Binford, 1968, 1983; Flannery, 1969; Henry 1985; Redding, 1988). More recently, some scholars have tried to accord Mesolithic societies a more active role (Clark, 1980; Clarke, 1976). Within the last 20 years, a new school of thought has emerged, which considers the possibility of a local, indig enous domestication within Europe itself and which acknowledges that Meso lithic societies, rather than intrusive Neolithic populations, played a decisive role in the development of the European Neolithic (Higgs, 1972, 1975; Jarman, 1972; Jarman etal, 1982; Dennell, 1983, 1985; Barker, 1985). This debate remains unresolved (Zvelebil, 1986c; Renfrew, 1987; Zvelebil and Zvelebil, 1988). We take the view here that progress can be made only by reexamining existing conceptual frameworks, particularly the definition of hunter-gatherer and farmer societies, the core-periphery framework, and the frontier concept. Hunter-Gatherer and Farmer Societies On the face of it, the distinction between hunter-gatherer and farmer soci eties seems simple: they are defined by their mode of production?hunting or farming?and by the productive potential of their economies. In recent years, however, it has been recognized that there are profound differences in social organization and subsistence strategies among hunter-gatherers (Lee and DeVore, 1968; Binford, 1983; Woodbum, 1982; Testart, 1982). Organiza tional arrangements range from mobile societies with simple social organization and expedient technologies to more complex hunter-gatherers with storage, specialized procurement of resources, and curated technology, requiring a con siderable labor investment and possibly nonegalitarian social organization. Tes tart (1982), Rowley-Conwy (1983), and Zvelebil (1986d) have argued for the presence of such complex hunter-gatherers in the Mesolithic of Europe, partic ularly in Eastern and Northern Europe. Such differences in hunter-gatherer resource use diminish the social and economic differences between farming and foraging and force us to distinguish between hunting and gathering, the husbandry of genetically wild resources, and cultivation or herding of domesticated plants and animals. There are numer ous examples of hunters practicing selective cull, altering the environment, or removing other predators, to sustain and increase the productivity of their wild resources (Higgs, 1972, 1975; Mithen, 1990). Equally, gatherers can manipu late their plant resources through clearances, ground preparation, planting, and harvesting (Rindos, 1984; Harris and Hillman, 1989). In such cases, we are dealing with plant and animal husbandry within societies that remain reliant primarily on hunting and gathering and that use genetically wild resources. The</page><page sequence="5">Transition to Farming in Eastern and Northern Europe 237 productivity of such resources, however, will be higher than from other hunter gatherer strategies. Similar differences exist among farming systems. Agropastoral farming involving cereals, pulses, bovines, and caprines is only one among many dif ferent farming systems (Harris and Hillman, 1989). It is also a remarkably ver satile, productive, and adaptable one (Harris, 1977; Zvelebil, 1986b). Other, less productive systems are known to exist, however, and their use must have been much wider before the spread of cereal-based farming into many parts of the world. The North American example, where cultivation of indigenous root and seed crops preceded the spread of maize agriculture (Brown, 1985), is per tinent here. We should not assume that there were not such systems in pre Neolithic Europe, even though the evidence is circumstantial (Clarke, 1976) and controversial (Barker, 1985; Dennell, 1983; Harris and Hillman, 1989). These observations serve to diminish the conceptual divide between hunt ing-gathering and farming societies and to reduce the gap in productivity that is thought by some to have existed between the two (Ammerman and Cavalli Sforza, 1984; Renfrew, 1987). In the initial transition to farming, hunter-gath erer societies did not necessarily have to cross the Rubicon. The adoption of farming may have been a matter of the integration of new cultigens and domesti cates into the existing patterns of resource use and of a gradual transition from one type of economy to another. Core-Periphery Relationships In the traditional view, agropastoral farming was brought to Europe, partly or wholly, by farmers emigrating from the core area of development, the Near East, and colonizing hitherto unfarmed areas of Europe. Within this framework, emphasis is placed almost entirely on the circumstances and the process of col onization (Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza, 1984). The condition and the response of the resident hunter-gatherers are mostly ignored; indeed, some areas are treated as if the farmer-colonists were moving into uninhabited areas. There are archaeological and paleogeographic reasons for this attitude. Archaeologically, the introduction of new cultigens and domesticates across Europe and the cultural changes associated with this process form a distinct horizon that often stands in sharp contrast to the earlier and, in some cases, scant evidence for hunter-gatherer occupation. This horizon has been tradition ally interpreted as the evidence for farmer colonization. The geographical distribution of the wild progenitors of plants and animals that form the basis of agropastoral farming is centered on the Near East, thus defining the "core" area where the original development of agropastoral farm ing took place in the tenth millennium B.P. The peripheral areas, such as</page><page sequence="6">238 Zvelebil and Dolukhanov Europe, are seen as recipients of exogenous cultigens and domesticates and of a new economy emanating from the Near Eastern core. Both the archaeological and the geographic reasons for this core-periphery dichotomy have been overemphasized. The paucity of settlement in Mesolithic Europe is apparent rather than real (Clarke, 1976; Zvelebil, 1986c; Rowley Conwy et aL, 1987), its interpretation obscured by the postglacial rise in sea level, taphonomic factors, and paradigmatic indifference. From the geographic perspective, potential cultigens and domesticates did exist in Europe, although they may have not been identical to the range available in the Near East (Den nell, 1983; Barker, 1985; Zvelebil, 1986c). Even though this narrower range might have been the reason why agropastoral farming did not develop inde pendently in Europe (Harris, 1977; Zvelebil 1986b), wild plant and animal resources were manipulated in ways suggesting husbandry (Dennell, 1983; Barker, 1985). We should allow, therefore, for the existence of dynamic and evolving Mesolithic societies in most parts of Europe, which did not constitute a mere periphery to the Near Eastern core but exerted their own influence on subsequent socioeconomic Neolithic developments. Even if farmers from the Near East actually did colonize Europe, neglect of the existing European populations is bound to bias our interpretation of the transition. In the context of the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition, core-periphery relationships must have differed from region to region, depending on the dyna mism of the resident hunter-gatherer societies and the viability of the young farming communities. The Agricultural Frontier We have seen that the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition in Europe has usu ally been treated from the perspective of Neolithic colonization. Both theoret ical and methodological concepts have been developed to accommodate the belief in the diffusion of farming to Europe either by human migration alone or through both colonization and contact. One such concept is that of the agricul tural frontier. Traditionally, the concept of the agricultural frontier is inseparably con nected with the diffusionist model of an advance of agricultural settlement in areas hitherto occupied by hunters and gatherers (Ammerman and Cavalli Sforza, 1984). A more sophisticated version sees selective "pioneer" coloni zation occurring in stages, with frequent halts in the process of expansion. Col onization was selective in that it moved first in the most fertile regions, with secondary colonization of suboptimal areas at a later date (Piggott, 1965; Sher ratt, 1972). This allows for hunter-gatherer survivals in regions not initially colonized by the farmers and for the adoption of farming by local Mesolithic groups. This more realistic approach has been supported by a number of regional</page><page sequence="7">Transition to Farming in Eastern and Northern Europe 239 studies (Kruk, 1973; Kozlowski and Kozlowski, 1986; Bogucki, 1987). The different rates of advance within the model led Alexander (1978) to distinguish between "moving" and "stationary" frontiers. This was elaborated by Dennell (1985) to incorporate various degrees of participation by the indigenous hunter gatherers. DenneH's scheme shows how farming could have spread through Europe by contact without actual colonization (Fig. 1). Zvelebil and Rowley-Conwy (1984) have developed the frontier concept further. They redefine the frontier as a zone of interaction between foraging and farming communities, irrespective of whether the farmers were colonists or local inhabitants who adopted farming (Fig. 2). This interaction zone can extend over several hundred kilometers, and its extent and duration can shed light on the nature of the transition and the participation of the local groups in it. The zone of forager-farmer interaction can undergo three phases of tran sition: the availability phase, the substitution phase, and the consolidation phase (Fig. 2). During the availability phase, farming is known to the foraging groups and there is some exchange of materials and information between them and the farming communities, but without the adoption of farming. Farmers and for agers are developing contacts but the two societies still operate as culturally and economically independent units. The availability phase ends with the adoption of at least some elements of farming by the foragers or with the settlement of farmers in the territory hitherto used by the foragers. During the substitution phase farming practices replace hunting and gath ering strategies, although agropastoral farming still remains embedded within an overall foraging-farming strategy. This is the phase when the actual socio economic transition from a hunting-gathering to a farming way of life takes place.

(Reproduced by permission of the Cambridge University Press). In the consolidation phase, which begins when society becomes dependent on agriculture, the social and economic structures of the old frontier mature to hinterland conditions. Economically, this is the first stage of a predominantly Neolithic economy, marked by both the extensive and the intensive growth of food production: the secondary colonization of suboptimal farming habitats and more intensive farming practices.</page><page sequence="9">Transition to Farming in Eastern and Northern Europe 241 Unlike earlier models, the availability model permits us to monitor the response of local hunter-gatherer communities to agropastoral farming. It does not automatically assume that foragers would be assimilated into the new sys tem, but allows for choice in their reaction to agriculture and to farming soci eties. As a result, the duration of phases within the model can be used as evidence for or against farmer colonization, although it cannot provide proof. If there was colonization of new habitats by immigrant farmers and if the role of the resident hunter-gatherers was minimal, we would expect that the avail ability and substitution phases would be short, with immigrant farmers intro ducing an already developed farming system into new areas. If, on the other hand, local hunter-gatherers adopted farming through contact (trading, marriage alliances, etc.), the availability and substitution phases should be long and there should be evidence of integration between foraging and/or farming at economic, social, and symbolic levels prior to the consolidation phase. The presence of domesticates in faunal remains is often used as a signature Time Fig. 3. The availability model for the transition to fanning. The sigmoid shape of the curve represents an idealized situation. In actual cases, the shape of the curve will depend on the length of the individual phases.

Figure 3 illustrates an attempt to identify from faunal remains the three stages of the agricultural transition within the frame work of the availability model. In adopting this scheme, we suggest a link between faunal evidence and the socioeconomic organization of Stone Age soci eties. Because of taphonomic factors and other biasing processes, variation in the composition of faunal remains can be only a very general indicator of eco nomic change. Nevertheless, our scheme is an advance on earlier approaches, where the presence of domestic fauna, however restricted, was often taken to indicate a farming economy. In summary, the farmer colonization model suffers both from a "minimal view" of Mesolithic societies and from a lack of archaeological evidence for colonization. The exceptions are Central and Southeastern Europe (Fig. 4), where the colonization model and the notion of colonization from the Near East are, on the whole, supported by the archaeological data (for more detailed dis cussion, see Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza, 1984; Zvelebil, 1986a, b, 1989a; Zvelebil and Zvelebil, 1988; Dennell, 1983; Barker, 1985; Ammerman, 1989).

The dashed line denotes, in our view, the boundary between the "in digenous" and the "immigrant" Europe: the early Neolithic cultures 2, 3, 4, and 6a arose more likely as a result of farmer colonization ultimately from western Asia; cultures out side this zone were more likely a result of the local adoption of farming by Mesolithic groups. (After Renfrew, 1987; Zvelebil and Zvelebil, 1988.)</page><page sequence="11">Transition to Farming in Eastern and Northern Europe 243 We suggest that farmer colonization is inappropriate as a model for the agri cultural transition elsewhere in Europe, and we advance the availability model as an alternative descriptive framework for the process of the transition. We now apply this framework to key regions in Eastern and Northern Europe. TRANSITION TO FARMING IN NORTHERN AND EASTERN EUROPE The key areas lie to the north and east of the Neolithic of Central Europe: the early Balkan Neolithic, Linear Pottery, and Tripolye culture (Fig. 4). Most of these cultures have a clearly defined boundary, representing a frontier between predominantly farming communities and predominantly hunter-gatherer groups. In some areas, this frontier remained stationary for over a millennium (Zvelebil and Rowley-Conwy, 1984). Ecology of the Area Geographically, the greater part of this area corresponds to the North and East European Plain, bounded by the Scandinavian mountains to the north, the Carpathians to the west, and the Urals to the east. The area was directly affected by Late Pleistocene glaciations and comprises low morainic uplands and morainic plains in the north and loess-covered periglacial plains in the south. There are rivers with large terraced valleys in both the south (Prut, Dniester, Dnieper, and its tributaries) and the north [Neman and Duna (Zapadnaya Dvina)]. In the coastal areas of the Black and Baltic Seas, there are numerous offshore lagoons. The area includes several vegetational zones: arctic steppe (tundra) in the extreme north, coniferous forest (taiga), mixed coniferous/broadleaved forests and forest-steppe in the temperate zone, and dry steppe along the northern shore of the Black Sea (Fig. 5). During the Holocene Climatic Optimum, temperature and precipitation rose above their present values. Mixed coniferous forests extended farther north and south than at present, and the dry steppe was restricted to the southernmost area of the pontic lowland (Dolukhanov, 1986a). The river floodplains, offshore lagoons, and residual ice-dammed lakes in the morainic zone were particularly rich in biomass. The last two habitats contained mammalian and aquatic fauna and plants with storage organs (roots, tubers, nuts) that could support large groups of hunter-gatherers year-round (Dolukhanov, 1979; Vereshchagin etal., 1979). After 4600 B.P., temperature decline and a decrease in precipitation led to the establishment of the present-day vegetational zones, marked by the reduc tion in the mixed coniferous forest and the expansion of taiga in the north and</page><page sequence="12">Tundra Coniferous taiga Mixed coniferous and broadleaved forests Deciduous forests 7]Steppe, woodland steppe and semi -desertsteppe ~ oanvegetation NN L J.

This was associated with the disappearance of temperate species, such as red deer, wild boar, wild cattle, and waterchestnut, from north eastern Europe (Paaver, 1965; Vankina, 1970) and the development of an arid climate in the south of the Russian plain. These conditions must have affected the dispersal of farming in two major ways: with the dispersal northward, farming was being introduced to progres sively less favorable areas, and after about 4600 B.P., farming was adopted or even maintained in increasingly deteriorating climatic conditions. These two factors may have been responsible for the delayed adoption of farming in the more northerly regions of the area. Natural variation within the forest zone must have also influenced the development of farming systems. Within the forest steppe and the temperate forest, climate and soil conditions would permit a relatively rapid establishment of permanent arable farming (Loomis, 1978; Gregg, 1988). Farther north, the short growing season, low temperatures, high precipitation, poor soils, and unpredictable fluctuations in climate increased the risks associated with the introduction of farming (Stalfelt, 1972; Zvelebil, 1981). A certain amount of risk was inherent in introducing cultigens and domesticates originally derived from the Near East, before new, more adapted strains were developed (some areas of the north were not cultivated until the introduction of rye, for instance), while poor soils required large amounts of manure to produce a reliable crop. Under such conditions, greater emphasis would be placed on slash-and-burn agriculture and on animal husbandry than on permanent arable. After the initial forest clearance, a variety of swiddening systems would be put into operation, involving cultivation for several years and then either moving to another area or using the field for stock until enough manure was produced to sustain per manent arable. Thus, in the north, the cycle involved three phases: slash-and burn, stock-keeping, and permanent arable. The role of stock-keeping in this system was crucial. Late Mesolithic Societies of Northern and Eastern Europe While most of the modem steppe and forest-steppe has been continuously occupied at least since the Upper Paleolithic, the temperate forest zone was first settled only during the Late Glacial by nomadic groups of Epipaleolithic rein deer hunters moving from the south and the west (Dolukhanov, 1979). The subsequent Mesolithic hunter-gatherer communities are usually seen as cultural descendants of these Epipaleolithic groups. In the late Mesolithic, corresponding roughly to the early stage of the Cli matic Optimum (ca. 8000-6000 B.P.), several cultural entities may be loosely defined in Eastern and Northern Europe by their lithic and bone-antler inven tories (Fig. 6).</page><page sequence="14">/^/j Hunter-gatherers Early farmers Fig. 6.

N c 7T</page><page sequence="15">Transition to Farming in Eastern and Northern Europe 247 Most of the southern area (steppe and forest/steppe) may be seen as related to the southeastern European microlithic zone marked by trapezes. Most sites occur in river valleys and are usually interpreted as seasonal hunting camps (Telegin, 1982, pp. 192-193). At least one site, Mirnoe in the offshore area of southern Moldavia, has indications of a large base-camp settlement (Stanko, 1982). The economy was based primarily on the hunting of aurochs and tarpan (Equus gmelini) and included some wild-plant processing, evidenced by both microwear traces and pollen analysis. Late Mesolithic sites in the temperate forests have high percentages of narrow blades, axes, adzes, and mattocks, a rich bone and antler industry, and, in Eastern Europe, few geometric microliths (Clark, 1976; Gurina, 1977). Since the archaeological record relies heavily on surface or mixed subsurface assem blages, only loose cultural groupings can be distinguished. These include Kunda, Suomusjarvi, Upper Volga, Neman, and several others (Fig. 6). In southern Scandinavia, both broad and narrow microliths occur, and better stratigraphic control allows for sharper recognition of discrete cultural groups. The sites are located in the floodplains of river valleys, within lacustrine basins and offshore lagoons. As in the south, most Mesolithic sites are thought to have been seasonal hunting camps. Although the evidence is far from con clusive, the accumulation of cultural debris and the seasonal variety of faunal remains on some sites, such as Kunda or Narva in Estonia, may suggest increased residential permanence in the most favorable settings, such as off shore lagoons or residual dammed lakes (Zvelebil, 1986d; Selirand and Ton isson, 1984). The trend toward sedentism increased with the introduction of ceramic technology in the mid-seventh millennium B.P. Pottery-using hunter-gatherers, known as the "Forest Neolithic," are among the best prehistoric examples of "complex" or "affluent" foragers, despite some argument about the degree of complexity attained (Price, 1985; Zvelebil, 1986b, c; Dolukhanov, 1986a, b; Gurina, 1961, 1967). Traits characteristic of the pottery-using foragers, espe cially in the temperate forest zone, include semipermanent occupation of base camps; complex economic organization, including both diversified and spec ialized food-procurement strategies; use of capture facilities and of specialized technology; and possibly some form of social stratification (Price, 1985; Zvele bil, 1986b, c, 1989b; Rowley-Conwy and Zvelebil, 1989; Burov, 1988; Ander sen, 1987). Such complex hunter-gatherer societies would have been more productive and capable of supporting higher population densities than the more mobile, dispersed communities of the continental interior of Central and West ern Europe (cf. Clarke, 1976). Their economy was based on the exploitation of a wide range of resources, arranged in seasonal schedules (Vereshchagin et al., 1979; Zvelebil, 1989b) and included intensive use of seasonally available resources such as waterfowl (Gurina, 1967), seal (Zvelebil, 1981), and water chestnuts (Vankina, 1970).</page><page sequence="16">248 Zvelebil and Dolukhanov The structure of this hunter-gatherer society influenced its relationship to agropastoral farming as an alternative socioeconomic strategy. Investment in the existing technology and economy would raise the cost of a structural change, such as the adoption of agropastoral farming would require. At the same time, the complex hunter-gatherer system was, through storage and higher productiv ity, more prepared to cope with short-term and year-to-year fluctuations in resources (Rowley-Conwy and Zvelebil, 1989), reducing the advantages of the adoption of farming. Thus, complex hunter-gatherers would be disinclined to adopt farming (Akazawa, 1986). On the other hand, the system was vulnerable to long-term resource variation and to socioeconomic pressures latent in the society as a result of increased sedentism (which reduced mobility as a solution to socioeconomic problems) and of increased capacity for social differentiation. The Agricultural Frontier in Northern and Eastern Europe The introduction of agropastoral farming in Northern and Eastern Europe took place mostly within the context of the hunter-gatherer societies described above. This process was broadly characterized by three features: it took a long time to complete; the initial stages were characterized by contacts within the frontier zone between the hunter-gatherers and the farmers; and in most cases, the new farming societies show cultural continuity, especially in lithic tradi tions, with the preceding hunter-gatherer communities (Tringham, 1968; Tre tyakov, 1982; Sulimirski, 1970; Dolukhanov, 1979; Kozlowski and Kozlowski, 1986). The spread of the farming economy across Northern and Eastern Europe is illustrated in Figs. 7-16. The quality of information is uneven, which makes it difficult to separate the availability phase from the period of substitution. The availability phase is defined by contact with the farming societies. The adoption of ceramics in the forest zone is seen as arising from such contact, so the "For est Neolithic" in most areas would belong to the availability phase. In some areas, notably in the western Ukraine, the northeastern Baltic, and southern Scandinavia, the quality of information permits a more detailed analysis. It is to these areas that we now turn. Moldavia and the Ukraine The first agricultural settlements attributed to the Starcevo-Cris (Koros) culture appeared in Moldavia in the early eighth millennium B.P.; they corre spond to stage III of the same culture in Romania, marked by a high proportion of Mesolithic (Tardenoisian-like) trapezes and a considerable content of wild species (mainly red deer) in the faunal remains (Comsa, 1974, 1978, 1987; Dumitrescu et al., 1983; Urulescu, 1984; Necrasov and Stirbu, 1980).

The Bug-Dniester sites show strong continuity with local Mesolithic groups. Markevitch (1974), while noting both differences from and continuities with the earlier Mesolithic assemblages, points to striking sim ilarities between Bug-Dniester core and microlith production and at least two Mesolithic assemblages, Ataki 6 and Osil'evka in northern Moldavia. Sulimir ski (1970), Tringham (1968, 1969, 1971), and Telegin (1987) also note the local, microlithic (Pontic Tardenoisian) nature of the early Bug-Dniester indus try. Markevitch (1974) divided the Bug-Dniester culture into three phases: an early aceramic phase (7500-7000 B.P.), a middle phase characterized by the presence of ceramics related to the Balkan Neolithic (ca. 7000-6500 B.P.), and a late phase showing the influence of Linear Pottery ware (ca. 6500-6000 B.P.). Stratigraphic problems mean that these divisions must be treated with caution;</page><page sequence="21">Transition to Farming in Eastern and Northern Europe 253 Fig. 11. Contribution of domesticates, expressed as meat weight, to the diet of the Bug-Dniester Neolithic settlements. The sites are arranged in an approximate chronological sequence. The line indicates the percentage contribution of domesticates, measured as meat weight, to the total sample of animal food remains, estimated on the basis of MNI in the faunal sample. (After Markevitch, 1974.) here we distinguish only between the earlier aceramic and the later ceramic phases. Contacts between the Bug-Dniester and the Starcevo-^ris communities are attested by the similarity in pottery decoration: horizontal rows of shell and fingernail impressions, essentially similar to the barbotine technique (Comsa, 1974, p. 6; Urulescu, 1984, p. 35; Markevitch, 1974, p. 102). Contacts between the Bug-Dniester and the Linear Pottery groups are even more obvious. Imported Notenkopf Linear pottery was found at the Bug-Dniester sites of Soroki 5 and Baz'kov Ostrov, while Bug-Dniester pots were found at the Linear Pottery site of Novye Rusesty. In the Reut valley, sites of both cultures coexisted only a few kilometers apart (Fig. 10). Economic evidence comes from some 11 sites located in the valleys of Dniester and southern Bug (Fig. 17). During an early phase, domesticates form &lt;20% of the faunal assemblage (to be precise, seven domestic pigs and two cattle). Most of the faunal remains are of wild species, notably wild pig, red deer, and roe deer. Over 800 fish bones from the lower layers of Soroki 1 and 2 testify to the importance of fishing. The Bug-Dniester sites contain thousands of shells of edible molluscs (notably Unio), an indicator of the importance of gathering in the subsistence pattern.

Faunal evidence from the Bug-Dniester Neolithic sites in Western Ukraine. (After Markevitch, 1974.)</page><page sequence="28">260 Zvelebil and Dolukhanov reveal a variety of wild and some domesticated cereals (Markevitch, 1974). Grinders and composite sickles, some with sickle gloss, supply further evidence for the extensive use of grasses. Domesticated animals remain in a minority in the later sites, ranging from 3 to 50% (Fig. 17). One of us (Dolukhanov) sees the Bug-Dniester sites as an example of the availability phase: of foraging and farming groups living side by side and engaged in multifaceted economic and cultural exchange. Agriculture was not tenable in the densely forested, narrow floodplains of the Dniester, southern Bug, and smaller rivers. The sites of the Dniester and of the southern Bug represent a single economic and cultural entity and should not be separated. The other (Zvelebil) sees this as plausible for the early part of the Bug Dniester Neolithic (the "aceramic" phase, ca. 7500-7000 B.P.), and while no doubt trade/exchange continued in the later phases as well, the evidence for agropastoral farming at Dniester sites of the seventh millennium B.P. is too extensive to be explained solely by contact. Rather, we are dealing with a mixed farming-foraging economy typical of the substitution phase: procuring food from a variety of sources, including hunting, fishing, gathering, and probably some cultivation of domestic cereals. The availability zone had, by then, moved farther east to the southern Bug region (Fig. 10), where, even during the seventh millennium, domesticates form &lt; 10% of the fauna. The Bug-Dniester Neolithic illustrates a gradual transition to farming by a local, hunting-gathering society: it was slow, selective, and brought about by contact. The casual rate of transition is remarkable: after 1500 years of knowl edge of farming practices, domesticates still may have contributed no more than 40-50% of the meat in the diet (Fig. 11) (Markevitch, 1974). Local selectivity is shown by the absence of ovicaprids from Bug-Dniester sites (with one excep tion?a few caprine bones from a late southern Bug site, Mikolina Boyarka). The evidence for continuity with the local Mesolithic and for contact with agri cultural groups in the Balkans and Central Europe completes the picture of a local transition to farming. The next stage in the northern advance of farming falls within the period 5600-4500 B.P. It is marked by a partly contemporaneous existence of several subsistence patterns, each corresponding to a distinct phase of the availability model (Figs. 8 and 15). The Tripolye-Cucuteni culture follows the Bug-Dniester Neolithic after an interval of some 400 years for which there are no well-dated settlements. The first settlements of this culture appear in Moldavia and southwestern Ukraine at 6000-5800 B.P. (Monah, 1987; Telegin and Pothekina, 1987). Although Tripolye was a typical farming culture of Southeast/Central European character, it did absorb some local traits. Its origins, which have only recently been clar ified, involve at least three elements: Linear Pottery, Boian, and the local Bug</page><page sequence="29">Transition to Farming in Eastern and Northern Europe 261 Dniester groups (Dumitrescu et al., 1983, pp. 108-109). Local traditions can be seen in the lithic industry (cores, scrapers, hoes, microliths) and in fingernail impressions on the pottery (Markevitch, 1974, p. 165). There are two clear phases in the economy of the Tripolye settlements. In the early stage, the economy was mixed: the percentage of wild species ranged from 67.7 to 28.6% (Zbenovich, 1989, Table 5) and fishing remained impor tant. As with the Bug-Dniester sites, most early Tripolye sites were on flood plains or low river terraces (Dolukhanov, 1979, 1986a). On this evidence, we can attribute the early Tripolye sites to the substitution phase, that is, the actual transition to farming. Tripolye was fully food producing by its middle stages (5300-5200 B.P.). Ethnobotanical finds include emmer, einkorn, spelt, club wheat, naked and hulled six-row barley, millet, oats, fruits, and pulses. Domesticates, mainly cattle, formed 60-80% of the fauna. Horses and caprovines were present, but they remained minor elements of animal husbandry until the final (Usatovo) stage of the culture. Most large sites were situated in the loess plains adjoining the river valleys (Dolukhanov, 1979). The middle stage of the Tripolye culture corresponds to the consolidation phase of the availability model. By this time, the zone of farmer-forager contact (the availability phase) had moved farther north, to the valleys of the Dnieper, the Severski Donets, and their tributaries (Fig. 10). The economy and settlement pattern of the ear liest pottery-using culture, the Dnieper-Donets (6500-4500 B.P.), were essen tially the same as those of the Bug-Dniester groups (Dolukhanov, 1986a). The economy was based primarily on hunting, fishing, and plant-gathering. The occurrence of domesticated animals, predominantly cattle, as well as rare impressions of grain on the potsherds seems to indicate exchange links with agricultural communities rather than a local farming economy (Dolukhanov, 1986a). Dnieper-Donets pottery assemblages include imported Tripolye ware (Telegin, 1968) and show similarities in ornament to the Funnel Beaker ware of Central Europe (Dolukhanov, 1979). To the southeast, on the lower Dnieper, the distinctive Srednii Stog cul ture, dated to 5700-4700 B.P. (Telegin, 1986), played a key role in the initial development of pastoral economies in the Ukraine. The local Ukrainian Meso lithic, the Dnieper-Donets groups, and other elements are thought to have played a role in the development of this culture (Telegin, 1986, 1987; Telegin and Potekhina, 1987). Economically, Srednii Stog represents a transition from a hunting-gathering society to one based on animal husbandry, where horse-hus bandry was a major economic activity. At Dereivka (5400-4900 B.P.), &gt; 80% of the faunal remains are reported to be of domestic animals, of which horses make up 74% (Telegin, 1986). Levine (1990), however, has questioned the domesticated status of the Dereivka horses, suggesting that most of the bones</page><page sequence="30">262 Zvelebil and Dolukhanov belong to wild horses, procured by hunting. Foraging remained important: at Dereivka, 176 sinkers, fishing hooks, many fish bones, and scales all indicate the importance of fishing (Telegin, 1986; Telegin and Potekhina, 1987). There are indications that Srednii Stog represents a phenomenon widely present in other areas of the steppeland. In the southern Urals and the surround ing steppe, settlements dated from the early eighth through the sixth millennia B.P. have yielded bones of domesticates, with horse as the principal species (Matyushin, 1986; Telegin, 1986). Matyushin (1986) argues for the early center of domestication in the southern Urals (from about 8000 B.P.), marked by the gradual integration of domesticates?especially horse and cattle?into a local hunting and gathering economy, a process that is not completed until the mid fifth millennium B.P. [Fig. 15; see also Dergachev (1989) and Mallory (1989) for excellent reviews]. If this is the case, then domesticated horses and the associated pastoral economy spread from the southern Urals westward, reaching the middle Dnieper by the about 6000 B.P., and then also influencing the farm ing cultures of western Ukraine and southeastern Europe (Cucuteni-Tripolye, Gumelnitsa, etc.) in the middle and late sixth millennium B.P. (Telegin, 1986). A gradual decline in temperature and rainfall, marking the end of the Cli matic Optimum, coincided with a disintegration of the Tripolye culture between 5000 and 4500 B.P. Initially, this took the form of regional specialization (e.g., Usatovo with its ovicaprine husbandry and copper metallurgy) and population relocation. From the mid-fourth millennium B.P., a predominantly nomadic pastoral economy was firmly established in the steppe/forest and steppe zones by the Pit-Grave (Yamnaya) and the Middle Dnieper groups. The economy of these cultures was based on nomadic stock-breeding, with some agriculture in the river valleys (e.g., Mikhailovka) and with extensive hunting in the Middle Dnieper region. North European Plain and Southern Scandinavia Southern Scandinavia and the adjacent coastal areas of the North European Plain are key areas for the analysis of late Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, forager farmer interactions, and the adoption of farming. The backdrop to these studies is provided by a stationary agricultural frontier, which did not advance for more than 1000 years (Fig. 12). After a rapid spread across Central Europe, where they gave rise to the Linear Pottery culture, farming communities came to a halt in the North Euro pean Plain, leaving the coastal areas of the North Sea occupied by hunter-gath erers. Even with the transformation of the Linear Pottery culture to the more localized Michelsberg, Baalberg, and Lengyel groups around 5900 B.P., the frontier remained broadly stationary. It was not until about 5200 B.P. that farm ing spread into the coastal zone of the North European Plain and southern Scan dinavia, resulting in the formation of a new cultural group, the Funnel Beaker</page><page sequence="31">Transition to Farming in Eastern and Northern Europe 263 culture. The contrast here could not be greater: while Linear Potteiy spread across central Europe so rapidly that radiocarbon dates 1000 km apart are undis tinguishable, farming then took 1300 radiocarbon years to travel another 250 km (Fig. 12). This could not have been due to ecological conditions. The frontier extends across a uniform geographical area, and the soils of southern Scandinavia are, in many places, light, fertile, and favorable for cultivation (Stalfelt, 1972). The reason for the delay must be sought in the late Mesolithic communities of the region. Although regional differences exist (Madsen, 1986), hunter-gatherers in the southern Baltic region are likely to have had a greater population density than central European foragers (Paludan-Miiller, 1978; Price, 1985), larger and more permanent settlements (Madsen, 1986; Bogucki, 1987; Price, 1985; Jenn bert, 1985; Rowley-Conwy, 1983), and a complex economic pattern involving specialized extraction camps, seasonal scheduling, and seasonally intensive use of specific resources (Rowley-Conwy, 1983; Zvelebil and Rowley-Conwy, 1984, 1986; Price, 1985; Wyszomirska, 1988). There is also extensive evi dence for capture facilities and other forms of labor-intensive, curated technol ogy [as at Tybrind Vig (Andersen, 1987)]. Larsson (1990) has provided a recent review of these developments in the southern Scandinavian Mesolithic. The existence of formal burial areas?cemeteries?also points to the increased permanence of settlement and territorial definition in the late Meso lithic (Chapman, 1981; Price and Petersen, 1987; Madsen, 1986; Larsson, 1990), as well as attesting to the existence of violent conflict within the society, whose social structure was probably more complex than the "band level" of social organization commonly associated with hunter-gatherers (Price, 1985; Madsen, 1986). The evidence for complex hunter-gatherers is less convincing in the North European Plain, perhaps due partly to the drowning of coastal areas by the postglacial rise in sea level. Even here, however, inland sites such as Friesack (Gramsch and Kloss, 1989) reveal the density and permanence of late Meso lithic settlement. In Poland, Kozlowski and Kozlowski (1986) and Bogucki (1988) have both argued for an increase in population density, the progressive regionalization, economic complexity, and stability of late Mesolithic groups north of the Linear Pottery zone. Farming was not introduced until the middle of the sixth millennium at the earliest and may, in fact, not have been adopted until 5200 B.P. (Kozlowski and Kozlowski, 1986, p. 105; Bogucki, 1987, p. 9). There is evidence for contact between the farming and the foraging groups (Bogucki, 1987; Cyrek et al., 1986) and for the adoption of pottery, but not of farming, by the local Mesolithic (Cyrek et al.9 1986; Kempisty, 1986; Wyszo mirska, 1987; Kozlowski and Kozlowski, 1986). To us, this shows that the late Mesolithic hunter-gatherers were within the availability zone, extending across northern Poland, for 1000-1200 years (Figs. 7, 12, and 16).</page><page sequence="32">264 Zvelebil and Dolukhanov There are elements both of the local Mesolithic culture (Kozlowski and Kozlowski, 1986; Bogucki, 1987) and of the Neolithic Linear Pottery/Lengyel cultures (Kozlowski and Kozlowski, 1986; Neustupny, 1987) among the first farming groups of the North European Plain, the Funnel Beaker culture. Com plex and tenuous arguments have been put forward in favor of both local and exogenous origins for the Funnel Beaker culture (i.e., Bogucki, 1987, vs. Neus tupny, 1987; Vend, 1986; Lichardus, 1976; Wislanski, 1973; Gimbutas, 1970; Hausler, 1985). For the moment, the evidence can best be explained in terms of fusion between the local Mesolithic and the Neolithic groups, with Meso lithic groups forming the principal component in most areas of the North Euro pean Plain and in the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea. The role of hunting remained considerable, wild animals frequently exceeding 50% of the sample [Bogucki, 1987; Kozlowski and Kozlowski (1986) note a range of 30-60% for the pro portion of wild forms]. Among the domesticates, pig and cattle predominate (Kozlowski and Kozlowski, 1986; Bogucki, 1987), and wheat and barley have been found directly associated with early Funnel Beaker ceramics (Bogucki, 1987). In summarizing the evidence, Bogucki notes that "the adoption of food production by the indigenous foragers of this area was not a "package deal" but, rather, the selective integration of exogenous cultigens and animals into the local economy" (1987, p. 2). This lends general support to our model for the transition to farming; the duration of the substitution phase within the Fun nel Beaker is difficult to assess on the present evidence, but it must have varied from region to region, reflecting the heterogeneity of this cultural group. In southern Scandinavia, contacts between the Erteb011e Mesolithic groups and the Linear Pottery and later farming groups in the south are well attested by the presence of shoe-last adzes of Linear Pottery origin in Denmark (Fischer, 1982) and on the Erteb^lle site of Rosenhof in Holstein (Larsson, 1988), pottery of Baalberg and Michelsberg type at Rosenhof (Schwabedissen, 1979), deco ration on Erteb^lle pots suggesting parallels with Rosen culture (Fischer, 1982), and other elements of material culture suggesting links across the agricultural frontier in northern Germany and Poland (Larsson, 1988; Jennbert, 1984; Price, 1985; Bogucki, 1987; Sherratt, 1990). Jennbert (1984, 1985) and Bogucki (1987, 1988) suggested that these links may have involved the exchange of foodstuffs between agricultural and foraging societies. In so doing, both soci eties would reduce the cost of food procurement: agriculturists of protein, for agers of carbohydrates (Bogucki, 1987, p. 8). Another commodity involved in such trading links may have been pelts of fur-bearing animals. In this context, the rise in the exploitation of fur-bearing animals in the late Erteb^lle, the exis tence of specialized sites for their exploitation (Ringkloster), and the clear evi dence indicating their use for pelts and not as food (Andersen, 1987) are all highly suggestive of trade. Detailed analyses (Rowley-Conwy, 1985) have failed to find clear evi</page><page sequence="33">Transition to Farming in Eastern and Northern Europe 265 dence for agriculture in Denmark before 5200-5100 B.P., postulated by some authors (Troels-Smith, 1982). The evidence for trade contacts, the use of pot tery (itself probably a technological loan from the agricultural groups in the south), and the lack of farming define the Erteb^lle as a culture in the avail ability phase of the transition to farming, a phase that lasted some 1200 years (Figs. 12 and 16). When the actual transition took place, it was rapid?so much so, that some workers regard it as archaeologically unrecognizable (Madsen, 1986). It is marked by the abandonment, in some regions, of the large Erteb^lle base camps at about 5200-5100 B.P., by the appearance of a full Neolithic economy as the principal mode of subsistence, and by the shift from a marine-dominated diet to a terrestrial one, a change attested by the carbon-13 isotope analysis of human skeletal remains (Tauber, 1982; Rowley-Conwy, 1983; Zvelebil and Rowley Conwy, 1986). New elements in pottery, lithic traditions, and architecture (causewayed camps and megaliths by the end of the Early Neolithic) led some to regard immigrant Funnel Beaker farmers as responsible for the introduction of full Neolithic economy (Becker, 1973; Troels-Smith, 1982). However, more recently, the evidence for continuity and a more gradual transition has begun to emerge. Most researchers dealing with the problem within the last 15 years agree that 4 it was the EBK (Erteb^lle) that through a shorter or longer period of time, and with greater or minor influences from the south was transformed into the TRB (Funnel Beaker culture)" (Madsen, 1986, p. 230, with refer ences). Many coastal hunting stations continued in use in the Early Neolithic, showing that hunting and gathering retained a role within the Funnel Beaker economy. Their importance varied from region to region within southern Scan dinavia (Nielssen, 1987; Jennbert, 1984; Wyszomirska, 1988). The continuity between the Erteb^lle and the Early Neolithic has also been observed in lithic technology, territorial and settlement continuity, and ceramic technology (Niel sen, 1987), while Sherratt (1990) has argued that the genesis of megaliths in northern Europe was an outcome of local communities adopting farming. Finally, Jennbert (1984, 1985) and Wyszomirska (1988) have identified Erteb011e-Funnel Beaker transitional layers at the Scanian settlements of Lod desborg and Nymolla III, containing the ceramics of both cultures and a mixed foraging-farming economy. Loddesborg has been radiocarbon-dated to 5210 B.P. + 80 years (LU-1842); the transitional period is thought to have lasted about 100 years (Jennbert, 1985, p. 196). This suggests that a substitution phase, even if a short one, must be rec ognized. Its duration may range from as little as 100 years to 400-500 years, corresponding to the Early Neolithic (Zvelebil and Rowley-Conwy, 1986). This is a reflection of the regional variation within southern Scandinavia (see also Larsson, 1990). The consolidation phase is marked by the appearance of causewayed</page><page sequence="34">266 Zvelebil and Dolukhanov camps, megalithic tombs, and major sites supported by a fully Neolithic econ omy. These developments occur in the Fuchsberg phase, which was transitional between the Early and the Middle Neolithic and is radiocarbon dated to about 4650 B.P. (Larsson, 1985; Zvelebil and Rowley-Conwy, 1986). Thus the pattern of the transition to farming in southern Scandinavia is marked by a long availability phase and a relatively short substitution phase. The reasons for this are to be sought in the relative stability and complexity of the Late Mesolithic in southern Scandinavia (Rowley-Conwy, 1983; Zvelebil and Rowley-Conwy, 1986; Madsen, 1986), where coastal foraging offered a viable alternative to farming. Its social and economic development was the main cause for the delay in the introduction of farming, but it also provided a viable base for its rapid adoption. The reasons why farming had to be ultimately adopted by the Ertebjzflle foragers remain a subject of debate; both ecological (Rowley-Conwy, 1983; Zvelebil and Rowley-Conwy, 1984, 1986) and social explanations have been advanced (Jennbert, 1984, 1985; Madsen, 1986). Northeastern Baltic The characteristic feature of this area was the longevity of the availability phase. Its beginning was marked by the adoption of ceramics and by the inten sification of contacts with the Neolithic farmers in the south and the west. As recent work indicates (Khotinskii, 1978; Timofeev et al., 1978; Dolu khanov et al., 1978; Timofeev, 1987; Dolukhanov et al., 1989), the initial spread of ceramics took place in the mid-seventh millennium B.P. and coin cided with a short-lived cool phase (Atlantic 2) within the Climatic Optimum. At this stage, a number of early "Forest Neolithic" cultures, marked by dif ferent pottery styles, coexisted in Eastern Europe (Fig. 7). The economy, set tlement pattern, and lithic and bone/antler inventories are seen as a direct development from the local Mesolithic (Sulimirski, 1970; Dolukhanov, 1979; Tretyakov, 1982; Timofeev, 1987). In the eastern Baltic, Bielorussia, and the northern Ukraine, the influence of the farming cultures of Central Europe is reflected in the ceramic decoration (Dolukhanov, 1986b). The distributions of amber products and flint artifacts also demonstrate the existence of contacts (Vankina, 1970; Gurina, 1973; Dolukhanov, 1979; Rimantiene, 1979). The remarkable florescence of the "Forest Neolithic" cultures occurred during the late Climatic Optimum (Atlantic 3) and the subsequent early Sub Boreal (ca. 5000-4000 B.P.). Large sites, often with evidence of year-round occupation (Vankina, 1970; Vereshchagin et al., 1979), were located either inside residual ice-dammed lakes in the morainic zone or by offshore lagoons. Many of these settlements seem to have been permanent villages, some of them built on stilts or wooden platforms extending into the lake shallows. Wooden houses, 30-50 m2 in area, had floors covered with birch or pine bark, stone lined hearths, and other internal features (Vankina, 1970; Dolukhanov and Mik</page><page sequence="35">Transition to Farming in Eastern and Northern Europe 267 lyayev, 1986; Zvelebil, 1987). Elaborate tool kits of bone, stone, and wood, ornaments of amber or bone, extensively decorated ceramics, and ritual objects reflected an ideological system clearly oriented toward wild, rather than domes tic, animals (Carpelan, 1976). Anthropomorphic deities are clearly distinct from the mother goddesses and other fertility symbols of ancient agricultural Europe (Gimbutas, 1974). In addition to a wide range of hunted, terrestrial fauna (Paaver, 1965; Zvelebil, 1989b), fish, fowl, and seals were important parts of the diet. The reliance on seal hunting increased during the sixth and fifth millennia B.P., culminating in the existence of specialized seal-hunting sites, such as Naakamae on the island of Saaremaa, where seal formed 92% of the mammalian bones (Paaver, 1965). The sites within residual ice-dammed lakes in the morainic zone are exam ples of a particularly enduring hunter-gatherer existence (Vereshchagin et al., 1979). In addition to hunting forest game for meat and fur, fowling for game birds and waterfowl, and fishing, there is also evidence for the collection of some 30 edible plant species, including water chestnut, acorns, sorrel, dande lion, reedmace, and waterlily. Of these, water chestnut, Trapa natans, seems to have been the most important. At Sarnate in Latvia, large lenses of Trapa shells, covering several square meters and reaching 40 cm in thickness, were deposited around hearths inside the dwellings. Burned remains of water chestnut have been also found among the ashes. Some dwellings contained wooden mal lets with Trapa shells embedded in their working surfaces. Water chestnut remains, sometimes in large quantities, as well as mallets similar to those at Sarnate, have been recovered from other sites in the eastern Baltic and northern Russia, (Vankina, 1970; Dolukhanov, 1979, 1986; Rimantiene, 1979), in Fin land (Auer, 1925; Zvelebil, 1981; Aalto etaL, 1985; Vuorela and Aalto, 1982), and in Sweden (Gaillard, 1984; M. Larsson, 1983; L. Larsson, 1990; Gaillard and Lemdahl, 1988). Although the deliberate cultivation of water chestnut can not be demonstrated, its processing seems to have been a widespread activity, requiring the development of a specialized tool kit. Water chestnuts may have been processed into flour, a practice known from the historical period (Vankina, 1970), thereby fulfilling the role that cereals played in other areas. Despite the presence of plant-processing and earth-working tools such as mattocks, pounders, and grating/cutting boards at Sarnate, Sventoji, and other sites, there are no cultivated plant remains with the exceptions of flax and of pollen evidence for millet at Sventoji (Rimantiene, 1979). Remains of flax cord found in one of the dwellings at Sventoji give us a clue as to why flax alone should be chosen for cultivation: flax rope was used to produce nets and other fishing gear. Rather than producing cereal staples, cultivation was in this case employed to maintain the foraging economy. Contacts with farmers intensified during the spread of the Corded Ware/</page><page sequence="36">268 Zvelebil and Dolukhanov Battle Axe cultures in central and northern Europe around 4500-3800 B.P. (Fig. 9). In northeastern Europe, new forms of burial, ceramics, and polished stone axes attest to this horizon, representing, in our view, cultural diffusion possibly accompanied by small-scale migration. As a result, several new cultures arose (East Baltic Corded Ware, North Bielorussian, etc.) showing the influence of Corded Ware material culture. At the same time, isolated bones of domesticated animals, mainly cattle and caprines, appear in the faunal assemblages. Domes ticates usually make up &lt; 10% of the sample (Paaver, 1965; Zvelebil, 1981), except at Krivina and Usvyaty, where they amount to 15 and 17% in the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age layers, respectively (Dolukhanov, 1979). The substitution and consolidation phases in much of northeastern Europe correspond to the Bronze and Iron Ages, dating to about 4000-1500 B.P. (Figs. 9, 13 and 14). The presence of cultigens and domesticates, although tenuous and subject to regional variation (Zvelebil, 1981, 1985; Zvelebil and Rowley Conwy, 1986; Dolukhanov, 1979, 1986b), is nevertheless widespread enough to show that a gradual substitution of the traditional economy by agropastoral farming was taking place (Fig. 16). This shift is associated with the abandon ment of the old coastal and lacustrine settlements in favor of the sandy clays and loams and other areas suitable for farming (Graudonis, 1967; Zvelebil, 1978, 1981). In the eastern Baltic, this process was not completed until the emergence of hillforts in the Iron Age at about 2500 B.P., while in southern Finland, the consolidation of farming did not occur until the fifth century A.D. Iron Age settlements of the later third millennium B.P. in the eastern Baltic and northwestern Russia (Stroked Pottery, Upper Duna, Milogradian, etc.) had a predominantly stock-breeding economy, with substantial reliance on hunting, fishing, and gathering (Graudonis, 1967; Dolukhanov, 1986b; Zvelebil, 1985). One reason for the greater stability of forager-farmer adaptations in north eastern Europe [as opposed to Denmark or Central Europe (see Rowley-Conwy, 1981)] may have been the greater role of slash-and-burn agriculture. Due to the edaphic conditions and conifer-dominated forest ecology of northeastern Europe, swidden farming presented a low-risk alternative to permanent arable (Zvelebil, 1981, 1987). Moreover, the social and ideological contexts of swidden farming and foraging are more alike than either of them is to arable (Sheldon, 1952; Zvelebil and Rowley-Conwy, 1984). The adoption of swidden by foragers, therefore, did not require the cognitive and social changes that usually accom pany permanent agriculture. Both swiddening and permanent arable were part of the economy during the medieval period, with swidden predominating in pioneer locations at the margins of the agricultural zone, such as central Fin land, Karelia, and northeastern Russia. The very gradual shift from foraging to farming obscures the substitution consolidation boundary. Faunal assemblages show that the decisive shift from hunting to farming in the eastern Baltic and adjacent areas was completed by</page><page sequence="37">Transition to Farming in Eastern and Northern Europe 269 about 2500 B.P., yet agricultural consolidation did not occur until the mid-first millennium A.D. In southern Finland and the eastern Baltic, there is convincing though indirect evidence of a major shift to permanent farming in the fifth to ninth centuries A.D., including palynological indicators for permanent arable, a shift in settlement location, the appearance of tools associated with arable, and the adoption of horses for traction (Huttunen, 1980; Toionen et al., 1976; Vuorela, 1975; Graudonis, 1967; Krasnov, 1971; Selirand and Tonisson, 1984; Dolukhanov, 1986b; Zvelebil, 1987). This shift marks the completion of the consolidation phase. CONCLUDING REMARKS Inevitably, in dealing with an area as vast as Eastern and Northern Europe, we have presented only a very general survey. Some areas, especially Northern Scandinavia, have not been covered in this review, although good regional syntheses do exist (Nygaard, 1987, 1989; Broadbent, 1979; Welinder, 1976). In these areas, and on the northern and eastern fringes of Europe, foraging remained an important source of food until the eighteenth or nineteenth century and, to some extent, still does today (Broadbent, 1985; Hvafner, 1965; Smith, 1977; Jutikkala, 1949). We have also been unable to do more than allude to many important aspects of the transition, such as social correlates of the transition to farming, season ally and settlement patterns, and taphonomic circumstances. The different pres ervation conditions in coastal and wetland sites in Northern and Eastern Europe, on one hand, and the poorly preserved sites in Central Europe, on the other, and the varying quality of excavation over this vast area add to the inconsistency of the archaeological record and accentuate perceived differences between com plex hunter-gatherers in Northern and Eastern Europe and their counterparts in the continental interior. Moreover, most of the important Mesolithic remains in Western and Southern Europe may lie on the submerged Early Holocene shore lines, thus aggravating the contrast between the impoverished western European and the rich eastern European Mesolithic. Despite these problems and omis sions, we believe that there are patterns common to the area as a whole and that these patterns must change our traditional perception of the transition to farming in Europe. In particular, we stress the following points. (1) On present evidence, the late Mesolithic and "Forest Neolithic" hunter-gatherers appear more sedentary, more numerous, and more complex in their social and economic organization than their central and western European counterparts. This is supported by evidence from southern Scandinavia, and the coastal and interior regions of northern Germany, Poland, the eastern Baltic, and northwestern Russia, regardless of any loss in the settlement pattern caused by the flooding of the Early Holocene coastlines.</page><page sequence="38">270 Zvelebil and Dolukhanov (2) We should not preclude the existence of a forest-zone husbandry of local, genetically undomesticated, but culturally husbanded resources. The evi dence for such a form of management is still tenuous, but mounting (Zvelebil, 1990; Van Zeist etaL, 1991; Dennell, 1983; Barker, 1985). In Eastern Europe, water chestnut among the plants and pig, cattle, and horse among the animals may have been locally domesticated (i.e., intensive collection, processing, and planting or taming, close herding, and later, selective breeding). With some plants and animals, horse and water chestnut among them, such practices will not be rapidly expressed in the genotype. Instead of contributing to the devel opment of a farming economy, these achievements contributed to the establish ment and maintenance of societies with complex, but essentially hunting and gathering economies, falling between our conventional concepts of Mesolithic and Neolithic. (3) The transition to farming occurred very slowly and took a long time to complete, the whole process lasting 1500-4000 years. In the far north and northeast of Europe, the process was never completed. In northeastern Europe, we have both a long availability phase (ca. 6500-4000 B.P.) and a long sub stitution phase (ca. 4000-2500 B.P.). In southern Scandinavia and the North European Plain, we have a long availability phase (ca. 6400-5200 B.P.) and a relatively short substitution phase (5200-4700 B.P. at most). In Moldavia and Ukraine, the availability and substitution phases spanned the period from 7500 to 5000 B.P. Although these are only approximate estimates, the length of the transition as a whole is certain, casting serious doubt on the notion that the spread of farming across Europe was a rapid process (Figs. 15 and 16). (4) Local hunter-gatherer societies played a significant role in the transi tion. There is strong evidence for continuity in material culture in most regions throughout the transition. Although this neither proves nor disproves the case for population movement associated with the transition (small groups of people could have migrated, leaving little or no trace in the archaeological record), such evidence does not support the colonization model for the transition to farm ing and it does indicate that local hunter-gatherer traditions were passed on from generation to generation during the long period of the adoption of farming. Local continuity in culture and population seems therefore a preferred expla nation. (5) For ecological reasons, it proved difficult to adjust the agropastoral farming system to the northern regions. Adjustments included a greater empha sis on the animal, rather than the cereal, component of farming, the selection of cultigens best adapted to vigorous boreal conditions (such as rye), the prac tice of slash-and-burn agriculture, and the development of a mixed economy, in which foraging continued to play a significant role, not least as insurance against failures in the agrarian system. (6) The reasons for the eventual adoption of farming in the northern and</page><page sequence="39">Transition to Farming in Eastern and Northern Europe 271 eastern regions of Europe are to be sought in ecological changes and the social conditions affecting hunter-gatherer societies. The two explanations are not nec essarily incompatible, although as Blankholm (1987) notes, they have often been treated as such. Complex hunter-gatherer systems are vulnerable to longer term, unpre dictable change in resource availability (Rowley-Conwy and Zvelebil, 1989). Within such a system, a decline in a single, but seasonally crucial, resource can render the adoption of farming an attractive alternative. The disappearance of the oyster from Denmark (Rowley-Conwy, 1983), the decline in seals in south ern Finland (Zvelebil, 1981), and the decline of various plant and animal spe cies with the Sub-Boreal climatic deterioration in the eastern Baltic area (Dolukhanov, 1979; Zvelebil, 1981) have all been advanced as explanations for the adoption of farming economies. At the same time, contacts and exchange with farming societies in Central Europe may have stimulated the development toward social differentiation among hunter-gatherer societies where some form of social stratification was already in existence (O'Shea and Zvelebil, 1984; Price, 1985; Madsen, 1986). The acquisition of prestige objects, symbols of status and of power, would create a need for increased production and impose constraints on the homeo static mechanisms usually found in hunter-gatherer societies (Bender, 1978), leading to the adoption of a more productive system?agropastoral farming. Madsen (1986) and Jennbert (1984, 1985) favor such social developments as the explanation for the transition to farming in southern Scandinavia. There is no reason why ecological and social conditions could not have acted together to bring about the adoption of farming: in both cases, the range of solutions to the problems caused by these conditions was set by the organization of the hunter-gatherer society. Much remains to be done to further our understanding of the origins and development of farming by hunter-gatherer societies in Europe. If, through the availability model, we have demonstrated that the causes of the agricultural transition are to be sought in the internal dynamics of the hunter-gatherer soci eties, and if we have restored the position of hunter-gatherers as active partic ipants in this transition, then our paper has served its purpose.
