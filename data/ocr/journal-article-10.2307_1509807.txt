No one view has dominated the spectrum of Jewish interpretations, since the biblical text is the only common frame for the wide variety of speculations. At issue is whether the one God depicted in the Hebrew Bible is manifest to humans di- rectly or through the agency of a divine, semidivine, or created power. Even the nature of angelic figures in the Bible remains a matter of debate, both in its original context and through later interpretations. Does the angelic figure physically represent God's form, or is it a liter- ary device that metaphorically describes God's presence? The same is true of divine anthropomorphism in the Bible. Do the descriptions of God's hands or feet imply that God possesses a definite shape similar to that of human bodies, or should these descriptions also be viewed meta- phorically, reinforcing a similar view to that expressed about angelic figures: no physical characteristics can be attributed to anything heav- This article is dedicated to Professor Elliot Wolfson; the study was made possible through grants from the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture and a Warburg post- doctoral fellowship at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

Finally, how does this accord with the spatial manifes- tation of God in the tabernacle through his kavod or glory?1 Rabbinic literature adds another layer of ambiguity to the early defi- nition of God's being, describing God's interaction with humanity in terms of divine attributes (middot) or the divine presence (shekhina). It is not always clear whether these terms refer only to mythic objectifi- cations of divine qualities or attributes, or whether they also should be viewed metaphorically. In these texts, what constitutes God centers on the identification of a divine attribute with the action of the divine or with the divine being itself. When is an attribute a literary means of describing divine activity, and when is it personified as a hypostatic element, receiving an identity of its own, while nevertheless partaking in the divine ontology? The latter appears to be the case when the physical manifestation of God is not excluded from the divine being. This link between anthropomorphism and the boundaries of divine on- tology has been suggested in a recent study of early rabbinic midrashic texts by Michael Fishbane, where the middot of God were found to refer to a hypostatic view of divine anthropomorphism. Fishbane argues, there- fore, that in certain rabbinic texts, fragments of an esoteric doctrine concerning the "measures" of the divine glory can be detected.2 While no single formula can state when there is change in the defi- nition of what constitutes the divine, the overlap in descriptions of God, angel, and human is fertile ground for such reevaluations.3 For example, these lines were blurred to a great degree in the traditions concerning Enoch who ascended to heaven. On this issue, Moshe Idel has drawn our attention to texts that understand Enoch to be the angelic figure of lSee for example, Baruch Levine, "On the Presence of God in Biblical Religion," in Jacob Neusner, ed., Religions in Antiquity: Essays in Memory of Erwin Ramsdell Goodenough (Leiden: Brill, 1968) 71-87. 2Michael Fishbane, "The Measures of God's Glory in the Ancient Midrash," in Ithamar Grunwald, ed., Messiah and Christos: Studies in Jewish Origins of Christianity Presented to David Flusser (Tubingen: Mohr/Siebeck, 1992) 53-74. 3See the profound discussion of Morton Smith ("The Image of God: Notes on the Hellenization of Judaism, with Especial Reference to Goodenough's work on Jewish Sym- bols," BJRL 40 [1985] 473-512, esp. 473-81), who offers many examples in rabbinic literature of the dynamic between the three.

Due to the elevated status of the angelic Metatron in certain early traditions, Metatron was appropriated and his nature redefined in medieval texts in the articulation of a com- plex godhead which contained multiple powers. I shall discuss the trans- formations of Metatron through various systems in light of the larger issue of the confusion between God and angel, particularly with respect to the intention of prayer. I shall also show that the career of Metatron illuminates the development of Jewish mystical attitudes toward God, divine attributes, intermediary beings, angels and the kabbalistic under- standing of the ten powers of the divine theosophy called sefirot. g Elisha's Viewing of Metat.ron One of the earliest descriptions of Metatron is found in the Babylonian Talmud (b. Hag. 15a and parallels), where we are told that the second- century rabbi Elisha ben Abuya was granted permission to see Metatron sitting and writing down the merits of Israel. Elisha is notably shocked by what he perceives and says, "It is taught as a tradition that 'On high there is no sitting and no emulation, no back and no weariness.' Per- haps- God forfend! there are two divinities." Elisha's response is con- sidered blasphemous and from this moment on Elisha is deemed a heretic, and named Aher, "the other." While the precise nature of his heresy is never fully explained in this context, he is accused of "cutting the shoots."5 4See Moshe Idel, "Enoch is Metatron," Immanuel 24/25 (1990) 220-40; and idem, "Metatron Comments on the Development of Jewish Myth," in H. aviva Pediah, ed., Myth in Jewish Thought (Ber Sheva: Ber Sheva University Press, forthcoming) [Hebrew]. While the former study focuses on the boundaries between human and angel, the latter empha- sizes the nature of the angel as a manifestation or extension of God, a point that will be explored in the present study through different and later texts. On the association of the divine "face" with angelic manifestations, see Ele'azar ha-Darshan (Sefer Gematriot, Munich MS 221, 157a): "the numerical equivalent of'his face' is 'the angels' [= 146]"; s9nDn:: l9: :C:R5n;n. sThe depiction of this event in 3 Enoch is also ambiguous.

In other words, according to most scholars, Elisha erred by perceiving that a heavenly being other than God was divine as well, and therefore Elisha had appended a sec- ond deity to the one God. The heavenly enthronement or "sitting" of Metatron, which was apparently a sign to Elisha that Metatron was him- self divine, supports this understanding of Elisha's heresy. Scholars such as Alan Segal have studied this text against the background of the her- esy of "two powers in heaven." It seems that a consensus has been formed in the scholarly literature that in early Jewish literature, includ- ing that of the Talmud, "the basic heresy involved interpreting scripture to say that a principal angelic or hypostatic manifestation in heaven was equivalent to God."7 Elisha's heresy is initially described by his uttering an unorthodox belief concerning the nature of God. Later midrashic interpretations in the form of additional stories about Elisha's sins were incorporated into the rabbinic corpus in order to explain further Elisha's repudiation.8 It seems, therefore, that in the late rabbinic period, the tradition concern- ing the heretical belief was lost or misunderstood. Regarding Elisha's sin or heresy, Yehudah Liebes discussed in detail several explanations, according to the various literary formulations in the parallels to Hagiga as well as the interpretations provided in later Jewish literature. In ex- plaining "cutting of the shoots," Liebes focused on the form and context of Elisha's hubris during his "ascension" into the pardes (literally, "or- chard"). This conception of Elisha's hubris is supported by Eccl 5:5 ('It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not fulfill it"), which is cited in the parable. Concerning the view that Elisha sinned by misconstruing the nature of God, Liebes pointed to a later passage from Hekhalot Zutarti where Metatron's sitting and writing down 6See below nn. 7-l l for a bibliography concerning the various studies.

For this reason, Metatron received sixty lashes to distinguish him from God. According to the author of this passage in Hekhalot Zutarti, then, it is clear that Metatron is a lower being.9 Hugo Odeberg offered early evidence suggesting that Metatron was a hypostatic being. Odeberg argued that in the Hekhalot work known as 3 Enoch, Metatron is the lower or lesser potency of the divine; Odeberg drew attention to Metatron's being called na'ar, which he understood as "youth." Odeberg compared this term to the parallel term "lesser yah," based on the Hebrew form of the divine name, which can be found in Gnostic literature. 10 Scholem later commented, following an old frag- ment that rendered the term na'ar in Aramaic as shamasha, that na'ar in this context must be understood to mean "servant" and not "youth." This alternative reading implies that instead of being an aspect or po- tency of God's being, Metatron is a distinct heavenly being, presumably an angel, and is subservient to the commands of God.ll Scholem did not at first commit himself to one interpretation of Elisha's heresy. He suggested instead that qig;u; ba-neti'ot ("the cutting of the shoots") refers to transgressions of the commandments.l2 Later Scholem amended his view, stating that the term should be understood "in the literal sense of the phrase": of those who entered the pardes (here un- derstood literally as an orchard), Elisha went beyond the foul act of helping himself to the trees of the orchard-he also destroyed them.l3 Scholem's interpretation therefore gives great weight to the meaning of the term "cutting" for understanding the nature of Elisha's heresy. Scholem's interpretation lies somewhere between the poles of a meta- phoric reading of the "cutting," where it is a term for heresy in general, 9Liebes, Elisha's Sin, 34-35.

A number of scholars, who sought to understand the phrase "cutting of the shoots" through a comparison of its usage in other texts and contexts, and not only in the context of the narrative in Hagiga, argued for the former view.l4 In his study of 3 Enoch, Charles Mopsik suggested the latter, literalist position. Based on the immediate context alone, Mopsik suggests that Elisha "cut" the (angelic) logos, named Metatron, away from God.ls Elisha's error then was not his elevation of an angelic being to equality with God, but rather his isolation and con- sequent exclusion of an aspect that was intrinsic to the divine unity.l6 Although the rabbis may have held additional views about the nature of angels which preclude this reading, at least in this context, the back- ground for Elisha's heresy seems to be the orthodox belief that Metatron is ultimately one with God, a conception similar to that of a logos in Christian and Gnostic thought.l7 This approach to the pardes account in general and the role of Metatron in particular can be found in the works of some kabbalists, beginning in the early thirteenth century. Although it may seem that we are reading a rabbinic text through the lenses of the kabbalistic world view, the understanding of the continuous or organic being of the divine, which 14Efraim E. Urbach claimed ("The Traditions about Merkabah Mysticism in the Tannaitic Period," in Studies in Mysticism and Religion Presented to Gershom Scholem [Jerusalem: Magnes, 1967] 13-14 [Hebrew]), for example, that the pardes referred to the vision of the merkabah, wherein the "cutting" is the sin of revealing the secrets he learned there. In his detailed study of the textual traditions of this passage, David Halperin (The Merkabah in Rabbinic Literature, 90) agreed that it outlines a metaphor, but maintained that "the ref- erent of the metaphors remains a mystery." Henry Fischel (Rabbinic Literature and Greco- Roman Philosophy [Leiden: Brill, 1973] 19) criticized any consensus that "the cutting of the shoots" refers to a mystical experience, but "corresponds to the death and insanity of the two visitors. . . it indicates what happened to Aher after he left."

I6To be sure, the "cutting" alone does not constitute the heresy described, but rather the independence of will or governance that is implied in isolating a hypostasis, as noted already in geonic literature (Liebes, Elisha's Sin, 11). 17This idea was already forwarded by David Neumark (Geschichte der judischen Philosophie des Mittelalters [2 vols.; Berlin: Reimer, 1907] 1. 93) at the beginning of this century; and compare Jarl Fossum, The Name of God and the Angel of the Lord: Samaritan and Jewish Concepts of lntermediation and the Origin of Gnosticism (Tubingen: Mohr/ Siebeck, 1985) 310. In a tradition from the Sar-Torah material of the Hekhalot texts (Schafer, Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur, 124 [ยง 279 = 678]), Metatron is described as "Metatron, Lord God of Israel, God of the heavens and the Earth."

As Shlomo Pines has shown,l8 Nahmanides' view that the divine glory (shekhina) is not separate from God and cannot be thought of as a created being can be found already in the second century, in Justin Martyr's dialogue with Trypho the Jew. Justin records that (at least some of) the Jews believe that the presence of God in the world, described in terms of a divine angel, glory, or Iogos, depends on the instructions of God. This glory "cannot be cut and separated (at,urltov 6ยฃ Kal aXxpl6X0v) from the Father, just as when the light of the sun shines on the earth, it cannot be cut and separated from the sun in heaven.''l9 In the passage from Nahmanides' Commentary to the Torah discussed by Pines, Nahmanides explicitly takes issue with Maimonides (and with the tenth-century sage Sa'adia Ga'on by inference), and seeks to charac- terize the fundamental difference between his tradition and Maimonides' Aristotelian world view.20 The difference centers around the inclusion or exclusion of the divine manifestation within the godhead. Nahmanides posits an organic or continuous relationship between God's being and that of the angel that is, they are both immanent rn the same divine substance. Pines and Mopsik posit a more complex model of divine theology in early Jewish thought than was previously suggested.2l Independent of the particular doctrine they describe, however, in rabbinic literature we find a mythic depiction of divine attributes that provides the general back- ground for the doctrine of a hypostatic form that represents God in the world. In the Babylonian Talmud (b. Ber. 7a) we read of the dynamic relationship between the divine attributes of mercy and judgment, with- out any objection to the possible implications concerning God's unity. While the mythic description of God's attributes may be seen as nothing more than a complex metaphor, this text may point to the rabbinic ac- ceptance of hypostatic powers in the godhead. In the context of this 18Shlomo Pines, "God, the Divine Glory and.the Angels according to a 2nd Century Theology," in Joseph Dan, ed., The Beginnings of Jewish Mysticism, vol. 6 (3-4): Jerusa- lem Studies in Jewish Thought (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1987) 1-14 [Hebrew].

Ber. 7a), the divine attributes are presented as aspects of a single divine will and not as competing powers that would result in a dualism.22 That is to say, rabbinic theology could withstand, and may have even encouraged, the mythic or dramatic depiction of God's at- tributes in various forms, including at times a logos-like manifestation, depicted as an angelic being such as Metatron. (Of course, not all hy- postases or angels enjoy this status.) Those who adopt a more literal understanding of the rabbis' view of divine unity may find any hint of plurality to be heretical. Here, however, I argue that the rabbis objected only to an opposition or competition of wills. Following this view, Elisha's declaration that there are -shtei reshuyot (literally, "two powers") should be translated according to the heretical view of "two ruling authorities" and not the acceptable view of "two powers" in heaven.23 g Prayer and the Divine Hypostasy in Ashkenazi Sources The distinction between God and a hypostasized Metatron comes to the fore in medieval European Jewish mysticism in the prekabbalistic works of the German Pietists.24 The doctrine of the ten hypostatic pow- ers known as sefirot is absent from their system; their theology centered upon the hypostasized glory, or shekhina. Elliot Wolfson recently has shown how the distinctions between older traditions concerning the di- vine glory, the shekhina, Metatron, and the divine anthropos were blurred in certain Ashkenazi texts, and how the identifications between them can be found prior to the appearance of the sefirotic kabbalah.25 At the risk of oversimplifying the associations Wolfson detailed, the various identifications offer a bridge between the more general symbol- ism of divine presence and the more specific divine manifestations of a human or angelic form. By doing so, the divine glory, which the tenth- century Jewish philosopher Sa'adia Ga'on excluded from the godhead as a created being separate from God, has once again been included within it. The importance of this move cannot be overestimated, for while the 22Compare with David Stern, "Imitatio Hominis: Anthropomorphism and the Character(s) of God in Rabbinic Literature," Prooftexts 12 (1992) 151-74, esp. 164-67.

According to the internal logic of these prekabbalistic theological systems, once physical attributes not shared by God are predicated to the shekhina, either the shekhina must be excluded from the godhead to preserve Godss formless being, or the nature of the godhead must be readdressed. This reassessment took place in the circles of Jewish mystics in thir- teenth-century Germany and Spain. I argue that this was a result of the associations between the divine presence and the manifestations in hu- man form outlined by Wolfson. The shift in the view of the shekhina and of angelic figures in those circles is most clearly seen in their various stances toward prayer. To demonstrate the reassessment that bridged these identifications, I shall outline three models, drawing ex- amples for each from Ashkenazi texts of the twelfth and thirteenth cen- turies. While examples for some of these models can be found in both the early rabbinic corpus and later mystical works, the immediate dis- cussion will be confined to the period just prior to the emergence of the kabbalah, where the unfolding of these new associations is most rel- evant. In the first model, the shekhina is a term "used when the manifesta- tion of the Lord and His nearness to man are spoken of"27 that is, the shekhina does not indicate a hypostasis, but is identified with God. The earliest medieval identification of Metatron with God that I was able to locate is found in a comment attributed to R. Tam (France, 1100-1171). This tradition is offered as a response to the rabbinic interpretation that Metatron is the angel mentioned in Exod 23:20: "I am sending an angel before you to guard you on the way, and to bring you to the place I have made ready."28 It appears that R. Tam (or perhaps Pseudo-R Tam) was uncomfortable with the view that God acts through an angelic agent and wished to predicate the role of "guard of Israel" to God alone. Because R. Tam could not reject the formulation of the received biblical text and abolish one of the two referents, God and the angel, nor could he deny the rabbinic tradition that Metatron is the angelic guide as explained in the verse, he interpreted the "angel" who "guards the way" 26See, for example, Efraim E. Urbach, The Sages: Their Concepts and Beliefs (trans. Israel Abrahams; Jerusalem: Magnes, 1975) 43. 27Ibid 28For sources see Menahem Kasher, Torah Shelema (42 vols.; New York: n.p., 1960) 19. 228-29; and see further in the following notes.</page><page sequence="10">300 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW as none other than God himself. This he accomplished by pointing to another verse (Exod 23:1 3) where God guards the Israelites in their journey.29 And R. Tam commented that the Holy One blessed be He is himself called Metatron as is said in the Pesiqta30 [Exod 23:13] ;'and the Lord walked before them all the day.' The Holy One said I was the guide [nl:b:n]3l for my children, that is, their guard.32 Due to the brevity of the passage, it is not clear whether the author wished to state that God is described as an angel, or that God functions in the world through such a manifestation, which should nevertheless be identified with God, or whether the author's comment applies to all angelic beings or only to the one specified in the verse. Because of the specific interest in the prior midrashic associations of Metatron as a guide (menitor), however, I believe that the tradition speaks directly of 29George Moore ("Intermediaries in Jewish Thought," HTR 15 [1922] 74) argues for the force of this idea, independent of this scriptural exegesis. See further Amos Goldreich, ed., Me'irat Einayim (Jerusalem: Institute for Advanced Studies, 1981) 1 12-13. 30I was not able to locate this passage in the text. 3lConcerning this etymology of the name Metatron, see Gen R. 5.4 and Nathan ben Yihi'el's dictionary as discussed by Gershom G.

Another possibility is that nl:9:: refers to Mentor, Telemachus's teacher in Homer's Odyssey, the paradigmatic guide, whose name has en- tered the English language as a synonym to "tutor" or "teacher." I?obert Lamberton (Homer the Theologian: Neoplatonist Allegorical Reading and the Growth of the Epic Tradition [Berkeley: California University Press, 1989] 56) recently published a thorough study of the uses of Homer in classical and medieval philosophy. I find there no information, however, which could be used to support our suggestion. It thus requires further research. My thanks to Tzvi Langermann for this comment. On the issue of Metatron's identification as "prince of the world" see further b. Hul. 60a and t. Hul 60av The interpretation of Metatron as na'ar using Ps 37:25 can already be found in the Talmud and throughout kabbalistic works. See, for example, Yehoshu'a Ibn Shu'aib, Derashot al ha-Torah (Krakow: n.p., 1575) 24b; and the anonymous Sefer Ma'arethet ha-Elohut (Mantua: Me'ir ben Efrayim, 1558) 72b. It may be that the various midrashim of God appearing as a young warrior at the Red Sea (the Exodus) and as an old man at Mount Sinai (the giving of the Torah) may already be predicated to Metatron in b. Yebamot through the scriptural proof. This would suggest that, as later texts state explicitly, Metatron refers to the various physical mani- festations or representations of God.

In other words, the author absorbs the role, appellation, and traditions concerning the angel Metatron into the simple identity of God. In the texts where God's presence is understood figuratively, it stands to reason that the discussion of prayer directed to a second being is completely absent. In turn, the heretical nature of prayer, directed at an angelic being which, in contrast to the shekhina, is a created entity, is beyond question. An example of this can be found in the early and short version of a work called the Seventy Names of Metatron. As I have argued elsewhere, by tracking the development of the doctrine of the divine glory through the versions of this text, one can place the short version no later than the generation of R. Yehudah he-Hasid (d. 1217).33 According to the tradition concerning the name Miton, Metatron re- ceives prayers from Israel and transfers them "on high": This is the Prince of the Countenance to whom we request to raise our prayers on high [to be placed] on the head of the Holy One blessed be He.34 [And the name Miton] is the numerical equivalent of the hand of God [n tl: = 115] for he grasps the whole world in his hand and its numerical equivalent is ;'upon God" [n b;? = 115]. And so [he is] upon Him [Xm: b;? = 115], [that is], He [Metatron] endures the whole world and he rests on the "back" of the Holy One.35 Metatron is here an intermediary being, distinct from God, but depen- dent upon him. In the passage immediately preceding, Metatron, "the 33Daniel Abrams, "'The Secret of Secrets': The Concept of the Divine Glory and the Intention of Prayer in the Writings of 1?.

An example can be found in the thirteenth-century Ashkenazi treatise on the unity of God by R. Ele'azar ha-Darshan, the grandson of R. Yehudah he-Hasid. He concludes this short piece, entitled "Secret of [Divine] Unity," with a warning that suc- cinctly summarizes his view: "And one should be careful not to pray and bow except before the Holy One, blessed be He, and not to the shekhina, for indeed the shekhina herself prays before the Holy One." The full import of this doctrine is discussed elsewhere.38 Here the shekhina is not only distinguished from God, but relates to God through prayer just as humanity does. It seems to me that in this text, prayer is the primary concern of the author and is not incidental to his view of the shekhina, as may be the case in the comment from the Seventy Names of Metatron discussed above (p. 301). In both texts, the shekhina, also referred to as the divine glory, is separate from God but not inde- pendent of God. While Ele'azar ha-Darshan's comment is very brief, it is clear that to him the shekhina not only shares the aspect of prayer before God with humanity, but possibly also a will or needs of its own. As the treatise makes clear, the shekhina is subservient to the invisible form of God, is dependent upon it, and in no way constitutes an oppos- ing or equivalent power. This doctrine is repeated with variations in the longer version of the Seventy Names of Metatron which contains most of the shorter version (although sometimes in a revised form).39 The major theme, absent in the 36It is not fully clear who is the subject of this clause, offering the praise Metatron or the shekhina. I have suggested that Metatron offers the praise, based on the context of the traditions in this version of the text. On Metatron's functions and place in the divine world relative to the throne see Meir Bar Ilan, "The Throne of God: What is Under it, What is Opposite It and What Is Near It," Da'at 15 (1985) 21-36 [Hebrew]. 37Rome MS, Angelica 46, fol. 38a. The final words concerning Metatron's praising God are absent from the printed edition, but can be found in the manuscripts, including its later reworkings; for example, Berlin MS, fol. 116b and Firenze MS, fol. 243b (see n. 39 below). On the importance of Metatron's praise, see Daniel Abrams, "The Shekhina Prays Before God: A New Text Toward the Theosophic Orientation of the German Pietists and Their Method for the Transmission of Esoteric Doctrines," Tarbi; (forthcoming) [Hebrew]. 38See Abrams, "The Shekhina Prays Before God"; and idem, "'The Unity of God' of R. Ele'azar ha-Darshan," Qove; al Yad 12 (1994) 149-60 [Hebrew]. 39It is important to note that the esoteric doctrine of Ele'azar of Worms, Yehudah he- Hasid's main student, can be found in the longer version(s), particularly in the Sefer ha- Hesheq. The longer text itself can be found in different versions, a point that cannot be</page><page sequence="13">DANIEL ABRAMS 303 short version and added to the expanded version(s) of the text, is Metatron's role in humanity's prayer to God. In the long versions, Metatron's role is to assist Israel in its prayers and recall its merits before God.40 Following the tradition mentioned in Hagiga, Metatron "records the merits of Israel and pleads [to God] on their behalf, and [therefore] the Holy One blessed be He shows mercy to them.''4l Metatron is clearly an intermediary figure fully explored in this context. See Abrams, "The Concept of Divine Glory." It should also be noted that Asi Farber has already commented on the affinity between the dual nature of Metatron in Sefer ha- .Hesheq and the doctrine of the sanctified cherub; see Farber "The Concept of the Merkabah in Thirteen-Century Jewish Mysticism: 'Sod ha-Egoz' and its Development" (Ph.D. diss., Hebrew University, 1986) 559 [Hebrew]. The printed version of Sefer ha-Hesheq (Lemberg: Epstein, 1865; reprinted in Sefarim Qedoshim mi-Talmidei ha-Besht ha-Qadosh, vol. 34: Sefer ha-Hesheq [Union City, NJ: Gross, 1984]), if not written at least in part by Ele'azar of Worms, was composed by a student who was familiar with his doctrine and the emergence of a new and developing esoteric theology. While all the versions of the Seventy Names of Metatron touch upon the issue of prayer, there is a stronger concentration of traditions on this matter in the printed version which parallels certain manuscripts. I shall therefore discuss Metatron's role according to this text, while citing in the notes parallel traditions from the other versions. As noted by Yehudah Liebes ("The Angels of the Shofar and Yeshu'a Sar ha-Panim," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 6 (1987) 171-96 [Hebrew]), the manuscripts of Sefer ha-Hesheq differ from the printed edition (Lemberg, 1865), the text-tradition of which can be found as well (with variations) in Oxford MS 1748, fols. 25a-44a. Dan ("The Seventy Names of Metatron," 19- 23) compared the printed edition to Berlin-Tubingen MS Or. 4ยฐ 935, fols. 112a-118a and concluded that they were composed by R. Yehudah he-H. asid and R. Ele'azar of Worms. Yehudah Liebes noted further differences between the various textual traditions. It seems, however, that the versions discussed by Dan represent the second and possibly third stages of the text's literary development with little change between the last two. Moreover, Firenze- Lurziana MS 2.5, fols. 237a-246a also differs from the versions mentioned here. It displays strong parallels to passages found only in the printed version. It must be noted that the texts may not necessarily reflect a linear development, but could have been reedited simul- taneously by different authors. Further study is required to identify all of the additions and editings that altered the order of the passages. Finally, the more readily available Lemberg edition shows strong similarities to the very rare edition of Ayin Shemot de-Metatron (Williamsdorf: Moshe Graff, 1677) and may have been printed from it. In this volume, the text is preceded by selections from 3 Enoch 5-15. See further Nehemiah Brull, "Miscellen," Jahrbucherfur Judische Geschichte und Literatur 1 (1874) 221-25; and P. S.

The line between angelic intermediary and divine being becomes blurred when Metatron is described as he who is "appointed to receive the prayers from Israel,"42 implying that he may be the final destination of the prayers, able to answer them independently without conveying them to God. Accordingly, in another passage, it is Metatron who acts as advocate or intercessor for Israel. He "prays for them and vindicates them" when "the Holy One, blessed be He, is angry with them."43 It follows that prayers may be directed to Metatron or through him: "And this refers to the Prince of the Countenance, whom we request to offer our prayers to 'on high' [to place them] on the head of the Holy One, blessed be He."44 Here too, Metatron is an intermediary figure who does not answer the prayers himself but transfers them or offers them before God. In this body of traditions, Metatron also assumes the role of God, inasmuch as he is the final destination of the prayers. The danger, as R. Ele'azar ha-Dashan perceived it, is that if Metatron is the final destina- tion of the prayers, he may possess a will of his own; and from the perspective of those offering the prayers, Metatron may be understood as a deity, as the object of these prayers. The author warns against this conception and instructs that: He [Metatron] commands the angels to praise the King of the Glory, and he is among them. This is what the poet has written: "The great of Israel shall call out with their voices the greatness of the Lord, the King."4s And also, do not think in your heart [during this prayer] about the Prince of the Countenance, that he is the Deity [n15R], because his power is very great and tremendous; rather God is the King. And he is called according to the name of his master, as it is written [Exod 23:21 ]: 'Do not defy him because My name is in him,' that is to say: do not substitute46 [God for] him, because My name is in him. And he has no [independent] ability to cause harm, but only through the power of his great Name.47 42Sefer ha-Hesheq ยง 24 (p. 4a). Firenze MS, fol. 242b.

Not only has Metatron assumed various roles as a mediator, which in earlier texts were ascribed only to God, but here the distinctions are minimized to the point that the author must emphasize that Metatron is indeed not God. One final passage, which highlights the blurring of the boundaries between God and Metatron, deserves consideration. According to the different reading of passage thirty-nine in another version of Sefer he- Hesheq,48 "One of the seventy names of Metatron, ::p:, numerically equals 'your Creator' [= 229], because after the Creator, he is supreme [among the archons]."49 Here, Metatron is named the creator. Although the demiurgic role is given to Metatron in other texts, such as in the works of Ibn Ezra,5ยฐ in Ashkenazi sources, God is usually termed "the creator" (Rm1nn). Here again R. Ele'azar ha-Dashan finds it necessary to explain that although he is supreme, Metatron is nevertheless an angel.Sl In the third model, the shekhina can be defined separately from God's other aspects or powers, but remains an indispensible part of the divine pleroma, namely the kabbalistic doctrine of the ten sefirot. In this sys- tem, the shekhina harmoniously works in consort with the nine other ontic grades of the divinity. As plainly stated by the kabbalists, to pray to the shekhina alone is to separate her from the arrangement of powers and to give her being a separate ontic root. By separating out this sefirah, the shekhina has been allotted an independence that provides for addi- tional authority and governance parallel and equal to that of God. The doctrine of the sefirot, therefore, lends itself to a paradoxical view of the shekhina with respect to prayer; on the one hand, one cannot pray to the shekhina without committing a grave heresy, and on the other hand, to avoid the shekhina in prayer is to deny the existence of an integral aspect of the godhead. The prescribed practice of the kabbalists regarding the intention of prayer, therefore, is to direct one's prayer at this divine grade while connecting it in one's thought to the remaining nine. after the power of the Creator, his [Metatron's] power is very great."

According to these works,54 God cannot appear before humans nor can God directly receive a person's prayer, which is a prod- uct of the material world. Instead, God receives prayers via the cherub who sits on the throne of glory. This is an interpretation of Ezekiel's vision of a seated human form (Ezek 1:26) and the singular usage of the "cherub" in Ezek 10:4.55 The authors of these texts are as concerned with distancing anthropomorphisms from the "cause of causes" as they are with giving independent authority to the cherub. The relationship between these divine powers is repeatedly stressed in terms of upward and downward movements of the blessings or an efflux, "which unites the multiple powers as one."56 52See for example, Todros b. Yosef Abulafia, Sefer O;ar ha-Kavod ha-Shalem (War- saw: 1879) 24a: nt: Ut Cn':ยฃUl :nnlnn :bmDnn rsPs "that he cut the two distinct beings and separated them from each other."

Due to the variations in their synthesis of the Ashkenazi traditions concerning the cherub with the doctrine of the sefirot, these texts can illustrate collectively the stages in the gradual blending of the Ashkenazi orientations with the sefirotic doctrine of the Spanish kabbalah. I shall limit the following discussion of the development of the sanctified cherub doctrine to the cherub's relationship to Metatron and the divine world. One of the earliest works of this body of literature is the Pesaq ha- Yir'ah, a short text consisting of some five hundred words. The basic doctrine of the circle is established here; the cherub emanates [L7vs] from the "great fire" and assumes all those attributions of physical form that could be applied to God. The aspect of God that has no form is termed the "divine glory" or "his holiness," while that which does have form is termed "his kingdom," the "Shi'ur Qomah," or "the cherub." "Holiness" is located in the west and the "kingdom" in the east. Although these locations may be understood as points on the divine map of the ten sefirot, this only holds true for later texts written according to this the- ology.57 In the collection of commentaries to the prayers, collected and edited by R. Shem Tov b. Simha in the fourteenth or fifteenth century, the cherub is directly identified with the lowest grade of the divine; "One should not err-in his thoughts about the sefirot because they are all degrees [nlL7s:] of the Creator. And the tenth degree [=sefirah] is the sanctified cherub, to which the angels above direct their praise [so that their praise] will go before the Cause of Causes without separation and without cutting."58 While this text explicitly states that one should clear the mind of all thoughts except those concerning the creator,59 blessings must nevertheless be directed through the cherub. When one enters the synagogue in the morning to pray, he should direct60 his prayers so that they will be accepted by the Creator, 57See Moscow MS, fols. 187b and 189a. Pesaq ha-Yir'ah influenced various other texts, including Menah. em Zioni, Commentary on the Torah (Lemberg: Zis, 1882) 35a, 39a; and Nuremberg ms, Cent V. App. 5/2, esp. fols. 82a, 90a-91a, an anonymous text that repeat- edly cites the Pesaq. For further discussion see Joseph Dan, "Pesaq ha-Yir'ah ve-ha- Emunah and the Intention of Prayer in Ashkenazi Esotericism," Frankfurter Judaistische Beitrage 19 (1991 -92) 185-215. 58Moscow ms, fol. 183a; and Zurich MS, fol. 20b.

And when the Holy One blessed be He sends efflux to the Cherub through the emanated potencies [nl:n], the Cherub sends the efflux to Israel on high and from there to Israel that is below. And behold this is sufficient for the initiates.62 And so they should not err with their prayers and "cut" and separate [a potency] by say- ing God forbid that there are two ruling powers, because we have strong faith that all [exists] by the cause of the Creator whom thoughts cannot comprehend. And he is called the Cause of Causes.63 The reference to "two ruling powers" is a clue concerning the author's relationship to earlier sources, implying the pardes account and Elisha's heresy. The cherub, therefore, has been identified with the lowest sefirah and the angel Metatron. A passage from R. Shem Tov's edition of the material reinforces the identification between Metatron and the cherub: "'Do not defy him' [Exod 23:21], that is, you should intend your prayer to him."64 As noted above, the verse from Exodus is generally understood as a description of the angel Metatron. If Metatron and the cherub, however, are the tenth sefirah as has been suggested, it is difficult to define the "Israel on high" which lies below it in the divine world. While the cherub could be identified with a higher sefirah, such as TifDeret, and the "Israel on high" could be identified with the tenth sefirah, it seems that the symbolism focuses on the lowest grade and reflects the merging of tra- ditions of Metatron as an angel and the angelic cherub as the lowest 6IZurich MS, fol. 20a mistakenly reads "creator." 62Literally, "those who understand." 63Moscow MS, fols. 181b-182a; and Zurich MS, fol. 20a. Compare to the significantly different reading in New York MS (Microfilm, JTSA) 2430, fol. 65b published in Dan, "Prayer Intentions," 48. In this reading the efflux is replaced with the sefirot and the cherub is that which was emanated. In what may be an intended corruption of the text, the distinction between the two "Israels" is eliminated. See Scholem's comment (Origins of the Kabbalah, 215), bracketed inside his translation of this passage from the New York MS.

Although they are similar in their possession of an anthropomor- phic form, they are distinguished by their function;65 the upper aspect receives the efflux, and the lower one transfers it to the world below. As seen in the texts presented here, Metatron is identified in some passages with the cherub and the last sefirah, and in other passages he is distin- guished from one or even both of them. The identification of the lower aspect of the tenth grade of the divine (here, supernal Israel) with Metatron is elucidated in the second text that R. Shem Tov incorporated into his collection of material. There he says, "One intends his prayer to the cherub which is blessed from above, from the cause of causes; and from the cherub the efflux descends to the 'youth' [ng:] and from the 'youth' to Israel."66 In yet another formulation in R. Shem Tov's collection, the cherub, which functions as a sefirah, is called "the great Metatron [l:il 11C::n]67 and he is called the con- gregation of Israel and from there efflux descends to Israel."68 It can be assumed that the "lesser Metatron" implied here is the lower and angelic aspect of the tenth sefirah.69 More explicit usage of the dual role of the name Metatron to desig- nate an angelic figure and a sefirah can be found in various formula- tions in the works of kabbalists in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; some were influenced by these very sources, and some arrived at this idea independently. The most common formulation involves the ortho- 6sIn a different work that holds to the sanctified cherub doctrine, the distinctions be- tween these symbols are almost blurred: "Behold, for he who understands, the visible power is also called angel, and that the Shekhina [is called] the cherub" (Moscow-Gunzberg MS 1403, fol. lOb). Compare to the view of the author of Sefer ha-Navon (Joseph Dan, "Sefer ha-Navon by a Member of the German Pietists," Qove?: al Yad 6 [1966] 209-10 [Hebrew]) where the shekhina is equated with the physical form that appears to humans, the angel, the divine glory, and the divine name. 66Moscow MS, fol. 184a-b and Zurich MS, fol. 20b preserve better readings than New York MS (Microfilm, JTSA) 2430, fol. 66a (see Dan, "Prayer Intentions," 50).

Avraham b. David.

As an angelic figure, Metatron is described as ascending into the realm of the sefirot. As a sefirah, he is described as the last grade of the divine, the extra letter symbolizing the efflux he emanates to the lower world.70 Finally, we can identify yet another formulation of the doctrine of the sanctified cherub where Metatron is identified neither with the cherub nor with the tenth sefirah. In one section of R. Moshe b. Ele'azar ha- Darshan's Commentary to Sefer ha-Qomah, the cherub and Metatron are each "joined" (nDnn:) to the ten sefirot and included in the emanative system that unites the theosophic powers. In a revealing passage, R. Moshe described the three elements of the godhead: One should know the tripartate division [of the divine] and they are: the ten sefirot, the Cherub and the Prince of the Countenance. And the Holy One blessed be He is called the Cause of Causes, of which we cannot predicate anything of existence or non-existence, no measure and no body, no length, no width, no end and no bound- ary. . . and from it is emanated [each of the] three powers and all three are joined [:8C:rnn] to it and receive emanation from it. And [they in turn] emanate [themselves]. [And these are] the ten setirot which are [emanated] from itself, [i.e. ] the Cause of Causes, and [then] the Cherub from the ten sefirot, and the Prince of the Coun- tenance from the Cherub. And the Holy One blessed be He is the Cause of Causes above them all. And because He has emanated the ten sefirot from Himself, one should unite them all in one's prayer. . . lest he "cut the shoots.''7l Although not demonstrable, one can assume a linear development of these writings, according to the developing complexity of their symbol- ism, proceeding from angelic figures alone to a sefirotic doctrine lack- ing any focus on angels. According to such an outline, R. Moshe would be placed at an intermediate stage in the development of the sanctified 70See Abrams, "The Shekhina Prays Before God," n. 38; and Goldreich, Me'irat Einayim, 79, 112, 114-15.

That is, the numerical equivalent of Metatron is Shaddai ['Es = 314]. And when the shekhina emanates to the created angel then it is called Metatron." Although the manuscript witness does not record the difference in Metatron's name, it can be assumed that the latter Metatron should be transcribed with a yod.

It is important to note the anonymous comment added to this passage in Paris MS BN 799, fol. 3a (Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, 213 n.7) which objects to Metatron's equal status to the sefirot while not being identified as one: "ten sefirot, but not the prince of the countenance."</page><page sequence="21">DANIEL ABRAMS 311 cherub doctrine, after the Pesaq ha Yir'ah and prior to the material collected by R. Shem Tov. Unlike the Pesaq ha Yir'ah, R. Moshe ac- knowledged the existence of ten sefirot. However, R. Moshe's theology does integrate the angelic elements of Metatron and the cherub into a single conception of ten sefirot. It seems, therefore, that a theology of the cherub existed independent of the doctrine of the sefirot or other Ashkenazi traditions concerning Metatron and was gradually incorpo- rated into their thought. The various theosophical systems concerning the cherub, Metatron, and the ten sefirot provide a unique test-case for evaluating the standing of Metatron in the divine world in early medi- eval Jewish mysticism. g Prayer and the Divine Hypostasy in Kabbalistic Sources With the crystallization of sefirotic symbolism in Spanish kabbalah during the second half of the thirteenth century, Metatron's nature be- came more defined. For most kabbalists not influenced by Ashkenazi sources, Metatron was either included completely in the divine ontology (identified with the lowest sefirah), or relegated to the angelic world, where he was ontologically equivalent to the other celestial beings.72 This is true also for cherub symbolism, for which the kabbalists tapped into rabbinic traditions concerning the two cherubim in the tabernacle and identified them either with the sefirot of hesed and gevurah, or Tif'eret and malkhut.73 72See Odeberg, 3 Enoch, 111-24; and Mopsik, Le Livre hebreu d 'He'noch, 49-57. In a passage from a commentary to the prayers (London MS, British Library 751, fol. Sa) pub- lished by George Margoliouth ("The Doctrine of the Ether in the Kabbalah," JQR 20 [1908] 834), Metatron is termed the primal ether (ll::p;l mls), which apparently lies at the beginning of the emanative system. See Moshe Idel, "Abraham Abulafia's Works and Doctrine" (Ph.D. diss., Hebrew University, 1976) 77 [Hebrew]; and R. David Ibn Zimra, Sefer Qigur Sefer PliJah (Jerusalem MS, Mussayef 68, fol. 3b) where Metatron is termed both ll85 mn: and ;1n:, the beginning and the end of the sefirotic theosophy respectively. Finally, Charles Mopsik (Les grandes textes de la Cabale [Lagresse: Verdier, 1993] 392- 93) notes a tradition where the shekhina and Metatron are two angels separate from the tenth sefirah. 73This basic difference in symbolism appears already in the works of Ezra of Gerona and Nahmanides, as noted by Tishby in R. Azri'el ben Menahem, Commentary to the Aggadot (ed. Isaiah Tishby; Jerusalem: Mikize Nirdamim, 1945) 17,71 [Hebrew]; see also Moshe Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988) 132- 34; Marc Saperstein, Decoding the Rabbis (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1980) 84. See further the later kabbalistic commentary to the ten sefirot (London MS, British Library 1074, fol. 247a) which includes Nahmanides' identification of the two cherubim, and further identifies ;1n:, the tenth sefirah, with the second cherub, na'ar (youth) and Metatron. In Sefer Toldot Adam (Paris MS, BN 841, fol. 202), the two cheru- bim are identified alternatively with the ninth and tenth sefirot. Finally, see Yosef of Hamadan's symbolism concerning Metatron and shekhina as discussed by Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, 230.</page><page sequence="22">312 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW The kabbalah of Nahmanides contains the best example of the trans- formation of symbolism from a hypostasized angel or created glory to the doctrine of the sefirot. In his Commentary to the Torah (on Gen 46:1) he says: And God forbid that what is called Shekhina or the Created Glory is outside of the divine Name, may He be blessed as the Rabbi [Maimonides] believed. . . and if one claims that it is the Created Glory according to the Rabbi's view74 of the verse [Exod 40:34] "And the Glory of God filled the tabernacle," then how can bless- ings be offered to it? And he who blesses and prays to the Created Glory is as an idolater [because] the many statements of the Sages have dictated that the Shekhina is God, may He be blessed.75 As Nahmanides himself states, his kabbalah is not explicated fully in his works. Rather, hints and veiled references are scattered throughout his works, designed to impress the reader with the existence of an esoteric doctrine. Pines attempted to explain this text further through a parallel to a source from antiquity. Other scholars have looked to the supercommen- taries on Nahmanides' work composed by members of his school.76 This passage, however, particularly Nahmanides' conception of Metatron, is best understood from a comment made by a student of Nahmanides who cites the doctrine of his teacher:77 74Maimonides Guide of the Perplexed 1.63. 75Translated from the better text found in New York MS (Microfilm, JTSA) 1686, fol. 24b. 76Moshe Idel, "We Have No Kabbalistic Tradition on This," in Isadore Twersky, ed., Rabbi Moses Nahmanides (Ramban): Explorations in His Religious and Literary Virtuos- ity (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1983) 11-34; Elliot Wolfson, "By Way of Truth: Aspects of Nahmanides' Kabbalistic Hermeneutic," AJS Review 14 (1989) 103-78. 77In R. Shem Tov Ibn Ga'on's supercommentary to Nahmanides' Commentary to the Torah, entitled Keter Shem Tov, Metatron is identified with the lowest sefirah because of its designation as "prince of the world," that is, the lowest grade that has contact with the world: "And the shekhina is prince of the world and because of this he is called the great prince, as the sages have said his name actually [C::] is like his as is found in the aggada: 'The holy one blessed be he said: I took Enoch' until 'I have raised his throne [to be] like mine' [8R::: lss:] and I have called him Lord ['88]" (Parma MS 2425, fol. 67b; printed in Sefer Ma'or Va-Shemesh [ed. Avraham Koriat, Livorno: Eli'ezer Ottolenghi, 1798] 26a). R. Yiz. haq of Acco (Ogar Hayim, Moscow-Gunzberg MS 775, fol. 80a) identifies Metatron with the sefirah Tif'eret. See the related traditions in Goldreich, Me'irat Einayim, 116. The author of the anonymous supercommentary to Nahmanides' work also identifies Metatron with Tif'eret (Escorial MS G.I. 15, fol. 150a). In an apparent reworking of the cherub doctrine by kabbalists outside known circles, the sanctified cherub is identified with Tif'eret (London MS, British Library 752, fol. 39a). This manuscript was first cited by Scholem, Major Trends, 374 n. 85; conversely, see the reworking of a kabbalistic tradition accord- ing to the doctrine of the special cherub, where the cherub receives efflux from TifDeret (Kaufman MS 399, fol. 89a; published in Avraham Ben Azriel, Arugat ha-Bosem [ed. Efraim Urbach; 4 vols.; Jerusalem: Mekize Nirdamim, 1963] 104 n. 96).</page><page sequence="23">DANIEL ABRAMS 313 I have received [S:5nlp:] from the mouth of the Rabbi [Nahmanides] that Metatron is a messenger, and is not a separate thing [nnl: mm:] as his name indicates. Every messenger is called metator [n1DD'D] according to the Greek. And it is logical that those things that are sent [:8m;7wn] receive efflux from the Cause [of Causes] in order to accomplish their task.78 According to this passage, there is nothing unique in the etymology of "Metatron"; the implications of his name are attributed to all divine messengers. The pivotal phrase in the passage is nn1n: m:: ("separate thing"), which either denies the existence of an angel named Metatron, or qualifies its nature. According to the former reading, "messenger" applies to all angelic manifestations, which vary according to their mission. In view of Nahmanides' tradition (from his Commentary to the Torah), however, I understand the passage as Nahmanides' confirmation that Metatron is the lowest sefirah and therefore the grade that relates to the world. That is, as the lowest grade that "receives efflux," he carries out the divine will in the world. The tradition is therefore a statement about the status of Metatron in the divine world. By claiming that Metatron "is not a separate being," Nahmanides denied Metatron's angelic status and defined him as an inherent part of the continuous and unified being of the divine.79 In these texts, as in the texts discussed above, the issue of the nature of divine beings comes to the fore in the context of prayer. The connec- tion between the efflux and the intention of prayer is made more ex- plicit in further material recorded by Nahmanides' students. In various works, his students explain how the intention of prayer connects the sefirot one to another, as does the downward movement of the efflux. As recorded in Nahmanides' name, specific occasions require the initial intention to be directed to a certain sefirah.80 The danger, of course, is that one will terminate one's intention with that sefirah. The prescribed intention of prayer as articulated by Nahmanides' students reflects both 78This passage is the correct reading of the tradition recorded in various manuscripts of the secrets of Nahmanides' kabbalah by members of his school. For the various readings and manuscript witnesses, see Abrams, "New Manuscripts to the Book of Secrets." 79For this interpretation see Al-Nakawa, Sha'ar Kavod ha-Shem, 97a, and the conclud- ing sentences of the "Commentary to the Ten Sefirot" attributed to Rabbi Ya'aqov ha- Kohen (published by Gershom Scholem, Mada'ei ha-Yahudut 2 [1926] 230) where it is said in the name of Nahmanides that the angel of the Lord is the tenth sefirah. Compare to the description of Nahmanides' doctrine in Wolfson, "By Way of Truth," 138; see also Wolfson, "Metatron and ShiJur Qomah"; and Moshe Idel, "On the Concept of Zimzum in Kabbalah and its Research," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 10 (1992) 65-68 [He- brew] . 80Goldreich, MeJirat Einayim, 84, 89.</page><page sequence="24">314 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW the language of the passage cited in their teacher's name and the place of the last sefirah in relation to the godhead. One should not err in intending his prayer as [others] have com- mented. Rather, one should intend such that the Cause of Causes will emanate its blessing to Israel through the particular sefirah, and that efflux will descend from grade [nn8n] to grade until it [finally] rests [below]. And anyone who intends his prayer to a single grade alone "cuts the shoots.''81 Assuming that the attributions of both traditions are accurate, the isola- tion of the lowest sefirah in prayer, or "cutting the shoots," is equiva- lent in Nahmanides' system to designating angelic status to Metatron. The work found in the manuscript entitled "The Order of Metatron" is attributed to Nahmanides' contemporary, R. Ezra of Gerona. In this text, Metatron "serves before the entrance to the palace. . . he is the gate keeper of the king who opens and locks [the gate for prayer]. And he is worthy to pass judgment. . . and [he is] the way [through which] you should direct your heart during prayer."82 Metatron is also identified with the divine concubine (ts:be), the lowest grade of the corresponding left or evil emanation. As the concubine, Metatron personifies the at- tribute of judgment, functioning as the lowest sefirah.83 By contrast, in a text from Gerona that Scholem published,84 Metatron is both the low- est sefirah85 and Enoch, who was transformed into an angel. The anony- mous author criticizes those who argue that because one cannot direct prayer to the "cause of causes," which is too exalted for humanity's intention, one should pray to Metatron, who presides over worldly matters. 8lThis comment is copied in the margin of sodot to the prayers recorded in the name of Nahmanides (New York MS [Microfilm, JTSA] 2430, fol. 68a). 82New York MS (Microfilm, JTSA) 1884, fol. 18a.

The Zohar had gained central importance and the works of the German Pietists receded far into the background. While some prayers directed toward angels still existed at this time,86 Metatron became an appellation, a specific sefirah, or another member of the divine retinue.87 For example, in a kabbalistic tradition from the four- teenth century, "Metatron and Sandalfon are below the Atarah [the tenth sefirah] and they are the created glory, which is the two cherubim that Ezekiel saw."88 In the sixteenth century, R. Yosef b. Shlomo Al-Ashqar composed his work, Tsafnat Pa'aneakh, permitting prayer, or more specifically pros- tration before angels, while prohibiting the same form of worship to- ward a sefirah. And if you claim that angels are called "other gods" [Exod 20:3] and prostration before them is forbidden, as it says [Exod 20:5] iiDo not bow down before them and do not serve them," then how is it that Joshua bowed before an angel, as it says [Josh 5:14] "And Joshua threw himself face down to the ground, prostrating himself." And so with Abraham, as its says [Gen 18:2]: "And as soon as he saw them, he ran from the entrance to the tent to greet them, and bowed to the ground." One could excuse this and say that Abraham and Joshua did not bow [before angels], but before the Lord, may He be blessed. As it says of Abraham [Gen 18:3], "And he said: Lord, if it please you, do not go on pass your servant." And it is holy as is mentioned in [the Midrash] Genesis Rabbah:89 "And he turned his face toward the Shekhina and bowed." And so also with Joshua who bowed before the Shekhina.... And one should con- clude that there is a prohibition of prostration before angels only when they have not assumed a physical form. But when they have assumed the form of man, then it is permissible to bow to them. The reason being. . .

That is, [it is forbidden] in so far as God does not partake in any of these [physical forms].90 Al-Ashqar's view touches upon many of the central issues concerning the status of divine hypostases and angelic beings. Unlike the mystical texts of the thirteenth century discussed above, Al-Ashqar is not con- cerned with the angelic aspect of a sefirah, nor is the object of the intention of prayer a central issue. Material forms, including angels, have no divine ontology for him, and therefore one may bow before them. According to Al-Ashqar, one must be careful in praying to an angel when it has not materialized on earth, for only then could one confuse it with the divine itself. This brings us full circle to Elisha's viewing of Metatron. In the heavenly setting of the pardes, where God and Metatron are enthroned, confusion could occur. This is true accord- ing to mystical texts that describe either the inclusion of an angel in the godhead or the exclusion of the logos from it. This also applies to the Ashkenazi and early kabbalistic sources discussed above: if the divine sefirah can have angelic attributes or form, it may become confused with the angels that lie outside the boundaries of the divine being. Metatron and Jesus Hans Bietenhard discussed at length the differences between Jesus and Metatron in early Jewish and Christian texts.91 In a brief discussion, Almo Murtonen listed the strong parallels between the main functions of Metatron and Jesus.92 On the basis of these parallels, Murtonen con- cludes that Metatron is a counterpart to Jesus, stemming from a "coher- ent prototype" possibly reflected in the gnostic figure "little Jao." More recently, Gedaliahu Stroumsa has shown strong connections between early traditions concerning divine forms in Jewish, Christian, and Gnostic texts, suggesting that there "existed a cluster of mythologoumena about the archangelic hypostasis of God."93 At issue here is the reliance of Jew- 90R.

As Liebes shows through a separate example, these associations and literary traditions stem from Jewish- Christian circles and found their way into canonical Jewish texts.97 While the identification of Metatron with Jesus can be found already in fourteenth-century polemical works against Jews and in the works of seventeenth-century Christian kabbalists, a matter that requires further study,98 it is not until the beginning of the eighteenth century that fig- in Ancient Jewish Thought," in Jacob Neusner, et al., eds., From Ancient Israel to Modern Judaism: Intellect in Quest of Understanding (BJS 159, 173-75; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1989) 261-70.

The first work was composed by Moshe Kahana of Krakow, who converted to Christianity and assumed the name Johannan Kemper. His lengthy work on kabbalistic issues relies heavily on quotations from the Zohar and was composed in Hebrew in Uppsala between 1710 and 1713. This work includes a chapter focusing on Metatron's identification with Jesus. "Jesus. . . is called Metatron and became the servant-messenger [ntw nM] who was sent to atone for the sins and to suffer for them."99 The author incorporated many themes associated with Metatron in Jew- ish literature; he is the created angellยฐยฐ who took form [:wznil]lยฐl on the earth and is called shekhina.l02 Finally, in a christological recasting of a theme cited earlier from heterodox Jewish texts, the author writes: "we must bow before him and kneel before the Lord (YHWH).''I03 The second text concerning Metatron is included in a lengthy book entitled Gloria Christi by Caspar Calvor (Caluerius), issued with an added Hebrew title page captioned Kavod Yeshu'a Mashiah (lwS n12: nwe).

If the specific source of these traditions does not stem from far more ancient sources, as outlined for example by Stroumsa ("Form[s] of God," 269-88, esp. 279) and Fossum (The Name of God and the Angel of the Lord, 313 n. 139) one must ask whether this identification is a product of the exegesis of Jewish kabbalists who apostasized, therefore reinterpreting their kabbalistic world view according to new doctrines, or the product of Christians who saw parallels to their own models of the divine ontology in Jewish symbolism. While examples of both could exist side by side, the former might prove that the Christian kabbalists were influ- enced by the works of early converts to Christianity.

The section relevant to our discussion is a series of questions and answers on Metatron, shekhina, and Memra. In 1923, Hugo Odeberg published these passages in a German rendition, supplemented with a brief introduction and notes.l04 While Odeberg was convinced that the text was written by a convert to Christianity who was born Jewish and received an education in rabbinic and kabbalistic literature, Scholem later showed that the text was written in Halle in the Institutum Judaicum with missionary purposes in mind.105 After discussing the terms Metatron, shekhina, and Memra according to talmudic, medieval (namely, Rashi and Maimonides), and kabbalistic sources, the author asks his conclud- ing question: Should the messiah be [identified] with Metatron, shekhina, and Memra? Answer: When the issue gets its be'ur or explanation in light of the New Testament, then the Christians will say that behind these Jew- ish ideas is nothing other than the messiah, Jesus. But while we have not come so far that the Jew would accept the New Testament as the word of God, we cannot hold this to be true [from their perspective]. For now, it is enough that the Jews themselves accept that together with the everlasting God is a high being above all the angels, through which God rules the world.l06 Unlike many Christian kabbalists, the author avoided a reference to the ten sefirot in his discussion. Instead, he reduced the symbolism of each corpus of literature to a common element of a mediating divine being. Avoiding the method of many medieval polemics, the author did not argue that the Jewish texts contain the Christian belief; 107 he argued instead that to arrive at the Christian belief one must transform the earlier symbolism through that of another theological system. l04Hugo Odeberg, "Fragen von Metatron Schekina und Memra," Bulletin de la Societe Royale des Lettres de Lund (1941-42 [2]) 31-46.

The work from Halle stands in con- trast to the numerous works written by Christian Hebraists of the same period who debate the trinitarian or unitarian nature of Christian belief. See for example, Peter (Pierre) Allix, The Judgment of the Ancient Jewish Church, Against the Unitarians in the Controversy upon the Holy Trinity (London: n.p., 1699).

In at least one strong example, Jews were cognizant of the problems arising from using kabbalistic material in their own polemics. In a work written in Hebrew entitled, "Response to the Heretics [minim]," the Jewish author is concerned with the an- thropomorphic manifestation of the shekhina: "Be careful not to say to him [the Christian] that the shekhina has a body, for he will say that if so, man too has a body and you will be caught [on this point] and will fail.''l08 This comment is interesting, for he does not argue that a state- ment about the body of the shekhina will be too difficult to explain, but rather that it suggests a parallel to Jesus' human form. The anonymous author acknowledges this problem and warns his Hebrew reader not to speculate on this matter, which can be found in known and accepted Jewish sources. He then confides to the reader a kabbalistic doctrine of the shekhina: But if you think in your thoughts that it is written in the Sefer Ha- Qomahlยฐ9 that the Shekhina has a bodyS [then I say that] we are not permitted to think of this and also not to mention it to a non-Jew. Rather, [say to them] as I have written. And he who says to them that the Shekhina [indeed] does have a body, foolish Christians will laugh at him and say that the Jews have no [true] wisdom [of their own], that they are really hereticsS because they contradict them- selves.llo [They will say this because] the non-Jews have not the sufficient intellect to delve fully into the spirituality [rHhaniHth] of this, for they have no part in the intellect, the Shekhina and the sefirot as I have shown above from [the explanation of] biblical verses. Therefore, say as I have written above, but know that the Shekhina is [the] Name and the holiest of the angels. And She is created and is separate [nivdal] from [God], may He be blessed; but if He wills, He unites with Her entirely or partially. But to the Cause of Causes, It intermittently makes contact.... But of all this, do not mention a word to the non-Jews, for they do not under- |080Xford MS 2289, fol. 42b.

By insisting that it be concealed from the Christians and excluded from discourse, he foreshad- ows the eighteenth-century texts discussed above. In the context of Jew- ish anthropomorphism and Christian doctrine, the author shows that where the boundary between angel and God becomes blurred, it also becomes difficult to characterize the differences in religious symbolism.
