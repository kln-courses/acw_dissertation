<plain_text><page sequence="1">ion, he fails to convey much sense of the rapidity and anguish of the period's social and cultural changes. One sees little of the hustle and bustle of the capital of an emerging industrial (and military) power. His is a Tokyo of spacious elegant houses, women carefully attired in the seasonally proper ki- mono, quiet temples, and children leisurely playing traditional games. Class, commerce, industry, poli- tics and the like do not enter into his account in any serious way. He is at his best in describing concrete things (houses, streets, popular entertainments) but his accounts of social institutions and patterns of in- teractions (the family system and interpersonal ties within families, for example) are at a high level of normative generalization. Overall, Inouye presents a static and synthetic yet fragmentary picture of life, not as it was lived by any particular individual nor even by any specific class, but as an idealized por- trayal intended for the overseas reader of 1910. I do not mean to sound overly critical, for it would be unjust and cruel to lambast a long-dead author for not writing a book to satisfy an anthro- pologist several generations later; but contempo- rary readers should know what to expect. What In- ouye sets out to do, he does charmingly. In 22 chap- ters he catalogs and describes street life, houses, meals, styles of dress, servants, manners, marriage and the family, funerals, hobbies and amusements, and festivals. Inouye's prose is elegantly wrought in the style of the day, and makes for enjoyable read- ing. The book is profusely illustrated with dozens of traditional wood block prints, line drawings, and engravings of people at play, architectural details of homes, typical street scenes, and the like. The book lacks both an introduction that would put Inouye's material and approach into perspec- tive for the contemporary nonspecialist and an in- dex that could guide both the specialist and nonspecialist through the rambling text. The mod- ern publisher's failure to provide these is a disserv- ice to both the present-day reader and to the author. Inouye mentions in passing a proverb, inu mo arukeba b6 ni ataru-a dog, by walking, may chance upon a stick-an allusion to the serendipi- ties of wandering (p. 311). This work rewards just such meanderings. It will likely appeal to two very different audiences. Specialists on Japan who al- ready know the outlines of Meiji urban society may find in it fascinating bits of information on daily life (for example, the descriptions of the variety and uses of hand-held lanterns [pp. 133-135]). Casual readers will find it a pleasant account of bygone days. But anyone seeking systematic description and analysis of Japanese urban life at the turn of the century should look elsewhere. In Sorcery's Shadow: A Memoir of Apprentice- ship among the Songhay of Niger. PAUL STOLLER and CHERYL OLKES. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1987. xiii + 236 pp., maps, photographs, glossary. $19.95 (cloth). MICHAEL JACKSON Canberra, Australia As cool winds hold out the promise of rain for the parched Sahel, so Paul Stoller's memoir of his years among the Songhay gives one the sense that a fresh and fertile period is beginning for ethnographical literature. In Sorcery's Shadow is a far cry from the arid intellectualism of so much anthropological writing. It is an enthralling narrative of the author's apprenticeship to Songhay sorcerers and healers- dramatic, compelling, candid, and unforgettable. Though a memoir, written in the first person, the voices, views, and presence of the Songhay are powerfully communicated, so that the author's ex- periences blaze a trail for the reader into another reality-the cracked mud-plaster walls of Tillaberi, the stifling dust-laden air, the bowls of rice and pun- gent sauce, the charismatic figure of Adamu Jeni- tongo, the powdered roots, leaves, and tree bark used in sorcery, and the dreadful images of sorcery itself. But Paul Stoller does not lead us into this clan- destine, shadowy world in order to browbeat us with interpretive schemes or console us with talk of structure or system; rather, he leaves us free to de- cide for ourselves the significance of the halluci- natingly vivid experiences he undergoes. To better appreciate Paul Stoller's method and style, let us consider a telling anecdote that appears quite early in the book. Stoller has just begun field- work and is conducting a language-attitude survey in the Songhay town of Mehanna. After a month's hard work, a casual remark by an informant called Mahamane suggests to the ethnographer that a pre- vious informant, Abdou, had exaggerated the num- ber of languages he speaks. Stoller double-checks. Abdou readily admits that he speaks only two lan- guages, not four. Stoller asks him why he lied: Adbou shrugged his shoulders and smiled. 'What difference does it make?' He looked sky- ward for a moment. 'Tell me, Monsieur Paul, how many languages did Mahamane tell you that he spoke?' 'Mahamane told me that he speaks three lan- guages.' 'Hah! I know for a fact that Mahamane speaks only one language. He can speak Songhay and that is all.' 'What!' I stomped back to Mahamane's shop. 'Abdou tells me that you speak only one lan- gauge. But you just told me that you speak three langauges. What is the truth?' 'Ah, Monsieur Paul, Abdou is telling you the truth.' 'But how could you lie to me?' 'What difference does it make, Monsieur Paul?' Clearly, knowledge cannot be seen as neutral or disinterested, at least not for the Songhay. Knowl- edge is inextricably bound to human interests, con- texts, and actions. The intellectualist assumption that knowledge can be gathered without reference to context of use or the personality of the informant and the ethnographer is shown up as a sham. With- out a context in which knowledge can be placed, a goal against which its usefulness can be judged, the questions of the ethnographer are seen as pointless. Any answer will do. "What difference does it make?" As a result of this episode, Stoller dismissed the notion of impartial observation and decided for par- 390 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="2">ticipation-to sit with the Songhay and listen. "You must learn the meaning of the Songhay adage," he is told-"One kills something thin in appearance only to discover that inside it is fat." For Stoller, this shift from the arcane, otherworldly goals of aca- deme to the immediate, mundane, and practical field of Songhay existence meant, quite literally, ap- prenticing himself to Songhay teachers, accepting their worldview in their terms, and exploring the contexts in which knowledge was used, that is, had power. Stoller opted for an instrumentalist view of knowledge that judges its worth in terms of its re- lation to the practical and ethical problems of exis- tence. In Sorcery's Shadow can thus be read as a critique of epistemologies that claim that truth is a matter of correspondence to the essence of things or a matter of logical coherence. A critique is also implied of those styles of writing that mask the con- nections between what we come to know in the field and the quotidian context of our life there. The transparency and integrity of Paul Stoller's ethnog- raphy disclose the connections both between Son- ghay magical knowledge and Songhay social life and between his own knowledge and the social cir- cumstances of his fieldwork. This is a considerable achievement. In Sorcery's Shadow is more than a memoir; it is a remarkable and thought-provoking account of sorcery beliefs and practices. In the first place, Son- ghay sorcery reveals a universal human dilemma. As Stoller observes toward the end of his book, If I have discovered anything from my experience of Songhay sorcery, it is that sorcery is a meta- phor for the chaos that constitutes social rela- tions-Songhay or otherwise. We all suffer zamba, a good friend's betrayal. Things crumble and are reconstituted in all societies; we are all in sorcery's shadow. As I see it, the common ground between the Son- ghay and ourselves is the problem of bringing the unseen into the realm of the seen-a problem as central to divination as it is to social science. Be- hind all human schemes, magical or scientific, lies an urge to grasp and control the world by decipher- ing its cryptic signatures. What is universal, then, is the irreducible tension in human life between the precarious and the stable. Our critical sense of the world as a place of risk, uncertain and uncannily unstable, is countermanded by conventions-both social and intellectual-which play down the alea- tory, contingent aspects of existence. But we have a choice here-either to take refuge in the consoling structures of tradition, custom, or science, or to keep alive the sense of perplexity, sustain the sense of contingency, through what Keats called "nega- tive capability." By deliberately bracketing out any schematic or definitive explanation of Songhay sor- cery, Paul Stoller's book testifies both to his per- sonal courage-remaining open to an alien world for as long as he did-and to his artistic integrity, allowing his readers to enter and make sense of this world for themselves. In the second place, Songhay sorcery belongs to a particular time and place, and is grounded in a worldview that many Westerners will find incredi- ble. Although people everywhere seek to preempt, subvert, or control the hidden and hazardous ele- ments of existence, the Songhay see these elements as almost invariably linked to human agency, not natural causes. This anthropomorphic view has as a corollary a notion that acts or events in the "objec- tive" world are inextricably connected to thoughts, desires, and intentions in the "subjective" world. Paul Stoller's apprenticeship was therefore more than a technical matter-acquiring a knowledge of magical medicines and incantations; it entailed em- bracing the view that "subjective" and "objective" states are refractions of a single reality and that thoughts and actions, knowledge and event, are equally aspects of the same empirical world. In this view (which is not really a view but a lived reality), the life of the mind is not etherealized or set over and above the world of the body and of the senses. Both mental and material domains, imagination and matter, are on a par; they are aspects or refrac- tions of a single, seamless continuum of being. For one to ask whether Paul Stoller and his Songhay teachers merely imagined they came under sorcery attack or really did succumb to malevolent spirits is to fail to come to terms with Songhay reality, to fall back upon Eurocentric antinomies-true/false, real/imaginary, thought/deed, knowledge/event, theory/practice, and so on-that give the impres- sion that our way of representing the world to our- selves is the way the world inherently is. Is there anything that we might learn from all this? Can we go along with Paul Stoller and enter seri- ously into the world of Songhay sorcery? I think we can profit by such an exercise, for the beliefs and practices of the people among whom we sojourn as anthropologists provide us with ways and means of developing a critique of our own beliefs and prac- tices-including those of our profession. Paul Stoll- er's book underlines the importance of immersing oneself in another culture rather than just observing it from a discreet distance, of recognizing that the experimental subject in anthropological science is the ethnographer himself or herself. In Sorcery's Shadow presages a radically empirical approach to anthropology, one that places thought, feeling, and activity on a par, which includes the seen and heard as well as the unseen and sensed, which encom- passes the field of crisis as well as convention, an- tistructure as well as structure, the biographical as well as the sociological, the domain of the lived body as well as the domain of words and ideas. Moreover, as this exemplary work so admirably shows, such a radical empiricism can only be a- chieved through radically new developments in ethnographical writing. Paul Stoller prefaces his forthcoming book on Songhay possession with a remark of Adamu Jeni- tongo's: "One doesn't study the spirits, one follows them." I hope that Paul Stoller isn't going to be the only ethnographer who takes this remark to heart. Discourse and the Social Life of Meaning. PHYLLIS PEASE CHOCK and JUNE R. WY- MAN, eds.
