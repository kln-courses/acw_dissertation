<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIOLOGY AS A SCIENCE CHRISTOPHER DAWSON Christopher Dawson is the au thor of Progress and Religion, The Making of Europe, and two recent volumes of Gifford lectures on religion and western culture. Sheed and Ward, pub lisher of all these books, is now issuing Medieval Essays, con taining considerable important and long out-of-print material. The present article, otherwise unavailable, appeared in a sym posium, Science for a New World, published in 1934 by Harpers (in England Eyre ir Spottiswoode), and edited by Sir J. Arthur Thomson and J. G. Crowther. SOCIOLOGY is the youngest of the sci ences, and there are still many who ques tion its right to be considered as a science at all. It is but a century since Auguste Comte announced the advent of the new science that was to be the keystone of the scientific edifice and the crown of man's intellectual achievement, and though the last hundred years have seen a great in crease of interest in social questions and an enormous production of sociological and semi-sociological literature, there is still little prospect of the realization of his ideal. In fact, there has been, in some re spects, a distinct retrogression from the position that had been reached in the mid dle of the last century. Sociology no long er possesses a clearly defined programme and method; it has become a vague term which covers a variety of separate subjects. Sociologists have abandoned the attempt to create a pure science of society and have directed themselves to the study of practical social questions. Sociology seems in danger of becoming a scrap-heap on which are thrown any items that cannot otherwise be disposed. Nor is this the only danger. Even the writers who do deal with genuinely sociological problems frequently do so in an entirely unscientific way. This is most unsatisfactory, not only from the point of view of the sociol ogist, but in relation to the scientific outlook in general. The problem of sociology is probably the most vital scientific issue of our time, for if we admit the impossibility of creating a scientific sociology we are confessing the failure of science to comprehend society and human culture. It is impossible to create a scientific civilization from outside by a development of the material resources and the external mechanism of society. There can be no scientific civilization without a science of society. You cannot plan the future of a society if you have no knowledge of the true nature of the society in question. Moreover, at the present day the plans of the economists are at the mercy of the policies of the politicians, and the politicians themselves are the instruments of a public opin ion which is swayed by obscure and non-rational forces. The statesman who fails to understand these forces is a failure, but his failure is often less dan gerous to society than the success of the "practical politician" who understands</page><page sequence="2">CHRISTOPHER DAWSON 125 how to use these forces for his personal advancement without understanding their social significance. The crisis of so-called scientific modern civilization is due to its combina tion of an elaborate technical and mechanical equipment with an almost com plete lack of social direction. The societies of the past possessed their own organs of social direction and their formal principles of order, which were not indeed scientific, but were based on social tradition. Modern society has abandoned this social traditionalism in the name of rational principles, but it has done little to create the foundation of scientific sociology that these prin ciples seem to demand. Instead of this our social order is still based on the political and moral dogmas of the philosophers of the eighteenth century. The doctrines of modern democracy are not a scientific theory, but a moral and semi-religious creed which owes more than we generally realize to the personal inspiration of Rousseau and is hardly separable from the mystical Deism with which it was originally associated. This doctrine is, in reality, much further from scientific sociology than was the old Aristotelian political philosophy, which was, within its limits, firmly grounded on a basis of observed facts and a ra tional theory of social life and development. Moreover, the new movements that have arisen in opposition to the dominant theories of liberal democracy are also deficient in a pure sociological foundation, and are derived either from the economic theories of the nineteenth century or from the political philoso phy of nationalism. Thus we are faced by the contrast of a highly specialized development of scientific technique in the external conduct of life with an almost complete absence of scientific direction in regard to the life of society itself. And yet there can be no question of the vast resources of social1 knowledge that have been accumulated during the last century and more. The modern development of history and anthropology, of economics and the comparative study of re ligion is hardly less remarkable than that of the physical sciences. A new world has been opened up to us in the past, and our resources for the understanding of human development and its social processes have been immeasurably in creased. There is not a priori reason for excluding all this new knowledge from the field of science. It is genuine scientific knowledge, as reliable and as sys tematic in its own sphere as that of the physical sciences. It is no mere collec tion of scattered facts and subjective opinions, but an organized department of knowledge, or rather a number of such departments. Why, then, need we despair of the science of society when the available resources of knowledge are so great and the need is so obvious? But the fact is that these conditions, that are at first sight so favorable, have actually been a hindrance rather than a help to the development of sociology. The most suc cessful sciences are those, like physics and mechanics, which found their method before they were involved in a mass of detailed observation and before there was any question of using them for practical or utilitarian purpose. The development of Sociology has followed the opposite course and has suffered accordingly. It started with an embarrassing wealth of material and a desire for premature practical results, but with no assured method. The be setting sin of the sociologist has been the attempt to play the part of a social reformer, whether, like Comte, he embarked on grandiose schemes for the re</page><page sequence="3">126 CROSS CURRENTS constitution of society or, with the modern sociologist, he plunges into the practical work of civic reform. The early sociologists were great systematizers with a gift for generalization that carried them far beyond the limits of sociology proper into the deep waters of ethics and metaphysics. They improvised a whole philosophy as a basis to their real work as sociologists, with the result that they came to think more of their philosophy than of sociology itself. Thus the efforts of the Encyclo paedists, the St. Simonians and the Positivists result in the creation of a theory of society which was at the same time a philosophy of history, a system of moral philosophy and a non-theological substitute for religion. Î¤ JlHIS identification of Sociology with philosophy tended to bring the whole subject into discredit and caused a considerable body of opinion in the later 19th century to despair of the scientific possibilities of sociology, and to look instead to the new science of anthropology as an alternative. It caused socio logists themselves to react against the speculative tendencies of the earlier so ciology, which they condemned as "armchair sociology," and to immerse them selves in detailed statistical and practical enquiries which alone seemed to offer a prospect of concrete results. But the new movement avoided rather than solved the real problem of scientific method, and it often involved a substitu tion of the study of social machinery for that of society itself. Nor did it even escape the old danger of abstract philosophical generalization. Modern English and American sociology remains to a great extent dependent on the old tradi tion of 18th-century moral philosophy. In America, especially, the ideal of the last generation even went so far on one occasion as to define sociology as "a moral philosophy conscious of its task." It is easy to understand how, under the existing circumstances, the sociologist was forced to look to an ethical ideal for guidance and help. But nothing could in fact be further from the ideal of scientific sociology and it led merely to the creation of a pragmatic system of social ethics that embodied all the impurities and confusions of thought that it is the purpose both of philosophy and science to eliminate. The continental schools of sociology, on the other hand, have been far more conscious of the need for a strict definition of scientific method and for the delimitation of the province of sociology from both that of philosophy and that of the other social sciences. Hitherto, however, they have not been alto gether successful, although they have accomplished much valuable work. Their efforts have been handicapped by the confusion that has characterized the deve lopment alike of modern philosophy and that of the social sciences. In the case of the latter there has been an overlapping, due in part to the riches of the available material, in part to uncertainty of method, and also in part to a non-scientific rivalry between the different sciences. This has been most serious in the case of the two new sciences of Sociology and Anthropology, which have been, from the beginning, competitors in the same field. They started out, like rival prospectors, to establish as large a claim as possible in the unoccupied territories of the new world of knowledge; and consequently they both developed far more territory than they had the means to develop. Both of them take as their motto "Nihil humani a me alienum puto."</page><page sequence="4">CHRISTOPHER DAWSON 127 The Sociologist claims all social phenomena as his province, and there are few human phenomena that are not social. The Anthropologist claims that his sci ence is the science of Man and of human development, and consequently in cludes everything from human paleontology to the comparative study of religions. It is obvious that if these claims are taken at their face value, neither sci ence leaves any room for the other, except in so far as the sociologist does admit the existence of physical anthropology as an independent discipline. We may almost say that both sciences deal with the same subject, and that they differ only in the manner of their approach. In practice, however, a certaih modus vivendi has been reached, although it is neither logical nor final. The Anthropologist deals with primitive man and his society and culture, the So ciologist with the more advanced cultures and with the phenomena of con temporary social life. The Anthropologist has had somewhat the better of the bargain, since his material lends itself more easily to objective scientific study, and consequently he has done as much in recent years for sociological studies as the sociologist himself. This is particularly the case in America, where an thropologists, such as Kroeber, Wisser, Lowie and Goldenwieser, have produced works which are admirable introductions to sociological study and are far su perior in scientific method to the average textbook of Sociology. This superiority is largely due to the fact that, in dealing with primitive cultures, the anthropologist is not embarrassed by the rival claims of the his torian and the archaeologist. The archaeologist and the anthropologist co-oper ate with one another in the study of primitive culture, and there is no attempt on the part of the one to dispense with the help of the other. The case of the sociologist is very different, through no fault of his own. It was hardly to be expected that the historian would welcome the co-operation of the socio logist, in the same way as the archaeologist and the pre-historian have welcomed that of the anthropologist. Th .HE ADVENT of Sociology found history already in possession of an estab lished position and enjoying a well-earned prestige. It was regarded, not as a science, but as literature; it was a branch of the humanities, and as such must be judged by artistic rather than scientific standards. This conception goes back in origin to the historiography of the ancient world from which our own his torical tradition is ultimately derived. To the Greeks history was a form of rhetoric and had nothing in common with science, which finds its true pattern in mathematics and geometry. Science is concerned with the universal; history with the particular. Science belongs to the world of absolute and eternal real ity; history to the world of time and change. Science is Truth; history is Opin ion. In this respect every Greek was a Platonist at heart and shared Plato's belief that the less a science has to do with facts which are inevitably subject to perturbation and change, the more perfect it is, and the more it immerses itself in the sensible world, the less right has it to be considered scientific. Now this ideal, stripped of its metaphysical connotations, has been passed down by the scholars and scientists of the Renaissance to modern times, and has had a profound influence on current conceptions of history. Right down to our own days scholars have continued to repeat that history is not science, because</page><page sequence="5">128 CROSS CURRENTS there can be no science of the particular, and history is concerned with the study of particular events. Consequently the historian is driven either to fall back on the old liter ary-rhetorical idea, which still possesses a distinguished champion in Profes sor Trevelyan at Cambridge,1 or to return to the ethical ideal and like Acton to attribute to history the office of a moral censor, or, finally, with Croce to identify history with philosophical intuition.2 But none of these alternatives is really satisfactory to the modern historian, and the prevailing tendency is to maintain the independence of history at all costs by treating history as an end in itself. The most distinguished representative of this tendency was the late Eduard Meyer.3 His attitude to history was, indeed, that of the scientist rather than the man of letters, and has nothing in common with the literary-rhetorical ideal. But on the other hand he maintains the absolute dissimilarity of history from the other social sciences, and bases its claim to independence precisely on the old argument of its particular and individual character. Sociology and anthro pology seek, no less than the sciences of nature, to submit human development to general laws and to order the multiplicity of social facts according to uni versal concepts. But in history there is no room for general laws or causal principles; its world is the world of chance and free human actions, and it cannot pass beyond this. That is why, he says, "the modern attempts to trans form the essence of history, and to set before it other and 'higher' tasks, leave the historian unmoved; history exists once for all, such as it is, and will always maintain itself in this form, and the business of the historian is with things as they are and not with abstract theories. Whether history is valued more or less is a matter of no concern to him." But in reality, as J. B. Bury has pointed out, it is impossible to dismiss the question of the significance of history as a matter of no importance. If history has no end except the collection of facts for their own sake, it becomes merely an intellectual pastime, like stamp collecting. If it is1 to receive the re spect that it has always claimed, it must mean something in terms of reason and have some relation to the social sciences. The fact is that this* opposition of history and science ignores the whole change that has passed over the world of knowledge since modern science and modern history made their appearance. Modern science does not aim, like that of the Greeks, at the contemplation of unchanging truth. It is essentially inductive and experimental, and surveys the whole world of nature as it lives and moves. It is not satisfied with the es tablishment of a few abstract laws; it seeks to know all the facts about the world and to control the forces of nature. Moreover, it has been profoundly affected by the development of modern biology and the influence of the con cept of evolution. The new sciences of living matter such as botany and zoology, and even non-biological sciences like astronomy and geology, are profoundly historical in spirit. They do not contemplate a static universe, but an evolving process in which the time factor is of primary importance. And, on the other hand, modern history is no longer satisfied with rhetorical narrative or moral criticism. It seeks to understand the past rather as an or ganic process than as a mosaic of isolated facts. It tends to pay less attention</page><page sequence="6">CHRISTOPHER DAWSON 'W than in the past to the superficial activity of politicians andl diplomatists and more to the action of the permanent social and economic forces that determine the life of peoples. Above all, it is coming to accept the new concept of Culture which has been brought into currency by the anthropologists. It recognizes that the state is not, as the nineteenth-century historians believed, the ultimate so cial unit and the final end of historical study. The cultural unity is both wider and deeper than that of the state. It is not an intellectual abstraction or a by-product of the political process. It is itself the fundamental social reality on which all the other social phenomena are dependent. History is, in fact, whether consciously or unconsciously, becoming the science of social development; not merely the science of the past, but the science of the whole human culture-process in so far as it can be studied by docu mentary evidence. Thus the old opposition between science and history is be ing done away and history is being brought into increasingly intimate relations with the other social sciences, and above all with sociology. History and sociology are, in fact, indispensable to one another. History without sociology is "liter ary" and unscientific, while sociology without history is apt to become mere abstract theorizing. Hitherto the greatest weakness of sociology has been its indifference to the facts of history. It has tended to manufacture a history of its own which will be the obedient servant of any theory it happens to pro pound. It is hardly possible to open a modern sociological treatise without coming across historical "facts" that are unknown to the historians and dog matic solutions of historical problems which the historians themselves approach with the utmost diffidence. This is the inevitable result of the mutual distrust between history and sociology and the attempt of each of them to assert its own independence and self-sufficiency. In reality sociology and history are two complementary parts of a single scienceâthe science oÂ£ social life. They differ, not in their subject matter, but in their method, one attempting a general systematic analysis of the social process, while the other gives a genetic description of the same pro cess in detail. In other words, sociology deals with the structure of society, and history with its evolution, so that they are related to one another in the same way as general biology is related to the study of organic evolution. Thus a sociological study of Greek culture wouldj concern itself primarily with the organic structure of Greek societyâwith the city state and its organ ization, the Greek family and its economic foundation, the functional differen tiation of Greek society, the place of Slavery in the social order, and so forth; but all these elements must be studied genetically and in relation to the gen eral development of Greek culture on the basis of the material provided by the historian; while the latter, on his side, requires the help of the social analysis of the sociologist in order to interpret the facts: that he discovers and to relate them to the organic whole of Greek culture, which is the final ob ject of his study. It is for the sociologist to define the form of a culture and for the historian to describe its content. .CTUALLY, however, the sociologists have accomplished very little in this direction. As we have seen, the discovery and the systematic analysis of the</page><page sequence="7">130 CROSS CURRENTS cultural unit have been due to the work of the anthropologists rather than of the sociologists. The latter have been apt to despise such comparatively modest tasks and have aimed at something much more ambitious. From the beginning Sociology has been haunted by the dream of explaining social phenomena by the mathematical and quantitative methods of the physical sciences and thus creating a science of society which will be completely mechanistic and deter minist. The path of sociology is strewn with the corpses of defunct systems of "social physics," "social energetics" and "social mechanics," and their failure does little to discourage fresh adventures. Such systems have little use for his tory or for social reality; they content themselves with generalizations that have no significance and with "laws" which are nothing but false analogies. Thus one writer maintains that social association is a variety of "the law of mole cular gravitation" (Carey), another that culture is nothing but an apparatus for the transformation of solar energy into human energy (Carver and Ost wald), while Winiarsky argued that social change proceeds according to the laws of thermodynamics. Such extravagances explain the distrust shown to wards sociology by the historians, for their experience of the complex reality of the social process makes them naturally hostile to the crude simplicity of pseudo-scientific generalizations. Yet, on the other hand, it is equally impossible to understand the life of man and society without the help of the natural sciences. In a thousand ways human life is conditioned and determined by material factors, and there is a legitimate materialism which consists in the definition and analysis of these relations. History by itself is not enough, for it is impossible to under stand a society or a culture in purely historical terms. Underlying the historical process and the higher activities of civilized life there are the primary rela tions of a society to its natural environment and its functional adaptation to economic ends. The sociologist has to study not only the inter-social relations of man with man, but also that primary relation of human life to its natural environment which is the root and beginning of all culture. Here sociology approaches the standpoint of the natural sciences and comes closer to the biol ogist than to the historian, for the study of a society in its mutual relation with its geographical environment and its economic activity has a real analogy with the biologist's study of an organism in relation to its environment and its function. The application of this "biological" method to the phenomena of society was the work of Frederick Leplay, who more than any other sociologist may be regarded as the discoveror of a scientific method of social study. In this respect he compares very favorably with his more famous contemporaries such as Marx, Spencer and Buckle. He succeeded in giving an economic interpre tation of society which avoids the one-sided determinism of the Marxian hypo thesis; he showed the influence of geographical factors in social life in a far more exact and scientific way than Buckle or Ratzel, and he provided a bio logical interpretation of society which had nothing in common with the semi scientific, semi-philosophical generalizations of writers such as Herbert Spencer. Leplay took as his unit the study of the family in its concrete geographical and economic circumstances and analyzed its social life and structure in terms of Place and Work. His great work, Les Ouvriers Europ6ens, which appeared in</page><page sequence="8">CHRISTOPHER DAWSON 131 1855, contains a detailed study of thirty-six typical workers' families chosen from every part of Europe from Eastern Russia to the North of England and from every stage of culture from the Tartar herdsmen of the Steppes to the artisans^ and factory workers of Western Europe.4 He studied these, not at second hand, through statistics and blue-books, but by the direct observation of their way of life and by a meticulous study of their family budgets, which he used as a basis for the quantitative analysis of the facts of family life. Leplay's method of social analysis affords an insight into just those fundamental social realities which so often escape the notice of the historian and the student of politics. But although Leplay's method provides a genuinely scientific means for the study of society, it is not an exhaustive one. It required to be completed by a similar study and analysis of the other social units besides the familyâ the rural community, the city with its region, and the people and the state, and finally by an historical analysis of the social development and the cul tural traditions of the society as a whole. Owing to his concentration on the family, Leplay and his school tended to overestimate the importance of the -economic and geographical factors and to neglect the contribution of history. Not that Leplay was in any sense a materialist. He avoided the pitfall of na turalistic determinism which has been the downfall of so many sociologists, and fully realized the autonomous character of the moral and religious ele ment in social life. But he conceived this in a static form, as an invariable which governs social life from outside without entering into it. Î UT a culture is not merely a community of work and a community of place; it is also, and above all, a community of thought, and it is seen and known best in its higher spiritual activities, to which alone the name of Cul ture was first applied. It is impossible to understand or explain society by its material factors alone without considering the religious, intellectual and artistic influences which determine the form of its inner cultural life. Even if we consider society in its simplest formâthe familyâwe still find these factors intervening in a decisive way. Not only do the religious. and moral beliefs of a society always affect the structure and life of the family, but in some cases, as in China and in classical antiquity, the family was itself a religious unit and its whole life was consecrated by religious rites and based on religious sanctions. It may be said that it is not the business of a sociologist to concern him self with religious beliefs or philosophical theories or literary and artistic tra ditions, since they lie outside his province and are incapable of scientific defi nition or quantitative analysis; yet, on the other hand, it seems absurd for him to study the physical environment of a society and to neglect the spiritual forces that condition its psychic life. The primary task of sociology is, no doubt, the study of the social structure, but this structure, on the one hand, rests on the material foundation of geographical environment and economic function, and, on the other, is itself the foundation of a spiritual superstruc ture which embodies the higher cultural values. If we isolate society from its ma terial body and its cultural soul, we have nothing left but an abstraction. To see</page><page sequence="9">132 CROSS CURRENTS the Greek city, for example, in its social reality we must view it at once as a product of the earth and as an embodiment of Hellenism, like Erectheus, the hero-king of Athens, who was the child of the Earth Goddess and the * foster-son of Pallas Athene. The intrusion of these qualitatively distinct categories or orders of being into the sociological field is a great stumbling-block in the social sciences. The natural scientist has a completely homogeneous material in the material phe nomena that he investigates; so also has the philosopher in the region of ideas; but the sociologist has to deal impartially with material and spiritual factors, with things and ideas, with moral and economic values, with all the multi farious experience of the two-sided nature of man. Sociologists have always been conscious of this problem, and the spectacle of the brilliant results attained by physical science in its uniform field of study has often tempted them to find a way out of their difficulties by an arbitrary or one-sided simplification of their data. There is something very attractive about a "simple" explanation of the social process which treats the relation of the different factors as one of simple causal dependence and regards one of them as absolute and the rest as secondary derivations from it. The most popular type of "simple" explanation is, of course, the mater ialist one, which attempts to deduce the whole social process from economic or geographical or racial factors, and relegates the cultural superstructure to a lower plane Of reality as a subjective reflection of material conditions. The classical example of this is the Marxian theory, which reduces both history and society to their economic elements and regards the spiritual element in culture as secondary and derivative. In the words of Marx, "the mode of pro duction in material life determines the character of the social, political and spiritual processes of life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their existence that determines their consciousness. . . with the change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed."5 Now the error of this method of interpretation does not consist in the view that the ideological aspects of culture have a material basis in the econ omic life of society, but in the assertion of an absolute causalÂ· dependence which denies the independent significance of the spiritual factor in society. On the one hand, the concept of culture is arbitrarily impoverished by being emptied of all the values that are not explicable in economic terms, and on the other the economic category is arbitrarily expanded in order to include a whole series of non-economic elements. This fallacy is not peculiar to the Marxists; we find it equally in the theories that profess to explain the whole development of culture on racial grounds and which use the Aryan race or the Nordic type as the deus ex ma china of the historical process. Such theories explain everything, but also they explain nothing; they are like the conjuror's hat, which is equally capable of producing a cabbage or a white rabbit, as the occasion demands. At the opposite pole of these materialistic simplifications is the idealist simplification which deduces the social process from the spiritual element in culture. To Hegel and his followers History is the progressive self-manifesta</page><page sequence="10">CHRISTOPHER DAWSON 133 tion of absolute Mind. Each culture or people is a successive proposition in the process of a cosmic dialectic, and the material aspects of culture are merely the embodiment of the immanent idea. Such theories are now almost entirely discredited; nevertheless, we must remember that they played an essential part in the development of their apparent oppositeâthe dialectical materialism of Marx. Moreover, although the historical panlogism of the Hegelians is looked on by sociologists today merely as an historical curiosity, its elder rival, the rationalist idealism of the Liberal Enlightenment, still preserves its prestige in spite of all the ridicule and argument that have been directed against it from the time of Burke and de Maistre to our own days. This Liberal ideal ism is marked by a belief in an absolute Law of Progress and an unlimited faith in the power of reason to transform society. Concepts such as Liberty, Science, Reason and Justice are conceived, not as abstract ideas, but as real forces which determine the movement of culture; and Social progress itself, instead of being regarded as a phenomenon that requires explanation, is treat ed as itself the efficient cause of social change. Beliefs of this kind are religious rather than sociological, as Pare to has shown in the incisive criticism of Trat tato di sociologia generale. Nevertheless, they still exercise a powerful influence on popular sociology, and they are not altogether absent from the theories of such distinguished modern writers as the late Professors L. T. Hobhouse and Lester Ward. \ ' Â· Î½ i * There remains yet a third type of explanation, which seems at first sight to offer a more satisfactory way of approach than either the materialistic Or the idealist theories, since it professes to explain social phenomena in purely social terms. Nevertheless, this "sociologist" suffers from precisely the same defect as the other "simple" theories. For if, on the one hand, we attempt to study social relations apart from their material foundations and their cultural value, as the "formal" school of sociologists represented by Simmel and Von Wiese wish to do, we empty sociology of its content and are left with a series of logical abstractions. If, on the other hand, we reduce both the material and spiritual element in culture to purely social sources, we are guilty of just the same unscientific simplification as the adherents of economic determinism or Hegelian panlogism. No doubt the exponents of this theory, Such Ã¤s Emile DÃ¼rkheim, give a much wider analysis of the spiritual element in culture than do the materialists, and, in particular, they do full justice to the importance of the social function of religion, but they do this only by hypostatizing society into an independent spiritual power: not only is the social the cause of the religious, but the two are identical, and the Divine is the social sublimated to an ideal plane. This is not a scientific explanation, but an amalgamation of religion and society by means of an illegitimate substitution of one category for another. . . ' - HE fact is that all "simple" explanations are unsatisfactory and irreconcil able with scientific sociology. It is impossible either to make society its own cause or to deduce social phenomena exclusively from material or spiritual ones. As Pareto has shown, the essential requirement of sociological method is to abandon the idea of a one-sided relation of causal dependence between the</page><page sequence="11">134 CROSS CURRENTS different factors and view the social process as the result of a complex series of interdependent factors. Material environment, social organization and spir itual culture all help to condition social phenomena, and we cannot explain the social process by one of them alone, and still less explain one of the three as the cause and origin of the other two. Although the sociologist must take account of the geographical, economic and intellectual or religious conditions of a social culture, he has no more right to lay down the law on philosophy or theology than on geography or economics. But though this is generally recognized in the case of the science of nature and even the other social sciences, sociology has been far less scrup ulous in dealing with the sphere of the higher spiritual values. It is often argued that these are a product of the social process, since there can be no spiritual culture apart from society, and therefore "spiritual sciences" (Geis teswissenschaften) can claim no scientific autonomy. This, however, is the result of a naive confusion of thought. All the spirit ual activities that appear in cultureâreligion, philosophy and scienceâpossess their own formal principle. They are not mere functions of society, but have their own ends, which in a real sense transcend the social category. The so ciologist, no doubt, is justified in studying a religious belief in its influence on society, but the theologian does not judge his belief or theory in terms of social value, but in terms of religious truth. So, too, with scientific ideas, DÃ¼rkheim has given a most ingenious ex planation of the way in which man's ideas of time and space have a subjec tive basis in the rhythm and order of social life. But the scientist himself aims at transcending all such social subjectivism and attaining some absolutely ob jective standard of measurement. In other words, the more "anthropomorphic" a scientific idea is, the more interesting it is to the sociologist, and the more worthless it is to the practitioner of the particular science in question. Actually, however, there is little dangerâat least, outside Russiaâof the So ciologist dictating to the naturalist or attempting to "sociologize" science as a whole. But there is, as we have seen, a real danger of the sociologist trespass ing on the territory of the other Geisteswissenchaften and attempting to play the part of a theologian or a philosopher. A sociologist is, of course, quite within his rights in arguing that religion is necessary to society, or the reverse, or that a particular religion is beneficial or harmful to a particular society. For example, he might conclude from the study of ancient civilization that the introduction of Christianity was fatal to the institutions of the city state and the tradition of Hellenic culture. But this would not justify him in drawing conclusions about paganism or Chris tianity qua religion. That is a matter for the theologian. When Professor Ellwood, in his well-known book The Reconstruction of Religion, argues that religion is necessary to society and performs important social functions, he is reasoning as a sociologist, but when he goes on to "re construct" religion and to propound a new form of socialized Christianity, he is exchanging the role of a sociologist for that of a theologian. It is no matter whether the religious theories that we propound are ma terialist or supernaturalist, rationalist or mystical, theistic or humanitarian. The point is that when we once begin to make a religion or to discuss purely</page><page sequence="12">CHRISTOPHER DAWSON 135 religious values, we enter the theological region and speak as theologians, not as sociologists. Ever since the time of Comte, there has been a constant succession of theological sociologies which aim, not at the study of actual societies or actual social phenomena, but at the reformation of society on the basis of a new re ligious ideal. These attempts have been almost uniformly unsuccessful, for they are vitiated by an inherent confusion of method. They try to produce a synthesis between religion and sociology, and they succeed only in creating a hybrid monstrosity that is equally obnoxious to scientific sociology and to genuine religious thought. I do not say that it is impossible for a sociologist-philosopher-king to plan the organization of society deliberately on the basis of general philosophical principles. Something of the kind was, indeed, accomplished by the Tokugawa Shoguns, who gave Japanese culture a conscious unity like that of a work of art. But they could appeal to the prestige of the Confucian traditionâthat is to say, to an inspired sociology that had a genuine religion and a divinized sage behind it. If Iyeyasu had manufactured a new religion of his own to meet a purely social need, it is very unlikely that he would have been as suc cessful as he was. The sociologist who creates a religion of his own for sociological purposes is just as unscientific as if he were to invent new anthropological or geographical facts to suit his theories. As sociologists we have to accept the existence of this independent order of spiritual truths and values and to study their influence on social action. Whether society requires a religious foundation; what is the actual working religion of our particular society; how far material and social factors affect religious beliefs and philosophical points of view; â all these are questions for our study. But the objective intellectual validity or spiritual value of religious doctrines and philosophical theories lies entirely outside our province. It does not, of course, follow that these questions are in themselves insol uble or otiose. There is no reason for the sociologist who observes the limits of his science to write off everything beyond it as unreal or as matters of ar bitrary speculation. No doubt the study of social phenomena in their complex irrationality has often led sociologists to prefer the despairing scepticism of a Machiavelli or a Pareto to the self-confident dogmatism of the idealists. Never theless, if such an attitude is justifiable it must be justified on philosophical grounds. The sociologist as such does not possess the necessary data for making a universal judgment of this kind. Here again he must follow the example of the historian, who no longer seeks to use history in order to justify his political or religious opinions, but who seeks to understand the beliefs of the past as a means to understanding its history. This method of sociological analysis can be applied to practically every social phenomenon, even to those which seem at first sight to be entirely non spiritual in character. For example, Max Weber, one of the first modern ex ponents of "a sociology that understands" (verstehende Soziologie), has shown how the development of Capitalism is not to be explained as a purely econ omic process, but has its spiritual roots in a new religious attitude towards industry and saving that grew up in Protestant Europe after the Reformation.</page><page sequence="13">136 CROSS CURRENTS On the other hand, there are other phenomena which seem at first sight to be purely religious and yet have their basis in economic or social causes. Thus every social type or institution is the result of the complex inter action of a number of factors that are qualitatively distinct and can never be reduced to simple unity. Take for example the social type of the Samurai in Japan, a type which seems sociologically simple enough, since it represents an obvious social function in Japanese society. Nevertheless, in order to under stand it, it is not enough to study the historical evolution of Japanese feudal ism and the economic structure of Japanese society. The Samurai type is also the embodiment of a whole complex of moral ideas and religious beliefs native, Confucian and Buddhistâsome of which have a very remote relation both to Japan and to the military tradition. And the ethical code; or cultural ideal that is the outcome of all this is not merely a matter of historical interest; it is an abiding element in the Japanese social tradition, and without it it is impossible fully to understand either Japanese politics or Japanese thought. But if Sociology needs the help of philosophy and theology in order to understand the spiritual elements in the social process, it also renders services to them in return. We cannot understand an idea unless we understand its his torical and social foundations. We cannot understand the Greek institution; of citizenship unless we study its spiritual foundations in the religion of the city and the family. But on the other hand we cannot understand the Greek philosophical ideal of political liberty and its ethical ideal of "magnanimity" without a knowledge of the political life and the social structure of the Greek state. And even our modern ideas of liberty and democracy are not unaffected. The philosophers of the 18th century interpreted the classical ideas of liberty, democracy, etc., in an abstract and unsociological way, and consequently they misinterpreted them, and this misinterpretation was not without its influence on their philosophical thought. In the same way the theologians have often failed to recognize the social and economic elements in religious phenomena, with the result that they have confused religious and sociological values and have allowed a racial or eco nomic opposition to translate itself into a religious conflict. Most of the great schisms and heresies in the history of the Christian church have their roots in social or national antipathies, and if this had been clearly recognized by the theologians the history of Christianity would have been a very different one. A scientific method of sociological analysis may serve the same purpose for society as a psychic analysis may accomplish for the individual by unveiling the cause of latent conflicts and repressions and by making society conscious of its real ends and motives of action. The actual tendency of practical politics, especially in democratic countries, is unfortunately just the opposite, since they invest such conflicts with a halo of idealism and thrive on sociological mis understandings. This is the more regrettable because the modern state is daily extending its control over a wider area of social life and is taking over functions that were i formerly regarded as the province of independent social units such as the family and the church, or as a sphere for the voluntary activities of private individuals. It is not merely the state that is becoming more centralized, but that society and culture are becoming politicized. In the old days the states</page><page sequence="14">CHRISTOPHER DAWSON 137 man was responsible for the preservation of internal order and the defense of the state against its enemies. Today he is called on to deal more and more with questions of a purely sociological character, and he may even be expected to transform the whole structure of society and refashion the cultural traditions of the people. The abolition of war, the destruction of poverty, the control of the birth-rate, the elimination of the unfitâthese are questions which the statesmen of the past would no more have dared to meddle with than the course of the seasons or the movements of the stars; yet they are all vital issues today, and some of them figure on the agenda of our political parties. It is obvious that the solution of these problems calls for all the resources of socio logical scienceâeven supposing that science was in a much more advanced state than it actually is; yet the unfortunate politician is expected to provide a solution by his common sense enlightened by a cloudy mixture of economic materialism and moral idealism. We can hardly wonder at the popularity of Marxian Socialism, for that at least has a sociology of a kind, though it is elementary and one-sided. A sociology which disregards its proper limits may create Utopias, but it cannot help the statesman in his practical tasks. What we need is a scientific sociology which will transform the art of politics in the same way that the modern sciences of biology and physiology have transformed the art of med icine. In the task of restoring spiritual order and social health to our distracted civilization sociology has, as Comte realized, an essential part to fulfill. But it is to be achieved, not by usurping the functions of philosophy and theology, as in the Positivist synthesis, nor by ignoring moral and spiritual values, as with Marx. It must recognize at once the determination of natural conditions, and the freedom of spiritual forces, and must show how the social process em braces both these factors in a vital union like that of the human organism. Such a sociology alone can prepare the way for the coming of a new applied science of politics which would plan the City of Man, not by the rule of ab stract ideas and visionary theories, nor in terms of material size and wealth, but as a true community.</page></plain_text>
