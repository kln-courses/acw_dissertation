<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Dual System' Aleksandr Itskhokin Moscow, USSR This article shows the development of occupational structure to be governed by the system's tendency toward a dual ideal correspond- ing to the two basic work attitudes: one entailing the worker's in- volvement in the requirements of his functions as such, and the other his involvement in the actual needs of a concrete object of service. Both science and a certain nonprofessional element of the services are inferred to contain a germ of the ideal-an "anti- Weberian" (but at the same time "non-Durkheimian") pattern of stable and efficient societal organization of work. Significantly, the pattern is a self-sustaining one. It rules out certain social forces, such as societal ideologies, which are foreign to the nature of a particular activity; this trait distinguishes it from the "classical" medieval pattern. It also rules out direct coercion of the worker. The dual paradigm of the social system propounded here for theo- retical ends may also provide a promising tool for analysis of various sociocultural phenomena. This paper attempts to construct a theory of the evolution of society as a system of the division of labor. This evolution is considered to be de- termined by the drive toward a certain ideal which, though developed here primarily in terms of the principle of integration, is an ideal of functioning or efficiency. It is conceived as satisfying also a broader spectrum of systemic imperatives, including that of adaptation. The subject matter will be treated in several stages. This introductory section develops the concept that the division of labor may be viewed either as a system of roles or as a system of services according to the type of integration proper to the worker. The second section, dealing with the two resultant patterns of social organization, shows the im- portance of Calvinistic Protestantism in the formation of the role system and stresses Japanese society as the purest example of the service sys- tem. The third section analyzes the part played by identification as a mechanism of integration along the service axis. The concluding section provides a model of the ideal division of labor. The discussion as a whole focuses on one aspect of integration, namely, 1 NOTE.-The editors of the AJS wish to express their appreciation to Diane Ignashev for considerable preliminary editing of this paper and for reducing its length in ac- cordance with the suggestions of a referee and of the author himself. ? 1980 by The University of Chicago. 0002-9602/80/8S06-0001$01.65 AJS Volume 85 Number 6 1317</page><page sequence="2">American Journal of Sociology the correspondence of personality dispositions to the requirements of higher systemic bodies. I operate predominantly with the notion of sociopersonal integration, ruling out the aspect of inner balance in per- sonality and the sociocultural system. That does not mean, however, that the problem of intralevel coherence within the system is not dealt with; a specific conception of this problem is, in fact, inherent in the very plan of presentation. The central logic of this paper lies in postulating two types of societal integration. In addition to role or cultural integration, conventionally ac- cepted in "academic" sociology as the only societally meaningful paradigm of sociopersonal integration, I introduce the concept of non-role integra- tion: integration of the actor (worker) with the actual needs of the object of his service (hereafter the service object). As processes, these two types of integration follow two orthogonal directions, or axes, rep- resenting alternate orientations of the worker: role orientation versus orientation to the consumer or client. For the integrated individual these orientations become inner dispositions. A worker integrated with his role strives to be good at it for the reward inherent in compliance with its objectives and norms. In other words, he internalizes the functional requisite of work. A worker integrated with the service object responds to any of the consumers' actual needs for the reward inherent in their gratification. When sociopersonal integration is lacking, these orientations are in- sured by external pressure. In the case of role orientation this pressure comes from agents of normative social control who, as opposed to the consumer, are not directly interested in the product. The viability of noncultural integration finds substantiation in the entire tradition of research on the primary emotional element of the cohesion of human (and animal, for that matter) collectivity. What is proposed here is, specifically, an extension of the "expressive" axis of social organization from a small-group scale to a societal scale. This extension operates on the premise that a model of "primary" integration applies to societal division of labor insofar as work implies regular contact between the worker and the service object. Obviously, orientation toward the other is relevant not only in the context of work proper. It is as universal a type of sociality as its role alternative. Moreover, as will be shown below, involvement with the service object develops not only through immediate contact with the recipient of services but also by means of specific socialization and, in general, "secondary" social control. In accordance with the basic postula- tions above, however, only egocentric role orientation is understood here as truly cultural. In other words, there are two general trends in social organization, one which builds the order by attuning an individual to 1318</page><page sequence="3">The Dual System the social object's actual needs, and another which directs an individual's interest to his role's requirements-its objectives and norms-per se, or to himself as evaluated according to these standards. The division-of- labor aspect of sociality is employed here for the construction of a sociological theory (quite traditionally, in fact) because work organiza- tion as a purely functional aspect of sociality epitomizes society's tendency toward organization and hence the very idea of a social system. In order to make this rather formal scheme more meaningful, a sketch of some characteristic manifestations of the Japanese social order will be presented as an example of one developed predominantly in con- formity with the "alter-centric" principle of organization. Needless to say, what follows is only a tentative and biased interpretation. It is reported that the Japanese teacher, while showing a pupil how to write, manipulates the pupil's hand physically (Benedict 1946, p. 269). Presumably, the child is not expected to be active in mastering skills which are not indispensable to personal relationships. Contrary to his Western counterpart, the Japanese child seems to be incapable of being captivated by the task and persevering in it with his tongue protruding, excited by every success or failure. He has never been praised or re- proached for successes and failures as such, abstracted from the other's perspective, lest a disposition toward self-appraisal and self-orientation in general be inculcated into his psyche and an individualistic mentality arise. Instead, praise and reproach tend to be worded in terms of the actual or supposed satisfaction or dissatisfaction of those others toward whom the action is either actually or supposedly directed. Only the other's reactions (actual or imagined) become meaningful for the individual and operative as reinforcements. To compensate for the child's resultant in- capacity for self-motivated learning of necessary skills, a specific tech- nique is developed to impart them-motor training reinforced by the immediate and continuous "live" signs of approval or disapproval con- veyed through bodily contact. In addition to this physical aspect, the learner's passivity is cultivated as a state favorable for a wide range of learning situations (Benedict 1946, pp. 268, 283). Zen cultivation of an individual's involvement with the object in itself (and the renowned Japanese aestheticism, if you will) may be understood in the same narrow vein as still higher forms of compensation for underdeveloped egocentric emotions "apropos of the object," the object of work in particular. Before resuming, I reiterate that the above sketch is too premature to be taken seriously and is justified only by the need to enliven the presentation of theory. Putting aside for the moment the question of integration mechanisms alternative to role learning, we can state that the actor's orientation to- 1319</page><page sequence="4">American Journal of Sociology ward others is the most natural extension of the idea of the division of labor. The institutionalization of human activities means the emergence of the other possibility of socially positive work orientation; "natural" service to someone requiring the service is complemented by "service to one's business" (calling, vocation, profession), that is, involvement in one's function-role as such.2 The latter, figurative variety of service and the natural one exhaust all imaginable versions of the actor's positive social orientation. An individual's dependability as a participant in social interaction, therefore, can be achieved through only two alternative means: through the internalization of a role as such (disregarding any actual consumer) or through involvement in a service object's actual needs. Corresponding- ly, Talcott Parsons's formula that social dynamics derive from the sys- tem's tendency to achieve stability-the so-called theorem of institu- tional integration3-is supplemented in this scheme by another dimen- sion, that of service proper. In place of "the system" as the unequivocal, analytical representation of the social whole, I suggest a pair of rep- resentations: the system of roles or the role system, and the system of services or the service system. Each of these is subject to general systemic imperatives, that of integration specifically. To be more precise, each imposes these imperatives on the social whole. But the prerequisites for the "domination" of one or the other system and the consequences of such domination contrast markedly. Correspondingly, the model to be constructed aims to present a clear picture of differentiation and polarization. While integration with the service object (or integration along the service axis, or service-system integration) places control over the worker in the client's hands, role integration places control in the hands of a particular social agency. A number of provisional "functionalistic" theses may be suggested concerning the conditions for actualization of one or the other type of integration. It is reasonable to suppose, for example, that role or normative control is preferable (functional) when the work involved presents a technical problem. Here society tends to vest control in a particular institution, presumably more proficient in the related field than any layman-client. Such a tendency toward "professionalization" culminates in the consumer's judgment of a worker's efficiency solely on the basis of the immediate utility of the product (service). In this case 2 Institutionalization begins with the evolution of a vocational designation (e.g., "hunt- ing"), i.e., the abstraction of the related meaning from the immediate activity. 3 ". . . the integration of a set of common value patterns with the internalized need- disposition structure of the constituent personalities is the core phenomenon of the dynamics of a social system. That the stability of any social system . . . is dependent upon a degree of such integration may be said to be the fundamental theorem of sociology" (Parsons 1951, p. 42). 1320</page><page sequence="5">The Dual System the consumer is unable to apply any standard of performance. Because he is therefore ineffective as an agent of social control, the system of services functions worse than the system of roles. There are, however, conditions which make an "ideal client" (i.e., a consumer who is an utter layman in regard to the worker's functions) a better controller than any institutional agency. Imagine, for instance, a hypothetical situation in which the main functional end of the work is the client's mood. In fact, if we deal with quite elementary work which does not lend itself to further "rationalization," work whose results can be evaluated in no other way than the unquantifiable satisfaction or dis- satisfaction of the client, and if the structure of operations is such that the worker is constantly in immediate contact with the client (and, hence, out of contact with any third party, institutional agents of control in- cluded), then the only relevant controller is the client. The related social situation then tends to be determined by the requirements (including that of integration) of the service system. Conversely, if the work is com- plicated and esoteric and the product is not meant for immediate use by a consumer, control tends to be transferred to a social institution especial- ly proficient in the function (role), in other words, to the profession. The related social structure and dynamics tend to be determined by the sys- tem's drive toward a role ideal. These two situations, both of which promote sociopersonal integration, presumably rule out intervention by forces alien to the given role or ob- ject of service. But the simplicity of a product, plus its meaninglessness for consumption (a meaninglessness in this case owing to the "partial" nature of the work), constitutes a management situation, implying inter- ference by a "third social force," the economy. Domination by the econ- omy presupposes maximum utilization of resources, labor in particular, and, hence, a maximum burden of work. This, along with the interruption of continuity in the individual's social milieu and rationalization of his world view, produces a specifically anti-integrational, alienating effect on the sociopersonal level. But in sacrificing sociopersonal integration to eco- nomic ends, society gains considerable functional compensation: (1) social segmentation caused by integration mechanisms characteristic of precapi- talistic forms of social organization is replaced by a societal scale of eco- nomic integration, and (2) equal, if not greater, benefits are derived in terms of adaptation. Efficiency is increased enormously. Any ideal pattern for the division of labor cannot ignore these "achievements of capitalism," since to do so would imply profanation both of efficiency as a value and of the very idea of a division of labor. In an effort to make this abstract, bidimensional scheme more vivid, I have strayed somewhat from the basic argument. The characteristics of an ideal division of labor will emerge finally as a result of application of an 1321</page><page sequence="6">American Journal of Sociology apparatus yet to be constructed. I proceed from the fundamental axiom that the "biaxial" logic of work orientation is applicable to any activity in a situation involving division of labor. Work can be viewed both as (1) performing one's function as such and as (2) satisfying the actual needs of a client. The former corresponds to the worker's involvement in the role version of the systemic representation of the division of labor, or, simply, in the role system. The latter corresponds to his involvement in the service system. These are not just two alternate analytical approaches to the worker's situation; the distinction implies a significant difference in related mentalities of the worker. By "service" I mean a work act wherein the worker has in mind the actual needs of a concrete service object, as opposed to any considerations of duty or achievement, consider- ations which characterize a "role" act. The only significant fact of the service system, its only objective and value, is an actual client's satisfac- tion. Cultural "mentifacts" (D. Bidney's terminology [1953, p. 33]) and social value in particular simply do not exist in this system. An occupa- tional category belongs to the "services" insofar as a service mentality- whether internalized or imposed by the consumer's external control-is typical of the worker. Sociopersonal integration of the services, or "human- ization," leads to the worker's concern for the needs of actual service objects for the reward inherent in their satisfaction. In the other type of occupational category, the "professions," the role mentality (whether in- ternalized or imposed by the agent of normative order) is typical of the worker.4 Sociopersonal integration of the professions, or "professionaliza- tion," results in a worker's noninstrumental pursuit of work's functional ends as such and/or in spontaneous adherence to its norms. The spread of a role or service-work mentality clearly correlates with a strengthening of the corresponding type of integration. It is reasonable, then, to describe role integration of the system of the division of labor as "professionaliza- tion." Integration of the services, or integration of the system of the di- vision of labor as a system of services, may be called "humanization." Which of the two integrational tendencies manifests itself in a particu- lar work situation depends on whether the conditions present activate the psychological integration mechanisms peculiar to professionalization or to humanization. One such mechanism, identification, is discussed at some length in the section headed "Secondary Integration along the Service Axis." 4 Hence, contrary to conventional use of these notions, "the professions" and "the ser- vices" are considered to be antipodal parts of the system of the division of labor. This and other seemingly rash departures from the established conceptual order will be substantiated in the course of this paper. At this point I can only justify my rashness with the radicalism of the attempted theoretical innovations and hope for the reader's tolerance, interest, and imagination. 1322</page><page sequence="7">The Dual System To summarize the foregoing introduction, I now outline the principal logical premises of my thesis: (1) The system of the division of labor may be viewed as either a role system or a service system. (2) An actor is in- volved in the role system insofar as he views his activity as oriented to- ward the impersonal functional requirements of his role objectives and rules; when involved in the service system the actor views his activity as oriented toward the actual demands of the consumer. (3) The integration of the actor (worker) into society as a role system means that he perceives his work as pursuit of its functional ends (abstracted from the consumer perspective), seeing those as his own ends, and/or voluntarily adheres to the rules; integration into society as a service system means that he per- ceives his work as an inherently rewarding service to others. (4) The social system's drive to a higher level of organization demonstrates a dualism which stems from the duality of the concept of an ideal worker. Presum- ably, each of the two systems has its own peculiar psychological mecha- nisms of integration, and each mechanism requires a particular set of situ- ational conditions of actualization. (5) Consequently, the development of each of the two types of work organization, or development along each of the two axes, materializes in specific features of the dynamics of voca- tional structure; society differentiates so as to profit from both lines of integration. TWO PATTERNS OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION Role mentality as a whole, complete with its narcissistic and self-discipli- nary aspects, presents the essence of individualism. But the correlation of self-assertion with individual responsibility forms a pure cultural pattern only insofar as that responsibility is to no one directly interested in the product, in other words, only insofar as the activity is devoid of orienta- tion toward an agent of social control. Significant others in the social con- trol of roles are those who function as impartial representatives of the social order: the normative reference group and audience. The Reformation (Calvinism, in particular) played an especially promi- nent part in consolidating the individualistic sociocultural trend. Not only did it sanction the emancipation of man from all sorts of personal bonds and from the central "ideological survival" of the service order in Chris- tianity-the moral imperative to love one's fellowman; but' also, by pro- moting the doctrine of predestination, it practically removed the moral dimension of culture from the context of service even to God. At the same time it destroyed such factors of service-system integration as immediate contact with the living representatives of God (priests) and simulated con- tact with symbolic but anthropomorphic objects such as saints. Likewise, 1323</page><page sequence="8">American Journal of Sociology it introduced rituals which enhance the emotional content of contact with the principal agents of societal control. Evidently, the resultant general atmosphere of alienation on the human plane was indispensable for a cool reign of economic rationalism, but it was no less crucial for a complete consolidation of the role pattern of so- cial organization, including sociopersonal integration. The central histor- ical achievement of the Reformation was neither cultural reinforcement of economic gain nor rationalization of economic behavior. Presupposing the manipulation of people, the economic form of integration cannot provide for utilization of the bulk of human potentialities, particularly the most valuable among them, the creative ones. In accordance with this Marxian thesis, the economic order can be nothing but a transitional one prior to the materialization of some advanced form of sociopersonal integration. Protestantism made two major contributions to this process: (1) it eman- cipated the actor from the service system, thus promoting the role ten- dency of development, and (2) it made the occupational sphere the main field of the role system's operation, thus focusing social control on an ob- ject which embodies the very idea of social organization. In other words, Protestantism promoted the societal consolidation of a specific sociocul- tural entity-work organization (or the division of labor system proper). Such organization embodies the idea of the social "organism" as something presupposing obligatory interaction of its parts, which in turn tends to monopolize the systemic principle of sociality. Characteristically, this ulti- mate representation of the sociocultural system also implies the idea of complementarity, or cooperation (contrary to mere coexistence), another vital element of the organic ideal. While building the cultural base of capitalism and undermining obsolete forms of social stability, the Reformation also played a major part in the consolidation of a "higher" form of sociopersonal integration, that of pro- fessionalism or work individualism. This is truly the acme of individualism, if only for the evolution of the capitalist, that acknowledged champion of economic individualism, who as a professional of management departed from, as it were, a collectivistic, or service system, sediment. What evolved was the administrator, a figure foreign to all skills, knowledge, and rules (meanings generally abstracted from the human dimension), but whose essence is manifested in relations with others-indiscriminate service to a superior and command over an inferior. Here the role content of activity has no intrinsic emotional significance. It acquires meaning only inasmuch as it is associated with (in fact, symbolizes) a meaningful, hierarchical, element of the structure of human relations. The institutional or organized sphere of human activity is composed of two types of relations. Apart from the role proper, or professional, type of relations, the administrative or status type may be isolated. When pro- 1324</page><page sequence="9">The Dual System jected from below, the latter constitutes specific service relations, the ser- vice object being the institutional agent of the consumer, or his "substi- tute," in the service system. The service system or administrative aspect of management we shall call the organized services. Another, much richer instance of the organized ser- vices may be seen in the historically important phenomenon of feudalism, of which the Japanese sociocultural pattern supplies a unique illustration. Moreover, it may be taken as a complete pattern of organization along the service axis, including not only secondary integration and direct enforce- ment of service discipline peculiar to organization proper but a highly de- veloped element of primary integration as well. While Protestantism, in paving the way for the role evolution of so- ciety, severed the actor-client connection, the Japanese pattern provides an opposite picture in which the strength and elaboration of the service- system type of control have been coupled with the inferiority of the role element. The Westerner, accustomed to associating order with social norms and well informed of the great orderliness of Japanese society, is be- wildered by the characteristic opportunism of the Japanese. A telltale ex- ample of the ". . . principle of no principle and the value of no value" (Doi 1974, p. 76) spirit of the Japanese order is supplied by the great Shintoist Norinaga Moto6ri: "A moral code was good for the Chinese, whose inferior nature requires such artificial means of restraint" (Bene- dict 1946, p. 191). This statement implies that the Japanese are more naturally organized. And, indeed, their service-system principle of organi- zation reveals rather explicitly social bonds which, in the role-control sys- tem, are disguised by the "idealistic" camouflage of Duty and Exploit. Some characteristic Japanese cultural traits which consolidate the system as a system of services are a highly refined "technology" of human con- tact, an abundance of holy days and other social occasions which serve as both aesthetic and plainly hedonistic stimulants of contact-emotional value (including strictly functional occasions such as the notorious banquets in the business sphere), and a remarkably developed vocabulary of inter- human emotions (Doi 1974). But the key role, presumably, is played by the characteristic Japanese style of upbringing. Witness, for example, the indulgent climate of childhood in general, or such a special cultural device as the interpretation of punishment as disease (Benedict 1946, p. 267), which helps to preserve the attractiveness of the agents of control. On the one hand, Japanese child rearing cultivates positive emotional value for association with others, superiors in general and elders in particular, while on the other, personal and collective loyalties (as opposed to impersonal norms) are made the principal disciplinary forms. In contrast to the role pattern of socialization, which is based on specific behavioral standards without a specific recipient, here the recipient is specified while the be- 1325</page><page sequence="10">American Journal of Sociology havior is presumed to be indiscriminate service. All means of secondary integration are characterized by the predominance of factors forcing the subject into personal and group loyalties over dicta abstracted from the human dimension. Among the many local notions of duty, those implying an actual object of obligations (giri, gimu, chu, ku, etc.) occupy a far more prominent place than those of the abstract Western type (e.g., nim- mu or hombun). In short, Japanese culture tends to concentrate its mean- ings in the human dimension in order to facilitate control by the service axis. Direct "existential" interpretation of the notion of social norms in ana- lyzing this system is, in my view, often misleading. Norms as such, that is, as distinct instruments of social control and meaningful psychological re- alities-cultural as well as legal and other formal norms-do not have the overwhelming significance in Japan that they do in Western societies. The duality of the social control paradigm poses the question of the subjective and, in the final analysis, sociological meaning of any positive social be- havior. No matter how meticulously detailed the Japanese codes may be, they are as superficial in the emotional sense as bureaucratic routine. They function simply as matter-of-fact specifications of the meaningful object's needs. The more dependability a particular sort of activity requires (i.e., the closer the matter is to the moral or institutional fields), the less the observable uniformities of behavior evidence the effect of impersonal stan- dards. Instead, they reflect the rigidity and elaboration of the structure of interhuman bonds, most prominently its hierarchical component. Scalar status becomes dominant while status role, the normative content of the related social position, declines. Scalar status, which signifies the subject's relative position within a hierarchy of power, is a phenomenon of the service system. Its relation- ship to the role entails a sociologically significant conflict. An order based on "unprincipled" service to superiors cannot help clashing with the "uni- versalistic" role order. Likewise, scalar status entails a particular manifes- tation of the human prestige disposition-static prestige. While dynamic prestige is peculiar to the role mentality and implies a valuable product or action, static prestige does not necessarily involve any activity. In fact, it operates not in the service system but in its antipode-the system of exploitation, that is, the opposite projection of the system organized as a system of relations. Manifestations of prestige disposition in relations be- tween the subject and the object of service, and in the context of work specifically, though typical of the "total services," are, as was already noted, less efficient (or productive) here than under the role system. The Japanese concern for reputation, for example, involves only a superficial layer of self-respect: being heavily committed to their public image (or "face"), the Japanese practically disregard substantial criteria of appraisal, 1326</page><page sequence="11">The Dual System professional standards in particular (Benedict 1946, p. 152). In general, no matter which projection of this pattern of organization is dealt with, the characteristic manifestations of what the Japanese call "duty to one's name" (the obvious locus of the prestige disposition)-that is, norms of self-restraint, etiquette, and reputation (Benedict 1946, p. 145) as well as obsession with "honor" (instead of "fame," which is peculiar to the role mentality) and its twin offspring, revenge and hara-kiri (instead of "ex- ploit")-betray the unproductive nature of non-role utilization of the hu- man prestige disposition. It was stated in the opening section of this article that the service sys- tem's only values are the actual needs of the social objects. While this may appear to be a metaphor, the Japanese example shows it to be quite literal. Every human need is considered inherently worthy. There are no right and wrong positions, for example, in Japanese judiciary practice; both parties are unquestionably right and, naturally, the only appropriate judgment is a compromise. No normative element of control is allowed to interfere with vital human interests and, thus, to infringe upon the dominion of the ser- vice system. Yet the concept of a service culture.,is quite meaningful as a normative body which conforms to the service system and reinforces its rule. While leaving intact the substantial element of human interaction, the service culture vastly elaborates upon its form. The paraphernalia of Japanese etiquette is not just innocuous for the service order but aestheti- cizes and helps to consolidate it. This applies to every case of ritualism, sacred as well as secular. "Emptiness" in terms of action is not just the "command" of ritualism but its meaning, since, as Weber said, it lets the service system "tie the individual . . . to persons instead of functional tasks." Norms of the service culture, which determine a substantial out- come of action, are sure not to relate to interaction-for example, the re- nowned Japanese self-restraint-and thus are irrelevant in the context of a division of labor. That social standards, moral codes in particular, are perceived by the integrated Japanese as emotionally neutral specifications of the require- ments of concrete, significant objects makes the efficiency of controls heav- ily dependent on the viability of those objects which personify certain codes as objects of service. This is especially important for nationwide issues where generally the subjects are isolated from their leader. A purely symbolic "ideal" object has relatively little appeal for the Japanese men- tality; in fact, it is accepted only to the extent of the subject's cognitive irrationality. A wide social group such as a "nation" is evidently more realistic as a service object; it is also the most natural bearer of power and, as will be shown below, the most appropriate object of service-system secondary integration. But, at the same time, it is too abstract an entity to be felt as really human. Accordingly, to put into action the primary 1327</page><page sequence="12">American Journal of Sociology element of the service system's resource of integration, which is presum- ably vital for a society which so radically dispenses with the role forces of control, the Japanese make a real person, the emperor, the principal national symbol. The following description of Japanese national integra- tion propounded by Meiji Reform covers virtually the entire logical se- quence above: "The Emperor was . . . made into a symbol which was placed beyond all reach of domestic controversy. . . . We surround our handling of the flag with a degree of ritual which we regard as completely inappropriate for any human being. The Japanese, however, capitalize to the hilt on the humanness of their supreme symbol. They could love and he could respond. . . . Teachers in training were flunked if they phrased man's highest duty as love of country; it had to be phrased as repayment to the Emperor in person" (Benedict 1946, pp. 128-29). This helped transform "normal" feudalism, which presupposed social segmentation for the use of personal forces of integration, into a unique society-wide pattern of feudalism. The same meaning may be ascribed to the Japanese worship of familial ancestors, predominantly recent ones. "The Japanese do not value piety except to those remembered in the flesh" (Benedict 1946, p. 122). Interacting with the role pattern, the uniquely meticulous and totally feudal elaboration of Japanese social organization (far more refined than its European counterpart, which was contaminated too early with the moral [or role] tendency inherent in Christianity) results in a seemingly paradoxical combination of consequences. On the one hand, all observers note the capacity of the Japanese to assimilate foreign values as something purely aesthetic or utilitarian. They simply cannot see any other sense in a thing so distant from the human dimension as social value. Ideological fanaticism and conflict are quite unlike the service-system pattern of or- ganization, their places being taken by patriotism and conflict of loyalties. On the other hand, there is the embarrassment experienced by the Japa- nese in a Western milieu--(Benedict 1946, pp. 224-27): when identifying themselves in terms of relations with others they plainly feel at a loss when the "place" of a man is expressed in abstract role terms.5 Westerners also find it difficult to adapt to the Japanese, but in this case the effect of psychocultural incompatibility can hardly be separated from the effects of the rigidity of the Japanese structure of personal ties, quite natural for a society where the dependability of that very structure ought to compensate for the inferiority of role control. The weaker the role con- trol, the stronger the service control should be; the stronger the service control, the less compatible it is with the logic of role behavior, which, 5 "When the Japanese want to express utter confusion, they say something is 'neither elder brother nor younger brother'" (Benedict 1946, p. 52). 1328</page><page sequence="13">The Dual System therefore, must be further suppressed, and the need for the stringency of the service type of organization becomes all the more intensified. This domino process perfects and purifies the pattern. And it would seem to be the way to unwavering stability for the service order, were it not for the paradoxical occurrence that when highly developed, it becomes too secure to be apprehensive of the forces of the alien system. It then opens up to the importation of such a "sociofact" of the latter as the vocational struc- ture which has emerged as a result of historical development along the role axis and which contains too powerful a ferment of the role order. We can now proceed to describe a mechanism of integration which up to this point has been only touched upon-that of identification. It is per- ceived here as a specific factor of sociopersonal integration of the hierarchi- cal social order.6 SECONDARY INTEGRATION ALONG THE SERVICE AXIS What seems to me the most authoritative sociological presentation defines identification as a type of social learning in which internalization of a role is reinforced by specific emotional links with the agent of that role (Par- sons and Bales 1955, pp. 54-65). These links function as the emotional aspect of the "we-category," embracing both the subject and the object of identification and providing a feeling of "oneness" with the object. It should be stressed that "oneness" here does not imply internalization of the object's own role, as it did in the original psychoanalytic version of this concept. Instead, a whole normative complex associated with the ob- ject is internalized and, as a component of this complex, so is the subject's own role. The concept is practically divorced from that of imitation. The object of identification only associates with the subject's role as the bearer of this role. As a result of identification, the individual can view compliance with 6 There is an interpretation of the stability of Japanese hierarchical order which char- acteristically contrasts with the foregoing reasoning-i.e., Lebra's (1974) treatment of the local notion of "on," which designates an obligation to reciprocate the service, as a norm of "asymmetric reciprocity." The patron's act of benevolence bestows on the recipient disproportionately heavy obligations, making him, in effect, a permanent debtor. Parental care, for example, must be returned by lifelong obedience. Lebra him- self discloses the vulnerability of his approach in pointing out the possibility of ". . . dissociat[ing] 'on'-bestowal from superiority in status" (Lebra 1974, p. 200). The asymmetry, of course, is sanctioned by the culture (as a culture of total services!), but as such it is just a "by-product" of the basic non-role principle of the Japanese pattern of control. Here again, the concept of social norm is used superficially, obscuring the actual mechanisms of control. Asymmetry in "on"-bestowal is the result rather than the cause of vertical structuring of the system; the asymmetry is added, superimposed on normal, equitable, reciprocal relations. The norm of reciprocity proper does not make the Japanese return his filial duty as much as it makes him look forward to ex- ploiting his own progeny as a means of evening the score with his progenitors. 1329</page><page sequence="14">American Journal of Sociology his role as a service to the object symbolizing it. The object functions as the personification of the superego, its representative in the service system, providing society with an additional avenue of control. But one of our major theses has been the self-sufficiency of each system; hence, we need to divorce the aspect of role learning from that of identification proper, that is, from emotional "oneness" with the object. I introduce, therefore, the concept of non-role, or direct, identification (as opposed to the con- ventional version which I would call symbolic).7 The learning of personal and collective loyalties, Japanese style, presents a society-wide example of this type of socialization, that is, internalization of the corporeal agent of social control without internalization of any cultural mentifacts.8 Naturally, when no sociopersonal integration is achieved, both systems depend on an external force. For the individual the primal significance of integration lies in more certain escape from punishment inflicted by this force. In the case of role internalization, the agent of sanctions is obscure (i.e., representatives of the normative order-the reference others-are not directly associated with power). When the service object is internalized the natural source of pupishment is not obscured: power is perceived as belonging to the object of identification. A sense of oneness with the object is tantamount to a feeling of safety resulting from a union with power. Disloyalty to the object of identification induces anxiety, a subconscious fear of losing his protection; loyalty is rewarded by a feeling of security.9 The prominence of vertical structuring and clan in the Japanese social pattern reflects the fact that two principal sources of social power are un- doubtedly status and collectivity. But the subject's mere belief in the ob- ject's control of the situation is sufficient for identification. The object need not necessarily be anthropomorphous (as it must be in primary inte- gration) and may even be a quite "amorphous" ideal. In addition, there exists a model of service socialization which dispenses with any tangible 7 In fact, a distinction between identification and substantive social learning is implied by many authors, notably in the context of propagandistic opposition to "blind identi- fication" vs. civilized (by Western standards, of course) individualism and "reason." The distinction does suggest itself, but academic science apparently needs more system- atic grounds to recognize the obvious. 8 Ruth Benedict's much criticized "misconcept" of the Japanese as a "shame culture"- a pattern conceived, contrary to "guilt culture," to be based predominantly on external control-is quite natural for one accustomed to treating socialization exclusively in role terms. The peculiarity of the Japanese conscience lies not in its lack of internaliza- tion of the means of control, as Benedict understood it, but in the nature of the inter- nalized objects. Japanese socialization is predominantly identification, i.e., internaliza- tion of the corporeal agent of order, and presumably it goes as deep as any internal- ization of the norm. 9Takeo Doi (1974) reduces practically the whole of the sociopsychical dynamics of the Japanese to a drive to amae-a blissful state of psychical symbiosis with the pro- tecting object, reducing the subject phenomenally and genetically to the emotional state of the child secure in his mother's lap. 1330</page><page sequence="15">The Dual System identification object well known in contemporary social thought as "au- thoritarian" socialization. The "authoritarian personality" identifies with anonymous power in and of itself and, it follows, with any current author- ity. This type of integration may be regarded as not just pathological but a "normal" instance of the depersonalization of social control, an alterna- tive to role control. While the latter evolved as a historically significant phenomenon within the Calvinist branch of the Reformation and in the Western democracies, the former found one of its most prominent societal manifestations in Lutheranism and German bureaucracies.10 The feasibility of direct identification, as revealed by the Japanese ex- ample, necessitates an elaboration of the concept of symbolic identification to dissociate it from a content peculiar to direct identification. We need to rule out "physical" power as a faculty constitutive of the identification object. Instead of authority over the subject as such, the object of syrn- bolic identification must be defined by another type of authority-author- ity over the role, that is, competence. Even in child socialization, the as- pect of the agent's competence can be dissociated from that of power since one learns not only submission but some substantial social skills, norms in particular. It follows from the discussion above that in perspective the only feasible scope of operation for the identification mechanism lies in the institutional sphere. As a result of a generally acknowledged tendency toward the decay of the "irrational" ideological basis of societal controls, coupled with equally apparent dissolution of communal microcosms, the worker's non- institutional identification with the client becomes improbable. Citizenship tends to be the only "we-category" common to both, yet it does not imply any hierarchy and has implications altogether too vague for an individual's everyday life. The prospect of humanizing worker-consumer relations, therefore, is based exclusively on primary integration. I now have completed the description of a complex model of socioper- sonal integration. Its main structural dimensions, the terms in which the behavior of the integrated individual is described, are as follows: (1) role behavior versus service behavior (integration with the role vs. integration with the service object); (2) functional versus dysfunctional (integration with the functional element of the role, with the client proper, or with the institutional client integrated with the functional element of his role vs. integration with the group-centered element of the role or with the insti- tutional client who is unintegrated or integrated with the group-centered element of his role); (3) free versus forced (positively reinforced inte- 10 "The general conclusion of scholars . . .is that Luther's tendencies to minimize the spiritual significance of political power and institutional policy encouraged in the Lu- theran church support for a monopoly of all kinds of temporal power . . . and an uncritical acceptance of political authority in its more negative and repressive forms" (Underwood 1968, p. 599). 1331</page><page sequence="16">American Journal of Sociology gration vs. negatively reinforced integration); (4) primary versus second- ary (integration based on social needs presuming neither internalization of normative cultural "mentifacts" nor identification with the corporeal agent of control vs. integration based on physical structures which are the outcome of social learning proper, i.e., the two processes described above); (5) hierarchical versus egalitarian (integration presupposing service to the object assumed as superior whether on the grounds of status power or on the grounds of authority vs. integration which does not presuppose any vertical dimension of relations). Points 3, 4, and 5 may be described as dimensions of a psychological model of integration. Before proceeding to the construction of the ideal, let me explicate some of its general features which emerge from the analysis made so far. The Japanese type of social integration provides an example of total application of the service-system principles of organization, while its Cal- vinist alternative may be considered exemplary for its total utilization of role principles. Both are distinguished by their homogeneity. But the short- comings of these "pure" patterns of control are equally well known: for example, individualistic American culture, predominantly Puritan by ori- gin, cannot produce a servant meeting the Japanese standard, while the Japanese professional cannot match his American counterpart in inventive- ness. The formal capacity of both systems to produce an ideal worker in any field is axiomatic. Regarding the utilization of man's natural propensities, each system offers different opportunities in different situations: the problem of control economy or the efficiency of the social system arises. Obviously, shaping an individual to view his achievement as a service to someone, though feasible, is not worthwhile from the broader socioeconomic perspective, given the resources of the prestige motivation, a natural motivating force for an activity whose product may be perceived as an achievement. Indis- criminate dominance of either system necessarily leaves untapped some of the useful potentials of human activity. A decline of ideology, then, actu- ally signifies progress in terms of the line of reasoning presented in this paper. An ideal of social organization, or division of labor (as an entity monopolizing the organizational principle), or cooperation (as a form of organization productively oriented) rules out those "universal" means of control alien to the nature of a particular activity. In that respect total role (or ideological) control as well as total service (or feudal) control is as crude and formal as bureaucratic management recognized as such. In fact, this paper is an attempt to construct a realistic model of rational distribution of the two types of sociopersonal integration through the whole range of social action based on real psychological and situational possibilities. Unlike the crude strategy of coexistence, an ideal of cooperation should 1332</page><page sequence="17">The Dual System utilize the maximum of natural resources present in a situation. Specifi- cally, it should maximize the free element of sociopersonal integration. This follows from simple acceptance of the decay of non-work socializa- tion coupled with a ruling out of in-work disciplinary pressure and related negative integration (internalization of the said pressure): an undisci- plined individual would not endure a work load unless the related emo- tional gain was worth the losses. The hierarchical dimension of social action is relevant to the attempted model of the ideal only to the extent that it implies service to the "role master" (out of respect). Any assumption of the reality of scalar status and service to the "personal master" (etiologically reduced to "fear") would clearly profane the ideal of universal self-motivation implied above. Finally, two more features of the intended model should be noted: first, the only relevant type of worker-client (noninstitutional) integration is primary integration, and, second, a model of integration should conform simultaneously to the imperatives of adaptation and functionality. AN OUTLINE OF THE IDEAL DIVISION OF LABOR Our task now is to construct a model of stable and efficient societal work organization, one minimizing the coercive element of control and ruling out non-work socialization and external enforcement of discipline. The construct of an ideal division of labor emerges from two tendencies: (1) isolation from the consumer and his institutional agent, the manager, and self-sustaining role integration owing first and foremost to the com- plexity of the work, and (2) primary integration with the consumer, made possible by immediate contact with him. These two processes are based on contrasting psychological mechanisms: (1) an "individualistic" motivation centered on achievement and abstracted from the human di- mension (other persons function here only as a frame of reference for self-appraisal), and (2) the affiliative disposition implying an intrinsic "consumer" value of the other for the subject. The situational keys to these opposite patterns of integration also contrast. If the subject matter of the work is complicated, abstract, and special, and the product is a self-existent entity to all the "cofunctioners" but, at the same time, mean- ingless to any consumer proper, we have an ideal situation for role in- tegration. The related social body, science, is a clearly identified institu- tional body, self-sufficient and imbued with intense intercoffmunication, factors which simultaneously serve both substantive (cooperational) and motivational ends. If the subject matter of the work is trivial, concrete, and unspecified as far as the content of the activity is concerned (just a service-what- ever a consumer needs), and the product is inseparable from the consumer 1333</page><page sequence="18">American Journal of Sociology and, therefore, relevant to no one but a definite consumer (actually the state of a consumer), we have an ideal situation for service-system in- tegration. The related social manifestations do not create an identifiable, structured social body: communication between co-workers is meaningless both from the substantive and the social control points of view. Ideal services are atomized and integrated with a structureless object-the client. The individual serviceworker "dissolves" in his social milieu and develops links with a familiar circle of clients. This circle shrinks to its limits, allowing intimate worker-client relations and minimal work pres- sure. Accordingly, the service sphere must grow. One should note that the particularism described above does not mean the worker's consistent alienation from the outsider, since the worker and his clients do not belong to any common context of socialization: they do not identify themselves with one and the same structured collectivity. Primary integration implies no distinct social boundaries, and its po- tential object is any human being as long as that person is not an im- mediate nuisance for the worker. Relations between ideal services and the institutional (professional) sphere have two sides. On the one hand, the latter acts as a client to the former. The specific character of the institutional object's needs does not entail specialization on the part of the service worker: here, as well as in the case of the consumer proper, the ideal provider of services has no special skills, or rather, he does not see his services as something special, no matter what outstanding abilities they may require. He just loves his clients and does for them all he can as a human being. This tendency to service universality erodes that element of structuring re- sultant from the "molding effect" of the structured institutional client. In an ideal situation the client acts as an integral individual, whose every need is equally relevant to the person who provides services. Natural- ly, a proper object of such total care should be an integral personality, his vocational needs being as "organic" as biological ones. Even the territorial division of the object's private and professional lives obstructs actualization of the service ideal. On the other hand, the professional sphere supplies goods, the resources of service. The corresponding aspect of the ideal is in full opposition to the contemporary image of the simple services as distributive adjuncts of the institutional (industrial) sphere. Ideal services operate as a part of the client's community, representing its interests to the producers. The many signs of stubborn resistance on the part of contemporary services to structural incorporation into industry may be deemed symptomatic. The services, as it were, put up with dependency on the client and all the instability accompanying it for the sake of closeness to their "destined" object of integration. 1334</page><page sequence="19">The Dual System The vocational sphere, governed by both models of integration, tends to differentiate itself and develop into a corresponding pair of ideal social bodies-science and the nonspecialized, trivial personal services. The decay of power as an instrument of social control and the related evolu- tion of management may be approached along the same lines. Manage- ment develops as a profession along the role axis. Its manipulation of the productive worker or serviceworker, rendered dysfunctional and, clear- ly, impossible because of the professionalization of management and humanization of the worker, evolves into scientific coordination of the producers (professions) between themselves and with the needs of the consumer. Manipulation changes to its opposite, service to the worker, along the service axis. The humanization of management converts the organized services into "normal" unstructured ones, and the degeneration of the hierarchical component couples with a simultaneous shift of service direction. But the principal obstacle to any realization of a social order resulting from the two integrational tendencies is not the alienating interference of power. Quite the opposite. It lies in the freedom inherent in applied creative work. If the subject matter of this work is biological man, the situation proves ambiguous as to the determination of the axis of in- tegration, but it is, nevertheless, theoretically capable of full integration. The creative potentials of medicine are limited by the objective character of the biologically "good" or "bad" (just as the creative potentials of science are limited by its modeling essence). This is not so when the subject matter of applied creative work is any other object, or to a certain degree, a social aspect of man. In that case, the situation bears a germ of immanent unintegratibility, an element of free creative work or art. My final point is that the main feature of the developed construct, the feature which distinguishes it from the "classical" precapitalistic pat- terns of sociopersonal integration, is that, while conforming to the im- perative of functionality, it does not run counter to the other principal systemic imperative, adaptation. In its humanistic aspect the constructed ideal is absolutely free of any obstacle to adaptation, since the primary integration (or "quasi integration") on which it rests presupposes in- strumental behavior. In its professional aspect the system hampers de- velopment only insofar as cooperation requires a common language. The limitation then is a natural one for the freedom of homo socialis.
