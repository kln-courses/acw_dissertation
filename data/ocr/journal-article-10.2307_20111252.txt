<plain_text><page sequence="1">Buddhism and Early Narrative Illustration in China Julia K. Murray University of Wisconsin-Madison Xvecent research on early Buddhist art in India and China has focused attention on the importance of studying the iconography of representational imagery in relation to reli gious doctrines and practices, as well as social customs.1 Pictorial storytelling in the decorative programs of sites such as the Great St?pa at Sa?chi and the Mogao caves at Dunhuanga has been demonstrated to be integral to the re ligious activities performed there. In similar fashion, inno vative studies have demonstrated how pictorial imagery in early Chinese tombs and shrines functioned to fulfil the rit ual and social requirements of the funerary setting.2 Much of this recent scholarship has implications for our under standing of Buddhism's impact on Chinese culture and, conversely, the sinicization of the imported religion. In light of these larger issues, the purpose of the present arti cle is to examine the early development of Chinese narra tive illustration, focusing particularly on the structural forms in which it was presented. The problem of defining what is meant by (or should be meant by) the term "narrative illustration" has never been squarely addressed in modern scholarship on Chinese art,3 with the result that the term has been applied to a very broad range of works.4 Implicit definitions that are cur rently in use have been derived from Western art history; there is no traditional Chinese term for "narrative" per se, whether in regard to painting or literature.5 For this reason, we should be cautious in adopting the insights of recent Western literary scholarship on narrative.6 Although a cul turally neutral concept of narrative illustration does not ex ist, justifications can be found for grouping certain works together in order to analyze common elements of compo sitional structure. For the purposes of the present discus sion, my working definition of narrative illustration will be: the pictorial representation of or reference to one or more "events" that occur in a sequence of time and that bring about a change in the condition of at least one character. Scholars of Chinese painting generally subscribe to a number of tacit assumptions concerning the origins and de velopment of Chinese narrative illustration. One supposi tion is that an illustration that depicts a story by means of a single epitomizing composition probably came from a set (or "cycle") of pictures that delineated several events in the plot. Here I will argue that in early Chinese illustration, a narrative subject was more likely to expand into a multi scene cycle from a monoscene, rather than the reverse. Another assumption with which I will take issue is that the Chinese handscroll format significantly influenced the compositional structure of paintings that depicted Indian Buddhist narratives. In recent years, this view has been as serted with increasing stridency,7 yet even scholars who have no personal investment in cultural priorities have gen erally failed to notice that the assumption is at odds with both visual and documentary evidence.8 Moreover, the be lief that the Chinese handscroll shaped the representation of Buddhist narratives is based on yet another supposition for which there is little supporting evidence, namely, that the handscroll was a standard format for Chinese painting in the period before Buddhism interacted significantly with Chinese art and culture. However, handscrolls were rarely used for painting before the late Han.9 Accordingly, I wish to examine the possibility that the development of the handscroll as a format for painting was stimulated by the ar rival of Buddhism and a new need to illustrate unfamiliar stories in detail. MODES OF NARRATIVE REPRESENTATION IN ANCIENT CHINA In his well-known book on the evolution of narrative il lustration in the European tradition, Kurt Weitzmann ad vanced the hypothesis that single-scene epitomizing illus trations had come into being as excerpts from larger and fuller pictorial cycles.10 Although no complete cycles sur vived from ancient times, he postulated that they had ex isted in the Hellenistic period, because he found an assort ment of objects whose decoration preserved different scenes from the same story. Weitzmann's paradigm was generally accepted by historians of Western art and has been extended indiscriminately to the art of other re gions.11 In Chinese art, however, narrative cycles do not appear before single-scene epitomes.12 Instead, early Chinese illustration seems to have been largely mono scenic, and a single representation might symbolize a com plex historical, biographical, or mythological narrative. A very few illustrations could arguably be called "conflated" narratives, because they appear to refer to more than one moment in the plot, by showing the main characters mak ing gestures that signify separate events or by including ob jects that appear at different points in the story.13 Pao-chen 17</page><page sequence="2">Pi Fig. i.Jing Ke Attempts to Assassinate the King of Qin, Eastern Han period, second century, incised stone slab from the Wu Family Shrines, Jiaxiang, Shandong.

Chen has argued that at the Wu Family Shrines, illustra tions of Jing Ke'sb attempt to assassinate Qin Shihuangdic depict five stages in the story (Fig. i).14 However, the com position is more easily read as a unified picture of the mo ment that Jing Ke's attempt to kill the tyrant has decisively 18 failed. Chen also presents the mural Two Peaches Kill Three Warriors in Han tomb 61 at Luoyang as a "continuous" nar rative in which three successive scenes are portrayed, a novel reading of the composition.15 In any event, these ex amples are still a long way from the kind of large and de tailed narrative cycles that emerged in China during the Period of Disunion (a.D. 222-589). Both the literary evidence concerning long-lost early Chinese paintings and the extant examples of early narra tive depictions in durable media suggest that early Chinese pictorial representations were created to invoke the associ ations of edifying stories for suasive or symbolic purposes.16 Confucius himself (ca. 551-479 b.c.) was said to have been inspired to think about the lessons of the past when he vis ited the Zhou dynasty ancestral temple, the mingtangd ("Hall of Light"), and saw wall paintings portraying good and evil men and women of ancient times (Fig. 2).17 His followers understood this anecdote to signify the impor tance of representational images for encouraging the devel opment of moral values. In the early Han period (206 B.c.-A.D. 220), in the very region where Confucius had lived and taught three centuries earlier, the prince of Lue decorated the reception hall of his palace with exemplary images to inspire moral reflection by all who entered. According to the Eastern Han poet Wang Yanshou'sf de scription in the Lingguangdian fu?&gt; (Rhapsody on the Hall of Numinous Light), the murals portrayed all manner of beings from cosmic deities to recent historical figures, both good and evil. Other sources describe wall paintings of exem plary officials in palace halls and official buildings in the two Han capitals.18 During the Han period, freestanding screens also were used as surfaces on which to represent the historical figures whose lives and deeds were taken to exemplify good or evil. These screens were displayed in the palace as pictorial admonitions to the emperor and his ladies. The Han em peror Wudih (r. 141-87 b.c.) had a screen depicting the last Shang ruler, King Zhou1 (ca. 1100 b.c.) and his consort Daji,J as a reminder that debauchery would destroy the</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 3.

Selected from among the biographical anecdotes recorded by Liu Xiangk (77-6 b.c.) in Lienil zhuan1 (Biographies of Exemplary Women), some of the women were renowned for their feminine virtues while others were notorious for their vices.20 Although the Han screens have not survived, their character may be imagined from late Han incised-stone tablets, such as those at the Wu Family Shrines, in which cultural heroes and instructive stories about virtuous men and women are represented.21 A post-Han lacquer screen excavated from the tomb of Sima Jinlongm (d. 484) near Datongn is also useful for visualizing the lost Han screens because it is decorated, as they were, with annotated illus trations of anecdotes about exemplary women from Liu Xiang's anthology.22 In order for such paintings to achieve didactic purposes, the viewer had to be able to identify their subjects and re call the stories associated with them. Although intended to make people think about the moral issues, such illustrations nonetheless were pictorially not very explanatory. A mon oscenic illustration rarely was sufficiently detailed to serve as a visual surrogate for the story. Typically, the exemplar was portrayed alone or with a few other figures, and per haps the scene also included some object that figured in the biographical anecdote. Nonetheless, the stories represented were widely known and familiar to their intended viewers, who probably could indeed identify them from a mono scenic illustration that contained well-chosen figures and characterizing motifs. Furthermore, the early association of Chinese writing with pictorial images was another important element that enabled a single-scene epitomizing illustration to be ade quate for didactic purposes. What might otherwise be a generic portrait of a single figure or a conventional repre sentation of figures interacting could be made specific by providing labels. Once viewers recognized the story, they could be expected to remember what it was about. Alternatively, a short text could be written next to the pic torial image to ensure comprehension, as in Figure 3, where a note explains how the suicide of the Virtuous Aunt of Liang0 demonstrated her righteousness.23 Because writing has held high prestige in China from ancient times onward, the juxtaposition of the written word was not considered a distraction from the pictorial image. In fact, the presence of writing would have elevated the merely pictorial by bringing it firmly into alignment with the high cultural tradition. It may also be argued that early Chinese narrative scenes were not necessarily intended to be "read" in a literal sense. Instead, they may sometimes have served the symbolic pur pose of affirming the fundamental values of the moral or der that governed the cosmic and human realms. Images depicted on tombs and offering shrines in particular seem likely to have functioned as embodiments of cosmic prin ciples, deployed to create a congenial environment for the spirits that dwelled there or that came when sacrifices were offered.24 Although offering shrines were seen by the many people who came to the cemetery on ritual occasions, dec orations inside the structures would have been difficult to decipher. However, they would have posed no problems for their primary audience, the spirits of the deceased. To summarize, the various purposes of narrative illustra tion in pre-Buddhist China were adequately served by compositions that symbolized or epitomized the stories rather than representing them in a sequential mode. BUDDHISM AND NARRATIVE ILLUSTRATION IN THE POST-HAN PERIOD A need and stimulus to illustrate stories in more detail arose in the post-Han period, when a great and complex mass of unfamiliar narratives came to China with Buddhism, an evangelical religion. Indian Buddhism was rich in stories that embodied religious principles or contained themes that were appropriate for proselytizing or instruction. There were over 500 legends concerning the previous lives of the Buddha, a detailed biography of his last earthly life, innu merable parables embodying a variety of doctrinal princi 19</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 4.

In addition, many sutras incorporated stories that helped to explain religious teachings. Accord ingly, the entry of Buddhism into China introduced a large number of new stories to a new audience. Few Chinese were literate at that time, and pictures may have provided an effective means of instructing or appealing to potential converts. Because the stories were unfamiliar, it would have been easier for the viewer to comprehend the illustra tions if the story were divided into a sequence of individ ual events that were represented one at a time. The use of pictorial narration, a progressive series of scenes that portray an unfolding plot, is a fundamentally different way of illustrating a story from simply depicting its most characteristic attributes in a single epitomizing com position. Before the arrival of Buddhism in China, there seems to have been no tradition of representing narratives in sequential pictures, as I have suggested above. There fore, it seems likely that techniques of pictorial narration ei ther entered China along with the Buddhist stories them selves or developed as a means to facilitate teaching the doctrines and attracting converts.25 MODES OF EXTENDED NARRATIVE ILLUSTRATION IN ANCIENT INDIA Earlier than in China, there is abundant evidence for pic torial narrative cycles in Indian art, including depictions of stories about the Buddha's previous incarnations (j?taka tales) and legends concerning the events of his last earthly life. These themes appear in some of the bas-relief panels 20 that survive from the st?pa railings and gates at Bh?rhut in the second century b.c. (Fig. 4), and also appear on the richly ornamented gates of the Great St?pa at S?nchi in the first century b.c. (Fig. 5). In addition, the st?pa mound it self might have narrative panels inset on its surface, where they could be viewed in sequence by circumambulating monks and pilgrims, an arrangement that is actually de picted on second or third century panels from a st?pa at Amar?vat? (Fig. 6).26 Such narrative scenes would inspire and edify the worshipers who came to offer devotions and accumulate religious merit at the st?pa. Moreover, the good karma built up sequentially through the former and present lives of the Buddha would be activated for each pil grim and help him or her eventually achieve the Theravada goal of enlightenment. Illustrations of events from the life of the Buddha on portable shrines also served these pur poses.27 As surviving examples of early Indian Buddhist art demonstrate, various strategies were used in ancient India to create multi-scene narrative illustrations. One approach was to devise a sequence of separate, single-event scenes, a technique that I will refer to as "segmented" narrative, in preference to Weitzmann's "cyclical" narrative.28 An alter native was to create a single, continuous composition, in which successive events were portrayed by repeating figures and other motifs as needed, a technique usually termed "continuous" narrative. Segmented scenes seem particularly to have been associated with representations of the life of the Buddha, especially after the introduction of anthropomorphic images of the Buddha during the Kush?n dynasty. Sometimes just the most important events in his</page><page sequence="5">Ufe were represented in a segmented narrative, with sepa rate scenes to depict his Birth, Enlightenment, First Ser mon, Death, and so forth. Each scene clearly occupied its own space and was sometimes enclosed in a frame, yet the compositions also formed a visually consistent sequence that transcended their divisions. Single episodes in the life of the Buddha, which might comprise several sequential stages, were sometimes illus trated in continuous compositions. A well-known example is the event known as the Great Departure, which is carved in stone on the middle architrave of the East Gate of the Great St?pa at S?nchi (Fig. 5).29 The stages of Prince Siddh?rtha's departure from the palace are portrayed in se quence from left to right, although the anthropomorphic representation of the Prince is avoided. First, the Prince's horse and groom, accompanied by devas, are shown leav ing the royal city of Kapilav?stu, and the unseen Sid dhartha's presence is suggested by the royal parasol held over the horse. The group is repeated three times to indi cate the progress of the journey, and finally the horse and groom turn back toward the city, away from the parasol and a pair of giant footprints, which symbolize the Buddha. The riderless horse appears five times in the composition. An even longer continuous narrative illustration is carved on the lowest architrave of the North Gate, starting in the middle of the front side and proceeding across the entire rear surface, from right to left (Fig. 7). It depicts the Vessantaraj?taka, the story of the penultimate incarnation of the Buddha-to-be as an extremely generous prince. Ban ished from his kingdom for giving away a precious rain making elephant, he proceeded to part with the rest of his possessions, even his wife and children. These episodes are presented in sequence, with rich detail and many repeti tions of the dramatis personae. Some scholars believe that storytellers in ancient India used rolls of pictures to illustrate their recitations.30 Ancient literature alludes to the practice, and rolls illustrating the previous lives of the Buddha may likewise have been used as visual aids. It is often suggested that the decoration on the gates at S?nchi evokes the appearance of such illustrated rolls.31 The pictorial scenes in each architrave are framed by spiraling flourishes at the ends, as if imitating a picture be ing unrolled. Because little evidence has been brought forth in support of the argument, however, it remains just a tantalizing possibility.32 POST-HAN MODES OF NARRATIVE ILLUSTRATION In China, both the surviving visual evidence and docu mentary records suggest that the techniques of segmented narrative illustration (a series of linked single-scene com positions) and continuous narrative illustration (an undi vided composition that presents a sequence of events) came into use after the Han period. The earliest extant examples, including those in media closely allied to painting, belong to the later part of the Northern Wei dynasty (386-535), Fig. 6.

After Robert Knox, Amaravati (London: Trustees of the British Museum, 1992), p. 69. long after Buddhism became established in China. In addi tion to murals at Dunhuang, these examples include a painted lacquer coffin of about 470, excavated at Guyuan,P Ningxia,^ which is decorated with illustrations of stories of filial sons (Fig. 8).33 Each story is illustrated as a segmented nararative, with the main events of the plot laid out one af ter another in several scenes, some of which are labeled with inscriptions. The section reproduced here depicts the story of Guo Ju,r who was renowned for filially serving his mother. Afraid that he would be unable to support his mother after the birth of his child, he asked his wife to take the baby and bury it alive. When they started to dig the hole, a pot of gold miraculously appeared, giving Guo Ju enough money to support both his mother and his child. 21</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 7.

These episodes are separated visually by ornately decorated triangles that extend between them. Several fifth- and sixth-century caves at Dunhuang con tain murals illustrating narratives that had come from India and Central Asia, primarily drawn from the legends of the Buddha's Mcj?taka tales, and stories about the good or bad acts of other beings (avadar?as).34 These illustrations exhibit a variety of treatments of the narrative subject matter, rang ing from the representation of a single aspect in one com position, to a series of consecutive scenes. Moreover, the single compositions are not necessarily epitomizing mono 22 scenes. For example, a large mural in the antechamber of cave 254 portrays the Attack of Mara, an episode from the Ufe of the Buddha (Fig. 9), in which the Buddha demon strated his readiness for enlightenment.35 The profusion of vignettes in the composition suggest that it is a "conflated" narrative, in which figures or props referring to several moments are combined into a single composition.36 More over, the painting also combines elements of a timeless icon with those of time-bound narrative depiction.37 The earth touching Buddha is presented as a seated frontal figure, far larger than any others, and he is further set off by his mul</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 9.

To either side, frenetic demons and warriors pursue the onslaught, and those who have al ready been vanquished either lie on the ground or make gestures of supplication. In the lower right, M?ra's beauti ful daughters gesture seductively, but at the lower left, they appear to have become bodhisattvas. The Mah?sattva (or Tiger) j?taka in the same cave (Fig. 10) depicts an earlier incarnation of the Buddha in a "syn optic" narrative illustration, in which the separate moments of the story are portrayed in a single large composition, us ing multiple representations of figures and motifs as neces sary.38 Unlike continuous narrative, which it otherwise re sembles, synoptic narrative does not present sequential events in a simple linear progression. Instead, the narrative path may proceed in a circle, jump back and forth, or oth erwise take a direction that is hard to follow unless the viewer is very familiar with the story. The Mah?sattva il lustration in cave 254 contains seven scenes, which begin in the upper center with a representation of the three princes, and move roughly clockwise over the surface as they en counter the starving tigress and Mah?sattva sacrifices him self, ending in the upper left with the pagoda built in his memory. As Hsio-yen Shih has pointed out, the reading of this panel is clarified by its placement opposite the repre sentation of the ?ibi j?taka, in which the being who sacrifices himself is shown much larger than the other figures and already has attributes of a bodhisattva.39 The well-known mural depicting the avadar?a of the Conversion of 500 Robbers, on the south wall of cave 285, offers an example of continuous narrative (Fig. 11). Suc cessive events in the story are depicted within minimally defined pockets of space and proceed from left to right in chronological sequence. However, the individual scenes appear at variable heights on the wall, rather than main taining a consistent baseline. At the left, a few representa tive bandits are first portrayed in fierce combat with the soldiers sent to subdue them. Then they are defeated, bound as captives, disrobed, and blinded. In their distress, they call upon the Buddha, who causes the mountain peaks to emit a healing perfume that restores their eyesight. The bandits dash about joyfully waving their arms, then kneel before the Buddha to repent their former ways. Finally, they take the tonsure to become Buddhist monks and are last seen meditating in a bamboo grove at right. Pictorial narratives that portray a number of episodes in a series of more or less separate scenes along a common base line, in the manner of a frieze, also appear in early caves at Dunhuang. The linear sequence may run in a single, con tinuous strip or be divided between two or more, as in the case of the Mah?sattva j?taka in cave 428 (Fig. 12), which is presented in three horizontal registers, one on top of another. The successive episodes in the story are laid out scene by scene, repeating the cast of characters and significant ele ments of the setting as often as necessary. Each scene de picts a single event in an irregularly shaped pocket of space, which is partially separated from adjacent scenes by angled rows of colored triangles. Thus, the configuration is some where between a segmented and a continuous narrative, because the triangles serve to isolate and frame the scenes. Most scholars explain the arrangement of scenes into long horizontal friezes as the result of the influence of the Chinese handscroll format. For example, Jin Weinuo states that multiple, linked scenes organized into horizontal reg isters obviously show the influence of Chinese handscroll 23</page><page sequence="8">&gt;**&amp; i V. A *"/!

After Tonkd Bakukd kutsu, vol. 1, pis. 131-132. painting and are a sign of the sinicization of Buddhist art.40 This explanation assumes both that the presentation of suc cessive scenes in a linear sequence is an innately Chinese preference,41 and that the early caves at Dunhuang are ap propriately characterized as "Chinese." However, let us look more closely at the Mah?sattva j?taka in cave 428. The sequence of scenes goes from right to left along the top reg ister, from left to right in the middle register, and once more from right to left on the bottom. This reversal of di rection is natural and convenient for viewing multiple hor izontal registers arranged in a vertical stack, because it al lows the viewer's eyes to move easily from the last scene in one register to the first in the register below. However, if 24 the handscroll format influenced the creation of this illus tration (and its counterpart, the Sudh?na j?taka on the other side of the cave door),42 there should be no reversal of di rection. This is because the surface of a handscroll is con tinuous, and dividing it into shorter segments for stacking would not affect the direction of the flow of scenes. In other words, if the conventions of the handscroll format were instrumental in creating the composition, then we would expect the scenes in each register to proceed in the same direction. The illustration of the Deer King (Rum) j?taka in cave 257 (Fig. 13) provides an example of an extended narrative whose compositional structure suggests a logic different</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 12. Mah?sattva j?taka, Dunhuang cave 428, east wall, Northern Zhou period, mid-late sixth century. After Tonkd Bakukd kutsu, vol. 1, pi. 168. Fig. 13. Deer King j?taka, Dunhuang cave 257, west wall, Northern Wei period, late fifth century. After Tonkd Bakukd kutsu, vol. 1, pi. 44. from that of a handscroll. The episodes of the story are de picted in a single register on the western wall, but they do not proceed in simple linear sequence. The first scene, in which the deer rescues a man from drowning, appears at the southern (left) end of the wall, and the adjacent scene shows the man kneeling in gratitude before the creature. The direction of development in these two scenes is to ward the center of the wall. However, the third and fourth events, which take place in the palace, are illustrated at the other end of the strip and also develop toward the center. The queen dreams of the marvelous deer and tells the king, who posts a reward for the deer. The rescued man then di vulges the deer's whereabouts and leads the way, but his body is suddenly covered in scabs as heavenly punishment for his betrayal. The story ends near the middle of the strip, where the king learns how the deer saved the man and or ders it to be protected. In other words, some scenes move from left to right and others from right to left, and the end ing appears near the center of the composition.43 This bidi rectionality would be awkward and unnatural in a hand scroll, making it unlikely that the handscroll format determined the structure of this composition. Instead, the arrangement creates a contrast, both geographical and moral, between events that take place out in the wilderness (at left) and those in the worldly context of the palace (at right).44 Accordingly, even though the pictorial narratives of caves 428 and 257 occupy horizontal strips whose gen eral appearance resembles handscrolls, the compositions are not governed by handscroll conventions. Another point to consider is that the early caves at Dunhuang exhibit a mixture of Indian, Central Asian, and Chinese painting styles. This mixture can be demonstrated even in a single cave. For example, the paintings on the western wall of cave 285 appear to be purely Central Asian (Fig. 14), in contrast to the Chinese style of those elsewhere in the cave, including the previously discussed Conversion of 300 Robbers (see Fig. 11).45 During the fourth through sixth centuries, the residents and sojourners at Dunhuang were ethnically diverse,46 and the religious art made at the oasis during this period reflects this diversity. Therefore, not all paintings in the early caves at Dunhuang should be consid ered purely "Chinese,"47 nor are these paintings necessarily 25</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 14. Vishnu and guardians, Dunhuang cave 285, west wall, Western Wei period, mid-sixth century. After Tonkd Bakukd kutsu, vol. 1, pi. 118. similar to ones made in the Chinese metropolitan centers far to the east. It is well to be cautious in using early Dunhuang paintings to shed light on early Chinese paint ing, because some elements may have come from other tra ditions. Since a variety of modes for narrative illustration are found in the Buddhist and cosmopolitan context of Dun huang and not in pre-Buddhist Chinese illustration, it seems possible that techniques of pictorial narration were part of the cultural equipage of Buddhism, partly explained there by the emphasis on accumulating good karma through events that take place in the sequential experience of numerous life-cycles. An alternative possibility is that the more detailed modes of depicting narrative evolved as the religion was propagated to new audiences. In any event, by the fifth century, Buddhist temples in south China were commissioning painters to illustrate Buddhist stories in long handscrolls, probably using the techniques of extended pic torial narration that are seen in slightly later examples carved in stone.48 However, even after the introduction of 26 new techniques of narrative illustration, the pre-Buddhist monoscenic mode did not disappear but always continued to be an option.49 I would also propose that it was the need to illustrate Buddhist narratives that stimulated painters more thor oughly to explore the handscroll's inherent advantages for depicting subjects that embodied temporal and/or spatial progression. The handscroll's ability to accommodate hor izontal extension made it well suited for portraying a series of events in a clear linear sequence. Although handscrolls existed in pre-Buddhist China, they were used mostly for written texts, having come into use by the early Han pe riod as a costlier and more elegant replacement for rolls of bamboo or wooden strips. By contrast, paintings ofthat pe riod were mostly executed on walls or screens; and the documentary sources that record Han paintings almost never use the word juans (handscroll) to describe them, but rather tu* (picture) or pingfengu (screen). The earliest recorded paintings in handscroll form were pictures that accompanied texts, specifically works on military arts.50</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 15.

According to Zhang Yanyuan'sv ninth-century account, a set of 50 handscrolls was made at the command of the Eastern Han emperor Mingdiw (r. 57-75). They contained eulogies and pictures based on themes that were selected from the classics and histories by court scholars and were il lustrated by court artists.51 The text-and-picture mode was also used in many later handscrolls, such as the well-known Admonitions of the Instructress to the Palace Ladies (N?shi zhen tux) and the illustration of the "Benevolent and Wise" chapter from the Biographies of Exemplary Women (Lien? Renzhi tuY) (Fig. 15), attributed to Gu Kaizhi2 (ca. 344-ca. 405); and probably in many of the now-lost works Usted by Zhang Yanyuan.52 However, the text-and-picture format did not fully ex ploit the handscroll's potential for representing progres sions in time and space, the kind of treatment we see, for example, in the illustrations of the great secular theme, Rhapsody on the Goddess of the Luo River (Luoshenfu^)(Fig. 16).53 In this masterly work, the successive scenes in the story of the poet's ill-fated romance with the lovely god dess unfold within a long and continuous landscape, and the images of the two lovers and their attendants appear again and again. In order for the handscroll to become this fully developed as a format for painting, it first had to stop being identified primarily as a surface for writing. Artists had to break free of the restrictions implied by the presence of text in order to discover the potential for extended pic torial representation. This step was taken in the post-Han period, when paintings were more frequently done in handscrolls and their subjects were often illustrations of Buddhist themes. One pre-Buddhist element that may have contributed to Chinese artists' readiness to recognize the handscroll's pos sibilities for pictorial narration was the Han practice of dec orating the walls of tombs, sarcophagi, and offering shrines with processions and hunting scenes arranged in horizontal registers (Fig. 17). As previously noted, such representa tions were intended to provide for the needs of the soul in its afterlife and to affirm the cosmic order in the context of memorial sacrifices.54 Although the content of such scenes is not explicitly narrative because nothing "happens," the compositions provide a precedent for laying out pictures in long strips. Regardless of its content, a long striplike picture suggests the passage of time and movement in space. The 27</page><page sequence="12">combination of this artistic legacy with the stimulus of Buddhism's need for detailed narrative representations was highly propitious for the handscroll to mature as a format for both religious and secular painting. When Buddhism required pictorial art to do more than just symbolize or de note certain well-known values, there were forms at hand that could be adapted to accommodate more extended pic torial storytelling. In conclusion, rather than assume that the existence of the handscroll in China induced Buddhist narrative subjects to be illustrated in a sequential presentation, I am propos ing that the development of the handscroll as a format for painting in China was stimulated by the advent of Bud dhism. The demand for illustrating new stories in detail led artists to explore the handscroll's potential, and the possi bilities that opened up were soon applied to secular illus trations of indigenous Chinese subjects as well. Notes Preliminary versions of this research were presented at the 1992 College Art Association annual meeting in Chicago, and at the 1994 Interna tional Conference on Dunhuang Studies in Dunhuang, China. I am grateful to the following for their thoughtful comments on earlier drafts: Thomas Lawton, Anne Clapp, Maggie Bickford, Bob Bagley, Gene Phillips, Andy Reschovsky, and the University of Wisconsin graduate students in my 1993 seminar on narrative painting. I also wish to thank the anonymous referees for many trenchant observations and useful sug gestions. 1. For India see Susan L.

The one article that raises the question is John Hay, "Along the River During Winter's First Snow: A Tenth-Century Handscroll and Early Chinese Narrative," Burlington Magazine 114(830) (May I972):292~303. Hay proposed three categories of narrative illustration?moral, literary, and genre narrative?but they are characterized by inconsistent criteria involving both content and form, rather than being defined by a uni form standard. 4. Among the examples of narrative representation given in a recent publication are the following: bronze vessels with hunting scenes, tomb tiles with repeated stamped designs, a painting of a horse whose name is inscribed, paintings of the activities of anonymous palace women and children, an idealized group portrait of Tang scholars in a garden, a cav alcade of figures traveling through the mountains, a mounted warrior shooting a stag, bust portraits of men identified in accompanying in scriptions, and a scroll containing a painting and transcription for each chapter of the Classic of Filial Piety, see Wen Fong, Beyond Representation: Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, 8th-i4th Centuries (New York: Metro politan Museum of Art, 1992), chap. 1. 5. See Sheldon Hsiao-peng Lu, From Historicity to Fictionality: The Chinese Poetics of Narrative (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994), especially chap. 1. Also useful are several essays in Andrew Plaks (ed.), Chinese Narrative: Critical and Theoretical Essays (Princeton: Princeton Uni versity Press, 1977). 6. Particularly useful among many important publications are W. J. T. Mitchell (ed.), On Narrative (Chicago and London: University of Chi cago Press, 1981); idem, Picture Theory: Essays on Verbal and Visual Representation (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994); Hayden V. White, The Content of the Form: Narrative Discourse and Historical Repre sentation (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987); and Robert Scholes and Robert Kellogg (eds.), The Nature of Narrative (New York: Oxford University Press, 1966). 7. For example, Jin Weinuo, "Fo bensheng tu xingshi de yanbian" ("The Evolution of the Form ofJ?taka Illustrations"), in idem, Zhongguo meishu shi lunji (Collected Essays on the History of Chinese Art) (Taibei: Mingwen shuju, 1984), pp. 389-396; and Yu Xi,a? "Cong 'Weimojie jing bian' kan Dunhuang yishu di yuantou" ("Looking at the Source of Dunhuang's Art from Transformations of the Vimalakfrti Sutra"), Duoyun 27(4) (October 19905:72?76. I discovered just how deeply en trenched this view is when my abstract for the 1994 Dunhuang confer ence was translated into Chinese: a sentence in which I expressed doubt that the Chinese handscroll had influenced Dunhuang paintings was transformed into an assertion that it had. 8. Not all scholars have overlooked this evidence, though. Michael Sullivan has written, "This device [the technique of continuous, linear narration] appears to have come from India with the introduction of Buddhism, for there is no evidence of it in Han art." The Arts of China, 3rd ed. (Berkeley and London: University of California Press, 1984), p. 91. 9. Numerous handscrolls (Juan) that contained some kind of un specified illustrative matter (tu: charts, diagrams, tables, or pictures) are listed in the treatise on arts and letters in Ban Gu,ac Han shu*?- (Book of Han), Beijing University annotated edition (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1962), juan 30, yiwenzhiae 10. However, such scrolls appear only in the sections that itemize works on military strategy, weaponry, battle array, martial arts, and yinyanga* techniques. To the extent that a given scroll contained pictures, as opposed to diagrams or charts, it is likely that these were pictorial inventories of implements and techniques and resembled catalogue illustrations. 10. Kurt Weitzmann, Illustrations in Roll and Codex, Studies in Manu script Illumination 2 (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1970), chap. 1. 11. Even for ancient European art, however, Weitzmann's model does not necessarily work. Warren Moon vividly demonstrates its inad equacy in "Nudity and Narrative: Observations on the Synagogue Paintings from Dura Europos," in Warren C. Moon (ed.), Polykleitos, the Doryphoros, and Tradition (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1995), pp. 283-316. 12. Wu Hung has proposed that four Late Eastern Han stone reliefs that depict different scenes of an ape tale were selected from a larger cy 28</page><page sequence="13">ele of narrative illustrations; see "Pictorial Representations of Ape Tales," T'oung Pao, ser. 2, vol. 73(1-3X1987), pp. 90-91. The story con cerns an ape that abducted and cohabited with human females, until it was hunted down and killed by aggrieved men. Several episodes could be taken as climactic or characteristic of the tale, and it is possible that the four pictures represent different conceptions of the story, rather than excerpts from a larger set of illustrations. 13. Here I follow Dehejia's terminology (as in note 1), esp. pp. 384-385. Weitzmann (as in note 10) includes scenes of this type in his "simultaneous" narrative category, reserving the term "conflated" nar rative to mean the combination of several scenes from a larger cycle into one picture; see Illustrations in Roll and Codex, pp. 13-14 and 24-25. Since writing the present article, I have read Wu Hung's important study of the Lady Dai banner found at Mawangdui (see note 2). Wu contends that the banner should not be interpreted as representing the soul's journey to heaven, because that identification assumes "a concept of sequential narrative representation that is absent in early Han pictor ial art" (p. 126), a view that concurs with mine. 14.

See Chen (as in note 14), pp. 120-122; references to other schol ars' interpretations are given in her footnote 124. For further discussion of continuous narrative, see the section "Modes of Extended Narrative Illustration" in this article. 16. Pre-Buddhist illustration is preserved in paintings and incised or impressed slabs from tombs, and in incised-stone pictures from offering shrines; for some representative examples, see Alexander C. Soper, "All the World's a Stage: A Note," Artibus Asiae 3o(i968):25i-253. A few documentary sources also mention specific paintings. The largest num ber of relevant titles appear in two Tang compendia: Pei Xiaoyuan,a8 Zhenguan gong si hua 5/zP1 (A History of Public and Private Painting in the Zhenguan Era), in Yu Anlan (ed.), Huapin congshu (Compendium of Books on Painting) (Shanghai: Renmin meishu chuban she, 1982), pp. 29-43; and Zhang Yanyuan, Lidai ming hua jin (Record of Famous Paintings of Various Dynasties), completed in 847, reprinted in Yu Anlan (ed.), Huashi congshu (Compendium of Books on the History of Painting) (Shanghai: Renmin meishu chubanshe, 1963), v. 1, juan 3, pp. 53?57. 17. Wang Su (comp.), Kongzi jia yu (Family Sayings of Confucius) (reprint edition, Taibei: Shijie shuju, 1962), juan 3, p. 25. Confucius's belief that visual images were morally inspiring is also to be discerned in his late-life lament that he no longer dreamed of his hero, the Duke of ZhouaJ (1 ith century b.c.), the sagely regent for the son of the Zhou dy nastic founder. 18. The Lingguangdian fu is partially translated and discussed by Wu Hung, The Wu Liang Shrine, pp. 73?74; see pp. 192?193 for discussion of and references to other sources. 19.

It is worth noting that although Liu Xiang's accounts are often termed biographical, in fact they were highly constructed; the nar ratives of the women's lives were molded to fit iconographical expecta tions of the category to which Liu had assigned them. Men's biographies were subject to similar construction, particularly in the dynastic histories, where biographical data were selected and shaped to fit the category that the historians judged most suitable. 21. Wu Hung, The Wu Liang Shrine, provides a exhaustive recent study of these and related tablets. It should be kept in mind that narra tive representations on the walls of a funerary shrine served somewhat different purposes than did pictures encountered in daily life. 22. The five-panel screen is most fully reproduced and discussed in the excavation report; see "Shanxi Datong Shijiazhai Bei Wei Sima Jinlong mu" ("The Tomb of Sima Jinlong of the Northern Wei at Shijiazhai, Datong, Shanxi"), Wenwu 1972(3) (March i972):20~33, 64. For a partial reproduction and useful information in English, see Jan Fontein and T'ung Wu, Unearthing China's Past (Boston: Museum of Fine Arts, 1973), pp. 217-218. 23. Wu Hung, The Wu Liang Shrine, pp. 262?264. 24. The purposes of funerary art are extensively discussed in the schol arship cited in note 2. It was generally believed in the Han period that the soul of the deceased separated into a poa* and a hunam at death, and the po remained in the tomb and the hun ascended into heaven. The tomb was meant to provide an agreeable dwelling-place for the po, and the offering shrine served as the temporary lodging for the hun when it descended to accept sacrifices. Although recent research by both Thompson and Fisher (see note 2) indicates that these beliefs were sub ject to variation, the concept of creating congenial environments re mains valid. 25. Victor Mair has argued more extensively that such relationships between pictorial and oral narration have Indian origins, as does the prose-and-verse form of the bianwenan (transformation texts) that were ancestral to later Chinese fiction and drama; see Painting and Performance (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1988). 26. Madeleine Hallade, Gandharan Art of Northern India (New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1968), pp. 103-107. Several slabs surviving from a st?pa complex at Amar?vat? depict st?pas with inset narrative panels; see Robert Knox, Amaravati: Buddhist Sculpture from the Great Stupa (London: Trustees of the British Museum, 1992), esp. pis. 68?78. 27. Only a few such portable shrines seem to have survived, and which, though undated, are usually assigned to the fifth through eighth centuries; for example, see Martin Lerner, The Flame and the Lotus (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1984), cat. no. 10. Similar objects probably were used by earlier generations. 28. Dehejia (see note 1) has also grappled with this problem of termi nology, but I find her term, "linear narrative," insufficiently precise to distinguish the category from modes of illustration in which successive scenes are not separated from one another. 29. See also the discussion by Dehejia (as in note 1), p. 385. 30. Mair, Painting and Performance, chap. 1; also Dehejia (as in note 1), PP- 377-378. 31.

The connection between the spiraling flourishes and picture scrolls was also made by Benjamin Rowland, The Art and Architecture of India, 3rd rev. ed. (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books Ltd., 1967), P. 59 32. It would also be possible to argue that the end flourishes derive from formal traditions of ornament and do not in themselves signify any thing. This interpretation is favored by the fact that spirals flank each ar chitrave, whether or not it depicts a continuous narrative. 33.

Abe (as in note 1) offers a useful in-depth study of cave 254. 29</page><page sequence="14">36. For conflated narrative, see section above, "Modes of Narrative Representation in Ancient China" in this article, and also note I. Dehejia's discussion makes it clear that the figure of the protagonist ap pears just once, but auxiliary figures may be repeated within the com position. 37. Shih in note 1 interprets The Attack of Mara as the culminating nar rative in the cave, whose program she characterizes as instructing the monastic community on spiritual cultivation and discipline. 38. Dehejia, "Modes of Visual Narrative," pp. 382-384. Weitzmann does not discuss illustrations of this type. 39. For details of the story and discussion of the mural as the begin ning of the program of spiritual cultivation, see Hsio-yen Shih (as in note 1), pp. 62-63; a somewhat different analysis is given by Pao-chen Chen (as in note 14), pp. 132-135. 40. See Jin Weinuo (as in note 7), p. 393. 41. This argument is made by Pao-chen Chen (see note 14), pp. 139-140. 42. The Sudh?na j?taka is reproduced in Ch?goku sekkutsu: Tonkd Bakukd kutsu, vol. 1, pi. 168. The direction of reading is also opposite from that of the Mah?sattva j?taka: from left to right across the top reg ister, from right to left across the middle, and left to right along the bot tom. The two j?takas of altruistic self-sacrifice are thus perfectly com plementary, visually as well as conceptually. 43. In her discussion of the illustration of the Deer King j?taka in cave 257, Pao-chen Chen (as in note 14, pp. 137-140) links the side-side middle compositional layout with India; as a case in point, she notes that in cave 10 at Ajant?, scenes illustrating the Sy?ma j?taka are arranged 2 3-1. Hsio-yen Shih (as in note 1, p. 63) suggests that the composition is structured to stress the distinction between good and evil karma. 44. Here I am inspired by Wu Hung's insights into the organizational logic of large Tang and Five Dynasties murals on the theme of the con test of powers between Raudraks? and S?riputra; see "What is Bian xiang?: On the Relationship between Dunhuang Art and Dunhuang Literature," Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 52(1) (June I992):in-I92, esp. pp. 146-153. 45.

Another useful general discussion is Du Jiwen, "The Multi-Ethnic Character of Chinese Buddhism and the Characteristics of Its Various Schools," translated by Chen Guansheng, Social Sciences in China 15(1) (Spring I994):i47~i7i. 47. Recent critiques of essentialist thinking make it all the more ur gent to be cautious about what "Chinese" means. Some relevant dis cussion is given in Dru C.

As evidence, he cites Zhang Yanyuan's biography of the Liu Song painter Yuan QianaP; see Lidai ming huaji (as in note 16), juan 6, p. 81. 49. Hironobu Kohara has argued that the Chinese maintained a pref erence for monoscenic illustration in later times, which he contrasts with a Japanese preference for more discursive pictorial narration; see "Narrative Illustration in the Handscroll Format," in Alfreda Murck and Wen C. Fong (eds.), Words and Images: Chinese Poetry, Calligraphy, and Painting (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1991), pp. 247-266. 50.

In her extensive analysis of the lost prototype reflected in numer ous extant copies of the Luoshen tu,^ Pao-chen Chen proposes a mid to late sixth-century date for the creation of the original scroll and re futes the Song attribution to Gu Kaizhi. More specifically, she suggests that the master version was created between 557 and 589 in Nanking, the capital of the southern kingdom of Chen. Her argument is based on an examination of the compositional structures and narrative techniques, which she finds comparable to several fifth- and sixth-century caves at Dunhuang. See Chen (as in note 14), chap. 3. 54. See Wu Hung, "Art in Ritual Context" and "Beyond the 'Great Boundary.'" In the latter study Wu argues that such tomb decoration does convey a narrative. 30</page><page sequence="15">Chinese Characters b. $jjfr d. a^-f e. i&amp; -sr g- f %*&amp;&amp;, i- #i j- fei k. ft p.
