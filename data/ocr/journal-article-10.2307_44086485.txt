<plain_text><page sequence="1">William W. Stowe "A Minister of Happiness": Nature in Beecher 's America Henry Ward Beecher is remembered today as an emblematic figure in nineteenth-century American cultural history. Son of a stern Calvinist preacher in Litchfield, Connecticut, he became the genial and char- ismatic pastor of a fashionable congregation in Brooklyn, New York. Brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, he cautiously opposed both slavery and radical abolitionism. One of the leading churchmen of his day, he was also involved in one of its most notorious sex scandals, details of which were flashed around the country by telegraph and printed in the daily papers. Scholars have shown that Beecher helped justify the privileges of a comfortable, white, native-born, urban middle class by providing mid-century Americans with a liberalized, relatively un- demanding form of Protestantism that reconciled their pleasures and material possessions with the religious beliefs they inherited from their forebears.1 1 want to add that he encouraged the new urban culture to take a new kind of pleasure in nature. Although his work does not appear in anthologies of nature writ- ing2 and he is rarely mentioned in works of ecocriticism,3 Beecher wrote extensively about the natural world. His articles and essays on gardening, farming, fishing, the outdoor life, and country leisure appeared in agricultural journals and widely-circulated newspapers. His popular sermons abound in descriptions of the natural world and accounts of the spiritual lessons it can teach. His only novel, Norwood , tells the story of a man whose love of nature leads him to earthly ful- fillment and religious salvation and contains extensive discussions of the importance of nature in social and spiritual life. He was not a serious student of Emerson or Thoreau,4 but his essays, sermons, and fiction share the palpable pleasure and the spiritual inspiration that the Transcendentalists experienced in nature. They also evince a Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 13.1 (Winter 2006) Copyright © 2006 by the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment</page><page sequence="2">46 ISLE sentimental materialism that recalls two more direct appropriators of Concord romanticism, Andrew Jackson Downing, the great American apostle of the picturesque, and Frederick Law Olmsted, the landscape designer who believed that contact with nature would raise the moral tone of his fellow citizens.5 Taken together, they invite readers to as- sociate the experience of nature with physical and aesthetic pleasure, religious and moral inspiration, and the kind of honorific consumption of goods and services that was becoming the hallmark of the urban middle class in mid-century America. Like many of his parishioners and friends, Beecher grew up in a country village in the early years of the nineteenth century.6 As a child he roamed the woods and fields. "I knew where the sweet-flag was," he reported, "where the hickory-trees were, where the chestnut-trees, where the sassafras-trees were, where the squirrels were, where all things were that boys enterprise after"(Beecher and Scoville 59). As a small boy, confined to the "Miltonie depth" (52) of the district school- room through the bright days of summer, he longed for the freedom he associated with the natural world. "The woods were full of temptations, the trees called me, the birds wanted me, the brooks sang entreaties. It seemed cruel to be shut up. The brooks, birds, flowers, sunshine, and breezes were free; why not I ?" (53). He associated nature with adven- ture, discovery, freedom, pleasing sights and sounds and sensations. It also spoke to him of God, and helped him relate religion to the joyful pleasures of the natural world rather than the cold confinement of the meetinghouse. "The first distinct religious feelings I had," he writes, were connected with nature. Although I was born, as far as any one can be born so, a Calvinist, yet, as I look back, I see that the only religious feelings or impressions I had were those which were excited in my mind through the unconscious influence of God through nature. It was not until years later that I knew it was the divine element. (77) Even as a child, moreover, Beecher's love of wild and free nature did not exclude more cultivated pleasures. As a student at Mount Pleasant Academy in Amherst he planted a flower garden. There, as a school- mate later reported, "the chaplain of Mount Pleasant Institute found him one day lost in admiration for the opening buds and beautiful blossoms." "These things are pretty, very pretty/" said the chaplain, '"but do you think that such things are worthy to occupy the attention of a man who has an immortal soul?'" Beecher's immediate reply has not been recorded, but he later remarked that '"since Almighty God had taken time to make these trifles it did not seem amiss for [me] to take time to look at them'" (96).</page><page sequence="3">"A Minister of Happiness" 47 Beecher's pleasure in gardening persisted throughout his life. As a busy young minister in Indiana, he found time to raise vegetables, fruit, and flowers.7 One of his earliest parishioners reported that "'[h]e loved to work among his flowers, and could call every flower by its name readily. I think he loved his flowers and took more pleasure with them than anything else, excepting his family'" (199). After he had returned to the East and taken up residence in Brooklyn, he became a gentleman farmer, first in the Berkshires and then at Peekskill on the Hudson River, where he developed a large property, planting "between two and three thousand trees and vines" and a wide variety of vegetables and flowers (623). The best evidence for the breadth of Beecher's horticultural knowl- edge and the first signs of his lifelong tendency to associate gardening and morality can be found in the articles he wrote as editor of the Indiana Farmer and Gardener, a journal he founded in 1845 and main- tained almost single-handedly until he left Indianapolis for Brooklyn in 1847. Beecher's contributions, many of which were later collected in a 420-page octavo volume called Pleasant Talk About Fruits , Flowers, and Farming, include almanac-style recommendations on seasonal tasks, scientific disquisitions on such subjects as manuring, sexual difference in strawberries, and the advantages of competing varieties of peaches, apples, and pears, impassioned advocacy of deep plowing, and advice on how to keep houseplants free of aphids. Oddly, perhaps, for the work of a young minister, they have almost no religious content. They are full, however, of a kind of secular moral- izing that reflect the habits of the preacher, and that Lawrence Buell has called "homiletic naturism" (402). The editor's "creed," for example, makes no mention of God, but begins "We believe in small farms and thorough cultivation" and moves eventually to "We believe in a clean kitchen, a neat wife in it, a spinning-piano, a clean cupboard, a clean dairy, and a clean conscience" (Pleasant Talk 10-11). A column called "Plain and Pleasant Talk" urges the reader not to be "tempted by fine weather to haul out manure," goes on to suggest that spring is a good time to "look to your fences" and "overhaul your plows," and then asks, "While you are moving about and repairing holes in the fence, putting on a rail here, a stake yonder, a rider in another place, you may enquire of yourself whether your character is not in need of some repairs?"8 The column goes on to suggest hard work, temperance, the avoidance of debt, and, just incidentally, the value of the Indiana Farmer and Gardener for a well-managed farm home and economy. Beecher comes closest to actual sermonizing in a column that suggests the moral benefits that will accrue to young ladies who devote their time to "floriculture"</page><page sequence="4">48 ISLE rather than "reading 'Ladies books/ crying over novels, [and] writing in albums." "A love of flowers," the column concludes, would beget early rising, industry, habits of close observation, and of reading. It would incline the mind to notice natural phenomena, and to reason upon them. It would occupy the mind with pure thoughts, and inspire a sweet and gentle enthusiasm; maintain simplicity of taste; and, in connection with personal instruction, unfold in the heart an enlarged, unstraitened, ardent piety. (117-120) The connection between floriculture and piety may have seemed more natural to Beecher's contemporaries than it does to us9, but asserting it was perfectly consistent with Beecher's lifelong efforts to associate genteel pleasures with religious feelings and to integrate both with the burgeoning mid-nineteenth-century culture of consumption. If only "my ever-adored Matilda Euphrosyne" would spend her leisure and her money on her garden and her greenhouse rather than on fashion- able literature and meretricious "refinements," he suggests, she would be happier, healthier, and more religious (117-18). The association of the love of nature, the love of God, and the proper use of time and money is especially evident in the essays Beecher con- tributed in the early 1850s to the Independent , an influential Protestant weekly, and collected in a volume called Star Papers . Here, along with comments on current events, religion, morality, and social customs, he published sketches of nature and the country life as he enjoyed them on his summer escapes from Brooklyn to the hills of northern Con- necticut and western Massachusetts. While emphasizing the respectable pleasures of the rural vacation, the joys of a comfortable communion with nature, and the spiritual benefits to be acquired through the contemplation of God's handiwork, these essays also promote the pur- chase of country properties and travel services and support the desire to think of this kind of consumption as not just respectable but highly advisable for the physical, mental, and spiritual health of prosperous city-dwellers.10 Sensory and aesthetic pleasures were an important part of Beecher's experience of nature. On arriving at his summer house in Salisbury, Connecticut, in August, 1853, he wrote: Once more we find ourselves at home among lucid green trees, among hills and mountains, with lakes and brooks on every side, and country roads threading their way in curious circuits among them. [. . .] Here, then, for a few weeks we shall forget the city and lay aside its excite- ments, and bathe with a perpetual lavation in the bright, cool mountain air. (Star Papers , 137; 143)</page><page sequence="5">" A Minister of Happiness" 49 The natural world is for him a site for relaxation and the cultivation of "impressions": Hours pass lightly away while you sit at your window, looking at everything and at nothing,- a passive recipient of all the impressions which the great out-of-doors can make on you. Let me recount a half- hour's sights. It is a very beautiful day. The sun is warm but the air is cool. Some very dreamy clouds are drifting about without any will of their own, and with no settled purpose. (139) Such luxurious idleness might raise the spectre of wicked self- indulgence, but Beecher makes it clear that rural relaxation is also morally and spiritually improving. New England farms are not just picturesque, they are monuments to the farmers' character. "A highly cultivated farm is always an object of beauty; but in the rocky parts of New England a fine farm has a moral beauty; it is an enduring mark and measure of indomitable industry" (122). Contemplating nature's beauty is a way of making contact with its divine creator: And if one fully believes that the earth is the Lord's, and that God yet walks among leaves, and trees, in the cool of the day, he will not be easily persuaded to cast away the belief that all these vagaries and wild communings are but those of a child in his father's house, and that the secret springs of joy which they open are touched of God. (269-70) A walk in the woods can bring spiritual renewal and constitute a literal imitation of Christ: In this cool twilight, without a voice except of wind and waters, where all is primeval, solitary, and rudely beautiful, you seem to come out of yourself. Your life lifts itself up from its interior recesses, and comes forth. [. . .] It was in such places that Christ loved to stray. It was in such places that he spent nights in prayer. I never linger long in such scenes without a thought of his example, and a sympathetic understanding of why it should be so. (169-70) Beecher's leisurely contemplation of nature and his high-minded meditations on its meaning seem at first glance to cost nothing and be available to all. In fact, however, they are part and parcel of the culture of consumption that includes the exchange of money for time and the opportunity to enjoy literature, music, art, and nature.11 As participants in this culture, Beecher and his family enjoyed such material and cul- tural goods as comfortable houses, domestic service, books, pictures, free time, travel, scenery, and rural vacations. Beecher also encouraged his readers to become, like him, consumers of the natural world, urg-</page><page sequence="6">50 ISLE ing, for example, "those who can command leisure in September or October [. . .] to make a tour through the mountain country of western Connecticut and Massachusetts" (175). Land was part of the consumer economy as well, of course, and while Beecher was careful to disclaim interest in vulgar material profits he clearly reveled in the joys of ownership. "I am free to confess," he wrote, "that the value of a farm is not chiefly in its crops of cereal grain, its orchards of fruit, and in its herds; but in those larger and more easily reaped harvests of associations, fancies, and dreamy broodings which it begets" (263). Still, he took pride in possession. Looking out over his Berkshire farm, he exclaimed, "And all this is mine! These rocks, that lie in bulk under the pasture-trees, and all this moss that loves to nestle in its crevices, and clasp the invisible projections with its little clinging hands, and all these ferns and sumach [sic], these springs and trickling issues, are mine!" (265). The first statement reminds us of Emerson, who declared in Nature that the landscape could only be "owned" by the poet (9), and Thoreau, who said in Waiden (which was published only the day before Beecher's article appeared) that he had "often seen a poet withdraw, having enjoyed the most valuable part of a farm, while the crusty farmer supposed that he had got a few wild apples only" (388). The second, however, brings us back to the more literal-minded purchasers of country properties who were Beecher's parishioners and readers. In Nature , Emerson challenged a new genera- tion of radical American thinkers to forge their own "original relation with the universe" (7). In Waiden , Thoreau was urging his readers to "live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life" (394). In Star Papers , Beecher offers the luxury of a high-minded saunter from pleas- ant impressions to pleasant ideas, all guaranteed by the comfortable immanence of the divine. Rather than challenging his readers to build new worlds, he invites them to enjoy the one they have been given, to disport themselves in nature with all the security and familiarity of a child in its father's house. This difference can also be seen in Beecher's sermons, where the evocation of nature often leads not to awe or exaltation or Emersonian reasoning but to a comforting sense that God is in his heaven and his earth, and that if all is not right with the world just now, it will be soon. So a talk entitled "The Lilies of the Field" transforms Emerson's assertion that nature "always speaks of Spirit" and "suggests the ab- solute" into a feel-good claim that man can read "messages" of God's "munificence" in the natural world.12 So a war-time sermon on Song of Solomon ii, 11-13 ("For lo, the winter is past . . .") entitled "Spring-Time in Nature and in Experience" moves from literal evocations of spring</page><page sequence="7">"A Minister of Happiness" 51 to assurances of renewal, redemption, and victory on the battlefield and in the soul.13 But of course Beecher's essays and sermons were not written for New England intellectuals eager to experiment with new ways of think- ing and being in the world but for an established class of nominally orthodox bourgeois Protestants who asked only to be reassured that their enjoyment of the natural world was genteel, refined, and good for their souls. While the version of Transcendentalism that he all unwit- tingly passed on to his readers lacked Emerson's rigor and Thoreau's suggestiveness, it helped convey his strong belief in the beauty and the value of the natural world to a large and powerful constituency of the ascendant urban middle class. This belief is most explicitly and thoroughly conveyed in Beecher's 1867 novel, Norwood , or Village Life in New England. A sprawling, untidy work, Norwood tells the story of Barton Cathcart, a farmer's son who leaves home for Amherst College, experiences an extended spiritual crisis, travels in the West, joins the Union army, is quickly promoted to general, fights, is wounded, gains religious insight, and marries. His bride is Rose Wentworth, daughter of the aristocratic village doctor who is Beecher's spokesman in the novel. Rose leaves her secure conven- tional life in the village to become a battlefield nurse. She, her father, and a family of Pennsylvania Quakers together save Barton's life when he is wounded, and the young couple reveal their love. Into this central story Beecher weaves temperance tales, anecdotes and characters from local-color fiction, appreciations of nature, disquisitions on the social responsibilities of the wealthy and educated, liberal definitions of the Christian life, promotional descriptions of New England as a site for healthy vacations, and a well-intentioned but deeply racist account of a simple-minded black servant. Reviews of the book were respectful and disappointed. No one thought much of Beecher's skills as a novelist, but most found some- thing to admire in his book, and many appreciated his depictions of nature. "If Mr. Beecher has failed in producing a good novel," wrote the Harper's New Monthly reviewer, "he has, at all events, produced a good book." "Every page abounds with those large utterances of truth and duty, those touches of humor and pathos, and that keen apprecia- tion of the beautiful in art and nature which have won for the pastor of the Plymouth Church the place which he so worthily holds in public esteem" (816). In the Atlantic , William Dean Howells criticized Beecher's command of his story but appreciated his depictions of Yankee char- acters, suggesting that "in this sort of nature Mr. Beecher is as little likely to err as in that of the woods and fields and the creatures which inhabit them, and which he loves so well" (764). In later years, Beecher</page><page sequence="8">52 ISLE himself deprecated his skills as a novelist, suggesting that he wrote Norwood as a way of quashing persistent rumors that he had been the secret author of his sister Harriet's masterpiece, Uncle Tom's Cabin ("Mr. Beecher's Remarks" 4). Beecher's critics have noted evidence in the novel of his devotion to nature and his promotion of liberal Protestantism. In Nature and the American, Hans Huth calls Norwood "a step on the right way toward es- tablishing sound relations between man and nature" (96). In his critical study of Beecher, William McLoughlin calls it "the first fully developed statement of liberal Protestantism to appear in popular form"(56) and the "death certificate" of orthodox Calvinism "for the rising middle class of the cities and suburbs which controlled the destiny of the na- tion" (83). I would further suggest that the book makes an important connection between the ideology of bourgeois Protestantism and the high-minded aesthetic and moralistic construction and consumption of the natural world. Beecher makes these connections in at least three different ways. First, he describes the natural world as a site of aesthetic experience and a tourist attraction, suggesting that nature is, among other things, a commodity available for purchase by vacationers and connoisseurs. Second, he uses Dr. Wentworth as a mouthpiece for his own views on the relations of nature, culture, morality, religion, and society, which together suggest that the experience of natural beauty ennobles the mind and elevates the soul. Third, he bases the central plot of his novel on the story of a young man who overcomes youthful skepticism by contact with nature. Beecher's descriptions of the Massachusetts countryside testify to his appreciation of its beauty, his familiarity with its woods and fields, and his recognition of its place in the economy of tourism and the aes- thetic consumption of rural scenes. Norwood's first chapter connects the appreciation of landscape with the newly popular practice of vacation travel. "Since the introduction of railways," it begins, "thousands of curious travelers every summer have thronged New England [. . .]" (1). "Scarcely any other excursion could be planned," Beecher goes on, which would so well fill a summer vacation, as one which, winding through the western portion of Connecticut, of Massachusetts, and of Vermont, reached a climax at St. Albans, on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain; a place in the midst of greater variety of scenic beauty than any other that I remember in America. (1-2) Throughout the book, he invites readers to appreciate the landscape as a work of art. Dr. Wentworth perceives the world around him with</page><page sequence="9">"A Minister of Happiness " 53 the eyes of both an amateur natural historian, familiar with various species of mosses, and a connoisseur of the picturesque: I was over yesterday at the ravine, and found an old tree-trunk, half decayed, on and around which was a garden such as no gardener could make. It lay on the edge of the wood; the stream of the brook had kept its mosses, of which I counted many species, in admirable health and color. Ah, it was like a trunk of emerald! Down on the south side, where the leaves had kept them warm all winter, were blood-root blossoms, white as snow, shooting up in squads, like white troopers mustering for some tournament; and at the upturned roots was a tangle of blackberry vines, as fine in lines as any thing that Raphael ever imitated from the ancients, and a great deal more beautiful. (15) Later on, the narrator's painterly description of a night-fishing scene recalls the chiaroscuro of Rembrandt or perhaps the stagey sublime of Salvator Rosa:14 And now I defy you, O painters, to render me in true form and color that scene- the wrinkle-faced river, ruddy and changeful- the overhanging boughs, up into whose obscure depths shoots a smoky, tremulous light- and the strange forms of men moving slowly along the water, bearing two maidens as sweet as ever dazzled the eyes of deluded mortals! (99) Another passage combines the aesthetic appreciation of a scene with some amateur ornithology, a celebration of domestic retirement, and a comment on the pleasures of the rural vacation. "The other day I got me to a solitary corner," the narrator tells us, "where pine-trees, maples and spruces had leagued against the sun, and quite expelled him" (188). He sits down quietly, observes the common birds and insects, watches a wood-thrush preen its feathers, and listens to its distinctive song, "neither warble nor continuous song, but a dainty phrasing, in single syllables, of such sweet and loving thoughts as solitude doth breed in pure and tender natures" (188). "[N]one in life sing so sweetly," he goes on, in a passage that reminds us of the contemporary valuation of domesticity and quiet "influence," "as they who, like the wood-thrush, sit on the twilight edge of solitude and sing to the men who pass by in the sunlight outside" (188). "It was this union of seclusion and pub- licity," he concludes, "that made Norwood a place of favorite resort, through the summer, of artists, of languid scholars and of persons of quiet tastes" (188). One could hardly wish for a more succinct example of Ann Douglas' ideas about the relations of middle-class women, cler- gymen, leisure, and the appreciation of nature, art, and poetry in the</page><page sequence="10">54 ISLE ante-bellum United States, and of the links of them all with consumer culture and rural tourism. Beecher develops and expounds his views about these connections through the character of Dr. Wentworth, the aristocratic, Vienna-trained physician who has given up prospects of a fashionable city practice to live in Norwood, "where he could be in daily and intimate converse with nature" (28). Dr. Wentworth is the figure of reason, kindness, and sensibility in the novel, an inspiration to his daughter, a voice of moderation in debates with the religious skeptic Judge Bacon and the orthodox Calvinist Dr. Buell, and a mentor to young Barton Cathcart. He encourages his daughter's love of nature by telling stories relat- ing human life to the cycles of the natural world. "The Anxious Leaf," for example, relates the glorious autumn color and eventual fall of the leaves to the great liberation that rewards work well done and a life well lived (108-9). "Coming and Going" tells of a pair of birds who build a nest, raise a family, lose two babies to a cat and a small boy, watch the others fly away forever, and themselves adapt to the changing seasons by flying south to "a land where there was no winter" (115). "Rose knew as well as her father," the narrator reports, "that leaves never talked" (109). Still, the stories had their effect: "The natural world stole in upon her with mute messages, and the feelings which woke in her bosom she attributed to nature, and the thoughts which started she deemed a revelation and an interpretation of truths that lay hidden in creation waiting for her" (109). One of her unsuccessful suitors reports that Wentworth "has brought Miss Rose up to feel that all of nature is, literally, but a way which God has of making known to us his feelings, tastes, and thoughts. [. . .] Others went to nature. She dwelt in it always" (223).15 Not surprisingly, given his culture's association of instinctual belief with women and abstract inquiry with men, Beecher's male charac- ters lack Rose's serene implicit conviction and must work to achieve an explicit understanding of the relations of God and nature. We can observe this process clearly in a conversation between Dr. Wentworth and Dr. Buell. Here Wentworth espouses a version of Kantian ideal- ism, asserting that the spirit of God inhabits the natural world, which can therefore reveal both the divine will and the divine personality.16 "[G]reat truths of the affections [...] flow from God [...] through the doings and appearances of what we call Nature," Wentworth claims (52). "I insist on a living, divine power in physical things," he goes on, and suggests further that "God's [. . .] taste unrolls every flower and [...] his feelings have an alphabetic expression in all natural forms, harmonies, colors, contrasts and affinities" (53-4). "[L]ilies," he adds, "were ordained to act a part in morals" (54). Dr. Buell can't see it. He</page><page sequence="11">" A Minister of Happiness " 55 can "perceive in plants a relation to matter, to my senses, and to prac- tical uses," but he cannot understand them as preachers, teachers, or "moralists" (55). Went worth's argument, in Buell's view, "is poetic, but not philosophical" (57). Buell's problem, Wentworth argues, is that he lacks the faculty of imagination (56), relies too little on the "affections," "ideality," "taste and beauty," and as a result "worship [s] an abstract thought- a mere projection of an idea- not a whole Mind, a Living Be- ing !" (58). Nature, for Wentworth, consists not of "mere phenomena," but of "God's phenomena, meant to convey something deeper than the body catches, something for the soul" (59). He feels "a positive relation" with "every living thing"- "a spice bush, a clump of wild azaleas [...] the crickets, the field mice [...] the worm"- and thinks of them all as parts of "God's family and mine" (60). Such a relation, he believes, is not just consonant with but required by the Bible. "Do you believe the Scriptures?" he asks Dr. Buell. "Do you believe that those very heav- ens above your head declare the glory of God; or only that they did, four thousand years ago?" (59). Poor limited Buell is allowed no reply. Blinded by his "clear logical intellect," he "walk[s] slowly homeward, as one who saw nothing but his own thoughts" (60). It is clear from this passage that Dr. Buell is a cardboard figure whose primary purpose in the novel is to provide an occasion for Dr. Wentworth to express his theological opinions in clear straightforward terms. While Beecher was not an accomplished writer of fiction, he was, however, an effective rhetorician who understood the importance of embodying ideas in concrete narratives as well as abstract arguments. The story of Barton Cathcart shows the effect of Beecher's ideas in the religious life of a thinking, feeling person, a member of the rising gen- eration, whose faith is challenged by learning but ultimately confirmed by a direct emotional and aesthetic relation with nature. Like Beecher's other characters- and, to be fair, like most of the char- acters in sentimental fiction, as well as those of Balzac before him and William Dean Howells after- Cathcart is the material embodiment of an ideal historical type, the ambitious independent young mid-century New Englander. Born and raised on a farm, he is the first member of his family to leave the village, first for college, then to travel in the West, and finally as an officer in the Union army. Child of exemplary parents whose marriage is based on a rich combination of piety and romantic love,17 he falls deeply in love with Rose Wentworth, and nurtures his undeclared affection through separations and disappointments until the pair are finally united in another perfect marriage. Brought up in conventional piety, he moves from "acquiescent acceptance" to an "ea- ger questioning" of his parents views, and resolves, in a young man's</page><page sequence="12">56 ISLE fashion, "to open, investigate, and settle, one by one, the great truths of religion" for himself (266). The stories of Barton's love for Rose and his struggle to reconcile faith and "Reason" (266) are the twin narrative spines of the novel, as Barton feels he must settle his religious doubts before making any claim on Rose's affection. "I am separated by my miserable state from Rose," he writes in his journal. "She could never love me, could she see what a soul I bear. I would not deceive her if I could" (270). Not surprisingly, Barton is led back to religious faith by his belief in the sanctity of nature, the spiritual value of aesthetic experience, and the importance of the emotions. All three of these strands come together on the morning of Barton's graduation from Amherst when he joins Rose and her father atop the chapel tower to observe the sunrise. "Many men graduate from Am- herst," writes Beecher, an Amherst graduate himself, "without knowing that they leave behind them unseen one of the fairest sights that will ever bless their eyes- a sunrise from the chapel tower" (231). Barton is not one of them. He has been to the tower "scores of times" (232) and recounts the most striking of his experiences there in terms that combine aesthetic and religious with emotional intensity. The scene that burst on me was wonderful. The heavens seemed to be drenched with rose-color. All the west glowed with it. It ascended to the zenith. It seemed to pour over and down to the very horizon in the east. A slight haze, or rather scales of thick vapor filled the hemisphere, and these were saturated with rose-color. Gradually it changed to flame-color, and then the landscape was more wonderful still. Fearful, it was. It seemed to be like a universal conflagration. I thought of the language of prophecy, When the moon shall be turned to blood; and of that Great Day when the elements shall melt with fervent heat. The whole world stood in an unnatural trance, and the most familiar things looked wild and almost fearful. But the vision was of short duration. Suddenly, and while I was looking, the color was caught up again out of the air. Things resumed their common look, and the glory had left no effects behind. (233-34) Rose wonders if such an experience can really have had no effect on Barton, and he admits that while the physical effects of the sunset van- ished, its spiritual and emotional impact did not. "'It awakened all my mother in me!"' Barton declares, and then explains, "'My mother has the sense of infiniteness and mysteriousness more than any that I have known. Something of her spirit have I inherited" (234). Dr. Wentworth quickly reinforces Barton's response to the scene by declaring, "This is the true moral effect of the more impressive natural phenomena" and going on to explain how "a sense of God's presence in all nature</page><page sequence="13">"A Minister of Happiness" 57 cannot but inspire a more wholesome spirit than that which usually frets and weaves out the over-busy day" (234). While this passage illustrates Barton's susceptibility to the influ- ence of natural sublimity, it does not directly resolve his doubts. His ultimate religious conversion really begins several years later as he sits at a window by moonlight, despairing in his doubt, and suddenly lays himself open to God and learns the true religious significance of the natural world: I was inexpressibly sad. I seemed alone, helpless, unhappy. I invol- untarily called out, 'My God, why hast thou forsaken me?' What fol- lowed I can account for only as a phantasy. Or was it real? Is there still an inspiration? I did not think. It was seeing rather! The whole heaven seemed full of ineffable gentleness. [. . .] For the first time in my life I had a conception of infinite love. I had heard the words before. Now I had a sense of the thing itself. All my soul seemed urgent to utter itself and I could not speak a word! The psalms rushed before me in which trees, mountains, sun, moon, stars, all nature, were called upon to join in praising God. (272) As if this were not clear enough, Barton later recounts his conversion to Dr. Wentworth, and attributes it quite explicitly to his mentor's ideas about nature and religion. I am almost certain, Doctor, that but for your help I should have made shipwreck of my faith. I had come to a state in which nothing was true to me merely because the Bible said so; but when, under your help, I found the great truths of the Bible indicated and corroborated in Na- ture, I was wonderfully strengthened. Indeed, I consider it the turning point in my history. (375) In his vacation essays Beecher celebrated the physical and spiritual pleasures and benefits of time spent in close contact with the natural world. In Norwood he expounded and exemplified his ideas about na- ture, morality, and religion through his own descriptive writing, Dr. Wentworth's copious talk, and Barton Cathcart's life story. I want to argue that there is an important connection between these elements of Beecher's thought and the bourgeois ideology of consumption of which they are part. Beecher's critics have taken note of this mediation without explain- ing it. Clifford Clark and William McLoughlin pay considerable atten- tion both to his treatment of the natural world and to his importance as a promoter of certain social, cultural, and religious trends surround- ing the development of a prosperous urban bourgeoisie in the mid- nineteenth-century United States, but neither develops a compelling</page><page sequence="14">58 ISLE theory to explain the connections between the bourgeois consumption of nature and the ideology of liberal Protestantism. The French critic Yves Lemeunier tries to do this in his two essays on Beecher, but he is impeded by his reliance on a theory of emulative motivation based on Veblen and Bourdieu. For him, Beecher and his fellow middle-class nature-lovers and rural vacationers are motivated by the desire to -per- form their social distinction. "The function of country life in Beecher is essentially social: people go to the country to constitute an elite and assert their own membership in it" (115). "Socially, the cult of flowers and trees is the sign of aristocratic refinement" (120). I have no doubt that one reason for taking a country vacation was to demonstrate one's pecuniary strength, in Veblen's phrase (68), and that another was to claim a modicum of that combination of refinement and social status that Bourdieu labels "distinction." For me, however, these motives can- not fully explain the close connections Beecher assumes and asserts between the pleasure of experiencing nature and the deep spiritual self-improvement that he believes it can produce. One of the features of evolving bourgeois society in the mid-nine- teenth century was the recovery of pleasure as a respectable goal of human activity and the recuperation of the aesthetic as a component of spiritual life. In his exploration of the connections between "hedo- nism," virtue, and consumption, Colin Campbell helps explain this phenomenon and its relation to Beecher's explicit association of nature and religion, arguing that the enabling motivation for modern con- sumption, including the consumption of intangible but commodified "goods" like nature, is aesthetic pleasure, which he opposes to mere physical satisfaction and associates with the praiseworthy cultiva- tion of a moral sensibility. For the Romantics, intellectual forebears of both Emerson and Beecher, "responsiveness to beauty thus became a crucial moral quality" and "one's reactions to the beauties of nature could serve as a measure" of one's moral character (152). As a result, the enjoyment of beauty became a moral imperative and the right kinds of pleasure- including especially those associated with nature- were seen as morally improving. Indeed, individuals have the right to experience pleasure in this form [. . .] because it is the defining attribute of all life, and of nature, pleasure being the "impulse from a vernal wood" which teaches us more of man and his moral being than "all the sages can." (191) Beecher makes a very similar claim in the "Star Paper" entitled "Nature A Minister of Happiness." "It is to be considered," he writes, "that God found a reason of pleasure in every individual thing which he has made, and that an education on our part, toward God in nature,</page><page sequence="15">"A Minister of Happiness " 59 consists in developing in ourselves a pleasure in every single object which exists about us" (308-9). When Beecher recommended country vacations to his parishioners and his clerical colleagues, therefore, he was not making the intellectual demands of an Emersonian relation to nature, but neither was he justifying mere self-indulgence or provid- ing a license to practice emulative consumption in Veblen's sense. He was, instead, advocating a combination of consumption, pleasure, and self-improvement that would become one of the bases of the modern consumer economy. "Romanticism," Campbell writes, "provided that philosophy of 'recreation' necessary for a dynamic consumerism: a philosophy which legitimates the search for pleasure as a good in itself" (201), which sees the experience of pleasure as a means of cultivating goodness. Beecher adapted this philosophy to the needs of prosperous urban Protestants, justifying their rural pleasures on the grounds of spiritual self-improvement. Some version of Beecher's high-minded Romantic hedonism con- tinues to justify leisure-time consumption of the natural world. Many modern nature-lovers still want to believe in the power of nature to stimulate humane feeling and encourage moral reflection. They may go to the woods to assert their pecuniary power and social distinction, as Veblen and Bourdieu would have it, but they like to think that they are also going, as Thoreau went, both to savor the beauties and pleasures of the natural world and to "live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life and see if we cannot learn what it has to teach" (394). The conflation of the enjoyment of nature with moral and spiritual self-improvement is not without problems, however. There is the very real possibility, first of all, which Beecher as a good Arnoldian18 never entertains, that there is no connection whatever between refined aes- thetic pleasure and moral behavior. There is the equally real possibil- ity that the refined pleasures of the elite, the houses, conservatories, gardens, parks and museums that they build and maintain, do not have any moral effect, for good or ill, on the lower classes. And there is, finally, the self-deception inherent in the assumption that since nature itself is presumably available for all to enjoy, the pleasures and benefits that it supplies are inherently democratic. These possibilities never cross Beecher's mind. In "Christian Lib- erty in the Uses of the Beautiful" he asserts the connection between the aesthetic and the moral in emphatic terms: "But in all your labors for the Beautiful, remember that its mission is not of corruption, nor of pride, nor of selfishness, but of benevolence!" ( 302). In a stunning passage in the same essay, he declares his trickle-down elitism with astonishing frankness. "Natural aristocracy is the eminence of men over their fellows, in real mind and soul. They are above men because</page><page sequence="16">60 ISLE they are wiser and better. [. . .] It is upon the same principle that men may become the benefactors of their race by the indulgence of beauty, and embellishments, if they be employed generously and public-spirit- edly" (297-98). In "Nature A Minister of Happiness," finally, he asserts that the enjoyment of nature depends not on wealth or privilege but on a properly appreciative attitude to the natural world. "[Ejvery one can find, but in different degrees, the food for all their faculties in that sphere into which God has cast their lot," Beecher piously intones (301), and then steps forth "on a glorious morning of a perfect day"(302) to make the most of the simple pleasures of his summer retreat in the Berkshires. His joys, he claims, are perfectly democratic: It is not any thing that I own, it is no stroke of grand fortune, no special success, that rejoices me. It is nothing but the influence of those things in which every man has common possession- days, nights, forests, mountains, atmosphere, universal and unmonopolized nature! (305) Those who fail to enjoy these things are like the skeptical disciples in the parable (Mark 8: 17-21): "But having eyes they will not see, and ears they will not hear, and a heart they will not understand" (305). Beecher's Bible-quoting disingenuousness is stunning: his apparent blindness to his own privilege seems at least as willful as the apostles' failure to understand the miracle of the loaves and the fishes. Beecher loved nature his whole life long. Along with other advocates of outdoor leisure- one thinks of William H. H. ("Adirondack") Murray, the clergyman and popular lecturer, E. L. Godkin, the founder of The Nation , and Theodore Roosevelt, for example- he taught increasingly urban Americans to value the natural world. His writings helped lay the foundations for popular, recreation-based twentieth-century en- vironmentalism. Reading Beecher today can help us understand the appeal of this movement, its historical sources, some of its ideological weaknesses as well, while reminding us of the importance of the nine- teenth-century experience and conceptualization of the natural world for bourgeois, which is to say dominant, American culture.

Recent collections in which he does not appear include John Elder's Nature Writing: The Tradition in English (2002) and Michael Branch's Reading the Roots: American Nature Writing before Waiden (2004). 3. He is not mentioned in the two standard histories of American nature writing, Thomas Lyon's This Incomparable Land and Don Scheese's Nature Writing. He is not among the seventy writers discussed in the two volumes of Elder's American Nature Writers. Hans Huth and Lawrence Buell are the honorable exceptions to this neglect. My interest in Beecher was sparked by two mentions in Huth's Nature and the American, pp. 97, 127, and a couple of sentences on his journalism and his contributions to natural history writing in the Appendix to Buell's The Environmental Imagination (402). 4. McLoughlin reports that "there is no sign of his having read the works of the seminal philosophers of transcendentalism in either England or America- no references to Coleridge or Carlyle, Emerson or Thoreau, Kant or Cousin" (57). 5. David Schuyler discusses Emerson's influence on Downing in Apostle of Taste, pp. 86, 122. Witold Rybczyński reports Olmsted's reading both Emerson and Downing in A Clearing in the Distance, p. 80.

Gilmore's analyses of this relation are well- known. See Feminization esp. Part One, and Gilmore's American Romanticism and the Marketplace, esp. Chapter One. Lori Merish extends their insights to the aestheticized landscape, which she sees as generating "a sense of imaginative possession of or entitlement to it" (Sentimental Materialism 305). 12. "The other tendency is to go from the material to the spiritual, thus spiritualizing the material. This is a process always of elevation. And as I sat and looked today at the meadows and at the trees, I thought within myself, 'What message have they of my God, and from my God?' And all day long I have felt that never was there such an interpretation of munificence; that never was there any thing that so indicated what it was to give without money and without price- to give out of a nature whose spontaneity is generous, profuse, magnificent." (Sermons 1, 185) 14. "I send words of cheer to those that are enduring hardships on the field of battle, and to those that are at home struggling with embarrassments and difficulties. [. . .] Wait a little; some more snows may fall, and there may be some more frosts; but the time of the singing of birds has come, and the voice of the</page><page sequence="18">62 ISLE turtle is heard in your affairs." (Sermons 1, 311) "We are all of us drawing near to the sweet spring of resurrection. Some have gone. My mother, my brother, my children, and my friends many, have gone before; but their voices come back and I hear them today. The time of the singing of birds is come. Our spring is not far away. Our summer is near." (I, 320) 15. On Salvator Rosa and the American sublime see Andrew Wilton, "The Sublime in the Old World and the New." 16. It is worth pausing for a moment on the details of this formulation. The passage assumes, first of all, a personal, anthropomorphic God, a masculine figure who uses nature to communicate "his feelings, tastes, and thoughts." It also embodies Beecher's patriarchal assumptions about child-rearing. Rose is clearly and explicitly her father's creation. Elsewhere we learn that while Mrs. Wentworth, a shadowy figure in the novel, gave her "a mother's love, strong and rich," and the housekeeper, Agate Bissell, "furnished the sterner elements," it was "her father's nature" that "tended to enlarge the sphere of her understanding, and of her spiritual nature" (163). 17. McLoughlin sums up the philosophical and theological issues succinctly: "Wentworth then launches into a popularized account of the new epistemol- ogy of Kantian idealism which Liberal Protestantism utilized to replace the realistic epistemology of Lockean and Scottish Common Sense philosophy. The heart of the new approach lay in the doctrine that God is present, immanent or indwelling, in Nature, and that the world of Nature is therefore essentially a world of spirit." (67) "Her every word was simple, every thought was truth, every feeling pure; and word, thought, and feeling moved gently upon him in an atmosphere of love. He worshipped God with reverence. He worshipped Rachel with love; he came to her as one comes to an altar or a shrine. He left her as one who has seen a vision of angels." (12) 18.
