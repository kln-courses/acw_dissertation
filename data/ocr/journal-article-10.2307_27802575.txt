<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Molestation of Skinny Boys Jackson Bliss Skinny Boys Even dressed in his favorite pair of once-starched khakis and batik polo shirt?the one with dancing stick figures on the breast pocket?it still only took two stutter steps on the charred runway of Dakar's international airport before Jean-Boy vowed never to leave New York again. Senegal smelled like pungent soil and burning plastic. He could barely swallow the air was so hot, and his watch, a gift for his twenty-eighth birthday, was burning an arc in his wrist. As he looked down at his tapettes he realized the plastic soles were melting on the infernal tarmac, a transformation from fashionable hiking sandals to gooey puddles of rubber fondue. As Maman always said, ce monde, c'est d?licat. This world is tricky. By the time he made it inside the airport, there was a never-ending line of exhausted passengers in blue jeans and bou-bous coiling single file like a giant intestine. Jean Boy stood there, batting at imaginary mosquitoes as passengers crawled forward on invisible walkers, scraping the thin layers of the ground from the bottoms of their feet. There was no air-conditioning or ventilation inside. The air was trapped. Jean-Boy felt like one of those giant bugs you see inside vacuum-sealed jars, preserved in mysterious fluid and relegated to the shelves of Natural Science. It was like he'd become a specimen: why, for example, was he the only black guy sweating in the entire airport? When his turn came he felt delirious from the trapped air and the drumbeat of pounding rubber stamps. He handed his passport to the customs officer who smashed ARRIV?E on entry 22, handing it back without a word, his clean polished fingers triggering the air for the next passenger, his head cocked to the side like a gangster rap artist. Jean-Boy walked to the baggage claim and for one hour and twenty-one minutes, according to his new watch, he waited for absolutely nothing. This was his first lesson with African Time. He had finally made it to Senegal despite every protest coined by the family mint after returning to his father's roots, and already he was having thoughts of Coney Island in the summertime, thoughts of wandering through the fun house cracking jokes with his buddies as they walked down the boardwalk with a bag of sugar peanuts in his hand as girls in short shorts and roller skates buzzed by and giggled because their thighs were trained to be supple and majestic, because they knew he was watching them, admiring the developed muscle tone in the ambiguous thigh region made for crushing skinny boys who should know better than to stare like that. Jean-Boy is inside a taxi with his two medium-sized suitcases. He's amazed he didn't have to bribe anyone but sad he lost two hours to cultural relativism. ?What's the name of the hotel again? the driver asks. ?I don't speak Wolof, Monsieur, he says in French. ?Vous ?tes fran?ais? ?No, I am Senegalese. And it's the Hotel Divine. ?Smartass. Your French doesn't sound Senegalese. ?I wasn't born here. ?Where then? African American Rew'ew43.1 (Spring 2009):165-70 ? 2009 Jackson Bliss 165</page><page sequence="2">? ? a. ?So you're American. ?My father is Senegalese. ?And your mother? ?French. ?So what are you? ?I'm Senegalese-French. ?But you were born in America. ?Right. ?Doesn't that make you American? ?I guess so. ?So which is it? ?I don't know. I could never decide. The taxi driver switches to Wolof again: ?Being American is too difficult. ?What are you saying? Jean-Boy asks in English. ? It must be a pain in the ass to be you. ?I don't understand. ?And you smell like scorched rubber. ?Whatever, man. ?And you have teeth like a white girl. ?Ey Mec, whaddya saying? Jean-Boy asks in French. ? Surah. For good luck. ?Ah. And then silence, etched by polite resignation. Jean-Boy looks out the window. He notices statues of famous generals he's never heard of and squadrons of mopeds flanking the taxi. The driver gets pleasure from cutting them off. Jean-Boy watches several men give him and the driver the finger. ?You live in Dakar a long time? ?My whole life, Monsieur. You? ?My first day. ?Like a larva. Jean-Boy stares out the window. He can hear his papa's voice echoing in his head as the taxi leaves the outskirts of Dakar. You're not going to like it, Jean-Boy, he insisted, its hot and poor and everyone will ask you for a cadeau. But he'd just shrugged his shoulders. He didn't know what else to do. It was Maman who suggested he meet the other side of the family. If s important mon petit, she'd told him, this is yourfamily whether you like it or not. You don't choose them. You choose yourfiends. As his eyes skim the gray chalky waves in the distance, he wonders why the Adantic Ocean looks so out of place here. Why, instead of comforting him, does he feel passive despair as his heavy eyes focus on the flotsam bobbing in the polluted water? He knows the Atlantic isn't clean but seeing it dirty and mistreated is another thing altogether. Expectations: c'est d?licat. Jean-Boy opens the door and throws his suitcases on his double bed. He places his room key on the nightstand, sits down on the bed and flips the TV on. It's a French cartoon about a little mouse. He recognizes it immediately. He used to watch this show as a child. Maman would rent French cartoons from the New York library for him, his brother Linus, and ?toile, their precocious little sister. On Sunday afternoons, when Papa was on a business trip with one of his mistresses, their mom would come home with plastic grocery bags filled voluptuously with squishy mangoes and soft bananas, eggs, golden loaves of bread, stitched sausage links and half-gallon cartons of cold milk that made their brains freeze. She would make omelette sandwiches for them just the way they liked, suffocated in layers of Manchego cheese and spicy ketchup. She'd bring out plates of freshly gutted mango slices as they watched the adventures of Mimi the mouse as she saved her friend Ladybug from a terrible storm or danced in the kitchen with Cat and Elephant or built a nest with the Lark family. AFRICAN AMERICAN REVIEW</page><page sequence="3">Jean-Boy smiles. He sees something noble and charming about a small animal fretting to and fro to save a feather. It's so pointless it's beautiful, he thinks. Mimi runs after the feather. O? est la plume maintenant, Mimi? ?Get the feather, Mimi. You can do it. Mimi grabs the feather. But oh! What's happened? Mimi has lost the feather again. Le vent est tres fort. Jean-Boy watches Mimi run in circles, chasing the lighter-than-sunlight feather as the mischievous wind carries it along like the body of a stage diver. Jean-Boy laughs as he regresses. He finds the little mouse comforting. She is a cartoon mouse after all, French-speaking and anthropomorphic. He doesn't know why he finds these cartoons comforting. He just does. What Jean-Boy loves about Mimi is the way she goes through life without pain or suffering. Cartoons and furry animals are the true gods of America. They spend their idle lives sitting on invisible thrones, bored with their mass-produced immortality. Jean-Boy turns the volume up and steps into the shower. He scrubs his neck and cuticles at the vulnerable places where the dust is tenacious. Dust the color of clay jars and Chicago brick. Fresh African dust that sticks to his pores like children asking for a cadeau. Jean-Boy hears Mimi talking to the wind in the other room. In the shower, his skin looks discolored in the places where the dust clings or where he scrubbed out of desperation. His back is heavy with knotted muscle but at least he feels calm now that the transcontinental ceremony is over. He didn't even have to bribe someone to get his bags. Jean-Boy wants to sleep so badly now he is salivating on himself, drifting off to his childhood, slouching behind curtains of steam and denial. Mimi runs after the feather. O? est la plume maintenant, Mimi? The feather has disappeared. Jean-Boy towels off and puts on new boxers. Navy blue with fat yellow stars. He wonders how long Mimi can search for the parasailing feather before she gives up or is saved by a commercial break. He wonders whether he'll survive a summer in Senegal at the crest of la saison chaude, in the middle of the hot season, a few months before the fever is broken or pregnant clouds collide into each other like bumper cars crashing into walls of scrap metal. The Molesters The next morning, Jean-Boy thinks he's still in New York City as he lingers in starchy sheets that could have been used as sails in the Bermuda Race. Suddenly, he hears a knock at the door and he remembers. ?Mais c'est qui alors? He asks. ?Mon cousin, a voice says, it's me. Mamadou. ?Mama D o?? ?Mamadou. ?Who are you again? ?I'm your cousin. ?I've never heard of you. ?I'm sure you have. ?No, really I haven't. ?Well, I've heard of you and I'm here to pick you up. ?Pick me up? To go where? ?To Saint Louis. ?I'm not going there for two weeks. Silence. ?Hello? Did you hear me? ?Yes, mon cousin. At least come down then and say hi to the family. THE MOLESTATION OF SKINNY BOYS 167</page><page sequence="4">?Come back in ten minutes, please. ?We're parked in front. ?Fine. Jean-Boy pauses in front of the door skeptically, squinting through the eyehole until his heart is a calm thud. He slips into a new pair of cotton pants, flip-flops and a yellow pique polo shirt. He pulls out some CFA's and his favorite watch of an airplane circling the world on a second hand. The hour and minute hands are shaped like the North and South Cardinal Points. Right now, north is west and south is east. L??famille, as his mom calls them, is early and he's dying to explore Dakar all by himself. Besides, his back is a skyscraper of bowline knots, from the gluteus medius all the way up to the sternomastoid. But the worst thing of all, is that Jean-Boy can't find his Guccis. North is west and south is east. Everything feels fucked up when your body is sore and your eyes are exposed. Maman warned him, being with the family, c'est d?licat, but it took five seconds for Jean-Boy to realize that la famille is a bunch of molesters. Everyone wants to touch his skin and feel the texture of his stylish new clothes, which they say are "tr?s classe!' They paw his cheeks, harass him, they ask him an interminable list of questions about Linus and Etoile, questions about his beautiful white mom, her new job at the museum, questions about Tupac Shakur and Vin Diesel. They tell him he's skinny and looks like he hasn't eaten since birth. They ask him about his watch. Is that an airplane? Where's it going? Did he buy it in New York? Jean-Boy thinks about his mom, about the way her presence purified the kitchen, filling cold winter mornings with hot lentil soups and potato dumplings. How's his dad, they ask. They tell him they see his father's dull eyes and his long lashes that resemble the swishy wrists of young brides. They see their grandfather's nose: aquiline and distinguished, his nostrils pointing in opposite directions, making his face seem ambivalent. They tell him his French is good. He sounds like a gent. They say his body's too slender for a man's. Americans hate Muslims too. Jean-Boy needs to learn Wolof or Fulani if he ever plans on finding a suitable wife. They look at him and see his father. Of course, his father was married when he was twenty-eight. What's Jean-Boy waiting for? Does he have a girlfriend? Is it serious? Is she blonde? But that's how it is in America. Americans work. They're blond. They wait to get married. They fall in love. They live in condos. They invade countries to feel safe. They get divorced. They change jobs. They throw away brand new cars in the trash. Jean-Boy would have done anything to eat a slice of pizza right now, the kind with the cheese oozing off the sides as dark yellow grease droplets raced down white slopes of mozzarella like children on sleds, cushioned by Gemini paper plates. Twenty-eight's not that old though, they say. There's still plenty of time for him. There's still hope. A good wife will make a man out of his gangly frame, she'll know how to stuff his starving body with % sauce and spicy fried-fish heads, if he can keep'em down. Jean-Boy wished he were watching French cartoons, he wondered if Mimi got the feather or if she gave up, he wondered if she was still running in circles, talking to the wind, whether a commercial break could save him from his own family. A good wife will bring him dignity, they tell him, she'll anchor him to this dry earth and fill their empty home with screaming children. Solitude is for les fous, after all, for crazy people. Without warning, the wind lifts up particles off the ground like Noah throwing doves into the uncertain sky, tossing handfuls of dust in his face like wedding rice. Once you get married, mon cousin, you'll be a real man. Your life will be cemented, it'll help you thicken up those pencil legs of yours. Jean-Boy wipes the rust out of his eyes. He feels it stick to his cabaret lashes. He looks at his watch and squints again: North is Northwest and South is just South. New York feels like a coma, like an elaborate daydream on the other side of the world. Jean-Boy does everything he can to stop himself from screaming. 168 AFRICAN AMERICAN REVIEW</page><page sequence="5">The Symmetry of Tablespoons Jean-Boy is exhausted and his forehead is dripping like something out of an aero bics video. When his uncle Ahmed and his cousin Mamadou led him through the neighborhood like a handcuffed prisoner being frogmarched through Town Square, a group of shirtless children and murmuring Poular women surrounded him, their bodies resembling upside-down exclamation points and Baskerville ampersands. La famille introduced him to the chef de poste, the pr?fet, the chef de terre, some teachers at the crumbling college and the headmaster at the local Koranic school, the shopkeepers and the Sheikhs. Jean-Boy also met the tailor who offered him G?n?ral cigarettes, the secretary and a group of cadets at the Gendarmerie, the hardware store manager who tried to hand him a hammer, a caf? owner named Little Nicholas who gave him a tepid Fanta to drink. Then Jean-Boy met the commer?ants and the market women. They sold mangos, dried fish, Maurit?ni?n necklaces, indigo and white Hajji scarves, rolls of colorfulpagne fabric. Slowly he met the entire neighborhood, one handshake, one prolonged introduction, one head nod, one handwave, at a time. The whole family finally made it to his uncle's compound, resting on stools and squatting in the shade where the air was moist and cool underneath a grove of acacia trees. It was only then that his uncle Ahmed handed him a glass of tea?gunpowder green and a fistful of sugar. Now he wipes his forehead, feels the weight in his shirt, the weight of volume as sweat trickles down the sides of his stomach. The dust is overpowering his soft flesh and invading his cuticles again, his fingertips are orange like a radio active cumin, like a burnt dirt. He looks around and suddenly realizes he is the only person wearing a watch because he is the only man in Saint Louis who cares what time it is. He knows what it's like to live on the other side of the Atlantic and throw away whole meals into the trash and hide between the legs of white girls and beat a video game in an arcade with a dollar in change. Twice in one day. He is the only person in the village that knows how to use a microwave and envy the lives of French cartoons, stuffed animals and school children. He does not belong in his own African family because he feels sad and far away in their company, smothered inside their shelter of tree shade and dust spirits. outh Senegal is west and West Africa feels east. Jean-Boy takes a sip from his beer. He knows they must have figured it out by now. All it took was seeing a real latrine. He tried so hard to fight the urge before, shadow-boxing his primal callings. But after they served him peanut sauce and rice it was all over. That was all it took, just one single bowl and a single spicy fish head before he was sprinting to the latrine like an incontinent Olympian. It was a latrine, not a bathroom. Bathrooms were actual rooms. They had doors. They had locks and issues of People to skim through. It was a latrine?the polite word for hole in the ground?with an embarrasingly low wall. Squatting over the empty circle, his kneecaps popping in place, pulling his pants down his thighs in a flash of urgency?now his greatest joy became his greatest pain. The most basic animal procedure?shitting into a hole?had suddenly become the biathlon, a test of Jean-Boy's flexibility, balance, and of all things, marksmanship. Having to poop into a target with an audience was just too much: the mountains of aggregate shit from his in-laws, the gagging ammonia rising up from bowels of hell, the flies landing on his ass-cheeks, his body wobbling to the sides, the sound of his aunt Ang?lique laughing on the other side of that shoddy cement wall, the rustling of larvae below him as the sun's spotlight captured Jean-Boy in his most vulnerable yoga position. It was the only time in his life he emptied out his bowels while his face burned insatiably with shame. It was this experience of s elf-shrinkage, his first conscious moment of humility when he missed the mouth of hell, the hole of the latrine, and then that Macbeth clich? of washing his hands over and over again until THE MOLESTATION OF SKINNY BOYS 169</page><page sequence="6">they were a fleshy violent pink as he screamed for more well water that came in a plastic tea kettle, as he begged for a dry towel and a bar of soap and a clean pair of pants, his voice cracking with fear, asking pleading shouting from the other side of that flimsy wall. It was then and only then that he saw how small he really was. Life in West Africa, it's not d?licat, it's brutal. Belittling. Paralyzing. It was like the allegory of the Mobile Suit Gundam manga that Jean-Boy used to read in middle school: a little boy operating a large robotic shell, unable to control the joystick of his destiny anymore. /-A fter the great escape from the village, Dakar feels like Vegas. Jean-Boy feels bad, -Z. JLknows he should have told la famille he was leaving, knows it wasn't right to crawl through the gaping hole in the wall some villagers call a window and run down the road like a fugitive, his shadow magnified by the crashing sun. But he didn't want to look at them, not because they cared but because they would pretend not to. Jean-Boy's ego had been badly bruised by his intestines, leaving the redemption of the city. This beer. This caf?. The city lights. The billboards of sleekly dressed couples smoking Gauloise Blue cigarettes, the petrol-colored air, the metastasizing skyscrapers, French rap music blaring from distant balconies, Dakar feels like an apiary?a sanc tuary of dark bees. Jean-Boy feels little, for he's always been little, he's always been the lankiest student in his class and the thinnest boy in the Diop family, the only man who doesn't speak Wolof, the only person in his branched-out family who isn't married or studying to become a diplomat or an engineer. Still, he doesn't feel alone anymore, even with his size. It's the contagion of numbers, the buzz of large cities. Dakar is a citadel, protecting the ocean from dust particles. Dakar is an oasis, an electric apiary, shining like a great vending machine. Seven days later he is ready to come home. Ironically, the night he books his e ticket at a cybercaf?, he meets a woman name Marianne. She's half-French and half-Senegalese. She doesn't know what to call herself either. Her French is better than her Mandinka. She loves the city and toilets that flush hydraulically. She dreams of New York. She's just like him in so many ways. It's not that unusual, she tells him, but he thinks so. She imagines if he stayed, they'd start dating, they'd become insep arable and fall in love like a semicolon. But he needs to leave. It's about the principle now. And besides, semicolons have no principles: they want to satisfy every word, every clause, every sentence. Jean-Boy wishes she'd follow him across the Atlantic. He understands why she won't and doesn't hold it against her that she doesn't lie to him and pretend she'll meet up with him one glorious day. He isn't offended by her honesty and she's fine sleeping with him for one night. But part of him wants her to want more, even if it's impossible, especially because it's impossible. She forgives him for this contradiction and feels like he's already gone. And it's true, since Saint Louis he's been a Da Vinci silhouette claiming to be bone and muscle, an American pretending to be Senegalese, living in a luxury hotel like a hostage trapped inside his own mind. But that night, after his head spins again, she brings him back to Africa. South is west and north goes east. She kisses his cheek, then she gives him a wink and walks around the corner. ?Where are you going? ?Y arrive. Seconds later she returns on a moto and honks. ?Va monter, she says, pointing over her shoulder with her thumb. He jumps on the seat behind her and wraps his gaunt arms around her tight stomach. At the first intersection he notices their legs are both thin and symmetrical like tablespoons, if those things exist here. As she rips through winding streets, the wind blowing her braids in his face, lifting them up to the sky like an offering of shea butter. The colors of buildings become blurry. With speed, the whole city7 streaks, a slur of brake lights and semaphores. 170 AFRICAN AMERICAN REVIEW</page></plain_text>
