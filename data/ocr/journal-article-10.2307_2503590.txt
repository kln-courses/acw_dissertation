Putting the Latin American people at the center of the analysis, each chapter relates the events and institutions of the past to the social and cultural forms of the present. Duncan Green examines the ongoing economic crisis that blights the continent's development, as well as the terrible new threat of environmental desecration throughout the region. He describes the role of all the major players in Latin America's history and present: both those who have held power-colonizers and bankers, landlords and the military-and those who, through their social movements in the shantytowns and countryside, are struggling for a different vision of the future. $16.00 PB*83 75 paper When ordering by mail, please add $2.00 for the first book and 50? for each additional book.

It shows that there is no need for discord between the develop- ment of those who live in Amazonia and depend on it, and its preservation as a &lt; 4, natural legacy. ________________________ It introduces The Amazon - discussing the Myth surrounding it, the indigenous peoples, inhabitants and the prospec- tors of the area. It also offers its options for the future; it discusses strategies that could be utilized in developing the area and at the same time preserving one of natures gifts and suggests policy measures that should certainly raise the level of national and intemational consciousness.

The severe fiscal adjustments undertaken by some Latin American countries over the past three years have substantially reduced their public sectors' financial requirements and in some cases have even resulted in fiscal surpluses. As 1992 reached its midway point, most of these countries were in the process of recovering from the protracted crisis of the 1980s.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT THE MULTI-DISCIPLINARY INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL DEVOTED TO THE STUDYAND PROMOTION OF WORLD DEVELOPMENT Chairman of the Editorial Board: PAUL P. STREETEN Managing Editor: JANET L. CRASWELL, World Development, The American UJniversity, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016-8151, USA World Development is a multi-disciplinary monthly journal of development studies. It seeks to explore ways of improving standards of living, and the htiman condition generally, by examining potential solutions to problems such as: poverty, unemployment, malnutrition, disease, lack of shelter, environmental degradation, inadequate scientific and technological resources, trade and payments imbalances, international debt, gender and ethnic discrimination, militarism and civil conflict, and lack of popular participation in economic and political life. Contributions offer constructive ideas and analysis, and highlight the lessons to be learned from the experiences of different nations, societies, and economies. World Development recognizes 'development' as a process of change involving nations, economies, political alliances, institutions, groups, and individuals. Development processes occur in different ways and at all levels: inside the family, the firmn and the farm; locally, provincially, nationally, and globally. Our goal is to learn from one another, regardless of nation, culture, income, academic discipline profession or ideology. We hope to set a modest example of enduring global cooperation through maintaining an international dialogue and dismantling barriers to cornmunication. A Selection of Papers R.
