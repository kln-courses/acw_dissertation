<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SOUVENIR OF THE BLACK VIRGIN OF LE PUY By JOSEPH BRECK The stone sculpture1 illustrated in figure 3 forms part of the Michael Dreicer Collection, bequeathed to the Museum in 1922. It repre- sents the miraculous Black Virgin of Le Puy wearing one of the robes of honor in which, from the fifteenth century on, the venerable image was presented to the faithful. The Drei- cer copy, which may have been made for one of the many chapels or churches in the south and center of France dedicated to Notre-Dame du Puy, is a French sculpture of the early six- teenth century. Its relation to the Virgin of Le Puy, which was destroyed in the French Revo- lution, is clearly seen in the two woodcuts re- produced in figures I and 2.2 The former3 may be dated about I500; the latter4 is from a book published in 1523. The woodcuts show the image in the taber- nacle of silver-gilt given by Louis XI after his visit to Le Puy in 1476. Of this tabernacle, or chadaraita as it was called, our sculptor has re- tained only the shield with the arms of France from the front panel. If our sculpture and the two woodcuts are compared with a copper engraving5 made in I778, which shows the celebrated image with the robes of honor removed, it will be noted that the sculpture and the woodcuts depart in several respects from the original. In the 1778 engraving, the Virgin holds the Child with both her hands upon His knees, while the 1 Acc. no. 22.60.1o. Height, 261 inches. Originally painted.

Obviously, the authors of our sculpture and the 1523 print have drawn upon their imagination in repre- senting these details.

Nevertheless, the open crown shown in the 1523 print is not of uncommon occurrence. It is possible, even probable, that the image possessed more than one crown. On the other hand, it must be re- in type the twelfth-century sculptures of the Enthroned Virgin that still exist in Auvergne or are known to have come from this region. These hieraticVirgins, stiffly holding the Christ Child on their knees in a position of strict fron- tality, probably derive from a greatly venerated image, called the Majesty of Saint Mary, which FIG. 2...

On the basis of the I778 engraving, supple- mented by literary evidence, Dr. Olivier con- cludes that the Virgin of Le Puy was a reli- quary statue of carved and painted wood, ap- proximately 0.72 meters in height,6 resembling 6 283 inches. The Dreicer sculpture, 26? inches high including the base, is thus somewhat smaller than the original. is known to have been in the Cathedral of Clermont in the tenth century. The Virgin of Le Puy may also have had its origin in this period, when anthropomorphic reliquaries first appear in southern and central France. In any case, its existence at Le Puy toward the close of the eleventh century is attested by a docu- ment of o096.

This outlandish origin was probably suggested by the color of the image, black with the accumulated dirt of many years. This condition was reproduced by the sculptor of the Dreicer group; enough re- mains of the paint with which the sculpture was completed to show that the faces of the Vir- gin and the Child were originally painted black.
