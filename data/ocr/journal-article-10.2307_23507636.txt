<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lurianic Kabbala in a Platonic Key: Abraham Cohen Herrera's Puerta del Cielo* ALEXANDER ALTMANN Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts In what follows an attempt is made to depict the manner in which Abraham Cohen Herrera tried to reconcile, at varying levels, Lurianic Kabbala with Ital ian Renaissance Platonism, of which he was a belated representative. It will be shown that he recognized both the possibilities and severe limitations of harmonizing Kabbala in its highly developed form with thephilosophiaperennis. He succeeds best in the relatively simple coordination of the basic structure of the Lurianic system (à la Vital) and the neoplatonic ontology. He is less sure and hence inclined toward a variety of options when it comes to specifics such as the triadic pattern of the supernal world above the Sefirot, and especially so when confronting the often bewildering features of the Lurianic cosmogony. Yet he manages to find surprising analogies even for such outspoken mythological elements as the death of the primordial kings, restitution and rebirth. What is completely missing is the messianic orientation and a sense of salvation being imminent, something he might have caught from Lurianism. The final part of the paper deals with Herrera's multifaceted yet unambiguous effort to impart a neoplatonic significance to Luria's innovative and daring theory of zimzum. As the introductory section points out, Herrera considered Kabbala a divinely revealed and esoterically transmitted body of truths that was independent of rational verification, yet could be comprehended, in large measure, by human understanding. I The scope and purpose of Herrera's Puerto del Cielo1 are clearly indicated in the amplification of the book's title: y lus para entrar en la capacidad y inteligencia de la Cabala cujus misterios y contemplacion son llegados al (*) For Fritz Bamberger, superb draftsman of "inner form" (geistige Gestalt). (1) Written in Amsterdam probably in the early part of the 17th century, the work was translated from the Spanish into Hebrew by R. Isaac Aboab de Fonseca and published by him in Amsterdam, 1655. The Hebrew version omits book I, which contains 45 propositions on pre-Lurianic Kabbala, and book II which, for the most part of its 2 1 propositions on Lurianic Kabbala, refers the reader to book X. The Hebrew text, titled Sefer Shacar Hashamayim,Hashamayim, was republished in Dubno, 1784 and Warsaw, 1864 (Israel reprint, 1969). An abridged Latin version, Porta coelorum, based on the Hebrew text appeared as part of Knorr von Rosenroth's Kabbala Denudata, Sulzbach 1678. It was this edition that achieved Euro pean fame which lasted until the early 19th century.

Nothing short of the complete range and authentic meaning of Kabbala (i.e. Lurianic Kabbala) is to be opened up to the reader, an intent that contains the promise of a genuinely kabbalistic work, while, at the same time, a philosophic orientation is announced: Kabbala will be shown to move within the ambit of the human intellect or, more precisely, of Platonic thought. With Herrera we are obviously in the presence of a mind that seeks a balance between two worlds, something not surprising in his case. For his intellectual history — as far as we can make out3 — is marked by two formative stages, one that may be described as his growth into a full blooded Renaissance philosopher, and one characterized by his initiation into Kabbala. Abraham Cohen Herrera, whose date and place of birth are unknown (he died in 16354 at Amsterdam), grew up in Florence where his father by Friedrich Hàussermann, with an introduction by Gershom Scholem, was published by the Suhrkamp Verlag, Frankfurt am Main, 1974. Scholem's essay on the life, work and influ ence of Herrera was republished separately in Flebrew by Mosad Bialik, Jerusalem, 1978. The present study uses and quotes throughout the original Spanish text which is extant in three MSS., viz, 1) The Hague, Koninklijke Bibliotheek, MS. 131 C 10 fol.; 2) Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Columbia University, MS. X 86/H420; 3) Jewish National &amp; Uni versity Library, MS. EH 48A 16. I wish to thank the Libraries concerned for the microfilms put at my disposal and for their kind permission to make use of them for publication. Quotations follow the magnificent Hague MS. which, as its archaic spelling indicates, may be the oldest of the three. References are not to folios but to books and chapters which agree with the arrangement in the Hebrew version, except that, owing to the omission of books I and II, the numbering of books there is from I to VIII, not from I to X as in the original, which means that Hebrew book I is identical with Spanish book III, etc. The reader will find it intriguing to compare for himself the Spanish texts quoted with the printed Hebrew equivalents wherever these are available. He will notice that, while Aboab made every effort to remain faithful to the original, his medieval Hebrew terminology in matters philosophical sometimes left him in the lurch (see Scholem's essay, German text, p. 33; Hebrew text, p. 40). A careful study of the principles and achievements of his translation will probably revise the judgment arrived at by A. M. Anat (Perlmutter) in his brief and narrow based article (Tarbiz, 27.2-3, 1958, 322-332). I wish to express my sincere thanks to Profes sor Denah L. Lida of Brandeis University for helping me to cope with some difficult passages in the Spanish text. (2) See title-page.

The close liaison between Jewish and Christian intellectuals that had obtained a century earlier under Lorenzo de Medici5 was no longer in evidence at the time when Abraham Herrera spent his youth in the city. Under Cosimo I a ghetto was established in 1571 and the yellow badge was introduced.6 Yet these disabilities had no effect, it seems, on the young Herrera's humanistic education. When he speaks of his father as "el honrado y prudente Viejo, Raby David Cohen de Herrera,"7 one senses his gratitude for the circumspection with which he had been cared for. Judging by the astounding range of his philosoph ical training, he must have spent many years in intensive study of ancient, medieval and Renaissance works, including the most recent publications.8 A chance remark of his shows that he was also well aware of what was going on at Italian schools and universities.9 The result of his prolonged study was a firm commitment to the Platonic tradition in the large and comprehensive sense in which it had been embraced by Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola. If, as reported,10 in Ficino's chamber a perpetual light had been burn ing in front of Plato's bust, that lamp was still aflame as far as Herrera was concerned. To him Platonism was the philosophia perennis, and the long list of "the most excellent philosophers" whose autoridad he invokes — a list largely borrowed from Ficino's Theologia platonica11 — includes Zoroaster, Mercurius (Hermes) Trismegistos, Orpheus (the Orphic Hymns), Aglaophemus, Pythagoras, Architas, Plato, Speusippus, Numenius, Amonius, Plotinus, Amelius, Porphyry, Iamblichus, Plethon, "the Arabs of the Cordova Academy" such as Avicenna, Algazel, the author of Liber de de causis and of "the most secret part of the divine wisdom according to the Egyptians," and, finally, "all our philosophizing Hebrews" (todos nuestros philosophantes philosophantes hebreos) like R. Moseh de Egipto (Maimonides), Joseph Albo and Leone Ebreo.12 This rather motley list far from exhausts the array of Platonists quoted in thePuerta del cielo, and the circle widens considerably (5) See Umberto Cassuto, Gli Ebrei a Firenze nell' Età del Rinascimento, Firenze, 1918.

To the latter category belong Thomas Aquinas (who figures as a major authority);13 Durand de Saint-Pourçain (ca. 1270-1332);14 Francis de Sylvestris (Ferrariensis, ca. 1474-1528);15 and Francisco Suârez (1548-1617).(1548-1617).16 As for Italian Renaissance Platonists, there are explicit references to Ficino's Theologiaplatonica ( 1474), his Timaeus Commentary, and his Translation of, and Commentary on, the Enneads of Plotinus;17 Pico'sCommentosopra un Canzone deamore by Jeronimo Benivieni (i486);18 Julius Caesar Scaliger's "sutilissimo libro de subtilitate contra Cardano," viz. the Exercitationes (1557);19 Benito (Benedictus) Pereira's (ca. 1535-1610) De communibus omnium rerum naturalium principiis &amp; &amp; affectionibus Libri XVaffectionibus Libri XVand Francesco Patrizzi's (Patritius, 1529-97) Nova de de universis philosophia (1591).21 The kabbalistic element in Herrera's intellectual make-up was grafted upon the philosophical when between the years 1590-95, as Scholem surmised,22 he became the devoted pupil of Israel Sarug, whom he seems to have met first in "Raguza, ciudad de la prouincia de Ylirico"23 (Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia), before Sarug spent six years (ca. 1592-98) in Italy as an apostle of his own brand of Lurianism.24 Herrera probably remained in touch with him until his own departure from Italy in 1595. He unreservedly credited Sarug's reputation as a direct disciple of Isaac Luria and, as we shall see, attached particular importance to this circum stance. In this trust he was confirmed by the consensus among Italian Kabbalists, including Menahem 'Azarya Fano, the most prominent disci pie of Sarug's.25 What attracted him in the first place to seek Sarug's (13) See below, pp. 329, 335, 348.

As Scholem indicated in the Herrera essay (note 12), his view of Sarug as expressed in the article in Zion had undergone some modifications, which are not spelled out, however. It may be surmised that he was possibly inclined to consider Sarug to be more in the authentic line of Lurianic tradition than he had previously assumed. (25) Herrera refers distinctly to Fano in Puerta, X (VIII), 6; see below, note 141. Heoth erwise quotes the Sefer Kanfei Yona as a Lurianic work; see below, p. 337 and note 102.

Pico della Mirandola may be presumed to have alerted him to the essential character of Kabbala as an oral tradition. For there is a curious identity between the way the "true Kabbala" is defined by Pico on the one hand and by Herrera on the other. This is what Pico wrote in his Apologia:26 Relinquitur ergo, ut haec Hebraeorum doctrina, ... sit ilia, quam ipsimet nostri doctores fatentur, &amp; credunt à Deo Moysi, &amp; à Moyse per successionem alijs sapientibus fuisse reuelatum, &amp; est ista quae ex hoc modo tradendi, dicitur Cabala, quam sepè etiam uideo à nostris authoribus, hoc modo designari, dicendo: Ut dicit antiqua traditio. Haec est prima &amp; uera Cabala, de qua credo me primum apud Latinos explicatam fecisse mentionem,27 &amp; est ilia, quae ego utor in meis Conclusionibus, quas cum expressè ponam contra Hebraeos, ad confirmationem fidei nostrae . . . Verum quia iste modus tradendi per successionem, qui dicitur Cabalisticus uidetur conuenire unicuique rei secretae &amp; mysticae, hinc est quod usurparunt Hebraei, ut unam quanque scientiam, quae apud eos habetur pro secreta &amp; abscondita, Cabalam uocant . . . In similar vein Pico's Oratio28 explains the term Cabala as analogous to the Christian mysteries which Dionysius Areopagita had designated as purely oral (ex animo in animam sine litteris medio): "Hoc eodem penitus modo cum ex Dei praecepto uera ilia legis interpretatio Moysi deitus tradita reueleratur, dicta est Cabala quod idem est apud Hebraeos quod apud nos 'receptio.' Ob id scilicet, quod illam doctrinam non per litterarum monumenta, sed ordinariis revelationum successionibus alter ab altero quasi hereditario iure reciperet." The very same formal elements of the definition — Cabala as oral receptio and successive transmission of the true doctrine from Moses to the Sages down to our time — recur literally in the two preambles Herrera wrote to books I and II ofPuerta del Cielo. The first preamble, which prefaces the 45 kabbalistic propositions contained in Fano's adoption of Sarug's version of Lurianic Kabbala see my article, Hecarot cal hitpatehut toratotorato hakabbalit shel Remza mifano in the forthcoming Sefer Yeshacya Tishby.

After listing the pre-Lurianic Kabbalists whose doctrines underlie the propositions of book I, Herrera emphasizes the fact that all this ordinaria doctrina was com municated to him by way of an oral tradition: "Resebida y platicada de la viua voz del Haham Raby Ysrael Sarug de felice memoria, my preceptor y Maestro."29 Likewise, the preamble to book II, which expounds Lurianic Kabbala, defines the "divine wisdom called Cabala" as one transmitted "by oral and successive tradition" from Moses down to R. Simeon ben Yohai whose most esoteric writings (sus mas altos y ocultos tratados) — the Sifra di-Zenicutadi-Zenicuta and the Idrot — were interpreted (declarada) by Luria, written down (escrita) by Hayyim Vital (Calabres) and others, and orally delivered and explained (entregada y explicada con viua voz) by Israel Sarug to him, Abraham Cohen Herrera.30 In the body of the book Herrera frequently repeats the distinction between the written documents of Lurianic Kab bala31 made available to him by Sarug and the exclusively oral tradition he received from him, the underlying assumption being that Luria's teach ing had all been viva voce. Thus he says:32 "le que el diuino R. Isaac de Loria ascanazi nuestro maestro recibio y entrego a sus discipulos en par ticular a los doctissimos R. Haym Vital y R. Ysrael Sarug ... de cuyos escritosescritos y relacion he dicho y dire todo lo que en esta materia trate, trato y tratara." That the escritos are Vital's and the relacion refers to Sarug is attested not only in the second preamble but spelled out also elsewhere:33 "que en el tratado de Adam Kadmon y en otro que de la viua voz del diuino Loria oyô u puso por escrito el haham Haym Vital Calabres y me entrego y espuso mi maestro el haham Ysrael Sarug." (29) Preamble to book I. (30) The text mentions also varias partes del Zoar y tecunim as belonging to the ocultos tratadostratados which Luria sought to explain. Herrera correctly, it seems, understood Lurianic Kabbala to have arisen from an exegesis of the Zohar, especially its more esoteric sections, and of Tikkune Zohar. (31) Lurianic homilies (derushim) that Herrera may have received from Sarug himself are variously referred to in thePuerta (see VIII [VI], g; 13; 18; ,Andpassim). Their titles agree with the items in the collections (bikerakhim hakerukhim . . . ketuvim be'ezbac Elohim) which Aboab seems to have inherited from Herrera (asherhayom beyadi) and are listed by him in the translator's preface. They include: Sefer Adam Kadmon; Be'urIdrat Ha'azinu; Seder Harizilut, also called Kanfe Yona (see note 102); Sefer Mate ■uieW Mate; We'ele hamelakhim asher malekhumalekhu be°erezbe°erez edom. At the time of Herrera's studying with Sarug no authorized collections of Lurianic writings had yet come into being. (32) Puerto, VII (V), 8. (33) Puerto, VIII (VI), 5.</page><page sequence="7">[7] LURIANIC KABBALA IN A PLATONIC KEY 323 It is in line with this view of Kabbala as an essentially oral tradition that Herrera pictures 'Azriel of Gerona as a link in the catena aurea called Cab ala:34ala:34 "El sapiente cabalista R. Azariel por tradicion de sus antecedentes que la recibieron vocalmente de Eliahu el propheta." On the other hand, he is careful to delineate the oral tradition as something distinct from kabbalistic speculation founded on human reason. Thus he emphasizes the different grounds on which platonizing Kabbalists like ,Azriel, Meir ben Gabbai, Judah Hayyat and Moses Cordovero on the one hand and Isaac Luria on the other arrived at the same notion of the Divine mind as transcending being and knowledge. In Luria's case his view was based on tradition alone, without any philosophical ingredient.35 One recalls that a similar differentiation had been put forward during the controversy about the printing of the Zohar earlier in the 16th century when the opposing party had to face the argument that a number of kabbalistic works were already in print and no objection had been raised. The retort was that there was a difference between authentic documents of Kabbala such as the Zohar and Tikkune Zohar and treatises expounding Kabbala.36 Herrera would have agreed with this distinction. His Puerta del Cielo, though itself a book of the latter sort, acknowledges again and again the character of Cabala as verdadera recepcion 37 As we have seen, the concept reflects Pico's receptio and uera Cabala but there is obviously a big differ ence. Pico's uera Cabala was to serve ad confirmationem fidei nostrae since it was ultimately viewed christologically. Herrera's verdadera recepcion may imply a polemical stand against Christian Cabala in addition to its empha sis on authentic tradition. In adopting Pico's formal criterion of Cabala as a tradition going back to Moses and one orally transmitted — a definition that had also been taken over by Reuchlin in his De arte cabalistica38 — Herrera actually fol lowed a view that had been espoused also by Jewish Kabbalists. Pico him self may have borrowed it from Flavius Mithridates' Latin version {Liber (34) Puerto, VI (IV), 8. (35) Ibid., in fine.

The advocates of printing denied the validity of this distinction and argued that with the "revelation" (gilluy)(gilluy) of the Zohar the superiority of oral over written transmission had become obsolete; see Immanuel Beniventi's preface to the 1558 Mantua edition of Sefer Macarekhet Ha'elohut, 4a.

Herrera, who distinctly sub scribes to the theory of Mosaic origin and thereby stamps Kabbala as an exclusive possession of the pueblo Ysraelitico, has some difficulty with the authorship of Sefer Yezira which, as he mentions, is traditionally ascribed to the Patriarch Abraham. He solves the problem by also recording the attribution of authorship to R. Akiba.41 At any rate, it was the halo of an ancient tradition bespeaking a Divine source of revelation that drew him to Kabbala and made him seek initiation into it by no less august a teacher than Sarug, the reputed disciple of Luria. The fact that he never tired of pointing out the exclusively oral character of the tuition he received from him becomes fully intelligible once we realize what he expected: initiation into the oral tradition by which alone he could hope to become a full fledged Cabalista himself. Hence the repeated mentioning of viua voz as the medium of his instruction. It was not merely a statement of fact but an affirmation of status. It is somewhat strange that while Sarug provided the young Herrera with a number of documents on Lurianic Kabbala written by Hayyim Vital,42 he obviously refrained from handing him any written material on his own rather different version of Lurianism. Or should it be assumed that, at the time, he had not yet formulated his teaching in written form?43 Whatever the case may have been, Herrera seems to have cherished the purely oral nature of his teacher's instruction because it symbolized to him the authentic act of recepcion. Such was his appreciation of the special rela tionship between him and Sarug at that early period that even in later years when his master's writings might have been easily available in Amsterdam (where he wrote his Puerta del cielo44) he obviously preferred (39) See Hayyim Wirszubski, Liber Redemptions . . ., in: Divrei Ha'akademia hale'umit hayisraelit lemadaHm,hayisraelit lemadaHm, III, Jerusalem, 1970, p. 139.

Whereas Joseph Solomon Delmedigo, his younger contemporary,45 collected, edited and paraphrased Sarug's treatises,46 Herrera referred only to what he had orally received. It seems as if he tried to perpetuate, as it were, the splendid isolation and exclusiveness in which, as a youth, he had been privy to the oral teaching of hispreceptory maestro.maestro. Yet, paradoxically, this does not mean that he actually adopted Sarug's particular interpretation of the Lurianic myth. He sporadically mentions certain of its features but in all essential aspects he resolutely follows Vital. Though he proudly considered himself Sarug's pupil, he by no means was his follower. Sarug's function had been to initiate him into Kabbala, not to prescribe for him what to make his own. In some measure, it was Herrera's Platonism that served as a determining influence. Taking into account the dual strain in Herrera's intellectual make-up, we are faced with the question as to how he managed to reconcile the phi losopher in him with the newly established outlook of the Kabbalist. In other words, we have to define the mode of harmonization which found expression in his Puerta del cielo. In approaching this task, it may be instructive to recall that in the 13th century Isaac ibn Latif in his book bearing the same name (Shacar hashamayim), described its purpose in the simple and unambiguous phrase: sefer zeh mehabber hokhmat hakabbala cim hokhmathokhmat hapilosofia.47 He set out to create a composite of Kabbala and philosophy, and thereby incurred Judah Hayyat's mixture of praise and (45) He lived from 1591 to 1655; see Isaac Eisenstein-Barzilay, YosephShelomo Delmedigo,YosephShelomo Delmedigo, YasharYashar of Kandia: His Life, Works and Times, Leiden, 1974. (46) Delmedigo's Sefer Ta'alumot Hokhma and Sefer Novelot Hokhma, which contain a wealth of Sarugian material, appeared (in Hanau, not in Basel, as claimed) in the years 1629 and 1631 respectively, that is in the life-time of Herrera who died in 1635. In 1629 the two most probably met in Amsterdam where Delmedigo attended to some publishing business (see Scholem's essay [note 1], German text, pp. 22 f.; Hebrew text, pp. 27 f.) in which Herrera was asked to act as advisor (see Melnick [note 3], p. 38). They could hardly see eye to eye with one another. They were divided, one might say, by a common interest in Sarug and Lurianic Kabbala in general. Herrera's Platonic idealism was poles apart from Delmedigo's skeptical frame of mind. The Sefer Tacalumot Hokhma contains two presentations of Sarug's doctrine: Shever Yosef on fols. 5gb~77b and Kabbalat Sarug on pp. 77b-85b. On p. 60b the (fictitious ?) editor's gloss remarks that Delmedigo left unchanged Sarug's words in the texts (kuntresim) that "had come from the land of Israel," although his own philosophical and medical views were dif ferent; for the purpose he had in mind was not to write a book (hibbur) but to offer a collec don (yalqut). As for the Sefer Novelot Hokhma, it presents on fols. 149a-195b a comprehensive, if rather free, account of Sarug's teaching, which draws, to a large extent, on material found in Sarug's Sefer Limmude zAzilut. Delmedigo can hardly be said to have attempted a philosophical, let alone Platonic, interpretation of Sarug. (47) See Sara O. Heller Wilensky, Isaac ibn Latif — Philosopher or Kabbalist? in: Alexander Altmann (ed.), Jewish Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Cambridge, Mass., 1967, p. 186.</page><page sequence="10">326 ALEXANDER ALTMANN [10] criticism:48 "His words are more precious than pearls but insofar as they concern the science of Kabbala, he stands with one foot inside and with the other outside it." Herrera was too much of a genuine philosopher to believe in the possibility of a fusion of the two realms, and he was too much of a genuine Kabbalist to wish for it. While he acknowledges the legiti macy of both disciplines — "we follow our sages and the Platonists" (siguendo(siguendo a nuestros hahamim 0 sabiosy a los Platonicos)49 — and precisely on that account, he owes each a separate loyalty. He can easily therefore, in one and the same chapter, affirm the agreement of a certain Lurianic doc trine with the Platonists' view and conclude on a note of personal commit ment to the kabbalistic tradition:50 pero en esto, como en todo, me remito a la verdaderaverdadera recepcion, y a los que auiendola bien entendido la manifestaron, de los qualesquales holgaré ser discipulo. In recognizing a measure of kinship between Cabala Cabala and los Platonicos, he follows not only Pico della Mirandola51 but also a broad consensus among Kabbalists, old and new.52 He is careful, however, not to repeat the rather far-going assertion that Kabbala and philosophy (Platonism) were essentially the same and differed but in ter minology.53 If, as is reported by Leone Modena,54 a remark to this effect was made by Israel Sarug, it was not taken up by his pupil Herrera. What he attempted in his Puerta del cielo was the closest possible approximation of Platonism and Kabbala, not a total identification. He could not have said (as Sarug is supposed to have done): "There is no difference between Kabbala and philosophy, and all I teach in Kabbala I explain philosophic ally."55 As we shall see, he was well aware of the difficulties that stood in the way of such wholesale reconciliation.

As he went on in his work, he increasingly realized that the harmonizing effort could not be of one piece but had to be cut according to the cloth as it were; that there were limits of compatibility; and that, irrespective of success or failure, Kabbala as such remained intact and unimpaired. It is this conviction of the inner significance of kabbalistic truth — of the verdadera recepcion — that shines forth from the pages of the book and informs its high pathos and oratorical splendor. He, clearly, does not want the acceptance of that truth to hinge on its ability to be transposed into philosophical language. Kabbala is seen by him as a self-contained, self reliant, autonomous system whose truth is valid on its own terms, however recondite and bizarre they be. To use a phrase coined by Northrop Frye, the English scholar in Toronto,57 Kabbala is a "double mirror," turned inward and reflecting itself only to itself. Put in a different way: Kabbala may be transposed into a Platonic key but it remains what it is and one should not be surprised if in its transposed mode some notes on the key board fail to sound. II Let us exemplify the above general observations in some detail. We may distinguish a variety of areas in Lurianic thought yielding different degrees of philosophical intelligibility. 1) There is, in the first place, the relatively simple and straightfor ward coordination between the basic structure of the Lurianic system (according to Vital) and the neoplatonic ontology. Here Herrera is not afraid of positing an outright identity: En-sof corresponds to the neopla tonic One (the first hypostasis); Adam Kadmon and the lights emanating from him and forming the colam ha-en-sof,iS with the addition of the colam (56) See above, pp. 317 f. (57) See his essay "The Double Mirror," in: Bulletin, The American Academy of Arts and Sciences,Sciences, xxxv, December 1981, no. 3, pp. 32-41. Frye applies the image to the Bible. (58) Herrera adopted the term colam ha-en-sof from Sarug who, as far as I could ascertain, was the first to use it. It is not found in Hayyim Vital or in any other disciple of Luria's. Yet whereas in Sarug it denotes the world evolved from the malbush (see below, p. 340) and containing within it Adam Kadmon as one of the entities comprising it (s eeLimmudei ^Azilut,^Azilut, Munkâcs, 1897, 22b; J.S. Delmedigo,Novelot Hokhma, 156a-b), Herrera places the colamcolam ha-en-sof after Adam Kadmon which is said to contain the malbush. As Dr. Idel informs me.Johanan Alemanno's Sefer Heshek Shelomo (MS. Berlin, Orientalia 832, fol. 144r) uses the term eolam haHllah to signify the world above the Sefirot, there being no difference between the two except that the one bestows emanation, whereas the other receives it, a concept that goes back to the Liber de causis and appears also in Yosef ben Shalom Ashkenazi (Pseudo Rabad, Introduction to the Commentary on Sefer Yezira, 2b) and David ben Yehuda Hehasid</page><page sequence="12">328 ALEXANDER ALTMANN [12] hcfazilut,hcfazilut, the first of the four sefirotic worlds,59 are the counterpart of the neoplatonic Intellect or mundus intelligibilis (the second hypostasis); and the remaining three of the sefirotic worlds (those of beri°a, yezira and casiya)casiya) answer to the (third) hypostasis of Soul or anima mundi.60 How does Herrera establish these three identities? (a) The kabbalistic concept of En-sof presented the least difficulty. Though not philosophical in its origin,61 it had already acquired a neopla tonic connotation as early as in 13th century Geronese Kabbala and Herrera was well aware of this fact. cAzriel of Gerona, Meir ben Gabbai, Judah Hayyat and Moses Cordovero are quoted by him as representatives of a negative theology that, in Plotinian fashion, places En-sof above will and intellect.63 He insists, however, that the Zoharic notion of En-sof as wholly transcendent63 owes its origin to authentic tradition rather than to philosophical speculation.64 Despite this difference in provenance he sees complete harmony in concept. His procedure in establishing the identity takes the form of presenting first the philosophical notion in all its com plexity and then pointing out certain statements of Luria's as bearing exactly the same meaning. Herrera's method of fitting the Lurianic idea into the philosophical mold, i.e. of adapting.Ew-.yof to the One, can be seen at work in the first two propositions of book I. The opening proposition puts forward the notion of an eternal uncaused cause of all that is, existing necessarily by virtue of its essence, pure act without any material or passive potency, infinite goodness and simplest oneness in unlimited perfection and self sufficiency. Proposition 2 simply remarks: Con que se entiendeporque llaman los Sapientes Cabalistas a la Cauza primera ensoph 0 ynfinito, y porque no setrata (see lde\, Demut ha'adam sheme'al hasefirot, in.Dacat, No. 4, 1980, p. 44). It was taken over by Cordoveroin a passage (Pardes Rimmonim, II, 7) quoted by Herrera (see below, p. 334 where this matter is not touched upon, however) who refers to it also in another place (Puerta, VIII (V), 7) as representing the view of the Kabbalists. On the analogy of the passages referred to, Alemanno's colam haHllah would signify En-.so/itself but it is more likely that it stands for the "Sefirot"Sefirot"Sefirot above the Sefirot" (see below, notes 74 and 91), i.e. the Sefirol within Adam Kadmon. On this assumption Alemanno's term, though seemingly synonymous with colam ha-en-sof, bears a connotation different from both Sarug's and Herrera's. (59) See G. Scholem, Hitpatehut Torat Hacolamot, in: Tarbiz, II (1930/1), 415-442; III .33-66 ,(2/ג93ג) (60) For an account of the three Plotinian hypostases see A.H.

The very same procedure is repeated on a large scale in book III (I) where the first eight chapters establish the philosophical concept of the One and chapter 9 identifies Luria's notion of En-sof with it. The method adopted pays off well, for it enables Herrera to invest the sparseness of the kabbalistic sym bol with the richness of its philosophical counterpart. There is hardly any resource in the neoplatonic tradition of theology that he left untapped. The Plotinian notion of the One in all its ramifications, exalting the One above all number; the Avicennian-Maimonidean stress on God's neces sary being; the aspect of "perfect goodness" that goes back to Plato's "There is no envy in the heavenly choir" (Phaedrus 247 A) and was medi ated by the Liber de causis or Book of Pure Goodness, a work much cherished by Herrera; Aristotle's definition of the perfect as that which lacks noth ing (Met. V, xvi,102 1 b) which had figured prominently in cAzriel of Gerona's theology; Thomas Aquinas' "negative infinity" brooking no finitude, which is God's, in contrast to "privative infinity" yearning for finitude, which belongs to matter;65 all these elements — to be supple mented further in later books — combine to form a single concept which is said to correspond to Luria's notion of En-sof. In Herrera's words:66 Por todotodo 10 que hasta a qui se à dicho, me parece que queda bastantemente explicado, 10 que que nuestro mecubal y maestro el Haham R. Ysaque de Loria Ascanazi, de gloriosa memoria, pretende,memoria, pretende,memoria, pretende, diziendo, que laynfinita bondad diuina ante cede y cauza todas las las cosas.67 The term ynfinita bondad diuina stands here for En-sof. As in proposition 2 of book I, Herrera unhesitatingly credits the kabbalistic notion with the full range of meaning that had accrued to the neoplatonic concept. The Lurianic imagery of En-sof "filling all space" with its light prior to the act of zimzum, the Divine self-limitation, was held by Herrera to merit a philosophical interpretation of its own. He offered it in chapters 1-5 of book V (III) as a curtain-raiser to his discussion of zimzum, a theme to which we shall revert further below. As he points out, there are eight pos sible senses of infinity, of which only the last three are applicable to God. They denote 1) infinity of essence, perfection and power; 2) infinity of duration or eternity ; 3) infinity of space or presence. A glance at Marsilio Ficino's Theologia platonica (II,iv-vi) suggests that Herrera's three Divine infinities are borrowed from that source where the chapters concerned (65) See Thomas Aquinas, Quaestiones disputatae, De potentia, q. 1, a.2. (66) Puerta, III (I), g. (67) The elaborate argument that follows seems to be Herrera's own amplification of Luria's statement which, as quoted here, may be a mere paraphrase of sentences such as are found in Shacar Hahakdamot, 3 or elsewere.</page><page sequence="14">33&lt;נ ALEXANDER ALTMANN [14] are headed : Dei virtus est infinita; Deus est semper; Deus est ubique.68 What is of particular relevance to Luria's notion of En-sof filling all space is Ficino's concept of Divine ubiquity. Of great interest is also Herrera's discussion of eternity in light of Boethius' and Plotinus' famous passages on that theme.69 He reaches the conclusion that it was in view of the threefold philosophical notion of Divine infinity that the Kabbalists called the First Cause by the name En-sof. As he put it,70 "estas très maneras de ynfinidad, conuenieneconueniene a saber, la de essencia perfection 0 actiua potencia, la de eternidady de duracion yndeterminadaduracion yndeterminadaduracion yndeterminada estableyfixa:yla deynmensidad de presencia y assistencia a a todos los espacios 0 lugares reaies y possibles, conuienenpropriamente a la Cauza primera,primera, quepor esta razon es llamada de nuestros diuinos ensoph 0 ynfinita." A hidden reference to these three infinities in the specifically Lurianic con text oizimzum occurs already in proposition 2 of book II when it is said of the infinita y perfectissima luz primera (En-sof) that by limiting itself it did not create segun la infinidad de su essencia, eternidad de su existencia, y immensidad de de su potencia y actual presencia .71 In another passage mentioning Luria by name the infinity of the Divine being as it existed prior to zimzum is spelled out only in the sense of ubiquity.72 What clearly emerges is the assumption of a conceptual identity between the neoplatonic One and the kabbalistic — particularly Lurianic—En-sof whose very name expresses the notion of infinity. There is no suggestion that this name originated in the philo sophic discussion of infinity. What is claimed by Herrera is merely an objective identity of meaning. (b) In book IV (II) the procedure of linking Adam Kadmon to the neo platonic Intellect, again, is one starting out from the philosophic level of argumentation. The identity of the two is affirmed right at the outset but Herrera's discussion is focused upon demonstrating the thesis that from the One there proceeded a single most perfect being {un solo perfectissimo effecto),effecto), one that qualifies for the attributes of both Intellect and Adam Kadmon.Kadmon. Chapter 1 offers no less than thirteen arguments to this end. Its upshot is that from the One only one thing can proceed; that from the perfect cause only a perfect product can follow, and that only a single being of that kind is possible; that on account of being caused, it is necessa (68) See Marcel's edition (note 11), I, pp. 82-91.

Herrera adds the simile of a king of kings and a king or viceroy subject to him in order to illustrate the relationship between the One and Intellect, En-sof and Adam Adam Kadmon.Kadmon. Moreover, he introduces already here the description of Adam, KadmonKadmon as the "instrument as it were" (como el instrumenta) by which En-sof creates. He further points out that the arguments adduced in chapter 1 offer a tolerable measure of proof (mediocremente provada) for Luria's view and that they help us to understand the distinction found in TikkuneTikkune Zohar73Zohar73 between c1llat cal kol hac1llot (la causa de todas las causas), i.e., En-sof, and cillat hacillot, i.e., Keter, the highest of the Sefirot, called there Adam Kadmon.Kadmon. Following Luria's novel interpretation of Adam Kadmon as a being distinct from and above the sefirotic Keter, Herrera says of that newly conceived figure that it has to be understood as the "first and highest crown" (el primero y mas alto Keter)•, as the "supernal mind" (la mahassabamahassaba 0 mente alta)\ "and, in short, as the first and most perfect effect of the independent cause of all the causes."74 The term mahassaba 0 mente alta and its variants such as la altissima mahassaba,mahassaba, mente 0 intelligencia del mundo del infinito75 are clearly intended to reflect the neoplatonic designation of the second hypostasis as "Intellect" or "intelligible world." The term mahassaba also provides a link with the older kabbalistic tradition of calling Keter mahashava. Thus Isaac the Blind and the Gerona mystics speak of Keter as "pure thought" (mahashava tehora),76 and Cordovero describes Keter as "primordial thought" (73) Puerta, IV (II), 1 infine: conque me parece que queda la yntencion de nuestro maestro . . .y entendida la distincion que enentendida la distincion que enentendida la distincion que en el Zoarparasah de beresith [i.e.Zohar I, 2 2b, a passage that as part of the section 2 2a-2ga belongs to Tikkune Zohar, a fact obviously unknown to Herrera] y en el ticonticon [here the copyist left space for the insertion of the number, i.e. tikkun 70, fol. 120a] ensenaensena R. Simeon ben Yoay, defelice memoria, que ay entre la Cauza de todas las Cauzas, y la Cauza de las las cauzas. The distinction between the two "Causes" occurs only in the Tikkune Zohar, as Dr. Yehuda Liebes has assured me. In the passages quoted the "cause of causes" is identified with the SefiraKeter which, again in Tikkune Zohar, is seen to be symbolized by Adam Kadmon; see Yehuda Liebes, Perakim bemilon Sefer hazohar (Dissertation, The Hebrew University, 1977)־ P• 38, no. 55. (74) Herrera thus follows Luria's example in adding to the four worlds of Sefirot a fifth world, that of Adam Kadmon and its lights called colam ha-en-sof. As will be shown below (pp. 342 f.), he places, as Luria does, supernal sets of Sefirot within Adam Kadmon. In pre-Lurianic Kabbala there had already appeared a clear tendency to assume the existence of Sefirot higher than those contained in the four worlds of azilut, berPah, yezirah and Qasiyah. This par ticular trend had been stimulated by the Geonic doctrine of zahzahot and had found its most distinct expression in the teaching of R. David ben Yehuda He-Hasid, as Moshe Idel has shown; see his article in Dacat quoted in note 58 and its sequel entitled Hasefirot shemecal HasefvrotHasefvrot in Tarbiz, LI. 2, 1982; pp. 239-280.

Having ventured to establish, by arguments of his own, the existence of a single perfect, though finite, being as the instrument of the One by which all further creation was effected, Herrera undertakes (in ch. 2) to "con firm" this thesis by the authority (con la autoridad) of the consensus of the entire Platonic tradition. It is in this context that he refers to the long list of philosophers from Pythagoras to Leone Ebreo which we mentioned earlier on.80 Of these he singles out a few. He quotes in the first place a passage from Ficino's Commentary on the Timaeus which states "Del purissimopurissimo uno proximamente procédé un mundo grandemente uno . . . que por el resplandorresplandor y calor que desi diffunde, produze en virtud de su cauza todas las mas cosas."81 cosas."81 Next follows a quotation from Plotinus' treatise against the Gnos tics (Enneads II.9.1) which asserts that from the One there emanated a being (ente or ser) that contains all beings (entes y seres), an intelligible that comprises (comprehende) all intelligibles and which is the first intellect (el primeroprimero entendimiento) that embraces (abraça) in itself all pure and separate intelligencies and all ideas and archetypes (todas las ideas y exemplar es) of all things and which is in effect an intelligible world (un mundo inteligible) pro duced by the supreme goodness and the pure One.82 The characteriza tion of this being as the locus of all forms is reaffirmed in yet another quo tation from Ficino taken, this time, from the Theologiaplatonica:83 ". . . and this is the mind or pure intellect (la mente opuro entendimiento) which pro ceeds from the first cause without intermediary and which possesses the totality of all intelligible ideas (la uniuersidad de todas las inteligibles ideas)." Finally, Herrera quotes Pico della Mirandola's Commentary on Jeronimo Benevieni's Cancion del amor as saying that according to the opinion of Plotinus and Porphyry confirmed by the most excellent other Platonists and approved by Aristotle and all the Arabs, especially Avicenna, God produced a first single being of an intellectual and incorporeal nature (77) Sefer ShPur Komah lerabbi Moshe Cordovero, Jerusalem, 1966, fol. 49c.

The formulation of four interconnected objections in chapter 3 of book IV (II) turns out to be of prime importance for the discussion that follows. It structures the entire philosophical discourse up to chapter 2 in book VII (V) and has a decisive bearing on the understanding of the kabbalistic position, especially insofar as the notion of zimzum is concerned. In the present context we shall deal only with the first of the doubts which ques tions the legitimacy of the assumption that from the One there emanated but a single most perfect being (Intellect-Adam Kadmon). As Herrera points out, reason argues against the restriction of the infinite divine power to the production of a single immediate finite being since it is possi ble and indeed necessary to assume an infinite series of finite entities one more perfect than the other to emerge from the Infinite. For if it was the intention of the First Cause, the infinite goodness, to manifest itself, it was bound to do so in an infinity of ways, not through a single limited effect.87 The ultimate answer to this objection will be the Lurianic notion of zimzum,zimzum,zimzum, which forms the subject of book V (III). Yet Herrera considered it advisable to settle the question also independently of the Lurianic solu don. He offered a number of counter-arguments some of which, it appears, were his own while others are quoted from a variety of sources, a clear indication that the problem had been, and still was, a matter of debate. Of contemporary philosophers he cites Francisco Suârez ,Disputa tionestiones metaphysicae (XXXV.i.3)88 and Julius Caesar Scaliger's Exercitationes (§249)89; a 14th century authority referred to is Durand de Saint Pourçain, who is introduced as the one known among the scholastic theo logians as doctor illuminado.

Yet in the following chapter (IV[II],6) Herrera goes a step further. He proceeds to connect the philo sophic discussion of the "doubt" referred to before with an inner kabbalistic debate on a similar kind of objection. "Lest anyone think," he says, "that what has been said [concerning the linkage of Intellect and Adam Adam Kadmon] is a figment of my imagination (es de nuestra cabeca), I shall deal here briefly with what the Haham R. Moses Cordovero, of blessed memory, has said about that proposition, which will be of no little advan tage for an understanding of our subsequent discourse."92 What follows is a lengthy quotation from Cordovero's Pardes rimmonim (11,7) which raises, and seeks to settle, the very kind of "doubt" previously reported by Herrera in the name of the philosophers but now introduced by Cordovero as one posed by some Kabbalists. In Herrera's words, the ques tion is one en que dudaron algunos de los ynuistigadores 0 ynquisidores de la Sabiduria,Sabiduria, translating Cordovero's kezat mehokre hahokhma, which he obvi ously understood to refer to the adepts of the divine wisdom or Kabbala.93 This made the only possible sense, seeing that the "doubt" was said to (go) Durandi a Sancto Porciano In sententias theologicas Petri Lombardi Commentariorum, Libri quattuor,quattuor, Lugduni, 1595, pp. 262 f.; Puerta, IV (II), 7.

In Puerta, VIII (VI), 1-3 Herrera undertakes to support the Lurianic doctrine of Adam Kadmon as an additional fifth supernal world above the Sefirot by tracing its "sources" in pre-Lurianic Kabbala. Apparently, he was unaware of a prior effort in this direction by Hayyim Vital (seeShacar Hahakdamot, 6; cEz Hayyim, I, ii, 2). Theanteced ents which he believed to have discovered are passages in Sefer Yezirah (1.5: Mekhon kodesho being distinct from the Sefirot)■, Tikkune Zohar 1 (17a: the Name that "waters" the Sefirot)■, TikkuneTikkune Zohar 19 (42a); 69 (115b; Herrera gives page 113 of the Cremona edition); ibid. (116b); Zohar, Be re's h it 22b (see note 73; Herrera gives page 113 of the Cremona edition). His concern to see Luria's innovative doctrine based on older authorities stems, no doubt, from his concept of verdadera recepcion (see above, pp. 321-32tt). (92) Puerta, IV (II), 6.

As Cordovero put it more precisely: "It is fitting for us to inquire why En-sof did not produce tens of thousands of Sefirot and many other worlds . . ., considering that he has the potency of producing them and that it is the property of his goodness to emanate and impart to others (ynfluyr a otros y comunicarse)." Yet it was a question, he said, that while it perturbed the inquirer and left him amazed, was, upon reflection (siendo bien considerado), an insipid and foolish one (quistion sim pie y ygnorante).pie y ygnorante).pie y ygnorante). Herrera quotes in full Cordovero's reductio ad absurdum of the alleged problem, which enables him to declare in the end that an unambiguous result had been achieved: In conformity with all Kabbalists it was now established that there was a highest immediate effect, appro priate to the infinite first cause, and being the most perfect that could have been produced; though called Keter by Cordovero, it was not the KeterKeter of the azilutic world, above which there existed the world of the infi nite (el mundo del ynfinito) — as might be gathered from the Zohar and TikkuneTikkune Zohar and as was taught by Luria — but Adam Kadmon or his supreme supreme Keter.94 In other words, the parallel between Intellect and Adam Kadmon Kadmon was now complete both in concept and argumentation. At the same time, Herrera describes Cordovero's procedure as one employing the philosophical method as a legitimate tool for the purposes of the kabbalistic truth. "Another thing," he says, "which one ought to note with attention and diligence is the fact that the wise Cordovero took advantage and made use of the philosophical reasons of Avicenna, R. Moses of Egypt (Maimonides) and their successors in order to make per suasive and adorn the kabbalistic truth (para persuadir y adornar la verdad cabalistica)cabalistica) taught by him, even as I have done and shall do in regard to the opinions and reasons (sentencias y razones) of Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas and others, be they theologians or philosophers."95 As Herrera clearly indicates, rational theology and philosophy are valuable props of Kabbala, not criteria of its "infallible truths" (ynfalibles verdades), and there may be found other and still better opinions and reasons to "illustrate" them than those used by him.96 (c) It requires some effort to trace the third coordination, that of the neoplatonic hypostasis of Soul (anima mundi) with the three lower sefirotic worlds of berPa ("throne of glory"; silla de la gloria), yezira ("the world of angels"; el mundo angelico) and casiya ("the world of celestial bodies"; el (94) Puerto, IV (II), 6.

He merely hints at the con nection in a number of ways. Thus he points out that the doctrine ascribing the coming-into-being of the lower sefirotic worlds to the activ ity of the colam ha-°azilut is "in accordance with the view of the Platonists which holds that the world soul produced it [heaven] by a kind of exhaling" (segun la sentencia de los Platonicos que affirma que la anima del cielo casicasi expirando 10 produce).97 The essential characteristic of this triad of worlds is their having been produced ex nihilo, i.e., without a préexistent matter or substance, not, like the upper worlds (Adam Kadmon, colam ha-en-sofha-en-sof and zolam haPazilut) by way of emanation from En-sof (VII [V],7). The lower realms are the "dwelling" of the Shekhina (the Sefira Malkhut), whereas the upper worlds are the "dwelling" of En-sof (VIII [VI],4). The instrument by which En-sof "created" the three lower sefirotic worlds is the zolam haPazilut. Yet there exists a relation between all three compo nents of the upper world and the three elements of the lower. The zolamzolam haberi^ahaberi^a resembles Adam Kadmon and represents Intellect, for which reason, Herrera suggests, the Zohar and Tikkune Zohar occasionally call Adam Adam Kadmon adam deberPa.99 The colam hayezira corresponds to the "lights of Adam Kadmon" (the colam ha-en-sof) and stands for Soul. The colam hacasiyahacasiya bears resemblance to the zolam haPazilut and forms the "body" as it were of the total system {Adam Kadmon, las luzes del mundo de ensoph, y la assiluth,assiluth, son très soberanos grados de la diuinidad, es a saber, el diuino entendimiento,entendimiento, la diuina anima, y el diuino cuerpo, exemplar es y cauzas de los très CriadosCriados mundos).99 There is also another way in which Herrera describes the total entity of upper and lower worlds by the image of the cosmic Anthropos and, most significantly, he refers to it as taken from Plotinus:100 (97) Puerto, V (III)), 9. (98) Cf. Yehuda Liebes, Perakim (note 73), pp. 56 ff., nos. 159-164. (99) Puerto, VIII (VI), 13. The designation of the luzesdel mundo de ensoph asdiuina anima does not conflict with our interpretation of the lower Sefirot as corresponding to the anima mundimundi of the neoplatonic system since the lower levels are held to be prefigured in the higher ones. (100) Puerto, VIII (VI), 14. The reference to Plotinus' libro de homine is puzzling. No such title is found in Porphyry's list of topics in the Enneads which is faithfully reproduced by Ficino. We are therefore at a loss to locate the passage. Dr. Idel has drawn my attention to a curious parallel to the five elements of reason in a text written by Nathan of Gaza (see G. Scholem, Becikevot Mashiah, Jerusalem,Scholem, Becikevot Mashiah, Jerusalem, 1944, pp. 140 f.): "There are five kinds of knowledge (hamesh yedi'ot)(hamesh yedi'ot) in Adam Kadmon: simple knowledge (yedi'ah peshutah); thought (mahashavah)■, art (mezayyeret); knowledge of brotherliness and strife (yediQah shel נahwah umahloket); all comprising knowledge (kollelet kulah). The essence of these Cikkar נeleh) was within (bifenim) Adam Adam Kadmon." May it be assumed that Nathan of Gaza had read Herrera's work? This is far from unlikely, seeing that the Skadar Hashamayim was studied in the same period by Jacob</page><page sequence="21">[2 1] LURIANIC KABBALA IN A PLATONIC KEY 337 Y por concluyr con pocas palabras, podemos dezir con Plodno, en su libro de homine, que adam kadmon corresponde al entendimiento, sus sinco luzes a la razon, en que se colocan los sinco habitos, de yntelecto, arte, prudencia, sciencia y sapiencia, la assiluth a la ymaginacion primera, casi razon particular y no organizada, la beriah a los sentidos del animal, assi ynteriores como exteriores, la yetsira a la vegetatiua, y la hassiah al cuerpo natural y organizado, del grande y universal hombre. Here the three upper worlds represent the various ranges of the mundus intelligibilisintelligibilis (intellect; the five forms of acquired intellect (reason): intellect, art, prudence, science and wisdom; first imagination or reason concerned with particulars. With the three lower worlds we enter into the realm of the senses (internal and external); vegetative life; body. The neat division between Intellect and Soul as corresponding to the upper and lower worlds of the Lurianic hierarchy is no longer maintained. The colam ha^azilutha^azilut as the world of imagination now partakes of Soul, and the last two worlds (yezira and casiya) reach down into Plotinus' fourth hypostasis (Nature) and the realm of body. Herrera seems to be conscious of perhaps straining credulity by proposing this kind of coordination between Lurianic and neoplatonic ontology. For he continues:101 "Lest this inter pretation appear strange to some (porque no se admiro alguno desta nuestra espusicion),espusicion), I shall quote the general sense of what the Haham R. Isaac Luria, our authority (nuestro coripheo), said in the second discourse of the Book on the Order of Emanation (del libro de la orden de la assiluth) which some call Canphelonah or The Wings of the Dove."102 The passage quoted deals with the portrayal of the three lower sefirotic worlds (los très mundos ynferiores)ynferiores) as part of the cosmic Anthropos (este gran cuerpo) and as having their originating principle in the Sefira Malkhut of the colam haPazilut which is called here "the soul of the three worlds" (anima de los très mundos). As for the latter, they are said to be constituted in turn by the intellectual, rational and corporeal. Thus, a parallel to the so-called Plotinus passage is established. Clearly, Herrera is greatly concerned to link the respective ontologies. It should be noted, however, that whereas here the character of anima mundi is assigned to the Sefira Malkhut of the azilutic world, a pre ben Zemach in Jerusalem (as Joseph Ergas reports); see Scholem's essay, German text, pp. 33 ff. ; Hebrew text, pp. 40 ff. (101) Ibid. (102) Here Herrera identifies the Seder Ha'azilut (?) with the Sefer Kanfe Yonah, the work attributed to Luria (see Joseph Ergas, Sefer Shomer :Emunim, 1859, I, 25, p. 20) but written originally by Luria's disciple Moshe Yonah and elaborated by Fano (see my article quoted in note 25). Isaac Aboab, likewise, equated the two writings (see above, note 31). In a previous passage (Puerta, VIII [VI], 12) Herrera speaks of them as two separate writings.</page><page sequence="22">gg8 ALEXANDER ALTMANN [22] vious passage (VIII [VI], 13) reserves this role to the colam hayezira, the intermediate of the three lower worlds, calling it anima del universo and doing so by referring to the Platonists (como 105 Platonicos dizen). This par ticular coordination corresponds more closely to the Plotinian scheme.103 In short, the stress on neoplatonic analogies is maintained at this level too, even though we miss here the preciséness found in the afore-going discussions. 2) The difficulty of evidencing a close and convincing coordination between Lurianic Kabbala and the neoplatonic system which emerges already at level (c) of the ontological structure becomes more pronounced when we move into a consideration of specifics even at level (b), that of Adam Adam Kadmon. The tripartite division of the kabbalistic equivalent of the Plotinian Intellect into Adam Kadmon, colam ha-en-sof and Qolarn ha^azilut presented a problem not to be ignored. Herrera tried to solve it, it seems, by pointing out that a triadic pattern of the mundus intelligibilis had been assumed also in the neoplatonic tradition. Chapter 14 of book VI (IV) refers to a controversy that is relevant to the point. The debate is shown to have originated in Plotinus' discussion of the five categories that consti tute the world of Intellect, i.e. being (ser), identity (ydentidad), otherness (alteridad),(alteridad), movement (movimiento) and rest (estada).104 The contrariety of identity and otherness on the one hand and of movement and rest on the other was held by some philosophers (Iamblichus, Syrianus, Proclus) to be irreconcilable with the unitary character of Intellect as an hypostasis in immediate proximity to the One. It was therefore suggested that the monadic Intellect be replaced by the triad of Being (Essence)-Life Intellect.105 This view ran counter to the classical doctrine of Amonius, Plotinus and Porphyry that resisted a separation of the categorial compo nents of the intelligible. The answer to the problem mentioned before was sought in the assumption that intellect, though indivisible, emerged in three phases rather than in three distinct hypostases. It is this solution that seems to have commended itself to Herrera who wished to see the result of the neoplatonic debate "applied" (aplicado) to the Lurianic scheme. This meant that in his view one had to distinguish three phases in the upper world corresponding to the three phases in Intellect: Adam Kadmon as the highest; the lights of the colam ha-en-sof as the intermediate; and the (103) See also Puerto, VIII (VI), 18, 6th Way, where, again, the three lower worlds are defined in relation to the upper ones.

A variation of the theme is found in chapter 8 of book VIII (VI): "We may say with Proclus and Patritius108 that from the purest One, which is En-sof,En-sof, the First Cause, there was produced a monad of being (unidad del ente ente 0 ser) and in it all the monads of all beings, which is Adam Kadmon and his supernal lights, followed by the first and most perfect being which is cAtika KadishacAtika Kadisha or Holy Ancient One; followed by the first life which is Arikh AnpinAnpin or the Long-Faced; followed by the first intellect which is Abba or Father, Hokhma or Wisdom." So far we have encountered the familiar triad of being-life-intellect, placed here within the first three parzufim (configurations) of the colam fuEazilut, not distributed over the three upper worlds (Adam Kadmon, etc.) nor over the first three lights of colam ha-en-sof,ha-en-sof, as we saw in the previous instances. There is the further novelty that the triad is extended: "followed by the first will which is Ima or Mother, Bina or Providence; followed by action or work which is Zecir Anpin Anpin or the Short-Faced; followed by the effect proceeding from it all which is Nukbe or his Female or the Holy Kingdom (malcuth la santa)."109 How little Herrera feels committed to any one of these coordinations may be gauged from the sequel to the passage just quoted: "Or in closer conformity with the common doctrine and with what is being discussed at the schools and universities (mas conforme a la doctrina comun y que en las escuelasescuelas y universidades se platica) we may say that from En-sof, the One above everything, there arises (nace) the most perfect All, i.e. Adam Kadmon Kadmon who, resembling his origin, is as much one (uno) as is possible for an effect of the pure One to be . . . but seeing that the distinction between the orders and worlds (ordenesy mundos) exceeds that between the genera, it seems to me that it can be explained by the four names of 72,63,45 and 52 letters which Adam Kadmon contains within himself as the roots (las rayzes)rayzes) of the four worlds ofנazilut, berEa, yezira and casiya.'n1° Here the colamcolam ha-en-sof seems to be eliminated and the transition from Adam Kadmon Kadmon to the four sefirotic worlds is described as one due solely to the creative potencies of the four Divine names.111 Herrera finds this version (107) Cf. the further variation in IX (VII), 3.

What he is not prepared to tamper with is the concept of Adam Kadmon, the bedrock of his coordinating effort. It is to safeguard this notion that he clearly departs from Sarug's ontology which interposes the world of malbush or (Divine) garment (vestido)112 as the locus of the Names and letters between En-sof and Adam Kadmon. Herrera makes it perfectly clear that the Sarugian malbush has to be placed within Adam Adam Kadmon. He understands it to be the archetypal world that com prises all effects of En-sof (que entiendo es el exemplar que en si concibe de todos sus sus effectos), symbolized, according to Sarug, by the primordial Tora "full of letters" (la ley llena de letras). For even as the four Names form the sefirotic worlds, so the letters of the Hebrew alphabet are the "principles" of all things produced.113 Precisely because of this archetypal function of malbush malbush (porque son principios y cauzas de las Sephiroth), it is clear (queda claro), Herrera says, why they are located in Adam Kadmon (porque se ponen en Adam Kadmon).114Adam Kadmon).114 The ultimate reason that facilitated Herrera's attempt to find correspondences between Adam Kadmon as the living pattern of all things and the neoplatonic Intellect was his correct observation that for Plotinus too — and, indeed, for the whole Platonic tradition — the ideas were living entities, intellects rather than objects of thought, intelligi bles.115 Herrera distinctly referred to this point when he said that, accord ing to the Platonists, all worlds or grades of existence in the Divine Mind are living, intellectual and monadic entities.118 (112) Sarug describes the malbush as having arisen from the combination (zeruf; hiztarfut) of the measure (shicur), i.e., the delimiting {zimzum) by En-sof of the boundaries of the Sefirot, and the residue (reshimu) of the light oi En-sof that had been withdrawn (LimmudeכAzilut, 22a; 34d; quoted by Delmedigo, Novelot Hokhma, 151b; 1563-1573). He thus claims for the malbush malbush what Vital, whom Herrera follows (see below, p. 352), postulated for Adam Kadmon whom he regarded as the first being to be produced. According to Sarug, the first act of zimzum zimzum resulted in the formation of points in the vacuous space left by the withdrawal of the light of En-sof (Limmude 'Azilut, 11c), and after the coming-into-being of the malbush a further act of zimzum was performed through the folding-up (kippul of the malbush, whereby the space for the creation of the worlds was provided. In this space Sarug places the Zoharic tehirutehiru (Divine aura), followed by awir kadmon, and it is the latter in which Adam Kadmon is located. Fano developed this ontology and Delmedigo offered both interpretations and criticisms on several points (for the latter, see Novelot, 153b-154a; 164a-b; and passim.) It seems that his own view inclined toward following Vital's concerning the priority of Adam Kadmon in the sense thathesaw in themalbush merely th eplacenta (shilya) as it were ofAdam Kadmon (Novelot, 163a). The elaborate discussions of the subject by both Fano and Delmedigo require a full investigation. (113) Puerta, VII (V), 10; 11. (114) Puerta, VIII (VI), 8. (115) SeeEnneads, V. 5.1; cf.

A priceless documentation of such a state of mind is found in the following passage from chapter 8 of book VII (V) in which he has occasion to refer to the extremely complex structure of the sefirotic processes within Adam Kadmon as described by Hayyim Vital:117 "I shall not deal with the interior and exterior kelim or vessels (vasos ynteriores y exteriores)exteriores) nor with their surrounding-assisting and penetrating lights (sus(sus(sus lumbres circumdantes assistentes y pénétrantes) nor with their nefesh or soul (anima),(anima), ruah or spirit (espiritu) nor with other particulars because I shall mention them further below with an exposition and explanation. In my present situation of doubt, puzzlement and wide option (de présente recela, la la confusion y largueza) it remains to entreat (suplicar), as I humbly do, Him who opened up the Red Sea118 and gave highroads and passage (carreras y transito)transito) to his people that He in his clemency and goodness may open for me an entry and path (entrada y caminos) so that I can grasp and explain (alcançary(alcançary explicar) the hidden secrets and mysteries (los encubiertos secretosy misterios)misterios) which our Haham presents to us in enigmatic words (con enigmaticaspalabras),enigmaticaspalabras),enigmaticaspalabras), and this to the end that his Divine greatness manifest itself and that the Cabala or theological and mystical tradition (reception theologicatheologica y mistica) be within the grasp (alcançable) of contemplative and pious men, it being a truth (verdad) that to the majority of them is an occa sion of doubt and a stumbling-block on account of the corporeal veils and metaphors in which it is enwrapped. This is the case for almost all because of the sublimity (alteza) and difficulty of the expressions (sentencias) which exceed the ordinary and less abstract understanding (los ordinarios y poco abstractosabstractos entendimientos) and do not conform to any opinions discussed today."119 One senses that this prayer was uttered in a moment of truth when the difficulty of his enterprise dawned upon Herrera. Whether or not the prayer was but a rhetorical device is a moot question. It is always some what alarming when a philosopher stops at a critical point and turns to prayer.120 Herrera's invocation of the Divine miracle that divided the Red (117) See Shacar Hahakdamot, 4-6; Mevo* Shecarim, I, 1-2; II, i, 1-6.

(( 120) Moses Mendelssohn did this once in his Jerusalem (Gesammelte Schriften, III, Leipzig, 1843, pp. 304 f.) but in his case this was merely a rhetorical device since he obviously had the answer to the perplexing question ready.</page><page sequence="26">342 ALEXANDER ALTMANN [26] Sea could signify merely the proverbial expression kashe kekeri'atyam suf, as if to say: I am faced with a very difficult problem. What is made abun dantly clear, though, is his conviction that the corporeal images of Lurianic Kabbala are to be understood as metaphors of abstract truths, a methodological approach for which he could find warranty in the kabbalistic sources themselves.121 The measure of his success in dealing with some of the imagery concerned may be illustrated by the way in which he tackled the Lurianic motif of the two sets of Sefirot alluded to by the terms nefesh and ruah in the passage quoted above. More precisely: These two terms correspond to Luria's distinction between the circular Ciggul)Ciggul)Ciggul) and rectilinear (yosher) shapes in which the Sefirot in Adam Kadmon are arranged.122 How, then, does Herrera explain this symbolism? A first attempt in this direction is made in chapter 7 of book VIII (VI): The circles (los circulos) represent his [i.e. Adam Kadmon's] life (su vida),vida), for, as Plotinus demonstrated, life is that which moving in cir cular fashion as it were from itself to itself (mouiendose casi cir cularmentecularmente de si y en si misma) differentiates itself as to its parts which are the ten Sefirot that are enclosed in the ineffable Name of the Tetragrammaton. . . . The straight line (el derecho) may signify the intellect (puede significar el entendimiento) of the said Adam Kadmon [being] the axis as it were of the circle which we interpret as the life and which as such establishes its movement, and connects and links the vital intelligibles (ayuntay ata los vitales ynteligibles) among them selves and with itself, and like a spontaneous and sure act (como acto momentaneomomentaneo y cierto) reaches its object at once and with straight and inflexible perfection."123 Herrera obviously understands Luria's nefesh and ruah as the two phases of life and intellect which, as we saw above,124 follow upon being or essence in the neoplatonic triad making up the second hypostasis. Having identified life with soul, he has no difficulty in applying to this entity the (121) See below, note 130. (122) Herrera gives as his source a Sefer Adam Kadmon, probably an early variant of the Derushe AdamDerushe AdamDerushe Adam Kadmon found in Shacar Hahakdamot. In Luria the distinction is introduced as an attempt at harmonizing the seemingly contradictory presentations of the Sefirot in kabbalistic writings; see Shacar Hahakdamot, shacar 4. (123) The Lurianic terms for the two kinds of Sefirot — used also by Aboab — are ciggul and [kav]yashar respectively. Herrera imaginatively draws on the image of the straight line also in the sense of the mystical motif of the sirât (khatt) al-mustaklm which is said to connect the Divine world with things below; s eePuerta, VIII (VI), 9. On this particular motif see my essay "The Ladder of Ascension," in: Studies in Mysticism and Religion presented to Gershom G.

What remains problematic is the equation of intellect with rectilinear move ment. Plotinus speaks also of intellect as circular in the sense of turning upon itself (Enneads II.2.3; II.9.4), and Herrera seems to have been con scious of the difficulty of assigning to intellect rectilinear motion. For, rather cautiously, he says: "The straight line may signify the intellect." He makes the best of the situation in that he posits the line as the axis of the circle and, furthermore, sees in it a symbol of the straight, unerring path of the intellectual process. This relatively clear and simple interpretation becomes more complicated, however, when we turn to chapter 8 of book VIII (VI) where Herrera reports a discussion on this very issue between him and Israel Sarug:125 I heard from the Haham Israel Sarug, my maestro, may he rest in peace, that by "circle" one has to understand a point (unpunto) which on account of its great subtlety is beyond comprehension (es ynalcançable)ynalcançable) and which, because it has neither beginning nor end, bears resemblance to the beginningless beginning and infinite end of everything and therefore is called "circle" in which [too] there is no beginning or end, yet in reality being a point, i.e. [the sign]yod. It includes many sparks or powers (muchas centellas ofuercas) like theyod which signifies the perfect and total number of ten, this being the cause why everything that proceeds from it is like it and ten. I con elude that this circle is not a reflexive or twisting line (1una linea reflexa 00 retorcida), as I had argued, and, consequently, the ground is removed from the question I had raised when I said that the circle could not be prior to the [straight] line, as had been taught by R. Luria, since circularity would imply an addition of a twisted, reflex ive entity returning upon itself to the presupposed [linear] being. For by assuming it to be a point, it is certain that it precedes the line and this view can be confirmed by the words of the very same Trea tise on Adam Kadmon (tratado de Adam Kadmon)126 where the circle is called nefesh or first grade of soul, and the line or derecho [is called] (125) It's possible that the discussion reported here took place in Ragusa where, accord inging to Puerta, VIII [VI], 6, Sarug answered the question he had raised (see IV [II], 3, Second Doubt) about the need for interposing mediating supernal worlds between Én-sof and creation, seeing that through self-limitation (zimzum) the lower worlds could have been pro duced without mediation. Sarug's reply was to the effect that Adam Kadmon, the colam ha-en sofsof and the colam ha^azilut were emanations of En-sof, not creations, and that they infused life into the lower worlds. Herrera made this doctrine thoroughly his own; see V (III), 9; VI (IV), 1; 3.

Concurrently, there becomes invalid another question which I raised by pointing out \h2Xnefesh, life, being the first procession and movement of the essence, extends itself in length (se estiende en luengo)luengo) and is comparable to the [straight] line preceding the circle, while the latter is comparable to intellect (interpreted as the equiva lent of ruah) which is the conversion (conuersion) of life upon itself and upon the essence, adding to the life — the line as it were — the reflexion upon itself in the shape of a circle that converts from itself to itself. All this is cleared up (se deshaze) when we compare thenefesh and the circle to a point and ruah to a straight line, the latter being nothing else but the procession and extension of the point. Here it is the assumption that intellect as the conversion of life upon itself more properly deserves to be compared to a circle, while life is but the extension of essence and more appropriately resembles a straight line that gave originally rise to questioning by Herrera. The solution to the appar ent anomaly is found in Sarug's interpretation of the circle as a mathemat ical point symbolizing nefesh and of the straight line as one capable of con version upon itself and thereby applicable to intellect. What remains con stant in the two separate and divergent accounts is the Plotinian-Proclean frame of reference. From the debate one gains the impression that it was Herrera who brought up the philosophical question and who saw in Sarug's doctrine of points127 a possible way of settling it.128 An entirely different approach is suggested in an earlier passage of the same chap ter129 where it is said that the concentric circles designated the differences between the genera (being, substance, body, life, sense perception, rationality), whereas the straight line represented the specific differences, i.e., the ascent from one species to the highest next to the first cause. In this fashion Adam Kadmon appears as the locus of the orders of all things (genera, species, individuals). The ease with which Herrera moves from one mode of philosophical interpretation to another is indicative of a non dogmatic concern which prizes variety of possible answers above clear-cut solutions. 4) The translatability of Lurianic Kabbala into a Platonic key is at its most elusive when, in the last book (X[VIII]) Herrera turns his attention (127) See note 112. (128) A further elaboration of the distinction between circular and linear Sefirot is offered in the sequel to the above passage.

Isaac Aboab was probably right when he interpreted the phrase to mean that only Kabbalists were capable of understanding this particular doctrine and all that flowed from it. As he put it in his idiomatic Hebrew: levad muvan miyehidemiyehide segula hacomdim besod hashem. Herrera undoubtedly included him self in this category and he made a brave attempt to extend his platonizing interpretation to matters of this kind as well. In this context he found it important to re-echo Vital's warning130 not to attribute a literal meaning to the anthropomorphic images found in Kabbala, be it Zoharic or Lurianic, bearing in mind that the corporeal language of the Bible too had to be understood in a spiritual sense:131 In order that there be obtained some distinct and intellectual sense (conocimiento)(conocimiento) of the metaphorical lights (luzes), vessels (vasos), falls (caydas),(caydas), restitutions (restituyciones) and accommodations (conciertos) ... it is necessary to assume that in emanative Divinity (en la DiuinidadDiuinidad communicada) there is nothing material or corporeal and that all that is said about it in such terms is similitude (comparacion) and metaphor (metaphora), even as is the case in sacred Scripture. There follows a series of definitions which makes it unmistakably clear that all the terms used and dramatic processes described bear an intellec tual connotation such as is characteristic of the neoplatonic view of things. Thus it is said of the "metaphorical keli" (vessel)132 that it signifies in the Divine realm (en los diuinos), i.e., in the two supernal worlds, which are the one of the Infinite and the one of emanation (3azilut), the intellectual sub ject (el sugeto yntelectual) or the potency of intellect which can receive the intelligible object and bring forth from itself the act of intellection. Similarly, 3or or light (luz 0 lumbre) is defined as symbol (simbolo) of the intelligible or truth obtainable through the intellect. Theנorpenimi or pen etrating and inner light (lumbre pénétrante y yntrinsica) is explained as an (130) In the early part of Shacar Hahakdamot. (131) Puerta, X (VIII), 9.

The °or makkif or surrounding and containing light (lumbre que circunday contiene) is said to be that intelligible which is beyond (excede) the grasp of the intellect, yet assists it from outside (assistiendo(assistiendo a el exteriormente).1 3י' In chapter 17 of book X (VIII) Herrera uses this platonizing view of Lurianic symbolism as the scenario as it were of his understanding of what the unions and mutual investments (acts of hitlabeshut) of the Sefirot are all about. The starting point of the discussion is the statement concerning the union of the Sefira Bina, the supernal Mother, with the lower seven Sefirot in order to facilitate their ultimate union with En-sof. This procedure is seen as necessary for the rehabilitation of those Sefirot after the breaking of the vessels, as a new birth through the purification of the vessels or intelligencies.134 Herrera points out in explanation that this notion is not far from the Platonists' view that our intellect arises from the supernal intelligible in two possible ways, analogically and formally, i.e., by pro ceeding from the caused to the cause and by becoming invested with the higher form and taking on its nature.135 He adds, however, that a perusal of the Arabic Platonists and the Christian scholastic theologians will show a disinclination on their part to admit the possibility of one emanated intelligence entering into a union of substance with another. Francis de Sylvestris (Ferrariensis)136 had suggested a compromise to the effect that a union (yllapso 0 penetracion) that could be affirmed was one between intelligibles, not between substances as such, a solution which Herrera considers inappropriate in the case of the supernal entities which form the subject of his discussion. What may be true of created beings need not be assumed in the case of the Sefirot that were not created but emanated, i.e., the Sefirot in the three supernal worlds. Here, he states without entering into any reasons, a penetration of one Sefira into another could be imagined without difficulty.137 Chapter 19 of the same book completes this line of thought by explaining the term investment (clothing). The phrase "one configuration (parzuph 0 contrapuesta) clothes itself (seà vestido 0 cubierto) with another" means that the higher unites with the lower, (133) Puerta, X (VIII), 9.

In this fashion the lower (the vestment) is perfected by receiving and containing the higher (the intelli gible object).138 For an explanation of the breaking of the vessels — a happening which Herrera regards as providential, not as a tragic accident139 — Plato's, not Plotinus's help is sought. Luria's myth which tells us that because of their weakness the seven lower Sefirot could not bear the supernal intelligible light reminded him of the famous Platonic motif of the soul's loss of wings (Phaedrus(Phaedrus 246 D ff.) which Plotinus had discarded (Enneads II.9.4):140 All this can be illustrated (se puede ylustrar) by that which the Plato nists teach (que dogmatizan los Platonicos), and is a kabbalistic truth (y es verdadverdad cabalistica): that our rational soul lost its wings and, falling from the heights, precipitated itself to the low,. . . and much more can be illustrated by what our maestro (Luria) affirmed.141 It is this motif of the "fall" that gives Herrera an opportunity to touch upon the Lurianic doctrine of the descent and scattering of sparks from the upper light and their ultimate gathering and restitution by means of the deeds of the righteous, leading to the eschatological union of the ShekhinaShekhina with her spouse and, finally, the integration of all the Sefirot with Adam Adam Kadmon and En-sof when new light will illumine and perfect all worlds down to the lowest. Yet this highly charged eschatological vision is not linked to the messianic concept, let alone to an acute expectation of imminent redemption. It remains within the orbit of an essentially mythical, i.e., timeless process. All Herrera has to say about it is that it signifies the mystery of the sacrificial cult. His essentially Platonic orienta tion clearly asserts itself in this neutralization of Messianism. In his Puerta del del cielo one looks in vain for any assumption that salvation was at hand.142 Ill We conclude this discussion with a brief review of the way in which Herrera treated the Lurianic notion of zimzum, transposing as he did even (138) The vestments are also said to mitigate the vehemence of the supernal light and to make it bearable for the lower worlds.

He deals with the subject first in book II (not included in the Hebrew version), where it forms proposition 2 and where, despite the purely kabbalistic frame of reference, it is already given a "metaphorical," i.e., philosophical, inter pretation. Yet his intent becomes clear only in book V (III) where the con cept of zimzum is offered as an answer to the philosophical problem (posed in book IV (II) how a finite perfect being (Adam Kadmon) could have emerged from the Infinite.143 The act of zimzum (encogimiento) is said to denote the self-imposed limitation of the light of En-sof which preceded the emanation of Adam Kadmon. As such it is an act of the Divine will and, seen from this perspective, zimzum becomes another term for the volunta ristic principle in the theory of creation. As Herrera puts it, "The infi nitely powerful, eternal and immense144 First Cause does not operate by the necessity of its nature but by the admirable counsel of its most wise intellect and by the free choice of its most merciful will and pleasure as to what it produces and governs outside itself' (la ynfinitamente poderosa, eternaeterna y ynmensa cauza primera no obra por la necessidad de su naturalezza, sino porpor el admirable consejo de su sapientissimo entendimiento y por la libre election de su su clementissima voluntady beneplacito 10 quefuera de si produce y gouierna).145 In other words, En-sof did not employ all its power in producing the worlds. Had it so willed, it could have produced "other far more excellent effects in other spaces and times that were more ample and extended" (otros(otros y otros effectos, mas y mas excelentes, en otros espacios y tiempos, aun mas y mas mas capazes y estendidos).146 This notion, Herrera pointed out, was nowa days followed by the peripatetics and scholastic theologians (V[III],1), and to back up this claim he refers to the discussions on creation by will in Maimonides, Averroes and Thomas Aquinas.147 In identifying zimzum with the exercise of the Divine will, Herrera obviously took his cue from the Lurianic formula keshecalah birezono hapashut shel En-sof lehad'azil colamot,colamot, zimzem et zazmo . . ., which he paraphrases: "When the First Cause willed to emanate and produce the universe, it limited itself' (quando quiso la la cauza primera comunicarse y produzir el universo, se recogio de si en .si).148 It cannot be said that the voluntaristic interpretation of zimzum (143)(!43) See above, p. 333.

The neoplatonic orientation to which he was committed required a further probing of the issue. Needless to say, he accepted, and faithfully reproduced, Luria's mythological portrayal of zimzum as an act by which En-sof contracted its light,149 withdrawing it as it were from the center to the circumference,150 leaving behind a sort of empty space151 — called awir kadmon152 — in which there was retained some portion of the light as a kind of residue;153 restricting the subsequent flow of emanation to a trickle by letting it pass through a narrow canal,154 and giving scope, at a still further stage, to a second act of zimzum within Adam Kadmon.165 The question was what these obviously metaphorical representations signified in neoplatonic terms. The same question may be addressed to Herrera's use of a Sarugian motif which he adopted into his account of the zimzum theory. We are referring to the doctrine of shicashuca or the Divine delight which Sarug had taken over, with some important modification, from Cordovero.156 According to Sarug, the transition from the pre-creative to the creative stage in En-sof entailed a stirring of Divine pleasure at the thought of delineating the worlds-to-be and the rules of justice (din) to be imposed. The pleasure amounted to an internal impulse or motion within En-sof from one part of itself to another as it were, comparable to the scintillation of light or to flashes of lightning.157 Herrera expresses this notion some what differently by putting the emphasis on an inner motion ad extra, characterizing as he did the sense of delight as one felt at the outward direction implied in the contemplated relationship of En-sof to beings other than himself. In his own words: "This going forth as it were (este casi salir)salir) from itself, which is infinite, to another, which is and should be finite, is the shicashuza or sort of movement (casi mouimiento) which — though interior and completely identical with En-sof itself — seems to differ from it and to move and tend to another (parece que difiere de si y casi encamina y tiende a otro)."158 Herrera sees in this quasi movement within En-sof an (149) Puerto, V (III), 7 and passim.

It appears, however, that no one can give limit to what is outside of himself unless he first has it and holds it within him self.160 From this point of view the act of zimzum has the clear purpose of conditioning both En-sof and its effects for what is to follow, emanation and creation. While this concept is closely allied to the rabbinic doctrine of creation by both middat hadin and middat harahamim, it is hardly reconcila ble with the neoplatonic view which knows only emanation as a straight forward process. Herrera lays the groundwork for his ultimate interpretation of zimzum by presenting in the name of the Platonists and, especially, Pico della Mirandola the doctrine of the three grades of being: causal or eminent; formal or substantial; and analogical or participated. All perfections are contained in the First Cause in an eminent way, in Intellect formally, and in the intelligencies and souls analogically. This distinction holds good also for the three ontological levels of the Kabbalists.161 Thus will and intellect apply to En-sof not in a formal way but causally, i.e., En-sof is the source and cause of all determined, limited manifestations of will and intellect.162 The negation of attributes in the First Cause implies no defi ciency but expresses its superiority over all determined and limited sub stance and points to it as their cause.163 Herrera considers Plotinus as sharing this view.164 From here it is but a short step to Herrera's interpretation of zimzum as a metaphorical expression of the ontological distance between the causal and the formal, let alone the analogical, modes or grades of being. This is the viewpoint that prevails in his systematic treatment of the subject in chapter 12 of book VII (V) where no less than ten "considerations" (159) Ibid■ (160) Ibid. : mas a 10 que parece no puede dar termino 0 limite fuera de si, si no 10 ay 0 tiene primeramenteprimeramente en si misma.

(161) Puerto, VI (IV), ך (162) Puerto, VI (IV), 8. Hence Herrera has no difficulty in attributing will, i.e., will in the causal mode, to En-sof, whereas Fano draws a line between razon and ba'al harazon, the latter being assumed to be transcendent to En-sof (see his Sefer Pelah Harimmon ,IV, 2-4 and the discussion of his view by Joseph Ergas, Shomer 3Emunim, pp. 67 ff.).

This "objective potency" is nothing substantial, accidental or potential but, simply, the object of an infinite "active potency" (potencia activa)activa) that offers no resistance on its own part to becoming a limited effect. Clearly, the idea is to shift the emphasis from an inner-Divine self restriction to an outer-directed activity. 2) The self-limitation of the First Cause in producing finite effects is due to its intellect and will, not insofar as its intellect knows and its will desires itself according to its own immensity which cannot be participated in, but insofar as it is concerned with "that finite portion and deficient imi tation" in which the effect can share. Hence zimzum denotes the act by which En-sof relates its infinity to the limited future effects which its will produces outside itself. Again, it is outer-directed, and not, as has been suggested, a "withdrawal" or "retreat." 3) All being is contained and subsists in the first necessary and unlim ited Being and is a portion of it as it were, being more or less perfect in the measure in which it more or less participates in the Infinite. Hence the privation or negation of the Infinite by virtue of its finite emanation (con una una comunicacionfinita) is the cause of all effects. The privation or negation of the infinity of the First Cause is its zimzum and the emanation (comunicacion)(comunicacion) is the light Cor) in which the vacant space proceeding from zimzum zimzum participates and by which it produces its effect. In brief, inasmuch as the effect falls short (cae y dégénéra) of En-sof, it may be said that En-sof produced zimzum as if it took away from its effects what it did not give them but inasmuch as they participate in some portion, it may be said that En-sof En-sof infused them with that light which filled the vacant space. Hence the finite emanation of their natures or essences is the result of what they are lacking of En-sof and what they did receive. It is the infinite privation or negation, which constitutes one element in finite things, that is parabolically (parabolicamente) called zimzum. As Herrera recalls, Averroes too described finite beings such as the intelligencies as having a privative and a positive component. The interpretation of zimzum offered here is couched in purely ontological terms and reflects the doctrine of the grades of being mentioned above. Zimzum, in this view, is not an act of removal but the absence of giving. No "withdrawal" is involved.165 ( 165) The same notion is found in Moshe Hayyim Luzzatto's Sefer Kof-Lammed-Het Pitehe</page><page sequence="36">352 ALEXANDER ALTMANN [36] 4) Zimzum is a formula expressing the privative theory of evil. It is the distance of created beings from the First Cause that is responsible for deficiency, limitation, din or severity (rigor), not any positive act on its part, seeing that it is pure goodness, hesed and grace. 5) En-sof causes all things inasmuch as it is none of them but infinitely exceeds them. Negations of particular perfections in£n-50/"imply no pri vadon or deficiency in it but point to its superiority (excessosy ventajas) and eminence by virtue of which it produces the very things that are denied of it. This negation of attributes in the uncaused En-sof can be called its zimzum,zimzum, i.e., the exclusion of all determined, formal being from the causal grade. 6) In this very intriguing passage Herrera makes a bold attempt to come to terms with some more specific features of the Lurianic myth of zimzum.zimzum. He does so from an eminently neoplatonic point of view. He first recalls the Plotinian notion of the simple unity and self-sufficiency of the One from which only unity might have been expected to emerge. Thus the problem as to how multiplicity could have arisen is squarely posed. The three ways in which unity is multiplied (by difference, matter and separation) are not applicable to the One. "And this is what the divine ascanaziascanazi (Luria) set out to explain (pretende) when he pronounced that in the beginning, i.e., prior to all and eternally, there was one pure and infi nite light, the unlimited necessary being (serpor essencia), which is the First Cause, and afterwards, by means (mediante) of its zimzum or self-limitation (encogimiento)(encogimiento) there remained a kind of vacuum which he calls auercadmon ((awir kadmon) which in my opinion (que a miparecer) is the first essence pro duced and, as the most perfect one and as the measure as it were (casi metro y y medida) of all others it contains them like a universal place that embraces and comprehends all bodies." In this view ,zimzum is understood to be not an act of withdrawal but of creation. It creates a vessel of a spiritual nature which serves to provide, on the implied analogy of matter as a principle of individuation or multiplicity, the very first means by which the uniform light of En-sof was diversified. Herrera uses the simile of the uniform light of the sun that is refracted into many colors by the receptacle through which it passes. Zimzum therefore means the creation of the first essence as the receptacle for the subsequent emanation from the infinite light of En-sof.En-sof. That light represents the undifferentiated unity of En-sof as refracted and quasi multiplied through awir kadmon. What resulted from the infusion of the light into the vacuous space was Adam Kadmon. After the first act of creation by zimzum, the second act (emanation) added exist Hokhmah, Warsaw, 1888, pp. 32 f. Luzzatto may have taken it from Herrera.</page><page sequence="37">[37] LURIANIC KABBALA IN A PLATONIC KEY 353 ence to essence. What this genesis of Adam Kadmon implies is more fully explained elsewhere:166 He is a composite of the finite (zimzum) and the Infinite (emanation), of multiplicity and unity. The zimzum theory is inte grated into a neoplatonic framework. 7) Drawing on Julius Caesar Scaliger's De subtilitate,167 where the effects of the First Cause are said to be necessarily similar and dissimilar to it, Herrera sees the same dialectic expressed in the symbolism of zimzum and emanation, the one denoting the dissimilarity, the other the similarity of created beings to the First Cause. 8) Amplifying the previous consideration: All that is produced by the First Cause is a composite of multiplicity and unity, multiplicity being symbolized by zimzum, unity by the light of emanation from En-sof. g) The same dialectical pattern is repeated on an even more sophisti cated scale when Herrera depicts, in magnificently Plotinian accents, the contrast between two types of infinity, the negative one which shuns and excludes all finitude and belongs to En-sof, and the privative one which craves finitude, form and perfection and is the property of prime matter and all being in potency and lacking perfection. Inasmuch as En-sof in its "absolute sublimity and eminence" is separate and remote from all limit and proportion and relation to things outside, there proceeds from it, as its shadow as it were (casi sombra) some universal potency and indigence falta),falta), i.e., its counterpart which is privative infinity; but inasmuch as the Divine infinity relates itself to its future effects by various modes of ema nation (por varios modos de comunication), there arise the existencies and forms which limit and perfect the undefined, imperfect essence called privative infinite like rays of light. "And this, in my opinion, is signified by zimzum zimzum or the self-enclosure (encogimiento) of En-sof that, while removing and restricting itself in its infinity which excludes all limit (todo termina), it produces the undetermined but determinable first essence of the supreme effect, i.e., the infinite insofar as it lacks limit and is deprived of it, and on the other hand the light for) which is subsequently infused is the existence, second act and perfection by which its perfect cause limits, forms and perfects it." Far from being a mere withdrawal into itself, zimzum zimzum is seen here to serve the purpose of calling forth the privative infinite, the "shadow" of En-sof, hence to have an active role ad extra assigned to it, notwithstanding the fact that it denotes the self-enclosed and purely inwardly orientation of the negative Infinite which is the causal mode of being. This is a paradoxical thought of stupendous mys (166) Puerta, VIII (VI), 7.

The First Cause is not merely the efficient, formal and final cause of all things, on which they depend for their production, essence, conservation and effica cious operation, but it also works in them by an interior presence that fills them totally. What they are, have the power to do and actually do comes from that presence of the Divine in them. We may, therefore, say that inasmuch as the First Cause exceeds all else, it is in the state of zimzum, self-enclosure, being retired as it were in the abyss of its infinity and secluded from all, but inasmuch as it emanates (comunica) to all, it is totally the cause of all and is in all by the infusion of its light. Here again the dia lectic of zimzum and emanation is understood to be nothing else but the expression of an ontological tension between the causal and the formal grades of being, between the Infinite and the finite. It is not seen as an actual act of withdrawal followed by the outward flow of emanation. The Lurianic imagery is held to depict the timelessly real, not a one-time dra mafic, happening. Zimzum denotes the utter transcendence of En-sof, while the emanating light signifies the actual immanence of En-sof in all things. The two concepts complement each other and point to one single act: the presence of the Infinite in the finite. It is, thus, the notion of the Divine immanence in all things that, in Herrera's view, offers the key to the meaning of zimzum. Without trans cendence there can be no immanence. Zimzum is the precondition of creation, and Herrera insists that it is emanation which constitutes exist ence. Essences are but imperfect shadows of the One, while existence is the One in action. In an attempt to define emanation (VIII[V],3), Herrera says that emanation or irradiation (assiluth) signifies the bringing out of one thing from another (eduzir una cosa de otra) and as such is difficult to explain. Theologians and philosophers had said little or nothing about it, and the Kabbalists (nuestros sapientes) had overlaid the truth with "their customary enigmas and metaphors." He was going to say what Divine inspiration would teach him (10 que el Senor nos ynspirare). Emanation was not, like creation, the bringing forth of something from some essence in the way in which form is hatched in the matrix of matter that itself is deprived of form. En-sof contained the emergent not like a vessel, space, substrate or support but as an active, substantiating and perfecting force which continued to keep the thing produced in existence. The emanation as such was but the passive recipient of the Divine power, not perfecting anything but being itself perfected, not giving but receiving, like a preg</page><page sequence="39">[39] LURIANIC KABBALA IN A PLATONIC KEY 355 nant woman giving birth, by virtue of the infinite power of En-sof. One wonders how much of the original intent of the Lurianic concept is retained in this platonizing account, except that due recognition has to be given to the emanationist element in the Lurianic doctrine itself. The famous simile of the mitigating and filtering of the Divine light through distance, windows and veils which Herrera (VIII[VI],18) reports from what seems to have been a Lurianic homily (derush) under the title shemesh umagenumagen hashem (Ps. 84:12)168 is essentially a variation of the neoplatonic portrayal of the gradual lessening of the light flowing from the Divine source. (168) This homily is found in Fano's YonatElem, ch. 13 andKanfe Yonah, 2a. It goes back to Moshe Yonah'sKanfe Yonah, MS. Sassoon 993, fol. gr ff. (OhelDavid II, p. to 19). It is akin to the use of the simile of the sun in Joseph ibn Tabul's Derush Hefzi bah, 1c, in: SeferSimhat KohenKohen by Mascud Hakohen A1 Haddad, Jerusalem, 1921.
