THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF JAINA ISLAND, CAMPECHE, MEXICO Donald McVicker Professor Emeritus, North Central College, 30 N. Brainard, Naperville, IL 60540 Abstract Despite the recognition by many scholars of the high esthetic value of Jaina-style figurines, they present a number of analytic problems. Their functions remain obscure, and their role in Late Classic period Maya society has not been adequately examined. Throughout southeastern Mesoamerica, with few exceptions, all figurines and fragments are found in domestic contexts, mostly trash heaps; on Jaina, most examples come from graves. This article addresses the question of Jaina exceptionalism. It places its unique features in the broader context of Terminal Classic political and economic developments that were sweeping across the northern Maya Lowlands. Here I argue that the use of figurines in domestic rituals determined their appropriateness for placement in a particular grave, rather than the age, sex, or occupation of the deceased.

Fortunately she had shared her data with Corson, who was writing his Ph.D. dissertation on Jaina figurines in the 1970s. In 1964, as part of the search for objects to enhance the ceramic collections for the new National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City (Benavides 2002a; Arqueología Mexicana 2003), another 400 burials were excavated. Only the best figurines were exhibited and published, and they became the data for reconstruct- ing “courtly life.” When the two-month 1964 dig was finished, the Mexican expeditions had cleaned out a total of nearly 1,000 burials in less than 25 years (Piña Chán 1985:158). Despite this number, Aveleyra Arroyo de Anda and Ekholm (1966) “conservatively” esti- mated that 20,000 graves remained. In the twenty-first century, contemporary archaeology finally reached Jaina.

This latter figurine leads Miller and Martin (p. 175) to wonder, “who would have chosen such a compa- nion in a tomb?” Schele and Miller (1986) chose 22 figurines, including three ballplayers, to illustrate their text for Blood of Kings. They commen- ted that perhaps these ballplayers were defeated by the deceased and in memoriam placed in their graves. Unfortunately, no evidence for a correlation is given. In fact, ballplayer figurines are found in graves of infants as well as adults. The essential question is whether or not all the characters the authors list were present in royal courts on Jaina and, if they were, what roles did they play? Table 1 summarizes named statuses and roles appearing in the literature. Although there has been frequent identification of multiple social roles and statuses represented by Jaina-style figurines, little attention has been paid to frequency of presumed occupational specialization. Miller’s (1975:61–62, Appendix I) compilation of 278 figurines is primarily based on gesture and clothing. However, her more specialized types are worthy of further consider- Figure 5.

Halperin (2009:387) believes that she has identified a widely distributed set of molded ruler figurines that also appear with some frequency on Jaina. These all wear fan-shaped feathered headdresses that typically included zoomorphic or supernatural heads perched just above the individuals’ faces—most commonly “war serpents.” In Jonuta Group B (Corson 1976:67–72, Figure 24, 200) the figurine busts are seated on thrones decorated with pseudo-glyphs (Figure 12a). These headdresses are also commonly found on “mummy bundle” figurines carried on palanquins (Corson 1976:196, Figure 20, “Jaina Group O”). The base of these structures is pierced by two round holes into which miniature poles may have been inserted. A subtype of these miniature full figures appears to be seated at the entrance of an elite structure also pierced by round holes. Either these models represent a lord on a palanquin or perhaps the deceased carried in procession to his grave (see Figure 12b). All of these figurines suggest a close association with mortuary rituals. Noting the distribution of figurines on Jaina, Foncerrada de Molina (1988:25) concludes that “funereal figurines were probably not destined for the elite in power, but rather a middle level powerful Figure 6.

By con- THE FUNCTION OF FIGURINES/A NEW trast, Halperin (2009:389) finds that the ruler figurines in her INTERPRETATION sample from Motul de San José occur in both elite and commoner residences. The traditional interpretations of Jaina figurines have focused on stylistic categories and uncritical acceptance of European models for Maya courtly culture. The new interpretations are based on the functions of figurines in the broader context of Jaina Island society during the Late/Terminal Classic period. They give full attention to the “lives” of the figurines. The major challenge to interpreting figurines from Jaina in terms of their functions for producers and users is that we only have their final context, their entombment. Howmany transformations in func- tion took place when they were produced and used in their original cultural context is poorly known. Their final disposition clearly does not mark their meaning as participants in daily rituals. What they represent in daily life may be far removed from the cultural choice of putting one or more in graves. This can be as misleading as placing a figure from a Nativity scene in a grave as a symbol of Christian fidelity. As Schele remarked more than a decade ago (1997:17), “... the people of Palenque used figurines in religious rituals involving both their temple and their house.” She went on to note that the figurines probably served the same purpose as Santos today, and the figurines were used to construct scenes. Later, when she discussed a particu- larly graceful figurine from Palenque now missing his bench (Schele 1997:80–81, Plate 25) (Figure 12c), she speculated that perhaps this figurine was “once part of an assemblage that laid out the members of the man’s court much like the palace scenes Figure 8.

Minimally, the magical role of figurines acts to the role of the figurine in the social group. As they state, in individual rituals for the living should be considered.

Archaeologists also uncovered numerous figurine fragments that had already been dis- carded as refuse and in other domestic contexts. As is true of other lowland Maya sites, almost no figurines were found in burial contexts (Triadan 2007:285). Many figurines were incom- plete, but Triadan found no consistent pattern of breakage. The fact that on Jaina various figurines excavated from burials are broken and missing parts probably indicates that they, too, had been used in domestic rituals. Unfortunately, if there was a program of breakage, it is not known. As Delgado observes (1965:15), “Se hicieron [las figurillas] tanto para uso en la vida como para acompañar a los muertos, puesto que muchas de las fig- urillas asociadas con esqueletos se encontraron con miembros o tocados rotos o perdidos, tal vez representando pertenencias favor- itas del muerto.” (author’s translation: They made [the figurines] as Figure 10.

Even at major sites only a few thousand people lived in the confines of the settlement and the burials number in the hundreds. Furthermore, if Jaina supported a food producing population there was not a lot of space for them and their gardens. Conversely, if the majority of the residents were devoted to non-food producing activities, from where did they import their provisions? When all the excavated data are reviewed, Benavides Castillo’s hypothesis that the living inhabitants of Jaina Island were the primary burying population bears further investigation, particularly if Jaina was a functioning residential city and not just a commercial and ceremonial center. Jaina’s civic architectural complexes, sculp- tural images, epigraphy and other site features indicate that its resi- dent population was stratified. The extent to which its population was stratified is less clear from the contents of the graves as is any variation of intermediate elite or sajalob. What is clear is that Jaina possessed a locally specialized burial cult that remains unmatched at other contemporary Maya sites. It may be that the other western coastal sites, Isla Piedras and Isla Uaymil, shared in these burial cult practices which are similar to ones reported from Figure 17.
