<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GOSSIPING TRIREMES IN ARISTOPHANES' KNIGHTS, 1300-1315' In the antepirrheme of the second parabasis of the Knights, the leader of the chorus of knights reports a conversation that he overheard of some gossiping triremes. The triremes had assem- bled, like gossiping women, to discuss their concern about the plans of Hyperbolus to send an expedition of one hundred ships against Carthage (1300-15). Scholars have generally regarded this an- tepirrheme as a comic aside arising in part from the coincidence that trireme is a feminine noun. The point of this aside would be to mock a new leader of the radical democrats. The triremes' attack on Hyperbolus is consistent with the general tone of the second parabasis, which is made up of a series of personal attacks against the usual suspects, well-known public figures and the leading poli- ticians of the day (1264-1315).2 But it is noteworthy that there are parallels between this passage and the antepirrheme of the first parabasis. There, in praising the enthusiastic service of the horses of the knights, the chorus leader personifies these horses as rowers in the navy (595-610). The parallelism of these personifications suggests that lines 1300-15 are more than an incidental joke, and that the criticisms of Athenian politics are to be understood as thematically linked.3 Aristophanes exploits the stereotypical as- sociations of women with gossip to introduce a female perspective on the outlandish policies of Athens' boldest leaders.4 The "fe- male" criticism of Athenian political leadership answers the as- sertion of the traditional martial values of the chorus of knights in the previous antepirrheme. When read together, the two passages ' I am indebted to Dennis Kehoe, John Rauk, Peter Bing, and the two anony- mous CJ referees for their helpful criticism and suggestions. 2 Lysistratus and Thumantis are ridiculed in the ode (1264-73); Ariphrades is reviled for lust (1274-89), and Cleonymus for greed in the antode (1290-99). 3 Pohlenz 1952: 121-22 and Landfester 1967: 79-82 briefly note thematic paral- lels between both parabases, but neither discusses the trireme passage in any detail. 4 Women were commonly perceived as inveterate gossips (Semon. fr. 7.10, E. Ph. 198-201, Ar. Ec. 120, Th. 393). In the Peace Aristophanes goes so far as to por- tray cities, T-r6AEts, because they are feminine nouns, as incessant talkers (539-40).

ANDERSON connect the criticism made by the gossiping triremes into a larger issue of the play, namely, that reckless imperialism threatens Athens' social fabric.' To set the scene in the antepirrheme of the second parabasis, the triremes come together to take counsel (EiS A6yov, 1300) about the proposal. The elder of the group, a trireme described as yEpacIMTpa, reports that Hyperbolus is seeking authority to launch one hundred of their own number on an expedition to Carthage. Ad- dressing her young companions as TrapeivoI, she asks indignantly (1302-04):6 o8rE T'UVOe6VEGOE T TT', lrrap0IvoEt, TV TiV TTr6XEI; poaati aiTE'iOOai TIV fl'..IV EK'aTOV Ei~ KappXr86va, avSpa oX6Tpp60v TroXiTTv, 6iv'rlv 'Y-ippoXov"7 Didn't you girls hear about the business in the city? They say someone is asking for a hundred of us to sail to Carthage, a no-good citizen, that sour-puss Hyperbolus. One of the triremes, who had not come near a crew (&amp;v~pcyv, 1306), declares her resolve never to serve under Hyperbolus. In- stead, she announces a plan of action. She says that she will, if she must, let herself grow old right where she is, rotted by ship- worm, before serving under him (1307-08):8 dTroTp6oTat', o0 ViT' IpOU y' &amp;p5El TROT', &amp;XX' 6av IE XP'i, uTrO TEprl06vov oorTEarEO EVTaOa KQTayTIpaaoOI.P. SThe personified triremes are not opposed to imperialism-they are after all its main tools. Rather they reject expansionist adventures such as the conquest of Car- thage, cf. Pericles' policy to take care of the navy and not seek to extend the empire during the war (Th. 1, 144.1, 2, 65.7). For the dependence of Cleon and his sup- porters on triremes to enrich themselves and force their will on allies, see lines 312, 1071, cf. Meiggs 1975: 322. Triremes are mentioned elsewhere in the play at 279, 555, 1073-74, 1185, 1353. 6 We are to imagine the triremes assembled as if for public debate, FUVEXOEIV Eil A6yov, with the elder trireme serving as a senior speaker of the assembly (cf. LSP, s.v. yEpat6?). This line of thought, i.e., women holding a quasi-political assembly, is more fully developed in the women's assembly of Thesmophoriazusae (where the target is Euripides' corrupt drama). 7 The text is that of V. Coulon 1923. All translations are my own. 8 TEprlSchv was an especially destructive kind of ship-worm (cf. Thphr. HP 5, 4.4, with Morrrison, Coates, and Rankov 2000: 186). The Paphlagon's threat to appoint the Sausage-seller trierarch of an old ship whose sails are rotten oarrp6v (918) may anticipate this passage.</page><page sequence="3">GOSSIPING TRIREMES IN ARISTOPHANES 3 Another member of the company, identifying herself as Nau- phante, daughter of Nauson, likewise refuses to serve in the expe- dition.9 Nauphante then proposes that they all sail to the The- seum or to the Shrine of the Venerable Goddesses and seek asylum (1309-12).10 On behalf of her companions, she concludes (1313-15): o0 yap 1qlC,)v yE OTpaQTrrlyCv EYXVEITTI T] T UOEl" xX~x TrTXEiTCO Xcop) a(t aTO E K6paKas, Ei OOUXETat, TC( OKq)pa, EV Ql ETC.XEI TOUA X)XVO0U, KQOEXKOCaas. He won't mock the city by being our commander, that's for sure, but let him push off to hell by himself, if he wants, sailing those tubs he used for selling his lamps. The proposal ascribed to Hyperbolus seems to take Athens' im- perial ambition to its logical and most extreme conclusion. To be sure the Athenians had in 425, the year before the play, sent an expedition of forty ships to Sicily (Th. 4, 2.2)," and it is clear that they had been harboring imperial ambitions in Sicily and the western Mediterranean for some time (cf. Th. 3, 86.3-4).12 We do not know whether the reference in the Knights is to a real proposal by Hyperbolus to send a new expedition to the west. But in the Knights, conquering Carthage would represent the fulfillment of Athens' most extreme imperial ambitions. Accordingly, the Slave asks the Sausage-Seller in the prologue: "How could you not be happy? Just cast your right eye toward Caria, and the other one toward Carthage" (172-74).13 Caria and Carthage both lie just be- yond the limits of the Athenian empire. Of course, if Athens did have serious imperial ambitions regarding Carthage, they were 9 Nauphante ("Ship Shape") is probably a comic invention rather than a real name of a trireme (cf. Sommerstein 1981, ad 1302). The name of her "father," Nau- son, is attested as a slave's name at Athens (405 BC, IG i3 1032, 275). "1'The Theseum was a well known refuge for fugitive slaves (Plu. Thes. 36.2, cf. Ar. PCG 111.2 fr. 577), and by "fleeing" there the triremes would be seeking not so much freedom as escape from their tyrannical master, Hyperbolus, cf. K. A. Chris- tiansen 1984: 23. The shrine of the Semnai was an especially august sanctuary for suppliants (Th. 1, 126.1, Paus. 7, 25.1; cf. Ar. Th. 224). " These forty ships were sent to reinforce the twenty ships the Athenians had sent to Sicily in 427 (Th. 3, 86.1-4). 12 Certainly at the time of the Sicilian expedition of 411 Sicily could be viewed as a step on the way to conquering Carthage. Thucydides ascribes these very ambitions to Alcibiades in his discussion of the planning of the Sicilian expedition in 415 (6, 15.2). 13 TrTCO oUv o0 [IEyaXWO5 EUbatpOVE15 ETI VUV TOV 60p6aXp6v rraprpaXX' Eis Kapiav TOV 8E16V, TbV 8' i TEpOV EiS KapXnr66va.</page><page sequence="4">4 CARL A. ANDERSON never realized. In any case, Hyperbolus did emerge as a leader of the radical democrats after the death of Cleon and held that role until he himself was murdered on Samos during the oligarchic coup of 411 (Th. 8, 73.3). In this passage then, the seemingly unmoti- vated introduction of gossiping triremes underscores the utterly am- bitious nature of Hyperbolus and other Athenian imperialists. The personification of the triremes as female gossips presents many topoi."1 Many of these relate to older and younger women and further enliven the whole scenario. The gossiping triremes call to mind scenes of Athenian women gossiping with their female neigh- bors. Like older women, who could serve as sources of information for their young counterparts, the older trireme asks her seemingly naive young companions: "Didn't you girls hear about the business in the city?" (1302)." Her question suggests that she is privy to the latest news and the "person" through whom such news would nor- mally pass. The indignation of the two maiden triremes, empha- sized by the repeated denial, o00 ijT', "no way" (1307, 1309), as they hear the report, stresses their high spirits and their sense of outrage at the news. The ships are, of course, gathered together in the water, but water, in particular, wells, provided communal gathering places for women to gossip and exchange information."1 We need only recall the women in the Lysistrata drawing water from the wells (327). In this instance, it would seem, we are to imagine the triremes as gathered at their communal center, around the ship sheds and harbors at the Piraeus, to chat about affairs of the moment.17 But the use of personified triremes to make this joke serves a larger purpose by introducing a new perspective into the comedy, 14 Aristophanes is certainly familiar with the comic potential for personification of naval craft, cf. Peace 626-27 (triremes eating fig branches) and the lost play Hol- cades PCG 111.2 frs. 415-43 (which featured a chorus of personified merchant ships and attacks on Cleon [see Arg. A3 in Peace, II 2 p. 3, 29 Holw.]). It is worth noting that "holcades" is likewise a feminine noun and is used metaphorically (and with sexual innuendo) of women, cf. Asclepiades Anth. Pal. 5.161 = 40 G-P (with Gow's note ad loc.). Furthermore, many of the technical terms used to describe parts of Greek ships correspond to human anatomy, e.g., 6op6aXioi (Ar. Ach. 95-97); ~nETrribET (E. IT 1350, Th. 7, 34.5); XEipaS (Tim. Pers. 5-6); robEr (Ar. Eq. 436). For these and other anthropomorphic terms for ship parts, see the general indices in Morrison and Williams 1968, and Morrison, Coates, and Rankov 2000.

Women exercise no direct influence over political decisions at Athens, but they can affect popular opinion and the general reputation of Athens' leaders. They exercise such influence as they do in the sphere of gossip, where public opinion was nourished and disseminated."1 Of course, Athenian men also gossip. Indeed, Eupolis portrays Hyperbolus himself as gathering information by loitering in barber-shops and playing dumb (PCG 5 fr. 194).19 But while men have many other avenues for expressing views about Athenian politics, Athenian women are mainly lim- ited to one, gossip.20 This is the only speaking role, such as it is, for female figures in the play.21 As such it provides the poet with an opportunity to underscore the perils that unrestrained imperial- ism presents to Athens' future. Whether Athenian women actually shared these sentiments is unknowable, but by having women voice them, albeit indirectly, Aristophanes gives the audience the op- portunity to reflect anew on the implications of the policies of Ath- ens' most ambitious imperial leaders. When the triremes express their views about Hyperbolus and his policies, they enunciate a perception of him that could not be voiced as effectively by male characters. This is so because the tri- remes are not simply talking ships. They are potential wives and mothers, the very people on whom the future of Athens obviously depends. The poet makes the ships women, Athenian women. Two of them are -rrap6Bvot, and they imply that they are from respect- able families: Nauphante names herself by her patronymic: "s Discussion of how gossip functions as an informal means of social control to reinforce or challenge social norms can be found in Gluckman 1963: 308, Spacks 1985: 43, Bailey 1971: 1-25; see also de Boulay 1974. On gossip and the formation of repu- tation in ancient Athens, see Hunter 1990, especially 299-304, 1994: 96-119, Ober 1989: 148-151, Lewis 1996: 11-23. '9 Athenian men typically engaged in gossip at barbershops (Ar. Av. 1440-41, Lys. 24, 20, Men. Sam. 510-13) and perfume markets (Ar. Eq. 1375-76, Pherecr. PCG VII fr. 70, cf. Buxton 1994: 11-12). 20 Most scholarly work on gossip in classical Athens has focused on gossip as a means of social control of women (e.g., Hunter 1994: 116). But gossip afforded women both an identity based on their social network (cf. Dem. 55, 23-24, 27, with Gould 1980: 49) and also allowed them to exercise a degree of social influence (cf. McClure 1999: 56-62). In a discussion of female characters as vehicles for social commentary in Attic comedy, Henderson remarks (1987: 129): "Removed from the world of men, they could be mouth pieces for observations and advice that, if cred- ited to male types, might produce anxiety and resentment rather than laughter." Here it is not simply a question of anxiety and resentment. Instead, by assuming the role of women, the triremes suggest how the unbridled military policy of Athens democratic leaders will threaten the future of the city. 2" The only other female figures are the mute Spondai, whom Demos ogles at the end of the play (1389-91).</page><page sequence="6">6 CARL A. ANDERSON "Nauphante, Daughter of Nauson" (1309). Aristophanes plays on the virginal status of Nauphante's companion "who had not come near a crew" (i.e., she had not yet been taken to sea). The language that Aristophanes uses here evokes her virginal status through the association of 6vSpc~ov (crew) and 6v8p6S, (man/husband, 1306).22 The elder trireme herself is presumably wise from her many cam- paigns. Her characterization as yEpaIT~pa, a term that is not ap- propriate for an old trireme, underlies her personification as an elderly women (1301).23 Moreover, the plan of action that one of the virgin triremes proposes suggests one type of power that women could exercise, that is to bear children-the very power the women eventually will exercise in the Lysistrata to affect public policy. Indeed the verb KXTayprldXoYopat is used only of humans (i.e., not of ships), and here amounts to a declaration of spinsterhood on the part of the speaker. Not only will she not submit to marriage, o0i 8T' OiloO y' dipEti TrOT', but she also will grow old, presumably without producing children.24 If Hyperbolus gets his way, then, there will be no new generation of triremes to take on fruitless ex- peditions for Athens' irresponsible leaders and, by implication, no new generation of Athenian soldiers. The antepirrheme of the second parabasis works with the an- tepirrheme of the first to present two sides of Aristophanes' criti- cism of current Athenian political leadership. In the first paraba- sis, the chorus first stresses the link between triremes and seaman- 22 This observation is made by Sommerstein 1981, ad 1306. Another aspect of the joke is that the ships, while virginal, are also being compared to prostitutes, who themselves are often likened to ships in the literary tradition. Anth. Pal. 5, 204 com- pares the body of Timo to a worn-out ship that can no longer endure "the strokes of Cypris' rowers," while in Anth. Pal. 5, 44, two whores adopt as noms de guerre the names of ships, Lembion and Kerkurion. A fictional dialogue between philosophers similarly compares a courtesan to a ship that has many passengers; cf. D. L. 2, 74 = Ath. 13, 588e. Note also that anrrp65, which is mentioned in connection with ship- worm at 1308, is a term often applied to aging prostitutes, cf. Ar. Ec. 1098, where the courtesan Phryne is described as aaTrpa, as are the crones who are portrayed as predatory prostitutes (cf. also Ec. 884, 926, Hermipp. PCG V fr. 9). Moreover, the term TEPT-v6CO used by Nauphante's companion at 1308 is the name given to the pimp-auletris played by Euripides at the end of Thesmophoriazusae (1175). For the association of nautical imagery and terminology with sexual congress, see Henderson 1991: 164-65. 23 In the naval inventories for the five year span of 377/6 to 373/2, "old" and "new" triremes are designated by the terms Trarhata and Katlv respectively (IG ii2 1604-1608). 24 KaTayrlpaco denotes age in human beings and not inanimate objects (cf. LSJ s.v.). The life expectancy of a trireme is estimated to have been about twenty years, Casson 1971: 90, Morrison, Coates, and Rankov 2000: 199-200.</page><page sequence="7">GOSSIPING TRIREMES IN ARISTOPHANES 7 ship and horses and riders in the invocation of Poseidon (551-64), and then heaps praise on the bravery of past generations (EClhoylOal, 565).25 In lines 595-610 of the antepirrheme, which corresponds to our passage, the chorus leader both praises the knights' horses (irraiviaal, 595) and personifies them as human sailors who urge each other to "take up their oars" (602) and to "pull harder" (603) as they row their transports toward enemy ter- ritory. This language and imagery along with the emphasis on the common interests of knights and the navy, i.e., the horses and the triremes, are echoed in the second parabasis where the chorus leader heaps abuse on corrupt politicians (Notiopfaica, 1274), and where the gossiping triremes urge collective action against Hyper- bolus. Because the consequences of Hyperbolus' policies are "un- bearable" (dvaoXET6V, 1305), the triremes cast him as someone who ought to be excluded from power. The Paphlagonian-Cleon was utterly defeated in the scene preceding this parabasis (1248-52). Now, the declarations of the talking triremes, in effect, call for the defeat and dismissal of Hyperbolus, paving the way for peace treaties and the heroic rejuvenation of Demos in the clos- ing scene.26 Thus we can see that, far from being a mere opportunity for a casual joke, the personified triremes perform a role that is integral to the design of the comedy as a whole and to the political message that Aristophanes elaborates in the Knights. In the antepirrheme of the first parabasis the chorus celebrates traditional martial values through the personification of the horses as eager sailors. In the antepirrheme of the second parabasis, the personified triremes attack the extravagance and corruption of current leaders whose irresponsible policies threaten Athens' security and well being. The correlation moreover of the horses in the first antepirrheme with the triremes here also entails class associations: the knights and their horses are aristocratic, whereas the triremes are manned by the demos. Accordingly the two passages reflect a union of po- litical classes against the policies of Cleon and Hyperbolus. The knights, the navy, Demos, Poseidon, patron of horses and the sea, and Athena, patron of the city, and the women of Athens are united together in their opposition to the likes of Cleon and Hy- 25 On Poseidon's patronage of horses and riders, sailors and ships, and of the poet himself whose career is described in nautical terms at 541-46, see Hubbard 1991: 80-83. 26 In the last reference to Hyperbolus in the play, Demos vows to throw him, suspended from the neck of a corrupt politician, into the Barathon (1363).</page><page sequence="8">8 CARL A. ANDERSON perbolus.27 Through the solidarity of these groups the security and vitality of the city are assured. Aristophanes clearly understands the value of using a female voice to articulate and affirm commu- nity values.28 The women's point of view seen briefly here in Knights 1300-15, moreover, may be seen to anticipate the poet's fuller treatment of the female characters in two of his greatest plays, Lysistrata and Thesmophoriazusae.29 CARL A.

This is the earliest example of the genre in Aristophanes. 29 The personified triremes are not developed characters, and so tell us little about the representation of female figures on the comic stage in 424. However we can already see that these trireme-women display stereotypical female concerns (sex and marriage) and have some facility with language and argumentation. These fea- tures are developed in the female figures that appear as "real women" in the Lysis- trata and the Thesmophoriazusae in 411 (cf.
