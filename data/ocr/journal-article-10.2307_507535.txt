THE "INTIMATIONS" OF WORDSWORTH'S ODE BY HERBERT HARTMAN LIKE others of his Fenwick Notes (dictated in I843) Wordsworth's own commentary on his celebrated Ode is inaccurate and misleading, if not indeed evasive. The poem, he noted some forty years after its inception, was composed at Town-End, Grasmere, and two years at least intervened between the writing of stanzas I-IV and of the remainder, V-XI. It " partly rests," he continues, on particular feelings or experiences of his own mind: in childhood the notion of death could not invade his " sense of the indomitableness of the Spirit within [him] "; he looked for an Elijah-like translation to Heaven; to his child's nature external things lost all objective identity, and he would timorously recall himself from the " abyss of idealism to the reality." An universal idiosyncrasy of childhood, he treats this in the Ode as a " presumptive evidence of a prior state of existence "-but not, he protests (in reply to certain critics), as a belief. It is too shadowy for faith, being only an element in the instinct of immortality. However, he concludes guardedly, there is nothing to contradict it, although revelation is wanting; thus the notion of a pre-existent state is an item of many popular creeds, and an ingredient of Platonism itself. Hence the poem on the ' Immortality of the Soul "has sufficient foundation in humanity for its projection by a poet as hierophant. An addendum to this familiar note has been found in his state- ment 1 that the poem is not " a literal representation of the state of 1 To his nephew Christopher Wordsworth (Memoirs, ii, 476). 129 9</page><page sequence="2">R. E. S., VOL. 6, 1930 (N9 22, APRIL) the affections and of the moral being in childhood," but rather his own feelings, his absolute spirituality, his " all-soulness " at the time -when he could not believe that the body would moulder into the dust of the grave. These explanations and disclaimers the world (of Wordsworthians, at least) has long considered as the poet's honest but caviling gloss on his great Ode. But they continue to invite inquiry, and to suggest, in view of modern research, an entire re-consideration of the poem. Who, for example, led Wordsworth-whose confessed medium was (in 1798) " language really used by men "-into such metaphysical speculation ? By whose agency did he attempt here for the first time the Cowleyan form of stanza ? And who actually came trailing clouds of glory before him as he wrote, serving as an incarnate model for this universal idea ? Recent studies 1 have found the answers to all these questions in the persons of S. T. C. and his infant son "li'le Hartley " Coleridge. Coleridge's connection with Wordsworth's Ode is quite clearly established, but the story requires re-telling with necessary amplifications. On Friday, March I9, I8o2,2 Coleridge-after some four months of London and Davy's lectures " to increase his stock of metaphors " -took his not untrodden way from Keswick to Dove Cottage, Grasmere. The Wordsworths found him " half-stupefied " with ill-health and dejection; his shaping spirit of Imagination was, he himself confessed, woefully failing.3 But before he retired for the night he disputed with Wordsworth about Ben Jonson,4 whom the poet and his sister had been reading. The following snowy day, Dorothy records, "William and Coleridge walked. . . . We had a little talk about going abroad. After tea William read The Pedlar. Talked about various things-christening the children, etc." 6 The 1 E.g. Garrod, Wordsworth (I927 ed.), ch. viii; also John D. Rea, Mod.

C. had long held mixed metaphysical views on the baptismal ceremony, finally overcoming his Godwinian contempt for the " sprinkling " sacrament (by 1832 he had come to consider the service as "almost perfect "). To understand, however, the views occasioning this discussion with Wordsworth, we must return in time to the arrival of Coleridge's first-born, six years before. Hartley's birth, in September I796, provoked three sonnets from the logician, metaphysician, father. " Annihilated " by the sudden- ness of the news, S. T. C. (then in Birmingham with Charles Lloyd) retired to his room to address his Maker.2 He then wrote the sonnet When they did greet me father, sudden awe Weigh'd down my spirit, . . . a giving vent to his confused thoughts and shapeless feelings, praying that the overshadowing Spirit descend on his babe and he be born again "a child of God." Journeying homeward (with Lloyd) to see his new-born infant, he composed a second sonnet, of which the first draft reads: Oft of some unknown Past such Fancies roll Swift o'er my brain as makes the Present seem For a brief moment like a most strange dream When not unconscious that she dreamt, the soul Questions herself in sleep I and some have said We lived ere yet this fleshly robe we wore. O my sweet baby I when I reach my door, If heavy looks should tell me thou art dead, (As sometimes, through excess of hope, I fear) I think that I should struggle to believe Thou wert a spirit, to this nether sphere Sentenc'd for some more venial crime to grieve; Did'st scream, then spring to meet Heaven's quick reprieve, While we wept idly o'er thy little bier ! 4 Here certainly is an early intimation of immortality-from recollections of early parenthood; and the source of Coleridge's 1 Hartley, b.

In his letter to Poole (enclosing the sonnets) S. T. C. explained: Almost all the followers of Fenelon believe that men are degraded Intelligences who had all once existed together in a paradisiacal or perhaps heavenly state. The first four lines express a feeling which I have often had-the present has appeared like a vivid dream or exact similitude of some past circumstances." 1 Coleridge's conviction then, via F6nelon, is the doctrine of anamnesis, or Reminiscence, the belief that Heaven lies about our infancy- which is a period to be spent, in turn, on this nether sphere as in a prison-house to which the spirit is sentenced. The third sonnet (addressed to Lloyd), which followed soon after, Charles ! my slow heart was only sad, when first I scann'd that face of feeble infancy,2 drops from the level of neo-Platonism to that of personal reflection. Coleridge confesses, on seeing the child, a parent's remorse; soon, however, he was " thrill'd and melted "-and " all beguil'd of dark remembrance and presageful fear." For the time being there are no further "intimations." But ten days after Hartley's birth, S. T. C. (a confessed " library cormorant " now " deep in all out-of- the-way books ") asked Thelwell to get him Item 4676 in the book- seller White's catalogue: " Iamblichus, Proclus, Porphyrius, etc., one shilling and sixpence, one little volume." 3 This volume, a 1 MS. letter cited by E. H. Coleridge, ed. Poems, i, 154, n. I. Fenelon (I65I-1715), Archbishop of Cambrai and author of Teldmaque, has variously been called a sentinlentalist, a mystical saint, an eighteenth-century philosophe, an ultramontane churchman, an hysterical hypocrite, and a borrower from con- temporary prdcieuses. His Christian neo-Platonism is apparent in the following passage : " Platon enseignoit aussi la Intempsycose, qu'il avoit prise de Pythagore, et ensuite tourn6e a sa maniere, comme on peut le voir dans ses dialogues intitules Ph/dre, Phcedon, Trime et autres. Quoique Platon ait fait un fort beau dialogue sur l'irnmortalite de l'ame, cependent il est tombe sur cette matiere dans de grandes erreurs, soit par rapport h la substance de l'ame, qu'il croyoit compos6e de deux parties, l'une spirituelle et l'autre corporelle; soit par rapport A son origine, pr6tendant que les ames dtoient preexistantes aux corps, et que, tirdes du ciel pour animer successivement differents corps, elles retournoient au ciel apres avoir tte6 purifiees; d'oi, au bout d'un certain nombre d'ann6es, elles 6toient encore employees i animer successivement diff6rents corps ; de sorte que ce n'etoit qu'un cercle continuel de souillures et de purifications, de retours au ciel et de retours sur la terre dans les corps qu'elles animoient .. ."-(" Vies des Anciens Philo- sophes" (Plato), CEuvres, ed.

Meanwhile other intimations came to the awed metaphysico- theologico-parent. Hartley's birth caused emendations of an earlier " effusion," the lines To An Infant written in 1795; they were slightly altered to apply to " yon sweet Child," concerning whom he addresses the " thrice holy Faith ": O thou that rearest with celestial aim The future Seraph in my mortal frame.... Still let me stretch my arms and cling to thee, Meek nurse of souls through their long Infancy 1 a It is obviously an image, an anthropomorphic idea to be met with later in Wordsworth's Ode. Coleridge's son again invades his verses in the well-known lines of Frost at Midnight (published 1798), but the poem is personal and prophetic rather than neo-Platonic. Then the next year brought an event which was to stir S. T. C. to the depths of his metaphysical soul-the death in MIarch of his ten-months-old second child, Berkeley. From Germany he wrote painfully to Poole: " This bodily frame is an imitative thing, and touched by the imagination gives the hour which is past as faithfully as a repeating watch. But Death-the death of an infant-of one's own infant. . . . My baby has not lived in vain. . . . Consciousness !-it is no otherwise nccessary to our conceptions of future continuance than as connecting the present link of our living with the one immediately preceding it; and that degree of consciousness, that small portion of memory, it would not only be arrogant, but in the highest degree absurd, to deny even to a much younger infant. 'Tis a strange assertion that the essence of identity lies in recollective consciousness. . . . Oh, this strange, strange, strange scene-shifter Death !-that giddies one with insecurity and so unsubstantiates the living things that one has grasped and handled ! . . ." 3 And two days later he wrote consolingly to his wife: " I will not believe that it [i.e. life] ceases-in this moving, stirring, and har- monious universe-I cannot believe it! . . .

S., VOL. 6, 1930 (N9 22, APRIL) life of my own baby, how short it seems I but consider it referently to non-existence, and what a manifold and majestic Thing does it not become ! What a multitude of admirable actions, what a multitude of habits of actions it learnt even before it saw the light ! and who shall count or conceive the infinity of its thoughts and feelings, its hopes, and fears, and joys, and pains, and desires, and presentiments, from the moment of its birth to the moment when the glass, through which we saw him darkly, was broken-and he became suddenly invisible to us ? . . . I confess that the more I think, the more I am discontented with the doctrines of Priestley. He builds the whole and sole hope of future existence on the words and miracles of infants-only because according to his own system of materialism he has not discovered how they can be made conscious. But Jesus has declared that all who are in the grave shall arise-and that those who should arise to perceptible progression must be ever as the infant which He held in His arms and blessed." 1 Now doctrines of this sort-of pre-existence in a paradisiacal state, of metempsychosis, of degraded Intelligences sentenced to earthly expiation, of ultimate Seraph-hood, of infant memory and " recollected consciousness," of guarantees of immortality-these rarely sprang full-armed from the brain of S. T. C. Eclectic meta- physician that he was, the scent of neo-Platonism clings to most of his gospels, much as borrowings from exotic travel literature invade his poetry.2 Here again, then, as we have his own acknowledgment of debt to Fenelon, we appear to find another source in Proclus.3 It has been suggested that the volume of " Iamblichus, Proclus, Porphyrius, etc." sent by Thelwell at Coleridge's request in 1796, at length found its way to Dove Cottage in June I802; and several entries in Dorothy's ournals support the assumption. On Thursday, 1 Ibid., 284-287. The letter concludes with his verse " On an Infant, who Died before its Christening "- Be rather than be call'd a Child of God I 2 Lowes' Road to Xanadu is, of course, a triumphant piece of Quellenforschung in this latter connection. ' Cf. Rea, 207-209, who cites Dorothy's ournals: June Io, " Coleridge came in with a sack full of books." June 13 (the day after S. T. C. left), " William observed that the full moon, above a dark fir grove, is a fine image of the descent of a superior being " (Trailing clouds of glory do we come "). June 17, " William added a little to the Ode he is writing." And Proclus has this telling passage: " Descensus animae in corpus seiunxit quidem illam a divinis animis, a quibus intelligentia, et potestate, puritateque implebatur. Coniunxit vero generationi, et naturae, materialibusque rebus a quibus oblivione, et errore, et ignorantia est imbuta "-which has the full implication of Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting, etc. I34</page><page sequence="7">THE "INTIMATIONS" OF WORDSWORTH'S ODE 135 May 6, she records: " When we came in we found a magazine, and review, and a letter from Coleridge, verses to Hartley, and Sara H." The verses mentioned may have been the " Answer to a Child's Questions " on bird-songs,l but far more likely they were the well- known lines: A little child, a limber elf, Singing, dancing to itself- which form the " Conclusion to Part II " of Christabel 2-of which the MS. version was sent in a letter of Southey of May 6, i8oI,3 exactly a year before. This brings the infant Hartley, now almost six years old, again on to the scene. Six days later, May I2, S. T. C. walked over, and the " three persons and one soul" talked until one o'clock in the morning (Dorothy and her " dear dear Coleridge " continuing until a quarter-past two). The next day, Thursday, found Coleridge departing. On Friday, " William very nervous. After he was in bed, haunted with altering Thie Rainbow." On Saturday came a melancholy letter from Coleridge. And on Tuesday Dorothy left for his home at Keswick; the following day she and S. T. C. met Wordsworth near the six-mile (i.e. halfway) stone; and that evening they parted, to be joined again by Coleridge on Saturday-when they had " some interesting melancholy talk about his private affairs" (probably the impending breach with Mrs. Coleridge). Then on Monday Coleridge left for home. But the next few days were sleepless ones for Wordsworth; and he tired himself out with " hammering at a passage." 4 Obviously it was a season of poetic fertility for these Lake Poets. The almost daily interchange of visits, interfusion of spirit, and interplay of ideas between them (Dorothy was the prose poet of the triune group) was manifestly in operation, as it had been a few years before in the Lyrical Ballads. Coleridge's next appearance in person was on Thursday, June Io, when-after having been attacked by a cow-he brought in the above-mentioned sack full 1 Poems, i, 386. 2 Ibid., 235-236. First printed x826. a Letters, i, 355-356. The lines follow the remarks: " Dear Hartley I we are at times alarmed by the state of his health, but at present he is well. If I were to lose him, I am afraid it would exceedingly deaden my affection for any other children I may have." In conclusion, he calls the lines "A very metaphysical account of fathers calling their children rogues, rascals, and little varlets, etc." In any case the lines sent to Wordsworth were not, as Rea suggests, the sonnet(s) on Hartley's birth almost six years before. For by 1802 S. T. C. was no longer a poetaster; the Lyrical Ballads had appeared between ! 4 Dorothy's Journals have a lacuna from May 25 to May 28,</page><page sequence="8">R. E. S., VOL. 6, 1930 (N9 22, APRIL) of books; and he remained for two days. Exactly a week after his arrival, on Thursday, June 17, Wordsworth added a little to the Ode. He had begun it March 27, the day after finishing The Rain- bow 1 (which was later to be prefixed as a motto). One other item of indebtedness is to be inferred from Dorothy's 7ournals over the period. Tuesday, March 23, found Wordsworth reading Ben Jonson. Only a few days later, a "divine day " in Dorothy's record (as it proved to be for literature), he began-at breakfast-his first attempt in the irregular Pindaric ode, the famous "Intimations" stanzas. Had he, in this metrical experiment, found a model not for emulation so much as for a point of departure, in Ben Jonson ? Shortly before, we know, he had argued about Jonson with S. T. C. II Ben Jonson was, of course, the first to attempt an elaborate Pindaric choral ode in English, imitating not merely Pindar's rhythmical intricacies, but also, in his Morison lament, following the structural device of recurring strophe, antistrophe and epode. Like Congreve's and Akenside's,2 Jonson's odes (certain ones, that is) are strictly regular. Wordsworth's first essay in the field, on the other hand, is licentious and pseudo-Pindaric; for (as Hazlitt tells us) " the Ode and Epode, the Strophe and Antistrophe, he laughs to scorn." But on Friday and Saturday, March 19-20, Coleridge and Wordsworth had " disputed about Ben Jonson," walked and talked about " various things-christening the children, etc." On Tuesday, Wordsworth read Jonson again; and on Saturday, March 27, the immortal Ode was begun.3 Dorothy records the incubation of no other poems (and few escape the notice of her all- seeing eye) until April I6. But on Sunday, April 4, " I walked down to Coleridge's. Mrs. Calvert came to Greta Bank to tea. William walked down with Mrs. Calvert, and repeated his verses to them." This, Rea notes, is the same date exactly as S. T. C.'s own "Dejection" Ode.4 In all this, the interchange of visits, discussion of christening 1 Ibid., 104. ' Cf. Edmund Gosse, English Odes (188I). 8 Cf. Rea, 204: " (It is worth noting that Wordsworth, by his process of recollecting in tranquillity, often let just about a week pass between the first impulse to a poem and the time of putting it into verse)." 4 See letter to Sotheby, July x9 (Letters, i, 378-383), in which he quotes 11. x-i6, 21-72, 94-I25 in the earliest form. Cf. Poems, i, 362. 136</page><page sequence="9">THE "INTIMATIONS" OF WORDSWORTH'S ODE I37 Coleridge's children, neo-Platonic arguments (and possible loan of S. T. C.'s copy of Proclus), discussion about Ben Jonson, and striking identicality of date in the " Dejection " and " Intimations " odes- more than coincidence may be traced. For in their intermittent periods of personal contact the Lake Poets seldom worked indepen- dently. In the metrical similarity, in the personal interplay- Coleridge's apostrophe of Wordsworth, and the latter's use of little Hartley Coleridge in stanzas VII-VIII-and in the impelling kinship of mood-in all these is manifest witness of the collaboration that links the Lake Poets while keeping each singularly and happily sui generis. It is, of course, straining at a gnat to seek more than a superficial resemblance in the metrical form of Coleridge's " Dejection" stanzas and Wordsworth's " Intimations " Ode. Each, it is true, consisted originally of eight stanzas; 1 and in verse-length they are certainly more nearly alike than either is in accord with Jonson's Morison ode.2 And they agree, at variance with Jonson's, in the preponderance of pentameter lines and occasional internal, as well as final, Alexandrines. But S. T. C.'s point of departure is evident in his attempt to keep to. strict Pindaric division, until the process breaks down in its very execution; 3 for his " Dejection " poem, like the earlier Ode on the Departing Year-originally printed with Pindaric terminology-falls away into irregularity. Coleridge him- self accounted for this when he said, a few years later, The odes of Pindar (with few exceptions, and these chiefly in the shorter ones) seem by intention to die away by soft gradations into a languid interest, like most of the landscapes of the great elder painters. Modern ode-writers have commonly preferred a continued rising of interest.4 His interest in odes and odists was, of course, one of long standing; 5 1 Assuming the conventional break between V-VIII and IX-XI. 2 Coleridge's run 20o-8 (orig. 27)-8-I2-I7-18-32-14, Wordsworth's 9-9-17- 22-19-8-23-21. 3 Cf. R. M. Alden, English Verse (1903), 3I!. 4 Anima Poetee (? October 1806), 142. His preoccupation with metrics is well known. At Cambridge he preferred, by reference through Latin to Greek forms, Collins' odes to Gray's, finding " The Bard " defective and inferior in lyric feeling to Cotton's " Ode on Winter " (Biog. Lit., ed. Shawcross, i, 27 n.; Anima Poetee, 4; Table Talk, October 23, x833). Cowley's fantastic language charmed him (Biog. Lit., i, 15 ; ii, 66), while Ben Jonson's " smaller works are full of poetry " (Table Talk, June 24, I827). Wordsworth too, it is worth noting, considered Gray a failure (Letters, ii, 80), but had high praise for Collins (ibid., ii, 358). 5 He wrote Anacreontics a decade earlier (Poems, i, 33), and in 1791 he had composed mock-Pindarics (ibid., i, 21-22). But it was the true lyric ode that he came to admire for its subjectivity, and because " it delights to present things as</page><page sequence="10">R. E. S., VOL. 6, 1930 (N? 22, APRIL) and in his preference for the Cowleyan form he was obeying the dictates of his own nature, which was ill equipped for the " soft gradations," " languid interest " and metrical importunities of the strict Pindaric form.1 S. T. C., however, unlike his fellow-poet, had tried his hand at strophic measures; and his academic reverence for the form left its impress upon his dissenting practice. So if the two poets' argument about Ben Jonson referred to his odes, the inference is plain that Coleridge made a plea for the serviceability of the stricter form. Judged, however, by the immediate results- and it was a familiar Romantic controversy-Wordsworth's answer in emancipation proved to be a glorious instance of the triumph of poetry over prosody. Only one conclusion, then, may be drawn from the facts at hand: if their argument about Ben Jonson pertained to his odes, their respective stands on the matter bore fruit in the poems that followed. For one week later (March 27, I802) Wordsworth "kindled " and began his " Intimations " Ode, as licentious in form as it proves grandiloquent in effect; and by April 4, S. T. C. enclosed in a letter to Sotheby most of the stanzas of his " Dejection " poem, a " conversation ode" not entirely disencumbered of the strophic properties of the true Pindaric.2 Any further assumptions of metrical kinship are unsafe and impertinent; 3 it is on other scores that the companion odes have substantial points of contact. His own poem, Coleridge confessed, was written " during that dejection, to Wordsworth, and the greater part of a private nature, I thus expressed the thought in language more forcible than har- monious." 4 Indeed, when the poem appeared for publication 5 actually existing and visible, although associated with the past, or coloured highly by the subject of the ode itself " (Table Talk, October 23, x833). 1 Cf. Garrod, Coleridge, 184: "The debt of Coleridge to Cowley is much greater than is commonly realised," etc. 2 E.g. the rhyme-scheme of I and II begins abbacc, like strophe and antistrophe; then disparity sets in. 3 Rea, op. cit., 203, quotes part of the Morison Ode, suggesting that Words- worth's is "in cadence and phrasing reminiscent of this of Jonson, on the glory and radiance of youthful innocence." * Letters, i, 378. "That dejection" is explained above: "I wished [in translating the ' Erste Schiffer'] to force myself out of metaphysical trains of thought, which, when I wished to write a poem, beat up game of far other kind. Instead of a covey of poetic partridges with whirring wings of music, or wild ducks shaping their rapid flight in forms always regular (a still better image of verse), up came a metaphysical bustard, urging its slow, heavy, laborious, earth-skimming flight over dreary and level wastes," etc. 6 First published, Morning Post, October 4, 8o02, six months later.

Moreover, the following lines are omitted: This, William, well thou knowst, Is that sore evil which I dread the most, And oft'nest suffer.

Coleridge penned it with his "shaping Spirit of Imagination" at low ebb; the condition was evident to his friends on his return in the middle of March, and it became increasingly alarming to all three, as Dorothy's Journals reveal in the weeks that followed. Entries about agitated spirits, discussion of going abroad, William's ill health, walks and talks with or about S. T. C.-these come in rapid succession. Words- worth, it would seem, troubled with thoughts of Annette-on March 22 Dorothy and he resolved to see her, and then " that Wm. should go to Mary "-was not immune to the contagious mood of his fellow-poet.

He invokes (VII) the Storm-wind (" Mad Lutanist! ") and in its hush hears the cries of a lost child (? Sara); he invokes further the spirit of gentle sleep upon Dorothy, and (in the earlier version) craves the influence of Wordsworth's equanimity and love of " the immenseness of the good and fair." It is evident at once that certain elements of this jeremiad are interrelated with the " Intimations " Ode, with its query Whither is fled the visionary gleam ? Where is it now, the glory and the dream ? There is a verbal correspondence between the " Dejection "line There was a time when tho' my path was rough and Wordsworth's very opening There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream But the echo is farther to seek; it has a being in S.

Finally, as regards the companionship of the odes, when Wordsworth on April 4 " repeated his verses " to Mrs. Calvert and Coleridge, were they not stanzas I-II of the " Intimations " Ode begun eight days before ? For that very same evening 2 S. T. C. replied in echo: Yes, dearest poet, yes I There was a time when tho' my path was rough, The joy within me dallied with distress . , . -concluding with his apostrophe to this "friend of [his] devoutest choice." The identicality of date can scarcely be ignored.

T. C.'s firstborn. As Wordsworth's immortal sister informs much of Coleridge's poetry, so little Hartley Coleridge takes his place, on occasion, in the work of the future Laureate. Wordsworth's stanzas To H. C., Six Years Old belong both in substance and form, it has been noted,' with the " Intimations" Ode. Little Hartley, the " faery voyager" of the stanzas, was an universal darling of six in the year 1802, which dates the beginning, at least, of the Ode. And in rhyme-scheme the stanzas to him are unmistakably like the irregular Cowleyan measures of the greater work.2 Hartley, we shall see on examination, is in both the direct object of the poet's fond concern and natural apprehension. Substantially the Ode may be outlined as follows: The poet complains (I) that for him the common sights of earth have lost the celestial light, the glory and freshness of dream with which they were once invested; (II) the rainbow and rose, the moon and waters on a starry night, sunshine-all these remain; but a glory has passed away from the earth. In a sylvan setting (III) a thought of grief was dispelled by a timely utterance; henceforth the mountain echoes, the winds, land and sea, the beasts-all keep a May-time holiday; and a shepherd boy, Child of Joy, shouts round him. The poet's heart (IV) is with them in their jubilee; children are culling flowers and earth is preening herself, the sun shines and the Babe leaps from its Mother's arm-these he sees and hears with joy; but a lone tree in a single field again reminds him of something gone, and a pansy repeats the tale; the visionary gleam, the glory and the dream are gone. He moralises (V) that the Soul comes star-like from its home in God, neither innocent nor unmindful; so earth becomes a prison-house for the child-God having a purpose in the commitment-for youth is Nature's priest lured on by the vision splendid, which only man sees fade into the light of common day. Thus Earth (VI), the Mother and homely Nurse, would make her inmate Man forget his former home in God. In witness whereof (VII) behold this child of six at his parents' feet, with his own dream-world, an analogon to the world of fact; but this very child (VIII) is the true Philosopher, his heritage fresher for being a Seer more newly come from Eternity (while adult ways are 1 Cf. Garrod, Wordsworth (ed. 1927), x16; also Mary Joseph Pomeroy, Poetry of Hartley Coleridge, 15. Derwent Coleridge's Memoir of Hartley (Poems, xl-xli) assumes, but does not urge, the same conclusion. ' Especially in the initial quatrain and general distribution of couplets.</page><page sequence="14">R. E. S., VOL. 6, 1930 (N9 22, APRIL) darkened by the grave); why must this child of Immortality assume the burden, forfeiting its blessedness, becoming the prey of earthly cares and onerous custom ? Yet surely (IX) something remembers, for childhood delight and liberty give way to questionings and mis- givings,1 high instincts which are shadowy recollections from that first Soul-birth in God-these are eternal truths and ineradicable; thus inland the Soul has sight of that immortal sea on whose shore we are now but dabbling children. Let all then (X) rejoice in May- time gladness, that though rapture in the things of Nature passes, strength abides in what remains, faith that looks through death in maturer years with the philosophic mind. So the poet (XI) feels anew the might of natural objects, hills, groves, brooks, clouds- all take a light from the watching (and hierophantic) eye; hence the meanest flower has its eternal import, inducing " thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears." Such-its compelling music silenced by prose-is Wordsworth's gospel in the Ode, whose motto on-" natural piety " asserted " the Child is Father of the Man." Shorn of its grandeur, wanting the diapason of immortal verse, how homiletic it all appears! Yet Coleridge himself reminds us, in the Literary Remains, " How shall he fully enjoy Wordsworth, who has never meditated on the truths which Wordsworth has wedded to immortal verse ? " We have seen that the dejection of stanzas I-II was companioned by Coleridge's own ode on his impaired Imagination.2 But the affianced poems are essentially as different as the fellow-poets.3 For Wordsworth characteristically found relief (III) in a timely utterance,4 and a sylvan Maytime scene restored for the moment his 1 Cf. Poet. Works, ed. Knight, iv, 58. Godwin took the opposite view: "Nothing can be more incontrovertible than that we do not bring pre-established ideas into the world with us " (cited by Harper, x82). 1 Coleridge's reply seems implicit in the lines: O Wordsworth I we receive but what we give, And in our life alone does Nature live .... And from the soul itself must there be sent A sweet and powerful voice, of its own birth, Of all sweet sounds the life and element I O pure of heart I thou need'st not ask of me What this strong music in the soul may be I s " I rather suspect that somewhere or other there is a radical difference in our theoretical opinions respecting poetry."-S. r. C. to Southey, July 29, i8o2 (Letters, i, 387). 4 Possibly, Garrod ( x 3) suggests, the motto poems," My heart leaps up," begun the day before the Ode ; two months later, May 14, " After he was in bed, haunted with altering The Rainbow." The " timely utterance " may also have been a letter to Annette, written March 26, the same day as the lyric (cf. Dorothy's Journals). 142</page><page sequence="15">THE " INTIMATIONS " OF WORDSWORTH'S ODE 143 bliss-a recovery rarely apparent in the lifetime of the less buoyant S. T. C. But following the momentary bliss of III,1 the poet returns, in the conclusion of IV, this time interrogatively, to his opening motif, Where is it now, the glory and the dream ? It is at this point-from which Wordsworth in 1843 claimed a lapse of some two years in the composition-that the poet, Rea notes, merely feels the loss of youth's visionary gleam and seeks an explana- tion. As yet there is no statement of doctrine, of pre-existence or of innate ideas. If, then, S. T. C.'s arrival on June Io with a " sack full of books " spells the introduction of Proclus, the notion of pre- existence in V-VI is accounted for (" thou need'st not ask of me What this strong music in the soul may be ") and the chronology of those stanzas becomes established. There is certainly further pressing testimony. Coleridge remained for three days; the next day (June 13) Dorothy observed; " The full moon (not quite full) was among a company of steady island clouds, and the sky bluer about it than the natural sky blue. William observed that the full moon, above a dark fir grove, is a fine image of the descent of a superior being." And three days later, "A short letter from Coleridge. William added a little to the Ode he is writing." Thus the notion of the soul trailing clouds of glory (" Descensus anima " in Proclus) seems to date itself at this period-not, as the poet told Miss Fenwick, some four years afterwards. The doctrine appears to have come, vid Coleridge, from Proclus about June I802. Indeed, Proclus may plausibly be the " Pagan suckled in a creed outworn" of the famous sonnet written in the same year.2 One thing, however, is demonstrably certain-that the corporeal image introduced in stanzas VII-VIII to illustrate the doctrine advanced in V-VI, is the tiny son of Coleridge. Not only was little Hartley a precocious, dwarfed child of six at the very time,3 " A six 1 Dorothy's entries are telling clues to the substance of this stanza. May 4, " On the Raise we met a woman with two little girls, one in her arms." May 6, " It is a nice, cool, shady spot. The small birds are singing, lambs bleating .... When we came in we found a magazine, and review, and a letter from Coleridge, verses to Hartley, and Sara H." Again on May 22 (with S. T. C.), " We sat a long time under the wall of a sheep-fold. Had some interesting melancholy talk about his private affairs." And the children culling flowers in IV had elsewhere their setting, in " the poem of Children gathering Flowers "-April 28. The poem received the name Foresight. 2 Cf. Rea, 207-211, for this re-dating of V-VIII. s Originally " four," the change to " six " was made for the 1807 edition, for purposes of verisimilitude. Hartley was born September 19, 1796. " Lile Hartley " the dalesmen always called him because of his remarkably short stature.</page><page sequence="16">144 R. E.

This map (" some little plan or chart " of the Ode) is lost; but two " fragments from his dream of human life " remain: one, in Mrs. Coleridge's handwriting, cited by Der- went; the other, a letter from Sara Coleridge (i.e. again the mother) to Miss Barker, in the Harvard Library.2 Besides these relics, the little Actor's "humourous stage " is the subject of many fond anecdotes in the memory of his father, brother, uncle Southey, and friends.3 Thus the seven ages of man-and Dorothy records reading in As You Like It 4 on June 22-23 during another of S. T. C.'s visits-were thus passing "in endless imitation " before Words- worth's very eyes in the tireless chatter of his fellow-poet's six years' Darling.5 Re-read in this light the " Intimations " Ode takes on new meaning. For the alarming precocity of little Hartley gave the poet -who was not ordinarily interested in children 6 (rarely mentioning even little "Basil" [i.e. Edward] Montagu, the Wordsworths' 1 Cf. Derwent's Memoir in his edition of Hartley's Poems (I85I), xxxvi ff. Wordsworth's lines appear in a footnote in support of this " common instinct and trick of childhood." a Derwent cites "The History of St. Malo, an enthusiastic Reformer and Hierophant." " There were," he recalls, " many nations, continental and insular, each with its separate history, civil, ecclesiastical, and literary, its forms of religion and government, and specific national character." "Portfomandra" was the analogon to England. The Harvard MS. (Eng. 45*) is " a wild story, the history of an Ejuxrian" written out by Sara as amanuensis, dated Keswick, April Io, I8o8. It is the history of St. Malo in a later, elaborated form. The principal gods in his kingdom of Maza include Fanaticon, Ordanicus, Pomonia, etc. 3 De Quincey, for example, discusses Hartley's dream-world as contrasted with his own island of " Gombroon " (Introduction to the World of Strife). 4 Proclus' chapter " iEtates septem planetis septem congrue " seems to have been a " source " for Shakespeare in depicting the seven ages of man (cf. Philo- logical Quarterly, iv, 4 if.). Vaughan's "Retreat" has also been referred to the same, while the opening lines of his " Corruption " bear a disturbing resemblance to the Ode of our inquiry. I "t Their little boy Hartley," wrote Dorothy in September 800oo, " who is an original sprite, is to come and stay with us [i.e. at Grasmere]. He is a sweet companion, always alive, and of a delightful temper " (Letters, i, 126). Only one letter is preserved (Knight ed.) from the year I802. Mrs. Coleridge and Hartley came for three weeks in July x8oo (Journals, 43); while the Wordsworths went to Keswick inDecember x8ox (ibid.,68), and againin July i8o2 (ibid., I4). But the interchange of visits must have exceeded those mentioned. 6 Cf. Rawnsley, Wordsworthiana (ed.

Thus the verses To H. C. of the same period t (along with S. T. C.'s lines in Frost at Midnight and the Conclusion to Part II of Christabel) 2 must be read in conjunction with the great Ode, to which they are in some sort exegetical. For had the "Child among his new-born blisses" been other than the " exquisitely wild " darling of S. T. C., Words- worth's intimations of immortality may well have been quite different.3 For as they stand they were not so much recollected from his own childhood as witnessed in the precocity of his de- spairing fellow-poet's firstborn. Already the years were bringing their inevitable yoke, heavier indeed than frost, to bear on the yielding shoulders of the elder Coleridge; and Wordsworth with his dedicated spirit and consecrated powers was bound to see something of the taint in Hartley at the time. The stanzas in conclusion, IX-XI, a kind of coda to the symphonic Ode, were written probably (as Wordsworth claimed) some two years later,4 in a Maytime mood. By then Coleridge had somewhat recuperated from the abject melancholia, Sense of past Youth, and Manhood come in vain, of 1802 ; hence the conclusion of the Ode, a paan of optimism so far as the personal interrelationship is concerned, is a return to allegro. 1 (O 0 Thou I whose fancies from afar are brought " is quoted, Garrod notes (I16), by S. T. C. in Anima Poetce (I3) under March I7, I80o, although the poem is usually assigned to the year I802. 2 Along with, as Garrod further suggests, The Prelude, xii, 272-286, and the Ode composed upon an Evening of extraordinary Splendour and Beauty (818), 11. 6I-8o. 8 The sub-title " Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood " appeared (in seeming apology) first in the edition of March I815, when the motto poem was also first prefixed. In its earliest form the poem was simply an " Ode." 4 Rea suggests the plausible period December 18o6--February 1807, when S. T. C. and Hartley visited the Wordsworths at their Coleorton farmhouse. At the time Wordsworth was preparing his poems for the I807 edition (cf. Poems in Two Volumes, ed. Darbishire, 1914). At the same time (Anima Poetce (z8o6- 1807), 155) S. T. C. noted: "Aristotle's Works, and to hunt for Proclus." Seven years later Lamb (who records having heard Coleridge unfold the mysteries of Iamblichus and Plotinus as the "inspired charity boy" of Christ's Hospital days) wrote his oldest friend: " But I will not forger to look for Proclus. It is a kind of book which when one meets with it one shuts the lid faster than one opened it: Yet I have some bastard kind of recollection that somewhere, some time ago, upon some stall or other, I saw it. It was either that or Plotinus, 205-270 A.D., Neoplatonist, or Saint Augustine's 'City of God.' So little do some folk value, what to others, sc. to you,' well used,' had been the ' Pledge of Immortality' " (August 26, 1814: Letters, ed; Lucas, VI, 441. Cited in part by Rea, 213). Q1</page><page sequence="18">R. E. S., VOL. 6, 1930 (N9 22, APRIL) Again, to return to the " Six years' Darling," when Wordsworth dictated his Fenwick note (1843) Hartley had become, at forty-seven, the object of pity and charity-a familiar, unkempt, frequently besotted laureate of the dalesmen, living on the Wordsworths' bounty in close proximity at Nab Cottage. The Laureate wrote Moxon late in I842 : " I have done all that can be done for you in Hartley's case. ... It is, therefore, evident that you must trust nothing to him in future. He cannot be relied on for unperfected work that is to be done in a limited time." 1 In fact, his vagrancy and ale-house irresponsibility had become common district gossip; and he continued to " wander like a breeze," a wistful, gentle-hearted inheritor of unfulfilled renown. Yet to the humble cottagers he was the " cliverest man i' England as some say, and did a deal to help Mr. Wudsworth out with his poetry and all." 2 It is quite unlikely then that Wordsworth-who was only less well known among the people of Westmoreland and Cumberland-would identify Hartley for posterity as the " best Philosopher " of his Ode, who had in his gentle but wastrel manner so illy sustained the unkindly shocks prophesied in the stanzas To H. C. Coleridge's familiar protest (Biog. Lit., ch. xxii) against the "Intimations " Ode is certainly a warranted one. " In what sense," he asks, " is a child of that age a philosopher ? "-and he brings to bear (his old " metaphysical bustard" game) Spinoza, Behmen, Lessing, and others. tie further objects to the lines To whom the grave Is but a lonely bed without the sense or sight Of day or the warm light, A place of thought where we in waiting lie.'

Lambs, cataracts and winds find a place in the same entry, whence Rea (209-210) dates the composition of III-IV in the spring of I802. See also Wordsworth's Poems, ed. Hutchinson.

For such readers the sense is sufficiently plain, and they will be as little disposed to charge Mr. Wordsworth with believing the Platonic pre-existence in the ordinary interpretation of the words, as I am to believe, that Plato himself ever meant or taught it." 1 This was the reason, of course, for the poet's disclaimer, in having" given pain to some good and pious persons," that he meant to inculcate such a belief. It is, he apologizes, too shadowy a notion to be recommended to faith. Could it, we may ask in conclusion, have been otherwise-having come from S. T. C.'s lips in I802, through Proclus (earlier through F6nelon), who in turn looked back through Plato to Pythagoras ? In fine, then, without being a necessary item of either's creed the eschatological idea or doctrine embraced (rather innocently, we may conclude) in the Ode is just the sort of fond neo-Platonic speculation with which others of the Lake Poets' joint labours are sicklied o'er. The final effect, then, of the great Ode is such that Arnold con- sidered it declamatory, Lord Morley contrary to fact and partly nonsense; while Ruskin called it indisputable, Emerson " the high- water mark which the intellect has reached in this age," and Saints- bury signalised it as one of the greatest poems in English. Certainly the truth lies somewhere midway, for, as his latest biographer reminds us, Wordsworth's Ode is " a stumbling-block to prosaic and a temptation to over-speculative minds." 2 With the doctrine it advances and its source in the dark backward and abysm of philosophy, and with Wordsworth's persistence in or tergiversation from the concept,3 we have little right (and uncertain basis) to be further concerned. It should, however, contribute to an understanding of the motives and matdriel of the work to see how Coleridge's mood and companion poem of I802 interacted with Wordsworth's; to take into some account the preceding discussion of Ben Jonson; to 1 Cf. Wordsworth's comment to Mrs. Clarkson (? 1814) on the two recollections of childhood in the Ode, the passing splendour of objects of sense and the indisposi- tion to bend to the law of death (Letters, ii, 43). s Harper, Wordsworth, 445 " It is," he concludes, " the supreme example of what I may venture to term the romance of philosophic thought." 8 See the passage from The Friend (i8o9) cited by Harper, 448; also his preceding interpretation of the entire poem.

S., VOL. 6, 1930 (N9 22, APRIL) trace the influence on Wordsworth's listening ear of Coleridge's neo-Platonic speculations on pre-existence, degraded Intelligences and infant baptism; 1 and to find a model for the " Philosopher" of the Ode (it was, incidentally, Lamb's pet name for Hartley) in S. T. C.'s own precocious child. All these are far more deeply interfused in the poem than has hitherto been taken into account. " When I was impelled," Wordsworth dictated, " to write this poem on the Immortality of the Soul, I took hold of the notion of pre- existence as having sufficient foundation in humanity for authorising me to make for my purpose the best use of it I could as a poet." The notion is indeed, he admitted, too shadowy for belief; but his willing suspension of disbelief has served to inspire, if not to constitute, poetic faith in his readers-which no amount of clinical anatomizing can dispel. For under the lens of scholarship the poetry itself, the real vision splendid, can never fade into the light of common day. Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine, U.S.A. 1 Wordsworth's immunity to S. T. C.'s eclectic "preaching" (as Lamb stutteringly labelled it) is nowhere better stated than by Coleridge himself: " The thinking disease is that in which the feelings, instead of embodying themselves in acts, ascend and become materials of general reasoning and intellectual pride. The dreadful consequences of this perversion [may be] instanced in Germany, e.g. in Fichte versus Kant, Schelling versus Fichte, and in Verbidigno [Wordsworth] versus S. T. C.
