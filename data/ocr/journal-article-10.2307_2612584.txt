<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tibetan Foothold: By Dervla Murphy. London: John Murray. 1966. 206 pp. Index. 25s. IN July 1963, after a journey by bicycle from Ireland (described in a previous book),' Miss Murphy found herself at a loose-end in Delhi. She was in need of a rest and, at the same time, inclined to take up some voluntary work. Thus it was that she came to settle for a few months in the nursery camp for Tibetan refugee children which had been estab- lished at Dharmsala, in the Punjab hills, where the Dalai Lama himself had his headquarters. Many individuals and relief organisations are helping the Tibetans, but Miss Murphy soon found that aid was being greatly hampered by lack of co-ordination, and indeed open jealousy, between rival organi- sations. There was also the basic problem arising from the wide cultural gulf between Western helpers and those they sought to aid: what looked like an excellent scheme on paper to an American or European might well have a disastrous effect when applied in practice to a group of Tibetans. And some of the senior members of the Tibetan government in exile are not, it seems, altogether helpful. Although they maintain morale among the refugees their enthusiasm is not for integration (which must surely be the eventual aim) but for ultimate return to the homeland. However much we may deplore the present political situation in Tibet itself, it is certainly unrealistic to think in terms of a return to the old conditions. In any case no form of progress was possible under such a priest-ridden and medieval form of government. Not surprisingly, Miss Murphy soon acquired great affection for the young Tibetans among whom she worked. She writes lovingly of her charges and her account is full of common sense and acute observation. Although this excellent and very moving book is primarily concerned with 1 Full Tilt: 'Ireland to India with a Bicycle.'

It should certainly be studied by anyone involved in the distribution of aid money and all those who are interested in the welfare of minority communities within the so-called developing countries. I deplore only Miss Murphy's addiction to anthropomorphism, her coining of the words Tiblet and Tibland, and her statement (on p. 14) that in the old British days Indians were not allowed to walk in the streets of Simla. This, it need hardly be said, is nonsense. JOHN MORRIS.</page></plain_text>
