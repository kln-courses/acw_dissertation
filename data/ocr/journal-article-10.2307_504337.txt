<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA AWARD FOR DISTINGUISHED ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT MARGARET THOMPSON THE COLLEAGUE whom we honor today has greatly enriched our discipline, and this in various ways: as research scholar, teacher, administrator and, not least, through her own outstanding personality. A graduate of Radcliffe (1931), Margaret Thompson became an early staff member of the Excavation of the Athe- nian Agora (1937-40, 1947-49). Here she underwent an experience salutary for any young numismatist. Her first duty was to clean and identify coins as they came from the earth; almost all were of bronze, most of them heavily worn and many hopelessly corroded. Undaunted by this initiation Margaret Thompson undertook to publish a record of the Agora coins from the Roman through the Venetian periods. This early book (1954) already shows the qualities that were to mark all her subsequent publications: the ability to get on top of a large body of material (37,000 coins), to present her conclusions with the utmost clarity, and to make the numismatic evidence available also to the historian and the economist. From the Agora Margaret Thompson moved on to the American Numismatic Society (1949). As Curator of Greek coins and then for over ten years as Chief Curator of the ANS, she maintained and enhanced the high scholarly traditions of one of the world's great centers of numismatic studies. Following in the footsteps of a distinguished predecessor, Edward T. Newell, Margaret Thompson has done much to refine our knowledge of the mints of Alexander and the Seleucids. In preparing An Inventory of Greek Coin Hoards (1973) she again built on the work of an esteemed predecessor, Sydney P. Noe. Here, as so often in her career, she showed a remarkable capacity for fruitful collaboration with other scholars, in this case Otto Morkholm of Copen- hagen and Colin Kraay of Oxford. Of her most monumental publication, The New Style Silver Coinage ofAthens (1961), Margaret Thompson was the sole architect. In every respect a model of its kind, this great work has become the source book for our knowledge of one of the largest, most significant and previously most intractable coinages of the ancient world. Certain of the conclusions proved to be controversial, but the subsequent discussion has been conducted at a high level of civility, and has been more productive of light than of heat. As a talented and beloved teacher Margaret Thompson made a lasting impact on the careers of hundreds of students: in the Summer Seminars at the ANS, in her Graduate Seminar at Columbia University, and as Regents' Professor at the University of California at Berkeley. The affection of her colleagues, students and friends was concretely demon- strated by the presentation of a Festschrift on the occasion of her retirement from the ANS in 1979. The ANS was not the only beneficiary of Margaret Thompson's administrative competence. She was active in the Greek War Relief toward the close of World War II. For four strenuous years (1965-68) she presided over the Archaeological Institute of America. She also served long and loyally as Trustee, member of the Executive Committee and member of the editorial board of the AJA. Margaret Thompson has received many honors both in this country and abroad. She is a member of the American Philosophical Society and an honorary member of the numismatic societies of Austria, Belgium, France, Romania and Switzerland, as also of the Deutsches Archiologisches Institut. Her achievements have been recognized by the numismatic community through the two highest honors the profession can bestow: the Archer M. Huntingdon Medal of the American Numismatic Society and the Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society of Great Britain. Today, in recognition of the role that Margaret Thompson has long played in the advancement of archaeology as a humanistic discipline, the Archaeological Institute of America presents her with its gold medal. We do so with much pride and with not a little affection.</page><page sequence="2">POMERANCE AWARD OF THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA FOR SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO ARCHAEOLOGY HERBERT E. WRIGHT, JR. H ERBERT WRIGHT has pioneered in the use of palynology to enhance our understanding of the late Pleisto- cene and early Holocene environments of the eastern Mediterranean region. Wright first took pollen cores in the Iranian Zagros in 1960, a step which has led to increasingly reliable determinations of the climatic and vegetational circumstances of the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Within that time span came the transition from a hunting- gathering way of life to one of effective village-farming communities, thus setting the stage for subsequent urban developments. Wright's graduate work in Pleistocene geology was done under Kirk Bryan at Harvard. His Ph.D. was conferred in absentia, however, as he was already on his way to becoming the well-decorated pilot of a Flying Fortress in Europe. In 1946, at Hallam Movius's suggestion, Wright was invited to participate as a field geologist in the Fordham Uni- versity-Boston College excavations at the Ksar Akil cave in Lebanon. Southwest Asia has, since then, been one of his major areas of interest. In 1947, Wright joined the Department of Geology of the University of Minnesota, where he is now a Regents' Professor and Director of the Limnological Research Center. A member of the National Academy of Sciences, he has held Guggenheim and Wenner-Gren fellowships and was awarded an honorary D.Sc. degree by Trinity College, Dublin, in 1966. During field seasons with the Oriental Institute's Jarmo Project under R.J. Braidwood in the early 1950s, Wright realized that evidence for the sequence of Pleistocene-Holocene events was fragmentary in the Iraqi Zagros because of the high rate of erosion, perhaps in part due also to subsequent overgrazing and deforestation. Already acquainted with the useful results of palynological studies in Minnesota, Wright and his younger colleagues undertook coring for pollen sequences in the 1960s at Lake Zeribar, northwest of Kermanshah. The results of that important work, as well as several subsequent articles, have played a fundamental role in the development of theories related to the origins of agriculture in the Old World. Since that time, palynological investigations have multiplied in Southwest Asia. Wright also pioneered palynological research in Greece. His work with the University of Minnesota Messenia Expedition under W.A. McDonald in the Osmanaga Lagoon and elsewhere in the region of ancient Pylos later in the 1960s was among the first of its kind in that country. The vegetational studies of Wright and his associates in Messe- nia continue to be among the most thorough for any region of Greece and therefore form the basis for our understand- ing of the relationship between man and environment in the Aegean Bronze Age. Wright's contributions are not confined to the archaeology of the eastern Mediterranean. He is also well known to New World archaeologists for his work on the Paleoecology of the Upper Great Lakes area. The books he has co- authored with Cushing and Frey have long been standard references on the Quaternary, and his new two-volume series on the Late Quaternary environments of the United States is likely to be a standard for some time to come. The reconstruction of past environments and the interaction of man and environment through time have been subjects of increasing concern to archaeologists over the past 25 years. Herbert Wright has played a leading role in these de- velopments. His highly successful career and his many contributions to our present understanding of environmental and cultural history in both the Old World and the New World serve to remind all of us of the importance of collabo- ration between archaeology and the natural sciences in studying the past.</page><page sequence="3">322 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 The Eighty-Sixth General Meeting of the Institute was held in conjunction with the American Philological Association in Toronto, December 27-30, 1984. Summaries of the papers presented are given below in alphabetical order of the authors' names. TEXTILES FROM QASR IBRIM: A WINDOW ON NUBIAN CULTURE HISTORY: Nettie K. Adams, University of Kentucky For the past two decades, excavations at the Nubian site of Qasr Ibrim have produced textile remains in unprece- dented numbers. The 1980 season alone yielded more than 20,000 fragments. Covering a span of 2700 years, they range from the flax plain weave of the Egyptian 25th Dy- nasty, through the introduction of wool by the Romans and cotton by the Meroites, to the coming of silk in the medieval period with its attendant sophistication of weaving tech- niques. Faced with the double challenge of the varying quality and the enormous quantity of our material, we have found it necessary to develop special analytical techniques and procedures. These include an analysis and recording of each specimen, photography, drawing and minimal conser- vation for selected pieces. After five seasons of intensive investigation we have ar- rived at some broad understandings of the textile complexes from each period and their changes through time. Textile finds serve to illustrate the history of the site, reflecting the political, religious, social and economic factors affecting Nubia from Egyptian times to the recent past. A more de- tailed view of the microcosmic changes within periods is made possible by quantitative analysis. Applying the multi- dimensional approach which the special conditions at Qasr Ibrim permit, textile studies can be a sensitive indicator of conditions and can contribute to a better understanding of the life of the inhabitants of this ancient city.

Adams, University of Kentucky The dating of archaeological deposits by ceramic content is a familiar and time-honored practice. At the Lower Nu- bian townsite of Qasr Ibrim, ceramic dating has been car- ried to a degree of refinement and precision that has rarely been possible elsewhere. Qasr Ibrim was occupied continu- ously for nearly 3000 years, but most occupation deposits can be placed within a span of 50 to 100 years on the basis of their ceramic content alone. The combination of ceramic and stratigraphic evidence makes possible the dating of many deposits to within a generation. At Qasr Ibrim all potsherds from all excavation units are sorted and tallied according to a typology of 106 domestic and imported wares, most of which have been dated on the basis of historical associations. Raw tallies of wares present in and absent from each unit are converted into percentage data. Finally, percentage configurations for each unit are matched against a master chronology showing the fluctuat- ing frequencies of individual wares over time. The point of best fit between the ware percentage configuration of an in- dividual unit and the ware configurations shown in the mas- ter chronology provides a date for the unit in question. This paper describes the methodology employed at Qasr Ibrim and discusses some of its underlying theoretical as- sumptions. Among the latter are the appropriateness of a population statistics approach, the validity of the type con- cept, and the presumption of uniformity in refuse deposi- tion. Finally, the potential applicability of the methodology to other sites and areas is considered. TYDEUS AND ISMENE ON AN AMPHORA (LOUVRE E 640): Archibald Allen, Pennsylvania State University An Early Corinthian amphora (Louvre E 640) depicts a violent bedroom confrontation in which Tydeus, sword at the ready, is about to kill Ismene, still in bed, while her lover Periclymenos flees from the scene, pale and naked; the three are identified by name. Literary evidence, combined with archaeological evidence, suggests that K.J. Dover is mis- taken in thinking that Tydeus here is a furious husband about to kill his adulterous wife (Greek Homosexuality [Cambridge 1978] 106). The earliest literary reference to the death of Ismene is Mimnermus F 21 West (19 Gentili-Prato); the poet told how Tydeus killed her at the command of Athena, in just such a bedroom confrontation as the vase shows. The like- lihood that Mimnermus thought of Ismene as an offending priestess of Athena-so C. Robert, Oidipus 1 (Berlin 1915) 127; cf. R. Hampe, AntK 18 (1975) 12-is now strength- ened by the discovery that in 7th c. Smyrna, Mimnermus' home, "the earliest and finest religious building in the east- ern Greek world" was dedicated to Athena (E. Akurgal, Ancient Civilizations and Ruins of Turkey4 [Istanbul 1978] 119-21, pl. 42). The grandeur of her temple implies a prominent popular cult of the goddess, with attendant in- terest in tales of her doings. Since Mimnermus'floruit pre- dates the amphora by only 50-80 years, poet and painter probably drew from a common source. Both were dealing with a theme from cult or popular piety, not with a story of adultery. ETHNOGRAPHY AS AID TO THE INTERPRETATION OF ANCIENT MEXICAN COSTUME: Patricia Anawalt, UCLA, Museum of Cultural History Throughout the world, in sculpture, frescoes and figu- rines, valuable cultural information is contained in depic- tions of ancient clothing. Ethnography can help in inter- preting such images. Past and present are dynamically intermingled in Mid- dle American Indian weaving and dress. Surviving elements in present-day costume can demonstrate the actual cut, con-</page><page sequence="4">1985] THE EIGHTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING 323 struction and manner of wearing ancient garments. It is thus possible to recognize a specific prehispanic costume even though depictions of it vary from culture to culture. For example, in the Sierra Norte de Puebla, Indian men still wear a sleeveless jacket with a distinctive fringe along the lower border. These two diagnostic features-cut and differentiated hem area-allow this garment to be traced back 1500 years, through four different cultures, each of which portrayed the jacket according to its own artistic canon and used it for its own purposes. Among the Aztecs, the jacket was associated with rites of human sacrifice, which makes its survival through the Spanish conquest sur- prising. The same is true of a present-day Puebla woman's costume, the quechquemitl. Recognition of the variety of shapes this modern triangular shoulder cape can assume when worn makes it possible to trace varying depictions of it back 2000 years to its homeland on the fertile Gulf Coast. The establishment of the origins of this exotic garment clar- ifies the strong associations of the costume with fertility. Colloquium: Ancient Textiles.

MESOAMERICAN TEXTILES: THE AZTEC EXAMPLE: Patricia Anawalt, UCLA, Museum of Cultural History The reconstruction of the Precolumbian weaving tradi- tion in Mesoamerica presents a particular challenge be- cause the region lacks the combination of dry climate and burial practices that preserves ancient textiles. The earliest textile fragments, which may go back to 8000 B.C., come from preceramic cave sites and represent non-loom tech- niques which may have entered America with early mi- grants across the Bering Straits. The backstrap loom and cotton fibers first appear around 1500 B.C., apparently in- troduced from the south. By A.D. 900 a wide range of pat- terning techniques were being used throughout the region. Fortunately, the survival of indigenous pictorial manu- scripts and Spanish textual sources partially compensates for the paucity of extant textiles. This evidence makes it possible to reconstruct many features of the textile industry of the Aztecs, the final great Mesoamerican high culture, and to obtain a Precolumbian model from which to extra- polate into earlier periods. Details of the production, distribution and use of textiles are illustrated and localized on maps of the 38 provinces of the Aztec empire. The paper highlights such practices as the sequential movement and modification of luxury cloth from lowland origins through a series of manufacturing stages to highland consumption. Also demonstrated is the attempt of the Aztec parvenus to legitimize their hegemony through the use-on imperial clothing-of design motifs, unique to conquered provinces. The extrapolative techniques used in this paper are sig- nificant for scholars whose research involves areas where few ancient textiles remain but pertinent pictorial and text- ual sources survive.

An- derson, Jr., University of Georgia The arch at Orange is commonly dated to the early 1st c. A.C. on the basis of its dedicatory inscription (CIL XII.1230). The architecture and sculpture of the arch are, however, unparalleled in Julio-Claudian art, and the text of the inscription is hypothetical, restored by assigning letters to a series of clamp holes that might have attached them to the architrave. No actual letters survive, nor are there cut- tings for them; even if the holes did serve to fasten metal letters, recutting of the entablature shows that they were added after the construction of the arch itself. No certain text can be restored, hence it cannot furnish evidence for dating. Research on the architecture and sculpture of the arch (funded by NEH Summer Stipend for 1983) provides im- portant new evidence for its date. Style, composition and de- tails demand a return to the date proposed by early exca- vators but rejected by most subsequent scholars: the late 2nd or early 3rd c. A.C. Historical evidence suggests an event that inspired the dedication of the arch (Septimius Severus' passage through Orange toward Britain in 207), and ex- plains the later reworking and addition of bronze letters (radical alteration of the inscription before Caracalla's arri- val in Gaul in 213). A Severan date is both artistically and historically more satisfactory than a Julio-Claudian date, in disagreement with the French publication of the monument (1962) and with Bianchi Bandinelli (1970) and Strong (1973), but in corroboration of early excavators and Min- gazzini (1957; 1968). ARCHAEOMETRIC STUDY OF EARLY BRONZE AGE POT- TERY PRODUCTION AND EXCHANGE IN ARGOLIS AND KORINTHIA, GREECE: M. Attas, J.M. Fossey, L. Yaffe, McGill University The manufacture and movement of Early Helladic (EH) pottery within the Argolis and the Korinthia have been in- vestigated by archaeometric means. The objective was to de- termine the nature and extent of ceramic exchanges of var- ious wares within this culturally homogeneous area. Neu- tron activation analysis was performed on samples from 417 objects of the EH II and III periods found at Keramidhaki, Korakou, Phlious, Zygouries, Tiryns, Asine, Lerna and Lake Vouliagmeni. Multivariate statistical treatment of the concentration data for up to 19 chemical elements yielded 11 compositional reference groups. Many of these could be attributed to centers of production on distributional or other grounds, thereby allowing the sources of more than half the samples to be determined. The following conclusions were reached: 1. All 8 sites, except possibly Phlious, were sources of common EH II ta- ble ware (slipped sauceboats and small bowls). 2. The dis- tributions of these were limited almost exclusively to the as- signed sources and neighboring sites. 3. Many unusual EH</page><page sequence="5">324 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 II fine wares had other sources and broader distributions. 4. The attribution of coarse wares was complicated by the presence of tempering materials. 5. Some changes in distri- bution patterns were noted at Zygouries between early and late phases within EH II. 6. The changes in pottery acquisi- tion patterns which accompanied the beginning of EH III appear to have been more extensive at Tiryns than at Lerna or Korakou. LANDSCAPE AND ARCHITECTURE: ORIGINS OF NEO- LITHIC AND BRONZE AGE ARCHITECTURAL STYLES IN SARDINIA: Miriam S. Balmuth, Tufts University Three architectural forms from ancient Sardinia that ex- ploit the abundant rock of the island are the rock-cut tombs (grotticelle artificiali, called "domus de janas" in Sardic), first constructed in Late Neolithic/Copper Age contexts of the third millennium B.C.; nuraghi, stone towers built from around 1500 to 500 B.C.; and tombe dei giganti, the burials of the nuragic populations. Although Sardinian scholars for the most part have claimed extra-insular derivation for these structures, this paper proposes that all three forms originated as imitations of natural formations on the island and shows the aspects of the landscape that inspired them. It is also suggested that they were originally conceived to be almost invisible in the countryside, but became more con- spicuous with time and prosperity. This kind of development is not unique; the outstanding monuments in Egypt such as pyramids and sphinxes have also been shown to have been inspired by the landscape (F. E1-Baz, Smithsonian 12:1 [April 1981] 116-22). The steps in the development of the corbelled vaulting of nuraghi present a parallel situation. Although Aegean in- fluence has been claimed by Sardinian scholars for the ap- pearance of these vaults in later nuraghi (G. Lilliu, La civil- ta nuragica [1982] 67), and Corsican mediation has also been suggested (F. de Lanfranchi, BSPF 77:4 [1980] 115-22), it is appropriate to discuss the possibility of local development in this instance also (J. Lewthwaite, forthcom- ing). The most recent work (W.G. Cavanagh, Old World Archaeology Newsletter 13:2 [1984] 13-14) promises new ideas on the relationship, if any, between Aegean tholoi and nuragic vaults. INTRODUCTION TO TEXTILE COLLOQUIUM: Elizabeth Barber, Occidental College The manufacture of woven cloth goes back at least 9000 years, and the twisting of thread from fibers goes back 17 to 25 millennia. In many ancient societies the production of fibers, cloth, and clothing occupied more human labor hours than any other single industry. Yet archaeologists have largely ignored the subject, and most people know nothing of the craft or its history. Relevant texts are regularly mis- translated and artifacts are allowed to perish and/or are omitted from publications. To provide a basic ground of knowledge for everyone as we begin this colloquium, we explain a few of the most basic terms, concepts, and processes in spinning and weaving, such as spin, ply, spindle, distaff, S-spin, Z-spin; warp, weft, shed, heddle; plain-weave ("tabby"), faced weave, tap- estry, floats, and twill. The remarkable tenacity with which certain textile traits survive among ethnic groups, some- times for millennia, gives textile studies a special role in ar- chaeology in tracing location, movement, and survival.

A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO AEGEAN TEX- TILES: Elizabeth Barber, Occidental College Reconstruction of textile technology among the Greeks is enhanced by considering archaeological remains together with the linguistic evidence and the requirements of the crafts. Words survive better than either cloth or weaving equipment, and etymological research can shed much light. Furthermore, understanding what is necessary or impossi- ble in the physical process of spinning and weaving im- proves the accuracy of interpretation and eliminates much fruitless speculation. Some interrelated examples of ancient Greek textile terms illustrate how archaeological and lin- guistic data can be mutually illuminating and how know- ledge of the crafts can help both categories. 1) Reconstruction of the semantic change from "pluck" to "shear" in such roots as pek- (for wool and its collection) is made possible by archaeological and palaeobiological recon- struction of domestication changes in fleece. Reconstruction of the semantic change in turn narrows the time-frame for the technological change. 2) From the archaeological remains we can reconstruct the form of the major loom of ancient Greece and the Dan- ube; the surviving linguistic terms can tell us how the loom was operated. The root at/az-, for warping, provides good examples. Furthermore, tracing the borrowing of this word shows when the Greeks learned to use this kind of loom. 3) The core vocabulary in Greek for the process of weav- ing alone shows at least three clear layers, one native and two borrowed, which indicate the stages by which the Greeks acquired their technology, and the route by which they entered Greece.

TEXTILES IN EUROPE AND THE MEDITERRANEAN TO 500 B.C.: Elizabeth Barber, Occidental College The Neolithic Europeans developed their vertical warp- weighted loom independently from, and about as early as, the Near Eastern ground-loom, and produced on it unique and elaborate traditions of pattern weaving. Thus we have sophisticated polychrome "brocades" from Late Neolithic Switzerland at a time when Egypt had only plain-weave. Artistic representations and remains of looms suggest the pattern tradition is even older than the Swiss finds, and is specifically Danubian. South of the Mediterranean, Egypt developed its own</page><page sequence="6">1985] THE EIGHTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING 325 unique technology of fine linen and subtle patterning. In the 2nd millennium, Egypt began to borrow flashier tech- niques, apparently from Syria, as attested by sumptuous 18th Dynasty pieces. The Bronze Age Aegean world elaborated its version of the European tradition in Crete, Greece and Troy. Disin- tegration and neglect of the artifacts have made it a tan- talizing puzzle to discover details about textile industries and the apparently lively textile trade with Egypt and Syria. The Linear B records, loom remains, representations, and deductive inferences all suggest that the industry was ex- tensive and sophisticated. The Hallstatt culture in Austria saw another explosion of textile innovations: 3000 years ago, the ancestors of the Celts were producing plaid tweeds! Representations of this era, in several media, of spinning and weaving on the warp- weighted loom survive from Hungary, Greece and Italy; we can reconstruct how the ancient loom differed from modern Scandinavian versions. We also learn that Europe possessed Chinese silk by the 5th c. B.C., along with a wide variety of textile techniques. Colloquium: Ancient Textiles.

THE ANTICYTHERA FULCRUM BUST: A PORTRAIT OF ARSINO1t III: Beryl Barr-Sharrar, New York Society To be published in AJA. EXCAVATIONS AT MORGANTINA, 1983 AND 1984: M. Bell, University of Virginia In 1983 and 1984 the University of Virginia continued its program of research in the agora of Morgantina, Sicily. Objectives included completion of excavation in the early Hellenistic fountain house discovered in 1982; solution of diverse problems associated with the theater, the great steps, and two stoas; and excavation along the course of the south- ern city wall delimiting the agora. The fountain house was shown to have been in use for three centuries, and there is evidence for a declining water supply throughout its history. At first the structure was roofed and entered through a portico from the agora. Two large basins were fed from a spring to the E and by rain- water from the roof. Later, when the spring had begun to fail, conduits were brought in from the W, requiring changes in exterior ground levels and resulting in lower wa- ter levels in the basins. In the final phase the fountain house was unroofed; the inner basin was filled in, and supported a limestone aedicula in the Doric order. In the lower agora, the southern city wall was shown to have followed the contour of the terrain and not to have crossed the agora in alignment with the orthogonal plan, as had been thought. Outside the wall, two 5th c. B.C. kilns were discovered, both containing matt-painted sherds of the so-called "siculo-geometric" style. The same area produced fragments of an Attic kylix with a graffito inscription. Elsewhere in the agora a series of probes helped clarify the chronology of several buildings. It would now appear that the monumental building program of the agora dates to the 3rd c. B.C., when Morgantina belonged to the kingdom of Hieron II of Syracuse. The city's public buildings may have been designed by Syracusan architects, and so reflect models that once existed in the coastal metropolis. CORINTHIAN PLASTIC "KOMASTS" AND THEIR INFLU- ENCE: William R. Biers, University of Missouri- Columbia Plastic vases in the form of corpulent males in a squatting position were apparently specialties of Corinthian potters of the 6th c., and are often referred to as "komasts." Although well known to the scholarly world since the early days of ar- chaeology, these little vases still hold their secrets as to use, significance and derivation. Scholars have unanimously stated that their form belongs to the East, but little systemat- ic study has been done to demonstrate this received wisdom. Fewer than 50 examples of the canonical form of the komast are known, and they are remarkably similar in shape. The most significant characteristics, unique to this core group of Corinthian komasts, are discussed and related to various East Greek plastic vases and figurines that exhibit similar features. A new group of East Greek plastic vases that relate to the Corinthian examples is identified and described. A unique example from Gela (MonAnt 46 [1963] pl. 27.a-b) belongs to this group and combines characteristics of both Corin- thian and East Greek terracottas. It is argued that this par- ticular vessel is not Corinthian, as has been assumed, but in fact was probably made in East Greece and imitates the typ- ical Corinthian komast in the use of a dot field decoration across the shoulders and chest. It is suggested that this vase reflects an example of Corinthian influence on the plastic arts of East Greece. ETRUSCAN TEXTILES: Larissa Bonfante, New York University Excavations in central Italy in the last 20 years have profited from a renewed interest in the history of the peoples of this region before they became Romans, as well as from more accurate techniques of excavation and conservation, and plain good luck. They have brought to light remnants and traces of textiles; from Decima, near Rome, for exam- ple, come the remains of a gold hair net, and of a stunning silver thread, amber and glass paste dress. This paper pre- sents a brief survey of the representation and the reality of textiles from Etruria and related areas: how they were shown and how they were made, as well as how they were preserved. I have studied representations of cloth on Etrus- can art and the conventions used to render a variety of fab- rics ("transparent" linen, wool checkerboard or twill), shapes, patterns, decorations and color (L. Bonfante, Etrus- can Dress [1975]). Representations of looms and woolwork- ing which tell us something about textile manufacture, as well as the thousands of loom weights, spindle whorls, dis-</page><page sequence="7">326 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 taffs and other objects found in excavations, especially in women's tombs, are now being studied by Jeanine Stage, whose project includes a study of textile remnants and of pseudomorphs (e.g., on bronze mirrors, which were appar- ently kept in cloth cases). This work promises to be fruitful not only in its results, but also in alerting excavators and conservators to preserve valuable evidence. Colloquium: Ancient Textiles.

THE DOURIS CUP AND THE STAGES OF SCHOOLING IN CLASSICAL ATHENS: Alan Booth, Brock University The program of study which the well-born boy followed in the classical epoch comprised athletics, letters and music. The problem is to decide the order in which he tackled these subjects. The Douris cup featuring, on one side, an auletes with a pupil, a grammatistes with a pupil, and a paidago- gos, and on the other, a corresponding scene where a kitha- ristes replaces the auletes, has been taken to demonstrate that literary and musical education were pursued in the same school simultaneously. This conclusion is, however, far from certain. A painter wishing to represent on one cup the two branches of intellectual formation would be obliged by the limited space thus to juxtapose the music-master and the teacher of letters. Again, he might well use a stylized figure to depict the Athenian lad; so the fact that the same pupil seems to attend both masters on the Douris cup does not suffice to prove that, in actual practice, a boy divided his time between kitharistes and grammatistes. In short, the standard interpretation of these scenes is suspect. And in- deed it has promoted misinterpretation of the literary evi- dence, which, properly understood, shows rather that a boy would first learn his letters with the grammatistes before progressing, at a later age, to the school of the kitharistes. Not only must the testimony of the Douris cup be reas- sessed, but a basic section in the history of Greek education needs to be rewritten. Brandfon, F.R. See Herzog, Z. CERAMIC PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION IN LATE BRONZE AGE MESSENIA: Joan Carothers, Univer- sity of California, Los Angeles Archaeological reconnaissance has revealed the existence of about 200 Late Bronze age communities in the region administered by the palace at Pylos (Englianos) in SW Greece. Of these 200 sites the following six have been more or less systematically excavated: Ano Englianos, Voidhokoi- lia, Koukounara, Nichoria, Peristeria and Mouriatadha. An investigation of samples of Late Helladic IIIB pottery recovered from these sites has enabled the ceramic assem- blages for individual settlements within a single Greek Bronze Age kingdom to be studied and compared. Specific form, style and paste attributes were measured for the pot- sherds comprising these samples; analysis of these attributes allows an assessment of: 1) the degree of intrasite variability present, 2) the different production strategies apparent in the manufacture of various types of pots having different functions, and 3) the likelihood of centralized production and kingdom-wide distribution of various types of pottery. SHANG CHINA: Kwang-chih Chang, Harvard University The issue of the rise of political authority pertains to every ancient civilization. But it is only now, when new data from excavations have become available, that we can ex- plore this question in the light of Chinese fact. In this paper I offer an answer to the basic question: how did civilization and its concomitant, the political dynasties, arise in China? The data lead to the conclusion that civilization evolved be- cause in China-as elsewhere-it was the manifestation of the accumulated wealth of a small segment of society, the dynastic family. In the case of China, we can demonstrate that this wealth was accumulated primarily through the ex- ercise of political authority, and that the accrual of political authority was facilitated by several interrelated factors: kin- ship hierarchy, moral authority of the ruler, military power, exclusive access to gods and ancestors through rituals, and access to wealth itself. By examining the history of these factors we can isolate some of the more convincing causes of the rise of political authority and the state in ancient China. Insofar as the evolution of such authority is a universal theme, the Chinese case should be of more than provincial interest.

Mantzourani, University of Cambridge, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Athens In the summers of 1983 and 1984, a joint team drawn from the Universities of Athens, Cambridge and Illinois at Chicago carried out a detailed survey of the NW part of the Cycladic island of Keos-an area corresponding roughly to the hinterland of the major prehistoric site of Ayia Irini and encompassing much of the territories of the classical poleis of Koressos and Ioulis. Some 70 sites were located, ranging in date from later Neolithic to Medieval times. The collec- tion of a considerable body of information about isolated finds from elsewhere in the area has helped both to define these sites adequately and to understand patterns of land use in all periods. Although traces of prehistoric activity were noted in a number of places, their scantiness implies that Ayia Irini was the most important Bronze Age com- munity, at least in this part of the island; in historic times, rural settlement effectively began only in the late Archaic period, earlier material so far being known only from Ko- ressos; periods of greatest expansion fall in the 6th to 4th cs. B.C. and in later Roman times. Detailed mapping of the extant architecture at Koressos, together with collection of diagnostic pottery, has shed light on the demise of the polis as a result of its incorporation with Ioulis in Hellenistic and Roman times. The patterns of settlement revealed by the</page><page sequence="8">1985] THE EIGHTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING 327 survey can be related to major changes in the political and economic organization of the island and its relations with the world beyond, a theme which has also been pursued in an anthropological study of the island in the period follow- ing Greek Independence. THE NEMEA VALLEY ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT, 1984: J.F. Cherry, J.L. Davis, E. Mantzourani, J.C. Wright, University of Cambridge, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Athens, Bryn Mawr College The Nemea Valley Archaeological Project conducted its first season during the summer of 1984 under authority of the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sciences and the Ameri- can School of Classical Studies. The project studies the his- tory of human occupation in the valley in terms of patterns of local settlement and activity, interaction between man and the environment, and changing relations with the world beyond the valley. This season's work focussed on survey in and around the valley and excavation of the prehistoric site of Tsoungiza. Excavation on Tsoungiza ridge refined its chronological range. Deposits and architectural remains of Early Neo- lithic, Early Helladic I, II and III, late Middle Helladic, and Late Helladic I, IIA, IIIB1 and 2 were uncovered; the considerable evidence of early Mycenaean settlement is es- pecially notable. The major result of the season's research was the refinement of questions about the size and nature of the settlements on the ridge, the manner in which successive occupants utilized the terrain, and the extent to which occu- pation there is paralleled-and perhaps at some periods overshadowed-by that elsewhere in the valley. The regional survey sampled landscape types in an area from Mount Phoukas at the N to S of the Tretos Pass. About 26 sites were located in three different areas totalling about 11 km2. The material discovered ranges from Middle Palaeolithic, Early Neolithic, EH I-II, and Mycenaean through Archaic and Classical down to Byzantine and mod- ern times. Overlooking the Tretos Pass are an EH I-II site and a Mycenaean akropolis. An overall abundance of Mid- dle Byzantine contrasts with a paucity of Roman remains. Advances were made in interpreting the remarkable range of artifacts not situated near identifiable sites, and in under- standing the geomorphology of the area. THE ICONOGRAPHY OF THE SOSIAS CUP: Mark Ed- ward Clark, University of Southern Mississippi The Sosias cup represents the enigmatic scene of Achilles bandaging Patroclus. Recently G.F. Pinney (1983) has in- terpreted the scene as evidence for the cult of Achilles among the Scythians. Here the identification of the subject is reconsidered and the scene is interpreted in light of cult ideology and epic typology. The paper supports Pinney's thesis by considering additional associations of the scene with myth and cult. The problem of identification centers on an opportunity in myth for the wounding of Patroclus. The traditional view that the scene represents an episode in which Patroclus was wounded in battle against Telephus has been challenged by C. Bauchhenss-Thiiriedl (1971). A consideration of Pindar, Ol. 9.70-79, however, affords new arguments for the pre- vious identification, so that the Telephus myth, which in- troduces the theme of Achilles' healing, remains an accept- able interpretation of the scene. The Sosias cup is then examined in terms of Achilles as healer. The cults of heros-iatros and the widespread recog- nition of health as a benefit granted by Achilles Pontarches suggest that healing was a significant aspect of the hero which should not be underestimated. Linguistic evidence- e.g., t/.4EcrOat, jdawv--also indicates that healing was fun- damental to Indo-European concepts of governing (E. Ben- veniste, 1945), and defines Achilles' role as caretaker of the Scythians (Alcaeus Z31). Typology of the Iliad sheds light upon the subject. While no episode of Achilles as healer is recounted, if Patroclus is understood as therapon-that is, as ritual substitute of Achilles-a typology is implicit. Patroclus' healing of Eury- pylus (11.828-48, 12.1-3, 15.390-94) thus affords the best opportunity to view the heros-iatros in epic. Homer's rep- resentation, moreover, evokes the same intimate relation- ship between the hero-physician and his wounded friend as is depicted on the Sosias cup. AMENOPHIS III AND THE AEGEAN: Eric Cline, Univer- sity of Pennsylvania The intriguing possibility that Amenophis III or an of- ficial Egyptian embassy voyaged to Mycenae has been sug- gested by both Helck and Hankey. This paper examines the evidence for extensive contacts between the Aegean and Egypt during the reign of this 18th Dynasty pharaoh. Hankey noted faience plaques with the cartouche of Amenophis III at Mycenae and a list of Aegean place- names inscribed on his mortuary temple in Egypt, and sug- gested a possible correlation between them. Further study has revealed many more examples, as well as varied objects from Mycenae and elsewhere in the Aegean, inscribed with the cartouche of either Amenophis III or his wife. Of the 6 Aegean sites yielding these objects, 4 are also sites listed on Amenophis III's funerary temple at Kom el Hetan. Helck's and Hankey's original hypotheses of an official embassy to Mycenae may be modified to recognize multiple contacts between 18th Dynasty Egyptians and the Aegean world. The actual points of contact most likely include the sites listed in the "itinerary" on Amenophis III's mortuary tem- ple, with Mycenae as one port of call. Other data, including correlations between sites in the Syro-Palestinian area con- taining objects inscribed with the names of Amenophis III and Queen Tiyi and sites in this same area where Myce- naean LH IIIA-B pottery has been found, support this ex- panded hypothesis. The visit of Amenophis III may well have taken place; however, it must be regarded as only one instance of Egypto-Aegean contact among many occurring during this period. This analysis of inter-Mediterranean contacts is relevant to several current debates, including those concerning the</page><page sequence="9">328 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 proposed co-regency of Amenophis III and Akhenaten, the interpretation of Amenophis III's "Aegean" list, and the ex- tent of Egypto-Aegean connections throughout the latter part of the Late Bronze Age. RESTITUTIO TYPES ON ROMAN COINS: Jane M. Cody, University of Southern California The portrayal of the Roman commander or emperor as restitutor, restorer of the rights or status of Romans, Italians and provincials, appears frequently on Roman coinage. Regling (ZfN 1922), Strack (Untersuchungen 1), Toynbee (Hadrianic School) and Brilliant (Gesture and Rank) have listed and discussed several of these types, but their studies are based on an imprecise definition of the restitutio motif. This paper aims to provide a correct definition, and to pre- sent a previously unnoticed parallel for the coin types. The essential elements of a restitutio scene are two facing figures, a standing Roman and a kneeling subject, who on the coins is a female personification of an abstract idea or of a group of people. The Roman grasps the kneeling figure's right hand with his in order to lift her to a standing position. To this basic structure may be added other figures or back- ground elements to provide a context for the scene. Exam- ples appear from the late Republic through the reign of Constantine. An interesting parallel for the numismatic restitution types appears on an extensive series of Roman gems with a structurally identical scene. On the gems, however, the god- dess Fortuna appears as restitutor in place of the Roman emperor, and the kneeling figure is usually a male, rather than female, subject. In contrast to the public restitution scenes that appear on the coins, the representations on the gems seem to show a private act by which Fortuna confers her benefits on the owner of the gem. PINDAR AND HERAKLES' CLUB: THE OLYMPIA METOPES RECONSIDERED: Beth Cohen, Columbia University In preserved Greek art and literature, Herakles' canon- ical twelve labors occur first on the Olympia metopes. Most of these compositions depart from Late Archaic versions- e.g., the hero never wears his fabled lionskin. Most signifi- cant is the omission of his bow and quiver of arrows, only partly explained by the avoidance of telescoping space for long-range weaponry. At Olympia, however, Herakles' club has been not merely "introduced only when useful" (Ashmole, Olympia, 25) but emphasized. It is pressed into service wherever it plausibly fits the actions. Pindar develops a portrait of Herakles comparable to the Olympia metopes. The poet's hero evolves from standard Archaic type with bow and lionskin (Isthmian VI, esp. vv. 33-37; ca. 484 or 480 B.C.) to a man "short in stature, but in soul unflinching," (Isthmian IV.53f; ca. 478 B.C.?). In both, Herakles voyages through life to immortality, and succeeds under divine patronage. Pindar's Herakles wields his club against weapons of gods (Olympian X.30: 468 B.C.). While Herakles received his bow and arrows from Apollo, he fashioned his club with his own hands at Nemea (Apollod. 2.4.11). The suppression of quiver, arrows and bow renders the classic Herakles of Olympia an eloquent representative of the age of Pindar's maturity. Aeschylus reminds us that archery was intimately associated with the Persian defense (Pers. esp. vv. 24-31, 81-86, 147-49). To represent Hera- kles, in the most important Panhellenic sanctuary, armed like the bitterly remembered barbarian forces must have seemed repugnant to many. At Olympia not only the club- wielding hero's Pindaric humanity, but also his essential Greekness is stressed. The iconography of Herakles' arms affirms that the Temple of Zeus was a product of Hellenic unity after the Persian War. A FOUR STAGE CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE FOR EARLY AND MIDDLE CYPRIOT: John E. Coleman, Cornell University A detailed chronological sequence for Early and Middle Bronze Age Cyprus is still lacking. Excavated settlements are few and rarely represent more than a single phase; the evidence from tombs is also often unduly stressed. The cur- rent sequence, that proposed by Gjerstad (Studies in Pre- historic Cyprus, 1926) and followed by Stewart (Swedish Cyprus Expedition, IV: 1 A [1962]) and Astrim (SCE IV: 1 B [1972]), is based on the development of pottery styles. Re- cent excavations at Alambra (see especially Barlow and Coleman, "Alambra and the Earlier Phases of the Cypriot Bronze Age," RDAC 1982) suggest that this sequence is founded in part on subjective distinctions and other unwar- ranted assumptions. The four-stage sequence here proposed is based as far as possible on settlement strata. It obviates the need to make chronological distinctions on insufficient evidence, such as that between "EC III" and "MC I." Stage 1, the earliest, is represented by settlements at Philia-Drakos B, Kyra-Alo- nia, and Sotira-Kaminoudhia; it includes the so-called "Phi- lia culture." Stage 2 is represented by settlements at Alam- bra and Ambelikou-Aletri; it includes "EC III" and "MC I" in the current sequence. Stage 3 is so far represented only by tombs, although the settlement recently excavated at Phane- romeni, Area G, may possibly belong to it. Stage 4 is repre- sented by the latest settlement remains at Kalopsidha and possibly by Phaneromeni, Area A, and Dhali-Kafkallia. HELLENISTIC PORTRAITURE AND THE GENERIC VO- TARY OF CYPRUS: Joan Breton Connelly, Bryn Mawr College The influence of rulers' portraiture on the Hellenistic vo- tive sculpture of Cyprus has long been an accepted fact. Pre- vious studies have examined isolated heads of Hellenistic and early Roman date that are particularly high in quality with the intention of establishing identifications with spe- cific individuals. The recognition of "identifiable" portraits has emerged as one of the more reliable criteria for dating Cypriot Hellenistic sculptures, separated as they invariably are from their excavated contexts. The examination of iso-</page><page sequence="10">1985] THE EIGHTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING 329 lated heads has led, however, to certain misunderstandings of the sculptures, their meaning, and their chronology. After examining a broad sampling of statues and con- sidering them in the larger context of Cypriot votive sculp- tures I have concluded that, although types may look in- dividualized, they are in fact generic. Showing varied but not specifically individualized features, they may well have been intended to represent individuals much in the way that Attic grave stelai showed generic figure types inscribed with the names of the deceased and family members. Cyprus is unusual in that here the tradition of dedicating representa- tions of votaries in the round continued unbroken through the late Hellenistic and into the early Roman period. The continuing demand for statues of the votary responded to the contemporary taste for portraiture and resulted in "in- dividualized" yet still generic votive types. New understand- ing of the types allows old identifications with specific in- dividuals to be recognized as erroneous, and problems of chronology and meaning can be approached afresh. Coulton, W.

Dobbins, University of Virginia As part of the renewed excavations at Morgantina, in Sicily, research has resumed in the theater to complete the work begun by Richard Stillwell and the Princeton Univer- sity expedition during the 1950s and 1960s. This paper dis- cusses the problems posed by the Morgantina theater ac- cording to three broad categories-architectural, chronolog- ical and urban. The results of the excavations in 1983 and 1984 are presented. The earliest theater at Morgantina dates to the 4th c. B.C. This early theater is characterized by a cavea with straight seats. Archaeological evidence for what must have been a simple skene building is completely lacking, but an early terrace wall may belong to this phase. The canonical Hellenistic theater with a curved cavea, round orchestra, and a stone skene with paraskenia, a proskenion, and a raised stage was constructed ca. 300 B.C. At a later, but at present uncertain date, the skene building was totally re- novated to create a deeper stage and a new arrangement of interior rooms. Comments are made about the relationship of the theater to the city as a whole, but an extended dis- cussion of its urban significance is reserved for the final publication. THE SECOND CITADEL PALACE AT DURA-EUROPOS AND THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE IWAN: Susan B. Downey, University of California, Los Angeles The second citadel palace at Dura-Europos, as restored by Frank Brown, consists of a peristyle court with small rooms on three sides and three large juxtaposed iwans on the N. The palace probably dates to the first quarter of the 2nd c. B.C. Except for the Dura palace as restored, iwans known before the Sasanian period occur at sites in present day Iraq and Iran, and belong to the period of Parthian con- trol. Since the physical evidence for the form of the Dura building is slight, and the evidence for the reconstruction has never been published, a reevaluation is useful. Only the southern section is well preserved. The surviving portion of the northern section forms the corner of a large space with a narrow corridor at the W. Brown's restoration is based on analogies with the Parthian remains over the old Assur tem- ple at Assur (probably 1st c. B.C.) and the Temple of Sha- mash at Hatra (2nd c. A.C.). These buildings are later and probably had a religious rather than a civic function. It seems unlikely that architects working in a Greek colony would have invented a form which is otherwise unknown until the period of Parthian control. The lack of evidence for interior supports in the northern section of the Dura build- ing makes a restoration as an open court the most likely. CARPE DIEM ON A ROMAN SARCOPHAGUS FROM CRETE: Katherine M.D. Dunbabin, McMaster University A sarcophagus of the Roman period in the Archaeologi- cal Museum of Herakleion (W. Altmann, Architektur und Ornamentik der antiken Sarkophage [Berlin 1902] 39-41) has the form of a kline, with the furniture for a symposium and the attendants represented in relief along the front. Among them is the figure of a skeleton standing beside a table laden with food. The representation has nothing to do with the Eleusinian Mysteries, as has sometimes been sug- gested, but illustrates the custom described in the Cena Tri- malchionis (34) of introducing the model of a skeleton at banquets as an incitement to the greater enjoyment of the pleasures of this life. The custom is also illustrated by nu- merous representations of skeletons in the context of the symposium on works dating from the first centuries B.C. and A.C., for example on drinking cups and gems, and cor- responds to a fashion for the carpe diem theme found in the literature of the period. The Herakleion sarcophagus, like many other grave monuments, transfers the imagery of the symposium to a funerary context, and gains a particular pi- quancy from the use on a monument for the dead of the skeleton-figure intended originally to add zest to the pleas- ures of life. The representations on the ends of the sarco- phagus, a boy indicating a sun-dial and a slave with a lan- tern, similarly belong both in the context of the symposium and in that of the grave. EARLY NEAR EASTERN TEXTILE INDUSTRIES: Richard Ellis, Bryn Mawr College Our evidence for the textile arts is nearly as old as that for food production and village life. The earliest impres- sions of fabric on clay are from shortly after 7000 B.C. (Jar- mo), and the oldest preserved piece of cloth is from about 6000 B.C. (Qatal Hayuik). By that time weavers were pro- ducing fine, even and remarkably varied textiles. The evi-</page><page sequence="11">330 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 dence suggests that early Near Eastern and Mediterranean textiles were usually of bast fiber. Wool probably became common only in the 5th millennium, as a result of long do- mestic breeding in Mesopotamia. Evidence of the 4th and 3rd millennia for the type of loom used-the horizontal ground loom-as well as for dyes and the beginnings of simple pattern weaves comes from Susa, Ur, Ebla and other Near Eastern sites. Unfor- tunately the direct evidence for what must have been elegant patterned fabrics in the late 3rd and 2nd millennia is almost totally lacking, as a result of poor conditions for preserva- tion and the inattention of excavators. Artistic representa- tions tell us a good deal about decoration, although not nec- essarily about techniques; cuneiform texts give information particularly about the organization of textile production, but provide technical hints as well. A wealth of textile fragments from early 1st millennium B.C. Gordion (L. Bellinger, Bulletin of Needle/Bobbin Club 46 [1982] 4-33) gives some idea of what must have been lost from earlier periods, in the range of patterns, mate- rials and techniques. Reanalysis of these remains in light of recent advances in textile studies also enlarges the picture. Colloquium: Ancient Textiles.

THE ISSUES OF SEXTUS POMPEY: Jane DeRose Evans, University of Pennsylvania Previous in-depth study of the coins minted by Sextus Pompey has been limited to T. Buttrey's work on Sextus' "Pietas" denarii (NC6 20 [1960] 83-101). The present study was undertaken with the goal of clarifying iconogra- phy, size and date of issue, and place of minting. An exami- nation of the die linkage of the series led to conclusions at variance with M. Crawford's in Roman Republican Coin- age (1974). His estimates were shown to be consistently too high; for instance, the aureus, estimated to have 15 dies each for the obverse and reverse, was shown to have 2 obverse and 2 reverse dies. Statistical analysis was used to confirm the findings. A study of the hoards proved fruitless for either locating the mint (most countries in Europe are represented, with most finds coming from Romania) or for dating the minting (hoards close with the Sextus Pompey issues or during the Imperial period). Evidence from a previously published in- scription may support the conclusion put forth by M. Hadas (Sextus Pompey [diss. 1930]) that Sextus began minting in Sicily only after July 36. Numismatists currently date the same issues to 42. Iconographic investigation explained details of the types and compared the types and motifs to contemporary coins to elucidate repeated propagandistic themes during the Civil War. The possibility was raised that one of the issues (obv.: pharos, ship/rev.: Scylla), generally taken to have been minted in Sicily between 42 and 35, may have been minted in Asia Minor in 35 B.C. THREE UNFINISHED SARCOPHAGUS LIDS AND THE RO- MAN IMPERIAL UARRY SYSTEM IN PHRYGIA: J. Clayton Fant, University of Akron To be published in AJA. THE TRADE PATTERN OF THE MYCENAEANS IN SOUTHERN ITALY: Elizabeth A. Fisher, University of Minnesota The large quantity of Mycenaean pottery and scanty ar- chitectural remains excavated in 1899 and 1900 at Scoglio del Tonno (Taranto) have been interpreted by some schol- ars as evidence for a Mycenaean settlement. Taylour (My- cenaean Pottery in Italy and Adjacent Areas [Cambridge 1958] 128-37) concurred with this interpretation and con- cluded that most of the Mycenaean pottery was Rhodian. A recent examination, however, indicates that the Myce- naean pottery from Scoglio del Tonno has its closest paral- lels with Achaean rather than Rhodian pottery. Further- more, scientific analyses of "Rhodian" jars similar to those identified by Taylour at Scoglio del Tonno have shown that the jars are probably products of Achaea. Substantial quantities of Mycenaean pottery discovered in southern Italy in the past 25 years suggest a pattern in which each Mycenaean region involved in trade with Italy called customarily at a specific port. Vagnetti noted that the pottery from Broglio di Trebisacce (Calabria) has close con- nections with pottery from Crete (Magna Grecia e mondo miceneo [Taranto 1982] 107-12). Mycenaean pottery from Termitito (Basilicata) appears to have numerous parallels in pottery from Messenia, although no complete study has been made. Thus, at several ports in southern Italy the sea routes of the Mycenaeans could have met with inland routes. There is no evidence for any type of Mycenaean-ruled colony in Italy, nor for a significant settlement of Myce- naeans, but it is likely that an enclave of Mycenaeans existed at Scoglio del Tonno. A NEW INTERPRETATION OF THE TOPONYM LACu:S C( RnTIs: Gary Forsythe, University of Pennsylvania In 1904 C. Boni uncovered the Lacus Curtius in the Fo- rum and found it to be a trapezoidal pavement about 30 feet N-S and 20 feet E-W. Roman historians of the late Re- public gave three conflicting explanations of the name by connecting it with a supposed Curtius of the regal period or early Republic. Although modern historians have not al- ways accepted these explanations, no one has doubted the derivation of the name from that of the Curtian family, de- spite the fact that of the 19 lacus known in Rome, the Lacus Servilius is the only other pool which appears to take its name from a Roman family, whereas all other names are somehow descriptive or topographical. Curtius should be an adjective derived from curs, curtis, a syncopated vernacular form of cohors, cohortis, whose original meaning was not a subdivision of a Roman legion but an enclosed area, such as a farmyard or animal pen. The term Lacus Curtius is exact-</page><page sequence="12">1985] THE EIGHTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING 331 ly paralleled by the Campus Martius (curs, curtis, curtius, = Mars, Martis, Martius). Just as Campus Martius meant "field of Mars," so Lacus Curtius must have originally meant "pool of the enclosure" or "the penned-in pool." This new interpretation is archaeologically confirmed, because Boni discovered that the upper surfaces of the outer blocks of the pavement were slotted to support an enclosing wall. The divergent ancient explanations were erroneously based upon the later common practice of naming public buildings from the officials responsible for their construction. Fossey, J.M. See Attas, M. IDENTIFICATION OF MARBLE PROVENIENCE BY PAT- TERN RECOGNITION OF XERORADIOGRAPHS: Giraud V. Foster, Norman R. Herz, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Center for Ar- chaeological Sciences, University of Georgia Marble in antiquity from different locations varies in both crystal size and radiodense microinclusions. The fol- lowing studies were carried out to determine whether quan- tification of these parameters had diagnostic potential. Sec- tions of marble specimens from Thasos, Paros, Pentelikon, Ephesus, Herakleia, Dokimeion and Carrara were cut by diamond saw and xeroradiographed. Images, photographi- cally enlarged and reproduced on film in the positive mode, were scanned in two dimensions using an Optronics P1700 Microdensitometer with data acquisition capabilities. As- sessment of 1) percentages of radiodensities, 2) within sam- ple variation of radiodensity and 3) crystal size as measured by reflected light, permitted "fingerprinting" that was in- dependent of measurements of stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen. Differences in results were observed in samples from different quarries. From these data it is concluded that pattern recognition of xeroradiographs of marble samples may aid in identification of provenience. THE CHRONOLOGY OF CYPRIOT SCULPTURE: Pamela Gaber-Saletan, Merrimack Valley College Since 1948 the chronology of Cypriot sculpture proposed by Einar Gjerstad (Swedish Cyprus Expedition IV:2 [1948]) has been in general use. There are three problems with this chronology. First, it relies on ethnic associations as chronological criteria (cf. C. Vermeule, AJA 78 [1974] 287-90). Second, it ignores the complication of regional styles in Cypriot sculpture. In addition, the chronological table combines terracottas with stone sculpture, resulting in a date for the earliest stone sculpture at least a generation too early. This paper proposes a chronology which addresses all three of these difficulties. It separates terracottas from lime- stone sculpture, leaving an initial date for stone figures no earlier than 600 B.C. It takes into account regional differ- ences in carving style, thereby correcting several dating er- rors. Finally, ethnic designations are removed from stylistic categories. This new chronology more accurately reflects both the excavated data and the cosmopolitan nature of the culture which produced the stone sculptures of Cyprus. SARDINIAN NURAGHI. NEW METHODS OF STUDY: OBSIDIAN HYDRATION AND ARCHITECTURAL ANAL- YSIS: Lenore Gallin, University of California, Los Angeles After three field seasons, attempts are made to develop an architectural typology for prehistoric Sardinian stone tow- ers (nuraghi) and a procedure for classification and dating that relates nuraghi of unknown origin to towers whose chronology can be reliably established through analysis of associated obsidian material. The methodology consists of: 1) systematic architectural examination and documentation of 60 nuraghi, focusing on stylistic development, spatial ar- rangement, use of material, masonry technique, technologi- cal innovation, and solar and topological orientation; 2) op- tical measurement of hydration bands of archaeological ob- sidian collected from the surface of at least 1/3 of the sites; 3) development of a chronological typology of nuraghi through multivariate statistical analyses of architectural data corre- lated with derived obsidian hydration dating; and 4) formu- lation of testable hypotheses relating stylistic changes in monumental building techniques to functional differentia- tion of the nuraghi. Although Lilliu (I Nuraghi [Rome 1962]) had previously catalogued nuragic features, this re- search is the first systematic analysis of Sardinian nuraghi in which obsidian dating and computer-assisted statistical techniques have been used. Early findings have already demonstrated considerable practical application to prehis- toric Sardinian archaeology. This report will focus on two such significant findings: 1) surface obsidian can yield early nuragic dates; and 2) partially destroyed or buried nuraghi may be hypothetically reconstructed through computer-as- sisted projection utilizing a data base from 60 towers in var- ious states of preservation. THE INITIAL SEASON AT TELL EL-'UMEIRI, JORDAN: Lawrence T. Geraty, Andrews University During the summer of 1984, Andrews University and the American Center of Oriental Research in Amman spon- sored the first of several planned seasons of archaeological excavation and survey at Tell el-'Umeiri, one of the largest tells in central Jordan. The expedition followed a decade of work at Tell Hesban, also on the edge of the Madaba Plains. Major architectural finds included an EB IV/MB I domestic area, an Iron Age glacis and defense system, and an Iron II citadel. Among some 700 small finds, the most interesting was a seal impression of the prime minister of an Ammonite king known heretofore only from Jeremiah 40:14. The regional survey discovered a portion of the Via Nova S of Amman, a series of outlying Iron Age farmsteads, and possibly the oldest and largest Palaeolithic site in Jor- dan. This report offers the first preliminary interpretation of the significance of the site.</page><page sequence="13">332 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 KAVOUSI, CRETE 1983-84: THE VRONDA SETTLE- MENT: Geraldine Gesell, William Coulson, Leslie Day, University of Tennessee, University of Min- nesota, Wabash College In 1983 and 1984 the authors cleaned the settlement at Vronda, excavated in 1900 by Harriet Boyd (Hawes) but never fully published (AJA 5 [1901] 131-32). Her material has been used as evidence for the culture of the little known Early Iron Age in eastern Crete. The cleaning has revealed a sizable settlement with massive rubble-filled terrace walls, a large rectangular structure on top, and many smaller rooms on terraces around it. Notable architectural features include benches, pot stands, and bins along the walls. A stone kernos was set in a possible courtyard S of the rectangular structure. Most of the rooms had earth floors incorporating irregular bedrock, but one storeroom had a flagstone floor on which were found smashed two pithoi and fine wares of LM IIIC-Protogeometric date. Another room contained much similar pottery along with cow, pig and goat skulls. Near the surface in two of the rooms were found burned human bones in association with fine pottery and bronze and iron objects, possibly indicating a secondary use of these rooms for crema- tion. The work so far has shown that the site was occupied from LM IIIC to Geonietric, and cleaning to bedrock has indicated that there was activity at Vronda as early as Early Minoan. Vronda can now be considered to have been occu- pied continuously from the end of the Late Bronze Age into Geometric times and forms an important link between the cultures of the Bronze and Iron Ages. GRAFFITI ARTISTS OF DURA EUROPOS: Bernard Gold- man, Wayne State University Whereas the professional artists who provided for the needs of Dura Europos gave the conventional representa- tion of the men and women of the city-how the upper class citizenry ought to look-the naive graffiti artists drew the city folk as they saw them. Because these casual doodlers on the walls of the houses and battlements in the 2nd and 3rd cs. A.C. had little talent, their visual records must be read with care. On the other hand, the portrayals of the impor- tant citizens of Dura by the trained artists may be no more accurate than the sculptures of George Washington togate. Graffito verism has another value: it provides portraits of those archaeologically almost invisible birds of passage- traders, travellers, and migrant residents-whose presence has only been inferred. Visitors from neighboring Syrian and Mesopotamian towns are sketched, but more significant are portraits of the more distant Iranians and their Kushan relatives from farther East. Gregory, T.E. See Mills, H. A NEW WORKSHOP OF EARLY CLASSICAL CUP- PAINTERS: Robert Guy, The Art Museum, Prince- ton University The delicate covered cup Boston 00.356, once considered by Beazley to be the masterpiece of a minor early classical artist, the Carlsruhe Painter, may now be convincingly set alongside a half dozen others, chiefly cups (among them, Athens N.M. 2187), which together represent an early phase of the Villa Giulia Painter. Beazley assigns the Villa Giulia Painter to "the academic wing of early classic vase- painting," and observes a connection with the followers of Douris. On the basis of this new group of early works, how- ever, I suggest that the origins of his style lie in a previously unsuspected direction. We can trace in Beazley's lists the clear continuation of three major late archaic workshops of cup-painters into the early classical period-those of Douris, Onesimos/the Antiphon Painter, and Makron. But what of the Brygos Painter and his circle? Surely so vital a tradition too had its offspring. Several artists, in company with the Villa Giulia Painter, seem to have served at least a part of their apprenticeship in the Brygan workshop: the Stieglitz Painter, the Sabouroff and the Bordeaux Painters, the Lyan- dros Painter, the Telephos Painter and the Boot Painter. Two of the Sabouroff Painter's early cups were, according to Bloesch, potted by a follower of Brygos; and significantly, Munich 2685 is white-ground inside. Indeed, all the early classical Brygans have one or more white-ground cups to their credit (the Villa Giulia Painter takes the lead with five). In the 470s the Brygan workshop, ever flourishing, may be seen to acquire some distinction as a center for the production of white-ground cups-admirable foils to the more spectacular achievements of the Pistoxenans. PALAEOETHNOBOTANY IN CYPRUS: RECENT RE- SEARCH: Julie Hansen, Indiana University Since the 1960s the study of botanical remains from ex- cavations in Cyprus has kept pace with similar studies in the rest of the Eastern Mediterranean. Sites ranging in age from the earliest Neolithic (around 6500 B.C.) to the Clas- sical period have yielded plant material from a variety of contexts. During 1984 work on several different sites added new information to the existing data. This paper summa- rizes that work and analyzes the current state of palaeo- ethnobotany in Cyprus. In the earliest Neolithic sites of Khirokitia, Kalavasos- Tenta and Cape Andreas-Kastros, emmer and einkorn wheat, lentils, peas and vetch were cultivated. A variety of wild plants such as pistachio, olive, figs and grapes were also collected. The large size of the olive pits found this year in the excavated material from Khirokitia may indicate the cultivation of this plant, but additional evidence is needed. In the later Neolithic site of Ayios Epiktitos- Vrysi, bread wheat and rye are added to the cereals, and chick pea ap- pears among the legumes. New edible wild plants include the almond, hackberry and apple or pear. Our information for the Chalcolithic through Middle Cypriot periods is too scanty to be able to say anything for certain about changes in the diet of these peoples. Information from Kalavasos- Ayious, Phaneromeni and Sotira-Kaminoudhia suggests no change in the major species cultivated or collected. By the end of the Bronze Age botanical remains from the sites of</page><page sequence="14">1985] THE EIGHTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING 333 Kalopsidha, Apliki and Hala Sultan Tekki provide a some- what changed picture. By this time grapes and olives are definitely cultivated and bread wheat has become the domi- nant wheat species. Barley, lentils and the other legumes are still cultivated as well, while pomegranate is identified for the first time among the wild species exploited at Hala Sul- tan Tekk6. No change is seen in the Cypro-Archaic levels at Idalion and it is not until the 4th c. B.C., among the funeral pyres at Salamis, that we find examples of new flora such as rosehips, hazelnuts and lotus. Although the evidence suggests that agriculture was brought to Cyprus fully developed, it does appear that a large number of indigenous wild plants were exploited. This exploitation may have led to the domestication of the vine and olive, but recent evidence from Khirokitia suggests the possibility that the olive was domesticated earlier. THE SO-CALLED EPHESOS "AMAZON": A NEW IDENTI- FICATION: Kim J. Hartswick, George Washington University Pliny's account (NH 34.53) of a competition among the most celebrated sculptors for the making of statues of Ama- zons is a well known passage in his book on bronze. Accord- ing to Pliny, all the entries were dedicated in the Temple of Artemis at Ephesos and the vote of the artists themselves judged the works: Polykleitos was voted the winner, fol- lowed by Pheidias, Kresilas, Kydon and Phradmon. Over a century ago three Amazon types, known in nu- merous replicas and usually called the Lansdowne, Capito- line and Mattei after the collections which housed the most complete examples, were considered copies of these compe- tition pieces (O. Jahn, Berichte der K. Sichs. Gesellschaft der Wiss. zu Leipzig 2 [1850] and A. Michaelis, Jdl 1 [1886] 14-47). Later a unique statue in the Villa Doria Pamphili was identified as an Amazon and included in this series (A. Furtwaingler, Meisterwerke der griechischen Plastik [Leipzig and Berlin 1893] 287). Finally, a statue found in Ephesos in 1898, but not published until 60 years later, was identified as the last Amazon, completing Pliny's group of five (F. Eichler, OJh 43 [1956-1958] 7-18). The identifications and attributions of these five "Ama- zons" have not been universally accepted, and the accuracy of Pliny's account has been challenged (B.S. Ridgway, AJA 78 [1974] 1-17; E.B. Harrison, The Eye of Greece: Studies in the Art of Athens [Cambridge 1982] 53-88). This paper shares such skepticism and focuses on the identification and date of the so-called Ephesos Amazon, which was one of several pillar figures decorating the proskenion of the Ro- man theater in Ephesos. These architectural elements are re-examined and the eclectic nature of the figural decoration is emphasized. It is proposed that the "Amazon," which is known from only one example and which consciously copies in mirror image the Capitoline type, is the personification of the city of Ephesos. It is not a copy of an original 5th c. statue, but a Roman classicizing work. This Ephesos "Amazon," therefore, does not, as pre- viously argued, prove the reliability of Pliny's account. (See G.M.A. Richter, Archaeology 12 [1959] 111-15.) Rather, this personification in the guise of a famous Amazon type (perhaps by Polykleitos) represents the Roman readiness to adapt 5th c. types for new settings and new meanings. HOUSES OR TEMPLES? 'UBAID TRIPARTITE ARCHITEC- TURE IN MESOPOTAMIA: Elizabeth F. Henrickson, Royal Ontario Museum Excavations at the sites of Eridu and Tepe Gawra in the 1930s and 1940s yielded striking evidence of early "monu- mental" architecture in northern and southern Mesopota- mia. These large buildings were stratified within long, con- tinuous sequences of 'Ubaid period (5th millennium B.C.) occupations. They are generally interpreted as temples, pre- cursors of the classic tripartite temples of the proto-historic and historic Sumerian period, which are similar in plan. During the 1970s an international salvage project in the Jebel Hamrin region of eastern central Iraq unearthed a number of buildings with tripartite plans from the sites of Tell Madhhur, Kheit Qasim, Tell Abbadeh, and Tell Ra- shid, all dating to later 'Ubaid ('Ubaid 3-4) times. This paper presents metrical, structural and artifactual data for tripartite buildings of the 'Ubaid period, in order to establish the function(s) of each structure within its ancient community. It becomes clear that not all 'Ubaid tripartite structures can be identified as "temples" or "public architec- ture." Most of those from the Hamrim, as well as others from Gawra, Thalathat and other older excavations, proba- bly served rather as ordinary residences. The implications of this analysis are discussed, with special attention to the early development of complex socio-political and religious organization seen in immediately post-'Ubaid times. POTTERY WORKSHOPS AND THE REGIONAL ECONOMY OF BRONZE AGE CENTRAL WESTERN IRAN: Robert C. Henrickson, Royal Ontario Museum Excavations at the site of Godin Tepe in the Kangavar Valley of central western Iran yielded a long, stratified ar- chaeological sequence for the region. The Period III assem- blage (2600-1500 B.C.) is found throughout the highlands of central western Iran. At Godin Tepe itself the destruction of the Period III Level 5 settlement (ca. 2200 B.C.) pre- served a large corpus of pottery in situ. Stylistic and morphological analysis of the painted ware vessels of this corpus demonstrates that the residents of the Godin Tepe settlement used the products of at least two pot- tery workshops, and that the majority of all pottery was pro- duced by craftsmen in a limited number of workshops. Study of contemporary pottery from other sites in the Kangavar and surrounding valleys suggests that the producers of painted wares probably served one or more valleys in over- lapping market areas. This analysis provides a first step in a reconstruction of the regional economy of the central west- ern Iranian highlands during the late 3rd millennium B.C. Herz, N.R. See Foster, G.

Brandfon, Harvard University and Tel Aviv University, Stockton State College The site of Tel Gerisa has been excavated since 1980 by a team of archaeologists from Tel Aviv University, Macquar- rie University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary (Project Director: James D. Muhly; Archaeological Field Director: Ze'ev Herzog; Ex- ecutive Director: Fredric Brandfon; Educational Director: Anson Rainey). Tel Gerisa, located at the confluence of the Yarkon and Aijalon rivers, just N of Tel Aviv, was a Bronze Age port linking the interior of Israel with the eastern Mediterranean world through the Yarkon river basin. Excavations have concentrated on the Iron Age remains at Tel Gerisa, which are restricted to the 12th-lO10th cs. B.C. Areas at the N and S extremities of the mound revealed a series of superimposed Early Iron Age settlements, rich in Philistine remains. Two probes, one on the E edge of the mound and one in its center, found Middle and Late Bronze Age material respectively. The Middle Bronze Age fortifications, including a curtain wall and rampart, were uncovered along with a series of houses abutting the inside of the wall. A Late Bronze Age terrace or courtyard has been partially excavated. The excavations at Tel Gerisa are part of a regional proj- ect studying the western end of Israel's Sharon Plain. Sur- vey work has accompanied the excavation, along with en- vironmental, historical, and geographical studies. A sum- mary of this general work is presented. WHY IS THE DOUBLE AXE DOUBLE?: A. Trevor Hodge, Carleton University Published in this issue of AJA, pp. 307-308. EXPLORATIONS AT CAESAREA MARITIMA-THE CAE- SAREA ANCIENT HARBOUR EXCAVATION PROJECT'S 1984 SEASON: Robert L. Hohlfelder, University of Colorado During the summer of 1984, the Caesarea Ancient Har- bour Excavation Project (CAHEP) conducted land and un- derwater excavations in the harbors of Caesarea Maritima, Israel. CAHEP is a consortium of the Universities of Haifa, Victoria, Maryland and Colorado with Professor Avner Raban (Haifa) serving as project director and Professors John P. Oleson (Victoria), R.L. Vann (Maryland) and Robert L. Hohlfelder (Colorado) as co-directors and insti- tutional representatives. A professional staff of 15 was as- sisted by over 100 volunteer divers from 5 countries. Gener- ous financial support came from the participating institu- tions and from the NEH, the SSHRC, the Caesarea Devel- opment Corporation, the National Geographic Society and numerous private donors. A summary of the most signifi- cant results follows: 1. Land excavations in the Inner Harbor area of the main port revealed the existence of an enclosed harbor basin cut from bedrock. It dates from the 2nd c. B.C. and was associated with the pre-Herodian settlement known from literary sources as Strato's Tower. It was renovated and in- corporated into Herod's grand harbor construction de- scribed in detail by Josephus. 2. Underwater investigations at the mouth of the outer basin suggest that the entrance channel was much wider than initially suspected. Its width of over 35 m. is similar to harbor mouths of other great Imperial ports. 3. Underwater excavations were undertaken at several locations near the harbor entrance along the S face of the Northern Breakwater. These investigations uncovered evi- dence of a Byzantine restoration effort in the early 6th c. A.C. Impressive quantities of artifacts were discovered here as well. This cultural material had been carried to the prox- imity of the harbor entrance by an artificially induced out- flowing current that routinely scoured the outer basin. 4. An extensive 5 year architectural survey of underwater remains was completed in 1984. It is now possible to offer reasonable conjectures on the configuration of the harbor at various times in its long history (ca. 15 B.C.-A.D. 1291). Two "ORATORY" MOSAICS FROM AqUILEIA: Antonia Holden, Bryn Mawr College This paper deals with two 4th c. mosaics from Aquileia which belong to rooms identified as private, Christian ora- tories (Brusin and Zovatto, Monumenti paleocristiani di Aquileia e di Grado [1952]). This identification is founded not on architectural or other factual evidence, but on the in- terpretation of the iconography of the pavements, which is ambiguous. I propose that the pavements can be better un- derstood in a profane context as apotropaic and talismanic in meaning. The rooms they pave are not liturgical in function, but are later phases of the triclinia which they replaced. The first mosaic, from the putative "oratorio della pesca," is dated to the middle of the 4th c., at which time the "ora- tory" is thought to have been constructed over the triclinium of a 2nd c. peristyle house (Bertacchi, Da Aquileia a Vene- zia [1980]). The marine scene, season personifications, ani- mals, birds and particularly the nimbed phoenix have been interpreted as Christian images. Similar motifs, however, occur in mosaics of reception rooms of private habitations (Desenzano, North Africa, Antioch) where, combined in this way, they are thought to function as charms bringing luck (Dunbabin, The Mosaics of Roman North Africa: Studies in Iconography and Patronage [1978]). That this type of meaning was attached to the phoenix is also con- firmed by coins, mosaics and the literary sources. The second pavement belongs to the supposed "oratorio del Buon Pastore." It has been ascertained that the "ora- tory" corresponds in plan to the triclinium of a 1st c. house (Bortolotto, I1 sacello paleocristiano della Cal ad Aquileia [1973]). The mosaic is dominated by a shepherd and flock which are thought to be Christian on the basis of compari- sons with similar scenes in Christian contexts. Pastoral scenes, however, were often depicted in mosaics and sarco- phagi where shepherds represented mythological characters or were generic reflections of country tranquility. The sur- rounding animals, birds and kantharoi place this composi-</page><page sequence="16">1985] THE EIGHTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING 335 tion in the category of positive or apotropaic images in- tended to protect the house. The controversy over these mosaics illustrates an icono- graphic problem inherent in the 4th c. when Christian art was based closely on Graeco-Roman forms and images. It can be assumed that in this period mosaic workshops, using a traditional repertory of standard motifs which circulated freely in pattern books, were prepared to work indiscrimi- nately for Christian and pagan alike. Therefore, it is often difficult to determine whether a given work was intended as Christian or pagan. THE ROMANO-BRITISH VILLA OF CASTLE COPSE, GREAT BEDWYN (WILTSHIRE): E. Hostetter, India- na University During 1983-1984, Indiana University conducted exca- vations at the major courtyard villa situated on an elongated ridge immediately S of Great Bedwyn. While the site covers many hectares, the main complex extends over a leveled platform of ca. 100 x 110 m. Three sectors, with remains spanning the period from the Roman invasion to the end of the Roman domination, were opened in three wings. Sector A revealed a basilican structure which, in its later phases, was subdivided and transformed into luxury accommoda- tions furnished with wall paintings, bath systems and mo- saics. Sector B proved the best-appointed with a series of polished mosaics, including one example with a kantharos and guilloche medallion. Sector C may have functioned as a service area. The entire complex appears to have undergone an extensive and unifying expansion in the earlier 4th c. In addition, both Sectors B and C revealed poorly built "dwarf" mud-mortared flint walls within the courtyard which sug- gest a major cultural change, probably a sub- or post-Ro- man occupation. Such a phase would provide evidence for the transition between Roman Castle Copse and the rise or continuity (?) of the village of Great Bedwyn, an important early Saxon market town possessing its own mint. Sur- rounding earthworks, faunal remains, Saxon land grants and place-names suggest that the villa estate possessed not only vast field systems, but also a large game park. TEXTILE FABRIC PSEUDOMORPHS: WHAT THEY ARE, WHERE THEY ARE FOUND, AND WHAT THEY TELL Us: K.A. Jakes, L.R. Sibley, University of Georgia, Ohio State University The textile fabric pseudomorph is a particularly valuable form of evidence since it is often available from sites which yield no actual fabrics. Pseudomorphs are mineralized for- mations which display the physical shapes of fibers, yarns, and fabrics. They are formed in a process of petrification in which mineral compounds replace the organic components of the fibers while retaining their external shapes. The con- ditions conducive to pseudomorph development, including pH, oxidation potential and moisture, are discussed, and the influence of the organic/inorganic composition of the fiber, and of the elemental composition of the soil and metal, on the mineralization is treated. Pseudomorphs formed after fabric may be used as evi- dence for lost textiles and their cultural implications, pro- viding information about fibers, yarns, and fabric choices made by the artisan-producers. Recent research indicates that the incidence of pseudomorphs may be more frequent than has been assumed in the past, and a review of their known occurrences is presented. Primary emphasis is on those recovered from prehistoric sites in southeastern North America, although examples from other areas are included. The usefulness of this unusual form of ancient textile evi- dence is assessed. Colloquium: Ancient Textiles. See Adams, Anawalt, Barber, Bonfante, Ellis, Mackie, Paul and Vollmer. HAN CHINA: Jean M. James, Iowa Society The origins of the government of Han China (206 B.C.-A.D. 220) lie in the 4th c. B.C. when Shang Yang, the chief minister of the state of Ch'in, divided the Ch'in state into 31 prefectures administered by officials loyal solely to the king. In 202 B.C. the first Han emperor took control and, instead of resorting to the remnants of the old nobility for support, he kept the Ch'in bureaucratic system and the law code, currency, script, and weights and measures im- posed by the Ch'in emperor. The exercise of political authority in Han and in later China falls into a pattern of flow towards the center and ebb away from it. A strong emperor could control his adminis- trators and rule effectively, but a weaker emperor could not. Hence, power was centralized under strong emperors but under weak emperors it passed into the hands of local mag- nates and factions. Strong emperors could control the eco- nomy and regulate the markets and industry. Weak empe- rors were forced to give way to wealthy landowners and their powerful families while markets and industries were less hampered by government supervision. Even so, the Han bureaucratic system became the permanent structure of the Chinese state until 1911. Evidence for the form of Han agriculture and industry comes primarily from excavations. Foodstuffs, utensils, arms, agricultural and other tools, iron foundries and other industries, and the Han capital cities uncovered since 1950 show the extent and level of agricultural and technological development during the Han. The civilization of traditional China is the fruit of the Han tree. Colloquium: Stages in the Emergence of Civilization and the State in Early China. See Chang and Linduff. LATE ROMAN IMPORTS AT CORINTH FROM EGYPT AND SYRO-PALESTINE: Barbara L. Johnson, Co- rinth Excavations, American School of Classical Studies Excavations in ancient Corinth have revealed a sizable amount of late Roman (4th to 8th cs. A.C.) pottery imported from the Syro-Palestinian area and from Egypt. The finds come from a range of dated deposits, including those from floors, wells and destruction fills. Of particular significance because of their eastern origin are vessels of specialized</page><page sequence="17">336 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 shape such as the Egyptian melon-shaped jug, one type of thin-walled decanter and an early Christian ampulla from Syro-Palestine. Also attested is Near Eastern domestic pot- tery, mainly in the form of cooking vessels and North Syrian mortaria. Egyptian painted ware is known in small quan- tities. Most prominent, however, are the amphoras of baggy shape common in both regions and the widely distributed Gaza amphoras. The identification of late Roman pottery from Syro-Pal- estine and Egypt demonstrates the extent and quality, hith- erto poorly documented, of Corinth's contacts with the East. The pottery can also shed light on the Jewish and Christian communities of Corinth in the late Roman age. Establishing the provenance and quantity of oriental imports at Corinth is an important initial step toward determining their extent in Greece as a whole. VITRUVIUS, PERISTASIS AND THE PROTECTION OF BOOKS: STUDIES PERTAINING TO THE QUESTION OF ORIENTATION AND INSULATION CORRIDORS IN LI- BRARIES: Lora Lee Johnson, Brown University The Library of Celsus at Ephesus, excavated in 1903-1904, has greatly influenced the modern view of an- cient library architecture. Two of the most frequently men- tioned characteristics of Roman libraries are 1) an eastern orientation and 2) peristasis or insulation corridors for the prevention of dampness in books. A close analysis of liter- ary, epigraphical and archaeological evidence, however, suggests a strikingly different situation. Vitruvius' advice concerning orientation refers strictly to libraries in private dwellings and not to large-scale public libraries. This interpretation is supported by the wide va- riety of orientations in buildings currently identified as pub- lic libraries. Peristasis (or double wall construction) is described in detail by Vitruvius and by the Astynomeion inscription at Pergamon; both sources confirm its function as protection against dampness. Vitruvius, however, is concerned with the problems of wall paintings, and the Astynomeion in- scription, as well as numerous Pergamene buildings, attests to a wide use of peristasis in many building types. At Per- gamon and perhaps elsewhere, the primary factors that dic- tated the use of peristasis were the terrain and fears of water runoff, rather than the building type or its contents. It seems necessary to re-evaluate the corridors and peri- stasis in buildings identified as libraries, especially because many such identifications rely heavily on the current view of library characteristics. It is important to consider 1) the re- lationship of each building to the terrain and to neighboring buildings, 2) structural necessities in the construction of the building, and 3) other possible functions for the corridors. THE DANUBIAN IRON GATE IN PREHISTORY: RESULTS OF SALVAGE EXCAVATIONS, 1965-1984: Borislav Jovanovid, Archaeological Institute, Belgrade Because of the construction of two hydroelectric dams at the end of and below the Iron Gate gorge of the Danube, a series of large-scale salvage excavation projects was ini- tiated on the Yugoslav (S) bank of the Danube in 1964 to examine and record the remains of prehistoric, Roman, early Byzantine, and medieval cultures there. The Iron Gate, or Djerdap I, surveys and excavations lasted until 1970 and were directed by the Archaeological Institute, Bel- grade. The Djerdap II project began in 1978 and continues to the present; it is carried out by a special research com- mittee directed by Dr. Vladimir Kondia, Archaeological In- stitute, Belgrade. The prehistoric sites investigated range in date from the Early or Proto-Neolithic to the end of the Iron Age and the Roman occupation of the region. At the very beginning of the Neolithic, and marking the transition from hunting and gathering to sedentary agriculture here, excavation revealed the existence of a hitherto unsuspected and highly developed local culture with organized settlement plans and monu- mental sculpture. Called after its type site in the Danube gorge, Lepenski Vir, the same cultural assemblage appears in the gorge at 4 other south bank sites (Padina, Vlasac, HajduEka Vodenica, and Stubica), some locations on the Romanian bank, and on at least one site below the Iron Gate, Kula near Mihailovac. The Final Neolithic and Bronze Age appear to be char- acterized by the early and indigenous development of tech- nologies for mining and processing copper ores. The most typical sites with these characteristics are grouped around the mouth of the Porecka river, which connects with the Bor-Majdanpek ore fields. These developments probably parallel the very early copper mining and refining at Rudna Glava S of the Danube. The Iron Age cultures here are a composite of Thracian, Dacian and Illyrian elements which do not differ substantially from contemporary populations over the wider area of Serbia and Vojvodina. Celtic influ- ences, however, in the later Iron Age are not strong in this region. One clear pattern seems to emerge in the prehistory of the region, that of decreasing isolation from neighboring peoples and influences-a process undoubtedly accelerated by the attraction of the immense metal resources located just S of the Danube here. ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXCAVATION AND SURVEY OF THE GALLO-ROMAN SITE AT GRAND: Lisa C. Kahn, University of Missouri-Columbia The completion of both the excavation of the sector known as "Devant Matelotte" and of a surface survey di- rected by the author covering over 24 km.2 has provided abundant evidence about this ancient urban center. The Ro- man site at Grand, known for its huge theater-amphitheater and richly adorned basilica, had served as a Celtic sanctuary dedicated to Grannus and was Romanized in the 1st c. A.C. It had political importance due to its location near the W limit of the Leuci civitates as well as the provincial borders of Belgica, Germania Superior, and Lugdunensis. It is sit- uated on a densely wooded plateau and far from the major routes. These characteristics establish Grand as a concilia- bulum, a term now generally accepted for such religious sanctuaries.</page><page sequence="18">1985] THE EIGHTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING 337 Recent work has added greatly to the understanding of the role of such sites. The economic base of this ancient city is being revealed through evidence of local metalworking as well as of agricultural and lumber industries. A part of the urban center has been uncovered; remains of well con- structed stone houses furnished with cellars and hypocausts (lst-3rd cs.) were found lying below impoverished later Ro- man remains. A late boundary wall defining the extent of the shrunken later habitation area was discovered. Neither the survey nor the excavations yielded finds datable to the 5th through 9th cs., although a Merovingian necropolis was found 2 km. from the village. Such evidence suggests that the site was virtually abandoned during this time and only fully inhabited again in the 10th or 11th c. THE CHIEFTAIN CUP: A CRETAN RITE OF PASSAGE: Robert B. Koehl, Florida State University The traditional interpretation of the Chieftain Cup from Haghia Triada sees the figure on the right as a king or di- vinity before whom stands a priest offering three hides car- ried by attendants (F. Forsdyke, JWarb 15 [1952] 13-19). This paper offers a different interpretation, based on the iconographic relationship of the two main figures to compa- rable ones in Minoan art, and on later literary testimonia for Cretan social customs. In Minoan art, specific male hairstyles correspond to stages of maturation. Children have their hair shaved ex- cept for a few long locks. In adolescence the hair is grown out and gathered in a topknot, while in young manhood the hair is waist-length and combed in locks before the shoul- ders and ears. The mature adult wears a beard and shoul- der-length hair. Several scholars argue that Classical Crete preserved traditions that reflect Bronze Age customs. One in particu- lar involves an initiation into manhood whereby an adoles- cent was abducted by a young man who presented the ab- ductee with traditional gifts: military dress, an ox and a drinking cup. Thereafter the abductee belonged to an elite and privileged class. The Chieftain Cup can thus be seen as evidence for a Mi- noan rite of passage. The long-haired young man on the right, rather than receiving, is actually offering the hides, military gear, and probably the chalice itself to the "top- knotted" adolescent initiate, who will then be permitted to release his topknot and wear the long locks of his select class. PYGMIES IN THE COLD PLUNGE: THE SARNO BATH PAINTINGS AT POMPEII: Ann Olga Koloski-Ostrow, University of Michigan The painted decoration of the frigidarium in level 4 of the Sarno Baths (VIII.2.17-21) at Pompeii was uncovered in the 1880s and has remained virtually unpublished (cf. Noack and Lehmann-Hartleben, Baugeschichtl. Unter- suchungen . . . Pompeji [1936], Schefold, Vergessenes Pom- peji [1962], and Ling in MilRome 91 [1979]). This paper presents the material in its entirety for the first time, places it chronologically within the history of Pompeian wall deco- ration, and discusses the thematic interplay among the sur- viving fragments. The pertinent ancient literature on baths and bathing practices (which explains the Roman attitude about what should and did take place in baths), is summarized, and the three surviving categories of paintings from the frigidarium are reviewed. The mythological scenes are discussed first: a river god (Sarno?), Hylas and the water nymphs, a possible Homeric scene, and Ganymede clutched by the eagle. Some genre scenes are examined next: nymphs and hippocamps in watery settings, pastoral landscapes and animal depictions. The paper focuses on the extraordinary pygmy scenes (Nilotic in flavor) around the bright blue frigidarium basin, and offers some suggestions about their content and mean- ing. Comparable examples are available from other settings in Pompeii and Herculaneum-especially from other small public baths. It is clear that the Sarno frigidarium paintings, taken as a whole, represent the very raison d'etre of the Roman bath- a place in which to bathe, to exercise, to socialize, to gratify sexual desire, and to laugh-all requisite activities, accord- ing to Roman sources, for the maintenance of a healthy body and a sound mind. THE DANUBIAN FRONTIER OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE IN THE IRON GATE REGION: RESULTS OF SALVAGE EXCAVATIONS, 1965-1984: Vladimir Kondit, Ar- chaeological Institute, Belgrade Excavations at a large number of sites in and below the Iron Gate gorge have permitted the documentation of the defensive system on this crucial sector of the Danubian frontier from the early Empire to the collapse of Byzantine control in the early 7th c. Additionally, two major epi- graphic discoveries-a second monumental Trajanic in- scription (recording additional improvements to Danubian navigation by that Emperor with the construction of a barge canal at Sip at the end of the Iron Gate gorge) and a tetrar- chic building record (referring to a major renovation of the limes defenses under Diocletian and continued under Con- stantine)-have provided more precise information about the direct interventions of those Emperors for the develop- ment and defense of the region. The types of fortifications constructed on this frontier range from watch towers and barrier walls across river mouths (late Roman) to varying sizes of temporary and per- manent military bases. Because of their location on bluffs above the Danube, thus safe from artificial flooding caused by the hydroelectric dams, most complete information has been obtained from the fortresses at Karatal/Diana and Kostol/Pontes-the latter taking its name from Trajan's nearby bridge, of which substantial remains are preserved. These larger permanent installations begin with palisade forts around the middle of the 1st c. A.C., continue with masonry architecture in the Flavian or Trajanic periods, and see major periods of rebuilding under Septimius Seve- rus, the tetrarchy, and finally Justinian. Definitive aban- donment of the frontier installations occurred as a result of the Slavic migrations in the 7th c.</page><page sequence="19">338 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 Excavation reports for the Iron Gate I excavations were published in Starinar, the annual of the Archaeological Institute, vols. 33-34 (1982-83) in July 1984; the Iron Gate II reports appear in a special monograph series, Djer- dapske Sveske (vol. 1, Belgrade, 1980; vol. 2, 1984; vol. 3, forthcoming). KOLLYBOI OR SYMBOLA?: John H. Kroll, University of Texas at Austin The term kollybos, which ultimately came to denote a bronze coin of very small denomination, is first attested in Aristophanes' Peace, line 1200, in 421 B.C. Accordingly, Svoronos (JIAN 1911, 123-60) proposed that Athens must have been minting bronze kollyboi at that time, and that they were to be identified in an extensive series of small (6-8 mm.) Athenian bronze tokens variously stamped with let- ters of the alphabet and/or pictorial types. Several hundred varieties are known. Although Svoronos' identification has been questioned by Reinach, Gardner, and Crosby, it has remained customary to refer to these pieces as kollyboi and to regard them as Athens' first bronze coinage, instituted as an emergency measure during the Peloponnesian War. The present paper reviews the overwhelming chronolog- ical, comparative, and iconographical evidence against this theory and concludes that the objects, which date largely from the Hellenistic period, are non-monetary tokens or symbola, used, like the very similar, larger Athenian sym- bola of bronze or lead, for a wide variety of public purposes, probably including admission and seating at judicial and legislative meetings and at festival performances. The use of letters on many of the tokens is especially decisive in this regard, since at Athens letters were regularly employed for subdividing large groups of the citizen body (e.g., jurors) into smaller organizational and seating units. Whether or not the kollybos ever became an officially recognized coin denomination in later Athens, the term when used by Ari- stophanes in the 5th c. apparently applies not to a coin but simply to a minimal notational value. GEOMETRIC GIFT-EXCHANGE: OBSERVATIONS ON BRONZE VOTIVE OFFERINGS: Susan Langdon, Uni- versity of Vermont How the specific sites of Olympia, Delphi and other sanctuaries were selected for formalized worship is one of the unresolved problems of the Geometric period. Research has generally focused on the controversy over continuity of cult use from the Bronze Age, a phenomenon archaeologi- cally undemonstrated at mainland sanctuaries. A study of Geometric figurines and tripods provides a clue to factors in the foundation of these panhellenic sites. Although the operation of a social system based on gift- exchange is well illustrated in the Homeric poems (Finley 1954), the reality of such a system from 1100-700 B.C. is not supported by archaeological evidence from domestic con- texts. A study of the distribution of bronze figurines and tri- pods reveals that they occur solely in sanctuary contexts. It is suggested here that the gift-exchange system of heroic socie- ty served as a model for Geometric votive offering by the aristocratic class, the actual religious ritual of dedication thus paralleling the social ritual of epic tradition. Based on reciprocation rather than profit, the effective functioning of such a system requires that goods be kept in circulation; it is therefore further proposed that the aristocratic class founded certain panhellenic sanctuaries on land to which they claimed ties. "Reciprocation" took the form of establishing claims to land and class while maintaining a form of control over the valued goods. Patterned after heroic behavior in epic poetry, the worship of an aristocratic pantheon and the pursuit of the heroic ethos through games and gift-giving were instrumental in establishing aristocratic lineage. THE GELADAKIS PAINTER IN THE POTTERS' QUARTER AT CORINTH: Patricia Lawrence, Louisiana State University In Corinth 15:3, material associated with the followers of the Dodwell Painter is limited to a late pyxis and a frag- ment of an oinochoe or pyxis by the Geladakis Painter; two other pyxis sherds are related to his latest style. The Dod- well Painter himself is neither represented in Corinth 15:3 nor indexed for references to his style. Two other followers, the Ampersand Painter and the Painter of Athens 931, are indexed only for cross-references. Anyone who assumed that the publication included all of the named styles of the period whose products were among the masses of pottery excavated from the narrow strip along the west city wall of Corinth might conclude that the two items by the Geladakis Painter were "strays" and that the Dodwellians were not among the Middle Corinthian vase painters who are some- how associated by virtue of their presence there. In July 1983, when I was asked to check the uninven- toried sherds from the Potters' Quarter for material belong- ing to another Corinthian group, I found fragments of eight Geladakian vases, seven of which seem to be by the Gelada- kis Painter himself. Three are from vase shapes that he was not known heretofore to have decorated. These eight vases are discussed in the present paper, on the basis of D.A. Amyx's lists in "Dodwelliana" (CSCA 4 [1971] 1-48) and Corinthian Vase-Painting of the Archaic Period. In October 1984 Amyx identified eight sherds from the North Dump, representing at least five vases, which are by the Dodwell Painter himself. He also found an additional fragment by the Geladakis Painter. It is obvious that, however great the range of material inventoried by the excavator and published in Corinth 15:3, no statistical conclusions should be drawn until all the con- text material has been studied, and even then the limited extent of the excavated area must be considered. ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR HITTITE CULT STATUARY: Nancy W. Leinwand, Bryn Mawr College As is the case in much of the Near East, material evidence for Hittite cult statuary is scarce. The forms and, to a certain extent, the materials and construction of Hittite cult statuary</page><page sequence="20">1985] THE EIGHTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING 339 are known from contemporary iconographical and textual sources. Cult scenes depicting offering before deities that are set on podia or in niches, such as on the stone reliefs of Alaca Hoyfik, appear to illustrate worship before cult statues. A number of texts from Bogazkoy describe actual cult images including their material, dimensions and attributes. I have restudied the finds from a deposit of Hittite cult objects from the site of Alaca H6yiuk. The material was found by Kogay ca. 1939 and published somewhat later by him (Alaca Hiiyiik 1937-1939). The deposit includes: a beaked pitcher in terracotta; a seated female statuette, parts of a composite statuette of a bull, a pair of figurines in the form of reclining bulls, and a relief plaque with a design of bullmen and winged disc, all of metal. The forms represented by the statuary from the deposit parallel the iconographical types known in other media. The material and construction correspond to those de- scribed in the Hittite texts. Fragments of similar statuettes have appeared at Bogazkoy. As a result of the re-examina- tion of the cult deposit from Alaca Hdytik, the original com- position of the objects can be partly reconstructed. In addi- tion, the statuary can now be recognized as a part of Hittite cult inventory and as material evidence for one form of cult statuary. WHEN DID NERO FREE ACHAEA? EVIDENCE FROM THE COINAGE OF SICYON: Brooks Emmons Levy, Princeton University Suetonius, Nero 24.2, puts the liberation of Achaea at the end of Nero's Greek trip in 66-67 A.C.; Dio 63.11.1 implies it came at the beginning. The Acraephia decree (IGC VII.2713=SIG3 814), which records the honors then awarded Nero as "Zeus Eleutherios," specifies the procla- mation day as Nov. 28, but its year-dating formula is irreg- ular and cannot be used to settle the larger question. Most scholars have preferred Suetonius' version. Bronze coinage of Nero from Sicyon (Fisher, Hesperia 49 [1980] 6-9) pro- vides evidence for the early date. The issue has always been considered rare, but in fact over forty examples can still be located. Judged by relative survival, this represents a con- siderable mintage: of the few mints then active in provincia Achaea, only Corinth and perhaps Patrae struck more coin- age during Nero's visit. This, however, was Sicyon's only Imperial issue, apart from a brief revival under the Seve- rans. Exceptional circumstances must be supposed, proba- bly Sicyonian games attended by the emperor. The obverse legend of the Sicyonian issue reads "N(eron) K(aisar) Zeus Eleutherios": it was struck after the liber- ation of Achaea. But games could hardly have been held between Nov. 28, 67 and Nero's departure-which, in Sue- tonius' version, immediately followed the liberation. There- fore the early date must be correct. If the liberation occurred soon after Nero's arrival, most of the games he attended, as well as those at Sicyon, will have taken place after it. They should be regarded not only as a vehicle for his "command performances" (the view of hostile ancient sources) but as the normal Greek response to such benefactions. CHOU CHINA: Katheryn M. Linduff, University of Pittsburgh The Chou dynasty (ca. 1050-221 B.C.) encompassed the establishment of the basic institutions of Chinese culture and the founding and growth of an urbanized mercantile civilization. Among the former are an aristocratic kinship system, a political ideology based on the concept of a Man- date of Heaven, and a territory conceived as the Central Kingdom (Chung-kuo), a concept which defines China as a state, a nation and a civilization. During the Western Chou (ca. 1050-771 B.C.) the royal house consolidated its dominion by granting fiefdoms to its clan members and to its most faithful ministers. The base of the economy was agriculture. On it the Chou built a diverse culture whose accomplishments included bronze casting, se- riculture and weaving, ceramics including protoporcelain, lacquerware, and jade and ivory carving. Increases in agri- cultural production and crafts led to the spread and inten- sification of trade and to the circulation of money. The rise of prosperous cities followed. During the Eastern Chou (770-221 B.C.) iron was discovered and worked. The ex- cavation of foundries has supplied precise information on mining and metallurgy. Politically the Chou state lost cohesion after 770 B.C. and broke up into many separate states. Constant warfare among them did not encourage economic expansion except in armaments. The Central Kingdom was not reunified un- til 221 B.C. when the King of Ch'in did so by conquest. A product of the period of disunion was the writings of the political theorists and philosophers whose ideas shaped sub- sequent Chinese thought until this century. The culture we think of as Chinese is descended from the work of Chou artisans and thinkers. Colloquium: Stages in the Emergence of Civilization and the State in Early China. See Chang and James. THE METHOD OF THE ODYSSEY LANDSCAPES PAINTER: Steven Lowenstam, University of Oregon The labels (epigrammata) of the Odyssey Landscapes in- dicate that the painter generally attempted to be faithful to the Homeric text. In "Land of the Laestrygonians," for in- stance, the inscription AKTAI alludes to Od. 10.89, while NOMAI in "The Laestrygonians Attack" echoes Od. 10.85. On the other hand, none of the Actae or water deities is labeled because they are not mentioned as such by Homer. For an episode like "Land of the Laestrygonians," however, about which Homer merely says that Odysseus "chose two men with a herald as the third" (Od. 10.102), the painter selected suitable names. From his knowledge of Od. 19.247 he labeled the herald Eurybates. Of all the Greek names he might have selected for the other two, he picked two from elsewhere in the Odyssey, one that of a dead man (Anti- lochos), the other of a living (Euryalos). By this means he approximated the Homeric text, in which we are told that one of the companions was killed by the Laestrygonians and the others escaped (Od. 10.117-18). To whom should we credit this poetic faithfulness? The</page><page sequence="21">340 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 debate usually considers either a contemporary Roman or a Hellenistic Greek. In fact, like the Homeric works them- selves, the paintings result from a long tradition, in this case going back at least to the 5th c. The "Underworld Land- scapes" are indebted to Polygnotus' paintings in the Cnidian Lesche, for which one can cite Odysseus' crouching posi- tion, the beardless Eurybates, and the Danaides, who repre- sent an ironic allusion to Polygnotus' uninitiated women. THE WILD COUNTRY WEST OF IDHA: THE PREHIS- TORY OF THE KHANIA NOMOS: F.E. Lukermann, J. Moody, University of Minnesota Since 1978 we have been working in the Khania Nomos in order to clarify the character of its prehistoric occupation. One of the methods was an intensive surface survey within a 3-hour walking time of the city of Khania. Of all the known prehistoric sites in the Khania Nomos, 78% now fall within our survey area and about 98% of these were actually dis- covered by the survey. Such statistics indicate that the cur- rent site distribution reflects uneven archaeological explora- tion. Despite this limitation, a characteristic pattern seems to emerge. Our understanding of the Early, Middle, and Late Neo- lithic of the region is still poor. The only significant observa- tions that can be made are: 1) the ceramics seem to follow the traditions of Central and Southern Crete; 2) the sites seem to be confined to caves. By the Final Neolithic the pic- ture begins to change. Of the 18 known FN sites, all but one are open sites. Of the sites that date to EM-MM I, only 50% are located on or near the coast. The coastal sites include the larger set- tlements, while the non-coastal sites tend to be small, trans- ient, open occupations or caves. Within the survey region these sites are largely confined to 3 out of a possible 49 areas. This suggests that EM-MM I settlements were strongly nucleated. In contrast to the EM-MM I nucleated pattern is the dispersed and fairly uniform distribution of MM I-II sites. None of these sites is large, with the possible exception of Khania:Kastelli. By MM III-LM I, nucleated settlements reappear. Cu- riously, human activity in many coastal areas that had been previously occupied declines dramatically. These two trends become more pronounced in LM III. One notable differ- ence between the LM I and LM III settlement patterns is an increase in size but decrease in number of LM III sites. This phenomenon suggests that while the absolute popula- tion of the region may have remained constant from LM I to LM III, certain cultural and/or environmental changes caused it to be redistributed. HELLENISM AND THE SICELS: THE ARCHAIC NECRO- POLIS OF MORCGANTINA: Claire L. Lyons, Archaeo- logical Institute of America The archaic necropolis of Morgantina, a hellenized town of the Sicilian interior, consists of 61 tombs excavated be- tween 1957 and 1976 under the auspices of Princeton Uni- versity, the University of Illinois and the Soprintendenza alle AntichitA of Agrigento. The tombs, ranging in date from the late 8th to the mid-5th c., are located on the steep slopes of the Cittadella, the site of Siculan occupation from the Early Bronze Age. The series of tombs which ring the hilltop settlement combines Siculan and Greek tomb types, burial practices and grave goods. Of the graves, 71% are chamber tombs of the native type, which develop from small oven-shaped cavi- ties into large rectangular rooms furnished with rock-cut klinai and masonry facades employing Greek architectural elements. Tomb types characteristic of the Greek colonial cemeteries such as fossa graves, sarcophagi, tile graves and enchytrismos burials are introduced in the later 6th c. De- spite the occasional use of individual inhumation in the graves of Greek type, the traditional Siculan rite of multiple burial, with up to 16 individuals in a single tomb, remains the common practice. The opening of trade routes to the interior is reflected by the presence of Attic, Corinthian and Laconian vases, which appear in quantity in the tombs by the first half of the 6th c. The adoption of Greek shapes by the native potters, who were strongly influenced by East Greek household wares, progressively transformed the native repertoire. A number of terracotta protomes perhaps representing Persephone may indicate an acceptance of some form of Greek religion by the local inhabitants. Although it has been suggested by Sjaqvist (Sicily and the Greeks [1973] 26-35) that the transformation of the site from an indigenous to a hellenized settlement was precip- itated by the arrival of Greeks from one of the coastal colo- nies, the evidence of the archaic necropolis reveals a fun- damental cultural continuity within the community. The selective adoption of Greek practices was more likely the result of increased prosperity and commercial contact with the colonies rather than of any direct influence from resi- dent "foreigners." ISLAMIC TEXTILES: Louise W. Mackie, Royal Ontario Museum Dyed and patterned Islamic textiles were among the most prestigious possessions in the medieval world, indica- tors of status and wealth. While textile industries were often the primary economic resource locally, luxurious fabrics in silk, cotton, wool and linen frequently achieved internation- al acclaim and were traded across huge expanses, reaching from Iran through North Africa to Islamic Spain. Because of their treasured status, textiles were often transmitters of artistic styles. Today, some groups of archaeological textile finds are the primary preservers of artistic styles of specific cultures, especially in Egypt and Iran. Some of these documentary textiles are discussed in this paper, along with a singular major find of about 3000 items. Excavated at Fustat (Old Cairo) in 1980 by G. Scanlon, they are dated between ca. 750 and 1100 A.C. on the basis of comparative finds. The corpus provides insight into daily fabrics in a variety of fi- bers, colors, patterns and woven structures, and includes</page><page sequence="22">1985] THE EIGHTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING 341 fabrics imported from Iran, Iraq and Islamic Spain.

McConnell, Brown University The analysis of foreign materials found at prehistoric sites in the Maltese archipelago is useful in explaining the development of Malta's extraordinary megalithic temple culture during the Maltese Copper Age. Examination of data presented in J.D. Evans' fundamental corpus, The Prehistoric Antiquities of the Maltese Islands, reveals an in- crease in the diversity of materials such as obsidian, flint, greenstone, red ochre and copper, and of their uses from the 6th through the 3rd millennium B.C. Only the types of ma- terial change with the advent of the Bronze Age, not the range of types. Recent research has confirmed the existence of Maltese trading outposts in Sicily during the Bronze Age, and it is reasonable to postulate a significant degree of Siculo-Mal- tese exchange activity in earlier periods. The discovery of artifacts pertaining to a prehistoric Maltese textile industry suggests that textile products may have been exported as early as the Copper Age. The importation of materials into Malta is associated with the production of textiles for exportation to the extent that evidence for both appears within the territorial zones of chiefdoms which have'been proposed for each megalithic temple-complex. The organization of Malta's Copper Age economy under the authority, possibly theocratic, of local chiefs offers a viable explanation for the development of symbolic and commercial exchange relationships with for- eign societies, particularly those in nearby Sicily. The reor- ganization of such relationships in the Tarxien Cemetery phase of the Bronze Age may reflect the collapse of such an economy as much as the appearance in Malta of new folk from abroad. THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN COMPOSITE BOW: SOME NOTES ON ITS STRUCTURE AND PERFORMANCE: Ed- ward McEwen, Wallace McLeod, University of Toronto Some 43 composite bows survive from ancient Egypt. Their structure was described, and their performance as- sessed, in McLeod, Composite Bows from the Tomb of Tut'ankham in (Oxford 1970). The two unpublished com- paranda-Cairo, J.E. 31389, and T.R. ~- are pre- 23 [ sented here more fully, by courtesy of the Egyptian Mu- seum, Cairo, together with measured cross-sections at the grip. Both bows, from Dynasty XVIII, measure ca. 1.35 m. from tip to tip in a straight line, and consist of sinew backing and horn facing applied to a wooden core-a section typical for later composites, but abnormal for Egypt. There is no direct testimony about the performance of such bows. New Kingdom pharaohs boast of shooting through copper ingots. In more recent times, Hellmuth Me- bert and Saxton Pope have tried to duplicate the bows, but neither is as explicit as we could wish about either structure or performance. An experienced bowyer, Edward McEwen of London (see the London Telegraph Sunday Magazine, No. 342, 1 May 1983, 14-16), who has been reconstructing ancient composites for 25 years, has now made replicas of these two bows. They took about 6 months to complete (far less than previous guesses). They are light weapons, with draw-weights of 18 and 23 kg. at 90 cm. They are extraordi- narily elastic, and seem capable of any draw-length. They are smooth to shoot, without any kick at release, extremely accurate, and cast a 40-g. arrow 160 and 169 m. respectively. McLeod, W. See McEwen, E. STONE STAIRCASES IN SICILIAN TEMPLES: Margaret M. Miles, University of California, Berkeley Unique to the design of classical temples in Western Greece are interior stone staircases leading to the attic, a feature which would have added considerable labor and cost to construction. In Sicily-at Akragas, Himera and Seli- nous-6 temples were built with a symmetrical pair of stairs. The most unusual of these are the round spiral stair- cases in Temple A at Selinous. Hodge (The Woodwork of Greek Roofs [Cambridge 1960] 36-44) has demonstrated that these stairs did not simply provide access for mainte- nance of roof timbers, but had some special purpose, either ceremonial or for the storage of votives. Central to the prob- lem of the use of the attic area is the reconstruction of the roof timbers, with "prop and lintel" supports, or trusses, which would have left little space. Meiggs (Trees and Tim- bers in the Ancient Mediterranean [Oxford 1982]) has now shown that since architects in Sicily had nearby one of the best supplies of timber in the Mediterranean, the Sila in south Italy, the cellas of the temples could have been spanned without trusses. Hence, the attics in most of these temples would have been spacious enough to accommodate religious rituals. New evidence for opaion tiles also suggests active use of the attic spaces (Wikander, "OHAIA KEPA- MIL: Skylights in the Ancient World," OpRom 14 [1983] 81-99). This paper examines the evidence for the use of the attic space in Sicilian temples, with comparisons to temples in mainland Greece. In addition to possible ceremonial as- cents and descents, perhaps in cults of a feminine nature, the stairs themselves may have been symbolic of connections with the upper world of the gods. BOSCOREALE AND MACEDONIAN SHIELDS: Stella G. Miller, University of Cincinnati The megalographic cycle of the Roman villa at Bosco- reale has been much discussed ever since its discovery at the</page><page sequence="23">342 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 beginning of this century. The surviving paintings, now di- vided mainly between the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the National Museum, Naples, depict one or more figures in panels separated by architectural frame- work of the Second Style. There is general consensus that a single theme links the individual panels, but its precise nature is controversial. Are the figures portraits, Greek or Roman? Are they part of a mythological, historical, or even allegorical program? What are the prototypes? These questions and others have been asked a number of different times and answered in nearly as many ways, most recently by K. Fittschen in Neue For- schungen in Pompeji (Recklinghausen 1975) 93-100. In the search for thematic unity of the cycle, it is uni- versally recognized as a major problem that parts of the cycle are missing. I suggest that a second, so-far unrecog- nized hindrance to interpretation exists, namely failure to note that the cycle is undoubtedly a pastiche. This can best be demonstrated on compositional grounds in the panel in Naples with the so-called Macedonian shield. Recent dis- coveries in Macedonia help confirm speculation that proto- types of the cycle derive from that area. In addition, they suggest what the original configuration of the shield panel may have been. Once the eclectic nature of the composition of the cycle is recognized, new directions of interpretation become possible. THE ROMAN ARCH AT ISTHMIA: Harrianne Mills, Timothy E. Gregory, Kenyon College, Ohio State University During the Roman Empire a monumental arch spanned the main approach to the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia. Although its remains have been known since 1883, it has not previously been studied and has been ignored in the lit- erature on Roman art and architecture in Greece. Since 1967, however, the arch has been the subject of excavation and research by the Isthmia Excavations of UCLA which have permitted detailed study and restoration. The arch was an Ionic monument with 3 passageways. The form of the arch is understandably Roman, but the exe- cution and much of the detail are clearly Greek, testimony to the blending of native and Italian workmanship in the Corinthia during early Roman times. The arch also exhibits many individual characteristics, such as extreme thinness and a remarkable carelessness in the execution of many ar- chitectural details, which reveal much about the techniques used by local craftsmen. Construction of the arch can be placed in the last third of the 1st c. A.C., but its purpose remains uncertain. It may have been connected with an Im- perial visit or donation to the Sanctuary, but it must also have marked an important boundary, either of the Sanc- tuary or even of the Peloponnesos itself. Moody, J. See Lukermann, F.E. "PATRICIAN" TASTE AND THE CASA DEL FAUNO: Chris- topher Moss, Princeton University The Casa del Fauno in Pompeii has long been regarded as the epitome of conservative patrician taste: opulent in its proportions, yet spare and linear in decoration. The decora- tive scheme of the house as a whole has been characterized as "sober," "grave," and "fusty," enlivened only by the pre- sence of the bronze faun on its low base in the center of the impluvium. In its original state, however, the atrium of the Casa del Fauno presented an entirely different visual impression: the bronze faun was in fact not displayed in the impluvium and was only one element of a highly ornamented sculptural grouping. Directly behind the impluvium stood a massive marble table embellished with peopled vine scrolls and ro- bust lion-griffins, while on the rim of the impluvium was an elegant pedestal with complex moldings and relief panels depicting crouching panthers. The pedestal was photo- graphed in situ in 1851 by the French architect Alfred-Ni- cholas Normand; the table, drawn by the Niccolinis in 1854, has been located in the storerooms at Pompeii and re- composed from a number of fragments by the author and Robert Cohon. The findspot of the bronze faun suggests that it was placed atop the pedestal as the crowning element of the ensemble. The restoration of this ornate assemblage as the visual focal point of the "austere" Casa del Fauno significantly al- ters our perception of the decoration of the house, and should prompt a reassessment of what we conceive to be patrician concepts of taste and decor. A LATE ROMAN KILN SITE IN THE HERMIONID, GREECE: Mary Lou Zimmerman Munn, Stanford University Among the Late Roman sites studied by the Stanford Southern Argolid Survey is site B-19, opposite Kounoupi island between Ermioni and Porto Cheli. Late Roman C and African Red Slip wares and a coin of Phokas date the site from the 5th through the early 7th c. A.C. Traces of at least one pottery kiln and wasters identify B-19 as a pottery production center. Optical emission spectroscopy conducted by the Fitch Laboratory shows transport amphoras and coarsewares from the site to be a homogeneous group (Me- gaw and Jones, BSA 78 [1983] 235-63). A particular type of spirally grooved transport amphora was manufactured at the site. The type is documented at sites on the W coast of the Black Sea (Scorpan, Type VII-A, Pontica 9 [1976] 159, pl. 7.3, 7, and Dacia 21 [1977] 274-77; Radalescu, Pontica 9 [1976] 107, pl. 8.1-la). J. Riley has recently added Carthage and Cyrenaica to the dis- tribution range of the amphora (LR Amphora 2, Excava- tions at Carthage 1977, 122). Examples have also been noted in the Athenian Agora (Robinson, pl. 40, P 4129) and at Halieis (Rudolph, Hesperia 48 [1979] 294-320). B-19 is the only kiln site yet identified for this common LR ampho- ra, although the existence of several manufacturing centers in the Pontic and Aegean area is generally assumed. Numerous mortaria at LR sites in the southern Argolid indicate the large scale production of olive oil. Olive oil must</page><page sequence="24">1985] THE EIGHTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING 343 have been exported in these locally manufactured ampho- ras, accounting for some part of the distribution. The south- ern Argolid is thus shown to have been a center for the pro- duction and export of olive oil during the LR period until the abandonment of sites in the early 7th c. A.C., when this area felt the effects of the Slavic invasions. A LATE CLASSICAL RURAL SETTLEMENT PHENOME- NON IN THE SOUTHERN ARGOLID, GREECE: Mark H. Munn, Stanford University The Stanford Argolid Exploration Project has discovered a significant change in settlement pattern within the terri- tories of Hermione and Halieis in the period ca. 350-250 B.C. This is shown by: a) a substantial increase in the num- ber of sites throughout the region, which took place despite b) the abandonment of a high proportion of older sites; c) new characteristics at the majority of sites; d) evidence for the substantial impact of this settlement pattern on the land- scape of the region. 110 late Classical-early Hellenistic sites are known, as compared with 54 Classical and 46 Hellenistic sites. Loca- tion, size and characteristic cross-sections of tablewares, cooking wares, utility and storage vessels indicate that most of these new sites were farmsteads. Such an increase in farmsteads represents an intensifica- tion of agricultural activity due probably to social and eco- nomic factors, not merely to population growth. It seems likely that extensive olive cultivation for oil export was the economic basis for the change. Press beds, weight stones and numerous storage pithoi found on these sites are consistent with this hypothesis. Pollen analysis (M. Sheehan, diss. In- diana U. 1979) demonstrates that olive cultivation peaked at approximately this time. The period also saw a phase of widespread soil erosion (K. Pope and T. van Andel, Journal of Archaeological Science 1984), which is indicative of ex- tensive cultivation combined with inadequate terracing or terrace maintenance. It is unlikely that this phenomenon is unique to the Southern Argolid. The export of produce implies a broader market system whose economic impact cut across city-state boundaries. It is hoped that this phenomenon will be recog- nized elsewhere in the spheres of the Saronic and Argolic gulfs, if not farther afield. EXCAVATIONS AT KHIRBET ISKANDER, 1984: AREA B: Mary-Louise Mussell, Drew University A third season of excavation was conducted at Khirbet Iskander, Jordan, sponsored by the American Schools of Oriental Research and under the direction of Dr. Suzanne Richard, between July 4 and August 6, 1984. In the past two seasons Khirbet Iskander, on the N bank of the Wadi Wala near Dhiban, revealed much concerning the little known EB IV period in Palestine-Transjordan. The focus of work in this season was the lateral exposure of Areas B and C. Area B, in the NW corner of the site, was initially estab- lished to investigate the 2 m. wide perimeter wall with its tower/corner room, and the associated domestic architec- ture. Investigation of the perimeter wall continued in square B4, resulting in the definitive dating of the wall to EB IV. Four new squares (B5-B8) set out within the limits of the perimeter wall revealed two phases of domestic occupa- tion. The upper, or "broad room" phase, consists of two broad-room houses. The lower phase, at present confined to squares B7 and B8, is contemporary with the E-W wall, which acts as a reinforcement for the perimeter wall. This phase is to be noted for its large cache of whole and restor- able vessels, some in situ on low benches. Initial study of the pottery indicates that we must re-evaluate the current chro- nological phases of EB IV pottery. THE ROLE OF MALE FIGURES IN THE CAERETAN VI- GNACCIA DEPOSIT: Helen Nagy, Linfield College This paper is a further report on the Vignaccia deposit from Caere in the Lowie Museum of Anthropology, U.C. Berkeley. Since the deposit contains predominantly female figures and heads as well as various offerings associated with fertility, the presence of male figures poses questions of identity and function. Although not very numerous (less than 10%), the male figurines represent a surprisingly rich variety of types which can be divided into 6 basic categories: musicians, warriors, a few recognizable deities, Dionysiac figures, con- sorts or companions in pairs, and miscellaneous figures with no clear iconographic definition. Stylistically they range from Severe to late Hellenistic; some exhibit a clear reliance on Greek or South Italian prototypes, while others can best be described as indigenous or "Etruscan." Each category contains some representatives of both regional styles. The musicians are youthful and either hold a small lyre or play the double flutes. The warriors, possibly represent- ing Ares, vary in armor, facial characteristics and style. Sty- listically these two groups fall predominantly in the indig- enous category. Herakles is the most securely identifiable mythological figure, but occurs only in 4 examples. The Dionysiac realm is suggested by a relatively large number of figurines mostly Hellenistic in style. Among the types are partially clad, wreathed figures holding thyrsoi, some wear- ing panther skins, pudgy silenoi, some playing the double flutes, and a few naked figures reclining in rocky land- scapes. Male figures in a group are always paired with a female companion. A few are seated displaying affection to- ward their partner and in a few cases are accompanied by a child. Such "married" couples are obviously related to the general theme of the deposit: care and fertility. In a few in- stances a standing couple is rendered with the male figure holding a lyre and a rather fat bird perched on the figures' shoulders, between their heads. Noteworthy in the miscel- laneous category is a lovely "Lasus" holding a scroll. Only a few of these figures (e.g., Herakles) can be defi- nitely identified as a mythological type. The lyre-bearing musicians, for example, have been associated just as plau- sibly with Apollo as with a mortal hero. The same is true of</page><page sequence="25">344 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 the warriors. It is equally difficult to assume that, except in a few cases of demurely clad "gentlemen," the subject was intended to render the donor. More likely, the majority of the figures served a guardian or attendant function which, in the case especially of the Dionysiac types, reinforces the general theme of the deposit. ASKLEPIOS AND HYGIEIA AT TEGEA: Naomi J. Nor- man, University of Georgia Pausanias presents an interesting account of the cult stat- ue at Tegea. The original image by the archaic sculptor En- doios was carried off to Rome by Augustus; then a statue of Athena Hippia from nearby Manthyrensis was installed in the temple and came to be known as Athena Alea through- out the Peloponnese. Pausanias says that he saw this statue in the temple flanked by figures of Asklepios and Hygieia, both by Skopas. The Hygieia has been tentatively identified in a well preserved torso found at Tegea. Stewart and others have assumed that Skopas designed the Asklepios and Hy- gieia to flank the archaic statue by Endoios in order to form a group reflecting the complex nature of Athena Alea as a goddess of asylum. This paper shows through an examination of the cult of Asklepios, the testimony of Pausanias, archaeological evi- dence, historical record, Hippocratic writings and the Sko- paic corpus, that these statues did not originally stand be- side Endoios' Athena, or even within the temple cella. Asklepios and Hygieia are not deities traditionally asso- ciated with refuge; furthermore, if they had formed a group with Endoios' Athena, it is unlikely that Augustus would have taken only the central figure, leaving behind the two statues by Skopas. Rather, these healing deities are often as- sociated with water and must have been sculptured by Sko- pas for the nearby spring where Herakles raped Auge; the statues were moved into the cella only when Endoios' statue was removed by Augustus. COLLABORATION IN THE ACHILLES PAINTER'S WORK- SHOP: LOUVRE G 444: John H. Oakley, College of William and Mary A large red-figure lekythos in the Louvre, G 444, is one of only 18 known lekythoi with RF decoration on both the body and the shoulder. Beazley first published a drawing of the scene on the body-a warrior departing and a Nike-in his 1914 article on the Achilles Painter in which he attrib- uted the vase to this artist; the shoulder figures, unfortu- nately, have never been published. Shoulder figures on RF lekythoi are rare, but of the 17 other known examples, 11 come from the Berlin Painter and his students, among whom is the Achilles Painter. The shoulder of the Louvre lekythos is partially pre- served, and only the lower halves of the 4 figures in the do- mestic household scene decorating it remain. Remarkably, they are not by the Achilles Painter but by his student the Phiale Painter-a fact heretofore unrecognized. This makes the Louvre lekythos extremely important because it is the only vase known on which the Achilles Painter and the Phiale Painter collaborated and, in fact, the only vase on which the Phiale Painter worked with another painter. The Achilles Painter collaborated with another painter on 5 oth- er vases; in each case he was clearly the master painter, and the other painter was responsible for the subsidiary or less important decoration. Since the Phiale Painter decorated 5 of the 16 known black-bodied lekythoi with RF decoration on the shoulder, it is not surprising that he performed one of his specialties on the Louvre lekythos for his teacher, the Achilles Painter. A NEW ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AT THE VIA GABINA VIL- LAS: Philip Oliver-Smith, Rice University The ninth season of excavation by Rice University of vil- la sites along the via Gabina provides evidence of even greater economic diversification and specialization than hitherto suspected for these small suburban farms only 14 km. from Rome. During the last two seasons, work has been concentrated on the industrial area of the Julio-Claudian villa at Site 10. In 1982 we reported that this villa produced wine, in contrast to the oil-pressing activity of the smaller villa at Site 11. Unreported until now is the extensive sys- tem of bedrock-cut cuniculi which connect the treading floors and collection vats and allow the must to drain into amphoras placed below. It seems probable that fermenta- tion and storage were also underground, but as yet no large chambers have been discovered. It now appears that the industrial area at Site 10 extends into an eastern wing of the villa outfitted as a fullonica in later phases of occupation. Like the wine-making facilities, the fulling tanks drain into the cuniculi. The underground passageways served multiple functions and had several phases. A possible cloth industry greatly expands our con- cept of the economic role of this villa, both in its immediate zone and in the context of suburban Rome. It also makes the shift to large-scale grain production in the Late Antique pe- riod even more dramatic. The early 5th c. horreum con- structed over the remains of the hortus of the Julio-Claudian villa documents this late economic and social reorganization. THE EMEQ HEFER ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH PROJECT IN ISRAEL, 1983-1984: Samuel M. Paley, Yosef Porath, Robert R. Stieglitz, SUNY-Buffalo and the Brooklyn Museum, Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums, Rutgers University- Newark During the 1983 and 1984 seasons, the joint project in Emeq Hefer enlarged the excavated area of the MB IIA and LB II settlements on Tel Ifshar and the Persian-period building at the port of Tel Mikhmoret. The ancient ceme- tery and a well near the ancient beachfront in the harbor at Mikhmoret were also investigated. At Ifshar, portions of a major stone and mudbrick struc- ture were unearthed. The entrance threshold was con- structed of plastered rubble; a kurkar stone step, 2.45 x 0.70 m., was placed just inside the doorway. The pottery asso-</page><page sequence="26">1985] THE EIGHTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING 345 ciated with this building has traditionally been considered the earliest MB IIA pottery in Israel, even though it has never before been found on living surfaces. This building was destroyed by fire. On the living surfaces of the subse- quent settlement was discovered early 19th c. B.C. Egyptian pottery mixed in with the local MB IIA types. The LB IIA settlement on Ifshar was disturbed; no clear plan of any structure could be obtained from the excavated remains. However, a pottery concentration several meters long and wide and nearly 1 m. deep was excavated; from this "dump" more than 70 complete vessels, local and im- ported, were recovered. At Mikhmoret, 4 Persian-period shaft tombs were ex- plored, all reused in the Hellenistic period. One yielded the earliest articulated camel skeletons known in the Levant. On the tell, the clearance of a Persian-period structure was completed and the chronology of the site established: LB II, IA II, late Iron, Persian, Hellenistic and Byzantine. Be- neath a Byzantine wall, in a Persian installation, a cunei- form tablet was found. PRE-HISPANIC ANDEAN TEXTILES: Anne Paul, Uni- versity of Dallas The inventive genius of ancient Andeans in the textile arts was exceptional. Evenly and tightly twisted threads, dyed with an extensive range of colors, were used in a va- riety of remarkable techniques for the creation of both wo- ven and nonwoven fabrics, and for decorative accessory stitches used to embellish textiles. The many extant speci- mens from a long textile tradition are testament to the inge- nuity of technically skilled and imaginative artists, as a brief review of them demonstrates. Examination of the technical methods employed by the ancient Andean weavers is only one aspect of the study of textile art. This paper also focuses on the symbolic functions of cloth in the Andes. The pre-Hispanic peoples of the An- des expressed many of their important ideas through the medium of cottons and camelid fibers. Garments and head- dresses could indicate an individual's social rank and re- gional affiliation, and the decorative images on these items of costume often expressed the ritual obligations of their wearer. Even mathematical concepts were encoded in knot- ted cotton cords called quipus. I show how cloth transcended the customary role of protection, both emphasizing changes in status within the life cycle and serving as a principal cere- monial item. Colloquium: Ancient Textiles.

UNFINISHED PARACAS GARMENTS: GLIMPSES OF ART- ISTS AT WORK: Anne Paul, University of Dallas The members of the ancient S coast Peruvian culture known today as Paracas wrapped their elite dead in many magnificent embroidered garments before burial in the arid Paracas Peninsula (ca. 450-150 B.C.). Although most of these garments were finished textiles, there are examples in which the embroidered images which decorate the borders and/or the field of a garment were not stitched completely. Such unfinished textiles offer glimpses of the artists at work-glimpses which provide insights into the social and mental organization of the people who were making the garments. This paper examines several aspects of unfin- ished Paracas embroidered textiles. First I reconstruct the work patterns on Paracas mantles which were unfinished when placed in their funerary bun- dles, and discuss the kinds of information that an incomplete textile can divulge about its makers that cannot be revealed by finished textiles. Specifically, in at least one mantle it is possible to identify the hands of different artists. Second, I examine details of unfinished images from gar- ments decorated in two different styles of Paracas embroi- dery, the block color style and the linear style, in which stages of execution of the stitching of images differed. These differences in the way images were created reflect basic con- ceptual differences in the respective styles. Colloquium: Ancient Textiles.

EXCAVATIONS AT PAESTUM 1984: John Griffiths Ped- ley, University of Michigan Published in AJA 89 (1985) 53-60. GREEK SACRIFICIAL BELIEFS: SOME EVIDENCE FROM ATTIC VASES: Sarah Peirce, Yale University This paper presents conclusions on the meaning of Greek animal sacrifice drawn from a comprehensive study of rep- resentations of sacrifice in Attic vase-painting. The vases depict sacrifice by means of symbolism conventional to Attic vase-painting. This symbolism is a useful source of inform- ation about Greek religious beliefs. The scenes speak most clearly about aspects for which literary and epigraphical evidence on sacrifice is relatively incomplete; that is, in the area of attitudes and emotions toward the rite. The evidence of iconography fills a gap in our sources hitherto bridged mainly by analogies with ethnographic material of other times and cultures. The sacrificial scenes on Attic vases thus provide a cor- rective to a widely accepted scholarly picture of Greek be- liefs distorted by alien perspectives. According to the most influential views on the meaning of Greek sacrifice, from those of Hubert and Mauss published in 1898 to those of Burkert (Homo Necans [Berlin 1972]), the death of the vic- tim is of central importance in the rite as the means by which the secular sphere is connected with the divine, or as an experience in which man confronts the sacred. Such theories emphasize the solemn and uncanny nature of ani- mal sacrifice, and its kinship with other acts of killing, such as human sacrifice, war and the hunt. On the evidence of the vases, which use the theme of sacrifice to connote joy, victo- ry, revelry and feasting, the validity for the classical Greeks of this interpretation of animal sacrifice is cast into doubt.</page><page sequence="27">346 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 NEW EVIDENCE FOR THE DATE OF THE TEMPLE OF THE DIVINE TRAJAN IN ROME: J. Theodore Peiia, University of Michigan, American Academy in Rome The remains of the Temple of the Divine Trajan await systematic investigation; relatively little is known about its construction and chronology. The problem of its date is of fundamental importance for our understanding of the de- sign and conception of the entire Forum of Trajan complex. Most recently, Ward-Perkins argued that much of the con- struction might have been carried out under Trajan, sug- gesting that the temple was perhaps largely completed as early as the dedication of the rest of the Forum complex in A.D. 112 (Milanges P. Collart [Lausanne 1976] 345-52). It is argued here that important evidence for the con- struction date of this temple is contained in a papyrus from Heptakomia now in Giessen, P.Giss. 69. This document, dated December 28, A.D. 118, is a grain requisition sent to the strategos at Heptakomia by an unknown official en- gaged in the transportation of a 50-foot column down to the Nile at Kaenepolis. A variety of evidence suggests that this column was one of those intended for use in the Temple of the Divine Trajan. First, the column seems to accord in both size and material with those used in the temple porch. Sec- ond, no other known monuments of the period are likely candidates for the use of a column of this exceptional size. Finally, the date of the document corresponds closely with the chronology generally suggested for the Temple of the Divine Trajan. This interpretation argues against an early dating of the temple, and a consideration of the time re- quired for transport and construction indicates that comple- tion is not likely to have occurred before the death of Tra- jan's widow, Plotina, in A.D. 121. ITALIC HOUSE MODELS AND ORIENTALIZING ARCHI- TECTURAL TERRACOTTAS OF CENTRAL AND NORTH- ERN ETRURIA: Kyle M. Phillips, Jr., Bryn Mawr College and University of Pennsylvania The 7th c. B.C. architectural terracottas from Poggio Ci- vitate and Acquarossa recently published by Eva Rystedt, Acquarossa 4 (Stockholm 1983), prove that the Etruscan practice of placing akroteria along the ridgepole of a build- ing as a cresting is well established in Northern and Central Etruria during the Late Iron Age or the Orientalizing pe- riod. That practice, known from Veil at a later date, may derive from an earlier "Italic" architectural tradition which stands behind certain Villanovan and Etruscan hut urns and a series of house models, frequently identified as temple models, from Orvieto, Rome, Nemi, and Curti. These mod- els preserve representations of special tiles which protect the ends of the wooden roof beams either by a combination of tile and protective plaque (as found at Poggio Civitate) or by a special tile which combined ridgepole tile and plaque in the same member (as at Acquarossa). Similar architectural revetments are represented on a house model from Sabucina in Sicily, now at Caltanissetta, which has been interpreted by Orlandini and Sjaqvist as a Sicul rendition of a Greek colonial naiskos. Its horse-and-rider akroteria are rightly compared to the horse-and-rider from Kamarina. I propose that the Sabucina model is a Sicul house, not a Greek nai- skos, and that it is an example of native "Italic" architecture. All of its architectural terracottas, including the horse-and- rider, find parallels either at Poggio Civitate or at Acqua- rossa. Furthermore, I postulate that the akroterion from Kamarina is a colonial Greek's adaptation of a native archi- tectural member. To a Greek of Athens or Corinth these "Italic" terracotta revetments might have appeared "most barbaric in fashion," a phrase used by W. B. Dinsmoor to describe terracotta revetments from the Temple of Apollo at Punta Alice near Cir6 in S. Italy. EYE-CUP: Gloria F. Pinney, Bryn Mawr College What do the eyes of eye-cups mean? The prevalent view that the image is simply apotropaic does not account for its aspect, strongly suggestive of a mask (J. Boardman, AA 1976, 288), while the suggestion that the eyes stand-pars pro toto-for the mask of Dionysos, presumably the idol worshiped on the "Lenaia" vases (A. Greifenhagen, Antike Kunstwerke [1966] 15; B. A. Follmann, CVA Hannover 1 [1971] 28) lacks demonstration. It is proposed here that the pair of eyes indeed represents a mask, but not the same mask in all cases and not a cult image: rather, the theatrical mask of a Silen or of Dionysos-at times, perhaps of a Nymph. The eye cup is an international type with three main forms: Ionic eye-bowls, Chalcidian eye-cups and Attic eye- cups. It cannot be established which came first and set the model followed by the others, if that is what happened. It may be profitable to set aside the question of precedence and look at the phenomenon as a whole, postulating that the image carried the same meaning in all three areas. Of the three groups, the Chalcidian cups are the most informative: the nose is normally drawn, and ears flank the eyes. The shape of the ears is either human or animal, that is, the ears of a Silen. One concludes that: a) the image evoked is a face; b) the face is now a Silen's, now a human likeness. We should seek the Silen's counterpart among the other members of the dionysiac thiasos, the Nymphs and Dionysos himself. This notion was shared in Attica. The Chalcidizing cups often have Silen's ears flanking the eyes, and the contrast of two different natures is sometimes expressed by the shape of the eye itself, "male" vs. "female." More revealing still is that the same idea-pairing man with Silen-is explicitly formulated on contemporary cups and pots, by means of full-face masks of Dionysos and Silen on either side of the same vase (E.E. Bell, CSCA 10 [1977] 1-5). The eyes then are to be understood as abridged repre- sentations of different masks. Since one is a Silen's, these are not cult images, but most likely theatrical masks. This sug- gestion finds some support in the fact that to the years in which the eye-cup was invented the ancient tradition as- signed innovations in the making of masks, and attributed them to Thespis. THE FINDSPOT OF THE STATUE OF AUGUSTUS FROM</page><page sequence="28">1985] THE EIGHTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING 347 PRIMA PORTA: John Pollini, The Johns Hopkins University The determination of the exact findspot of the statue of Augustus from Prima Porta has been problematic, since no plans were made at the time of the unscientific excavation of 1863, and reports on the discovery of the statue are rather sketchy. In addition, a contemporary lithograph illustrating its excavation has been discounted as reliable evidence for the findspot. Heinz Kihler, who has made the most recent study of the site, believes that the statue of Augustus stood against the back (N) wall of a large garden terrace in which (according to him) was located the famous laurel grove from which Augustus and other Roman triumphators obtained laurel for their triumphs. Since the topographical points of refer- ence in the lithograph do not agree with Kihler's proposed findspot, he concluded that the lithograph was topographi- cally inaccurate. When I inspected the site of Livia's villa, however, I discovered another location (in the southernmost section of the villa) which corresponds to what is shown in the lithograph and which also agrees closely with such in- formation as is provided by reports of the excavation of the statue. The spot in question is just in front of the staircase leading down to the underground room which had been dec- orated with the magnificent garden frescoes now in the Mu- seo Nazionale Romano. The establishment of the findspot of the statue of Augustus from Prima Porta thus provides new information about the relationship of the statue to its original setting. Porath, Y. See Paley, S.M. A "HousE OF TILES" AT ZYGOURIES? THE FUNCTION OF MONUMENTAL EARLY HELLADIC ARCHITEC- TURE: Daniel J. Pullen, Indiana University In 1921 Blegen made a sounding below the floor of the House of Snailshells at Zygouries, revealing EH II destruc- tion debris. In a recent study of this unpublished material I have identified approximately 200 terracotta rooftiles, of which no mention was made by Blegen in Zygouries (Cam- bridge, Mass. 1928). I suggest that the Zygouries tiles were used to roof a structure similar to the monumental House of Tiles and Building BG at Lerna. Monumental buildings at Akoviti- ka, Tiryns, Kolonna, Thebes, and perhaps the Flamboura Magoula (Hermionid) show that the Lerna structures were not unique in EH II. Rooftiles not necessarily associated with monumental structures have been found at Asine, Ler- na, Tsoungiza, and 5 sites in the Hermionid. The EH II buildings at Lerna, Kolonna, Akovitika, and Thebes share a common plan, although they vary in size. The Rundbau at Tiryns, although round, has the same de- sign of corridors and staircases around large central rooms. The widespread similarity in plan suggests that these build- ings fulfilled similar functions at each site. Evidence from burials, settlements and the monumental architecture suggests that EH II society was hierarchically organized into small, centralized socio-political units, each connected with a monumental structure. Renfrew's model of chiefdoms in EH II (Emergence of Civilisation, [London 1972]) is rejected, as redistribution of subsistence items has been shown to be of little significance for the economy of a society. Other factors, such as control of land and metals, must be the sources of power for the occupants of these mon- umental structures. Two NEW ATTIC CUPS AND THE SIEGE OF SARDIS: Nancy H. Ramage, Ithaca College One of the most important discoveries of the 1984 cam- paign at Sardis was an area of floor on which lay over 50 pots. Most were Lydian, and 2 were Attic cups. All were smashed and badly burned in the fall of mudbrick from the city wall beside it (the "Monumental Mudbrick Structure"). It had already been thought that the fall might be related to the defense of Sardis against the advance of Cyrus the Great in 547 B.C. (Herod. 1.80 ff.). The discovery of the two cups makes this thesis more convincing, since the date of at least one of them falls about the middle of the 6th c. This is a late komast cup by the Vienna Komast Painter which can be dated to about 555 B.C. (H.A.G. Brijder, Siana Cups I and Komast Cups [Allard Pierson Series 4, Amsterdam 1983] 83-84). The second is a band skyphos with exquis- itely painted panthers and palmettes. It would normally be dated after the middle of the 5th c., since band skyphoi are thought to come later than band cups; but the context at Sardis may be the best evidence for an early date for the skyphos, if it is agreed that the destruction of the wall took place at the time of the Persian siege and invasion. The floor seems to be an undisturbed one from the time of Croesus which was destroyed in the most important event reported in the history of Sardis. FOSSILS AND MEDITERRANEAN ARCHAEOLOGY: David S. Reese, University of Cambridge Archaeologists are generally aware that it is important to obtain analyses of bones, shells, plant remains and geologi- cal samples collected in their excavations. Fossils from ar- chaeological sites, however, have rarely been studied. Fos- sils are usually marine invertebrates, but can also be animal bones and teeth or plants. This paper aims at encouraging the collection and careful analysis of such remains from excavations. Frequently, fossils of marine invertebrates are simply weathered from building stone or bedrock and have little to tell us except about the geological make-up of the site. They can also, however, be objects brought to the site as votive offerings, as at the Egyptian Sanctuary of Hathor at Timna in southern Israel, at several sites in Jordan, at the Minoan peak sanctuary on Mt. Juktas near Knossos or at the Geo- metric to Early Roman temple complex at Kommos in S Crete. Fossil deer antlers are known from a Minoan sanc- tuary at Knossos, and a fossil elephant molar was found at the Asklepieion on Cos. At a recently published prehistoric Aegean site, fossil oy-</page><page sequence="29">348 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 sters and scallops are incorrectly identified as modern shells and as food debris. One oyster is holed and probably was used as an ornament, as were fossil dentalia in Neolithic Cyprus and holed fossil sea urchins at Pre-Pottery Neolithic 'Ain Ghazal and an Iron Age cave in the Baq'ah Valley, both in Jordan. Correct identification of fossil species may lead to evidence for trade of these intriguing objects. COLUMNS IN STONE: ANAXIMANDROS' CONCEPTION OF THE WORLD: Duane W. Roller, Wilfrid Laurier University The statement by the Ionian monistic philosopher Anaxi- mandros of Miletos that the world is shaped like a column is examined. Previous scholarship (summarized by Classen, RE Supp. 12 [1970] 30-69) has not considered the reason why Anaximandros chose this unusual metaphor. His em- phasis on not merely a column but a column in stone-as he explicitly indicated-provides the clue: he was influenced strongly by the contemporary emergence of Greek monu- mental stone architecture. A number of Lakonian cups produced in Sparta as early as 570 B.C., as discussed recently by Yalouris (AJA 84 [1980] 313-80) and Schaus (AJA 87 [1983] 88), not only provide a visual representation of Anaximandros' teachings but also are strong evidence for the architectural basis of his concept of the shape of the world. The association of Ionian monism with Greek architecture may have been established by the founder of the school, Anaximandros' teacher Thales, who was personally involved in the construction of the Sacred Way at Didyma (Roller, Liverpool Classical Monthly 3 [1978] 249-53). THE ARCHAIC IMAGES OF HERA AND ZEUS IN THE HE- RAION AT OLYMPIA: Irene Bald Romano, The Uni- versity Museum, University of Pennsylvania Information concerning the appearance of early Greek cult images is limited, scattered in many ancient sources and hidden in modern archaeological reports. There is a sur- prising amount of information, however, concerning the ap- pearance of two early images, those of Hera and Zeus at Olympia, which has never before been brought together. The direct evidence for their appearance is Pausanias' ac- count of the statues he saw in the Heraion (5.17.1) and the cult statue base which survives in that temple. Other indi- rect evidence, based on a comprehensive study of early Greek cult images, allows us to make further inferences about the appearance of these statues of Zeus and Hera and to eliminate unlikely possibilities concerning the materials from which the images were made, their size and positions. A coherent picture of the appearance of these two images can, therefore, be gleaned from the cumulative evidence. The frequent claim that a colossal limestone female head, found at Olympia in 1878, belongs to the cult image of Hera can now be proved incorrect, and it can be shown that the statues on the base in the Heraion which Pausanias indi- cates were "simple works" were probably made of wood and covered with real garments. The size of the base provides the clue that the seated Hera and the standing Zeus were approximately life-size or smaller. That this statue of Zeus in the Heraion was a cult image in the proper sense of the term, i.e., the focus of worship at the site, is certainly erroneous. The statue of Zeus standing beside Hera in the Heraion had little religious significance for the cult of Zeus at Olympia and was important only as an image of the divine consort of the major deity of the He- raion. That the Pheidian Zeus, created in the 430s or 420s B.C., was the first important "cult image" of Zeus at Olym- pia is not surprising in light of the conspicuous absence of early cult images of Zeus in Greece. EXCAVATIONS AT THE CASTLE OF THE 40 COLUMNS, PAPHOS, CYPRUS, 1983-1984: John H. Rosser, Boston College In 1957, when A.H.S. Megaw was Director of the De- partment of Antiquities for Cyprus, he conducted trial exca- vations at a "toumballos" mound, overlooking the harbor at Paphos, long thought to contain the remains of a temple dedicated to Aphrodite. The "temple" instead proved to be the remains of a concentric castle. Under Megaw's direc- tion, several further campaigns were conducted between 1957 and 1971 (DOPapers 26 [1972] 322-43). Work re- sumed in 1981 and 1982 under joint direction by Megaw and Rosser (Rosser, Abstracts of the Eighth Byzantine Studies Conference at Chicago [1982] 46-47). The present report concerns work done in 1983-1984. Prior to 1983, the working hypothesis was that the castle was the Byzantine castellum Baffes known to have surren- dered to the troops of Richard the Lionheart in 1191, and to have received alterations by the crusaders during their occu- pation of about 30 years (the castle was destroyed by earth- quake in 1222). In 1983 and 1984, however, pottery was discovered in construction contexts that indicated a late 12th c. date for the entire castle; thus the total structure must be considered a crusader enterprise from the outset. The castle is significant as an early example of a type (the concentric castle) which flourished only later in Europe and whose origins are often asserted to have been crusader, via Byzantium. Moreover, the destruction of the castle in 1222 provides a firm date for the varied pottery and small objects from the last occupation of the site. Finally, the architecture is quite interesting. Some of it was revealed only in 1983-1984, e.g., the bridge across the outer ditch, the stok- ing chamber for a steam bath, and a millroom which offers the earliest evidence for the sugar industry on Cyprus. A LATE ROMAN VILLA BATH-HOUSE AT SAN GIOVAN- NI DI RUOTI: J.J. Rossiter, University of Alberta Excavations in 1983 and 1984 at the Late Roman villa at San Giovanni di Ruoti have exposed the substantial re- mains of an elaborate, decorated bath-house attached to the SE corner of the villa. The bath-house was built in the early 5th c. and extensively modified later in the same century, thus providing a unique example of this type of private building in the Western Roman Empire at this period. It</page><page sequence="30">1985] THE EIGHTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING 349 offers valuable evidence for continuing luxury in villa con- struction in the 5th c. and sheds light on technical building methods in this period. These can be favorably compared with the specifications for bath-house construction outlined in Late Roman technical treatises, notably those of Faventi- nus and Palladius, recent editions of which (H. Plommer, Vitruvius and Later Building Manuals, Cambridge 1973; R. Martin, Palladius: Traite d'Agriculture I-II, Paris 1976) have suffered from a lack of adequate archaeological comparanda. This excavation produced sufficient evidence to permit a tentative architectural reconstruction of the building, which includes indications of how the rooms were lit. Furthermore, the siting of the bath-house provides valu- able clues to the role which it played in the social life of the resident household of the villa. ATHENIAN WEST SLOPE VASE PAINTERS: Susan I. Ro- troff, Hunter College West Slope ware was the most common type of painted pottery in Hellenistic Athens. Originating in the 4th c. tra- dition of gilded ornament on finer black glaze pottery, it de- veloped in the early Hellenistic period into a distinctive style, with a limited number of conventional motifs executed in white and dilute clay on the black glaze ground. It re- mained the preferred technique of decoration from the first quarter of the 3rd c. until the 1st c. B.C. The designs were, for the most part, repetitive and monotonous (necklaces or garlands of ivy and grape, leaping dolphins, simple geome- tric patterns), and changed little throughout the period. Although the standard of work was not high, it is none- theless possible to recognize the hands of individual painters of Attic West Slope ware, as has been done recently for the West Slope pottery of Knossos (P. Callaghan, BSA 76 [1981] 39, 56, 63-64) and for the closely related Gnathia pottery of S. Italy (T.B.L. Webster, BICS 15 [1968] 1-33; J.R. Green, BICS 15 [1968] 34-50). So far, three individ- uals have emerged, each active at a different time in the Hel- lenistic period. Their careers can be dated to the first quarter of the 3rd c., the mid-3rd c., and the late 2nd c. At least in the case of the 3rd c. painters, there is close coincidence in shape among vases by the same hand, suggesting that a single pot- ter and painter worked as a team or, perhaps more likely, that potter and painter were one and the same. This study can help to enrich our understanding of work- shop practices in Hellenistic Athens, and can in addition aid in refining the chronology of shape development for types which were ornamented in the West Slope tradition. PRO ANNIO: IN DEFENSE OF A RENAISSANCE ETRUSCO- LOGIST: Ingrid D. Rowland, University of Califor- nia, Los Angeles The Dominican friar Giovanni Nanni (Annius) of Vi- terbo (1434-1502), as one of the earliest writers on Etruria, occasionally still comes under modern scrutiny. P.G. War- den (AJA 1983) has revived the question of Annius' utility, concluding that the monk's History of Viterbo, newly edited in 1981, differs little from medieval tradition in its analysis of Classical sources. The same cannot be said of Annius' masterwork, the Commentaries of 1498. These reveal a me- ticulous editing of Classical texts interwoven in analysis with patristic sources, but also with toponyms and archaeo- logical remains. Annius' Commentaries, when scrutinized closely, reveal the workings of a superb mind whose opin- ions often come uncannily near our own perception of ar- chaeological truth. A problematic author, Annius nonethe- less is 500 years closer than we to archaic Italy. Annius' problems are imposing. If a formidable scholar, he was even more formidably an opportunist. In a humanis- tic world newly dominated by Greek refugees from the Sack of Constantinople, Annius chose to make his career by counterposing Etruscan to Hellenic culture. The Commen- taries ingeniously contrive to trace Etruscan origins to Noah, thereby giving Tuscan religion a Biblical authority which Annius' Platonizing Greek rivals could hardly match. Where evidence failed him he forged it: "ancient" statues, Etruscan inscriptions and Classical Latin manu- scripts all materialized in his versatile hands, winning An- nius entr&amp;e to Pope Alexander VI Borgia, the admiration of Luther, and an emphatic influence on the themes of art and rhetoric in Renaissance Rome. Indeed, it is Annius' accep- tance by the side of Reformation which best explains the swiftness of his posthumous eclipse. His fabrications re- main useful for their sure grounding in genuine knowledge. EXCAVATIONS AT THE GREEK ORTHODOX SITE OF CA- PERNAUM (1978-1984): James Russell, University of British Columbia The Franciscan excavations at Kfar Nahum, generally presumed to be the biblical Capernaum, have long attracted keen interest by virtue of the well preserved synagogue and contemporary early Christian remains. Exploration of the adjoining Orthodox lands to the E begun in 1978 has added much new information complementing and, to some extent, modifying the picture of the history of the site established by the Franciscans. The project is directed by Dr. Vassilios Tzaferis of the Israeli Department of Antiquities, which sponsors the work jointly with the Greek Patriarchate in Jerusalem and a Consortium of five American and Cana- dian universities. Covering an expanse of about 2 ha. along the NE shore of the Sea of Galilee, the Orthodox property contains the eastern quarters of the ancient town. The well defined stra- tigraphy encountered in all four excavated areas points to dense and extended occupation from the 7th to the 10th cs. A.C. This evidence contradicts the established opinion that the community was abandoned shortly after the Arab con- quest in the 7th c. (V. Corbo, Cafarnao 1. Gli edifici della citta [Jerusalem 1975] 220). While most of the remains un- covered to date belong to a fairly regular pattern of resi- dential buildings, two structures deserve special notice: a small bath-house of excellent construction fronting the lake, tentatively dated to the early 3rd c., and a piscarium com- prising two semicircular pools associated with an adjacent harbor. Of the considerable variety of finds discovered dur- ing the five seasons the most significant by far is a hoard of</page><page sequence="31">350 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 282 gold dinars of the Ummayad dynasty, possibly the rich- est cache of gold coins ever found in Israel. TrHE 1984 SEASON AT LATE BRONZE AGE KALAVASOS- Avios DHIMITRIOS, CYPRUS: Pamela Russell, Mur- ray C. McClellan, University of Pennsylvania The sixth season of excavation at Kalavasos-Ayios Dhi- mitrios produced new information about the imposing 13th c. B.C. administrative Building X in the NE Area and cul- minated in the discovery of an unplundered 14th c. B.C. tomb containing numerous items of gold jewelry (total weight, 432 g.) along with other luxury goods. Excavation to floor level continued in the large (7.5 x 20 m.) Pithos Hall on the W side of Building X. More stone pithos bases and pithoi with perforated bottoms were un- covered. It is now estimated that 40 pithoi were kept in this hall. Six monolithic pillars ran down the center of the hall; one newly found is the best preserved. Further excavation revealed that the E portion of Build- ing X is composed of many medium-sized rooms, of as yet unknown function, in contrast to the single large hall in the W. Tomb 11, immediately W of Building X, contained the remains of 3 young women and 3 children. The women were buried on rock-cut benches with exquisite gold jewelry including hoop earrings, hair spirals, bracelets, rings (two with Cypro-Minoan inscriptions), and necklace beads of or- nate types. The remaining grave gifts, including ivory pyxi- des (two duck-shaped), two core-formed glass vessels, an odd glass-lead-gold pyxis, and a bronze dagger, were de- posited on the floor where the children were found. Of the 30 complete ceramic vessels, 7 are Mycenaean, including two LH IIIA kraters decorated with dolphins and lilies re- spectively. While unanticipated, the wealth of this tomb is not surprising considering the importance of the surround- ing, albeit somewhat later, settlement. ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS IN ARCHAEOLOGY: THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHO- LOGY: Donald Sanders, Columbia University Architectural historians, geographers, psychologists and semioticians have demonstrated that the formation and use of the built environment reflect individual value judgments and behavioral decisions which are indicative of more gen- eral cultural attitudes. Architecture would, therefore, seem to be one of the most valuable artifacts at an archaeologist's disposal. Traditionally, however, archaeologists have not studied architecture as a culturally coded artifact, but have focused on forms, materials, function and construction tech- niques. This paper presents one possible alternative ap- proach to the study of ancient architecture by using the methods and theories of environmental psychology to dis- cover and examine ancient behavior. The existence of some cross-cultural behavioral tenden- cies identified by social scientists, such as personal space, territoriality, privacy and boundary controls, can be tested on archaeological material. I have selected a discrete build- ing unit from the Aegean Early Bronze Age site of Myrtos, Crete, as a test case and examined its architecture and as- sociated artifacts using the techniques of environmental psychology. This paper presents my discoveries of, e.g., the use at Myrtos of symbolic boundaries, territorial markers, and the size of the residents' interpersonal contact zone. These indicators provide empirical evidence for the public and private behavior, lifestyle and culture of the ancient in- habitants, evidence not previously thought within the com- pass of archaeology. The results are significant because, with the addition of other innovative methods, they allow archaeologists to gain a deep understanding of ancient peo- ples, their behavior and values, from a study of what and how they built. THE ORIGIN OF FIKELLURA POTTERY: Gerald Schaus, Wilfrid Laurier University R.M. Cook (BSA 34 [1933-1934] 90-91) recognized that Fikellura pottery was more closely related to Middle Wild Goat II pottery than to Late Wild Goat even though Middle Wild Goat II pottery ended about 600 B.C. while Fikellura, it now seems, only began about 550 B.C. Recent- ly the stylistic connection between Middle Wild Goat and Fikellura was at least partly explained. P. Dupont (Dacia n.s. 27 [1983] 37) analyzed the clay of a large sample of East Greek pottery and found that Middle Wild Goat and Fikel- lura pottery were both made in Miletus. Late Wild Goat, on the other hand, was made in North Ionia, in or near Clazomenae. The affinities between Middle Wild Goat and Fikellura are therefore likely to reflect the local tradition from which they both stem. But the evidence to show direct continuity between the two wares is poor. In fact the paucity of evidence suggests there was a considerable decline or even temporary disruption in vase painting at Miletus for about fifty years ca. 600-550 B.C. One explanation for the revival of vase painting at Mile- tus ca. 550 B.C. may be that a small number of vase makers moved to this city from somewhere nearby. In particular, the painters of some Ionian Little Master Cups, thought to have been made in Samos about 550 B.C., may have changed their homes. The figure style of some of these cups is re- markably similar to that of early Fikellura vases. Elements of the older Middle Wild Goat style could have been passed down from vases, textiles or even terracotta revetments in use in Miletus. This theory would help explain the sudden appearance of Fikellura at Miletus and its relation to both Ionian Little Master cups and Middle Wild Goat vases. TOKENS AS FUNERARY OFFERINGS: Denise Schmandt- Besserat, University of Texas at Austin Tokens are among the funerary offerings found in graves and tombs at such sites as Tell es-Sawwan, Arpachiyah and Tepe Gawra in Iraq and Hfajji Firuz and Susa in Iran. I pre- sent material emphasizing the following points: 1. Tokens included in burials are often made of colorful stones and es-</page><page sequence="32">1985] THE EIGHTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING 351 pecially white marble, whereas the tokens found in habitats are usually made of clay. 2. Tokens are included in infant as well as adult burials. 3. A group of spheres constituted the only grave offering included in Tomb 107 of Tepe Gawra, considered the most prestigious tomb of the level. I discuss the possible function of tokens as funerary of- ferings. Two possibilities come to mind. First, they were symbols representing quantities of goods meant to be useful in the afterlife. In this case, the stone tokens could be re- garded as "replicas" of the clay tokens used in daily life, made in durable material to last for eternity. Second, the funerary tokens were status symbols for the administrators who used them in daily life. If so, the fact that tokens are found in pre-adult burials would indicate that such posi- tions were inheritable. This research is a new development of my work on a re- cording system based on tokens used in the ancient Middle East prior to the invention of writing. DIOCLETIAN'S PALACE AT SPLIT, YUGOSLAVIA, IN THE LIGHT OF NEW CERAMIC EVIDENCE: Vanca Schrunk, Minnesota Society The construction of Diocletian's palace at Split has been placed between A.D. 295 and 305, the year Diocletian abdi- cated and retired to that site. Although the view of most scholars has been that all the architectural features date from the time of Diocletian and were more or less completed by 305, the evidence for their chronology has never been fully published. The palace remained an Imperial posses- sion after Diocletian's death in 313, but no construction has been clearly dated to that period. Recently completed studies of African and Phocaean red slipped wares excavated in parts of the palace by the Uni- versity of Minnesota and the Town Planning Institute of Dalmatia from 1968 to 1974 help to clarify the chronology of Diocletianic and post-Diocletianic features in the areas investigated. The pottery indicates that a mosaic courtyard in the SE quarter was laid after 305, and probably after Diocletian's death. Late 4th and early 5th c. dates are sug- gested for a structure in the eastern bath complex and for the tile and marble floor in a room of unknown use near the mosaic courtyard. Red slipped sherds of the 5th and 6th cs. found in levels of debris associated with the demolition of Diocletianic structures provide new dating evidence for structural changes in the palace and for its transformation into a town, which has been related to the fall of Salona in A.D. 614 and the settlement of its citizens in the palace. RELATIONS BETWEEN SYRIA, MESOPOTAMIA, AND THE UPPER EUPHRATES IN THE FOURTH-THIRD MIL- LENNIA B.C.: THE CERAMIC EVIDENCE: Glenn M. Schwartz, Yale Babylonian Collection Ceramic analysis of the recently excavated assemblages from Gritille Hoyiik on the Upper Euphrates, Tell Selen- kahiye on the Middle Euphrates, and Tell Leilan in the Habur triangle allows for new conclusions on the relations between Mesopotamia, Syria, and SE Anatolia in the 4th and 3rd millennia. The two major ceramic wares of the 4th millennium Upper Euphrates are also found in the regions to the E and S: 1) Chaff-faced coarse ware is found to the E in the Habur Triangle at Tell Leilan and Tell Brak; 2) Wheelmade Simple ware includes numerous shapes from the southern Mesopotamian Late Uruk repertoire. In con- trast, the pottery from the mid-to-late 3rd millennium in the Upper Euphrates closely resembles the contemporary as- semblages of western Syria and the Middle Euphrates. The predominant ware type is the mass-produced "Plain Simple Ware" known from Amuq I-J, Tell Mardikh-Ebla, and Tell Selenkahiye. These shifts in the geographical distribution of ceramic wares in the Upper Euphrates may reflect changes in socio- economic relationships with other regions. It is likely that the southern Mesopotamian Uruk ceramics found in the Upper Euphrates in the 4th millennium indicate a southern Mesopotamian commercial presence, alongside the local north Mesopotamian chaff-faced assemblage. The 3rd mil- lennium western Syrian connections may reflect the influ- ence of the state established at Ebla. HERAKLES AND THE LESSER MYSTERIES ON AN AM- PHORA NEAR EXEKIAS: H.A. Shapiro, Stevens Insti- tute of Technology A fragmentary black-figure amphora, Reggio 4001, in the Manner of Exekias (ABV 147, 6) was first published in 1952 (G. Procopio, ArchCl 4, pls. 30-32). On the neck is depicted Herakles with Kerberos, on the body, Demeter in her chariot, with Triptolemos, Herakles and Athena, Her- mes, and Ploutodotas. The principal scene has been inter- preted either as Demeter's departure from Eleusis (M. Nilsson, GGR2 [1955] 849) or her arrival in Eleusis (H. Metzger, Recherches sur l'imagerie athinienne [Paris 1965] 10). J. Boardman (JHS 95 [1975] 7) recognized that the two scenes on the vase allude to Herakles' initiation at Eleusis just before his final labor (Euripides, Herakles 613). But before that, he had first to become a "naturalized" Athenian, through initiation in the Lesser Mysteries at Athens, which were first instituted for this purpose. The founding of the Lesser Mysteries in Agrai probably took place under Pei- sistratos (E. Simon, AntK 9 [1966] 84). It is suggested here that the scene on the body of the Reggio amphora is set in Athens, not Eleusis, and commemorates the founding of the Lesser Mysteries. Demeter has just arrived from Eleusis. Triptolemos acted as hierophantes when Herakles was ini- tiated in the Lesser Mysteries (Xenophon lIell. 6.3.6). Hermes is present as ancestor of the Kerykes, the Athenian family which administered the Lesser Mysteries. Ploutodo- tas has in the past been interpreted as Plouton/Hades, Dio- nysos/Iakchos or a personification. He is here identified as Zeus Meilichios, who is invoked as Ploutodotas in an Or- phic hymn and who was also worshiped in the Lesser Mys- teries (M. Jameson, BCH 89 [1965] 159-62). The scene is a good example of Athenian reworking of Eleusinian myth and cult under the tyrants.</page><page sequence="33">352 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 THE EARLY HELLADIC II "CORRIDOR" HOUSE: Joseph W. Shaw, University of Toronto Like the LH "Megaron," the EH II "Corridor" House is coming to be understood as the most advanced architectural form of its time. The type was first recognized at Lerna in the House of Tiles by J. Caskey. At the time it seemed unique, but since then other examples have been unearthed at Akovitika by P. Themelis and T. Karagiorga, and at Thebes by V. Aravantinos. Particularly important was the discovery and interpretation of the "Weisses Haus" at Ko- lonna on Aegina by H. Walter and his colleagues, whose published models and plans have helped us to visualize such buildings. Thus what was once unique appears now-and will probably continue to do so as more EH centers are ex- cavated-to be a typical dwelling or combination dwelling and administrative center of the upper, ruling class. The more developed form of these rectangular buildings consisted of a series of large rooms on axis, sometimes with an entrance portico on either side. Of particular interest is the "doubling" of the external walls which, as shown at Lerna and graphically indicated by Walter at Aegina, pro- vided for stairways leading to the upper storey which, argu- ably, consisted of two or three large rooms surrounded by a porch. What has not been explained, however, is the reason for multiple approaches to the same upper rooms and how the circulation within them can be deduced from the position of the walls of the lower storey. Nor has the local origin of the form been discussed in sufficient detail. One result of such a study is that public/communal and private/secluded areas can probably be distinguished on the upper floor. In addi- tion, the porched areas may have been regularly subdivided for those using the individual interior rooms. EXCAVATIONS AT KOMMOS, CRETE, DURING 1984: Maria Shaw, University of Toronto Excavation in 1984 at the Minoan harbortown of Kom- mos concentrated on monumental Building T, built S of the E-W Minoan road leading inland to other centers and E of J, a large two-storeyed building that may have served as a center for harbor affairs. T itself begins on the W with a long colonnade facing S onto a large court. In 1984 our aim to define more of T on the E, especially to learn about the length of the building, was gratified when a trench revealed its northeastern corner 55.40 m. from Building J. Despite the excellent preservation of the walls, the in- terior rooms-most appearing from their arrangement to have been for storage-retain scarcely any of their original contents. South of these rooms, which are E of the stoa, are a long E-W corridor (a later remodelling) and a wide, unusu- ally long, rectangular space, both opening, doorless, onto the court. Building T spans the period of LM I-LM II, after which parts of it remained in secondary use. Paralleling T in dimensions and, as far as we can deduce at present, also possibly in plan, is Building P, large seg- ments of which have been exposed this season. Preliminary study suggests that it was built in early LM III. The func- tions of the two buildings remain at present vague, for arti- facts are rare. Their large size and the character of their walls, however, clearly bespeak a civic/commercial func- tion. For Building P, in particular, an affinity with other massive buildings of LM III date at nearby Haghia Tria- dha should be noted, which reflects the importance and probably close interaction between these sites at the time.

RECONSTRUCTING THE WOODEN FURNITURE FROM THE GREAT TUMULUS AT GORDION, TURKEY: Eli- zabeth Simpson, The University Museum, Univer- sity of Pennsylvania Between 1950 and 1974, more than 30 pieces of wooden furniture, most dating from the 9th and 8th cs. B.C., were found at Gordion, Turkey. Working drawings were made, and the wood was then stored in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara. No further detailed study was un- dertaken. In 1981, after the original working drawings were found to be incorrect, the University Museum ini- tiated a program to study, draw, conserve and reconstruct the Gordion furniture. I have now completed drawings of the carved, inlaid table, known as the "Pagoda Table," and the two inlaid standing screens from Tumulus MM. The table and screens have been cleared and consolidated. The wood is now strong and the inlaid designs are clear and bright. In 1983, I reconstructed the table, according to my drawings, on a plexiglass mount. It is once again a table and can, for the first time, be viewed as such in the Ankara Mu- seum. The two inlaid screens, whose function was once a mystery, are serving stands: in the carved rings of their tops once sat small bronze cauldrons from which food or drink was ladled out to guests at a sumptuous funerary banquet. The reconstruction of the screens is now certain; an earlier mix-up had led to an erroneous composite reconstruction drawing. In 1984, I mounted the two screens on plexiglass for display in the Ankara Museum. Together with the "Pa- goda Table" they can now be seen, for the first time, beauti- fully cleaned and properly reconstructed. PHILORHOMAIOI: PORTRAITS OF ROMAN CLIENT RUL- ERS IN THE GREEK EAST IN THE FIRST CENTURY B.C.: R.R.R. Smith, Magdalen College, Oxford, Princeton University This paper isolates and interprets a group of late Hel- lenistic portraits which has previously gone unnoticed. The evidence for it is numismatic, but the coins also help to place some sculptured portraits in the same context. These por- traits are an excellent test case for a simple thesis: that por- traits of Greek and Roman dynasts were conditioned pri- marily by political needs, not artistic factors. Portraits of powerful men in the ancient world were made to express ideas about the basis of their power. There is a small group of kings and dynasts in the Greek East of the 1st c. B.C.-the first is Ariobarzanes I Philorho- maios of Cappadocia-who do not adopt the prevailing</page><page sequence="34">1985] THE EIGHTY-SIXTH GENERAL MEETING 353 style of image of late Hellenistic royalty (a long-haired, youthful, divinized image), but instead use a hard, older, short-haired image which looks distinctly "Roman"-i.e., it is very like the realistic middle-aged image favored by the late Republican Roman elite. The style of these portraits cannot be explained by artistic development or influence, nor simply by the aesthetic preferences of the rulers con- cerned. The portraits are all of a new class of dynast in the Greek East-the Roman client king, who owed all to Rome. I argue that these portraits look deliberately "Roman" and express the political quality of the title "Philorhomaios," "Friend of Rome." By this image, a ruler announced his loyalty to, and dependence on, Rome, and made clear that Rome was the guarantor of his power and position. The style was programmatically "Roman." THE OLYMPIAN HEAD OF HERA (?): A RE-EXAM- INATION: Phillip V. Stanley, San Francisco State University The over-lifesize female head found at Olympia in 1870 was identified by the excavators (Olympia III, 1-4, pl. 1) as belonging to the cult statue of Hera mentioned by Pausanias (5.17.1-4). Hill, having noted inter alia the absence of the ear and hair on the right side, and assuming that the two sides of the extant head were the same size, argued that the face originally was asymmetrical, which is unusual for a frontal cult statue, and that the right ear was farther back and closer to the head than the left. The only parallels for this arrangement of the ears which Hill found are on several Archaic sphinxes turning their heads to the left. She there- fore identified the Olympia head as coming from a sphinx and not the cult statue. As for the protruding knob once thought to be part of Hera's veil, Hill explained it as a strut to support the sphinx's wings, even though she admitted that this arrangement would be unusual (Hesperia 13 [1944] 353-60). In 1983 and again in 1984 I was able to examine the Olympia head and discovered that the rear break is not parallel to the frontal plane; the right side of the face is ca. 1? inches shorter than the left, the same thickness as the hair and knob on the left. Furthermore, that the sur- face of the right side was recut prior to the final destruction of the statue is indicated by both a shallow indentation, lo- cated directly opposite the left ear and only slightly larger, and a small ridge by the rear break. The hairline near the back was also altered. The recutting indicates that the ear- lier damage, limited primarily to the area of the right ear, was repaired. I therefore propose the following reconstruc- tion of events. After this initial damage, a sculptor restored the piece by moving the right ear farther back into the pro- truding hair, which would preserve, at least from the front, the symmetrical quality of the face. In order to do so he also had to alter the hairline just below the crown. Although the evidence of recutting does not prove conclusively that this head belonged to the cult statue of Hera, it does indicate that: 1) the face was symmetrical and therefore not a sphinx, and 2) the statue was significant enough to warrant attempts to restore its original appearance. Stieglitz, R.R. See Paley, S.M. THE NOTEBOOK OF ARTHUR PULLINGER, AN EARLY TRAVELLER IN SYRIA AND ASIA MINOR: Ronald S. Stroud, University of California, Berkeley In a private collection in Cambridge the unpublished (and hitherto unknown) notebook of Arthur Pullinger has recently turned up. Pullinger was a merchant and anti- quary who for several years resided in Aleppo as a member of the Levant Company. In addition to numerous descrip- tions of ancient sites, itineraries, lists of coin legends and other antiquarian lore, Pullinger recorded the texts of over 100 Greek inscriptions. Many of these were taken over and published by Richard Pococke without acknowledgement in his Inscriptionum Graecarum et Latinarum Liber of 1752; others have remained unpublished. After he went bankrupt in 1738, Pullinger travelled overland from Aleppo to Con- stantinople; he has left in his notebook a valuable journal of this journey, in the course of which he visited many ancient sites and discovered a few more inscriptions. It is the pur- pose of this paper to bring Pullinger's work to the attention of students of epigraphy, archaeology, and topography of Syria and Asia Minor. THE ARGENIDAS DEDICATION TO THE DIOSKOUROI: George N. Szeliga, Hartford Society A Lakonian votive relief in the Museo Lapidario Maf- feiano in Verona (Ritti, no. 23), dated to the 2nd or early 1st c. B.C., is unique in that it shows a man worshipping in a sanctuary of the Dioskouroi. A short inscription identifies the dedicant as one Argenidas son of Aristogenidas. Al- though the relief undoubtedly alludes to an actual cult place, its significance lies in the fact that the monuments shown in the sanctuary correspond to the three stages in the life of the Dioskouroi described by ancient authors. The earthly aspect of the twins is represented by statues in hu- man shape, the chthonic by amphorae, and the celestial by wooden structures known as dokana. The dokana rest on top of a cave which serves as a shelter for a ship and is la- belled ... KEION, probably Anakeion. The presence of do- kana in association with the cave shelter suggests that these symbols have an important role in the veneration of the Dioskouroi in their heavenly guise, as intercessors for hu- manity, or more specifically, protectors of seafaring vessels. The entire sanctuary complex sheds light on the nature of the Anakeion in Athens, whose marine connections are clearly indicated by the inscription IG I2 127. BEYOND ARTIFACTS: INTERPRETING HUMAN IMAGES IN THE PREHISTORIC AEGEAN: Lauren E. Talalay, University of Michigan The human form has long served as an important meta- phor. Cross-cultural evidence reveals that societies fre- quently see the structure of their world reflected in the rela- tionships of body-parts. For example, the Dogon village is viewed as a body with the council house placed at the "head"</page><page sequence="35">354 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 and a sacred altar, representing the female sexual parts, sit- uated at the center of the village. The Abonese, who conceive of local groups as parts of the body, view the group which corresponds to the head as having political hegemony. Given the well documented anthropological evidence for the metaphorical uses of the human body, it is worthwhile investigating the possibility that early prehistoric cultures also viewed the body as an important social symbol. While archaeologists have limited access to such cognitive particu- lars, anthropomorphic figurines can shed light on early symbolic expressions embodied by the human form. Neo- lithic figurines from Greece and the Balkans, with their various forms and distortions, provide a provocative corpus for study. This paper begins with a discussion of ethnographic re- ports about the symbolic uses of the human form. Presenta- tion of an intriguing sample of Greek Neolithic figurines follows. It is suggested that a number of the peculiar distor- tions on these figures have symbolic anatomical importance and reflect societal beliefs. THE 1984 EXCAVATIONS AT THE NEOLITHIC SITE OF KALAVASOS-TENTA, CYPRUS: Jan A. Todd, Murray C. McClellan, Brandeis University, University of Pennsylvania The fifth and final season of excavation at the Neolithic site of Kalavasos-Tenta, Cyprus, was conducted in the sum- mer of 1984 under the direction of Ian Todd of Brandeis University with the assistance of the Brock University Ar- chaeological Practicum. During this season, a number of new areas were ex- plored and several old areas re-examined, yielding a com- prehensive picture of one of the earliest settlements in Cy- prus. The limits of the site have now been recognized with the discovery of a large ditch cut in the bed-rock, 20 m. be- yond the previously excavated defensive wall. Traces of ad- ditional circular structures have been found between the outer ditch and the defensive wall as well as on the N part of the hill enclosed by the wall. The course of the defensive wall was clarified by tests on the E, N and W. A burial, the sixth within Structure 9, was excavated, yielding the first grave offerings. Stratigraphic tests reveal that the earliest level contains post-holes, the only remains of a curvilinear feature, and that subsequently there were three phases of the stone complex and the smaller round structures on the slopes of the hill. The excavations at Kalavasos-Tenta are part of an inter- disciplinary study of the prehistory of the whole Vasilikos Valley and add much to our understanding of the earliest economic and cultural life on Cyprus. THE FOURTH CENTURY SKENE OF THE THEATER OF DIONYSOS AT ATHENS: Rhys F. Townsend, Clark University Investigation of the 4th c. skene of the Theater of Dio- nysos at Athens (its "Lykourgan" phase) has provided new evidence to demonstrate the existence of a colonnade across the central section of the stage building in addition to the columns already known to have existed in the paraskenia at each end of the structure. The presence of this colonnade has been disputed ever since W. Dbrpfeld originally sug- gested the possibility of one, which he reconstructed in con- junction with a wall behind the columns (Das griechische Theater [1896] 65-67). Essentially, however, Dtrpfeld's only evidence for a colonnade was the fact that an exact number of column spacings, equal to those of the paraske- nia, could fit on the existing foundations. All later inves- tigators, criticizing Dbrpfeld's evidence as insufficient, re- jected the colonnade (e.g., O. Puchstein, E. Fiechter, A. von Gerkan, J. Travlos). It has been possible to resolve this dispute by examina- tion of the numerous extant blocks of the architrave/frieze course (both members having been carved together in one block), which have not been fully studied before. Of partic- ular significance is a re-entrant angle block which can be precisely located over a column in one of the two corners between the paraskenia and the central portion of the skene. This evidence, together with additional supportive detail, makes it virtually certain that a colonnade continued across the entire length of the central section of the stage building. With the appearance of the first permanent stage structure of the theater thus clarified, its placement in both the devel- opment of Athenian architecture and the history of ancient theater design can be properly assessed. ANCIENT TEXTILES FROM EAST ASIA: John E. Voll- mer, Glenbow Museum, Calgary Since Sir Aurel Stein's discoveries of silk fabrics at var- ious sites in Central Asia over 70 years ago, archaeology has provided scholars with an ever-increasing body of evidence for Chinese textile production. This paper surveys the two periods of archaeological activity-the first initiated by Stein and others, which continued through the early 1930s; the second begun in the late 1950s, which has been con- ducted almost exclusively by archaeologists from the Peo- ple's Republic of China. Several hundred fabric fragments, as well as complete yardages and garments, have been recovered. They range in date from the late Neolithic (roughly 4500 years ago) to the late dynastic period (17-18th cs.). Geographically they span centers of Chinese cultural development and areas of Cen- tral Asia and southern Siberia associated with China through conquest or trade. The paper also discusses the four main areas of scholarly attention: 1) identification of fiber, particularly silk from the domesticated bombyx mori moth; 2) technical analysis of pattern weaves to determine loom types and other techno- logical data about East Asian textile production; 3) stylistic analysis of design to determine primacy of pattern (or tech- nology) to trace influences on textile production in and out- side China; and 4) chronological development of textiles or costumes within Chinese cultural contexts.

Lambrechts unearthed a sanctuary in Galatian Pessinus. Although the complex is not the famous sanctuary of Cybele partly built by the Attalids of Pergamon, the excavated temple is no less important. It is the only example in the Greek East of the specifically Roman combination of a temple (here a Corin- thian peripteros) and a cult theater on its longitudinal axis. A comparison of its architectural decoration with the roughly contemporary temples of Ancyra and Pisidian An- tioch, supported by ceramic evidence, points toward a date of construction during the reign of Tiberius. This temple almost certainly is the Sebasteion mentioned in local in- scriptions. Evidence for this conclusion is the epigraphically attested introduction of the emperor cult in Pessinus toward the end of Tiberius' reign, as well as the high podium of the theater in front of it. This podium can be explained as a protection for the public during the gladiatorial games, which according to epigraphic evidence were part of the local emperor cult. The pronounced western features of the sanctuary and of some adjacent buildings could suggest that the imperial administration of the new province was some- how involved in the planning of the whole complex and in the introduction of the emperor cult in Galatia. THE DATE OF THE ATHENIAN STOA AT DELPHI: John Walsh, Princeton University To be published in AJA. EXCAVATIONS AT LA PIANA, 1983-84: Jane K. White- head, Fairfield University Two seasons of excavation at La Piana, a late Etruscan site 7 mi. W of Siena, have led to new conclusions. Rather than to a domestic structure, the walls so far unearthed ap- pear to belong to an artisanal area. This interpretation is suggested not only by the large number of finds relating to the manufacture of textiles (loom weights, spindle whorls, ochre powder for dyeing, etc.) but also by the nature of the architecture. The rooms are quite large and strongly built; a channel constructed in the northernmost wall of the area serves as a drainage outlet. A large vat or tank, cut into the calcareous limestone bedrock to a depth of 0.51 m., shows distinctive marks caused by the action of hot water; it may have been used for the dyeing of fabrics. A second field was opened about 50 m. to the SW. Walls of two structures were discovered, their proportions smaller and their construction less sturdy than those in the other field. These walls are oriented at exactly the same angle, however, and are thus part of the same building phase. Ce- ramic finds in the two fields are similar as well, and include many large storage jars. Habitation at the site now appears to coincide with the economic flourishing of Volterra, which lies some 20 mi. to the NW. Since La Piana was a small town on the trade route from Volterra to Perugia and the inland cities to the SE, it may thus have been abandoned after Sulla's defeat of that city. EXCAVATIONS AT CORINTH, 1983-1984: C.K. Wil- liams, II, American School of Classical Studies at Athens This report is a synopsis of the activity of the American School at Corinth conducted during the spring of 1983 and 1984 along the E flank of the theater of Ancient Corinth. The results of excavation include the distinguishing of three Roman reconstructions or structural repairs to the Greek theater within the 1st c. and the first half of the 2nd c. A.C. A destruction date for the theater around 375-400 has been determined by an analysis of the various destruction levels associated with the theater. The E side of East Thea- ter Street is now known to have been lined with private houses and shops during the Roman period. The new evi- dence invalidates the previously held theory that the sanc- tuary of Athena Chalinitis is to be found in this area. One interesting object, directly associable with an Egyp- tian cult, is the fragment of an Osiris Hydreios; most of the objects of religious significance recovered so far appear, however, to have been for domestic use. INVESTIGATIONS AT MYTILENE, 1983/84: Hector Wil- liams, University of British Columbia In 1983 and 1984 geophysical, architectural and ar- chaeological investigations were carried out by the Cana- dian Archaeological Institute at Athens in the Genoese castle that occupies the site of the acropolis of ancient Myti- lene. Remains of numerous Hellenistic and Roman struc- tures reused in the castle walls (including a fine late 1st c. B.C. Doric tomb, previously known only epigraphically) were catalogued by Dr. Caroline Williams, and a magneto- meter/resistivity survey was carried out over selected areas of the castle in order to locate likely areas for excavation. In the spring of 1984 a 5 x 5 m. test trench was sunk down to bedrock in one such area; this trench uncovered a rich de- posit of Hellenistic and early Roman pottery, lamps and terracotta figurines (overlaid by late 18th c. Turkish mate- rial) comprising over 600 inventoried items and including a new type of late Hellenistic/early Roman fine ware imitat- ing metal that may originate on the island of Tenedos. THE POTTERY FROM THE WEST COURT HOUSE AT KNOSSOS: DEFINING THE BEGINNINGS OF EARLY MINOAN IIA: David E. Wilson, University of Cincinnati In 1969 John Evans made deep soundings in the West Court of the palace of Knossos as part of his investigation of the Neolithic settlement (AnatSt 22 [1972] 115-28). Direct- ly beneath the paving stones of the West Court he found three basement storerooms of an Early Minoan building which I have called the West Court House. These store-</page><page sequence="37">356 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 89 rooms were filled in after a short period of use as part of a reorganization of the area in EM IIA. My study of the pottery from the West Court House shows that it represents a hitherto unrecognized early phase of EM IIA at Knossos. The pottery has some features which are more common in the preceding EM I, such as pede- stalled bowls and chalices in dark gray burnished ware, and the use of pattern-burnishing as seen on stemmed goblets. The pottery from the West Court House, however, shows clear development and innovation from EM I and belongs at the beginning of EM IIA in the Knossian sequence. The West Court House pottery makes it possible to speak of a local Knossian EM IIA style of pottery, partic- ularly in the case of the dark-on-light painted jugs and the pattern-burnished goblets. Imports from elsewhere in Crete are more readily identifiable, including a group of fine painted ware side-spouted bowls best known from the Me- sara tholoi. This evidence supports a view of regional pot- tery styles in Early Minoan Crete which continued through Middle Minoan. TERRACOTTA FIGURINES DEDICATED TO APOLLO HY- LATES AT KOURION, CYPRUS: THE WORKSHOPS: Nancy A. Winter, American School of Classical Studies at Athens Excavations sponsored by The Johns Hopkins Univer- sity and directed by Dr. Diana Buitron uncovered a votive pit just outside the Archaic precinct of the Sanctuary of Apollo Hylates. The earliest material dates to the 7th c. and burial seems to have taken place in the 1st c. B.C. The esti- mated 10,000 fragments of terracotta figurines represent, for the most part, horse riders and chariot groups of types known from the publication by J.H. and S.H. Young, Ter- racotta Figurines from Kourion in Cyprus (1955). Approxi- mately 1000 are riders and 600 are chariot groups com- posed of a quadriga with two charioteers; some are com- pletely handmade while others have mouldmade human faces. The nearly 2000 mouldmade examples derive from ca. 50 different moulds. Since numerous identical moulds could have been taken from a single model, shared among different workshops, and used for relatively long periods of time, identification of separate workshops or individual hands must be based on other information. The handmade horses best reveal the characteristics of different artisans who repeatedly work clay in the same fashion. At least 30 coroplasts can be identified, most of whom had available 5 to 10 moulds for human faces. The date of the stylistically latest face mould suggests the artisan's period. Greatest pro- duction comes from a shop of three artisans active in the early Hellenistic period. SOME OBSERVATIONS ON PUNIC AMPHORA STUDIES: Samuel R. Wolff, University of Chicago The state of our knowledge in the field of Punic amphora studies, whose main purpose is to provide data for recon- struction of the economy of the Punic settlements in their Mediterranean context, is surveyed in this paper. Several scholars have proposed Punic amphora typologies, those by P. Cintas and J. Mafi' being most often cited. The contri- butions of both these scholars, and those of others based on their studies, are reviewed here. In addition, the stamps on Punic amphoras and the possible contents of Punic ampho- ras are discussed. One key goal for future research in Punic amphora stud- ies is to recognize the differences among amphoras manu- factured in the various Punic settlements, e.g., to distinguish a Carthaginian from a Motyan amphora. The discovery of kiln sites and the petrographic and/or chemical analyses of sherds or wasters from those sites and others ultimately pro- vide the best opportunity to subdivide the broad category known to us as Punic amphoras. The chronology for Punic amphora types, and for Punic pottery in general, needs to be refined. The wide range of dates provided by Cintas for certain forms, while often quoted, is in many cases not very helpful. With the publica- tion of sherd material from carefully excavated sites having good stratigraphic sequences, and with scientific analyses of such material, the study of Punic amphoras will soon pro- gress beyond the rather incomplete state in which it present- ly finds itself.
