<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIII.-PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY. xxxi., 12. C. A. Strong. 'A Plea for Substantialism in Psychology.' [This very elaborate article continues a discussion with A. 0. Lovejoy on the nature of 'transcendent reference ' .which started in vol. xxix., p. 673 and was continued in vol. xxx., p. 589. The writer protests against treating 'data' as existents; they are " an illusory addition, without substance and without efficacy, to the entire closed system of the real world." And " referring to the real is not an activity whose nature lies in being present to consciousness, but is part of the transitive function by which the self enters into relations with other things. ... Like loving, hating, desiring, the power of referring to the real is one with which every animal is born. It is originally automatic, and never ceases to be so, even in the most subtle human reflection." Phenomenalism in psychology is rejected and a substantial self (to be identified with " the real brain ") is affirmed. It is claimed that such 'substantialism' in psychology refutes scepticism and agnosticism.] xxxi., 13. R. Demos. 'Eros.' [Taking Eros as "theprimordial attrac- tion of the actual by the ideal," suggests that " stand Plato on his head, and you get Freud." Finally the author regards " three notions as funda- mental to Plato's system: the Limit, the Unlimited, and the passage between the two, which is the Eros." . . . Yet Plato had not " a consistent and definite system." However "the ultimate fact is the polarity between the Limit and the Unlimited " . . and " in sum the real world is an enduring activity-a perpetual process, self-generating, and renewing itself, directed toward the achievement of value."] C. Hodes. 'Specific Quality.' [" An absolutely specific quality that shall never be ' ex- emplified' ... is a sheer myth.... Exemplification and ingression of specific qualities . . . can be spoken of only in a metaphorical sense. * . There are novel specific qualities," as creation in art and music shows, and novel concepts.] xxxi., 14. W. T. Stace. 'The Present Dilemma in Philosophy.' [Consists in the fact that both realism and idealism " are both founded upon dogmatic unproved assumptions." "Absolute idealism has been moribund for the last thirty years ", but not on account of the arguments of the realists. These were mostly irrelevant, and " proceeded upon the monstrous delusion that to refute Berkeley was to refute absolute idealism." But absolute idealism " never rested upon logic. Its logic was a 'rationalisation' of its intuitions, visions, and hopes. And now that the religious faith in which it rested is gone, idealism collapses." The essence of Realism is that external tlhings exist when no one is aware of them. But this too is " a pure dogmatic assumption ", which rests on common sense and cannot be proved. Common-sense (which includes causation) is simple and convenient, and works pragmatically, but we must not intrude into theoretical philosophy beliefs which have no foundation except practical convenience. So presumably philosophy</page><page sequence="2">116 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. must remain in its present deadlock!] D. Cory. 'The Realism of Common Sense.' [Being the Introduction to a forthcoming Primer of Epistemology for the Laity. Common sense's " fundamental outlook is healthy, practical, and roughly reliable." Epistemologically it is " impossibly naive "; but " its masculine vitality will remain triumphant when the dust of our last analysis has blown away."] A. D. Osborn.

'To Sleep, Perchance to Dream.' [A brilliant essay, which argues that " sleep, and the other seeming lapses into unconsciousness to which man and the higher animals generally are subject, present, if they are to be taken at their face value, damaging evidence against such forms of idealism, pluralistic or monistic, as consider the ground of all being to be self-conscious or personal mind." Prof. Fuller makes good fun of a IBerkeleyan God who keeps sleepers in mind, and of an Absolute whose "stomach can turn the absence of a stone into bread and digest the lack of its own gastric juices," but he does not seem to be very familiar with the psychological facts of dreaming, and with the bulk of the evidence for the great complexity of the self.] E. Bisbee. 'Knowledge by Fiat.' [Has- discovered (unlike most of his critics), that C. I. Lewis's " conceptualistic pragmatism . . . turns out to be sheer empiricism, with a pseudo a priori which modifies the essential nominalism of the whole theory not one whit." No doubt it was playing a trick on the confiding intellectualist to give a new sense to the a priori, but had not Kant himself done the same ? And is it not an inveterate habit of philosophers to pervert the technical terms of their predecessors ?] A. A. Merrill. 'Is Time Relative ?

L. K. Frank. 'Causa- tion: An Episode in the History of Thought.' [In physics explanation in terms of cause and effect is now out of date: not so in the social sciences. But " we are desperately in need of a social science to replace the present body of abstract theory and conflicting beliefs and . . . until the social scientists are able to . . . relinquish the older mechanical ideas of cause and effect, no real-progress can be expected."] D. C. Williams. 'Truth, Error, and the Location of the Datum'. [A rather minute and technicat discussion of the comparative merits of 'epistemological dualism' and cepistemological monism' and of 'critical realism and neo-realism' in their accounts of truth, error and the datum.

This is a new feature, to appear annually in future. It will doubtless be useful, and will gradually become more complete. The present issue takes no notice of the Aristotelian Society's Supplementary Volume, of 'Discussions' in MIND, and of philosophical articles in general Reviews, like the discussion between Sir Herbert Samuel and Sir Arthur Eddington in the Nineteenth Century. Also, though vol. ii. of the Philosophical Publications of the College of the Pacific is listed under the name of its Editor, the separate contributions are not. xxxi., 19. T. T. Lafferty. 'The Material World.' [Insists that "matter is something to be mani- pulated and investigated . . . manipulative and- instrumental."

Fuller. 'Meditation upon</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 117 Teleology.' [A very pretty bit of gibing, from a 'naturalist' standpoint, not undeserved by the usual inconsistencies, of teleologists. It is pointed out that " from a universe wholly motivated by final causes we are as free to infer diabolism as theism." But Prof. Fuller apparently sees as little as the ordinary teleologist that teleology presupposes a certain dualism, to render it possible to read the process of events as the realisation of a pur- pose that overcomes' obstacles. Nor does he examine whether ' causal ' explanation is not at bottom just as anthropomorphic as teleological.] M. Hurst. 'Can the Law of Contradiction be Stated without Reference to Time ?' [Examines the dicta of Kant, Bradley, Bosanquet, W. E. Johnson, and McTaggart, and arrives at the conclusion that it cannot. " The belief that it can is founded on a confusion arising out of the facts: (a) that there is a la,w of self-identity of attributes which seems very like the Law of Contradiction and which can be stated without reference to time; (b) that there is a form of the law of contradiction which it is very plausible to represent as free from time conditions." Hence it is not possible to prove the unreality of time by means of the Law of Contradiction as McTaggart tried to do.] PROCEEDINGS OF THE ARISTOTELIAN SOCIETY, 1933-34. N.S. Vol. xxxiv. L. S. Stebbing. Presidential Address: 'Constructions'. [A timely and useful paper which calls attention to the ambiguities of the term 'con- struction' and similar expressions used in present-day philosophy by writers such as B. Russell, Stace, Eddington. A sharp and rather ques- tionable distinction is drawn at the end of the paper between ' construction' and 'analysis' in respect of logical value, viz., that there may be rival constructions, whereas a true analysis is exhaustive.] I. A. Richards. 'Multiple Definition.' [A proposal to get rid of the ambiguity of philo- sophical words, not by introducing additional technical words, but by defining the different senses of the existing words in terms of a limited vocabulary of ordinary English words.] A. J. Ayer. 'On Particulars and Universals.' ['White is a construct out of, or is the class of, sense- contents resembling each other in being white.' ' To say that two objects have the same quality is simply equivalent to saying that they resemble one another in a certain respect.' Thus it would seem that white is a con- struct, a class, an identical quality, and a resemblance between objects, besides being used in two meanings in the same sentence.] A. E. Duncan= Jones. 'Universals and Particulars.' [The title of this paper is not altogether happy. The writer's real interest is in the analysis of the par- ticular sense-datum and the 'general fact'. He finds that a red sense- datum is constituted by certain 'objects ' or elements (red, here, now) which have instances. He owns, however, that it is with 'a certain re- luctance ' that he admits that a particular sense-datum is constituted by universals. His tentative conclusion in regard to 'general facts ' is that they are to be defined in terms of a relation between the meanings of general sentences and non-general facts-a mode of definition which seems in danger of being circular.] J. Laird. 'The Conception of Authority.' [What entitles those who command to the obedience of those who obey ? Not strength merely, nor sagacity, nor moral character, but utilitarian grounds such as these, that the obedience makes communal living possible or makes it good.

As in Prichard there is a curious disregard of the political side of Plato's argument.] Margaret Macdonald. ' Verification and Understanding.' [An excellent criticism of the view that confounds the meaning of a proposition with the verification or proof of its truth.] D. J. Moxley. 'The Conception of God in the Philosophy of Whitehead.' [A paper the appreciation of which must be left to those who think they can understand the esoteric language in which Whitehead has chosen to state his later thoughts.] W. Kneale. 'The Objects of Acquaintance.' ['Analysis' imperatively requires a satisfactory doctrine of knowledge by acquaintance. What, then, are the objects of acquaint- ance ?-particulars or universals or both ? Various views are criticized, and the writer's own view, which is admittedly tentative, is then stated, that the objects of acquaintance are the elements of events, and that these are not rightly called either particular or universal. The view may be compared with that of Duncan-Jones above: both writers refer to Ramsey. In the last part of the paper the writer argues that' acquaintance is never separate from knowledge; he discusses the case of supposal. The paper is interesting, but stronger on the critical than the positive side.] J. W. Reeves. 'The Origin and Consequences of the Theory of De- scriptions.' [The object of the paper is to consider whether the theory of Descriptions and the Principle of Acquaintance together involve a methodo- logical solipsism. An interesting and careful account is given of the de- velopment of Russell's views, so far as relevant to this question. The main point brought out is the importance of universals and acquaintance with universals if solipsism is to be avoided by Russell's doctrine.] Dorothy M. Emmet. 'Some Reflections concerning M. Bergson's 'Two Sources of Morality and Religion'. [The following quotation will suggest the main contention of the paper. Bergson " wants to secure an 'open universe ', instead of an evolutionary process which is the realization or appearance in time of preconceived ends or ideals. This, I think, is because . . . he starts his thinking from the experience of growth ".] C. D. Broad. 'Is " Goodness " a Name of a Simple Non-natural Quality ? ' [First Moore's doctrine about the logical characteristics of the notion of good is analysed in a series of propositions, and then the logical possibilities in regard to each of these propositions are analysed in detail. The reader will probably feel that the discussion is all very abstract and in the air, and that a more direct logical procedure would have been more instructive. It is perhaps the habit of abstract logical discussion which leads Broad to commit himself to the following extraordinary paradox: "It does seem to me conceivable that the relation denoted by 'better than' might be more fundamental than the characteristic denoted by ' good ' ".] 0. S. Franks. ' Choice.' [A good and clearly written paper which analyses choice and discusses very fully the difficulties involved in the analysis. Some of the difficulties might have been dismissed more briefly, and it is needlessly paradoxical to say " There is no such thing as an act of will to be discerned in our experience; it is a philosophical fiction "-a state- ment which renders all the more open to criticism a previous statement that "Aristotle like other Greek philosophers failed to recognize that there was such a thing- as will ".1</page><page sequence="5">Pf:ILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 119 ARiSTOTELIAN SOCIETY, SUPPLEMENTARY VOLUME XIII., 1934: MODERN TENDENCIES Ir PHlLOSOPEY. J. W. Scott. Inaugural Address: ' Humanity and History.' [The following quotations indicate the main contentions of the paper. " For idealism, characteristically, there are large regions of reality such that, in knowing them, we must consent to be participators in them if we are to know them rightly." " In the case of history" such participation consists in " allowing ourselves to speak and think as moral agents in the report we make ".] C. E. M. Joad, J. Strachey, G. C. Field. Symposium: 'Liberty and the Modern State'. [Joad's view about liberty may be said to be practically that of Mill, but his statement of this view is prefaced by a criticism of the view represented by Bosanquet; the value of the criticism is impaired by frequent misunderstandings of the view criticized. Strachey's paper is an exposition of Communistic theory. The existing type of State is a necessary result of class antagonisms. The governing class is bound to repress liberty, and the method used, forcible or otherwise, is immaterial. Only in a classless society will liberty be possible-not at first, for the Communistic State too must repress liberty in order to establish itself, but perhaps eventually. Field first expresses briefly his general agreement with Joad (subject to some reservations about Bosanquet) and his strong dissent from Strachey on the ground, of the one-sidedness of Marxian doctrine. In the remainder of the paper he discusses the special case of liberty of opinion in a general way and without much regard to the State's concern with the matter.] M. Black, J. T. Wisdom, M. Cornforth. Symposium: 'Is Analysis a Useful Method in Philosophy'? [The first two papers deal, not with the question whether analysis is useful, but with the preliminary question what analysis is. Black tries to elucidate its nature by inventing a highly simplified and quite unreal illustration- a procedure which is not perhaps very helpful. Wisdom's paper is ex- cellent in this respect that it explains very clearly (1) the distinction between formal and philosophical analysis, (2) the nature of the method of philosophical analysis, but he seems not to be able to see any point in the questions (suggested by Black) whether the method, when practised as a mere philosophical exercise, is really useful, and whether it does not involve questionable presuppositions. Cornforth's paper opens in a rather startling way. " I have attempted to give the Marxist criticism of analy- tical philosophy." " The clue to the weakness of the analytic method is to be found in the historical role which it plays as a philosophy of the bourgeoisie." Discounting these absurdities, we may say that the main and reiterated contention of the paper is that any real advance in knowledge must come from the scientific investigation of what actually takes place, and not from a philosophical dissection of ' Facts ' into ' Elements '- a contention which is more reasonable.] J. M. Thorburn, A. H. Hannay, P. Leon. Symposium: 'Artistic Form and the Unconscious'. [The title of this symposium is hazy, and the first paper in this respect matches the title; it attempts to explain the difference between music and the " arts of the visual " by means of ideas derived from Houston Chamberlain and Ernest Jones. Hannay submits some of Thorburn's views to a brief critical examination. Leon compliments Thorburn on his lucidity and can on occasion be even more hazy, but in the main is critical; he agrees with Hannay in distrusting Jones's interpretation of the inner meaning of Shakespeare's tragedies.] L. S. Stebbing, L. J. Russell, A. E. Heath. Symposium: 'Communication and Verification'. [The subject of this symposium is philosophically important, and the first two papers are very</page><page sequence="6">120 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. good, but can hardly be summarized adequately in a short space. The subject for discussion is stated by Miss Stebbing as follows: " How is the common reference required for communication possible ? I want to con- sider answers to this question which have been given by philosophers (Carnap and others) who accept the principle of verifiability." The problem is that the more these philosophers insist both on verifiability in terms of the individual's own experience and on the privacy of individual ex- perience, the more difficult it is to see how communication or common knowledge is possible. Russell explains very clearly how it has been sought to escape the difficulty about private experience by developing the principle of verifiability on purely behaviourist lines. His criticism is that this more developed view makes 'science' relative to some group of observers whose reactions happen to be similar. Heath adds some useful comments on the matters discussed in the other two papers.] R. I. Aaron, C. A. Campbell. Symposium: 'Is there an Element of Immediacy in Knowledge' ? [Aaron takes the question to be whether knowledge is entirely discursive or in some cases intuitive. He has no doubt that there are instances of intuitive knowledge, and would explain the opposed view as due to a confusion between knowing and thinking. Discursive thinking (or inference) itself involves the direct seeing of the conclusion. The remainder of the paper discusses the difficulties that arise when we ask whether there is an element of immediacy in our knowledge of the external world. Campbell deals only with the first part of Aaron's paper. He points out first that to know that a conclusion follows is not the same as to know that it is true, and that the latter knowledge is mediate. Then. taking the alleged instances of immediate knowledge, he concedes the case of seeing a brown patch, but disputes the immediacy of 7 + 5 = 12. Finally he answers at greater length Aaron's criticisms upon the doctrine that the test of truth is coherence.] REVUE DE ME]TAPHYSIQUE ET DE MORALE. 40e Annee, No. 1. January- March, 1933. R. Quinton. Les deux p6les foyers d'origine, avec intro- duction par J. de Gaultier. [In 1896, Quinton deposited with the Academie des Sciences a bundle of papers which was opened in 1932 at the request of his widow. From this the present document is reprinted. It gives a sketch of the author's curious theory that-living beings began to evolve independently at the two poles, and that the human race originated in the Southern hemisphere. The author's theory starts from the admitted fact that cold-blooded animals preceded warm-blooded animals in the order of evolution. He accounts for the latter on the principle that, with the gradual cooling down of the earth, it became necessary for living beings to maintain within themselves the stable temperature within which the first living cells originated. One consequence of this hypothesis is that the body temperatures of warm-blooded creatures must give a clue to the order of their appearance on earth, the warmer-blooded being the latest arrivals. By this test, human beings, though late, are not the latest arrivals. Another consequence is that living beings must have begun to evolve where the earth first began to cool, viz., at the two poles. The author is opposed to Darwinism, as the theory of the transformation of one species into others by spontaneous variation and selection of the fittest. For him, every form of life is stable: new forms must have evolved at the poles, not by transformation of existing types of organisms, but by the cells, in which life first appeared on earth, creating fresh organic forms around themselves in the effort to maintain, against a changing environment, the same chemical,</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 121 temperature and other conditions under which they themselves originally came into being.-The editor of these Notes introduces them with a brief summary of the author's whole theory of evolution.] A. Errera. Quelques remarques sur les mathe'Mtiques intuitionnistes. A propos de plusieurs notes de M. Heyting. [It is impossible for mathematicians to remain indifferent to the dispute between the "intuitionist" and "formalist'" schools in present-day mathematics, for the intuitionists, with their denial of the law of Excluded Middle, claim that all mathematical reasoning which employs that law is fundamentally mistaken. The author, therefore, embarks on some pretty polemic against the theories of Brouwer and Hey- ting, turning chiefly on the sense in which a number may be said to " exist " for the construction of which a formula has been laid down but which has not actually been constructed; and on the problem whether the question: Is a certain number rational or irrational ? is to be answered with the intuitionists by saying that it is neither, or with the formalists by saying that we do not know which it is, but that it must be the one or the other. On the whole, he seems to score in this logical tail-twisting.] R. Berthelot. L'Astrobiologie et la pensee de l'Asie: Essai sur les origines des sciences et des theiories morales (suite).

Ruyssen. Le droit des peuples a disposer d'eux-memes (suite et fin). [Conclusion of this excellent paper. Having dealt with antique, mediaseval, and early modern thought on the subject in the first instalment, the author reviews here, first, the rationalistic-humanistic theories of the 18th century, which accustomed men to think of States, on the analogy of human individuals, as "c moral persons " and to apply to their relations the concepts in use for the relations between individual citizens. There is the attempt to conceive of humanity, as a whole, as a Great Society composed of individual States and Peoples as its members. There is the dream of orderly and peaceful relations among all the members of that Society, somehow main- tained by common consent and with the authority of all. The influence of Montesquieu, Rousseau, Kant, as well as the aspirations of the leaders of the French Revolution, who proclaimed the willingness of France to abstain from any war of conquest or interference in the internal affairs of other peoples, are noted. We pass next, via the " principle of national- ities ", to experiments with options and plebiscites as organs for the self- determination of national minorities. And, thus, we come to the Great War and the Peace Treaties, in which, for the first time in the history of the world, the attempt was made, however imperfectly, to give effect to the self-determination of peoples, and to protect national minorities which had to be left under the political domination of other Nation-States. The part played by the League of Nations, the elevation of Iraq from a Man- dated Territory to membership of the League in its own right, the recogni- tion of the independence of the several Soviets in the U.R.S.S., are all made to illustrate how an abstract ideal, originally little more than a utopia, is gradually being brought within the realm of practical politics. " A utopia plays in relation to political and social action the same part. which an hypothesis plays in science." The paper concludes with a brief discussion of three possible interpretations of the concept of " natural right ".] -IItudes critiques. V. Jankelevitch.

Among these fragments was one, entitled Prescience, of which Renouvier made no use. This is here published with a short introductory note by L. Dugas. It passes briefly in review the solutions of the problem of Divine omnipotence and prescience in relation to human liberty, attempted by Luther, Wycliffe, Jansen, Pascal, Descartes, and finds them all self-contradictory. It then passes on to argue that the principle of contradiction cannot be abandoned as has been -attempted by the " sophist " Hegel, but that, whilst it holds for the order of being, it does not hold for the order of the possible. Liberty consists in the power to select out of several possibilities one to be made real in the order of being by my act. A " miracle ", perhaps; but it is a mistake to think that philosophy can explain everything, or that there is nothing inexplicable. Liberty in the sense defined is a fact, even if it is a fact which philosophy can only accept without being able to explain it.] E. Geismar. Lapersonnalite de Kierlkegaard. [A popular lecture on Kierke- gaard's life and writings.] J. Gherea. Le Moi et le Monde. [Starts from the Berkeleyan position of a self and its ideas. Points out that " self" implies " not-self ", and that there is, prima facie, no basis for this distinc- -tion in the Berkeleyan position, and hence no justification for the concept of a " self ". Self and not-self are interpretations and constructions introduced into primitive and immediate experience. Hence, proposes to assume a " fictitious being ", viz., an impersonal flow (" duration ") of immediate experiences, in order to see what factors and elements such ,experiences contain, and what organisation, if any, they spontaneously reveal. Tries to show how a certain group of data will distinguish itself from all others and become the nucleus of what, after the introduction of 'the distinction of self and not-self, comes to be called " my " body as against all " other " bodies. Similarly, certain visual, tactual, etc., data come invariably together with certain movement sensations, whereas others, though similar to the first, do not go together with movement sensations. Yet, if the former are, because of their connection with movement, volun- tary or the result of will, it is plausible to regard the latter as voluntary, too, and thus as evidences of " other " wills. In the middle of the dis- -cussion, there is a curious digression on the " pure self ", i.e., the sense of personal identity, as distinct from all particular contents of the self.] L. Blanchet. La preparation du "Cogito" cartesien dans la philosophie grecque. [It has long been recognised-the present author has himself devoted a previous work to this topic-that Descartes has been profoundly influenced by his reading of Campanella, and, above all, of St. Augustine. The present paper, with great learning, traces the affiliations of Descartes' thought back beyond Augustine to their roots in the Aristotelian concept -of thought thinking itself, and the Plotinian doctrine that, in thought thinking itself, thinking and being, subject and object, are one. The author reviews in detail, and compares with the implications of the Des- cartian Cogito, the metaphysical and epistemological applications made of these concepts by Aristotle and Plotinus. He concludes by showing in a very interesting way that the reason why Descartes never attempted to develop the implications of his Cogito in the direction of Kantian andHegelian idealism, is precisely this that he never emancipated himself from the realism ,of Greek thought which came to him through Campanella and Augustine from Plotinus and Aristotle.

Relativite iet Quanta. [A compact, but clear, survey of the relations in present day Physics between the Relativity and the Quantum theories. Each has de- veloped independently of the other: " the Relativity theory is the crowning achievement of the old macroscopic Physics, whereas the Quantum theory has its origin in the study of the world of atoms and corpuscles." To a large extent, at present, they are irreconcilable with each other, and no really satisfactory adjustment has so far been suggested. There are, indeed, points of contact. One of these was pointed out by Einstein himself, as far back as 1905, when it was seen that certain photo-electric phenomena implied a " granular " structure of luminous energy. Taking c as the velocity of light, and assuming that light of the frequency v is divided into grains of energy (quanta, photons) of the value hv, then relativity dyna- hv mics attributes to the movement of each of these quanta the value -. Another point of contact was effected by the theories of Sommerfeld and Bohr, though the difficulties peculiar to their theories were not removed until the work of Dirac. But Dirac's attemupted reconciliation of the Relativity and Quantum theories suffers from serious difficulties of its own. Thus, e.g., he has to credit the electron with the possibility of move- ments of negative energy when it is very doubtful whether such movements of negative energy exist in fact; and, again, whilst the symbols defined by Dirac's equations can be physically interpreted consistently with the modern view that physical laws are statements of probabilities, yet such an interpretation breaks the symmetry of the Relativity theory, by com- pelling a special treatment of the time-variable, apart from the space- variables. " So long as we look upon Dirac's theory as an analytic form devoid of physical meaning, it can be considered as being in harmony with the Relativity theory; but as soon as we want to draw from it experiment- ally verifiable conclusions, we have to use wave-functions for defining the possible values of observable magnitudes and their respective pro- babilities; and this cannot be done without introducing time as having an irreversible sense or direction. . . . Otherwise expressed, Relativitv is for Quantum Physics nothing but a limit which holds in the domain of the macroscopic, i.e., in so far as the quantum of action can be considered negligible. At bottom, this is a consequence of the impossibility, intro- duced by the Quantum theory, of separating the configuration of a system from its dynamics ". (CJ. here the Heisenberg principle.)]. A. Rivaud. La nature des Modes selon Spinoza. [The problem of the derivatioin of the Modes from the single, eternal substance is the " central problem of Spino- zism ". How can the Substance be one and the Modes many; or the Substance eternal and the Modes subject to a beginning and end in time; or the Substance infinite and the Modes finite ? Above all, how can their relation, whatever it may be, be said to be " deduced " from the essence of the Substance with logical necessity ? In the Substance, existence and essence necessarily coincide: the essence implies existence. The Modes, finite or infinite, lack this necessary existence by definition. " How, then, can the finite come into being at all ? " How is the existence of the finite, or the manifestation of the Infinite in the finite, made intelligible by Spinoza ? The author examines this problem carefully and exhaus- tively from every angle suggested by the text of the Ethics and bv SDinoza's</page><page sequence="10">124 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. other writings, especially his Letters. His ultimate conclusion is that the theory, as it stands, is not intelligible; that Spinoza has tried to express in words an intuition which really transcends the power of words to render. In that respect, it shares " the common fate of all great systems and all religions ".] R. W. Sellars. L'Hypothese de l'Emergence. [A somewhat discursive article which does not add anything new to what the author has said in other books and articles. It is just a summary in French of the main points of his Evolutionary Realism. He allies himself emphati- cally with modern Realism and Naturalism, and declares Nature to be the true object of metaphysics. At the same time, he rejects the old- fashioned type of materialism or mechanism, and pleads for the recognition of qualitatively distinct levels, or niveaux, in Nature, resulting from the " emergence " of qualitatively new orders of phenomena, given the develop- ment of their appropriate conditions. He claims that his view combines experimental determinism with the recognition of novelty as an intrinsic feature of the world.] J. Gherea. Le Moi et le Mionde (suite et fin). [Conclusion of the article begun in the previous issue. As before, the article is written in disjointed sections through which it is hard to trace any connected thread of argument. There is a great deal more about the " pure self " (le moi pur), which in the first instalment seemed to be a digression, but which is now presented as one of the constructions erected on the basis of immediate experience. In fact, the author distinguishes four selves, viz., le moi de droit, which is the impersonal immediate experience as a whole; le moi defait, which is an individual consciousness (an individuial " duration " of immediate experiences) distinguished from other individlual consciousnesses; le rnOi substantiel, which is the permanent, self-identical support of each duration of changing experiences; and le mnoi pur, which is, in turn, the basis of the substantial self. There are, also, discussions of the "construction " called an " object " and, in general, the " external world ", and of the identity of an object for several consciousnesses; also of the constriiction of a singrle one-dimensional time-scheme, when really time consists of just the nuimberless durations, running independently alongside each other, of the individual streams of consciousness. Similarly, there is a construction of space. Throughout, there is a note which re- minds one of the argument of F. H. Bradley's Appearanice and Reality, which, however, is not quoted; e.g., " as soon as we leave behind us the harmonious and assured universe of impersonal consciousness (immediate experience), contradictory constructions become necessarv ". Towards the end, there is a sectioni in which the author compares his treatment of the problem with that bv Meverson in ldentiteW et Realite.] P. Masson=Oursel. L'Inde n'a-t-elle connu qu'un mysticisnie ' incornplet" ? [A reply by this distinguished expert on Oriental thought to a statement by Bergson, in his Les deux sources de la Moraile et dZe la Religion, to the effect that Indian mysticism is incomplete in comparison with Christian mvsticism, in so far as the latter is a mysticism of " action, creation, love " whereas Buddhist mysticism stops half-way, " detaching itself from hulnman life, but without making contact with the I)ivine life." The author main- tains that, apart from Bergsoin, no thinkers have asserted the existence of the elan vital more emphatically than the Indian mystics, but they have held that the spirit must realise itself by running counlter to that ean. For Indian thought, the dlan vital is, indeed. the creator, but it also enslaves all who do not succeed in eithler suspending it, or turning it back upon itself, or sublimating it.i-Etudes Critiques.

[This article is the introduction to a two-volume work, shortly to be published, under the title of La Pensee, the first volume dealing with La genese de la pensee et les paliers de son ascension spontane'e; the second with Le concours de la spontaneite et de la liberte dans le developpement de la vie intellectuelle. The author claims that, hitherto, the problem of thought, as such, has either been neglected and ignored altogether by philosophers, or, when it 'has been attempted, some one-sided aspect of thought has been singled out and offered as being the whole of its nature. Or, again, certain coufficts, contradictions, antinomies which have appeared in the work of thought, have been fixed and, as it were, immobilised in abstract concepts, and the result has been substituted for the living thought itself. He asserts that it is possible for thought to think itself, for intelligence to become intelligible to itself, for a theory of the nature of thought to be achieved which shall explain thought from its origin through its methods of development to its final achievement-a theory which shall be at once "genetic and integral ". Our task is " to follow the life of thought in its real development, its organic growth; and then the oppositions which remained insuperable in the domain of conceptual constructions, will appear as the vital rhythm of our mental existence, not only on the biological plane, but even more and more perfectly on the spiritual plane ". There is a common nature, or principle, in all the diverse manifestations, and all the aspects, of thought; if we can grasp this " effective truth of our living thought ", all the various and often seemingly contradictory aspects of it will become harmonious and intelligible.] J. Nogu6. La determination du fait primitif (premier article). [The true line of development from Descartes runs through Malebranche, Maine de Biran and Bergson: at least, it is in this context that the author defines and tIreats his problem of the " deter- mination of primitive fact ". With Maine de Biran, he distinguishes in philosophy between the "original evidence ", or "initial affirmation ", and the " primitive fact ". E.g., for Descartes, the original evidence is the Cogito ergo sum, which is a complex including the ego, thought, and existence beyond thought. The primitive fact thus has to be determined by analysis within the original evidence. As Malebranche saw, the reflec- tive analysis which distinguishes within the original evidence the ego- factor, points us back to the "act which constitutes the ego" as a primitive fact. And this primitive fact, as Maine de Biran saw, is not merely posited by analysis, but must be the object of an actual concrete experience, an experience which de Biran identified as effort met by resistance. The pro- blem is to explain how, from this primitive fact, we get to an external world ordered in time and space. This problem de Biran clearly perceived, but</page><page sequence="12">126 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. his attempt at solving it turns out to be inadequate. Here Bergson helps us forward with his concept of " effort " as elan, which is the victory of the self over the inertia of the body, and which " contains withinitself indivisibly time and space ". But, Bergson, too, went astray when he identified the distinction between present and past with the distinction between sensori- motor experience and images. It is not true that all images are charac- terised for us as referring to the past: many images have no time reference at all; others refer to the future. Again, the very experience of the elan- already contains the distinction of past and present, prior to any'distinc- tion of image from sensori-motor experience. The temporal and spatial order of sense-data reflects, and points back to, the acts of the elan which constitute, and bring into being, these orders. Maine de Biran was right in demanding that these acts should be studied and defined.] R.. Berthelot.

Incidentally, there is an im- pressive list of distinguished mathematicians in whose works Peano dis- covered errors, and also a long list of concepts and theorems of which Peano was the real author, but the credit for which, indifferent to personal fame and claims of " priority ", he allowed to go to others. The article concludes with a bare allusion to Peano's interest in the creation of an international language, viz., Interlingua, or Latin without inflexions.]- Varietes. H. fiouhier. Les premiers rapports de Saint-Simon et d'August? Comte. [Discusses the question whether Comte owes the famous principle, Tout est relatif, voila le seul principe absolu, to his association with Saint- Simon whose secretary he became in August, 1817. The problem arises. from the fact that, when Comte, in 1854, reviewed his life-work and claimed that his developed Positivism was but the elaboration of principles which he had conceived in his youth, he reckoned his relevant writings from an article published in 1819, and discarded, as valueless juvenilia, all that had appeared from his pen before that date. Yet, the principle above quoted appears in 1817 in an issue of L'Industrie, published under the name of Saint-Simon. The author, after examining in great detail the available evidence, comes to the conclusion that Comte may very well have hit upon that principle independently, and prior to his having come into contact with Saint-Simon; and, again, he points out that, even if Saint-Simon was the causa occasionalis of Comte's formulation of the principle, it was. Saint-Simon in that period of his life in which he stood himself under the influence of Augustin Thierry, so that'it would be better to speak of an influence on Comte of " Saint-Simon and his school ".]-IItudes Critiques.

Bergson still confounds dynamisme and mobilite' or devenir, and is unable- to conceive of an actus purus, a perfect ev pyeta, and this leaves an impassable gulf between the- elan vital and the God of Christianity. With all his devotion to empiricism, he cannot successfully identify the real with the actually perceived, but only with the perceptible, though a consistent Bergsonian has no means of saying what is or is not perceptible, unless he introduces into his empiricism metaphysical presuppositions which may have unexpected consequences. Bergson's own great defect arises from his narrowly practical conception of intelligence, shown in his tendency- to identify speculative intelligence with reverie. A more searching appeal to "intuition " would reveal intelligence as a "tendency of the mind towards truth, an-d towards nothing but truth ", and thus justify the Thomist conception of an absolute perfection, an actus purus, which is- frst at once in the order of being and in that of thought, along with its conse- quences, the doctrines of the analogy of being, the distinction, in finite things, between essence and existence, and that between substantial form and indeterminate matter.] A. Forest. La mrethode ide'aliste. [The common character of all the French ' idealist ' philosophies is that they find the principle of all reality in the life of the mind, which is not a given thing, but an activity of giving. The problem then is to find the way back to the world of " nature ". How does mind constitute nature, and how may we re-live the process ? One type of theory (Ravaisson,. Boutroux, Bergson) appeals primarily to the practical reason, the will, the "heart," in -the seventeenth century sense of the word; a second (Lachelier, Lagneau, Hamelin) is inspired more directly by the thought. of Kant's first Critique, and may be called dialectical: its aim is to 'find in reflection on the critical idea' itself the means of justifying idealism. There is a Kantian inspiration in all these doctrines but there is also some- thing else, as is shown by the way in which they replace the notion of formal obligation by that of the attraction to the good. This thought, which comes down through Pascal and Malebranche, goes back to St. Augustine and his definition of caritas as concupiscentia sancta.] A.. Mansion.
